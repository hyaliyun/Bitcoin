Richard J. \\"Rick\\" Kaminski (1944–2011) was a printer, real estate agent, and stadium food hawker. Kaminski is best remembered as \\"The Peanut Man\\", a comedic trick-toss expert who used a variety of styles to hurl packages of peanuts to customers in the stands of the Kingdome and Safeco Field at the games of the Seattle Mariners for more than three decades. Kaminski practiced his unique art from the time of the team's entry into the ranks of Major League Baseball in 1977 until the time of his death, during which time he became one of the informal public faces of the franchise. Biography =Early years= Kaminski was born in Seattle, Washington in 1944.Susan Gilmore, \\"Rick Kaminski, Mariners' Amazing 'Peanut Man,' Dies,\\" Seattle Times, July 27, 2011. Kaminski attended King's Garden, a private Christian school in North Seattle before graduating from Seattle's Lincoln High School, Class of 1962.Joe Veyera, \\"Mariners' 'Peanut Man' Had Shoreline Connection Rick Kaminski was a King's and Shoreline Community College Student,\\" Shoreline-Lake Forest Park Patch, July 28, 2011. In high school Kaminski was a right-handed pitcher on the baseball team — an athletic assignment that would train him well for future endeavors. Kaminski was a veteran of the United States Army during the Vietnam War. Following his return from his stint in the Army, Kaminski returned to his native Seattle and enrolled at Shoreline Community College, located just north of the city. There he was elected class president in 1973. =Career= In 1977, Seattle was granted a new franchise and team by Major League Baseball to replace the departed Seattle Pilots, eight years before, who played the 1969 baseball season here before departing to become the Milwaukee Brewers. Kaminski, who was working as a printer with designs on becoming an attorney in the future, took a part-time job as a food vendor in the stands of the King County Stadium for the new franchise, the Seattle Mariners.Tyler Soper, \\"Mariners to Pay Tribute to 'The Peanut Man,'\\" MLB.com, July 28, 2011. Kaminski began his storied career as a stadium hawker selling beer — one of the more lucrative sales tasks for the commissioned vendors.Jon Wells, \\"RIP Rick Kaminski, 1944-2011: Peanut Man was 'Nuts' About His Work\\", The Grand Salami, vol. 16, no. 6 (September 2011), pp. 4-5. However, due to competing periodically in tennis tournaments, Kaminski missed a number of shifts and was demoted by the stadium concessionaire to selling lower-priced items. Selling each bag of peanuts proved time-consuming, as money was slowly passed from hand to hand, after which the product slowly made the trip in the other direction. In an effort to speed up this process, Kaminski began launching peanut bags through the air to his customers, a technique which proved to be not only faster but which entertained the crowd, boosting sales. Speeding up the process further, in later years Kaminski frequently made use of a tennis ball into which was cut a slit for the insertion of cash for the aerial completion of financial transactions. Over time Kaminski developed a repertoire of fancier and even- more-entertaining throws, made with such flair and prowess that his tosses were occasionally documented on ESPN SportsCenter's nightly highlight reels. He was known not only for his uncanny accuracy but also for a steady stream of humorous banter which he exchanged with fans.Casey McNerthney and Gerry Spratt, \\"Rick Kaminski, 'The Peanut Man,' Dies at 67: Mariners Vendor was a Longtime Fan Favorite,\\" Seattle Post-Intelligencer, July 27, 2011. Kaminski's trademark peanut toss was a behind-the-back line drive thrown for distance with velocity — with a Mariners scout clocking one such Kaminski throw at 72 miles per hour with a radar gun. Other Kaminski creations included the \\"Sky Bag\\", the \\"Curve Bag\\", the \\"Long Bomb\\", and the \\"No-Look Behind The Back.\\"Dave Walker, \\"Coming Out of His Shell: The Peanut Man Tries to Go Global,\\" Phoenix New Times, April 3, 1991. Despite his more prominent career tossing peanuts to tens of thousands of hungry fans, Kaminski worked also as a Seattle real estate broker. When asked about his need to pursue such a side gig by one Kingdome fan in the late 1980s, Rick chortled, \\"A man can't live on peanuts alone.\\"Testimony of YouTube User Madcapper6, 2008, Video comments section. =Death and legacy= Kaminski died July 26, 2011 in Seattle of a brain aneurysm.KOMO Staff, \\"Legendary Seattle Mariners Vendor 'Rick the Peanut Guy' Dies,\\" KOMO-TV (Seattle), July 27, 2011. Kaminski's career was remembered at the time of his death in a statement by Mariners president Chuck Armstrong, who recalled: The root of Kaminski's iconic status was analyzed by one Safeco denizen: Kaminski's death was marked by the team with a moment of silence prior to the playing of the national anthem at the July 29, 2011, Mariners game against the visiting Tampa Bay Rays. Following this brief memorial, Mariners vendors further paid tribute to Kaminski by hurling ceremonial bags of peanuts into the crowd. Kaminski memorabilia was displayed by the team in its baseball museum and hall of fame at Safeco Field for the duration of the 2011 campaign.

Design and development The Aéro-Torpille No.1 created great interest during the 1911 Salon de l’Aéronautique at the Grand Palais in Paris due to its novel design and streamlined appearance. Great care had been taken in the design to eliminate drag, and the design had been tested on Gustave Eiffel's wind tunnel.http://www.ctie.monash.edu.au/hargrave/tatin.html Victor Tatin The Pioneers: an Anthology retrieved 26 June 2014 The aircraft had a streamlined circular section fuselage which entirely enclosed the Gnome rotary engine, which drove a pusher configuration propeller mounted at the back of the fuselage, connected to the engine by a long driveshaft. The structure of the fuselage was a conventional square-section wire-braced wood structure, outside which were circular formers bearing a series of stringers to support the fabric covering. Initially a universal joint was fitted at the engine end of the driveshaft, but in tests the girder construction of the fuselage proved rigid enough for this not to be necessary, and the long tube forming the driveshaft was simply held by six ballraces attached to the structure by wires, to eliminate whip. The section of the fuselage containing the engine was covered by louvred aluminium panels, removable for maintenance of the engine. The wings had curved leading and trailing edges, were tapered in planform and were curved upwards at the wing tips. Flight loads were transmitted to the bottom of the fuselage by a pair of steel ribbons on either side. The rearmost of these also operated the wing warping for lateral control. The pilot sat immediately in front of the leading edge of the wing. Even the undercarriage was of novel design, consisting of a pair of semi- circular lengths of hickory, hinged at the front and attached to the fuselage by bungee cords and bearing a pair of wheels whose spokes were covered. Tail surfaces consisted of a fixed tailplane with trailing-edge elevators and a small rectangular balanced rudder.The Paulhan Aero Torpedo Flight magazine 17 February 1912 The aircraft was flown during October 1911 and in February achieved a measured speed of .Fast Flight on the Paulhan-Tatin Torpedo Flight magazine 24 February 1912 p.178 In March it was sold to the Italian aviator Signor Bosse.A Paulhan Torpedo for Italy Flight magazine 16 March 1912 Specifications  References Aero-Torpille 001 Category:Single-engined pusher aircraft Category:Rotary-engined aircraft Category:Mid-engined aircraft Category:1910s French experimental aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1911 ","title":"Paulhan-Tatin Aéro-Torpille No.1"},{"id":"33099711","text":"Iodopropynyl Butyl Carbamate (IPBC) is a water-soluble preservative used globally in the paints & coatings, wood preservatives, personal care, and cosmetics industries. IPBC is a member of the carbamate family of biocides. IPBC was invented in the 1970s and has a long history of effective use as an antifungal technology. History IPBC was initially developed for use in the paint & coatings industry as a dry-film preservative to protect interior and exterior coatings from mold, mildew, and fungal growth, while also offering cost performance and sustainability benefits. IPBC exhibits efficacy against a broad spectrum of fungal species, typically at very low use levels. IPBC today is incorporated into a wide variety of interior and exterior paint formulations around the world. Use is restricted in some countries due to its toxicity, especially acute inhalation toxicity. IPBC is also becoming recognized as a contact allergen. Uses IPBC is an effective fungicide at very low concentrations in cosmetic and other products, and has shown very low sensitivity in humans tested with this preservative. IPBC was approved in 1996 for use up to 0.1% concentrations in topical products and cosmetics. However, this preservative is mostly found in cosmetics at about one-eighth that level [Maier et al., 2009]. IPBC Toxicity and Safety Tests show it to be generally safe: When used properly in leave-on skin products, IPBC is extremely safe [Steinberg, 2002]. Previous to being approved for cosmetic use in 1996, extensive safety and toxicity tests were conducted on IPBC and their results were gathered along with earlier studies in a report of the Safety Assessment of IPBC by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review [CIR Final Report, Lanigan 1998]. This final report found IPBC to be a non-carcinogen with no genotoxicity and in reproductive and developmental toxicity studies using rats and mice, IPBC had no significant effect on fertility, reproductive performance, or on the incidence of fetal malformation [Lanigan, 1998]. Toxicity The study, \\"Final Report on the Safety Assessment of Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate\\", discusses the results of 32 studies between 1990 and 1994 in 3,582 subjects using skin application of IPBC at relevant concentrations. All 32 studies showed no evidence of contact sensitization compared to placebo controls, with the report stating \\"With each test formulation, a few panelists had erythema, edema, and/or a papular response, but overall, the results were negative.\\" In addition, the study mentions two skin sensitivity studies on 183 children ages 3 – 12 yrs which showed no adverse effects as well as no significant irritation from IPBC. Since the early safety report, there have been a few reports of human skin sensitivity to IPBC in individual patients – all of which showed complete recovery after discontinuance of use of any product containing the IPBC which was presumably an allergen for these patients [Toholka & Nixon, 2014; Pazzaglia & Tosti, 1999]. Post-1996 tests of human sensitivity to IPBC have all shown quite low sensitivity, having overall reported human skin testing (patch test) on 53,774 subjects with only 491 of those subjects showing any reaction (0.8%) to IPBC. In every study, positive patch test reactions occurred in less than 1% of subjects tested in all but one study. This is a very low reaction rate, but it is not zero, and the industry reports this low rate of reaction even though in the largest study of 25,435 subjects over 69% of the reactions were either weak or doubtful [Warshaw et al., 2013a]. These combined studies showing prevalence of reaction below 1% means that IPBC at this time does not have the reaction rates necessary to be included as an allergen in standard allergy series. But, it remains under close monitoring as it is a relatively new preservative for cosmetic products and will presumably increase in usage [Sasseville, 2004]. Most human patch tests performed before 2004 were with 0.1% IPBC solutions, i.e. 10 times the concentration used in many cosmetic products. Some used 0.5% IPBC. In 2004, it was suggested that a better concentration for tests of this substance would be 0.2% [Brasch et al., 2004] and this has contributed to the diagnosis of more sensitizations to this substance [Martin-Gorgojo & Johansen, 2013]. One study showed significantly increased sensitivity between 2005 and 2010 using 0.5% IPBC in patch tests [Warshaw et al., 2013b].

Released in 2011, it explores the tumultuous interaction between China and the European powers throughout the 19th century. Summary The documentary begins by comparing Confucianism and Christianity and how they translated in political thought, resulting in a collectivist society in China and an individualistic one in Europe. Then, the film explores why the industrial and scientific revolutions happened in not China but the West. The second part of the film, delves in the early encounters between the British Navy and the isolationist Qing Dynasty. The root causes of the two Opium Wars are explored next, exposing the greed of the western powers and the incompetence of the Chinese rulers. The film time line ends with the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894, providing a comprehensive view of the decay of the last Chinese dynasty.

Written by Jack Townley, the film is about a gang of outlaws who are destroying the timberland and who frame a singing cowboy on a cattle-poisoning charge, setting him up for murder. Plot In the North Woods, Forester Charles Carter (Jason Robards Sr.) discovers that a tussock moth infection is threatening to devastate the great woods. This threatens the plans of Henry Mitchell (Douglass Dumbrille), who holds exclusive logging rights for the forest. Mitchell figures that if the moths infest and kill the trees, he can harvest all the dead trees, unencumbered by logging restrictions. When Carter tries to phone in the infestation threat, Mitchell covertly cuts the line, forcing Carter to ride into town to report the problem. Meanwhile, along the trail, Gene Autry (Gene Autry) and Forester Joe Lucas (Jimmy Lloyd), who have been drinking, come across a mountain lion, and Gene fires several shots at the wild animal. Mitchell, who has been following the forester, uses the last shot as cover to shoot Carter in the back, leaving him where Autry will assume Carter was killed by his errant shot. At the inquest, Gene is cleared of any charges, and he is freed. He sells his interest in his forest camp, leaving the money to Carter's daughter, Helen (Patricia Barry). In grief, he decides to leave the area, but then discovers the moth infestation for himself. Reporting it to the forest service and discovering that his shot could not have killed Carter, he is hired to run a program of aerial spraying of DDT to kill the moth larva before the forest is destroyed. Gene includes his pal, Joe, in the aerial program, but Joe's problems with alcohol, triggered by the death of his wife, lead to trouble. Meanwhile, Mitchell has hatched a plot to stop the DDT spraying by covertly spraying a very potent poison over the local livestock, blaming the resulting sickness and death on the DDT. Joe, who has returned to sobriety with the help of Autry, finds the plane and poison being used by Mitchell, but is shot by one of Mitchell's henchmen, Bill Wright (Damian O'Flynn), as he rides to report the problem. Helen finds Joe and, with the help of Dr. Chadwick (Harry Cheshire), brings him back from the brink of death. When Joe recovers consciousness, he reports his findings to Gene. When he learns that Wright has aroused the locals to stop the spraying operation, Gene rides to intercept them before they can destroy the planes. He reports Wright's scheme, and convinces some of the locals to go with him to check it out. Wright has dismantled the plane, and when the locals leave, he captures Gene and Forester Jerry (Jerry Scoggins). They soon escape, however, and arrive at the airfield on time for a brawl to save the aircraft. The sheriff shows up, breaks up the fight, and confiscates everyone's weapons. With the help of Helen and Dr. Chadwick, Gene makes Mitchell and Wright believe he is holding the bullet removed from the injured Joe, and that it will be traced to Wright's confiscated rifle. Mitchell, Wright, and Pete ride to confront Autry, with Mitchell dropping off at a shack along the way to ambush Gene, should he get away. Wright confronts Gene, and after more fighting, he gets away. Pete, however, is captured and leads Gene to a trap by telling him he can find Wright at the shack where Mitchell is waiting. Later, Pete tries to cut a deal by confessing the truth. Joe realizes he will never catch up to Gene in time to save him, so he rides to the airfield to try an aerial intercept. Wright forces his way onto the plane at gunpoint to escape justice, but once in the air, Joe points out that if he is shot there is no one to fly the aircraft. Joe flies over Gene to warn him, and when that doesn't work, he selflessly crashes the plane into the shack, killing Wright, Mitchell, and himself. Gene returns to finish the spraying job, with the clear understanding that his future includes a permanent forestry job and married life with Helen.

In February 1921, the South African Railways placed a single experimental Garratt articulated steam locomotive with a Double Mogul type wheel arrangement in service. It was the first Cape gauge Garratt to enter service in South Africa.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1945). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VII - South African Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, November 1945. pp. 866-867. The Garratt solution A powerful steam locomotive is problematic on Cape gauge light-rail single-line track. Train lengths were limited on such lines because, due to restrictions on axle loading, conventional locomotives had been enlarged to the limit of their possible power. Alternative solutions would either be double-heading longer trains or rebuilding and re-aligning large parts of the lines to accommodate heavier locomotives. Either method was expensive, especially across the type of mountainous terrain that was encountered inland from all South Africa's major ports. In such conditions, the Garratt design had distinct advantages.Beyer, Peacock Garratt Locomotives Manufacturer The Class GA experimental mainline articulated locomotive was one of altogether five Garratt locomotives that had been ordered by the South African Railways (SAR) from Beyer, Peacock and Company (BP) in 1914. The rest consisted of the first of the eventual seven Class GB branchline locomotives and three narrow gauge Class locomotives. Production was disrupted by the First World War, however, and BP was only able to deliver the narrow gauge locomotives in 1919 and the Cape gauge locomotives in 1921, after cessation of hostilities. The single Class GA locomotive was numbered 1649, but the engine number was later changed to 2140. The locomotive was erected in the Durban shops and placed in service in February 1921. At the time, it was heavier than any Garratt engine constructed previously and, of all Garratts in service worldwide, the locomotive with the highest tractive effort. Characteristics The superheated Class GA had a commodious cab and had plate frames, with a copper Belpaire firebox and combustion chamber. The piston valves were actuated by Walschaerts valve gear, driven from the coupled wheels furthest from the respective cylinders and controlled by steam reversing gear which was fitted under the boiler barrel between the cradle frame plates. The bissel trucks at the extremities of the locomotive were fitted with Cartazzi axle box control to allow the axles sideways play since the truck itself did not pivot, but was compensated with the adjacent pair of coupled wheels. The locomotive had valves to allow the steam supply to either engine unit to be shut off, if necessary. Exhaust steam from the cylinders of each engine unit was led to the smokebox by separate pipes. The ball joints which gave flexibility to the steam and exhaust pipes were located immediately under and concentric with the pivot centres and were served by forced lubrication from Wakefield mechanical lubricators. Two lubricators, one on each engine unit, supplied one feed to each cylinder and each steam chest, two to the ball joints and two to the tail-end extensions of the piston rods. The oil pipes which fed the steam chests and cylinders were fitted with anti-carbonisers. The locomotive was fitted with two Gresham and Craven no. 12 self-acting feedwater injectors and had steam sanding gear, applied to the front and rear of both engine units. Comparative trials The Class GA, which had apparently been designed as a direct competitor to the Class MH 2-6-6-2 Mallet locomotive, was placed in trial service on the Natal mainline. It closely matched the Mallet in terms of tractive effort, boiler capacity, grate area and axle loading, which made it a locomotive of equal power but with less weight. Tests were carried out with varying loads on various sections of the line, while comparative tests were carried out with the Class MH Mallets. During the trials, the locomotive gave some trouble due to broken plate frames on the engine units and it was also found that the absence of trailing carrying wheels on the engine units was a disadvantage since it led to excessive flange wear on the coupled wheels. As a result, no. 2140 remained the only representative of its Class. All subsequent Garratt models of the SAR were equipped with trailing Bissel trucks. The Garratt took greater loads than the Mallet and its running times were better, while its coal and water consumption were lower. With the Garratt's superiority established, no further Mallet locomotives were ordered by the SAR. During the remaining years of the South African steam traction era, whenever the use of an articulated locomotive was desirable for flexibility, reduced axle loading and high tractive force, the Garratt type was chosen. Two derivative designs, the Modified Fairlie and Union Garratt, would be tried but would both prove to be less successful than the purebred Garratt. Service The locomotive worked across Van Reenen's Pass between Ladysmith and Harrismith for most of the rest of its service life. It was withdrawn from service in 1938 because of a cracked frame and scrapped. The boiler was retained and reconditioned as a spare boiler for Class GE locomotives.

They encounter Cadmus head of security Guardian, who is being mind-controlled by Cadmus' \\"genomorphs\\". Following a narrow escape, the three discover Project Kr, a teenage clone of Superman engineered by Cadmus and fed info by genomorphs. They are captured by Dr. Mark Desmond. Afterwards, Desmond contacts the Cadmus board of directors to ask what to do with the young heroes. They order him to clone them and kill the originals. Meanwhile, the young heroes are awoken by a disembodied voice to find themselves strapped in pods and the clone in a trance. The clone suddenly regains consciousness from the G-Gnomes' mind control. He explains that he is Superboy, a clone of Superman, created to either replace him if he were killed, or to kill him if he went rogue. Upon hearing this, they offer him a chance of freedom from Cadmus and to meet Superman himself. Before he could make his decision, he is mind controlled again into going back into his pod while the young heroes are subjected to the painful cloning process. Superboy overhears Aqualad telling him that he has the right to make his own choices and asks him: \\"What would Superman do?\\". Superboy decides to rescue them. As they make their escape, they encounter Dubbilex, who reveals he started the fire to attract the heroes and free him and the other genomorphs as well. After the G-gnomes free Guardian of their telepathy, Desmond arrives to stop the heroes, drinking a serum known as project: Blockbuster, turning him into a powerful beast. After he knocks out Guardian, the ensuring fight between blockbuster and the young heroes reaches the surface, where they finally defeat him by causing the entire building to collapse on top of him. The Justice League then arrives and meet Superboy. Superman feels uneasy around his clone, much to Superboy's disappointment, but assures him that the League will help him as they also take blockbuster to Belle Reve. Though they now have enough evidence to put Project Cadmus under full investigation, the mentors reprehend the young heroes for disobeying their orders, but they respond by asserting what they have done was important and convince the League to let them form a team. Three days later, with Project Cadmus as proof of how more organized villains are getting, Batman decides to have them work as a Covert Ops. team with Mount Justice as their headquarters. Batman will assign them on missions, Red Tornado will be their supervisor, and Black Canary will train them. Miss Martian, Martian Manhunter's niece, also joins them. Meanwhile, as Guardian is appointed as the new head of Project Cadmus, the Cadmus board of directors, known as The Light, contemplates on the young heroes destroying Cadmus and freeing Superboy. Development Young Justice is not based on the comic book series of the same name created by Todd Dezago and Todd Nauck and differs from it in some key ways. Wally West is featured as Kid Flash, rather than Bart Allen as Impulse. Dick Grayson, not Tim Drake, is also featured as Robin. The series features new versions of Aqualad and Superboy. The episode was the start of a new \\"young universe\\", in which Superman has only been around for about 10 years, the Justice League has existed for only 3–4 years, and Robin has been a sidekick the longest of the Young Justice team members. Executive producers Greg Weisman and Brandon Vietti said that their aim was to keep the show \\"young\\", \\"fresh\\", \\"contemporary\\", and \\"from scratch\\" from the first episode. Like other shows, the first episode does not show the character's origin story, which Brett Singer of The A.V. Club said was alright except in cases that involve updated versions of characters. Reception Matt of Comics Online said that the episode \\"easily lives up to the high expectations and standards that we would hope to see with any DC animated project\\". An IGN review gave the episode 7 out of 10 stars while complimenting the fights, visuals, and character interaction. R. J. Carter of The Trades said that the episode \\"sets a lot up in terms of character relationships that will provide a ton of fodder to explore in the upcoming series\\". A review on entertainment website ComicsAlliance, however, delivered a mixed verdict that highlighted large amounts of exposition and unoriginal characters as a drawback to the fledgling series, opining that \\"There was nothing in here that (isn't) done better elsewhere\\". For his work on the episode, character designer Phil Bourassa won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation in 2011.

Initially a battalion, the West Belfast Brigade emerged from the local \\"defence associations\\" active in the Shankill at the beginning of the Troubles and became the first section to be officially designated as a separate entity within the wider UDA structure. During the 1970s and 1980s the West Belfast Brigade was involved in a series of killings as well as establishing a significant presence as an outlet for racketeering. The Brigade reached the apex of its notoriety during the 1990s when Johnny Adair emerged as its leading figure. Under Adair's direction the West Belfast Brigade in general and its sub-unit \\"C Company\\" in particular became associated with a killing spree in the neighbouring Catholic nationalist districts of west Belfast. With Adair and his supporters suspicious of the developing Northern Ireland peace process and the Combined Loyalist Military Command ceasefire of 1994, the West Belfast Brigade increasingly came to operate as a rogue group within the UDA, feuding with rival loyalists in the Ulster Volunteer Force before splitting from the UDA altogether in late 2002. Ultimately Adair was forced out and the brigade was brought back into the mainstream UDA. It continues to organise, albeit with less significance than in its heyday. Matt Kincaid is the incumbent West Belfast Brigade leader and under his leadership the brigade has again become estranged from the wider UDA. Origins The Shankill Road neighbourhood of Belfast, as it appeared in the early 1970s The origins of the UDA lay in west Belfast with the formation of vigilante groups such as the Shankill Defence Association and the Woodvale Defence Association. The latter, formed by Charles Harding Smith, became the largest of a number of similar groups and was instrumental in the establishment of the UDA in September 1971, having begun military training of its members two months earlier.McDonald & Cusack, pp. 18-19 In 1972, when Jim Anderson was serving as acting chairman of the UDA, a West Belfast battalion was formed as a separate part of the UDA, such was the volume of membership within the area. The battalion was divided into three separate companies: A Company, which was based on the Highfield estate with some members in Glencairn, B Company which covered the Woodvale area, and C Company for the Shankill Road itself.Taylor, p. 103 Battalions covering the other three areas of Belfast as well as South East Antrim and North Antrim and Londonderry were formed soon afterwards and before long these were re- designated as brigades after the UDA experienced a rush of members.McDonald & Cusack, pp. 24-25 Charles Harding Smith The Battalion fell under the initial control of Davy Fogel, under whose leadership the group undertook a programme of erecting barricades between the Shankill and the neighbouring republican Falls and Springfield Roads. However the local strongman was Harding Smith, who had been held in prison on charges of gun-running in London. When he returned in early 1973 Harding Smith ran Fogel out of the area and became commander of the Battalion himself, whilst also becoming joint chairman of the UDA as a whole with Anderson.Taylor, p. 114 Harding Smith soon became embroiled in a feud with East Belfast leader Tommy Herron, whilst also facing a growing rival in his own area in the shape of Andy Tyrie, the commander of A Company. Tyrie was chosen as the overall Chairman of the UDA in 1973, with Anderson off the scene. Tyrie had initially been seen as a compromise candidate between the two real powerhouses of Harding Smith and Herron but before long he began to assert his independence. Herron was killed in late 1973 and soon after Tyrie and Harding Smith became openly hostile after Tyrie sanctioned a trip by UDA activists to Libya. Harding Smith publicly condemned the move, arguing that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was a friend of the Provisional IRA, and in January 1975 he announced the secession of the West Belfast Brigade from the UDA.McDonald & Cusack, p. 86 However, after a power struggle Harding Smith was driven out of Northern Ireland following two failed attempts on his life, according to Peter Taylor by one of Tyrie's men. The West Belfast Brigade immediately returned to the mainstream UDA fold. The west Belfast area also saw the formation in 1973 of the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) by former Harding Smith ally John White. Modelled on the Red Hand Commando, the UFF was to be an armed elite of killing units to be nominally separate from the legal UDA but actually a flag of convenience under which UDA members could kill Catholics. The model soon spread from west Belfast to the rest of the UDA.Taylor, p. 115 Tommy Lyttle UDA mural in the Lower Shankill When Harding Smith left Northern Ireland in 1975 Tommy Lyttle was chosen as his replacement as Brigadier, following a brief interlude during which John McClatchey served as leader.Steve Bruce, The Red Hand, Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 253 Under Lyttle however the West Belfast Brigade entered a period of stagnation and from being the main area of activity it fell way behind the new centres of North and South Belfast.McDonald & Cusack, p. 137 A rare foray into murder by a member of the Brigade proved somewhat disastrous during the 1977 Ulster Workers' Council strike. Kenny McClinton stopped a bus as part of a road blockade and entering the vehicle, shot and killed driver Harry Bradshaw, a Protestant.McKay, p. 79 This, along with press revelations that the UDA had written a letter of apology to his widow in which they enclosed a ten-pound note, helped to further undermine the already unpopular strike. During the 1980s James Craig, another former associate of Harding Smith, had been attached to the West Belfast Brigade as \\"fundraiser-in-chief\\", a role which saw the Brigade move increasingly towards racketeering. Craig particularly favoured protection rackets that targeted Belfast's building firms and gained a lot of money through these, both for the Brigade and for himself. Arrested in 1985 for racketeering, the case collapsed and he returned to the Shankill but was soon asked to leave because of his personal enrichment and he left to link up the John McMichael's South Belfast Brigade instead.Taylor, p. 170 According to Billy \\"Twister\\" McQuiston, a member of the West Belfast Brigade, the activities of the Brigade during the 1980s helped to make the UDA unpopular on the Shankill as they were identified with gangsterism.Taylor, p. 210 Despite this the West Belfast Brigade saw an influx of new young members in the 1980s and before long Lyttle came under pressure to give them something to do. Lyttle shared Craig's predilection for gangsterism but was less interested in murder and so turned to his intelligence officer Brian Nelson who drew up a list of leading republican targets and October 1987 Nelson dispatched a group of raw recruits to the nationalist Ballymurphy area to kill the first of these, a 66-year-old taxi driver by the name of Francisco Notorantonio. Despite appearing on the list Notorantonio had only ever been very loosely connected to the Irish Republican Army and Sinn Féin and had ended his active associations with republicanism several years earlier.McDonald & Cusack, pp. 137-138 In fact Nelson, who was the highest-ranking British intelligence agent in the UDA, had seized on Notorantonio at the last minute after being informed by his handlers that his initial first target was actually a high-ranking British agent in the Provisional Irish Republican Army known as \\"Stakeknife\\" (believed to be Freddie Scappaticci). \\"Stakeknife\\" was seen as much too important to be killed and so a last minute switch was made.McDonald & Cusack, p. 139 Nonetheless the killings continued, with C Company becoming the most active, under the command of William \\"Winkie\\" Dodds. They struck again, based on Nelson's list, on 10 May 1988 with the murder of Terence McDaid. This murder however was an error as the actual target had been his older brother Declan, whose striking physical resemblance to Terence meant that C Company had received the wrong photograph from Nelson.Lister & Jordan, pp. 61-62 Nelson also provided details on Gerard Slane, who was killed by B Company on 22 September 1988. Slane was shot dead at his Falls Road home with the UDA claiming he was a member of the Irish People's Liberation Organisation.Lister & Jordan, p. 63 The most notorious killing was that of solicitor Pat Finucane in February 1989, carried out by brigade member Ken Barrett using information provided by RUC Special Branch.Lister & Jordan, p. 78 Lyttle was arrested as part of the Stevens Inquiries and was handed a six-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to various offences. It has been suggested that the lenience of his sentence may have been influenced by Lyttle himself being a Royal Ulster Constabulary agent although this has not been confirmed.McDonald & Cusack, p. 143 The collapse of the old leadership cleared the way for younger, more militant members to take control of the Brigade and launch a new era of activity.Taylor, p. 209 Emergence of Johnny Adair Lower Shankill C Company mural. The 2nd Battalion name recalls the Brigade's origins as the second battalion of the original Belfast UDA The Stevens Inquiries led to a period of chaos within the West Belfast Brigade, with a rapid succession of brigadiers and a number of leading members spending time in prison. Lyttle's arrest in early 1990 saw him relinquish the role of Brigadier, whilst the allegations that he was an informer saw him disowned by the rest of the Brigade with four others following him before the year was out.Lister & Jordan, p. 82 Stability initially looked set when Tommy Irvine was chosen as Brigadier and he set in place a new decentralised structure in which the commanders of A, B and C companies (at the time Matt Kincaid, Jim Spence and William \\"Winkie\\" Dodds respectively) would be given a freer hand in their activities. However Irvine was arrested as part of the inquiries in August 1990 and was very briefly replaced by Ken Barrett.Wood, p. 155 Barrett was quickly ousted by Lyttle's choice, his brother-in-law Billy Kennedy but in October 1990 Jim Spence, who had also been taken into prison as part of the Stevens Inquires, assumed overall control of the Brigade. One of his first acts was to appoint an officer in overall control of the Brigade's military activities and he chose his friend Johnny Adair for this role.Lister & Jordan, pp. 96-99 Adair also replaced Dodds, who faced a longer spell in prison, as head of C Company.Lister & Jordan, p. 96 Under Adair's direction the West Belfast Brigade became notorious for its killing spree, with his leading gunman Stephen \\"Top Gun\\" McKeag in particular becoming notorious. His first killing had actually occurred before the emergence of Adair on 11 March 1990 in the Clonard district of the Falls Road.McDonald & Cusack, p. 180 Several more followed however with police estimated that McKeag committed at least 12 murders and former members of C Company putting the figure even higher.McDonald & Cusack, p. 1 =Adair in charge= A mural commemorating Stephen McKeag on Hopewell Crescent, off the Shankill Road Spence was arrested on charges of extortion in March 1993 and gave up the role of Brigadier with Johnny Adair succeeding him.Lister & Jordan, p. 149 As Brigadier, Adair continued on the same bloody path that he had followed as military commander. One victim was Noel Cardwell, a mentally sub-normal glass collector at a C Company bar, the Diamond Jubilee, who was seen as a figure of fun by Adair and his cohorts. In December 1993 Cardwell was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast after suffering a bad reaction when his drink was spiked with an ecstasy tablet by a member of C Company. Whilst in the hospital he was visited by members of the RUC who asked him who he had been drinking with. Cardwell named the UDA members he was with, having failed to grasp the code of secrecy governing the UDA. In order to send a message to informers, Adair had Cardwell abducted following his release from hospital and subjected to a long and brutal interrogation process. He was shot and left to bleed to death. C Company member Gary McMaster was later sentenced to life imprisonment for his part in the murder.Lister & Jordan, pp. 194-196 Adair and his close ally Dodds were targeted by the IRA in October 1993 when republican intelligence witnessed the two entering Frizzell's fish shop on the Shankill Road to access West Belfast Brigade headquarters in the room above. The Shankill Road bombing that followed killed nine civilians and one of the bombers but Adair and Dodds had already left by the time the bomb detonated.Lister & Jordan, p. 168 McKeag's killing spree continued under Adair's brigadiership, starting on 1 May 1993 when former IRA member Alan Lundy was killed Ardoyne.Lister & Jordan, p. 152 Sean Lavery, the son of a Sinn Féin Belfast City Councillor, was killed on 8 AugustMcDonald & Cusack, p. 244 with Marie Teresa Dowds de Mogollon killed on 30 August.Lister & Jordan, pp. 155-156 and Sean Hughes killed at his Donegall Road shop on 7 September. McKeag was tried for the latter murder but was acquitted due to lack of evidence.McDonald & Cusack, p. 2 Michael Edwards was killed in Finaghy on 3 SeptemberMcDonald & Cusack, p. 245 and Paddy Mahon on 15 October before McKeag was finally arrested in connection with the Hughes murder.Lister & Jordan, p. 156 McKeag was soon back in action and by 1994 Dodds was close to Derek Adgey, a Royal Marine who provided details of republicans to Dodds that were then used by C Company, in particular their leading gunman McKeag.Lister & Jordan, p. 121 McKeag would fall out of favour later in the decade, in part because of envy within C Company of his \\"achievements\\", and he was found dead in suspicious circumstances in September 2000.McDonald & Cusack, pp. 3-4 On 16 May 1994 around twenty leading figures in C Company were arrested as part of an RUC operation against the notorious group.Lister & Jordan, p. 214 Although a number of those arrested were released without charge, Adair was imprisoned, forcing him to vacate his role as Brigadier. His close ally Winkie Dodds was named his replacement,Lister & Jordan, p. 227 although Adair remained in control as Dodds followed the orders he sent out from prison.Lister & Jordan, p. 248 Following Adair's lead, Dodds expanded the drug-dealing empire that the West Belfast Brigade had begun to develop.Lister & Jordan, pp. 268-269 Adair also pursued a policy of linking up with the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) and following the Irish National Liberation Army's killing of LVF leader Billy Wright in December 1997, he sent McKeag out to wreak revenge, despite the UDA being on ceasefire. McKeag struck on 28 December by machine-gunning the Clifton Tavern in north Belfast, killing Edmund Trainor and injuring several others.McDonald & Cusack, p. 295-296 He followed this on 23 January 1998 by killing Liam Conway on north Belfast's Hesketh Road. The Inner Council of the UDA brought McKeag to task for this killing but he was not disciplined, despite the murder seeing the Ulster Democratic Party left out of all-party talks.McDonald & Cusack, p. 298 The West Belfast Brigade meanwhile continued to assort freely with the LVF, a splinter group of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and a bitter rival of that group, active alongside LVF members at the Drumcree conflict.McDonald & Cusack, p. 319 Under Adair the West Belfast Brigade moved closer to a feud with the UVF. Feud with UVF Jackie Coulter, a West Belfast Brigade member killed in the feud with the UVF On 19 August 2000 the West Belfast Brigade hosted a \\"Loyalist Day of Culture\\" organised by Adair on the Lower Shankill with fellow brigadiers John Gregg, Billy McFarland, Jackie McDonald and Jimbo Simpson in attendance. However early in the day clashes broke out between UDA and UVF members outside the Diamond Jubilee, a UDA bar, and later UDA members attacked the UVF stronghold Rex Bar further up the road, firing shots at the UVF men trapped inside. In response, Adair drove all UVF members and their families out of the Lower Shankill and in doing so began the feud that his fellow brigadiers had hoped to avoid.McDonald & Cusack, p. 327 Orders were sent up to A Company in Highfield by Dodds that the estate should be \\"cleansed\\" of UVF members.McDonald & Cusack, p. 330 The UVF struck back on 21 August, killing two of Adair's allies, Jackie Coulter and Bobby Mahood, on the Crumlin Road. In response C Company members burned down the headquarters of the UVF-linked Progressive Unionist Party.McDonald & Cusack, pp. 332-334 Adair was arrested on 22 August 2000 whilst he and Dodds were driving down the Shankill Road. Adair was sent back to prison for breaking terms of his parole. With command reverting to Dodds, UVF member Samuel Rockett was shot and killed at his home by C Company the following night.Lister & Jordan, Mad Dog, p. 294 The feud continued with 4 more being killed on both sides until an uneasy truce was made. Bangor's Bloomfield estate The militancy of the West Belfast Brigade, and in particular Adair, who had become a cult hero among loyalists, meant that the brigade enjoyed the loyalty of some UDA members outside its nominal geographic area. Within the North Belfast Brigade an influx of new young members found more to admire in Adair than in their own brigadier Jimbo Simpson, and affiliated to the West Belfast brigade despite not living in the area.Wood, p. 278 Further afield a group of Shankill men had relocated to areas of North Down such as Bangor and Newtownards and there had found that support amongst young loyalists for Adair was so strong that they established a new D Company for the West Belfast Brigade there.Lister & Jordan, p. 329 The area was supposed to be part of the jurisdiction of the East Belfast Brigade.McDonald & Cusack, p. 24 Adair denouement =Expulsion= The feud had been unpopular with the other brigadiers, in particular Jackie McDonald of the South Belfast Brigade, who had emerged as the most credible rival to Adair within the UDA. Adair sought to restart the UVF feud and challenge his fellow brigadiers in September 2002, when East Belfast LVF member Stephen Warnock was killed by the Red Hand Commando. Adair spread a rumour that East Belfast Brigade chief Jim Gray had actually been behind the murder and as a result Gray was shot and seriously injured when he came to the Warnock family home to commiserate soon afterwards.McDonald & Cusack, pp. 371-372 A meeting was convened of all brigadiers in an attempt to avert a crisis, but nothing came of it as Adair refused to bend. McDonald's men followed Adair and reported that he conferred with his LVF allies in Ballysillan after leaving the meeting early. On this basis McDonald secured the agreement of the other brigadiers that Adair should be expelled from the UDA, along with his spokesman John White.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 374 Adair ignored the expulsion and erected \\"West Belfast UDA - Business as Usual\\" banners on the Shankill Road.McDonald & Cusack, pp. 374-375 A coterie of figures within the West Belfast Brigade, and especially Adair's C Company stronghold, remained loyal to Adair as the West Belfast Brigade split off from the rest of the UDA. However, Adair's leadership now became characterised by extreme paranoia. Mo Courtney, who served as Adair's bodyguard, was amongst those to come under suspicion because of his friendship with the North Belfast-based Shoukri brothers, whom Adair viewed as potential rivals. Adair despatched a team to kill Courtney but his friend Donald Hodgen tipped him off and Courtney escaped the Shankill before the hit could take place. Winkie Dodds, whose role had diminished considerably after a stroke, also split from Adair around this time after his cousin William \\"Muggsy\\" Mullan had been driven from the Shankill for associating with the Shoukris and \\"Fat\\" Jackie Thompson had led a punishment squad in a brutal attack on Dodds' brother Milton \\"Doddsy\\" Dodds.Lister & Jordan, p. 323 =Escalation and exile= The feud erupted on 26 December 2002 when members of the West Belfast Brigade killed mainstream UDA member Jonathon Stewart at a party, an attack that saw Adair loyalist Roy Green killed in retaliation.McDonald & Cusack, pp. 383-386 Adair's men then struck back on 1 February 2003, killing South East Antrim Brigade leader John Gregg and his friend Rab Carson as the two returned from watching Rangers F.C..Hardline loyalist killed as UDA feud worsens Gregg's killing proved the final straw, in part because he enjoyed a stellar reputation amongst loyalists for a gun attack on Gerry Adams in the 1980s. Adair however had a lot of bad blood with Gregg, stemming from an attack on a West Belfast Brigade member in Rathcoole and the subsequent kneecapping of the attackers by Adair's men in Gregg's area.McDonald & Cusack, pp. 369-370 In December 2002, the LVF had placed a bomb under Gregg's car and soon afterwards Gregg's house and that of his ally Tommy Kirkham were attacked by West Belfast men.Lister & Jordan, pp. 323-325 Gregg retaliated with a bomb attack on Adair's house on 8 January, two days before the West Belfast Brigade chief was returned to jail.Lister & Jordan, pp. 326-327 \\"Fat\\" Jackie Thompson, who remained totally loyal to Adair, was chosen to take over as Brigadier whilst Adair was in jail. McDonald made contact with A and B Companies of the West Belfast Brigade and told them that he intended to forcibly remove Adair. They accepted McDonald's leadership and established a headquarters at the Shankill's Heather Street Social Club, where members of C Company were invited in order to defect back to the mainstream UDA. Several members did so, with Mo Courtney amongst the most prominent of those to accept the invitation.McDonald & Cusack, pp. 383-384 Around 100 of McDonald's men, all heavily armed, launched an invasion of Adair's Lower Shankill stronghold in the early hours of the morning of 6 February and attacked the twenty or so members of C Company who remained loyal to Adair (who was still in prison), driving them out of Northern Ireland.McDonald & Cusack, p. 386 As a result of this, the West Belfast Brigade was brought back into the UDA. Post-Adair In the immediate aftermath of Adair's removal, and with Thompson one of those to have been driven out of Northern Ireland, Mo Courtney was officially confirmed in the role of brigadier.Lister & Jordan, p. 335 He proved a transitory figure however, as a result of the murder of Adair supporter Alan McCullough. McCullough had asked Courtney if he could return from exile in Bolton and promised to tell the new brigadier the location of a large drugs stash and the home address of Gina Adair in return for his safety. Courtney agreed but when McCullough returned home he was taken by UDA members to Mallusk near Templepatrick and killed on 28 May 2003.McDonald & Cusack, p. 393 The killing was hugely unpopular due to the double-crossing nature of the attack and Courtney went into hiding in Carrickfergus for fear of retaliation. He was charged with the murder, along with Ihab Shoukri, a few days later.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 394 He was acquitted by a Diplock court after the evidence was adjudged flawed,Loyalist cleared on murder charge although a retrial was later ordered and he was ultimately given an eight-year jail sentence after pleading guilty to manslaughter.Top loyalist given eight years from bbc.co.uk Jim Spence, who had conspired with McDonald to bring about Adair's downfall, replaced Courtney as Brigadier following his arrest.Wood, p. 304 Adair, who was mooting a comeback from prison, attacked Spence constantly in the press for his perceived treachery, although ultimately Adair left Belfast following his 2005 release.Wood, p. 305 Seen as something of an undesirable by others in the UDA, Spence was removed as Brigadier in 2006 in favour of Matt Kincaid.\\"Expulsions are two-fingers to mainstream UDA\\", Sunday Life, 30 July 2006 As of 2015, Kincaid remains in charge of the now much less influential West Belfast Brigade. 2013 North Belfast Brigade feud In 2013, it was reported in the Belfast Telegraph that the leadership of the West Belfast Brigade was once again at loggerheads with the rest of the organisation. According to the report, the West Belfast Brigade had become so associated with criminality and racketeering that the three other Belfast- based brigadiers, Jackie McDonald (South Belfast), Jimmy Birch (East Belfast) and John Bunting (North Belfast), no longer felt able to deal with the western leadership. Tensions had been further stoked by a graffiti campaign against Bunting's leadership on the York Road, in which expelled members of the North Belfast Brigade who had come under the wing of their counterparts in the west called for Bunting's removal as brigadier.UDA finished, says loyalist paramilitary terror group leader The feud was confirmed in December 2013 when a UDA statement was released acknowledging the existence of a dissident tendency within the North Belfast Brigade but confirming support for Bunting's leadership. However, whilst the statement was signed by McDonald and Birch, no representative of the West Belfast Brigade had added their signature.As UDA confirms major split, a dangerous tussle for power is now brewing The north Belfast rebels subsequently named Robert Molyneaux, a convicted killer and former friend of Bunting's closest ally John Howcroft, as their preferred choice for Brigadier.UDA feud escalates over bid to oust north Belfast 'brigadier' John Bunting Although the feud soon died down, a series of low level tit-for-tat incidents continued, culminating in Howcroft's partner's car being burnt out in August 2014.Loyalist John Howcroft 'attacked for 120th time' In September 2014 it was reported in the Belfast Telegraph that the leaders of the UDA in North, East and South Belfast, as well as the head of the Londonderry and North Antrim Brigade had met to discuss the feud as well as the schism with the West Belfast Brigade.

The MVAC became defunct with the end of Italian rule. The battle followed the Partisan victory at Battle of Grčarice. Partisans encircled Turjak on 14 September, and laid siege to the castle as the defenders refused to surrender. The siege ended on 19 September with a Partisan victory, much thanks to heavy weapons that they had acquired from Italian forces. The Partisans captured a reported 1,200 prisoners of war from Grčarice, Zapotok and Turjak. Although Partisan data listed 115 sentenced to death, and noted that some were killed while fleeing, estimations of victims are higher. Slovene anti-communist authors claim up to 1,000 killed.

Note that the hinge loss penalizes predictions , corresponding to the notion of a margin in a support vector machine. In machine learning, the hinge loss is a loss function used for training classifiers. The hinge loss is used for \\"maximum-margin\\" classification, most notably for support vector machines (SVMs). For an intended output and a classifier score , the hinge loss of the prediction is defined as :\\\\ell(y) = \\\\max(0, 1-t \\\\cdot y) Note that y should be the \\"raw\\" output of the classifier's decision function, not the predicted class label. For instance, in linear SVMs, y = \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x} + b, where (\\\\mathbf{w},b) are the parameters of the hyperplane and \\\\mathbf{x} is the input variable(s). When and have the same sign (meaning predicts the right class) and y \\\\ge 1, the hinge loss \\\\ell(y) = 0. When they have opposite signs, \\\\ell(y) increases linearly with , and similarly if y < 1, even if it has the same sign (correct prediction, but not by enough margin). Extensions While binary SVMs are commonly extended to multiclass classification in a one-vs.-all or one-vs.-one fashion, it is also possible to extend the hinge loss itself for such an end. Several different variations of multiclass hinge loss have been proposed. For example, Crammer and Singer defined it for a linear classifier as :\\\\ell(y) = \\\\max(0, 1 + \\\\max_{y e t} \\\\mathbf{w}_y \\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\mathbf{w}_t \\\\mathbf{x}) Where t the target label, \\\\mathbf{w}_t and \\\\mathbf{w}_y the model parameters. Weston and Watkins provided a similar definition, but with a sum rather than a max: :\\\\ell(y) = \\\\sum_{y e t} \\\\max(0, 1 + \\\\mathbf{w}_y \\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\mathbf{w}_t \\\\mathbf{x}) In structured prediction, the hinge loss can be further extended to structured output spaces. Structured SVMs with margin rescaling use the following variant, where denotes the SVM's parameters, the SVM's predictions, the joint feature function, and the Hamming loss: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\ell(\\\\mathbf{y}) & = \\\\max(0, \\\\Delta(\\\\mathbf{y}, \\\\mathbf{t}) + \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{w}, \\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) \\\\rangle - \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{w}, \\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{t}) \\\\rangle) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\max(0, \\\\max_{y \\\\in \\\\mathcal{Y}} \\\\left( \\\\Delta(\\\\mathbf{y}, \\\\mathbf{t}) + \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{w}, \\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) \\\\rangle \\\\right) - \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{w}, \\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{t}) \\\\rangle) \\\\end{align} Optimization The hinge loss is a convex function, so many of the usual convex optimizers used in machine learning can work with it. It is not differentiable, but has a subgradient with respect to model parameters of a linear SVM with score function y = \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x} that is given by :\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\ell}{\\\\partial w_i} = \\\\begin{cases} -t \\\\cdot x_i & \\\\text{if } t \\\\cdot y < 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} Plot of three variants of the hinge loss as a function of : the \\"ordinary\\" variant (blue), its square (green), and the piece-wise smooth version by Rennie and Srebro (red). However, since the derivative of the hinge loss at ty = 1 is undefined, smoothed versions may be preferred for optimization, such as Rennie and Srebro's :\\\\ell(y) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{1}{2} - ty & \\\\text{if} ~~ ty \\\\le 0, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1}{2} (1 - ty)^2 & \\\\text{if} ~~ 0 < ty < 1, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{if} ~~ 1 \\\\le ty \\\\end{cases} or the quadratically smoothed :\\\\ell_\\\\gamma(y) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\gamma} \\\\max(0, 1 - ty)^2 & \\\\text{if} ~~ ty \\\\ge 1 - \\\\gamma \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 - \\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{2} - ty & \\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} suggested by Zhang.

The Wehrmacht occupied the Netherlands since May 1940; it had conquered the country during the Westfeldzug. Both sides together had casualties of over 1000 men (dead, missing, wounded, war captivity). Commander of the 1st British Corps was General John Crocker. He thought this German bridgehead should be overwhelmed at any price. The last part of this battle was Operation Elephant, the codename of an Allied operation against paratroopers holding a ferry crossing at Kapelsche Veer, Maas River, Netherlands by the Lincoln and Welland Regiment, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada and the South Alberta Regiment tanks (elements of the 4th Canadian Armoured Division). The small ferry slip was heavily defended and 300 casualties suffered before winning. The 'Official Summary of the Canadian Army' writes (p. 244f.): \\"During the last days of this threat on the Maas there began one of the strangest episodes of the campaign. In a heavily waterlogged area north-east of Breda a subsidiary channel of the Maas forms along the river's south shore a long island, in the midst of which is a ferry crossing and harbour called Kapelsche Veer. [The German General] Student, desiring as he has since explained to give training and battle inoculation to his young paratroopers, established on this desolate spot a tiny bridgehead in our territory, which he maintained by relieving the troops in it with a new company every three or four days. The Germans dug themselves in with remarkable thoroughness, and eliminating this foothold was a long, cold and costly business, involving attacking across open and snow-covered ground in the face of a determined enemy. The Poles tried it in the last days of December and again on 7 January 1945, both times without success. The 47th Royal Marine Commando, under Polish command, attacked the place on 13 and 14 January (Operation HORSE) with no better result. Finally the 4th Canadian Armoured Division mounted a very considerable attack (Operation ELEPHANT) against the position with ample artillery support and tanks; but there were five icy days of thoroughly nasty fighting--the phrase of the 10th Brigade's historian is \\"sheer misery\\"--before it was reported on 31 January that all enemy south of the Maas had been liquidated. The brunt was borne by the Lincoln and Welland Regiment, assisted by the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and South Alberta Regiment tanks. The Germans had lost 145 killed, 64 wounded and 34 prisoners. The tough young paratroopers had received in the end a rather more severe lesson in thé art of war than Student had intended. This was the finale of the \\"static\\" period of winter warfare. The Watch on the Maas had involved few operations on such a scale. It had however meant unremitting vigilance, constant patrolling (including many incursions across the river into enemy country) and frequent raids: all under the most wretched conditions of ground and weather. Now major operations under equally difficult circumstances were impending. Rundstedt's Ardennes thrust had been broken and his armoured reserves decimated, but the Germans showed no sign of withdrawing beyond the Rhine. With the 30th Corps again becoming available, active preparations for the offensive between Mass and Rhine were resumed; and on 8 February 1945 began the series of battles which was to produce in three months' time the total downfall of the Third Reich.\\"The Battle of the Scheldt and the Winter on the Maas  References  * The Battle of the Scheldt and the Winter on the Maas - Official Summary of the Canadian Army * Article about a Canadian Soldier who took part in that battle * http://bbs.keyhole.com * canadiansoldiers.com article  Sources  Kapelsche Veer Category:Conflicts in 1945 ","title":"Battle for the Kapelsche Veer"},{"id":"33100348","text":"is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoshinobu Yamada.

The hull and boxy superstructure are moulded from GRP, with large windows. The road chassis is a T-shaped steel backbone, inside the hull. The two wheels are carried on independent suspension units bolted through the hull to the crossmember. Towing is with a caravan-like towbar, hinged and bolted through the front of the hull.

The evil Dr. Krupp (Luis Aceves Castañeda) escapes from the police with the aid of his gang, and once again tries to get possession of the Aztec princess Xochitl's gold breastplate and bracelet by hypnotizing her current reincarnation, Flor Sepulveda, to get her to reveal the location of Xochitl's tomb. Confusion reigns as Krupp and his thugs are opposed by Flor's fiancé Dr. Almada, his mild-mannered assistant Pinacate, and a mysterious masked superhero called the Angel. It turns out their bookish friend Pinacate has been the man behind the Angel's mask. Dr. Krupp kidnaps Flor, Dr. Almada and the Angel, and tries to force Almada to translate the hieroglyphics on the breastplate which will reveal the secret location of the Aztec treasure. He finally meets his match, however, when Popoca, the warrior mummy who guards Xochitl's tomb, bursts into the mad doctor's lab, kills his thugs and throws the screaming Dr. Krupp into a pit filled with live snakes.

The supergroup formed in 1977 and was partly modeled after Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and, to a lesser extent, the Eagles. They were reasonably successful commercially in the United States, with their debut album reaching number 39 on the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart and the single \\"Don't You Write Her Off\\" reaching number 33 on the Billboard Hot 100. Clark left the band in late 1979, due to his increasing drug abuse and deteriorating mental state, and therefore only participated in the recording of two albums with the group. A third album was released in late 1980 and credited to McGuinn & Hillman alone, after which the duo split up in early 1981. Background The Byrds had formed in 1964, with lead guitarist Roger McGuinn, bassist Chris Hillman, and principal songwriter Gene Clark all being founding members. The band pioneered the musical genre of folk rock with their cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", which became a transatlantic number 1 hit single in 1965. The song was the first folk rock smash hit and ushered in a period of tremendous commercial success for the band. The albums Mr. Tambourine Man and Turn! Turn! Turn! followed, along with the hit singles \\"All I Really Want to Do\\" and \\"Turn! Turn! Turn!\\" (the latter of which reached the number 1 position in the U.S. charts). In early 1966, Clark left the Byrds due to problems associated with anxiety, his increasing isolation within the band, and his fear of flying, which made it difficult for him to keep up with the band's itinerary. There was also resentment from the other band members that Clark's songwriting income had made him the wealthiest member of the group. Following Clark's departure, the Byrds helped to pioneer the musical sub- genres of psychedelic rock and country rock, although their popularity began to wane with mainstream pop audiences. Nevertheless, they were considered by many critics to be forefathers of the late 1960s rock underground. The Byrds underwent many personnel changes in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with Hillman leaving the band in late 1968 and McGuinn remaining the only constant member of the group. The band finally dissolved in mid-1973, following a reunion of the original line-up. Between 1973 and 1977, McGuinn established his own solo career, releasing a number of solo albums and participating in Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue. Hillman had been a member of the Flying Burrito Brothers and Manassas after leaving the Byrds the first time; following the 1973 reunion, he became a member of the Souther–Hillman–Furay Band and released the solo albums Slippin' Away (1976) and Clear Sailin' (1977). Clark had embarked on a critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful solo career after leaving the Byrds in 1966, and after the 1973 reunion he released the albums No Other (1974) and Two Sides to Every Story (1977), which were again met with enthusiastic reviews, but low sales. Live performances (1977) In March 1977, a twenty-one date European tour was announced in which Clark, Hillman, and McGuinn would all go out together and perform as solo artists. Although speculation in the press was rife from the start about a possible on-stage reunion of the three ex-Byrds, the publicity for the tour made it clear that each artist would be fronting their own bands and not sharing the stage with the others. However, in reality, all three musicians had signed a contract with the tour promoter which stated that an on-stage mini-Byrds reunion was required at the close of each show, although this was ignored for all but one of the performances. The tour, which began in Dublin on April 27, 1977, featured Clark backed by his KC Southern Band, Hillman fronting the Chris Hillman Band, and McGuinn playing with his touring group Thunderbyrd. From the beginning the tour was dogged with sound and logistical problems, and a show on April 29th in Birmingham, England had to be cancelled due to the musicians being unable to appear as a result of customs difficulties. In addition, relations were frosty between the three headline musicians, with the ex-Byrds barely speaking to each other backstage. On April 30th, during the first of two sold-out nights at London's Hammersmith Odeon, the much speculated upon reunion occurred when McGuinn invited Clark and Hillman onto the stage to perform the Byrds' songs \\"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\\", \\"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better\\", \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", and \\"Eight Miles High\\". The BBC recorded both of the Hammersmith Odeon concerts and broadcast an hour's worth of highlights almost a year later on April 8, 1978, as part of their In Concert program. In 1997, a double CD compilation of tracks from the two nights was released by Strange Fruit Records as 3 Byrds Land in London. The on-stage reunion failed to take place at the second London show and was also absent from the next two gigs in Manchester and Leeds. The day after the Leeds show, Hillman unexpectedly quit the tour, citing breaches of contract by the tour agency Cream International Artists. Although McGuinn and Clark completed one further concert together in Glasgow, Scotland, the tour was cancelled. The reaction of the press to the tour was mixed; some UK publications covered the shows with double-page spreads, while other publications were critical of both the quality of the performances and the solo material that the three ex-Byrds chose to perform. The Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan has remarked on a general sense of ambivalence towards the three musicians in the UK press coverage, due to most critics being more interested in the punk bands that had appeared on the British music scene in 1977. Becoming a trio (1977–1978) Despite the European tour's backstage politics and eventual cancellation, the shows served to rekindled the three musicians' desire to work together again. Upon returning to the United States, arrangements were made for McGuinn and Clark to tour together as an acoustic duo in October 1977. The songs that the duo chose to perform on the tour included material from their respective solo careers, a smattering of Dylan covers, and such Byrds' hits as \\"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\\", \\"Chestnut Mare\\", and \\"Eight Miles High\\". As the McGuinn and Clark tour continued from October into November, arrangements were made to add Hillman to the line-up by the end of the year and form a permanent trio named McGuinn, Clark & Hillman (styled, according to McGuinn, after Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and the Eagles). Rogan has speculated that this decision was motivated by the lack of commercial success that the three musicians' recent solo work had achieved and the realization that their market standing would be greatly improved by working together. On December 7, 1977, ex-Byrd David Crosby joined McGuinn and Clark on stage at San Francisco's Bording House for a set of Byrds' hits. By the start of 1978, Hillman had become a full member of the trio and the three ex-Byrds, playing acoustic guitars, appeared as the opening act on the Canadian leg of Eric Clapton's Slowhand tour. On February 2, 1978, the trio were again joined on stage at the Bording House by Crosby for a set of that was recorded and subsequently bootlegged as the album Doin' Alright for Old People. The media picked up on Crosby's appearance with the trio and although rumours of a full Byrds reunion were rife in the music press, it ultimately came to nothing; McGuinn, Clark & Hillman had no interest in reforming the Byrds and actually wanted to distance themselves from their former band, despite the presence of Byrds' material in their live repertoire. More McGuinn, Clark & Hillman gigs followed and, in June, they embarked on an extensive tour of Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. News of the ex-Byrds' activities prompted a number of overtures from record companies, including Asylum, Arista, and the Byrds' former label Columbia Records. Eventually the trio signed a six-album deal with Capitol Records and set about recording their debut release. Studio recording (1978–1980) McGuinn, Clark & Hillman entered Criteria Studios in Miami in November 1978 with producers Ron and Howard Albert to begin work on their first album. The appointment of the Albert Brothers, who had engineered Stephen Stills' Manassas album and produced Crosby, Still & Nash's 1977 record CSN, was insisted upon by Capitol in order to ensure that the album had a slick, contemporary sound. As such, the decision was taken to steer away from the signature Byrds' sound of McGuinn's jangly twelve-string Rickenbacker guitar, and instead focus on a disco-influenced late 1970s pop sound. Nonetheless, author John Einarson has remarked that the Byrds' renowned harmonies were still very much in evidence, although critic William Ruhlmann has pointed out that they were augmented in the studio by the voices of session vocalists Johnne Sambataro and Rhodes, Chalmers & Rhodes. According to Rogan, the relationship between the three musicians once again became strained while they were recording, with the trio finding that they had little in common as friends anymore and, as a result, they regarded the band as a business partnership or marriage of convenience. The self-titled McGuinn, Clark & Hillman album was issued by Capitol Records in February 1979 and climbed to number 39 on the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart—which was a higher chart placing than any of the principal members' solo albums had achieved. The first single taken from the album was McGuinn's \\"Don't You Write Her Off\\", which reached number 33 on the Billboard Hot 100 in March 1979. Two further singles were taken from the album: the Rick Vito- penned \\"Surrender to Me\\" and Clark's \\"Backstage Pass\\", but neither song managed to chart. Contemporary reviews for the McGuinn, Clark & Hillman album were generally negative, with critic Nick Kent deriding it in the NME as \\"groan[ing] under the weight of its own tedium\\", and labelling the three ex- Byrds as \\"over the hill\\". In a later review of the album for the AllMusic website, Ruhlmann cited the lack of McGuinn's involvement in the album's songwriting as chief among its shortcomings, before concluding that it had an appealing sound, but lacked substance. David Greenberger of No Depression magazine described McGuinn, Clark & Hillman as \\"an album of consummate craftsmanship\\" and \\"a product of its times\\", but conceded that the sound of the album was \\"the result of three artists struggling to remain relevant in a changing marketplace\\". The album was supported by an extensive international tour, the European leg of which was decidedly more successful than the trio's truncated 1977 trip. However, Clark's health began to deteriorate and he was forced to withdraw from some live performances. Although the official reason for Clark's absence from certain shows was reported as being an abscessed tooth, in reality his alcohol and cocaine abuse had grown so bad on tour that he was often either physically unable to perform or simply didn't turn up for the evening's concert. Infuriated by his colleague's behaviour, Hillman decided that he could no longer work with Clark, and the tour limped to a close in late 1979, with McGuinn and Hillman soldiering on alone. Clark's position in the group was still uncertain when he and his bandmates booked into Criteria Studios again in November 1979 to record their second album. As a result, Clark's contributions to the sessions were limited, with the songwriter only participating in the recording of his own two songs. The friction between McGuinn and Hillman on one side and Clark on the other, which had begun during the band's last tour, intensified in the studio. Clark, feeling paranoid and disillusioned, embarked on a drug-fuelled binge that resulted in erratic behaviour in the studio and, ultimately, his leaving the group. In addition to Clark's unpredictable behaviour, the sessions for the band's second album also saw McGuinn and Hillman in conflict with the Albert Brothers. The producers envisaged another album of ornately recorded contemporary pop, but the duo wanted a sound that was more reflective of their live performances and attempted to exert more creative control, which generated tension between the two parties. The City album was rush released in January 1980 and credited to Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman, featuring Gene Clark. It reached number 136 on the Billboard album charts, but the reaction of the music press was again mostly negative. Two singles, \\"One More Chance\\" and \\"City\\", were released from the album, but neither of them managed to reach the charts. In the end, the sound of the album was mostly reflective of the more rock 'n' roll, Rickenbacker-driven sound that McGuinn and Hillman wanted—particularly on the title track, which critic Barry Ballard has described as having a guitar break reminiscent of the Byrds' \\"Eight Miles High\\". Writing for the AllMusic website, critic Bruce Eder called the album, \\"pleasant late-'70s Byrds-influenced rock\\", while Rogan described it as an album that \\"embraced the Rickenbacker chime and was a far better representation of the group's live sound\\". Rogan also remarked that the record's title was fitting, since four of the album's ten tracks had an underlying urban theme in their lyrics. Although now reduced to a duo, City had been successful enough to justify a third album release with Capitol. McGuinn and Hillman were assigned to the renowned R&B; producers Jerry Wexler and Barry Beckett, in the hope that they would be able to provide a fluke hit for the pair. The producers fashioned a sound that Eder has described as \\"more soulful and harder-edged\\" than the duo's previous output, but neither McGuinn or Hillman were happy with the results. They had intended to record a concept album on the theme of entertainment and had written twelve songs with that concept in mind; they were dismayed when Wexler and Beckett rejected all but three of their compositions in favor of material from outside writers. The McGuinn/Hillman album was released in September 1980 to poor reviews and low sales. In spite of Capitol's desire for Wexler and Beckett-produced hits, the two singles that were taken from the album (\\"Turn Your Radio On\\" and \\"King for a Night\\") were both McGuinn/Hillman compositions and both failed to reach the Billboard Hot 100. Rogan has described the album as a \\"lacklustre swansong\\" that sounded \\"like a tired and uninspired contract filler\\". Breakup and aftermath (1981) Following the release of McGuinn/Hillman, the duo continued to play low-key gigs together for a while, sometimes backed by drummer Tom Mooney and pedal steel player Sneaky Pete Kleinow (the latter of whom was an ex-bandmate of Hillman's from the Flying Burrito Brothers). Disaster stuck in February 1981, when Hillman physically assaulted a Capitol Records' executive backstage at a show at The Bottom Line in New York City, resulting in McGuinn & Hillman being dropped by the label. Although Hillman may have felt there was some justification for his actions—since the executive had suggested that McGuinn should break up the duo and go out on his own again—the display of violence appalled McGuinn and he decided to terminate the duo, vowing to never work with Hillman again. After the break up, McGuinn spent almost a decade playing solo acoustic shows before releasing his comeback album Back from Rio in 1991. Hillman returned to the bluegrass and country music of his early musical career, joining a gospel/Christian-themed supergroup with friends and former bandmates Bernie Leadon, Jerry Scheff, Al Perkins and David Mansfield, with whom he released the albums Down Home Praise (1983) and Ever Call Ready (1985). In 1985, he formed the Desert Rose Band as a vehicle for his own country rock songs to great commercial success. Gene Clark moved to Hawaii in an attempt to overcome his drug dependency and remained there until the end of 1981. In 1984 he released the Firebyrd album, but it received scant attention from critics or record buyers. He subsequently recorded So Rebellious a Lover (1987) with Carla Olson of the roots rock band the Textones, which was critically well-received and became a modest commercial success (it was, in fact, the biggest-selling album of Clark's solo career). In spite of McGuinn's vow to never work with Hillman again, the pair came together once more (along with David Crosby) to perform a series of reunion concerts as the Byrds in January 1989. The trio also recorded four new Byrds songs in August 1990 for inclusion on The Byrds box set. On January 16, 1991, Clark joined McGuinn, Hillman, Crosby, and Michael Clarke on stage at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City for the Byrds' induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Clark died on May 24, 1991, at the age of 46, from heart failure brought on by a bleeding stomach ulcer, although years of alcohol and drug abuse, as well as a heavy cigarette habit were also contributing factors. As of 20, McGuinn and Hillman remain musically active.

It is the sequel to the game Overblood, released on the same platform. The game was published in Japan by Riverhillsoft on July 23, 1998, while a European version saw release from Evolution games on April 13, 2001. The plot takes place in 2115, and revolves around a team of freedom fighters in a war against a corrupt corporation that plans on escaping to another planet and leaving all life on Earth for dead. Gameplay The game features an introduction and seven episodes, plus a hidden bonus episode unlocked by earning 2000 Clear Points. Between most of the episodes, which are all set in different locations, the player generally has the option to explore the main city where the game begins in order to buy items, weapons, talk to non player characters and find hidden perks in the game. A free-camera view allows the player to control their view within the 3D environment. Plot The game follows protagonist Acarno Brani, an ambitious twenty-four year old Junk Blade pilot, arriving at East Edge City Airport after relocating from Greyland. Acarno and Curtis have a brief chat in the airport terminal before Curtis leaves for the door, as Curtis is leaving Acarno has a premonition of Curtis being attacked. Curtis is then ambushed by a powerful, mutating villain called Kondo. After throwing a mysterious capsule across the floor in Acarno's direction, Curtis is taken by Kondo. This is the first point at which the player encounters combat, armed only with a sword, and must swiftly exit the airport after avoiding people trying to shoot at him. Acarno jumps out of the airport window, falling hundreds of feet into the sea. After climbing out of the water, Acarno is given the choice to examine the capsule. Upon doing so he hears the name \\"D-NA\\" between a lot of static, before the message being played cuts out. The game then turns into a free roam game, giving the player the ability to travel throughout East Edge City. Eventually Acarno will come across a bar named \\"D-NA\\", and inquire with the bartender, Raz Karcy (the main character from the first OverBlood game), who begins telling him about the passenger who gave him the capsule which led him to the bar. Raz informs Acarno about a conspiracy involving the project being worked on by Hayano Industries. With time being of the essence, Raz offers Acarno 50,000 credits towards the entrance fee to enter the local Junk Blade race in exchange for helping with his plan to uncover the secret of the project. Meanwhile, Kondo reports to his boss, Hayano, about the failure to retrieve the capsule and the interference of Acarno, who Kondo believes is a spy. Acarno travels to Billboard Island to recruit Navarro Jean, an old colleague of Raz and acquire a map of Hayano's Pagoda. Meanwhile, Raz is confronted by Chris Lanebecca. Acarno fights and solves puzzles to get through the Billboard Island Facility, eventually going up against a large security robot. Acarno destroys the robot, but is then tased by a robot of the same model as Pipo, a companion from the first game. Navarro Jean interrogates Acarno about his motives, but the interrogation is cut short when the ITP ambushes Billboard Island on Hayano's orders. Acarno is freed in the hectic scramble, and mans a turret to fend off the attack. Acarno, Chris, and Navarro infiltrate the perimeter, check in with each other before going radio silent, then launch the attack. The Pagoda is filled with enemies, puzzles, and traps, and the trio must fight their way through the Pagoda to the three respective guardians, a crab-like robot, a frog-like robot, and a squid-like robot. The player decides who uses which entrance, and thus who fights which guardian. The trio then break into the mainframe. Navarro hacks the main terminal of ZEUS while Chris and Acarno keep lookout. The computer reveals that the secret government project is codenamed: Meridian. The KPACS only has approximately ten years before the energy is depleted, so Project: Meridian was designed as an immigration ship that uses KPACS energy to ferry the Earth's elite to a colony world with fresh resources, but can only hold 20,000 people. The team ponders why Raz and Veltor would be needed for the project before deciding to escape first, and figure out the details later. As they are headed for the door Acarno remembers that Nina said she was in the Pagoda. Acarno runs back into the central room and tries to knock down the door to a restricted safe-room while calling out Nina's name as Chris and Navarro try to stop him. This triggers the alarm and Kondo is dispatched to kill the invaders. As Acarno admits defeat and leaves with the other two all three are knocked to the ground by a shockwave as Kondo appears. As the intruders recover from the blast Chris and Acarno recognize Kondo. Acarno says he can take Kondo on his own and rushes in to fight. Acarno is badly beaten however, and just as Kondo moves in for the killing strike Kondo is paralyzed by a lightning bolt and Nina appears. Acarno is stunned to see Nina there, and Nina apologizes for making Acarno get involved, and almost getting him killed, she then mentions the search to find the Parallax Key, then disappears before Acarno can ask what she means. When Kondo wakes up Acarno demands to know where his sister is. Kondo explains that Nina was abducted because of her supernatural powers, and was experimented on in an attempt to clone the gene that gave her those powers. The experiment lead to Nina's death which is why she appears the same age as when she was taken, and that the Nina Acarno was talking to is an A.I. simulation. Acarno flies into a fit of rage and begins channeling a field of energy. He fights Kondo again, this time brutally beating Kondo. As Kondo calls for backup Hayano orders him to release the intruders. Kondo begrudgingly obeys. In the elevator to the lobby the gang discuss Acarno's ability to harness Xeno-Rays, which is a power only one in five-million have. Chris says that they have to do something about the KPACS reserves running out before the ten-year deadline. Navarro explains that the Meridian launch is going to exhaust the reserves of energy keeping KPACS operational, killing all life on Earth, meaning they have only weeks to come up with a plan. Meanwhile, Hayano is alone in his office planning on how to counter the next attack by the rebels, and what to do about Acarno and his special power. Development Mark Estdale, an industry veteran, looked back on his work on the localization of the game in an interview with GameCulture. He stated, \\"I read the script. It was awful, translated to English from Japanese by Italians so I suggested rewriting the English to match the stylized Japanese, or making it into an acted comedy or to scrap the whole thing. I was told the script was perfect and couldn’t be changed and that we must do it with seriousness. We squirmed and the actors wept. When the game finally came out we discovered amongst many painfully awful mistranslations that the hand bomb throwing device was a grenade launcher and the whorehouse key level was actually a warehouse.\\"Staff. \\"GameCulture Goes Inside the Voice Actor's Studio.\\" GameCulture. 23 March 2010. Reproduced at utterbrilliance.com (26 August 2011). The director of the game was Akihiro Hino, who previously worked as a programmer on the first game. He would later become the CEO of developer Level-5, which he founded just a few months after the release of the game. He would later reflect back on his experience developing the series, stating, \\"On Overblood 1, I was programming all by myself. On Overblood2, I was directing, planning and writing scenarios. Those were some of my most hardworking days. That’s the way I liked it, but I really couldn’t sleep then.\\" Hilliard, Kyle (November 14, 2015) Game Informer. Reception In an import review of the game, GameSpot criticized the excessively long cutscenes, along with the slow performance of the game engine. The Overblood series was the subject of the online video blog series Super Replay by the editors of Game Informer magazine. During the Super Replay, the editors criticized the lack of the ability to skip cutscenes, the convoluted storyline and the general lack of direction. They occasionally praised it for its ambition. OPM UK criticized the game as a \\"pale imitation of Final Fantasy VII with its heart ripped out\\" and gave it a score of 4 out of 10.

Taxonomy Skull of a mummified specimen of C. suchus, 1870s The species was named by Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1807, who discovered differences between the skulls of a mummified crocodile and those of Nile crocodile (C. niloticus). This new species was, however, for a long time afterwards regarded as a synonym of the Nile crocodile. In 2003, a study indicated that C. suchus was a valid species, and this was confirmed by several other studies in 2011–2015.Nile crocodile is two species, Nature.com Despite the long history of confusion, genetic testing has revealed that the two are not particularly close. The closest relatives of the Nile crocodile are the Crocodylus species from the Americas, while the West African crocodile is basal to the clade of Nile and American crocodiles. Distribution and habitat The West African crocodile inhabits much of West and Central Africa, ranging east to South Sudan and Uganda, and south to Democratic Republic of the Congo (in all three countries it may come into contact with Nile crocodiles). Other countries where found include Mauritania, Benin, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon, Chad, Sierra Leone, Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Senegal, Mali, Guinea, Gambia, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Gabon, Togo, Ivory Coast and Republic of Congo. As late as the 1920s, museums continued to obtain West African crocodile specimens from the southern Nile, but today the species has disappeared from this river. In Mauritania it has adapted to the arid desert environment of the Sahara–Sahel by staying in caves or burrows in a state of aestivation during the driest periods, leading to the alternative common name desert crocodile. When it rains, these desert crocodiles gather at gueltas. In much of its range, the West African crocodile may come into contact with other crocodile species and there appears to be a level of habitat segregation between them. The Nile crocodile typically prefers large seasonal rivers in savannah or grassland, while the West African crocodile generally prefers lagoons and wetlands in forested regions, at least where the two species may come into contact. The details of this probable segregations remains to be confirmed for certain. In a study of habitat use by the three crocodile species in Liberia (West African, slender-snouted and dwarf), it was found that the West African crocodile typically occupied larger, more open waterways consisting of river basins and mangrove swamps, and was the species most tolerant of brackish waters. In comparison, the slender-snouted crocodile typically occupies rivers within forest interiors, while dwarf crocodiles are distributed in smaller rivers (mainly tributaries), streams and brooks also within forested areas. Relationship with humans Compared to the Nile crocodile, the West African crocodile is smaller: Adults are typically long, and maximum is perhaps . It is less aggressive than the Nile crocodile, but several attacks on humans have been recorded, including fatal ones. Mauritanian traditional peoples who live in close proximity to West African crocodiles revere them and protect them from harm. This is due to their belief that, just as water is essential to crocodiles, so crocodiles are essential to the water, which would permanently disappear if they were not there to inhabit it. Here the crocodiles live in apparent peace with the humans, and are not known to attack swimmers. =In Ancient Egypt= CT scan of a crocodile mother with juveniles on its back The people of Ancient Egypt worshiped Sobek, a crocodile-god associated with fertility, protection, and the power of the pharaoh. They had an ambivalent relationship with Sobek, as they did (and do) with C. suchus; sometimes they hunted crocodiles and reviled Sobek, and sometimes they saw him as a protector and source of pharaonic power. C. suchus was known to be more docile than the Nile crocodile and was chosen by the Ancient Egyptians for spiritual rites, including mummification. A recent DNA test found that all sampled mummified crocodiles from Grottes de Thebes, Grottes de Samoun, and Haute Egypt belonged to this species. Bust of Sobek, the ancient Egyptian crocodile god Sobek was depicted as a crocodile, as a mummified crocodile, or as a man with the head of a crocodile. The center of his worship was in the Middle Kingdom city of Arsinoe in the Faiyum Oasis (now Al Fayyum), known as \\"Crocodilopolis\\" by the Greeks. Another major temple to Sobek is in Kom-Ombo; other temples were scattered across the country. Historically, C. suchus inhabited the Nile River in Lower Egypt along with the Nile crocodile. Herodotus wrote that the Ancient Egyptian priests were selective when picking crocodiles. Priests were aware of the difference between the two species, C. suchus being smaller and more docile, making it easier to catch and tame. Herodotus also indicated that some Egyptians kept crocodiles as pampered pets. In Sobek's temple in Arsinoe, a crocodile was kept in the pool of the temple, where it was fed, covered with jewelry, and worshipped. When the crocodiles died, they were embalmed, mummified, placed in sarcophagi, and then buried in a sacred tomb. Many mummified C. suchus specimens and even crocodile eggs have been found in Egyptian tombs. Spells were used to appease crocodiles in Ancient Egypt, and even in modern times Nubian fishermen stuff and mount crocodiles over their doorsteps to ward against evil. =In captivity= A West African crocodile in Copenhagen Zoo, thought to be a Nile crocodile until 2013–2014 where a DNA study confirmed its true identity A West African crocodile at the Philadelphia Zoo thought to be a Nile crocodile until 2018 The West African crocodile only received wider recognition as a valid species in 2011. Consequently, captives have typically been confused with other species, especially the Nile crocodile. In Europe, breeding pairs of West African crocodiles live in Copenhagen Zoo, Lyon Zoo and Vivarium de Lausanne, and offspring of the first pair are in Dublin Zoo and Kristiansand Zoo. A study in 2015 that included sixteen captive \\"Nile crocodiles\\" in six US zoos (almost 25% of the \\"Nile crocodiles\\" in AZA zoos) found that all but one were actually West African crocodiles.

Until 2016, the pistol was manufactured at Beretta USA's main headquarters in Accokeek, Maryland. The Nano pistol's initial release is chambered in 9mm Luger. It has been available since October 2011. A .40 S&W; version of the pistol was in development, however, this has never been released.Beretta BU9 Nano Subcompact Pistol Design The Beretta Nano is a compact handgun developed for concealed carry. It has a fiberglass infused \\"technopolymer\\" frame and a Pronox finished slide. Pronox is a form of ferritic nitrocarborizing finish similar to Tenifer (as used on for example Glock pistols) and Melonite (as used on for example Springfield Armory XD and Smith & Wesson M&P; pistols). The sights on the Nano are low-profile 3-dot sights. The 9mm version of the Nano holds 6 rounds of ammunition in a single- column box magazine, for a total capacity of 7 if the pistol is chambered and the magazine is fully loaded. The Nano was designed with a removable serial- numbered chassis separate from the frame, an unusual feature notably also found in the SIG Sauer P250-series pistols. This allows the owner to customize their grips with multi-colored frames. without replacing the component that legally constitutes a firearm. Designed to be used as a concealed carry self- defense weapon, the Nano has no external slide lock or release. Additionally, the Nano has no external safety. The absence of these protruding controls reduces the likelihood of the weapon snagging on clothing during an occasion where a quick and clean draw is required. The slide locks in a rear position after the magazine has been emptied. A loaded magazine must then be installed, or the empty magazine withdrawn, and the slide must be pulled rearward, in order to cycle the slide completely. Early owners of the Nano voiced concern about an intermittent failure to eject (FTE) while using lower quality ammunition with 115 grain bullets. Some users of the Nano counter that 115 grain ammunition would seldom, if ever, see service in the Nano as it is employed to its intended purpose of a concealed carry defensive weapon, although 115 grain ammunition is frequently used in training and range shooting. Many add that the Nano is rated for 9mm +P ammunition, and as such requires ammunition heavier than 115 grains to function as designed, although Beretta did not mention this in the owner's manual or in any of its marketing materials. Most Nano owners agree that the pistol functions best on ammunition with bullets of 124 grains or heavier, and this opinion is seconded by many representatives of Beretta USA. The Nano is now banned from retail sale in the state of California, due to anti-firearm legislation.

He also wounded his sister, who was also at Gardner's home. His case has attracted extensive attention after Buck argued his right to a fair trial was violated when psychologist Walter Quijano testified that black people were statistically more likely to commit violence. (In Texas, the jury must first unanimously agree that the defendant poses a \\"continuing threat to society\\" in order for a death sentence to be imposed.) At the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor used the psychologist's statements to argue that risk of future violence. “You heard from Dr. Quijano, who had a lot of experience in the Texas Department of Corrections, who told you that there was a probability that the man would commit future acts of violence.” Buck was scheduled to be executed on September 15, 2011; however, the Supreme Court of the United States granted a stay of the process.\\"Temporary stay granted for Texas death row inmate\\". CNN, 9/15/2011. The psychologist's assertion about black offenders has been the cornerstone of Buck's death penalty appeal: that his sentencing was racially biased. In 2000 Texas Attorney General John Cornyn recommended that six cases, including Buck's case, be reviewed for racially biased testimony. Buck's case was not reviewed; the other five cases were reviewed but all of those offenders were sentenced to death again because the testimony was found to be only a small part of each trial.Michael Graczyk. \\"Duane Buck Case: U.S. Supreme Court Stays Execution Of Texas Inmate\\". The Huffington Post, 9/15/11. In response to Buck's case, the justices conceded that the testimony of Quijano \\"would provide a basis for reversal of [Buck's] sentence if the prosecution were responsible for presenting that testimony to the jury.\\" However, Quijano was a defense witness, and it was Buck's attorney who elicited the correlation between race and future risk for criminal actions. Retired Justice John Paul Stevens commented that he believed the decision would be different if the prosecution presented the testimony. Sonia Sotomayor described Buck's death sentence as \\"marred by racial overtones\\" that \\"our criminal justice system should not tolerate.\\" Sotomayor and Justice Elena Kagan dissented from the denial. On August 20, 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected hearing the question of race being allowed as a deciding factor for executing the guilty. The 5th denied a certificate of appealability because Buck did not show extraordinary circumstances. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and, on October 5, 2016, heard oral argument as to whether the Fifth Circuit imposed an improper and unduly burdensome Certificate of Appealability standard. On October 3, 2017, Buck was resentenced to life in prison with parole eligibility after 40 years plus two concurrent 60-year terms for attempted murder. He will become eligible for parole in 2035.

With the help of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen owning 3%, and with Steve Vizard on the board, it became a profitable web development company, developing the websites for well known brands such as Thrifty Car Rental, Hamilton Island and Nissan Australia. It also sold its own in-house products, such as ZoneStudio, a web development tool, and IntraZone, an early SharePoint like intranet application. It survived the dotcom crash, and with the purchase of New Skies Networks and its teleport facilities in Adelaide and Perth in 2005, it evolved into a fully-fledged satellite communications company, changing its name to NewSat on 1 September 2006. Most of NewSat's customers were located in Australia, the Middle East and Africa. With the withdrawal of combat troops in Afghanistan and with the Australian mining boom winding down, the services for NewSat's teleport business started to wane. Having made a $39.7 million loss in the second half of 2014, and with $300 million in outstanding loan repayments, NewSat was placed in administration in mid April 2015,.http://www.smh.com.au//breaking-news- business/satellite-leader-placed-in-administration-20150417-3uabf.html Over the next few months as funding difficulties ensued, its contracts with Lockheed Martin and Arianespace was terminated, and its main asset sold to SpeedCast Australia Pty Limited. Jabiru Fleet With Jabiru, NewSat was to be Australia's first independently owned satellite operator to manage a fleet of commercial Ku- and Ka-band satellites. Its Jabiru-1 Ka-band satellite was scheduled to take off in 2016, and would have catered to mobile communications carrier and private and public organizations across the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Australia.\\"Multi-Million Deal for Australia's First Independent Satellite Communications Provider\\" On 8 December 2011, NewSat and Lockheed Martin entered into a fixed price contract for the design, manufacture, testing and on‐ground delivery of Jabiru‐1, and its related launch mission operations. Construction of Jabiru‐1 began in January 2012 at Lockheed Martin’s Newtown, Pennsylvania facility, and was scheduled to be available for shipment to the launch site at Centre Spatial Guyanais near Kourou, French New Guinea by 25 March 2016. The launch window for Jabiru‐1 by Arianespace was scheduled for May 2016. On 14 June 2012, the Export–Import Bank of the United States approved a direct loan of US$281 million (later increased US$300.5 million) to Jabiru Satellite Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of NewSat), with a guarantee by Compagnie Française d'Assurance pour le Commerce Extérieur (COFACE) and a stand-by facility from the British Standard Chartered Bank. In mid February 2014 with construction underway of the Jabiru-1 satellite, NewSat had paid Lockheed Martin close to US$170 million, out of an expected total cost of US$268 million.\\"All systems go for NewSat's Jabiru-1 satellite\\" - The Australian, 18 February 2014 (accessed 2015-02-26) Total project cost was expected to be US$600 (AU$664) million, including US$116 million for the rocket to place the satellite in orbit in the second half of 2015. At that time, NewSat confirmed that 18% capacity of the satellite had already been sold, at an estimated value of AU$644 million. = Funding issues = In early August 2014, NewSat got a conditional waiver over alleged breaches of financial facilities, to continue with the Jabiru-1 project. At that time, it was expected that the satellite would be assembled in late 2014 and tested in 2015.\\"NewSat gets conditional waiver to continue Jabiru-1 satellite\\" - IT News, 25 August 2014 (accessed 2015-02-26) On 16 December 2014, Lockheed Martin, the Jabiru-1 satellite builder, issued NewSat a default notice due to a defaulted payment of US$21 million (A$26.5 million); giving a period of up to 90 days to make payments without further impact.\\"NewSat defaults on $26m in overdue Lockheed payments\\" - IT News, 27 January 2015 (accessed 2015-02-26) Subsequently, Lockheed Martin issued a termination notice on 22 January 2015, and on 25 February 2015, Arianespace also issued default notices due to overdue payments for the Launch Services Agreement, totalling over US$42 million. In late March 2015, NewSat requested a trading halt due to ongoing issues with project financing, which would remain in place until negotiations with US lenders were completed.\\"NewSat forced to halt trading over satellite funding\\" - IT News, 30 March 2015 (accessed 2015-04-14) On 8 April 2015 NewSat announced that \\"COFACE Lender Group\\" would not support the waiver and not advance funds. This represents US$160 Million (AU$209M) lost, requiring an additional US$70 Million in capital that was needed to be raised to keep the project alive. In mid-April 2015, NewSat was placed into administration to resolve the troubled financial situation and save the project; at the same time a temporary order was issued in the US to keep the construction contracts with Lockheed Martin and Arianespace.\\"NewSat enters administration over troubled satellite\\" - IT News, 17 April 2015 (accessed 2015-04-17) With funding difficulties continuing, Lockheed Martin terminated the manufacturing agreement later that month, taking ownership of the half constructed satellite, and Arianespace, the launcher provider, terminated the launch services agreement on 4 August 2015. On 29 May 2015 the receivers terminated Mr Adrian Ballintine’s role as chief executive officer by way of redundancy. When the receivers found no buyers for the remaining assets, the company was finally liquidated in the final months of 2015. In August 2016, it was revealed on the current affairs program Four Corners that NewSat had been the victim of foreign hackers. Daryl Peter, the former IT manager, said “Newsat had been hacked and not just by teenagers in the basement or anything like that. Whoever was hacking us was very well-funded, very professional, very serious hackers.” In late January 2017, the receivers McGrathNicol filed an action in the Federal Court of Australia seeking damages of AU$270 million against former managing director Adrian Ballintine and former chairman Richard Green, alleging that they both breached their directors' duties.

He has worked in sales, marketing and artist promotion at labels such as Century Media, Priority Records, Macey Lipman Marketing, and SST Records, where he worked with Black Flag. He is no longer the general manager at Southern Lord Records. Until 2010 he was booking manager of the Hollywood heavy rock venue The Relax Bar. He is also the manager of Club My War, a facilitator of underground metal hardcore and avant-garde music in Hollywood proper. In 2001 Solis founded the hardcore punk duo It's Casual, which has released three studio albums on CD/LP and played with bands such as Story of the Year, Mastodon, High on Fire, Zeke, Fu Manchu, and Death by Stereo. He was also a founding member of the hard rock band Revolution Mother with Mike Vallely in 2005. Early life Eddie Solis was born and raised in East Los Angeles County. As a child his father used to carry him around on his shoulders while listening to Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and The Who, all bands which Solis has cited as influential on his later music. Solis has stated he is the result of \\"basically growing up around a gang-infested area with lots of negativity.\\" He turned to skateboarding as an escape, and his parents let him build a halfpipe in the backyard. Solis would \\"put Slayer on the radio superloud\\" and practice tricks with friends. When he was fifteen he started his first band, a Ramones cover group called Endless Vacation, which played shows in his parents' living room. They also performed shows for donations to repair the halfpipe. He began renting skateboarding videos in 1987, and the soundtracks exposed him to bands such as Black Flag, Dinosaur Junior, Bl'ast!, The Minutemen, and other bands on the SST Records label. He would write down the band names and special order the records because local record stores didn't have them in stock. Music industry career Right out of highschool Solis began working in the music industry. In 1993 he became an intern at the metal label Century Media in Santa Monica, commuting from his home in Pico Rivera. He stayed about a month. From 1995 to 1996 he began working in retail marketing for artists at Priority Records, a rap label featuring artists such as N.W.A., Dr. Dre, Ice Cube. While there he assisted Guy Pinhas of The Obsessed and Goatsnake.

He remained with Lipman Marketing until 1999. SST Records hired Solis in 2002. He began working directly with Greg Ginn and served as a publicist for bands such as Black Flag for their reunion. While working at SST he became aware of Southern Lord Records, particularly albums such as their Saint Vitus reissues and Probot. He began taking an interest in the label, and after making contact with the founder, he began working for Southern Lord in 2004 as general manager. He handles sales, distribution management, and promotions. =Relax Bar= In 2005, Solis was walking down the road near the Southern Lord offices in East Hollywood, and found a small venue named The Relax Bar with its doors open. He noticed a small stage with a drumset and small amps. He pitched the idea of a metal venue to the Thai owners through a translator, who were supportive after hearing tracks by High on Fire, It's Casual, and selection of punk and grindcore. Solis described The Relax Bar as \\"a place where everything underneath the metal umbrella is welcome, whether it’s experimental, progressive, black metal, death metal, thrash, hardcore.\\" The venue was at 5511 Hollywood Blvd. and never used a \\"pay-to-play\\" model. Until it closed in 2010 it was considered a hub for the Los Angeles heavy music scene, and Solis had booked approximately 400 thrash, drone, speed, doom, noise, and punk shows at the venue by 2010. Bands included It's Casual, G.F.P with Tony Alva, The Meatmen, Municipal Waste, Unholy Grave, and Phobia. =Club My War= Solis is the founder of Club My War, the longest running facilitator of underground metal hardcore and avant-garde music in Hollywood proper.

Solis had met Vallely while working at SST, and Vallely subsequently asked him to play bass and with the start of Vallely's post-Mike V. and the Rats band. Revolution Mother utilized blues-riffs and drew comparisons to Bl'ast, Motörhead, and Black Flag.

While he is perhaps best known for his role in breeding and developing the first breed standard for the Australian Cattle Dog he also developed the first breed standard for the Australian Kelpie, wrote on a number of practical subjects for the newspapers of the time, and published works of fiction in magazines such as The Bulletin. In addition Kaleski patented his designs for improved farm implements, and developed and applied successful theories of soil management in times of drought. A bachelor, he spent most of his life on his farm at Moorebank, where a street is now named in his honour. He died at the age of 84. Early years Robert Lucian Stanislaus Kaleski was the son of a Polish mining engineer, John Kaleski, and his English wife Isabel, née Falder. Political pressures in Poland led John Kaleski to move to Germany, where he held academic appointments at Bonn and Heidelberg Universities, and from there to Australia where he re-built a career as a mining engineer and assayer. Robert Kaleski was born on 19 January 1877 at Burwood in Sydney. Ill health as a child led to him spending long periods with a relative at Holsworthy, where he attended little school but learned much about the local bush. In his teens, living in Sydney with access to a good library, he educated himself and began studying for a legal career, however he abandoned his studies at the age of twenty-one and went droving. He had a series of jobs in the bush including working on a property at Grenfell and timber getting on the Dorrigo Plateau before taking up a small selection at Holsworthy in 1904. Dog expert Kaleski with a Cattle Dog Kaleski became a dog owner at the age of six years, and was a lifelong student of the dog and the dingo. In 1893 he was a member of the Cattle Dog Club of Sydney, and one of a group of members who bred from bloodlines originating from Thomas Hall's \\"Hall's Heelers\\" and called their dogs the Australian Cattle Dog. In 1903 he drew up the first breed standard for the Australian Cattle Dog, and in 1904 the first breed standard for the Kelpie and another variety of sheepdog he called the Barb, a breed which is now considered synonymous with the Kelpie. These standards were accepted by the leading breeders of the time, published in The Agricultural Gazette of New South Wales, adopted by the Kennel Club of New South Wales, and became the guidelines for breeders and judges Australia-wide. Kaleski founded the Cattle and Sheepdog Club of Australia. A dedicated breeder, he also worked his dogs with stock, and both exhibited and judged dogs in the show ring. With his dog Nugget (1908–12) he founded a noted line of Australian Cattle Dogs that included champions such as Clovelly Mavis and Clovelly Biddy. Writer Australian Barkers and Biters 1st Edition Under a variety of pen names, including 'Falder' his mother's maiden name, Kaleski wrote a number of articles on bush life for the Sydney Mail, Sydney Morning Herald, and Worker, and short fiction for The Bulletin. His articles on dogs and other animals were also featured in A. G. Stephens's literary magazine called The Bookfellow. In association with the Royal Agricultural Society of NSW, the Forestry Commission of New South Wales, and the NSW Department of Agriculture he published articles on working dogs and settler life, and on the Australian bush. He wrote The Australian settler's complete guide : scientific and practical published in 1909. Targeting British migrants, it was \\"written for the man on the land and for intending settlers in New South Wales\\" and contained detailed information about all types of farming, and the equipment needed. In it Kaleski gave practical directions for such essential tasks as Building the Hut. In 1914 his articles and stories on dogs were re-published in book form as Australian Barkers and Biters, with illustrations by Hugh Maclean. In 1933 he published a completely revised edition which embodied his theories on the origin of the dog, and which had photographs instead of illustrations. Another revised edition of Barkers and Biters was published posthumously in 1987. Kaleski is mentioned in Dame Mary Gilmore's 1922 book of prose poems entitled Hound of the Road, \\"But who has written our dog? Kaleski? Kaleski wrote dogs, not the dog.\\" Kaleski's writings were based on his experiences. Sir Joseph Carruthers noted his keen powers of observation, likening him to the naturalist Jean Henri Fabre. Carruthers described Kaleski as an interesting conversationalist who wrote as he spoke, \\"with wit and brevity\\". Bushman Kaleski is described as a \\"true bushman and environmentalist\\". He was keenly interested in agriculture, inventing and patenting a number of new or improved farm implements and practical tools. He lived through the devastating Federation Drought which reached its climax in late 1901 and 1902, and devised a water and soil management scheme to offset the effects of drought. In 1918 he bought a run-down farm at Moorebank, near Liverpool. He restored the of Thorn Hill, applying his theories on land management. He lived at Thorn Hill until his death, and continued to experiment with plant breeding and other agricultural developments. Kaleski was a Fellow of the Linnean Society of New South Wales.

Total mileage is . Connections are made with CSX at Bostic. Rail is 85 pounds. History The former CSXT Bostic-Forest City line was originally built by the Central Carolina Railroad in 1886 as part of a route from Rutherfordton to Charlotte, North Carolina. The Central Carolina was later acquired by Seaboard Air Line. Through mergers, it later became part of CSX. The former Norfolk Southern Forest City-Alexander Mills line was built in 1887 by the Charleston, Cincinnati, and Chicago Railroad as part of a line from Marion, North Carolina to Kingville in South Carolina. The line was soon acquired by the Southern Railway, which merged into Norfolk Southern in 1982. By the early 1980s, both CSX and Norfolk Southern reached an agreement to allow the consolidation of trackage in both Rutherford and Cleveland counties. This would allow both companies to abandon duplicate lines, while granting trackage rights on former competitor routes. While this move helped with operating costs, traffic declined to the point that by late 1989, Norfolk Southern had pulled out of operating its remaining segment from Gilkey, through Forest City, to Alexander Mills. The Gilkey-Ruth segment of this line had already been embargoed due to lack of traffic as well as downed trees caused by Hurricane Hugo. At about this time, CSX was considering abandonment of its Bostic-Forest City line as well. A group of the railroad's online shippers formed the Rutherford Railroad Development Corporation, which acquired both the former CSX Bostic-Forest City line and Norfolk Southern's Gilkey-Alexander Mills line in early 1990 in order to preserve rail service. Total rail mileage acquired was 16 miles. The line was leased to Southeast Shortlines, Inc, which renamed the line the Thermal Belt Railway after the area's isothermal effect which, on certain cool nights, allowed the area mountains to be warmer in temperature on the slope than on the base. The line started operations on April 2, 1990. Traffic in its first few years consisted of inbound plastic pellets, grain and lumber and outbound pulpwood on the remaining open sections of track, while work started on clearing the downed trees on the embargoed section. However traffic on that segment never materialized, and after about 10 years of dormancy, the Gilkey- Spindale section was converted into a rail-trail with the provision that it could be reactivated if needed. The remaining trackage has seen a steady decline of traffic to the point that by late 2010, parts of the line was used for rail car storage. As of 2014 the only customer remaining on the line is a small transload operation near the CSX interchange. Included in the May 2014 North Carolina Freight Rail & Rail Crossing Safety Improvement Fund Projects budget is a $58,688 grant to construct more transloading tracks and expand this operation., \\"Freight Rail & Rail Crossing Safety Improvement Fund Projects\\" (retrieved 7/7/2014) Motive power The Thermal Belt operates with two locomotives. Number 1 is an Electro-Motive Corporation SW model switcher repowered with a Cummins 600 horsepower engine block. The unit was originally built in July, 1938 for Missouri Pacific's subsidiary, Union Terminal Railway of St. Joseph, Missouri. It was then transferred to another Missouri Pacific subsidiary, St. Joseph Belt Railway, which served as their #5. When the St Joseph Belt was merged into the Missouri Pacific, the SW became their #6005. The locomotive was sold in the mid-1960s to Precision Engineering, which remanufactured (but not repowered) the SW. The unit was sold to the Pickens Railroad as their #3. Pickens kept the unit until the mid-1970s when it was sold to Birmingham Rail and Locomotive near Birmingham, Alabama. It was then acquired by Duke Power and sent to Chattahoochee Locomotive, near Cornelia, Georgia to be repowered with a Cummins engine block. It was assigned to construction duty at Duke's Cherokee Nuclear Power Plant. An economic downturn as well as new nuclear power regulations in the 1980s sidelined the plant, parking the SW locomotive for several years. The unit was sold in 1989 to Don McGrady, which formed Southeastern Shortlines Inc as an operator for the Thermal Belt Railway and, later on, the Caldwell County Railroad. The 4601 is of MPRX heritage and was sold to the Thermal Belt in late 2015.

The birth of MCBS  In the beginning of the twentieth century the Eucharistic-centered re- awakening in the life of the Church, initiated by Pope Pius X (1903–1914), had its impact on the Syro-Malabar Church.See the official site here http://www.smcim.org/ There was also a new missionary awareness and enthusiasm in this Apostolic Church. It was in this historical setting that the Missionary Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament (MCBS) was born. God has been preparing two great men (mahatmas) in the persons of Father Mathew Alakalam and Father Joseph Paredom to take up this new charism in the church, who in fulfilment of their lifelong religious and missionary aspirations outlined a new way of religious life in the Church: the Missionary Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament. In 1933, the jubilee year of the redemptive sacrifice of our Lord, on Sunday 7 May, the feast of St. Joseph’s patronage, in the mission church at Mallappally, Mar James Kalacherry, bishop of Changanacherry, established the Missionary Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament. The idea of a new religious community originated in Fr. Mathew Alakalam. His companion, Fr. Joseph Paredom co-operated with him in nurturing it. They, with the blessing and permission of Mar James Kalachery, the late bishop of Changanacherry, had the congregation founded on 7 May 1933 at Mallappally. Before long the residence was shifted to Kaduvakulam, and the Little Flower Ashram there is considered to be the Mother House of the congregation. The founding Fathers of the congregation have entrusted to its members, as their spiritual heritage, a religious life marked by love and single-minded devotion to the Eucharistic Lord and missionary vitality. Its charism is to live and proclaim the Eucharistic Mystery that is celebrated, to gather the children of God around the altar, to ‘praise God in the midst of His Church, to take part in her sacrifice and to eat the Lord’s supper’ (SC 10) and to uphold the real presence of the Lord in the Blessed Sacrament. The members try to obtain this through their dedicated life and various apostolates. The congregation has, at present, 412 professed members. There are 37 novices and 172 minor seminarians. It has 90 Houses and Institutions in various dioceses in and outside India.for more Details and Pictures See the Link http://mcbsonline.wordpress.com  Growth and development of MCBS  In 1978, the district of Shimoga in Karnataka, under the jurisdiction of Mananthavady diocese, was entrusted to MCBS for pastoral care and evangelization. In 1989 the missionary activities of the congregation were extended to Rajasthan. The district of Sirohi is entrusted to the congregation for evangelization. The ‘Rule of Life’ of the congregation, revised and renewed after a careful study of the charism, nature, spirit, tradition and founders, and according to the directives given by the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, was promulgated on 25 May 1989. The Holy See approved the Rule of Life for an experimental period of seven years and raised the congregation to pontifical Status on 2 December 1989. In 1992 the districts of Satara and Solapur in Maharashtra, under the jurisdiction of the diocese of Kalyan, were entrusted to the congregation for pastoral care and evangelization. On 4 May 1995 the congregation was divided into two regions, namely MCBS EmmausFor details visit http://mcbsemmaus.wordpress.com Region and MCBS ZionFor details visit http://zionmcbs.org Region.

Founders of MCBS  = Very Rev Fr Mathew Alakulam MCBS =  Childhood  Fr Mathew Alakulam, the architect of the Missionary Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament (MCBS), was born on 30 March 1888 at Poovathode near Bharananganam. After his primary and high school education he joined the Puthenpally Seminary as a scholastic of Changanassery Archdiocese. On 21 December 1913 he was ordained a priest by Mar Thomas Kurialassery.  Priestly ministry  Fr Mathew, a zealous young shepherd, served as assistant parish priest at Kurusumkal, Koonammavu, Mundankal, Cheruvandoor, Elamthottam, and Pravithanam and as parish priest at Poovathode, Edamaraku, and Elamthottam. Since 1919 he was professor of Syriac at Puthenpally Seminary. When Mar James Kalassery became Bishop of Changanassery he found none other than Fr Mathew as his first secretary. He was superior of the Franciscan Third Order, and the mastermind behind the Orphanage Press and Priests’ Provident Fund in the diocese of Changanassery.  Foundation Of MCBS  On 7 May 1933 Fr Mathew Alakulam together with Fr Joseph Paredom founded the Missionary Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament (MCBS) at Mallappally Mission church. Today MCBS, a religious congregation of the pontifical right, is known as the Benedictines of the Syro-Malabar Church due to her unique liturgical, Eucharistic, and missionary charism and contributions.  Loud Speaker Of The Holy Spirit  Even when Fr Mathew was a young priest he was renowned for his inspiring speeches. His writings and sermons on Holy Spirit were so famous that he came to be known as the ‘Loud Speaker of the Holy Spirit’. Attuned to the voice of the Spirit and walking long distances barefooted, he preached hundreds of retreats in every nook and corner of Kerala.  Literary contributions  Like St Ephrem Fr Mathew was a powerful instrument in the hands of the Holy Spirit. He was sub- editor of the magazine Eucharist and Priest published from Puthenpally Seminary and was the founding editor of Vedaprachara Madhyasthan, the official tongue of Changanassery Archdiocese. He wrote many articles and authored 24 theological books.  Missionary and mystic of the Eucharist  Fr Mathew, a great mystic and missionary of the Eucharist, often exclaimed in joy and wonder, \\"praised be to the Most Holy Mystery of the Eucharist full of goodness and glory. Let there be worship and glory to the Most Blessed Sacrament as innumerable times as there are stars in heaven and clouds in sky\\". He was called for eternal reward on 21 December 1977 and his mortal remains were buried in the church at the MCBS mother house,Kaduvakkulam. = Rev Fr Joseph Paredom MCBS =  Childhood  Father Joseph Paredom, one of the most brilliant and saintly sons of the Syro-Malabar Church, was born on 15 December 1887 at Mutholapuram in Palai diocese. After high school studies at Puthuvely and Mannanam, on 9 January 1908 he joined the Puthenpally Seminary as a scholastic of the Changanassery Archdiocese. There he found his closest friend and the greatest personality, the Most Holy Eucharist. On 28 December 1914 he was ordained a priest by Mar Thomas Kurialassery.  Shepherd  Father Joseph, a good shepherd who won hearts of his sheep by his love and gentleness, praiseworthily served at various parishes such as Mutholapuram, Bharananganam, Muttuchira, Thathampally, Kainady, Vadakara, Chemmalamattam, and Marangattupally.  Founder  The deep desire of Father Paredom to become a religious was consented on 19 April 1933 by Mar James Kalacherry, the Archbishop of Changanacherry. Led by the Holy Spirit, on 7 May 1933 Fr Mathew Alakalam and Father Joseph Paredom founded the Missionary Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament (MCBS).  Superior general  Trusting fully in the Eucharistic Jesus and heeding always to the whisperings of the Holy Spirit, Father Joseph, the first Superior General of the Missionary Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament, courageously led the congregation during its initial 22 years.  Prophet of the most holy Eucharist  As John the Apostle at the bosom of Jesus in the Upper Chamber (Jn 13,25), during his old-age Father Joseph spent most of his time before the Blessed Sacrament, thanking, adoring, praising, and glorifying Jesus in the Most Holy Eucharist. Like a branch united to the vine (Jn 15,5) he experienced God’s love and intimacy in a special way in the Holy Eucharist, which is evident from his words, \\"How lovely to dwell in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament! What there can be more joyful than this! That is what God has given us\\". Light Lit On The Mountain Father Joseph Paredom, the role model for the Eucharistic Millennium and the Eucharistic Year, received his eternal crown on 21 August 1972. His mortal remains were kept at the MCBS Mother House, Kaduvakulam, Kottayam. Today, like a light lit on the mountain, Father Joseph illumines everyone in the Third Millennium by teaching us, \\"the goal of apostolic endeavour is that all who are made sons of God by faith and baptism should come together to praise God in the midst of his Church, to take part in the Sacrifice and to eat the Lord’s Supper\\" (SC 10). = Exhumation and reburial = The mortal remains of our venerable founders, Fr. Mathew Alakulam and Fr. Joseph Paredam were exhumed from the tombs at Kaduvakulam and reburied temporarily in the tombs prepared in the Lisieux Minor Seminary chapel at Athirampuzha,For pictures and details see the link http://mcbslisieux.wordpress.com/ on 12 May 2009 in the presence of Mar Joseph Perumthottam, the Arch Bishop of Changanacherry.For Picture and More refer http://mcbsonline.wordpress.com/founders/  Charism and nature of MCBS  In this Congregation our ideal is to consecrate the entire life to the realisation of God’s Kingdom (Matt 6, 10), placing the Eucharist at the core of our being. Drawing inspiration from the age-old spiritual wisdom of eastern Christian monasticism and from the quest of the sages (rishis) of India for the absolute, the MCBS tries to reach out, in and through the Eucharist, to the God-experience of our father St. Thomas, the Apostle, in his faith- surrender \\"My Lord and My God\\" (John20,28). Our charism, sown by the spirit as a seed in our founders, grew up to the spiritual patrimony of our Congregation. They have entrusted to our keeping for our spiritual heritage, a religious life marked by love and single minded devotion (bhakti) to the Eucharistic Lord and missionary vitality. This charism is to live and proclaim the Eucharistic Mystery we celebrate, to gather the children of God around the altar to \\"praise God in the midst of His Church, to take part in the sacrifice and to eat the Lord’s supper\\" and to uphold the real presence of the Lord in the Blessed Sacrament. Liturgical Apostolate, Eucharistic Retreat, Parish Apostolate, Proclamation of Good News, Mission towards unity, Inculturation, and Dialogue with other religions and social Apostolate form the core areas of MCBS activity. Our mission works are mainly among the poor, illiterate, and the marginalized in various parts of India’s vast mission fields entrusted to us for the pastoral care by the local bishops.See this Link for More Details on CHARISM & NATURE http://mcbsonline.wordpress.com/charism/  Bishops from MCBS  = Mar Thomas Elavanal MCBS, Bishop of Kalyan = On 18 December 1996 Thomas Elavanal, then Superior General, was nominated the first bishop from the Congregation.

Born in Kehl, he worked as a travelling violinist in France and Italy. He eventually settled in Venice where he resided until his death. Early life Deconet was born in Kehl, near Strasbourg, in 1713 to Pietro Deconet. As an adolescent, Deconet joined military service thinking it would provide him an opportunity to travel and satisfy his curiosity of the world. It is thought that he learned how to play the violin during his time as a soldier. However, after only two years as a soldier, Deconet left Paris to make a long and trying journey to Venice. In 1732, at the age of 19, he worked his way from Paris to Venice as that of a traveling musician, stopping in villages throughout the French and Italian countryside. Even though he continued to eventually travel on, he chose Venice as his base of operations in later years. Marriages After arriving in Venice, Deconet married the forty-year- old widow, Anna Chiaparota. She died later the same year on November 10. Ignoring the usual rules of mourning, Deconet remarried very soon after in 1744. His new wife was 20-year-old Paola Stecherle, a woman who made a living cooking in small restaurants around Venice. Before wedding Deconet, she lived with a butcher in San Marcuola in Venice. A witness to the marriage, Giuseppe Salbego (known as Mioli), was a tailor and good friend of Deconet. He stated at the wedding, “I have known him for four or five years because he lives in San Giovanni in Bragara where he has lived since his first wife’s death – seven or eight months. I have met frequently with him since his widowhood and I know he has not other marriage obligations or promises.” Soon after the wedding, the couple moved to San Zeminian to an apartment. It is here that Deconet's first children were born; Matilda (February 9, 1745), and Giovanna (April 3, 1747). He had many more children after moving house to Bragora; Teresa in 1753, Francesco in 1756, GioBatta in 1757, GioBatta Andrea in 1762, and Antonio and Giuseppe (born outside Venice). Antonio and Giuseppe would also become violinist like their father. Violins Deconet was often traveling outside of Venice, and therefore it is not plausible that he ever held an apprenticeship. Apprenticeships required regular attendance and would not have paid enough to support his family. All documents in reference to Deconet list him as a sonadore, which means \\"player\\". Deconet most likely took previously bought violins with him on his travels and resold them at fairs and markets, where he would play and showcase his talent. This theory could explain the varying labels, some handwritten, that he or his buyers would place upon the instruments to remember its origins and garner publicity. Analysis of instruments attributed to Deconet seem to confirm this theory. All of \\"his\\" instruments are obviously of Venetian making, but there are huge differences in style, form, and workmanship. Limited instruments with his label between 1750 and 1760 reveal a probable privileged source of violins from some Venetian maker who was interested in profit. The changes of style of the instruments can be explained by changes of sources for the instruments, as they are seemingly incoherent for the usual artisan development changes. His instruments have features that are typical of Venetian violin makers of the time, such as Pietro Guarnieri and Giorgio Serafin. Violins made in workshops were rarely the work of the maestro (means master), but usually made by the many workers. Instruments made by the workers were generally of the same quality, but much cheaper. Cheaper instruments led to Deconet making a profit. While Deconet lived in Bragara, he lived next to Domenico Garlato, \\"a violin maker with a workshop in his home and three sons,\\" and Giacomo Codeghin, \\"a violin maker without a family living in Calle della Morte.\\" It is extremely likely that Deconet bought instruments for resale from these violin makers.

South Carolina averages 10–15 earthquakes a year below magnitude 3. At 7.3 magnitude, the Charleston earthquake of 1886 was the largest quake to ever hit the Eastern United States. This earthquake killed at least 60 people and destroyed much of the city. Aftershocks, some of them large enough to be damaging by themselves, continued for years. Faults in this region are difficult to study at the surface due to thick sedimentation on top of them. Many of the ancient faults are within plates rather than along plate boundaries.(Abridged from Seismicity of the United States, 1568–1989 (Revised), by Carl W. Stover and Jerry L. Coffman, U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1527, United States Government Printing Office, Washington: 1993.) Prehistoric earthquakes of similar size to the 1886 shock have occurred in coastal South Carolina at intervals of several centuries to several thousands of years. In recent decades, damaging earthquakes much smaller than that of 1886 have occurred every decade or two, most recently in 2014 (magnitude 4.1). Typically, smaller earthquakes are felt each year or two. East of the Rockies, an earthquake shakes the ground over an area up to ten times the area typically shaken by a similar magnitude earthquake on the west coast. For example, an eastern magnitude 4.0 earthquake typically can be felt at many locations as far as 100 km (60 mi) from where it occurred, and it might or might not cause damage near its source. An eastern magnitude 5.5 earthquake usually can be felt out to 500 km (300 mi) in most directions and can cause damage out to 40 km (25 miles). Tectonic setting Earthquakes occur deep within bedrock. Most bedrock beneath the Charleston area was assembled as continents collided to form a supercontinent about 500-300 million years ago, raising the Appalachian Mountains. Most of the rest of the bedrock formed when the supercontinent rifted apart about 200 million years ago to form what are now the southeastern U.S., the Atlantic Ocean, and Africa. Today the Charleston area is far from the nearest plate boundary, which is in the Caribbean Sea. At plate boundaries, the relation of earthquakes to faults is comparatively well understood. In contrast, in the Charleston area, as in most other parts of the U.S. east of the Rockies, the relation is enigmatic. Bedrock in the area is laced with faults that date mainly from the formation of the Appalachians and the birth of the Atlantic. However, in the Charleston area bedrock and its faults are buried beneath sand, silt, clay, and soft sedimentary rocks that may be as thick as 3 km (2 miles). Accordingly, few of the area's earthquakes can be linked to known faults. As in most other regions east of the Rockies, the best guide to earthquake hazards is the earthquakes themselves. Earthquakes =Charleston earthquake of 1886= An estimated $23 million ($ million in ) in damage was caused by one of the great earthquakes in United States history in 1886. Charleston and nearby cities suffered most of the damage, although points as far as away were strongly shaken. Many of the 20 earthquakes of intensity V or greater (Mercalli intensity scale) that centered within South Carolina occurred near Charleston. A 1924 shock in the western part of the State was felt over . Several earthquakes outside the State borders were felt strongly in South Carolina. The August 31, 1886 Charleston earthquake was initially perceived in that city as a barely perceptible tremor, then a sound like a heavy body rolling along; the sound became a roar, all movable objects began to shake and rattle, and the tremor became a rude, rapid quiver. The first shock was at 9:51 p.m. and lasted 35 to 40 seconds. A strong aftershock occurred 8 minutes later. Six additional shocks followed during the next 24 hours. Few buildings escaped damage and many were totally destroyed. Chimneys of at least 14,000 houses were destroyed. The maximum intensity has been estimated at X. An estimated 60 persons were killed by falling buildings and many more were injured. Within a radius of , the cities of Columbia, South Carolina and Augusta and Savannah, Georgia, also experienced damage. The total area affected by this earthquake covered more than and included distant points such as New York City; Boston, Massachusetts; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Havana, Cuba; and Bermuda. All or parts of 30 states and Ontario, Canada, felt the principal earthquake. Two strong aftershocks were reported on October 22, 1886, and another on November 5. The first of these was felt (intensity VI) in Charleston, at Atlanta and Augusta, Georgia, and at other towns. The second shock was intensity VII in Summerville. which received significant damage from the August 31 earthquake. Another tremor caused intensity VI effects on November 5 in Charleston and was felt over the same area as the previous aftershocks. The total felt area covered approximately . =Other quakes= On January 23, 1903, houses were shaken strongly (intensity VI) in the area of the South Carolina - Georgia border near Savannah. Intensity IV - V effects were noted at Charleston, III - IV at Columbia, and III at Augusta, Georgia. A moderate shock affected Charleston, Augusta, and Savannah on April 19, 1907. Dishes rattled and objects were thrown from shelves throughout the 26,000 square kilometer area. A somewhat stronger earthquake caused some damage to chimneys (intensity VII) at Summerville on June 12, 1912. The shock was felt at Charleston with intensity VI and also was felt as far as Brunswick and Macon, Georgia; Greenville, South Carolina, and Wilmington, North Carolina, an area of about 90,000 square kilometers. The Union County area was shaken with an intensity VI - VII earthquake about 6 months later (January 1, 1913). At Union, cracks appeared in many brick buildings and many chimneys were damaged. The total felt area, roughly elliptical in shape, covered approximately 111,000 square kilometers. Another earthquake affected the Summerville area on September 22, 1914. Pictures on walls were displaced (intensity V). The shock was preceded by a noise like a train approaching from a distance. The shock was felt (intensity IV) at Charleston and with less intensity at Augusta, Macon, and Savannah, Georgia, an area of about 78,000 square kilometers. Pickens County was the apparent center of an October 20, 1924, earthquake which shook most of South Carolina and western North Carolina, northeastern Georgia, and eastern Tennessee. The area affected was approximately 145,000 square kilometers. Highest intensities were reported at Pickens, Walhalla, Brevard, and Hendersonville, North Carolina. Buildings were shaken, and furniture was overturned (intensity V). A loud roar accompanied the shock. On July 26, 1945, an earthquake centered in the vicinity of Lake Murray, about 50 kilometers west of Columbia, was felt over 65,000 square kilometers, including part of Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. No damage was noted and only intensity IV - V effects were observed in the epicentral region. Moderately strong shocks occurred near Charleston on November 19, 1952, August 3, 1959, March 12, 1960, July 23, 1960, and October 23, 1967. The 1959 disturbance caused minor damage (intensity VI) at Charleston, Summerville, and Wadmalaw Island. Chimneys were damaged, plaster cracked and fell, walls cracked, and objects fell from shelves. Cracked plaster was also reported from Columbia, Johns Island, Meggett, and Pierpont in South Carolina and from Augusta, Georgia. The total affected area was about 65,000 square kilometers. The other earthquakes did not exceed intensity V. The epicenter for the March 12, 1960, tremor was off the coast of South Carolina; Augusta, Georgia, and Greensboro, North Carolina, also felt this shock. Moderate earthquakes also awakened many residents (intensity V) at Anderson on October 20, 1958, and caused minor damage (cracked and fallen plaster - intensity V) at Chesterfield on October 26, 1959. Another shock on April 20, 1964, was felt strongly (intensity V) at Gaston and Jenkinsville. Places in Fairfield, Florence, Lexington, and Richland Counties also reported the tremors. Several windows were broken in Bowman and Orangeburg (intensity V) from a magnitude 3.4 earthquake on May 19, 1971. Two small shocks, about 3 hours apart, were felt in western South Carolina July 13, 1971. The main shock at 7:42 a.m. edt was felt over approximately 5,200 square kilometers, including two places in Georgia. The tremor was felt by all in Newry; many were frightened by the loud Earth noises (intensity VI), hanging objects swung violently, and furniture shifted. =2002 Seabrook Island earthquake= On Monday, November 11, 2002, areas near Seabrook Island, South Carolina experienced a magnitude 4.4 earthquake. The earthquake occurred at a depth of , 16 miles southeast of Seabrook Island at 32 degrees 22.0 minutes north (32.366N), 80 degrees. 4.4 minutes west (80.073W).

This road curves around housing developments to the front of the Sully Station shopping center, where the name changes to Westfields Boulevard. Poplar Tree Road had been a two-lane undivided road but in spring 2013 a reconstruction and widening project was completed, and it is now a four-lane divided road. =Westfields Boulevard= SR 662 continues past the Sully Station shopping center and through an interchange with SR 28 (Sully Road), then past office parks before ending at SR 657 (Walney Road).

History Prior to 1990, SR 662 followed Poplar Tree Road across VA 28 and the southern section of Chantilly. The completion of the widening of Route 28 (plus the construction of the north end of Sully Station shopping center) made Poplar Tree Road discontinuous, separating its Centreville and Chantilly sections. Westfields Boulevard had been built in the late 1980s, but the SR 662 designation was not officially moved onto it until nearly twenty years later.

He is the annual host and ambassador for The National Counting Bee, a math educator, and media personality. He has published the books Math Magic and Math Magic for Your Kids.. Biography =Early life= Flansburg was born December 28, 1963 in Herkimer, New York. He has stated that he was nine years old when he discovered his mental calculation abilities. He says he wasn't paying attention in math class when his teacher asked him to add two numbers on the blackboard. Instead of adding the columns from right to left, as they'd been taught, he added them from left to right, and solved the problem. Intrigued by math, he began keeping a running tally of his family's groceries at the store so his father could give the cashier an exact check before the total was rung up. In his youth he also began noticing that the shapes and numbers of angles in numbers were clues to their values, and began counting from 0 to 9 on his fingers instead of 1 to 10. =Early career= Flansburg can mentally add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find square and cube roots almost instantly, with calculator accuracy. Around 1990 he began using his abilities in an entertainment and educational context. In 1991, he was involved in the creation of \\"The Human Calculator System\\", a product designed for direct-marketing salespeople, consisting of a study guide and four cassette recordings teaching his method. In the spring of that year, he appeared on the infomercial show \\"Amazing Discoveries\\", hosted by Mike Levey, to promote his product. At the beginning of the program, he was introduced as \\"The Human Calculator\\" for the first time in national media. Flansburg was dubbed \\"The Human Calculator\\" by Regis Philbin after appearing on Live with Regis and Kathy Lee. The Guinness Book of World Records listed him as \\"Fastest Human Calculator\\" in 2001 and 2003, after he broke the record for adding the same number to itself more times in 15 seconds than someone could do with a calculator. In 1999 he invented a 13-month calendar using zero as a day, month, and year, which he called \\"The Human Calculator Calendar\\". In 1998 he published the Harper Paperbacks book Math Magic for Your Kids: Hundreds of Games and Exercises from the Human Calculator to Make Math Fun and Easy. A revised edition of his book Math Magic: How to Master Everyday Math Problems was published in 2004. =The Counting Bee= Flansburg is the creator of the Counting Bee, an annual, fast-paced competition to find the fastest human counters in different age categories around the world. Based on a 15-second countdown, \\"mathletes\\" race to compute as many numeric answers in each level. For each level, they are given random starting numbers and told to count by a fixed number. The starting numbers and counting numbers increase in difficulty with each level. The top mathletes are those who successfully complete the most levels. State-wide and country-wide competitions determine Counting Bee World Champions by age groups. =As an educator= Since about 1990 Flansburg has regularly given lectures and presentations at schools. He has been a presenter at organizations such as NASA, IBM, The Smithsonian Institution, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, and the Mental Calculation World Cup. The latter described Flansburg as \\"more an auditory than a visual [mental] calculator\\". One of Flansburg's \\"personal missions\\" is to use education to elevate math confidence and self-esteem in adults and children. \\"Why has it become so socially acceptable to be bad at math?,\\" he stated. \\"If you were illiterate, you wouldn’t say that on TV, but you can say that you are bad at math. We have to change the attitude.\\" He believes students should become proficient with calculation methods rather than relying on table memorization. Flansburg is the annual host and ambassador for World Maths Day, and an official promoter of the American Math Challenge, a competition for students preparing for World Math Day. =Media appearances= Flansburg has appeared on television shows such as The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and Larry King Live. On April 26, 2009, on the Japanese primetime show Asahi's Otona no Sonata, he broke his own world record with 37 answers in 15 seconds. He was featured as The Human Calculator in the first episode of Stan Lee's Superhumans, which aired on The History Channel on August 5, 2010. Part of the episode analyzed his brain activity. An fMRI scan while he was doing complex calculations revealed that activity in the Brodmann area 44 region of the frontal cortex was absent; instead, there was activity somewhat higher from area 44 and closer to the motor cortex. In January 2016, Flansburg hosted the TV show The Human Calculator on H2.The Human Calculator Full Episodes, Video & More HISTORY Personal life Flansburg resides in San Diego, California.

Located next to the co-developed village of Treharris in the borough of Merthyr Tydfil, on development it was the deepest coalmine in South Wales Coalfield by some . Producing the highest quality steam coal, it powered both the Cunard passenger steamers RMS Mauretania and RMS Lusitania in their successful attempts at the Blue Riband prize for the most rapid Atlantic Ocean passage. The mine is also thought to have been one of several locally that provided coal to the RMS Titanic; tests carried out on coal found in the ship's wreck have shown that most of the coal on board originated in South Wales. Amongst one of the first collieries in South Wales to have shafts wound by electricity, it was the first colliery in South Wales to have pit head baths for its miners. Profitable due to the quality of its coal, but financially degraded by huge volumes of water ingress throughout its working life, it was closed by British Coal on Good Friday, 1991. Today the wider local site, which was also occupied by the nearby Taff Merthyr Colliery and the Trelewis Drift Mine, has been redeveloped into the wildlife and leisure park, Parc Taff Bargoed. Harris Navigation: 1872–1893 The view up Fox Street, Treharris, from the entrance gate to the Deep Navigation Colliery. The photograph was taken during the 1984 Miners’ Strike, in July 1984 In the early 1800s, a mineral lease was granted over of land, owned by three farms: Twyn-y Garreg; Pantanas; Cefn Forest. A group of businessmen, led by Frederick W. Harris, began negotiations for the rights to the mineral lease, which was eventually acquired in 1872. Nothing existed in the area at the time, except for the three farms and their outbuildings, plus the quiet River Taff Bargoed and a small forest on the slopes above the valley. With a proposed name of Harris Navigation Steam Coal Company, development commenced with the construction a row of temporary small houses, built for the families and men who were to be employed to sink the pit. Named the Twyn-y-Garreg huts, they all had wooden frames covered by whitewashed hessian for walls. House No.1 was specially created for the Minnett family of two adults and ten children, and had four bedrooms. The remainder were classical 2 up/2 down room formation terraced-style houses, with a kitchen and parlour on the ground floor, and two bedrooms upstairs. Heating came from a coal fire placed under a stone or brick chimney stack, and the huts were completed with slate roofs. All materials for the huts' construction came from locally obtained resources within the bounds of the mineral lease, including the development of a firestone quarry to the north of the colliery site. The new development was called Treharris ('Harris town' in Welsh). Construction of the main shafts began in October 1872, with sinking commencing in February 1873. Due to the required depth of the shafts to access the coal seams, the operation would prove to be both expensive and dangerous, and create the lifelong operational need to continually extract water due to high levels of ingress. The 167 men of the construction crew were not paid on time on a number of occasions, with final construction costs in May 1878 running to over £300,000, and seven men having lost their lives. The two shafts were built apart: North to a depth of ; South to . This was deeper than any other colliery in the South Wales Coalfield at the time, to allow access the Nine Feet Seam.Thomas (1979), pg 27. Before coal could be extracted commercially, surface buildings were required to be completed. This included the installation of two John Fowler & Co. winding machines, and the forest fully cleared, with wood stored for pit props. Finally, the River Taff Bargoed was enclosed in a tunnel constructed of bricks made from the collieries quarry, enabling water ingress to the mine to be significantly reduced, and slag heaps to be placed on the resultant new land. The first commercial coal was raised at North pit from 1879, and by 1881 both shafts were raising coal. But by this point the colliery company was deep in debt. The only reason that funding had been forthcoming from the shareholders, commercial backers and banks was due to the potential high quality of the coal that could be extracted, and so it proved. The depth of the shafts and the quality of the steam coal extracted hence earned the colliery two nicknames in the South Wales coalfield: \\"Deep Navigation\\" and \\"Ocean Colliery\\". =Water ingress= Due to shaft depth, the major problem with the mine throughout its life was water ingress, with a reported maximum ingress during its operational life of entering the pit every minute. After the first commercial coal was extracted in 1879, the colliery started construction of Cornish Beam engine, capable of extracting over a stroke. Supplied by the Perran Foundry of Truro, water was lifted in stages to different levels, until it reached the surface and was dispersed into pit pond located north of the colliery. Later, mine engineer Castell created the famous Deep Navigation “Castle.” A man-made cavern hewn by hand from solid rock, it was built to store water for removal. Located adjacent to the North pit shaft, it was long, wide and high. Inside was installed an electric sump pump, which connected to a surface pipe that spilled into the same pit pond as the beam engine. Ocean Colliery: 1893–1947 Treharris One winding house, Deep Navigation in July 1987 Industrialist businessman David Davies of Llandinam, became interested in the Harris mine as early as 1890. By this time, almost 1million tonnes of coal had been raised, but by 1892 there was a dip in production. With debts rising, Harris allowed an inspection of the mine by Davies, whose engineers reported that were good reserves of coal in a mine that required relatively little additional investment. Davies's Ocean Coal Company took ownership of the colliery on 17 January 1893, and renamed it Ocean Colliery. There was great competition at the time between colliery owners, with most trying to prove to potential purchasers that their coal was of the best quality. At the time this was signified by being selected by the Royal Navy, and the various transatlantic ocean liners, including the Cunard Line; hence the choice of the renaming. Davies invested in the colliery, including repairing the bases of the shafts. From 1897 onwards, the colliery was producing over 590,000 tons per year with a workforce of 2,500 miners. Ocean Company invested a further £500,000 in 1900 to make the collieries production more economic, so that by 1902, annual output was 327,000 tons by 2,000 men. The steam coal produced during this period was purchased for use by the Cunard steamers RMS Mauretania and RMS Lusitania, used in their successful attempts for the Blue Riband for the most rapid Atlantic passage. The South Wales Miners' Federation had been formed in 1894, and in 1910 and 1911 the Tonypandy riots had occurred to improve miners incomes and working conditions. By 1913, the workforce had shrunk to 1,846 men and boys. At this time Deep Navigation had an extensive underground mine railway, with of underground railways. Over 100 pit ponies were being used at the colliery, mostly underground, but some on the surface. =Pit head baths= In 1913, Davies sent a party of 15 men to the continent to investigate European systems of working practice. As a result of their report, a sum of £8,000 was authorised to build new baths for the miners. The new Treharris baths were constructed by Nicholls & Nicholls of Gloucester, that could accommodate 1,824 men at a time, who were each provided with two lockers: one for clean and the other for dirty clothes. Officially opened on 1 November 1933 by Ocean Coal Company director Thomas Evans O.B.E. of Pentyrch, the baths were the first such facility in South Wales. Having constructed a new power house, which was also supplying Lady Windsor Colliery, the facility was electrically lit, and included an early electric shoe cleaner. The baths were reconstructed in 1933, by which time Ocean had provided baths at Risca, Wattstown, Lady Windsor, Garw, Nantymeol and Nine mile point collieries. =After World War I= After supplying the Royal Navy during World War I, by 1920 the colliery was using the “Barry of Nottingham” system of coal cutting, a forerunner of longwall mining. From a 1923 report by HM Inspectorate of Mines, there were 2,328 men employed, working the Seven Feet, Yard and Nine Feet seams. But by the time of the 1926 General Strike, industrial relations had again broken down. The village of Treharris was staunchly socialist, and was innovative in using the colliery band and local jazz music Treharris Zulus group to raise funds. But by the new year the families were running short of funds, food and fuel, and the workers quickly returned to work. By 1935, the colliery employed 363 men on the surface and 1,875 underground. At the start of World War II, Ernest Bevin introduced a new law that tied the miners to their reserved occupation. Bevin also ordered one in ten young men of eighteen years of age to be employed in the coal industry, with some of the Bevin boys coming to the Treharris area. Deep Navigation: 1947–1991 By 1945 there were 1,826 men working at the complex. After nationalisation in 1947, the colliery was finally named Deep Navigation by the National Coal Board. The NCB made various investments in the colliery, and the fact that the Westminster government was a Clement Attlee-led Labour government, made industrial relations smoother. Investments included the demolition in the mid-1950s of the original 1870 Twyn-y-Garreg huts, but the site remained dormant almost until the colliery closed, when the new Navigation Street was built. By 1960, this investment had resulted in the workforce dropping to just over 1,000 miners. Being located close, the colliery stopped working on announcement of the Aberfan disaster on Friday 21 October 1966, sending all available manpower to the recovery effort. As a result, a few children were pulled out alive in the first hour, but no survivors were found after 11 a.m. that day.Iain McLean & Martin Johnes: The Aberfan Disaster website The last pit pony was retired in 1973, at the time when the colliery won the first of its contracts to supply Aberthaw power station. The centenary celebrations of 1979 saw over 2,000 people descend to pit bottom, with weekly production at around 8,500 tonnes/week. =A decade of industrial decline= After an investment in a new canteen in 1982, and a confirmed £6 million investment in 1983 in a new high- speed conveyor extraction system installed, the 1984 Miners’ Strike could not have been more poorly timed. At the end of the dispute, reform was the agenda of the Conservative government. But the miners still hoped that the 1983 report that concluded there were at least 11 million tons of coal reserves accessible to the colliery, would keep them open. The report further suggested that development of the new “Gellideg” seams at a depth of , would guarantee that the colliery could operate in profit for at least another 20 years. The NCB became the privatised British Coal in 1987, but this was on the back of £2 million investment in the colliery in new machinery. An industrial dispute over required new work practices, resulted in a single pit strike that cost the company £150,000. Production resumed, but faltered again in November with a week-long strike which lost 10,000 tonnes of production. Now British Coal were warned that output was at least 5,000 tonnes below target, and that further disputes would financially jeopardise the future of the colliery. By 1989, Deep Navigation stood alone in the Taff Bargoed valley, making a profit and with coal production rising. But closure occurred that year of both the Taff Merthyr Colliery and the Trelewis Drift Mine, amongst a host of closures in the South Wales Coalfield. The colliery probably survived, as despite the 1984 Miners Strike, average output that decade had reached 375,000 tons per year. =Closure= In 1990, Deep Navigation was not added to British Coal's list of mines for closure, with a reported profit of £1 million to August 1990. The colliery received a single new Dosco roadheader in March that year. However, a geological report issued in the autumn concluded that, due to structural problems in the surrounding substrata, coal reserves would only last until 1994. After a period of consultation with the greatly weakened National Union of Mineworkers, in January 1991, British Coal announced the closure of Deep Navigation from Good Friday, 29 March 1991. The Dosco machine was one of the few items retrieved from pit bottom to the surface. On Sunday 23 March, each miner was allowed to take two guests for a tour of the pit bottom circuit, where they were all presented with a commemorative medal. Deep Navigation NUM lodge provided each working and recently retired miner with a presentation Davy lamp, with over 800 lamps distributed. On the last working day, the Salvation Army band under the direction of Bandmaster Thomas Fredrick Willetts marched with the last shift to the town hall, accompanied by the MP for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, Ted Rowlands, and the MP for Pontypridd, Dr Kim Howells, formally NUM South Wales research officer. Deep Navigation closed with 766 men on the books. The site was cleared from 1993 onwards, but the associated coal washery stayed open for another nine months, so that a stockpile of 370,000 tonnes could be prepared for market. In 1995 it took a week, working 12 hours a day, to fill the three shafts with rubble from the demolished pit head buildings. Transport British Railways Class 37 in charge of a Merry-go-round train group of coal hoppers, freshly loaded from Deep Navigation Colliery, April 1987 Located adjacent to Quakers Yard railway station, the colliery had access to Cardiff Docks via both the Great Western's Taff Vale Railway, and the Midland Railway's Rhymney Railway. The Rhymney Railway also gave access north to Brecon via the Brecon and Merthyr Railway, and onwards to the Midlands via the Mid-Wales Railway. Harris had a series of private owner wagons built by the Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, which considerably reduced transport costs. In later years, British Railways Class 37 locomotives rostered from Cardiff Canton and Barry depots, were placed in charge of coal hoppers on a Merry-go-round train, to transport coal to Aberthaw power station. Disasters Due to its depth, Deep Navigation suffered various fatalities from its start of construction, with seven men dying in the six years from 1873 to 1879. But these were just 7 out of over 110 miners, who died in accidents underground at Deep Navigation between 1873 and the start of World War I in 1914. On 12 December 1884, five men descended the No.2 South shaft in a bowk to replace some . Just after the winding engine commenced, the wide braided steel flat rope broke, sending four to their deaths at the bottom of the shaft below. Thomas John Dobbs, who had been guiding the bowk down a guide rope, managed to slowly lowered himself to within hailing distance of pit bottom, and was rescued with nothing more than cuts and bruises. Following an accident investigation by HM Inspectorate of Mines, it was found that the rope had corroded, where it had been in contact with the headframe sheave wheel. But as the rope was covered with a protective coating of tar, the corrosion had gone undetected. The sheave wheels on both the No.1 and No.2 shafts at Deep Navigation were unusual, in that they were constructed of different parts that had been riveted together, not a singular wheel that had been cast. The sheaves were not replaced at Deep Navigation until 1961 (No.2 South), and 1963 (No.1 North). On 11 November 1902, five men lost their lives and two others were injured in No.2 South pit. A water extraction pipe fell away from the shaft wall, crashing onto an ascending double-decker mine cage. Carrying 32 men at the time of the accident, the dead and injured were travelling in the upper deck of the cage. Today Commemorative stone at the entrance to Parc Taff Bargoed, for the three local collieries Footbridge between the two lakes in Parc Taff Bargoed. Built on the site of the former Taff Merthyr and Deep Navigation collieries, works involved moving the slag heap tips that had formerly buried the Taff Bargoed river After all three collieries closed, the combined site was extensively redeveloped, with the former slag heaps removed. As a result, the brick tunnel in which the Taff Bargoed river had been redirected in 1873 was removed, and a landscaped parkland created either side of two new lakes. Opened in time for the Millennium, the park was named Parc Taff Bargoed, now home to many local rugby and football teams.

Early life Born in Manila on July 30, 1913 of Ilocano-Pangasinan descent, Peralta grew up in Tarlac. He finished his Bachelor of Laws degree at the University of the Philippines, graduating cum laude, in 1936. He passed the bar the same year, obtaining second place to Diosdado Macapagal. Career =Army Officer= Peralta joined the Philippine Army in 1936 as a reserve officer and was later commissioned in the regular force as second Lieutenant. His first assignment was in Cebu as Commandant of the Visayan Institute ROTC cadets, later at the Adamson University in Manila. He attended the Philippine Army Infantry School in 1940, finishing at the top of his class. War found him back in the Visayas as Chief of Operations of the 61st Division, then being mobilized in Iloilo. After the surrender of the USAFFE troops to the Japanese, Peralta, then a Colonel, organized and led the guerrillas in Panay,Lapham, R., and Norling, B., 1996, Lapham's Raiders, Lexington: The University Press of Kentucky, Romblon, Palawan, Marinduque and portions of Masbate and Mindoro, all in or bordering the Western Visayas. Col. Peralta's guerrilla forces controlled much of Panay when the Americans returned on 18 March 1945.Smith, R.R., 2005, Triumph in the Philippines, Honolulu: University Press of the Pacific, In this resistance campaign against the Japanese, Peralta displayed his exemplary leadership, competence and gallantry in action. For this he was awarded the Distinguished Service Star. The United States government conferred on him the Distinguished Service Cross and the Silver Star. The Distinguished Service Cross was presented to him on Panay, soon after liberation, as can be seen in this video on YouTube of the Panay landing taken by the Army Pictorial Service. Returning to military control in 1945, he was subsequently sent to the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in the United States for advanced studies. He came home with a special commendation from the commandant of the school for his \\"brilliant and unexcelled scholastic record\\". Late in 1945, he was promoted to Brigadier General, and was designated Deputy Chief of Staff of the Philippine Army. He resigned from the Army in 1946 and was appointed by President Manuel Roxas as Chairman of the Philippine Veterans Board, a position he served until 1949. With the Magsaysay Mission to the United States which he helped organize, he was able to obtain substantial benefits for the disabled veterans. Again, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Star by the Philippine government for this mission. At 36, he ran for the Philippine Senate and was elected in 1949 under the Liberal Party. Among his achievements at the Senate were the expose of the Tambobong- Buenavista estate deal; procurement of supplies and equipment for the Filipino troops in Korea, so called Philippine Expeditionary Forces to Korea (PEFTOK); legislation giving veterans priority in employment and others. In 1955, he was elected as one of the outstanding senators when his Senate term ended, Peralta returned to law practice. It was President Macapagal who persuaded him to handle the defense portfolio, a position he had twice refused after the \\"exemplary devotion to duty and for being the most valuable cabinet member\\" in the first year of the Macapagal administration. The President also appointed him head of the Philippine Virginia Tobacco Administration (PVTA). He was awarded by the Confederation of Filipino Veterans (CONVETS) for distinguished service to Filipino veterans. He was a recipient of the Gold Cross Medal for gallantry in action in Panay. Personal life and death Peralta was married to Natividad Kasilag of Batangas with whom he had three children - Macario III, Cecilia, and Engelbert. He died on January 7, 1975 and is buried at the Balantang Memorial Cemetery National Shrine in Jaro, Iloilo City.

He was a saint soldier of the Khalsa Shaheedan Misl and head of the Budha Dal in the early 19th century. He was also a senior general in the Sikh Khalsa Army and commander of the irregular Nihang of the army. He played a role in uniting Sikh misls in Amritsar. He was not afraid of the British who at many times ordered for his arrest but were not successful. During his later years he served for the Sikh Empire as a direct adviser to Maharajah Ranjit Singh. He remained an army general in many famous Sikh battles up until his martyrdom in the battle of Naushera. He was admired by the local people and had a great influence over the land and his settlement was always open to help the poor and helpless. He was well known and was a humble unique leader and prestigious warrior with high character. He was also known for his effort to maintain the values of Gurmat and the Khalsa panth. Biography =Childhood= Akali Baba Naina Singh taught Akali Phula Singh from around the age of ten. Akali Phula Singh was born in 1761 in a Jat family, to father Sardar Ishar Singh. After his father's death Akali Phula Singh, who was still young, and his elder brother, Baba Sant Singh, were taken care of by Mahant Balram and under his mother's advice he would then later be taken under the apprentice of Akali Baba Naina Singh, the leader of the Shaheedan Misl, and his Nihang order at Anandpur Sahib. It was from Baba Naina Singh that he would receive initiation into the Khalsa. Akali Phula Singh memorized the Nitnem (The writings of the Sikh Gurus which are recited daily by a Sikh) at a young age. As a child he would not eat until he completed memorizing a certain portion of the Sikh Guru's writings and in this way he had the Akal Ustat, 33 Savaiye, and other Sri Mukhwak Bani memorized. Around the age of fourteen Akali Phula Singh's mother also passes away leaving him with the dying wishes of being virtuous, upholding dharma, helping the poor, serving the Panth, in the heart being at the refuge of the Guru, being unaffected by Moh, being a role model on the battlefield, and following the footsteps of his ancestors. This had a great impact on Akali Phula Singh who then gave away his land and his possessions to the poor to start to live the life of a Nihang Saint Soldier. He became very close to Akali Naina Singh's jatha at Anandpur Sahib where he completed his martial arts training and fought many battles. As he began to recite Gurbani with a near perfect pronunciation and began to display great dharmic strength he was made the jathedar of the Shaheedan Misl. He did considerable Seva at Anandpur Sahib which included protecting the Gurdwara from thieves and preparation of langar until eventually the Gurdwara was reformed. =Stay in Amritsar= The Jathedar of Amritsar Akal Bunga (Akal Takht), Amritsar became the headquarters of the Akali jatha. Upon hearing of news of lack of maintenance and other neglect by sevadars of the Gurdwaras in Amritsar Akali Phula Singh came to Amritsar in 1800 at this time he had under his leadership a band of about 2,000 Nihangs. He stopped the mismanagement and actively began reforming many Gurdwaras within Amritsar to the point he became responsible and accepted as being in charge of the maintenance of all Gurdwaras in the area. He did Kar Seva at the holy sorawar at Harmindar Sahib and overall cleaning of the complex with the help of about 100,000 pilgrims this lasted for about 2 months. Later in his life he made similar improvements to Sri Muktsar Sahib, Anandpur Sahib, and Damdama Sahib. Seeing Akali Phula Singh's high character and dedication, the Sangat made him the Jathedar of the Akal Takht which was initiated by the Panj Pyare. Meeting the Maharaja Ranjit Singh Akaki Phula Singh remained a prominent member of the court of Maharajah Ranjit Singh. At the beginning of the nineteenth century Amritsar was ruled by the Bhangi Misl under Mai Sukhan and other Sikh Sirdars. Ranjit Singh of the Sukerchakia Misl had recently acquired the capital of Punjab, Lahore. When he approached Amritsar wanting to add it to his empire it created a problem for the ruling families of the city. In 1801 Maharajah Ranjeet Singh brought his army and the Bhangi Misl fortified Amritsar preparing for battle. There was a brief shelling where Ranjit Singh fired empty rounds into the sky in the respect of the holy city. Akali Phula Singh saw this and was saddened by the event and right when the battle was imminent he intervened between the two Sikh forces in the middle of the battlefield. He said that it was a sin for a Sikh to kill another Sikh and it was also a sin to fire cannons in Amritsar and succeeded in persuading them to stop fighting. The two parties made peace under Akali Phula Singh's advice. Ranjit Singh asked Akali Phula Singh to join his forces and he agreed, Akali Phula Singh with him added about 2,000 to 3,000 Nihangs to join the government army. Many of Ranjit Singh's future victories would be due to Akali Phula Singh and his army. Battle of Kasur Kasur falls in fairly close proximity to Lahore and there were many Pathan-Sikh wars fought earlier between the two neighbouring empires. Previously Emperor Nizamuddin Khan agreed after battle to subdue to the Sikh empire. Nizamuddin however then broke his vow and was defeated again with Ranjit Singh forgiving him once again allowing Nizamuddin to control Kasur again. The next Nawab of Kasur and Nizamuddin son, Qutbuddin Khan, was mistreating the Sikhs and Hindus in his state and charging extra tax on them he eventually called a Jihad on the Sikh Kingdom. In February 1807 Qutbuddin Khan with the help of the Multan Nawab, Musafar Khan, gathered thousands of soldiers in Kasur where there was a big fort. Akali Phula Singh and his jatha were called to Lahore by Maharaja Ranjit Singh to fight in Kasur, Jodh Singh Ramgarhia and Hari Singh Nalwa were also called in. Akali Phula Singh and his soldiers led the attack on the Muslim Ghazis on the morning of 10 February 1807. Two battles were fought outside the city and the Singhs won both. Qutbuddin retreated to his fort as he had nowhere to go. For one full month the Sikh cannons fired at the walls of the fort. The Sikh Army broke a hole through in a section of the wall by putting gunpowder underneath the fort doors. Akali Phula Singh and his Nihangs were the first to charge through the breach and after hand-to-hand fighting the Sikhs gained victory. Qutbuddin tried to run away but was soon caught. After begging for mercy Maharaja Ranjit Singh forgave him and give the Nawab a jagir of land at Mamdot, near the Sutlej River and Lahore. Kasur was made a part of Ranjit Singhs empire. After this battle Akali Phula Singh gained affection from Ranjit Singh and Akali Phula Singh became a reliable military ally. The Nihang jatha was large now and they got a jagir for Langar. At this time Akali Phula Singh and his Akalis used to ask for weapons and horses from the local leaders and if they were not given they would take them by force themselves. This stopped after Ranjit Singh gave them permission to take whatever they required from the Sikh Empire's army barracks. Encounter with Charles Metcalfe Charles Metcalfe, circa 1820 The British Civil servant Charles Metcalfe met with Ranjit Singh at Kasur and then in February 1809 arrived in Amritsar to go to Ranjit Singh's court for the signing of the Treaty of Amritsar. Metcalfe was interested in the creation of the pastili boundary and establishing an English treaty made by suffledge where boundaries will be respected between British and Sikh empires. Metcalfe came with his platoon who were composed of entirely Shia Muslims. It was the Shia Muslims commemoration of Muharram and they took it upon themselves to enact this ritual in the streets of Amritsar. The army of about 100 Muslim soldiers began beating their breasts to the chants of \\"Hassan, Hussein, Ali\\" and making much noise as they came near the Harmindar Sahib complex where Akali Phula Singh and his jatha were staying. Akali Phula Singh who was participating in the Kirtan when he heard the noise he sent three Akali Nihangs to inquire what is going on. When the Nihangs approached the Shia group and explained that they are disturbing the sacred hymns and atmosphere of the Gurdwara they were insulted by the Shia Muslims and a confrontation took place in which one of the turbans of the Nihangs fell to the ground. Akali Phula Singh on hearing this news came to the Muslims. With a few Nihangs he confronted and attacked the Muslims and shots were fired at their procession. Maharajah Ranjit Singh heard of the battle going on and arrived however he could not stop the rowdy Nihangs and it was after some time that the violence quelled. Akali Phula Singh killed and wounded a large amount of the Muslims and made them apologize and agree to not make noise near the Gurdwara again. It was likely the entire platoon would have been killed if it weren't for Mahajah Ranjit Singh conveying to the Akalis to stop the fighting. Maharajah sent the Muslims back to their camp and went to meet Metcalfe where he was staying. He explained the situation and how most of Metcalfe's army was killed because of the Akali's perceived disrespect to the turban. This entire complication was settled that day and the treaty was written the next day. =Stay at Shri Damdama Sahib= Attacking a British Regiment After the Amritsar Treaty was accepted, the British Officer Captain White was sent to Punjab to survey the border line between the British and Sikh Raj. He got permission from Maharajah Ranjit Singh to set camp at that spot where he rested however he did not tell the local people what he was doing there. Around 1799 Akali Phula Singh arrived at Damdama Sahib for maintenance of Gurdwaras in the area and the starting of Gurbani recitation samagam. Here he heard the news that there was a British Regiment who wanted to capture neighboring land and were preparing maps nearby. It was also said that Captain White was mistreating the local people and displaying poor conduct. The Nihangs could not bear the British forces trying to enter Punjab for any reason. Akali Phula Singh with an army of hundreds of Nihangs arrived at the campsite of the British Regiment. Without negating or explaining the situation the British Regiment took out their arms and prepared for conflict. The British regiment of about 150 soldiers were quickly defeated besides the commanding officer the entire regiment ran off to a different village. The Nihangs looted their tents and tore up their maps. Captain White's army suffered 6 soldiers casualties and 20 wounded. While the situation was occurring news was told to Raja Jaswant Singh of Nabha who then sent his nephew to explain the situation to Akali Phula Singh. The British again issued a warrant for the arrest of Akali Phula Singh. =Advice for the Maharajah= Disapproval of Europeanisation of the Sikh Army Akali Phula Singh. gouache, with oxidised gold Akali Phula Singh did not like that Maharajah Ranjit Singh replaced the Bani (Language) and Bana (Clothing) of the traditional Sikh appearance blessed by the Sikh gurus, as the national army military drills were now being done in French and the traditional Bana dress was replaced with European clothing. Akali Phula Singh disapproved the treaty that Ranjit Singh created with the British Raj as he had wanted the Sikh Empire to retake all of India from the British. The Maharajah then calmed the warrior by telling him they would first subdue the Punjab, Kashmir and Tibet before taking on the British. Akali Phula Singh was also strongly against the Dogras holding any position in the government and wanted every on to be Khalsa as per Guru Gobind Singh's 52 Hukams. =Stay at Anandpur Sahib= Akali Phula Singh got into conflict with the Dogra courtiers and Brahmin officials and blamed them for causing distress and damage to Sikh Government. The courtiers were also opposing Prince Kharak Singh and Prince Sher Singh. They made it hard for Akali Phula Singh to meet with the Maharajah Ranjit Singh nor did they tell the Maharajah Ranjit Singh his requests. Akali Phula Singh admitted himself into the fort where Ranjit Singh was without the Dogra Officials or Brahmin Officials permission. He tried to persuade the Maharajah to abandon the corrupt Dogras and corrupt Brahmanis but Ranjit Singh refused. He stated that to Ranjit Singh that he was not inline with Sikhi and Gurmat and not respecting the Sikh empire that was given to him by the blessing of Maharajah Guru Gobind Singh and thus he is not happy living under this rule and with this he left Ranjit Singh. In 1814 Akali Phula Singh left his Nihanghan di Chhaoni in Amritsar and arrived in Anandpur Sahib, which was near British land and the British did not like this and saw him as a major threat. Akali Phula Singh and his Shaheedan Misl opened up a dera here. Protection of Kanowar Partap In 1813 prince Kanowar Partap of Jind acquired the Kingdom of Jind from his father's will. However, the will was not accepted by the British government. Kanowar Partap revolted by taking the Jind fort over and thus the British wanted him captured. Under distress alongside with his father the prince came at the refuge of Akali Phula Singh's camp in Anandpur. The British sent an order to Akali Phula Singh and wanted him to send back the prince so he could be arrested or else prepare for war. Akali Phula Singh refused to break his vow to protect the prince and maintained that under the ideals of the Khalsa it was a sin for the Khalsa to refuse someone who has come for help and then relies on you to fix the problem. The British messaged Ranjit Singh asking him for his help on the troublesome Jathadar and wanted to remove him from the near proximity of British territory. The Dogras and Brahmins courtiers sent a reply from the Sikh Government to try to arrest Akali Phula Singh and thus Diwan Moti Ram's army was sent to arrest Akali Phula Singh. However, when the army arrived each soldier refused their orders and refrained to proceed with the action out of respect for Akali Phula Singh. Ram Kud Singh's army was paid to attack Akali Phula Singh but they laid down their weapons saying they cannot attack this great holy man. A similar attempt happened a second time on British requests to Raja Jaswant Singh of Nabha and their requests to Nawab of Malerkotla to subdue Akali Phula Singh. When Jaswant Singh Nabha forces arrived they laid down their weapons saying they won't attack. Finally Ranjit Singh sent the saint Baba Sahib Singh Bedi to bring back Akali Phula Singh to Amritsar and tell him he was sorry about his conduct and that all of Akali Phula Singhs plans will slowly implemented into the Government. Thus Akali Phula Singh returned to Amritsar and on his return he received 50 horses, two elephants, weapons, and wealth from the Maharajah. Akali Phula Singhs army of 3,000 Nihangs were given a newly constructed building under the title of Nihang Choni to stay, and more wealth and a jagir for their sewa of langar. =Battle of Multan= Maharajah Ranjit Singh fought numerous battles in Multan from 1802 to 1818. In 1805 Muzaffar Khan Sadozi stopped paying taxes to the Sikh Kingdom but eventually after military defeat agreed to pay them this happened again and again at a few different occasions through the years. The last battle of 1818 is of prime significance when Muzaffar Khan again stopped paying taxes and finally flew the Jihad flag against Khalsa and called the Muslims of the adjoining territories of help. The 25,000 Sikh soldiers sent to Multan were led by Hari Singh Nalwa with Mokham Chand secondary in charge. Akali Phula Singh and the Shaheedan Dal along with the reinforcements of Nihung under Sadhu Singh and the power of Zamzama Bhangianwala Toap played a big role in this battle and was inspiration for the Sikh soldiers to fight bravery. The Sikhs begin preparing for the battle in January 1818 and the battle was fought from March to June later that year. The Indus River was used to transport heavy artillery. Akali Phula Singh brought his jatha and joined the Sikh army soon after Kharak Singh also bought his forces. Prince Kharak Singh urged Akali Phula Singh to rest but Akali Phula Singh disagreed and said we will properly rest after taking over the fort. Muzaffar Khan had about 13,000 troops inside the famous Multan Fort. The Sikhs first captured Khangarh and Muzaffargarh. The Sikhs then besieged the Multan fort. Arrangements were made for an appeal to stop the war and to give Muzaffar jagirship elsewhere but Muzaffar backed out at the final stages. There was rally of many attacks from the Sikh heavy guns but each time the breaches were quickly filled by the Afghans. Hundreds of Sikhs continued to lose their lives as battle prevailed. At a time of rest Sadhu Singh Akali dashed near a breach in the wall killed the Pathan guards and entered the fort. Shouting Sat Sri Akal the other Sikh soldiers rushed behind him. Hand to hand sword fighting now was striking inside the fort. Muzaffar Khan and five of his sons were killed while his remaining two sons were imprisoned and then later given 2,400 rupees and a large piece of land near Sukherpaur. The Sikh army suffered about 1,900 casualties and 12,000 Muslims were killed by 4,000 Sikhs. Multan was incorporated into the Sikh empire. This victory meant that there was no longer any Afghan presence in Punjab and also the Sikhs gained a major centre of trade. Maharajah Ranjit celebrated for eight days and freely distributed wealth throughout both Lahore and Amritsar. Akali Phula Singh fought so hard that when he returned his hand swelled up so much that his sword handle was stuck to his hand and had to be removed with great difficulty only upon his return. He also had to stitch up some minor war wounds, but quickly recovered. =Advancement to Attock= The Attock Fort Upon the assassination of Fateh Khan and the civil disruption that evaded the Kabul region Maharajah Ranjit Singh took advantage of the situation and advanced his army to Attock in October 1818. The Maharajah himself led the expedition to bring the rebellious Pathans under control. A bridge of boats was constructed across the river Attock and a small jatha was sent to assess the situation, but the jatha was attacked. This enraged the Maharaja. He sent Akali Phula Singh and general Hari Singh Nalwa to fight against the rebels. As soon as the Sikh army was within firing range, they were showered with a rain of bullets. Akali Phula Singh ordered a tactical retreat. This coaxed the rebels from their bunkers to expel the retreating Sikhs. When the enemy was in the open battlefield, Akali Phula Singh ordered a severe attack and then encircled them. Their commander Feroze Khan accepted his defeat and requested the Sikhs to end the battle. The rulers of Khatkha surrendered themselves to the Khalsa forces and thus were spared. The next day, the remaining Khalsa army and Maharajah Sahib came across the river and camped there. Small contingents were stationed in the forts of Khairabad and Jahangira. The Sikh army then proceeded towards Peshawar. =Takeover of the Kashmir Suba= Kashmir was a territory that Maharajah Ranjit Singh wanted to capture for some time but never had the opportunity to do so. In 1819 upon hearing the news of the Kashmir people under distress from Pandit Birbal Dhar Ranjit, Singh decided to invade the region. The Sikh forces first attacked Aziz Khan who had broken the terms of the treaty with the Khalsa raj. After a short battle Aziz Khan submitted to the Sikh forces and gave directions and information about the Kashmir region for their upcoming expedition. Special care was taken to ensure that the people of Kashmir were not harmed during the conflict. The people of Kashmir were unaccustomed to such hospitality and preservation of their property from foreign invaders. The Nihungs played a special role in this battle and after trekking through rough terrain and leaving their horses behind the Akali jatha reached Bayram Gela. They met with the rulers of the area. Meer Mohamand Khan and Mohamand Ali Khan submitted to the Khalsa empire however Jabardast Khan refused to submit and join the empire and prepared for war. The Sikhs quickly attacked and besieged Jabardast Khan's fort. They destroyed the doors with gunpowder. Using their swords, the Akalis attacked the Pathans. Chenkhar Khan and his soldiers were arrested and after taking complete control of the fort, the Akalis left the area, leaving a few Singhs stationed behind. After a few days of rest they prepared to take over Peer Punchal using a variety of routes and roads. When the Pathans learned that the Akali army was wandering through the area they brought out their armies and blocked off both sides of the mountains on the route. Upon arriving on the scene both sides began to fire at each other but since the Pathans were on higher ground, the Sikh firing was ineffective. Akali Phula Singh ordered his troops to ascend the mountain. Upon ascent, the enemies attacked and a sword battle ensued until night. On nightfall the Pathans fled from the mountain. The Akalis set up their campsite as well as a fire atop the mountain and departed forwards in the morning. Then the Akalis reached Saria Ali and met with the rest of the Sikh army via the Pir Panjal Range route. =Battle of Shopian= From the town of Saria Ali the Sikhs learned Jabbardast Khan gathered an army of 5,000 Afghani Soldiers and blocked of the route to Shopian. Dewan Mokham Chand told his plans on how to approach the upcoming battle. On 29th Harh (Bikrami Samat) they attacked the enemy from both sides with gunfire. The Sikhs then began to squeeze the enemy closer and closer from both sides. The Afghanis were able to attack Dewan Chand's regiment and took from him 3 cannons. Akali Phula Singh when he saw Diwan Chand backing up and the Afghanis charging forward advanced his jatha from the right side for a quick sword to sword combat attack, though Jabardast fought bravely the Afghani army could not bear the Akali's attack and ran away. All the Afghani war supplies fell to the hands of the Sikhs these supplies included food stock, cannons, gunpowder, weapons, and horses. The Afghanis suffered great loss in this battle in which Mehardil Khan and Meer Akoursmad Khan were killed. Jabardsast Khan was greatly injured but managed to get away. The Khalsa forces took over fort Sherghari and a few other nearby areas effectively taking over the Kashmir region. In 1879 Srinagar was captured by the Sikh forces without the looting of the civilians. Akali Phoola Singh made a Gurdwara at Srinagar, by the name of Gurdwara Bunga Akali Phulla Singh also known as Shaheed Ganj, for the Sikhs who achieved martyrdom at the battle of Shergarhi who were also cremated here. =Seva at Amritsar= The gold on the Harmandir Sahib was placed during Akali Phoola Singh's time. After the victory in Kashmir Maharajah Ranjit Singh had a Deep Mala of the entire city of Amritsar for three days and elaborate markets were set up. During this time Ranjit Singh began massively improving Harmandir Sahib and many other Gurdwaras in the region. When Ranjit Singh arrived in Lahore he had even bigger celebrations there, and thousands of rupees were distributed freely to the people. Later when Akali Phula Singh, General Diwan Chand, and Sahibjada Karak Singh arrived in Lahore great parades on elephants were arranged around the city, thousands of rupees were distributed again. Maharajah Ranjit Singh was very impressed by Akali Phula Singh performance and wanted him and his army to remain at the Lahore darbar but Akali Phoola Singh refused and preferred to live in Amritsar and perform administrative work. Akali Phula Singh told Ranjit Singh that though they will remain in Amritsar we will always be available when requested. =Battles of Peshawar= Initial takeover of Peshawar Jamrud Fort near the Khyber, 19th century Ranjit Singh got an opportunity to try to takeover the Pathan capital in 1818 after finding the Afghan frontier left open during the civil war and murder of Wazir Fateh Khan, the ruler of the Peshawar region. Initially Ranjit Singh asked Akali Phula Singh who was familiar with Attock and his surroundings for his advice regarding the situation Akali Phula Singh told him of how the Khyber Pass is used as a gateway to Punjab and a way to block alliance between Pathan and Afghani soldiers. Ranjit Singh immediately made the decision to attack. The high-ranking generals in this attack would be General Hari Singh Nalwa and Akali Phula Singh. Sirdar Yar Mohhamand Khan and Dost Mohammad Azim Khan, the Wazir of Kabul and head of the Barakzai tribe, were in charge of the city when the Sikh army approached. They quickly fled to the Yusufzai hills. After the Sikhs took over the city it was given to Jehandad Khan However, when Ranjit Singh returned to Lahore Yar Mohammad quickly reconquered the city. Ranjit Singh almost immediately sent another expedition to Peshawar. Yar Mohammad accepted the rule of the Sikh Raj and agreed to pay a tax of Rs. 50,000 to the empire. The neighbouring cities of Darband, Mankerah, Dera Ismail Khan, and Dera Ghazi Khan were also added to the Sikh Raj. Grandeur battle of Peshawar Muhammad Azim Khan In 1823 Dost Muhammad Azim Khan peacefully takes over Peshawar from his brother Sirdar Yar Mohammand Khan who was under the rule of Ranjit Singh's raj. Muhammad Azim Khan declares Jihad against the Sikh empire and Islamic religious teachers motivated around 25,000 jehadi pathans to join under Mohammad Azim Khan army. Ranjit Singh preparing to recapture the ancient city sent 2,000 horsemen under Kanwar Sher Singh and Diwan Kirpa Ram to check the advance of Afghans. Another army division was sent under Hari Singh Nalwa to help the first group. Next Maharajah alongside Akali Phula Singh, Sardar Desa Singh Majithia, Sardar Fateh Singh Ahluwalia joined and reached Attock. Sher Singh and Hari Singh crossed the Attock river via a boat bridge and took over the Jahangira fort after a small battle. Mohammmad Azim Khan dispatched an army of Ghazis under Dost Muhammad Khan and Jabbar Khan to fight against the Sikhs near Jahangira. Mohammad Azim Khan also destroyed the boat bridge at Attock so Maharajah Ranjit Singh and his army would not be able to cross. Maharajah Ranjit Singh started construction of new bridge but he quickly received the news that a force of Ghazis had encircled his army across the river and the Khalsa army had a chance of being wiped out there. Maharajah Ranjit Singh ordered the army to swim across the river and the Sikh forces were successful with little loss of men and luggage and Maharajah Ranjit Singh reached Jahangira. During this time Jai Singh Attariwala who had left the Sikh Army in 1821 and joined Azim Khan came back to Ranjit Singh who instantiated him into his former rank. Here the army was strategically divided into three formations. 800 cavalry and 700 infantry soldiers was placed under Akali Phula Singh. Martyrdom Akali Hanuman Singh mural at Baba Atal Sahib The army prepared to storm Peshawar and Sikh army come together to do an Ardas to Akal Purakh asking for their victory and to formalize their upcoming departure to the battlefield. Upon the completion of the ceremony Ranjit Singh heard news of the delay of General Ventura and the Sikh artillery and cannons so he told his army to stop and tried to tell the Nihang army to stop the planned attack. Akali Phula Singh refused to break the Khalsa's Gurmata made in the presence of Guru Granth Sahib to fight tonight and to fight to the last without turning back. He told Ranjit Singh to do what he may with his army but the Nihangs are leaving for battle now and won't turn back. The Akalis thus entered the battlefield first. The Nihangs charged at the army on horseback but when they reached the army they abandoned their horses and fought through the enemies with swords. Ranjit Singh seeing the Nihangs successful charge and also seeing how the Nihangs were outnumbered on the battlefield ordered the rest of the army to enter the battlefield. Prince Kharak Singh's army now charged at the enemy and General Ventura had now also arrived. Ranjit Singh ordered General Balu Bahadur's Gurkha army to attack the enemy from behind. In the Uoper Desh region after severe hand-to- hand combat Akali Phula Singh was wounded in the leg so he came back to fight on a horse. Whilst fighting on horse his horse got shot so he came back to the battlefield on in howdah on the elephant upon which he would be fired down and attain martyrdom. Around this time General Ventura, Hari Singh Nalwa, and Sirdar Budh Singh attacked Muhammad Azim Khan's army. When the Ghazis heard that Azim Khan ran away they lost hope and were quickly defeated. The Sikhs chased away any surviving enemies and after winning the battle the news of Akali Phula Singhs death spread around the army. Ranjit Singh with tears in his eyes along with the other Sirdars reached where Akali Phula Singh's body was lying in the howdah. Ranjit Singh covered his body with a shawl and returned to his campsite in dismay. The next day Akali Phula Singh was cremated and his ashes deposited in the Lunda river. Akali Phula Singh was succeeded by Jathedar Baba Hanuman Singh Nihang. Life as a Nihang leader A photograph of an Akali Nihang Sikh taken during the 1860s. The Akali is wearing the characteristically recognisable turban. The Mazhabi Sikhs dominated this order throughout the 18th and 19th centuries.McQueen. J.W and Baaghaa. A.S (1994) Unseen faces and untold cases, heroes and villains of Sikh rule, Volume 8 of Series in Sikh history and culture. Bahri Publications p106 19th century Shamshir sword. Nihangs carry the traditional longer-length kirpans. Akali Phula Singh helped solidate many of the ideals of the Guru Khalsa created by Guru Gobind Singh. He was a strict follower of Amrit Vela and the Sri Guru Granth Sahib and paid high importance to do Asa Ki Var daily As a Nihang sevadar he paid his due to act upon Dharma on the populous. Nihangs do not find it necessary to obey the law of the land nor do they believe in law of property or any subjection of any kind. Akali Phula Singh made it routine to steal a lot of wealth and weapons from rich rulers until he was confronted by Maharajah Ranjit Singh for the act after which whatever Akali Phula Singh required was provided by Maharajah Ranjeet Singh. The Nihangs aim to be at Selfless service (seva) of the world though they are especially generous to the poor and weak. Akalis are known to be of great integrity and they are known to not break their hukam. Nihangs often slept on horses many days at time and it is their rule to be always on the move and to not stay at the same place for too long. They prefer the sword over gun but are also trained to be excellent marksmen. In warfare they are the first to attack and usually do not retreat in battle, rather they just keep charging. They do cries of Akal Akal loudly. Akali Phula Singh enforced all the qualities of the ideal Nihang. Some prominent English Sikh scholars were against Akali Phola Singh like Max MacAuliffe. Many of the English writers also ignore the Nihangs victories and on often attribute Dogras to substitute when Nihangs fought battles. Akali Phula Singh talked in a unique slang-like Punjabi which was not understood by the British and often misinterpreted. =Punishment of Ranjit Singh= Statue of Akali Phula Singh outside the Partition Museum in Amritsar. The sovereignty of Akali Phula Singh's Khalsa Panth over Ranjit Singh was made clear on a particular event when Ranjit Singh brought dancers for his grandson's wedding. The community was upset with Ranjit Singh for this action. When Ranjit Singh visited Amritsar for his daily listening of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib nobody spoke to him. Ranjit Singh could not bear nobody talking to him so he asked for forgiveness. Akali Phula Singh being the leader of the panth ordered Ranjit Singh to be flogged and he immediately agreed. Upon getting in the position to receive the whipping with a naked back and leaning against the tamarind tree in front of the Akal Bunga (Akal Takht) Akali Phula Singh asked if it was enough that the Maharajah was ready to receive the punishment and should be forgiven without getting the actual whipping. He asked the Sangat who had gathered around if they agreed that he should be forgiven that they should respond with the Sat Sri Akal battle cry in response the entire Sangat cried out Sat Shri Akal in approval. Legacy & Culture Akali Phula Singh's samadhi was built at Pir Sabaq, 8 km from Nowshera to Attock, where he was martyred. It had a large piece of land attached to it and was a popular place of visit for Sikhs, Hindus, and Pathans especially during Vaisakhi and Dussehra. The Nihangs served langar there up until the creation of India. Akali Phula Singh's land in Amritsar is still run by the Nihangs at the Akali Phula Singh Burj which was built by Maharajah Ranjit Singh himself as a tribute to Akali Phula Singh. The total land attached to Akali Phula Singh Burj was originally over 13 acres but now that number has been greatly reduced.

Situated in the western part of Maysville, Kentucky, United States, the downtown is defined by a grid of streets laid out parallel to the northwest-southeast curve of the Ohio River. The area is essentially rectangular, four and a half blocks long and two to two and a half blocks wide. Its western edge is marked by Wall Street and its northern extent by West Front Street and McDonald Parkway. Its eastern and southern boundaries generally conform to the rear property lines of buildings on the east side of Limestone Street and the south side of Third Street respectively. In 1982, when the National Register application was completed, the Maysville downtown contained 155 buildings, as well as one cemetery and notable street sculpture. The buildings served a variety of functions. About 62% or 96 of the buildings were devoted primarily to commercial use, while 28% or 43 were residential. The district also included five churches, two theaters, one high school complex, one library, one museum and five governmental buildings, including the county courthouse and jail. All buildings were structurally sound and together achieved a first floor occupancy rate of 98%. Of the 155 buildings in the district, 135 or 87% were constructed prior to 1930 and 92% are of brick. Two building types may be identified which characterize the Maysville downtown. The first appeared in the early 19th century, generally between 1825 and 1850, The two-to three-story brick residential building of this era display trabeated openings, crow-stepped gable ends and a simplicity of exterior detail. Such structures often share bearing walls as components of residential \\"rows.\\" The second type, a three to six story brick commercial building type was constructed in Maysville from about 1875 to the First World War. The key elements of the type are the bracketed cornice, arched window cap and pilasters.

He went on to earn his PhD degree from the same school in 2001. Career Roy has developed silicon nanopore membranes (SNM) to achieve high-efficiency blood ultrafiltration while selectively retaining specific solutes and serving as an immunoprotective barrier for encapsulated cells. The SNM are the fundamental underlying technology for the development of an implantable bioartificial kidney. Using this technology, he is now developing an implantable bioartificial pancreas (iBAP). Previous attempts to develop a bioartificial pancreas have been severely limited by insufficient mass transfer and a limited supply of beta cells, but Roy says that ultra-high hydraulic permeability characteristic of the SNM will enable appropriate mass transport (especially oxygen, glucose, and insulin) to achieve optimal beta cell performance, while the ultra-selective pore characteristic of the SNM enable unprecedented immunoisolation. Also the iBAP can utilize a human stem cell derived fully functional beta cell that provides and unlimited supply of beta cells.

Description Corymbia haematoxylon is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, tessellated, brownish bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped to broadly lance-shaped, petiolate leaves. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, paler on the lower surface, lance-shaped to narrow egg- shaped, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oblong to oval, long and wide with a flattened operculum. Flowering occurs from October or December to January or March and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody urn-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming Mountain marri was first formally described in 1914 by Joseph Maiden who gave it the name Eucalyptus haematoxylon and published the description in Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales.

It has rough, grey, brown or black \\"ironbark\\" on its trunk and branches. The leaves on young plants and on coppice regrowth are egg-shaped, triangular or more or less round, bluish grey, long, wide and have a petiole. Adult leaves are the same dull bluish grey on both sides, sometimes with a powdery bloom, egg-shaped to lance-shaped, long, wide on a petiole long.

Flowering mainly occurs between September and November and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody barrel-shaped or conical capsule long and wide on a pedicel long with the valves below the rim. Taxonomy Eucalyptus caleyi was first formally described by Joseph Maiden in 1906 and the description was published in Volume 2 of his book The Forest Flora of New South Wales. In 1991, Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill described two subspecies: * Eucalyptus caleyi subsp. caleyi that has rounded fruit; * Eucalyptus caleyi subsp. ovendenii that has quadrangular fruit. Subspecies caleyi has a number of synonyms. The specific epithet (caleyi) honours George Caley and the epithet ovendenii honours Peter John Ovenden (1929–1997), a forester who first recognised the subspecies later named after him as distinct. Distribution and habitat Caley's ironbark grows on low hills, ridges and broad undulating valleys in dry forest and woodland. It grows from near Denman and the Goulburn River through the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales to the Millmerran area in south-eastern Queensland. Ovenden's ironbark, (subspecies ovendenii) is restricted to more elevated sites to the west of Tenterfield.

Hence these devotional ancient architectures often reflect various socio-cultural aspects of society of the time. # Mukhya Sthapati : The Chief Architect, The master of the Shilpa Shastras, Vastu Shastra, Dharma Shastra, Agni Purana and Mathematical Calculations. Besides being a very knowledgeable person he is also a very pious man. He translates the Kartā's vision into an architectural design based on stipulations. # Sutra Grahaṇi : The Chief Engineer (can be equated) as he is the person who translates the architecture into actual geometrical dimensions. He is equally proficient in all the required knowledge and most often is the son of the Mukhya Sthapati. # Bārdhanikas : The masons, the stone setters # Takṣaka : The sculptor with hands that create poetry in stone does all the magnificent carvings and engravings of various forms that has left us spell bound. Besides these primary set of specialists, various supportive functions are carried out by other people. =Material selection= Primarily certain classes of stones are considered auspicious for the construction of Kalinga deula (temples). Shilpa Chandrika, an ancient architecture book define some specific seven varieties of stone as ideal and specific types are used for certain portions of the temple : # Sahaṇa # Chhita Sāhaṇa # Baḍa Pagaḍa # Dhobā Kuṇḍa # Rasa Chiṇḍa # Niḷa Kusāṇa Though clay bricks have been used in very rare cases most Kalingan temples are built using these stones. =Site Selection= Various aspects like type of soil, shape of the Plot, location of the plot, availability and type of space and ground water level, etc. are taken into consideration while selecting the site. Color, density, composition and moisture content of the soil discriminates between the best, middle, sub-middle and worst kind of soil. Based on Vastu Shastra, a rectangular, square, elliptical or circular plot of land is selected in order of preference. = Naga Bāndhēṇi = This is an intricate and very old method in Shilpa Shastra, by which the temple's direction and the auspicious moment for beginning the sacred construction is determined. Like the present day Geomorphology, Seismology, Topology etc., probably this is some ancient science which guides the architect to understand natural forces and build stable massive structures in Odisha. = Scale Model = The Mukhya Sthaptya (Main Sculptor similar to Chief Architect) creates a scale model based on traditional stipulations and takes the Karta's (producer / financier) approval. In many instances we see such depictions on walls and motifs.  Potā and piṭha (Mobile Foundation) By observing conventional masonry and going through the following steps of the preparation of potā and piṭha the foundation of a temple could be understood: # A square or rectangular area is dug out depending on the type and combination of temple proposed at the center of the preselected Nāgabandhani plot of land. # The depth of this Potā is 1/3 of the height of the proposed temple, from plinth level. # The length and width of this Potā (pit) is always sufficiently broader than the diameter of the proposed temple. # Hard stone slabs are laid at the bottom to create a level. # Then with uniformly cut hard stones, the four walls of the Potā are erected and the outer perimeter space between the pit wall and ground is properly filled with soil. # The Asṭadala Padma Chakaḍā (Eight lotus petal shaped), is then laid at the exact spot required. This is a square or rectangular shape of hard uniform stone slab at the center of which an eight petaled lotus shape in exact geometric proportions is engraved. The petals are aligned to the north, north-east, east, southeast, south, south- west, west and north-west. The exact perpendicular line through the center of this Asṭadala Padma Chakaḍā determines the axis (rekhā/meru) of the temple. The traditional method of such alignment is termed as Sanku. # Thereafter the Potā is properly packed up with large pieces of stone and soil, probably pressed down by elephants. # The Potā (pit) is leveled off at ground level with huge and thick cut theodolite stones. # Another layer of theodolite stones, corresponding to the shape and size of the ground plan called the piṭha is constructed. This is the base of the temple. In many instances, we see this piṭha at various levels of elevation. = Bhunaksā (the ground plan) = Keeping the Sanku (the vertical axis through the center of Asṭadala Padma Chakaḍā) as the exact center of Garbhagruha, the ground plan of the proposed temple is engraved by the Sthapati and Sutragrahaṇi with the help of a sharp edged instrument, on the perfectly leveled Piṭha. As temples in every of their details depend on proportions, complex ancient methods are used for correct geometric designing and executing the ground plan (bhunaksa) to ensure long term stability and aesthetic appearance of these huge structures. Simplicity or intricacy of the temple is reflected in this ground plan.Thereafter, the Bardhanikas set about precut stones, under the strict vigilance of Sutragrahaṇi as per the Bhunaksa, deula gaddanni has started.  Deuḷa (Temple of Odisha)  Temple architecture in Odisha evolved over a long period of time. Stipulated architectural principles with ample provision for artistic improvisation enabled the progressive generations. Temples in Odisha are based on certain fundamental principles of stability and take their cue from the human body. The superstructure is basically divided into three parts, the Bāḍa (Lower Limb), the Ganḍi (Body) and the Cuḷa/Mastaka (Head). Accordingly, each part is given a different treatment throughout, from the architecture to the final ornamentation of the Temple. Temples in Odisha in the classic local style very often have a figure of Gajalaxmi in lalitasana as their lalatabimba or central protective image over the doorway to a temple or the sanctuary of one. =Classification= Image:Konark Sub Temple Front view.jpgKonark Sun Temple, one of the most well renowned temples in India, a World Heritage Site. the tower has collapsed in the past.

He was the first Secretary of the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, a post which he held until his death in 1927. He established the Udbodhan house in the Bagbazar area of Calcutta, which was built primarily for the stay of Sri Sarada Devi in Calcutta, from where he used to publish the Bengali magazine Udbodhan. There he wrote Sri Sri Ramakrishna Lilaprasanga in Bengali, on the life of Ramakrishna, which was translated into English as Sri Ramakrishna, the Great Master. Biography =Early years= Sarat Chandra Chakravarti (b. 23 December 1865) was born in Amherst Street Calcutta to a rich and orthodox Brahmin family. His cousin was Shashi, later known as Ramakrishnananda. His grandfather was a Sanskrit scholar with a religious disposition. Sarat Chandra's father was the co-owner of a pharmacy and was very rich. After his initiation according to the customs of the Hindu Brahmin caste he worshipped regularly in the family shrine.The Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna (1943), published by Advaita Ashrama, Mayawati. He sometimes would give away his personal belongings to the poor and needy. Sarat Chandra helped the ill, even if they had contagious diseases.RKM Fiji He nursed a poor maid servant who was left to die by her master as she suffered from cholera, and also performed her last rites when she died.Swami Chetanananda, They Lived with God, Vedanta Society of St. Louis, St. Louis, 1989. As he grew up, he came under the influence of Brahmo leader Keshab Chandra Sen. He began to be actively associated with the Brahmo Samaj. In 1882 he passed the school leaving examination and was admitted to St. Xaviers College. =Influence of Ramakrishna= Group photo taken on 30 January 1887 In Baranagar Math, Kolkata. Standing: (l–r) ) Shivananda, Ramakrishnananda, Vivekananda, Randhuni, Debendranath Majumdar, Mahendranath Gupta (Shri M), Trigunatitananda, H.Mustafi Sitting: (l–r) Niranjanananda, Saradananda, Hutko Gopal, Abhedananda. In October 1883 Sarat and Shashi went to Dakshineswar to meet Ramakrishna, who was speaking to a general audience on the subject of marriage and renunciation. Sarat visited Dakshineswar temple to meet Ramakrishna every Thursday and as he got more closely acquainted with him, he began to get directions on spiritual practices. On one occasion the master had asked him, \\"How would you like to realize God?\\". The disciple replied, \\"I would not like to see any particular form of God in meditation. I want to see him manifested in all creatures of the world.\\" Sarat passed the First Arts examination in 1885. His father wanted him to study medicine. However he gave it up and devoted his time in nursing Ramakrishna, first in Shyampukur and then in Cossipore garden house, when the latter was critically ill. After the death of Ramakrishna, Sarat at first Shivananda came back to his house but then joined the Baranagar Math along with his other brother disciples, accompanied by his cousin Shashi. =Relationship with Vivekananda= Sarat had met Narendranath Dutta, who later became famous as Swami Vivekananda, and found him conceited, even before he came to Ramakrishna, in one of his friend's house. When Ramakrishna praised a certain Narendranath, Sarat expressed the desire of meeting him, and was surprised to identify him as his earlier conceited acquaintance. Their relationship soon matured into a very close friendship which lasted until death. On Narendranath's recommendation Sarat joined Calcutta Medical College to study medicine. He gave it up on hearing about Ramakrishna's illness and joined Narendra and a group of young devotees to nurse him. When he started the Ramakrishna Mission, Vivekananda made Sarat or Saradananda, its first secretary. After the death of Swami Brahmananda, the first president of Ramakrishna Math and Mission, when it was proposed to make Saradananda the next president he declined on the ground that he had been made secretary by Vivekananda and would continue in that post. =Life of a wandering ascetic= In Baranagar Math, the young monastic disciples had to go through a strenuous life of ascetism and penance, sometimes going without food and other necessities of life. Sarat Chandra would often go to meditate in Dakshineswar, sometimes, alone, at other times with Narendranath. Sarat would volunteer for jobs which needed strong labour, like sweeping, cleaning and washing, as well as nursing any indisposed brother disciple.Reminiscences of Swami Saradanandaji, by Bhuteshananda, published in Vedanta Keshari After the young disciples took formal Sannyas or renunciation, Sarat was given the name \\"Saradananda\\". Saradananda travelled to Puri and then to Northern India, including Benares, Ayodhya and Rishikesh. He also travelled to Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath, the three sacred places of pilgrimage on the Himalayas. In the course of this pilgrimage he had to sometimes go without food and even without shelter, often finding himself in perilous situation. After visiting Kedarnath, Tunganath and Badrinath, in 1890 Saradananda came to Almora and took up residence in the house of a devotee, Lala Badrinath Shah. He met Vivekananda there and together they started for Garhwal. From there he came to Rajpur near Mussouri and met Turiyananda, another brother disciple with whom he had gone to Kedarnath. He then went to Rishikesh and there at Kankhal met Brahmananda, or Rakhal Maharaj, another brother disciple. After that he first went to Meerut to meet Vivekananda and then to Delhi along with him where the later separated from his brother disciples. Only after six years Saradananda met Vivekananda again; on his bidding Saradananda went to London to preach Vedanta. From Delhi he went to Benaras and stayed there for some time, met Swami Abhedananda, another brother disciple, and also initiated a young monk, who was later named as Swami Sacchidananda. He fell ill with blood dysentery in Benares and came back to the Baranagar monastery in 1891. Subsequently, after recovering he traveled to Jayrambati, the birthplace of Sri Sarada Devi, where she was staying. Later he came back to Calcutta and the monastery of Ramakrishna shifted to Alambazar, a place near Dakshineswar in 1892. In 1893 the news reached the brothers of the success of Vivekananda in the Parliament of the World's Religions, in Chicago. Vivekananda then called for the participation of his brother disciples in his mission of preaching Vedanta to West and raising money for welfare activities in India. Saradananda responded to his call and traveled for London in 1896. =Preaching Vedanta in the West= Saradananda delivered a few lectures in London but was soon sent to New York where the Vedanta Society was established. He was invited to be a teacher at the Greenacre Conference of Comparative Religions where he began his work with a lecture on the Vedanta and classes on Yoga. Towards the end of the conference he was invited to speak in Brooklyn, New York and Boston. At Brooklyn Ethical Association he lectured on ethical ideals of Hindus. He settled in New York to carry out the Vedanta movement in an organised way. He sailed back for India on 12 January 1898 and visited London, Paris and Rome on the way. =Ramakrishna Mission and his work= When Ramakrishna Mission was first established by Vivekananda, he made Saradananda the secretary of the Math and Mission, a post which the later held for thirty years till his death. On his return from the West, Saradananda gave a series of lectures in Albert Hall in Calcutta on Vedanta. During the early days of the organisation he came under suspicion for harbouring freedom fighters, some of whom took refuge with the organisation.Prabuddha Bharat Under the effective guidance of the Sarada Devi, Saradananda approached the then viceroy and presented his case. Thereafter the Government relented. In 1899, plague broke out in Calcutta and Ramakrishna Mission organised relief. Saradananda was involved in relief work with the help of Sister Nivedita and other brother monks of the order. In 1899 he traveled to Gujarat along with Swami Turiyananda to collect funds for the Mission and extensively toured various parts including Ahmedabad, Junagarh, Bhavnagar etc. He gave lectures in Hindi. After Vivekananda's second departure to West he also started training young monks. In December 1899 he went to Dacca, Barisal and Narayangunj on an invitation and there stayed in the house of Ashwini Kumar Dutta. He also gave many lectures. After his return to Calcutta he became interested in the Tantrika form of worship under the guidance of his uncle Ishwar Chandra Chakravarty. After this experience he wrote a book \\"Bharate Shakti Puja\\" or \\"The worship of divine mother in India\\". In 1902, after Vivekananda's death, Saradananda took up the job of managing day-to-day affairs of Belur Math and also that of editing and publishing Udbodhan, a Bengali magazine started by the former. He wrote articles, arranged for funding and supervised operations. Gradually the financial health of the magazine was restored. He constructed a house for the holy mother by taking a loan and to repay the loan started writing his magnum opus \\"Sri Sri Ramakrishna Lilaprasanga\\" or \\"Ramakrishna, the Great Master\\", a biography and life of Ramakrishna. The Udbodhan office started in the new building towards 1908. In 1909 two co-accused in Maniktola Bomb Case, Devavrata Bose and Sachindranath Sen, came to join the Ramakrishna order, giving up their political activities. Despite opposition from the senior monks and the risk of affronting the British Government, Saradananda took full responsibility and accepted both of them into the order and met highly placed Government officials for explaining his position. In 1913 under him Ramakrishna Mission started relief operations when a major flood broke out in Burdwan district of Bengal, collecting funds and organizing relief work. In 1916 he went for a pilgrimage to Gaya, Benares, Vrindaban and returned after 2 months. After the death of Sarada Devi in 1920 and Brahmananda in 1922, Saradananda gradually withdrew from active work. His primary engagement at this time was the construction of a temple for Sarada Devi in Jayrambati, and another one in Belur Math, on the place where she was cremated. The temple in Belur Math was constructed in 1921 and that in Jairambati was commissioned in April 1923. The Ramakrishna Mission Convention at Belur Math was held in 1926, a meeting of the monks of Ramakrishna Math and Mission Centres from all over the world. Saradananda gave the welcome address in which he put up a warning note of the dangers of complacency and exhorted the monks to stick to the ideals of the founding members. At the end of the convention he appointed a committee to deal with the day-to-day work of the mission. After the convention he almost retired from an active life, devoting more and more time to meditation. =Responsibility of Sarada Devi= While in the course of managing Udbodhan, He felt the need to construct a house for Sarada Devi who had to stay in the house of lay devotees in Calcutta. He bought a house in Bagbazar area and used its downstairs for publishing and running the operation of the magazine and the upstairs as the abode of Sarada Devi and her devotees, and her shrine. At that time this was known as the \\"mother's house\\" and now it is known as the \\"Udbodhan house\\". Sarada Devi came to this house for the first time on 23 May 1909. Saradananda was very devoted to her and called himself her \\"doorkeeper\\". He not only looked after her, but also after her family: brothers and nieces as well as the devotees, including many women. He bore the financial as well as other responsibilities willingly. Sarada Devi had great trust in him as she herself said that \\"It is not easy to bear my burden, only Sarat can do it.\\" Gospels of Holy Mother, by Udbodhan publishers If she suffered from illness while staying in Jairambati, her native place, Swami Saradananda would come down along with the doctor for her medical treatment. When she was terminally ill in Jairambati, he made arrangements to bring her to Calcutta where she underwent treatment for five months. He also took up all responsibilities for building her temple and shrine in Jairambati after she died. He continued to take up the responsibility of her family members till his death. =Afflictions and death= Saradananda suffered from kidney trouble in 1914. He suffered from various other ailments and after his retirement from an active life in 1926 his afflictions got more serious. On 6 August 1927, he suffered an attack which the doctors diagnosed as apoplexy. He never recovered consciousness, and died on 19 August. =Character and legacy= Compassion and kindness Saradananda was known for his calm judgement, patience and a loving heart. He had a sweet and gentle personality which won him many admirers and friends in India and in West. It is said that one day Ramakrishna, in a state of ecstasy, had sat on the lap of young Sarat and told that, I was testing how much burden he could bear. He also had great compassion for several mentally handicapped persons whom he provided for. He also took up the responsibility of nursing his brother disciples and many lay persons when they were ill. He listened to everybody with equal concern and gave importance to everybody's opinion. He was also very sensitive to the feelings of the others. Bravery and indifference He was said to be intrepid in nature. In one incident in Kashmir when the horse of the coach in which he was travelling fell into an abyss, he was saved but he never lost his equanimity and later said that he was a dispassionate observer of the incident.BuddhistLibrary.com When the ship in which he was travelling to London was caught in a cyclone in Mediterranean he watched the entire episode calmly and in a detached manner even when his copassengers were mortally afraid. He was indifferent to the apparent faults and weaknesses of the people with whom he worked. Impartiality and detachment Saradananda was also known for his impartial decisions and hence was required to resolve conflicts. He wrote the book \\"Sri Sri Ramakrishna Lila Prasanga\\" in a little room in Udbodhan house while managing the operations of the magazine, overseeing the work of Ramakrishna Mission and looking after the holy mother and devotees, in a dispassionate and detached way. After the new administrative body of Ramakrishnia Mission was formed in 1926, Saradananda completely detached himself from all activities of the Mission and took to the life of meditation and contemplation. Legacy He proved his mettle as an organiser. By the time of his death, there were many Ramakrishna Mission centres, throughout India and abroad. In addition to the regular work of the centre, there were relief works and also that of publishing the magazine Udbodhan, writing books and articles, arranging for finances, looking after the spiritual needs of the aspirants, young monks and the devotees, and also looking after the needs of the holy mother's family members. After the death of the holy mother, the women devotees found solace in his company. Once an attendant asked him about his spiritual progress, to which he replied, Did we cut grass in Dakshineswar?, referring to the period of his association with Ramakrishna. He himself mentioned that whatever he had written in the book \\"Sri Ramakrishna, the great master\\", on spiritual experiences, were through direct realisation and not from hearsay. There is a building named Saradananda Bhavana at Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama, Narendrapur and a dormitory named Saradananda Dham at Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama, Deoghar,which are consecrated in his holy name. Quotations * Through selfless work the mind gets purified. And when the mind becomes pure, there arise knowledge and devotion in it. * Whatever work stands in the way of God-realization and increases discontent is bad work. You should wholly discard it. * The Ramakrishna Mission does not like to express any opinion, good or bad, about political discussions, for the Master did not instruct us to do anything of the kind, and Swamiji asked the Mission to keep itself aloof from such effort. That is why the Mission has been all along engaging itself in spirituality and service to humanity. * Now- a-days there are so many religious societies, but people lose all interest in them after a few days. What is the reason for this? The reason is our words are not in accord with our thoughts. The first step in religion is to be sincere to the core.Saradananda, RKM Chennai  References   External links  * Swami Saradananda Biography Swami Saradananda on BuddhistLibrary.com Category:Scholars from Kolkata Category:Ramakrishna Mission Category:Indian Hindu missionaries Category:1865 births Category:1927 deaths Category:Monastic disciples of Ramakrishna Category:University of Calcutta alumni Category:19th-century Hindu religious leaders Category:20th- century Hindu religious leaders Category:19th-century Indian philosophers Category:20th-century Indian philosophers Category:Monks of the Ramakrishna Mission ","title":"Saradananda"},{"id":"33102035","title":"Akiko Solon"},{"id":"33102046","text":"The epithet the Merciful may refer to: *Ashot III (died 977), Armenian king *John the Hairy, also known as John the Merciful of Rostov, a 16th-century holy fool (yurodivy) of the Russian Orthodox Church *John the Merciful (c. 552-between 616 and 620), Patriarch of Alexandria and Christian saint Category:Epithets Category:Lists of people by nickname ","title":"List of people known as the Merciful"},{"id":"33102055","text":"Hockhockson is an unincorporated community located within Tinton Falls in Monmouth County, New Jersey, United States.

This battle fought by Zamindar of Vijayanagar against Colonel Pendargast, on behalf of the British Governor of Madras, Sir Charles Oakly. Vizianagaram Raja Chinna Vijayaramaraju died in the war. As a consequence of the war, Vizianagaram came under British rule and became Zamindari. The causes of war By 1768, the tribal areas such as Parlakimidi, Ganjam, Mohiri, Gunsuru, and Pratapagiri were ruled by 20 Zamindars. They owned 34 forts and maintained approximately 35,000 armed troops. Many of these jamindars revolted against the English East India Company. Some of the castles were located in the hills of the manyam. Therefore, the defeated rebel Zamindars were retreated into the Hill fortress After the death of Ananda Gajapatiraju, Vijayaramaraju became Rajah of the Vizianagaram Zamindari. Still he was a boy. So Sitaramaraju was appointed as divan, the son of his stepmother. When Rajah came to older age, he removed Sitaramaraju from Diwani. Diwan was angered by this action, he formed an alliance with the English. The British attempted to increase payment of peskas from Vijayanagara Zamindar and to reduce the strength of his army and ordered to pay his dues of 8,50,000 peskas. Although Rajah proved that he had no dues, the British had captured Vijayanagara on 2 August 1793. British ordered that Vijayaramaraju must go to exile Masulipatnam with the pension of Rs 1200 per month. However, Vijayaramaraju refused this orders and he went to Padmanabham located between the Bhimunipatnam and Vizianagaram. The British troops defeated Vizianagaram army and Chinavijayaramaraju died due to bullet injury in the battle. Aftermath After the death of Vijayaramaraju, his son Narayanababu found shelter in Makkuva village. The konda doras and sardars supported him. In the end, he made a treaty with the British, and agreed to pay 5 million peskas. After that British occupied Vijayanagara ville. But they returned Zamindari to Narayanababu . They renewed the zamindars lands and deprived them of their unique venture. By 1802, Britishers implemented the permanent tax system in zamindaris.

Her portfolio includes over one million images, and one of her collector-owned fine art photographs was appraised at $40,000. Influences Howard cites Helmut Newton as a major influence of her work, a statement she has made in multiple interviews; she has also been called the \\"female Helmut Newton\\". Additionally, she is influenced by the work of Robert Mapplethorpe and Mark Seliger. Gallery and museum work In 1995 Howard had her first one-woman gallery show in Los Angeles, \\"Black & White & Brutal\\", which presented her \\"fetish and kink-oriented imagery\\" to a receptive audience. Since then she has had over 60 art gallery exhibitions, including a downtown LA show titled \\"Sharp Edges\\" with crime writer John Gilmore, in which all the art was stuck to the walls with custom knives. An exhibition of her work titled 'Alice in Thunderland' opened in early 2011 at the World Erotic Art Museum in Florida marking a graduation of Howard's work from art galleries to museums. Her work is also featured on the walls of the Lord Balfour Hotel in South Beach, Florida. Sixty-four of its rooms house Howard art, and the rooms have been decorated to match the colors in her photographs. 30-foot murals grace the rooms and some rooms showcase easel-based art within the master suites.

Best known in China by the name Da Long (大龙), or Big Dragon, Ballen is a familiar foreign-face on Chinese TV. widely known for his role as host of China's internationally aired travel series, Getaway. In 2013, Ballen and his team of technologists envisioned and pioneered China's first fully interactive video shopping experiences for sports apparel brand Nike, Unilever, Kraft Foods, LVMH Group's Sephora on Youku, and Chinese TV shopping giant Acorn International as reported by Retail In Asia. Ballen's TOUCH™ V-commerce mechanism produced greater than 500% increases in viewer engagement relative to traditional online banner, play-pause and pre-roll ads for Nike and Sephora, helping to revolutionize China's V-commerce industry. Though patented, since inception, Ballen's TOUCH™ mechanism has been emulated by several of China's largest video portals. Early life and education Ballen was born in New York.

Ballen left Duke after two years, unsatisfied with the constraints of a legal education. Andrew Ballen during the filming of Getaway Travel Series, September 2007 Career Awarded a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship in International Relations, but distressed by racial and economic discord in America, Ballen chose to discover the World on his own. Influenced by the work of British Sinologist Joseph Needham and intrigued by China's reform and opening, the destination Ballen chose was Shanghai, China. Ballen arrived in China in August 2001. At first unable to speak a single word of Chinese, Ballen taught himself Mandarin and first found work at the Wall Street Institute. He made several guest appearances on Shanghai Media Group entertainment programmes and subsequently was named host of Shanghai Radio talk show \\"Live It Up Shanghai\\".American black New Yorker speak Chinese.Episode of CCTV Travel Show \\"Getaway\\" hosted by Andrew Ballen In 2002, quoting reporter Michelle Zhang from Shanghai Daily: > Charmed by his silky-smooth voice and perfect pronunciation, one of his > students at the Wall Street Institute recommended him to a local radio show > \\"Live It Up Shanghai.\\" Initially, no sponsors or advertising existed for Ballen's radio talk show, the same being true later for his TV show Getaway. Ballen seized on this market opportunity, starting his own company in China to identify and attract global brands seeking to reach emerging millennial Chinese consumers, and white collar university graduates. Ballen is an advocate of content-marketing and unintrusive, digital ad messaging. He developed disruptive, touch-based mechanisms that do not annoy or disturb digital consumers' viewing experience, providing consumers with greater opportunity, and clients with increased levels of eCRM data, and downstream monetization. Ballen frequently addresses the topic of interactive content-marketing and in 2014 coined the term \\"Audience ROI\\". His mechanisms promote audience choice in ad messaging, enabling organic insight into audience preference; these insights are based contextually on what consumers themselves see, like, and then touch inside digital content they view.

Among the gala's attendees was Chairman of the People's Bank of China, Governor Zhou Xiaochuan. =Leveraging Western Entertainment: Marketing and Cultural Exchange= In late 2001, while frequenting Shanghai night spots, Ballen and friend Adam Wilkes, currently Vice President of AEG Live, observed China's lack of a hip-hop and urban club scene. This led to the idea of Hip Hop Thursday's, held at night club, Pegasus, targeting Chinese youth and the international student market. Ballen and Pegasus were featured in the fly-on- the-wall documentary No Sleep Til Shanghai.No Sleep Til Shanghai，No Sleep Til Shanghai. These weekly events became highly successful, leading Ballen to bring to China for the first time the likes of Ice-T, Asian-American hip-hop artists Far East Movement and MC Jin. serving as the benchmark formula for other club venues in Shanghai and Beijing. Ballen's unorthodox entertainment- marketing success was covered in the book, Business is War: The Unfinished Business of Black America. written by Darren J. Perkins. Ballen was also the first marketer to convince Chinese mega-star Leehom Wang appear and perform live in a club setting. when he premiered the release of the MC Jin/Leehom Wang collaboration to promote Leehom's album release of \\"Heroes of Earth\\" featuring America's first, popular Chinese-American hip-hop artist, Jin. =Getaway= Ballen hosted and co-produced China's nationally aired bi- lingual travel adventure series, Getaway from 2003 until 2008.

REMIX broadcast across China and Asia via cable and online by Channel V and Tudou.com. Ballen created, scripted and produced REMIX. The REMIX concept is copyrighted in China and the United States. REMIX marked Ballen's transition from the terrestrial, satellite and OTG marketing arena to China's rapidly emerging digital strategy and content marketing space. Awards On April 23, 2015, Shanghai, Ballen was awarded recognition as a member of China’s Digital A-List. The Campaign Asia Digital A-List aims to recognize China's top digital entrepreneurs and innovators, who are fomenting disruptive change in China's dynamic digital and new media space. Awardees from top brands, agencies and media came together to debate trends in China's digital marketing industry, Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba Group and Pony Ma, Chairman of Tencent also received 2015's A-List awards. Beginning in 2015 Ballen's TOUCH™ interactive ad messaging system was implemented by Mango TV, the online platform under Hunan Broadcasting System on its top six programmes including one of China's most popular reality series \\"Where Are We Going, Dad? (TV series)\\". The use of TOUCH™ earned Mango TV China's annual award for most innovative video ad technology. It was announced in April 2016 that Ballen was again named to Campaign Asia's List of China's Top 100 Digital Thinkers. 2016 is Ballen's second consecutive year to be awarded. Controversy In a 2011 PBS interview with Tavis Smiley and Cornel West, Ballen controversially remarked that he felt China's system of governance had measurably contributed to global social justice by helping lift 800 million people out of poverty. In his lectures and speeches on content-marketing, Ballen often comments on the waste and inefficiency of pre-roll and play-pause advertisements which are often used as brand agencies' primary digital advertising medium. In Chinese media, Ballen has called those ads \\"interruptive, ignored and irrational\\" since they represent less than 1% of messaging content available to publishers and their Digital Native consumers. Studies show millennial viewers tune out interruptive, traditional advertising and enjoy using smart devices to touch and experience the visual content they themselves choose. Ballen says the consequence of interruptive advertising mechanisms is that online and mobile pre-roll ads are ignored or blocked by users who increasingly install ad- blocking widgets and apps on their smart devices.

Morgan's work can be seen across his home state of Louisiana and in the Capitol Visitor Center, Washington, DC. He and his wife Gladys B. Morgan ran an art school, the Southwestern Institute of Arts, in their Shreveport home for over forty years. Early life and education Born Arthur Carmine Morgan on August 3, 1904 at Riverton Plantation in Ascension Parish, he was educated in Louisiana public and private schools. At an early age Morgan went to New England and New York, where he attended art schools and graduated from Beaux-Arts Institute of Design, a mostly vocational art school in New York City. He became a private pupil and protégé of Gutzon Borglum and worked in the studios of Mario Korbel, Attilio Piccirilli, and others. Sculpting and teaching career Morgan began exhibiting his work at age fifteen. At least one critic called him a \\"boy prodigy.\\"Shreveport Journal, 8 July 1935. At age sixteen in 1920 Morgan was given his first commission, for a bust of physician Simon Baruch (father of financier Bernard M. Baruch).New York Herald, 10 April 1921 This led to more commissions for busts and bas-reliefs, often in bronze. He also made decorative bronzes and garden sculptures. In 1928 Morgan went back to Louisiana to begin work on a proposed Longfellow Evangeline national monument at Bayou Teche in St. Martinville. Although Morgan worked in New Orleans on models for the project, it ended at that stage owing to funding woes.Louisiana Press, 2 August 1925 That same year Morgan settled permanently in Shreveport where he taught sculpture, drawing and art history at Centenary College. There he met faculty member and watercolor artist Gladys Butler (born 1899), whom he married on July 26, 1929 in McDonald County, Missouri. In 1934 the Morgans left the college and began an art and music school in their home, calling it the Southwestern Institute of Arts. The Morgans had two daughters, Diana Morgan Welsh (born 1930) and Cynthia Butler Morgan (born 1932). Cynthia died in May 1936 following a house fire. For his daughter's tombstone Morgan designed a granite medallion, with a bas-relief profile of the girl and Celtic lettering, which is listed by the Smithsonian. Following the fire, the Morgans moved with their art school to 657 Jordan Street in Shreveport where it stayed open for more than forty years. Built in 1909, by 2011 the classical revival, two-story, four-columned house was still standing but abandoned. In 1975, after leasing their Shreveport property and furnishings to Max Edmonson, president of the Shreveport Boys choir, Morgan and his wife moved to London from whence they hoped to acquire marble in Italy for some of his sculpting projects. However these plans fell through and they came back to the United States in January 1978. Morgan sculpted many busts and decorative bronzes, among them larger architectural sculptures and marble groups. His work is in private collections and public buildings such as Louisiana State University, Centenary College, the US Federal Court House at Alexandria, Louisiana and the US Capitol in Washington D.C. Through the span of his career Morgan had long- lasting friendships with Jules Bache, Bernard M. Baruch, Lincoln Borglum, Frances Elliott Clark and Jean Despujols.Shreveport Times, 9 June 1977 His wife Gladys B. Morgan died in 1981. Arthur C.

Career  Bell commenced his engineering career in 1837, building railways in England and Scotland, and also worked under Sir John Macneill MInstCE, on the Great Southern and Western Railway in Ireland. By 1853 Bell had migrated to Australia, and in January 1854, in Victoria, was the engineer on the A£1,000,000 prospectus for the Geelong–Ballarat railway line. He was also listed as the surveyor for the Colonial Insurance Company, and there are a number of tender advertisements, for reinstatement for damaged buildings. In 1855, he presented a well received paper on the merits of iron truss bridges to the Victorian Institute for the Advancement of Science (later the Royal Society of Victoria). Other works he designed included of the railway line from to , prior to 1858, the design and construction of the Melbourne and Essendon Railway in 1859, and works for the Yarra Yarra Mining Company,Yarra Yarra Mining Company prospectus and Sandridge Lagoon, Port Melbourne. Bell was responsible for a number of fairly similar wrought iron lattice truss road and rail bridges, several of which were fabricated from components supplied by Messrs. Lloyds, Fosters, and Company's Wednesbury, Old Park Ironworks, Staffordshire. The West Maitland Bridge was the sixth bridge this firm exported for Bell, with the others including the Hawthorn Railway Bridge and Hawthorn Road Bridge over the River Yarra, in Melbourne, the Prince Alfred Bridge at Gundagai, and the Pitnacree and Dunmore bridges in New South Wales. His expertise was sought for a number of Melbourne civic works projects as he gave evidence to the Victorian Royal Commissions on the River and Harbour Trust in 1858 and 1860, and to the Select Committees on the Railway Department in 1860 and on the Central Railway Terminus in 1861 and in the same year was a member of the Royal Society of Victoria's Sanitary Committee. Bell was a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers (MInstCE). Bell was City Engineer for the City of Sydney from approximately 1871 to 1879, a member of the Sewerage and Health Board, and was responsible for improving the storage capacity of the Botany watershed and planned a system for sewering the city in the direction of Bondi.  Personal life  Bell was the sixth son of John Bell, of Belfast, Ireland. He was married on 17 June 1858 at the Cathedral, Newcastle, New South Wales to Jane Eliza Livingstone, youngest daughter of Captain Alexander Livingstone of Newcastle. In May 1872 he was living in St. Leonards, on the North Shore of Sydney, when his wife gave birth to a daughter. His youngest daughter married Charles Wade, who, amongst other things, became Premier of NSW in 1907, was the Agent-General for NSW in 1917, and was knighted in 1918. Bell died in 1879 at his residence in , Sydney, and was buried at the Rookwood Necropolis.

It crosses into Iowa over the Missouri River from South Sioux City, Nebraska, at Sioux City and runs approximately to an interchange with Interstate 29 where the road continues north as Wesley Parkway. Like all other state highways in Iowa, the route is maintained by the Iowa Department of Transportation. US 77 has never been a long route in Iowa. When it was extended into the state in 1929, it only traveled in Sioux City before crossing the Big Sioux River into South Dakota. After I-29 was built in Sioux City during the late 1950s, US 77 was moved onto the new Interstate Highway. At both historic ends of the highway in Iowa, bridge failures have caused US 77 to be detoured around Sioux City. In the mid-1980s, the national end of the highway was moved to the interchange with I-29. Route description US 77 crossing the Missouri River into Iowa US 77 in Iowa begins on the Siouxland Veterans Memorial Bridge over the Missouri River. It heads north along Wesley Parkway where it comes to an interchange with Interstate 29 (I-29), U.S. Highway 20 Business (US 20 Business), and Iowa Highway 12 (Iowa 12). On either side of the interchange Iowa 12 is an unsigned highway; east of the interchange, the route is signed as US 20 Business, while on the west side it is a duplicate route with I-29. US 20 Business exits Wesley Parkway and briefly overlaps I-29. US 77 ends at the center of the interchange. The entire route is long. At , US 77 is the shortest U.S. Highway in the state and the second shortest state highway overall. I-129, which is located southeast of US 77, is the shortest state highway at in length. In each instance, the highway crosses the Missouri River from Nebraska and ends at I-29. History US 20 and US 77 originally crossed the Missouri River on the Combination Bridge US 77 has never been a long route in Iowa. It was extended into Iowa in 1929, overlapping US 20 across the Combination Bridge and onto Perry Street. US 20 turned east onto 5th Street and US 77 turned west one block north onto Riverside Avenue, now known as 4th Street. It followed Riverside west and onto a curvy section near the confluence of the Big Sioux and Missouri rivers. The route curved back to the north along the banks of the Big Sioux River. It turned west onto Military Road and crossed the river into South Dakota shortly thereafter. The route at its longest extent was . The portion of the route west of US 20 replaced a section of Primary Road No. 141, which followed a route parallel to US 77's. In 1951, Gordon Drive, which carried US 20 east of the Combination Bridge, was extended westward along the banks of the Missouri River. It connected to Riverside Avenue near the river confluence. US 77 was moved onto the new road which removed the curvy section of Riverside. In the late 1950s when construction of I-29 began, its route was planned along the banks of the Missouri River generally following the path of US 275, US 75, and US 77\\\\. The first section of I-29, from a point along Gordon Drive east of the Combination Bridge to the Big Sioux River opened around October 1, 1958. US 77 was moved onto the new interstate from the Combination Bridge to the Riverside Boulevard interchange. After sections of I-29 in South Dakota opened up, allowing traffic to utilize bridges crossing the Big Sioux that were built in 1958, US 77 was moved onto the interstate completely. However, the arrangement did not last long. On April 2, 1962, surging flood waters from the Big Sioux brought down the northbound bridge over the river. An investigation of the collapse found the surging waters scoured the dirt and rocks away from around the bridge piers, which caused them to fail. Both directions of traffic were routed along US 77's old alignment while the bridges were repaired. US 77 faced more bridge problems at its other end. In the late-1970s and early-1980s, a steel, tied arch bridge was built to replace the Combination Bridge, which opened in 1895. The Siouxland Veterans Memorial Bridge opened to traffic in January 1981 and was dedicated months later on July 22. This too, would not last long. During routine bridge washing on May 6, 1982, an Iowa DOT worker discovered a crack across a box girder. The crack was approximately wide and was rusted, which told the workers it had been there for some time. The bridge was immediately closed down for repairs. Traffic was rerouted south to cross the Missouri at the I-129 bridge. The bridge would not be fully opened again until May 1983. Within a couple years, US 77 would be truncated to the I-29 interchange. The completion of Interstate 29 in South Dakota, which generally followed US 77 northward, meant the end of the U.S. Highway's importance. Maps published by the Iowa DOT in 1983 and traffic logs from 1984 show and list US 77 extending into South Dakota. Highway maps and traffic logs from 1986 show US 77 ending at I-29, meaning the route was shortened at some time in those two years.

Poetic form The normal formal style is for uniform line lengths of 5 or 7 syllables (or characters), with lines in syntactically-paired couplets. Parallelism emphasizing thesis or antithesis is frequently found but is not an obligatory feature. Rhymes generally occur at the ends of couplets, the actual rhyme sound sometimes changing through the course of the poem. Caesura usually occurs as a major feature before the last 3 syllables in any line, with the 7 syllable lines also often having a minor caesura in between the first two pairs of syllables. The final 3 syllables in a line are often varied syntactically by whether the first and second of these are more closely linked by the syntax or whether the second and third are more syntactically connected: a feature of the gushi form which provides added poetic interest and variety.Frankel, 213 History Gushi poems first really began to emerge as a poetic form in the second century CE.Frankel, 213 In its subsequent history, a revival during the Tang dynasty produced an additional period of flourishing for this form of poetry. =Nineteen Old Poems= Gushi began their historical prominence with the Nineteen Old Poems (literally, \\"Nineteen Gushi\\"), which seem to date to the Han Dynasty, from about this time period.Watson, 19 These nineteen poems are generally characterized as rhymed verse, in the five-character line, unregulated style. =Tang dynasty revival= The gushi style experienced a great revival during the Tang Dynasty, during which one of the poets particularly associated with masterful use of this style was Li Bai. In the Tang Dynasty, with the development of the new style poetry (jintishi), also known as regulated verse, the term gushi was applied to poetry which did not necessarily keep under restriction the length of the poem nor to fulfill requirements for verbal or tonal parallelisms: in the freer gushi form of verse, often various rules were pointedly violated, such as by the use of unusual rhyme schemes or conspicuous avoidance of verbal parallelism.Watson, 112 See also *Classical Chinese poetry *Classical Chinese poetry forms *Li Bai *Regulated verse References =Citations= =Bibliography= *Birrell, Anne (1988).

It causes mild gastrointestinal diseases in pigs and is thought to contribute to multifactorial porcine respiratory diseases complexes. Several strains of the virus can be found worldwide, and transmission occurs horizontally by the oro-faecal route. Clinical signs Infection is often subclinical, and when clinical signs are seen they are mild and short-lived. Gastrointestinal signs such as diarrhoea, anorexia and dehydration are most commonly seen in piglets. Reproductive signs such as abortion can be seen in adult sows. Respiratory signs such as coughing can be seen if the infection is part of a multifactorial respiratory disease complex. Diagnosis and treatment Histology, virus isolation, electron microscopy, immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescent staining, immunodiffusion, complement fixation, virus neutralisation and ELISA can all be used to confirm diagnosis.

He spent 33 years in the National Football League (NFL)—3 as a player, 4 as a scout and 26 as a coach. Crosby was named the NFL Special Teams Coach of the Year with the San Diego Chargers in 2007. A running back, Crosby played college football for the Fort Hays Tigers He played professionally for the New York Giants (1974–1976). Afterwards he scouted or coached in the NFL for the Miami Dolphins, Atlanta Falcons, Cleveland Browns, New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles. He then coached college football for three years at Vanderbilt University before joining the Chargers in 2002. College career Crosby played college football at Fort Hays State, where he was an Associated Press Little All-American (1973), two-time National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) All-District 10 (1972–1973), and two-time All-Great Plains Athletic Conference selection (1972–1973). The tailback finished his career with 2,780 rushing yards and 27 touchdowns while also filling in for injured teammates at quarterback and middle linebacker. Professional playing career Crosby was selected by the New York Giants in the 17th round of the 1974 NFL Draft. He was one of the few 17th round picks to ever make an NFL team after reporting to training camp in his best ever physical condition. The 1974 NFL strike also may have helped as veterans missed training camp. Stomach and knee injuries impacted Crosby's first year. He played three seasons with the Giants and retired following the 1976 season after a serious knee injury. Coaching career Crosby recovered from his injury and earned his master's degree. Three weeks after accepting a position to teach high school, he was offered to be a scout for the Miami Dolphins. He accepted, and later became a coach under Don Shula. The Dolphins went to Super Bowl XVII in 1982. Crosby then coached for the Atlanta Falcons, Cleveland Browns, New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles. In 1985 with the Browns, Crosby was the running backs coach that oversaw both Earnest Byner and Kevin Mack both running for 1,000 yards. Crosby joined the Chargers in 2002 as special teams coach under their new incoming head coach, Marty Schottenheimer. Crosby was honored as the 2007 NFL Special Teams Coach of the Year by Professional Kicking Services. His kickoff strategy with the Chargers emphasized placement of the ball—forcing the return team to one side of the field—as a tradeoff for the distance of the kick. During his Chargers tenure, four special team players were selected to the Pro Bowl including covermen Kassim Osgood (3-time selection) and Hanik Milligan, kicker Nate Kaeding (2-times) and long snapper David Binn. Additionally, punter Mike Scifres was a Pro Bowl first-alternate four times, and kick returner Darren Sproles was a first-alternate once and a second alternate twice. Kaeding, who started his NFL career under Crosby, was the NFL’s most accurate kicker of all-time as of the end of the 2010 season, converting 86.5% of his field goals attempts. The San Diego Union-Tribune wrote that Crosby's special teams unit in 2010 was \\"by some measures the worst special teams season in NFL history.\\" The Chargers allowed touchdowns on three kickoffs and one punt, and had four punts blocked and another deflected. As of 2010, two teams since 1994 had allowed more kickoff returns for touchdowns and five allowed as many as the Chargers. Two teams had allowed more blocked punts, and none since 1976 surrendered a punt return average higher than the Chargers' 18.9 yards. Crosby was unable to get a group of inexperienced players to play at an acceptable level. Some team members said it was time for a change after listening to Crosby for nine years, and his contract was not renewed after the season.

The job role varies throughout the world, and common titles include veterinary nurse, veterinary technician, veterinary assistant and veterinary technologist, and variants with the prefix of 'animal health'. The scope of practice varies between countries, with some countries allowing suitably qualified paraveterinary workers a scope of autonomous practice, including minor surgery, whilst others restrict their workers to simple assisting of the veterinarian. Nomenclature =Veterinary Technician / Nurse= United States veterinary technician logo In North America, paraveterinary workers who have completed a course of study, passed an examination, and have a defined scope of practice are called veterinary technicians or technologists. Veterinary Technologists hold a bachelor's degree in Veterinary Technology. Most Canadian provinces have a formal registration process and, legally, veterinarians must hire registered veterinary technicians/technologists. In America credentialed veterinary technicians must attend a Veterinary Technology program approved by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), most of which are two year programs which confer an Associate of Science (or an Associate of Applied Science) Degree in Veterinary Technology. Graduates must pass the VTNE (Veterinary Technician National Exam) to become credentialed in their state.https://www.aavsb.org/vtne-overview/ These credentials (whether Licensed [LVT], Registered [RVT], or Certified [CVT]) must be renewed every two years with requirements varying from state-to-state. Human nursing associations have often claimed rights over the term \\"nurse\\". In some countries this is protected by law, and in the United States, 39 states have title protection over \\"Nurse\\", with Nursing Practice Acts mandating that only those who are Registered Nurses (RNs) may use the title \\"Nurse\\".https://www.registerednursing.org/answers/who-can-use-term- nurse/https://www.nursingworld.org/practice-policy/advocacy/state/title-nurse- protection/ \\"Nurse\\" title protection was in place in the United Kingdom until 1984, where veterinary nurses were referred to as 'registered animal nursing auxiliaries', in line with the naming convention at the time for less qualified assistants in human nursing, called 'nursing auxiliaries'. There are currently only seven countries in the world (out of ~195) who have a recognized paraveterinary profession and use the term \\"Veterinary Nurse\\" to describe those workers: * UK - Registered Veterinary Nurses * Ireland - Registered Veterinary Nurses (a profession in its infancy) * Australia: ** Veterinary Nurses in only ONE STATE (Queensland). However, a VN title can be acquired with little education and only a certificate. Voluntary credentialing opened in some other states in 2018, but this is also a profession in its infancy. ** Vet Technicians, in contrast, hold a 3-year degree completed through a University program. The curriculum is not influenced by the industry or government as such and there is no quality assurance of practical skills; however, this degree has more in-depth knowledge required and exposure to much higher level skills. * New Zealand - both Registered Veterinary Nurses and Veterinary Technicians ** Veterinary Technicians have the higher degree (3 years of school as opposed to 2) * South Africa - Veterinary Nurse and Animal Health Technician ** Each title conferred has completely separate curricula, with the AHT being more like a Nurse Practitioner (in the US); aka a mid-level medical professional. ** Veterinary Nurses in SA are more like veterinary assistants in the US * Denmark - title translates to Veterinary Nurse * Norway - title translates to Veterinary Nurse There is an effort to change the title of credentialed Veterinary Technicians in the United Stateshttp://veterinarynurse.org/ but legislative efforts have failed in all four states where the name change has been introduced to date. The VNI has spent over $200,000 with no clear accounting of where the money has been spent and no success.https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.navta.net/resource/resmgr/vn_initiative/Screen_Shot_2019-05-01_at_9..png Many state Veterinary Technician associations and Veterinary Medical Associations oppose the effort to change the title of the profession in the United States, and the AVMA has refused to support the name change (but does support the other stated goals of the VNI).https://www.avma.org/News/JAVMANews/Pages/180101e.aspx =Veterinary assistant= In most countries, a veterinary assistant is a person with fewer or no formal animal health qualifications, who has no autonomous practice, but who is designated to assist a vet and act under their direct instruction. Training programs are often workplace-based, and no formal licence or certification is required to perform the role. In the US, veterinary assistants have the option to earn a certificate of completion by taking basic animal health classes about contagious diseases, animal restraint, record keeping, work place safety, administration, etc. Having the knowledge of the basics allows for the development of trust between the veterinarian and the assistant, as well as smoother job training of veterinary assistants. Their scope of practice remains limited and equal to many on the job trained staff. Local laws restrict what activities a veterinary assistant may perform, as some procedures may only be legally completed by a licensed veterinary technician, including IV anesthesia induction, oral surgery, splinting and casting, and in some states, administering the rabies vaccine. History Veterinarians have had assistance from staff throughout their existence of the profession, but the first organised paraveterinary workers were the canine nurses trained by the Canine Nurses Institute in 1908, and announced in the magazine 'The Veterinary Student'. According to the founder, they would \\"carry out directions of the veterinary surgeon, meet a genuine need on the part of the dog owners, and at the same time provide a reasonably paid occupation for young women with a real liking for animals\\". In 1913, the Ruislip Dog Sanatorium was founded, and employed nurses to care for unwell dogs and in the 1920s, at least one veterinary surgery in Mayfair employed qualified human nurses to tend the animals. In the mid-1930s, the early veterinary nurses approached the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons for official recognition, and in 1938 the Royal Veterinary College had a head nurse appointed, but the official recognition was not given until 1957, first as veterinary nurses, but changed within a year to Royal Animal Nursing Auxiliaries (RANAs) following objection from the human nursing profession. In 1951, the first formal paraveterinary role was created by the United States Air Force who introduced veterinary technicians, and this was followed in 1961 by a civilian programme at the State University of New York (SUNY) Agricultural and Technical College. In 1965 Walter Collins, DVM received federal funding to develop model curricula for training technicians. He produced several guides over the next seven years, and for this work he is considered the \\"father of veterinary technology\\" in the United States. In 1984, the term veterinary nurse was formally restored to paraveterinary workers in the United Kingdom. Role and responsibilities The scope of practice for paraveterinary workers varies by jurisdiction, and by qualification level. In some places, more than one grade of paraveterinary worker exists. For instance, in the United Kingdom there are both veterinary nurses, who are qualified professionals with a protected title, and veterinary assistants, who do not have a single level of qualification which they must attain, and whose title is not protected. Furthermore, job roles may be divided further into roles such as Veterinary Surgical Technician, Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Technician, Veterinary Technician Anesthesia Specialist, etc. In the United States, veterinary technicians can become registered both nationally and by their state of residence by taking board exams. Not all states require a state test. States that license veterinary technicians include Alaska, Alabama, Delaware, Georgia, Michigan, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, North Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. Once they are registered, they are allowed to perform certain tasks with or without a veterinarian's supervision. To see a list by state, click here to view some of these tasks. In order to keep their skills and knowledge up to par, some states require registered technicians to engage in continued education before renewing their license. At the higher levels, veterinary nurses or technicians may be able to practice skills autonomously, including examinations and minor surgery on animals, without the direct supervision of a veterinarian. Paraveterinary workers are likely to assist the vet, or perform by themselves on behalf of the vet, medical skills such as observations (e.g. taking and recording pulse, temperature, respiration etc.), wound and trauma management (e.g. cleaning and dressing wounds, applying splints etc.), physical interventions (e.g. catheterizations, ear flushes and venipuncture) and preparing and analysing biological samples (e.g. performing skin scrapings, microbiology, urinalysis, and microscopy). Dependent on their scope of practice and training, they may also be called upon to operate diagnostic screening equipment, including electrocardiographic, radiographic and ultrasonographic instruments, including complex machines such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imagers and gamma cameras. In veterinary hospitals, veterinary technicians can perform complete blood counts, differential counts, and morphologic examinations of blood. Veterinary technicians commonly assist veterinarians in surgery by providing correct equipment and instruments and by assuring that monitoring and support equipment are in good working condition. They may also maintain treatment records and inventory of all pharmaceuticals, equipment and supplies, and help with other administrative tasks within a veterinary practice, such as client education. Client education plays a key role of the veterinary technician's responsibilities, such as effectively communicatIng complex medical instructions in a positive and understandable way, and to facilitate the patient's care as an intermediary between the doctor, hospital and the patient. In this way, open lines of communication are established that can benefit the patient and hospital. Education and qualification The level of education of a paraveterinary worker will depend on the role they are performing, and the veterinary medico-legal framework for the area in which they are working. Many areas employ veterinary assistants, who have a simple role to directly assist the vet under direction, and may hold no formal qualification or training, or have been trained on the job. Higher level paraveterinary workers, such as veterinary nurses, veterinary technicians or veterinary technologists, who have a scope of autonomous practice which they are expected to perform without instruction, are likely to have both formal qualifications and in many jurisdictions will also require a formal registration with a monitoring body. In countries where the role of veterinary workers is most advanced, the qualification required is likely to be based in higher education, such as in the United States or Canada where veterinary technicians must normally gain an associate degree at an institution recognised by the American Veterinary Medical Association or Canadian Veterinary Medical Association, and can choose to study for an extended period to gain a bachelor's degree (which in America may confer the title 'technologist', rather than 'technician'), or the United Kingdom, where veterinary nurses enter the profession through either a two-year diploma programmer or through completion of a foundation degree or honours degree. In almost all cases, regardless of the level of formalized training, a high level of practical experience is usually required prior to a student being fully qualified, which may be completed as part of their course, or during a post- qualification period. This may require maintenance of a log of all work completed, which may need to be signed by a supervising professional (such as the vet or senior member of the veterinary staff) to indicate competence. In some cases, such as in the United States, video records may be required of some procedures, which may then be examined by the awarding or registration body. Many countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, and parts of the United States, restrict some elements of practice, and may restrict use of the recognised name, to those people currently registered with an appropriate licensing body, meaning that it would be illegal for any person not on the register to represent themselves as a paraveterinary worker, or to perform some of the procedures that a licensed professional could. The precise details of these restrictions vary widely between legal areas, and neighbouring areas may have different policies, as is the case in the various states of the US. This licensing body may have its own requirements for maintaining a registration, and those who hold the requisite academic qualification may still have to complete a further range of exams or tests to become registered. For instance, in the United States, most areas use the Veterinary Technician National Exam, and this will be used by the state licensing authority (such as a state veterinary medical association) to qualify an applicant to become a registered veterinary technician. In some cases, those people who qualified before the introduction of formal academic qualification requirements may still be working as paraveterinary workers, and may still be entered on a required register through the use of grandfather rights. For instance, in some states of the US, people with a set number of years or hours of experience assisting a veterinarian could sit for the Veterinary Technician National Exam, however this route was phased out in 2011, and future candidates must have an academic qualification. =Specialty certification= Beyond credentialing as a veterinary technician specialty certification is also available to technicians with advanced skills. To date there are specialty recognitions in: emergency & critical care, anesthesiology, dentistry, small animal internal medicine, large animal internal medicine, cardiology, oncology, neurology, zoological medicine, equine veterinary nursing, surgery, behavior, nutrition, clinical practice (canine/feline, exotic companion animal, and production animal sub-specialties) and clinical pathology. Veterinary Technician Specialists carry the additional post-nominal letters \\"VTS\\" with their particular specialties indicated in parentheses. As veterinary technology evolves more specialty academy recognitions are anticipated. The need for veterinary assistants will continue to rise as pet ownership in the United States is growing. Responsible pet ownership and animal safety becoming more significant's contributing to the increasing demand. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the number of veterinary assistant jobs is expected to grow up to 19% by 2026, much faster than the average career.

Its members currently include Australia, Canada, Ireland, Japan, Malta, Nepal, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In 2007 the Accreditation Committee for Veterinary Nurse Education (ACOVENE) was established in an attempt to standardize veterinary technology education throughout the European Union and to allow movement of veterinary nurses educated in one member nation to employment in another. On the specialty front, the Swiss-based organization VASTA (Veterinär Anästhesie Schule für TechnikerInnen und ArzthelferInnen -- Veterinary Anaesthesia School for Technicians and Assistants) is a six module year-long program that is approved by the Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists (AVA), the European College of Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia (ECVAA), the International Veterinary Academy of Pain Management (IVAPM), and that has applied for RACE (Registry of Approved Continuing Education) approval in the United States (\\"Assistants\\" in the VASTA title refers to assistant or junior veterinarians and not to unqualified veterinary assistants). Its instructors include diplomates of the ECVAA, nurse anesthetists from the human medical field, neurologists, and veterinary physical therapists. It is currently offered in Germany, Austria, and the German-speaking regions of Switzerland. It has previously been offered in the French-speaking region of Switzerland but is currently on hiatus there due to low participation. Courses are planned for the US and the UK in 2012. Successful completion of the course results in the awarding of the post-nominal letters VAT (Veterinary Anaesthesia Technician).

In internal logistics, there are various ways for getting product flows up or down. A solution which is often used is the deployment of incline or lowering belts. When placed at an angle in order to bridge a height difference, such belt conveyors also have the advantage of covering a certain distance. A disadvantage is the loss of much useful floor space as a result of the presence of the necessary supports for the belt conveyor. A bigger distance over a smaller floor area can be bridged using a product lift or a vertical conveyor. A continuous conveyor or a discontinuous conveyor can be chosen as a vertical conveyor. Continuous conveyors can take the form of a spiral conveyor, an L-shaped conveyor or platform lift or a product lift fitted with a fork. Discontinuous and continuous conveyors A discontinuous conveyor also called a reciprocating elevator, lifts the product on to a platform using a platform, roller conveyor or belt conveyor and then moves the platform with the product to another level. Because of the cycle time required for input and output as well as lifting/lowering movements, such a conveyor can only be used for smaller capacities. Continuous conveyors are more suitable for bigger capacities. There are two important solutions which can be used for this group. It is possible to choose a spiral conveyor or a continuous product lift. Both solutions are able to handle several products at a time. Spiral conveyor The advantage of a spiral conveyor is that it can be used with a minimum amountof control software since it is continuously running, unlike o-lifts or platform elevators that require controls to time the infeed of the products to coincide with the arrival of a platform. If a product has to be supported so that it is flat during transport, this will only be possible if the belt is wider than the product. The drive motor of a spiral conveyor does not always need to be controlled with a frequency regulator. Spiral conveyors can deliver three times the throughput of an o-lift or platform elevator due to the ability to run continuous. 3500-5000 shipping cases or cartons per hour are normal speeds for a spiral conveyor, while lifts handle these products with a throughput of only 1200-1500 CPH. Besides this the spiral conveyor is also a lot safer in operation and does not require safety fencing while o-lifts and platform elevators need to provide fencing in order to be safety compliant. Due to the moving platforms that could tear off a limb of not shielded by fencing. This makes platform lifts, if you include the fencing footprint, much larger in footprint than a spiral conveyor. L-shaped conveyor or platform lift File:Prorunner mk2 goederenlift.jpg A continuous product lift or reciprocating elevator can be chosen for the upright transporting of products. Such lifts are found in two forms: an L-shaped conveyor or mat lift and a fork-lift. An L-shaped conveyor or platform lift is a goods lift in which the products lie on a support which is suspended between a number of chains. This means that there is a considerable risk of contamination (with oil or grease) where use is made of traditional chains. A possible disadvantage of such a lift is that it requires more control, but the area required is again appreciably less than with a spiral conveyor. The difference in height which is able to be bridged with only one drive motor is almost unlimited. When bridging a greater height, it is necessary with spiral conveyors to place several systems one above the other. Another disadvantage of an L-shaped conveyor or a platform lift is the fact that it is difficult to control the transfer of products on intake to the system, with the incorrect receiving of a product being able to cause considerable consequential damage and with considerable additional costs to be expected as a result of lost production just as in the case of a spiral conveyor. Fork lift A Fork lift can be arranged in more ways than an L-shaped conveyor or a platform lift and a spiral conveyor. A fork-lift is a product lift which lifts products from a conveyor using a fork and then places them at a different level on another conveyor. Such a fork-lift makes it possible to introduce or remove products at an angle of 90 degrees. As a result, the number of possible input and output combinations is somewhat larger. Because of the possibility of sliding conveyors in or out of the lift, a fork-lift can also be used as a vertical sorting system. With such a sorting installation, a product can be entered and removed at any level and a product can be lifted and lowered using one lift. The power and thus the energy consumption of the drive is considerably lower with a fork-lift than with other systems, since only the product weight needs to be transported and the forks maintain a balance between each other in the rising and lowering section. Another difference between a fork-lift and an L-shaped conveyor or platform lift is the complexity of the control. With an L-shaped conveyor or platform lift, input and output must be completely synchronous, whereas this is not necessary with a fork-lift. This ensures considerably simpler controls.

The term is a portmanteau obtained by merging precarious with proletariat.F. Lunning (2010).Mechademia 5: Fanthropologies. University of Minnesota Press. p. 252\\\\. . Unlike the proletariat class of industrial workers in the 20th century who lacked their own means of production and hence sold their labour to live, members of the precariat are only partially involved in labour and must undertake extensive \\"unremunerated activities that are essential if they are to retain access to jobs and to decent earnings\\". Classic examples of such unpaid activities include continually having to search for work (including preparing for and attending job interviews), as well as being expected to be perpetually responsive to calls for \\"gig\\" work (yet without being paid an actual wage for being \\"on call\\"). The hallmark of the precariat class is the condition of lack of job security, including intermittent employment or underemployment and the resultant precarious existence.Guy Standing (May 24, 2011). \\"The Precariat – The new dangerous class\\". Policy Network. The emergence of this class has been ascribed to the entrenchment of neoliberal capitalism.Lorna Fox O'Mahony, David O'Mahony and Robin Hickey (eds), Moral Rhetoric and the Criminalisation of Squatting: Vulnerable Demons? (London: Routledge, 2014), p. 25. Overview Some theorists suggest that the young precariat class in Europe has become a serious issue in the early part of the 21st century. This has been linked with major populist political developments including the Brexit referendum and the presidency of Donald Trump. The global COVID-19 pandemic has particularly exacerbated food insecurity in the United States. A survey conducted by the European Council on Foreign Relations discovered that only one third of Germans and one quarter of Italians and French had enough money remaining at the end of the month for discretionary spending. The British economist Guy Standing has analysed the precariat as a new emerging social class in work done for the think tank Policy Network and the World Economic Forum. In his 2014 book entitled A Precariat Charter he argued that all citizens have a right to socially inherited wealth.Guy Standing. A Precariat Charter. Bloomsbury Academic. 2014. The latest in the series is titled The Precariat: The New Dangerous Class\\"Who will be a voice for the emerging precariat?\\", The Guardian, June 1, 2011. where he proposed basic income as a solution for addressing the problem. The analysis of the results of the Great British Class Survey of 2013, a collaboration between the BBC and researchers from several UK universities, contended there is a new model of class structure consisting of seven classes, ranging from the Elite at the top to the Precariat at the bottom. The Precariat class was envisaged as \\"the most deprived British class of all with low levels of economic, cultural and social capital.\\" This was contrasted with \\"the Technical Middle Class\\" in Great Britain in that instead of having disposable income but no interests, people of the new Precariat Class have all sorts of potential activities they like to engage in but cannot do any of them because they have no money, insecure lives, and are usually trapped in old industrial parts of the country.

It was developed by Frank Rattay and is a useful tool to approximate the influence of functional electrical stimulation (FES) or neuromodulation techniques on target neurons. It points out locations of high hyperpolarization and depolarization caused by the electrical field acting upon the nerve fiber. As a rule of thumb, the activating function is proportional to the second-order spatial derivative of the extracellular potential along the axon.  Equations  In a compartment model of an axon, the activating function of compartment n, f_n, is derived from the driving term of the external potential, or the equivalent injected current f_n=1/c\\\\left( \\\\frac{V^e_{n-1}-V^e_{n}}{R_{n-1}/2+R_{n}/2} + \\\\frac{V^e_{n+1}-V^e_{n}}{R_{n+1}/2+R_{n}/2} + ... \\\\right) , where c is the membrane capacity, V^e_n the extracellular voltage outside compartment n relative to the ground and R_n the axonal resistance of compartment n. The activating function represents the rate of membrane potential change if the neuron is in resting state before the stimulation. Its physical dimensions are V/s or mV/ms. In other words, it represents the slope of the membrane voltage at the beginning of the stimulation. Following McNeal's simplifications for long fibers of an ideal internode membrane, with both membrane capacity and conductance assumed to be 0 the differential equation determining the membrane potential V^m for each node is: \\\\frac{dV^m_n}{dt}=\\\\left[-i_{ion,n} + \\\\frac{d\\\\Delta x}{4\\\\rho_i L} \\\\cdot \\\\left( \\\\frac{V^m_{n-1}-2V^m_n+V^m_{n+1}}{\\\\Delta x^2}+ \\\\frac{V^e_{n-1}-2V^e_{n}+V^e_{n+1}}{\\\\Delta x^2} \\\\right) \\\\right] / c , where d is the constant fiber diameter, \\\\Delta x the node-to-node distance, L the node length \\\\rho_i the axomplasmatic resistivity, c the capacity and i_{ion} the ionic currents. From this the activating function follows as: f_n=\\\\frac{d\\\\Delta x}{4\\\\rho_i Lc} \\\\frac{V^e_{n-1}-2V^e_{n}+V^e_{n+1}}{\\\\Delta x^2} . In this case the activating function is proportional to the second order spatial difference of the extracellular potential along the fibers. If L = \\\\Delta x and \\\\Delta x \\\\to 0 then: f=\\\\frac{d}{4\\\\rho_ic}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{\\\\delta^2V^e}{\\\\delta x^2} . Thus f is proportional to the second order spatial differential along the fiber.  Interpretation  Positive values of f suggest a depolarization of the membrane potential and negative values a hyperpolarization of the membrane potential.

Veterinary nursing Veterinary nursing became a regulated profession in Ireland from January 2008, under the Veterinary Practice Act 2005. When the act was implemented in January 2008, unqualified staff working in veterinary practices before 2004 had a period of six months to apply for provisional registration which conferred the same rights and responsibilities as full membership. The provisional registration category ended on 31 December 2012. Following the implementation of the Veterinary Practice Act in January 2008, no individual can legally perform veterinary nursing duties unless listed on the Register or is currently undertaking a course of formal education approved by the Veterinary Council. Registered veterinary nurses must complete the required amount of continuing professional education each year to maintain their registration. A 2016 survey found that the majority of registered veterinary nurses were women, and that the average age was 32. =Qualifications= There are five programmes of study which qualify one to become a veterinary nurse in Ireland, each sanctioned by the Veterinary Council of Ireland: the 2-year diploma course at St. John's Central College in Cork, the 3-year ordinary Bachelor of Science degrees in Athlone, Dundalk and Letterkenny Institutes of Technology and the 4-year higher (honours level) Bachelor of Science degree at University College Dublin.

Tomori won the Japan's inter-high school championship in the 45 kg class in 1977, and compiled an amateur record of 16–4 (3 KOs) before turning professional. Hitoshi Misako who is the president of Misako Boxing Gym in Tokyo went to Okinawa, and encouraged Tomori to turn professional. After joining that gym in 1978, he made his professional debut at the Korakuen Hall in May of that year. In March 1979, Tomori won the annual Japanese boxing series, All-Japan Rookie King Tournament in the junior flyweight division. Although he lost on points to Kazunori Tenryū in the Japanese junior flyweight title bout in November 1979, he knocked out the sixteen-time defending champion Tenryū in the first round of the return match in February 1980 to capture the title. However he lost on points to Shūichi Hozumi in his second defense in August of that year. He competed with Masaharu Inami for the vacated title, but it also ended in a failure. Originally Tomori was an out- fighter who excelled in the speed and skill. During his professional career, he had almost mastered the in-fighting to be spotlighted. However his transformation into an in-fighter was still incomplete. So, his manager Misako made him go to the temple for the sitting meditation practice in order to discipline his mind. Tomori regained the vacant Japanese title via a close decision in October 1981, and defended it once via a unanimous decision in his first professional fight in his hometown of Naha. At that time, Misako sensed that Tomori got a boost of energy, and set a world title shot for him. On April 13, 1982, Tomori was scheduled to fight against Amado Ursúa for the WBC junior flyweight title at the Korakuen Hall. He trained under the guidance of Eddie Townsend who signed a deal with Misako Boxing Gym in March of that year. After the champion's pre-fight open workout, Koichi Wajima, Tomori's senior in the same gym, commented that he wondered if Tomori could sustain himself for three rounds. Nevertheless, he built a lead over Ursúa until the middle of the fight throwing his sharp right crosses and left jabs. In the later rounds Ursúa fought back fiercely, but was dethroned via a split decision. Ursúa expressed dissatisfaction to the decision. His first defense against Hilario Zapata was initially scheduled in Panama City on June 5, 1982. However it was postponed to July 20 and moved to the Ishikawa Sangyō Hall in Kanazawa, Ishikawa due to Tomori's rib injury. In that first defense, Tomori lost to Zapata via a split decision. Misako protested the decision of the judges to the WBC, and Tomori had a rematch with Zapata as a challenger at the Kuramae Kokugikan on November 30 of the same year. However Tomori who had believed his own victory in the previous fight, told that he would not be able to fight more than he did on July 20. He suffered a cut above his left eye from the sixth round, and was stopped in the eighth round after being floored in the seventh and eighth rounds. Some time after that fight, Tomori retired.

Veterinary medicine in the United Kingdom is the performance of veterinary medicine by licensed professionals, and strictly regulated by statute law, notably the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966. Veterinary medicine is led by veterinary physicians, termed 'veterinary surgeons' (with a different meaning to how it is used in some other anglophone countries, where it denotes a surgical specialist), normally referred to as 'vets'. Vets are often assisted by registered veterinary nurses, who are able to both assist the vet and to autonomously practice a range of skills of their own, including minor surgery under direction from a responsible vet. Other professionals are also permitted to perform some animal treatment, through exemptions in the law, and these include manipulation techniques such as physiotherapy, chiropractic and osteopathy. Other alternative medicine therapies, such as homeopathy, acupuncture, phytotherapy and aromatherapy may only be performed by a licensed veterinary surgeon. The practice of veterinary medicine in the United Kingdom is regulated by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS), who licence both veterinary surgeons and veterinary nurses. Veterinary surgeons In order to practise veterinary medicine in the UK, a veterinary surgeon must hold a current registration with the RCVS. This requires a qualifying degree, usually in veterinary science or veterinary medicine. From March 2015, veterinary surgeons registered with the RCVS in the UK may optionally use the courtesy title Dr. This makes it the third clinical degree in the UK, after medicine and dentistry, to allow the use of the title Dr. The origins of veterinary surgeons parallel to human surgery are reflected in human medicine where qualified surgeons also drop their Dr designation and revert to their original title. =Education= Veterinary medicine degree courses are usually five years in length, holders of a science degree may take a four-year accelerated course and all intercalated degrees take six years. There are a limited number of places on veterinary courses each year, with only eight British Universities offering the degree (Bristol, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Nottingham, the Royal Veterinary College, London, and Surrey). Continuing professional development (CPD) is a mandatory and key part of career development. The RCVS recommends a minimum of 105 hours CPD over a three-year period. The RCVS Professional Development Phase (PDP) that was launched for new graduates in 2007 provides a structured approach to guide the new graduate towards the professional competences they need to develop in either small animal, equine or production animal practice. =Specialism= Vets may choose to specialise in various areas of veterinary medicine, through certificate qualifications, modular certificates or diplomas, with each speciality taking around two years to complete. Certificates cover a wide range of areas, including small animal medicine, small animal surgery, large animal medicine, welfare ethics and law, public health, cardiology, orthopaedics and advanced veterinary practice (Cert AVP). There is a large and potentially confusing array of post-nominal titles in the UK veterinary profession. Levels of credibility vary. In particular, Certificate level qualification does not qualify a veterinary surgeon as a specialist. With further training, extensive professional experience and by publishing articles in a particular subject area, it is possible to gain Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS) Recognised Specialist Status. In 2012, the ruling council of the RCVS adopted a report from the Calman Committee into specialisation in the UK veterinary profession, accepting that only those veterinary surgeons recognised by the RCVS as specialists and placed on a register held by the RCVS could be truly held up as \\"Specialist\\". Vets may undertake the training to become an Official Veterinarian (OV) which authorises them to carry out tasks on behalf of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, such as testing cattle for tuberculosis or issuing of documentation for the export of animals and animal products. =Employment= Most veterinary surgeons work in private practice, either in a general practice, or specialising in one type of animal (small animal, equine, zoo animal etc.). Newly qualified veterinary surgeons usually work as assistants for some time before being offered the opportunity to become a partner or a principal. Becoming a partner involves increased responsibility, the need for more business and management skills and a financial input into the practice. Some vets are also employed by animal welfare charities who offer treatment to the public, such as Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA) and The Blue Cross. There are also opportunities to work for government services, including APHA (the Animal and Plant Health Agency) who are responsible for the control and eradication of major notifiable diseases, animal welfare, promotion of international trade and certain public health functions related to residues in meat and investigation of food safety incidents, and scanning surveillance, or the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) who licence veterinary medicines. It is also possible to pursue a research and/or teaching career within universities or research bodies. Veterinary nurses Veterinary Nurses are the primary paraveterinary workers in the United Kingdom and work alongside vets. Veterinary Nurses must be registered and follow a strict code of conduct. Veterinary Nurses have a scope of autonomous practice within which they can act for the animals they treat. Under schedule 3 of the Veterinary Surgeons act they can perform many complex procedures include minor surgery, admission of intravenous fluid therapy and parenteral nutrition, performing diagnostic imaging and monitoring anaesthesia. Preventative medicine is also an important part of the veterinary nurse’s role with nurse clinics and consultations becoming increasingly common. Nurse led clinics may cover such areas as nutrition and weight management, management of the diabetic or senior patient, parasite control, vaccinations, puppy and kitten socialisation, dental care and wound care. =Registration= All veterinary nurses must be registered with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS). Registered Veterinary Nurses have dispensations in law (the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966, amended in 2002) to undertake certain procedures to include minor surgery and anaesthesia on animals under veterinary direction. Registered Veterinary Nurses (RVNs) are bound by a code of professional conduct and are obliged to maintain their professional knowledge and skills through ongoing CPD. Those VN's listed after 2002 are automatically registered. =Education= RVNs train for the Register through either a two to three year further education diploma programme or via a qualifying foundation or honours degree which can be three to four years. All student nurses must complete a minimum of 2100 hours of work experience in general veterinary practice during their training. RCVS badges are engraved with the nurse's personal badge number, and as of 2012 are available with the additional engraving ‘registered’ for RVNs. VN's can further their formal training and gain additional postnominal letters by completing one of many specialist certificates and/or by achieving the RCVS Diploma in Advanced Veterinary Nursing (DipAVN) by following a course of study in one or more of three pathways: Small animal nursing, Equine nursing, and Veterinary nursing education. The streamlined RCVS DipAVN replaced the DipAVN(Medical) and DipAVN(Surgical) formerly administered by the BVNA up until 2005. The DipAVN is offered through Myerscough College in Lancashire since 2007 and more recently through Harper Adams University, some modules are also available from the Royal Veterinary College in conjunction with the University of London. =Representation= UK Veterinary Nurses are represented by the British Veterinary Nursing Association (BVNA). =History= Prior to 1979, the term \\"nurse\\" was reserved for members of the General Nursing Council, but it was not until 1984 that the term \\"veterinary nurse\\" was permitted to be used. Animal nursing assistants Lay staff, without formal qualification or status may be called animal nursing assistants (the BVNA approved term), veterinary care assistants, or veterinary care assistants. These lay staff have usually undertaken some basic veterinary nurse training but are limited by law as to the procedures they may undertake on animals. They work alongside qualified vets and veterinary nurses to provide care and support to animal patients and their owners.

Biography  His father was a schoolteacher. He studied with the engraver and art dealer Friedrich Weber in Augsburg. His drawings and graphic prints brought him to the attention of the court painter. After completing his education he was employed by Herzberg, an academic bookstore in Augsburg, where he created popular prints. In 1809, after a brief stay in Munich, he joined the firm of picture book publisher Friedrich Campe (1777-1846) in Nuremberg, for which he worked until his death. In total, his oeuvre includes about 5000 drawings and etchings, which he created for Campe and several other art publishers in Augsburg and Nuremberg, including , and Georg Ebner. He focused on illustrations of battles and other historical events, such as \\"Luther at the Diet of Worms\\", as well as events of his own time - the Napoleonic Wars, the German War of Liberation against Napoleon, and later the Greek War of Independence. In 1828 he made a series of drawings on children's games. He was also known as a prominent German political cartoonist of the early 19th Century. His cartoons, directed against Napoleon Bonaparte, are still reproduced in present-day history books.

RMG has a network of clinics with family physicians, specialists and dental surgeons and owns Raffles Hospital, a tertiary care hospital in Singapore, which accommodates surgical centres, medical laboratories and 24 specialist centres in various areas like Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Cardiology, Oncology and Orthopaedics. RMG’s medical practice is based on the Group Practice Model. RMG has its own consumer healthcare division which develops and distributes nutraceuticals, supplements, vitamins and medical diagnostic equipment. RMG is a member of the Mayo Clinic Care Network.  History  = Founding = In 1976, the group's founders, Dr Loo Choon Yong and Dr Alfred Loh, opened their first two clinics in Singapore's Central Business District with the aim of providing medical services to corporate clients. By 1989, this had grown to five clinics and it was then that the two friends decided to incorporate their clinics into a medical practice group. Expanding after its incorporation, RMG moved into Singapore's HDB heartlands with their first neighbourhood clinic in 1993. The first of these areas included Telok Blangah, Bishan, Ang Mo Kio, Siglap, Tampines, Pasir Ris and Bedok. In 1990, RMG tendered and obtained a contract with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore to provide medical services to the passengers transiting through Changi International Airport as well as airport workers. This also marked RMG's first 24-hour clinic. Patients of Raffles Medical Clinics that required specialist care were initially referred to the public hospitals or private specialists. In 1991, RMG appointed specialists in its medical staff. The Group consolidated its specialist service in 1993 with the opening of Raffles SurgiCentre at No. 182 Clemenceau Avenue – the first free-standing day surgery centre at Southeast Asia. It had four operating theatres, 28 recovery beds and two beds in intensive care unit. By 1996, the network of clinics had grown to 30 branches covering most parts of Singapore. When Raffles SurgiCentre saw a lack of space for further expansion, Dr Loo began looking for a site to build a hospital. They eventually settled on Blanco Court, a commercial building at the intersection of North Bridge Road and Ophir Road. Construction works to convert it into a hospital began in 1999. This culminated in the opening of the 380-bed Raffles Hospital on 31 March 2001. It consists of 24 different specialist centres which provides specialist services such as obstetrics and gynaecology, cardiology, oncology and orthopaedics. Today, the Group is present in Singapore, China, Vietnam, Cambodia and Japan. The Group runs a network of 106 multi-disciplinary clinics across Singapore and medical centres in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Osaka. Raffles Medical Group also has representative offices in Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Brunei and Bangladesh, as well as associates throughout the Asia-Pacific region.

She was built in 1987 by Chantiers du Nord et de la Mediterranee, Dunkirk (Yard No 325) for Societe Nationale des Chemin de Fer Francais (SNCF) as a multi-purpose passenger and roll-on roll-off ferry for lorries and railway vehicles. After the introduction of Eurotunnel there was no need for a train ferry, so SNCF was losing money running her. She was acquired by SNAT and Stena Sealink in 1989, which operated the Nord Pas-de-Calais until 31 December 1995. From 1 January 1996 SNAT operated as SeaFrance. The vessel was renamed SeaFrance Nord Pas-de- Calais. SeaFrance operated until November 2011, and was liquidated on 9 January 2012. Eurotunnel won the bid for the three of the former SeaFrance vessels the original name of the vessel was restored, dropping the SeaFrance prefix. MyFerryLink started running on 20 August 2012, although Nord Pas-de- Calais joined in November 2012 following a refit. Following MyFerryLink's cessation of operations, mostly cited due to financial issues, the ferry was used directly by Eurotunnel to carry hazmat cargoes that are not allowed on regular train services. Service history Nord Pas-de-Calais was built in 1987 by Chantiers du Nord et de la Mediterranee, Dunkerque for SNCF as a train ferry. She operated on the Dover (Western Docks) to Dunkerque route; in addition, she also worked as a freight vehicle ferry between Dover and Calais. Nord Pas-de-Calais had limited accommodation for 80 passengers. She stopped running as a train ferry because of low traffic due to the opening of the Channel Tunnel which offered a much quicker option for trains to cross the border. The last sailing was from Dover on 22 December 1995. The Nord Pas-de- Calais ran in a joint operation with SNAT and Stena Sealink. She was given TOPS number 99001, previously used by MV Suffolk Ferry. = SNAT = In 1989, ownership was changed to ' (SNAT). On 12 July 1995 it was announced that the agreement between Stena Sealink Line and French partners SNAT would terminate on 31 December 1995. From that time onwards SNAT would trade as SeaFrance. = SeaFrance = In 1996, Nord Pas-de-Calais was renamed SeaFrance Nord Pas-de- Calais, operating for SeaFrance as a vehicle ferry between Dover and Calais. On 3 July 1996, she was laid up at Dunkerque and remained there until 29 November when she was introduced as an ordinary freight vessel between Calais and Dover. In November 2011, she was laid up in Dunkerque port, due to the commercial court ordering that SeaFrance be liquidated. =Eurotunnel/MyFerryLink= On 20 August 2012 after Seafrance was liquidated MyFerryLink began commercial service. The SeaFance Nord Pas-de-Calais was renamed Nord Pas-de-Calais. She started service with MyFerryLink under the ownership of Eurotunnel in November 2012, after a full refit. =FRS Iberia= Renamed Al Andalus Express and registered under the Cypriot flag, the Nord- Pas-de-Calais was chartered from Eurotunnel by FRS Iberia, and entered dry dock in Campamento, near Algeciras for refit. She currently operates between Spain and Morocco. =Seaborne Freight= In October 2017 the ship was said by Ferry Shipping News to be lined up for use by Seaborne Freight for a freight service from Ramsgate to Ostend from \\"March\\" but it was not specified in which year and was not confirmed by Seaborne. Seaborne had been contracted by the British government to provide additional ferry capacity in the event of disruption caused by a no-deal Brexit and the ship is one of the few small enough to fit Ramsgate's restricted docks. However, at the beginning of February the British government announced that it was cancelling the contract as Seaborne's backers, the Irish company Arklow Shipping, had withdrawn from the agreement.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 27, 2011, and was seen by around 5.6 million people during this broadcast. In the episode, Homer becomes an account manager for Mr. Burns after successfully hosting a viral marketing event for Krusty the Clown. Meanwhile, Lisa is teaching Bart how to read classic novels like Little Women. Homer's new job affects his family as he becomes more distant and in the end he has to choose between his family or his new job. The episode's title references The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit. The episode was written by Jeff Westbrook and directed by Steven Dean Moore. It functions mainly as a parody of the television show Mad Men, and features the guest voices of Mad Men actor John Slattery and creator Matthew Weiner. Critics found the episode to be average in quality, receiving criticism for the wasted opportunities with the Mad Men parody. Plot Krusty the Clown is about to perform a stunt when his agents mention that there is trouble with Krusty's own brand of vodka, Absolute Krusty. To make it popular, the agents insist that Krusty hold a tastemaker party at the home of a Springfield trendsetter. At the party, the adults are having a fantastic time until Mr. Burns arrives and frightens the guests. Homer ends up saving the party by singing karaoke with Burns. Based on the party's success, Burns promotes Homer to \\"Account Man\\" for the Springfield Nuclear Plant. Robert Marlow, a seasoned account veteran, takes Homer under his wing and shows Homer what the high life is like in the corner office. The job changes Homer into a sad individual, who drinks in the dark and complains about the meaninglessness of his job. When Homer's long hours at the office become the norm and Homer becomes distant from his family, a family vacation with Marge and the children help him realize that family always comes before work. Meanwhile, Lisa introduces Bart to a new literary world which sparks his interest in reading classic novels. In the beginning, Bart struggles with reading and suggests that he should just get a job where he does not have to read. Lisa insists and Bart eventually learns to read properly. When the bullies watches him reading a classic novel at school, they force him to read Little Women to them. Meanwhile, both Marge and Burns want Homer to go on the same rafting trip. Homer starts with being on his family's raft, and then swims back and forth between that and Burns's raft. Marge discovers that he has double booked the weekend while both rafts float near a waterfall, and is upset that he chose to do work on a family outing. Homer can only save one raft, and he saves the one containing his family. As Burns and the executives are about to go over the waterfall, Marlow rides up on a motorboat and carries Burns to safety, while the executives fall over the edge. Though he is annoyed at the incident, for cutting expenses by six percent, Burns calls it even with Homer, who then decides to spend the rest of the trip with his family, but trips and goes over the waterfall by himself, but is completely unharmed and finds gold. Later, at their house, Homer tells Marge that he is a safety inspector again. Fireworks go off outside, and it is revealed that they were caused by a fire at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, presumably because Homer failed at his job. Production \\"The Man in the Blue Flannel Pants\\" was written by Jeff Westbrook and directed by Steven Dean Moore. It featured John Slattery, Matthew Weiner, and Kevin Michael Richardson as guest voices. Weiner is the creator, writer, and showrunner of the television show Mad Men, in which Slattery portrays the character Roger Sterling. The entire A-Plot of the episode was a parody of Mad Men. Homer transforms into the lead character from Mad Men, Don Draper, and Slattery's character Robert Marlowe shares similarities with Roger Sterling. Weiner's role in the episode was a brief cameo as one of the businessmen on the rafting trip with Mr. Burns. The lead actor of Mad Men, Jon Hamm, did not appear in the episode, but previously appeared in the season 22 episode \\"Donnie Fatso\\" as a different character. \\"The Man in the Blue Flannel Pants\\" even recreated a scene from Mad Men, in which a lawnmower runs loose in an office. In an interview with IGN in 2011, the showrunner of the episode, Al Jean, named Mad Men as one of the two television shows he always makes time to watch. The music in the episode was edited by Chris Ledesma. In his own blog, he explains that this episode required very little musical scoring. In some cases, the musical score is used to take away focus from the scenes that did not work as well as planned. If the episode on the other side is well-scripted and features strong performances from the voice cast, then the music becomes a distraction. Ledesma thought that the \\"episode offers a nice balance of dialogue and music.\\" Of the music that was used, the theme from the 1965 film Moment to Moment, which was scored by Henry Mancini, was featured during the montage of Homer working at his new job. The episode ends with a piece of music, which is the music composer Alf Clausen's version of the Mancini theme. In total five minutes of music was used for the episode. The episode featured several references to the character Mr. Burns's old age. When Burns is requesting a song from the discjockey, he asks for \\"anything by Prince... Wilhelm, of Prussia?\\". Prince Wilhelm of Prussia was second in line to the German throne and lived from 1906 to 1940. Instead, the discjockey plays \\"Come Josephine in My Flying Machine\\" from 1910. Other Mr. Burns quotes include \\"How ironic. I survive the Titanic by making a raft out of steerage passengers... and now this.\\" and the RMS Titanic sank in 1912. Release The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 27, 2011. It was watched by approximately 5.61 million people during this broadcast. The show received a 2.6 Nielsen rating in the demographic for adults aged 18–49, which was a 4% drop from the previous episode \\"The Book Job\\", and a six percent audience share. It was preceded by The Cleveland Show and became the highest-rated program in Fox's Animation Domination lineup that night in terms of total viewers, finishing higher than Family Guy (5.50 million), American Dad! (4.48 million), The Cleveland Show (3.67 million), and Allan Gregory (3.18 million). The episode did however not rate higher than Family Guy in the 18–49 demographic. Seven days after the initial airing, the episode had a 19.2% increase in the 18–49 demographics from DVR viewings, raising the overall ratings to 3.1. The overall viewership increased with 15.7% to 6.49 million viewers. For the week of November 21–27, 2011, \\"The Man in the Blue Flannel Pants\\" finished in 21st place in the ratings among all network prime- time broadcasts in the 18–49 demographic. Since airing, \\"The Man in the Blue Flannel Pants\\" has been generally received as being average in quality by television critics. The A.V. Clubs Hayden Childs gave the episode an overall rating of B- and found that the episode \\"wasn’t particularly funny but neither was it particularly bad.\\" She praised the episode for \\"a strong storyline\\" and \\"elements that often crop up in the better episodes, like a focus that does not stray too far from the Simpson family and a B-plot that works\\". Despite this, she felt that the \\"jokes are so low-key and mild that the episode zooms by without raising a single chuckle or smirk.\\" Similarly, Jason Hughes of AOL TV commented that \\"[w]hile it was a charming enough episode, there were no stand-out moments of clever satire or unexpected twists.\\" Ology's Josh Harrison was slightly more negative and thought the episode was \\"charming but a bit of a comic flop\\". He concluded that the episode was nothing special and gave the episode a rating of six out of ten. On the Mad Men parody, Childs found comedic potential in Homer's transformation into Don Draper, but concluded that this was \\"where the episode could have gotten very funny very fast, but it doesn’t bring any of these jokes home.\\" She further elaborated that \\"Don Draper is a sad character, true, but there is some real comic potential in his pretensions and vanity. The writers are tapping into this aspect of his characterization to a small degree, but they aren’t really satirizing it.\\" Hughes was not impressed with the Mad Men parody and sarcastically stated that the spoof was \\"so sharp, you'll swear it's 2008\\".

She accepts and together they are able to get him back on television, hosting a show for adults that features his clown tricks. However, Annie soon begins to interfere too much, which frustrates the network executives. The episode, which contains parodies of films such as The King's Speech, The Social Network, and Black Swan, was written by cast member Dan Castellaneta and his wife Deb Lacusta. Comedian and actress Joan Rivers, who was a big fan of The Simpsons, guest starred as the character Annie. Other guest performances in the episode came from Kevin Dillon and Janeane Garofalo as themselves and Jackie Mason as Krusty's father. Reception of \\"The Ten-Per-Cent Solution\\" from television critics has been mixed, with praise directed at Rivers' appearance and the development of Krusty's character. The episode was criticized by the Parents Television Council for containing sexual dialogue. During its original American broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately nine million people. Plot During an episode of The Krusty the Clown Show, three Itchy & Scratchy cartoons are shown. This angers Krusty, the host of the show, since he thinks he should be the star of the show and not the Itchy and Scratchy characters. Meanwhile, the Simpsons visit a television museum that is soon to be closed. After a while, they come to an exhibit displaying The Adventures of Fatso Flanagan, which is one of Homer's favorite television shows. There, the family is approached by Annie Dubinsky, the agent of the actor who played Fatso Flanagan. They start chatting and become acquainted. At the Channel 6 studios, during a board meeting, Krusty is fired because \\"Today's children are uncomfortable with a clown whose every reference they have to look up on Wikipedia\\", and because Itchy and Scratchy are shown to be more popular with the children. Krusty goes to his current agent, hoping to get a new job, but the agent drops him since he got fired. After the Simpsons have left the museum, they head for Krusty Burger where they discover Krusty crying in a ball pit. Krusty is encouraged by them into making a comeback, and they inform him that they met an agent that can help him out. However, when they all go to Annie's office, Annie instantly recognizes Krusty and angrily slams the door before he gets a chance to enter. It is revealed that Annie was the one who discovered Krusty, became his first agent, and was responsible for his rise to success. They also had a romantic relationship together. However, once he achieved fame, Krusty fired Annie and replaced her with a more acclaimed agent, and as a result their relationship ended. Back in the present, he begs her to take him back as a client, and she eventually accepts. Krusty starts performing his clown tricks at a theater in front of adults, and not children like before. This is because Annie knows that there is nothing adults enjoy more than the things they liked as children. The performances are praised by both the audience and the critics, and Krusty and Annie initiate a relationship again. Soon, a premium cable television network called HBOWTIME (an obvious portmanteau of HBO and Showtime, straight down to their parody of HBO's longtime slogan, \\"It's not just TV, it's more expensive.\\") gives Krusty his own show and Annie is hired as the producer on his demand. The stars of the series Entourage, such as Kevin Dillon, become Krusty's assistants. The network executives soon become frustrated with Annie for meddling too much in the show. For example, she refuses to let Janeane Garofalo appear only because Garofalo is funnier than Krusty. She also runs over an intern with a stage car for sharpening her pencil too much. The executives decide to fire Annie, but Krusty refuses to continue without her. The couple therefore turns to another network where they start a show called Sex Over Sixty, with them as the stars. Production Joan Rivers guest starred in the episode as Annie. \\"The Ten- Per-Cent Solution\\" was written by Dan Castellaneta, who voices characters such as Homer and Krusty on The Simpsons, and his wife Deb Lacusta. American comedian and actress Joan Rivers guest starred in the episode as Annie. She recorded her lines in March 2011. In an interview with E! News at that time, Rivers noted that this was not her first animated voice-over role, though it was her biggest one yet. She further added that she is a fan of the show because it is \\"so clever and so funny on so many levels. So when they called and said, 'Do you want to do it?' without even reading a script I said, 'Absolutely.'\\" Adam Buckman, a former television columnist at the New York Post, noted on his blog that the story of the episode is similar to a period in Rivers' life at the end of the 1980s. At that time, she was hosting The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers on the Fox network. When Rivers challenged Fox executives who wanted to fire her husband Edgar Rosenberg as the show's executive producer, the network fired them both. Rosenberg committed suicide just three months later. Buckman wrote that the story of \\"The Ten-Per-Cent Solution\\" was \\"no doubt devised with Rivers’ approval and possibly with her input\\", and that \\"only a comedian of her stature and experience\\" would attempt to spoof a personal tragedy such as this one. Other guest stars in the episode include actor Kevin Dillon and stand-up comedian Janeane Garofalo as themselves, and stand-up comedian Jackie Mason in a minor reprisal of his role as Krusty's father, speaking only one line. Several references to popular culture, including a meta-reference to The Simpsons, are included in \\"The Ten- Per-Cent Solution\\". The three The Itchy & Scratchy cartoons that are shown at the beginning of the episode as Krusty is hosting his show are all parodies of films released in 2010: the first one, titled The Cat's Speech, is a parody of The King's Speech; the second one, titled The Social Petwork, parodies The Social Network in that the storyline is partially explained through the use of screens containing nothing but text; and the final one, titled Black and Blue Swan, references Black Swan. After the three cartoons are shown, Krusty points out that \\"It’s like those parodies were written when the movies came out, but it took so long to animate them that we look dated and hacky!\\" This is a reference to the long time it takes to produce an episode of The Simpsons—hence why cultural references on the show can often be seen as dated. Pop culture allusions at the television museum include a brief appearance by the main characters of the animated series King of the Hill as cardboard cutouts being taken down in a process similar to the opening of the show, an exhibit devoted to the sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies, and the showing of one of Homer's favorite television shows, Fatso Flanagan, which is a knockoff of the sitcom The Honeymooners. The music that is played during the parody of The King's Speech is \\"Symphony No. 7\\" by Ludwig van Beethoven, and a musical piece from the Swan Lake ballet is played during the Black Swan parody. For the King of the Hill visual gag, the Simpsons staff acquired the rights to use the actual theme song from that show. The music that is played as Krusty performs his new show in front of adults at the theater is a mixture of the old Krusty theme and the theme from Playboy After Dark, a television show hosted by Hugh Hefner that started airing in the 1960s and featured parties from a Playboy club. This musical combination was composed by Alf Clausen after The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma came with the suggestion. On his blog, Ledesma wrote that theme for Playboy After Dark \\"was cool and jazzy and just right for its time. Alf’s homage to that theme, wrapped around Krusty’s theme was very clever indeed.\\" Release and reception \\"The Ten-Per-Cent Solution\\" originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 4, 2011. It was watched by approximately nine million people during this broadcast. In the demographic for adults aged 18–49, the episode received a 4.0 Nielsen rating (a fifty-four percent increase over the previous episode) and a ten percent share. The high rating was the result of the episode being preceded by a popular National Football League game. The Simpsons became the highest-rated program in Fox's Animation Domination lineup that night in terms of both total viewers and in the 18–49 demographic, finishing ahead of new episodes of Family Guy, The Cleveland Show, and Allen Gregory. For the week of , \\"The Ten- Per-Cent Solution\\" placed seventh in the ratings among all prime-time broadcasts in the 18–49 demographic. Since airing, the episode has received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club praised the choice of having Rivers guest star since she was able to \\"employ her trademark humor within the world of The Simpsons without hijacking the plot or satire.\\" He also noted that while the Simpson family does not appear heavily, \\"Krusty is such a large part of the supporting cast that he carries this episode well. While it may seem a little funny that Castellaneta, who voices Krusty, wrote such a large part for himself, it is also a testament to his empathy for Krusty that this episode both deepens our understanding of Krusty and actually allows him growth as a character in an organic fashion.\\" Ology's Josh Harrison similarly praised \\"The Ten-Per-Cent Solution\\" for having \\"some wonderful Krusty the Klown moments and some clutch guest star appearances\\". He also cited the visual gags in the episode as \\"clever\\". Harrison concluded his review by writing that though the episode \\"wasn't Simpsons gold, it was a great chance to focus on a secondary character and an opportunity for Joan Rivers to, um, be Joan Rivers. I imagine your assessment of the episode may be based largely on your opinion of the guest star. That said? I dug it.\\" AOL TV's Jason Hughes was more negative, criticizing the episode for taking a \\"soft approach\\" to the television industry when it \\"had a chance for some sharp satire\\". He elaborated that the writers \\"had a little bit of fun talking about networks meddling in shows – as well as agents trying to control content as when Joan Rivers booted Janeane Garofalo for being funnier than Krusty – and the differences between cable original programming and broadcast programming. But they had the potential they had to make some bold statements about television and how the industry works throughout, and simply didn't.\\" Hughes did, however, like the King of the Hill appearance, which he described as a \\"fun nod\\". Further criticism came from the conservative Parents Television Council (PTC), which named The Simpsons the \\"Worst TV Show of the Week\\" because \\"The Ten-Per-Cent Solution\\" contains \\"content inappropriate for the Family Hour\\". The group wrote that the \\"frank sexual dialogue warranted a TV-14 rating, but the episode was rated TV-PG. Fox network executives surely know that almost nothing that comes out of Joan Rivers’ mouth is rated PG; but they chose to rate the program inappropriately anyway, thus blindsiding parents and children with crude content.\\" PTC cited examples such as Annie saying that every night in his early days, Krusty \\"had [his audience] rolling in the aisles, followed by a roll in the hay with me,\\" and that \\"Today's kids are less sensitive than an Army condom. They see more on TV than my mother did on her wedding night. And they don't complain about it for the next 50 years.\\" References External links \\"The Ten-Per-Cent Solution\\" at The Simpsons.com Category:The Simpsons (season 23) episodes Category:2011 American television episodes ","title":"The Ten-Per-Cent Solution"},{"id":"33103489","text":"\\"Politically Inept, with Homer Simpson\\" is the tenth episode of the twenty- third season of the American animated sitcom The Simpsons. In the episode, Bart uploads a video on YouTube in which Homer rants about airlines' horrible treatment of passengers. It quickly goes viral and Homer is eventually given his own political cable news show. Homer wins support among average Americans and is chosen by the Republicans to pick their candidate for the next presidential election. He chooses Ted Nugent, but in the end, he realizes that he made the wrong decision, so he admits on television that he is \\"full of crap\\". American musician and conservative political activist Ted Nugent made his second guest appearance on The Simpsons in this episode, which makes fun of his views on hunting and gun ownership. The episode has received generally positive reception from television critics and has been particularly praised for its satire of politics and cable news commentators. During its original broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on January 8, 2012, \\"Politically Inept, with Homer Simpson\\" was watched by about 5.07 million people and received a . Plot After a series of demeaning check-in procedures, the Simpsons board an Air Springfield plane for their trip to the wedding of a relative in Montana. The pilot announces that owing to an unforeseen jailbreak the trip will be delayed. He tells the travelers that because the plane is still on the ground, he will turn off the ventilation system. However, all of the ethnic passengers on-board are still allowed to eat their odd-smelling food, and after several hours the rest of the passengers feel sick. The pilot makes another announcement that the plane is going to taxi back to the gate and remain there for an unknown amount of time, and that the passengers cannot get off. When Homer is banned from using the bathroom, his anger boils over and he rants about the airline's horrible treatment of its passengers. Bart records a video of Homer running amok and then escapes from the plane via the wing. He uploads it on YouTube and it quickly becomes popular. Homer is invited to speak his mind on a popular cable news show called Head Butt, on which host Nash Castor and commentator Adriatica Vel Johnson argue that he will soon be forgotten. However, Homer makes a convincing rant in which he tells the viewers that unlike television blowhards such as Nash and Adriatica, he speaks for the common man. When the show is over, the cable network executives give Homer his own television show called Gut Check with Homer Simpson, where he provides a mix of populist and conservative ideas. During one episode, he pours \\"gravy of freedom\\" over a steak shaped like America, using the gravy as a metaphor for the things that make the country great. He then encourages his viewers to \\"get on the boat\\" to protest about the bad things in society, and proceeds to place a gravy boat on his head. This wins Homer a huge base of support among average Americans, and soon the \\"gravy boat movement\\" becomes popular throughout the country. When Homer is chosen by the Republicans to pick their candidate for the next presidential election, his lack of interest in the current candidates leads him to choose Ted Nugent. He invites Nugent for a visit to the Simpsons' home, where Lisa complains that Homer has made the wrong pick since Nugent is \\"out of his mind\\". Later that day, Homer has a dream in which James Madison shows him how ashamed past American presidents are of Homer. When he wakes up, he tells Lisa he will not be supporting Nugent for president anymore. He then sees a brochure on her dresser with a man posing as a president and offering help with fake dreams. Homer realizes the family faked his dream to convince him not to endorse Nugent. As a result, he angrily decides to go on television and express his support for Nugent. However, when he tries to bring out his ability to cry every time he discusses anything on television, he finds he cannot bring up those emotions because he does not truly believe in what he is saying. Homer announces on television that he \\"is full of crap\\" and reconciles with Lisa. As a result, Nugent is stripped of his position as the Republican presidential candidate. The episode ends as he sings a song about what his presidency would have been like. Production and themes Musician and political activist Ted Nugent guest starred in the episode as himself. The episode, titled \\"Politically Inept, with Homer Simpson\\", was written by John Frink and directed by Mark Kirkland. American musician and conservative political activist Ted Nugent guest starred in the episode as himself, providing his voice for both speaking and singing parts. His song at the end of the episode is similar to his single \\"Cat Scratch Fever\\". According to Noisecreep's Kenneth Partridge, the episode makes fun of Nugent's \\"blatantly pro-gun, pro-hunting, anti-everything-liberals-hold-dear persona\\". The episode features, among other things, Nugent throwing a dead elk onto the dinner table at the Simpsons' home, as well as using some of Bart's school friends as arrows for his bow. Nugent had previously made a minor cameo in the season nineteen episode \\"I Don't Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\\" (2007). In that episode, his voice is heard in a phone call urging people to vote no on a proposition that would make crossbows illegal in public schools. He comments, \\"If we outlaw crossbows, who's gonna protect our children from charging elk?\\" \\"Politically Inept, with Homer Simpson\\" satirizes the television industry. It parodies political television shows from cable news channels such as MSNBC, CNN, and Fox News Channel that are similar to Gut Check with Homer Simpson. In an article, Mediaite's James Crugnale commented that Homer's personality as he hosts his show is a reference to conservative political commentator Glenn Beck's \\"over-the-top persona\\", and wrote that \\"In a spot-on, cheeky parody of Beck, Homer ostentatiously sobs crocodile tears as he laments a high school in Nebraska replacing football with soccer as a team sport.\\" In addition, the episode satirizes American politics and includes several references to the 2012 Republican Party presidential primaries. At one point in the episode, the character Ned Flanders comments that he supports Nugent \\"as long as he isn’t a Mormon\\", which is a reference to Mitt Romney. Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club wrote in a review that Homer's political movement \\"is clearly a parody of the Tea Party\\", noting that \\"as with the teabags of the teabagger movement, people everywhere are moved to wear gravy boats on their heads [in the episode].\\" Childs further mentioned that a follower of Homer holds a sign that references the Occupy movement, which he thought was \\"a token of the show’s desire to be an equal opportunity offender.\\" Release The episode has been praised for parodying cable news personalities such as commentator Glenn Beck. The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 8, 2012. It was watched by approximately 5.07 million people during this broadcast, and in the demographic for adults aged 18–49, it received a 2.3 Nielsen rating and a five percent share. The rating was a twenty-three percent decrease from the previous episode, \\"Holidays of Future Passed\\"; however, much of \\"Politically Inept, with Homer Simpson\\" faced strong competition from the end of a highly rated National Football League playoffs game on CBS. The episode became the second highest-rated broadcast in Fox's Animation Domination lineup for the night in terms of both total viewers and adults aged 18–49. Since airing, \\"Politically Inept, with Homer Simpson\\" has received generally positive reception from critics. Steve Newton of The Georgia Straight called it \\"one of the funniest Simpsons I've seen in a while\\", and David Crawford of Radio Times wrote that the satire \\"may not be subtle, but it is sharp and the jokes come tumbling one after another.\\" In an article about the episode, Mediaite's James Crugnale commented that \\"The Simpsons writers have outdone themselves tonight, with this no-holds-barred parody of the over-the-top bloviating shenanigans of some cable news personalities.\\" Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club thought it was a \\"solid episode\\" that peaked in the middle with the satire of politics. He had mixed feelings about the first part of the episode revolving around airline travel, criticizing the fluctuating quality of the jokes. He wrote that \\"writer John Frink is able to draw out some moderately amusing gags among a few stinkers.\\" Childs further criticized Nugent's guest appearance in the third act, noting that it \\"falls flat when the show cannot decide how to mock [Nugent] without really offending him,\\" and the fake dream sequence, which he described as \\"unfunny and sitcommy\\". He concluded that \\"The Simpsons has done plenty of political satire over the years and still may never improve over season six’s 'Sideshow Bob Roberts'. The middle section of this episode had moments that were in the same league, though\\". In February 2012, \\"Politically Inept, with Homer Simpson\\" was listed by Matt Zoller Seitz of New York magazine as one of \\"Nine Latter-Day Simpsons Episodes That Match Up to the Early Classics\\".

Constructed between 1230 and 1234, the cathedral was also the last of these churches to be built, completed just three years before the invasion. Unlike most of the other pre-Mongol Vladimir-Suzdal churches, the St. George Cathedral was not designated as the World Heritage site. The cathedral was designated by the Russian government as an architectural monument of federal significance (#3310181000). History In the 12th century, the political and cultural center of Rus slowly moved from Kiev to Vladimir. Yuryev-Polsky was founded by Yuri Dolgorukiy, prince of Rostov and Suzdal, in 1152. The name of the town derives from St. George (Russian Yuri is one of the versions of the name George). Yury Dolgorukiy also built the cathedral consecrated to St. George, which stood inside the fortress. It is presumed that the cathedral was similar to the Saint Saviour Cathedral in Pereslavl-Zalessky and to the Saint Boris and Saint Gleb Church in Kideksha, which survived to our days. Yuri's son, Andrey Bogolyubsky, moved the capital of the principality to Vladimir, and Yuryev-Polsky remained under the control of Vladimir princes until 1212. The interior, including the dome. In 1212, Yuryev-Polsky became a center of a separate principality and given to Sviatoslav, a son of Vsevolod the Big Nest. By 1230, the old cathedral was considered to be irreparable, and Prince Sviatoslav personally supervised the construction of the new Saint George Cathedral, which was completed in four years. The new cathedral was considered to be a masterpiece, and used as an example by the builders of the Assumption Cathedral, the first stone building in Moscow, in 1326. The exterior of the cathedral was covered by stone carvings. In 1252, Sviatoslav was buried in the cathedral. In the 1460s, the cathedral collapsed, which at the time was considered a national disaster. Vasili Yermolin was sent to Yuryev-Polsky to repair the building. He claimed to restore the cathedral in the original form, however, it became apparent later, that the new shape was far from the original, and some of the carvings lost their meaning. In the 17th century, a tent-roof bell-tower was erected next to the cathedral, and in the beginning of the 19th century, two new parts were appended to the building. In the 20th century, all of them were demolished, and the cathedral stands now in the middle of a meadow, so that there are panoramic views from all sides. In Soviet times, it was turned into a museum. Architecture Detail of the stone carving, eastern portal The cathedral is and was originally built asymmetrically. Its main volume is a square supported by four columns in the middle. The columns are square in cross-section. The eastern side is an apse. During the collapse in the 15th century the northern wall survived the best. All other walls were partially destroyed (the southern wall suffered the most of all), and, in particular, much of the stone carving from the exterior of the cathedral was torn in pieces. Although at the time the exterior stone carving were considered to be out-of-fashion, Yermolin during the restoration works made attempts to put the stories together. In particular, he was able to put together two stones with the Holy Trinity image in the south portal. However, since there were panoramic images of the whole surface of the cathedral prior to the collapse, and many of the carved stones were destroyed, Yermolin was not able to identified all the stories, and put many stones in random order. Some of the stories were actually used for construction, and their carvings were buried inside the walls; other stones landed in neighboring farms. Some of the latter were later recovered by Pyotr Baranovsky during the Soviet times renovation. Currently, most of the original carvings have been reconstructed on paper. The stone carvings of the St. George Cathedral combine human and animal forms, performed as reliefs, with floral ornamental motives, carried out in the fine carving techniques. This combination has been known in frescoes of Saint Boris and Saint Gleb Church in Kideksha and of the Nativity Cathedral in Suzdal, however, for the sculpture, the combination is unique for Rus. It is thought that the stone carvings were done by two groups of artists. One, consisting of 12 artists, was doing the reliefs, whereas another group of 18-24 was working on the floral ornaments.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 12, 2012. The episode parodies the MythBusters program in that Bart and Milhouse are inspired by a show called MythCrackers to debunk some urban schoolyard legends. The hosts of MythBusters, Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, guest starred in the episode as themselves, while actor Michael Cera played Lisa's new love interest Nick. \\"The Daughter Also Rises\\" received a 2.0 Nielsen rating in the demographic for adults aged 18–49, and was viewed by around 4.26 million people. Plot In a very surprising move on Valentine's Day, Marge allows Homer to have a guys' night out with Bart as her Valentine's Day gift to him while she and Lisa go to a restaurant for dinner. While Homer and Bart have a good time and bond as father and son, Marge finds she has little in common with Lisa and distracts herself at the buffet table. During this, Lisa spots a handsome boy named Nick through a crack in the wall between their tables. The two become attracted to each other and begin dating. Eventually, Lisa invites Nick over to meet the rest of her family. However, despite being impressed by Nick, Marge warns Lisa not to spend too much time with him, worried that Lisa is becoming too different from her. Confused at this, Lisa goes to Grampa for advice. Grampa tells her the story of Pyramus and Thisbe, two lovers who would talk through a crack in the wall between their houses as their families hated each other. They kissed underneath a Mulberry tree, signifying their eternal love. Inspired by this, Lisa asks Grampa to drive her and Nick to Mulberry Island by sunset so they can share a moment of eternal love, and he agrees, stealing his retirement home's shuttle van to drive them. However, he drops them off to make the rest of the journey when the police arrest him for stealing the van and the TV remote from the home. Homer, Marge and Bart bail him out and catch up to Lisa and Nick just as they begin rowing their boat through the river to the tree. Marge uses water shoes to skate across the river, making it to the Mulberry tree where Lisa and Nick are having second thoughts and decide to break up instead, doubting that they could devote the rest of their lives to one another. Marge comforts Lisa when she tells her the moment she wanted, and then kisses her to remind her of their own eternal mother-daughter love. Meanwhile, Bart and Milhouse are inspired by the show MythCrackers to debunk some urban schoolyard legends. At first, the students are fascinated by the myth debunking. However, this eventually works out too well and the students are left disappointed by the lack of interesting myths in school. So Bart and Milhouse come up with a way to make school fun again by creating a myth where Groundskeeper Willie is a werewolf. Production The hosts of MythBusters, Jamie Hyneman (left) and Adam Savage (right), guest starred in the episode. The episode was written by Rob LaZebnik. It parodies the Discovery Channel program MythBusters, in which hosts and special effects experts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman test the validity of different myths. Both Savage and Hyneman guest starred in the episode as themselves, hosting the MythCrackers program that Bart and Milhouse watch. Canadian actor Michael Cera guest starred in the episode as the voice of Nick. Franz von Suppé's overture Light Cavalry Overture is featured in the episode, and according to The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma, \\"I got to spend the afternoon editing and choosing just the right bars to use in the montage so the parts that [showrunner] Al Jean wants to hear are in the shots while also maintaining the right tempo and 'hitting' the right moments.\\" \\"The Daughter Also Rises\\" revealed the origins of the Scottish character Groundskeeper Willie, which had previously been the matter of a debate between Glasgow and Aberdeen, with people of both cities claiming that they live in the hometown of Willie.

The rating was a seventeen percent decrease from the previous episode the aired two weeks earlier, making this the lowest-rated episode so far of the season. However, \\"The Daughter Also Rises\\" faced strong competition from the highly rated 54th Grammy Awards, which increased its rating by forty-one percent from the previous year's awards as a result of Whitney Houston's death on February 11. The episode became the second highest-rated broadcast in Fox's Animation Domination lineup for the night in terms of both total viewers and adults aged 18–49, finishing higher than new episodes of Napoleon Dynamite, American Dad!, and The Cleveland Show, but lower than a new Family Guy episode. Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club called the episode \\"mediocre\\" and \\"lackluster\\", criticizing the lack of humor. He also wrote that the \\"worst crime of the episode appears to be a case of the guest star wagging the dog, with the show working so hard to make Lisa’s love interest a Michael Cera type that they forgot to give Michael Cera much to do in the way of acting or comedy.\\" References External links  \\"The Daughter Also Rises\\" at theSimpsons.com Category:The Simpsons (season 23) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Valentine's Day television episodes ","title":"The Daughter Also Rises"},{"id":"33103552","text":"Surendra Mohanty (21 June 1922\\\\- 21 December 1990) born in Odisha was an author who wrote in Odia.

Awards  * Sahitya Akademi Award, 1957; for Sabujapatra O Dhusara Golap. * Sharala Award, 1980; for Kulabrudha. * Central Sahitya Academy Award for Nila Saila( Blue Hill). * Sahitya Akademi Award, 1987; for Patha O Pruthibi. Selected works The four novels of Surendra Mohanty that are based on history, myth and legends are Nilasaila (Blue hill) published in 1968, Niladri Bijaya (Triumphant return to Niladri) published in 1980, Krushnavenire Sandhya (Evening on the banks of river Krishna) published in 1985 and Ajibakara Attahasa (Ajibaka's satiric laughter)published in 1987. =Nilasahiila= The most widely read and acclaimed is \\"Nilasaila\\" which is contextualized in a crucial period of Orissa's history. The events of the novel take place between the years 1727 and 1736 when Ramachandradev, the king of Khurda who is revered by the people of Orissa as the representative of Jagannath, the presiding deity of the Oriya race, converts himself into Islam and marries the daughter of the Muslim ruler of Cuttack. But when the Muslim ruler of Cuttack invades Khurda and tries to destroy the idol of Lord Jagannath, Ramachandradev fights bravely to protect the idol which symbolizes Oriya identity and sentiment. The novel gives a truthful account of contemporary Orissa, but it is more than history. It is an intense portrayal of the religious and cultural tradition of Orissa which is still an integral part of Oriya racial consciousness. =Niladri Bijaya= While Nilasaila ends with the idol of Lord Jagannath being shifted from its original place, the ratna singhasana of Puri temple, to an island in the Chilika Lake, \\"Niladri Bijaya\\" narrates the triumphant return of the idol to its original abode. Though Ramachandradev is formally a Muslim, he is eager to restore the deity to the original place and he succeeds despite the fear of being attacked by the Muslim forces. The novel ends on a tragic note when Ramachandradev and his wife are debarred from entering the temple as being non-Hindus. =Krushnavenire Sandhya= The novel \\"Krushnavenire Sandhya\\", deals with another crucial period of Orissa's history when in the early sixteenth century, Prataprudradev, the king of Orissa, loses the battle with Krushnadeva Ray, the ruler of the Vijaynagar empire. Prataprudra is forced to surrender after his son Birabhadra commits suicide in the prison. Krushnadeva Ray, who is older than Prataprudra, marries his daughter Jaganmohini as a condition of the peace treaty. Prataprudra, in frustration and anguish, turns to spiritual life and becomes an ardent follower of Sri Chaitanya. =Ajibakara Attahasa= \\"Ajibakara Attahasa\\" is set in the third century BC when Buddhism was in a state of decadence, eventually culminating in its bifurcation into the Mahayana and Hinayana sects. The novel questions the Buddhist tenets of austerity and self-control and questions the traditional estimate of emperor Ashoka as a great votary of peace and spiritual life. This novel depicts Ashoka as a strategist who professed Buddhism to keep his subjects meek and submissive. It is an irony of history, the novel suggests, that Ashoka who killed lakhs of Oriyas in the Kalinga war is idolized as a great hero and a model king.http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2008/November-2008/engpdf/65-72.pdf Complete list of works ଉପନ୍ୟାସ * ଅନ୍ଧ ଦିଗନ୍ତ * ନୀଳଶୈଳ * Kalantara * Niladri vijaya * Neti Neti * Achalatana * ଦୁଇ ସୀମାନ୍ତ * ବନ୍ଧୁ ଓ ପ୍ରିୟା * College Boy * HamsaGitee * କୃଷ୍ଣ ବେଣୀରେ ସନ୍ଧ୍ୟା * Ajibakara Attahasa Biographies * ପଥ ଓ ପୃଥିବୀ * କୁଳବୃଦ୍ଧ * ଶତାବ୍ଦ ର ସୂର୍ଯ କ୍ଷୁଦ୍ର ଗଳ୍ପ * Nayanpur express * କୃଷ୍ଣ ଚୂଡା * ମହାନଗରୀର ରାତ୍ରୀ * Ruti O Chandra * ସବୁଜ ପତ୍ର ଓ ଧୂସର ଗୋଲାପ * କବି ଓ ନର୍ତ୍ତକୀ * Maralara Mrutyu * Mahanirvana * ଯଦୁବଂଶ ଓ ଅନ୍ୟନ୍ୟ ଗଳ୍ପ * ରାଜଧାନୀ ଓ ଅନ୍ୟାନ୍ୟ ଗଳ୍ପ * ଶେଷ କବିତା * ଶେଷ ସ୍ତମ୍ଭ References Category:1922 births Category:1990 deaths Category:Rajya Sabha members from Odisha Category:2nd Lok Sabha members Category:5th Lok Sabha members Category:Indian National Congress politicians from Odisha Category:Utkal Congress politicians Category:Recipients of the Padma Shri in literature & education Category:Recipients of the Sahitya Akademi Award in Odia Category:People from Cuttack Category:Odia-language writers Category:Indian male novelists Category:20th-century Indian novelists Category:Indian male short story writers Category:Indian editors Category:20th-century Indian short story writers Category:Lok Sabha members from Odisha Category:Novelists from Odisha Category:People from Dhenkanal district Category:20th-century Indian male writers ","title":"Surendra Mohanty"},{"id":"33103553","text":"\\"Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart\\" is the fifteenth episode of the twenty-third season of the American animated television sitcom The Simpsons. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 4, 2012. In the episode, Bart is punished by Homer after letting a rabbit loose in the house. He gets revenge on his father by spray-painting images of him with the word \\"dope\\" all over Springfield. Street artist Shepard Fairey encounters Bart one night and offers him a gallery show of Bart's artworks. However, Chief Wiggum suddenly appears during the show and arrests Bart for covering the town in graffiti. It turns out that Fairey is an undercover officer working for Wiggum. The episode references the 2010 street art documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop by graffiti artist Banksy, and features guest appearances from street artists Ron English, Kenny Scharf, and Robbie Conal as themselves. Fairey, who is a long-time fan of The Simpsons, also guest starred in the episode as himself. Around 5.09 million Americans tuned in to watch \\"Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart\\" during its original broadcast. Since then, the episode has received praise from television critics for its opening sequence, which parodies the opening sequence of the medieval fantasy television series Game of Thrones. Plot As a birthday gift for Marge, Homer buys a blender designed by television chef Paula Paul. He goes to a health food store called Swapper Jack's, where Paula is giving away autographs, to have Paula sign it. Homer is impressed by the store and says he will not be shopping at the Kwik- E-Mart any more. Apu, who is there to spy, overhears Homer and the two engage in a fight until the security guards grab hold of Apu and take him away. At the signing, Homer tells Paula that Marge is a big fan of hers. Paula decides that she will call Marge live during her upcoming show to wish her a happy birthday. Meanwhile, Bart gets his mother a rabbit for her birthday. The rabbit chews through the phone lines in the Simpsons' home, causing Marge to miss Paula's call. Paula becomes furious at Marge for not answering the phone as she embarrassed herself on her show. Homer punishes Bart by locking him up in the rabbit's cage. To get revenge on Homer, Bart goes around Springfield spray-painting graffiti of Homer's face and the word \\"dope\\". When his work appears on the television news, it encourages Bart to create even more graffiti in the town. Street artists Shepard Fairey, Ron English, Kenny Scharf, and Robbie Conal encounter Bart one night when he is making some graffiti. The four tell Bart that they are impressed by his work and would like to showcase his art in a gallery show, at first Bart is unsure, but Bart remembers how Homer treated him, and then agrees. Meanwhile, the Kwik-E-Mart suffers because of the competition from Swapper Jack's. Apu ends up attempting to rob Swapper Jack's in a desperate measure, but the cashier (Snake Jailbird) convinces him to hand over the gun. Later, Apu is about to shut down the Kwik- E-Mart when his wife Manjula tells him that Swapper Jack's is closing because it was discovered they were selling monkey meat imported from Brazil as chicken. Homer initially refuses to attend Bart's show because he discovers the artwork is an insult to him, but changes his mind after Bart apologizes and writes \\"I'm sorry\\" on the hood of Homer's car. At the show, Chief Wiggum and the Springfield Police Department suddenly appear to arrest Bart for making graffiti throughout the town. It is revealed that the gallery show is a sham and that Fairey is an undercover officer who helped the police identify Bart as the graffiti artist that had been spray-painting Springfield. Since Bart is just a boy, he is not sent to jail. Instead, he is punished by once again being locked up in the rabbit cage. When Bart tells Wiggum that he has to go to the bathroom, Wiggum covers the cage with the blanket and finds Bart gone when he removes the blanket from the cage. Production Artist Shepard Fairey, a fan of The Simpsons, starred in the episode as himself. \\"Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart\\" was written by Marc Wilmore and directed by Steven Dean Moore as part of the twenty-third season of The Simpsons (2011–12). It spoofs the debated status of street art as a true form of art. The title is a reference to Exit Through the Gift Shop, a 2010 street art documentary by graffiti artist Banksy who produced the opening sequence of an earlier Simpsons episode titled \\"MoneyBART\\" (2010). The Richard Hawley song \\"Tonight The Streets Are Ours\\", which is the theme song of Exit Through the Gift Shop, is included in the episode during a montage of Bart painting graffiti in Springfield. Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club noted in his review of \\"Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart\\" that the \\"reveal that the art show was a police sting gives the show a moment to joke about the anti-art market theme from Exit Through The Gift Shop. Wiggum asks who would be stupid enough to pay for work that an amateur puts up for free in public, and the answer is, as in Banksy’s movie, the very wealthy, here represented by Mr. Burns.\\" American street artist Fairey guest starred in \\"Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart\\" as himself. The graffiti art featuring Homer's face and the word \\"dope\\" that Bart creates in the episode is a reference to Fairey's Barack Obama \\"Hope\\" poster and his OBEY Giant image. Fairey has said that The Simpsons has been one of his favorite television shows since the early 1990s because of its \\"blend of humor and social commentary\\", and he felt \\"deeply honored\\" to be included in an episode. Fairey wrote on his website that \\"Part of being on The Simpsons, is you’re being honored as a reference point in culture.\\" He described the plot of the episode as \\"great\\", adding that the staff members of the show \\"were kind enough to indulge a couple of my dialogue suggestions designed to make the social commentary more pointed (even though I had to make fun of myself to do so).\\" This was Fairey's first acting performance. Street artists English, Scharf, and Conal also guest starred in the episode as themselves. The traditional Simpsons opening sequence was replaced in this episode with a redesigned version that spoofed the opening sequence of the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones. The Game of Thrones opening shows the various locations featured in the series on a three-dimensional map of the fictional continent Westeros. In the Simpsons opening, these locations were substituted with places in Springfield, and The Wall was replaced with the Simpson family's couch. The theme song featured in the Game of Thrones opening sequence was arranged by The Simpsons composer Alf Clausen and used in the Simpsons opening as well. Nicholas McKaig, known for uploading a cappella covers of famous songs on YouTube, performed the Simpsons theme song over the closing credits of \\"Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart\\". He was recruited after a staff member of the show saw his cover of the Simpsons theme on YouTube. Release \\"Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart\\" was originally broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on March 4, 2012. It was watched by approximately 5.09 million people during this broadcast, and in the demographic for adults aged 18–49, the episode received a 2.5 Nielsen rating and a seven percent share. The episode became the second highest-rated broadcast in Fox's Animation Domination lineup for the night in terms of both total viewers and in the 18–49 demographic. \\"Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart\\" placed 25th in the ratings among all prime-time broadcasts in the 18–49 demographic, and seventh among all Fox prime-time broadcasts. Writing for The A.V. Club, television reviewer Hayden Childs gave the episode a B, commenting that \\"Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart\\" was \\"somewhat amusing and far more coherent than many recent episodes, but the satire is relatively mild. The episode curdles a bit while looking for a sweet ending, but it is otherwise solid enough.\\" Critics have praised the opening sequence that parodies Game of Thrones. Tim Surette of TV.com called it \\"one minute of genius\\", and MTV's Brandon Freeberg wrote: \\"Congratulations are in order for Matt Groening and his staff for really knocking this one out of the park.\\" Jenna Busch of Zap2it and Kelly West of Cinema Blend, both fans of Game of Thrones, named the opening the best in the history of the show. IGN's Eric Goldman commented: \\"Ah, The Simpsons. Always there for us with clever/loving parody of something we all love. Such was the case last night, when the animated series opened with an epic opening credit sequence that gave us the Springfield-inspired version of the terrific Game of Thrones credits.\\" References External links *Nicholas McKaig's cover of the Simpsons theme song on YouTube \\"Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart\\" at theSimpsons.com Category:2012 American television episodes Category:The Simpsons (season 23) episodes ","title":"Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart"},{"id":"33103559","text":"The Waybacks is a 1918 Australian silent film directed by Arthur W.

He graduated from Academy of Fine Arts in Prague in 1983. Josef Žáček's own visual language was based on geometric signs and later figural symbols through which he came to address universal issues of cultural identity and memory as well as wholly concrete phenomena of the contemporary world. In his work is frequently used principle of a central motif. The same motif appears several times alongside itself, either in paintings arranged next to each other or within the composition of a single picture. Žáček’s work stems from a clearly determined content; it reflects social and political contexts. His monumental canvases are usually monochrome compositions.Ludvik Hlaváček: Josef Žáček: Anticorps, 2017, In the late 1980s, before the fall of the Communist regime, he belonged to a group of young artists who were no longer members of the conformist Artists’ Union and wanted to exhibit freely. After efforts lasting considerable time, they succeeded in pushing through the first official gallery whose programme could include any artist. It was then that the U Řečických Youth Gallery in Prague began creating freer conditions; even non- professional artists could be invited there as guest exhibitors – meaning those who had not, for various reasons, been able to get to art college. In January 1989 he had first major exhibition at the Youth Gallery in Prague, which featured canvases in abstraction shapes on the theme of The Gospel of St Matthew. In 1994 Žáček exhibited a series of paintings at the Behémot Gallery in Prague that were inspired by events that had occurred in 1993 in Bad Kleinen. The series of evocative portraits of wanted members of the Red Army Faction entitled Searching in Lost SpaceSeries of paintings Searching in Lost Space 1993, Josef Žáček's portraits of the Red Army Faction members, 1993 is not a celebration of violent solutions, rather it highlights how society has evolved in an unnatural direction.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 6, 2012. Plot On their date night, Homer takes Marge to an action film featuring the legendary fictional spy character Stradivarius Cain (voiced by Bryan Cranston), but Homer's endless series of humorous shout-outs during the film earn him as much contempt from Marge as they do kudos from Lenny and Carl. Marge makes it clear the next morning she is still angry at Homer, and he ends up feeling sad on the job—though he soon feels much worse after Mr. Burns accidentally drives into the ladder Homer was using to fix lights and Homer ends up getting a serious concussion. Mr. Burns reluctantly agrees with the concerns of Smithers (moral) and his lawyer (legal) and gives Homer eight weeks off with pay. When Homer goes home, however, Marge's disgust with him has been matched by the discontents Bart, Lisa, and Grandpa feel about other things, so Homer decides to keep his paid leave a secret. He pretends to go to work every day and initially has a lot of fun, but soon returns to melancholy over the poor state of affairs with Marge. He is then stunned to see Cain appear to him as an imaginary friend, who will tutor Homer on how to be irresistible to Marge, starting with a lesson in confidence at a local restaurant that ends with Homer winning over the lovely wife of an angry drug lord who swears revenge. Marge learns from Lenny that Homer was out on leave, and becomes enraged at him, only for Homer to completely defuse her anger by taking Cain's advice and telling Marge the truth (that he lied about going to work, and used the time to learn to be a better husband). When they head out for a night of dancing, Montana spots them and plans to kill Homer, but Homer uses a line about lovely eyes that leads to him being forgiven. Marge then asks Homer seductively how much more leave time he has, but Homer chuckles that his paid vacation ended last week, and they just have to wait for the call from Human Resources. Meanwhile, a new smartphone-scanning policy at Springfield Elementary brings Nelson's lunch- money shakedown to a new level and leads Bart to plan revenge. When he watches Declan Desmond's muckraking documentary Do You Want LIES With That? about the Krusty Burger's shady dealings and unethical food practices, he realizes eating nothing but Krusty's fast food will be quite bad for Nelson, and gives the bully a free coupon book that leads to Nelson becoming horrifically fat and unhealthy. Lisa then takes Nelson to show his terrible fate at Krusty's, so Krusty offers Nelson free time with his personal trainer. Nelson ends up in great shape and ready to beat up more nerds than ever, but Lisa notes \\"he is tough on nerds, but easy on the eyes\\" as Bart stares at her in disbelief. Cultural references *The name of the episode is a pun on the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me *Stradivarius Cain is a take on James Bond. *Blue- eyed man is based on Tony Montana of Scarface Reception Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ grade, stating, “‘The Spy Who Learned Me’ works, and works well. The way Homer annoys Marge—by making horrible jokes during a terrible movie while being egged on by Lenny and Carl—is good fun. It allows the show to do two of the things it’s always been best at: horrible puns and movie parodies.” References External links Category:The Simpsons (season 23) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes ","title":"The Spy Who Learned Me"},{"id":"33103578","text":"The first Cullum Detuner Mark IV c. 1944 Cullum Mark V Detuner Detuner is a generic term for a jet engine test cell exhaust system muffler. Aircraft jet engine testing facilities typically require a means to vent and dampen the engine exhaust. The engine exhaust flow is \\"augmented\\" with a relatively large flow of cooling air induced by a Venturi effect into the exhaust silencing system, so the exhaust muffler is generally referred to as an \\"augmenter tube,\\" or \\"detuner\\" (UK). Interest by Douglas Jack W.Cullum in the noise generated by aircraft engines and propellers led to the design of a silencer for the W2 700 jet engine developed by Sir Frank Whittle and his team at Power Jets Ltd. This original detuner was a straight-through silencer, a simple acoustic tube. A later version consisted of four acoustic sections with a plain entry section inside the test cell, flanged and bolted together, mounted on wheels, and installed on rails to permit fore and aft movement. Each acoustic section consisted of an inner and outer casing: the outer casing was plain mild steel plate and the inner casing was perforated mild steel plate. The cavity between inner lining and outer casing was tightly packed with an acoustic absorbent material known as rock (mineral) wool. Modified versions of the prototype detuner were installed on the Rolls-Royce jet engine test beds at Clitheroe in Lancashire, Barnoldswick in Yorkshire and Derby, Derbyshire where the jet engine continued development. Detuners at Rolls-Royce, Derby The development of the detuner was inextricably linked to the development of the jet engine. As the power of the engines increased, new detuners had to be developed to cope with larger and more powerful engines.

Biography  Born in Leeds on 17 May 1906,1911 England Census records Albert & Annie Crisp and daughter living at 123 Cross Green Lane Leeds Yorks. the only daughter of Albert Edward Crisp (an examiner) and Annie Beckwith, she was baptised at the Anglican church of St Saviour Richmond Hill, Leeds in June the same year. She became a public speaker and writer on nationalism, contributing to the National Review in the 1920s. Among her books were The Rebirth of Conservatism (1931) and Why we Lost Singapore (1944). She was a British political commentator with contacts in high places at the Foreign Office.Helena Wojtczak, Notable Sussex Women: 580 Biographical Sketches, Hastings Press, 2008, By the mid-1940s she was famous as the belligerent and outspoken champion of the right-wing British Housewives' League, whose meetings frequently descended into boos, catcalls and physical tussling for control of the microphones. Hecklers once got so out of hand at the Royal Albert Hall that police were called, though she was later cheered for threatening to throw Aneurin Bevan (then Minister of Health in the Attlee Labour government) over Westminster Bridge if he brought in the National Health Service Act. The police were summoned twice to maintain order at an uproarious meeting in which she expelled several executive members amid shouted accusations of \\"dictatorship\\". She resigned her chairmanship in 1948 on personal grounds, after that the League went into decline. She was a regular contributor of provocative articles for the Sunday Dispatch; one edition in 1943 was banned in Eire because it contained her criticisms of the de Valera’s government. Crisp fought the 1943 Acton by-election as an Independent but secured only 707 out of the 8,315 votes cast. She married John Noel Becker in Westminster, London, during the spring of 1945, but retained her maiden name. Moving to the village of Smarden near Ashford in Kent, she gave birth to a daughter (Elizabeth) in the summer of 1946, to whom the Conservative MP Ida Copeland was godmother. She was subject of a patronising article referring to her as \\"the buxom, brown-eyed, voluble little woman\\", by Gordon Beckles, Scoop! biographical dictionary of journalistsFleet Street, press barons and politics: the journals of Collin Brooks, 1932-1940, ed.

In 1947 she won substantial damages for libel against the New Statesman and the following year was halfway through a similar case against the Daily Herald and expecting her son (John) when her 48-year-old husband, a senior assistant in Watts & Co, was shot dead in Singapore on 24 October 1948. He died in ambulance on way to hospital. He had been helping the police arrest a crazed man, an intruder in his office in Robinson Road (he was a special constable), when he was shot in the struggle. Because he was off-duty at the time the government denied her a pension, but after a three-year struggle she finally got £500 p.a. By then she was bankrupt, her publishing company had folded and the libel case abandoned. She was convicted of misdemeanours under the Bankruptcy Act (obtaining credit while an un-discharged bankrupt) in 1958 and twice again in the 1960s and served three terms in Holloway Prison.

She later lived in Sussex for about fifteen years during the 1950s and 1960s. During this period she at one time lived at Overs Farmhouse, Barcombe; Jigg's Cottage, Jevington; and Woodland Drive in Hove. Around 1975 she moved to Oxford possibly living with her daughter Elizabeth, after which no more is known.

He was born in Hefei, Anhui Province, on 14 May 1986.  Developments  = Internet experiences (2006–2008) =  In 2006  Vae was a sophomore in Medical College. In his spare time, he made some demos with personal computer and microphone. Some of the songs are adaptions of some famous singers', such as Jay Chou, and others are written by him and his friend. After he put these demos on the Internet with the name of \\"Vae\\", a growing number of people began to know him as a singer.  From 2007 to 2008  Vae kept writing and uploading at least one song per month. \\"The Funeral of Rose\\" () is one of those songs in that term, sung by Vae and Li Yijie. At that time, Vae did not give up imitating other famous singers, so this song really sounds like one of Jay's song, \\"The Song of Night\\" () especially at the beginning of the song. It describes a young man missing his dead girlfriend, which also follows Jay's plot. \\"If You Become the Wind\\" () is another, which is about a young man's desire for a girl to be his girlfriend. Vae refused all performance invitations in order not to affect his concentration on his academic studies. His songs and life choices engendered a lot of praise and attracted more of an audience. In 2005, Vae got the award as Chinese entertainment NET best male singer. In May 2007, Vae got the chance to be the member of the Anhui Musician's Association. One year later, he became one of the best 10 students in all of Anhui Province. In the past three years, Vae changed from just a music player to a professional popular musician. What's more, he was not only a traditional Internet singer, but he also became someone who actually improved the level of Internet specific performances. Though Vae was really popular on the Internet, no one could really tell where this fame would take him in 2008. = Independent success (2009–2010) = After graduating from college, Vae spent about half a year preparing his first personal CD. Jan 10th, 2009 a CD named Personalize () came out. Vae did all of the work personally, including composing, writing, recording and so on. Even the paper used in the package was chosen by him. The CD has nine songs, including \\"Why Not\\" (), \\"Bad Kid\\" (), \\"Shrewdness\\" (), \\"Excessive Explanations\\" () plus others. Most of which the songs are considered blues. The CD was sold in advance from 11 Dec 2008 to 21 Dec 2008 and the number of sales broke 10,000 in just ten days. The CD had no commercial promotion outside of the internet community of fans. This attracted several musical companies, however, no company would publish his independent CD because of his requirements. So, Vae passed on all companies and began to prepare his second CD Sought and Got (), which came out on January 6, 2010 and became another big success. There are nine songs in this CD, including \\"Luzhou Moon\\" (), \\"The White Horse Is Not A Horse\\" (). \\"I Don't Care\\" (), \\"Single Journey\\" (). One day after the CD being uploaded on the Internet, it became the most popular one in QQ music taking the place of Jay Chou, who had been on top for more than seven years. In addition, Vae also composed a lot of other songs during this time. \\"Two Tragedies\\" () is one of them, telling a young man's mood after breaking off with his girlfriend. \\"Your Mouth\\" () is a song Vae composed for a female singer, Jin Sha, who was in the same music company with Vae. But by then, Vae had become a musical legend all on his own. = 2011–present = In March 2011 Vae finally got into an international musical company, Ocean Butterflies. This time, the rules were changed for him so that Vae was allowed to complete his third CD, as before, while the company would be only in charge of promotion, which never happened to any other singers. The CD \\"Socra Without 'tes\\" () was published on 1 Apr 2011. Ten songs in this CD talk about philosophy in everyday life and love, such as \\"Imagination\\" () and \\"Doctors\\" (). The number of viewers reached one million within one day after one single's release. After the publication, Vae started his traveling around the country to take part in the activities with fans. Beijing, Shanghai, Hefei, Nanjing are all included. Besides, Vae began to get in some commercial activities. He has been one of the spokesmen of an online game \\"天龙八部\\", which had been adapted from Jin Yong's novel. On the Internet, there is a saying that Ocean Butterflies has saved a big fortune by promoting a new singer because Vae is not a new guy. He has been popular on his own. In July 2012, Xu Song published his 4th album Travelling in the dream.

Military and legal career Danny Efroni was drafted into the Israel Defense Forces in 1976, after graduating from the Hebrew Reali School of Haifa. He served in an operational unit in the Intelligence Directorate. In 1990, after receiving his law degree from Tel Aviv University School of Law, Efroni joined the Military Advocate General as a military prosecutor in the West Bank. In 1993 he returned to the Intelligence Directorate to head a regional branch of the operational unit he served in previously. In 1996, Efroni returned to the service in the Military Advocate General. He fulfilled the positions of the Deputy Chief Military Prosecutor (1996–2000), the District Attorney for the Northern Command (2000–2003) and the Chief Military Defense Attorney (2003–2004). In 2004, he was appointed Deputy Military Advocate General. In 2009, Efroni retired from the army, but returned to service in August 2011 when he was named successor to Chief Military Advocate General Avichai Mandelblit.

While the term can refer to global variables, it is primarily used in the context of nested and anonymous functions where some variables can be neither in the local nor the global scope. In Lua they are called the upvalues of the function. Programming in Lua (first edition), \\"27.3.3 – Upvalues\\"  Examples  = Nested functions = In the Python 3 example that follows there is a nested function \`inner\` defined in the scope of another function \`outer\`. The variable \`x\` is local to \`outer\`, but non- local to \`inner\` (nor is it global): def outer(): x = 1 def inner(): nonlocal x x += 1 print(x) return inner In Javascript, the locality of a variable is determined by the closest \`var\` statement for this variable. In the following example, \`x\` is local to \`outer\` as it contains a \` var x\` statement, while \`inner\` doesn't. Therefore, x is non-local to \`inner\`: function outer() { var x = 1; function inner() { x += 1; console.log(x); } return inner; } = Anonymous functions = In the Haskell example that follows the variable \`c\` is non-local in the anonymous function \`\\\\x -> x + c\`: outer = let c = 1 in map (\\\\x -> x + c) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  Implementation issues  Non-local variables are the primary reason it is difficult to support nested, anonymous, higher-order and thereby first-class functions in a programming language. If the nested function or functions are (mutually) recursive, it becomes hard for the compiler to know exactly where on the call stack the non-local variable was allocated, as the frame pointer only points to the local variable of the nested function itself and there can be an arbitrary number of activation records on the stack in between. This is generally solved using access links or display registers. If the nested function is passed as an argument to a higher-order function a closure needs to be built in order to locate the non- local variables. If the nested function is returned as a result from its outer function (or stored in a variable) the non-local variables will no longer be available on the stack. They need to be heap allocated instead, and their lifetime extend beyond the lifetime of the outer function that declared and allocated them. This generally requires garbage-collection.

Based on this report in July 2014 it was discussed to lower the upfront costs of cars and increase the costs of car use. This would be in the favor of the interests of the Royal Dutch Shell since according to studies the upfront costs will reduce more the traffic than the consuming taxes. Traffic poses large problems e.g. in the demand of land areas and parking places. Lower ticket prices would increase the use of Public transport.

The chain serves New York-style pizza as well as several different types of Italian cuisine to include: soups, salads, pastas, calzones and dessert. The company's motto is \\"If it isn't fresh, don’t serve it,\\" and has over 50 locations both domestic and international. International locations are open in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah, UAE. All locations offer dine-in, takeout, delivery and catering.  History  Chef Anthony Russo is the son of first-generation Italian immigrants and grew up in a New Jersey home where the kitchen was the center of family life. There was always cooking and baking at home, and many of the ingredients came from the family garden. Just the way Grandpa and Nonna Russo did back in Avellino, Italy. These experiences stuck with young Anthony as his family moved to Galveston, Texas, in 1978. His father opened Russo’s Italian Restaurant, which quickly became a local favorite. Just like that, Anthony found a second home in the restaurant kitchen. By the age of 12, he was learning family recipes from relatives who flew in from Naples and Sicily each summer. Making pizza and scacciata (calzones) became his passion. Since launching in 1990 in Houston, his original approach to New York-style pizza and Italian cuisine has been a booming success from coast to coast, with franchise locations nationwide and expanding internationally. The world over, Russo’s New York-style pizza has come to symbolize the excitement of the city where traditions meet and travelers stand in line for a slice of the action. It’s all about the food, and that’s what Russo’s has been all about since 1992. Russo's secret recipe is family recipes, which are over 100 years old, with their custom blend of spices and proprietary ingredients, that will leave competitors far behind.

It is situated in Cambridge Gulf approximately north of Wyndham and covers an area of about . The island has a maximum height of approximately . The island, the gulf and many other features surrounding the gulf were named by Philip Parker King who visited the area in 1819 aboard the survey cutter HMS Mermaid but left after spending eleven days charting the gulf, being unable to find supplies of freshwater in the mudflats, rivers and hills that surround the Cambridge Gulf. King named the island after the Duke of Cambridge at the time, Prince Adolphus. One of the earliest European burials in Western Australia occurred on Adolphus Island at Nicholls Point, ten years before the foundation of the Swan River Colony, during King's time in Cambridge Gulf. The following passages from King's journals start on 27 September 1819. > I have this day to record the death of one of the crew, William Nicholls, > who, for some time past, and particularly during the last three days, had > been suffering from a dropsical complaint; his death was occasioned by > suffocation, having very imprudently laid down with his head to leeward > while we were under sail: this poor fellow had been for nearly three months > on our sick list; he was a native of Norfolk Island, and, when in health, > had been one of my most useful and attentive men. > September 28. > He was interred the next morning on shore; in memorial whereof the north- > west point of the island was named after him. King later mentions the death on 30 September, after they had left Cambridge Gulf. > ...we had only lost one man; and this from a complaint which even medical > assistance might not, perhaps, have cured; and by an accident which could > not have been prevented, for our people were at the moment so busily > employed in working the vessel through a dangerous navigation that the > unfortunate man's situation was not known until the vital spark was nearly > extinct, and too far gone for any human means to save his life. The island is home to endangered flora such as Brachychiton incanus and a variety of birdlife such as rufous night heron, little eagle, brown falcon, whimbrel, tawny frogmouth, great bowerbird and rainbow bee-eater.

Alexandra Park is believed to be the only park in western Europe to be divided by a three-metre wall. The barrier was erected in 1994 and is one of a number of \\"peace walls\\" built across the city in attempt to prevent violence between Nationalist/Republican and Unionist/Loyalist communities.

It is in the historical region of Fouta-Toro in the department and region of Matam. The town is located on Highway N2 some 300 km east of Saint Louis. It is some 5 km south of the border with Mauretania, which generally follows the course of the Senegal River.Google Maps Geography The town of Agnam Civol, the capital of the sub-prefecture and the rural community, is bounded on the north by the Walo fields, a flood zone of the Senegal River. In the south are the fields of Diéri, a cropping area for Millet, Sorghum, and cowpeas. To the east is the town of Agnam Godo and to the west is the village of Agnam Sinthiou Ciré Mato, land of the Almamy. It is about 7 km north-west of the former district capital Thilogne and 70 km north-west from the capital of the department and region, Matam. The population of Agnam Civol lives on agriculture, livestock, handicrafts, trade, and remittances from emigres in other countries. The currency is the CFA franc. The village has a sub-prefecture, a community hall, a kindergarten, and an elementary school but with few resources, a full- service post office, an old and dilapidated drilling site from 1981, a dispensary, and a poorly equipped maternity clinic. There is a social centre for research sources of funds for equipment and a college 3 km away in a neighbouring village. =Climate= There are two seasons: *a dry season (October–June) *a rainy season (June–October) =Relief, Soil, and Vegetation= The relief of the rural community is rugged with three ecological zones running north to south from the Senegal River. ;The Waalo This is the area south of the Senegal River or \\"Dandémayo\\" in Fulani has an area of some 119 square kilometres or 17% of the total rural community. Within the Waalo area there are three types of soil: the Hollalde, Faalo, and Fonde. The Hollalde is characterised by a flat typography and with soil of 60% clay. This is the best area for crops. The Faalo is flat with sandy textured soil along flooded riverbanks. The Fonde has less than 40% clay in the soil and is less productive as it is flooded less frequently. ;The Lower Diery This is the intermediate zone between the Waalo and the Diery with an area of 16 square kilometres running along the Highway N2 with an average width of 2 km. Some of the area has been allocated for residential housing. ;The Diery. This is the largest area in the south of the community with 584 square kilometres or 81% of the total area. Topography is undulating and receives some 400 mm of rain per year. Generally the land is poor and sandy with increasing degradation due to wind and water. =Underground water resources= The most important water is in the Maastrichtian sands. Its depth varies from 50 metres in the north to 250 metres in the south and provides relatively safe water resources. =The Creation of the Town and origin of the name= The town has existed since the 12th century. The name Civol comes from Civoyla, the name of a mountain in Saudi Arabia where the first settlers in the village came from. The Ka, the first settlers' priests, assumed the role of village chief. The population of Civol was at first living at Kadiel-Baytillaye, a hill south of the present village for over 365 years. Then, for more than a century, at Winndé Civoyla, at the bottom of the same hill, before living permanently at Civol's current location. Agnam comes from \\"ar gnam\\" in Fulani which means \\"come and eat\\". The area is known as a regional trading post and is very welcoming. This name of Agnam that precedes a dozen village names in the region was given by foreigners staying there. Founders and heads of village Boucar Yetty and Ndiobbo Yetty descendants of Yetty Koubata from Arabia and, mixed with the Fulani people of Djolof, were the founders of Civol. The oldest man of the founding family, the Ka, was appointed Village Chief. For nearly 300 years, the Village Chief was elected democratically by the people, but always from the Ka. Abdoul Cissé Kâ was the first to bear the title of Village Chief. The name is preceded by the title \\"Thierno Civol\\" (Village Chief Civol). Since then, 28 Village Chiefs followed, including the current Thierno Civol Abdoul Samba Ka. Village Chiefs are appointed for life. In case of resignation or death, the family of Touré, cousins of the Ka, provides an interim Chief until the next election. This title is called \\"Thierno Wothy\\". Administration Agnam Civol was set up as a rural community (communauté rurale) in 1972 by bringing together more than twenty villages. Previously these villages had formed a traditional community under the name Agnam that almost all of these villages share. Thus, as member villages there were Agnam Thiodaye the largest demographically, Agnam Wouro Ciré, Agnam-Goly, Agnam Godo, Agnam Lidoubé, Agnam Civol, Agnam Toulel Thiallé etc. The community has grown thanks to its strategic position located on National Highway N2 and as a hinge between two ecological zones, the Diéri and the Walo. The other villages in the rural community are: The implementation of several facilities, the development of trade and the contribution of migrants have contributed to its development under the demographic plan, both economic and cultural. =Successive Village chiefs= Thierno Civol (title before the name): *Abdoul Cisse ka *Demba Oumou Ka *Falil Ka *Bassirou Ka *Baïdal Ka *Cisse Mama Ka *Malick Dialo Ka *Abdul Baïdal Ka *Mamoudou Thillo Ka *Samba Baïdy Ka *Abdoulaye Kadiata Ka *Demba Doro Ka *Abdul Samba Ka (current) =Successive Interim Village Chiefs= Thierno Wothy (title before the name): *Samba Boubou Touré *Oumar Alpha Touré *Mamadou Billo Touré *Hamath Sambâ Adama Touré *Cissé Samba Boubou Touré *Demba Samba Boubou Touré *Demba Boudel Touré Population The region, comprising 16 villages preceded by the word \\"Agnam\\", is estimated to number more than 26,000 inhabitants, to which must be added the population of the Walo area (the edge of the Senegal River) which has over 5,000 inhabitants. The population is very young (60% under 20 years and 32% between 20 and 54 years). The ethnic Fulani are a very large majority (99.5%). Only a few traders have established in the commercial sectors, mainly in building or clothing. Economy The main economic activities are agriculture, livestock, fishing and small business. During the rainy season, the main crops of millet, sorghum, beans, and watermelon are found in the Diéri area. During the dry season maize, millet, beans, watermelons, sweet potatoes etc. are available at Walo. For 40 years, people's survival depended heavily on remittances from family members who have emigrated abroad or who are in major cities of Senegal. Women as a rule stay in the village to raise the children because their husbands have left in search of work: they also live on small business, market gardening, and food crops. Culture and religion The area has four major mosques located to the west of Oréfondé, in the centre of Civol, at Thilogne, and to the east of Kobilo. The Great Mosque of Civol-Haada is 500 years old. It gave its name to a district of Civol: Haada. It was directed by Elimane Ndiaye Gnawa and was celebrated by the Almamy of Fouta Abdul Kader Kane. Agnam Civol has had a Koranic Arabic school for nearly five centuries. =Imams of the mosque= Elimane (title before the name): *Ndiaye Gnawa *Haby Ka *Moussa Ka *Amadou Baaba Ba *Hassane Ba *Sadou Ka *Oumar Alpha Touré *Mamadou Niandou Ka *Ibrahima Ba who assumes the role during his vacation at Civol *Abu Mamadou Ndiaye Ka *Musa Isma Ka Districts, streets, and squares ;Districts * Touldénaabé * Thiorinkoobé * Diabanaabé * Seck Seckbé * Gallé Samba * Ndiadembé * Tourenbé ;Public squares (digueeré Civol in Fulani) * Selly Touldénaabé * Lowel Sylla * Gidda Gallou Walo * Thioyrinkoobé * Bayla * Ndiaye Bellawol * Haada * Diabanabé * Touldénaabé * Diouma Twinning and partnerships Agnam Civol has been twinned with the town of * Vouziers (France) since 1990.French Atlas of Decentralised Cooperation and other external actions, consulted on 8 May 2013. **The Friendship Association Vouziers Civol, whose president is Elizabeth Durtette has existed since 1986, with construction of the primary school, the maternity clinic, and the community centre. *Partnership with Agnam Sinthiou Ciré Mato **Sinthiou Ciré is a village of 900 inhabitants in the north-east of Civol.

It had a population of 362 people according to the 2002 census. Geography =Population= Agnam Lidoubé has approximately 1,300 people in over a hundred households. The population is characterized by high rates of rural migration, which is also a phenomenon characteristic of all the villages of Fouta. Since the seasonal rainfall can is no longer sufficient to support crops that enable people to sustain themselves throughout the year, young people are obliged to go to the big cities of the country, particularly Dakar, but also other large African megacities and Western countries. Economy The remittances that emigres send enable families to alleviate the hardship caused by drought. The village of Agnam Lidoubé, like all the villages of the middle valley of the Senegal River, drew their subsistence from agriculture of the Waalo (floodplain) and Jeeri (cultivable during the rainy season). Farming and fishing supplemented the family's income but since 1970, which was the beginning of the drought and desertification, the environment has been depleted and lost all its potential to sustain the population. Since the construction of dams on the river in the 1990s, the problem has worsened, especially in the remote villages of the river, such as Agnam Lidoubé, that are not provided with irrigation for crops. For livestock (cattle, sheep, and goats), about 50% of the villagers have two cows, five sheep and five goats per family on average. Ruminants were able to give milk only during the rainy season (3–4 months a year). For lack of such food, milk powder comes from the West, especially France and the Netherlands. It is sold in the village at 2,000 CFA francs (3.05 euros) per kg. Fish is more affordable (yaboy a kind of sardine) than meat and comes every morning in refrigerated trucks from the coastal villages of the country, such as Mbour. The fish is sold at 100 to 150 CFA francs each. The contributions of citizens in the West for this region are significant for the survival of the population. In the case of Agnam Lidoubé, the emigre workers in Europe, consolidate their remittances for their families back in the village, sending on average a total of 5000 euros per month for food for their families and loved ones. In the village, the people without question take care of the families of their sisters, brothers, cousins, and other relatives if they are poor. With these examples we can understand how families who have no income can still live in this area. But it must be observed that the mobilization of women for income-generating activities (gardening, trade etc.) has positively contributed to the ability to survive in this place. History In 2004, several scenes of Lili and the Baobab, a film by Chantal Richard played by Romane Bohringer, were shot at Agnam Lidoubé. Administration Agnam Lidoubé is located in the department of Matam in the Matam region. The village is part of the Agnam Civol rural community. =Village structures= The UFAL (Union of Women of Agnam Lidoubé) and the ADSCAL (Association for the Sociocultural Development of Agnam Lidoubé) are two complementary associations and the principle participants of all social and economic activities of the village. There is an association of young people: Gooto-Rewaa which deals with sports activities and there is an association of students and teachers which provides activities for students during the summer vacation, runs conferences to teach people the benefits of education, hygiene and health.

The population is mainly composed of Fulani Hal Pulaar people and some Wolof people (mostly traders), who come mostly from the religious city of Touba. Toponymy The word Agnam comes from the verb aar niaam which means \\"come and eat\\". 'This is a common prefix for a large number of villages in the region. The word thiodaye comes from the verbal group tiode ndo which means \\"go there\\" or \\"live there.\\" History The first inhabitants of the village lived above the present village, that is to say in Diéri (transldifkadiel mbay toulay}}) and at this time, there were all kinds of witchcraft, and later worship of the dead. They moved to settle in the bottom of the current village, near the Walo (fonde amadou tall) but at that place there were stinging ants which could cause death. That is when a man passing by told them tiode nd ndo (live in the middle), that is to say between the Diéri () and the Walo (fonde amadou tall) and so the word Thiodaye was created. Administration The village is part of the rural community of Agnam Civol in the Matam region. Since 2005 the village has had a college of learning and, since 2008, a school.

It had a population of 2,347 people in 2010 and a population of 1,651 according to the 2002 census. PEPAM, access date 8 June 2013 Administration Aly Oury is part of the rural community of Bokidiawé in the district of Ogo in the heart of Matam department. Demography Aly Oury has over 2,500 inhabitants. These are mostly Haalpulaar'en (over 99%) with a minority of Wolof. The population is young and predominantly female. They are exclusively Muslim. Like most villages in the Fouta, Aly Oury is an area of high emigration with the main destinations being: Dakar region, Casamance natural region, West and Central Africa, Western Europe, and the United States. Geography The closest towns to Aly Oury are Dondou and Diowol Worgo to the north, Nguiguilone and Sadel to the South. Due to its geographical position, Aly Oury a Sahelian climate characterized by: *hot dry continental trade winds or harmattans *low and erratic rainfall with a rainy season from July to September and a dry season from October to June *high temperatures However, the specific hydrological and soil conditions in Aly Oury make it a natural location for irrigated crops. Economy Irrigated agriculture, which accounts for nearly 90% of the labour force, remains by far the major socio-economic activity with rice as a lever for local agricultural development. Since the 1970s the village has operated irrigated areas developed by the SAED. The town benefited during the first phase of the Project for Agricultural Development of Matam (PRODAM) through a development of 200 hectares. However, the high cost of inputs, the lack of storage facilities, transport problems, and the isolation of the area severely limited agricultural production despite the enormous potential available to the town. Inland fishing activity remains firmly rooted in tradition. However, the scarcity of fish and outdated means of production have led to a worrying decline in catches in recent years. This situation has led many fishermen to convert to other income-generating activities. The extensive grazing activities is, considering the austere nature of the environment, the main production system. Supply of animal feed during the period from March to July is, in this semi-desert area, the main constraint to livestock development. Conflicts between farmers and herders are rare and cattle theft almost non- existent. Revenue from the sale of livestock remains, for many families, a substantial source of income. The trade that has developed is diverse and is led by the Wolof minority who settled there. However, a few indigenous people, mostly women, are investing more this niche. Education As with most of the villages of Fouta, Islamic education is securely anchored. There is also a French school which opened in 1961. The first headmaster was Ladji Diarra. Today it has twelve classes with a staff of 14 teachers. In October 2010, the director was Aboubacry Dia. Among those who have been associated with the school are Momar Ndjim Cissé, current president of the National Association of Parents of students in Senegal (FENAPES), Pape Moctar Sow (Division of the Project for Volunteers in Education), Doudou Wade (Member of the National Assembly), and Malick Camara. However, due to some socio-cultural values, despite the efforts made in recent years, the involvement of communities in the management of the school is marginal. Access for girls to school is improving more and more but early marriages are a real obstacle to their continuance. Aly Oury has two elementary schools. In addition, the village has a madrasa - Islamic school education - with very significant numbers of students. Finally, functional literacy is very present with women as the main target. Health The practice of female genital mutilation, the lack of a health staff as well as non-compliance with prenatal visits during pregnancy because of the lack of maternity care for deliveries pose a major risk to the mother and the newborn. This explains the high rate of maternal and child mortality seen in the town. Also malaria, the main reason for consultation, is rampant among pregnant women and children less than five years old. Finally it should be noted the increase in diarrheal diseases due to the inaccessibility of drinking water for the majority of the population. In recent years, EJA could barely finance the health nurse.  Associative activity  The lack of support and advice structures and poor access to microcredit and factors of production are the main constraints on the Group for Advancement of Women (GPF) created in 1981. Despite these numerous constraints, Aly Oury has enormous potential, the most important being undoubtedly the willingness of youth to significantly improve the living conditions of the population. This desire came to fruition in 1978 with the creation of the League of Youth of Aly Oury (EJA) which was officially recognized in 1987. However, the League has not fully met expectations in terms of development, lack of committed partners and consequent lack of financial resources. However, it has participated in many cultural and sporting activities making Aly Oury a reference point in the \\"Daande Maayo\\" area.

Originally created by Fog Creek Software in 2011, it was spun out to form the basis of a separate company in 2014 and later sold to Atlassian in January 2017. The company is based in New York City, U.S.  History  The name Trello is derived from the word \\"trellis\\" which had been a code name for the project at its early stages. Trello was released at a TechCrunch event by Fog Creek founder Joel Spolsky. Wired magazine named the application in September 2011 one of \\"The 7 Coolest Startups You Haven't Heard of Yet\\". Lifehacker said \\"it makes project collaboration simple and kind of enjoyable\\". In 2014, it raised $10.3 million in funding from Index Ventures and Spark Capital. In May 2016, Trello claimed it had more than 1.1 million daily active users and 14 million total signups. On January 9, 2017, Atlassian announced its intent to acquire Trello for $425 million. The transaction was made with $360 million in cash, while the remaining $65 million was made with shares and options. Trello sold 22% of its shares to other investors with the remaining majority held by founders Michael Pryor and Joel Spolsky at the time of acquisition. In December 2018, Trello announced its acquisition of Butler, the company that developed a Power-Up for automating tasks within a Trello board. As of March 2019, Trello was adopted by over 35 million users. Shortly after, in October 2019, Trello announced 50 million users.  Uses  Users can create their task boards with different columns and move the tasks between them. Typically columns include task statuses such as To Do, In Progress, Done. The tool can be used for personal and business purposes including real estate management, software project management, school bulletin boards, lesson planning, accounting, web design, gaming, and law office case management.

He was the owner of Brookwood Cemetery, the largest cemetery in the United Kingdom, with the aim of establishing a Turkish cemetery. Güney was also the founder and chairman of the UK Turkish Islamic Trust and had established the first Turkish mosque in London, Shacklewell Lane Mosque, in 1977. He was also a founding member of the VOLKAN organisation in Cyprus, established in the 1950s as part of the struggle against the Greek Cypriot nationalists, EOKA. He was in later years a Member of Parliament and presidential candidate in Northern Cyprus. Life Güney's mausoleum in Brookwood Cemetery Güney was born in Paphos, Cyprus in 1932 to Turkish Cypriot parents. After leaving school, he served in the British army and police on the island. However, in 1955, with the rise of EOKA Greek Cypriots fought a violent campaign for the end of British rule as well as for union with Greece (enosis); Güney fought against this by becoming a founding member of the Volkan organisation. In 1958 he emigrated to Britain where he set up a music publishing business and became a millionaire at the age of 35. In 1977 he helped found and run the first Turkish Cypriot mosque in London, called the Shacklewell Lane Mosque, and worked on a variety of social and community projects, arising from his work with the UK Turkish Islamic Centre. He acquired Brookwood Cemetery in 1985, the purchase evolving from Güney's role as Chairman of the UK Turkish Islamic Trust, which wanted suitable burial facilities for its members. He died at the age of 74 in Northern Cyprus. Following a service at his mosque in London, he was buried in his family vault at Brookwood Cemetery on Friday 10 November 2006.

Set in 1901, and starring Michael York, Simon MacCorkindale and Jenny Agutter, it concerns the efforts of two British yachtsmen to avert a plot by the German Empire to launch a military seaborne invasion of the United Kingdom. Plot In the Autumn of 1901, Carruthers, an aristocratic junior official in the British Foreign Office, is invited on a yachting and duck-shooting holiday by an old University acquaintance called Arthur Davies. On Carruthers' arrival on Germany's northern coast to join the yacht Dulcibella, Davies explains to him that he has a hidden agenda for the trip and the invitation beyond duck- hunting. While boating around the Frisian Islands ostensibly correcting antiquated British sea charts of the coastline's shifting topography, by chance he had met a retired German sailor called Dollmann on the yacht Medusa with his wife and daughter, Clara, with whom Davies has initiated a romantic attachment. He narrates further that whilst sailing together along the coast in a gale Dollmann had, when Davies had tried to put into a particular estuary for shelter, inexplicably prevented him from entering by executing a deliberately hazardous sea-manoeuvre, to the degree that both their lives had been endangered by it. Davies then reveals to Carruthers that his real interest in the area is that he suspects that the Imperial German Navy is engaged in covert military activity of some nature in the Frisian Islands, with the intention of threatening the security of the North Sea from the British perspective, which the Royal Navy is strategically misdirected to meet, and he is engaged in trying to discover what it is. This the pretext of the \\"holiday\\" that he has invited Carruthers upon, given Carruthers' ability to speak German along with his professional contacts within Whitehall, if they should discover something warranting the alarm being raised within the halls of the British Government. Carruthers and Davies go on, amidst cryptic warnings-off from circling German naval officers, sailing expeditions among the Frisian isles and inlets, and fights, to carry out covert surveillance at the estuary in question, to discover that the German Empire is using a naval base hidden in the islands to carry out rehearsals for a seaborne passage across the North Sea of a German army with the aim of militarily invading Britain, and that Herr \\"Dollmann\\" is in fact Lieutenant Thomas, an embittered former Royal Navy officer who is treasonously assisting their preparations with his detailed knowledge of the British coast and key naval defences. After sabotaging one of the rehearsals, whilst escaping to the Netherlands by sea in 2 roped yachts with the information about it, along with a badly wounded Dollmann and his family as prisoners, Davies abandons Dollmann with his wife in the Dulcibella to allow him to return to Germany to seek medical assistance for his wounds at the insistence of Clara, who agrees to accompany Davies and Carruthers back to Britain in the Medusa with his papers revealing the German plans in detail. Dollmann and his wife are murdered by the pursuing German authorities – led by Kaiser Wilhelm II, in person – when the Dulcibella is rammed and destroyed. The film ends with the yacht bearing Carruthers, Davies and Clara bound for the Netherlands, with a Carruthers' voiced narration detailing how their return to Britain with the information would lead to a shift in the United Kingdom's sea defence strategy towards Germany, that would avert the threat of war by tactical deterrent. Cast * Michael York as Charles Carruthers * Simon MacCorkindale as Arthur Davies * Jenny Agutter as Clara Dollmann * Alan Badel as Dollmann * Michael Sheard as Böehme * Hans Meyer as Grimm * Wolf Kahler as Kaiser Wilhelm II * Olga Lowe as Frau Dollmann * Jurgen Andersen as Von Brüning * Ronald Markham as Withers Production =Development and scripting= Several producers and directors had tried to make a film based on the novel but the Childers family had not wanted to sell the rights. This ceased to be a problem when the novel passed into the public domain. Tony Maylam and Drummond Challis, son of photographer Christopher Challis, formed a production company to make the film and succeeded in raising the finance from the Rank Organisation, who had recently decided to get back into film production. Additional finance was provided by the National Film Finance Corporation. It was the feature film debut for both Challis and Maylam. The script was basically faithful to the novel although some details and the ending were changed. Maylam thought the novel \\"had a rather more anti- climactic ending, and we felt a more up-beat ending was essential for a feature film. But we feel it is still very much in the Childers style.\\" Among the changes were the inclusion of the Kaiser (although his presence at the trial towing of the lighter is hinted at in the book) and the fate of the character of Dollman (in the original novel he drowned himself; in the film he is mortally wounded after being shot, then killed when the Germans ram his yacht.) Maylam: > The failing of the book is that Dollman falls apart as a character in the > last chapter. In one breath he is a total opportunist who would do anything > for his grand plan. The next moment he is a defeated man. I believe he was > an opportunist to the bitter end. Oh, the purists will have a go at me, > definitely, but in all other respects we have strived to remain faithful to > the book. Without bastardising the story, we are making the characters more > defined and the ending is now much more believable and exciting. =Filming= Filming was done in the Netherlands, West Germany and at Bushey Studios, Hertfordshire, England. Many scenes were shot on the Frisian Islands on the North Sea coast of Germany and the Netherlands, the same locale as in the book. The unit was partly based in the town of Enkhuizen in the Netherlands; although that town had no relevance to the novel, its harbour provided easy access to the Zuider Zee where the unit could shoot sailing sequences all day unhampered by tidal delays. Many of the crew lived on board a cruiser during the shoot because it was cheaper than staying in local accommodation, of which there was a shortage. The train scenes are filmed between Twisk and Medemblik (Bensersiel and Emden in the film respectively) on the track and in the carriages of the Hoorn–Medemblik heritage railway. Several scenes were also shot in the German village of Greetsiel. The sequence of Carruthers and Davies navigating their way between sandbanks in the Frisian Islands was shot on Frensham Ponds in Surrey with the aid of nine large fog machines; this was done because the tidal flows and sands of the Frisian Islands would have made actually filming there very difficult. While filming on the Johanna Lucretia, playing the Medusa, cinematographer Christopher Challis and camera operator John Palmer would hold the camera in place with slings of rope and elastic, soaking up the ship's motion and allowing the operator free rein. This technique was developed by Challis and Palmer when they made The Deep (1977). Davies' boat, the Dulcibella, was converted from an Isle of Wight lifeboat. The film was Tony Maylam's feature film debut. He said during filming: > So much rests on this picture. It's very important to prove myself. I owe a > big debt to people like Alan Parker and Ridley Scott, who proved to the film > establishment that a young film director can get it all together and > deliver. If this is a commercial and artistic success it can only help my > generation of filmmakers. My motto is compromise under pressure. One hopes > one doesn't have to compromise too much. But let's face it, the whole of > life's a compromise. During filming, Michael York took an option for the film rights on a biography on Erskine Childers, The Zeal of the Convert by Burke Wilkinson. This film was never made. Reception =Box office= The film was not the hoped for success at the box office and was one of the last films financed by the Rank Organisation. It was not released in the US until 1984. =Critical= The critic from the Observer called the film \\"an affectionate, commendably straight adaptation... the excitement somewhat abates in the perfunctorily handled scenes ashore... the cinematographer Christopher Challis uses the Panavision screen to fine dramatic effect.\\" The Guardian also praised the cinematography but complained \\"the set pieces are none too convincing and the whole regrettably lacks the eye for detail that could have made it into an entirely convincing period piece.\\" The New York Times called the film a \\"slow but affable period piece\\" while the Los Angeles Times said it \\"has the quaint, old fashioned sound of a Hardy Boys mystery about it\\" which \\"plays like a slightly more lethal boys' adventure story.\\" See also *Das Rätsel der Sandbank (1985 West German TV miniseries) References External links  New York Times review: The Riddle of the Sands (1979) * *The Riddle of the Sands soundtrack at Howardblake.com Category:1979 films Category:British films Category:British spy thriller films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on Irish novels Category:1970s spy thriller films Category:Films directed by Tony Maylam Category:Films scored by Howard Blake Category:Films set in 1901 Category:Films set in Germany Category:Sailing films Category:Cultural depictions of Wilhelm II ","title":"The Riddle of the Sands (film)"},{"id":"33104740","text":"Boulome is a settlement in Ziguinchor Department in Ziguinchor Region in the Basse Casamance area of south-west Senegal.

Life Smith was born at Daventry, Northamptonshire, about 1652. He was articled to a painter named Tillet in London, and studied mezzotint engraving under Isaac Beckett and Jan van der Vaart. Smith became the favourite engraver of Sir Godfrey Kneller, whose paintings he extensively reproduced, and in whose house he is said to have lived for some time. At the end of his career, Smith retired to Northamptonshire, where he died on 17 January 1742 at age 90. He was buried in the churchyard of St Peter's, Northampton church, where there was a tablet to his memory and that of his wife Sarah, who died in 1717. Works Smith created approximately 500 plates; nearly 300 of these plates were portraits of notable men and women of the period between the reigns of Charles II and George II. Smith used pictures from artists such as Peter Lely, Godfrey Kneller, Willem Wissing, Michael Dahl, John Riley, John Closterman, Edward Gibson, and Thomas Murray. The rest of Smith's plates have sacred, mythological, and genre subjects after Titian, Correggio, Parmigianino, Carlo Maratti, Godfried Schalcken, Egbert van Heemskerck, Marcellus Laroon and others. Most of Smith's early plates had been published by the print seller Edward Cooper. In 1700, Smith became a printseller at the Lyon and Crown in Covent Garden and started publishing his own works. Smith also reissued many plates by Beckett, Bernard Lens, Williams, and others, retouching them and erasing the original engravers' names. Smith's latest print appears to have been the portrait of the young Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, after Joseph Highmore, dated 1729. Loves of the Gods, after Titian The bulk of Smith's copperplates eventually came into the hands of publisher John Boydell, who reprinted them in large numbers. In 1696, Kneller painted a portrait of Smith holding a Kneller engraving and gave it to him. In 1716, Smith created a print from that portrait. Samuel Freeman later engraved that image for Horace Walpole's Anecdotes. Kneller's portrait of Smith is part of the collection of the Tate Gallery, London.See picture at the Tate.

Biography Schunk und Ebe oHG was founded in 1913 as a factory for production of carbon brushes for dynamos and electric motors in Fulda in Hesse and moved in 1918 to Heuchelheim near Giessen. By now the company has developed into being the Schunk Group, a technology concern with worldwide operations. Ludwig Schunk's forebears had been settled in the Central Hesse region since the middle of the 18th century and for several generations had been nail makers in Büdingen. His grandfather had still exercised that craft. Ludwig Schunk's father, as the youngest of three children, saw practically no possibility of ever being able to take over his father's workshop and moved to Frankfurt where, among other things, he worked in a graphic art firm. Ludwig Schunk grew up as the younger of two children in what were modest circumstances. Nonetheless, his family made it possible for him to attend an eight-year secondary school which he successfully completed. From 1898 to 1901 Ludwig Schunk was an apprentice in an import firm in the leather machinery trade with offices in Frankfurt and in Boston, USA. There, the young man very early on became aware of the important significance of worldwide business operations for the success of an enterprise. Subsequent to his training, Schunk was up through April 1, 1903 employed by the firm where he had been an apprentice. Schunk gathered further professional experience as an office clerk in the purchasing department of an aniline and aniline dye factory in Offenbach. His modest family circumstances had very early on led Schunk to the conviction that only above-average hard work and constant pursuit of education could make the prerequisites for social advancement possible. Following this motto, he in 1905 decided to go to France in order to develop his language skills and his \\"world skills.\\" Schunk was in command of the two world languages, English and French, and was able to find employment as manager of foreign correspondence in an important company in the electric industry in Paris. There followed a six-year stay in Paris where Ludwig Schunk became familiar with the manufacture of carbon brushes for electrical machinery. The bright prospects for the future of that field which he had already recognized prompted him, shortly after his return to Germany, to strike off on his own. In 1913, 29 years old, he and the mechanic and machine fitter Karl Ebe, who had also gathered experience in the carbon industry, founded the carbon brush factory of Schunk & Ebe oHG in Fulda. Karl Ebe died only a year after the company started up. In 1918 Ludwig Schunk moved the company, operated in rented premises, from Fulda to Heuchelheim near Giessen where he was able to buy the former tourist restaurant \\"Windhof\\" which had sufficient space to set up production equipment. As far back as in those early days, the first representation offices were founded in various large German cities and export business was set up. In the next few years, this new company acquired a sound reputation with customers and competitors. Like his successors after him, the company founder Ludwig Schunk endeavored to expand and shore up his company through diversification into related fields of technology. To that end, he in 1923 acquired a carbon brush holder factory and integrated it into his operations in Heuchelheim. In 1932 the production of sintered bearings was started. The carbon orientation had already previously been expanded with products for mechanical applications. The increasingly difficult economic environment could not prevent Ludwig Schunk's life work from advancing. As the Reichsmark lost ever more of its value and the concomitant heavy inflation increased as well, Schunk successfully sought new sales markets abroad from which stable currency flowed in. By boosting his export business he succeeded in avoiding losses of real assets for his company. In accordance with his social orientation, Ludwig Schunk, as far back as in 1940, took the initiative to found a providential fund whose charter-based objectives were to provide voluntary one-time or ongoing support to employees, former employees or their relatives in case of neediness, disability or old age. The providential fund could grant retirement pensions, widow's or orphan's pensions or death grants. Ludwig Schunk did not have any children. His wife, who had collaborated very energetically in building up the company, had died early. The heirs of his deceased partner had been compensated so that he was sole owner of the corporate assets. As early as 1938 he decided in his will that those assets would be made available to the employees. He clarified this in a supplemental testament in 1942 and made the providential fund he had founded his sole heir. According to his own words, the example he was following was that of the Zeiss Foundation in Jena. Between 1936 and 1945 Ludwig Schunk held various public offices. Among other things, Schunk after December 1936 directed the \\"Coal and Brushes Specialist Team,\\" one of 24 sections of the electrical industry business group. After 1945, Schunk was banned from his company grounds by the American military authorities and the company was put under the control of trustees. However, in the proceedings subsequently instigated Schunk was rehabilitated. All of Ludwig Schunk's strivings had been focused on advancing and developing his life's work, the company of Schunk & Ebe that he had created together with his partner Karl Ebe from extremely modest beginnings with his employees and for the welfare of the latter. In 1947, after having had health problems ever since his youth, Ludwig Schunk died at the age of 63 from heart failure. As he had arranged, the providential fund became upon his death heir to the assets of the firm of Schunk & Ebe. After the death of Ludwig Schunk, the firm of Schunk & Ebe GmbH was founded, whose capital shares were now held by the providential fund according to the intention of the testator. Now, as holder of the capital, it was named the “Ludwig-Schunk- Gedächnisverein” (registered association) and has since 1989 been known as the Ludwig-Schunk Stiftung.

The protective rings, in addition to the protective function of the fingers, can also serve to trap an opponent's blade. These swords were painted black to not reflect light and announce their presence on ships, and to resist rusting caused by salt water. It was also known by Portuguese soldiers as colhona (which in rude Portuguese means approximately “big balls”) due to the round shape of the terminal plates, reminiscent of a representation of the testicles in a phallic symbol in the form of sword.

In 2014, he was inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame.  Early career  In 1978, at age 21, Marotta began his career in football when he was appointed as Director of Youth Department for his hometown club Varese. Just one year later, Marotta was promoted to general manager (GM) () of Varese and in his first season in charge saw his team promoted back to Serie B. With Marotta as GM, Varese would spend five consecutive seasons in Serie B. However, Marotta's final two seasons at Varese saw the club twice relegated, falling down to Serie C2 after the 1985–86 season. After leaving Varese, Marotta was appointed GM of Serie C1 club Monza. During his tenure at Monza, the club were promoted to Serie B and spent two seasons at that level, before relegation back down to Serie C1. After four seasons at Monza, Marotta moved on to serve as director general for Como in Serie C1 for three seasons, and then at Ravenna for two seasons, also in Serie C1. In 1995, Marotta was hired by Maurizio Zamparini to serve as GM for Venezia, then playing in Serie B. While there, Venezia achieved a historic promotion back to Serie A in 1998, marking the club's first return to the top flight in more than 30 years. After five seasons at the club, Marotta left Venezia at the end of the 1999–2000 season, after Venezia was again relegated to Serie B. From Venezia, Marotta became GM for Serie A club Atalanta, where he served for two seasons. During his time at Atalanta, the club finished seventh and ninth in the Serie A table.  Sampdoria  Following the 2001–02 season, Marotta changed clubs again, this time moving to Sampdoria. At the time of Marotta's hiring, the club was coming off its lowest table finish since the founding of the club in 1946, a tenth place finish in the club's third-straight season in Serie B. However, the club had also recently been purchased by local Genoese oil industrialist Riccardo Garrone, which, in turn, added an influx of wealth to the struggling club. In Marotta's first season as GM, he hired head coach Walter Novellino, the same coach who in 1998 had guided Venezia back to Serie A under Marotta. Together, and with new money at their disposal, Marotta and Novellino revamped the Sampdoria squad in the 2002 transfer window, adding both experienced Serie A veterans, such as Massimo Paganin, Sergio Volpi, Fabio Bazzani, and Stefano Bettarini, along with several promising young players, such as Angelo Palombo, Maurizio Domizzi and Andrea Gasbarroni. This overhaul proved successful as Novellino guided Sampdoria to a second-place finish in the 2002–03 season, earning the club promotion back to Serie A, as well as a quarter-final finish in the Coppa Italia. In 2003–04, he added to two big-name acquisitions in Cristiano Doni and Francesco Antonioli as Sampdoria finished in eighth place, just missing out on UEFA Cup qualification. In 2004, Marotta was appointed to serve as chief executive officer (CEO) () of Sampdoria, in addition to his role of GM. Shortly after, Marotta hired ex-player Fabio Paratici to serve as chief observer/head of scouting for Sampdoria. Paratici worked very closely under the guidance of Marotta, often being described as his \\"right-hand man\\". The 2004–05 season saw Sampdoria finish in sixth place, missing the UEFA Champions League qualification by just one point. Nevertheless, Sampdoria qualified for the UEFA Cup, marking the first time one of Marotta's teams had qualified for European competition. The 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons saw the club finish 12th and 9th respectively. Following the disappointing 2006–07 season, Marotta replaced manager Walter Novellino with Walter Mazzarri. The 2007 transfer season also saw Marotta bring in the controversial Italian forward Antonio Cassano on a year-long loan from Real Madrid with the option to purchase the player. The 2007–08 season saw the club finish in sixth place to qualify again for the UEFA Cup. After signing Cassano in full, Marotta added another highly regarded striker to Sampdoria with the purchase of Giampaolo Pazzini from Fiorentina for a fee of €9 million in January 2009.U.C. Sampdoria 2009 bilancio (in Italian) However, Sampdoria struggled in the 2008–09 season, finishing in 13th place in Serie A, leading Marotta to not renew the expiring contract of head coach Walter Mazzarri. After dismissing Mazzarri, Marotta hired head coach Luigi Delneri, himself coming off two successful seasons at Atalanta, for the 2009–10 season. Marotta also brought in several key players during the season's two transfer windows, including Daniele Mannini, Fernando Tissone, Nicola Pozzi and Marco Storari. Behind 28 Serie A goals from the strike partnership of Antonio Cassano and Giampaolo Pazzini, and under Delniri's management, Sampdoria finished the 2009–10 season in fourth place, qualifying for the 2010–11 Champions League. In May 2010, it was heavily rumored Juventus was interested in hiring Marotta, and Sampdoria's owner/president Riccardo Garrone openly stated he would gladly let Marotta leave for the more prestigious club.  Juventus  In May 2010, Marotta was officially brought to Juventus by newly elected club chairman Andrea Agnelli (Agnelli role effective in October, but he start to co-opted with the board since 19 May) as GM for the Sports Area (), replacing Jean-Claude Blanc (who retained the role of chairman and CEO until October 2010). Marotta signed a three-year contract with the club, tying him there until June 2013. Juventus had just finished the season in seventh place, their worst since returning to Serie A after the Calciopoli scandal. In his move from Sampdoria to Juventus, Marotta also brought along head of scouting Fabio Paratici and head coach Luigi Delneri. On 27 October 2010, Marotta was appointed a member of Juventus' Board of Directors and named the club's CEO, replacing Jean-Claude Blanc. However, Aldo Mazzia was appointed chief financial officer (CFO) and CEO of the club in April and in May 2011 respectively. Similar to his first transfer market upon taking over at Sampdoria, Marotta spent the first year in charge of transfer operations at Juventus making wholesale changes to the squad, acquiring 14 new players, including Miloš Krasić, Fabio Quagliarella, Alessandro Matri and Alberto Aquilani;) while offloading 11 players, including selling club legend David Trezeguet and Brazilian playmaker Diego, moves which were unpopular with fans. Juventus finished the 2010–11 season in seventh place, missing out again on Champions League football and also having failed to advance past the group stages of the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League. Following the disappointing season, Marotta and the club announced manager Luigi Delneri would not be returning for another season. On 31 May 2011, Marotta announced the appointment of former Juventus player and captain Antonio Conte as head coach. Conte's appointment was met with some skepticism due to his inexperience in top-flight football. Marotta stated in an interview with the Corriere dello Sport that the club's objectives for the new season were to win the Scudetto or at least qualify for the Champions League. During the 2011–12 summer transfer window, Marotta set about to improve last years finish by bringing in eight new players to the squad, including Andrea Pirlo and Michele Pazienza on free transfers, and new signings Stephan Lichtsteiner, Arturo Vidal, Mirko Vučinić, Emanuele Giaccherini, Marcelo Estigarribia and Eljero Elia. In May 2012, Juventus won their first Scudetto in six years. Since Juventus' surprise run to the 2015 Champions League final, Marotta and the club administration have been praised for assembling one of Europe's top midfields at a minimal cost, with first choice midfielders Paul Pogba (free), Arturo Vidal (€10.5 million), Andrea Pirlo (free) and Claudio Marchisio (youth product/free), as well as several back-up midfielders on loan, all costing a cumulative total less than €15 million and contributing over one-third of the goals scored in all competitions that season. On 31 October 2018, Marotta officially terminated his contract as Juventus CEO. Internazionale On 13 December 2018, Marotta officially joined Inter as CEO for sport.

Chicago Black Socks trial in 1920. The cameraman, Harry Birch, was Fox News' first Chicago staff cameraman. Fox News was the original newsreel established by movie mogul, William Fox. It was eventually replaced by Fox's pioneering sound newsreel, Fox Movietone News, which began regular operations in December 1927. William Fox had great ambitions for his newsreel from the very beginning; he even managed to secure a letter from President Woodrow Wilson endorsing his newsreel. At its launch in 1919, Fox had already secured a network of cameramen spanning the globe. Although the newsreel began acquiring stories in August 1919, the newsreel did not begin a regular, twice- weekly release until October 1919. From the beginnings of its operations Fox News' main domestic rivals were Hearst News, Pathé News, International News and Kinograms. When Fox Films ceased production of Fox News, the extensive library of unused and outtake film was folded into the Fox Movietone News library and was used internally as stock footage by Fox Films and 20th Century Fox until the corporation ceased production of Fox Movietone News in 1963. As part of its gift of newsreel material to the University of South Carolina announced in 1979, 20th Century Fox donated all remaining elements from the original Fox News library. Estimated at 3 million feet of film, the original, camera negative nitrate film from this newsreel is arguably the most significant film record of American life, politics, and culture in the 1920s. Fox News developed a comprehensive library system to keep track of the negative films being sent to New York from all over the world. Library story numbers were assigned to each roll of film and these numbers are still used today by the University of South Carolina to identify the films. On each \\"dope sheet\\" (i.e., the notes taken by newsreel cameramen in the field) was stamped a unique library number and this number was then written onto the tail of the film negative. Fox News story numbers run in series: 0001-9999, A0001-A9999, B0001-B9999, C0001-C9999 and D0001-D4444. The last films registered into the Fox News library date from April 1930. The original library records from Fox News for those films donated to the University of South Carolina have been converted into an online database available for research. A comprehensive listing of companies and cameramen that submitted film to Fox News is available online. This listing provides names and locations of over 700 individuals and 170 businesses or organizations.

The scar has come to be seen as one of the most graphic demonstrations of the impact of the Chernobyl disaster. The term takes its name from the increased rate of thyroid cancer after the Chernobyl disaster. The scar has also been referred as the Belarus necklace or the Belarusian Necklace, in reference to the large number of thyroid cancer occurrences in the nation caused by the nuclear fallout from neighboring Ukraine. The use of the word necklace indicates its visual resemblance to the horizontal scar around the neck, but also contrasts the negative connotations of the scar with the beauty of an actual necklace.  Cause  Iodine is required by higher animals to synthesize thyroid hormones, which contain the element. Because of this function, radioisotopes of iodine are concentrated in the thyroid gland along with nonradioactive iodine. In the case of a nuclear accident, the radioactive iodine-131 (131I), which has a high fission product yield, is released into the environment. 131I concentrates in the thyroid, and may cause cancer. Treatment of thyroid cancer may require surgery. The surgery may leave the patient with one or two horizontal scars at the base of the neck, dubbed the Chernobyl necklace.  Occurrences  After the Chernobyl disaster, incidents of thyroid cancer among civilians in Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, and Poland have risen sharply. It is estimated that many of those affected have the necklace, however, no statistical information of the affected population exists at this time. See the article on Chernobyl disaster effects for details. After the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, there has been some speculation that Japan faces a similar situation: its affected population may receive similar surgery and scarring (\\"wear the Chernobyl necklace\\") in the future.

After the WellCare and Peach State Medicaid networks followed through with plans to terminate Kool Smiles from their contracts, patients of Kool Smiles and another company filed an injunction that would prevent the terminations until WellCare and the Peach State organizations would show that the ending of the contracts would not contradict Medicaid dental program requirements. Kool Smiles' Chief Dental Officer, Dr. David Strange, argued that if it lost the contract, some families in Columbus, Georgia, would be unable to receive dental care. Kool Smiles remained part of the Amerigroup Medicaid network and later resumed participation in the WellCare and Peach State Medicaid networks. Kool Smiles currently participates in all of the Medicaid networks in Georgia. In 2010 Kool Smiles generated $80 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).

Slate ran a feature about dental care in Alabama during 2015, explaining that the work by companies such as Kool Smiles was assisting with assisting some of the poorest children in the country with their dental care. Around the same time, a number of studies were carried out regarding the adoption of Dental Service Organizations for many states. As one of the leading providers of DSOs in the United States, Kool Smiles' statistics were regularly quoted during this period. The result of regular care through DSOs meant that Kool Smiles' patients had an overall average monthly Medicaid expenditure that was 33% lower than non-Kool Smiles patients and that Kool Smiles providers perform 15 percent fewer procedures per patient. In January 2018, Kool Smiles agreed to pay $23.9 million to settle Medicaid fraud charges. The federal government alleged that the company filed false claims for unneeded dental procedures performed on children, including tooth removals, pulpotomies, and installing stainless steel crowns. The company was also accused of billing for services it did not actually render.

Natkho died in a car accident at the age of 22. Her cousin is the prominent Circassian-Israeli footballer Bibras Natkho. Biography Natkho was born the Circassian village of Kfar Kama in northern Israel, to a Circassian-Muslim family. During her childhood Natkho played in a junior Futsal team in the village of Kfar Tavor where she was identified as having great potential. As a result, she was referred to a training camp at the Wingate Institute. Natkho's family, whom acknowledged her great potential, took a decision to support their daughter as much as they can. As a result, when Natkho reached 14 her family moved with her to Even Yehuda so that she would be able to practice and play in the Even Yehuda women's high school basketball team. In her first season in the team, Natkho led the team to its first title in the history of the team - the State Cup. Following her success in the Even Yehuda team in the following year she joined the team of the Ostrovsky High School in Ra'anana, where she studied and played for three years. During her last season in high school, in 2000, her team won the national high school basketball championship. During that season Natkho began playing in the Premier League team Maccabi Raanana. Her breakthrough season came a year later, in which she was selected as the discovery of the season. During her first two seasons in Maccabi Raanana, the team won the State Cup. During her third season in Maccabi Raanana (the 2001/02 season) Natkho scored an average of 13.7 points per game, making her Israel's best Shooting guard of that season. In 2003, after four seasons in Maccabi Raanana Natkho was transferred, along with her coach Tal Nathan, to the Elitzur Ramla basketball team. During her first season with the team, the team won the national cup. In 2002 Natkho was invited for the first time to the adult basketball teams, and later on she took part in the European Women Basketball Championship held in Greece during 2003. Two months prior to Natkho's death, after many years of living outside of the village of Kfar Kama, the family returned to reside in the village. Natkho only got to play in two games during her second season with the Elitzur Ramla basketball team before she died. = Death = In the evening of November 5, 2004 Natkho was driving her Ford Focus vehicle along with four other people. While driving on Highway 767, in near proximity to her parents' house in the village of Kfar Kama, for an unknown reason her vehicle lost control, swerved into the opposite lane and collided with a Jeep. Both Nili Natkho (aged 22) and her sister Diana (aged 19) were killed instantly, while their cousin Raja Tlash (aged 24) died short after of her injury while being operated in the hospital.

After serving in the Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Air Force during World War I, Scott went on to command the airship R34 on its return Atlantic crossing in 1919, which marked the first transatlantic flight by an airship and the first east–west transatlantic flight by an aircraft of any kind. Subsequently, he worked at the Royal Airship Works in connection with the Imperial Airship Scheme and took part in a second return Atlantic crossing, this time by the R100, in 1930. He was killed later in the year (along with 47 other people) aboard the R100's near-sister, the R101, when it crashed in northern France during a flight to India. In addition to his achievements as an aviator, Scott made significant contributions to airship engineering, notably in the evolution of the mooring mast.  Background and early life  Scott was born in Lewisham, London, on 25 May 1888, the eldest son of civil engineer George Hall Scott and his wife, Margaret Wilkinson. He attended Alton School in Plymouth; Richmond School, Yorkshire; and the Royal Naval Engineering College, then located at Keyham, Plymouth. From 1908 onwards, Scott was \\"engaged in general engineering\\"; immediately before World War I, he worked on the construction of naval vessels at the Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval in Ferrol, Spain.  Military service  Scott joined the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) in 1914 as a Flight Sub-Lieutenant and trained at Farnborough in Hampshire and RNAS Kingsnorth in Kent. Between May 1915 and October 1916, he was based at Barrow- in-Furness. His first command was No. 4, a non-rigid airship built in 1913 to the designs of August von Parseval and based in Barrow by 1915.Masefield, p. 61. In the first of a number of landing accidents involving Scott, he was in command of No. 4 when (with Barnes Wallis aboard) it struck its shed at Barrow in foggy conditions in November 1915.Masefield, p. 62. (In fairness to Scott, one source attributes the collision to his efforts to avoid an \\"enormous bonfire\\" that had been lit in a misguided attempt to \\"assist [the crew] in finding their bearings\\".)Swinfield, p. 131. Subsequently, Scott took command of the Anglesey station, before returning to Barrow in March 1917. In April 1917, he was posted to RNAS Howden, Yorkshire, as captain of HM Airship No. 9r, the first British rigid airship to fly. He went on to command the same ship at Cranwell, Lincolnshire, and Pulham, Norfolk. On the formation of the RAF in April 1918, he was gazetted to the rank of Major.  R34's transatlantic flight  R34 lands at Mineola, 6 July 1919 Scott took charge of the new rigid R34, built by William Beardmore and Company at Inchinnan, Renfrewshire, Scotland, on its completion in 1919 and was ordered to \\"prepare for a voyage to the United States of America\\". Damage to the airship during a trial flight forced a delay in departure, meaning that Alcock and Brown beat the R34 to the distinction of making the first non-stop transatlantic flight. The R34 eventually set out from its base at East Fortune, Scotland, in the early hours of 2 July 1919. Despite \\"dodging storms and fogs\\" and running low on both fuel and hydrogen, it landed at Mineola, New York, on 6 July, after 108 hours and 12 minutes of flying time. The return trip began late on 10 July and ended at Pulham on 13 July, having taken 75 hours and 3 minutes. Scott received the CBE in honour of his role in the flight.  Royal Airship Works  Scott retired from the RAF in October 1919, subsequently joining the technical staff of the Royal Airship Works at Cardington, Bedfordshire, in 1920. Although British airship development \\"initially began to languish\\" in peacetime, Scott was a member of the \\"nucleus staff\\" retained until development was resumed under the auspices of the Imperial Airship Scheme from 1924. During this period, Scott took part in the trials of the new passenger airship R36. On a 5 April 1921 demonstration flight, the R36 suffered a failure of the top rudder and starboard elevator during a turning test, which \\"caused the ship to fall rapidly for about [and attain] a severe nose down angle\\". However, thanks to Scott's decision to conduct the tests at altitude, he was able to \\"trim [the R36] and...bring her safely to earth\\" by moving crew members about within the hull. Scott was also involved in the R36's high- profile 14 June 1921 flight over the Ascot Races, with journalists and Metropolitan Police representatives aboard, to assess the airship's potential role in road-traffic control. However, just a week after the Ascot flight, the R36's career was ended by severe damage to its bows resulting from a landing accident at Pulham. After taking over command from the ship's captain, Flight Lieutenant Herbert Irwin (later captain of the R101), Scott conducted an excessively rapid approach to the mast. During the same period, Scott also served as a member of the Air Ministry committee that investigated the loss in 1921 of the R38. = The Imperial Airship Scheme = Proposals for an airship network connecting Britain with its colonies and dominions worldwide emerged in the years following the R34's transatlantic flight, although political and economic difficulties slowed their progress. The Imperial Airship Scheme, providing for the construction of two competing prototype passenger airships (R100, built by the Vickers-controlled Airship Guarantee Company at Howden, and R101, built by the state-owned Royal Airship Works at Cardington), was instigated in 1924. In the same year, Scott assumed the position of Officer in Charge of Flying and Training in the Air Ministry's Airship Directorate. (His title became Assistant Director of Airship Development (Flying) in January 1930.) The R34's sister ship, R33, was employed on test flights to provide data for the design of the new ships; it was commanded by Flight Lieutenant Irwin, former captain of the R36 and later to command the R101. On the night of 16–17 April 1925, the R33 broke from the Pulham mast during a gale and was blown stern-first to the Netherlands before those aboard—led by the first officer, Flight Lieutenant Ralph Booth, who would later command the R100—could regain control. Following the incident, Booth praised the \\"valuable guidance\\" that Scott had provided via radio. Scott was involved more directly in a second incident with the R33, this time on its final flight in November 1925, when the ship hit the shed doors at Pulham while under his control.  Scott's position aboard the R100 and R101  The R100 and R101 were finally launched in late 1929. Scott did not himself command either airship (the R100 being commanded by Ralph Booth, who had by now been promoted to Wing Commander, and the R101 by Flight Lieutenant Irwin) but took an active part in both ships' test flights. At a meeting of an Air Ministry committee held on 27 July 1930, shortly before the R100 left for Canada, the issues of Scott's \\"lack of recent experience of airship handling\\" and the difficulties potentially arising if there was \\"any division of responsibility\\" between Scott and the ship's captain were discussed. The Air Member for Supply and Research, Sir John Higgins, ruled that captains should have \\"full responsibility\\" and that Scott would give no orders to any crew member apart from the captain; moreover, the captain was not bound to take Scott's advice. Higgins described Scott's position as that of \\"a non-executive Admiral.\\"Masefield, pp. 241–42. Shortly before his death aboard the R101 in 1930, Scott told Flight magazine that, on the R100 and R101's intercontinental flights, he was \\"officer in command of the flight\\" and decided \\"all such points as when the ship would sail, her course, her speed, her altitude.\\" The airships' own captains were \\"in charge of the crew and discipline.\\" In his book on the R101, The Millionth Chance, James Leasor echoed Higgins's description, likening Scott's position to that of \\"an Admiral in his flagship\\", with Irwin being \\"the flagship captain and responsible for [crew] discipline.\\"  Second Atlantic crossing  In his capacity as \\"admiral\\", Scott flew from Cardington to Montreal and back aboard the R100 in mid-1930. The ship left Cardington in the early hours of 29 July and, despite some encounters with stormy conditions that caused damage to its tail fins (and would later cause some commentators to question Scott's judgement), arrived in Montreal early on 1 August, after 78 hours and 49 minutes of flying time. During its stay in Canada, the R100 made a flight of 25 hours and 57 minutes duration over Quebec and southern Ontario. The return flight set out on the evening of 13 August and arrived in Cardington on the morning of 16 August after 57 hours and 56 minutes of flying time; the trip was generally uneventful. Technical contributions In the immediate post–World War I years, Scott occupied the post of Chief Experimental Officer at Pulham. He conducted research on airship mooring, and the first high mast in Europe, high, was constructed at the site. The mast, which was erected in July 1919, was initially tested using the obsolescent rigid airship R24, which remained moored for periods of three to six weeks at a time. The R33 and R36 later used the Pulham mast, and the R100 and R101 used high masts (at Cardington and, in the R100's case, Saint-Hubert, Quebec, near Montreal) throughout their short lives. (The system was also adopted by the US Navy for the Shenandoah and Los Angeles but eventually abandoned in favour of shorter \\"stub\\" masts.) Scott was granted a number of patents relating to the mooring system. R100 moored to a high mast at Saint-Hubert, Quebec, 1930. Scott also contributed to the design of airships themselves; with R101 designer Colonel Vincent Richmond, he was responsible for that ship's novel unbraced transverse frames. In collaboration with Richmond or with the designer's assistant, Michael Rope, Scott was awarded patents for the frame design and for other features of the ship, including the wires that restrained its gasbags, its gas valves and its internally located passenger accommodation.  Personal life  In 1919, Scott married Jessie Campbell, eldest daughter of Archibald Jack Campbell, general manager of Beardmore's Dalmuir shipyards. The couple had one son and three daughters. During Scott's time at the Royal Airship Works, the family resided at Cotton End, near the airfield at Cardington. (Many years after Scott's death, in April 1972, the Goodyear blimp Europa broke away from its mooring mast at Cardington and came to rest, deflated, in a tree in the grounds of the former Scott residence.)  Death  After the R100's successful trip to Canada, attention turned to plans for a similar flight to India by the R101, in which Lord Thomson (then Secretary of State for Air) and other dignitaries would take part. However, extensive modifications, culminating in the lengthening of the airship, were needed to ensure sufficient disposable lift for the trip. The newly lengthened R101 emerged from its shed on 1 October 1930. Only one test flight was conducted before departure for India; this flight began on the evening of 1 October and was intended to last for 24 hours but was cut to 16 hours 51 minutes. Provision had been made for the flight to be curtailed \\"if the ship behaved well and if Major Scott was satisfied.\\"Report of the R.101 Inquiry, p. 90. According to Sir Peter Masefield in his 1982 history of the R101 project, To Ride the Storm, when the final decision to depart for India was taken on 2 October, Irwin, Richmond and Director of Airship Design R.B.B. Colmore, along with Scott, were \\"all satisfied that the airship was sound and airworthy and that the flight...could now be mounted with confidence\\".Masefield, p. 318. The R101 left Cardington, with Scott and 53 other people aboard, at 18:36 GMT on 4 October 1930, bound for Karachi with an intermediate stop at Ismaïlia in Egypt. (Scott had sought to expedite the departure in the hope of avoiding an approaching low-pressure area.)Report of the R.101 Inquiry, p. 69. Opinions differ on Scott's mood at the time of departure; Masefield quoted F. A. de V. Robertson of Flight to the effect that Scott's final words before departure were \\"The ship is really good now. I'm sure we'll have a splendid flight—and we'll see you back here just two weeks from now\\".Masefield, pp. 336–37. However, another historian of the programme, Geoffrey Chamberlain, presented a different view in his 1984 book Airships—Cardington, citing comments allegedly made by Scott to Ted Stupple, an R100 crewman who was a \\"frequent visitor\\" to Scott's household, before departure. According to Chamberlain, Scott asked Stupple to \\"keep an eye\\" on his (Scott's) pregnant wife, describing the R101 as \\"an old ragbag\\" that was \\"never going to make it\\". While flying over northern France in stormy conditions around 02:07 on 5 October, the R101 entered an uncommanded dive before recovering momentarily, then diving a second time, striking the ground at Allonne, Oise, (near Beauvais) and catching fire. Scott and 45 others were killed in the blaze, and two more individuals died of their injuries shortly afterwards; there were only six survivors. A subsequent inquiry blamed a \\"substantial loss of gas\\" for the accident. Scott's body was never identified. The victims were returned to London via special trains and warships to lie in state in Westminster Hall prior to a memorial service at St. Paul's Cathedral on 11 October; they were then taken by rail to Cardington and buried in a common grave in the cemetery of St. Mary the Virgin.  Reputation  = Praise = Hoetger on the Glockenspiel House in Bremen Both before and after his death, Scott was hailed for his achievements as an aviator, most notably the R34's Atlantic crossing, which, according to the Times's obituary, \\"immediately placed Great Britain at the head of airship construction and achievement\\". The Dictionary of National Biography described him as \\"without doubt the foremost British airship commander of his time\\" and praised his \\"cool, alert and expert handling\\" of the R34 during storms on the outward leg of its transatlantic flight. Alongside his achievements with the R34 and R100, Flight highlighted his decision to climb before conducting high-speed trials on the R36, thus (as described above) saving the ship from disaster when it experienced elevator and rudder failures. According to Flight, \\"there would probably have been one less tragedy on record\\" had similar precautions been taken in the testing of the US Army's Roma (which struck power lines and burned, with the loss of 34 lives, after experiencing a rudder failure on a test flight in 1922). The same journal predicted that \\"[i]f airships become...a regular craft either of commerce or of naval patrol, Scott will be ranked with Eckener as the two greatest among the early airship captains\\" and likened Scott to \\"his namesake, Captain Scott of South Pole fame\\" as \\"a gallant gentleman who gave his life in the attempt to solve great problems\\". According to the Times, \\"[n]one who ever had the good fortune to watch [Scott] handle a big airship in good weather or in bad [would] ever forget his consummate capability.\\" In Bremen are 10 Panels depicting seafarers from the sculptor Bernhard Hoetger on the Glockenspiel House in the Böttcherstraße. One Panel shows Scott as Arthur Whitten Brown and John Alcock, piloted the first non-stop transatlantic flight. = Criticism = However, some commentators have questioned aspects of Scott's judgement as an aviator. According to Sir Peter Masefield in To Ride the Storm, Scott \\"had a reputation...for determination and also for 'ham-handedness' [Masefield's quotes]\\". Masefield cited a series of landing accidents involving Scott, including the previously discussed incidents with the Parseval No. 4 at Barrow in 1915, the R36 at Pulham in 1921 and the R33 at Pulham in 1925. There were also a number of incidents in the R101's early days in which Scott took over control from Irwin during mooring or hangaring operations and made mistakes that resulted in serious delays or, in one case, in damage to the Cardington mooring mast.Masefield, pp. 129, 132, 133. In another episode, Scott released water ballast without Irwin's knowledge while the latter was conducting a landing.Masefield, p. 135. Both Irwin and his first officer, Noël Atherstone, expressed concern over these incidents.Masefield, pp. 129, 133. Moreover, according to Masefield, by the time the Imperial Airship Scheme came to fruition, Scott was \\"not the man he had been\\" at the time of the R34's Atlantic crossing; his judgement \\"had frequently been a cause for concern\\" and he \\"resented advice\\". Scott had taken to \\"unwise lunchtime drink\\", probably as a result of ill-health, and was \\"having difficulty in holding the position he had deservedly won\\".Masefield, p. 242. Masefield characterised Scott as \\"dogmatic, aloof and ill, reluctant to delegate to the Captains of the ships\\".Masefield, p. 333. Nevil Shute Norway, better known as the novelist Nevil Shute, was chief calculator (and later deputy chief engineer) under Barnes Wallis on the design of the R100 and a passenger on that ship's transatlantic flight. In his 1954 autobiography, Slide Rule, Shute criticised Scott for his decision to pass through, rather than avoid, a thunderstorm on the outbound leg of that flight; according to Shute, \\"even with the lesser knowledge of those days, Scott should have known better\\". Shute characterised Scott's decision on this occasion as \\"a reckless one\\".Shute, pp. 119–20. To Masefield, the episode was \\"another example of Scott's predilection to 'press- on regardless' [Masefield's quotes]\\", something that had been successful on the R34's Atlantic flight but caused \\"many problems\\" in later years.Masefield, p. 249. In respect of the R101's ill-fated India flight, Masefield argued that the departure was made at a time when \\"prudence would have dictated an operational postponement for better weather\\" and blamed the \\"known and obvious deterioration in [Scott's] judgement and competence\\" and the unwillingness of senior officials at the Air Ministry and Cardington to address the issue, as well as Scott's own unwillingness to acknowledge that airships were not \\"all- weather craft\\".Masefield, p. 434. According to Masefield, it would have been \\"in character\\" for Irwin and Atherstone to consider \\"a temporary and precautionary return to base to await better weather\\" around 19:00 on 4 October 1930, 24 minutes after departure from Cardington, but equally in character for Scott to be \\"all for pressing on\\".Masefield, p. 363. Masefield believed that Scott was the \\"final arbiter\\" of the decision not to turn back and that this decision was made around 19:19.Masefield, pp. 366–67. Shute also criticised Scott's judgement in relation to the R101's final flight. According to Shute, given that the R101 had \\"never flown in bad weather\\" and had undergone \\"virtually no trials at all\\" since its lengthening for the India flight, \\"it now [1954] appears reckless that Scott should have pressed on\\" when the weather outlook worsened two hours after departure from Cardington. In mitigation, however, Shute noted that in 1930 \\"a pilot was expected to be brave and resolute, a daredevil who was not afraid to take risks\\" and that \\"to turn back would destroy the whole of [Lord Thomson's] political programme.\\"Shute, pp. 142–43. (Shute viewed Lord Thomson as \\"primarily responsible for the organisation that produced the disaster.\\")Shute, pp. 130–31.  Notes   References  * Masefield, Peter G. (1982).

Prostitution occurs on the streets, in bars, hotels and brothels. Prostitution has been blamed for a rise in AIDS. the HIV prevalence amongst sex workers is 2%. Sex trafficking is a problem in the country. Law enforcement NGOs and sex workers report harassment and corruption by law enforcement and forced health checks. Since the setting up of the Police's \\"Department for Combating Human Trafficking and Crimes Against Public Morality\\" in 2013, the situation has deteriorated. In the capital, Bishkek, the former red-light district of Pravda Street is now devoid of prostitutes. A few \\"mamochki\\" (madams) are on the street, the sex workers being in nearby hotels. Kyrgyz police officers allegedly exploit female trafficking victims, including some younger than age 18, for sex both in saunas and on the street. Concerns persist about police misconduct and corruption, including allegations that police threaten and extort sex trafficking victims, including minors, and reports that police accept bribes from alleged traffickers to drop cases. Tais Plus NGO Таис Плюс (Tais Plus) is an organisation that advocate sex workers rights and provides support and education to sex workers. The organisation was started in 1997 by a group of sex workers as a \\"trade union\\". In 2000 it was registered as an NGO and received the status of a public organisation. Tais Plus were successful in opposing an amendment to the law in 2005 that criminalised sex work, and again in 2012 against a proposed amendment to make prostitution an administrative offence. It has been estimated that about 90% of street sex workers in Kyrgyzstan have reached by the organisation's outreach project. Sex trafficking Kyrgyzstan is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking abroad, reportedly in Turkey, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), India, Russia, Kazakhstan, South Korea, and within the country. Underage teenage girls from Uzbekistan increasingly are subjected to sex trafficking in the southern region of the Kyrgyzstan. Some men and women from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan transit the country as they migrate to Russia, the UAE, and Turkey, where they may be subjected to sex trafficking. Article 124 of the criminal code, entitled “Trafficking in Persons,” criminalises both sex and labour trafficking of adults and children. The article requires the prosecutor to prove the offender used force, blackmail, fraud, deception, or abduction for cases of sex trafficking regardless of whether the victim is a child or adult. The government initiated five sex trafficking investigations under article 124 in 2016. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Kyrgyzstan as a 'Tier 2' country.

Although now merged, the two repositories remain physically separate and both hold records created by Mennonite Church USA. The Mennonite Church USA Archives is administered by the Mennonite Church USA Historical Committee. The Archives of the Mennonite Church was founded by the Mennonite Church Historical Committee in 1937 to house collections pertaining to Mennonite and Anabaptist history. The Archives are housed in Newcomer Center on the campus of Goshen College, Indiana. Collections The Archives contain 1,800 personal collections including the manuscripts of significant Mennonite thinkers such as John Howard Yoder, Harold S. Bender, J.C. Wenger, Guy F. Hershberger, Robert Friedmann, John F. Funk, John S. Coffman, Emma Richards, and Peter J. Dyck.

Respectively, these sites focus primarily on the documents pertaining to the (now combined under Mennonite Church USA) (old) MC (Mennonite Church) and GC (General Conference Mennonite Church). Combined, these two locations contain some 20 million documents related to the Mennonite and Anabaptist faith. History Mennonite archival endeavors in North America began in earnest during the early part of the 20th century. In 1911, ten men, including John Horsch and J.B. Smith, in Johnstown, PA were appointed by the (old) Mennonite Church to create a document of church history. Two years later, the conference began buying books on church history and by 1923 had amassed 200 titles in their library in Scottdale, Pennsylvania. After John F. Funk's library was added to the collection, the committee self-proclaimed their records to be \\"the most valuable library on Mennonite History in America\\"Sharp, John E.

The dish is common both to the Tagus riverside plains and the hill rugged area of the vineyards, mainly in the area of Almeirim, Azambuja, Cartaxo and Santarém municipalities. Background Torricado originates from the subsistence of rural workers, as an inexpensive and practical way of making lunch while at work in the fields. It is nowadays usually served in family reunions and friend gatherings, as well as in some local festivities. Preparation A large bread, usually aged by two days, is cut longitudinally in halves, the inner part sliced in several diamond shaped crumbs and placed over a charcoal fire to toast. The bread is later brushed with a garlic clove and olive oil and salt are added in the meantime, during the roasting process. Garlic and olive oil are a common feature in the local cuisine, and salted cod is a traditional ingredient in Portuguese diet.

Israeli forces were subjected to a double attack by fighters from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The battle was referred to in Israel as \\"The attack in the worshipers route\\",. The place where the attack took place became known as the \\"Alley of Death\\" both in Hebrew and Arabic. The ambush was initially dubbed as the \\"Sabbath massacre\\" () by official Israeli spokespersons. The attacks were carried out in a narrow alley, off the passage from the south gate of Kiryat Arba to the Tomb of the Patriarchs by three Palestinian attackers. Twelve Israeli soldiers, gendarmes, and civilian security guards, including three high-ranking officers, were killed in the battle, as were all three of the Palestinian attackers. The attack One of the fighters positioned himself near the front of the exit gate of Kiryat Arba towards Hebron. The remaining two fighters positioned themselves near the a narrow alley off the road used as a passage by all Jewish worshipers heading from Kiryat Arba to the Tomb of the Patriarchs. Four Nahal Brigade soldiers on patrol, accompanied by Border Police jeeps were heading out of the \\"Worshippers Way\\" after patrol that area. In addition, two additional Nahal soldiers were positioned in an observation post located nearby and several more IDF soldiers were located near the exit gate of Kiryat Arba. A group of settlers from Kiryat Arba had visited the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron for a Sabbath eve service and were escorted back to the settlement by Israeli military. A few minutes after the all clear signal rang, signaling that all the settlers had safely returned to Kiryat Arba, the first bullets were fired. At 6:55 pm the Palestinian fighters opened fire simultaneously on a group of soldiers guarding the south gate of Kiryat Arba and a patrol passing through a narrow alley leading from the Tomb of the Patriarchs to Kiryat Arba. Two soldiers in the alley were wounded. One IDF paramedic was killed trying to evacuate the wounded. The Palestinian fighters moved positions frequently during the more than 4 hours of fighting creating the impression that many more fighters were involved. They lured Israeli forces off the \\"Path of Worshipers\\" into the narrow alley, later known as the \\"Alley of Death\\". Minutes later Border Police Superintendent Samih Sweidan arrived at the scene and drove immediately into the alley to engage the Palestinian fighters and evacuate the wounded. He and his driver were shot to death, apparently at point-blank range, as they stepped out of their jeep. Meanwhile, one of the wounded trapped in the alley died of his wounds. The attack had hardly lasted five minutes and already four Israeli soldiers were dead. A few minutes later a fifth soldier was shot and killed. The killed and wounded soldiers remained in the exposed alley. Around 7:15 pm the Palestinian fighters ceased fire, creating the impression that they had run away. At this time the commander of the IDF Hebron Brigade, Colonel Dror Weinberg arrived at the scene. He quickly organized a force of three jeeps and entered the alley. When Weinberg reached Sweidan's jeep he was hit by a bullet and severely wounded. After being evacuated he died from his wounds, becoming the highest ranking Israeli casualty of the Second Intifada. Before being hit Col. Weinberg had contacted the settler's security service, the Kiryat Arba Emergency Response Team. Around 7:40 pm the head of the response team, Yitzhak Buanish, entered the alley together with a force consisting of his own men and Border Police soldiers. As in the previous rescue attempts, they were ambushed. Buanish and two of his colleagues were killed and another five wounded. Two Border Police officers were also killed in the incident. The first Palestinian fighter was probably killed in this incident as well. At 7:50 pm the IDF entered the alley with armored personal carriers and started engaging the Palestinians. Firing continued until 8:15 pm when the Palestinians stopped firing back and the dead and wounded soldiers could be evacuated. But fighting flared up again. Control over the situation was gradually restored with the arrival of reinforcements and commanding officers. Lieutenant Colonel Eran, head of the Nahal Brigade in Hebron, and soldiers from the Duvdevan elite unit, rushed to Hebron from Ramallah, outflanked the two remaining gunmen and killed them. That was close to 11:30 pm, more than four hours after the attack started. The Islamic Jihad fighters The attack was carried out by three members of the Jerusalem Brigades, the military wing of the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine. According to a statement by the Jerusalem Brigades the attack was intended as a revenge for Israel's killing of the regional Islamic Jihad leader Iyad Sawalha in Jenin earlier in the week as well as \\"other crimes against our people\\". According to Israel, Sawalha was responsible for two suicide bombings that killed 31 Israelis. The three fighters were all in their early 20s and enrolled as engineering students at the Hebron Polytechnic. According to Palestinian sources they had prepared the ambush for more than two months, scouting the area of the attack thoroughly and especially studying Israeli security arrangements along the road between the Cave of the Patriarchs and Kiryat Arba. The operation was planned as a suicide attack and the participants had written their customary wills. Israeli responsive actions The Palestinian-administered part of Hebron was re-occupied by Israeli forces and a curfew was declared throughout the city. The curfew remained in force for more than six months. Four Palestinian houses were demolished by the IDF.UN Docs Chronological Review of Events November 2002 Prime Minister Ariel Sharon told IDF commanders in Hebron two days after the incident that a territorial continuity between the settlement of Kiryat Arba and the Jewish section of Hebron must be created and the safety of the Jews living in the divided city be ensured, reducing to a minimum the presence of Palestinians in the area in which the settlers live.PM calls for territorial continuity from Kiryat Arba to Hebron. Haaretz, 17 November 2002 The mayor of Kiryat Arba, Zvi Katsover, called on the government to \\"clean up the area\\" by destroying Palestinian buildings along a road connecting Kiryat Arba to Hebron. The Kiryat Arba Council and the council of settlers in Hebron's Jewish enclave requested building of 1,000 housing units between Kiryat Arba and the Tomb of the Patriarchs. Housing and Construction Minister Natan Sharansky supported the plan and ordered his ministry's workers to review the possibility of expropriating lands in the city and using them for Jewish residential purposes.Hebron settlers plan to build 1,000 units in new neighborhood. Amos Harel and Nadav Shragai, Haaretz, 19 November 2002 On 29 November 2002 the Israel Defense Forces issued the \\"Decree Number 61/02/T to Expropriate Property\\" with the purpose to expropriate an 8.2 dunam large area in Hebron and to create a 6 to 12 meter wide corridor linking the Jewish settlement in Hebron with Kiryat Arba. According to the American administration and Israeli sources close to the planning, the aim of the expropriation of the land and the building of the promenade was to create territorial contiguity between Kiryat Arba and Hebron.Pernicious promenade. Esther Zandberg, Haaretz, 12 December 2002 The military order was appealed to the High Court of Justice. The petition was rejected by the High Court after the IDF declared that they intended to demolish only two houses. In August 2004, three of the 22 buildings originally considered for demolition were destroyed. On 30 December a Palestinian teenager Imran Abu Hamadiya (17 years old) was apprehended by a Border Police patrol from his home near the Cave of the Patriarchs and found dead near the Hebron Industrial zone 20 minutes later. After an investigation four border policemen were arrested. Apparently the young man had been beaten and then thrown out of the patrol car at full speed.  Reports and reactions  Official Israeli spokesmen initially described the battle as a massacre of civilian Israeli settlers returning from Sabbath prayers. Gilad Millo, spokesman of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, originally called the attack as the \\"Sabbath massacre,\\" and Israel's Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement, calling the event \\"The cold-blooded attack on civilians whose only 'sin' was to go to a holy place of worship on the eve of the Jewish Sabbath and on those people assigned to protect them\\".International media outlets initially reported that the Palestinian ambush had targeted both settlers and soldiers. The following day army officials said that only soldiers or security personnel were hurt in the ambush. Matan Vilnai a former general and a leading Labour Party politician admitted that \\"[i]t wasn't a massacre, it was a battle.\\" On 15 November, the Spokesman for the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan condemned \\"the despicable terrorist attack... that today killed 10 Jewish worshippers on their way to the Sabbath eve prayers... [a] terrorist act against Israeli civilians\\". but on 19 November, the Spokesman for Secretary-General said, \\"The information available to us when the statement was issued was that the victims were Israeli civilians returning from religious service...Subsequently, it now appears that the Israeli victims were in fact soldiers and security personnel\\" and urged \\"a broad approach to resolving the Middle East conflict\\".

Many settlers blamed the death of the three Kiryat Arba security men on the \\"cowardice\\" of IDF soldiers. Three Israeli officers were dismissed from their posts in December 2002 for their personal failures in the Hebron ambush. The death of several high-ranking officers created a \\"command vacuum\\" that the remaining officers proved unable to fill, creating \\"a situation in which the decision-making fell into the hands of civilians (local settlers)\\", that is the Response Team members. \\"When civilians command the army - this is not an acceptable situation as far as we are concerned.\\" In the site where the battle took place the \\"Giborim outpost\\" (מאחז הגיבורים) was constructed which originally included a small number of temporary structures and tents housed by the number of young people and families who demanded to build a neighborhood in the site in memory of the fallen. 30 days after the incident the outpost was evacuated by the Israel military forces. Since then the area has been declared as a 'closed military area' by the local IDF commander.Giborim Outpost Activists Arrested - Latest News Briefs - Israel National News The three Response Team members, who all worked full-time in the security service, were accorded military ceremony funerals \\"due to their involvement in Hevron security\\". A month after the incident, the three killed civilian security men were formally recognized by the Ministry of Defense as \\"fallen soldiers.\\" The Israeli Chief of Staff posthumously granted the Chief of Staff Medal of Appreciation to Yitzhak Buanish, Alexander Zwitman and Alexander Dohan - the Kiryat Arba Emergency Response Team, as well as to Elijah Liebman, the chief of security of the Jewish community in Hebron. After his death, Sgt. Gad Rahamim was granted the Medal of Courage for his part in the battle. On 12 December, a Palestinian fighter from Hamas walked up to two Israeli Military Policemen, from the Sahlav unit, doing guard duty outside the Cave of the Patriarchs and shot them point-blank. The two soldiers were identified as Cpl. Keren Ya'akobi, and Sgt. Maor Kalfon. The former was the first female operational fatality of the IDF in the Second Intifada. On 27 December four yeshiva students, two of them IDF soldiers, were killed in the Yeshivat Otniel shooting attack in the settlement of Otniel, south of Hebron. The attack was carried out by the same unit of the Islamic Jihad that carried out the Hebron ambush. In August 2003 Muhammed Sidr, the head of Islamic Jihad in Hebron, was killed in an arrest operation in Hebron. The Hebron ambush was claimed to have been carried out \\"under Sidr's guidance\\". A month later Majid Abu Dosh was killed in similar circumstances outside Hebron. According to Haaretz Abu Dosh was \\"considered the \\"operations officer\\" of Islamic Jihad in the Hebron area, and the right-hand man of Islamic Jihad leader Mohammed Sidr. Abu-Dosh is said to have planned the attack on Worshipers' Way in Hebron.\\" In December 2003 Nour Jaber, the head of the Islamic Jihad movement in Hebron, was sentenced to 17 life sentences for his role in planning the Hebron ambush operation as well as another attack on the Hesder yeshiva (military religious academy) of Otniel, where four yeshiva students were killed. Palestinian sources confirm that Jaber was actively involved in the planning of the ambush. A web page connected to Islamic Jihad celebrating the attackers mentions, apart from the three dead, Jaber's role in the attack and described him as the planner of the operation.

The band's core lineup featured vocalist and harmonica player Keith Relf, drummer Jim McCarty, rhythm guitarist/bassist Chris Dreja and bassist/producer Paul Samwell-Smith. The band is known for starting the careers of three of rock's most famous guitarists, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck, all of whom ranked in the top five of Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 greatest guitarists. The band had a string of hits throughout the mid-1960s, including \\"For Your Love\\", \\"Heart Full of Soul\\", \\"Shapes of Things\\" and \\"Over Under Sideways Down\\". Originally a blues-based band noted for their signature \\"rave- up\\" instrumental breaks, the Yardbirds broadened their range into pop, pioneering psychedelic rock and early hard rock; and contributed to many electric guitar innovations of the mid-1960s. Some rock critics and historians also cite their influence on the later punk rock, progressive rock, and heavy metal trends. Following the band's split in 1968, Relf and McCarty formed Renaissance and guitarist Jimmy Page formed Led Zeppelin. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.\\"The Yardbirds: inducted in 1992\\". The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum.

Retrieved 26 April 2012 The Yardbirds reformed in the 1990s, featuring drummer Jim McCarty and rhythm guitarist/bassist Chris Dreja as the only original members of the band. Dreja left the band in 2012, leaving McCarty as the sole original member of the band present in the lineup. History =Beginnings= The band formed in the south-west London suburbs in 1963. Relf and Samwell-Smith were originally in a band named the Metropolitan Blues Quartet. After being joined by Dreja, McCarty and Top Topham, they performed at Kingston Art School in late May 1963 as a backup band for Cyril Davies. Following a couple of gigs in September 1963 as the Blue-Sounds, they changed their name to the Yardbirds. McCarty claims that Relf was the first to use the name, who may have gotten it from Jack Kerouac's novel On the Road, where it referred to rail yard hobos. He adds that Topham identified it as a nickname for jazz saxophonist Charlie \\"Yardbird\\" Parker. The quintet achieved notice on the burgeoning British rhythm and blues scene when they took over as the house band at the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond, succeeding the Rolling Stones. Their repertoire drew from the Chicago blues of Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley, Sonny Boy Williamson II and Elmore James, including \\"Smokestack Lightning\\", \\"Good Morning Little School Girl\\", \\"Boom Boom\\", \\"I Wish You Would\\", \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\", \\"Got Love if You Want It\\" and \\"I'm a Man\\". Original lead guitarist Topham left and was replaced by Eric Clapton in October 1963. Crawdaddy Club impresario Giorgio Gomelsky became the Yardbirds manager and first record producer. Under Gomelsky's guidance the Yardbirds toured Britain as the back-up band for blues legend Sonny Boy Williamson II in December 1963 and early 1964, recording live tracks on 8 December and other dates. The recordings would be released two years later during the height of the Yardbirds popularity on the album Sonny Boy Williamson and the Yardbirds. After the tours with Williamson, the Yardbirds signed to EMI's Columbia label in February 1964, and recorded more live tracks 20 March at the legendary Marquee Club in London. The resulting album of mostly American blues and R&B; covers, Five Live Yardbirds, was released by Columbia nine months later, and it failed to enter the UK albums charts. Over time Five Live gained stature as one of the few quality live recordings of the era, and as a historical document of both the British \\"rock and roll boom\\" in the 1960s and Clapton's time in the band. =Breakthrough success and Clapton departure= The Clapton line-up recorded two singles, the blues \\"I Wish You Would\\" and \\"Good Morning, School Girl\\", before the band scored its first major hit with \\"For Your Love\\", a Graham Gouldman composition with a prominent harpsichord part by Brian Auger. \\"For Your Love\\" hit the top of the charts in the UK and Canada and reached number six in the United States, but it displeased Clapton, a blues purist whose vision extended beyond three-minute singles. Frustrated by the commercial approach, he abruptly left the band on 25 March 1965, the day the single was released. Soon Clapton joined John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, but not before he recommended Jimmy Page, a prominent young session guitarist, to replace him. Content with his lucrative sessions work, and worried about both his health and the politics of Clapton's departure, Page in turn recommended his friend Jeff Beck. Beck played his first gig with the Yardbirds only two days after Clapton's departure. =Jeff Beck's tenure; pioneers of British psychedelia= Beck's exploration of fuzz tone, reverb, feedback, sustain, distortion and hammer-on soloing fit well into the increasingly raw style of British beat music. The Yardbirds began to experiment with eclectic arrangements reminiscent of Gregorian chants and various European and Asian styles while Beck infused a pervasive Middle Eastern influence into the mix. Beck was voted No. 1 lead guitarist of 1966 in the British music magazine Beat Instrumental. The Beck-era Yardbirds produced a number of groundbreaking recordings. These included the hit singles \\"Heart Full of Soul\\", \\"Evil Hearted You\\"/\\"Still I'm Sad\\", a cover of Bo Diddley's \\"I'm a Man\\" (US only), \\"Shapes of Things\\" and \\"Over Under Sideways Down\\", and the Yardbirds album (known popularly as Roger the Engineer). Beck's fuzz-tone guitar riff on \\"Heart Full of Soul\\" helped to introduce Indian-influenced guitar stylings to the pop charts in the summer of 1965. The follow-up, the reverb-laden \\"Evil Hearted You\\", furthered the Eastern influence, while its B-side, \\"Still I'm Sad\\", featured the band chanting like Gregorian monks. The Diddley cover, \\"I'm a Man\\", was hard blues rock, featured the Yardbirds' signature \\"rave-up\\", where the tempo shifted to double time and Relf's harmonica and Beck's scratching guitar raced to a climax before falling back into the original beat. The band embarked on their first US tour in late August 1965. A pair of albums were put together for the US market: For Your Love and Having a Rave Up, half of which came from the earlier Five Live Yardbirds album, combined with new tracks such as \\"You're a Better Man Than I\\" and \\"Train Kept A-Rollin'\\", both recorded with legendary producer Sam Phillips at Sun Studios in Memphis, Tennessee, during the first US tour. There were three more US tours during Beck's time with the band, and a brief European tour in April 1966. left The single \\"Shapes of Things\\", released in February 1966, \\"can justifiably be classified as the first psychedelic rock classic\\", according to music journalist Richie Unterberger and heralded the coming of British psychedelia three months before the Beatles' \\"Paperback Writer\\" B-side \\"Rain\\". Reaching number three on the UK charts and 11 in the US, \\"Shapes\\" was also the Yardbirds' first self-penned hit, the previous three UK A-sides having been written by Gouldman. Relf's vague anti-war protest lyrics and Beck's feedback-driven, Middle Eastern-influenced solo reflected the band's increasing embrace of psychedelia, as did the B-side \\"You're A Better Man Than I\\" and the follow-up single, \\"Over Under Sideways Down\\". The latter was released in May and featuring more quixotic lyrics by Relf and another Eastern-inspired guitar line by Beck. The \\"Over Under Sideways Down\\" sessions were held in April 1966 and produced the album Yardbirds. It was commonly referred to as \\"Roger the Engineer\\", which were the words scrawled under a cartoon by Dreja of engineer Roger Cameron that appears on the cover of the UK release.Yardbirds, album by The Yardbirds, reissue 2011 by Demon Records Ltd, EU In the US, an abridged version of the album, minus the cartoon cover art, was released as Over Under Sideways Down. The recording session marked the Yardbirds' split with their manager, Giorgio Gomelsky, as writer Simon Napier- Bell took over management and shared production credit with Samwell-Smith. The band, led by Relf and McCarty, eschewed cover material, writing the entire album themselves. They were allotted \\"a whole week\\" to record the album, according to Dreja, resulting in a \\"crammed\\" albeit eclectic mix of blues, hard rock, monkish chanting (\\"Turn into Earth\\", \\"Ever Since the World Began\\") and African tribal rhythms (\\"Hot House of Omagararshid\\"). Beck's guitar lines were a unifying constant throughout. Roger the Engineer was ranked at number 350 on Rolling Stone magazine's \\"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\". =The Beck/Page line-up= Roger the Engineer was released in June 1966. Soon afterwards, Samwell-Smith quit the band at a drunken gig at Queen's College in OxfordRosen, Steven (25 May 2007). \\"1977 Jimmy Page Interview\\" Modern Guitars.

Jimmy Page, who was at the show, agreed that night to play bass until rhythm guitarist Dreja could rehearse on the instrument. The band toured with Page on bass, and Beck and Dreja on guitars, playing dates in Paris, the UK, the Midwestern US and the California coast. Beck fell ill late in the latter tour, and was hospitalised in San Francisco. Page took over as lead guitarist at the Carousel Ballroom (San Francisco) on 25 August and Dreja switched to bass. Beck stayed in San Francisco to recuperate with his girlfriend Mary Hughes, while the rest of the band completed the tour. After the Yardbirds reunited in London, Dreja remained on bass and the group's dual lead guitar attack was born. The Beck–Page lead guitar tandem created the avant garde psychedelic rock single \\"Happenings Ten Years Time Ago\\" (with future Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones on bass instead of Dreja), which the band recorded in July and September 1966. The single's UK B-side was \\"Psycho Daisies\\", two minutes of embryonic garage punk sludge featuring Beck on vocals and lead guitar, and Page on bass. The single's B-side in the US, \\"The Nazz Are Blue\\", also features a rare lead vocal by Beck. The Yardbirds featuring both Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page, taken from the Michelangelo Antonioni film Blowup, 1966 The Yardbirds also recorded \\"Stroll On\\", a reworking of Tiny Bradshaw's \\"Train Kept A-Rollin'\\", recorded for Michelangelo Antonioni's critically acclaimed film Blow-Up. Relf changed the song's lyrics and title to avoid having to seek permission from the copyright holder. Their appearance in the film, about a hip fashion photographer (played by David Hemmings) undergoing an existential crisis in Swinging London, came after the Who declined and the In-Crowd were unable to attend the filming. Andy Warhol \\"Factory\\" band The Velvet Underground were also considered for the part but were unable to acquire UK work permits.Bockris, Victor; Malanga, Gerard. Up-Tight: The Velvet Underground Story (2002): 107 Director Antonioni instructed Beck to smash his guitar in emulation of the Who's Pete Townshend. The guitar that Beck destroys in the film was a cheap Höfner instrument. The Beck–Page line-up recorded little else in the studio. No live recordings of the dual-lead guitar lineup have surfaced, except for \\"Great Shakes\\", a commercial recorded for Great Shakes milkshakes using the opening riff of \\"Over Under Sideways Down\\", included on the 1992 Little Games Sessions & More compilation. One recording made by Beck and Page in May 1966, just weeks before Page joined the Yardbirds, was \\"Beck's Bolero\\". This piece was inspired by Ravel's \\"Bolero\\" and credited to Page (although Beck also claims to have written the song), with John Paul Jones on bass, Keith Moon on drums and Nicky Hopkins on piano. Around the time of this session, the idea of a \\"supergroup\\" involving Beck, Page, Moon and Who bassist John Entwistle originated, with Entwistle suggesting it would \\"go over like a lead balloon\\" and Moon quipping that they could call the band \\"Lead Zeppelin\\".Schulps, Dave. \\"Interview with Jimmy Page\\". Trouser Press (October 1977). Retrieved 16 December 2012. Although all the musicians remained with their respective bands, Page recalled the conversation in 1968 when deciding on the name for Led Zeppelin. \\"Beck's Bolero\\" was first released in 1967 as the B-side of Beck's first solo single, \\"Hi Ho Silver Lining\\", and was included the following year on the Jeff Beck Group's debut album, Truth. alt= The Yardbirds opened for the Rolling Stones' 1966 UK tour (with Ike & Tina Turner, Peter Jay and Long John Baldry also on the bill), released the \\"Happenings\\" single, shot their scenes in Blow-Up, and then headed back to the US for a show at the Fillmore West in San Francisco, and a slot on American Bandstand host Dick Clark's \\"Caravan of Stars\\" tour, which they joined in Texas. After a few shows with the Caravan, Beck stormed out and headed back to San Francisco and Mary Hughes. The band, still in Texas, continued on the Dick Clark tour as a quartet, with Page as sole lead guitarist. They caught up with Beck in late November, at which point Beck officially left the band. Beck's lack of professionalism, his temper, Relf's drunkenness, the gruelling and unrewarding Dick Clark Caravan, and other pressures were cited, none of which involved Beck actually being fired. Beck's official departure was announced on 30 November in the US. The Yardbirds finished their remaining US dates with Page as sole lead guitarist and headed back to the UK for more shows scheduled by Napier-Bell. Beck continued as a solo artist. =Final days: the Page era= Page subsequently introduced playing the instrument with a cello bow (suggested to him by violinist David McCallum Sr.)Fricke, David. \\"Secrets of the Guitar Heroes: Jimmy Page\\" Rolling Stone 12 June 2008 and the combination of a wah-wah pedal in addition to a distortion fuzzbox. Other innovations included the use of a taped noise loop in live settings (on the psychedelic dirge \\"Glimpses\\") and open-tuned guitar to enhance the sitar-like sounds the Yardbirds were known for. Meanwhile, the act's commercial fortunes were declining. \\"Happenings Ten Years Time Ago\\" had only reached No. 30 on the US Hot 100 and had fared worse in Britain. The band dropped Napier-Bell and entered into a partnership with Columbia Records hit-making producer, Mickie Most, known for his work with the Animals, Herman's Hermits and Scottish singer Donovan, yet this move failed to reignite their chart success. After the disappointing sales of \\"Happenings\\", the single \\"Little Games\\" released in March 1967 flopped so badly in the UK (where it was backed by \\"Puzzles\\") that EMI did not release another Yardbirds record there until after the band broke up. A 1968 UK release of the \\"Goodnight Sweet Josephine\\" single was planned but cancelled. A version of Tony Hazzard's \\"Ha Ha Said the Clown\\" – on which only Relf performed – backed by the Relf–McCarty original \\"Tinker Tailor, Soldier Sailor\\", was the band's last single to enter the US top 50, peaking at No. 44 on the Billboard charts in the summer of 1967. Epic compiled the six earlier A-side hits and B-sides (\\"New York City Blues\\", \\"Still I'm Sad\\") with the heaviest material from For Your Love (\\"I'm Not Talking\\") and Having a Rave Up (\\"Smokestack Lightning\\"), and released The Yardbirds Greatest Hits in the US in March 1967. The album featured the first appearance of \\"Happenings\\" and \\"Shapes of Things\\" on an album. Although it omitted \\"Psycho Daisies\\", which had only been released in the UK as a B-side, Greatest Hits described to the Yardbirds' growing American audience an almost complete picture of \\"what made the Yardbirds a great band\\", according to AllMusic critic Bruce Eder.Eder, Bruce. \\"The Yardbirds' Greatest Hits – Review\\".

In the description of author Greg Russo, the compilation also presented young garage rock musicians of the psychedelic era with a handy textbook of the band's work during 1965–66.Russo, Greg (1998). Yardbirds: The Ultimate Rave-Up. Floral Park, New York: Crossfire Publications. . Greatest Hits was the Yardbirds' best-selling US album release, peaking at No. 28 on the Billboard charts. The band spent the first half of 1967 touring Australia, New Zealand, Denmark and France (including a stop in Cannes to help promote Blow- Up). They also played a handful of shows in the UK in June, before heading to Vancouver to begin their fourth tour of North America with Page. Their final album, Little Games, was released in July 1967, again only in the US. It was a commercial and critical non-entity. A cover of Harry Nilsson's \\"Ten Little Indians\\" charted briefly in the United States. The Yardbirds spent much of the rest of that year touring in the US with new manager Peter Grant, their live shows becoming heavier and more experimental. The band rarely played their 1967 Most-produced singles on stage, preferring to mix the Beck-era hits with blues standards and experimental psychedelia such as \\"Glimpses\\", a Page- written piece from Little Games featuring bowed guitars, pre-recorded noise loops and a hypnotic wah-wah guitar groove. They also covered the Velvet Underground (\\"I'm Waiting for the Man\\") and Bob Dylan (\\"Most Likely You Go Your Way And I'll Go Mine\\") and American folk singer Jake Holmes, whose \\"Dazed and Confused\\", with overhauled arrangement by Page and lyrics modified by Relf, was shaped in fall of 1967 and a live fixture of the final American tour in 1968. \\"Dazed and Confused\\" went down so well that Page selected it for the first Led Zeppelin record, on which it appears with further revised lyrics and Page credited as writer. (Page and Holmes would settle on an \\"Inspired by\\" credit for Holmes in 2011). By 1968, the psychedelic blues rock of Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience was enormously popular, yet Relf and McCarty wished to pursue a style influenced by folk and classical music. Page wanted to continue with the kind of \\"heavy\\" music for which Led Zeppelin would become iconic. Dreja was developing an interest in photography. By March, Relf and McCarty had decided to leave but were persuaded by the other two to stay at least for one more American tour. The band's final single was recorded in January and released two months later. Reflecting the divergences of the band members and their producer, the A-side, \\"Goodnight Sweet Josephine\\", was another Mickie Most-produced pop single, while the B-side, \\"Think About It\\", featured a proto-Zeppelin Page riff and snippets of the \\"Dazed and Confused\\" guitar solo. It failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. A concert and some album tracks were recorded in New York City in March and early April (including the unreleased song \\"Knowing That I'm Losing You\\", an early version of a track that would be re-recorded by Led Zeppelin as \\"Tangerine\\").Dave Lewis (1994), The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin, Omnibus Press, . All were shelved at the band's request, but after Led Zeppelin became successful Epic tried to release the concert material as Live Yardbirds: Featuring Jimmy Page. The album was quickly withdrawn after Page's lawyers filed an injunction. The Yardbirds played their final shows on 31 May and 1 June at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, and on 4 and 5 June at the Spring Fair at the Montgomery International Speedway in Alabama. The Los Angeles shows were documented in the bootleg release Last Rave-Up in L.A.

Rolling Stone magazine announced the break-up by saying that Page \\"intends to go into solo recording work\\".Rock, John J. Rolling Stone 6 July 1968 =The Yardbirds, The New Yardbirds and Led Zeppelin= Page and Dreja, with a tour of Scandinavia scheduled for late summer 1968, saw the break-up as an opportunity to put a new lineup together with Page as producer and Grant as manager. Page initially described his vision for the new band as \\"a new sort of collage of sound\\" that would include mellotron keyboard while still featuring the guitar. Procol Harum's B.J. Wilson, Paul Francis and session man Clem Cattini, who had guested on more than a few Yardbirds tracks under Most's supervision, were considered as drummers. Young vocalist and composer Terry Reid was asked to replace Relf but declined because of a new recording contract with Most and recommended the then-unknown Robert Plant.Dave Schulps, Interview with Jimmy Page, Trouser Press, October 1977. Plant, in turn, recommended his childhood friend John Bonham as a drummer. Dreja bowed out to pursue a career as a rock photographer. Bassist/keyboardist/arranger John Paul Jones – who had worked with Page on countless sessions, including several with the Yardbirds – approached Page and offered his services. Rehearsals began in mid-August 1968; in early September, Page's revised Yardbirds embarked as the New Yardbirds on the Scandinavian tour, after which the band returned to the UK to produce the debut Led Zeppelin album. While Page's new roster still played a few songs from the Yardbirds' canon – usually \\"Train Kept a-Rollin',\\" \\"Dazed and Confused\\" or \\"For Your Love\\" and snatches of Beck's \\"Shapes of Things\\" solo – a name (and identity) change was in order in October 1968. They appeared on contracts, promotional material, ticket stubs and other collateral as \\"The Yardbirds\\" or \\"The New Yardbirds\\" for three shows in October 1968, with the Marquee Club date reported as the Yardbirds' \\"farewell London appearance\\" and the Liverpool University show 19 Oct announced as the Yardbirds' \\"last ever appearance\\". This may have been motivated, at least in part, by a cease-and-desist order from Dreja, who claimed that he maintained legal rights to \\"The Yardbirds\\" name,Wall, Mick. When Giants Walked the Earth: A Biography of Led Zeppelin (2009): 72 although most sources indicate that Page and Grant fully intended to change the name after they returned from Scandinavia with or without the nudge from Dreja. From 19 October 1968 onwards, they were Led Zeppelin, the name taken from The Who bandmembers Moon and Entwistle's \\"lead balloon\\" discussion of the \\"supergroup\\" that had played on the \\"Beck's Bolero\\" sessions in May 1966. The spelling of \\"lead\\" was changed to avoid confusion over the pronunciation. This effectively marked the end of the Yardbirds for the next 24 years. =After the Yardbirds= Jim McCarty, drums, the Yardbirds, 1963–68, 1992–present Relf and McCarty formed an acoustic rock band called Together and then Renaissance, which recorded two albums for Island Records over a two-year period. McCarty formed the band Shoot in 1973. Relf, after producing albums for Medicine Head (with whom he also played bass) and Saturnalia, resurfaced in 1975 with a new quartet, Armageddon; a hybrid of heavy metal, hard rock and folk influences, which now included former Renaissance bandmate Louis Cennamo, drummer Bobby Caldwell (previously a member of Captain Beyond and Johnny Winter), and guitarist Martin Pugh (from Steamhammer, Rod Stewart's An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down, and most recently in 7th Order). They recorded one promising album before Relf died in an electrical accident in his home studio on 12 May 1976. In 1977, Illusion was formed, featuring a reunited lineup of the original Renaissance, including McCarty and Keith's sister Jane Relf. In the 1980s McCarty, Dreja and Samwell-Smith formed a short-lived but fun Yardbirds semi- reunion called Box of Frogs, which occasionally included Beck and Page plus various friends with whom they had all recorded over the years. They recorded two albums for Epic, the self-titled \\"Box of Frogs\\" (1984) and \\"Strange Land\\" (1986). McCarty was also part of 'The British Invasion All-Stars' with members of Procol Harum, The Creation, the Nashville Teens, the Downliners Sect and The Pretty Things. Phil May and Dick Taylor of the Pretty Things, together with McCarty, recorded two albums in Chicago as the Pretty Things-Yardbirds Blues Band – The Chicago Blues Tapes 1991 and Wine, Women, Whiskey, both produced by George Paulus.

Eric Clapton, whose Hall of Fame induction was the first of three, was unable to attend because of his obligations while recording and working on a show for the MTV Unplugged series. Accepting the induction on behalf of the late Keith Relf were his wife April and son Danny. =Reformation= In 1992, Peter Barton from Rock Artist Management contacted Jim McCarty about the prospect of reforming the Yardbirds. McCarty was interested but only if Chris Dreja would agree, but at the time he thought it highly unlikely that Dreja would want to tour again. Barton then contacted Dreja, who agreed to give it a try. Their debut gig was booked at the Marquee Club in London along with the newly reformed Animals. It was a great success. The lineup featured John Idan handling bass and lead vocals. Barton managed the band and booked all their dates for over a decade; he still works with the band on occasion. The Yardbirds at Langueux (France) 9 September 2006, left to right: John Idan, Jim McCarty (behind the drums) and Chris Dreja. Photo: Corentin Lamy. In 2003, a new album, Birdland, was released under the Yardbirds name on the Favored Nations label by a lineup including Chris Dreja, Jim McCarty and new members Gypie Mayo (lead guitar, backing vocals), John Idan (bass, lead vocals) and Alan Glen (harmonica, backing vocals), which consisted of a mixture of new material mostly penned by McCarty and re-recordings of some of their greatest hits, with guest appearances by Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Slash, Brian May, Steve Lukather, Jeff \\"Skunk\\" Baxter, John Rzeznik, Martin Ditchum and Simon McCarty. Also, Jeff Beck reunited with his former bandmates on the song \\"My Blind Life\\". And then there was the rare and improbable guest appearance on stage in 2005 by their first guitarist from the 1960s, Top Topham. Since the release of Birdland, Mayo was replaced briefly by Jerry Donahue, and subsequently in 2005 by the then 20-year-old Ben King, while Glen has been replaced by Billy Boy Miskimmin from Nine Below Zero fame. In 2007 the Yardbirds released a live CD, recorded on 19 July 2006, entitled Live at B.B. King Blues Club (Favored Nations), featuring the McCarty, Dreja, Idan, King and Miskimmin line-up. The first episode of the 2007/08 season for The Simpsons featured the Yardbirds' \\"I'm A Man\\" from the CD Live at B.B. King Blues Club (Favored Nations). According to his website, Idan resigned from the Yardbirds in August 2008, although his last gig with them was on Friday 24 April 2009, when they headlined the first concert in the new Live Room venue at Twickenham rugby stadium. This was also Glen's last gig with the band after temporarily standing in when Miskimmin was unavailable. Idan and Glen were replaced by Andy Mitchell (lead vocals, harmonica, acoustic guitar) and David Smale (bass, backing vocals), brother of the virtuoso guitarist Jonathan Smale. Dreja sat out the US spring 2012 tour to recover from an illness. It was announced in 2013 that he was leaving the band for medical reasons and would be replaced by original Yardbirds guitarist Topham. McCarty announced in December 2014 that the current lineup of the Yardbirds had disbanded. He told fans in an email that he would be \\"working on solo ventures and other Yardbirds projects in 2015.” This has been proven to be untrue as the Yardbirds are on tour as of 2015. In May 2015 Topham left the band and was replaced by Earl Slick, though Slick never played a gig with the band. In August 2015, it was announced they would play the Eel Pie Club in Twickenham, west London on 17 October with a line-up of Jim McCarty, John Idan, Ben King, David Smale and Billyboy Miskimmin. On 12 August 2015, it was announced that Boston-based guitarist Johnny A. would become the newest member of the Yardbirds for their North American tour running from 30 October to 22 November 2015. Johnny A. continued to tour as The Yardbirds lead guitarist throughout 2016, 2017 and 2018 performing a total of 110 shows before departing. Johnny A.'s last show with The Yardbirds was on 23 June 2018 at The Egyptian Theater, Park City, Utah. Former Ram Jam harmonica player Myke Scavone joined the band at the end of 2015. On 15 April 2016, the band played at the Under the Bridge venue in London with a line-up of Jim McCarty, John Idan, Johnny A, Kenny Aaronson, and Billyboy Miskimmin. Godfrey Townsend replaces Johnny A in July 2018. Townsend had previously toured with John Entwistle, Alan Parsons and as musical director the past 10 years with the Happy Together tours. Musical style Along with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, The Yardbirds were part of the British blues scene of the 1960s. As the blues rock genre developed, some acts like Chicken Shack were playing a louder and more aggressive style, while the Yardbirds emphasized instrumental textures and extended instrumental improvisations. They covered blues classics like Howlin' Wolf's Smokestack Lightning (1956) and Bo Diddley's I'm a Man (1955) which had a repetitive structure where instrumental solos were brief breaks between repetition of verses. The Yardbirds often extended these instrumental sections into \\"heavy jams\\".

In 2010, he won a Classical Brit in the young British classical performer category. He was soloist on the score for the 2011 film Jane Eyre, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga and also on the Oscar, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominated soundtrack for Anna Karenina (2012). Both scores were composed by Dario Marianelli. He records exclusively for Hyperion Records. “His playing is virtually flawless in its technical ease, scintillating articulateness and purity of tone.” (Gramophone)  Biography  Possessing flawless technical mastery and a “beguiling silvery tone” (BBC Music Magazine), violinist Jack Liebeck's playing embraces the worlds of elegant chamber-chic Mozart through to the impassioned mastery required to frame Brett Dean The Lost Art of Letter Writing. Liebeck's fascination with all things scientific has included performing the world premiere of Dario Marianelli Voyager Violin Concerto and collaborations with Professor Brian Cox; he programmes his own annual festival Oxford May Music around the themes of music, science and the arts. A professional photographer, he loves film and can be heard in the soundtracks of The Theory of Everything, Jane Eyre and Anna Karenina. Liebeck is a dedicated educator holding a professorship at the Royal Academy of Music – tips include “sing your way to string perfection” (The Strad). He is also a member of Trio Dali “virtuosic brio… this is a group to watch” (The Australian). A renowned soloist and chamber musician, Liebeck has performed with all the major British orchestras under conductors such as Andrew Litton, Leonard Slatkin, Karl-Heinz Steffens, Sir Mark Elder, and further afield with Royal Stockholm Philharmonic (under Sakari Oramo), Swedish Radio (Daniel Harding), Oslo Philharmonic (Jukka Pekka Saraste), Belgian National, Polish Radio Symphony, Queensland Symphony, Moscow State Symphony, St Louis Symphony (David Robertson), Indianapolis Symphony (Douglas Boyd), and Melbourne Symphony (Jakub Hrůša) among many others. Collaborators throughout his career include artists such as Renaud Capuçon and Gautier Capuçon, Angela Hewitt, Jean-Yves Thibaudet, Piers Lane, Julius Drake, Bengt Forsberg, Michael Collins, Ashley Wass and Katya Apekisheva. Liebeck released his debut album, Works for Violin & Piano with Katya Apekisheva, in 2002 on Quartz to critical acclaim (Telegraph CD of the Week and nominated for a Classical Brit Award). His next two recordings were for Sony Classics. Dvorak, won Liebeck the 2010 Classical Brit Award – Young Artist of the Year and his Brahms Violin Sonatas with pianist Katya Apekisheva was received with critical acclaim. “His tone is sweet and effortlessly expressive, his lyrical spans marked by many a tastefully judged portamento.” (Strad Magazine) In 2014, Liebeck began his recording relationship with Hyperion Records with releases of Kreisler Violin Music with pianist Katya Apekisheva. His Bruch concerto series with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and Martyn Brabbins has received wide critical acclaim “delightful mix of charm and bucolic spirit through Liebeck’s remarkable artistry and imagination” (The Telegraph) while his last in the series, Violin Concerto No 2, was released in early 2017. Liebeck plays the ‘Ex-Wilhelmj’ J.B. Guadagnini dated 1785 and is generously loaned a Joseph Henry bow by Kathron Sturrock in the memory of her late husband, Professor David Bennett.

History The Print Council of America was founded in 1956 and was led by legendary print collector Lessing J. Rosenwald. Early members of the group—including Adelyn Breeskin, Harold Joachim, Una Johnson, A. Hyatt Mayor, Elizabeth Mongan, Jakob Rosenberg, Paul J. Sachs, Carl Schniewind and Carl Zigrosser are now known for their leadership in establishing collections, mounting ground-breaking exhibitions of prints, and publishing critical studies of prints and printmakers. The group's leadership has been called \\"the cream of the cognoscenti\\" among print experts. Defining the original print Early in its history, the Print Council of America was focused on advocacy and raising the visibility of printmaking as a fine art medium. The 1961 publication What is an Original Print?: Principles Recommended by the Print Council of America offered guidelines to the complex topic of originality and printmaking during that era. Initially, these efforts at a standard definition were controversial among some print experts, and even provoked \\"anger\\" from another organization, the World Print Council. Over the years, the definition became more \\"widely accepted\\". Description of papers used in fine prints The Print Council of America has published many books. One notable example is The Print Council of America Paper Sample Book: A Practical Guide to the Description of Paper. This book provides a \\"standardized method of describing paper\\" that has \\"proved to be an objective system for describing paper\\". Current activities and services Currently, the Print Council of America serves as a professional organization for print curators and has been active in the publication of books and research aids to encourage and professionalize the study and care of prints. Their primary vehicle is the Search Index to Print Catalogues Raisonnes, a free service which directs scholars and students to the oeuvre catalogues of thousands of artists. This search index has been called \\"a very useful source for identifying print catalogues raisonnés\\". The Print Council of America also offers resources to aid in learning about printmaking techniques, authenticity, the care of prints, defining a print, and determining the value of a print. In addition, the council offers links to the collections of major art libraries in the United States and Canada, and a selection of books published by the Print Council of America.

Howard's sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. It was first published in paperback by Tor Books in April 1994. Plot Conan, under his piratical alias of Amra, continues in developing a pirate empire in the Vilayet Sea. Operating from the rebuilt city of Djafur, located on one of the islands in the Aetolian Archipelago, Conan tricks the Turanian Empire of King Yildiz into a war against the Hyrkanians. Joining forces with a necromancer, Crotalis, Conan and his pirates participate in looting the lost city of Sarpedon. However, Crotalis betrays the pirates, forcing Conan to run his vessel ashore, where he's captured by a tribe of Hyrkanian nomads. Fortunately, Conan is released after he proves his value as a warrior. In return for his release, Conan agrees to support the Hyrkanians in their naval invasion of Turan. Crotalis also offers his services to the Hyrkanians, leading to another rogues' alliance with Conan. Using a magical wind summoned by Crotalis, the Hyrkanian fleet moves to attack the Turanians. After their lengthy nautical battle ends in a stalemate, Crotalis re-animates the corpses of all the pirates' former victims, forcing Conan into battle with an undead army. Suddenly, before Crotalis could claim his final victory, he is burned alive. Soon, the battle leaves the navies of both kingdoms in a weakened state, and Conan's Red Brotherhood becomes the strongest fleet in the Vilayet Sea. Reception Reviewer Bob Byrne writes \\"Overall, I thought it was an okay book. One I didn’t mind reading but not one I expect to read again.\\" He feels the story \\"largely consists of two parts: an extended undersea excavation and a big naval battle. Everything else is pretty much filler. There’s not a whole lot to this novel, and if you don’t buy into the 'Conan as king of a pirate city' thing, you aren't going to put this in the keeper pile.\\" The climactic battle he considers \\"interesting, though I thought that the end of it was a bit weak.\\" In regard to the writing he feels \\"some of Carpenter’s description evinces a nice writing style, such as scenes where the ships are at sea. Other parts, however, do not.\\" Citing dialog between Conan and his mistress, he notes \\"I might have thought that clever as a teenager, but I’m not sure even then.\\" He rates the book \\"pretty tame on the Conan sex scale, with the wenches who get angry at him always falling back into his arms,\\" and regards Conan as \\"awfully forgiving to someone who betrays him, costing him a fortune and leaving [him] to escape a near certain death.\\" His conclusion: \\"If you like Conan as a reaver/corsair/pirate instead of a land- based barbarian, you should probably give this one a read.\\" Don D'Ammassa writes \\"I generally enjoy pirate stories but there was not a lot of that despite the title. There's a pretty good sea battle and some other effective scenes, but the ending feels rushed.\\"D'Ammassa, Don. \\"Conan, Scourge of the Bloody Coast\\" (review on Critical Mass). Aug. 16, 2017.

Only Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik Party is resolute in calling for peace. In the front, the soldiers of one battalion elect three delegates to travel to St. Petersburg with donations the troops collected for the Pravda newspaper: Gudushauri, Panasiuk and Ershov. The three arrive in the capital and describe the horrendous conditions in which the soldiers live to Joseph Stalin, Lenin's trusted aide and colleague. They join the Bolsheviks and take part in the storming of the Winter Palace, led by Stalin and Lenin. Stalin announces that the great dawn of revolution has broken.

New York Times' critic interpreted its distribution there as being influenced by the signing of the Ribbentrop- Molotov Pact, writing: \\"conforming with the pact and the new party line, Soviet filmmakers now tell the world that the Russian and the German comrades would have reconciled back in 1917 if it hadn't been for the Anglo-French \\"imperialists\\"...

The Federal style brick plantation house incorporates elements of Georgian architecture. The house is now closely associated with American oilman and diplomat George C. McGhee, who owned the property after 1948. The house is maintained by the McGhee Foundation and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Lane, a member of the Virginia General Assembly in 1792-1793, was a colonel in the U.S. Army during the Whiskey Rebellion, and had been a member of the Continental Army during the American Revolution. Lane and his wife Katharine had eight children. The family operated their property as a plantation, using slave labor, and named it \\"Farmer's Delight.\\" Although Lane died in 1803, the plantation stayed in the Lane family until 1856, when it was sold to the Leith family. At this time it was known as the Gregg Farm, after Lane descendant Emily Craig Gregg, who had inherited the property. The Leiths held the property until 1919, lending their name to the nearby community of Leithtown, when the property was sold to Henry W. Frost, Jr., who renamed the farm \\"Frostfields,\\" expanded the house and operated racing and hunting stables. In 1948 the house was bought by diplomat George C. McGhee, who restored its original name and renovated the house, adding wings and gardens. McGhee obtained a set of stone columns for a trellised grape arbor from a Benedictine abbey at Samaron in France that were originally brought to the United States by William Randolph Hearst to be used at the Hearst Castle in San Simeon, California. The house was the scene of receptions for foreign dignitaries and American politicians, including President Lyndon B. Johnson. Description The original house is about by in two stories with five bays, with two-story additions to the north of three bays and two bays to the south. Another large wing extends to the southwest, with an additional wing to the west beyond. The original brickwork and north wing are in Flemish bond, while other wings are American bond. The original plan is a center hall with a room to each side, with a steep, narrow stairway in the center hall. The house is claimed to closely resemble the George Wythe House in Williamsburg, Virginia. It is one of the earliest examples of brick construction in Loudoun County. The property includes fifteen buildings on about . Gardens cover . The McGhee Library is housed in a structure reputed to be the oldest on the property, built about 1750. The bank barn-like structure was first used as a children's playroom, then converted to a library. A garage, built by the McGhees, houses an archive and research facility. Other structures include seven barns and agricultural buildings, two of which have been made into museums for McGhee's collections of artifacts from Africa, South America, the Middle East, southern Asia and the Pacific. A tenant house, built between 1880 and 1920, remains a residence for the farm supervisor. A small log cabin was relocated from its original location near The Plains. A small stone chapel is a replica of a chapel that the McGhees had admired in Bonn while McGhee was ambassador to West Germany. McGhee altered the grounds extensively to resemble an informal English garden, primarily using conifers, with 162 trees of 122 species. Four terraces were designed for the garden by Washington landscape architect Boris Timochenko, of which three were built. The garden includes a boxwood maze. The front of the property is landscaped as an open, informal English park. Farmer's Delight was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 2, 1973. The property is administered by the McGhee Foundation and is used for private and public events.

Then through 2016. According to this reference, a single propellant grain weighing 68 to 70 pounds was used in the original AFRL BATES motor design. An AFRL BATES propellant grain is inhibited, usually by a flame resistant cartridge case, on the OD, burning only on the two outer ends and the central bore, and is dimensioned so the burning area does not change significantly (< 3% in the original BATES motor) through the burn, generating a flat-topped thrust curve (neutral burn) to minimize propellant characterization costs and simplify the data analysis. The first official description of the BATES system was published by and available from the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC): “Development and Evaluation of the USAF Ballistic Test Evaluation System for Solid Rocket Propellants”. An official press release in 1964 included BATES information.https://youtube.com/watch?v=mdEClVceMO4 In 2016 the AIR FORCE published through DTIC an overview the included a summary of BATES use.http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/1034359.pdf In modern usage, BATES often refers to a type of solid-fuel rocket motor grain geometry. A BATES grain consists of two or more cylindrical grain segments with the outer surface inhibited, but free to burn both on the segment ends and the cylindrical core. Such grains can be configured to achieve a desired thrust- time profile while maintaining an acceptable center of gravity.

Eighteen- year-old former student Sebastian Bosse shot and wounded five people and set off several smoke bombs before committing suicide. Even though there were no fatalities besides that of the gunman, the shooting was at one point considered to be the worst school shooting in the history of Germany since the Erfurt massacre, in which 17 people, including the perpetrator, were killed. This position is now held by the 2009 Winnenden school shooting, which left 16 people dead, including the perpetrator. Details =Shooting= On 20 November 2006, at approximately 9:20 a.m. local time, Bosse drove to the Geschwister Scholl-Schule and strode into the schoolyard with his weapons, wearing a long black trench coat and a black gas mask.\\"German School Shooting: Armed to the Teeth and Crying for Help\\" On the way, he started firing randomly and wounded the school janitor, who was seriously injured by a shot in the stomach. A female teacher who was following the janitor was also injured when Bosse threw a smoke bomb, which hit her in the face. Around ten minutes after the shooting started, police were informed of the incident. Bosse entered the school building, firing several more shots and wounding four students. He also lit several smoke bombs, filling the building up with smoke. At 9:34 a.m., police arrived, but found entry into the school extremely difficult. At 9:58 a.m., a special task force finally breached the school and searched the building, discovering the body of Bosse on the second floor at 10:36 a.m., 38 minutes after entry. Bosse had shot himself in the mouth, although it was initially unclear if he had shot himself or was killed by the detonation of an explosive device that was attached to his body. Explosive experts had to be brought in to defuse the explosives found strapped to his body, as well as additional explosives found around the school.\\"Ex-Pupil Wounds 11 in German School Shooting: 'I Loathe People'\\" =Victims= Bosse was the only fatality in the shooting, while a total of 22 people were injured. Four students (three boys and one girl aged between 12 and 16 years) and the school janitor all suffered gunshot wounds, which were aimed towards the chest, stomach, arm, knee, and hand. A pregnant female teacher\\"German School Shooting: Armed to the Teeth and Crying for Help\\" also suffered facial injuries when she was hit by a thrown smoke bomb. In addition, 16 police officers had to be treated for respiratory problems due to smoke inhalation, while 15 students suffered from shock.\\"Ex-Pupil Wounds 11 in German School Shooting: 'I Loathe People'\\" =Weapons= During the attack, Bosse was armed with a Burgo .22 caliber bolt-action air rifle, an Ardesa percussion rifle, a pistol, and an Ardesa \\"Patriot\\" caplock pistol.Spiegel.de - Die Waffen des Sebastian B.\\"German School Shooting: Armed to the Teeth and Crying for Help\\" The barrels and stocks of the two rifles were sawed off. In addition, three smoke bombs and a knife were found on Bosse's body, ten additional smoke bombs and an incendiary bomb in his backpack, and four pipe bombs planted around the school.\\"German School Shooting: Armed to the Teeth and Crying for Help\\"\\"Ex-Pupil Wounds 11 in German School Shooting: 'I Loathe People'\\" A search in his car recovered four more smoke bombs, three incendiary bombs, and a machete. A search in his parents' house recovered a gas gun, an airsoft weapon, an air rifle, and various chemicals. Bosse purchased the percussion rifle from an online weapons dealer.Spiegel online, 20. November 2006 Amokläufer tötete sich mit Schuss in den Mund The dealer confirmed that Bosse had participated in three online auctions during the two months prior to the attack; all three auctions sold weapons. However, the auctions only sold weapons to people aged over 18 years. Attorney Wolfgang Schweer confirmed to the WDR that no investigation was launched against the auctions. The bolt-action rifle that Bosse was armed with during the attack had been purchased by him from a 24-year-old male relative in exchange for an airsoft gun; the man was not aware of Bosse's true intent. Perpetrator Sebastian Bosse\\"German School Shooting: Armed to the Teeth and Crying for Help\\" (29 April 1988 – 20 November 2006) had graduated from the Geschwister Scholl-Schule in 2006. He was generally known by others as \\"Bastian\\".\\"German School Shooting: Armed to the Teeth and Crying for Help\\" According to the public prosecutor's office, the motive for the attack was \\"general life frustration\\".Der Tagesspiegel, 21. November 2006, S. 1 While attending the school, he had social problems with classmates and was forced to repeat two classes.Spiegel online, 20. November 2006 Video-Vermächtnis mit Waffe, Mantel, Kampfstiefeln He was also known by others to listen to death metal music, wearing all-black or camouflage clothing, and having an affinity for firearms. He reportedly went on hunting trips with his father, a postman.\\"German School Shooting: Armed to the Teeth and Crying for Help\\" It was stated from his diary, police investigations, and statements from his classmates out that he was bullied. An investigation later turned up a suicide note written by him, which stated that he wanted \\"to be happy ever again\\" and that he couldn't stand everyday restrictions on his freedom. The note said, > \\"Ich habe in den 18 Jahren meines Lebens erfahren müssen, das man nur > Glücklich werden kann, wenn man sich der Masse fügt, der Gesellschaft > anpasst. Aber das konnte und wollte ich nicht. Ich bin frei! Niemand darf in > mein Leben eingreifen, und tut er es doch hat er die Konsequenzen zu tragen! > Kein Politiker hat das Recht Gesetze zu erlassen, die mir Dinge verbieten, > Kein Bulle hat das Recht mir meine Waffe wegzunehmen, schon gar nicht > während er seine am Gürtel trägt.\\" > \\"I had to learn in the 18 years of my life, that one can only be happy when > you blend in, adapt to the society.

No politician has the right to legislate, which prohibit > me things, no cop has the right to take away my gun, and certainly not while > he's wearing one at his belt.\\" It also said, > \\"Ich hasse euch und eure Art!

Nun müsst ihr dafür bezahlen! > [...] Als letztes möchte ich den Menschen die mir was bedeuten, oder die > jemals gut zu mir waren, danken, und mich für all dies Entschuldigen!

[...] Finally, > I want to apologise for all this to the people who mean something to me or > who were ever good to me! I'm gone ...\\" Two-and-a-half years prior to the attack, Bosse had announced his intents on an Internet forum and asked for psychological help.Münstersche Zeitung v. 21. November 2006 He also posted pictures and videos from Airsoftspielen, as well as bomb-making videos, on a personal website.vgl. TELEPOLIS \\"Ich will R.A.C.H.E\\"\\" Additional photos on the website showed Bosse with a variety of weapons, including a submachine gun, in public. On Sunday evening before the attack, Bosse posted four videos on his website, in which he and another person operated with weapons and explosives.Spiegel online, 20. November 2006 Video-Vermächtnis mit Waffe, Mantel, Kampfstiefeln\\"Ex-Pupil Wounds 11 in German School Shooting: 'I Loathe People'\\" The site was closed immediately after the attack by the North Rhine-Westphalia police, but its contents were copied in response to the closing, being placed on a number of other websites. Bosse had planned the attack extensively, according to contents of his diary.Stern.de - Das Tagebuch von Bastian B. The district court Rheine revealed that Bosse had gone into an open-air event with a gas gun in his possession; he had been drinking alcoholic beverages. Police were alerted to the incident and seized his gas gun. Although Bosse had an insufficient gun license, this didn't bar him from holding such weapons at public events.Westdeutscher Rundfunk, Frank Menke: Wie kam der Amokläufer an die Waffen? It was also reported that he was due in court prior to the shooting, on charges of illegal possession of a Walther P38 pistol.\\"German School Shooting: Armed to the Teeth and Crying for Help\\" Shortly before the attack, Bosse had left an Internet posting and a video message from his parents' living room. He had stated that he hated people and was taught to be a \\"loser\\" at his school.Former student dead after storming German school, CTV.ca. 18-jähriger Amokläufer verteilte Bomben im Schulgebäude (\\"18-year old madman distributed bombs in school building\\"), Spiegel Online. He also left a suicide note on his website, which has since been deleted.Amoklauf in Schule in Emsdetten (\\"Madman in School in Emsdetten\\"), de.indymedia.org. Aftermath The event caused renewed demands for a prohibition of violent video games (called \\"Killerspiele\\", \\"killing games\\", by the German media and politicians) in Germany, since police determined that Bosse \\"spent most of his waking hours\\" playing a violent video game called Counter-Strike.9> Starting in mid-2008, computer games released with a much larger USK rating label, complying with a change made to Article 12 of the JuSchG. The labels themselves were subsequently re-designed in 2009 following heavy criticism from customers.
