They are most commonly used for extended periods away from home, such as for boarding school, or long trips abroad. Trunks are differentiated from chests by their more rugged construction due to their intended use as luggage, instead of the latter's pure storage. Among the many styles of trunks there are Jenny Lind, Saratoga, monitor, steamer or Cabin, barrel-staves, octagon or bevel-top, wardrobe, dome-top, barrel-top, wall trunks, and even full dresser trunks. These differing styles often only lasted for a decade or two as well, and‚Äîalong with the hardware‚Äîcan be extremely helpful in dating an unmarked trunk. History and construction Although trunks have been around for thousands of years in China and elsewhere, the most common styles seen and referred to today date from the late 18th century to the early 20th century, when they were supplanted in the market by the cost-effective and lighter suitcase. Trunks were generally constructed with a base trunk box made of pine which was then covered with protective and decorative materials. Some of the earliest trunks are covered with studded hide or leather and look much like the furniture of the same period (which makes sense as trunk manufacturing was sometimes an offshoot of a furniture business.) Later coverings include paper, canvas, plain or embossed tin, with an uncounted assortment of hardware and hardwood slats to keep it all down. They sometimes were made with a small brass handle on top and were made in many sizes. The use of classic trunks for luggage was widespread through the first two decades of the twentieth century but began to fade in popularity thereafter in favor of the modern suitcase. By the end of the 1940s their use had become rare and in modern times is almost unknown. Famous companies There were hundreds of trunk manufacturers in the United States and a few of the larger and well known companies were Rhino Trunk & Case, C.A. Taylor, Haskell Brothers, Martin Maier, Romadka Bros., Goldsmith & Son, Crouch & Fitzgerald, M. M. Secor, Winship, Hartmann, Belber, Oshkosh, Seward, and Leatheroid. One of the largest American manufacturers of trunks at one point ‚Äî Seward Trunk Co. of Petersburg, Virginia ‚Äî still makes them for school and camp, and another company ‚Äî Shwayder Trunk Company of Denver, Colorado ‚Äî would eventually become Samsonite. Another is the English luxury goods manufacturer H.J. Cave trading since 1839. Their Osilite trunk was used by such famous customers as T.E. Lawrence and Ruth Vincent Some of the better known French trunk makers were Louis Vuitton, Goyard, Moynat, and Au D√©part. Only a few remain with the most prominent US company being Rhino Trunk and Case, Inc. They probably manufacture more trunks than any company in the world. Styles and manufacturers The easiest way for the casual observer to date any trunk is still by examining its style, so a short description of each aforementioned major variety follows. Jenny Lind trunks have a distinctive hour glass or keyhole shape when viewed from the side. They were named after the Swedish singer of the same name who toured America in 1850 - 1852 along with PT Barnum. Saratoga trunks were the premium trunks of many makers (or the exclusive design of many premium trunk makers) and actually can encompass nearly every other style of trunk manufactured if loosely defined, although generally they are limited to before the 1880s. The most readily recognizable feature of Saratogas are their myriad (and generally very complex) compartments, trays, and heavy duty hardware. Monitor-tops (incorrectly known as water-fall trunks from the furniture) date from the late 1870s to the late 1910s, and are characterized by their rounded front and rear corners to form a lying-down \\"D\\" when viewed from the side. Earlier examples usually included labor-intensive hardwood slats that were curved with the top, while there was a revival much later with rarer, all-metal ones being constructed. A steamer trunk dating from the late 1890s to early 1900s. Steamer trunks (named after their location of storage in the cabin of a steam ship, or \\"steamer\\") which are sometimes referred to as flat-tops, first appeared in the late 1870s, although the greater bulk of them date from the 1880‚Äì1920 period. They are distinguished by either their flat or slightly curved tops and were usually covered in canvas, leather or patterned paper and about tall to accommodate steamship luggage regulations. There has been much debate and discourse on what these types of trunks are actually called. In some old catalogs, these trunks were called \\"packers\\", and the \\"steamer\\" trunk actually referred to a trunk that is often called a cabin trunk. An orthodox name for this type of trunk would be a \\"packer\\" trunk, but since it has been widely called a steamer for so long, it is now a hallmark of this style. A low-profile cabin trunk from the early 1900s Cabin trunks, which are sometimes called \\"true\\" steamer trunks, were the equivalent of today's carry-on luggage. They were low-profiled and small enough to fit under the berths of trains or in the cabin of a steamer, hence their name. Most were built with flat tops and had inner tray compartments to store the owner's valuables deemed too precious to keep stowed away in the baggage (luggage) car or ship's hold. A hat trunk (box) dating from the 1890s, with \\"cube-shaped\\" construction Hat trunks were square shaped trunks that were popular in the 1860s to the 1890s. Today, they are mostly called \\"half-trunks\\". They were smaller and easier to carry, and could hold up to six hats or bonnets. Most were flat tops, but some had domed lids (which were very elegant). This trunk style was popular with Victorian women, hence antique trunk labels often calling this type a \\"ladies' trunk\\". Hat trunks generally sell for more than any other average trunk style because they are smaller and are rather rare to find. An example of a barrel- stave trunk Barrel-staves are sometimes referred to as a form of dome-top trunk, but generally date from a decade or more earlier and are notable for having horizontal slats instead of vertical, giving it a distinctive look and construction. These were generally made from the late 1870s to the mid-1880s. Bevel-tops are separated into an early and a late (or revival) period, the former generally dating from the 1870‚Äì1880 period, and the latter from 1890 to 1900. They are characterized by a distinct trapezoidal shape when viewed from the side, although the earlier period tended to have a much shorter flattened top section than the later did. These tend to be extremely rare, although are not as popular or sought-after as many of the other varieties. Wardrobe trunks generally must be stood on end to be opened and have drawers on one side and hangers for clothes on the other. Many of the better wardrobe lines also included buckles/tie-downs for shoes, removable suitcases/briefcases, privacy curtains, mirrors, make-up boxes, and just about anything else imaginable. These are normally very large and heavy as they were used for extended travel by ship or train. Rhino Trunk and Case, Inc. still manufactures many styles of wardrobe trunks at their Rochester, NY facility. Two examples of dome-top trunks: one is a vertical slat trunk, the other is a barrel-stave trunk A dome-top trunk has a high, curved top that can rise up to heights of . A variety of construction methods‚Äîincluding cuffing, molded ply, barrel construction, and so forth‚Äîwere used to form the inner boxes. Included in this classification are camel-backs, which are distinguished by having a central, vertically running top slat that is higher than its fellows, hunch-backs or hump-backs which is the same but has no slat in the center of the top, and barrel-tops (not to be confused with barrel staves), which have high arching slats that are all the same height, a distinction that can be discerned by laying a ruler flat across the tops of the slats. These trunks date from 1870s-1900s, although there are a few shops still manufacturing them today. They are not only the most common trunks referred to as antique, but also are among the most popular. Wall trunks are made with a special hinges so that when opened the trunk could still be put flat up against a wall. The two main manufacturers include Clinton and Miller, which can be easily noted by the name on the hinges. In good condition these are comparatively sought-after trunks for a specialty type, although are in the middling range when it comes to price. A Homer Young dresser (theatrical) trunk Dresser trunks also known as pyramidal trunks, due to their shape, are a unique form of wall-trunk that generally date from the 1900‚Äì1910 era. They are characterized by a lid that opens up nearly the entire front half of the trunk, allowing it to rest on the bottom. Two prominent manufacturers of this trunk style were F. A. Stallman and Homer Young & Co. Oak-slat trunks incorporating many construction-styles (e.g. dome-top, flat-top, beveled-top) were built on a wooden frame, where the malletier would fit thin oak slats vertically side-by-side until the entire trunk was covered. To a Victorian, this would show the complexity of the trunk and astuteness of the malletier, and was an indication of wealth to any purchaser. Oak-slat trunks were built by several companies, including the Excelsior Company, MM (Martin Maier) Company, Clinton Wall Trunk Manufactory, and El Paso Slat Trunk Company. Some oak-slat trunks were made with alternating colors on the vertical slats. Footlockers are trunk-like pieces of luggage used in military contexts. Generally these are designed for economy, ruggedness, and ease of transport rather than aesthetic qualities. During the steamer trunk restoration process when the inside paper covering is removed, dated notes in lead pencil made by the original craftsman may be found, as well as the circular saw blade impressions made on the rough-cut wood at the saw mill, both of which give added character and value to the restored trunk. Types of tray compartments There were numerous tray and lid compartments in Victorian trunks, ranging from basic to complex. A basic tray system comprised a hat box, a shirt compartment, a coin box, and a document box. A complex tray system, however, could consist two hat boxes, several other shirt compartments, a coin box, several document boxes and even secret compartments strategically placed so that people of unwanted access would pass up if not wary. Beautiful lithographs would be placed over the lids or dome of the trunk and truly capture the Victorian aesthetic of that day. There were numerous chromolithographs that a trunk maker could use, and they could be indicative of who the trunk was intended for, such as ladies or men. A bride's chest usually had a lot of floral pictures or lithographs of other ladies, while men's had pictures of \\"village\\" or country scenes. It was up to the malletier what to put on the lids and trays. See also *Chest (furniture) *Martin Maier, a trunk maker in Detroit (1865‚Äì1915) *M. M.

This kind of amplifier can enhance both the load capacity and switching speed. Push‚Äìpull outputs are present in TTL and CMOS digital logic circuits and in some types of amplifiers, and are usually realized as a complementary pair of transistors, one dissipating or sinking current from the load to ground or a negative power supply, and the other supplying or sourcing current to the load from a positive power supply. A push‚Äìpull amplifier is more efficient than a single-ended \\"class-A\\" amplifier. The output power that can be achieved is higher than the continuous dissipation rating of either transistor or tube used alone and increases the power available for a given supply voltage. Symmetrical construction of the two sides of the amplifier means that even- order harmonics are cancelled, which can reduce distortion.Joe Carr, RF Components and Circuits, Newnes, page 84 DC current is cancelled in the output, allowing a smaller output transformer to be used than in a single- ended amplifier. However, the push‚Äìpull amplifier requires a phase-splitting component that adds complexity and cost to the system; use of center-tapped transformers for input and output is a common technique but adds weight and restricts performance. If the two parts of the amplifier do not have identical characteristics, distortion can be introduced as the two halves of the input waveform are amplified unequally. Crossover distortion can be created near the zero point of each cycle as one device is cut off and the other device enters its active region. A vacuum tube amplifier often used a center-tapped output transformer to combine the outputs of tubes connected in push‚Äìpull. 6BQ5 output tubes per channel Push‚Äìpull circuits are widely used in many amplifier output stages. A pair of audion tubes connected in push‚Äìpull is described in Edwin H. Colpitts' US patent 1137384 granted in 1915, although the patent does not specifically claim the push‚Äìpull connection.Donald Monroe McNicol, Radios' Conquest of Space: The Experimental Rise in Radio Communication Taylor & Francis, 1946 page 348 The technique was well-known at that time http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?page=5&xmldoc;=193278360F2d723_1537.xml&docbase;=CSLWAR1-1950-1985&SizeDisp;=7 WESTERN ELECTRIC CO. v. WALLERSTEIN retrieved 12/12/12 and the principle had been claimed in an 1895 patent predating electronic amplifiers.US Patent 549,477 Local Transmitter Circuit for Telephones., W. W. Dean Possibly the first commercial product using a push‚Äìpull amplifier was the RCA Balanced amplifier released in 1924 for use with their Radiola III regenerative broadcast receiver.Radios - RCA Radiola Balanced Amplifier 1924 By using a pair of low-power vacuum tubes in push‚Äìpull configuration, the amplifier allowed the use of a loudspeaker instead of headphones, while providing acceptable battery life with low standby power consumption.Gregory Malanowski The Race for Wireless: How Radio Was Invented (or Discovered?), AuthorHouse, 2011 pages 66-67, page 144 The technique continues to be used in audio, radio frequency, digital and power electronics systems today.  Digital circuits  The TTL output stage is a rather complicated push‚Äìpull circuit known as a 'totem pole output' (the transistors, diode, and resistor in the right-most slice of this TTL logic gate circuit). It sinks currents better than it sources current. A digital use of a push‚Äìpull configuration is the output of TTL and related families. The upper transistor is functioning as an active pull-up, in linear mode, while the lower transistor works digitally. For this reason they are not capable of supplying as much current as they can sink (typically 20 times less). Because of the way these circuits are drawn schematically, with two transistors stacked vertically, normally with a level shifting diode in between, they are called \\"totem pole\\" outputs. A disadvantage of simple push‚Äìpull outputs is that two or more of them cannot be connected together, because if one tried to pull while another tried to push, the transistors could be damaged. To avoid this restriction, some push‚Äìpull outputs have a third state in which both transistors are switched off. In this state, the output is said to be floating (or, to use a proprietary term, tri- stated). The alternative to a push‚Äìpull output is a single switch that connects the load either to ground (called an open collector or open drain output) or to the power supply (called an open-emitter or open-source output).  Analog circuits  A conventional amplifier stage which is not push‚Äìpull is sometimes called single-ended to distinguish it from a push‚Äìpull circuit. In analog push‚Äìpull power amplifiers the two output devices operate in antiphase (i.e. 180¬∞ apart). The two antiphase outputs are connected to the load in a way that causes the signal outputs to be added, but distortion components due to non-linearity in the output devices to be subtracted from each other; if the non-linearity of both output devices is similar, distortion is much reduced. Symmetrical push‚Äìpull circuits must cancel even order harmonics, like f2, f4, f6 and therefore promote odd order harmonics, like (f1), f3, f5 when driven into the nonlinear range. A push‚Äìpull amplifier produces less distortion than a single-ended one. This allows a class-A or AB push‚Äìpull amplifier to have less distortion for the same power as the same devices used in single-ended configuration. Class AB and class B dissipate less power for the same output than class A; distortion can be kept low by negative feedback and by biassing the output stage to reduce crossover distortion. A class - B push‚Äìpull amplifier is more efficient than a class-A power amplifier because each output device amplifies only half the output waveform and is cut off during the opposite half. It can be shown that the theoretical full power efficiency (AC power in load compared to DC power consumed) of a push‚Äìpull stage is approximately 78.5%. This compares with a class-A amplifier which has efficiency of 25% if directly driving the load and no more than 50% for a transformer coupled output.Maurice Yunik Design of Modern Transistor Circuits, Prentice-Hall 1973 pp. 340-353 A push‚Äìpull amplifier draws little power with zero signal, compared to a class-A amplifier that draws constant power. Power dissipation in the output devices is roughly one-fifth of the output power rating of the amplifier. A class-A amplifier, by contrast, must use a device capable of dissipating several times the output power. The output of the amplifier may be direct-coupled to the load, coupled by a transformer, or connected through a dc blocking capacitor. Where both positive and negative power supplies are used, the load can be returned to the midpoint (ground) of the power supplies. A transformer allows a single polarity power supply to be used, but limits the low-frequency response of the amplifier. Similarly, with a single power supply, a capacitor can be used to block the DC level at the output of the amplifier.Donald G. Fink, ed. Electronics Engineer's Handbook, McGraw Hill 1975 pp. 13-23 through 13-24 Where bipolar junction transistors are used, the bias network must compensate for the negative temperature coefficient of the transistors' base to emitter voltage. This can be done by including a small value resistor between emitter and output. Also, the driving circuit can have silicon diodes mounted in thermal contact with the output transistors to provide compensation. = Push‚Äìpull transistor output stages = Categories include:  Transformer-output transistor power amplifiers  It is now very rare to use output transformers with transistor amplifiers, although such amplifiers offer the best opportunity for matching the output devices (with only PNP or only NPN devices required).  Totem pole push‚Äìpull output stages  Two matched transistors of the same polarity can be arranged to supply opposite halves of each cycle without the need for an output transformer, although in doing so the driver circuit often is asymmetric and one transistor will be used in a common-emitter configuration while the other is used as an emitter follower. This arrangement is less used today than during the 1970's; it can be implemented with few transistors (not so important today) but is relatively difficult to balance and to keep a low distortion.  Symmetrical push‚Äìpull  Each half of the output pair \\"mirror\\" the other, in that an NPN (or N-Channel FET) device in one half will be matched by a PNP (or P-Channel FET) in the other. This type of arrangement tends to give lower distortion than quasi-symmetric stages because even harmonics are cancelled more effectively with greater symmetry.  Quasi- symmetrical push‚Äìpull  In the past when good quality PNP complements for high power NPN silicon transistors were limited, a workaround was to use identical NPN output devices, but fed from complementary PNP and NPN driver circuits in such a way that the combination was close to being symmetrical (but never as good as having symmetry throughout). Distortion due to mismatched gain on each half of the cycle could be a significant problem.  Super-symmetric output stages  Employing some duplication in the whole driver circuit, to allow symmetrical drive circuits can improve matching further, although driver asymmetry is a small fraction of the distortion generating process. Using a bridge-tied load arrangement allows a much greater degree of matching between positive and negative halves, compensating for the inevitable small differences between NPN and PNP devices.  Square-law push‚Äìpull  The output devices, usually MOSFETs or vacuum tubes, are configured so that their square-law transfer characteristics (that generate second-harmonic distortion if used in a single-ended circuit) cancel distortion to a large extent. That is, as one transistor's gate-source voltage increases, the drive to the other device is reduced by the same amount and the drain (or plate) current change in the second device approximately corrects for the non-linearity in the increase of the first. = Push‚Äìpull tube (valve) output stages = Vacuum tubes (valves) are not available in complementary types (as are pnp/npn transistors), so the tube push‚Äìpull amplifier has a pair of identical output tubes or groups of tubes with the control grids driven in antiphase. These tubes drive current through the two halves of the primary winding of a center-tapped output transformer. Signal currents add, while the distortion signals due to the non-linear characteristic curves of the tubes subtract. These amplifiers were first designed long before the development of solid-state electronic devices; they are still in use by both audiophiles and musicians who consider them to sound better. Vacuum tube push‚Äìpull amplifiers usually use an output transformer, although Output-transformerless (OTL) tube stages exist (such as the SEPP/SRPP and the White Cathode Follower below). The phase-splitter stage is usually another vacuum tube but a transformer with a center-tapped secondary winding was occasionally used in some designs. Because these are essentially square-law devices, the comments regarding distortion cancellation mentioned above apply to most push‚Äìpull tube designs when operated in class A (i.e. neither device is driven to its non-conducting state). A Single Ended Push‚ÄìPull (SEPP, SRPP or mu-follower) output stage, originally called the Series-Balanced amplifier (US patent 2,310,342, Feb 1943). is similar to a totem-pole arrangement for transistors in that two devices are in series between the power supply rails, but the input drive goes only to one of the devices, the bottom one of the pair; hence the (seemingly contradictory) Single-Ended description. The output is taken from the cathode of the top (not directly driven) device, which acts part way between a constant current source and a cathode follower but receiving some drive from the plate (anode) circuit of the bottom device. The drive to each tube therefore might not be equal, but the circuit tends to keep the current through the bottom device somewhat constant throughout the signal, increasing the power gain and reducing distortion compared with a true single-tube single-ended output stage. The White Cathode Follower (Patent 2,358,428, Sep 1944 by E. L. C. White) is similar to the SEPP design above, but the signal input is to the top tube, acting as a cathode follower, but one where the bottom tube (in common cathode configuration) if fed (usually via a step-up transformer) from the current in the plate (anode) of the top device. It essentially reverses the roles of the two devices in SEPP. The bottom tube acts part way between a constant current sink and an equal partner in the push‚Äìpull workload. Again, the drive to each tube therefore might not be equal. Transistor versions of the SEPP and White follower do exist, but are rare.  Ultra-linear push‚Äìpull  A so-called ultra-linear push‚Äìpull amplifier uses either pentodes or tetrodes with their screen grid fed from a percentage of the primary voltage on the output transformer. This gives efficiency and distortion that is a good compromise between triode (or triode- strapped) power amplifier circuits and conventional pentode or tetrode output circuits where the screen is fed from a relatively constant voltage source.

Wheat paste (also known as flour paste, or simply paste) is a gel or liquid adhesive made from wheat flour or starch and water. It has been used since antiquity for various arts and crafts such as book binding, d√©coupage, collage, papier-m√¢ch√©, and adhering paper posters and notices to walls. A critical difference among wheat pastes is the division between those made from flour and those made from starch. Vegetable flours contain both gluten and starch. Over time the gluten in a flour paste cross- links, making it very difficult to release the adhesive. Using only starch, a fine quality, fully reversible paste can be produced. The latter is the standard adhesive for paper conservation. Besides wheat, other vegetables also are processed into flours and starches from which pastes can be made: characteristics, such as strength and reversibility, vary with the plant species; manufacturer's processing; and the recipe of the end-user.  Uses  A common use is to make chains of paper rings made from colored construction paper. It can also be used to create papier-m√¢ch√©. In the fine arts, wheat starch paste is often used in preparation and presentation. A good wheat starch paste has a strength compatible with many paper artifacts, remains reversible over time, is neither too acidic or alkaline, and is white. Activists and various subculture proponents often use this adhesive to flypost propaganda and artwork. It has also commonly been used by commercial bill posters since the nineteenth century. In particular, it was widely used by nineteenth and twentieth century circus bill posters, who developed a substantial culture around paste manufacture and postering campaigns.The Circus Boys on the Plains, Project Gutenberg e-text, originally published 1911. In the field of alcohol and nightclub advertising, in the 1890s, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's posters were so popular that instructions were published on how to peel down the pasted posters without damage. Posters Weren't the Half of Him, New York Times Book Review, 16 January 2000, accessed July 2006. Until the 1970s, commercial poster hangers always \\"cooked\\" their own paste, but since then many have bought pre-cooked instant pastes.Ethical Considerations for the Conservation of Circus Posters, WAAC Newsletter, 17(2), May 1995, accessed July 2006 It is applied to the backside of paper then placed on flat surfaces, particularly concrete and metal as it does not adhere well to wood or plastic. Cheap, rough paper such as newsprint, works well, as it can be briefly dipped in the mixture to saturate the fibres. When hanging unauthorized billboards or signage, to reduce the danger of being caught, wheatpasters frequently work in teams or affinity groups. In the United States and Canada, this process is typically called \\"wheatpasting\\" or \\"poster bombing,\\" even when using commercial wallpaper paste instead of traditional wheat paste. In the United Kingdom, commercial wheatpasting is called flyposting and wheatpasting associated with urban art is called paste-up.

Life and career B√©nard was born in Henryville, Quebec, and was educated at the normal school in that community. He later moved to Manitoba, and worked as a financial agent. He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1907 provincial election, defeating Liberal incumbent Joseph H. Prefontaine by 339 votes. The Conservatives won this election, and B√©nard served in the legislature as a government backbencher. He was re-elected for Assiniboia in the 1910 election, and for Iberville in the 1914 campaign. Conservative premier Rodmond Roblin was forced to resign in 1915, amid a serious corruption scandal. Another election was called, which the Liberals won with a landslide majority. B√©nard was one of only five Tories returned to the legislature. His re-election was primarily due to the Conservative Party's continued popularity in francophone areas of the province. The Conservatives were more supportive of francophone education rights than the Liberals, and received support from this community; four of the party's five legislators were francophone. B√©nard was chosen as the Conservative Party's interim leader shortly after the election. The party chose another francophone, Albert Prefontaine, as its house leader in 1916. B√©nard was appointed to the Canadian Senate on September 3, 1917, on the recommendation of Prime Minister Robert Borden. He served in the Senate until his death.

In patients with sepsis, the vasopressor dosage may be titrated on the basis of estimated MAP.Calculating the mean arterial pressure (MAP) Nursing center2011-12-08 This is only valid at normal resting heart rates during which MAP can be approximated using the measured systolic (SP) and diastolic (DP) blood pressures:Cardiovascular Physiology (page 3) http://www.clinicalreview.com Physiology Review :MAP \\\\simeq DP + \\\\frac{1}{3}(SP - DP) or equivalently :MAP \\\\simeq \\\\frac{2}{3}(DP) + \\\\frac{1}{3}(SP) or equivalently :MAP \\\\simeq \\\\frac{(2 \\\\times DP) + SP}{3} or equivalently :MAP \\\\simeq DP + \\\\frac{1}{3}PP where PP is the pulse pressure, SP-DP At high heart rates MAP is more closely approximated by the arithmetic mean of systolic and diastolic pressures because of the change in shape of the arterial pressure pulse. For a generalized formula of MAP: : MAP \\\\simeq DP + 0.01 \\\\times \\\\exp(4.14 - 40.74 / HR) (SP - DP) Where HR is the heart rate. Clinical significance MAP is considered to be the perfusion pressure seen by organs in the body. It is believed that a MAP that is greater than 70 mmHg is enough to sustain the organs of the average person. MAP is normally between 65 and 110 mmHg.. Even 1 minute at a mean arterial pressure of 50 mmHg, or accumulative effects over short periods, increases the risk of mortality by 5% and can result in organ failure or complications Nicklas, J.Y., Beckmann, D., Killat, J. et al.

A Randomized Trial of Continuous Noninvasive Blood Pressure Monitoring During Noncardiac Surgery. Anesth Analg. 2018;127(2):424‚Äì431.. MAP may be used similarly to systolic blood pressure in monitoring and treating for target blood pressure. Both have been shown advantageous targets for sepsis, major trauma, stroke, intracranial bleed, and hypertensive emergencies. If the MAP falls below this number for an appreciable time, vital organs will not get enough oxygen perfusion, and will become hypoxic, a condition called ischemia.

She was scrapped in 1974. Service history Uhlmann was named after Ensign Robert W. Uhlmann and was laid down on 6 March 1943 at Staten Island, New York, by the Bethlehem Steel Co. and launched on 30 July 1943; sponsored by Mrs. C. F. Uhlmann, mother of Ens. Uhlmann. The ship was commissioned on 22 November 1943 at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, Commander Selden G. Hooper in command. =1944= After shakedown out of Bermuda and post-shakedown availability, the destroyer joined Destroyer Squadron 56 on 24 January 1944. Two days later, she got underway to escort to Trinidad. She then transited the Panama Canal, touched at San Diego, California, and arrived at San Francisco, California on 16 February. There, she embarked passengers for transportation to Hawaii and departed the west coast on 17 February in company with and . She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 23 February. During March, Uhlmann underwent availability, conducted training, and rendered occasional convoy screening services in Hawaiian waters. In April, she conducted carrier escort training exercises and honed her skills in shore bombardment and radar tracking in preparation for assignment to carrier screening duties. Two hours after sunset on 24 April, while Uhlmann was participating in training exercises in Hawaiian waters as an antisubmarine screening ship for the carriers of Task Group 19.2, she was struck amidships by destroyer . The collision tore an hole in Uhlmanns hull below the water line, flooding her firerooms and the forward engine room. The following day, she was taken in tow by and returned to Pearl Harbor on 26 April. After temporary hull and engine repairs, she set her course for San Francisco on 17 May, steaming on her port engine with her forward fire and engine rooms out of commission. On 24 May, she moored at Hunter's Point and, for the next two months, underwent extensive repairs. In August, she returned to Pearl Harbor and resumed training exercises including torpedo firing and antisubmarine warfare drills. After one false start, she departed Oahu on 18 September with and and set her course for the Admiralty Islands. En route to Manus, she was diverted to the western Caroline Islands and reported to 3d Fleet at Ulithi on 30 September. During a typhoon on 3 October, a nest of three destroyers drifted down on Uhlmann and pierced three holes in her starboard side. A few hours later, the destroyer made an emergency sortie from the lagoon with Task Group 38.2; but, by nightfall, high seas had carried away her emergency damage control measures and flooded the anchor windlass room. She returned to Ulithi on 4 October for repairs by and, on 6 October, was underway for an at-sea rendezvous with Task Force 38‚Äîthe 3d Fleet's Fast Carrier Force‚Äîthe following day. At noon on 9 October, the carriers began a high-speed approach to a launch position for strikes on the Ryukyus. On 10 October, planes launched by the carriers struck Okinawa, destroying enemy aircraft, shipping, and shore installations in preparation for the projected landings on Leyte, Cebu, and Negros. After fueling at sea on 11 October, TF 38 began a high-speed approach on Taiwan for two days of strikes on that island, again in support of the impending American assault on the Philippines. On 12 and 13 October, as the carriers steamed 85 miles (137 km) east of Taiwan and launched strike after strike against that island, Uhlmann operated in their antiaircraft screen. Planes from the carriers attempted to destroy Japanese air strength on Taiwan to eliminate that island as a staging base for the enemy. Shortly after dusk on 12 October, low flying Japanese bombers and torpedo planes approached Task Group 38.2 from the west and northwest. Although most of the Japanese planes were intercepted by the task force's combat air patrol, more than a dozen broke through and attacked the formation. Uhlmann opened fire on a Japanese medium torpedo bomber at . However, undeterred, the plane continued to approach the zigzagging destroyer from port until it was hit at close range by Uhlmanns 40-millimeter fire, crossed over the ship, and splashed off the destroyer's starboard bow. The plane sank at once leaving a large quantity of gas and oil floating on the sea. A second wave of attackers followed two minutes after the first, and Uhlmann, maneuvering with the formation, joined in the fire which downed some seven Japanese raiders during the night. At 2200, she hit an enemy plane which burst into flame and illuminated the moonless overcast night before splashing off the stern of the ship. Minutes before midnight, Uhlmann picked up another aerial intruder on radar and opened up with 5-inch fire. The plane countered by dropping flares as a diversionary tactic and pulled away, but Uhlmanns deadly fire found its mark as the raider burst into flame and splashed into the sea. The destroyers began laying smoke around midnight, and the raids tapered off. For the remainder of the night, Japanese planes merely approached within 6 to 7 miles (10 to 11 km), dropped flares, and retired without attacking the formation. Japanese planes again ventured near the formation late on 14 October only to be routed by night fliers of the combat air patrol. The next day, TF 38 began a high-speed run in for strikes on Luzon, with Uhlmann providing antisubmarine protection for the fast carriers of TG 38.2. On 16 and 17 October, the carriers launched heavy strikes on Luzon concentrating on ships and installations in the Manila Bay area. Late on 17 October, the formation set a southerly course to get into position for strikes farther south, with the fighter planes of the task force dispersing light Japanese air opposition en route. Steaming east and northeast of Samar, the task force made strikes on Negros on 20 October in strategic support of the landings on Leyte and also provided direct air support for those landings. Meanwhile, upon first sighting American minesweepers in the approaches to Leyte Gulf, Japan had sent her naval forces into Philippine waters. On 24 October, Uhlmann protected the carriers of Rear Admiral Gerald F. Bogan's TG 38.2 as they launched strikes against the Japanese Center Force which was approaching San Bernardino Strait. In an action known as the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, American naval aircraft sank Japanese battleship and damaged several other enemy warships. At 2022 that evening, Task Force 38 turned north to seek out and destroy the Japanese Northern Force whose carriers had been spotted north of Luzon where they had been stationed in the hope of luring the 3d Fleet away from the beaches of Leyte. However, a gallant group of American destroyers, destroyer escorts, and escort carriers had fought off the overwhelmingly superior Japanese Center Force and induced it to abandon its plan of attacking the amphibious ships which were supporting the Allied beachheads on Leyte. Thus, when TG 34.5 returned within aircraft range of San Bernardino Strait, the chastened Japanese Center Force had already retreated back through that strategic passage to safety. In the days that followed the historic Battle of Leyte Gulf, Uhlmann continued to screen TG 38.2 while its carriers conducted strikes on land targets, including raids on Luzon on 29 and 30 October. Shortly before noon on 29 October, as the carriers recovered aircraft from a strike against Japanese targets in the Manila area, Uhlmann left the formation to investigate what appeared to be the splash of a downed plane but was later determined to be a bomb splash. As the destroyer attempted to discover the cause of the splash, a Navy torpedo bomber from made a water landing nearby, and Uhlmann quickly rescued the pilot and two crewmen. Meanwhile, an enemy attack had materialized, and the destroyer went to general quarters, increased her speed to , and executed evasive maneuvers as she attempted to rejoin the formation. As she steamed to her assigned position, she joined in the general fire against the attackers‚Äî10 to 12 Japanese planes which made notably inaccurate high altitude bombing runs and retired after one or two of their members had been splashed by the American ships' accurate fire. On 4 November, TF 38.2 began a high-speed approach for strikes on Luzon. For two days, carrier-based aircraft pounded Luzon and Bicol. Then, on 7 November, Uhlmann set her course for Ulithi. En route, heavy seas caused flooding in the boatswain's stores and chain locker; and Uhlmann, accompanied by , left the formation and ran with the wind while damage-control measures were being effected. She arrived at Ulithi on 9 November, underwent repairs, and got underway again on 16 November. She rendezvoused with TG 38.2 the following day and took up an antisubmarine screening station. Following carrier strikes on Luzon on 19 November, Uhlmann returned to Ulithi on 22 November. The destroyer conducted exercises out of Ulithi until 10 December when she got underway and rendezvoused with Task Force 38 on 12 November. From 14‚Äì16 December, the carriers made strikes against air installations on Luzon and against shipping in water off that island to support landings on Mindoro. Toward dusk on 16 December, the task force began its retirement. As the American warships fueled northeast of Samar on 17 December, weather conditions worsened. At 1330, Uhlmann abandoned fueling from due to rough seas and winds stirred up by an approaching typhoon. On 18 December, Uhlmann recorded winds, and rolls up to 58 degrees as the typhoon's center passed within of the formation. During the afternoon, winds decreased; and, by 2000, they had subsided to . On 19 and 20 December, the ships of the battered task force resumed fueling which continued into the next day while its escorts searched for survivors of the three destroyers which had failed to survive the tropical storm. Late on 20 December, due to heavy seas, the carriers aborted a high- speed run in for strikes on Luzon; and Uhlmann returned to the storm area and searched for survivors. She made port at Ulithi on 24 December. =1945= Underway again with TG 38.1 on 30 December, she screened the carriers during strikes on Formosa and Luzon early in the new year and, an hour before midnight on 9 January 1945, transited Bashi Channel into the South China Sea. The carriers launched strikes on French Indochina, Taiwan, and Hong Kong before retiring from the South China Sea on 19 January. Steaming 75 miles (120 km) north of Luzon at dusk the next day, the formation came under attack by enemy aircraft, and Uhlmann joined other ships of the formation in repelling raiders. Following strikes on Formosa and Okinawa, TF 38 returned to Ulithi on 26 January. That day, the 3d Fleet was redesignated 5th Fleet and placed under the command of Admiral Raymond A. Spruance. Following antisubmarine training, Uhlmann got underway from Ulithi with TG 58.2 on 10 February. During a Japanese air raid on 16 February, the first of two days of strikes on the Tokyo area, Uhlmann took under fire an enemy fighter which made a low-glide, diving attack on the ship's port beam and dropped a bomb in the wake of destroyer . Neither destroyer suffered any damage in this exchange. On 19 February, Uhlmann screened TF 58 as it steamed north of Iwo Jima launching strikes on that island in support of the initial landings there. On 20 February, mechanical difficulties in her steering mechanism forced Uhlmann to part company with the task force, and she put in at Ulithi on 23 February for repairs. Underway on 14 March, she rendezvoused with TG 58.2 on 16 March. The next day, the carriers began a highspeed run in for strikes on Ky≈´sh≈´. While the planes of TP 58 pounded that Japanese homeland, Uhlmann protected the carriers from air and submarine attack. Air activity began early on 18 March; and Uhlmann, acting as linking vessel between TF 58 and its picket line, began firing on aerial snoopers before dawn. Shortly before 0700, she joined the picket line and, at 0956, rescued three Navy aviators from a torpedo bomber which had splashed nearby. Throughout the dav and into the night, alerts prompted by Japanese surveillance planes brought the ship's crew to general quarters. Four minutes before midnight, Uhlmann opened fire on an enemy aircraft at . The plane burst into flame and splashed off the destroyer's starboard quarter and burned brightly for several minutes. Air activity continued into the early hours of 19 March. Before dawn that day, Uhlmann joined in firing on a high-altitude Japanese raider which burst into flames and splashed. Fifty miles (80 km) off the eastern shore of Shikoku on the morning of 19 March, a Japanese plane dove toward the destroyer and, despite fire from the ship, dropped a small bomb which hit off the ship's starboard quarter. No further action occurred that day as Uhlmann, screening TG 58.2, proceeded southward to rejoin the rest of TF 58 southeast of Ky≈´sh≈´. Ships of the task force began refueling on the 20th but were forced to discontinue when an air attack developed in mid-afternoon. Uhlmann was transferring aviation personnel to at 1453 when a kamikaze dove at carrier , missed, and crashed into Halsey Powell. Uhlmann fired on enemy dive bombers throughout the remainder of the afternoon, was hit by some shrapnel, but suffered no casualties. Air activity continued to be heavy as strikes on Japan continued on 21 March. During a surprise attack early in the afternoon, a bomb fell only from Cushing, and another bomb narrowly missed a carrier of the force. Ten minutes before midnight on 22 March, while Uhlmann steamed on picket station, she made a surface radar contact which was later identified as a Japanese submarine. In company with , she proceeded at high speed toward the submerging target and stood by while Haggard forced the enemy ship to the surface with depth charges. Haggard then rammed the submarine which exploded and sank. Uhlmann escorted the slightly damaged destroyer back to Ulithi where they arrived on 25 March. She departed Ulithi on 30 March and set a northwesterly course. After weathering a typhoon on 2 April, she rendezvoused with TG 58.4 on 5 April and, toward dusk, began an approach for strikes on Okinawa. Following rendezvous with TF 58, she alternated radar picket and screening duties as the carrier-based planes pounded Okinawa. In April, Japan began concentrated massed kamikaze attacks against American ships in the waters of the Ryukyus; and the carrier forces, despite their discreet distance from Okinawa, were not exempt from the attentions of the kamikazes. On 12 April, combat air patrol from the formation splashed three Mitsubishi A6M Zeroes (\\"Zekes\\") within sight of Uhlmann as she stood her picket station 25 miles (40 km) north of TF 58\\\\. Two days later, snoopers and nuisance raiders kept the air patrol occupied in the afternoon and early evening. On radar picket with TG 58.4 on 17 April, Uhlmann joined in fire that downed two enemy aircraft, one of which splashed near causing minor damage to that ship. That night, Uhlmann added her depth charges to a combined attack which sent to the bottom. Late on the afternoon of 29 April, as enemy planes began closing from the northward, destroyer Haggard joined Uhlman to strengthen the picket station in the face of attack. Minutes before 1700, a Japanese fighter plane, taken under fire by Uhlmann, nosed over and dove toward Haggard. The crash and explosion of the kamikaze and its bomb tore a hole in Haggards starboard side, flooding her firerooms and number one engine room, and leaving her dead in the water. Meanwhile, a second \\"Zeke\\" began a run in. Uhlmann splashed the attacker close aboard Haggard and rescued two of the damaged destroyer's crew from the water. Uhlmann then requested assistance from the task group which responded with a combat air patrol of two divisions. An hour later, light cruiser and Destroyer Division 104 came to the aid of the stricken destroyer. Uhlmann escorted Haggard a short distance toward Kerama Retto and returned to her picket duty the next day. She screened the carrier strike force until 11 May when she headed for the Caroline Islands. The ship arrived at Ulithi on the 14th. Underway with TG 58.4 on 24 May, the destroyer returned to a strike launch area off Okinawa and resumed her picket duties. On 28 May, operational control of the task force was returned to the 3d Fleet and TG 58.4 became TG 38.4. Uhlmann continued patrolling picket station and screening the fast carriers until 13 June when she arrived at San Pedro Bay, Leyte, for replenishment and maintenance. On 1 July, she set a northerly course; and, throughout July, the carriers conducted strikes on targets in the Japanese islands to soften up this last stronghold of Japanese power for the projected invasion. On 25 May, Uhlmann joined specially formed TG 35.3 for an antishipping sweep across Kii Suido between Honsh≈´ and Shikoku. Two hours after midnight on this completely overcast night, Uhlmann bombarded a radio tower on the southern tip of Uwano Hanto while other ships of the group shelled nearby airfields. Until the cessation of hostilities on 15 August, Uhlmann continued to operate with the carrier force as it launched strikes against Japan. On 23 August, she rendezvoused with TF 47‚Äîa combined British-American force‚Äîfor temporary escort duty in connection with the occupation of Japan. She arrived in Sagami Wan on 27 August, and immediately manned a picket station. On 30 August, while acting as plane guard for , she rescued that carrier's landing signal officer who had jumped over the side in an attempt to rescue the pilot of a downed plane. That same day, the destroyer anchored in Sagami Wan, ending 61 days of continuous operation and, on 31 August, shifted anchorages to Tokyo Bay. Her occupation duties included mail, freight, and passenger runs between Iwo Jima and Japanese ports. Late in October, she participated in training exercises; then, on 31 October, departed Yokosuka, steamed via Pearl Harbor, and arrived at Bremerton late in November. Following alterations, she got underway on 20 April 1946 and arrived at San Diego on 24 April. There, on 14 June 1946, she was decommissioned and placed in reserve. On 12 August, she was assigned to the Naval Reserve Training Program and underwent an overhaul at Terminal Island before reporting to the Commandant, 11th Naval District, in November 1946. Operating out of San Diego, she trained reserve crews until the end of the decade. On 23 May 1950, she was recommissioned, but remained in reserve and, that summer, made a southward voyage, visiting Central and South American ports. She returned to San Diego in July and, on 18 November, was assigned active status. =Korean War= A male sailor and two WAVES on board USS Uhlmann in 1950 On 27 January 1951, she reported to the Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet, for duty and, on 16 June, departed San Diego with units of Destroyer Division 152, setting her course for Korean waters. Commander P.A. \\"Tony\\" Lilly was in command. Assigned to TF 77‚Äîthe fast carrier force operating in the Sea of Japan‚ÄîUhlmann resumed the screening and plane guard duties which had occupied much of her time in World War II. She later joined TF 95, a blockade and escort force, and carried out day and night bombardment of the Korean coast. While conducting a routine observation patrol off Wonsan Harbor's Hodo Peninsula on the morning of 20 August, the destroyer came under fire from seven enemy shore batteries. Gun flashes on the beach provided a warning only moments before shells began to fall from the destroyer. All hands went quickly to battle stations as Uhlmann commenced evasive maneuvers, increased to flank speed, and opened fire on the shore installations. In short order, she reduced the enemy on shore to two guns, while she steamed among near misses, some of which came as close as . Fragments from the shell explosions carried away a radio antenna during the half hour engagement. Ordered by TG 95.2 to break off the action, Uhlmann withdrew out of range of the shore batteries. Commander Lilly was awarded the Bronze Star with combat \\"V\\" for \\"inflicting extensive damage upon the enemy\\" and contributing \\"immeasurably to the success of the siege of Wonsan\\". Lilly recalled another non-combat mission. \\"We had one espionage mission. We took three or four South Koreans up north and put them ashore near Hungnam in North Korea from our whaleboat at night. We went back some time later to pick them back up and got only one returning who was injured.\\" \\"A Sailor's Life\\", memoirs of Capt. P.A. \\"Tony\\" Lilly, USN (ret). Commander P.A. \\"Tony\\" Lilly, CO, Uhlmann, 1951 In the fall, she patrolled Taiwanese waters and participated in hunter-killer antisubmarine training off Okinawa. In November, she rejoined TF 77 and, operating in the Sea of Japan, rescued several pilots before leaving Yokosuka on 22 January 1952. She returned to San Diego on 6 February and, in the months that followed, underwent drydocking and alterations which included the installation of new armament. She conducted exercises; then departed San Diego on 11 August 1952 in company with Destroyer Division 152, escorting and to the Far East. During this seven-month Korean deployment, Uhlmann operated with fast carrier forces, conducted hunter-killer activities, and patrolled off Taiwan. She also conducted shore bombardment which destroyed enemy gun emplacements, a factory, and storage facilities, while damaging buildings, bunkers, and railways. On the morning of 3 November, as she was firing interdiction rounds on a railroad and tunnel on the east coast of North Korea near Hangwon, the destroyer was taken under fire by shore guns, mortars, and machine guns. Brought to alert by shell splashes only 100 yards (91 m) off her port bow, Uhlmann accelerated to 25 knots (46 km/h), began evasive maneuvers, and opened fire with her and guns. She scored a direct hit on an enemy gun emplacement and suffered only minor damages in the exchange. However, she emerged from the encounter with 13 wounded. After putting in at Hong Kong over Christmas, she departed Yokosuka on 3 March 1953, steamed via Midway and Pearl Harbor, and arrived at San Diego on 19 March 1953. =1953-1958= Following exercises off the west coast, Uhlmann was again deployed to the western Pacific. She proceeded via the Hawaiian Islands, and she arrived at Yokosuka on 20 November 1953. During this seven-month tour, the destroyer plied waters off Japan and Korea and engaged in training and operations out of Yokosuka and Sasebo with TF 77\\\\. In February 1954, Uhlmann joined with elements of the French and British Far Eastern Fleets for Exercise \\"Sonata\\" which included extensive antisubmarine warfare training and visits to Philippine and Indochina ports. During March, she embarked personnel of the Nationalist Chinese Navy for training. While patrolling Taiwan Strait in the first week of March, she assisted the grounded Chinese Nationalist merchant ship Kiang Shan which was stranded on an island in the Pescadores. In the course of a daring rescue of crewmen from the Chinese steamer, Uhlmann lost her whaleboat and bent her propellers, shafts, and rudder on reefs in the shallow water. After the successful completion of her mission, she put in at Kaohsiung on 5 March. To prevent vibration damage to her reduction gears, she was towed from that port on 11 March and, on 14 March, arrived at Subic Bay for repairs. On her return to San Diego, she resumed the stateside routine of upkeep and training. Over the net 15 years, Uhlmann made 11 more deployments to the western Pacific (WestPac). On deployment to the Far East in 1954 with Destroyer Division 152, she took part in the evacuation of the Tachen Islands‚Äîlocated off Hangchou Wan‚Äîin the American attempt to defuse the explosive situation which had developed between Nationalist China and the People's Republic of China. In 1958, during a period of heightened tension over the Chinese offshore islands, the destroyer again supported American interests in the Far East. Between deployments, Uhlmann operated out of San Diego, participating in fleet exercises, receiving upkeep, and performing goodwill assignments. =Vietnam War= In the 1960s, trouble flared in the area formerly known as French Indochina; and Uhlmann served three more wartime tours in Pacific waters, this time off the coast of Vietnam. Her duties included gunfire support of land action, often coordinated by an airborne spotter, illumination missions, and routine bombardment assignments. Off Vietnam in 1965, she searched junks for contraband; supplied shore bombardment; and served as a plane guard for carrier . In 1968, a year of heavy fighting in the Republic of Vietnam, Uhlmann acted as a plane guard in the Gulf of Tonkin and fired 50 naval gunfire support missions off Hu·∫ø. In 1969, she participated in fleet exercises in Hawaiian waters; then, on 1 October, she returned to the west coast and assumed new duties as a Group I Naval Reserve Training Ship operating out of Tacoma, Washington. For the next three years, she conducted reserve training cruises out of that port and participated in fleet exercises. During Exercise \\"Head Beagle\\" in August 1970, she conducted intensive training in the Strait of Juan de Fuca and off the coast of Washington in conjunction with Canadian naval forces. =Decommissioning= The oldest commissioned destroyer in the Navy, she was found unfit for service on 24 November 1971; and, on 15 July 1972, Uhlmann, the U.S. Navy's last Fletcher-class destroyer, was decommissioned at the Naval Reserve Center Pier, Tacoma. Her name was struck from the Navy List the same day, and she was transferred to the custody of the Inactive Ship Facility, Bremerton, for disposal. She was scrapped in 1974.

The idea for a sporty limited production car came from Eugene Casaroll, who controlled specialized vehicle builder Dual-Motors Corporation based in Detroit, Michigan; the name Dual-Ghia is representative of the collaborative efforts between the two builders. The design for a luxurious sports car was to be a modified version of the Ghia-built 1954 and 1955 Dodge- based concept cars known as the Firearrow I, II, III, IV and the nearly production-ready Firebomb; which had all been designed by Luigi Segre with some possible influence from Virgil Exner. With so many cars designed along the same theme, Chrysler may well have intended to produce the Firebomb and/or the Chrysler Falcon as a response to the Ford Thunderbird and Chevrolet Corvette; for whatever reason neither made it to production. After gaining rights to the Firearrow/Firebomb design, Casaroll asked Ghia's U.S. representative (and eventual Dual-Motors VP) Paul Farago to further develop the Firebomb into a production-friendly vehicle. The series-produced design utilized an even greater number of standard production MoPar fittings, the (road-legal) Firebomb two headlamp configuration, incorporated modest tail fins and was somewhat more slab-sided and square-edged in comparison to the Firearrow/Firebomb series. While a four-place convertible was the only official body type at least one coupe was built. The \\"world's longest assembly line\\" involved transporting a Dodge frame and drivetrain to Italy, where the bodywork and interior was fabricated by the coachbuilders at Ghia; once the partially completed vehicles were back in the U.S. Dual-Motors handled the rest. Performance was excellent, due to the cars being powered by the Dodge hemispherical-head short-stroke V-8 engine. Not all were built with the 315 CID Dodge hemispherical head engine. Some 1957's were built with the Dodge D-500 361 cu.in. dual quad carburetor. Mecum Auctions, Phoenix 2019  Rarity  With a retail price close to $7500, the Dual-Ghia D-500 was about $200 more expensive than most American production luxury cars. It cost, for example, about $200 more than Cadillac's Eldorado Biarritz convertible. However, its price did not even come close to that of the ultra-luxurious 1956 Continental Mark II at $10,400, or the 1957 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham at $13,074. Of the 117 cars produced, 32 still existed as of July 2006. The cars were mostly bought by American celebrities, such as Frank Sinatra, Sterling Hayden and Richard Nixon. Desi Arnaz owned one, but he wrecked it. Ronald Reagan owned one, which he lost in a high-stakes poker game with then-President Lyndon Johnson, who kept the car for several years.

The major railway routes of Indian Railways which come under Western Railways are: Mumbai Central - Ratlam, Mumbai Central - Ahmedabad and Palanpur - Ahmedabad. The railway system is divided into six operating divisions: , , , , , and . Vadodara railway station, being the junction point for the Ahmedabad - Mumbai route and the Mumbai - Ratlam route towards New Delhi, is the busiest junction station in Western Railways and one of the busiest junctions of Indian Railways too, while Ahmedabad Division earns highest revenue followed by Mumbai Division and Vadodara Division. Surat railway station is one of the busiest railway station in Western Railway in non-junction category where more than 180 trains pass per day. Western Railway General Manager's official bungalow 'Bombarci' (abbreviation of Bombay, Baroda and Central India) is located on Altamont road in Cumbala hill, Mumbai. History The Western Railway was created on 5 November 1951 by the merger of several state-owned railways, including the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway (BB&CI;), and the Saurashtra Railway, Rajputana Railway and Jaipur State Railway. The narrow gauge lines of Cutch State Railway was also merged into it in 1951. The BB&CI; Railway was itself inaugurated in 1855, starting with the construction of a 29-mile (47-km) broad gauge track from Ankleshwar to Utran in Gujarat state on the west coast. In 1864, the railway was extended to Mumbai. Subsequently, the project was further extended beyond Vadodara in a north easterly direction towards Godhra, Ratlam, Nagda and thereafter northwards towards Kota and Mathura, to eventually link with the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, now the Central Railway, which had already started operating in Mumbai in 1853. In 1860 Surat railway station was built and it was first railway station in Asia which is having platform on first floor (above ground level). In 1883, a metre gauge railway system, initially linking Delhi with Agra, Jaipur and Ajmer, was established. The first suburban service in Mumbai with steam traction was introduced in April 1867. It was extended to Churchgate in 1870. By 1900 45 trains in each direction were carrying over one million passengers annually. The railways of several princely states were also integrated into the Western Railway. The Gaekwars of Baroda built the Gaekwar's Baroda State Railway (GBSR), which was merged into the BB&CI; in 1949. Several railways of western Gujarat, including the Bhavnagar, Kathiawar, Jamnagar & Dwarka, Gondal, and Morvi railways were merged into the Saurashtra Railway in 1948. The Jodhpur‚ÄìBikaner Railway was taken over by Rajasthan state in 1949, after the western portion was ceded to the government of Pakistan. In 2002, the Jaipur and Ajmer divisions of the Western Railway became part of the newly created North Western Railway, and in April 2003 the Kota division of the Western Railway became part of the newly created West Central Railway. Present Newly built Andheri Station East Side Western Railway headquarters is in Mumbai's Churchgate station and serves the entire state of Gujarat, some portions of Western Madhya Pradesh, and coastal Maharashtra. The Western coast of India served by Western Railway has a number of ports, most important among them being Kandla, Hajira, Surat, Dahej, Mundra, Okha, Veraval, Porbandar, Bhavnagar in Gujarat state and Mumbai in Maharashtra. Navapur railway station is unique as it falls in both the state's of Gujarat and Maharashtra because both were as a one state of Bombay State before 1960 and after States Reorganization Act the Navapur station was divided equally among Gujarat and Maharashtra. So is the Surat railway station unique. It is Asia's one of the first railway station where the platforms is on the first floor, that is above the ground level. The ticket counter is on the ground floor. Electric Multiple Units (EMUs) ply between Churchgate and Virar (60 km) and is projected to extend the service till Dahanu Road (Services actually started on 16 April 2013), while Mainline Electrical Multiple Units (MEMUs) service the section beyond Virar till Dahanu Road (60 km). EMUs are of 12 car or 15 car rakes and are differentiated as slow and fast locals. Slow trains halt at all stations, while fast ones halt at important stations only and are preferable over longer distances. The first electric train on this section was introduced in 1928 between Churchgate and Andheri.

The Dmitry Laptev Strait is named in his honor and the Laptev Sea is named in honor of him and his cousin, and fellow Arctic explorer, Khariton Laptev. Early life Dmitry Laptev was born in the village of Bolotovo, near Velikie Luki, in 1701. A year earlier his cousin Khariton Laptev was born in nearby Bolotovo. He and his cousin were some of the first students at the School of Mathematics and Navigational Sciences in Saint Petersburg, established by Peter the Great. After graduation, he quickly moved up naval ranks and became a ranking naval officer on a number of different vessels. Arctic exploration Dmitry Laptev was a lieutenant in the Navy assigned to the Second Kamchatka Expedition in 1735 under Vitus Bering. With the death of the head of the Yakutsk captain Vasili Pronchishchev in 1736, Bering appointed Laptev to be the head of the Yakutsk crew and chart the coast of the Arctic Ocean from the Lena River eastward. With permission from Bering, Laptev returned to Saint Petersburg for the winter. A second attempt the next year similarly failed to reach the eastern fleets of the expedition. In 1739, Laptev was the commander of an expedition to chart the Anadyr region in the far east of the continent. The expedition went poorly at first and the Yakutsk became trapped by ice very quickly. That winter the crew, led by Laptev, were the first Russians to live amongst the indigenous population of the lower Indigirka River. Villagers from Russkoye Ustye provided crucial food, assistance, and even moved the ship to open water when spring came. Although sea travel never yielded much, Laptev and the crew provided significant mapping of the areas, often through overland treks and expeditions. After the expedition, he continued his military service in the Baltic Fleet. Laptev was promoted to Vice Admiral rank in 1762, and retired the same year. Legacy A cape in the delta of the Lena River and a strait between the Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island and Asian mainland bear his name. The Laptev Sea is also named after Dmitry Laptev and his cousin, and arctic explorer, Khariton Laptev.

Early life Kruspe was born in Wittenberge (then part of East Germany). He was named Sven at birth, but later changed his name to Richard, as he believes that everyone should be able to change their name if they so choose. He has two older sisters and an older brother. His parents divorced when he was young, and his mother remarried; Kruspe did not get along with his stepfather. The family moved to the village of Weisen when Kruspe was young. Because of his poor relationship with his stepfather, Kruspe often ran away from home in his early teens, sleeping on park benches. He later got into wrestling as a way to channel his anger. At the age of sixteen, Kruspe and some friends visited Czechoslovakia, where he bought a guitar. He had originally planned to sell it, as it was very expensive and he thought he could make a nice profit from it. However, once he returned to East Germany, a girl he met at a campground asked him to play it for her. He told her that he couldn't play; however, she kept insisting, so Kruspe got mad and started strumming. He recalled, \\"the harder I played, the more excited she got. Something clicked in my head, and I realized girls like guys who play guitars.\\" This got him interested in playing the guitar; as a result, he began playing every day and night for the next two years. Career In 1985, bored with the apathetic music scene in his hometown, Kruspe moved to East Berlin and lived on Lychener Stra√üe, where he \\"made music all day\\". For two years, he lived in an apartment with a drum kit and a guitar, and made music by himself because he did not know anybody there. \\"It was a lonely time\\", according to Kruspe, but he used it to explore music. On 10 October 1989, before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Kruspe was riding on the subway. After coming back above ground, he found himself in the middle of a political demonstration. He was hit on the head and arrested just for being there, and thrown in jail for six days. Once out of jail, he decided to leave East Germany. Because of the Eastern Bloc, he entered West Germany by traveling through Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Austria. When the Berlin Wall came down, he moved back east of Berlin. Kruspe's first band, Das Elegante Chaos, was formed in the late 1980s. The band played live with other bands such as First Arsch (in which Till Lindemann was a drummer). In 1989, when Kruspe was 22, some songs were recorded by the band; these songs were later released in 2011 on the album Lyrik by Dachboden-Records. Seeking a more independent experience, Kruspe formed Orgasm Death Gimmick, which operated between 1991 and 1993; Orgasm Death Gimmick released three demo tapes, and a promotional tape through their label, Wydoks, before disbanding. During his early career, Kruspe also featured in releases by other bands such as First Arsch. Finally, Rammstein was formed in 1994, when Kruspe, who lived with Oliver Riedel and Christoph Schneider at the time, was looking for a new band in which to create a new style of music. Kruspe during \\"Feuer frei!\\" Personal life Kruspe married South African actress Caron Bernstein on 29 October 1999. The ceremony was Jewish, and Kruspe composed the music for it. He took the name Richard Kruspe-Bernstein during their marriage. Sometime in 2001, he moved from Berlin to New York to live closer to Bernstein. They separated in 2004. His last name is now back to its original form, as the divorce was finalized. In 2011, he left New York, because \\"it is not the right environment for the next part of my life\\", and moved back to Berlin. Kruspe was in a relationship with Margaux Bossieux, bassist of the all-girl New York punk band Dirty Mary. Bossieux was also involved in the recording of Emigrate's debut album.

Biography =Early life= Paul Landers was born in East Berlin, Germany, as son of the Slavists Anton and Erika Hiersche. His mother comes from E≈Çk in Mazuria, Poland, and his father from B√∂hmisch Kahn, today Velk√© Chvojno, Czech Republic. Both parents had to leave their home countries after the Second World War and met during their studies in Halle (Saale). Landers lived in Moscow for a short time as a child. He can speak Russian a little; however, he can not read or write it. =Music career= In 1983, at the age of 18, Landers became part of the East German punk band Feeling B, which was founded by singer Aljoscha Rompe and drummer Alexander Kriening. Some weeks later they recruited 16 year-old Christian \\"Flake\\" Lorenz to play bass, though Flake played just an organ at this point of time. Lorenz used his organ to create bass sounds for the new band. The band had various temporary drummers, including Christoph Schneider later in their career. Landers also played in a number of other bands including Die Firma and Die Magdalene Keibel Combo. In the late 1980s, Landers met Till Lindemann during some showings of the GDR documentary \\"fl√ºstern und SCHREIEN\\", which showed first of all some varieties of young music culture in the GDR. He also met Richard Kruspe, a friend of Lindemann, during this period. Some time after this, Landers played guitar in Lindemanns and Kruspe's band First Arsch. In 1992, that band released their only album, Saddle Up. Lindemann, Kruspe, Schneider, and bassist Oliver Riedel formed a new band called Templeprayers in 1993. They won the Berlin Senate Metro Beat Contest in 1994 that enabled them to have a four-track demo professionally recorded. Landers and Flake soon joined this band, which became known as Rammstein. =Personal life= When he married Nikki Landers in 1984 (at the age of 20), he took his wife's surname and switched his middle and first name, thus making his name Paul Landers. Paul also has a son born in 1990, Emil Reinke, and a younger daughter.

Buys Ballot's law, which was first deduced by the American meteorologists J.H. Coffin and William Ferrel, is a direct consequence of Ferrel's law. The law takes its name from C. H. D. Buys Ballot, a Dutch meteorologist, who published it in the Comptes Rendus, November 1857. While William Ferrel theorized this first in 1856, Buys Ballot was the first to provide an empirical validation. Buys Ballot's law first appeared in early versions (prior to 1900) of Bowditch's American Practical Navigator and other publications written to assist in passage planning and the safe conduct of ships at sea and is still included today both in Bowditch and in Sailing Directions (see following reference) as an item of practical reference and information.  Uses  The law outlines general rules of conduct for masters of both sail and steam vessels, to assist them in steering the vessels away from the center and right front (in the Northern Hemisphere and left front in the Southern Hemisphere) quadrants of hurricanes or any other rotating disturbances at sea. Prior to radio, satellite observation and the ability to transmit timely weather information over long distances, the only method a ship's master had to forecast the weather was observation of meteorological conditions (visible cloud formations, wind direction and atmospheric pressure) at his location. Included in the Sailing Directions for the World are Buys Ballot's techniques for avoiding the worst part of any rotating storm system at sea using only the locally observable phenomena of cloud formations, wind speed and barometric pressure tendencies over a number of hours. These observations and application of the principles of Buys Ballot's law help to establish the probability of the existence of a storm and the best course to steer to try to avoid the worst of it‚Äîwith the best chance of survival. The underlying principles of Buys Ballot's law state that for anyone ashore in the Northern Hemisphere and in the path of a hurricane, the most dangerous place to be is in the right front quadrant of the storm. There, the observed wind speed of the storm is the sum of the speed of wind in the storm circulation plus the velocity of the storm's forward movement. Buys Ballot's law calls this the \\"Dangerous Quadrant\\". Likewise, in the left front quadrant of the storm the observed wind is the difference between the storm's wind velocity and its forward speed. This is called the \\"Safe Quadrant\\" due to the lower observed wind speeds. To look at it another way, in the Northern Hemisphere if a person is to the right of where a hurricane or tropical storm makes landfall, that is considered the dangerous quadrant. If they are to the left of the point of landfall, that is the safe quadrant. In the dangerous quadrant an observer will experience higher wind speeds and generally a much higher storm surge due to the onshore wind direction. In the safe quadrant, the observer will experience somewhat lower wind speeds and the possibility of lower than normal water levels due to the direction of the wind being offshore. These are very general rules that are subject to many other factors, including shapes of the coastline, and topography in any location. Although the principles apply to a very limited extent to a coastal observer during the approach and passage of a storm in any location, Buys Ballot's law was primarily formulated from empirical data to assist ships at sea.

He is best known as the lead vocalist and lyricist of Neue Deutsche H√§rte band Rammstein and German-Swedish duo Lindemann. Rammstein have sold over 45 million records worldwide, with five of their albums receiving platinum status, and Lindemann has been listed among the \\"50 Greatest Metal Frontmen of All Time\\" by Roadrunner Records. He has appeared in minor roles in films and has also published two books of poetry, Messer (Knife) in 2002 and In stillen N√§chten (In Silent Nights) in 2013. He has presented some of his original poems and scripts to galleries. Early life Lindemann was born on 4 January 1963 in Leipzig, East Germany, the son of poet Werner Lindemann and journalist Brigitte Hildegard \\"Gitta\\" Lindemann, who worked for Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) from 1992 until her retirement in 2002. His parents first met at a conference in Bitterfeld in 1959.Irgendein Neuerdings Mike Oldfield ‚Äì ein Vater ‚Äì Sohn Geschichte (RF radio play) 2011 He grew up in Wendisch-Rambow alongside his younger sister, Saskia. At age 11, Lindemann went to a sports school at the Empor Rostock Sport Club, and attended a boarding school from 1977 to 1980. His parents lived separately for career reasons after 1975, and divorced when Lindemann was still young. He lived with his father for a short time, but the relationship was unhealthy; in the book Mike Oldfield im Schaukelstuhl, his father wrote about his own problems with alcoholism and the difficulties of being a father to a teenage Lindemann. In 1978, Lindemann participated in the European Junior Swimming Championships in Florence, finishing 11th in the freestyle and 7th in the freestyle, swimming a time of ; he was shortlisted to go to the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, but left the sport due to an injury. According to Lindemann, \\"I never liked the sport school actually, it was very intense. But as a child you don't object.\\" He later worked as an apprentice carpenter, a gallery technician, a peat cutter, and a basket weaver. His mother dedicated a letter titled Mein Sohn, der Frontmann von Rammstein (\\"My son, the frontman of Rammstein\\") to Lindemann in 2009. The first album he owned was Deep Purple's Stormbringer. Career =Music= Engel\\", wearing angel wings fitted with flamethrowers Lindemann started to play drums for Schwerin-based experimental rock band First Arsch in 1986,Bettendorf, p. 117. who released an album titled Saddle Up in 1992, and played one song (\\"Lied von der unruhevollen Jugend\\") with a punk band called Feeling B, which was the former band of Rammstein members Paul Landers, Christoph Schneider and Christian \\"Flake\\" Lorenz in 1989. During his time in Feeling B, he played the drums in the band. In the 1990s, Lindemann began to write lyrics. In 1994, the band entered and won a contest in Berlin that allowed them to record a four track demo professionally. When questioned as to why Rammstein was named after the Ramstein air show disaster,Ronald Galenza, Heinz Havemeister: Feeling B. Mix mir einen Drink. ‚Äì p. 262. Schwarzkopf & Schwarzkopf, Berlin 2002, he said he viewed images of the incident on television, and that he and the bandmates wanted to make a musical memorial. Lindemann then moved to Berlin. During Rammstein's early years, because of his use of over-the-top pyrotechnics, Lindemann has burned his ears, hair and arms. Bandmate Christoph Schneider commented, \\"Till gets burned all the time, but he likes the pain.\\" An incident in September 1996 caused a section of the band's set to burn, and as a result, Lindemann got his certification in pyrotechnics so the band could perform with pyrotechnics more safely than it had previously. Lindemann performing with Rammstein During Rammstein's US tour with Korn in 1998, Lindemann and his bandmate Christian \\"Flake\\" Lorenz were arrested in Worcester, Massachusetts for lewd conduct performed during their song \\"B√ºck dich\\" (\\"bend over\\"), which consisted of Lindemann using a liquid squirting dildo and simulating anal sex on Lorenz. Both Lindemann and Lorenz were released the following day after bail was met. This incident did not stop Lindemann from performing in the same manner for future shows outside the United States, particularly in Australia when they performed at the 2011 Big Day Out, but the United States performances of this song were changed into a sadomasochistic theme that did not feature dildos, although this was not the case for all remaining US shows on the tour. For example, on 18 June 1999, \\"B√ºck dich\\" was performed in the same manner at the Roseland Theater in Portland, Oregon. In 1999, the band was blamed for the 1999 Columbine massacre, but they denied their music was a factor. In November 2002, Lindemann's poetry book Messer was published. It consists of 54 poems compiled by Gert Hof, author of the book Rammstein, who was also the band's pyrodesigner for the last seven years. In July 2010, Lindemann, along with Flake, was interviewed by heavy metal anthropologist Sam Dunn for the VH1 Classic series Metal Evolution, on the topic of shock rock. Rammstein\\", wearing dual arm-mounted flamethrowers Lindemann is not a stranger to injury, as he mentioned in Rammstein's early career that he'd gotten burned several times with unprofessionally rigged pyrotechnics. At a performance in Sweden in 2005, he received a knee injury on stage when keyboardist Flake accidentally ran into him while riding a Segway PT. This injury caused several tour dates in Asia to be cancelled. In 2005, five Rammstein albums received platinum awards and the band also received the \\"World Sales Awards\\" for over 10 million sold copies worldwide. During the filming of the band's music video for \\"Ich tu dir weh\\", Lindemann wanted a light put in his mouth to create a visually stunning effect. Bandmate Paul Landers suggested that he use a flesh colored wire and run it along his cheek to shine a light into his mouth from the outside. Lindemann refused, and instead opted to have a surgical incision in his left cheek, so that a light could be fed into his mouth directly, and largely out of sight. There is a specific performance move of Lindemann's, dubbed \\"The Till Hammer\\". This move is where he bends his knees, beats his thigh with a fist in a hammering motion while turning his head from side to side. On occasion, Flake has been seen to parody the move onstage. Unlike most frontmen, Lindemann stated in an interview that he does not like being looked at while on stage, and would wear sunglasses to block out views of the audience. The main purpose of the band's signature pyrotechnics has also been stated to actually be a tool in taking the audience's attention away from Lindemann, whilst doubling as a spectacle for the audience. Lindemann often opts to just look directly at the mixing booth in the center of the crowd, except when directly interacting with an audience member. In 2011, Roadrunner Records listed Lindemann at number 50 of the 50 greatest metal frontmen of all time. In 2013, Lindemann's second poetry book, In stillen N√§chten was published. He commented on the poetry, saying \\"The vast majority of my poems could have been written a few hundred years earlier.\\" On his 52nd birthday (4 January 2015), it was announced that Lindemann would start a new project with Peter T√§gtgren named Lindemann. The band released their debut album Skills in Pills in June 2015. On 22 November 2019, Lindemann released their second album, F&M.; =Poetry= Lindemann in 2017 In 2018, Lindemann embarked on a book signing tour across Russia for his poetry book, Messer, originally released in German and then translated into Russian and re-released to the Russian market. Lindemann showed up to his book signing in Moscow with an unknown person in a gimp costume. The female gimp was led through the crowd by Lindemann before he sat down to sign autographs and talk to fans. It is still unknown who was in the outfit, but suggestions are that of his girlfriend at the time. =Film and television= Two songs from the album Herzeleid were used in David Lynch's 1997 film, Lost Highway. Lindemann has also played minor roles in some films, appearing with his bandmate Christoph Schneider as musicians in the 1999 film Pola X, playing a character named Viktor in the children's comedy film Amundsen der Pinguin (2003), and also appearing as an animal rights activist in the 2004 film Vinzent. Lindemann and the rest of Rammstein also appeared in the 2002 movie xXx (Triple-X starring Vin Diesel) while performing \\"Feuer frei!\\" =As guest artist= *Lindemann appeared as guest drummer on Hea Hoa Hoa Hea Hea Hoa by Feeling B, for the song \\"Lied von der unruhevollen Jugend\\"; the song, despite its German title, is sung in Russian. Years later, this track was performed live at a Rammstein gig in St. Petersburg, Russia, on 19 November 2001, during the Mutter tour. *Lindemann provides vocals for the track \\"Helden\\" (a German language cover of Bowie's \\"Heroes\\") on the Apocalyptica album Worlds Collide. *Lindemann also sings on \\"Wut will nicht sterben\\" by Die Puhdys. *Lindemann and Richard Kruspe covered the Aria song \\"Shtil\\", retitling it \\"Schtiel\\". *Lindemann also appeared on Knorkator's music video to the song \\"Du nich\\". *Lindemann once again appeared with Kruspe, this time with Kruspe's band Emigrate, recording guest vocals on the song \\"Let's Go\\", on their third album, A Million Degrees. Musicianship Made in Germany tour, 2011 Lindemann's vocal range is that of a dramatic baritone. He has a tendency to press his voice with force from below and use the alveolar trill, stating in an interview that he sings it out of instinct. However, this trait could be connected to his youth years in Mecklenburg. In 2005, the New York Times commented on Lindemann's voice: \\"He commands a low, powerful bass rarely used in contemporary pop music, untrained but electrifying.\\" Lindemann himself describes his lyrics as \\"love songs\\".Bettendorf, p. 99. Some songs written by him have references to 19th century or earlier literature. For example, \\"Dalai Lama\\" from the album Reise, Reise is an adaption of Goethe's \\"Der Erlk√∂nig\\".Littlejohn, p. 218. He also used more of Goethe's poems, as \\"Rosenrot\\" contains elements from the poem \\"Heidenr√∂slein\\", while \\"Feuer und Wasser\\" has narrative elements from Friedrich Schiller's \\"Der Taucher\\".Littlejohn, p. 100. Lindemann also used elements from Der Struwwelpeter by Heinrich Hoffmann on \\"Hilf mir\\" from the album Rosenrot.Littlejohn, p. 240. \\"Mein Herz brennt\\" has lyrics taken from a narrative line in the German children's show Das Sandm√§nnchen. Lindemann has used contemporary literature for intertextual references; the song title \\"Non, je ne regrette rien\\" was used as a chorus for the song \\"Fr√ºhling in Paris\\", and the song lyrics of \\"Links 2-3-4\\" are based from the song \\"Einheitsfrontlied\\" by Bertolt Brecht.Littlejohn, p. 126. According to Lindemann, the lyrics of the song state the band's political category, positioning themselves on the left. This song is in fact written by Bertolt Brecht and composed by Hanns Eisler in 1934. The full text can be found here: \\"Einheitsfrontlied\\" He had also used another song composed by Brecht, titled \\"Mack the Knife\\", and the chorus was used for the song \\"Haifisch\\". The song \\"Cowboy\\" is a criticism of the hypermasculine character of Americans. Despite \\"Hollywood propaganda\\", Lindemann states that it was actually the cowboys who beat up the Native Americans. Personal life Lindemann in 2004 Lindemann's first daughter, Nele, was born in 1985; he spent seven years as a single father. He has one grandson through Nele. On 28 February 1991, his ex-wife and his Rammstein bandmate Richard Kruspe had a daughter together named Khira, who shares her surname with Lindemann and not Kruspe as her mother retained Lindemann's surname when they divorced and never married Kruspe. Lindemann's second daughter, Marie Louise, was born in 1993 to ex-wife Anja K√∂seling. He dated actress and model Sophia Thomalla from April 2011 to November 2015. Lindemann is an atheist. In a 2011 interview, he said that he still has strong connections to the traditions of East Germany, and that he finds \\"de- traditionalisation\\" disturbing and believes that there is \\"no longer any authenticity\\". In direct contrast to his musical style, he has stated that he \\"hates noise\\" and often spends time in a quiet village somewhere in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the name and exact location of which he has not disclosed. In 2014, Lindemann presented two sculptures and his original scripts of poems in his book In stillen N√§chten (In Silent Nights) in a Dresden gallery. He also wrote some lyrics in 2014 for German Schlager singer Roland Kaiser for his album Soul Tracks.

Early life Riedel was born in Schwerin on 11 April 1971. Growing up, he had relatively good relationships with both of his parents. He attributes this to the small gap between their ages. As a child, he was not a good student, but he made his way through school with the assistance of his mother. Riedel was quite shy, especially during his teenage years; while his friends partied, he would often be found just \\"hanging around\\". Musical career In 1990, at the age of 19, Riedel began playing in a folk/punk band called the Inchtabokatables. In 1994, Riedel, Till Lindemann, Richard Kruspe, and Christoph Schneider entered and won the Berlin Senate Metro beat contest that allowed them to record a four- track demo professionally. Paul Landers and Christian \\"Flake\\" Lorenz would later join the band they named Rammstein. The six released their first album, Herzeleid (\\"Heartache\\"), in September 1995. Their second album, Sehnsucht (\\"Desire\\"), was released in 1997, which would later become platinum. In April 2001, the album Mutter (\\"Mother\\") was released and a European tour followed, ending on 13 July 2002. It has been reported that at this time the members of Rammstein were seriously discussing whether to continue or not in their present form. It was decided that they should all take some time off and then reconsider whether to continue. In 2003, Rammstein started to work on their fourth album, which turned out to be a turning point in the band's sound and maturity. In September 2004, the band saw their work pay off with the release of Reise, Reise (\\"rise, rise\\"). In 2005, Rosenrot (\\"Rose-Red\\") was released. Rammstein's sixth album, Liebe ist f√ºr alle da (\\"Love is there for everyone\\"), was released in October 2009. In May 2019, Rammstein released their untitled seventh album. Personal life Riedel has two children, one a girl named Emma, and is separated from their mother. He enjoys photography and sports, especially skateboarding and surfing. In the making of the video for \\"Keine Lust\\", he mentions wanting to go snowboarding while wearing a fat suit. He is the tallest member of Rammstein, standing in at 6 ft 7 in (2 m). It has also been said he is the most computer-literate member of the band. Musicianship = Technique = Riedel is primarily a fingerstyle player, although he uses a pick for most songs when playing live. In certain softer songs, Riedel has been known to play with a banjo style plucking technique with his right hand to play arpeggiated chords, such as in \\"Seemann\\". He also plays the acoustic guitar introduction to \\"Fr√ºhling in Paris\\" in live shows. =Gear= His known gear is: * Sandberg California PM * Sandberg Terrabass signature model * MusicMan Stingray (used during the early days of the band) * ESP Eclipse bass (used during the Sehnsucht tour) * Sandberg Plasmabass 4-string custom built model * Tech 21 SansAmp Bass Driver DI * Glockenklang Heart-Rock Amp (Later rig) * Ampeg SVT-II (Early rig) * Ampeg 8x10 Cabs Riedel also uses selected overdrive/fuzz pedals for songs such as \\"Mein Teil\\" and \\"Rosenrot\\".

He played for the Cleveland Indians, Chicago White Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees, California Angels, and Oakland Athletics. He was a four-time MLB All-Star and, with 288, has the second-most wins of any pitcher since 1900 not in the Hall of Fame. At the age of 18, in 1961, John was signed by the Indians, who were impressed with his curveball. He pitched two seasons for them before getting traded to the White Sox, with whom he would spend seven seasons. He established himself as a major league starter in 1965 and became Chicago's Opening Day starter in 1966. In 1968, he finished fifth in the American League (AL) with a 1.98 earned run average (ERA) and was named to his first All-Star team, though he missed the end of the season after he was injured in a fight with Dick McAuliffe. In 1971, pitching coach Johnny Sain tried to change John's pitching mechanics, but John had his highest ERA since 1964 and was traded to the Dodgers for Dick Allen after the season. He won 11 games in 1972 with the Dodgers, then led the National League (NL) in winning percentage over the next two seasons. In 1974, though, he suffered a potentially career-ending injury when he tore his ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in a game against the Montreal Expos. Dr. Frank Jobe, the Dodger physician, performed ligament replacement surgery on John later that year. He missed the 1975 season recovering but became the first pitcher to successfully return to baseball following major surgery. Tommy John surgery has since become a common procedure among baseball pitchers, with one out of seven MLB pitchers in 2012 having received it at some point during their careers. John had a 10‚Äì10 record his first year back from the surgery. In 1977, John had his first career 20-win season, going 20‚Äì7 with a 2.78 ERA as the Dodgers won the NL West and reached the 1977 World Series. He helped the Dodgers return to the World Series in 1978 with a 17‚Äì10 record before leaving for the Yankees as a free agent. With the Yankees, John posted 20-win seasons in 1979 and 1980; he was an All-Star in those years as well as in 1978, his final year with the Dodgers. In 1981, he suffered a scare when his son Travis fell three stories on August 13 and spent about two weeks in a coma. Travis made a full recovery, though, and John (who missed some games to be at his son's bedside) played in his third Yankee-Dodger World Series, winning Game 1 though the Yankees ultimately lost the Series, marking the third World Series in which John had pitched for the losing team. He was traded to the California Angels in 1982, for whom he made two starts in the AL Championship Series. He remained with the team until 1985, when he was released, though he spent the second half of the season pitching for the Oakland Athletics. Unsigned to begin 1986, it appeared that John's career might be over, but injuries to Yankee pitchers prompted New York to re-sign him. John won 13 games for the Yankees in 1987, then became the oldest player in baseball in 1988 following Phil Niekro's retirement. In 1989, he tied Deacon McGuire's record for most seasons pitched (26, later broken by Nolan Ryan) before retiring. From 1995 through 2009, John was on the Hall of Fame ballot; he never received more than 31.7% of the votes (75% is required for election) but remains eligible to be chosen by the Modern Era Subcommittee of the Veterans Committee. He served as a broadcaster for the Minnesota Twins and the Yankees in the 1990s, then managed the Bridgeport Bluefish from 2007 through the first half of the 2009 season. Since retiring, he has served as a motivational speaker and also founded the \\"Let's Do It\\" Foundation, dedicated to raising awareness about suicides and preventing them. Early life John grew up in Terre Haute, Indiana. As a youth, he often played sandlot ball with other kids, either at Spencer Field or Woodrow Wilson field. Arley Andrews, a former minor league pitcher and a friend of John's dad, taught John to throw a curveball, which would be John's main pitch. John was an outstanding baseball and basketball player at Gerstmeyer High School in Terre Haute, Indiana. He had a 28‚Äì2 record as a pitcher. All the athletics did not get in the way of his schoolwork, as John graduated as Gerstmeyer's 1961 valedictorian. The opportunity to deliver a speech at commencement was taken away from him by the faculty due to the stutter he had. Several colleges recruited John to play basketball for them, including University of Kentucky, but John also caught the eye of Cleveland Indians' scout Johnny Schulte, who worried that John needed more of a fastball to succeed but considered his curveball already a major league pitch. John picked baseball and signed with the Indians after graduating, getting assigned to the Dubuque Packers of the Class D Midwest League. Playing career =Minor Leagues (1961‚Äì1963)= John had a 10‚Äì4 record in 1961 but had some trouble with the Charleston Indians of the Class A Eastern League in 1962. \\"I was rearing back on every pitch and firing with all my strength at the strike zone,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAs a result I kept getting behind in the ball-and-strike count, often running it to three balls and no strikes, so I just had to put my fastball right over the plate and get it creamed.\\" This led to a lot of walks, but player-coach Steve Jankowski worked with him, suggesting that John throw less hard so that he would have more control. The alterations helped John get called up to the Class AAA Jacksonville Suns of the International League during the year, and John won two games for them with the playoffs. He started 1963 with Jacksonville, got sent down to Charleston, went 9‚Äì2 with a 1.61 ERA for the West Virginian Indians, and got called up to the major leagues in September at the age of twenty. =Cleveland Indians (1963‚Äì1964)= September 6, 1963, was the start of the 26-year major league career of Tommy John, who allowed one unearned run in one inning of a 7‚Äì2 loss to the Washington Senators. Used at first as a reliever, he finished the year with three starts. Though his record was 0‚Äì2, his earned run average (ERA) was 2.21. Manager Birdie Tebbetts called his fastball \\"deceptive.\\" In his first start of 1964, on May 3, John threw a shutout against the Baltimore Orioles for his first major league win in the second game of a doubleheader. He won two of his first three games but then lost eight decisions in a row and got sent to AAA (now the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League) in July. Indians' pitching coach Early Wynn had been trying to get John to throw a slider, but John altered his grip, affecting his control. He returned to throwing just a fastball and a curveball in the minors and was called up for a few games in September by the Indians. After the season, he was sent to the Chicago White Sox as part of a three-way trade between Cleveland, Chicago, and the Kansas City Athletics that sent Rocky Colavito to Cleveland. =Chicago White Sox (1965‚Äì1971)= John's first appearances with the White Sox were in relief. During the first half of the 1965 season, he and Juan Pizarro alternatively spent time as Chicago's fifth starter in the rotation. By the second half, however, he had cemented himself within the team's starting rotation. September 25, he held the New York Yankees to one run and hit a go-ahead home run against Bill Stafford to give himself a 3‚Äì1 victory. In 39 games (27 starts), he had a 14‚Äì7 record, a 3.09 ERA, 126 strikeouts, 58 walks, and 162 hits allowed in innings. By 1966, manager Eddie Stanky had made John his Opening Day starter. He tied for the American League (AL) lead with five shutouts during the season. Two of these, May 7 against the Detroit Tigers and August 12 against the California Angels, came on days when the White Sox only scored one run for him. In 34 games (33 starts), he had a 14‚Äì11 record, a 2.62 ERA, 138 strikeouts, 57 walks, and 195 hits in 223 innings. His 2.62 ERA placed fifth in the league, and his 10 complete games tied for ninth (with Mudcat Grant). Once again in 1967, John led the AL in shutouts, this time with six. He had a season-high nine strikeouts in a shutout of the Senators on June 13. On July 4, he shut out the defending-World Series champion Orioles, limiting Baltimore to two hits. July 22, he left a game against the Athletics after facing just two batters and did not pitch again until August 20. At season's end, his record was just 10‚Äì13, but his 2.47 ERA ranked fourth in the league. He had 110 strikeouts, 47 walks, and 143 hits allowed in innings. 1968 started out as John's best season thus far in his career. On June 30, he shut out the Tigers in a 12‚Äì0 victory. With a 1.78 ERA in the first half, he was named to the All-Star Game for the first time in his career. Another highlight came against Cleveland August 9, when he held the Indians scoreless for seven innings and scored the only run of the game. He had a 1.98 ERA through 25 starts with the White Sox in 1968. August 22 of that year, with a 3-2 count on Dick McAuliffe, John threw ball four over McAuliffe's head. An angry McAuliffe charged the mound and started a fight between the two players. McAuliffe was fined and suspended; John was not punished, but he tore some shoulder ligaments in the scuffle and missed the rest of the season with an injury. Thirty years later, McAuliffe said in an interview that he still thought John was trying to hit him in that game. White Sox' general manager Ed Short noted that this was unlikely given that the pitch before the fight came on a 3-2 count, resulting in a walk for McAuliffe. Though pitcher ERAs were down across baseball in 1968, John's still ranked fifth in the league. He had a 10‚Äì5 record and gave up just 135 hits in innings. John was recovered in time for the 1969 season, though Gary Peters got the Opening Day start, with John second in the rotation. In his first start of the year, against the Athletics on April 9, John allowed only four hits in a complete game shutout, as Chicago won 3‚Äì0. He held the Indians scoreless for innings on May 10, earning the victory as the White Sox prevailed by a score of 4‚Äì0. On June 20, in the first game of a doubleheader, he held the Angels to one run over 10 innings but received a no-decision in a 12-inning, 2‚Äì1 defeat. John was 6‚Äì11 on September 1, but he won his last three decisions to finish the season 9‚Äì11. In one of those wins, on September 19, he allowed eight hits but no runs in a 7‚Äì0 victory over the Kansas City Royals. In 33 starts, John had a 3.25 ERA, 128 strikeouts, 90 walks, and 230 hits allowed in innings. In 1970, John got the Opening Day start but struggled, giving up six runs (five earned) in innings as the Twins beat the White Sox 12‚Äì0 on April 7. In fact, he lost his first five starts before defeating the Orioles on April 30. On June 12, he allowed only two hits in a complete game shutout over the Senators, as the White Sox won the game 6‚Äì0. He lost four starts in a row after that game, then won his next five decisions. On July 26, he allowed seven hits in a complete game shutout of the Tigers, which the White Sox won 4‚Äì0. In the first game of a doubleheader against the Yankees on August 23, he allowed only four hits in a complete game shutout that the White Sox won 2‚Äì0. John finished the year with a 12‚Äì17 record. His 17 losses tied teammate Gerry Janeski for third in the AL, and teammate Joe Horlen was fifth with 16. John also finished fourth in walks (101, behind Sam McDowell's 131, Mickey Lolich's 109, and Jim Rooker's 102), and he led the AL in wild pitches, throwing what would be a career-high 17. His ERA was 3.27, he struck out 138 hitters, and he had fewer hits allowed (253) than innings pitched (). Johnny Sain became the White Sox' pitching coach in 1971, and he was determined to change John's pitching mechanics. This caused trouble for John, who had his highest ERA since 1964. Through his first 11 games, his ERA was 6.08, but he posted a 2.97 ERA in his last 27 games. In the first game of a doubleheader against the defending World Champion Orioles on May 31, he threw a shutout in a 1‚Äì0 victory. On June 17, he held the Twins to three runs over 10 innings. The White Sox pinch-hit for him in the 11th, took a 6‚Äì3 lead, then lost 7‚Äì6 after three relievers gave up four runs in the bottom of the inning. He struck out a season-high nine hitters on June 29 but also gave up four runs (two earned) in a 5‚Äì2 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. In 38 games (35 starts), he had a 13‚Äì16 record, a 3.61 ERA, three shutouts, 131 strikeouts, 58 walks, and 244 hits in innings pitched. His 16 losses tied him for seventh in the AL with Ray Culp and Dick Bosman. After the season, on December 2, he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers along with Steve Huntz for Dick Allen, a power-hitting infielder. =Los Angeles Dodgers (1972‚Äì1978)= 1972‚Äì1974: The First Years John got along much better with Red Adams, the Dodger pitching coach, who encouraged John to use his soft fastball instead of trying to rely on his breaking pitches. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get plenty of batters out with that,‚Äù Adams said, praising the movement John put on his fastball. He gave up 13 hits and five runs on July 12 but was allowed to complete the game as the Dodgers beat the Philadelphia Phillies by a score of 9‚Äì5. Six days later, he pitched nine innings and only allowed one unearned run but settled for a no-decision, as the Dodgers defeated the New York Mets 2‚Äì1 in the 10th inning. On August 3, he gave up only three hits in a complete game, 3‚Äì0 shutout victory over the San Francisco Giants. Though John made 29 starts for the Dodgers in 1972, his season ended prematurely on September 23, due to an injury suffered in a game against the Giants. John singled against Frank Reberger in the third, advanced to second on a walk, and attempted to score on a single by Bill Buckner. As he slid into home, though (where he was called out), he jammed his throwing elbow hard into the ground, dislodging bone chips. He pitched more innings before getting taken out of the game, but took the remainder of the year off and had surgery to clear out the elbow. John had an 11‚Äì5 record, a 2.89 ERA, 117 strikeouts, 40 walks, and 172 hits allowed in innings. His .688 winning percentage was fifth in the National League (NL). In his first start of 1973 for the Dodgers, on April 8 against the San Diego Padres, John threw scoreless ball for innings, earning the win in a 4‚Äì0 victory. On June 18, he allowed eight runs in only one inning as the Dodgers were defeated 16‚Äì3 by the Phillies, but only two were earned (the rest were due to a Ron Cey error). He held the Chicago Cubs to five hits on July 13 in a 5‚Äì0, complete game shutout victory. On August 24, he had a better start against the Phillies, limiting them to three hits in a 3‚Äì0, complete game shutout victory. That game was the first of six straight decisions John would win through the end of the season. With a 16‚Äì7 record at season's end, John tied with three others for seventh in the NL in wins and led the NL with a .696 winning percentage. He recorded 116 strikeouts, 50 walks, and 202 hits allowed in 218 innings of work. John began 1974 as the Dodgers' number two starter, behind Don Sutton in the rotation. He threw a shutout against the Padres in his first start on April 6, then threw eight shutout innings against the Atlanta Braves four days later. On April 25, he held the Phillies to four hits and no runs in a complete game shutout that the Dodgers won 1‚Äì0. The win was his fifth in five games. After a loss on May 5, he won five decisions in a row, not losing again until June 18. From June 28 through July 7, he won three straight starts. 1974‚Äì1975: The Injury, the Surgery, the Recovery In the middle of an excellent 1974 season, John had a 13‚Äì3 record as the Dodgers were en route to their first NL pennant in eight years. He led the NL in wins coming into the All-Star break but was left off the roster, as the Dodgers already had Andy Messersmith and Mike Marshall on the team. \\"If I don't belong on the team, there is no justice in baseball,\\" John said on July 17. \\"It really sets you back. I've had a great year, I've worked hard and yet I can't even get picked for the All-Star team.\\" Bigger disappointment followed for John in that evening's game against the Montreal Expos. With the Dodgers leading 4‚Äì0 in the third inning, John tried to throw a sinking fastball to Hal Breeden. Suddenly, he felt the \\"strangest sensation I had ever known...right at the point where I put force on the pitch, the point where my arm is back and bent, something happened,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúIt felt as if I had left my arm someplace else. It was as if my body continued to go forward and my left arm had just flown out to right field, independent of the rest of me.‚Äù John had permanently damaged the ulnar collateral ligament in his pitching arm; he threw one more pitch before having manager Walt Alston remove him from the game. Initially, he was uncertain how serious the injury was; Dr. Frank Jobe, the Dodgers' team physician, advised John to rest the arm for a few days and treat it with ice. After a month, though, the injury had not improved. John attempted to pitch batting practice in New York, and when he failed to get much velocity on his pitches, he told Alston he was likely done for the season. In 22 starts for the Dodgers, he had a 13‚Äì3 record, a 2.59 ERA, 78 strikeouts, 42 walks, and 133 hits allowed in 153 innings. He also threw three shutouts and led the NL with a .813 winning percentage. With his career in doubt, John decided to allow Dr. Jobe to attempt a revolutionary surgical operation. This operation, now known as Tommy John surgery, replaced the ligament in the elbow of John's pitching arm with a tendon from his right forearm. Though the procedure had actually been performed on other people before, it was usually conducted on wrists and hands; John was the first baseball pitcher to have it done on his elbow. The surgery was performed on September 25, 1974, and it took four hours; Dr. Jobe made holes in the humerus and ulna bones of John's left arm and used anchors to insert the tendon in what was roughly a figure-eight shape. It seemed unlikely John would ever be able to pitch again, as most pitchers in the past who had surgery on their arms never were effective again. Jobe gave the operation 100-1 odds of being successful, but John had it anyway, as his other option was to start working at a friend's car dealership in Terre Haute. The recovery was long and slow. Initially, John's left hand was shriveled and he lacked feeling in several of his fingers, due to damage to the ulnar nerve; Dr. Jobe performed a second procedure to reroute the nerve that was necessary to John's full recovery. His arm was in a cast until January 1975, and once it was removed, John began performing exercises seven days a week to rebuild strength in the arm. He attended spring training with the Dodgers in 1975, by which point he had recovered the full range of motion of his arm but still lacked feeling in some of his fingers, preventing him from gripping the ball properly. For six weeks, he would tape the fingers that lacked feeling to ones that had it, then feebly throw balls against a wall for a while. John also worked with teammate and pitcher Mike Marshall, who had a Ph.D. in kinesiology and who was said to know how to help pitchers recover from injuries, on learning a different grip to use while pitching. In the midst of doubts about his ability to come back, John kept repeating Luke 1:37 to himself: \\"For with God, nothing shall be impossible.\\" Finally, in June, feeling came back to John's injured fingers. His velocity started to improve in July, and by September, he was healthy enough to pitch in an off-season instructional league in Arizona. Beginning September 29, John made five appearances with the team, throwing as many as seven innings by his final one. 1976‚Äì1978: The Comeback John returned to the Dodgers in 1976, the fourth starter in their rotation after spending all of the previous year on the disabled list. On April 16, he made his comeback, against the Braves at Fulton County Stadium. \\"I was back in my office,\\" John later described the day. \\"I took a year-and-a-half hiatus to, you know, go abroad and study and learn the dynamics of nuclear fission, or something like that. I did all that, and now I was back at work.\\" Though he allowed three runs in five innings and took the loss, it was the first time any pitcher had started a game following UCL reconstruction surgery. Darrell Evans of the Braves called the return a \\"miracle.\\" Soon, players and writers were referring to John as \\"The Bionic Man.\\" Five days after the Atlanta game, in a 1‚Äì0 loss to the Houston Astros, John threw seven scoreless innings. On June 13, he threw his first complete game since the injury, also against the Expos, whom he held to three runs in a 6‚Äì3 victory. He threw a four-hit shutout against the Padres on July 23 and a 10-hit shutout against the Cincinnati Reds on September 14. John would make 31 starts for the Dodgers in 1976, posting a 10‚Äì10 record, a 3.09 ERA, 91 strikeouts, 61 walks, and 207 hits allowed in 207 innings pitched. In recognition of John's accomplishments, the Sporting News awarded him its NL Comeback Player of the Year Award, and John also won the Fred Hutchinson Award, presented annually to a player who shows outstanding character and courage. \\"I thank God every day for being able to pitch,\\" John told The New York Times after his comeback. \\"If I win, thanks for letting me win, if I lose, thanks for letting me lose because that's better than being on the sidelines.‚Äù Dissatisfied with his contract entering spring training in 1977, John threatened to file for free agency after the season. However, he ultimately signed a two-year, $400,000 contract to stay with the Dodgers. Through June 12, he had a 6‚Äì4 record and a 4.08 ERA. Starting June 18, John won 10 consecutive decisions, not losing another ballgame until August 19 against the Cubs. He had a 1.32 ERA during the winning streak, and his ERA from June 18 to the end of the season was 2.19. He threw a complete game shutout against the Padres on July 16, allowing just four hits in a 1‚Äì0 victory. On August 8, he held the defending World Series champion Reds to two hits in a 4‚Äì0 complete game shutout victory. He threw a shutout in his next start too, allowing four hits in an 11‚Äì0 victory over Atlanta on August 13. John won 20 games for the first time in his career in 1977, his 14th season in Major League Baseball, finishing with a 20‚Äì7 record. He ranked among the NL leaders in wins (third, tied with Bob Forsch, Rick Reuschel, and John Candelaria) and ERA (2.78, fifth). John finished 12th in NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting and was second in voting for the NL Cy Young Award, bested by Steve Carlton, who led the NL with 23 wins. With a 98‚Äì64 record, the Dodgers won the NL West. For John, who had been injured when the Dodgers won the division in 1974, it was his first chance to pitch in the playoffs. He started Game 1 of the NL Championship Series (NLCS) against the Phillies, but only lasted innings. He gave up four unearned runs, the result of two errors by Bill Russell, the Dodger shortstop. That was the only Dodger loss of the series, though, and John won the last game of the series four days later, allowing seven hits but one run in rainy weather as the Dodgers beat the Phillies 4‚Äì1 in Game 4. In both of his NLCS starts, John gave up fewer runs than his opponent on the mound, Carlton. The Dodgers faced the New York Yankees in the 1977 World Series; John started Game 3 but gave up five runs (four earned) over six innings, including three in the first inning, as the Yankees won 5‚Äì3. Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda said John would start Game 7 if the series went that far, but the Yankees clinched it in six games, making Game 3 John's only appearance of the loss. John won all four of his starts in April 1978, throwing complete games in the last three. On May 17, he held the Pittsburgh Pirates to four hits and one run, striking out seven in a complete game, 10‚Äì1 victory. In the second game of a doubleheader against the Houston Astros on July 8, he relieved Bob Welch in the sixth inning and threw four shutout innings, picking up the victory in Los Angeles's 7‚Äì5 triumph. With a 10‚Äì6 record and a 3.80 ERA halfway through the season, John was named to the NL All-Star team, his first selection to an All-Star Team in 10 years and the first of three in a row for him. In a complete game against Montreal on August 29, he held the Expos to one unearned run in a complete game, 4‚Äì1 victory. In 33 games (30 starts), he had a 17‚Äì10 record, a 3.30 ERA, 124 strikeouts, 53 walks, and 230 hits allowed in 213 innings. He finished eighth in Cy Young Award voting. For the second year in a row, the Dodgers won the NL West and faced the Phillies in the NLCS. The Game 2 starter, John threw a four-hit shutout as the Dodgers won 4‚Äì0. After the Phillies won Game 3, the Dodgers won Game 4 to set up another playoff rematch, this time with the Yankees in the 1978 World Series. John started Game 1, giving up five runs (only three of which were earned) in innings but earning the win in Los Angeles's 11‚Äì5 victory. In Game 4, he had held the Yankees to two runs (one earned) through seven innings before getting removed in the eighth after giving up a leadoff single to Paul Blair. Blair went on to score, and John got a no-decision in a 10-inning, 4‚Äì3 loss. For the second year in a row, New York won the series in six games. With his contract up at the end of the season, John became a free agent. On November 21, he signed a three-year, $1.4 million contract with the New York Yankees. Though the Royals and the Reds had both offered more money, John chose the Yankees because, as he said, \\"I like to play for a winner.\\" =New York Yankees (1st Stint: 1979‚Äì1982)= John won his first nine decisions as a Yankee, including shutout victories on April 12 and May 20, 1979. Through July 6, he was leading the AL in wins and had a 13‚Äì3 record, as he had five years earlier with the Dodgers, before the surgery. That day, he threw a complete game shutout in a 3‚Äì0 victory over the Athletics. He held the Indians to three hits on September 19, getting removed with two outs in the ninth after allowing a single to Toby Harrah but still earning the win as the Yankees defeated the Indians 2‚Äì0. John finished the year with a 21‚Äì9 record, 111 strikeouts (it was the last season he would have more than 100 strikeouts), 65 walks, and 268 hits allowed in innings pitched. He was second to teammate Ron Guidry in ERA (2.96; Guidry's was 2.78), and he was second to Mike Flanagan in wins (Flanagan had 23). John finished 22nd in MVP voting and was the runner-up in Cy Young voting again, this time to Flanagan. After taking a no-decision in his first start of the 1980 season, John won seven starts in a row, not losing until May 20. From June 30 through July 22, he won five starts in a row, and from August 29 through September 13, he won four starts in a row. John pitched particularly well against the White Sox, throwing shutouts all three times he faced them, including a two-hit performance on April 16 when he retired 13 hitters in a row at one point. On May 11, he held the Twins to six hits in a 5‚Äì0 shutout victory. He allowed just two hits on June 6 in a 3‚Äì0 shutout victory over the Seattle Mariners. On July 22, he held Milwaukee to four hits in the first game of a doubleheader, throwing a shutout as the Yankees defeated the Brewers 3‚Äì0. No other AL pitcher would win 20 games in back-to-back years until Roger Clemens did it in 1986 and '87. In 36 starts, John won a career-high 22 games while losing nine, recording a 3.43 ERA, 78 strikeouts, 56 walks, and 270 hits allowed in innings pitched. His six shutouts led the AL, the first time in 13 years he led a league in that category. He tied with Mike Norris for second in the AL in wins, behind Steve Stone's 25. John finished fourth in Cy Young Award voting. The Yankees won the AL East with a 103‚Äì59 record, and John started Game 3, with the Yankees facing elimination by the Royals after losing the first two games. With the Yankees leading 2‚Äì1 in the seventh, John retired the first two batters but was replaced by Rich Gossage after giving up a double to Willie Wilson; Gossage gave up a home run to George Brett a couple batters later, and the Yankees lost 4‚Äì2, though John was not credited with a decision. John in 1981 \\"I'd like to pitch as long as I can effectively do the job,\\" John told The New York Times during 1981 spring training. \\"I think I can start another two or three years. I also think I could pitch out of the bullpen for two or three years a la Steve Hamilton and Jim Kaat. I think I could do that effectively - as long as somebody would want to pay me to do it. Everybody needs lefthanded pitching, especially in the bullpen.\\" He made his first Opening Day start for the Yankees on April 9, allowing three runs (two earned) in eight innings as the Yankees beat the Texas Rangers by a score of 10‚Äì3. His season was interrupted by the 1981 Major League Baseball strike and also by an incident that occurred on August 13. While the John family was at their vacation home on the Jersey shore, John's two-year-old son Travis toppled out a window and fell three stories onto the hood of a parked car. He was in a coma for about two weeks. John was warming up for a game against the Tigers when he found out the news. He went on national television asking people to pray for his son, and he received permission from the Yankees to stay in New York with his son while he recovered, pitching only home games in the immediate aftermath of the accident while staying at the Grand Hyatt Hotel near the N.Y.U. Medical Center. Hundreds of letters and cards poured in from well-wishers, including people who wrote that they hated the Yankees and George Steinbrenner but were rooting for Travis to pull through. President Ronald Reagan sent Travis a get-well card, as did former Presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. Frank Sinatra sent a telegram. Travis ultimately made a full recovery; he threw out the first pitch at a playoff game against the Brewers later that year, and by 1988, he was playing Little League Baseball with his brothers. By August 29, John was back to pitching road games for the Yankees. With a 9‚Äì5 record on September 14, he finished the year on a three- game losing streak, though that included a September 25 start against the Orioles where he allowed one run in a complete game, 1‚Äì0 loss. In 20 starts, John had a 9‚Äì8 record, 50 strikeouts, 39 walks, and 135 hits allowed in innings pitched. His 2.63 ERA ranked fourth in the AL. Though he had led the AL in shutouts the previous year, he had zero in 1981. Because of the strike, MLB divided the season into two halves and added an extra playoff round, the Division Series, in which the first half and second-half winners of the two divisions would play each other. The Yankees had the AL East's best record in the first half and faced the Brewers in the Division Series. With the Yankees up two games to none in the best of five series, John started Game 3 but gave up five runs in seven innings, taking the loss in a 5‚Äì3 defeat. The Brewers won Game 4 as well, but the Yankees won Game 5 to clinch the series victory. John allowed just one run against the Athletics in Game 1 of the ALCS, earning the win, but he was replaced on the mound by Ron Davis after the sixth inning because his right ankle was bothering him. Though he felt good enough to remain in the game, Yankee manager Bob Lemon did not want to risk further injury: \\"If something happened, I'd be worried about it all winter,\\" Lemon said. He would not get a chance to pitch again in the series, as New York defeated Oakland in three games. The 1981 World Series was the third Dodger- Yankee World Series John had been a part of, though it was his first with New York. He picked up the win in his Game 2 start, retiring the first 12 batters he faced and throwing seven shutout innings in a 3‚Äì0 triumph. In Game 4, he was sent in during the seventh inning of a 6‚Äì6 tie because the bases were loaded, and John had a propensity for inducing ground balls, which would have likely resulted in an out and possibly a double play. Instead, Steve Yeager hit a sacrifice fly against him, and Davey Lopes added an RBI single; the runs did not count on John's record, but the Yankees lost the game 8‚Äì7. With the Yankees down to the Dodgers 3 games to 2, John started Game 6. He held the Dodgers to one run over four innings but was pinch-hit for by Bobby Murcer in the fourth. \\"I was trying to get a run ahead so I could get to the seventh inning and bring Goose in,\\" explained Lemon. The Yankees failed to score that inning, and the relievers did not pitch well, enabling the Dodgers to win the game and the series. Will Grimsley of the Associated Press called the decision to pull John \\"a glaring error.\\" After the 1981 season, John won the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award, presented by Phi Delta Theta to \\"the Major League Baseball Player who best exemplifies the spirit and character of Brother Lou Gehrig, both on and off the field.\\" The Yankees and John nearly went to arbitration after 1981 but ultimately agreed to a two-year, $1.7 million contract. \\"I'm glad to get it over with and get it put to bed,\\" John said after signing. \\"It's like in a marriage. If you have an argument and patch it up fast, it's okay. But the longer you let it go, the harder it is to reconcile it.\\" Through June 25 of 1982, though his record was just 5‚Äì7, he had a 2.95 ERA. From then through July 5, he posted a 6.67 ERA in six games (five starts). John clashed with the Yankees' front office over the move and also over their failure to give him a $200,000 loan that was promised in his contract; in early August, the pitcher threatened to start a breach of contract case that would sever his Yankee contract. He did not stay in the bullpen long, as doubleheaders forced the Yankees to require another starter and John pitched well upon his return to the rotation. However, on August 31, he was traded to the California Angels for three minor league players who would be named later. In 30 games (26 starts) for the Yankees, John had posted a 10‚Äì10 record, a 3.66 ERA, 54 strikeouts, 34 walks, and 190 hits allowed in innings, throwing two shutouts as well. =California Angels (1982‚Äì1985) and Oakland Athletics (1985)= California was interested in John because it was contending for the AL West title. In his first start with the team on September 3, John held the Brewers to two runs (neither earned) in a complete game, 5‚Äì2 victory. John made seven starts, posting a 4‚Äì2 record, a 3.86 ERA, 14 strikeouts, five walks, and 49 hits allowed in 35 innings pitched as the Angels clinched the AL West. His combined totals between New York and California were a 14‚Äì12 record, a 3.69 ERA, 68 strikeouts, 39 walks, and 239 hits allowed in innings. John started Game 1 of the ALCS against the Brewers, allowing three runs in a complete game, 8‚Äì3 victory. When Game 4 arrived, instead of starting 13-game winner Ken Forsch, manager Gene Mauch opted to start John on three days rest. John gave up six runs (four earned) over innings as the Brewers defeated the Angels 9‚Äì5; the Brewers went on to win the series in five games. California's number two starter in 1983, John had a 6‚Äì2 record and a 3.43 ERA through June 9. Thereafter, he only won five of 16 decisions, and his ERA was 4.84. Twice, he had extended outings for the Angels. In the second game of a doubleheader against Oakland on July 30, he gave up two runs over 12 innings but took the loss when Rickey Henderson had an RBI single in the 12th to bring home the go- ahead run. Yet that was not his longest outing of the year; he pitched 13 shutout innings on September 14 against the Royals. California never scored, however, and the Angels lost in the 14th once relief pitchers entered the game. In 34 starts, John had an 11‚Äì13 record, a 4.33 ERA (the highest it had ever been in his career), 65 strikeouts, and 49 walks in innings. He led the AL in hits allowed with 287, and 1983 would be the last time he would top 200 innings in a season. In 1984, John had a 2.48 ERA through June 2 but a 6.13 ERA thereafter. In the second game of a doubleheader against Boston on July 8, though, he threw a complete-game shutout in a 4‚Äì0 victory. He was removed from the rotation at the beginning of September when Geoff Zahn came off the disabled list, though he returned for two starts later in the month after Bruce Kison was removed. In 32 games (29 starts), he had a 7‚Äì13 record, a 4.52 ERA, 47 strikeouts, 56 walks, and 223 hits allowed in innings pitched. With the Angels in 1985, John posted a 4.70 ERA in 12 games, only six of which were starts. In May, the Angels opted to use only four starters for much of the month, and John was the odd man out. On June 19, the Angels released him. The Oakland Athletics signed him nearly a month later, on July 12; John made three rehab starts in the minor leagues before debuting with Oakland on the 26th. He won that game, pitching six innings and allowing one run (unearned) against the Brewers in a 4‚Äì3 triumph. Facing the Yankees on August 27, he threw seven shutout innings, allowing just three hits and earning the victory in a 3‚Äì0 triumph. Those were his only wins with Oakland, though; he lost his next five decisions and finished with a 2‚Äì6 record and a 6.19 ERA in 11 starts. His combined totals for the season were a 4‚Äì10 record, a 5.53 ERA, 25 strikeouts, 28 walks, and 117 hits allowed in innings pitched. After the season, he became a free agent. =New York Yankees (2nd Stint: 1986‚Äì1989)= John went unsigned to begin 1986, and it looked like his career might be over. He attended spring training with the Yankees, though, and though he did not make the roster, the Yankees informed him that they would consider him if they needed pitchers later in the year. Injuries to Ed Whitson and John Montefusco in May prompted the Yankees to re-sign their former pitcher. Inserted into the rotation, he won his first three decisions for the Yankees before losing a game on June 7. However, on June 12, he was placed on the 21-day disabled list with a strained left Achilles tendon; the injury kept him out of action until August 8. On August 24, rookie Mark McGwire of the Athletics had two hits off him. McGwire's father happened to be John's dentist, and John told reporters, \\"When your dentist's kid starts hitting you, it's time to retire!\\" He went on to pitch three more seasons, however. Against the Mariners in the first game of a doubleheader on August 30, he took the loss but allowed just one run in eight innings in what would be his last start of the year. On September 4, he fell down while warming up on muddy soil and injured his left thumb while trying to break his fall, ending his season. In 13 games (10 starts), he had a 5‚Äì3 record, a 2.93 ERA, 28 strikeouts, 15 walks, and 73 hits allowed in innings pitched. During the 1986 season, John had agreed to become the pitching coach for the University of North Carolina (UNC) later in the year, meaning he would likely retire. However, he resigned from the UNC position on November 21 due to \\"irreconcilable differences\\" with head coach Mike Roberts. After that, he signed a contract for $350,000, provided he made the team out of spring training. On April 19 and April 26, 1987, he threw seven shutout innings in consecutive starts, only allowing one hit on the 26th in a 14‚Äì2 win over Cleveland. Pitching on three days' rest on August 8, he threw a two-hit shutout against the Tigers, the last he would throw in his career. On October 2, he gave up just one run in a complete game, 3‚Äì1 triumph over Baltimore. In 33 starts, John had a 13‚Äì6 record, a 4.03 ERA, 63 strikeouts, 47 walks, and 212 hits allowed in innings pitched. After Phil Niekro's retirement, John became the oldest player in the major leagues in 1988; he turned 45 on May 22. On April 27, he held the Royals to two hits and no runs in innings, though Kansas City ultimately won 3‚Äì1. For the first time since 1963 (a year he only made three starts), he did not complete a game; his longest outing came on May 14, when he allowed two runs over innings in a 6‚Äì2 victory over the Angels. In 35 games (32 starts), he had a 9‚Äì8 record, a 4.49 ERA, 81 strikeouts, 46 walks, and 221 hits allowed in innings. Bill Madden of the New York Daily News speculated that John, a ground-ball pitcher, suffered from late-season injuries to Yankee infielders Willie Randolph and Mike Pagliarulo, their replacements not being quite as capable fielders. Ten times, he left a game after at least five innings with a lead and received a no-decision, often due to runners he had left on base scoring when relievers replaced him. At 45, he was the only Yankee starter to go the full year without missing time due to injury. By 1989, John was doing a \\"ten-part cardiovascular and muscular endurance program\\" which Jeff Mangold, the Yankees' former strength coach, had helped him develop. At 45, he was the Opening Day starter for the Yankees, his first Opening Day start for the ballclub in eight years, allowing two runs in seven innings and outpitching 1988 AL Cy Young Award winner Frank Viola as the Yankees defeated the Twins 4‚Äì2 on April 4. With the start, John matched Deacon McGuire's record for most MLB seasons played with 26, a record that would later be broken by Nolan Ryan.Michael X. Ferraro and John Veneziano (2007). Numbelivable! Chicago: Triumph Books, p. 157. On April 27, he held the Royals to two runs over eight-plus innings, picking up his 288th (and final) victory. He lost four games in May, though, allowing five or more runs in each of his outings. On May 25, he allowed five runs in innings against the Angels, receiving a no-decision in an 8‚Äì6 Yankee victory. That game would be his last appearance for the Yankees, who released him at the end of the month. In 10 starts for New York, John had a 2‚Äì7 record, a 5.80 ERA, 18 strikeouts, 22 walks, and 87 hits allowed in innings. Career statistics John finished his career with a 288‚Äì231 record, a 3.34 ERA, 2,245 strikeouts, 1,259 walks, and 4,783 hits allowed in innings pitched. After pitching for 26 years, he ranked among baseball's all-time leaders in wins (26th), losses (19th), innings pitched (20th), hits allowed (10th), earned runs allowed (1,749, 16th), games started (700, eighth), shutouts (46, 26th), batters faced (19,692, 18th), and wild pitches (187, 17th). He had 188 career no decisions, an all-time MLB record among starting pitchers (dating back to at least 1908). Of Hall-of- Fame-eligible pitchers since 1900, Roger Clemens (whose career is tainted by steroids allegations) is the only one with more wins than John not to be elected to the Hall of Fame. Though John was nearing the 300 win club at the end of his career, he had not necessarily intended to pitch long enough to reach the milestone. \\"You'd like to stay around long enough to win 300, but that's not the ultimate goal for me,\\" he said in 1987. \\"My kids are getting older, and it's tougher for us to move as much as we used to. I decided that wherever we go, we go as a group. The kids have a lifetime contract with us.\\" After the Yankees released him in 1989, he planned to keep working out and throwing in case another ballclub signed him; none did, however, and the season was his last. Hall of Fame candidacy John first appeared on the Baseball Hall of Fame ballot in 1995. He earned 21.3% of the vote, but 75% is required for induction. Over the next several years, his vote totals rose and fell, but through 2008, he had never received more than 29.6% of the vote. In 2009, in his 15th and final year of eligibility for election on the main ballot, John received a career-high 31.7% of the vote, but this was still not enough for election. He could still enter the Hall if he were selected by the Modern Era Subcommittee of the Veterans Committee. John was announced as one of the finalists for the 2020 Modern Baseball Era ballot; however he was not one of the inductees. In a Yahoo Sports article in 2017, Chris Cwik discussed the pros and cons of John's Hall of Fame case. Pros Cwik mentioned were that his 111 Adjusted ERA+ was better than that of Sutton or Early Wynn (both Hall of Famers) and that his surgery has revolutionized the game. Cons were that he never led the league in wins or strikeouts or won a Cy Young Award, and his 288 wins and 3.34 ERA were more \\"borderline\\" Hall of Fame credentials. Craig Calcaterra of NBC Sports also did a pro-con analysis in 2019. On the pro side, Calcaterra noted that he was above average during his long career; on the con side, he too noted that John never led the league in wins or strikeouts, writing \\"John was simply not dominant in any way ‚Äî his ERA+ was a not-very- Hall-of-Famer‚Äì111 ‚Äî even if he was pretty darn dependable and even if he ate innings like crazy.\\" Analyzing John's wins above replacement value on several statistical sites (ranging from over 60 to 79.1), Brett Ballantini of Sports Illustrated said in 2020, \\"This is a guy who, irrespective of any surgery named after him, is a guy whose baseball career alone simply says he's a Hall of Famer.\\" In a 2016 interview, John pointed out that his 164 wins following the surgery were one shy of the amount that Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax had over his entire career. Impact of Tommy John surgery John went on to win 164 games after having the surgery, 40 more than before. His successful comeback proved once and for all that baseball players could still be successful after undergoing major surgery. In 2012, Lindsey Berra of ESPN noted that roughly one in seven major league pitchers had undergone Tommy John surgery at some point in their careers. \\"It's become an accepted side effect of the job,\\" said George Paletta, team physician for the St. Louis Cardinals. Doug Miller of MLB.com wrote that \\"baseball history was altered ‚Äì some would say saved ‚Äì forever\\" when John returned from his recovery, observing that \\"Today, the tearing of a pitcher's ulnar collateral ligament is no longer a career-ending calamity.\\" ESPN personality Dan Patrick and longtime baseball commentator Bob Costas discussed the impact that Tommy John surgery has had on the game, stating in 2012 that there could be a case for John being awarded the Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award. The initial Tommy John surgery, John's subsequent return to pitching success, and his relationship with Dr. Jobe was the subject of an ESPN 30 for 30 Shorts documentary in 2013. Pitching style John was a soft throwing sinkerball pitcher whose technique resulted in batters hitting numerous ground balls which often induced double plays. In 1980, Dave Anderson of The New York Times estimated that his fastball was about 92 miles per hour. \\"It sinks sharply away from right-handed batters, and it sinks into left-handed batters,\\" he wrote. Rick Cerone, who caught John with the Yankees, said of the fastball, \\"It looks like a real good pitch to hit until about the last 10 feet, then it sinks about two or three inches outside. When the batters try to pull it, they just hit these little grounders.\\" At the start of his major league career, John threw just a fastball and a curveball. The Indians tried to get him to throw a slider in 1964, but John struggled with it and went back to throwing two pitches later that year. By 1980, he was throwing the slider. He also threw three different curveballs by then, classifying them by their release point: \\"Each one breaks differently, down or flat or in between, depending on how you spin it.\\" In 1972, he added a screwball, which he used as a changeup to complement his repertoire. His arm lagged behind the rest of his body when he threw pitches, a technique that put extra stress on it, which contributed to his UCL injury in 1974. John tried to emulate Whitey Ford's pitching style, and he studied books on pitching by Christy Mathewson, Bob Feller, and Bob Shaw. Broadcasting Between his stints with the Angels and Athletics in 1985, John served as color commentator alongside Tim McCarver for a game between the White Sox and the Athletics on ABC's Monday Night Baseball on June 24. Following his career, John did broadcasting for several different teams. From 1994 through 1996, he served as a broadcaster for the Twins. In 1997, John served as the color commentator for the Charlotte Knights of the International League, also performing a public relations role for the ballclub. John returned to New York in 1998 to do commentary on select games during WPIX's final year of broadcasting Yankee baseball. On June 26, 2008, he guest-hosted the Mike and Mike ESPN Radio program. Coaching John started his coaching at Furman University. During the 2002 season John served as the pitching coach for the Harrisburg Senators of the Eastern League before managing the Maryville franchise in the Arizona Fall League. 2003 he was promoted to Triple-A Edmonton Trappers. While working a New York Yankees Fantasy Camp in January 2004 team owner George Steinbrenner asked John to return to the Yankees organization as a roving instructor and manager for the Staten Island Yankees that season, though under contract with the Montreal Expos the Yankees were given permission to interview John for the new role. On December 17, 2006, John was named manager of the Bridgeport Bluefish in the Atlantic League. The fifth manager in team history, he compiled a 159176 won-lost record in two-and-a-half seasons with Bridgeport. John resigned on July 8, 2009, to pursue a \\"non-baseball position\\" with Sportable Scoreboards; Frank Boulton, the team owner and CEO, publicly thanked John for his contributions. While still managing the Bluefish, he became the spokesman for Tommy John's Go-Flex, a joint cream for older athletes manufactured by New Vitality. Personal life George Vecsey of The New York Times described John as \\"a churchgoer, a good-natured family man.\\" On July 13, 1970, Tommy married the former Sally Simmons. They are the parents of four children: Tamara, Tommy III, Travis, and Taylor. In 2014, John moved to California with his girlfriend, Cheryl Zeldin. In 1998, Tamara John married Patrick Mannelly, who went on to become a long snapper for the Chicago Bears. The two met at Duke University/ As a 10-year-old in 1992, Taylor's singing and acting talents landed him a role in Les Mis√©rables on Broadway. He also played Little League Baseball, as did his brothers. On March 9, 2010, Taylor died at the age of 28 as the result of a seizure and heart failure apparently due to an overdose of prescription drugs. \\"He was the greatest kid in the world, but he would get into these panic spells and deep abysses,‚Äù John said of Taylor. ‚ÄúHe was wired different than the rest of us.‚Äù John has started the \\"Let's Do It\\" Foundation, dedicated to raising awareness about suicides and preventing them. John's oldest son, Tommy III, played baseball for the Furman University Paladins. He was a 4-year letterman for the Paladins, leading the team in complete games as a pitcher in 1997 (3 games) and in home runs (9) in 1999, a year in which he was named an All-Southern Conference player. In 2000, he became one of three players in the history of Furman's varsity baseball team to hit for the cycle, doing so on April 1 against the Appalachian State Mountaineers. After graduating from Furman, he spent two seasons in the independent minor leagues as a pitcher for the Tyler Roughnecks and Schaumburg Flyers. John is a chiropractor and went on to write a book, Minimize Injury, Maximize Performance: A Sports Parent's Survival Guide, which discusses the injury risk associated with young athletes specializing in one specific sport and suggests ways to prevent youth from ever having to undergo major sports-related surgery, such as Tommy John surgery. John's hometown of Terre Haute, Indiana, presented him a key to the city on September 1, 1989, and Indiana governor Evan Bayh presented him with the Sagamore of the Wabash, Indiana's highest honor. On October 24, 2013, the Terre Haute Parks Department honored John by renaming Spencer Field after him. The complex was the site of John's last non- professional game in 1961, when he was a member of the Terre Haute Gerstmeyer High School Black Cats. John eventually overcame his stuttering problem and earned a reputation as one of baseball's most talkative players. ‚ÄúAsk Tommy John what time it is, and he'll tell you how to make a watch,‚Äù said Lemon. Following his career, he became a motivational speaker. He has no relation to the Tommy John Underwear company and considered suing the founder over the use of his name but abandoned the idea after attorneys wanted $250,000 to represent him. As of 2019, he was no longer watching baseball, considering the game unrecognizable. He was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary's Shrine of the Eternals in 2018.\\"Shrine of the Eternals ‚Äì Inductees\\". Baseball Reliquary. Retrieved August 14, 2019.

The bulk of Kamandi's appearances occurred in the comic series Kamandi: The Last Boy on Earth, which ran from 1972 to 1978. Kamandi is a young hero in a post-apocalyptic future. After a huge event called \\"The Great Disaster\\", humans have been reduced back to savagery in a world ruled by intelligent, highly evolved animals. Publication history =Creators= DC editor Carmine Infantino had tried to acquire the license to publish Planet of the Apes comic books. When this failed to happen, he asked Jack Kirby for a series with a similar concept. Kirby had not seen the films but he knew the rough outline and he had also created a very similar story, \\"The Last Enemy!\\", in Harvey Comics' Alarming Tales that predated the original Planet of the Apes novel. He also had an unused comic strip he created in 1956, titled Kamandi of the Caves. Kirby brought all those elements together to create Kamandi. Although his initial plan was to not work on the comic books themselves, the cancellation of Forever People freed him up to do so. =The series= The Kamandi series was launched in October-November 1972, and was written and drawn by Jack Kirby. The book went to a monthly publishing schedule quickly, a sign of its early popularity. Kirby provided art and story through the comic's 37th issue, in January 1976. Kirby also drew issues #38 through #40, although they were scripted by Gerry Conway. Kirby subsequently left DC, but the series continued, initially written by Conway and drawn by Chic Stone. Later issues were alternately written by Paul Levitz, Dennis O'Neil, David Anthony Kraft, Elliot S. Maggin, and Jack C. Harris, with art by Pablo Marcos, Keith Giffen, and Dick Ayers. It was canceled during the \\"DC Implosion\\" of 1978, despite respectable sales figures. The final published issue was #59, cover-dated September-October 1978. Two additional issues, completed but not released, were included in Cancelled Comic Cavalcade #2.Cancelled Comic Cavalcade #2 (Fall 1978) at the Grand Comics Database =Entering the DC Universe= During Kirby's run on the book, Steve Sherman indicated in the letters column that the series was connected to Kirby's contemporary OMAC series, which was set sometime prior to the Great Disaster. The only explicit connection to the DC Universe occurs in issue #29, where Kamandi discovers a group of apes who worship Superman's costume, and who speak of legends of Superman trying and failing to stop the Great Disaster. The story leaves it ambiguous whether the legends are true, although Kamandi believes Superman was real, and whether the costume is indeed Superman's. Various non-Kirby stories tie the series more explicitly to the DC Universe. Kamandi met Batman in The Brave and the Bold #120 (July 1975) and #157 (December 1979). Superman #295 (January 1976) establishes that the costume seen in issue #29 was indeed Superman's, and that Earth A.D. is an alternate future for Earth-One, distinct from that of the Legion of Super-Heroes. Issues #49-50 of the series establish that Kamandi's grandfather was the elderly Buddy Blank, hero of the OMAC series, and features a brief return of OMAC's satellite ally, Brother Eye. Kirby's Kamandi story in Cancelled Comic Cavalcade #2 guest stars The Sandman and establishes that Kamandi is Jed Walker. The 1975-1977 Hercules Unbound series and the OMAC backup stories in Kamandi and The Warlord tie OMAC to both the storyline of Hercules Unbound and to the Atomic Knights, indicating that the Great Disaster was the atomic war of 1986 that precipitated the events of the latter. Superman #295 (Jan. 1976) implied that the Great Disaster was a natural occurrence. DC Comics Presents #57 (May 1983) reveals that the events of the Atomic Knights stories were a fantasy in the mind of Gardner Grayle, but DC Comics Presents #64 and Crisis on Infinite Earths #2 make clear that Kamandi still existed in an alternate future of Earth-One. In the wake of the Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Great Disaster did not occur, and the boy who would have become Kamandi instead became Tommy Tomorrow. =Revival= In the aftermath of the Infinite Crisis limited series, a bunker named Command D has been built under the ruins of the city of Bl√ºdhaven. In early 2007, DC Nation house ads showed a partial picture of Darkseid and mention a \\"Great Disaster\\". Additional DC promotional art for the series Countdown show the Statue of Liberty in ruins, similar to Kamandi #1. Dan DiDio later revealed that the Statue's appearance in that teaser ad was a reference to the Sinestro Corps War. Throughout 2007, DC Comics contained continual references to a coming Great Disaster. In Countdown #31, Buddy Blank and his unnamed blond grandson are introduced into the storyline. As of Countdown #6, The Great Disaster is in its early stages on Earth-51 due to the outbreak of a virus, which is causing humans to develop animal-like features, and animals to develop humanoid features. In Countdown #5, the virus claims Earth-51's Buddy Blank's daughter, but his grandson is safe. Una, an alternate Earth's version of the Legion of Super-Heroes Triplicate Girl, gives him her Legion flight ring, which he uses to safely get him to Cadmus' \\"Command D\\" facility, which was used to control Brother Eye, and has the defenses necessary to protect them from the virus' victims. As he settles in, he hopes that his grandson can forgive him for making him \\"the last boy on Earth\\". In Countdown: Arena #2, an ape Starman from Earth-17 mentions he is attempting to form a truce between the forces of Kamandi and Ben Boxer, indicating a second variant Kamandi Earth, unlike Earth-51. Kamandi and The Demon appear in \\"Devil's Play\\" written by Joe Kubert and Brandon Vietti with art by Vietti, published in Joe Kubert Presents #6 (May 2013). =Final Crisis= Kamandi is seen in DC's Final Crisis limited series, a sequel to the earlier Crisis on Infinite Earths and Infinite Crisis. In the first issue he appears in what seems to be a time distortion, asking Anthro, the \\"first\\" boy on Earth, for the weapon the New God Metron gave him, a reference to the series' opening scene in which Anthro, like Prometheus, is given knowledge in the form of fire. He makes another appearance in the second issue as one of the captives of the evil New Gods alongside Batman, warning the detective character Dan Turpin that they are making slaves of them. In the final issue, he appears on Earth-51 after it has been reconstructed. =DC Rebirth= Cover of The Kamandi Challenge #2, art by Kenneth Rocafort. This 12-issue limited series brought Kamandi back to the DC Universe in 2017. As part of the DC Rebirth continuity and commemorating the 100th anniversary of Jack Kirby's birth, in January 2017 DC published the first number of The Kamandi Challenge, a 12-part limited series with each issue featuring a new creative team (a total of 12 writers and 12 artists for the miniseries), a concept loosely inspired on 1985's DC Challenge. Writers on the series included Dan Abnett, Peter Tomasi, Jimmy Palmiotti, James Tynion IV, Bill Willingham, Steve Orlando, Marguerite Bennett, Keith Giffen, Tom King, Greg Pak, Rob Williams and Gail Simone while artists were Dale Eaglesham, Neal Adams, Amanda Conner, Carlos D'Anda, Ivan Reis, Philip Tan, Dan Jurgens, Steve Rude, Kevin Eastman, Joe Prado, Walter Simonson and Ryan Sook. Fictional character biography Map of Earth A.D. from Kamandi #32 (1975) In the eponymous series, Kamandi is a teenage boy on a post-apocalyptic Earth which the textual narrative describes as \\"Earth A.D. (After Disaster)\\". The Earth has been ravaged by a mysterious calamity called the Great Disaster. The precise nature of the Great Disaster is never revealed in the original series, although it \\"had something to do with radiation\\" (in the series' letter column, Jack Kirby and his then- assistant Steve Sherman repeatedly asserted that the Great Disaster was not a nuclear war, a fact confirmed in issue #35). The Disaster wiped out human civilization and a substantial portion of the human population. A few isolated pockets of humanity survived in underground bunkers, while others quickly reverted to pre-technological savagery. Shortly before the Great Disaster, a scientist at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Dr. Michael Grant, developed a drug called Cortexin, which stimulated the reasoning abilities of animals. During the Great Disaster, Grant released the experimental animals affected by the drug, and dumped the Cortexin itself into the stream created by a broken water main. In the ensuing days, animals escaping from the National Zoo drank from that stream and became affected by the drug. By Kamandi's time, an unspecified period after the Great Disaster, the effects of Cortexin and the radiation unleashed by the Great Disaster itself had caused a wide variety of animals (most of them are descendants of escaped zoo animals following the disaster) including but not limited to barracudas, bats, cheetahs, coyotes, crocodiles, dogs, gophers, gorillas, kangaroos, leopards, lions, lizards, pumas, rats, sloths, tigers, and wolves, to become bipedal, humanoid, and sentient, possessing the power of speech. Others animals ranging from dolphins, killer whales, and snakes developed sentience, but retained more or less their original size and form. The newly intelligent animal species, equipped with weapons and technology salvaged from the ruins of human civilization, began to struggle for territory. Horses were apparently not affected, and serve as a means of transportation in the technologically impoverished world of Earth A.D. By this time, most surviving humans are acting bestial, with very limited reasoning ability. Most have only the most rudimentary ability to speak, although they can be trained. The precise cause of the loss of reasoning ability is ambiguous in the original series. The animals treat humans as beasts, using them for labor or as pets. Kamandi is the last survivor of the human outpost in the \\"Command D\\" bunker near what was once New York City. \\"Kamandi\\" is a corruption of \\"Command D\\"; it is unclear if Kamandi ever had any other name. Raised by his elderly grandfather, Kamandi has extensive knowledge of the pre-Disaster world, thanks to a library of microfilm and old videos, but he has spent most of his time inside the bunker, and is unaware of the state of the world outside. When his grandfather is killed by a wolf, Kamandi leaves the bunker in search of other human outposts. He soon discovers that the only other intelligent humans left on Earth are Ben Boxer and his friends Steve and Renzi, a trio of mutants genetically engineered to survive in Earth A.D. He also makes a number of animal friends including Dr. Canus, the canine scientist of Great Caesar (leader of the Tiger Empire) and Caesar's teenage son Tuftan. Later additions to the cast included the alien woman Pyra, the girl Spirit and the consulting detective Mylock Bloodstalker and his associate Doile. Even the most sympathetic animals, however, are nonplussed by Kamandi and Ben's ability to speak. Kamandi and his friends set out to explore the world of Earth A.D., in hopes of one day restoring humanity to sentience and civilization. Other versions =Elseworlds= The Elseworlds miniseries Kamandi: At Earth's End was issued in 1993, but had little relation to the Kirby comic except by name. This series was followed up by Superman: At Earth's End, both written by Tom Veitch. =Superman/Batman= In the third story arc of the Superman/Batman series, which showed the heroes traveling through time, they met or fought with, variously, Sgt.

He is the drummer of the Neue Deutsche H√§rte band Rammstein. Early life Christoph Schneider was born in Pankow, East Berlin, East Germany. He has one sister, who is two years younger than him. Schneider left the extended secondary school at age 16 and went on to work as a telecommunications assistant. In 1984, he served his national service with the East German Army; he is the only member of Rammstein to have served in the military. Career Schneider's parents wanted him to learn an instrument, so they sent him to a special music school connected to a Pioneers' orchestra, where he was offered the choice between trumpet, clarinet, and trombone, out of which he chose the trumpet first because it was the easiest to play. He describes himself as very talented at playing the trumpet, and after a year he got into the orchestra and played concerts. It was here he became interested in playing the drums: he was impressed by the equipment and kept looking over his shoulder at the drumset while playing. He told his parents he wanted to learn to play the drums, but they weren't supportive because \\"they were both from the classical world\\". He would go home and practice with sticks and built his own drum set with tin cans and buckets. He bought his first drumkit at age 14, after which his parents had to accept it and let him rehearse and take lessons.2010 interview with Metal Hammer In 1985, Schneider quit his telecommunication job to pursue his musical ambitions by studying music at university, but failed to get into university twice, being rejected because he possessed no other musical skills such as playing the piano. He continued to learn to play himself. Schneider tried consistently from 1985 until 1990 to get into bands as a drummer, finally being successful with Die Firma. In 1994, he joined Richard Kruspe and Oliver Riedel in forming an early version of Rammstein. After Till Lindemann joined the band, they entered the Berlin Senate Metrobeat contest, winning the chance to record a professional demo with four tracks. A previous band of Schneider's, Feeling B, provided two other members of Rammstein, Paul Landers and keyboardist Christian Lorenz. Personal life The nickname \\"Doom\\" comes from the video game of the same name. Schneider needed a name for the German copyright agency, but found there were too many Christoph Schneiders already. Paul Landers suggested the name \\"Doom\\" because they liked the game. Schneider has said that had he known that name would be on every record he played on, he would have chosen a different one. His favorite rock bands are Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Mot√∂rhead, Black Sabbath, and AC/DC. Equipment Schneider currently uses and endorses Sabian cymbals, DW drum kits, pedals and hardware and Vic Firth drumsticks.

It has about 20,000 inhabitants. It lies at the confluence of the Elbe and Vltava rivers, approximately north of Prague. The town is part of the Prague larger urban zone. The region belongs to the most important agricultural areas of the Czech Republic. The main agricultural produce are fruits, vegetables, potatoes, corn, sugar beet and wine. History In the 5th and 6th century many Slavonic tribes lived here, and the tribe of P≈°ovans created its main settlement in Mƒõln√≠k. Saint Ludmila (the grandmother of the Saint Wenceslas), who married the Bohemian prince Bo≈ôivoj, belonged to this tribe. Coins of the princess Emma are the first demonstration of the existence of Mƒõln√≠k. In November 1274 Mƒõln√≠k gained the statute of town from king Ottokar II of Bohemia and later became a dowry town belonging to queens of Bohemia. Landmarks The Mƒõln√≠k castle belongs to the most important sights of this town. The castle is built in the Renaissance style. Below the castle there are large wine cellars. Confiscated by the communists, it has been restored to its traditional owners, the princes of Lobkowicz. The St. Peter and St. Paul's Church faces the Mƒõln√≠k castle. The church was rebuilt three times. The church is used primarily for religious functions, but everyone is able to look inside at the interior. The construction began at the turn of the 10th and 11th centuries. Starting in 2007 the public will be allowed access to the reconstructed church tower. There is a large and elaborate ossuary inside the church, which is a minor tourist attraction. Anthropologist Professor Jind≈ôich Matiegka conducted research here between 1915‚Äì1919, during which he arranged the remains of 10‚Äì15,000 people. Behind the church there is a building of the old school. There is a restaurant here today with a beautiful view of the river and Ho≈ô√≠n park. Near the castle there is the Villa Carola where the town library is located, which is a part of the Mekuc ‚Äì Culture center of Melnik. Wine-growing 96% of Czech wines are produced in the Moravian region. Around 875 wine production first expanded to Bohemia with villagers of Mƒõln√≠k husbanding its first vineyard. According to legend, the Great Moravian Prince Svatopluk sent the Bohemian Prince Bo≈ôivoj a barrel of wine to celebrate the birth of his son Spytihnƒõv. Bo≈ôivoj's wife Ludmila sacrificed some of the wine to Krosynƒõ (goddess of the harvest) while making a plea for abundant rain. Her wish came true, the crop was saved and Bo≈ôivoj and Ludmila planted the first Bohemian vineyards around Mƒõln√≠k. Their grandson Saint Wenceslas later learned how to cultivate vines in these vineyards and make wine. He is honored by Czech winemakers as Supremus Magister Vinearum (Supreme Burgomaster of the Vineyards) and every year at the end of September a wine festival is held in Mƒõln√≠k on the Feast of St. Wenceslas. Mƒõln√≠k gives its name to the Mƒõlnick√° wine region, one of the most northerly in Europe.

He was also a member of the East German punk band Feeling B. Early years Lorenz was brought up in East Germany and still lives in Prenzlauer Berg area of East Berlin (now a part of the borough of Pankow). He chose to play the piano because a childhood friend of his played from the age of three. His parents sent him to a music school, where he said he \\"began by painting the keys on a window ledge\\" and \\"practiced one-half-year on the window ledge\\". His parents bought him a piano for one hundred East German marks for his 15th birthday. Lorenz became \\"addicted\\" to rock and roll as a boy. He stopped his lessons in order to play with his father's jazz records. \\"When I joined my first band\\", Flake has said, \\"I noticed that I couldn't play modern music. I still can't!\\" At the age of sixteen, he apprenticed as a toolmaker. Career =Feeling B= In 1983, at age sixteen, he began to play in the band Feeling B with Paul Landers and Aljoscha Rompe, a Swiss singer living in East Berlin. He stayed with the band for about ten years. Feeling B started out firmly grounded in the underground punk scene. Lorenz lived in an apartment with Landers during their early years. When they were not playing gigs, they would sell jackets made from cut- up bed sheets and dusters on the black market. Two jackets a month meant as much money as an average salaried worker. \\"It was quite easy to make a living; not to work and stay out of trouble,\\" said Landers, \\"You only got problems if you were caught.\\" The group disbanded in the mid-1990s. On special occasions, the band members would get together for concerts at punk festivals, until Rompe died in November 2000 of an asthma attack. =Rammstein= In 1994, Till Lindemann, Richard Kruspe, Oliver Riedel and Christoph Schneider entered and won the Berlin Senate Metro beat contest that allowed them to professionally record a four track demo. Paul Landers formally joined the band, followed by Lorenz. He was initially reluctant to join his five bandmates and had to be pestered into becoming a member of Rammstein, as he thought they would be too boring. Eventually, he agreed to join, and the group began work on their first album, Herzeleid (Heartache). In early live performances of the song \\"B√ºck dich\\" (\\"Bend down\\" or \\"Bend over\\"), Lorenz and vocalist Till Lindemann engaged in simulated sodomy with a liquor-squirting dildo. On 23 September 1998, in Worcester, Massachusetts (USA) Lindemann and Lorenz were arrested and charged with lewd and lascivious behavior. A statement from Sergeant Thomas Radula of the Worcester Police Department stated that Lindemann was simulating sex with Lorenz onstage \\"using a phallic object that shot water over the crowd\\". They were held and released the following day on US$25 bail. After months of legal debate, they were eventually fined US$100. Until 2002, Lorenz would \\"surf\\" the audience in an inflatable rubber dinghy during the performance of \\"Seemann\\" (\\"Seaman\\"). Riedel took his place in 2002. According to Lorenz, the change occurred because he was injured too often. During a 2001 concert in St. Petersburg, Lorenz was tipped out of the boat by the crowd and almost completely undressed. Despite this, Lorenz returned to riding the dinghy for Rammstein's 2009 tour during the performance of \\"Haifisch\\" (\\"Shark\\"). Lorenz in his band costume (2009) During a concert in Gothenburg, Sweden on 30 July 2005, Till Lindemann suffered a knee injury when Lorenz accidentally ran into him with the Segway he rides during the performance of \\"Amerika\\" (\\"America\\"). This caused concerts scheduled in Asia to be cancelled. In 2005, Lorenz suffered from mumps, causing concerts in South America to be cancelled. In January 2012, Lorenz, along with Lindemann, was interviewed by heavy metal anthropologist Sam Dunn for the VH1 Classic series Metal Evolution, on the topic of shock rock. Personal life Lorenz has been divorced once and has five children.http://www.rammwiki.net/index.php?title=Der_mit_den_Tasten_fickt_(interview) On 12 September 2008, Lorenz married artist Jenny Rosemeyer, who provided the whistling for Rammstein's song \\"Roter Sand\\". He has a brother who is four years older. Lorenz is an amateur painter and likes classic cars. He has a Mercedes and is involved in the vintage car hire business. In November 2011 Lorenz's house was set on fire. The police managed to identify and capture the arsonist, a 28-year-old male with a criminal record. After Lorenz escaped, he crashed his car nearby. =Nicknames= Lorenz commonly goes by the nicknames \\"Flake\\" (pronounced as \\"Flak-eh\\" in German) and \\"Doktor\\". \\"Doktor\\" came about because at one point he wanted to be a surgeon, but he was unable to study to become one because of his refusal to join the East German military. In a 16 December 2000 interview, he stated that \\"Flake\\" is his proper name. =Religion and politics= Lorenz has stated \\"I disapprove of religions which are made into rigid institutions. I also think that religious fanaticism and missionary work are dangerous.\\"http://en.affenknecht.com/rammstein- members/christian-flake-lorenz/ Lorenz has a distaste towards the United States, which he has called a \\"sick and decadent country with no culture\\". On 5 October 2005, Lorenz appeared briefly on Deutsche Welle. When asked how he felt about the reunification of Germany, he said he misses the way things were then. \\"Even if the GDR survived, I still would've stayed a musician. The increased size of the world also brought the danger of being compared to all of the international acts. The bands which were in the east were the only ones there, and if you were successful there, you were successful. I miss the simplicity. You went into a bar, ordered a beer, and you got a beer!... They didn't ask if you wanted... with a head or without a head, foam top or bottom... It really gets on my nerves having all of these choices I really don't want\\". In 2014, in an essay titled \\"I'm missing the GDR\\" Flake Lorenz stated \\"I miss the GDR even today. More so than the bands from that time.\\" In a 2014 interview with Rolling Stone, Lindemann stated that \\"Flake is still a citizen of the GDR, and he will die a citizen of the GDR\\" References External links * *Official Rammstein Site (German) *Official Rammstein Site (English) * geocities.com Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Feeling B members Category:German keyboardists Category:German industrial musicians Category:Heavy metal keyboardists Category:Musicians from Berlin Category:Rammstein members Category:German punk rock musicians Category:German atheists Category:People from Pankow Category:Industrial metal musicians ","title":"Christian Lorenz"},{"id":"856907","text":"Royal Air Force Lakenheath or RAF Lakenheath is a Royal Air Force station near the village of Lakenheath in Suffolk, England, UK, north-east of Mildenhall and west of Thetford. The base also sits close to Brandon. Despite being an RAF station, Lakenheath currently only hosts United States Air Force units and personnel. The host wing is the 48th Fighter Wing (48 FW), also known as the Liberty Wing, assigned to United States Air Forces in Europe - Air Forces Africa (USAFE-AFAFRICA). History =First World War= The first use of Lakenheath Warren as a Royal Flying Corps airfield was during the First World War, when the area was made into a bombing and ground-attack range for aircraft flying from elsewhere in the area. It appears to have been little used, and was abandoned when peace came in 1918. =Second World War (1940‚Äì1945)= Royal Air Force use In 1940, the Air Ministry selected Lakenheath as an alternative for nearby RAF Mildenhall and used it as a decoy airfield. False lights, runways and aircraft diverted Luftwaffe attacks from Mildenhall. Surfaced runways were constructed in 1941, with the main runway (04/22) being 2,000 yards, and the subsidiaries at 1,300 yards (12/30) and 1,400 yards (16/34). Another 100 yards was added to runway 16/34. Hardstands for thirty-six aircraft were built, along with two T-2 and a B-1 hangar. One T-2 was on the technical site, the other hangars to the east across the Mildenhall-Brandon road (A1065) were reached by taxiways. Lakenheath was used by RAF flying units on detachment late in 1941. The station soon functioned as a Mildenhall satellite with Short Stirling bombers of No. 149 Squadron dispersed from the parent airfield as conditions allowed. The squadron exchanged its Vickers Wellingtons for Stirlings late in November 1941. After becoming fully operational with its new aircraft, the squadron moved into Lakenheath on 6 April 1942 and remained until mid 1944 when the squadron moved to RAF Methwold in Norfolk. Taking part in more than 350 operations, more than half mine-laying, No. 149 Squadron had one of the lowest percentage loss rates of all Stirling squadrons. One Stirling pilot, Flight Sergeant Rawdon Middleton, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for valour on the night of 28‚Äì29 November 1942, when despite serious face wounds and loss of blood from shell-fire during a raid on the Fiat works at Turin in Italy, he brought the damaged aircraft back towards southern England. With fuel nearly exhausted his crew were ordered to bail out. Middleton was killed when the Stirling, BF372 OJ-H, crashed into the English Channel. In early 1943, three T-2 hangars were erected on the north side of the airfield for glider storage, forty Horsa Gliders being dispersed at Lakenheath during that year. On 21 June 1943, No. 199 Squadron was established as a second Stirling squadron. Commencing operations on 31 July, it laid mines during the winter of 1943‚Äì44. At the end of April 1944, after sixty-eight operations, the squadron transferred to No. 100 Group for bomber support, moving to RAF North Creake in Norfolk on 1 May 1944. No. 149 Squadron ended its association with RAF Lakenheath the same month, taking its Stirlings to RAF Methwold. Between them, the two squadrons lost 116 Stirling bombers in combat while flying from Lakenheath. The reason for the departure of the two bomber squadrons was Lakenheath's selection for upgrading to a Very Heavy Bomber airfield. Lakenheath was one of three RAF airfields being prepared to receive United States Army Air Forces Boeing B-29 Superfortresses, which were tentatively planned to replace some of Eighth Air Force's Third Air Division Consolidated B-24 Liberator groups in the spring of 1945. The work entailed removal of the existing runways and laying new ones comprising 12 inches of high-grade concrete. The main runway (07/25) was 3,000 yards long; the subsidiaries, 01/19 and 14/32, both 2,000 yards; all three being 100 yards wide. Part of the A1065 road between Brandon and Mildenhall was closed, and a new section built further to the east on the Warren. During the peak period of construction, over 1,000 men were working on the site; yet instead of the 12 months planned, it took 18 months for the ground work alone and years before Lakenheath's transformation was complete. The cost was nearly ¬£2 million. By the time construction ended the war with Germany was over and RAF Lakenheath was put on a care and maintenance status. =Cold War (1946‚Äì1990)= Cold War tensions with the Soviet Union in Europe began as early as 1946. In November, President Harry S. Truman ordered Strategic Air Command (SAC) B-29 bombers to RAF Burtonwood in Lancashire, and from there to various bases in West Germany as a \\"training deployment\\". In May 1947, additional B-29s were sent to the UK and Germany to keep up the presence of a training program. These deployments were only a pretense, as the true aim of these B-29s was to have a strategic air force permanently stationed in Europe. In April 1947, RAF Bomber Command returned to Lakenheath and had the runways repaired, resurfaced, and readied for operations by May 1948. Strategic Air Command left In response to the threat by the Soviet Union, by the 1948 Berlin blockade, President Truman decided to realign United States Air Force Europe (USAFE) into a permanent combat-capable force. In July, B-29 Superfortresses of the SAC 2nd Bombardment Group were deployed to Lakenheath for a 90-day temporary deployment. On 27 November 1948, operational control of RAF Lakenheath was transferred from the Royal Air Force to USAFE. The first USAFE host unit at Lakenheath was the 7504th Base Completion Squadron, being activated on that date. The squadron was elevated to an Air Base Group (ABG) on 28 January 1950, and to a Wing (ABW) on 26 September 1950. Control of Lakenheath was allocated to the Third Air Force at RAF South Ruislip, which had command of SAC B-29 operations in England. The Third Air Force was subsequently placed directly under USAF orders, with SAC establishing the 7th Air Division Headquarters at RAF Mildenhall. The collocation of the two headquarters within the United Kingdom allowed HQ USAFE to discharge its responsibilities in England, while at the same time allowing SAC to continue in its deterrent role while retaining operational control over flying activities at Lakenheath. By 1950, Lakenheath was one of three main operating bases for the SAC in the UK, the others being RAF Marham and RAF Sculthorpe both in Norfolk. A succession of bombardment squadrons and wings, thirty-three in all, rotated through Lakenheath, the B-29s giving way to the improved Boeing B-50 Superfortresses and subsequently, in June 1954, Boeing B-47 Stratojets. On 1 May 1951, Lakenheath was transferred from USAFE to SAC, and placed under the 3909th Air Base Group. By 1952, a high security perimeter fencing was erected. The 3909th moved to RAF Greenham Common in Berkshire during 1954, and was replaced by the 3910th Air Base Group.Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter, 1951Known SAC units which deployed to RAF Lakenheath on temporary duty (TDY) were: *830th Bombardment Squadron (1 June 1949 ‚Äì 21 August 1949) (B-50D) (TDY from the 509th Composite Group, Walker AFB, New Mexico) *65th Bombardment Squadron (15 August 1949 ‚Äì 15 November 1949) (B-50D) (TDY From the 43d Bombardment Wing, Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona) *33d Bombardment Squadron (20 November 1949 ‚Äì 18 February 1950) (B-29) (TDY From the 22d Bombardment Wing, March AFB, California) *96th Bombardment Squadron (22 February 1950 ‚Äì 12 May 1950) (B-50D) (TDY From the 2d Bombardment Wing, Hunter AFB, Georgia) *301st Bombardment Wing (28 June 1950 ‚Äì 28 November 1950) (B-29) (TDY From Barksdale AFB, Louisiana) *97th Bombardment Wing (15 March 1952 ‚Äì 1 April 1952) (B-50D, KC-97) (TDY From Biggs AFB, Texas) *19th Bombardment Squadron (6 September 1951 ‚Äì 13 December 1951) (B-29) (TDY From the 22d Bombardment Wing, March AFB, California) USAF Boeing B-47E-50-LM (AF Serial No. 52-3363) in flight.The increasing tension of the Cold War lead to a re-evaluation of these deployments, and by 1953 SAC bombers began to move its heavy bomb groups further west, behind RAF fighter forces, to RAF Brize Norton, RAF Greenham Common, RAF Upper Heyford and RAF Fairford, while its shorter-range B-47 were sent to East Anglia. *43d Air Refueling Squadron (21 March 1953 ‚Äì 5 June 1953) (KC-97) (TDY From the 43d Bombardment Wing, Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona) *321st Bombardment Wing (9 December 1954 ‚Äì 9 March 1955) (B-47, KC-97) (TDY From Pinecastle AFB, Florida) *40th Bombardment Wing (9 June 1955 ‚Äì 9 September 1955) (B-47, KC-97) (TDY From Schilling AFB, Kansas) *340th Bombardment Wing (14 September 1955 ‚Äì 3 November 1955) (B-47, KC-97) (TDY From Whiteman AFB, Missouri) *98th Bombardment Wing (12 November 1955 ‚Äì 28 January 1956) (B-47, KC-97) (TDY From Lincoln AFB, Nebraska) *Lakenheath Task Force (Provisional) (1 May 1955 ‚Äì UNK) (RB/ERB-47H) (Electronic Reconnaissance and Countermeasures) (TDY From 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, Forbes AFB, Kansas) *509th Air Refueling Squadron (26 January 1956 ‚Äì 30 April 1956) (KC-97) (TDY From Walker AFB, New Mexico) *307th Bombardment Wing (11 July 1956 ‚Äì 5 October 1956) (B-47, KC-97) (TDY From Lincoln AFB, Nebraska) Many SAC Squadrons had aircraft at Lakenheath on a transitory basis without any recorded deployment to the base. For example, in January 1951, a detachment of Convair RB-36D Peacemaker intercontinental bombers from the 5th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Travis AFB, California arrived for a few days, and various tanker and transport aircraft also made periodic appearances at the base. Several of the temporary detachments included in-flight refuelling tanker aircraft. On 30 April 1956, two Lockheed U-2s were airlifted to Lakenheath to form CIA Detachment A. The first flight of the U-2 was on 21 May. The Central Intelligence Agency unit did not remain long, moving to Wiesbaden Air Base, West Germany on 15 June. A near nuclear accident occurred on 27 July 1956 when a B-47 bomber crashed into a storage igloo at Lakenheath containing three Mark-6 nuclear weapons while on a routine training mission. Although the bombs involved in the accident did not have their fissile cores installed, each of them carried about 8,000 pounds of high explosives as part of their trigger mechanism. The crash and ensuing fire did not ignite the high explosives and no detonation occurred. The damaged weapons and components were later returned to the Atomic Energy Commission. The B-47 involved in the accident, which killed four crewmen, was part of the 307th Bombardment Wing. On 10 October 1956, a United States Navy Douglas R6D-1 Liftmaster disappeared over the Atlantic Ocean after departure from RAF Lakenheath for a flight to Lajes Field in the Azores. The aircraft was on a Military Air Transport Service flight carrying 50 members of the 307th Bombardment Wing, on their way home to the United States after a temporary duty assignment and a US Navy crew of nine. All 59 personnel on board were lost.Grossnick, Roy A., United States Naval Aviation 1910‚Äì1995, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, undated , p. 214, claims the date was 11 October 1956.  48th Tactical Fighter Wing  F-100D Super Sabre of 494 Tactical Fighter Squadron 48 TFW in 1965Following French president Charles de Gaulle's insistence in 1959 that all non-French nuclear-capable forces should be withdrawn from his country, the USAF began a redeployment of its North American F-100-equipped units from France. The 48th TFW left its base at Chaumont-Semoutiers Air Base, France on 15 January 1960, its aircraft arriving at Lakenheath that afternoon. When the first F-100D touched down on Lakenheath's runway, the landing symbolised a return for the Statue of Liberty Wing. Almost 16 years had passed since the Second World War Ninth Air Force 48th Fighter Group's arrival at RAF Ibsley, England, for the D-Day invasion. In conjunction with this transfer, control of Lakenheath was transferred from Strategic Air Command back to USAFE. As SAC elements began their departure, the 3910th Air Base Group began its transition of handing Lakenheath's facilities and real estate over to the 48th's Combat Support Group elements. The tactical components of the 48th TFW upon arrival at Lakenheath were: *492d Tactical Fighter Squadron (LR, blue colours) *493d Tactical Fighter Squadron (LS, yellow colours) *494th Tactical Fighter Squadron (LT, red colours) The squadron markings consisted of alternating stripes across the tailfin in squadron colours, with a shadowed \\"V\\" shaped chevron on the nose. Starting in March 1970, squadron tail codes (shown above) were added when the aircraft went from a natural finish to a Southeast Asian camouflage motif. The period between 1972 and 1977 can be described as a five-year aircraft conversion. Beginning in late 1971, the 48th TFW started its conversion to the McDonnell Douglas F-4D Phantom II, with the aircraft being transferred from the 81st TFW at RAF Bentwaters in Suffolk. The conversion to the F-4D took several years, with the last F-100 departing in August 1974. With the arrival of the Phantoms, the F-4s adopted a common tail code of \\"LK\\". This tail code lasted only a few months as in July and August 1972 the 48th TFW further recoded to \\"LN\\". The F-4D carried squadron identifying fin cap colours of blue, yellow and red (492d, 493d, 494th respectively). The F-4's service with the 48th TFW was short, as operation \\"Ready Switch\\" transferred the F-4D assets to the 474th TFW at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The 474th sent their General Dynamics F-111. As to the 366th TFW at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho, and the 366th sent their F-111Fs to Lakenheath in early 1977. A fourth fighter squadron, the 495th Tactical Fighter Squadron was activated with the 48th TFW on 1 April 1977, with a squadron tail colour of green. This was 33 years to the day since the squadron's inactivation. The 495th's mission of functioning as a replacement training unit for the other three fighter squadrons. This made the 495th and the 48th TFW unique, as the only WSO (Weapons System Operator) training unit for USAFE. F-111s from the 48th TFW participated in 1986 United States bombing of Libya in 1986. This bombing of Libya prompted the mock-acronym, 'Lakenheath Is Bombing Your Ass'. During the operation one F-111 from Lakenheath was shot down by Libyan forces and the two crew members were killed. The Libyan government eventually returned one of the bodies. Pararescuemen prepare to rappel from a 57th Rescue Squadron HH-60G Pave Hawk during exercise Joint Warrior 15-1 = Post Cold War (1991 ‚Äì present) = Lakenheath received its first McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagles in 1992. With the departure of the F-111s, the 495th FS was inactivated on 13 December 1991. On 18 December 1992, the last F-111 departed the base. Along with its departure, the 493d FS was also inactivated. With the pending closure of Bitburg Air Base in Germany on 25 February 1994, it was decided to reactivate the 493d as an F-15C/D squadron. Aircraft were transferred from the 33d Fighter Wing at Eglin AFB, Florida, and the 493d was reactivated on 1 January. The 493d's arrival meant that the 48th became the largest F-15E/F-15C composite unit in the U.S. Air Force. In 2003, the 48th FW received the first of ten new F-15Es. The aircraft were part of the final batch of F-15s expected to be ordered by the Air Force. On 2 March 2011, members of the 48th Security Forces Squadron were involved in a shooting at Frankfurt Airport in Germany. The members were on a bus bound for Ramstein Air Base in Germany when they were attacked by a lone gunman. On 22 March 2011, F-15E 91-0304 crash-landed and was destroyed in eastern Libya after reportedly suffering from a mechanical failure. Both crewmen ejected and were safely recovered. On 7 January 2014, a Sikorsky HH-60 Pave Hawk from the base crashed following a bird strike while on a low-level training exercise with another helicopter (also a Pave Hawk), into the Cley Marshes near Cley next the Sea on the nearby North Norfolk coast. All four occupants died in the crash. On 8 October 2014, F-15D 86-0182 belonging to the 493d Fighter Squadron crashed during a training flight in a field outside Spalding, Lincolnshire. The pilot successfully ejected and was shortly recovered back to Lakenheath on board a Pave Hawk. A US Marine Corps Boeing F/A-18 Hornet of VMFA-232 \\"Red Devils\\" from MCAS. Miramar, California, crashed after taking off from RAF Lakenheath on 21 October 2015. The pilot, Major Taj \\"Cabbie\\" Sareen (34), did not survive. On 15 June 2020, an F-15C belonging to the 493d Fighter Squadron crashed during a training flight in the North Sea, 74 nautical miles east of Scarborough at about . The body of pilot 1st Lt. Kenneth Allen has been found deceased. . Role and operations The 48th Fighter Wing at RAF Lakenheath is the Statue of Liberty Wing, the only USAF wing with both a number and a name. Since activation at Chaumont-Semoutiers AB, France, on 10 July 1952, Liberty Wing has been one of the premier fighter wings of the United States Air Forces in Europe, spending over 50 years as part of USAFE. The 48 FW has nearly 5,700 active-duty military members, 2,000 British and U.S. civilians, and includes a Geographically Separate Unit (GSU) at nearby RAF Feltwell. Tactical squadrons of the 48th Operations Group are: *492nd Fighter Squadron (F-15E) *493rd Fighter Squadron (F-15C/D) *494th Fighter Squadron (F-15E) Aircraft of the 48th FW carry the tail code \\"LN\\". In addition to supporting three combat-ready squadrons of F-15E Strike Eagle and F-15C Eagle fighter aircraft, the Liberty Wing housed the 56th Rescue Squadron's HH-60G Combat Search and Rescue helicopters. The 56th and 57th Rescue Squadrons re-located to Aviano Air Base in 2018. RAF Lakenheath and its sister base RAF Mildenhall are the two main U.S. Air Force bases in United Kingdom, and 48th Fighter Wing is the only U.S. Air Force F-15 fighter wing in U.K. and also in Europe. = 48th Fighter Wing = Based units Flying and notable non-flying units based at RAF Lakenheath. = United States Air Force = United States Air Forces in Europe - Air Forces Africa (USAFE-AFAFRICA) * 48th Fighter Wing ** 48th Operations Group *** 492d Fighter Squadron ‚Äì F-15E Strike Eagle *** 493d Fighter Squadron ‚Äì F-15C/D Eagle *** 494th Fighter Squadron ‚Äì F-15E Strike Eagle *** 48th Operations Support Squadron ** 48th Maintenance Group *** 48th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron *** 748th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron *** 48th Component Maintenance Squadron *** 48th Equipment Maintenance Squadron *** 48th Maintenance Operations Squadron *** 48th Munitions Squadron ** 48th Medical Group *** 48th Dental Squadron *** 48th Inpatient Operations Squadron *** 48th Medical Operations Squadron *** 48th Medical Support Squadron *** 48th Surgical Operations Squadron ** 48th Mission Support Group *** 48th Civil Engineer Squadron *** 48th Communications Squadron *** 48th Contracting Squadron *** 48th Force Support Squadron *** 48th Logistics Readiness Squadron *** 48th Security Forces Squadron  Future  Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II of the type to be based at RAF Lakenheath. = F-35A Lightning II = In January 2015, the US Department of Defense announced that from 2020, Lakenheath would become home to 54 of the US Air Force's Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II multi-role fighters. The aircraft would be split between two squadrons and there would be an increase of 1,200 military personnel and between 60‚Äì100 civilian workers at the station. The F-35 would operate alongside the two existing F-15E squadrons based at Lakenheath. By November 2018, the number of craft had been revised to 48 and their arrival date as late 2021. = F-35 Infrastructure = To accommodate the new aircraft a F-35 Campus is to be constructed on the south side of the airfield.  Projects  The main new operational buildings being developed as part of the F-35 project are as follows. * Two six-bay maintenance hangars ‚Äì Space for service, maintenance, storage, and staff support facilities (to be known as Hangars 4-1 and 4-2). * Hangar 6 (Consolidated Parts Store) ‚Äì Single-storey extension to the southern side of Hangar 6, including offices and warehouses and the storage of aircraft equipment and parts. * Dual Squadron Operations/Aircraft Maintenance Unit ‚Äì A three-storey building to provide combined facilities for two squadrons comprising Squadron Operations and Aircraft Maintenance Unit (AMU) facilities, including mission planning, administration space in the operations section and offices to manage the maintenance of aircraft and storage space. * Corrosion control and wash rack facility ‚Äì Comprising single- storey hangar to maintain aircraft including a paint and sanding booth and wash rack. * Flight simulator facility ‚Äì Comprising a single-storey building to accommodate six F-35A flight simulators, administration, records, classrooms, brief/debrief rooms, and storage space. * A Field Training Detachment Facility, comprising A three-storey building to provide F-35A training programme to maintain the aircraft, incorporating classrooms and administration rooms. Field Training Detachment Facility ‚Äì A three-storey building to provide F-35A maintenance, including classrooms and administration rooms. * Aircraft Generation Equipment (AGE) Facilities ‚Äì A single storey building extension and new covered storage associated with an existing building used for maintenance and storage of AGE related to the F-35A. * Fuel System Maintenance Dock ‚Äì A single storey hangar with fuel system maintenance dock to support the operation of the F-35A. * Munitions Maintenance Facility ‚Äì A single storey building extension and new covered storage to an existing building for the maintenance of munitions used by the F-35A. * Residential accommodation ‚Äì A three or four-storey dormitory for up to 144 beds to accommodate the increase in station personnel. * Flight-line Dining Facility * Munitions Storage Administration Maintenance building * Hospital ‚Äì Replacement medical facility up to four storeys to provide inpatient services, outpatient and speciality care clinics, ancillary services, support and medical administrative functions. * High school ‚Äì A three or four-storey building to house approximately 560 students. The airfield operational surfaces would also be expanded as follows. * Charlie Apron, currently used by F-15's will be redeveloped and extended to allow the parking of up to forty-two F-35A aircraft in dual-occupancy shelters constructed from a light weight, canopy structure with open sides. The total area of Charlie Apron once extended will be approximately 78,392 square metres, combining the retained area of 58,780 square metres with the new area of 19,612 square metres. It will be connected to Maintenance Hangars 4-1 and 4-2 and the Squadron Operations/AMU building. * Alpha-Bravo Apron will be extended to accommodate existing F-15 aircraft currently using Charlie Apron. The total area of Alpha-Bravo Apron once extended will be approximately 54,179 square metres, combining the retained area of 39,750 square metres with the new area of 14,429 square metres. Up to thirty-eight F-15 aircraft will be capable of being accommodated on the open apron which would not feature any shelters.  Infrastructure delivery  Investment of $148.4 million (¬£116.7M) for the delivery of F-35A infrastructure at Lakenheath was authorised by the US administration in August 2018. In November 2018, the Defence Infrastructure Organisation awarded a ¬£160M contract for infrastructure work to a joint venture between Kier Group and VolkerFitzpatrick. To make way for the F-35 Campus, demolition of the first of eighteen buildings began in March 2019. The work on Alpha-Bravo Apron was completed in August 2020, allowing F-15E Strike Eagle operations of the 492nd and 494th Fighter Squadrons to be consolidated on one ramp.  Heritage  = Gate Guardian = RAF Lakenheath's gate guardian is North American F-100D Super Sabre, serial number '54-2269'. The aircraft was originally delivered to the French Air Force. On return it was moved to the \\"Wings of Liberty Memorial Park\\" at RAF Lakenheath. Firstly it was painted as '55-4048', latterly as '56-3319'. Protests the 1986 bombing of Libya Since the base's founding, RAF Lakenheath has been targeted for numerous peace protests from groups such as Stop the war coalition and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. =Pershing= Lakenheath was one of the proposed sites of the NATO Pershing II Missile System. The deployment of the Missile system sparked protests all over Western Europe, and RAF Lakenheath was one of the most prominent military sites. The radical historian E.P. Thompson wrote in a pamphlet that basing the system at RAF Lakeneath directly endangered the lives of those in the nearby city of Cambridge: > \\"...Lakenheath is, by crow or cruise, just over twenty miles from Cambridge. > It is possible that Cambridge but less probable that Oxford will fall > outside the CEP. Within the CEP we must suppose some fifteen or twenty > detonations at least on the scale of Hiroshima, without taking into account > any possible detonations, release of radio-active materials, etc., if the > strike should succeed in finding out the cruise missiles at which it was > aimed.\\" A semi-permanent 'peace camp' was set up outside RAF Lakenheath. In 1985, the future Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams was arrested for singing Psalms at a CND protest at Lakeneath. = Libya = Over 1,000 people demonstrated outside RAF Lakenheath in protest at the 1986 United States bombing of Libya. Protestors including Jeremy Corbyn, outside RAF Lakenheath in 2006. =Iraq war and later= The 2003 Iraq War sparked a new wave of peace protests. In one incident, 9 protestors gained access to the base by cutting through its perimeter fence.The protestors rode bicycles along the main runway, before chaining themselves together. Activists later established a 'peace camp' outside RAF Lakenheath to draw attention to the base. In 2006, a group of 200 people protested against the alleged nuclear weapons stored at RAF Lakenheath. Addressing the crowd was Jeremy Corbyn, who cycled to RAF Lakenheath from the nearest train station in Ely. There were further protests on this issue in 2008.

It includes recreational, racing, commuting, and utility cycling. Road cyclists are generally expected to obey the same rules and laws as other vehicle drivers or riders and may also be vehicular cyclists. Overview Road cycling is an activity most commonly performed on a bicycle. Road cycling in its modern form was invented in Germany on Aug 12, 1817. There are many types of bicycles that are used on the roads including: BMX, recumbents, racing, touring and utility bicycles. Dedicated road bicycles have drop handlebars and multiple gears, although there are single and fixed gear varieties. Road bikes also use narrow, high-pressure tires to decrease rolling resistance, and tend to be somewhat lighter than other types of bicycle. The drop handlebars are often positioned lower than the saddle in order to put the rider in a more aerodynamic position. In an effort to become more aerodynamic, some riders have begun using aerobars. Who and when aerobars where invented is unclear but they seem to date back to the early 1980s. The light weight and aerodynamics of a road bike allows this type of bicycle to be the second most efficient self-powered means of transportation, behind only recumbent bicycles due to the latter's higher aerodynamic efficiency. Mountain bikes fitted with slick or semi-slick are also popular for commuters. Though less efficient, the upright riding position allows the cyclist a better view of traffic, and they can also be readily fitted with mudguards, cargo racks and other accessories. Mountain bikes are usually ridden on unpaved roads and tracks but they are not to be confused with cyclocross bikes. A hybrid form of road cycling has been gaining solid ground lately called cyclo-cross. Cyclo-cross (sometimes CCX, CX, cyclocross) is bicycling off-road and not to be confused with mountain biking. Cyclo-cross bikes are nearly identical to traditional road bikes but tend to have a longer wheelbase, a higher bottom-bracket for improved clearance over obstacles and tread on their tires for the purpose of riding on unpaved roads and rough trails.

The crossing into North Macedonia is known as Novo Selo-Petrich, as the first settlement across the border is Novo Selo. Petrich Peak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named for Petrich. History World War I memorial Petrich was included in the territory of the Bulgarian State during the reign of Knyaz Boris I (852-889). During the Middle Ages it was a Bulgarian fortress of importance during Tsar Samuil's wars (997-1014) with Byzantium. During Ottoman rule, it formed part of the Rumeli Eyalet, and in the 19th century became a kaza of the Sanjak of Serres in the Salonica Vilayet. From 19 January 1892, Petrich and its district were included in the Bulgarian Exarchate, before being included in Bulgaria following the Balkan Wars in 1912-13. In October 1925 it was the site of a brief conflict between Greece and Bulgaria sometimes called the War of the Stray Dog. Climate The climate of Petrich is mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Csa) with an average annual temperature of 15.6 ¬∞C (60 ¬∞F). The town experiences some continental influence, especially in winter, which is cool, but warm for Bulgarian standards. Petrich is the sunniest city in Bulgaria slightly ahead of Sandanski with yearly sunshine hours exceeding 2,700 on average. Summer is hot and sunny and it is the longest season in Petrich, lasting from May through September, even as late as October. The average summer temperature is around 25 ¬∞C. In July, the sunniest month, Petrich receives 373 hours of sunshine, making it one of the sunniest places in Continental Europe. Winter season, around two months, starts in late December and lasts until early February. Average winter temperature is one of the highest in the country with average around 5 ¬∞C. In December, the darkest month, there are 103 hours of sunshine, on average. Climate table: Economy The town is an agricultural centre for fruit, vegetables and tobacco. It has three factories, making water level detectors, details for cranes and a furniture factory. Broadcasting station There is a 500 kW mediumwave broadcasting station working on 747 kHz. It uses as antenna a 205-metre-tall guyed mast insulated with an additional cage antenna. This mast was built in 1977.

It reopened at the end of 2013 after being closed for two years.Suffolk Camra The other pub is the Brewer's Tap. The Royal British Legion was a members only club, but closed in April 2012.Lakenheath club closes its doors Lakenheath is remarkable for its medieval church, built about 900 years ago in wood, eventually being rebuilt in the local flint construction style. The church on the exterior has an embattled parapet that has an array of gargoyles and other carved faces at the string course at the base. The interior includes medieval paintings and carvings on the pews.Lakenheath The faces of the church's wooden angels bear the scars of the English Civil War, as none of the angels retained their original facial detail, due to religiously motivated vandalism by puritan soldiers. In early 2009, the church received a large grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and local organisations to restore its rare medieval wall paintings. The wall paintings, depicting local saint St Edmund, angels, and birds amongst other subjects, are believed to date from the 13th century.BBC News 6 January 2009 As well as the Anglican parish church, Lakenheath has churches representing the Methodist, Strict Baptist and Pentecostal (AOG) denominations. All three of the non-Anglican church buildings are also primarily constructed of local flint, albeit with later modifications in brick. The village was struck by an F0/T1 tornado on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.http://www.eswd.eu/cgi-bin/eswd.cgi The recently built pavilion now houses the local cricket club and hosts various events. Transportation Lakenheath railway station is three miles away from the village. There are regular bus services to the neighbouring towns of Brandon, Mildenhall and Thetford plus buses to Bury St. Edmunds operated on school/college days which are available to the general public. RAF Lakenheath An F-15C Eagle of the United States Air Force taxis for takeoff. The LN on the tail means this aircraft is based at RAF Lakenheath. Lakenheath is host to the largest deployment of United States Air Force personnel in the United Kingdom: RAF Lakenheath. The social impact of the United States Air Force fighter airbase and its nearby sister, RAF Mildenhall, on the economy of Lakenheath and on the nearby towns and villages is important. The United States has maintained a presence in the community since bombers were stationed there during WWII conducting raids on Europe. The base has a population of around 6000 service personnel. Prehistory and archaeology During the Ice Age, the River Bytham flowed through the area that is now Lakenheath, depositing much of the modern geology found in the area. Excavation of three early Anglo Saxon cemeteries at RAF Lakenheath between 1997 and 2002 uncovered a total of 394 inhumation and 17 cremation burials, including one 6th-century grave with a horse burial: a man was buried next to a fully armoured horse. Climate Lakenheath has an oceanic climate similar to the rest of the region of East of England. It is therefore warmer and drier than the average climate of the British Isles due to its relative distance to the low-pressure dominated coastal weather systems of the Atlantic.

The municipality The municipality of Razlog comprises the villages of Banya, Gorno Draglishte, Dolno Draglishte, Dobarsko, Bachevo, Godlevo and Eleshnitsa with a total population of 20,410 inhabitants. Each has its own charm. The fairy-tale village of Dobarsko, hidden in the outskirts of Rila, maintains the legends of the Dobarsko Singing School. One can see here the church \\"Saints Theodor Tiron and Theodor Stratilat\\" (1614) ‚Äî a National Monument of Culture with high architectural and artistic culture. The murals depicting Jesus Christ in what observers claim to be a jet rocket astonishes foreigners as well as Bulgarians. The icons in the Tzar (King) Row of church \\"Sretenie Gospodne\\" (1860) were painted by Simeon D. Molerov, a representative of the Bansko Painting School. View over Razlog with the mountains in the background History During his 1894‚Äì1896 trip in the region of Macedonia, Bulgarian geographer Vasil Kanchov visited Razlog (then known as –ú–µ—Ö–æ–º–∏—è, Mehomiya) and reported that it numbered 820 households, of which 500 of Eastern Orthodox Bulgarians, 300 of Muslim Bulgarians (Pomaks), 16 of Protestant Bulgarians and 5 of Eastern Orthodox Aromanians, for a total population of around 4,620. According to the same author's 1900 study on the population of Macedonia, Razlog was populated by 4,970 people, of which 3,200 Christian Bulgarians, 1,460 Muslim Bulgarians, 80 Turks, 200 Romani and 30 Aromanians. The town's population actively participated in the Kresna-Razlog and Ilinden- Preobrazhenie Uprising, Razlog, which was part of the Sanjak of Siroz in the Salonika Vilayet as \\"Razlƒ±k\\", itself being liberated from Ottoman rule in 1912. In 1925, the town was renamed from Mehomia to Razlog. The municipality of Razlog and the whole Razlog valley possess rich inheritance of cultural monuments from different ages and civilizations. There are seven cultural monuments in the territory of Razlog. These are the Christian temples: Saint Georgi Pobedonoset (built in 1834 in Razlog); Saint Gerogii (built in 1834 in Banya village); Uspenie Bogorodichno (built in 1835 in Dolno Draglishte village) ‚Äî the iconostasis in this temple was made by one of the most prominent representatives of the wood-carving school in Tryavna: Dosyu Koyuv; Saint Bogoroditsa in Dolno Draglishte village, specialists suppose that the temple was built before the 16th century; Sretenie Gospodne (built in 1860 in Dobarsko village); and Saint Theodor –¢iron and Theodor Stratilat (built in 1614 in Dobarsko village). This temple has unique mural paintings; it is a cultural monument under the protection of UNESCO. There are 70 houses in the municipality, which are archeological monuments. They are mainly from the age of the Revival ‚Äî the so-called \\"Razlog-Chepino\\" houses.

The castle is over 900 years old and has been the scene of many historical episodes in British history. Given the proximity of Carlisle to the border between England and Scotland, it has been the centre of many wars and invasions. During the Jacobite Rising of 1745-6, Carlisle became the last English fortress to undergo a siege. The castle was listed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument on 7 August 1996. Today the property is managed by English Heritage and is open to the public. Until recently the castle was the administrative headquarters of the former King's Own Royal Border Regiment. It is now the county headquarters to the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment and a museum to the regiment is within the castle walls. History Carlisle Castle was first built during the reign of William II of England, the son of William the Conqueror who invaded England in 1066. At that time, Cumberland (the original name for north and west Cumbria) was still considered a part of Scotland. William II ordered the construction of a Norman style motte and bailey castle in Carlisle on the site of the old Roman fort of Luguvalium, dated by dendrochronology to 72AD, with the castle construction beginning in 1093. The need for a castle in Carlisle was to keep the northern border of England secured against the threat of invasion from Scotland. In 1122, Henry I of England ordered a stone castle to be constructed on the site. Thus a keep and city walls were constructed. The existing Keep dates from somewhere between 1122 and 1135. The tower keep castle is one of only 104 recorded examples, most being found on the Welsh border. Entrance to Carlisle Castle. (De Ireby's tower) The act of driving out the Scots from Cumberland led to many attempts to retake the lands. The result of this was that Carlisle and its castle would change hands many times for the next 700 years. The first attempt began during the troubled reign of Stephen of England. On 26 March 1296, John 'The Red' Comyn, since the fourth quarter of 1295 Lord of Annandale, led a Scottish host across the Solway to attack Carlisle. The then governor of the castle, one Robert de Brus, deposed Lord of Annandale, successfully withstood the attack, before forcing the raiders to retreat back through Annandale to Sweetheart Abbey.\\"John 'Red' Comyn, Lord of Badenoch\\", Foghlam Alba From the mid-13th century until the Union of the Crowns of England and Scotland in 1603, Carlisle Castle was the vital headquarters of the Western March, a buffer zone to protect the western portion of the Anglo- Scottish border. Henry VIII converted the castle for artillery, employing the engineer Stefan von Haschenperg. For a few months in 1567, Mary, Queen of Scots was imprisoned within the castle, in the Warden's Tower. Later, the castle was besieged by the Parliamentary forces for eight months in 1644, during the English Civil War. An engraving of Carlisle Castle in 1829 The most important battles for the city of Carlisle and its castle were during the Jacobite rising of 1745 against George II. The forces of Prince Charles Edward Stuart travelled south from Scotland into England reaching as far south as Derby. Carlisle and the castle were seized and fortified by the Jacobites. However they were driven north by the forces of William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, the son of George II. Carlisle was recaptured, and the Jacobites were jailed and executed. That battle marked the end of the castle's fighting life, as defending the border between England and Scotland was not necessary with both countries again one in Great Britain. After 1746, the castle became somewhat neglected, although some minor repairs were undertaken such as that of the drawbridge in 1783. Some parts of the castle were then demolished for use as raw materials in the 19th century to create more or less what is visible to the visitor today. In 1851 the barracks were occupied by the 33rd Regiment of Foot with 10 officers, 150 soldiers, 2 servants and 25 soldiers' wives and children.1851 census The Army moved in to take hold of the castle and in 1873 a system of recruiting areas based on counties was instituted under the Cardwell Reforms and the castle became the depot for the 34th (Cumberland) Regiment of Foot and the 55th (Westmorland) Regiment of Foot. Under the Childers Reforms, the 34th and 55th regiments amalgamated to form the Border Regiment with its depot in the castle in 1881. The castle remained the depot of the Border Regiment until 1959, when the regiment amalgamated with the King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster) to form the King's Own Royal Border Regiment. The Army Reserve still use parts of the castle: 8 Platoon C Company 4th Battalion the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment are based within the Burma Block alongside a Multi Cap-Badge detachment of the Army Reserve, including Medics, Engineers, Logisticicians, Intelligence and Infanteers from other Cap Badges. Carlisle Castle was listed as (List Entry Number: 1014579) in August 1996, by what is now Historic England. The listing for the Scheduled Ancient Monument status includes ‚Äúthe upstanding and buried remains of Carlisle medieval tower keep castle, two lengths of Carlisle city wall, a 16th century battery, and the buried remains of much of the Roman fort known as Luguvalium, a large part of which underlies the later castle.‚Äù In 2016, Historic England undertook the first official investigation into the historic graffiti and carvings scattered over the castle site, using photogrammetric techniques to record findings. The ‚ÄòPrisoners‚Äô Carvings‚Äô in the Keep, and a medieval door covered in etchings, were laser scanned, photographed and filmed, alongside a Roman altar stone, medieval and postmediaeval graffiti and carvings across the complex, to produce 3D models as a record of their current condition.

The ships were fitted with two twin and a pair of single mounts for Oerlikon light AA guns.Chesneau, p. 63; Lenton, p. 297 Provision was made for a further four single mounts if needed.

Volkswagen Karmann Ghia Ghia G 230 S based on Fiat 2300 A rare Ghia-designed Fiat 500 Jolly 1954 Plymouth Explorer concept car by Ghia Carrozzeria Ghia SpA (established 1916 in Turin) is an Italian automobile design and coachbuilding firm, established by Giacinto Ghia and Gariglio as Carrozzeria Ghia & Gariglio. The headquarters is located at 4 Corso Valentino in Turin.  History  Ghia initially made lightweight aluminium-bodied cars, achieving fame with the Alfa Romeo 6C 1500, winning Mille Miglia (1929). Between the world wars, Ghia designed special bodies for Alfa Romeo, Fiat, and Lancia, one of the most famous was the Fiat 508 Balilla sports coupe (1933). The factory was rebuilt at Via Tomassi Grossi, after being demolished in an air raid during World War II (1943). After Ghia's death (1944), the company was sold to Mario Boano and Giorgio Alberti. The Ghia- Aigle subsidiary was established in Aigle, Switzerland (1948). Following differences between Boano and the company's Naples-born chief engineer and designer Luigi Segre, Boano left the company in 1953 and ownership passed to Segre in 1954. Under the ownership of Luigi Segre, between 1953 and 1957, Giovanni Savonuzzi became Direttore Tecnico Progettazione e Produzione Carrozzerie e Stile and established GHIA as the most influential proponent of that Italian styling that came to define automobile design trends worldwide. The decade between 1953 and 1963 saw many foreign firms ordering Ghia designs, such as Ford (the Lincoln Futura concept car), Volkswagen (the Karmann Ghia), and Volvo. Chrysler and its designer Virgil Exner became a close partner for 15 years, resulting in eighteen Chrysler Ghia Specials (1951‚Äì53), the K-310, the Chrysler Norseman, the Imperial Crown limousines (Jackie Kennedy, Nelson Rockefeller, and other luminaries owned one), and others. There are even a few Ghia-bodied Ferraris. Ghia also participated in the short-lived Dual-Ghia venture. Production by Ghia was always in very low numbers, giving the company's products even greater exclusivity than those of the other Italian coachbuilders. In June 1953, Pierre Lefaucheux, Renault's chairman, requested Carrozzeria Ghia assistance with the Renault Dauphine. In 1953, Boano left for Fiat, the factory moved to via Agostino da Montefeltro, and Luigi Segre took over. Ghia then brought in Pietro Frua, appointing Frua as head of Ghia Design (1957‚Äì60), designing the Renault Floride. After Segre's death in 1963, Ghia was sold to Ramfis Trujillo in 1966, who in turn sold the company in 1967 to Alejandro de Tomaso, owner of a rival design house. De Tomaso had difficulty in running Ghia profitably. In 1970, he sold his shares to the Ford Motor Company. During this transition period, Ghia had partial involvement in the De Tomaso Pantera, a high-performance, mid-engine car utilizing a Ford V8. =Ghia L6.4= Ghia L6.4 After the Dual-Ghia project had ended, the more up- to-date Ghia L6.4 appeared in 1961. Fewer Mopar parts were used, but the car‚Äôs bespoke nature meant an astronomically high price and when production ended in 1963 only 25 (or 26) cars had been built. The car's Chrysler V8 has SAE, and suspension and transmission parts were also hand-picked from Chrysler's production line. Both the front and the rear seats consist of separate buckets.  The Ghia name  From 1973, the Ghia name became Ford's top trim- level in its mainstream model range. The trend began in Europe and North America (Mustang II, Granada, Capri, Cortina, Escort, and later Fiesta, Sierra, Orion, Scorpio, Mondeo, Focus all had Ghia trim levels), but soon spread worldwide, particularly to the South American (with the Argentinian Ford Falcon and Taunus, the Brazilian Ford Del Rey and versions of Escort, Focus and Mondeo) and Asia Pacific markets (with the Ford Laser and Telstar). One notable exception to this convention was the Scorpio model in the United Kingdom, where it was badged as a Granada Mk.3 ‚Äì in this case the \\"Scorpio\\" name was instead used to designate a trim level higher than Ghia. In the British market, however, the practice of using the Ghia name in such a capacity was finally phased out in 2010. The Titanium name has instead replaced Ghia as the flagship trim level, and is now used globally across all of Ford's markets to denote the top trim level. The British Ford Fiesta retained the Ghia trim designation for the longest period of any model: 31 years 8 months, uninterrupted, from February 1977 to November 2008. In the rest of Europe, the Ghia trim was discontinued as well. , the Ghia studios produce various concept cars under the Ford banner.

It had a population of 3,848 according to the 2001 census of the United Kingdom, leading to the implausible claim by some residents that Bembridge is the largest village in England. Bembridge is home to many of the Island's wealthiest residents. The population had reduced to 3,688 at the 2011 Census. Bembridge sits at the extreme eastern point of the Isle of Wight. Prior to land reclamation the area of Bembridge and Yaverland was almost an island, separated from the remainder of the Isle of Wight by Brading Haven. On the Joan Blaeu map of 1665, Bembridge is shown as Binbridge I≈øle, nearly separated from the rest of Wight by River Yar.thumb Prior to the Victorian era Bembridge was a collection of wooden huts and farmhouses, which only consolidated into a true village with the building of the church in 1827 (later rebuilt in 1846). Facilities Bembridge Harbour The historical heart of the village is located close to the church in the north of the village, consisting of a number of shops, pubs and restaurants, along with the Village Hall and site of the former Parish Council hall. Bembridge Library serves the community and there is a local museum in the same location. Bembridge is a local service centre, hosting Bembridge C of E Primary School (see Education on the Isle of Wight for more information on the use of this term), a post office, several shops located in two main areas, and Methodist, Anglican and Catholic churches. It is also the location of a local fire station, (crewed by a team of retained firemen), and a Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat station. Bembridge Airport is a local airport with a concrete runway, and is located close to the Windmill to the south-west of the village proper heading towards Yaverland. The Lane End district is located in the east of the village. It is largely composed of modern bungalows and a small shopping area which includes a Co-Op store. The lane comes to an end at the beach, where Bembridge Lifeboat station and the Bembridge Coast Hotel are situated. The bungalows are built on the site of a cottage where Cecily Cardew lived, after whom an Oscar Wilde character was named. Further inland from Lane End is Bembridge C of E Primary School, along with the local community centre, which are connected by a large recreational playing field. The Royal Isle of Wight Golf Club (now defunct) was located at St Helens Duver, across the harbour from Bembridge. The club was formed in 1882 and closed in the 1960s.‚ÄúRoyal Isle of Wight Golf Club‚Äù, \\"Golf's Missing Links\\". The war memorial was designed by local architect, Percy Stone (1856‚Äì1934). = Lifeboat station = Seawall in Bembridge. The RNLI station is particularly significant, as it extends into the sea to the east of the village. Here lies the notorious \\"Bembridge Ledge\\", a large, rocky outcrop which poses a major threat to passing boats. Although it is private sailing yachts which are most at risk, a wide variety of boats commonly run aground here, especially in the often stormy weather conditions which affect the Solent during winter months. A former Bembridge lifeboat, the , is part of the National Historic Fleet, and exhibited at Imperial War Museum Duxford. The current offshore boathouse was completed in Autumn 2010 by BAM Nuttall and Ecochoice and houses a new Tamar class boat, the 'Alfred Albert Williams'. A complete new concrete walkway was built, and the new station is made completely of naturally durable timber. The Inshore lifeboat station was rebuilt in 2014, and the interior of the offshore boathouse is accessible to visitors during set days when the station isn't on alert. The original Victorian boathouse also survives, and is currently used as the station's shop. = Coastguard lookout= Close to the lifeboat station lies a coastguard lookout. Positioned at a high elevation, this offers views of the Solent meeting the English Channel to the east of the Isle of Wight. From this vantage point one is able to view a variety of watercraft year round, although there is more marine traffic in the summer. = Bembridge Windmill = Bembridge Windmill Bembridge Windmill, the only remaining windmill on the Isle of Wight, is located to the west of the village. Dating from around 1700, it is a National Trust property generally open from April to October.  Politics  Bembridge is currently represented on the Isle of Wight Council by the two members of the ward of Bembridge, St. Helens and Brading. Bembridge is governed by a Parish council of 12 members. For parish council elections the village is divided into two wards, the North and South, each electing six members to the body. The parish council has succeeded in obtaining Lottery funding for improvements to the village recently, including a play-park in Steyne Park. It is also one of the few Parish Councils that has a village centre office open 5 days a week. = Twinning = * Bembridge is twinned with Pl√©dran, Brittany, France but in name only as the federation has lapsed through non-use. Public transportation  Public transport to Newport, Ryde and Sandown is provided by Southern Vectis bus route 8. Bembridge railway station, which was located in the north-west of the village close to the harbour served the village, with services to Brading, until 1953. The station became derelict and was demolished around 1970. Religion Bembridge is served by the Holy Trinity Church, built in the 1840s as a replacement for an 1827 church that had become unstable. St Luke's Mission Church opened as a chapel of ease to Holy Trinity Church in 1887, while there is also Bembridge Methodist Church and the Roman Catholic St Michael's Church. Bembridge Boarding Campus Bembridge School was taken over by Ryde School with Upper Chine in 1996, which turned the site into Bembridge Boarding Campus. This site also houses Kingswood Centre, which operates Kingswood during term-time and Camp Beaumont during school holidays, although it is closed for a few weeks in the winter.

In 1979, the building was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The east wing of the two-storey church was originally constructed in the late 10th or early 11th century, then the central wing was added in the 13th century under the Second Bulgarian Empire, the whole building being finished with a further expansion to the west in the middle of the 19th century. A total of 89 scenes with 240 human images are depicted on the walls of the church.  History and architecture  Interior view of the Boyana Church The Boyana Church was built in three stages: in the late 10th to early 11th, the mid-13th, and the mid-19th centuries. The oldest section (the eastern church) is a small one-apse cross-vaulted church with inbuilt cruciform supports. It was built in the late 10th or the early 11th century. The second section, which adjoins the eastern church, was commissioned by Sebastocrator Kaloyan and his wife Desislava in the mid-13th century. This building belongs to the two-floor tomb-church type. It consists of a ground-floor family sepulchre with a semi-cylindrical vault and two arcosolia on the north and south walls, and of an upper-floor family chapel identical in design to the eastern church. The exterior is decorated with ceramic ornaments. The last section was built with donations from the local community in the mid-19th century. The church was closed to the public in 1954 in order to be conserved and restored. It was only partially reopened in 2006. As a protection measure, air-conditioning was installed to keep the temperature at 17‚Äì18 degrees Celsius (62‚Äì64 Fahrenheit), with low-heat lighting. Groups of up to 8 visitors are permitted to stay for 10 minutes. The building, placed under the management of the National Historical Museum (Bulgaria), was fully reopened to the public by Culture Minister Stefan Danailov on October 2, 2008.

The frescoes were restored and cleaned in 1912‚Äì1915 by an Austrian and a Bulgarian specialist, and again in 1934 and 1944. The church owes its world fame mainly to its frescoes from 1259. They form a second layer over the paintings from earlier centuries and represent one of the most complete and well-preserved monuments of mediaeval art in the Balkans. Eighteen scenes in the narthex depict the life of Saint Nicholas. The painter here drew certain aspects of contemporary lifestyle. In The Miracle at Sea, the ship and the sailors' hats recall the Venetian fleet. The portraits of the patrons of the church ‚Äî Sebastocrator Kaloyan and his wife Dessislava, as well as those of Bulgarian tsar Constantine Tikh and Tsaritsa Irina, are thought to be among the most impressive and lifelike frescoes in the church, and are located on the north wall of the church. =First layer= The first layer of frescoes, which originally covered the entire eastern church, dates from the 11th‚Äì12th century. Fragments of those frescoes have been preserved in the lower parts of the apse and the north wall, and in the upper part of the west wall and the south vault. =Second layer= According to the donor‚Äôs inscription on the north wall of the second section, the second layer of frescoes dates from 1259. Those frescoes were painted over the earlier layer by a team of unknown artists, who also decorated the two floors of the building commissioned by Sebastocrator Kaloyan. The Boyana Church owes its world fame above all to the frescoes from 1259, which demonstrate the exceptional achievements of mediaeval Bulgarian culture. The majority of the more than 240 figures depicted here display individuality, remarkable psychological insight and vitality. The frescoes follow the canon of icon- painting established by the Seventh Ecumenical Council held in Nicaea in 787. The frescoes in the oldest section of the church include a magnificent representation of Christ Pantocrator in the dome. The drum below shows a host of angels, with the Four Evangelists ‚Äì Matthew, Mark, Luke and John ‚Äì portrayed in the pendentives. Four images of Christ adorn the face of the arches: Christ Emmanuel; Christ, The Ancient of Days; and the acheiropoietic (‚Äúmade without hands‚Äù) Holy Mandylion and Holy Tile. Next come scenes from the Major Feast Days and the Passions of Christ. Among the full-length portrayals of saints in the first tier, there are ten warrior saints. The Virgin Enthroned, surrounded by archangels, is represented in the altar conch. Below are four church fathers: St. Gregory the Theologian, Basil the Great, John Chrysostom and Patriarch Germanus. The frescoes flanking the altar show the deacons Laurentius, Euplius and Stephen, as well as St. Nicholas, the patron of the ground floor of the church ‚Äì one of the most popular saints and the patron saint of sailors, merchants and bankers. The life of St. Nicholas is depicted in 18 scenes in the narthex (the second section of the church). The unknown artists included elements of contemporary life in those scenes, and many of the figures are quite realistic ‚Äì especially their countenances. The lunette above the entrance of the narthex displays the Virgin and Child, St. Anna and St. Joachim, and Christ Blessing. St. Catherine, St. Marina, St. Theodore the Studite and St. Pachomius are portrayed in the lower tiers on the walls. The south arcosolium features the scene of Christ Disputing with the Doctors, and the north one, the Presentation of the Virgin. Two highly revered Bulgarian saints are also represented in the narthex ‚Äì St. John of Rila (the oldest surviving representation of the saint) and St. Paraskeva (Petka). The hermit St. Ephraim Syrus appears among the monks portrayed here. The expressive realistic portraits of the donors Sebastocrator Kaloyan and his wife Dessislava, and of the Bulgarian Tsar Constantine Asen Tikh and Tsaritsa Irina ‚Äì painted with precision, extraordinary skill and feeling ‚Äì are among the oldest portraits of figures from Bulgarian history.  Authorship  Today the name ‚ÄúBoyana Master‚Äù stands for the team of unknown artists who decorated the church and mastered their art in the studios of the Turnovo School of Painting. Boyana is the only and the most impressive wholly preserved monument of the Turnovo School of Painting from the 13th century. According to many leading experts, the world famous frescoes in the Boyana Church played an important role in the development of mediaeval Bulgarian and European painting. A name, possibly that of a painter, was discovered during restoration works in 2006‚Äì2008. UNESCO-listed Boyana church reveals identity of its medieval master at google.com, 3 October 2008 National History Museum director Bozhidar Dimitrov stated: \\"The renovation revealed a rare inscription under a layer of plaster on one of the church walls: 'I, Vasiliy inscribed'. The 13th-century 'Boyana master' was the only painter among the kings and nobles whose names were regularly read out during sermons at the church.\\" Restorator Grigoriy Grigorov stated \\"The Christian Orthodox religion forbids the painter from manifesting himself, as in the eyes of the priests it is God who guides his hand. But this painter inscribed his name, knowing that the believers could not see it.\\" Other historians and archaeologists are less convinced that the inscription identifies the \\"master\\", since it could equally have been left by an assistant. =Late frescoes= Some parts of the church were overpainted, and the majority of those frescoes have survived to the present day. The later frescoes include a scene of the Presentation of the Virgin from the 14th century, a portrait of St. Nicholas from the 16th‚Äì17th century, and representations of the two patron saints of the Boyana Church ‚Äì St. Nicholas and St. Panteleimon ‚Äì from 1882.

The Madara Rider or Madara Horseman (, Madarski konnik) is an early medieval large rock relief carved on the Madara Plateau east of Shumen in northeastern Bulgaria, near the village of Madara. The monument is dated in the very late 7th, or more often very early 8th century, during the reign of Bulgar Khan Tervel. In 1979 became enlisted on the UNESCO World Heritage List.  Description  The relief depicts a majestic horseman above ground level in an almost vertical -high cliff. It is of almost natural size. The horseman, facing right, is thrusting a spear into a lion lying at his horse's feet, and on the left a dog is running after the horseman. The carving of the horseman's halo and garments, as well as the bird in front of the horseman's face, are barely recognizable due to the erosion and bad condition of the monument. The relief is similar to the carbon images found in Saltovo, Soulek, Pliska and Veliki Preslav. = Origin tradition = The meaning and symbolism of the depiction is uncertain, as well its actual masonry tradition and cultural source. In the scholarship the origin of the relief is connected with the Bulgars ethnogenesis ‚Äì the semi-nomadic equestrian warrior culture from the Eurasian Steppe. Others saw in the relief resemblance to the Sasanian rock relief tradition. The hero- horseman is a common character of Turkic and Iranian-Alanic mythology. It is sometime considered that the horseman represents or is related to the Bulgar deity Tangra, while Vladimir Toporov related it to the Iranian deity Mithra. Others noted a more simple explanation ‚Äì that the relief represented Khan Tervel (701‚Äì718 AD), or like previously considered and now rejected, Khan Krum (802‚Äì814 AD). Some considered it an example of the Thracian horseman ‚Äì a recurring motif of a deity in the form of a horseman in the Paleo-Balkanic mythology. The motif typically features a caped horseman astride a steed, with a spear poised in his right hand. He is often depicted as slaying a beast with a spear, although this feature is sometime absent. Initially considered (and later abandoned) by Konstantin Josef Jireƒçek and Karel ≈†korpil, the assumption was gradually rejected because of differences in the iconographic details, and the relation with the animals (there's no dog). The relief probably incorporates both autochthonous Thracian and the newly arrived Bulgars cultural cults. The monumental size, iconography and the details (stirrup, halo, skull-cup, bird etc.) is generally part of the Bulgar tradition, while the rightward direction and the lion of the Thracian tradition. = Archaeology = In the 1924‚Äì35, beneath the relief (some 250 m north) were found the remnants of a complex which is considered to have been a pagan shrine (three-aisled church) and a rectangular building, probably the ruler's private dwelling, where the ruler did sacral rituals related to Tangra. At the site was also found a damaged inscription by Khan Omurtag which mentions the deity Tangra. The complex is commonly dated to the second quarter of the ninth century, as the 1970s excavations dated the pottery between 8th and 10th century. Some argue that the earliest buildings were founded after the conversion to Christianity. Thus the pagan temple (i.e. church) and the building would have been built on an early Byzantine basilica. To the west of the building was found Christian burial, with golden decorated belt, dated c. 900 AD. Throughout the 20th century, two miles (c. 3.2 km) northeast from the relief was found another group of buildings, consisting of 5th-6th century basilica, with inner rectangular structure, which some interpreted as the pagan temple (but without clear evidence).  Inscriptions  Three partially preserved texts in Medieval Greek, carved in the rock, can be found around the image of the rider. They bear important information regarding the history of Bulgaria in the period. The oldest inscription is the work of Tervel (701‚Äì718 AD), thus it is considered that the relief was created during his rule or immediately after the Bulgars settled in 680‚Äì681 AD. The other inscriptions refer to the Khans Krum (802‚Äì814 AD) and Omurtag (814‚Äì831 AD) who are most likely the ones who ordered the carvings. Inscription I: Justinian the emperor made a treaty [...] the Bulgars [...] and came to Tervel. My uncles at Thessaloniki did not trust the emperor with the cut-off nose and went back to the Kisiniie [...] one of his [...] The ruler Tervel made a treaty and gave to the emperor five thousand [...] with my help the emperor scored a fine victory.

Work began on the system in the 1920s to protect the USSR against attacks from the West. The line was made up of concrete bunkers and gun emplacements, somewhat similar to, but less elaborate than the Maginot Line. It was not a continuous line of defense along the entire border, but rather a network of fortified districts, meant to channel potential invaders along certain corridors. In the aftermath of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, with the westward expansion of the USSR in 1939 and 1940 into Poland, the Baltic, and Bessarabia, the decision was made to abandon the line in favour of constructing the Molotov Line further west, along the new border of the USSR. A number of Soviet generals felt that it would be better to keep both lines and to have a defence in depth, but this conflicted with the pre-World War II Soviet military doctrine.John Erickson The Soviet High Command: A Military-Political History, 1918‚Äì1941, Routledge, 2001. Remains of the Stalin Line near Minsk Thus, the guns were removed, but were mostly in storage as the new line began construction. The 1941 Axis invasion caught the Soviets with the new line unfinished and the Stalin Line largely abandoned and in disrepair. Neither was this of much use in stopping the onslaught, though parts of the Stalin Line were manned in time and contributed to the defense of the USSR. Following World War II, the line was not maintained, in part due to its wide dispersal across the USSR. Unlike Western Europe, where similar fortifications were demolished for development and safety reasons, much of the line survived beyond the breakup of the USSR in 1991 due to being ignored. Today, the remains of the Stalin Line fortifications are located in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine (plus possibly the eastern parts of Moldova).

The Basilica di San Lorenzo (Basilica of St Lawrence) is one of the largest churches of Florence, Italy, situated at the centre of the city‚Äôs main market district, and the burial place of all the principal members of the Medici family from Cosimo il Vecchio to Cosimo III. It is one of several churches that claim to be the oldest in Florence, having been consecrated in 393, at which time it stood outside the city walls. For three hundred years it was the city's cathedral before the official seat of the bishop was transferred to Santa Reparata. San Lorenzo was the parish church of the Medici family. In 1419, Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici offered to finance a new church to replace the 11th-century Romanesque rebuilding. Filippo Brunelleschi, the leading Renaissance architect of the first half of the 15th century, was commissioned to design it, but the building, with alterations, was not completed until after his death. The church is part of a larger monastic complex that contains other important architectural and artistic works: the Old Sacristy by Brunelleschi, with interior decoration and sculpture by Donatello; the Laurentian Library by Michelangelo; the New Sacristy based on Michelangelo's designs; and the Medici Chapels by Matteo Nigetti. History The Basilica of San Lorenzo is considered a milestone in the development of Renaissance architecture. The basilica has a complicated building history. The project was begun around 1419, under the direction of Filippo Brunelleschi. Lack of funds slowed the construction and forced changes to the original design. By the early 1440s, only the sacristy (now called the Old Sacristy) had been worked on, as it was being paid for by the Medici. In 1442, the Medici stepped in to take over financial responsibility of the church as well. After Brunelleschi's death in 1446, the job was handed either to Antonio Manetti or Michelozzo; scholars are uncertain. Though the building was largely completed by 1459 in time for a visit to Florence by Pius II, the chapels along the right-hand aisles were still being built in the 1480s and 1490s. By the time the building was done, aspects of its layout and detailing no longer corresponded to the original plan. The principal difference is that Brunelleschi had envisioned the chapels along the side aisles to be deeper, and to be much like the chapels in the transept, the only part of the building that is known to have been completed to Brunelleschi's design.Eugenio Battisti. Filippo Brunelleschi: The Complete Work. (New York: Rizzoli, 1981) *See also: Howard Saalman. Filippo Brunelleschi: The Buildings. (London: Zwemmer, 1993).

The balcony in the basilica According to one scholar, features such as the interior's Corinthian arcades and ceiling's flat panels mark \\"a departure from the Gothic and a return to the Romanesque Proto-Renaissance.\\" The design of San Lorenzo has at times met with criticism, particularly when compared with Santo Spirito, also in Florence and which is considered to have been constructed more or less in conformity with Brunelleschi's ideas, even though he died before most of it was built. By the 16th century, Giorgio Vasari commented that the columns along the nave should have been elevated on plinths.Battisti. Ibid. The steps along the aisles, supporting the pilasters, have also been considered to deviate from Classical ideals. Outer and inner fa√ßades The Medici Pope Leo X gave Michelangelo the commission to design a fa√ßade in white Carrara marble in 1518. Michelangelo made a wooden model, which shows how he adjusted the classical proportions of the facade, drawn to scale, after the ideal proportions of the human body, to the greater height of the nave. The work remained unbuilt. Michelangelo did, however, design and build the internal facade, seen from the nave looking back toward the entrances. It comprises three doors between two pilasters with garlands of oak and laurel and a balcony on two Corinthian columns. Michelangelo's model In recent years, the association of \\"Friends of the Elettrice Palatina\\" and the Comune of Florence re-visited the question of completing the outer facade according to Michelangelo's designs. To assist with the public debate, a computerized reconstruction was projected onto the plain brick facade in February 2007. As yet, no decision has been made on the project.The debate to finish the facade of San Lorenzo  Arttrav.com The campanile dates from 1740. Old Sacristy Opening off the north transept is the square, domed space, the Sagrestia Vecchia, or Old Sacristy, that was designed by Brunelleschi and that is the oldest part of the present church and the only part completed in Brunelleschi's lifetime; it contains the tombs of several members of the Medici family. It was composed of a sphere on top of a cube; the cube acting as the human world and the sphere the heavens. New Sacristy Opposite the Old Sacristy in the south transept is the Sagrestia Nuova (New Sacristy), begun in 1520 by Michelangelo, who also designed the Medici tombs within. The new sacristy was composed of three registers, the topmost topped by a coffered pendentive dome. The articulation of the interior walls can be described as early examples of Renaissance Mannerism (see Michelangelo's Ricetto in the Laurentian Library). The combination of pietra serena pilasters on the lower register is carried through to the second; however, in Mannerist fashion, architectural elements 'seem impossible,' creating suspense and tension that is evident in this example. Michelangelo's sculptural elements, to be used on the tombs themselves, were left undone. A difficult person to work with, Michelangelo refused to direct the completion of the new sacristy. In a statement in the Michelangelo‚Äôs biography published in 1553 by his disciple, Ascanio Condivi, and largely based on Michelangelo own recollections, Condivi gives the following description: > The statues are four in number, placed in a sacristy ... the sarcophagi are > placed before the side walls, and on the lids of each there recline two big > figures, larger than life, to wit, a man and a woman; they signify Day and > Night and, in conjunction, Time which devours all things ... And in order to > signify Time he planned to make a mouse, having left a bit of marble upon > the work (which [plan] he subsequently did not carry out because he was > prevented by circumstances), because this little animal ceaselessly gnaws > and consumes just as time devours everything. A concealed corridor with drawings on the walls by Michelangelo was discovered under the New Sacristy in 1976.Peter Barenboim, Sergey Shiyan, Michelangelo: Mysteries of Medici Chapel, SLOVO, Moscow, 2006. Peter Barenboim, Michelangelo Drawings: Key to the Medici Chapel Interpretation, Moscow, Letny Sad, 2006, Cappelle Medicee The cruciform basilica with the vast domed apsidal Medici Chapel; in the cloister is the Laurentian Library. The most celebrated and grandest part of San Lorenzo are the Cappelle Medicee (Medici Chapels) in the apse. The Medici were still paying for it when the last member of the family, Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici, died in 1743. Almost fifty lesser members of the family are buried in the crypt. The final design (1603‚Äì1604) was by Bernardo Buontalenti, based on models of Alessandro Pieroni and Matteo Nigetti. Above is the Cappella dei Principi (Chapel of the Princes), a great but awkwardly domed octagonal hall where the grand dukes themselves are buried. The style shows Mannerist eccentricities in its unusual shape, broken cornices, and asymmetrically sized windows. In the interior, the ambitious decoration with colored marbles overwhelms the attempts at novel design.Wittkower, R. p. 126 At its centre was supposed to be the Holy Sepulchre itself, although attempts to buy and then steal it from Jerusalem failed.

It is one of the three national parks in the country, the others being Rila National Park and Central Balkan National Park. The park was established in 1962 and its territory was expanded several times since then. Pirin National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. The altitude varies from 950 m to 2,914 m at Vihren, Bulgaria's second highest summit and the Balkans' third. The park is situated in Blagoevgrad Province, the nation's south-westernmost region, on the territory of seven municipalities: Bansko, Gotse Delchev, Kresna, Razlog, Sandanski, Simitli and Strumyani. There are no populated places within its territory. Two nature reserves are located within the boundaries of Pirin National Park, Bayuvi Dupki‚ÄìDzhindzhiritsa and Yulen. Bayuvi Dupki‚ÄìDzhindzhiritsa is among the oldest in Bulgaria, established in 1934 and is included in the World Network of Biosphere Reserves under the UNESCO Man and Biosphere Programme. The whole territory is part of the network of nature protection areas of the European Union, Natura 2000. Pirin is renowned for its 118 glacial lakes, the largest and the deepest of them being Popovo Lake. Many of them are situated in cirques. There are also a few small glaciers, such Snezhnika, located in the deep Golemiya Kazan cirque at the steep northern foot of Vihren, and Banski Suhodol. They are the southernmost glaciers in Europe. Pirin National Park falls within the Rodope montane mixed forests terrestrial ecoregion of the Palearctic temperate broadleaf and mixed forest. Forests cover 57.3% of the parks area and almost 95% of them are coniferous forests. The average age of the forests is 85 years. Bulgaria's oldest tree, Baikushev's pine, is located in the park. With an approximate age of about 1,300 years it is a contemporary of the foundation of the Bulgarian state in 681 AD. The fauna of the Pirin National Park is diverse and includes 45 species of mammals, 159 species of birds, 11 species of reptiles, 8 species of amphibia and 6 species of fish.  History and park administration  Pirin National Park was established on 18 November 1962 in order to preserve the natural ecosystems and landscapes along with their plant and animal communities and habitats. Originally named Vihren National Park, the protected area initially covered 67.36 km2. Its territory was expanded several times until it reached its current area of 403.56 km2 in 1999. In 1983, Pirin National Park was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites as an area of outstanding natural importance. By the Constitution of Bulgaria, the park is exclusively state-owned. According to the classification of the International Union for Conservation of Nature the park falls within management category II (national park) with main objective protecting functioning ecosystems while allowing human visitation and its supporting infrastructure. The entire territory of the park is included in the European Union network of nature protection areas Natura 2000. Pirin National Park is listed as an important bird and biodiversity area by BirdLife International. Pirin National Park is managed by a directorate subordinated to the Ministry of Environment and Water of Bulgaria based in the town of Bansko at the northern foothills of the mountain. As of 2004, the park administration had 92 employees. There are two visitor and information centres located in Bansko and Sandanski. The park is divided in six sectors: Bayuvi Dupki with office in Razlog, Vihren with office in Bansko, Bezbog with office in Dobrinishte, Trite Reki and Kamenitsa, both with office in Sandanski, and Sinanitsa with office in Kresna.

To the north it is divided from the Rila mountain range by the Predel Saddle and mountain pass at 1140 m altitude, to the east reaches the valley of the river Mesta, including the Razlog Valley, to the south the Paril Saddle (1170 m) forms the border with the Slavyanka mountain range, and to the west reaches the valley of the river Struma. The park is situated entirely in Blagoevgrad Province in the municipalities of Bansko (36.6% of the park's territory), Gotse Delchev (4.9%), Kresna (14.9%), Razlog (10.2%), Sandanski (30.7%), Simitli (2.3%) and Strumyani (0.4%). = Relief and geology = The tectonics of the Pirin is primarily the result of Precambrian, Hercynian, alpine and tectonic movements and events. The modern relief of Pirin was shaped in the Pleistocene (2,588,000 to 11,700 years ago) when the mountain was subjected to alpine glaciation related to the global cooling. This glaciation passed in parallel with that of the Alps. The limits of the glaciers reached 2200‚Äì2300 m. All glacial forms in the mountain range are within the borders of Pirin National Park. The Pirin mountain range is divided into three sections: northern, middle and southern, with the northern one being the highest and containing all glacial formations and lakes. The park covers the northern section, itself divided into two zones. The northern zone consists of the steep marble Vihren ridge with the three highest summits in the mountain: Vihren (2914 m), Kutelo (2908 m) and Banski Suhodol (2884 m), as well as the ridge Koncheto (2810 m). The southern zone consists of granite ridges and includes Pirin's fourth highest summit Polezhan, at 2851 m. There are more around 60 summits above 2600 m. A winter view featuring the highest summit Vihren The relief of Pirin National Park is alpine and highly fragmented and is characterized with steep slopes, high ridges and deep river valleys. The highest point is Vihren at an altitude of 2914 m, the second highest summit in Bulgaria and the third one in the Balkan Peninsula, while the lowest altitude in the park is at 950 m near Bansko. Nearly 60% of the park's area is situated above 2000 m. The distribution of the territory of the park by altitude is as follows: up to 1000 m ‚Äì 1.64 km2 (0.4%), 1000‚Äì1600 m ‚Äì 51.09 km2 (12.7%); 1600‚Äì2000 m ‚Äì 121.08 km2 (30.0%); 2000‚Äì2500 m ‚Äì 198.31 km2 (49.1%); above 2500 m ‚Äì 31.45 km2 (7.8%). The inclination of the park's territory is steep ‚Äî more than 90% the total area is classified as steep (21‚Äì30¬∞) or very steep (above 31¬∞). Geologically Pirin is a massive anticline formed by metamorphic rocks ‚Äî gneiss, biotite and crystalline schists, amphibolite, quartzite and marble. Paleozoic granitoid rocks are found in restricted areas in the outskirts of Pirin National Park. Granitoid rocks from the Upper Cretaceous form two distinct plutons: Northern Pirin and Bezbog. The Central Pirin pluton covers the southern reaches of the park and is dated to the Upper Oligocene. The granitoid rocks cover 55% of the park's territory. = Climate = Sunset over the Tevno Vasilashko Lake, the largest and deepest of the Vasilashki Lakes Pirin falls within the continental Mediterranean climate zone and due to its altitude the higher sectors have Alpine climate. The climate is influenced by Mediterranean cyclones mainly in late autumn and in winter, bringing frequent and high rainfall, and by the Azores anticyclone in summer, making the summer months hot and dry. The relief has a crucial influence on the climate. Pirin has three altitude climate zones ‚Äî low between 600 and 1000 m (16% of the total area), middle between 1000 and 1800 m (40%) and high above 1800 m (44%). The temperature decreases with the altitude, which is more visible in summer. The mean annual temperature is around 9‚Äì10 ¬∞C in the lower, 5‚Äì7 ¬∞C in the middle and 2‚Äì3 ¬∞C in the higher altitude. The coldest month is January with average temperature varying between ‚àí5 and ‚àí2 ¬∞C. The hottest month is July with temperature averaging 20 ¬∞C at 1600 m and 15 ¬∞C at 2000 m. Temperature inversions, i.e. increase in temperature with height, are observed in 75% of the winter days. The annual precipitation is 600‚Äì700 mm in the lower altitude zones and 1000‚Äì1200 mm in the higher ones. The rainfall occurs mostly in winter and spring, while summer is driest season. The air humidity is 60‚Äì75% in August and 80‚Äì85 % in December. In winter the precipitation is mainly snow, varying from 70‚Äì90% at the lower altitudes to 100% at higher. The average number of days with snow cover varies from 20‚Äì30 to 120‚Äì160. The highest thickness of the snow cover reaches 40‚Äì60 cm at 1000‚Äì1800 m in February and 160‚Äì180 cm above 1800 m in March (190 cm on Vihren). In some winters the snow thickness can reach 250‚Äì350 cm. Avalanches occur frequently in winter. = Hydrology = Muratovo Lake and Todorka Summit Kamenitsa Summit from Tevnoto Lake The territory of Pirin National Park is almost equally divided between the basins of the rivers Struma (206.06 km2 or 51.1%) and Mesta (197.50 km2 or 48.9%). The watershed follows the main ridge of the mountain in direction north-west to south-east. Pirin is the source of 10 tributaries to the Struma, the largest one being Sandanska Bistritsa, and another 10 to the Mesta. The rivers are short, steep and with high water volume. They form numerous waterfalls which are generally not as high as those in Rila or the Balkan Mountains. The highest one is Popinolashki waterfall, measuring some 12 m. The average annual discharge of the park's rivers is 355,6 million m3, of them 188,5 million m3 flow to the Struma and 167,1 million m3 to the Mesta. The discharge from the park per square kilometre is 2.3 times larger than Pirin's average and 5.6 times larger than Bulgaria's average. The landscape is dotted with 118 permanent glacial lakes, conventionally divided into 17 groups, such as Popovo Lakes, Kremenski Lakes, Banderishki Lakes, Vasilashki Lakes, Valyavishki Lakes, Chairski Lakes, Vlahini Lakes or Tipitski Lakes. The largest of them is Popovo Lake with 123,600 m2, which makes it Bulgaria's fourth largest glacial lake. With a depth of 29.5 m, it is also Pirin's deepest lake and Bulgaria's second. Situated at an altitude of 2710 m the Upper Polezhan Lake is the highest one in the mountain and in the country. Another remnant from the last Ice Age are two small glaciers. Snezhnika is located in the deep Golemiya Kazan cirque at the steep northern foot of Vihren and is the southernmost glacier in Europe. Banski Suhodol Glacier is larger and situated a bit to the north below Koncheto Ridge.  Biology  = Ecosystems and forests = Bulgarian fir in Pirin Pirin National Park falls within the Rodope montane mixed forests terrestrial ecoregion of the Palearctic temperate broadleaf and mixed forest. The plant communities in the park can be classified into several main groups: communities found around bodies of water; bush communities of the subalpine zone; grasslands, including meadows, subalpine and alpine pastures; forest communities; rock communities; and communities of secondary character, which are a result of human activity. Forests cover 231.10 km2 or 57.3% of the park's total area. Of them 95% are coniferous forests and 5% are deciduous forests. The mean age of the forest is 85 year. Around 34.3% of the wooded territory is covered with trees above 140 years. The oldest tree in Bulgaria, the 1300‚Äìyear Baikushev's pine of the species Bosnian pine (Pinus heldreichii) , is found in the park and is a contemporary of the foundation of the Bulgarian state in 681 AD. There are 16 tree species; of them three are Balkan endemic taxa with limited areal ‚Äî the Bulgarian fir (Abies borisii-regis), Macedonian pine (Pinus peuce) and Bosnian pine (Pinus heldreichii). The largest area is occupied by dwarf mountain pine (Pinus mugo) ‚Äì 59.62 km2, Macedonian pine (Pinus peuce) ‚Äì 54.15 km2, Norway spruce (Picea abies) ‚Äì 23.79 km2, European beech (Fagus sylvatica) ‚Äì 10.98 km2 and Bosnian pine ‚Äì 8.93 km2. The Macedonian and the Bosnian pines in Pirin National Park constitute respectively 42% and 52% of their total area in Bulgaria. = Flora = Pirin poppy (Papaver degenii) is one of the park's endemic species. The flora of the park is diverse and is characterized with high endemism due to the combination of southern geographic latitude and high altitude variation. The varied relief creates various ecological environments for plants, further diversified by the dominant rock types which form siliceous and calcareous terrain on the territory of the park. Lakes and streams also diversify the conditions creating wetland habitats for hygrophyte species. Non-vascular plants constitute the least researched part of Pirin's flora. The least studied of them are the algae with 165 species, including two endemics. The largest concentration of algae species is found in Popovo and Kremenski lake groups. The Bryophytes, including mosses, are represented by 329 known species. The number of lichen species is 367, or 52% of Bulgaria's total diversity. Of them 209 species are found in the coniferous forests and 156 ‚Äî on calcareous terrain. The vascular plants in Pirin National Park include 1315 species of 94 families and 484 genera, or approximately 1/3 of Bulgaria's flora. The flora has largely preserved its indigenous character. The number of vascular plant species is expected to grow in case of future detailed research, especially at lower altitudes. The species are divided almost equally to representatives of the sub-Mediterranean and Circumboreal floristic regions. The number of species included in the Red Book of Bulgaria is 114. There are 18 species endemic to the park and another 17 are restricted only to Bulgaria, which makes a total of 35 Bulgarian endemic species. The park is also home to 86 Balkan endemic species. The endemic species restricted to the park are: Pirin poppy (Papaver degenii), Pirin meadow-grass (Poa pirinica), Urumov oksitropis (Oxytropis urumovii), Kozhuharov oksitropis (Oxytropis kozuharovii), Banderishka lady's mantle (Alchemilla bandericensis), Pirin lady's mantle (Alchemilla pirinica), Kelererova asineuma (Asyneuma kellerianum), Pirin sandwort (Arenaria pirinica), Pirin sedge (Carex pirinensis), Pirin fleabane (Erigeron vichrensis), David mullein (Verbascum davidoffii), lesser Pirin fescue (Festuca pirinica), Pirin hogweed (Heracleum angustisectum), Yavorkova rattle (Rhinanthus javorkae), Pirin thyme (Thymus perinicus), Daphne domini, Daphne velenovskyi. = Fauna = Boreal owl The vertebrate fauna of Pirin National Park consists of 229 species. The number of mammal species is 45. The distribution of the mammalian species by order is as follows: Insectivora ‚Äì 5, Chiroptera ‚Äì 16, Lagomorpha ‚Äì 3, Rodentia ‚Äì 7, Carnivora ‚Äì 9 and Artiodactyla ‚Äì 4. The European snow vole is a relict species. Among the species of highest conservation value are brown bear, gray wolf, wildcat, European pine marten, wild boar, red deer, roe deer and Balkan chamois. The small mammals, especially rodents and bats, are not fully studied in the whole territory of the park. The total number of bird species is 159. Of them 91, or 57%, are passerine. Three species are relict ‚Äî boreal owl, white-backed woodpecker and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker. The park's rarest residents are lesser spotted eagle with a single nesting pair, booted eagle, golden eagle with 2 to 5 pairs, short-toed snake eagle with two pairs, saker falcon, peregrine falcon with three pairs, western capercaillie, hazel grouse, rock partridge, corn crake, Eurasian woodcock and stock dove. There are 11 reptile and 8 amphibian species. There are Central European species (fire salamander, yellow-bellied toad, smooth snake), Palearctic (common toad, European green toad, common frog), Euro-Siberian (European tree frog, common European viper, grass snake, viviparous lizard), Irano-Turanian (marsh frog), Southern European (agile frog), Euro-Mediterranean (European green lizard), Mediterranean (common wall lizard) and Balkan (Erhard's wall lizard). A typical habitat in Pirin The ichthyofauna includes 6 fish species: common minnow, European eel (considered extinct), western vairone, brown trout, rainbow trout and brook trout. The limited number of species is determined by the high altitude of the park. The glacial lakes, streams and upper river courses are inhabited by few fish species. The western vairone is known only from the Kremenski lakes and might in fact represent a new undescribed species. The number of identified invertebrate species in Pirin National Park is 2091, which is 40% of the estimated 4500 species to inhabit the park. They are poorly researched and there is not enough data to assess the qualitative and quantitative parameters even of the main populations of endemic and relict species. There are 218 endemic, 176 relict and rare 294 species. The Araneae are represented by 321 species, or 35% of Bulgaria's total. The spiders prefer the north-eastern slopes and are most diverse in the coniferous forests. There are 36 species of Myriapoda, or 20% of Bulgaria's total. They are distributed mainly in the forests and are less frequent in the sub-Alpine and the Alpine zones. The Mollusca are 89 species and represent 27% of the nation's total (excluding the marine molluscs). Only 2% of Bulgaria's Ephemeroptera are found in the park ‚Äî two species. The number of Orthopterida species is 63, or around 30% of the nation's total. The highest diversity is found in the valleys of the rivers Banderitsa and Damyanitsa. The Plecoptera are represented by 40 species, forming 40% of Bulgaria's diversity. There are 323 Heteroptera species, or 32% of the ones known in Bulgaria. They are most diverse in the northern parts of the park, in the Bayuvi Dupki‚ÄìDzhindzhiritsa Reserve. The Coleoptera are 639 species and this number it is estimated to raise to 1800‚Äì1900. The Neuropterida are 25 species, or 20% of Bulgaria's total diversity. There are 36 Hymenoptera species, found mainly at lower altitudes. The Trichoptera are 59 species, or 24% of Bulgaria's total. The Lepidoptera are 449, including 116 butterflies and 333 moths. Some of the most spectacular butterflies are the mountain Apollo (Parnassius apollo), clouded Apollo (Parnassius mnemosyne), false Eros blue (Polyommatus eroides), mountain Alcon blue (Phengaris rebeli), large blue (Phengaris arion), scarce tortoiseshell (Nymphalis xanthomelas), Titania's fritillary (Boloria titania), eastern large heath (Coenonympha rhodopensis), Cynthia's fritillary (Euphydryas cynthia), etc.  Recreation  The park's most challenging hiking trail runs along the top of Koncheto ridge. Pirin National Park is a popular tourist destination. The park's main information center is in Bansko and houses an interactive exhibit on the park's forests, allowing visitors to acquaint themselves with facts about the park's vegetation and wildlife. There is also a 30-seat projection room with multimedia equipment. As of 2002 on the territory of the park there were 1837 beds, including 885 in mountain refuges, 214 in hotels, 124 in bungalows and 615 in premises belonging to different departments of the state administration. Some of the refuges include Bezbog, the largest and most modern one; Banderitsa, constructed in 1915 by order of Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria, and Vihren. There are 20 marked hiking trails in the park. Trail No. 1 is part of the E4 European long distance path and crosses the park following the itinerary Predel Refuge‚ÄìYavorov Refuge‚ÄìVihren Refuge‚ÄìTevno Lake‚ÄìPirin Refuge‚ÄìPopov Grasslands. The most challenging hiking trail follows the top of the Koncheto ridge at an altitude of approximately 2,810 m, between the peaks Banski Suhodol (2,884 m) and Kutelo (2,908 m). The north-western side of Koncheto is almost vertical and 300‚Äì400 m deep, while the south-western side is less steep (approximately 30 degrees) but reaches 800 m in depth.  Development and Environmental Risks  There are many factors which threaten the ecosystems in the park. Rock quarries, wildland arson, industrial and illegal logging, poaching, excessive trail use, vehicle access, and most notably the ski resorts have put the park under significant threat. There has been a steady development of skiing infrastructure since the early nineties along the northeast of the range, most notably in the town of Bansko, which has become an international winter resort. In 2003, a large forested portion of the Todorka peak and the nearby ridges were cleared to begin the construction of the resort which today has 13 ski lifts and 75km of slopes. The expansion of the resort took place even though the park legislature strictly forbids such activity in the park's limits. Since the building started, Bansko has experienced severe flooding of the Glazne river, due to the intervention. In December 2017, the Bulgarian government, without warning changed the legislature of the park so that commercial logging and construction of roads and buildings within 50% the park is made legal. This sparked a wave of protests against the continuous tampering with the world heritage site, which have continued throughout February and March 2018. The protests were supported by Ska Keller who is vice-president of the Greens/EFA group in the European Parliament. In November 2017, the World Wide Fund for Nature and other local NGOs filed a lawsuit against the Bulgarian Ministry of the Environment and Water as they deemed that plans for development of the area violated environmental regulations.

Blaskowitz led the 8th Army during the Invasion of Poland and was the Commander in Chief of Occupied Poland from 1939 to 1940; he had written several memoranda for the German High Command protesting the SS atrocities and handed out death sentences to members of the SS for crimes against the civilian population. He was dismissed, but then re- appointed. He commanded Army Group G during the Allied invasion of Southern France and Operation Nordwind, the last major German offensive of World War II on the Western Front. After the war, he was charged with war crimes in the High Command Trial at Nuremberg. While in custody facing trial he died on 5 February 1948, purportedly of suicide. He was posthumously acquitted on all counts. Early years Johannes Blaskowitz was born on 10 July 1883 in the village of Paterswalde, (East Prussia), Germany (now Bolshaya Polyana in the Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia). He was the son of a Protestant pastor, Hermann Blaskowitz, and his wife Marie Blaskowitz, n√©e Kuhn. In 1894, Blaskowitz joined cadet school at K√∂slin (now Koszalin, Poland) and afterwards at Berlin Lichterfelde. In 1901, he started his military career as an officer candidate cadet in an East Prussian regiment in Osterode (Polish: Ostr√≥da). During World War I, Blaskowitz served on the Eastern and Western Fronts and was employed in the General Staff. He rose to command an infantry company by 1918, and was awarded the Iron Cross for bravery. Interwar period Blaskowitz's war service secured him a place in the small postwar Reichswehr during the Weimar Republic, through whose ranks he rose to the rank of General. His attitude towards the Nazis' seizure of power in 1933 was reportedly indifferent because he believed that the armed forces should be \\"politically neutral\\". In early 1939 he commanded the German forces that occupied Austria and Czechoslovakia, and was promoted to General of Infantry and given command of the 8th Army just prior to the outbreak of World War II. Invasion of Poland Blaskowitz,(right) with Rundstedt during the victory parade in Warsaw, 1939 During the invasion of Poland, the 8th Army under Blaskowitz's command was responsible for the northern part of the front under Army Group South, led by Gerd von Rundstedt. The 8th Army saw heavy combat during the Battle of the Bzura and later besieged the Polish capital of Warsaw. After the campaign, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, promoted to Generaloberst and appointed as Commander-in-Chief East in Poland on 20 October 1939. As a traditional soldier, Blaskowitz kept firm control on the men under his command in their dealings with civilians and was opposed to Army participation in war crimes by the SS and Einsatzgruppen. He handed out death sentences to members of the SS for crimes against the civilian population, which were rescinded by Adolf Hitler. Between November 1939 and February 1940 he wrote several memoranda to higher military officials, in which he detailed SS atrocities in Poland, their negative effects on Wehrmacht soldiers, the insolent attitude of the SS toward the army and warned that the SS ‚Äúmight later turn against their own people in the same way.‚Äù However, his protests failed to produce results, and merely earned him the enmity of Hitler, Hans Frank, Reinhard Heydrich and Heinrich Himmler, while Chief of Staff Alfred Jodl dismissed them as naive and \\"uncalled for\\". Commander-in-Chief Walther von Brauchitsch forwarded Blaskowitz's first memorandum to Hitler on 18 November, who launched a tirade against Blaskowitz, denouncing his concerns about due process as \\"childish\\" and poured scorn on his \\"Salvation Army attitude.\\" In February 1940, Blaskowitz prepared a list of 33 complaints against the SS. Among his complaints were strip searches and rape of Jewish women, a whipping orgy in Nasielsk affecting 1,600 Jews, and a clear case of race mixing committed by a junior SS officer. Blaskowitz concluded that \\"It is a mistake to massacre some 10,000 Jews and Poles, as is being done at present; for‚Äîso far as the mass of the population is concerned‚Äîthis will not eradicate the idea of a Polish state, nor will the Jews be exterminated.\\" Blaskowitz was relieved of his command on 29 May 1940. Occupation of France Rommel and von Rundstedt, May 1944 Following the Fall of France in May 1940, Blaskowitz was initially slated to command the 9th Army for occupation duties, but the appointment was blocked by Hitler and instead he was appointed to a relatively minor position as Military Governor of Northern France, a position he held until October 1940, when he was transferred to the command of the 1st Army, on the southwest coast between Brittany and the Pyrenees. On 10 November 1942, the 1st and 7th Army under Blaskowitz's command launched Case Anton, the military occupation of Vichy France. The 1st Army advanced from the Atlantic coast, parallel to the Spanish border, while the 7th Army advanced from central France towards Vichy and Toulon. The 50,000-strong Vichy French Army took defensive positions around Toulon, but when confronted by German demands to disband, it did so since it lacked the military capability to resist. By the evening of 11 November, German tanks had reached the Mediterranean coast. Anton marked the end of the Vichy regime as a nominally independent state. However, Blaskowitz's forces failed to secure the Vichy French fleet at Toulon, which was scuttled by the French. In May 1944, following the appointment of Gerd von Rundstedt as Commander-in-Chief in the West, Blaskowitz was appointed the head of Army Group G. This comparatively small command, consisting of the 1st Army and the 19th Army, was given the task of defending southern France from the imminent Allied invasion. When in Normandy, he managed to convince Field Marshal Erwin Rommel that the \\"rumours\\" Rommel had heard about atrocities on the Eastern Front were actually true. According to historian Christopher Clark, in France, Blaskowitz tried to \\"build a constructive relationship with the local population\\", even though the conditions for him to do so were worse than in Poland. He encouraged the troops deployed to support French agriculture to act \\"selflessly\\". On the one hand, when the prefects in Toulouse complained about crimes against civilians in \\"counter-terrorism\\" procedures, Blaskowitz defended the right of the German army to defend itself, even though he admitted sometimes innocent people were harmed. On the other hand, he tried to ensure that German counterinsurgency would be conducted in accordance with international norms as far as possible. He publicly distanced himself from units that committed the Oradour-sur-Glane massacre. After the July Bomb Plot, he sent a note that proclaimed loyalty to Hitler. Clark speculates that he might have feared that he was suspected. There was no evidence that suggests Blaskowitz ever protested the deportation of Jews from France. Although army appraisal forms, compiled by Rundstedt, described him as a National Socialist, Christopher Clark opines that Blaskowitz likely never had any ideological attachment to Nazism. According to Clark, professionalism enabled Blaskowitz to follow his own principles even against the political Zeitgeist, but the same professionalism made him unsuitable for political resistance. After a visit in October 1943, German resistance member Ulrich von Hassell lamented that it was not fruitful to discuss with Blaskowitz who saw everything from a military point-of-view. From this \\"very bounded standpoint\\", whatever one thought about the regime's moral character became overshadowed by duty to his superiors and his troops, as well as the people whose fate \\"now hung in balance.\\" The invasion of southern France commenced on 15 August 1944, with Operation Dragoon, when Allied forces landed on the Riviera between Toulon and Cannes. Blaskowitz, though badly outnumbered and lacking air defence, brought up troops, stabilized the front, and led a fighting withdrawal to the north to avoid encirclement. U.S. Army units pursued Blaskowitz's forces up through the Vosges mountains before pausing to regroup and refuel. There, Blaskowitz's troops were reinforced by the 5th Panzer Army under Hasso von Manteuffel. Blaskowitz wanted to entrench his forces, but Hitler ordered him to immediately counterattack the U.S. Third Army. Both Manteuffel and Blaskowitz realized the futility of such an action, but obeyed orders, and their attack caught U.S. forces in disarray and pushed them back to near Lun√©ville on 18‚Äì20 September 1944, at which point resistance stiffened and the attack was suspended. As a result, Hitler summarily relieved Blaskowitz, replacing him with Hermann Balck. Campaign in the West 1944‚Äì45 Blaskowitz (second from right) surrenders German forces in the Netherlands to Canadian officers. In December 1944, Blaskowitz was recalled to his previous command and ordered to attack in the vicinity of Alsace-Lorraine in support of the ongoing Ardennes offensive. On 1 January 1945 Army Group G engaged the U.S. 7th Army during Operation Nordwind, forcing them to withdraw. Blaskowitz was subsequently transferred to the Netherlands, where he succeeded Kurt Student as commander of Army Group H. For the following three months he conducted a fighting withdrawal against the British 2nd Army, and was awarded the Swords to his Knight's Cross. This command was redesignated in early April 1945 and Blaskowitz became commander-in-chief of the northern (still occupied) part of the Netherlands. During the Dutch famine of 1944‚Äì45, Blaskowitz made an agreement with the Allies that if they did not bomb German positions, Allied airdrops of food and medicine to the Dutch civilian population would be allowed. On 5 May Blaskowitz was summoned to the Hotel de Wereld in Wageningen by General Charles Foulkes, (commander of I Canadian Corps), to discuss the surrender of the German forces in the Netherlands. Prince Bernhard, acting as commander-in-chief of the Dutch Interior Forces, attended the meeting. Blaskowitz agreed with all proposals by Foulkes. However, nowhere in the building ‚Äì some sources say nowhere in the whole town ‚Äì could a typewriter be found. Thus, the surrender document could not be typed. The next day, both parties returned and, in the presence of both Foulkes and Prince Bernhard, Blaskowitz signed the surrender document, which in the meantime had been typed.http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca Postwar Blaskowitz was charged with war crimes during the Nuremberg Trials in the High Command Trial (Case No. XII). In one notorious case he was accused of ordering the execution of two deserters after the German surrender. He committed suicide on 5 February 1948: after breaking away from his guards, he threw himself off a balcony into the inner courtyard of the court building. Blaskowitz's biographer Richard John Giziowski leans towards the possibility that he was murdered by former SS men who hated him for his past complaints against them and had reasons to fear that he might implicate them further (Blaskowitz's fellow prisoners were the first who circulated this story). Both the indictment and the suicide have been considered an enigma by scholars ever since, because he was later acquitted on all counts and had been told by his defense to expect to be acquitted.

It uses wheels with a low spoke count for reduced air drag. Scott Riding posture often used on a road bicycle A racing bicycle, also known as a road bike, and once popularly known as a ten speed, is a bicycle designed for competitive road cycling, a sport governed by and according to the rules of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). The UCI rules were altered in 1934 to exclude recumbent bicycles. The most important characteristics about a racing bicycle are its weight and stiffness which determine the efficiency at which the power from a rider's pedal strokes can be transferred to the drive-train and subsequently to its wheels. To this effect racing bicycles may sacrifice comfort for speed. The drop handlebars are positioned lower than the saddle in order to put the rider in a more aerodynamic posture. The front and back wheels are close together so the bicycle has quick handling. The derailleur gear ratios are closely spaced so that the rider can pedal at their optimum cadence. Other racing bicycles, especially those used in time trialling, prioritize aerodynamics over comfort.  Distinction between road bicycles and others  Bicycles for racing on velodromes are track bicycles; bicycles for racing offroad are mountain bicycles, cyclo-cross bicycles or cycle speedway bicycles; bicycles that race according to the rules of the International Human Powered Vehicle Association include faired recumbent bicycles which, on flat ground, are the fastest bicycles in the world. Recumbents were excluded from the UCI definition of a bicycle on 1 April 1934. Time trial bicycles are a subset of road bicycles that are designed for time trial events. The UCI rules for these bikes are slightly less prescriptive than those for \\"massed start road races\\" (see rules 1.3.020 to 1.3.023). Triathlon bicycles are governed by International Triathlon Union (ITU) rules, which allow more recent technological developments than do the UCI rules. Frame The frame of a road bicycle must, according to the UCI regulations, be constructed using a \\"main triangle\\" with three straight tubular shapes‚Äîthe top tube, down tube, and seat tube. These three tubes, and other parts of the frame, need not be cylindrical, however, and many racing bicycles feature frames that use alternative shapes. Traditionally, the top tube of a racing bicycle is close to parallel with the ground when the bicycle is in its normal upright position. Some racing bicycles, however, have a top tube that slopes down towards the rear of the bicycle; the \\"compact\\" frame geometry was popularized by Giant. Frame manufacturers are free to use any material they choose in the frame. For most of the history of road racing, bicycle frames were constructed from steel tubing, and aluminium and titanium alloys were also used successfully in racing bicycles. Racing bicycles in these three materials are still commercially available and are still used by some amateur racing cyclists or in vintage racing classes. However, virtually all professional road racing cyclists now use frames constructed from various carbon fiber composite materials, and a typical modern carbon fiber frame weighs less than 1 kg (2.2 lbs). Particularly since the introduction of carbon fiber frames, the shape of the tubes that make up the frame has increasingly diverged from the traditional cylinder, either to modify the ride characteristics of the bicycle, reduce weight, or simply achieve styling differentiation. However, a recent trend in road bicycle frame design is tubing claimed to reduce aerodynamic drag, adopting many design features from time trial bicycles. While many professional riders, particularly sprinters, use \\"aero road bikes\\", as of 2018 a substantial fraction of professional racers use bikes with limited or no aerodynamic tube shaping.  Racing wheels and tires  Most road bicycles use 700C bicycle wheels (622 mm bead seat diameter) with matching 20‚Äì25 mm wide tires. As of 2018, there has been a trend towards wider wheels and tires (up to 28 mm nominal width in some cases), which have been found to increase rider comfort and decrease rolling resistance without unduly affecting aerodynamics. The wheels greatly affect the performance of a racing bike. The rim of the wheel can be shaped for greater aerodynamic efficiency making a triangular cross-section to form a teardrop with the tire. For hill climbs, however, energy losses due to the higher weight of most aerodynamic rims are greater than the aerodynamic drag reduction that they offer, so a traditional lighter box-sectioned rim is often used to make it go faster. For aerodynamics and rotating weight, it is generally better to reduce the number of spokes in the wheel. For high-end wheelsets, the spokes can be shaped to have a bladed cross-section, further reducing wind resistance. The most common material for a wheel rim is aluminum alloy, with molded carbon fiber rims being a popular choice for pro-level racers and enthusiasts. Carbon fiber rims are lighter than the same shape in aluminium, allowing riders to choose \\"deeper\\", more aerodynamic rims without an unacceptable weight penalty. Race- grade wheelsets are very expensive and often fragile. Riders who race often choose to own at least two pairs of wheels: a heavier, more durable, and cheaper wheelset for training, and a lighter, more aerodynamic wheelset for racing. Racers with sufficient resources may have multiple racing wheelsets to choose from depending on the course and weather conditions; deeper rims lose their aerodynamic advantage, and are hard to control, in high crosswinds, and on mountainous courses the lightest possible wheelset may be preferred by some riders. To reduce both air resistance and rolling resistance on the road, tires are lightweight, narrow, and have a thin, smooth tread. They are inflated to a high pressure, typically around 8 bar (820kPa/120psi); track racing tires can be inflated up to circa 14 bar. Until recently, most racing bikes used tubular tires which have no beads: they are sewn around the tube and glued to the rim. These tires provide an advantage in weight (lacking the relatively heavy wire bead), rolling resistance, grip and pinch flat protection, but their greatest advantage lies in the ability to use a very lightweight simple box-section rim, rather than the U-shaped clincher rim. A U-shaped clincher rim must be made of relatively heavier gauge material to prevent the tire pressure from spreading the inherently weak U shape and allowing the tire to come off the rim. Advances in tire technology, however, have seen the far more practical (due to greater ease of changeability) clincher (beaded) tire close the gap. Some manufacturers create tubular- clincher tires, where the tires are sewn around the tubes and have a bead, but there is some debate as to the effectiveness of a tubular-clincher tire. Proponents believe that it has all the advantages of a tubular tire made to fit a clincher rim, but critics argue that the design includes disadvantages inherent to both systems‚Äîthe rim weight is still high, the tire is more expensive than a standard clincher tire, and repairing a puncture on a tubular clincher is as inconvenient as it is with a standard tubular tire. However, a particular benefit of the tubular-clincher design is that the risk of pinch flats is very low (like the tubular tire), yet it allows the use of the more popular clincher wheel. Wheel moment of inertia is a controversial subject. In this article: wheel theory, the author does some calculations on wheel effects. Moment of inertia changes result in a decrease in watts of between .004 and .022%, while lower mass provided between .2 and .46%, and better aerodynamics provided between .6 and 1.8% decrease in power. Therefore, wheel moment of inertia effects are neither noticeable nor important. At the same time, a product launched in 2008 to dynamically alter the rotating inertia of bicycle wheels claims to have \\"outperformed the standard, equivalent wheel by 5.6sec/mile.\\" Racing components Road bike components are collectively referred to as the groupset. The quality of the groupset determines how refined the bike feels, how much maintenance it requires, and contributes to the performance of the bike. The three major groupset manufacturers of complete groupsets for racing bicycles are Shimano, SRAM, and Campagnolo. Some companies only produce specific components of the groupset, such as Full Speed Ahead (often abbreviated to FSA). The companies have different design strategies, and some cyclists have great brand loyalty for one or the other. In the early 1990s, Shimano introduced dual-control with a system called Shimano Total Integration (STI). STI is characterized by its combined brake and shift levers, or \\"brifters\\". Previously, the shifters were mounted on the stem, handlebar ends or the down tube of the frame. Dual control addressed the problem of having to reposition a hand to change gears. STI was followed by the competing Campagnolo/Sachs Ergolever. SRAM uses a technology known as Double Tap for their integrated shifter/brake lever. In the mid 1990s Mavic, known for their wheelsets, introduced an electronic shifting system which was pioneered in the Tour de France by American Greg LeMond and later on by Briton Chris Boardman, who liked the fact that the system allowed him to shift from his aerobars and his brake levers. The system did not catch on due to technological hurdles. In 2009, Shimano commercially released the Dura-Ace Di2 electronic shifter, and Campagnolo and SRAM followed suit in the early 2010s. As of 2018, the vast majority of top-level professional teams use electronic shifting, as do many amateur riders. Mechanical derailleurs remain popular with amateur racers and recreational riders for cost reasons. Groupset manufacturers have gradually increased the number of gears on racing bicycles, allowing a greater range between the highest and lowest gears while maintaining relatively small gaps between each successive gear. As of 2018, most racing bicycles used in professional racing have 2 front chainrings and 11 gears on the rear cassette. Carbon fiber has also become more popular for components. Shimano, Campagnolo and SRAM have introduced carbon fiber for their high-end shifters and brake levers, cranks, and parts of their derailleurs. Carbon fiber stems, handlebars, shoe soles, forks and seatposts are also more commonplace, including integrated stem/handlebar combinations. The advantages of carbon fiber are low weight as well as increased vibration damping leading to a more comfortable ride. Racing bicycles were required to use caliper brakes by UCI regulation, but manufacturers began producing road bikes with disc brakes for recreational use in the mid-2010s, and their use was trialled in professional racing in 2016 and 2017. Disc brakes offer better stopping performance, particularly in wet conditions. Rider disquiet over the crash safety of disc brakes led to the introduction of versions with chamfered edges to reduce the risk of the rotating disc acting as a cutting blade. In 2018, the UCI concluded the trial and legalised the use of disc brakes in all road racing events. While some professional teams still use caliper brakes, which are lighter and may be marginally more aerodynamic, an increasing proportion of teams have switched to discs as of 2018. Other uses For recreational road cycling, the road-style bicycles with drop handlebars used to be the norm in the 1980s, along with the touring bicycle, (a drop-handlebar bike with a slightly longer wheelbase to provide a smoother ride and less sensitivity to steer and balance disturbances). These designs, called \\"road bikes\\" or colloquially, \\"roadies\\" or \\"racing bikes\\", have become less popular in recent years. The Mountain bike geometry, with its straight handlebars and upright sitting position (resembling the city bike), have moved into the high- performance spaces, and high production volumes have brought down costs significantly. Owing to the lower air resistance and better body stance for pushing, road bicycles tend to be more efficient for use on smooth roads. Cyclo-cross bicycles, which are used for racing on off-road circuits, are closer to racing bikes than to mountain bikes. They have wider, treaded tires and cantilever brakes instead of caliper brakes but are still less efficient than racing bikes at higher speeds. UCI rules The UCI rules currently specify that a road bicycle have the following characteristics: * be a vehicle with a front wheel steered by a handlebar and a rear wheel driven by a system comprising pedals and a chain by the legs moving in a circular movement * that the only points of support are the following: the feet on the pedals, the hands on the handlebars and the seat on the saddle * wheels must be of equal diameter, between 70 cm and 55 cm, and must have minimum 12 spokes; spokes can be round, flattened or oval, as far as no dimension of their sections exceeds 10 mm * maximum length 185 cm * maximum width 50 cm * the peak of the saddle must be at least 5 cm behind a vertical plane passing through the bottom bracket spindle * the saddle must be between 24 cm and 30 cm in length * the distance between the bottom bracket spindle and the ground must be between 24 cm and 30 cm * the distance between the vertical passing through the lower bracket spindle and the front wheel spindle must be between 54 cm and 65 cm * the distance between the vertical passing through the bottom bracket spindle and the rear wheel spindle must be between 35 cm and 50 cm * the maximum internal distance between the front fork ends is 10.5 cm, and of the rear stays 13.5 cm * minimum mass 6.8 kg (14.99 lb) * frame must be built around a main triangle, constructed of tubular elements (that may have non-circular cross-sections) such that the form of each encloses a straight line * The maximum height of the frame elements shall be 8 cm and the minimum thickness 2.5 cm. The minimum thickness shall be reduced to 1 cm for the chain stays and the seat stays. The minimum thickness of the elements of the front fork shall be 1 cm; these may be straight or curved. The top tube may slope, provided that this element fits within a horizontal template defined by a maximum height of 16 cm and a minimum thickness of 2.5 cm Note that the regulations regarding the dimensions of the bike are allowed exception, given that the rider can demonstrate a morphological need for the exception based on limb size or other factors. These rules effectively and purposely rule out recumbent bicycles, and have done so since 1934.  Road bicycles for non- competitive use  Road bicycles are built for casual recreational use, often labeled as \\"sportif\\" bicycles or \\"dropped-bar fitness bikes\\". These have much in common with a competitive racing bicycle, but the frame geometry is relaxed to make the bicycle more comfortable over long distances, though less effective for short bursts of speed. They usually have a wider range of gear ratios (with greater gaps between each ratio) and fewer high-tech racing features.

Company history The company was founded by the brothers Edgar and Elmer Apperson shortly after they left Haynes-Apperson; for a time they continued to use a FR layoutont-mounted flat- twin engine, following it with a horizontal four. Apperson cars In 1904, Apperson offered vertical fours in two models. The 1904 Apperson Touring Car was a touring car model. Equipped with a tonneau, it could seat 6 passengers and sold for US$6000. The vertical-mounted straight-4, situated at the front of the car, produced 40 hp (29.8 kW). A 4-speed transmission was fitted. The steel-framed car weighed 2800 lb (1270 kg). The wheel base was 96 inches. The Apperson offered electric lights, a novelty for the time, and used a modern cellular radiator. The 25 hp (18.6 kW) version weighed 1800 lb (816 kg) and sold for US$3500. In 1906 the company cataloged a 95 hp (71 kW) four at $10,500. The next year the first of the famed Jackrabbit speedsters rolled off the line; this was a 60 hp (45 kW) that sold for $5000. For a time, the entire range was known as the \\"Jack Rabbit\\" - in 1913 a 32.4 hp (24 kW) four and a 33.7 hp (25 kW) six were listed, and a 33.8 hp (25 kW) 90-degree V-8 of 5.5 L (5502 cc/335 in3) followed in 1914. Roadplane models introduced In 1916 the company announced production of the \\"Roadplane\\" six and eights. The term \\"Roadplane\\" did not refer to a specific model but was a marketing concept devised by Elmer Apperson that was applied to the \\"Chummy Roadster\\" and the \\"Touring\\" car. Elmer took the unusual step of patenting the \\"Chummy Roadster\\" design (see:\\"U.S. Patent 48359\\"). The \\"Silver-Apperson\\", designed by Conover T. Silver, was launched in 1917; the model was known as the \\"Anniversary\\" after 1919. A sedan proprietary with six cylinders of 3.2 L (3243 cc/197 in3) appeared in 1923, and a Lycoming eight-cylinder was offered beginning in 1924. Final production By 1924, Apperson and Haynes were both losing sales; a rumored remarriage came to naught, and Apperson folded for good despite the introduction of four-wheel brakes on the 1926 models.

The complex is noted for its beautiful and well-preserved medieval frescoes. The churches are inside Rusenski Lom Nature Park. History Ivanovo rocks near the church complex The caves in the region had been inhabited by monks from the 1220s, when it was founded by the future Patriarch of Bulgaria Joachim I, to the 17th century, where they hewed cells, churches and chapels out of solid rock. At the peak of the monastery complex, the number of churches was about 40, while the other premises were around 300, most of which are not preserved today. Second Bulgarian Empire rulers such as Ivan Alexander and Ivan Asen II frequently made donations to the complex, as evidenced by donor portraits in some of the churches. Other patrons included nobles from the capital Tarnovo and nearest big medieval town Cherven, with which the monastery complex had strong ties in the 13th and 14th century. It was a centre of hesychasm in the Bulgarian lands in the 14th century and continued to exist in the early centuries of the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria, but gradually decayed. The Rock-hewn Churches of Ivanovo were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979. Preserved heritage The monastery complex owes much of its fame to 13th- and 14th century frescoes, preserved in 5 of the churches, which are thought of as wonderful examples of Bulgarian mediaeval art. The rock premises used by the monks include the St Archangel Michael Chapel (\\"The Buried Church\\"), the Baptistery, the Gospodev Dol Chapel, the St Theodore Church (\\"The Demolished Church\\") and the main Church, with the 14th century murals in the latter one being arguably the most famous of all in Ivanovo and noted as some of the most representative examples of Palaeologan art. Many century-old inscriptions have also been preserved in the monastical premises, including the famous indented inscription of the monk Ivo Gramatik from 1308‚Äì1309.

It is a Grade I listed building. The site was originally the location of a Celtic Brittonic fort known as Din Guarie and may have been the capital of the kingdom of Bernicia from its foundation in 420 to 547. After passing between the Britons and the Anglo-Saxons three times, the fort came under Anglo-Saxon control in 590. The fort was destroyed by Vikings in 993, and the Normans later built a new castle on the site, which forms the core of the present one. After a revolt in 1095 supported by the castle's owner, it became the property of the English monarch. In the 17th century, financial difficulties led to the castle deteriorating, but it was restored by various owners during the 18th and 19th centuries. It was finally bought by the Victorian era industrialist William Armstrong, who completed its restoration. The castle still belongs to the Armstrong family and is open to the public. History =Medieval history= Built on a dolerite outcrop, the location was previously home to a fort of the indigenous Celtic Britons known as Din Guarie and may have been the capital of the kingdom of Bernicia, the realm of the Gododdin people,'An English empire: Bede and the early Anglo- Saxon kings' by N. J. Higham, Manchester University Press ND, 1995, , from the realm's foundation in c. 420 until 547, the year of the first written reference to the castle. In that year the citadel was captured by the Anglo- Saxon ruler Ida of Bernicia (Beornice) and became Ida's seat.The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, entry for 547. The castle was briefly retaken by the Britons from his son Hussa during the war of 590 before being retaken later the same year.Hope-Taylor, pp. 292-293 In c. 600, Hussa's successor √Üthelfrith passed it on to his wife Bebba, from whom the early name Bebbanburh was derived. Vikings destroyed the original fortification in 993. Aerial photograph from 1973 showing the position of the castle, northeast of Bamburgh village The Normans built a new castle on the site, which forms the core of the present one. William II unsuccessfully besieged it in 1095 during a revolt supported by its owner, Robert de Mowbray, Earl of Northumbria. After Robert was captured, his wife continued the defence until coerced to surrender by the king's threat to blind her husband. Bamburgh then became the property of the reigning English monarch. Henry II probably built the keep as it was complete by 1164. Following the Siege of Acre in 1191, and as a reward for his service, King Richard I appointed Sir John Forster the first Governor of Bamburgh Castle. Following the defeat of the Scots at the Battle of Neville's Cross in 1346, King David II was held prisoner at Bamburgh Castle. During the civil wars at the end of King John's reign, the castle was under the control of Philip of Oldcoates. In 1464 during the Wars of the Roses, it became the first castle in England to be defeated by artillery, at the end of a nine-month siege by Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, the \\"Kingmaker\\", on behalf of the Yorkists. =Modern history= The Forster family of Northumberland continued to provide the Crown with successive governors of the castle until the Crown granted ownership (or a lease according to some sources) of the church and the castle to another Sir John Forster in the mid 1500s, after the Dissolution of the Monasteries.Skulldugerous John ForsterSt Aidan Bamburgh History and Heritage The family retained ownership until Sir William Forster (d. 1700) was posthumously declared bankrupt, and his estates, including the castle, were sold to Lord Crew, Bishop of Durham (husband of his sister Dorothy) under an Act of Parliament to settle the debts in 1704. Crewe placed the castle in the hands of a board of trustees chaired by Thomas Sharp, the Archdeacon of Northumberland. Following the death of Thomas Sharp, leadership of the board of trustees passed to John Sharp (Thomas Sharp's son) who refurbished the castle keep and court rooms and established a hospital on the site. In 1894, the castle was bought by the Victorian industrialist William Armstrong, who completed the restoration. During the Second World War, pillboxes were established in the sand dunes to protect the castle and surrounding area from German invasion and, in 1944, a Royal Navy corvette was named HMS Bamborough Castle after the castle. The castle still remains in the ownership of the Armstrong family. After the War, the castle became a Grade I Listed property. The description included this comment about the status of the building in 1952 and its history: BAMBURGH CASTLE > Castle, divided into apartments. C12; ruinous when acquired by Lord Crewe in > 1704 and made habitable after his death by Dr. Sharpe ... Acquired by Lord > Armstrong, who had extensive restoration and rebuilding of high quality by > C.J. Ferguson, 1894-1904. Squared sandstone and ashlar. =Location= An 1825 plan of the castle About to the south on a point of coastal land is the ancient fortress of Dunstanburgh Castle and about to the north is Lindisfarne Castle on Holy Island. Inland about 16 miles (26 km) to the south is Alnwick Castle, the home of the Duke of Northumberland. =Environmental factors= Air quality levels at Bamburgh Castle are excellent due to the absence of industrial sources in the region. Sound levels near the north‚Äìsouth road passing by Bamburgh Castle are in the range of 59 to 63 dBA in the daytime (Northumberland Sound Mapping Study, Northumberland, England, June 2003). Nearby are breeding colonies of Arctic and common terns on the inner Farne Islands, and of Atlantic puffin, European shag and razorbill on Staple Island. =Archaeology at Bamburgh= Archaeological excavations were started in the 1960s by Brian Hope-Taylor, who discovered the gold plaque known as the Bamburgh Beast as well as the Bamburgh Sword. Since 1996, the Bamburgh Research Project has been investigating the archaeology and history of the Castle and Bamburgh area. The project has concentrated on the fortress site and the early medieval burial ground at the Bowl Hole, to the south of the castle. During excavations at the Bowl Hole between 1998 and 2007, the remains of 110 individuals from the 7th and 8th century were discovered in that graveyard. Finally, in 2016, they were moved into the crypt of St Aidan's Church, Bamburgh; the crypt can be viewed by visitors through a small gate. =Armstrong and Aviation Artefacts Museum= The castle's laundry rooms feature the Armstrong and Aviation Artefacts Museum, with exhibits about Victorian industrialist William Armstrong and Armstrong Whitworth, the manufacturing company he founded. Displays include engines, artillery and weaponry, and aviation artefacts from two world wars. In popular culture John Varley (1827; Metropolitan Museum of Art). =Selected literary appearances= The castle features in the ballad The Laidly Worm of Spindleston Heugh written in circa 1270. Late medieval British author Thomas Malory identified Bamburgh Castle with Joyous Gard, the mythical castle home of Sir Launcelot in Arthurian legend. In literature, Bamburgh, under its Saxon name Bebbanburg, is the home of Uhtred, the main character in Bernard Cornwell's The Saxon Stories. It features either as a significant location or as the inspiration for the protagonist in all books in the series, starting with The Last Kingdom, and the sequels The Pale Horseman, The Lords of the North, Sword Song, The Burning Land, Death of Kings, The Pagan Lord, The Empty Throne, Warriors of the Storm, The Flame Bearer and War of the Wolf.

The reserve embraces 6 km2 of protected area and a buffer zone of 5.4 km2. The lake's depth varies from 1 to 3 m. There is a museum constructed, where a collection of stuffed species typical for the reserve is arranged.  History  While Lake Srebarna was studied many times in the past by foreign biologists, the first Bulgarian scientist to take an interest in the area was Aleksi Petrov, who visited the reserve in 1911. In 1913, the whole of Southern Dobrudja was incorporated in Romania, but was returned to Bulgaria in 1940, when the area was visited once again by Petrov to examine the colonies of birds that nest there. View towards the Srebarna reserve The area was proclaimed a nature reserve in 1948 and is a Ramsar site since 1975. The reserve was recognized as World Natural Heritage Site under the 1972 Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage and included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1983.  Legends  There are several legends about the origin of the lake's name. The one is about a khan named Srebrist, who died in the neighbourhood whilst engaging in an unequal battle with the Pechenegs. A second one tells about a boat full of silver (srebro in Bulgarian) along the shores of the lake. According to a third one, which is regarded as most plausible, the name comes from the silvery reflections on the lake's surface during full moon.  Flora and Fauna  = Flora = Pelicans in the museum There are hydrophyte species such as reed in and around the lake. The reserve is home to 139 plant species, 11 of them are in danger of extinction outside the territory of Srebarna. = Fauna = A wide variety of fauna exists in the area. 39 mammal, 21 reptile and amphibian and 10 fish species inhabit the reserve, which is most famous for the 179 bird species that nest on its territory, including multiple species of herons and cormorants, the Dalmatian pelican, the mute swan, the greylag goose, the marsh harrier and the bluethroat.

It is usually caused by a penetrating injury to the vessel, which then bleeds, but forms a space between the above two layers, rather than exiting the vessel. It may be pulsatile and can resemble a true aneurysm. A true aneurysm involves all three layers of the blood vessel. A dissecting aneurysm is when blood from the vessel lumen tracks between the two inner layers, the intima and the tunica media. This can cause blockage of the flow. A perivascular hematoma is a collection of blood that is external to the three vessel layers. Due to being close to the vessel, it can also be pulsatile, and can be mistaken for a pseudoaneurysm or aneurysm. Femoral pseudoaneurysms may complicate up to 8% of vascular interventional procedures. Small pseudoaneurysms can spontaneously clot, while others need definitive treatment. A pseudoaneurysm may also occur in a chamber of the heart following myocardial damage due to ischemia or trauma. A pseudoaneurysm of the left ventricle is a potentially lethal complication from a myocardial infarction. Signs and symptoms Pseudoaneurysms usually present as a painful, tender, pulsatile mass. The overlying skin is sometimes erythematous (red). They can sometimes be confused with abscesses. The patient may describe a history of catheterization or trauma, and they may note that the pulsatile mass is gradually expanding. Diagnosis The diagnosis should be suspected if the patient has a history of arterial trauma. This can include arterial access for catheterization (i.e. the common femoral artery), blunt trauma (i.e. to an extremity), or penetrating trauma (i.e. gunshot or blast injury). Blunt or penetrating trauma can cause a disruption in the arterial wall, leading to a pseudoaneurysm. A patient with such a history who presents with a painful, pulsatile, tender mass at the site of catheterization or trauma should be suspected to have a pseudoaneurysm. The diagnosis should be confirmed using Duplex ultrasonography, which will reveal arterial blood flow into the pseudoaneurysm. A CT angiogram or conventional angiogram can also diagnose a pseudoaneurysm. It is important that the diagnosis be confirmed before any procedures are performed. Incision and drainage of a suspected abscess, which instead is a pseudoaneurysm, could lead to extensive hemorrhage. Locations Radial artery pseudoaneurysm. A pseudoaneurysm can form in communication with essentially any artery in the body. With the high volume of cardiac catheterizations performed today, femoral artery pseudoaneurysms, in addition to pseudoaneurysms of arteriovenous fistulas used for hemodialysis, are the most common. Pseudoaneurysms can form in the legs days, months, or even years after blunt or penetrating trauma. Although aneurysms and left ventricular aneurysms may involve any wall segment, aneurysms in the posterolateral wall are frequently due to pseudoaneurysms. In contrast, the most common location for a true left ventricular aneurysm involves the apex of the heart. A pseudoaneurysm can also occur in the aorta as a consequence of traumatic aortic rupture. Outside of the heart, pseudoaneurysms associated with pancreatitis can occur in several of the abdominal vessels, including the superior mesenteric artery, pancreaticoduodenal artery, and others. Treatment Many options exist for the treatment of pseudoaneurysms. While surgery was the gold-standard treatment in the past, several less invasive treatment options are popular today. =Covered stent= Since the pseudoaneurysm communicates with an artery through a hole in the arterial wall, a covered stent may be placed endovascularly across this hole to \\"exclude it,\\" or to prevent it from receiving blood flow from the artery. The covered stent is composed of metal and is covered with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or another sterile fabric-like material. The covered stent remains in place permanently, and the pseudoaneurysm, without a continuous flow of arterial blood, then thromboses. Advantages of this technique are that it has a high success rate without the need for an open surgery. Complications include covered stent migration, persistent leakage of blood into the pseudoaneurysm, fracturing (breaking) of the stent, and infection of the stent or of the arterial insertion site. =Ultrasound probe compression= Another option for treatment is ultrasound probe compression of the neck of the pseudoaneurysm. The \\"neck\\" of the pseudoaneurysm is the narrow path of blood flow between the artery, through the arterial wall, and into the pseudoaneurysm cavity. The artery, neck, and pseudoaneurysm are seen on ultrasound. The ultrasound probe can be pushed firmly against the patient's skin to compress the neck of the pseudoaneurysm for usually about 20 minutes. During this time, the blood within the pseudoaneurysm clots; after the probe is then removed, the pseudoaneurysm will hopefully remain clotted and will not continue to expand. The procedure may be stopped early due to patient discomfort. It is less successful if the patient is obese, since there is more fatty tissue between the skin and the neck of the pseudoaneurysm. It also is less successful if the neck of the pseudoaneurysm is wider, since it is less likely to clot off during the period of compression. Finally, it is also much less successful if the patient is taking aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin), or another anticoagulant, since these would prevent clotting of blood within the pseudoaneurysm. Advantages are that this is the least invasive method of stopping arterial blood flow into a pseudoaneurysm. =Ultrasound-guided thrombin injection= In addition to covered stent placement, another popular, minimally-invasive technique used today is ultrasound-guided thrombin injection. Thrombin (factor IIa in the coagulation cascade) is a clotting factor that converts fibrinogen into fibrin, which then polymerizes to form a blood clot. Under ultrasound guidance, thrombin can be injected directly into a pseudoaneurysm, causing it to clot. Advantages are that the technique is relatively easy to perform, is successful, and is minimally invasive. One contraindication to this procedure is if there is an arteriovenous fistula (communication between an artery and vein), in addition to the pseudoaneurysm. This occurs with about 10% of pseudoaneurysms. If this is present, thrombin injected into the pseudoaneurysm could then enter the venous circulation and possibly lead to distant thrombosis. =Surgical ligation (with or without distal bypass)= Open surgery may also be performed to remove pseudoaneurysms or prevent them from expanding. If the artery is small and \\"expendable\\" - the tissues it supplies have adequate collateral blood flow - then the artery supplying the pseudoaneurysm may be ligated both proximally and distally to the pseudoaneurysm. The pseudoaneurysm may or may not be removed. If the tissues supplied by the artery do not have sufficient collateral flow (the artery is not expendable), then a vein or synthetic graft would have to be anastomosed proximally and distally to allow for continued blood flow around the pseudoaneurysm. Advantages are that the technique has been successful in the treatment of pseudoaneurysms for many years. However, it is more invasive (a large skin incision is necessary), and there is more postoperative pain and a risk for wound infection. One of the less invasive options may be preferred in a patient with many comorbidities, who is at high risk for surgery.

Set in the near future, it features the exploits of gun sharks (hitmen) Finnigan \\"Finny\\" Sinister and Ramone \\"Ray\\" Dexter in the city of Downlode, sprawled across Central Europe \\"like a hit and run victim\\". Occasional stories have taken place in other cities, or off planet. The size of Downlode is never specified in the strip, but it appears to stretch from Spain to eastern Europe. The appearance of the city largely depends on the artist of the particular storyline: often it appears to be styled after the former soviet bloc, with many statues and wide boulevards, plus dilapidated cars such as Trabants and VW Beetles; however, in other strips the city looks clean and futuristic, like the Mega-City One of Judge Dredd stories in the same magazine. The story \\"London Town\\" shows that London and Great Britain still exist separate from Downlode. Police drive generic saloon cars resembling Ford Crown Victorias, painted as the cars of the Los Angeles Police Department; black on bonnet and boot, with DCPD written on the white doors. In early strips the police used hovercars with \\"Polizei\\" written on the side, and this hovercraft technology appears in later stories, retrofitted to old cars such as Checker Cabs. Sinister and Dexter themselves drive a 1950s Edsel, this started out as a hardtop but in the story \\"Alibi of Broadway\\" had its roof torn off and was re-built as a convertible. Advanced robots are occasionally seen in the stories, but appear to be very rare, and are usually controlled by humans and are unable to think for themselves. Some characters also have several cyborg implants, including Ramone himself who has a \\"Fony Headcase\\" television implanted into his eyes. In one story a malfunction in this temporarily gave him the ability to see in infra-red and detect a small hole in a crime-bosses' personal forcefield (referred to as a very rare and expensive technology). The atmosphere of the stories suggests a time of economic recession. Sophisticated army hardware is sold off to the highest bidder, usually criminal gangs. Additionally many strips feature the city looking worn and run-down even in \\"rich\\" areas. In the story \\"Mother 'Lode and the Red Admiral\\" it is mentioned that Korea has developed cold fusion and become the world's richest nation. Ramone uses a pair of \\"Ruger Nines\\", often drawn as silver 9mm pistols, or occasionally as revolvers. Sinister's \\"Minigun\\" (not to be confused with General Electric's Minigun) has been drawn differently by different artists: small pump-action shotgun, large double-barrelled revolver and small machine pistol. It can fire different kinds of bullets, including high explosives. The title \\"Sinister Dexter\\" is a play on words; in Latin sinister means \\"left\\" or \\"on the left side\\" and dexter means \\"right\\" or \\"on the right side\\". The term is mentioned in the 1960s Discordian religious book Principia Discordia. The initial inspiration for Sinister Dexter came from Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta's characters in Pulp Fiction. However Dexter is designed to look like Wesley Snipes. Plot In early stories the duo work as freelance hit-men, taking contracts from their \\"fact-totem\\", a PDA-like device, and killing people for money. The kingpin of crime in these early stories is Holy Moses Tanenbaum. Eventually a large price is put on the head of Holy Moses himself, expecting Sinister and Dexter to take the contract he sends hit-men to kill them, after killing these they decide to take the contract, as their reputation would dictate they have to take the toughest jobs. After a battle which results in the duo both being nearly killed Holy Moses is killed and the person who put out the contract is revealed to be his wife, Demi Octavo. A brief period of gang violence follows as various gangs attempt to take control of the city's underworld for themselves. Eventually The Czar, moblord of the Russian mafia calls a conference of gang leaders in an attempt to resolve the situation and hires Sinister and Dexter as security for the meeting. During the meeting, Sinister and Dexter discover that, naturally, every single gang has made plans to assassinate the other gang leaders. After these are fought off The Czar reveals \\"himself\\" to be a robot double outfitted with a close-focus nuke in its chest cavity. With the gang leaders dead The Czar is able to take over the underworld for himself. Following the gang-war, Sinister and Dexter are hired by an accountant working for a Mr Bronsky \\"Ballpeen\\" Hammer as protection to 'expedite' the handover of the year-end accounts. The rendezvous between the accountant and Mr Hammer's men in Fred Quimby Municipal Park is violently interrupted by the Department of Taxation, causing the \\"Infamous Audit Showdown of '66\\". As a result of the carnage, Sinister and Dexter decide to take a holiday and The Czar recommends that they visit a nightclub in Asbestopol known as the Bawdwalk. At the club a pair of hired muscle known as Buddy Boom and Buddy Bing are threatening the club owner, Kilopatra, so Sinister and Dexter step in to help him and scare off the heavies, thus picking themselves up a holiday job. Kilopatra sends the pair off to pay a visit to local mob-king Philly O'Fisch, as it was he who sent the two heavies after Kilopatra. Sinister and Dexter kill the two Buddies and warn Philly off Kilopatra under threat of taking one of the many contracts that Philly has on his head. When they return from this job, they run into Demi Octavo who is at the nightclub under a pseudonym, she tells the pair that the word spread that she was the one who put out the hit on Holy Moses Tanembaum so she decided to escape Downlode. The Czar suggested that she head to the Bawdwalk, which convinces Sinister and Dexter that The Czar has set them all up. The pair invade Philly's island lair and kill him and all of his minions and return to Downlode to take out the Czar using a giant, cyborg alligator that ticks (referencing J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan). After this, Demi Octavo takes over as mob-queen and hires Sinister and Dexter as her personal guardians. Stories from now on generally revolve around them protecting her empire, though occasionally they also take contracts from other people. During this time Demi's younger sister, Billi Octavo, decides to become a Gunshark, but a misunderstanding results in her killing some respected city dignitaries. During the ensuing police chase Sinister explains the unwritten \\"Gunshark Code\\" that they never kill cops or \\"innocents\\". Later Billi hacks into the police database and finds the dignitaries she killed were actually guilty of \\"perverted\\" crimes and it had been covered up. She released this data to the media and the police were forced to abandon the hunt. It is also revealed most rank-and-file police officers actually support Gunsharks, because they only kill other criminals which results in less criminals overall. Later Dexter begins to see visions on his \\"Headcase\\" TV which suggest he is a wanted serial killer, the Blemvoi Butcher. It turns out the actual killer also has a \\"Headcase\\" and the signals have been transposed. The Butcher lures the pair and two police officers, including the \\"by-the-book\\" Tracey Weld, into a trap. Dexter kills the butcher and this eventually leads to his becoming romantically involved with Weld. In Eurocrash, Demi sees her empire begin to crumble, so plans to marry Prince Guapo and unite the two biggest gangs and restore 'peace' to Downlode. The wedding gets hijacked by 'syns' (artificial humanoids) and Finnigan and Ramone fail to protect Demi, who dies. They both blame each other and walk away from their partnership. Downlode Tales depicts Sinister and Dexter going their own ways, with Dexter joining the 'Ass Kickers' D.U.R. police unit to avoid jail, and Sinister putting together his 'whack pack' to avenge Demi's killers. As the city once again descends into turmoil, the pair mentor a trainee Gunshark, Kal Kutter, who accompanies them on several adventures and eventually becomes a highly competent Gunshark in his own right. Another mob boss, called Apellido, begins to take over the city and sends a huge squad of \\"bullet monkeys\\" (inferior but cheaper gunsharks) after Billi Octavo. Sinister attempts to get her out of the city but the other hitmen are chasing the two. Meanwhile, Dexter is with Detective Weld when he hears the news and rushes out of the house with his guns drawn. By chance he is seen by a police officer who tells him to freeze, before going to get out his handcuffs. Dexter misinterprets this as the officer going for his gun and kills him, thereby breaking the gunshark code. He escapes but doesn't get very far before being surrounded. Fearful of being tortured in prison a standoff ensues, and he is eventually shot by Weld. Sinister is last seen speeding out of the city, with a wounded Billi octavo in the car, still pursued by the bullet monkeys. The story line at the end of 2005 (over the instalments \\"...and Death shall have no dumb minions\\" and \\"Festive Spirits\\") seemed to suggest that the deadly duo were both dead. However, this didn't stop some one-page \\"gag strips\\" from appearing in the Judge Dredd Megazine This issue has now been addressed in passing as part of the twist in the, initially apparently unconnected, series Malone. The \\"Festive Spirits\\" story, in which both appeared as skeletal zombies who were apparently ignored by their old friends, is hinted at merely being one of Malone's dreams. After surviving the showdown with his boss, Apellido, Sinister changed his face and took drugs to try to forget his past, fleeing offworld to Generica. It wasn't until Rocky Rhodes told him of his true identity that he returned to Downlode City to get revenge on Apellido making sure he knows that he's now alive. It was also revealed that Ramone also survived the shooting but was rendered quadriplegic. Sinister allowed himself to be captured and was sent to the same prison as Ramone, with a plan to escape. After enlisting the help of two other prisoners, he executes the break-out and escapes with Ramone in a wheelchair. Heading to an old doctor friend it is revealed Ramone has been kept immobilised by an implant in his spine. With this removed, and surviving an attack by another Apellido hit-squad, the head for a run-down lock-up. There Sinister stashed the Edsel and their old guns. They collect these and drive back into Downlode to again work as gunsharks, bringing the series full circle. Characters * Finnigan Rapunzel Sinister, is a superstitious Irish hitman.

The tomb is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  General information  Discovered and excavated in 1982 during excavations at Mound No 7 of the East Mound Necropolis of Sboryanovo (Ginina Mogila) - a tumulus of the early Hellenistic period, the Sveshtari tomb was built in the first quarter of the 3rd century BC. The tomb's construction reflects the fundamental structural principles of Thracian cult buildings. The tomb's architectural decor is considered to be unique, with polychrome half-human, half-plant caryatids and painted murals. The ten female figures carved in high relief on the walls of the central chamber and the decorations of the lunette in its vault are the only examples of this type found so far in the Thracian lands. It is an exceptional monument of the Getae, a Thracian people who were in contact with the Hellenistic and Hyperborean worlds, according to ancient geographers. In 2012, archaeologists uncovered a significant treasure near the village. The treasure included a golden ring, 44 female figure depictions and 100 golden buttons, found in 150 tombs from the 4th century BC. It has been suggested that it is part of the site of the Getan city of Helis. SveshtariTumulus.jpgThe Entrance to the Tomb Mound Thomb-Sveshtari.jpgThe interior of the tomb Thomb-Sveshtari-2.jpgThe Thracian Tomb of Sveshtari  History  The Getae had been federated in the Odrysian kingdom in the 5th century BC. It is not known how the relations between Getae and Odrysians developed. The Balkan campaigns of Philip II of Macedon between 352 and 340 BC shattered Odrysian authority and the Getae profited from the situation. By the second half of the 4th century, the Getae occupied sites on both banks of the lower Danube and this region flourished as never before. The new Macedonian conquests, secured with considerable military power, caused consternation in the adjoining territories and thus stimulated the political fusion of the Getic tribes. The Getic tomb at Sveshtari in the western Ludogorie in Bulgaria is also supposed to have been near the location of Helis. In the vicinity of the mausoleum, the remains of a large ancient city were found along with dozens of Getic mound tombs. The settlement is situated in a natural stronghold, a plateau surrounded like a peninsula by the ravines of Krapinets River. The outer stone wall, up to 4m thick, follows the edges of the peninsula and defends a territory of about 10 hectares. The inner wall, of similar construction, encloses a roughly quadrilateral area of about 5 hectares. The fortified territory was relatively densely occupied by dwellings connected by a network of thoroughfares. Dating finds such as amphorae stamps and coins indicate that this settlement existed between c. 335 and c. 250 BC.

The factory had previously been used by the Phoenix car company. History The car came about following discussions between J. G. Parry-Thomas, design engineer at Leyland Motors, Reid Railton, his assistant and Henry Spurrier, chairman of Leyland Motors. Leyland had made 50 four-cylinder engine blocks intended to be used in fast delivery vans, but the project was not proceeded with. The three discussed what to do with the blocks, and the building of a 2-litre sporting car was agreed. A prototype was built to test the new engine using an Enfield-Allday chassis and the car taken to Brooklands for the 1924 Easter Meeting. The engine had an overhead camshaft with the same unusual valve springing using leaf springs as those found on Parry Thomas's Leyland Eight. Drive was to the rear wheels via a Moss 4-speed gearbox and ENV spiral- bevel rear axle. It was one of the first English cars to use an electric fuel pump. Production of two variants was started in 1926 at the Letchworth works, a low-chassis sporting model and a high-chassis touring type. Two and four- seater bodies were available on the high-chassis at ¬£525 and probably only the two-seater on the low-chassis at ¬£550. Parry Thomas died in March 1927 attempting to break the World Land Speed Record in his car Babs, and with his death Railton lost interest in the Arab and the Letchworth works closed after only about 6 or 7 cars were made. The remaining components were bought by Thomson & Taylor, where Railton was working, based at Brooklands and a few more cars were assembled. This was something of a pity, as the car was an impressive performer with the two-seater high chassis good for 80 mph, and the Super Sports was said to have been capable of going . One high chassis is known to have been supercharged and is said to have achieved . Two cars are known to survive, both low chassis.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed June 8, 2011 is one of the major streams of north-central Middle Tennessee, United States, and one of the major tributaries of the Cumberland River. Via the Cumberland and the Ohio Rivers, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed. The lower portion of the Harpeth is designated as a \\"scenic river\\" under the Tennessee Scenic Rivers Act. Course The Harpeth rises in the westernmost part of Rutherford County, Tennessee, just to the east of the community of College Grove in eastern Williamson County. The upper portion of the river has been contaminated to some extent by the operation of a lead smelting plant located near the Kirkland community that recycled used automobile batteries from the 1950s until the 1990s. The stream flows generally westerly into Franklin, the county seat of Williamson County. It has operated as a suburb of Nashville since the 1960s. The Harpeth is both the source of the area's drinking water supply and the main site of its sewage disposal. At Franklin, the course of the river turns more northwesterly; a few miles northwest of Franklin is the mouth of one of the Harpeth's main tributaries, the West Harpeth, which drains much of the southern portion of Williamson County. Near this site is an antebellum plantation house called \\"Meeting of the Waters\\". The river in this area flows quite near the Natchez Trace (the original road of that name, not the modern Parkway named for it, which is several miles distant). The river shortly crosses into Davidson County and receives the flow of the Little Harpeth River, another important tributary. The stream flows near the unincorporated Nashville suburb of Bellevue and shortly after this flows into Cheatham County. The course of the river in Cheatham County is very meandering. A few miles into Cheatham County, it is joined by another major tributary, the South Harpeth, which drains some of the southwestern portion of Davidson County, southeastern Cheatham County, and a small portion of northwesternmost Williamson County. In Cheatham County is a remarkable civil engineering feat of the early 19th century. Ironmaster Montgomery Bell built an iron mill near the \\"Narrows of the Harpeth\\". At a horseshoe bend, Bell's workers cut a tunnel through approximately 200 yards (180 m) of solid rock. They used black-powder blasting techniques to build a diversion tunnel to power the mill, which Bell called \\"Pattison Forge\\" (often spelled, incorrectly, \\"Patterson\\") after his mother's maiden name. Bell was so pleased with his mill that he curtailed some of his other area operations and built a home near the site. Today, the diversion tunnel and some \\"slag\\" are about all that remain of his mill operation. The Montgomery Bell Tunnel is a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. Also at the \\"Narrows of the Harpeth\\" is a prehistoric site known as Mound Bottom, noted for the complex earthwork constructions built from 950 and occupied into the 15th century. This area has several ceremonial and burial earthwork mounds of the Native American Mississippian culture, which preceded those historic tribes of the area known to European encounter. Bell's diversion tunnel and the sheer bluffs nearby are now part of the Narrows of the Harpeth section of Harpeth River State Park, a linear park connecting several natural, historic, and archaeological sites along the lower Harpeth. From this historic site, the flow becomes generally more northerly, but still greatly meandering. The Harpeth soon forms the line between Dickson and Cheatham counties for the last part of its course. A few miles above the mouth are what are known as the Three Islands; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed siting a dam near this location on several occasions and did some preliminary study. It was not supported by a favorable cost-benefit ratio and the project was never built. The lower portion of the Harpeth is very popular with canoeists, supporting canoe-outfitting and related businesses. The mouth of the Harpeth into the Cumberland is near Ashland City, the Cheatham County seat. Near the mouth is a bridge on State Route 49 named in Montgomery Bell's honor. The mouth is just below the Cumberland's Harpeth Island, and is somewhat submerged by the backwaters of the Corps' Cheatham Dam. After the removal of the lowhead dam in the city of Franklin, the Harpeth is Tennessee's second-longest unimpounded stream (the longest being the Buffalo). Name The origin of the name \\"Harpeth\\" is controversial. It is often claimed that the river was named for America's first known serial killers, the Harpe brothers, known as \\"Big Harpe\\" and \\"Little Harpe\\" who were in the area in 1797; this is erroneous since the name existed on maps and documents as early as 1784, predating their fame. A late-18th-century map, published in London, purportedly shows the steam as the \\"Fairpath\\"; there is some dissension about whether the name is of Native American origin or perhaps a corruption of the rather common English name \\"Harper\\". There is no dispute that the title of the song \\"Harper Valley PTA\\" by Tom T. Hall is derived from this stream, indirectly. Hall, long an area resident, says that the song's name derives from Harpeth Valley Elementary School in Davidson County near Bellevue, but he also states that the song was definitely not based on any occurrence there; rather, he simply liked the sound of it.Bernard de la Harpe sailed into Mobile Bay in 1719 under the French flag to locate a port and administrative center for the territory which the French claimed along the Gulf coast, the Mississippi basin and the Ohio Valley. De la Harpe kept journals and made maps which were published about 1750, and the maps were used by Lewis & Clark in their explorations. De la Harpe's maps included Tenase/Tennessee and the Chiriqui/Cherokee villages region. While there is no label on the Harpeth River on de la Harpe's map, he is the logical source for the name. Before English settlement what is now Nashville was known as French Lick and there was a French presence. The headwaters of the Harpeth even flow from a hill called Versailles. SEE: Bernard de la Harpe. SEE: USGS map Another possible origin for the name of the Harpeth River was presented by Edward D. Hicks in a paper read before the Tennessee Historical Society and published by the ‚ÄúAmerican Historical Magazine‚Äù in 1900. Hicks comments upon the influence of classical literature read by learned gentlemen in the 18th Century. One source popular among many in the English-speaking world, including America, was the ‚ÄúSpectator‚Äù published by Joseph Addison. The ‚ÄúSpectator‚Äù contained articles on philosophy, morals and the classics. In publication number 584, printed in 1714, is found the antediluvian love story of Hilpa, Harpath and Shalum. Harpath comes to an untimely end drowning in a river as he attempted to cross it. ‚ÄúThe river is called to this day from his name, who perished in it, the river Harpath‚Ä¶‚Äù. Hicks does not offer the claim that this is the definitive origin of the name however he does say it is ‚Äúcertainly appropriate‚Ä¶I submit it as the most probable and ingenious theory I can suggest.‚Äù Early 18th-century maps including Matthew Carey‚Äôs 1795 Map of Tennessee as well as that of John Reid, Imlay‚Äôs American Topography, Arrowsmith, and Stockdale use the spelling Harpath River which differs from the modern spelling of ‚ÄúHarpeth‚Äù. The exception is John Russell‚Äôs 1794 map of the Southwest Territory published in London circa 1794. The earliest known written reference is found in the diary of John Lipscomb. His July 1784 entry mentions the ‚ÄúHarpath‚Äù river. In addition, contemporary historian Virginia Bowman gives credence to Hicks' theory in her comprehensive book on early sites and homes of Williamson County, Tennessee.

Glasgow to Ayr trains which leave Glasgow at xx00 and xx30 between 0830 and 1830 and from Ayr leaving at xx23 and XX50 between 0850 and 1623 will run non stop between Kilwinning and Glasgow Central. After 1900, the service reduces to 4 trains per hour. All trains call at Paisley and Kilwinning with 2 trains going to Ayr while the other 2 serve Ardrossan and Largs. On a Sunday, a reduced service operates, 3 trains per hour run with 2 going to Ayr and 1 going to Largs. 5 trains daily run to Ardrossan Harbour to meet the ferry to Brodick. On Sunday evening, it reduces to only 2 trains per hour with 1 to Ayr and Largs. Troon, Prestwick and Ayr are also served by the Glasgow South Western Line with trains running between Glasgow- Girvan/Stranraer and Kilmarnock- Girvan/Stranraer. As of August 2020, all services are run by Class 380s. Until they were withdrawn, Class 314s were used on some peak time services when 380s were in short supply. In the August 2020 timetable, Largs and Ardrossan Harbour both run an hourly service and there are roughly 3 trains per hour to Ayr, however the frequency changes several times during the day. There were 5 trains per day between Ayr and Edinburgh until March 2020, these services were already planned to be axed in May 2020 and are not present in the August 2020 timetable.

Here the line branches in two, with one branch running south along the coast to Troon and Ayr. This branch also serves Prestwick Airport station, which opened in 1994. The other branch runs north along the coast to Ardrossan or Largs, becoming a single track for passenger trains after Saltcoats. Beyond Ayr, 'Sprinter' DMUs continue south towards Girvan and Stranraer.

Biblical narrative The Worship of the Golden Calf by Filippino Lippi (1457‚Äì1504) When Moses went up into Mount Sinai to receive the Ten Commandments (), he left the Israelites for forty days and forty nights. The Israelites feared that he would not return and demanded that Aaron make them \\"gods\\" to go before them (). Aaron gathered up the Israelites' golden earrings and ornaments, constructed a \\"molten calf\\" and they declared: \\"These [be] thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.\\" (Exodus 32:4) Aaron built an altar before the calf and proclaimed the next day to be a feast to the . So they rose up early the next day and \\"offered burnt-offerings, and brought peace-offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.\\" (Exodus 32:6) God told Moses what the Israelites were up to back in camp, that they had turned aside quickly out of the way which God commanded them and he was going to destroy them and start a new people from Moses. Moses besought and pleaded that they should be spared (), and God \\"repented of the evil which He said He would do unto His people.\\" Moses went down from the mountain, but upon seeing the calf, he became angry and threw down the two Tablets of Stone, breaking them. Moses burnt the golden calf in a fire, ground it to powder, scattered it on water, and forced the Israelites to drink it. When Moses asked him, Aaron admitted to collecting the gold, and throwing it into the fire, and said it came out as a calf (). =Exclusion of the Levites and mass execution= The Bible records that the tribe of Levi did not worship the golden calf. \\"Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said: 'Whosoever is on the 's side, let him come unto me.' And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him. And he said unto them: 'Thus saith the , the God of Israel: Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.' And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.\\"() Other mentions in the Bible Moses destroying the tables (watercolor circa 1896‚Äì1902 by James Tissot) The golden calf is mentioned in . The language suggests that there are some inconsistencies in the other accounts of the Israelites and their use of the calf. As the version in Exodus and 1 Kings are written by Deuteronomistic historians based in the southern Kingdom of Judah, there is a proclivity to expose the Israelites as unfaithful. The inconsistency is primarily located in Exodus 32:4 where \\"gods\\" is plural despite the construction of a single calf.Coogan, 2009, pg. 116‚Äì117. Jeroboam's golden calves at Bethel and Dan Worshiping the Golden Calf According to , after Jeroboam establishes the northern Kingdom of Israel, he contemplates the sacrificial practices of the Israelites. His concern was that the tendency to offer sacrifices in Jerusalem, which is in the southern Kingdom of Judah, would lead to a return to King Rehoboam. He makes two golden calves and places them in Bethel and Dan. He erects the two calves in what he figures (in some interpretations) as substitutes for the cherubim built by King Solomon in Jerusalem.Coogan, pg. 117, 2009 However, in the Antiquities of the Jews (v. VIII: 8), which is taken from the Septuagint, Josephus states:\\"He made two golden heifers, and built two little temples for them, the one in the city Bethel, and the other in Dan...and he put the heifers into both the little temples in the forementioned cities.\\" This is quite incompatible with any resemblance of the \\"calves\\" to the Egyptian Apis Bull, but quite indicative of the Egyptian goddess Hathor, to whom (in the Egyptian text \\"Destruction of Mankind\\") is attributed cataclysmic events similar to those recounted in Exodus. Richard Elliott Friedman says \\"at a minimum we can say that the writer of the golden calf account in Exodus seems to have taken the words that were traditionally ascribed to Jeroboam and placed them in the mouths of the people.\\" Friedman believes that the story was turned into a polemic, exaggerating the throne platform decoration into idolatry, by a family of priests sidelined by Jeroboam.Friedman, Richard Elliott \\"Who Wrote the Bible?\\" 1987 pp 72‚Äì3 The declarations of Aaron and Jeroboam are almost identical: * 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt' (Exod 32:4, 8); * 'Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt (1 Kings 12:28) After making the golden calf or golden calves both Aaron and Jeroboam celebrate festivals. Aaron builds an altar and Jeroboam ascends an altar (Exod 32:5‚Äì6; 1 Kings 12:32‚Äì33).: \\"The subsequent declarations of Aaron's people and Jeroboam are almost identical: 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt' (Exod 32:4, 8); 'Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land ...\\" Jewish views The Levites killed about 3,000 Israelites who worshipped the Golden Calf (1984 illustration by Jim Padgett) In Legends of the Jews, the Conservative rabbi and scholar Louis Ginzberg wrote that the worship of the golden calf was the disastrous consequence for Israel who took a mixed multitude in their exodus from Egypt. Had not the mixed multitude joined them, Israel would not have been misled to worship this molten idol. The form of the calf itself came from a magical virtue of an ornament leaf with the image of the bull which is made by Aaron.Ginzberg, Louis (1909). The Legends of the Jews Volume III : The Golden Calf (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society The devotion of Israel to this worship of the calf was partly explained by a circumstance at passing through the Red Sea, when they beheld the most distinct creature about the Celestial Throne which is the resemblance of ox, then they thought it was an ox who had helped God in their journey from Egypt. After seeing Hur son of Miriam who was carelessly murdered by the people following his rebuke of their ingratitude action to God, Aaron was willing rather to take a sin upon himself to make an idol than to cast the burden of an evil deed upon the people if they commit so terrible sin of killing a priest and prophet among them. Also there would be among the Israelites no priestly caste, and the nation would have been a nation of priests only if Israel had not sinned through worshiping the golden calf that the greater part of the people lost the right to priesthood, except the tribe of Levi as the only tribe who remained faithful to God and did not partake in this sinful deed.Ginzberg, Louis (1909) The Legends of the Jews Volume III : The Revelations in the Tabernacle (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society According to Nachman of Breslov, everyone contributed to the building of the Tabernacle, and the contribution that each Jew made was his or her good points. Thus, the Tabernacle was built by the good points found in each person; this was sufficient to counteract the blemish of the golden calf.Likutey Halakhot I The ‚Äúgood points‚Äù are reflected in the ‚Äúgold, silver and copper‚Äù that the Jews donated. The various colors of these metals reflect the Supernal Colors and the beauty of a person's good deeds.Rebbe Nachman of Breslov. Exodus-Leviticus Jerusalem/New York, Breslov Research Institute Islamic narrative The incident of the worship of the golden calf is narrated in the second chapter of the Quran, named The Heifer, and other Islamic literature. The Quran narrates that after they refused to enter the promised land, God decreed that as punishment the Israelites would wander for forty years. Moses continued to lead the Israelites to Mount Sinai for divine guidance. According to Islamic literature, God ordered Moses to fast for thirty days, and upon the near completion of the thirty days, Moses ate a scented plant to improve the odour of his mouth. God commanded Moses to fast for ten more days, before receiving the guidance for the Israelites. When Moses completed the fasts, he approached God for guidance. During this time, Moses had instructed the Israelites that Aaron was to lead them. The Israelites grew restless, since Moses had not returned to them, and after thirty days, a man the Quran names Samiri raised doubts among the Israelites. Samiri claimed that Moses had forsaken the Israelites and ordered his followers among the Israelites to light a fire and bring him all the jewelry and gold ornaments they had. Samiri fashioned the gold into a golden calf along with the dust on which the angel Gabriel had trodden, which he proclaimed to be the God of Moses and the God who had guided them out of Egypt. There is a sharp contrast between the Quranic and the biblical accounts of the prophet Aaron's actions. The Quran mentions that Aaron attempted to guide and warn the people from worshipping the golden calf. However, the Israelites refused to stop until Moses had returned. The righteous separated themselves from the pagans. God informed Moses that he had tried the Israelites in his absence and that they had failed by worshipping the golden calf. Returning to the Israelites in great anger, Moses asked Aaron why he had not stopped the Israelites when he had seen them worshipping the golden calf. The Quran reports that Aaron stated that he did not act due to the fear that Moses would blame him for causing divisions among the Israelites. Moses realized his helplessness in the situation, and both prayed to God for forgiveness.(Quran 7:167-174) Moses then questioned Samiri for the creation of the golden calf; Samiri justified his actions by stating that he had thrown the dust of the ground upon which Gabriel had tread on into the fire because his soul had suggested it to him. Moses informed him that he would be banished and that they would burn the golden calf and spread its dust into the sea. Moses ordered seventy delegates to repent to God and pray for forgiveness. The delegates traveled alongside Moses to Mount Sinai, where they witnessed the speech between him and God but refused to believe until they had witnessed God with their sight. As punishment, God struck the delegates with lightning and killed them with a violent earthquake. Moses prayed to God for their forgiveness. God forgave and resurrected them and they continued on their journey. In the Islamic view, the calf-worshipers' sin had been shirk (), the sin of idolatry or polytheism. Shirk is the deification or worship of anyone or anything other than Allah, or more literally the establishment of \\"partners\\" placed beside God, a most serious and unforgivable sin, with the calf-worshipers' being ultimately forgiven being a mark of special forbearance by Allah. Criticism and interpretation According to modern scholarship, there are two versions of the Ten Commandments story, in E (Exodus 20) and J (Exodus 34), this gives some antiquity and there may be some original events serving as a basis to the stories. The Golden Calf story is only in the E version and a later editor added in an explanation that God made a second pair of tablets to give continuity to the J story.Friedman, Richard Elliott. 2003. The Bible with Sources Revealed, p 177. The actual Ten Commandments as given in Exodus 20 were also inserted by the redactor who combined the various sources.Friedman, Richard Elliott. 2003. The Bible with Sources Revealed, p 153. According to Michael Coogan, it seems that the golden calf was not an idol for another god, and thus a false god. He cites as evidence: Importantly, there is a single calf in this narrative. While the people refer to it as representative of the \\"gods\\", this is a possessive form of the word Elohim ( elo'hecha, from ), which is a name of God as well as general word for \\"gods\\". While a reference to singular god does not necessarily imply Yahweh worship, the word usually translated as 'lord' is Yahweh in the original, so at least it can't be ruled out. In the chronology of Exodus the commandment against the creation of graven images had not yet been given to the people when they pressed upon Aaron to help them make the calf, and that such behavior was not yet explicitly outlawed. Another understanding of the golden calf narrative is that the calf was meant to be the pedestal of Yahweh. In Near Eastern art, gods were often depicted standing on an animal, rather than seated on a throne. This reading suggests that the golden calf was merely an alternative to the ark of the covenant or the cherubim upon which Yahweh was enthroned. The reason for this complication may be understood as # a criticism of Aaron, as the founder of one priestly house that rivaled the priestly house of Moses, and/or # as \\"an attack on the northern kingdom of Israel.\\" The second explanation relies on the \\"sin of Jeroboam,\\" who was the first king of the northern kingdom, as the cause of the northern kingdom's fall to Assyria in 722 BCE. Jeroboam's \\"sin\\" was creating two calves of gold, and sending one to Bethel as a worship site in the south of the Kingdom, and the other to Dan as a worship site in the north, so that the people of the northern kingdom would not have to continue to go to Jerusalem to worship (see 1 Kings 12:26‚Äì30). According to Coogan, this episode is part of the Deuteronomistic history, written in the southern Kingdom of Judah, after the fall of the northern kingdom, which was biased against the northern kingdom. Coogan maintains that Jeroboam was merely presenting an alternative to the cherubim of the Temple in Jerusalem, and that calves did not indicate non-Yahwehistic worship. The documentary hypothesis can be used to further understand the layers of this narrative: it is plausible that the earliest story of the golden calf was preserved by E (Israel source) and originated in the Northern kingdom. When E and J (Judah source) were combined after the fall of northern kingdom, \\"the narrative was reworked to portray the northern kingdom in a negative light,\\" and the worship of the calf was depicted as \\"polytheism, with the suggestion of a sexual orgy\\" (see Exodus 32:6). When compiling the narratives, P (a later Priest source from Jerusalem) may have minimized Aaron's guilt in the matter, but preserved the negativity associated with the calf. Alternatively it could be said that there is no golden calf story in the J source, and if it is correct that the Jeroboam story was the original as stated by Friedman, then it is unlikely that the golden calf events as described in Exodus occurred at all. Friedman states that the smashing of the Ten Commandments by Moses when he beheld the worship of the golden calf, is really an attempt to cast into doubt the validity of Judah's central shrine, the Ark of the Covenant. \\"The author of E, in fashioning the golden calf story, attacked both the Israelite and Judean religious establishments.\\" =As adoration of wealth= A metaphoric interpretation emphasizes the \\"gold\\" part of \\"golden calf\\" to criticize the pursuit of wealth.

The company originally made the four-cylinder \\"Motorvique\\" cyclecar based on the Ajax built by the Briscoe brothers in France. It had a 4-cylinder 12 hp engine and was different from the French market Ajax only in that it did not use friction drive.

Races typically take place in the autumn and winter (the international or \\"World Cup\\" season is October‚ÄìFebruary), and consist of many laps of a short (2.5‚Äì3.5 km or 1.5‚Äì2 mile) course featuring pavement, wooded trails, grass, steep hills and obstacles requiring the rider to quickly dismount, carry the bike while navigating the obstruction and remount.uci.ch UCI Cyclo- cross regulationsusacycling.org USA Cycling Federation rulebook Races for senior categories are generally between 30 minutes and an hour long, with the distance varying depending on the ground conditions. The sport is strongest in the traditional road cycling countries such as Belgium (Flanders in particular), France and the Netherlands. Cyclo-cross has parallels with mountain bike racing, cross-country cycling and criterium racing. Many of the best cyclo-cross riders cross train in other cycling disciplines; however, cyclo-cross has reached such size and popularity that some racers are specialists, and many prioritize cyclo-cross races over other disciplines. Cyclo-cross bicycles are similar to road racing bicycles: lightweight, with somewhat narrow tires and drop handlebars. They are typically differentiated by their greater tire clearances, lower gearing, stronger frames, cantilever brakes or disc brakes and more upright riding position. They also share characteristics with mountain bicycles in that they use knobby tread tires for traction and, increasingly, disc brakes. They have to be lightweight because competitors need to carry their bicycle to overcome barriers or slopes too steep to climb in the saddle. The sight of competitors struggling up a muddy slope with bicycles on their shoulders is the classic image of the sport, although unridable sections are generally a very small fraction of the race distance. Compared with other forms of cycle racing, tactics are fairly straightforward, and the emphasis is on the rider's aerobic endurance and bike-handling skills. Drafting, where cyclists form a line with the lead cyclist pedaling harder while reducing the wind resistance for other riders, is of much less importance than in road racing where average speeds are much higher than in cyclo-cross. A cyclo-cross rider is allowed to change bicycles and receive mechanical assistance during a race. While the rider is on the course on one bike, their pit crew can clean, repair and oil a spare. Origins and history A cyclo-cross race in O√±ati, Basque Country, Spain, in 1947 There are many stories about the origins of cyclo-cross. One is that European road racers in the early 1900s would race each other to the next town over from them and that they were allowed to cut through farmers' fields or over fences, or take any other shortcuts, in order to make it to the next town first. This was sometimes called steeple chase as the only visible landmark in the next town was often the steeple. This was a way for them to stay in shape during the winter months and put a twist on road racing. In addition, riding off-road in more difficult conditions than smooth pavement increased the intensity at which the cyclists were riding and improved their on-the-road bike handling abilities. Forced running sections, or portage, were incorporated to help deliver warm blood to the feet and toes, as well as exercise other groups of muscles. Daniel Gousseau of France is credited as having inspired the first cyclo-cross races and organized the first French National Championship in 1902.Cyclocross: History & What You Should Know Konrad, Gabe: \\"Cyclocross: History & What You Should Know\\".

Yale University Press, 2004. the sport began to spread to countries bordering France. Belgium organized its first National Championship in 1910, Switzerland did so in 1912, then Luxembourg in 1923, Spain in 1929 and Italy in 1930. Cyclo-cross proved itself as a sport extending beyond the boundaries of France when in 1924 the first international race, Le Crit√©rium International de Cross-Country Cyclo-P√©destre, was held in Paris. Like many international cycle sports, cyclo-cross is administered by the Union Cycliste Internationale; although it was not until the 1940s, around 40 years after cyclo-cross' inception, that the UCI began its regulation and the first world championship was held in Paris in 1950. The first United States Cyclo-cross National Championships took place on October 20, 1963 in Palos Park, IL, near Chicago.cvccbike.com Schwartz, Bob. The 1963 US Cyclocross National Championships. These championships in the midwest continued until 1969. Cyclo- cross began to become popular in the United States in the 1970s, in New England and California. The Cyclo-cross National Championships restarted in 1975 in Berkeley, CA and have continued to be held every year at various locations throughout the United States. The Surf City race series held in Santa Cruz, CA has contributed to the history of cyclo-cross in the United States. The sport has experienced a growth in popularity in the United States since the mid 1990s.books.google.com Burke, Edmund R. & Pavelka, Ed: \\"The Complete Book of Long Distance Cycling\\", Page 254. Rodale, 2000. Cyclo-cross races are now regularly held in the fall and winter seasons throughout the United States and continue to grow in popularity. Racing seasons Cyclocross is typically an autumn and winter sport, the northern hemisphere season running from September to February. The World Championships take place in late January. The Canada and US national championships are held in November and January, with little racing after that except in the climates of the Southern and Western United States like Florida and California, respectively. The cyclocross racing season within southern hemisphere nations typically runs from May to August. Riders' age categories for cyclocross under UCI rules are currently determined by their age on 1 January which lies in the middle of the international season, i.e. they compete in the same category that they would be in for the following road season. Equipment =Bicycles= Focus cyclo- cross bicycle Cyclo-cross bicycles generally resemble road racing bicycles. Cyclo-cross-specific frames differ with their wider tire clearances, knobby tires, cantilever or disc brakes, and lower gearing. Cables are generally routed on the upper side of the top tube, which allows the rider to carry the bike comfortably on the right shoulder through portage sections, and prevents cable contamination by dirt. Popular on many cyclocross bikes is routing the brakes so that the right brake is often the front brake. This is done to allow the left hand to control speed while approaching obstacles requiring the bike to be carried, while the right hand grips the frame ready to lift the bike onto the shoulder as soon as the rider's feet touch the ground. As a high-end bicycle purpose-built for a specific sport competition, they also differ from ordinary \\"hybrid or trekking\\" cross bikes, which are general-purpose utility bikes fitted with slightly wider 700C tires for use on unpaved paths or trails.Ballantine, Richard, Richard's 21st Century Bicycle Book, New York: Overlook Press (2001), , pp. 34, 307 Cyclo-cross bike design and frame geometry has evolved over the years. The first cyclo-cross bikes were touring- type road bikes, used for their cantilever bosses, slacker angles and wider tire clearance. Over time as the sport became more formalized, frame angles changed for quicker handling and bottom brackets heights were raised to clear broken ground. Most cyclo-cross frames have a non-compact (flat or near-flat top tube) frame design for easier shouldering. Some design features have recently begun to change, for example, a heightened bottom bracket was typical 10+ years ago; now many cyclo-cross-specific frames do not have elevated bottom brackets, in fact many have a lower bottom bracket than road racing bicycles; this is favorable since the lower seat height makes for easier remounting, and a lower center of gravity increases stability. Many cyclo- cross bicycles are now set up with a single chainring and chain \\"drop\\" guards. A single chainring setup simplifies mechanics and reduces the chance of the chain derailing on a bumpy course. People who do run a double chain-ring set up on their bicycles generally use a 36-46 gearing. Many professional-level cyclo-cross bikes are set up with deep-section carbon tubular wheels, not for the purpose of aerodynamics, but to keep the wheel from being entrapped in deep sand or mud sections. Tubular tires are used to avoid pinch flats, decrease rolling resistance and increase grip with lower tire pressures. In addition, single speed cyclo-cross bikes are becoming increasingly popular for a variety of reasons, including lower initial cost of setup, ease of use and maintenance, and decreased likelihood of mechanical failure on the course. =Clothing= Cyclocross in Portland, Oregon Clothing is similar to that of road racing. However, since cyclo-cross is a cold-weather sport there is an emphasis toward warmer clothing such as long sleeves, tights, knickers and arm and leg warmers. While many racers will use standard two-piece road kits, there is a very strong preference to wear one piece skinsuits to maximize freedom of movement. The other advantage of skinsuits is that they are tighter, preventing the jersey from getting caught on stray tree branches during some singletrack sections of the race course. The one piece construction of the skinsuit also prevents it from exposing the torso while the rider shoulders the bike. Mountain bike shoes are adopted, as they allow the competitors to run, unlike their road racing counterparts, and due to their degree of traction (compared to smooth bottoms found on road racing shoes). Toe spikes are used to aid in running up steep muddy slopes and in the adverse underfoot conditions. Full-finger gloves are optional but generally recommended for hand protection and for grip in muddy/wet situations. Experienced riders racing in dry conditions will often eschew gloves, presumably for better tractional feedback though the handlebar, and more natural bike portage. Courses Races usually consist of many laps over a short course, ending when a time limit is reached rather than after a specific number of laps or certain distance; the typical length for senior events is one hour, with 30 and 45 minute races for lower categories being the norm. Generally each lap is around 2.5-3.5 km and is 90% rideable. Races run under UCI rules must have courses that are always at least 3 m wide to encourage passing at any opportunity, but sections of singletrack are common for small races in the US and Great Britain. A variety of terrain is typical, ranging from roads to paths with short steep climbs, off camber sections, many corners and, a defining feature, sections where the rider may need, or would be best advised to dismount and run while carrying the bike. Under-tire conditions include asphalt, hardpack dirt, grass, mud and sand. In comparison to cross- country mountain bike events, terrain is smoother. Less emphasis is put on negotiating rough or even rocky ground with more stress on increased speed and negotiating different types of technical challenges. Each section of the course typically lasts no longer than a handful of seconds. For example, long climbs are avoided in favour of short, sharp inclines. Sections are generally linked together, or long straights broken up, with tight corners. This not only allows a standard length course to fit in a relatively small area, but also forces competitors to constantly change speed and effort. Accelerating out of corners, then having to decelerate for the next before accelerating again is a common theme. Cyclo-cross racers take on two barriers and a run-up at Ludwig's Corner in Pennsylvania Obstacles that force a rider to dismount and run with their bike or to \\"bunny hop\\" include banks too steep to ride up, steps, sand pits and plank barriers. Besides the start/finish area, these obstacles may be placed anywhere on the course that the race director desires. Several race directors have tried to limit bunny hopping for safety reasons by placing barriers in pairs or in triple (although under UCI rule no more than two barriers can appear in succession). The regulation height for a barrier is 40 cm although this is treated as a maximum at smaller events. Plank barriers seem to be more common in the US than in Europe, and UCI regulations only permit one section of them on the course. Tree logs of maximum diameter 40 cm are sometimes used as barriers in North America. Since outside assistance is allowed, pits are included to provide a consistent area for this to occur. A pit to the right of the course is normal since most riders dismount to their left. In larger events a separate pit lane is featured so only those wishing a new bike or other assistance need enter the lane (this type was debuted at the Zeddam, Netherlands World Cup of January 1999). In some cases pits are provided in two different parts of the course. Long-format races, in which riders compete cross country also exist. Examples include the Three Peaks Cyclo-Cross, a 61 km race, Barry-Roubaix, and the American UltraCX Championship Series which consists of seven stages ranging from 80 to 115 km. Technique Although cyclo-cross courses are less technical than those of mountain biking, each particular obstacle requires specific technical abilities of competitors. For example, dirt single-track and streams (like in mountain biking) are also sometimes integrated into the course, depending on the location, both of which require rider experience and technique. Some course sections are extremely muddy, wet or even snowy in the winter, and others are dusty and sandy. Most of these conditions are usually considered too extreme to be ridden with the standard 32c tire, and so much of the challenge of cyclo-cross lies in maintaining traction through loose or slippery terrain at speed. The power of the rider is generally higher over the whole duration of a cross race to overcome greater amounts of rolling resistance from loose dirt or grass. Also common are steps, barriers, ditches, stairs, steep slopes and very deep mud or sand which all require running while carrying the bicycle. As a result, cyclocross is also known as the \\"steeplechase of cycling.\\" This approach was invented by Octave Lapize and proven by Eug√®ne Christophe who in 1913 had to carry his broken bike down the Tourmalet during the Tour de France. Although getting off and on a bike sounds simple, doing so in the middle of a quick-paced race is difficult. Being able to fluidly dismount at speed, pick up and carry the bike, then put it back down and remount smoothly without losing momentum requires practice and skill, as the competitor may do this dozens of times every race. A faulty or slow dismount/remount may cost valuable seconds, waste energy or cause the competitor to crash. Often, when sections are extremely technical or become impossible to ride due to erosion from repeated wear or inclement weather, the racer will carry the bike and jog for an extended time to save energy. A more recent development to overcome obstacles such as barriers and sometimes ditches is the bunnyhop, which came to prominence in 1989 when Danny De Bie used it in his successful World Championship run. Bunny hopping has become less popular as a result of race directors seeking to limit its use by setting up two or three barriers in a row. Skilled riders are still able to hop the obstacles, despite the back to back to back barriers. Sven Nys, an ex-BMX racer, demonstrates the importance of technical skills as he continues to dominate the sport.

The Argonaut Motor Machine Corporation was based in Cleveland, Ohio. The company's president was Richard S. Luntz (1919‚Äì2006). The company announced its production plans for a line of U.S.-made luxury cars in September 1958, planned as the finest and most luxurious in the world. The prices quoted ranged from a low of $28,600 to a high of $36,000; a variety of stainless and other special steels were proposed for the car's manufacture. A supercharged V-12 ohc aluminum air-cooled engine developing some was designed for the Argonaut, and all cars were to carry a four-year guarantee. The company claimed, in its catalogue, that two of its models (the \\"Smoke\\" and the \\"Raceway\\") had maximum speeds approaching 240 mph. A number of high tech features were claimed, among them special tires with interwoven strands of steel to withstand sustained speeds of 200 mph, electric shock absorbers (individually adjustable from the cockpit) and 3 independent braking systems. A news article about the Argonaut announcement appeared in The Washington Post on September 14, 1958, and Popular Science magazine published an article with several illustrations in the January 1959 issue, including a photo of a chassis and engine. A number of local articles also appeared in Cleveland area newspapers over the next few years. The \\"Spotlight on Detroit\\" column on page 12 of the December 1958 issue of Motor Trend Magazine (not available online) has pictures of the frame, a few parts including the instrument panel, and drawings of the different proposed body styles.Motor Trend magazine, December 1958 p. 12 In a 1987 interview, Luntz said that an influential group of backers \\"felt that to put Italian bodies on an American chassis would infuriate the steel companies\\". In one article, these Italian coachbuilders were stated to be Bertone and Touring. Luntz also stated that 3 Argonaut prototypes were built, but all research since has only verified one surviving example: a 392 cubic inch Chrysler marine V-8 engine and 3-speed manual overdrive transmission mounted in a custom-built rolling chassis, but without any body. This is the chassis that was publicly displayed and pictured in newspaper accounts of the period, and was listed (with photo) in an auction catalog from the late 1970s, then owned by a private New York State collector. The Blackhawk Museum in Danville, California, featured a complete Argonaut automobile from 1988 up to about 1997, but this vehicle's appearance bears only a vague resemblance to the Argonaut Raceaway. Rather, its beautifully finished boattail speedster body is more akin to a low-slung mid-1930s Duesenberg. This speedster may have been built on the 'show' chassis; Blackhawk literature makes reference to a '240-MPH speedometer' and a chassis that is a 'formidable feat of engineering'. As of 2005, the Blackhawk Museum was unaware of this car's whereabouts. Two brief Facebook videos posted in 2017 show the boattail backing out of a shipping container in Japan and driving away.

She was a sister of the poet Thomas WyattThomson, Patricia. Sir Thomas Wyatt and his Background. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1964. and a friend of Queen Anne Boleyn, second wife of King Henry VIII of England. Historians have speculated that she was present during Boleyn's execution. Family Margaret Wyatt was the daughter of Sir Henry Wyatt by Anne Skinner, the daughter of John Skinner of Reigate, Surrey.; . She had two brothers: *Sir Thomas Wyatt, who married Elizabeth Brooke, the daughter of Thomas Brooke, 8th Baron Cobham, by Dorothy Heydon, daughter of Sir Henry Heydon and Elizabeth or Anne Boleyn, daughter of Sir Geoffrey Boleyn.. *Henry Wyatt, assumed to have died an infant.. Life Margaret is best remembered for having been a companion of Anne Boleyn, whose family estates lay near the Wyatts' and who later employed Margaret as one of her ladies-in-waiting. A portrait by Hans Holbein the Younger shows a woman presumed to be Margaret at the age of thirty-four, and it is assumed that it was painted around 1540. It is therefore probable that Margaret was close to Anne in age, being born around 1506 (whilst Anne is assumed to have been born around 1501). Few question that there was some form of friendship between Lady Margaret and Queen Anne. There is also a strong tradition which states that Margaret's sister, Mary, was also part of the Queen's social circle and that Margaret's brother, Thomas Wyatt, fell passionately in love with Anne in the 1520s. Another female favourite of the Queen's was Lady Bridget Wingfield, who died while giving birth in 1531. Margaret was one of Anne's chief ladies-in- waiting, and accompanied her to Calais, France in 1532, where it is presumed Anne and Henry VIII made secret plans to marry in the immediate future. It is known that Anne had a lady-in-waiting who \\"she loves as a sister\\", and it has been suggested that this lady was Margaret. She was certainly part of the Queen's circle of favourites. As Mistress of the Queen's Wardrobe, she would presumably have played a leading part in the decadent social life at court in the mid-1530s, which was fuelled by the extravagance of Henry and Anne. Lady Margaret was sent to attend her royal mistress in the Tower of London in May 1536 when the Queen was arrested on charges of adultery, treason and incest. Margaret also attended Anne on the scaffold on 19 May, and even received the last gift of a prayer book from her. After Anne was beheaded, Margaret acted as chief mourner at her small funeral. Anne had written a short farewell to Margaret inside the prayer book: :\\"Remember me when you do pray, ::that hope doth lead from day to day.\\" A sketch by the famed court artist Hans Holbein has been identified as being a sketch of a Queen Anne Boleyn when she was pregnant, but current research suggests that it might have been one of the Wyatt sisters ‚Äî either Margaret or her sister, Mary. Lady Margaret Lee is commemorated in Songs and Sonnets, also known as Tottel's Miscellany, a poetry anthology published by the law printer Richard Tottel in 1557. The book contains poems written by Lady Margaret's brother, Sir Thomas Wyatt, as well as poems by the Earl of Surrey, Nicholas Grimald and a number of anonymous poets. Grimald's funeral elegy, \\"An Epitaph of the Lady Margaret Lee,\\" advises the reader, \\"Man, by a woman learn, this life what we may call,\\" and praises her \\"blood, friendship, beauty, youth,\\" and other qualities (no. 158, 1‚Äì2). Lady Margaret is one of several Tudor ladies memorialized in the volume.Rollins, Hyder Edward. Tottel's Miscellany (1557‚Äì1587). 1929. Rev. ed. 2 vols. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965.

Multilingual User Interface (MUI) is the name of a Microsoft technology for Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office and other applications that allows for the installation of multiple interface languages on a single system. On a system with MUI, each user would be able to select their own preferred display language. MUI technology was introduced with Windows 2000 and has been used in every release since (up to Windows 10). The MUI technology is covered by an international patent titled \\"Multilingual User Interface for an Operating System\\". The inventors are Bjorn C. Rettig, Edward S. Miller, Gregory Wilson, and Shan Xu. Functionally, MUI packs for a certain product perform the same task as localized versions of those product, but with some key technical differences. While both localized versions of software and MUI versions display menus and dialogs in the targeted language, only localized versions have translated file and folder names. A localized version of Windows translates the base operating system, as well as all included programs, including file and folder names, objects names, strings in registry, and any other internal strings used by Windows into a particular language. Localized versions of Windows support upgrading from a previous localized version and user interface resources are completely localized, which is not the case for MUI versions of a product. MUI versions of a product do not contain translated administrative functions such as registry entries and items in Microsoft Management Console. The advantage of using MUIs over localized versions is each user on a computer could use a different language MUI without requiring different versions of software installed and dealing with the conflicts that could arise as a result. For example, using MUI technology, any version of Windows can host Windows applications in any other language. MUI in Windows 2000 and Windows XP MUI products for these versions were available only through volume agreements from Microsoft. They were not available through retail channels. However, some OEMs distributed the product. Up to Windows XP, MUI packs for a product are applied on top of an English version to provide a localized user experience. MUI in Windows Vista and Windows 7 Windows Vista further advanced MUI technology with support for single, language- neutral, language-independent binary files supporting multiple language skins, with the language-specific resources contained in separate binaries. The MUI architecture separates the language resources for the user interface from the binary code of the operating system. This separation makes it possible to change languages completely without changing the core binaries of Windows Vista, or to have multiple languages installed on the same computer while using the same core binaries. Languages are applied as language packs containing the resources required to localize part of or the entire user interface in Windows Vista.

A student of Eug√©nie Brazier, he was one of the most prominent chefs associated with the nouvelle cuisine, which is less opulent and calorific than the traditional cuisine classique, and stresses the importance of fresh ingredients of the highest quality. Paul Bocuse claimed that Henri Gault first used the term, nouvelle cuisine, to describe food prepared by Bocuse and other top chefs for the maiden flight of the Concorde airliner in 1969.France on a Plate BBC Four TV programme 1 December 2008 Contributions to French gastronomy Bocuse in 2007 Bocuse made many contributions to French gastronomy both directly and indirectly, because he had numerous students, many of whom have become notable chefs themselves. One of his students was Austrian Eckart Witzigmann, one of four Chefs of the Century and chef at the first German restaurant to receive three Michelin stars. Since 1987, the Bocuse d'Or has been regarded as the most prestigious award for chefs in the world (at least when French food is considered), and is sometimes seen as the unofficial world championship for chefs. Bocuse received numerous awards throughout his career, including the medal of Commandeur de la L√©gion d'honneur. The Culinary Institute of America honoured Bocuse in their Leadership Awards Gala on 30 March 2011. He received the \\"Chef of the Century\\" award. In July 2012 the Culinary Institute of America announced in The New York Times that they would change the name of their Escoffier Restaurant to the Bocuse Restaurant, after a year-long renovation. In 1975, he created soupe aux truffes (truffle soup) for a presidential dinner at the √âlys√©e Palace. Since then, the soup has been served in Bocuse's restaurant near Lyon as Soupe V.G.E., VGE being the initials of former president of France Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing.

It was one of only 27 restaurants in France to receive a three-star rating in 2017 by the Michelin Guide. However, it lost its record-breaking 55-year long 3-star rating in the 2020 Michelin Guide, sparking controversy in the French culinary world. He also operated a chain of brasseries in Lyon, named Le Nord, l'Est, Le Sud and l'Ouest, each of which specialize in a different aspect of French cuisine. Paul Bocuse's son, J√©r√¥me, manages the \\"Les Chefs de France\\" restaurant which the elder Bocuse co-founded with Roger Verge and Gaston Len√¥tre and is located inside the French pavilion at Walt Disney World's EPCOT. Bocuse was considered an ambassador of modern French cuisine. He was honoured in 1961 with the title Meilleur Ouvrier de France. He had been apprenticed to Fernand Point, a master of classic French cuisine. Bocuse dedicated his first book to him. Institute Paul Bocuse Worldwide Alliance In 2004, the Institut Paul Bocuse Worldwide Alliance was created. In 2014, the Alliance brought together students of 14 nationalities for a course in Lyon. Death Bocuse died of Parkinson's disease on 20 January 2018 in Collonges- au-Mont-d'Or, in the same room above his restaurant, L'Auberge du Pont de Collonges, in which he was born in 1926. He was 91.

Early life and education Hemming was born in Vancouver. His father, Henry Harold Hemming OBE, MC, who had served in the First World War, foresaw the Second, and wanted him to be born in North America. So he sent John's mother, Alice Hemming OBE, a journalist,Biography at The Women's Library:National Life Story Collection: Fawcett Collection on a cruise through the Panama Canal that ended in British Columbia. John and his sister Louisa were brought back to London when he was two months old. He was educated in the United Kingdom at Eton College, in Canada at McGill University, and read history at Oxford where he obtained a D.Litt. doctorate and became an honorary Fellow of Magdalen College. Career In 1961, with fellow Oxford graduates Richard Mason and Kit Lambert (who later managed The Who), he was part of the Iriri River Expedition into unexplored country in central Brazil. The Brazilian mapping agency, IBGE, sent a 3-man survey team to help map these unknown forests and rivers and gave the Expedition permission to name features it found. Sadly, after four months, an unknown indigenous people found the group's trail, laid an ambush, and killed Richard Mason with arrows and clubs. Mason was the last Englishman ever to be killed by a totally unknown and uncontacted tribe. His body was carried out and buried in the British cemetery in Rio de Janeiro.\\"Obituary of Richard Mason\\", by John Hemming, The Geographical Journal, Vol. 127, No. 4 (Dec. 1961), pp. 565‚Äì566 The tribe was contacted in 1973, and was called Panar√°: Hemming visited them in 1998 and wrote about this in The Times.The Times Magazine, 2 January 1999 His first book, The Conquest of the Incas, was published in 1970 and has remained in print, with two revisions, ever since. Because no new documents have been discovered it is often regarded as the definitive work on the Spanish conquistadors' conquest of Peru. This book won the Robert Pitman Literary Prize and the Christopher Award in New York. Hemming had spent the year 1960 travelling to every part of Peru, was for years chairman of the Anglo-Peruvian Society, and has been awarded Peru's two highest civilian honours: El Sol del Peru ('The Sun of Peru', South America's oldest order of chivalry) and the Grand Cross of the Orden al Merito Publico (Order of Merit). He has also written, with the American photographer Edward Ranney, an account of Inca architecture of Peru, Monuments of the Incas, reissued in a revised edition in 2010. Among those he inspired and befriended is Vince Lee, a fellow Andean explorer and writer. His experience on the Iriri River expedition led to a heightened interest in Brazilian indigenous peoples. On various expeditions he visited 45 tribes throughout Brazil ‚Äì four of them (Surui, Parakana, Asurini and Galera Nambikwara) at the time that Brazilian teams made the first-ever face-to-face contact.Tribes of the Amazon Basin: Report for the Aborigines Protection Society by Edwin Brooks, Ren√© Fuerst, John Hemming, Francis Huxley (1972) Over the following 26 years he completed a three-volume history of the indigenous peoples and exploration of Brazilian Amazonia: Red Gold (1978), which covers the period 1500‚Äì1760; Amazon Frontier (1985), covering the period 1760‚Äì1910; and Die If You Must (2004), which describes their changes during the 20th century. The three volumes add up to over 2,100 pages. In 1975, John Hemming became director and secretary of the Royal Geographical Society, a post he held until 1996. The society changed substantially during those 21 years: Its membership more than doubled, finances went from deficits to surplus, and lectures expanded from about 20 per year to involve 450 speakers in a series of Monday-night events in London and at branch offices. Expedition training was introduced with the successful Expedition Advisory Centre (run by Nigel Winser and Shane Winser), the Victorian premises beside Hyde Park were restored, and academic geographers of the Institute of British Geographers merged into the society. Research flourished through a series of projects in Wahiba Sands (Oman), Mount Mulu (Sarawak), Karakoram (Pakistan), Kimberley (Australia), Kora National Park (Kenya), Mkomazi (Tanzania) and Badia desert (Jordan) ‚Äì of which Hemming was co-chairman from 1992‚Äì2004. He personally led the Marac√° Rainforest Project in Brazil (1987‚Äì88) which, with 200 scientists and scientific technicians, became the largest research project in Amazonia organised by any European country ‚Äì in partnership with Brazilian researchers from INPA (Amazon Research Institute) and [SEMA environment agency. Hemming was awarded the RGS's Gold Medal in recognition of his work on the Marac√° project, as well as the Brazilian Ordem do Cruzeiro do Sul (Order of the Southern Cross) and medals from the Royal Scottish Geographical Society and the Boston Museum of Science (Bradford Washburn Medal). John Hemming was or is trustee of many charities, including being one of the founders of Survival International, ten years on the board of The British Council, twelve years at the John Ellerman Foundation, Lepra (leprosy), Earthwatch, The Rainforest Foundation, Gilchrist Educational Trust, Global Diversity Foundation, The Hakluyt Society, the Amazon Charitable Trust, Anglo-Peruvian Society and the Anglo-Brazilian Society. Aside from his involvement in exploration and Latin America, since 1963 he has worked for the Hemming Group Ltd, setting up and running one of the UK's foremost exhibition-organising companies, Brintex Ltd, before becoming chairman until 2015 of this family business, which also publishes trade titles including The MJ (Municipal Journal)'. In April 2008 his book, Tree of Rivers: The Story of the Amazon, was published by Thames and Hudson. It was described by Hugh Thomson in the Daily Telegraph as a book that \\"will stand as the definitive single-volume work on the subject.\\" Another notable book was Naturalists in Paradise. Wallace, Bates and Spruce in the Amazon (2015). Personal life In 1979, John Hemming married Susan (Sukie) Babington Smith, daughter of Michael Babington Smith, CBE and granddaughter of Sir Henry Babington Smith. She worked for many years in The National Trust, became Director of Development and then Director of Corporate Affairs at The British Museum, and on retirement a trustee of English Heritage. She is the great-granddaughter of 9th Earl of Elgin on her father's side and great-great- granddaughter of the 4th Earl of Clanwilliam on her mother's side. They have two children: publisher Beatrice (born 1981) and writer Henry Hemming. Honours In the 1994 New Year Honours, Hemming was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) by the British government. In August 2018, he was awarded the President's Medal of the British Academy \\"for his work in the field of the colonial history and ethnography of Brazil and Peru, and the promotion of the protection of endangered societies\\".

He also worked as a journalist and a civil servant. He was often referred to as the Serbian and Balkan Gogol. Life Branislav Nu≈°iƒá was born Alkibijad Nu≈°a (, ) in Belgrade on . His father, George Nousias (Thessaloniki, 1822 ‚Äì Pristina, 1916), was a Serbianized Aromanian merchant whose family had its roots in the village of Magarevo in Ottoman Macedonia, and his mother, Ljubica (1839 ‚Äì Belgrade, 1904), was a Serb homemaker from Brƒçko, Bosnia, then under Austro- Hungarian rule. Young Alkibijad completed his primary education in Smederevo, a port town along the Danube, before returning to Belgrade to complete his secondary education. In 1882, at the age of 18, he legally changed his name to Branislav Nu≈°iƒá. He subsequently enrolled in the Belgrade Higher School (later the University of Belgrade), graduating with a law degree in 1885. That year, at the age of 21, he was conscripted into the Royal Serbian Army. Nu≈°iƒá's service coincided with the two-week-long Serbo-Bulgarian War of November 1885, which he witnessed first-hand as a Serbian corporal in western Bulgaria. Nu≈°iƒá was quick to criticize the conduct of the Serbian Supreme Command during the war, which ended in a Bulgarian victory. He outlined his objections in the book Pripovetke jednog kaplara iz srpsko‚Äìbugarskog rata 1885 (The Stories of a Corporal from the Serbo‚ÄìBulgarian War of 1885), which was published in 1886. He went on to spend one year's study at the University of Graz in Austria- Hungary. In 1887, Nu≈°iƒá published a poem titled Dva raba (\\"Two Servants\\"), which ridiculed the Serbian King Milan for attending the funeral of an unpopular general's mother rather than that of , an officer who died of wounds sustained while saving his regiment's flag. Nu≈°iƒá was subsequently arrested, convicted of l√®se-majest√© and sentenced to two year's imprisonment. He served his sentence at a prison in Po≈æarevac but was released after only one year due to good behaviour. Nu≈°iƒá (far left) visiting Bulgaria in 1935. In 1889, shortly after his release from prison, Nu≈°iƒá entered the civil service as an official in Serbia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Several years later, in 1893, he married Darinka ƒêorƒëeviƒá, the 17-year-old niece of the Serbian consul in Bitola, Dimitrije Bodi. The couple had three children, one of whom died in infancy. Between 1889 and 1900, Nu≈°iƒá worked as a clerk at the Serbian consulates to the Ottoman Empire in Bitola, Serres, Thessaloniki, Skopje, and Pristina. Despite his earlier anti-war rhetoric, Nu≈°iƒá became an enthusiastic supporter of using military means to force the Ottoman Empire out from the Balkans. In 1900, he received a post at the Ministry of Education. Shortly thereafter, he became the head dramaturgist of the National Theatre in Belgrade. In 1904, he was appointed head of the Serbian National Theatre in Novi Sad. In 1905, he left his new post and moved to Belgrade to work as a journalist. He also worked as an editor for various magazines and feuilletonist for Politika, writing under the pseudonym Ben Akiba. Following Austria-Hungary's annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in October 1908, Nu≈°iƒá led a series of anti-Habsburg demonstrations in Belgrade. He climbed a balcony at the National Theatre, railed against the \\"plunder\\" of Serbian lands by Austria-Hungary, and demanded immediate military action. He subsequently rode his horse into the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to the consternation of Prime Minister Nikola Pa≈°iƒá. The popularity of Nu≈°iƒá's works, as well as those of fellow dramatist Petar Koƒçiƒá, increased dramatically following the annexation. In 1912, Nu≈°iƒá returned to Bitola as a civil servant. Macedonia was captured and annexed by Serbia following the First Balkan War, and in February 1913, Nu≈°iƒá was appointed prefect of Bitola. He was quickly forced to resign after consistently failing to adhere to the demands of the Black Hand and the ultra- nationalist guerilla bands that formed the backbone of the Royal Serbian Army's occupation force. Despite this, he remained in Skopje, and helped establish the city's first theatre in 1913. The outbreak of World War I brought further personal tragedies Nu≈°iƒá's way; his son Strahinja was killed on the frontline while serving in the Serbian Army. Nu≈°iƒá lived in Skopje until November 1915, when Austria-Hungary, Germany and Bulgaria successfully invaded and occupied Serbia. He took part in the Serbian army's retreat through Albania between November 1915 and February 1916. He lived in Italy, Switzerland and France until the end of the war. Nu≈°iƒá returned to Serbia a broken man, devastated by the loss of his only son. He was appointed to be the first head of the Ministry of Education's art department, serving alongside the writers Borisav Stankoviƒá and Stanislav Vinaver. He also became the first post-war director of the theatre in Skopje. He remained at this post until 1923. Afterwards, he was appointed head of the Sarajevo National Theatre.Sarajevo National Theatre In Sarajevo, Nu≈°iƒá wrote Ramazanske noƒái (Nights of Ramadan) under the pseudonym Halil Deliba≈°iƒá. He returned to Belgrade in 1927. In Vienna, he acted in the film Paramount Review in 1930. Nu≈°iƒá became a member of the Serbian Royal Academy in 1933. Following The Bereaved Family's 1935 premiere in Sofia, he received a medal from the Bulgarian state. He was also awarded Order of Saint Sava, Order of the White Eagle and Order of Prince Danilo I. Nu≈°iƒá died in Belgrade on 19 January 1938. Social criticism Nu≈°iƒá Monument in Belgrade. Nu≈°iƒá is more celebrated as a playwright than as a novelist. His incidental novels and journalistic feuilletons are not always moralistic or polished, but they are lively and amusing sketches of life. He is more prolific in historical drama and comedy. Of his plays, the most popular are comedies The Cabinet Minister's Wife (–ì–æ—Å–ø–æ—í–∞ –º–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–∞—Ä–∫–∞), A Suspicious Person (–°—É–º—ö–∏–≤–æ –ª–∏—Ü–µ), A Member of the Parliament (–ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∏ –ø–æ—Å–ª–∞–Ω–∏–∫), Bereaved Family (–û–∂–∞–ª–æ—à—õ–µ–Ω–∞ –ø–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∏—Ü–∞), The Deceased (–ü–æ–∫–æ—ò–Ω–∏–∫), and Doctor (–î—Ä). Through his plays, Nu≈°iƒá presented Serbian society and the mentality of the middle class in small towns and counties. He brought to the stage not only the retailers, canton captains, semi-educated officers, and current and former ministers' wives, but also formerly distinguished and overly ambitious householders, their decadent sons, failed students, distinguished daughters of marriageable age, and greedy upstarts. All-in-all he depicted the Serbian middle class and its morality, which managed to survive despite all the political and social reforms, newly formed educational system and cultural institutions. He also paid special attention to the social conditions of their origins, as they started out with unrealizable desires and insatiable appetites, the distorted family and marital relationships, misunderstandings and intolerance between fathers and sons, unfaithful husbands and wives, officers‚Äô ignorance and corruption and unreal political ambitions.

Movements typical of athetosis are sometimes called athetoid movements. Lesions to the brain are most often the direct cause of the symptoms, particularly to the corpus striatum. This symptom does not occur alone and is often accompanied by the symptoms of cerebral palsy, as it is often a result of this physical disability. Treatments for athetosis are not very effective, and in most cases are simply aimed at managing the uncontrollable movement, rather than the cause itself. Signs and symptoms Athetosis can vary from mild to severe motor dysfunction; it is generally characterized by unbalanced, involuntary movements of muscle and a difficulty maintaining a symmetrical posture. The associated motor dysfunction can be restricted to a part of body or present throughout the body, depending on the individual and the severity of the symptom. One of the pronounced signs can be observed in the extremities in particular, as the writhing, convoluted movement of the digits. Athetosis can appear as early as 18 months from birth with first signs including difficulty feeding, hypotonia, spasm, and involuntary writhing movements of the hands, feet, and face, which progressively worsen through adolescence and at times of emotional distress. Athetosis is caused by lesions in several brain areas such as the hippocampus and the motor thalamus, as well as the corpus striatum; therefore children during the developmental age could possibly suffer from severe communication deficits such as speech impairment, hearing loss, and failed or delayed acquirement of sitting balance, although most of people with athetosis have normal or near-normal intelligence. Causes Athetosis is a symptom primarily caused by the marbling, or degeneration of the basal ganglia. This degeneration is most commonly caused by complications at birth or by Huntington's disease, in addition to rare cases in which the damage may also arise later in life due to stroke or trauma. The two complications of particular interest are intranatal asphyxia and neonatal jaundice. =Asphyxia= Asphyxia directly causes basal ganglia damage due to lack of oxygen and therefore, insufficient nutrient supply. The lesions caused by asphyxia are most prominent on the caudate nucleus and the putamen. However, a less-studied consequence of the resulting hypoxia is its effect on the concentrations of the neurotransmitter dopamine within the synapses of neurons in the basal ganglia. Hypoxia leads to an increase in the extracellular dopamine levels and therefore, an increase in the activity of the dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, this increase in extracellular concentration is not caused by an increase in the neurotransmitter synthesis, but instead on inhibiting its reuptake back into the neurons and glial cells. Therefore, there is an increased dopaminergic effect as dopamine remains in the synapse at higher concentrations leading to additional post-synaptic response. As a result, the uncontrollable writhing motions witnessed with athetosis deal with the over-activity of synapses within the basal ganglia. =Neonatal jaundice= Neonatal jaundice is the other chief complication that leads to the basal ganglia damage associated with this condition. Jaundice is caused by hyperbilirubinemia, or abnormally high levels of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is usually bound to albumin immediately and sent to the liver. However, in neonatal jaundice, the concentration of bilirubin overwhelms that of albumin and some of the bilirubin remains unconjugated and can enter the brain through the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Normally bilirubin would not be able to diffuse across the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, but in infants, the barrier is immature and has higher permeability. Bilirubin is toxic as it prevents the phosphorylation of many proteins, including synapsin I which binds vesicles in the presynaptic terminal. Therefore, it directly inhibits the exocytosis of neurotransmitters and severely hinders the synapses it affects. In autopsies of children who suffered from neonatal jaundice, chronic changes of neuronal loss, gliosis and demyelination were observed in the basal ganglia and more specifically within the globus pallidus. =Thalamic stroke= Another study was done where the onset of athetoid movement followed a thalamic stroke. The thalamus is part of a pathway that is involved with the cortical feedback loop in which signals from the cortex are relayed through the striatum, pallidus and thalamus before making it back to the cortex. The striatum receives excitatory inputs from the cortex and inhibits the pallidum. By doing so it frees the thalamus from pallidal inhibition allowing the thalamus to send excitatory outputs to the cortex. Therefore, the lesions to the thalamus or any other part of this feedback loop can result in movement disorders as they can alter the reactivity of one towards the other. Also, in a case of people with thalamic stroke, a majority suffered severe sensory deficits and ataxia. It is proposed that this loss of proprioception and the ensuing loss of synergic stabilization may also lead to abnormal movements, such as those dealt with in athetosis. =Fahr's syndrome= Treatments There are several different treatment approaches to dealing with athetosis. The most common methods are the use of drugs, surgical intervention, and retraining movements of the afflicted person. It is suggested that training a person to relearn movements can be helpful in select situations. Though, generally, this type of treatment will not work, in certain cases it can be found to be very helpful in treating the symptom of athetosis. Drugs can also be used in the treatment of athetosis, however their collective effectiveness is not very convincing. There is not a single drug that is a standard among treatment. Many different medicines can be used, including: *Artane *CogentinPolzin, Scott J., MS, and Teresa G. Odle. \\"Cerebral palsy.\\" Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine. Thomson Gale, 2006. NA. Health Reference Center Academic. Gale. *Curare, though not practical due to respiratory paralysis *Tetrabenazine *Haloperidol *Thiopropazate *Diazepam Most instances of drug use where the symptoms seem to be lessened tend to be in more mild cases of athetosis. Treatment by surgical intervention can obviously have the most immediate impact, again however, it is not a cure-all. In patients that have cerebral palsy as the cause of their athetosis, it has been demonstrated that a subthalamotomy tends to help relieve the extent of athetosis in approximately half of patients. Additionally, late 19th and early 20th century surgical accounts state that athetosis can be relieved by the removal of a part of the cerebral motor cortex or by cutting a part of the posterior spinal roots. Patients who undergo surgical treatment to relieve the athetosis often see significant improvement in the control of their limbs and digits. While surgery is often very beneficial in the short term and can produce near immediate results, in the long term it has been seen that its effects are not incredibly long lasting. Related disorders =Choreoathetosis= Chorea is another condition which results from damage to the basal ganglia. Similar to athetosis, it results from mutations affecting the pallidum inhibition of the thalamus as well as increased dopaminergic activity at the level of the striatum. Considering the etiology of both disorders are fairly similar, it comes as no surprise that chorea and athetosis can and usually do occur together in a condition called choreoathetosis. =Cerebral palsy= Athetosis is a commonly occurring symptom in the disease cerebral palsy. Of all people with the disease, between 16% and 25% of them actually exhibit the symptom of athetosis. A component of this is the finding that most often the symptoms that involve athetosis occur as a part of choreoathetosis as opposed to athetosis alone. It is also noteworthy that the presence of athetosis in cerebral palsy (as well as other conditions) causes a significant increase in a person‚Äôs basal resting metabolic rate. It has been observed that those who have cerebral palsy with athetosis require approximately 500 more Calories per day than their non-cerebral palsy non-athetoid counterpart. =Pseudoathetosis= Pseudoathetosis is a movement disorder, very similar to athetosis, in which the symptoms are not differentiable from those of actual athetosis, however the underlying cause is different. While actual athetosis is caused by damage to the brain, specifically in the basal ganglia, pseudoathetosis is caused by the loss of proprioception. The loss in proprioception is caused by damage to the area between the primary somatosensory cortex and the muscle spindles and joint receptors. Additionally, when observing an MRI, it can be seen that in the brain of a pseudoathetoid patient, lesions on the brain are not seen in the basal ganglia, the area that is oftentimes the cause of athetosis. Social implications Athetosis is characterized as a symptom that is present in many forms of central nervous system disorders that affect the body movement coordination, such as cerebral palsy. Children may struggle to engage in social communication, since the poor coordination of the tongue and mouth muscles can reduce their speech ability and hinder their social interaction to a greater degree. The caregivers of the affected children are encouraged to closely monitor their nutrition and growth and to provide them with hearing aids in order to relieve their symptoms as well as support their academic plans. A growing number of patients is shown to benefit from communication devices such as shorthand typing programs and computer speech devices, as well as simple picture boards. Patients living with the disorder into their adulthood often have trouble being involved in daily activities such as eating, walking, dressing, as well as performing everyday tasks. They are consistently faced with challenges that limit their ability to live on their own. They are more reluctant to be involved in social activities and romantic relationships and more likely to develop poor self-esteem and self-image related to their physical limitations as well as cognitive disabilities, though such habitual thinking is shown to decline when they feel they are accepted and supported by their peers. Patients are also inclined to associate themselves with people who tend not to be engaged in physical activities, according to the September 2008 issue of ‚ÄúJournal of Physical Activity and Health.‚Äù History The first noted case of athetosis was discovered by W. A. Hammond and described in his book Diseases of the Nervous System in 1871. Hammond was also the person who created the term \\"athetosis\\", Greek for \\"without position\\". In his initial description of athetosis, the extent of the uncontrolled movement was limited to the fingers and toes. In association with this, he noted that the patients' calves and forearms were oftentimes flexed and that movements were generally slow. Over the period of time leading into the late 20th century, the definition of athetosis was expanded to include movements of the neck, tongue, face, and even the trunk. Along with the expansion of the symptoms came the recognition that it was a part of many medical conditions, including cerebral palsy and stroke. Research directions As athetosis is relatively difficult to treat, efforts are being made to help those with the condition live and perform tasks more effectively and more efficiently. One such example of work that has been recently undertaken is a project to help those affected with athetosis to use a computer with more ease. Software for the control of the computer uses joysticks that perform linear filtering to aid in control. An additional possible treatment option for those afflicted with the symptom is neurostimulation. Studies have begun, and in cerebral palsy patients affected with dystonia-choreoathetosis, it has been demonstrated that neurostimulation has been an effective treatment in lessening symptoms in patients. There has not been a tremendous amount of experimentation, though, in this as a possible treatment option.

She helped orchestrate the successful assassination of Alexander II of Russia, for which she was executed by hanging.  Biography  Perovskaya was born in Saint Petersburg, into an aristocratic family who were the descendants by marriage of Elizabeth of Russia. Her father, Lev Nikolaievich Perovsky, was the military governor of Saint Petersburg. Her grandfather, Nikolai Perovsky, was a Taurida governor. She spent her early years in the Crimea, where her education was largely neglected, but where she began reading serious books on her own. After the family moved to Saint Petersburg, Perovskaya entered the Alarchinsky Courses, a girls‚Äô preparatory program. Here she became friends with several girls who were interested in the radical movement. She left home at the age of sixteen over her father's objections to her new friends. In 1871‚Äì1872, together with these friends, she joined the Circle of Tchaikovsky. In 1872‚Äì1873 and 1874‚Äì1877, she worked in the provinces of Samara, Tver, and Simbirsk. During this period, she received diplomas as a teacher and a medical assistant. A prominent fellow member of the Circle of Tchaikovsky, Peter Kropotkin, said the following of Perovskaya: In 1873, Perovskaya maintained several conspiracy apartments in Saint Petersburg for secret anti-tsarist propaganda meetings that had not been sanctioned by the authorities. In January 1874, she was arrested and placed in the Peter and Paul fortress in connection with the Trial of the 193. She was acquitted in 1877‚Äì1878. Perovskaya also took part in an unsuccessful attempt to free Ippolit Myshkin, a revolutionary and a member of Narodnaya Volya. In the summer of 1878, Perovskaya became a member of Zemlya i Volya, was soon arrested again, and banished to the Olonets Governorate. She managed to escape on her way to exile and went underground. As a member of Zemlya i Volya, Perovskaya went to Kharkov in order to organize the liberation of political prisoners from the central prison. In the fall of 1879, she became a member of the Executive Committee and later a member of the administrative committee of Zemlya i Volya. Perovskaya propagandized among students, soldiers, and workers, took part in organizing the Worker's Gazette, and maintained ties with political prisoners in Saint Petersburg. In November, 1879 she took part in an attempt to blow up the imperial train on its way from Saint Petersburg to Moscow. The attempt failed. On her return to Saint Petersburg she joined Narodnaya Volya. Sophia Perovskaya and her husband Andrei Zhelyabov at the Pervomartovtsy trial Perovskaya participated in preparing assassination attempts on Alexander II of Russia near Moscow (November, 1879), in Odessa (spring of 1880), and Saint Petersburg (the attempt that eventually killed him, 1 March 1881). She was the closest friend and later the wife of Andrei Zhelyabov, a member of the executive committee of Narodnaya Volya. Perovskaya was arrested on 10 March 1881. Just before her trial, she wrote in a letter to her mother: She was the first woman in Russia sentenced to death for terrorism. Four other Pervomartovtsy, including Zhelyabov, were hanged with her.  Legacy  Three decades after her death, Perovskaya would become the inspiration for the Japanese feminist Kanno Sugako, who was involved in a 1910 plan to assassinate the Emperor Meiji. Kanno was also executed by hanging. In 2018 the New York Times published a belated obituary for Perovskaya.

The path runs between the City of Cambridge and the town of King's Lynn in West Norfolk. It follows the course of the River Cam and River Great Ouse across the fenland landscape into the Wash. It provides a small part of European Long Distance Path E2 which goes from Nice to Galway. Description The Fenland landscape is a man made environment constructed over many centuries. This fertile land is dominated by agriculture and is dissected by dykes, draining ditches, rivers and embankments. The walk gives walkers the opportunity to see the Fenland's open landscape and skies that contribute to the character of the Fens. The walk has a number of points of historical and wildlife interest. The route passes close to five railway stations, offering opportunities for one-way walks of varying lengths. The route Starting from Cambridge the route follows the River Cam with its banks and pastures fringed with weeping willow trees and out into the fens. The Cam Washes have been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest because of their rare and special habitats and wildlife. Within this SSSI, Otters can sometimes be seen. Approximately north-east of Cambridge is Wicken Fen National Nature Reserve, where walkers will pass through the remains of a fragment of a Fenland wilderness of former times. Wicken Fen was the first Nature Reserve to be owned by the National Trust and has been in their care since 1899. Wicken Fen is a haven for birds, plants, insects and mammals. It can be explored by the traditional wide droves and lush green paths, including a boardwalk nature trail, giving access to several hides. A little north of here, the River Cam joins the River Great Ouse. Next walkers approach the city of Ely. Ely's magnificent cathedral and ancient city dominate the skyline for miles around. At the hamlet of Brandon Creek, the Great Ouse is joined by the River Little Ouse and the route enters the county of Norfolk. The Great Ouse is now contained by flood banks and from these banks there are views of the surrounding countryside. Denver Sluice, being at the confluence of five watercourses, was first built across the river in 1651 as a focus of the flood defence system that protects the low lying Fens although it had to be rebuilt after bursting in 1713. Nearby Denver Windmill is a fully restored 19th century windmill, and lies on the path of the Roman Fen Causeway. The Ouse Washes are an internationally significant environment. Flooded in winter, they attract thousands of migrating wildfowl. From Denver the river is tidal, bringing with it subtle changes in scenery and habitat. Close by is the Relief Channel, the final link in the drainage system, completed in 1964. The two waterways meet at King's Lynn, the historic port on the edge of the Wash where the footpath ends. The Way markings The route is marked with a small circular badge with a blue eel logo. alt=A blue eel symbol on yellow arrow on a white circle, and a blue eel symbol on red arrow on a white circle, both nailed to a wooden post, with a green leafy background.

Argyll was a Scottish motor car marque manufactured from 1899 to 1932, and again from 1976 to around 1990. The original Argyll marque Alex Govan founded The Hozier Engineering Company in 1899, and it was at this factory that the first Argyll Voiturette was produced; copied from the contemporary Renault, it featured a 2¬æ hp de Dion engine and shaft-drive. 1901 models had an upgraded engine of 5 hp; cars made in 1902 were upgraded even further, using 8 hp units. Soon there appeared a 10 hp twin with radiator tubes forming the sides of the hood; in 1904 the company introduced a range of front-radiatored Aster-engined cars. One of these was a 10 hp of 1985 cc; others were fours of 3054 cc, 3686 cc, and 4849 cc. All cars featured Govan's rather awkward gearbox, which had a T-shaped gate and separate reverse and change-speed levers. The company, by now named Argyll Motors Ltd. had now become Scotland's biggest marque and soon moved from its premises in Bridgeton, Glasgow to a grand, purpose-built factory in Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire. The Argyll Motor Works covered , had its own railway line, and was opened in 1906 by John Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu. However, the new factory was never used to capacity, and the company began to decline after Govan's death in 1907. It went into liquidation in 1908. Production restarted in 1910, under a company now named Argyll Ltd., with a new range of cars including the famed \\"Flying Fifteen\\", and a six- cylinder model. The 12/14 was widely sold as a taxi even being exported to New York. Four-wheel brakes designed by J.M. Rubury of Argyll and patented on 18 March 1910 by Henri Perrot and John Meredith Rubury (Patent number 6807) London Gazette 23 Dec 1924 were available from 1911 on, and in 1912 the single Sleeve valve engine designed by company director Baillie P. Burt and J. P. McCollum began production; the entire range featured Burt-McCollum engines by 1914. Argyll changed hands in 1914 and the Alexandria factory was sold to the Royal Navy for torpedo production. Car production was resumed on a small scale in the original Bridgeton works under the control of John Brimlow who had previously run the repair department. The first product from the new company was a revival of the pre-war 15¬∑9 hp model, now with electric starter but few were sold. In 1922 it was joined by a 1¬Ω-litre sleeve valve model and in 1926 by the 12/40 sports. The company made a final appearance at the London Motor Show in 1927 and the last cars were probably made in 1928 though still advertised until Argyll closed in 1932. The second Argyll era The Argyll turbo GT prototype The name was re-used in 1976 by a new company who made a mid-engined sports car, the Argyll GT in Lochgilphead, Scotland. The new manufacturing company was founded by Bob Henderson. The new car was named after the original Argyll of 1898, in honour of a grandfather of one of the investors who worked in the Argyll factory at Alexandria. The only model was the mid-engined Argyll GT (or \\"Turbo GT\\"), which was based on a sturdy box section chassis with space frame clothed in a fibreglass bodyshell made next door to the old Arrol-Johnston factory in Dumfries by Solway Marine. The 1976 prototype car featured a turbocharged Rover V8 engine. A version with a turbocharged Saab engine was also mooted, but none were built. The suspension came from the Triumph 2500 and the gearbox was a ZF 5-speed unit. By undoing ten bolts, the entire rear end, suspension, gearbox and engine came away. A production version of the car, which made its debut in 1983, had a non- turbocharged version of the Douvrin Euro V6 as used by Renault, Peugeot and others, together with a Renault 30 transaxle. Other manufacturer's components used were the hexagonal tail lights were from the Datsun Cherry, the dashboard from Volvo, the steering wheel from the Triumph Dolomite, and the door handles from the Morris Marina. A turbocharged V8 of 3.5 - 4.2 litres, together with the ZF transmission, was an option, but none were built. Other engine options were the Lancia Beta engine and transmission, and a Buick V6 which had started out as a stillborn Indycar engine. A top speed of 160 mph (ca. 260 km/h) with the turbo V8 was claimed but never ratified. The quoted price at launch was ¬£25-30,000, which was comparable to the contemporary Ferrari 308 GTB.

That is, a representation of a Hopf algebra H over a field K is a K-vector space V with an action H √ó V ‚Üí V usually denoted by juxtaposition ( that is, the image of (h,v) is written hv ). The vector space V is called an H-module. Properties The module structure of a representation of a Hopf algebra H is simply its structure as a module for the underlying associative algebra. The main use of considering the additional structure of a Hopf algebra is when considering all H-modules as a category. The additional structure is also used to define invariant elements of an H-module V. An element v in V is invariant under H if for all h in H, hv = Œµ(h)v, where Œµ is the counit of H. The subset of all invariant elements of V forms a submodule of V. Categories of representations as a motivation for Hopf algebras For an associative algebra H, the tensor product V1 ‚äó V2 of two H-modules V1 and V2 is a vector space, but not necessarily an H-module. For the tensor product to be a functorial product operation on H-modules, there must be a linear binary operation Œî : H ‚Üí H ‚äó H such that for any v in V1 ‚äó V2 and any h in H, :hv=\\\\Delta h(v_{(1)}\\\\otimes v_{(2)})=h_{(1)}v_{(1)}\\\\otimes h_{(2)}v_{(2)}, and for any v in V1 ‚äó V2 and a and b in H, :\\\\Delta(ab)(v_{(1)}\\\\otimes v_{(2)})=(ab)v=a[b[v =\\\\Delta a[\\\\Delta b(v_{(1)}\\\\otimes v_{(2)})]=(\\\\Delta a )(\\\\Delta b)(v_{(1)}\\\\otimes v_{(2)}). using sumless Sweedler's notation, which is somewhat like an index free form of Einstein's summation convention. This is satisfied if there is a Œî such that Œî(ab) = Œî(a)Œî(b) for all a, b in H. For the category of H-modules to be a strict monoidal category with respect to ‚äó, V_1\\\\otimes(V_2\\\\otimes V_3) and (V_1\\\\otimes V_2)\\\\otimes V_3 must be equivalent and there must be unit object ŒµH, called the trivial module, such that ŒµH ‚äó V, V and V ‚äó ŒµH are equivalent. This means that for any v in :V_1\\\\otimes(V_2\\\\otimes V_3)=(V_1\\\\otimes V_2)\\\\otimes V_3 and for h in H, :((\\\\operatorname{id}\\\\otimes \\\\Delta)\\\\Delta h)(v_{(1)}\\\\otimes v_{(2)}\\\\otimes v_{(3)})=h_{(1)}v_{(1)}\\\\otimes h_{(2)(1)}v_{(2)}\\\\otimes h_{(2)(2)}v_{(3)}=hv=((\\\\Delta\\\\otimes \\\\operatorname{id}) \\\\Delta h) (v_{(1)}\\\\otimes v_{(2)}\\\\otimes v_{(3)}). This will hold for any three H-modules if Œî satisfies :(\\\\operatorname{id}\\\\otimes \\\\Delta)\\\\Delta A=(\\\\Delta \\\\otimes \\\\operatorname{id})\\\\Delta A. The trivial module must be one-dimensional, and so an algebra homomorphism Œµ : H ‚Üí F may be defined such that hv = Œµ(h)v for all v in ŒµH. The trivial module may be identified with F, with 1 being the element such that 1 ‚äó v = v = v ‚äó 1 for all v. It follows that for any v in any H-module V, any c in ŒµH and any h in H, :(\\\\varepsilon(h_{(1)})h_{(2)})cv=h_{(1)}c\\\\otimes h_{(2)}v=h(c\\\\otimes v)=h(cv)=(h_{(1)}\\\\varepsilon(h_{(2)}))cv. The existence of an algebra homomorphism Œµ satisfying :\\\\varepsilon(h_{(1)})h_{(2)} = h = h_{(1)}\\\\varepsilon(h_{(2)}) is a sufficient condition for the existence of the trivial module. It follows that in order for the category of H-modules to be a monoidal category with respect to the tensor product, it is sufficient for H to have maps Œî and Œµ satisfying these conditions. This is the motivation for the definition of a bialgebra, where Œî is called the comultiplication and Œµ is called the counit. In order for each H-module V to have a dual representation V such that the underlying vector spaces are dual and the operation * is functorial over the monoidal category of H-modules, there must be a linear map S : H ‚Üí H such that for any h in H, x in V and y in V*, :\\\\langle y, S(h)x\\\\rangle = \\\\langle hy, x \\\\rangle. where \\\\langle\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot\\\\rangle is the usual pairing of dual vector spaces. If the map \\\\varphi:V\\\\otimes V^*\\\\rightarrow \\\\varepsilon_H induced by the pairing is to be an H-homomorphism, then for any h in H, x in V and y in V*, :\\\\varphi\\\\left(h(x\\\\otimes y)\\\\right)=\\\\varphi\\\\left(x\\\\otimes S(h_{(1)})h_{(2)}y\\\\right)=\\\\varphi\\\\left(S(h_{(2)})h_{(1)}x\\\\otimes y\\\\right)=h\\\\varphi(x\\\\otimes y)=\\\\varepsilon(h)\\\\varphi(x\\\\otimes y), which is satisfied if :S(h_{(1)})h_{(2)}=\\\\varepsilon(h)=h_{(1)}S(h_{(2)}) for all h in H. If there is such a map S, then it is called an antipode, and H is a Hopf algebra. The desire for a monoidal category of modules with functorial tensor products and dual representations is therefore one motivation for the concept of a Hopf algebra. Representations on an algebra A Hopf algebra also has representations which carry additional structure, namely they are algebras. Let H be a Hopf algebra. If A is an algebra with the product operation Œº : A ‚äó A ‚Üí A, and œÅ : H ‚äó A ‚Üí A is a representation of H on A, then œÅ is said to be a representation of H on an algebra if Œº is H-equivariant. As special cases, Lie algebras, Lie superalgebras and groups can also have representations on an algebra.

He was a member of the Polish People's Party from 1895, and the leader of its \\"Piast\\" faction from 1913. He was a member of parliament in the Galician Sejm from 1908‚Äì1914, and an envoy to Reichsrat in Vienna from 1911 to 1918. Witos was also a leader of Polish Liquidation Committee () in 1918, head of the Piast party, and member of parliament in the Polish Sejm from 1919-1920. He served three times as the premier of Poland, in 1920‚Äì1921, 1923 (Chjeno-Piast), and 1926. In 1926 the third Witos government was overthrown by the May coup d'√©tat led by J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski. Witos had been one of the leaders of the opposition to the Sanacja- government as head of Centrolew (1929‚Äì1930) and co-founded the People's Party. Having been imprisoned shortly thereafter and for a time living in exile in Czechoslovakia from 1933, he returned to Poland in 1939 only to be imprisoned again by the invading Germans. In ill health by 1945, he was nominated one of the vice-chairmen of the State National Council () after World War II. In 1945-46 the People's Party was reorganized and taken over by Stanis≈Çaw Miko≈Çajczyk. Early life Wincenty was born in a peasant family in Wierzchos≈Çawice in Lesser Poland/Galicia. His parents were Wojciech and Katarzyna n√©e Sroka. The family was poor, owning little land and no livestock and they lived in a single room hut which had been converted from a barn. Wincenty had two brothers, Jan and Andrzej. Andrzej would also become a leader in the Polish agrarian movement. He began his education in the village school at the age of ten and finished four grades. Subsequently, he worked, helping his father, as a lumberjack for Prince Eustachy Stanis≈Çaw Sanguszko. Between 1895 and 1897 Wincenty served in the Austrian Army (Galicia was part of the Austrian partition of Poland), first in infantry then in the artillery. He was stationed in Tarn√≥w, Krak√≥w and Krzes≈Çawice.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/12946146/wincenty-witos He married Katarzyna Trach on 9 February 1898. His daughter Julia was born on 22 March 1899.https://www.geni.com/people/Wincenty-Witos/6000000019131780464 Early political activity At the age of nineteen he published his first newspaper article in the Przyjaciel Ludu (\\"Friend of the People\\") based in Lw√≥w (Lviv, Lemberg), under the name \\"Maciej Rydz\\". In 1895 Witos joined the Galician Stronnictwo Ludowe (\\"People's Party\\") and in February 1903 he was elected to the Executive Committee of the party. In 1908 he was elected as a delegate to the Diet of Galicia in Lwow and served until 1914. In April 1909 Witos was elected the w√≥jt (mayor) of his native Wierzchos≈Çawice. During his tenure he focused on the economic development of the village, oversaw the construction of a mill and a social center, improved local roads, expanded the school and organized a farmer's cooperative and credit union. He gradually rose in the ranks of the agrarian movement.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/12946146/wincenty-witos Road to independence Wincenty Witos (right) and Ignacy Daszy≈Ñski. In December 1913 the People's Party split. As a result, in February 1914, Witos was elected as vice president of the newly-created political party Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe \\"Piast\\" (Polish People's Party \\"Piast\\"). In 1911 he served as a deputy of the party to Austria's Imperial Council's House of Representatives. Technically he remained the member of the Austrian government until 1918.https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/president-no-independence-without- peasant-leader-witos After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Witos became even more involved in party activities. The group joined the Supreme National Committee a quasi-government for the Poles in Galicia, for which Witos served as vice president. As the political events associated with the war unfolded and the Committee became more and more irrelevant, Witos resigned.https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/president-no-independence- without-peasant-leader-witos During the war Witos kept in touch with Polish independence movement activists, including Ignacy Paderewski and Jƒôdrzej Moraczewski. He also supported J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, whom he saw as the future leader of a reconstituted Polish army. \\"Piast\\"'s backing for Pi≈Çsudski increased after the Oath Crisis and the internment of Pi≈Çsudski by the Germans. Gradually, the agrarians of the Polish People's Party came to believe that the cause of Polish independence was best served by an alliance with the alliance and so began supporting the pro-Entente, anti-German, National Democrats. In 1917 Witos joined Roman Dmowski's National League although he left the organization in 1918.https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/president- no-independence-without-peasant-leader-witos In 1916 he became the president of \\"Piast\\". He coauthored a manifesto, which declared the aims of a reconstituted, independent Poland and was published in May 1917. On 28 September 1918, he was one of the two directors of the Polish Liquidation Committee, a temporary government whose purpose was to preserve law and order in the former Austrian partition during the transition to an elected Polish government. The Committee declared Western Galicia independent of the Austria- Hungary. Witos was invited to join the government of Ignacy Daszy≈Ñski but turned the offer down forpolitical differences. Witos was also unsatisfied with the fact that the new government had no representative from the Prussian Partition.https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/president-no-independence- without-peasant-leader-witos Prime Minister: 1920-1921, 1923, 1926 =Second Cabinet= On 17 May 1923, an agreement was held in Warsaw between the Polish centre (Polish People's Party \\"Piast\\") and right-wing parties (primarily ZwiƒÖzek Ludowo-Narodowy and Polskie Stronnictwo Chrze≈õcija≈Ñskiej Demokracji and several smaller parties, known as the Christian Union of National Unity alliance or Chjena) called the Lanckorona Pact (). The politicians of those parties agreed to pursue stricter polonization policies and to increase the role of Catholic Church in the state. Furthermore, the program of Polonization of the Eastern Borderlands was to be initiated. The pact was signed at Warsaw's apartment of Juliusz Zdanowski, one of the leaders of Zwiazek Ludowo-Narodowy. Its name refers to the fact, that it was negotiated in the real estate of Senator Ludwik Hammerling, who was elected in the district which included Lanckorona. The agreement led to the dismissal of the government of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski and creation of the Chjeno-Piast coalition on 28 May, with the new government of Witos. Former Polish chief of state, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, who resigned claiming that he would not participate in the government, which is made of parties responsible for the death of President Narutowicz. He resigned in December 1923. =Third Cabinet and Coup d'√©tat= In November 1925, the government of Prime Minister W≈Çadys≈Çaw Grabski was replaced by the government led by Minister of Foreign Affairs Aleksander Skrzy≈Ñski, which had received support from the National Democrats and the Polish Socialist Party. General Lucjan ≈ªeligowski became the new government's minister of military affairs. However, after the PPS withdrew its support, this government also fell and was replaced by that of Witos, formed by the Polish People's Party \\"Piast\\" and the Christian Union of National Unity (Chjeno-Piast). However, the new government had even less popular support than the previous ones, and pronouncements from J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, who viewed the constant power shifts in the Sejm as chaotic and damaging, set the stage for a coup d'√©tat. Apart from domestic turmoil, Polish politics had been shaken by a trade war with Germany, begun in June 1925, and by the signing of the Treaty of Locarno on 16 October. Under the terms of the treaty, the World War I western European Allied powers and the new states of Central and Eastern Europe sought to secure a postwar territorial settlement in return for normalized relations with defeated Germany. On 10 May 1926, a coalition government of Christian Democrats and Agrarians was formed, and that same day J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, in an interview with Kurier Poranny (the Morning Courier), said that he was \\"ready to fight the evil\\" of sejmocracy and promised a \\"sanation\\" (restoration to health) of political life. The newspaper edition was confiscated by the authorities. The night of 11 to 12 May, a state of alert was declared in the Warsaw military garrison, and some units marched to Rembert√≥w, where they pledged their support to Pi≈Çsudski. On 12 May, they marched on Warsaw and captured bridges over the Wis≈Ça River. Meanwhile, Witos' government declared a state of emergency. At about 17:00 hours, Marshal Pi≈Çsudski met President Stanis≈Çaw Wojciechowski on the Poniatowski Bridge. Major Marian Porwit who commanded one of the troops loyal to the government), reported to the president, then reported to Pi≈Çsudski and witnessed the discussion between the two dignitaries. Pi≈Çsudski demanded the resignation of Witos' cabinet, while the President demanded Pi≈Çsudski's capitulation. After the failure of negotiations and the president's departure, Major Porwit refused Pi≈Çsudski to let him cross the bridge. On 14 May, at about 13:00 hours, Witos' cabinet decided to move from the Belweder Palace to Wilan√≥w. Wojciechowski allowed this decision an hour later. After transferring to Wilan√≥w, Wojciechowski and Witos negotiated with the commanders of troops loyal to the cabinet. The military decided they should move to Pozna≈Ñ and maintain the armed struggle from beyond. Eventually, to prevent the Warsaw fighting from turning into a country-wide civil war, both Wojciechowski and Witos decided to resign and issued an order to their troops to cease fratricidal fighting. A new government was formed under Prime Minister Kazimierz Bartel, with Pi≈Çsudski as the new Minister of Military Affairs. On 31 May 1926, the National Assembly nominated Pi≈Çsudski to be president, but he declined. Eventually Ignacy Mo≈õcicki became the new president; Pi≈Çsudski, however, wielded much greater de facto power than his military ministry nominally gave him. Post-Premiership =Centrolew= On 26 May 1926, Witos resigned as President of the Polish People's Party \\"Piast\\" shortly after his removal from power, though it was not adopted. He resigned in 1927 as President of the Ma≈Çopolska Agricultural Society due to the limitation of state financial assistance. On 18 August 1927, the Krakow Provincial Office dissolved the Union of Commune Heads, which was created by Witos and operating in Lesser Poland under his own leadership. In the 1928 Polish legislative election, Witos successfully applied for parliamentary re-election as the member of the Sejm for the Tarn√≥w district, by obtaining the largest number of votes for this constituency. On 9 April 1929, the Voivode of Krak√≥w Voivodeship Miko≈Çaj Kwa≈õniewski, removed Witos from the Tarn√≥w local government board, to which he served as a member of this board since 1905. Witos remained in clear opposition during the Sanation regime. From 1929‚Äì1930, Witos was one of the leaders of Centrolew (), a coalition of several Polish political parties (Polish People's Party \\"Wyzwolenie\\", Polish People's Party \\"Piast\\", National Workers' Party, Polish Socialist Party and Christian- democratic parties). The coalition was directed against Pi≈Çsudski and the Sanation government. Witos participated, among others at the Congress of Defense of People's Rights and Freedom in Krakow (organized by Centrolew) in June 1930, during which he gave a speech. =Brest trials= The Polish Sanation government had invalidated the 1930 election results by disbanding the parliament in August and with increasing pressure on the opposition started a new campaign, the new elections being scheduled for November. Using anti-government demonstrations as a pretext, 20 members of the opposition, including most of the leaders of the Centrolew alliance (from Polish Socialist Party, Polish People's Party \\"Piast\\" and Polish People's Party \\"Wyzwolenie\\") were arrested in September without a warrant, only strictly on the order of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski and the then Minister of Internal Security, Felicjan S≈Çawoj Sk≈Çadkowski, accusing them of plotting an anti-government coup. The opposition members (who included Witos, and Wojciech Korfanty) were imprisoned in the Brest Fortress, where their trial took place (thus the popular name for the election: the 'Brest election'). The detainee (including Witos' inmates and opponents of the Sanation) were beaten and humiliated. Witos was ordered, among others manually cleaning latrines and emptying faeces buckets. A little later he was taken to the arrest in Gr√≥jec. On 27 November 1930 (the same day he was re-elected to the Sejm), Witos left prison, his bail was set at PLN 10,000. Regardless of Sanation's struggle against the well-known parties, Witos declared the need to consolidate with peasant groups. On 15 March 1931, he formed the \\"united\\" People's Party from the merger of three other, smaller, peasant-based parties: the Polish People's Party \\"Piast\\", Polish People's Party \\"Wyzwolenie\\" and left-wing Stronnictwo Ch≈Çopskie (SCh). On 26 October 1931, the Brest trial began in Warsaw. Witos and the other 10 accused were charged with the fact that in the period from 1928 to 9 September 1930, following the communicating between each other and acting consciously, they jointly prepared an assassination attempt whose purpose was to forcefully remove members of the Council of Ministers and replace them by other people, although without a fundamental change state system. None of the accused pleaded guilty after 55 hearings from the trial. Witos used the opportunity to explain the harsh criticisms of Sanation's actions, starting with the May Coup of 1926. Among others, Witos stated: > Your Honor, I was the president of this government that was overthrown by > the May coup. So I wasn't plotting, I wasn't plotting, but I, along with the > government, was the victim of a plot and assassination. This government was > not a usurper government, it was a constitutional government, in a lawful > manner, in a completely lawful manner appointed by the President of the > Republic of Poland. Someone else was swinging, someone else was plotting, > and I am sitting on the bench! During the trial, Witos's lawyer was attorney Stanis≈Çaw Szurlej. The accused were acquitted of the charge of preparing a coup d'√©tat, though they were convicted of their activities. Witos was sentenced to 1/5 years in prison and deprived of public rights for 3 years. Witos was imposed a fine of PLN 80, similar to the fine imposed on Kazimierz Bagi≈Ñski. The Brest trial ended in January 1932, with 10 accused receiving sentences up to three years of imprisonment; the appeals of 1933 confirmed the sentences. On 7-11 February 1933, an appeal hearing was held which culminated in the approval of the first-instance judgment. On 9 May, the Supreme Court cancelled this judgment and referred the case back to the court. On 11-20 July, a second hearing was held before the Court of Appeal which found the first judgment justified. The verdict was finally approved by the Supreme Court, which on 2-5 October, reconsidered the appeal of the defenders. Five of the convicts went to prison to serve their sentence. Witos, Adam Pragier, Wladyslaw Kiernik, Kazimierz Baginski and Herman Lieberman went into exile, before the approval of the judgment by the Supreme Court. They wrote in a joint statement: > We will not again be hostage to the dictatorship, as in 1930 ... The country > demands from us not martyrdom, but a struggle to remove the mafia, which > established its reign on lies, harm and depravity of characters. We left > Poland to continue fighting the hated dictatorship.

Built in 1946, she sailed from Craigendoran on the Firth of Clyde to Arrochar on Loch Long until 1973. Bought by the Paddle Steamer Preservation Society (PSPS), she has been restored to her 1947 appearance and now operates passenger excursions around the British coast. Since 2003, Waverley has been listed in the National Historic Fleet by National Historic Ships UK as \\"a vessel of pre-eminent national importance\\". In 2019, Waverley was withdrawn from service due to boiler problems. An appeal was subsequently launched with a target of ¬£2.3 million to recommission Waverley. It was announced on 11 July 2019 that new boilers had been ordered from Cochran Ltd. Following a successful boiler refit, Waverley returned to sea on 13 August 2020 for sea- trials, and resumed service for a short season starting on 22 August. This was cut short after she crashed into the pier at Brodick on 3 September, damaging her bow. History PS Waverley is named after Sir Walter Scott's first novel. She was built in 1946 to replace a PS Waverley that was built in 1899, served in the Second World War as a minesweeper and was sunk in 1940 while helping to evacuate troops from Dunkirk. Shipbuilders A. & J. Inglis of Glasgow launched the new 693 tonne steamer in October 1946. She entered service with the London and North Eastern Railway in June 1947, working the LNER's Firth of Clyde steamer route from Craigendoran Pier, near Helensburgh, up Loch Long to Arrochar. In her first year in service, she wore that company's red, white and black funnel colours. The Waverley with red lions and yellow funnels in 1970 The 1948 nationalisation of Britain's railways brought their Scottish steamers into the Caledonian Steam Packet Company (CSP), a subsidiary of the Railway Executive, and the funnels were repainted yellow with a black top. In 1965, a Scottish red lion rampant was fixed to each side of both funnels. Waverleys hull was painted monastral blue until 1970. After a revival of fortunes in the 1950s, the 1960s saw a gradual change in holiday habits that led to a decline in passenger numbers and the closure of many of the small piers. Since 1969, and the formation of the Scottish Transport Group, the CSP had been gradually merging with the West Highland shipping and ferry company David MacBrayne Ltd. In 1973, the company became Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd (CalMac). Restoration CalMac withdrew Waverley after the 1973 season as she was too costly to operate and needed significant expenditure. By then, the Paddle Steamer Preservation Society had been set up as a registered UK charity and had bought the near-derelict small River Dart paddler . CalMac, keen to ensure that the ship was preserved, sold Waverley to the PSPS for the token sum of one pound. Neither side really believed that the vessel would return to steam but, just in case, Caledonian MacBrayne stipulated that she should not sail in competition with their remaining cruise vessel, . A public appeal was launched to secure funding for the return of the Waverley to service and the fund-raising operation was successful. The PSPS found itself running a cruise ship operation, \\"Waverley Excursions\\". Since then, Waverley has been joined in the PSPS fleet by and and has had a series of extensive refits and much restoration work, including a new boiler and improvements to meet modern safety standards. She has circumnavigated Great Britain and every year makes extensive sailings around the country. Listed as part of the National Historic Fleet, between 2000 and 2003 the ship underwent a substantial rebuild and reboilering at the shipyard of George Prior at Great Yarmouth, funded principally by the Heritage Lottery Fund. The work, done in two stages, has added many 21st century safety and technological improvements and returned the ship to her original 1947 livery. In 2009, the ship was affiliated with , having hosted the official dignitary party at Defenders launch on the River Clyde. And in 2011 the ship was awarded the Institution of Mechanical Engineers 65th Engineering Heritage Award. Engines Passengers passing the engine room see the huge piston rods driving the cranks on the shaft that turns the paddle wheels on each side. The supports here painted black are now painted green. Waverley is powered by a three-crank diagonal triple-expansion marine steam engine built by Rankin & Blackmore, Engineers, Eagle Foundry, Greenock, Scotland. It is rated at 2,100 IHP and achieved a trial speed of at 57.8 rpm. Passengers can watch these engines from passageways on either side of the engine room. The main crank is solidly attached to both paddle wheels so they cannot turn independently. The Waverley therefore has a much larger turning circle than modern ferries. Appearance Waverley has had several colour schemes in her life. At launch her paddle boxes were painted black, in 1959 they were painted white, then back to black but with white edges in 1972, then finally back to all black in 1977. The two gold stripes along the hull were removed in 1954 but restored during the 2000 rebuild. Today, Waverley has the LNER 1947 livery of red, white and black funnels, traditional brown-grained (or \\"scumbled\\") superstructure and black paddle-wheel boxes, decorated with gold lettering on each side. When launched Waverley had square windows on her sponsons, instead of today's portholes. For most of her life, the upper passenger cabins were painted white and had wooden doors; all have had layout improvements at some time in the ship's life. Sailing in all weathers in salt water can cause pale brown rust streaks to appear by the end of each season, so cosmetic painting and improvements are done annually as the ship is drydocked and checked by the Department for Transport. Since 1962, when PS Waverleys original funnels were renewed, replacement items had been slightly out of parallel due to their heavier welded steel construction. The problem was resolved in the 2000‚Äì03 refit and her two funnels are now parallel. Lifeboat arrangements have varied depending on the legislation at the time. Between 1975 and 1980, there was only one traditional lifeboat on the rear deck, giving the ship an unbalanced appearance from the rear. Service Waverley makes passenger excursions from various British ports. She regularly sails from Glasgow and other towns on the Firth of Clyde, the Thames, the South Coast of England and the Bristol Channel. She also undertakes private charters and has provided a period setting for television documentaries and movies, such as Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011). Primarily during the summer she is based on the Clyde, operating excursions from Glasgow, Greenock, Largs or Ayr. Typically her Clyde timetable ends at the end of August and Waverley spends 6 weeks between September and October cruising the Bristol Channel, the Solent and the Thames before returning to the Clyde for two sailings in October. On 3 September 2020, she crashed into Brodick Pier on the Isle of Arran, causing damage to the bow. Twenty four people were injured. The ship was carrying 213 passengers and 26 crew, who were temporarily stranded on Arran. A Caledonian MacBrayne ferry, , made an unscheduled sailing to return them to the Scottish mainland later that evening.

He was also active as a teacher and music critic. Career Cary was born in Oxford, England, and educated at the Dragon School in Oxford and Westminster School in London. He was the third son and child of a pianist and the Ulster-born novelist Joyce Cary, author of Mister Johnson. While working as a radar engineer for the Royal Navy during World War II, he independently developed his own conception of electronic and tape music, and is regarded as among the earliest pioneers of these musical forms. Following World War II, he created one of the first electronic music studios, later travelling around Europe to meet the small numbers of other early pioneers of electronic music and composition. He studied arts at the University of Oxford and went on to study composition, conducting, piano, viola and horn at Trinity College London.Jo Litson, \\"Maestro with a motherboard\\", Weekend Australian, 11‚Äì12 November 2000, Review, p. 20 With Peter Zinovieff and David Cockerell, he founded Electronic Music Studios (London) Ltd, which created the first commercially available portable synthesiser, the EMS VCS 3, and was then involved in production of such distinctive EMS products as the EMS Synthi 100. In 1967 he created an electronic music studio at the Royal College of Music. This led to an invitation from the University of Melbourne in 1973 for a lecture tour, which in turn led to an invitation to become the Visiting Composer at the University of Adelaide in 1974. He remained there as a lecturer until 1986. He also wrote music criticism for The Australian. Musical works His concert works of note include a Sonata for guitar (1959), Continuum for tape (1969), a cantata Peccata Mundi (1972), Contours and Densities at First Hill for orchestra (1972), a Nonet (1979), String Quartet No. 2 (1985) and The Dancing Girls for orchestra (1991). Cary is also particularly well known for his film and television music. He wrote music for the science fiction television series Doctor Who (including the first Dalek storyChris Thomas, Music-maker for the Daleks, p.41, The West Australian, 12 May 2008.), as well as the score for the Ealing comedy The Ladykillers (1955). Later film scores included The Boy Who Stole a Million (1960); The Prince and The Pauper (1962); Sammy Going South (1963); Quatermass and the Pit (1967) and Blood from the Mummy's Tomb (1971), both for Hammer. He also composed the score for the ABC TV animated version of A Christmas Carol.Oliver (1975), p. 171 and the children's animated special Katya and the Nutcracker. Cary was one of the first British composers to work in musique concr√®te. In 1967 he created the first electronic music studio of the Royal College of Music. He built another at his home in Suffolk, which he transported to Australia when he emigrated there, and incorporated it into the University of Adelaide where he worked as a lecturer until 1986.Tristram Cary, The Daily Telegraph, 28 April 2008. He provided the visual design for the EMS VCS3 synthesizer. Death Cary died in Adelaide, South Australia, on 24 April 2008, aged 82. Honours Cary won the 1977 Albert H. Maggs Composition Award. He was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 1991 in recognition of service to music.CARY, Tristram Ogilvie, It's an Honour (Australian Government), 10 June 1991.

Between 1604 and 1914, over 5,200 individual enclosure acts were passed, affecting . History Before the enclosures in England, a portion of the land was categorized as \\"common\\" or \\"waste\\". \\"Common\\" land was under the control of the lord of the manor, but certain rights on the land such as pasture, pannage, or estovers were held variously by certain nearby properties, or (occasionally) in gross by all manorial tenants. \\"Waste\\" was land without value as a farm strip ‚Äì often very narrow areas (typically less than a yard wide) in awkward locations (such as cliff edges, or inconveniently shaped manorial borders), but also bare rock, and so forth. \\"Waste\\" was not officially used by anyone, and so was often farmed by landless peasants. The remaining land was organised into a large number of narrow strips, each tenant possessing a number of disparate strips throughout the manor, as would the manorial lord. Called the open-field system, it was administered by manorial courts, which exercised some collective control. What might now be termed a single field would have been divided under this system among the lord and his tenants; poorer peasants (serfs or copyholders, depending on the era) were allowed to live on the strips owned by the lord in return for cultivating his land. The system facilitated common grazing and crop rotation. Any individual might possess several strips of land within the manor, often at some distance from one another. Seeking better financial returns, landowners looked for more efficient farming techniques. Enclosure acts for small areas had been passed sporadically since the 12th century, but advances in agricultural knowledge and technology in the 18th century made them more commonplace. Because tenants, or even copyholders, had legally enforceable rights on the land, substantial compensation was provided to extinguish them; thus many tenants were active supporters of enclosure, though it enabled landlords to force reluctant tenants to comply with the process. With legal control of the land, landlords introduced innovations in methods of crop production, increasing profits and supporting the Agricultural Revolution; higher productivity also enabled landowners to justify higher rents for the people working the land. In 1801, the Inclosure (Consolidation) Act was passed to tidy up previous acts. In 1845, another General Inclosure Act instituted the appointment of Inclosure Commissioners, who could enclose land without submitting a request to Parliament. The powers granted in the Inclosure Act of 1773 of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Great Britain were often abused by landowners: the preliminary meetings where enclosure was discussed, intended to be held in public, often took place in the presence of only the local landowners, who regularly chose their own solicitors, surveyors and Commissioners to decide on each case. In 1786 there were still 250,000 independent landowners, but in the course of only thirty years their number was reduced to 32,000.https://libcom.org/files/Rocker%20-%20Anarcho- Syndicalism%20Theory%20and%20Practice.pdf, p. 36. The tenants displaced by the process often left the countryside to work in the towns. This contributed to the Industrial Revolution ‚Äì at the very moment new technological advances required large numbers of workers, a concentration of large numbers of people in need of work had emerged; the former country tenants and their descendants became workers in industrial factories within cities.

He led the Manitoba Liberal Party from 1931 to 1932, and brought the party into an alliance with John Bracken's Progressives. Mackay was born in Boularderie, Nova Scotia, the son of John Mackay and Anna MacAulay. He subsequently moved to Manitoba, and was elected to the provincial legislature in the general election of 1927. A Liberal, Mackay defeated Progressive incumbent Clifford Barclay by 18 votes in the riding of Springfield. The provincial Liberals fared poorly in this election, winning only seven seats in a 55-member legislature. Party leader Hugh Robson stepped down in 1930. After a brief period in which James Breakey led the parliamentary caucus, Mackay was chosen over Fred C. Hamilton as party leader in 1931. MacKay brought the Manitoba Liberals into an alliance with the governing Progressives in 1932. By this time, the Liberals and Progressives of Manitoba were already co-operating at the federal level; national Liberal leader William Lyon Mackenzie King wanted the same alliance at the provincial level to prevent a Conservative victory in the next election. The Liberals joined the government in early 1932, and two members of the party were brought into cabinet. Mackay himself was made a Minister without Portfolio on May 27, 1932. His term in office was brief. The united \\"Liberal-Progressives\\" easily defeated the Conservatives in the election, but Mackay was defeated by Barclay (now running as an \\"Independent Farmer-Labour\\" candidate) in Springfield. He resigned from cabinet, and left provincial politics. Mackay attempted a comeback in 1945, but lost to CCF candidate George Olive by over one thousand votes. As well as being a politician, MacKay was known by many as a prominent local physician in the town of Transcona, with a reputation for kindness and a great sense of humour. He graduated from Manitoba Medical School in 1916 and married Ruby Gowland the following year. They had four daughters who all graduated from the University of Manitoba. Throughout his career, MacKay was well known for his compassion - accepting food from patients that could not afford to pay upfront. He remains a community hero and his commitment to the Transcona area was honoured in his 2005 nomination as \\"The Greatest Transconian\\". MacKay had a great love of learning and, as such, Murdoch MacKay Collegiate, a high school in Winnipeg, was named in his honour in 1964, one year after his death.

King (a.k.a. Joe Queer) along with Scott Gildersleeve (a.k.a. Tulu), and Jack Hayes (a.k.a. Wimpy Rutherford). With the addition of Keith Hages in 1982 the band started playing their first live shows. The band originally broke up in late 1984, but reformed with Joe Queer and a new line-up in 1986. In 1990, the band signed with Shakin' Street Records and released their first album Grow Up. The album earned the band notability within New England, but with the release of their next album 1993's Love Songs for the Retarded, on Lookout! Records, their following grew larger. In 2006, after releasing six albums on Lookout! Records, the band rescinded their master rights from the label, citing breach of contract over unpaid royalties. Later that year they signed with Asian Man Records. The Queers' cover of \\"Wipe Out\\" was featured in the 2007 Columbia Pictures and ImageWorks Studios mockumentary film Surf's Up, produced by Sony Pictures Animation and National Geographic Films. History The Queers were formed in 1981 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The original lineup consisted of guitarist/vocalist Joe King, bassist Tulu, and drummer Wimpy Rutherford. King and Rutherford had played together in several short-lived punk bands, but King was inspired to start a new group after spending a summer in Manhattan Beach, California, and seeing Black Flag play. Tulu stated that their name had nothing to do with homosexuality, and meant queer as in someone strange or an outsider. The original lineup only played four shows before Rutherford switched from drums to lead vocals Tulu from bass to drums, while Keith Hages joined on bass. This lineup broke up in 1984 when Tulu went back to school, and while never releasing a proper album at the time, the 1996 compilation A Day Late and a Dollar Short compiled various singles and other recordings from this era. In 1986, King formed a new version of the band with DMZ guitarist J. J. Rassler, bassist Kevin Kecy, and drummer Hugh O'Neil. The band broke up again in 1989 after King bought a restaurant, but the next year were reformed by King and O'Neil, with new bassist B-Face. In 1990, this lineup released the band's debut album Grow Up on a small English label called Shakin' Street Records. When Grow Up caught the attention of Screeching Weasel frontman Ben Weasel, he convinced Lookout! Records owner Larry Livermore to sign The Queers, who released their second album, Love Songs for the Retarded, on Lookout! in 1993. To promote the album the band went on tours with Screeching Weasel and Rancid. By now the band had developed problems with drug and alcohol use. Larry Livermore, who was in the studio with the band for Love Songs for the Retarded, recalled that while Joe King was able to stop drinking, heroin remained an issue for both King and Hugh O'Neill. The other members staged an intervention for O'Neill, who was forced to take a leave of absence from the band to deal with his addiction. Jay Adelberg filled in on drums, performing on the live album Shout at the Queers; their 1994 cover version of the Ramones' 1977 album Rocket to Russia (released as part of Selfless Records' Ramones covers album series); and \\"Blabbermouth\\", their contribution to the 1994 Ben Weasel-curated compilation album Punk USA. Dan Vapid The recording for the band's next album, 1994's Beat Off, was scheduled to take place partway through a U.S. tour, but O'Neill was once again sidelined by addiction. The Queers instead recruited Screeching Weasel drummer Dan Panic, and also added his bandmate Dan Vapid as a second guitarist. Panic and Vapid would record Beat Off with The Queers, though Vapid's guitar parts were removed from the album before its release. They also played on the subsequent live album, Suck This (1995), and Vapid would play on 1995's Surf Goddess EP. For the 1995 studio album Move Back Home, O'Neil returned, and the classic lineup of King, B-Face, and O'Neil would record one more album together with 1996's Don't Back Down, which also saw the return of JJ Rassler on guitar. The album also marked the last release with Lookout! Records. The band had been offered a three album deal with Epitaph Records, which King was in favor of, but B-Face and O'Neil weren't. The rift over this caused King to replace them with bassist Dave Swain from Jon Cougar Concentration Camp, and Jon Cougar Concentration Camp and The Dwarves drummer Chris Fields. After leaving The Queers, B-Face would play bass for Chixdiggit!, The Mopes, and The Groovie Ghoulies, while O'Neil developed brain cancer, dying on January 21, 1999. Music The Queers play a Ramones-derived style of pop punk. Much like The Ramones, common lyrical themes are of girls, love, drugs, alcohol and having fun. Musically the band deviates slightly from the driving rhythm guitar sound of the Ramones and augments their songs with harmony vocals and guitar solos. They have been described by Livermore as \\"The Ramones meets The Beach Boys\\".Livermore, pp. 191‚Äì196. Ben Weasel of Screeching Weasel infrequently collaborates on songwriting with Joe Queer. The band is well known for the variety of cover versions they include on their records and during live performances. Bands/artists covered by The Queers include The Beach Boys, Ramones (including a complete re-recording of the Rocket to Russia album), Unnatural Axe, The Nobodys, Angry Samoans, The Mr. T Experience, Skeeter Davis, The Fantastic Baggys, The Who, The Undertones, The Hobos, Tommy James and The Shondells, Helen Love, The Catalogs (from Hawaii, featuring Les Hernandez of The Quintessentials), The Banana Splits and many more. Controversy Joe Queer has been publicly outspoken against Nazism and white supremacy over the years as expressed in various interviews and in the song \\"You're Tripping\\" off of the 1993 Lookout Records release Love Songs for the Retarded. The lyrics state \\"I hate white power... Can't you see, this ain't Nazi Germany\\". In a 2014 open letter, Joe Steinhardt of Don Giovanni Records called on Asian Man Records and Recess Records to drop The Queers after Joe Queer made public statements in support of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. Artist Mitch Clem, who had previously done work for the band, publicly broke ties as well. Steinhardt later apologized for the open letter, stating \\"I remain personally appalled by Joe Queer's defense of Darren Wilson, his use of the term Obongo regarding the president...at the same time, I recognize that a better way to go about this would be more thoughtful discussion directly with the people involved.\\" Joe Queer later called Steinhardt a 'gutless wimp' and challenged him to a face to face debate to be filmed and put online. Steinhardt has yet to respond. In an interview with Noisey, after their February 2016 show was cancelled due to a call for a petition to boycott the show from a local collective, Babely Shades, Joe Queer voiced his opinion when asked if he \\"supports racist, misogynistic or homophobic values?\\" he replied \\"Of course not. What normal minded person does? My closest pals here in Atlanta are Chris and Chester, two gay black guys. I was actually working a part time job. I was one of two white people on the whole job. If I was so racist, I wouldn't have worked there or be living in Atlanta! The whole city is predominantly black.\\" He also voiced his opinion of the activist group Black Lives Matter, stating \\"Black Lives Matter doesn't care about black people, they just want to cause trouble and hate white people. If they truly cared they'd be in the ghettos of America trying to help there instead of screaming about white America. That's where the murders of black people are happening, but according to BLM it's all white cops who are doing it! It's insane thinking and not getting to the root of the problem at all. All lives matter.\\" In a 2017 interview, Joe Queer stated \\"‚ÄúI get called a Nazi and racist because of our name, and then because I had an opinion about the Ferguson thing,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI'm liberal as hell, and I was taken aback by how quickly people attacked me. To this day, I'll get snide comments. I was jumped by Nazis as a gay person, even though I'm not gay. I fought Nazis, so to be called a Nazi is lame by this alt-left.\\" In the same interview he states that humor is a way to social change, we shouldn't take ourselves so seriously and that many people are looking for a reason to be offended, \\"‚ÄúIn the old days of punk rock, all these bands were laughing at themselves, and they got their point across through humor,‚Äù King says. ‚ÄúThe Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, the Circle Jerks, the Dickies, the Angry Samoans, Flipper, X ‚Äî they were funny, but they had a message. They were laughing at themselves. I don't think the new liberals are really offended. I think they're just looking for a reason to say they're offended. They completely take everything out of context. It's so insincere, this faux outrage.\\" Band members Since its formation, the band has gone through a few line-up changes, with Joe Queer as the only constant member. The band currently consists of Joe Queer (guitar/vocals), Cheeto Bandito (bass), and Hoglog Rehab (drums). The first line-up was Joe Queer, Tulu, Keith Hages and Wimpy Rutherford. The mid-1980s line-up was Joe Queer, JJ Rassler, Hugh O'Neill with Kevin Kecy or Evan Shore. The best known line-up is from the 1990s Lookout Records era: Joe Queer, B-Face and Hugh O'Neill. After leaving Lookout Records, B-Face and Hugh O'Neill left and Dangerous Dave joined. The Queers continue to actively tour and a new record is in the works. ;Current members *Joe King (a.k.a.

Superfrog on Team17's Softography (archived version) Later releases were handled by Ocean Software and GOG.com.  Gameplay  World 2: \\"Spooky Castle\\" The objective of the game is to find and defeat a witch, thus rescuing a princess, whilst achieving smaller objectives throughout the game, such as finding a golden key or escaping from captivity in a circus. There are 24 regular levels, divided into six differently-themed worlds. The goal of each level is to collect a set number of coins, and then reach the exit, which will only open if Superfrog has collected enough coins. Extra factors of gameplay include a timer countdown and a number of health points, both of which can be restored by finding bottles of Lucozade among the levels. Depending on the number of coins and fruit collected, and on how fast the player finishes the level, a number of credits (up to a maximum of 15) are awarded at the end of each level. The player can then choose to either collect the credits for a score or gamble them in a slot machine-style minigame for more bonuses. The most important function of the slot machine minigame is the chance to win a level code, enabling the player to restart the game from the beginning of the next level at a later time. An extra level between world 5 and 6 takes the form of a side-scrolling shoot 'em up called Project-F in homage to Team17's own Project-X (even going as far as using a remixed version of the original game's theme tune). Rather than collecting coins, the objective of this stage is to survive to the end. This level was omitted from the PC conversion of the game. After completing all six worlds, the game ends with a small boss fight against the witch in a castle setting. Plot The story, present in the game's manual but mostly conveyed through the introductory animation by Eric W. Schwartz, concerns an unnamed prince, who is turned into a frog by a jealous witch, in homage to the Frog Prince fairy tale. His princess girlfriend is then abducted by the same witch. Subsequently, sulking by the \\"River O' Despair\\", the prince chances upon a floating bottle of Lucozade, which confers upon him super powers. With his new powers, the prince heads off to fight the evil witch and save the princess. Development Superfrog was developed in 1993 and released for the Amiga in the same year by Team17, acting simultaneously as developer and publisher. The release was popular enough to spawn an Amiga CD32 version, which could also be played on some Amiga computers fitted with a CD drive. Due to its enduring popularity, it was then converted for the PC by Bubball Systems in 1994, running as an MS-DOS program. Eric W. Schwartz provided the animation for the introduction. The Amiga version was re-released by Islona Software in 1999, with slightly different box art. In 2012, Superfrog was, along with other games by Team17, released as a legitimate digital download from GoodOldGames.com, Superfrog on GOG.com this version being the first compatible with Windows. Reception Team17's earlier games became relatively obscure after the release of the hugely popular Worms series, though many gamers remember Superfrog fondly for its solid gameplay, smooth scrolling, cartoon- quality graphics, and upbeat music by composer Allister Brimble. Although a relatively small release by the standards of blockbuster platformers like Sonic, it was very well received and has retained a fan base which considers it an excellent example of the genre. Review on Lemon Amiga Rerelease On 13 February 2013, Team17 announced they would be reviving Superfrog for its 20th anniversary, and releasing a HD version of the game on PSN. Superfrog on PSN (article on Accelerated Ideas) This remastered version was co-developed by both Team17 and TickTockGames, formerly Bubball Systems, the company initially responsible for the MS-DOS port of Superfrog in 1994. Superfrog HD was released in 2013 for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, then later Microsoft Windows via Steam, OS X, Linux, Android, and iOS. In May 2016, Superfrog HD was discontinued by Team17; due to low sales and negative reception, the game was removed from PSN, Steam, App Store and Google Play. At the same time, the original Superfrog game was removed from GOG.com.

MCPI was active in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Punjab, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, etc. The principal class mass organizations of the party were: * All India Centre of Trade Unions (AICTU) * All India Kisaan Federation (AIKF) * All India Agricultural Workers Federation (AIAWF) * All India Federation of Democratic Youth (AIFDY) * All India Federation of Democratic Women (AIFDW) * All India Federation of Democratic Students (AIFDS) Ahead of the 2004 Lok Sabha elections MCPI participated in the front initiated by Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Red Flag and Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist). In 2005 MCPI merged with other splinter groups to form the Marxist Communist Party of India (United). :Lok Sabha election results: *2004: 4 candidates from Andhra Pradesh, *1999: 7 candidates from Andhra Pradesh, in total 120,220 votes *1998: 2 candidates from Andhra Pradesh, in total 24,417 votes *1996: 2 candidates from Andhra Pradesh, in total 33,900 votes *1991: 4 candidates from Andhra Pradesh, 1 from West Bengal, in total 43,085 votes *1989: 3 candidates from Andhra Pradesh, in total 100,300 votes ;State assembly elections: *Andhra Pradesh 1999: 74 candidates, in total 132,601 votes *Bihar 2000: 6 candidates, 8,861 votes *Rajasthan 2003: 1 candidate, 2,111 votes *Rajasthan 1998: 2 candidates, in total 542 votes *West Bengal 2001: 1 candidate, 2,014 votes References Category:Defunct communist parties in India Category:Communist Party of India (Marxist) breakaway groups Category:Political parties established in 1983 Category:1983 establishments in India Category:Political parties disestablished in 2005 Category:2005 disestablishments in India ","title":"Marxist Communist Party of India"},{"id":"857298","text":"The Heartbreak Kid is a 1972 dark romantic comedy directed by Elaine May, and written by Neil Simon, starring Charles Grodin, Jeannie Berlin, Eddie Albert, Audra Lindley, Doris Roberts and Cybill Shepherd. It is based on the short story \\"A Change of Plan\\", written by Bruce Jay Friedman. Jeannie Berlin was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, and Eddie Albert was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. It is #91 on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs, a list of the funniest American movies ever made. It was remade in 2007 starring Ben Stiller and Malin √Ökerman. Plot The story begins in New York City with the traditional Jewish wedding of emotionally shallow, self- absorbed, \\"nebbish\\"-man-boy Lenny Cantrow (Charles Grodin), a sporting goods salesman, to Lila (Jeannie Berlin, daughter of director Elaine May), an annoyingly unsophisticated and emotionally needy girl. While on their honeymoon in Miami Beach, Lenny meets and pursues the beautiful but manipulative Kelly Corcoran (Cybill Shepherd), a Midwestern college girl on holiday with her parents. When Lila is severely sunburned, Lenny quarantines her to their hotel room as he engages in a series of rendezvous with Kelly, lying to Lila about his whereabouts. Lenny impulsively ends their ephemeral marriage to pursue an indifferent Kelly, his ideal woman and ultimate fantasy shiksa-goddess. He believes she is the girl he has been waiting for all of his life and just \\"timed it wrong.\\" After leaving Lila (after only five days of marriage), he follows Kelly to Minnesota, where her justifiably resentful and protective father (Eddie Albert) is a relentless obstacle. Mr. Corcoran has undisguised contempt of Lenny, even offering Lenny a $25,000 bribe for him to leave following a dinner where Lenny inanely praises Midwestern produce as having \\"no deceit in the cauliflower.\\" Lenny eventually marries Kelly, whose chief intent appears to be to rile and defy her father. At the wedding reception, Lenny's attempt to mingle with the attendees via mindless conversation fails, and he is ignored by the guests, his bride and new in- laws. He is a stranger at his own feast, quoting the cliches of the Republican press to some unimpressed children and lapsing into the same useless hum with which Lila formerly drove him mad. He got the girl, but appears to have lost a feeling of belonging. Cast * Charles Grodin as Lenny Cantrow * Cybill Shepherd as Kelly Corcoran * Jeannie Berlin as Lila Kolodny * Audra Lindley as Mrs. Corcoran * Eddie Albert as Mr. Corcoran * Doris Roberts as Mrs. Cantrow * Martin Sherman as Mr. Johnson * William Prince as Colorado Man * Augusta Dabney as Colorado Woman Style The film is a black comedy, examining love and hypocrisy through a lens of pointed, subtle humor. Though it contains broad jokes, occasionally going for ‚Äúlaughs without shame,‚Äù Elaine May is credited with emotionally grounding the film and providing ‚Äúa real understanding of character‚Äù through eliciting the kind of ‚Äúcaustic, almost powerful humor that comes from moments of wincing recognition when human foibles are accurately captured and revealed.‚Äù As another reviewer wrote in Sight & Sound, May's strength lies in her ‚Äúobsessive and affectionate observations of character.‚Äù May shared with her late comedy partner Mike Nichols (1931‚Äì2014) a sparse, dialogue-oriented style and a quizzical perspective. She places an emphasis on character comedy; The Hollywood Reporter commented on her stylistic decisions to derive humor \\"from situations rather than obvious one-line jokes\\" and make comedic choices which \\"flow effortlessly from rhythmic dialogue, explosions of laughter.\\" The New Yorker's Pauline Kael wrote, \\"Elaine May has the rarest kind of comic gift: the ability to create a world seen comically.\\" May's focus on comedic honesty, backlit by pain and misfortune, stylistically influenced a new generation of films. She pushed comedy into a \\"golden age as the result of the rise of the semi-surreal comedy of mishap, pain, insult, and desperation.\\"  Themes  = Love and Jewish Identity = The Heartbreak Kid is a particularly Jewish story; as Thomas Meehan wrote in The Saturday Review, the movie is a \\"triumph of New York Jewish humor,\\" and The Village Voice called it \\"the culminating work of Hollywood's Jewish new wave.\\" All the filmmakers are Jewish‚ÄîFriedman, Simon, May, the producer Edgar J. Scherick, and the composers Burt Bacharach and Hal David. The story follows Lenny Cantrow, the embodiment of the Jewish archetype of the \\"schlemiel\\" (bungler), as he dumps Lila (Jeannie Berlin), a \\"kvetchy Jew\\" and \\"sloppy, incipient yenta,\\" for the girl of his dreams, an all- American WASP. The film is a deadpan fever dream of shiksa-chasing, taking place in what Bruce Jay Friedman dubs in the original short story as the land of ‚Äústrange blonde people.‚Äù The character of Lila in particular has been labelled extremely stereotypical; Film Quarterly likened her to a female Portnoy, publishing a review stating \\"Philip Roth's friendly anti-Semitism is strikingly similar to Friedman's.\\" Some critics have expressed concerns that the movie forwards a stilted vision of the modern female Jew and implicitly asks the question, \\"Why be married to a cloying, unsophisticated, slightly overweight Jewish girl who speaks with a discernible sing-song Jewish intonation (Yiddish influence) when you can perhaps conquer a very Waspy- looking, knockout blonde shiksa type?\\" This is despite the intentions of Jeannie Berlin, who told The New York Times that she did her best to honor the character and give Lila depth: \\"You see, I didn't want to make that girl stupid. It would have been so easy to do Lila stupid. I don't think Lila was stupid. I think every single thing she did was justified to her...And she really was terrifically in love.\\" For the role of Lila, Simon wanted Diane Keaton, but May thought the intended contrast between Jewish and gentile wouldn't be strong enough. Lenny's behavior as a classic nebbish Jew is thoughtless, as he leaves Lila high and dry on their honeymoon. Charles Grodin said afterwards that although he played the character with full sincerity, he had \\"pretty much indelibly stamped [himself] into the moviegoing public's consciousness as a jerk.\\" Still, he said, many viewers misread the film as an illustration of precisely Jewish annoyances and not as critique: \\"The number of men who tell me how much they loved the movie and how much they identified with the character, while flattering, is also somewhat frightening.\\" The final moments of the film depict Lenny failing to communicate with Kelly's gentile family. It highlights how he gave up his personal cultural traditions, and how he misses them. Having walked down the aisle to Kelly as a large crucifix hung overhead, Lenny sits on the couch by himself, swimming in a sea of Christianity, listless and alienated as ever. Reception The film has received almost universal praise from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a critic score of 92% based on reviews from 24 critics. Vincent Canby of The New York Times declared it to be \\"a first-class American comedy, as startling in its way as was The Graduate.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4 in a review that concludes, \\"It's a comedy, but there's more in it than that; it's a movie about the ways we pursue, possess, and consume each other as sad commodities.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune awarded the same 3.5/4 grade and wrote that \\"the heavy-handed comedy undermines the serious aspect of the movie‚Äîwe really can't believe that Lenny would marry her in the first place. The overall high quality of the acting, however, does sustain the film.\\" Whitney Williams in Variety called it a \\"bright, amusing saga\\" until the \\"audience is jolted by a sudden shut-off ending with no climax whatsoever.\\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that Grodin and Berlin \\"bring off hugely difficult comedy assignment with great style. Amidst increasing farcical events, they both somehow manage to preserve a sense of credible, foolish but sympathetic individuals lurking beneath the follies.\\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post thought that the film \\"has its faults, but it's also one of the most entertaining and original American film comedies of the last few years.\\" The Independent Film Journal called it an \\"unquestionably brilliant comedy.\\" Variety noted in their review that the sudden ending of the film might have been indicative of another ending that had been planned and later noted that Fox handed out a synopsis at later screenings mentioning an ending where \\"as they sail for Europe on their honeymoon, Lenny makes some startling discoveries about Kelly - and 'The Heartbreak Kid' comes to its bitingly funny end.\\" Awards and honors Academy Awards * 1972: nominated for Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress (Jeannie Berlin) and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (Eddie Albert) Golden Globe Awards * 1972: nominated for Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (Charles Grodin), Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress - Motion Picture (Jeannie Berlin), and Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay (Neil Simon) Other honors The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2000: AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs ‚Äì #91 See also * List of American films of 1972 References External links  Category:1972 films Category:1970s black comedy films Category:1970s romantic comedy-drama films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:ABC Motion Pictures films Category:American films Category:American black comedy films Category:American romantic comedy-drama films Category:American satirical films Category:English-language films Category:Films about Jews and Judaism Category:Films about marriage Category:Films based on short fiction Category:Films based on works by Bruce Jay Friedman Category:Films directed by Elaine May Category:Films set in Miami Category:Films set in Minnesota Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in Miami Category:Films shot in Minnesota Category:American interfaith romance films Category:Films with screenplays by Neil Simon Category:1972 comedy films Category:1972 drama films ","title":"The Heartbreak Kid (1972 film)"},{"id":"857300","text":"At the Battle of Mbwila (or Battle of Ambuila or Battle of Mbuila or Battle of Ulanga) on October 29, 1665, Portuguese forces defeated the forces of the Kingdom of Kongo and decapitated king Ant√≥nio I of Kongo, also called Nvita a Nkanga. Origins of the War Although Kongo and Portugal had been trading partners and participated in a cultural exchange during the sixteenth century, the establishment of the Portuguese colony of Angola in 1575 put pressure on that relationship. Kongo initially assisted Portugal in Angola, sending an army to rescue the Portuguese governor Paulo Dias de Novais when his war against the nearby African kingdom of Ndongo failed in 1579. But subsequently as Portugal became stronger it began to press harder, and in 1622 severed even the cautiously friendly relationship of the earlier period when a large Portuguese army invaded southern Kongo and defeated the local forces at the Battle of Mbumbi. Pedro II, king of Kongo at the time, responded by personally leading a force at the battle of Mbamba crushing the invasion. He then wrote to the Dutch Estates General, proposing an alliance with the Dutch to drive the Portuguese out of Angola altogether. This alliance did not finally come to fruition until 1641 when Dutch forces took Luanda and were joined by an army from Kongo, forcing the Portuguese to withdraw into the interior. However, they were not able to finish the Portuguese, and as a result the Portuguese eventually forced the Dutch out in 1648. In the years following the Dutch withdrawal, Angolan governors sought to obtain revenge against Kongo and to support the slave trade with a highly aggressive policy. Included in this policy were attacks on the zone of small, semi-independent states called Dembos that separated Angola from Kongo. Both Kongo and Angola claimed authority over the Dembos. King Ant√≥nio I, an aggressive monarch in his own right, was negotiating with Spain to renew an anti-Portuguese alliance, and also sent ambassadors into the Dembos areas to persuade them to join Kongo against the Portuguese, promising Spanish aid. In 1665, one of these small kingdoms, Mbwila, underwent a succession struggle and the various factions appealed to Kongo and Angola for aid. Both sides responded with armies. The battle The core of the Portuguese force, commanded by Lu√≠s Lopes de Sequeira, was 450 musketeers and two light artillery pieces. There were soldiers from the Portuguese colony of Brazil, including some of African and Native American origin, as well as Imbangala and other African forces numbering about 15,000. The Kongo army included a large number of peasant archers, probably about 15,000, some 5,000 heavy infantry equipped with shields and swords, and a musket regiment of 380 men, 29 of them Portuguese led by Pedro Dias de Cabral. Both armies were operating at some distance from their main bases. They had marched for days to reach the battlefield, along the valley of the Ulanga River just south of the capital of Mbwila. Steep hills and the river defined the east side of the battlefield, and lower ridges the west. The Portuguese forces took up positions between the two, with their African forces deployed on the flanks and the musketeers forming a diamond- shaped formation in the center, anchored by their artillery. The Imbangala forces were held in reserve. Ant√≥nio's army advanced into the Portuguese formation with a vanguard, followed by three divisions of his heavy infantry and the archers on the flanks. The Duke of Bengo commanded the reserve. In the initial stages of the battle, the Kongolese archers swept most of the African archers of the Portuguese forces from the field and then launched attacks against the Portuguese musketeers, supported by their own heavy infantry and musketeers. In spite of heavy fighting, the Kongolese were unable to break the Portuguese formation and Ant√≥nio was killed in the final attempt. Most of the Kongo forces broke following the king's death. The survivors were only able to withdraw thanks to skillful rearguard action by the Duke of Bengo and the reserves. More than 400 of Kongo's heavy infantry were killed in the encounter and many more of the archers. Along with these losses was the royal chaplain, the mixed-race Capuchin priest Francisco de S√£o Salvador (Manuel Robrerdo in secular life). King Ant√≥nio's young son of seven years was captured. After the battle, the head of the king or Manikongo was buried with ceremony by the Portuguese in the chapel of Our Lady of Nazareth situated on the Bay of Luanda, and the crown and sceptre of Kongo were sent to Lisbon as trophies. Aftermath Portugal obtained an act of vassalage from D. Isabel, the regent of Mbwila, but was unable to exercise any real authority over the region once their forces had withdrawn. In 1693 they had to return to attempt to subdue the region again. The primary result in Kongo was that the absence of an immediate heir spun the country into civil war. This civil war, which raged for half a century, led to Kongo's decentralization and fundamental changes, leading to Kongolese historians, even in 1700, regarding the battle as a decisive turning point in their country's history. After the battle many people, including nobles and members of the royal family, were captured. Some of these were enslaved and crossed the sea to the Portuguese colony of Brazil and maybe other places in the Americas. It is unknown what happened to most of them. But at some point in 1630, the sons of princess Aqualtune (who led a battalion during the battle), Ganga Zumba, his brother Ganga Zona, and their sister Sabina appeared enslaved in an engenho (sugar cane plantation) in the Captaincy of Pernambuco in Northeast Brazil. They led a rebellion at the engenho, escaped, and later formed their own kingdom of Quilombo dos Palmares, a Maroon nation which controlled large areas of northeast Brazil during the Dutch-Portuguese War. Sabina bore a son Zumbi who, after being captured, was raised in a church and then escaped. Zumbi succeeded his uncle and became the king of Palmares and leader of the rebellion until being killed in 1695 by the Bandeirantes, after which the kingdom was destroyed. His son Camuanga succeeded him in leadership of the rebellion, but after this it is unknown what happened to them or their lineage. Zumbi today is considered a national hero in Brazil.

Molesworth Station is located behind the Inland Kaikoura Mountain range in the South Island's Marlborough district. It is New Zealand's largest farm, at over 1,800 km¬≤, and supports the country's biggest herd of cattle. It also hosts government science programs, such as research into bovine tuberculosis and related research into possums. The station helps rabbit population reduction.Department of Conservation accessed 23 February 2019 The land is owned by the Crown and is leased for farming. On 1 July 2005, administration of the land was handed to the New Zealand Department of Conservation. The HVDC Inter-Island transmission line travels through the station. Location Molesworth Recreation Reserve ('Molesworth station') is located NW of Kaikoura. It is accessible from Hanmer Springs in the south, Seddon in the north eat, and St Arnaud in the north. The Acheron Road from Hanmer Springs to Seddon The primary route through Molesworth is the Acheron road, from Hanmer Springs to Seddon. This is the only route suitable for 2WD vehicles, but even so there are restrictions on type of vehicle and time of year. Caravans, trailers, buses, and vehicles over 7m length are not permitted. See the DOC site for details. The road is a single track for the most part, carrying two-way traffic, so care is required at corners. The road is unsealed, which tends to be dusty in summer, but is kept in sufficient condition for 2WD vehicles. There are numerous corrugations, but there are no fords on the Acheron Road, and the gradients are not steep. Users of rental vehicles are advised to check insurance implications. The unsealed road is approximately 200 km, with a maximum speed of 50 km/hr, though practical road speeds are lower. In practice allow at least 6hrs for this section, and be mindful of when the gates open and close. This is not a short cut, and travellers seeking a faster route would do better taking state highway 1 through Kaikoura. The only fuel on this route is at Hanmer Springs and Seddon. =Hanmer Springs to Acheron Accommodation House= Two different routes are available. Jacks Pass is much the better. Jollies Pass is rough, poorly maintained and requires 4WD. =Acheron Accommodation House= This is an historic house, and no accommodation is now provided. However simple camping facilities are available. The house itself is a cob construction, i.e. mud walls. Acheron cob house =Acheron valley= The road follows the Acheron river on its true right for much of the route through Molesworth. In places the river runs in a gorge, and there are a number of historic bridges. The scenery is open grassland for the most part. Acheron river Student Bridge at Molesworth NZ =Isolated Flat = Travelling north, the road departs from the Acheron river to briefly follow the Severn river, then over the Isolated Saddle about 100m above the plain. It then descends again to the Isolated Flat, and again follows the Acheron river. Molesworth Severn river =Wards Pass= Leaving the Acheron river, the road goes over Wards Pass, a climb of about 160m. This brings the route into the upper reaches of the Awatere valley. =Molesworth Homestead= The historic homestead and the modern farm yards are located to the north of the Reserve. There is also a simple camp site here. Molesworth east =Awatere Valley= Leaving Molesworth station, the road continues through farmland in the Awatere valley. In the higher reaches the valley is narrow and the farming primarily stock (sheep and beef), but in the lower reaches towards Seddon it broadens and more cultivation becomes apparent (incl. vineyards).

Cyclo-cross bicycles roughly resemble the racing bicycles used in road racing. The major differences between the two are the frame geometry, and the wider clearances that cyclo-cross bikes have for their larger tires and mud and other debris that they accumulate. Frame design Frame materials are selected with an aim to produce a lightweight, yet stiff and responsive frame. Low weight is prized for ease of carrying while running. A cyclo-cross racer may lift or carry his/her bike as many as 30 times in one 60 minute race, increasing the desire for a lightweight bicycle. Aluminum frames were popular in cyclo-cross bicycles long before they became commonplace on the road. Today the most popular material is aluminium with carbon fiber being popular at a professional level. Cyclo-cross frames require clearance for slightly wider (generally 30‚Äì34 mm) tires and the debris and mud that is picked up by them. They are typically very simple, often eschewing bridges between the rear stays. Compact geometry frames with sloping top tubes are less common than on road bicycles due to the need to carry the bicycle easily on the shoulder. Top tube (rather than bottom bracket) routed derailleur cables help combat the build-up of mud. Some specialist cyclo-cross bikes also have a higher bottom bracket to aid clearance over rough ground; extra clearance could prevent toe clips from dragging while re-mounting after an obstacle. This is less common as clipless pedals have become the norm for cyclo-cross. Typically, the frame geometry is a bit more relaxed than that of a road bike, not as upright in the seat tube, which allows for more stability in soft ground. Also, the wheelbase can be a bit longer, which provides a more planted feeling when using aft body weighting over rough terrain, and can help keep the rider's feet from contacting the front wheel during a tight turn. Components Choices of equipment tend more towards the idiosyncratic than in road racing; for example single-speed bicycles also have some popularity due to the advantage of mechanical simplicity in the often very muddy conditions and the fringe nature of the sport. Gearing is typically lower, with most common setups using a 46-36 (110mm BCD) or 48-38 (130mm BCD) chainring combination with a 12-25 to 12-30 cassette. Some riders opt to use a single chainring in the front (typically a 40-42 tooth chainring) while retaining multiple sprockets in the rear cassette. This has some of the advantages of the single-speed: the weight of the front derailleur and the front shift lever are lost, a single chainring allows for a tighter chainline, thus reducing the chance of throwing a chain on a bumpy course, and further, racing is psychologically simpler. Wheels are of the normal road racing type fitted with knobby tires (a variety of tread designs in both tubular and clincher types are available), although deeper rim profiles may be preferred for their advantages in thick mud. There are slight geometry differences between road and cyclocross bicycles; cyclo-cross bikes tend to have slightly higher handlebars for a more upright position as aerodynamics have little importance in a cross race. A second set of brake levers on the tops, called \\"top mount\\" or \\"interrupter\\" brake levers, are favored by some competitors. These are also commonly called \\"cross levers\\" due to their popularity in the sport. The top tubes of cyclocross bike frames typically have an ovalized or flattened bottom profile to provide greater comfort when riders need to shoulder and carry their bikes. In general, with a change of tires and gearing a cyclo-cross bike can double as a perfectly adequate road racing machine. However, most cyclo-cross racers prefer clipless mountain bike pedals for their easy dual-sided entry and mud-shedding abilities. Additionally, mountain biking shoes provide better traction while running than typical road style shoes thanks to flexibility in the sole and pronounced tread patterns. Surly Crosscheck cyclo-cross bicycle with Campagnolo groupset and a single chainring Cyclocross Cantilever brake bosses are more often equipped with traditional center-pull cantilever brakes than the more contemporary and powerful linear-pull brakes (\\"V-brakes\\") due to two reasons: native compatibility (insufficient brake cable pull) with the majority of drop-bar brake levers; and the cantilever brake's greater brake pad-to-rim clearance, which minimizes drag in muddy conditions. \\"Mini-V's\\" are gaining in popularity as they have both the native cable pull, and some of the increased power of traditional linear-pull brakes over cantilever brakes. Since the lifting of the UCI ban on disc brake use in cyclocross racing, bike component and frame manufacturers have immediately started developing and testing race-level cyclocross bikes equipped with disc brakes. While disc brakes are heavier than cantilever brakes, the trade off is that they allow for later and significantly more powerful braking in racing conditions. Tires Tire choice is very important in cyclo-cross racing. Off-road Tubular tires are still very popular; even more so than in road racing. This is, in part, due to their ability to be used at low pressure (22-40psi/1.5-2.75bar) without increasing the risk of pinch flats.velonews.com Pacocha, Mat: \\"Keeping the rubber side down: Clinchers or tubulars for \`cross?\\". VeloNews, November 13, 2003. Retrieved June 9, 2007. Low pressure is desirable because it increases contact patch area which can increase traction on soft surfaces. This increases the risk of the rim bottoming out on the ground, however, and this is a problem with clincher tires because the tube can be pinched by the rim, causing a flat. With tubular tires, this is not a problem, as they cannot pinch flat. The only concern is damage to the rim. Tubular tires also offer a weight saving and the ability to be ridden on even when flat so that a racer can reach the pits for a replacement. Clinchers do have their advantages. Changing tires is much quicker since it does not involve a lengthy glueing and curing process so a rider can have a large selection of tires at their disposal. Until recently, clinchers also generally had more cutting edge tread patterns than the more traditional tubulars. Some enthusiasts even went as far as to send Michelin Mud tires (a popular clincher tire) to Dugast (a manufacturer of high end tubular tires) to have a modern tread pattern incorporated into a traditional tubular. However, since 2005 several tubular manufacturers have designed more modern style tread patterns, namely Dugast with its Rhino, Tufo with its Flexus and Challenge with its Grifo and Fango. Lastly, clincher tires generally cost less than tubulars. Because cyclo-cross season spans autumn/fall and winter, course conditions can vary quite drastically. Often racers have at least dry and wet weather tires to choose between. Dry tires tend to have much smaller, closely spaced tread such as the diamond pattern for low rolling resistance. Wet weather tires have larger and more widely spaced knobs to aid in grip and mud shedding. Tires do not usually vary in width a great deal due to the theory that a narrow tire has the least rolling resistance (for dry courses) and that it will also cut through mud to the harder ground underneath (for wet/muddy courses). Although widths below 30c were popular in the past, current tires tend to be available from 30-35c with 32 and 34 being the most common. Equipment choice Because ground conditions can vary greatly, equipment choice is extremely important. Add to this the fact that the races are relatively short and that equipment changes are allowed during races and equipment selection can get fanatical. Since tubular tires are popular in professional and some amateur racing and tires cannot easily be removed from the rim, collections of wheels with tires installed, are required for the varying conditions. It is common for racers even at an amateur level to have a pair of race bikes (one to ride and one in the pits as a back-up) and several wheels to choose from. At the professional level it is essential to have several bikes and wheel options available. More recently, tubeless clincher tires have become popular after their successful presence on mountain bikes for the last several years. Advantages include lower overall wheel weight (no inner tube), lower tire pressures allowing for more traction without risk of a 'pinch flat' and no glue as required for tubular tires. Not all clincher rim designs allow for tubeless tires as an air tight contact surface is required to prevent the unintended loss of tire pressure. Rules The following are rules that have been put in place by the UCI that are either specific to or have particular effect on cyclo-cross bicycles. Bear in mind that these rules are not exhaustive, are only for UCI- sanctioned events and may not be enforced at all cyclo-cross events.\\"Cycling Regulations : Part I, General Organisation Of Cycling As A Sport\\". Union Cycliste Internationale. Retrieved February 11, 2008 *Handlebars must not measure more than in width. *Tire width may not exceed and tires may not feature any kind of studs or spikes. *Wheels shall have at least 12 spokes. *The weight of the bicycle cannot be less than 6.8 kilograms (15 lb to 2sf). As of 2010, disc brakes have recently been allowed for UCI races. Non-racing use In recent years, some cyclocross bicycles available in the consumer market are supplied with disc brakes as a stock item. Some models include braze-ons to enable the use of cantilever style brakes instead. The growing popularity of disc brakes on cyclocross bicycles has allowed for improved and lighter rim designs due to a lack of brake track on the side of the rim. Cyclocross bikes are growing in popularity among consumers for their versatility: they have some of the geometry and aerodynamic benefits of road bikes, but take wider tires, sometimes have braze-ons for fenders and racks, and are rugged enough for touring and some off-road use. Mountain bikes in Cyclocross Racing In some countries (including the United States, so long as it is not a UCI event) riders are also permitted to race in cyclo-cross events using mountain bikes (generally without bar ends), at least in low-level competition, but this is not currently allowed in events on the international calendar. It has been known for local races to be won on mountain bikes, particularly if the course is technical with little road or fast sections. However, for a traditional cyclo-cross course, a cyclo-cross bicycle is the most effective.

In wartime, governments encouraged people to plant victory gardens not only to supplement their rations but also to boost morale. They were used along with Rationing Stamps and Cards to reduce pressure on the public food supply. Besides indirectly aiding the war effort, these gardens were also considered a civil \\"morale booster\\" in that gardeners could feel empowered by their contribution of labor and rewarded by the produce grown. This made victory gardens a part of daily life on the home front. Two American war gardeners in 1918 World War I =Canada= Victory Gardens became popular in Canada in 1917.

In the city of Toronto, women's organizations brought expert gardeners into the schools to get school children and their families interested in gardening. In addition to gardening, homeowners were encouraged to keep hens in their yards for the purpose of collecting eggs. The result was a large production of potatoes, beets, cabbage, and other useful vegetables. =United States= Columbia sowing seeds. George Washington Carver wrote an agricultural tract and promoted the idea of what he called a \\"Victory Garden\\". In March 1917, Charles Lathrop Pack organized the US National War Garden Commission and launched the war garden campaign. Food production had fallen dramatically during World War I, especially in Europe, where agricultural labor had been recruited into military service and remaining farms devastated by the conflict. Pack and others conceived the idea that the supply of food could be greatly increased without the use of land and manpower already engaged in agriculture, and without the significant use of transportation facilities needed for the war effort. The campaign promoted the cultivation of available private and public lands, resulting in over five million gardens in the USPack, Charles Lathrop. War Gardens Victorious (Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott, 1919) p. 15. and foodstuff production exceeding $1.2 billion by the end of the war.Eyle, Alexandra. Charles Lathrop Pack: Timberman, Forest Conservationist, and Pioneer in Forest Education (Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1994) p. 142. President Woodrow Wilson said that \\"Food will win the war.\\" To support the home garden effort, a United States School Garden Army was launched through the Bureau of Education, and funded by the War Department at Wilson's direction.Hayden-Smith, Rose: Sowing the Seeds of Victory (Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2015). World War II Peter Fraser A victory garden in a bomb crater in London during WWII. =Australia= Australia launched a Dig for Victory campaign in 1942 as rationing and a shortage of agricultural workers began to affect food supplies. The situation began to ease in 1943; however, home gardens continued throughout the war. =Britain= In Britain, \\"digging for victory\\" used much land such as waste ground, railway edges, ornamental gardens and lawns, while sports fields and golf courses were requisitioned for farming or vegetable growing. Sometimes a sports field was left as it was but used for sheep-grazing instead of being mown (for example see ). By 1943, the number of allotments had roughly doubled to 1,400,000, including rural, urban and suburban plots. C. H. Middleton's radio programme In Your Garden reached millions of listeners keen for advice on growing potatoes, leeks and the like, and helped ensure a communal sense of contributing to the war effort (as well as a practical response to food rationing).A. Harris, Romantic Moderns (London 2010) p. 240-1 County Herb Committees were established to collect medicinal herbs when German blockades created shortages, for instance in Digitalis purpurea (Foxglove) which was used to regulate heartbeat. Victory gardens were planted in backyards and on apartment-building rooftops, with the occasional vacant lot \\"commandeered for the war effort!\\" and put to use as a cornfield or a squash patch. During World War II, sections of lawn were publicly plowed for plots in Hyde Park, London to promote the movement, while allotments growing onions in the shadow of the Albert Memorial also pointed to everybody, high and low, chipping in to the national struggle.A. Harris, Romantic Moderns (London 2010) p. 241 Both Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle had vegetable gardens planted at the instigation of King George VI to assist with food production. =United States= Amid regular rationing of food in Britain, the United States Department of Agriculture encouraged the planting of victory gardens during the course of World War II. Around one third of the vegetables produced by the United States came from victory gardens. It was emphasized to American homefront urbanites and suburbanites that the produce from their gardens would help to lower the price of vegetables needed by the US War Department to feed the troops, thus saving money that could be spent elsewhere on the military: \\"Our food is fighting\\", one US poster read. By May 1943, there were 18 million victory gardens in the United States - 12 million in cities and 6 million on farms. Eleanor Roosevelt planted a Victory Garden on the White House lawn in 1943. The Roosevelts were not the first presidency to institute a garden in the White House. Woodrow Wilson grazed sheep on the south lawn during World War I to avoid mowing the lawn. Eleanor Roosevelt's garden instead served as a political message of the patriotic duty to garden, even though Eleanor did not tend to her own garden. While Victory Gardens were portrayed as a patriotic duty, 54% of Americans polled said they grew gardens for economic reasons while only 20% mentioned patriotism. Although at first the Department of Agriculture objected to Eleanor Roosevelt's institution of a victory garden on the White House grounds, fearing that such a movement would hurt the food industry, basic information about gardening appeared in public services booklets distributed by the Department of Agriculture, as well as by agribusiness corporations such as International Harvester and Beech-Nut. Fruit and vegetables harvested in these home and community plots was estimated to be in 1944, an amount equal to all commercial production of fresh vegetables.http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/80400530/pdf/hist/bhnhe_1944_misc_pub_550.pdf The Victory Garden movement also attempted to unite the Home-front. Local communities would have festivals and competitions to showcase the produce each person grew in their own gardens. While the garden movement united some local communities, the garden movement separated minorities like African Americans. At harvest shows, separate prizes were awarded to \\"colored people\\", in similar categories, a long-held tradition in Delaware and the deeper South, as well as in Baltimore. In New York City, the lawns around vacant \\"Riverside\\" were devoted to victory gardens, as were portions of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. The slogan \\"grow your own, can your own\\", was a slogan that started at the time of the war and referred to families growing and canning their own food in victory gardens. Postwar In 1946, with the war over, many British residents did not plant victory gardens, in expectation of greater availability of food. However, shortages remained in the United Kingdom, and rationing remained in place for at least some food items until 1954. Land at the centre of the Sutton Garden Suburb in Sutton, London was first put to use as a victory garden during World War II; before then it had been used as a recreation ground with tennis courts. The land continued to be used as allotments by local residents for more than 50 years until they were evicted by the then landowner in 1997. The land has since fallen into disuse.Sutton Garden Suburb Conservation Area Character Appraisal The Fenway Victory Gardens in the Back Bay Fens of Boston, Massachusetts and the Dowling Community Garden in Minneapolis, Minnesota remain active as the last surviving public examples from World War II. Most plots in the Fenway Victory Gardens now feature flowers instead of vegetables while the Dowling Community Garden retains its focus on vegetables. Since the turn of the 21st century, interest in victory gardens has grown. A campaign promoting such gardens has sprung up in the form of new victory gardens in public spaces, victory garden websites and blogs, as well as petitions to renew a national campaign for the victory garden and to encourage the re-establishment of a victory garden on the White House lawn. In March 2009, First Lady Michelle Obama planted an \\"Kitchen Garden\\" on the White House lawn, the first since Eleanor Roosevelt's, to raise awareness about healthy food.  Films  Several countries produced numerous information films about growing victory gardens. =Canada= * World War II ** He Plants for Victory (1943) =United Kingdom= * World War I ** Grow Vegetables For War Effort ** War Garden Parade * World War II ** Dig For Victory!

The WGBH public- television series The Victory Garden took the familiar expression to promote composting and intensive cropping for homeowners who wanted to raise some vegetables (and some flowers). The 1975 sitcom The Good Life portrays the efforts of Tom and Barbara Good to become self-sufficient in their suburban home, including turning over most of their garden to vegetable production and a chicken coop. Tom explains to his baffled neighbours that \\"We're digging for victory!\\" despite their protests that \\"That was during the War...\\" Much of the early episodes follow the Goods' struggle to adapt to living from their victory garden.

In many European countries, bicycle racing is a source of national pride: German Democratic Republic postage stamp depicting Gustav-Adolf Schur, 1960 The final stage in Australia's Tour of Gippsland climbing up \\"The Gap\\" to Omeo Cycle sport is competitive physical activity using bicycles. There are several categories of bicycle racing including road bicycle racing, time trialling, cyclo-cross, mountain bike racing, track cycling, BMX, and cycle speedway. Non-racing cycling sports include artistic cycling, cycle polo, freestyle BMX and mountain bike trials. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) is the world governing body for cycling and international competitive cycling events. The International Human Powered Vehicle Association is the governing body for human-powered vehicles that imposes far fewer restrictions on their design than does the UCI. The UltraMarathon Cycling Association is the governing body for many ultra-distance cycling races. Bicycle racing is recognised as an Olympic sport. Bicycle races are popular all over the world, especially in Europe. The countries most devoted to bicycle racing include Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland. Other countries with international standing include Australia, Luxembourg, United Kingdom, United States and Colombia. History The first bicycle race is popularly held to have been a 1,200 meter race on the 31 May 1868 at the Parc de Saint-Cloud, Paris. It was won by expatriate Englishman James Moore who rode a wooden bicycle with solid rubber tires. The machine is now on display at the museum in Ely, Cambridgeshire, England. The Union Cycliste Internationale was founded on 14 April 1900 by Belgium, the United States, France, Italy, and Switzerland to replace the International Cycling Association, which had been formed in 1892, over a row with Great Britain as well as because of other issues. Racing =Road bicycle= Road bicycle racing involve both team and individual competition, and races are contested in various ways. They range from the one-day road race, criterium, and time trial to multi-stage events like the Tour de France and its sister events which make up cycling's Grand Tours. The races typically take place from spring through to autumn. Many riders from the northern hemisphere spend the winter in countries such as Australia, to compete or train. Professional races range from the three-week \\"Grand Tour\\" stage races such as the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and the Vuelta a Espa√±a to multi-day stage races such as the Tour de Suisse and Tour of California, to single day \\"Classics\\" such as the Tour of Flanders and Milan‚ÄìSan Remo. The longest one-day road race sanctioned by USA Cycling is Lotoja which covers the 206 miles (332 km) from Logan, Utah to Jackson, Wyoming. Criteriums are races based on circuits typically less than a mile in length and sometimes run for a set time (60 min, 90 min, etc.) rather than a specific distance. Criteriums are the most popular form of road racing in North America. In Belgium, kermesses are popular, single-day events of usually over 120 km. As well as road races in which all riders start simultaneously, individual time trial and team time trial events are also held on road-based courses. =Track cycling= Track cycling encompasses races that take place on banked tracks or velodromes. Events are quite diverse and can range from individual and team pursuits, two-man sprints, to various group and mass start races. Competitors use track bicycles which do not have brakes or freewheels. =Cyclo-cross= Cyclo-cross originated as a sport for road racers during the off season, to vary their training during the cold months. Races typically take place in the autumn and winter (the international or World Cup season is September‚ÄìJanuary) and consist of many laps of a 2‚Äì3 km or 1‚Äì2 mile course featuring pavement, wooded trails, grass, steep hills, and obstacles requiring the rider to dismount, carry the bike and remount in one motion. Races for senior categories are generally between 30 minutes and an hour long, the distance varying depending on the conditions. The sport is strongest in traditional road cycling countries such as Belgium (Flanders in particular) and France. =Mountain bike= Mountain bike races are held off- road and involve moderate to high degree of technical riding. There are several varieties; the main categories are cross-country, enduro and downhill but also 4X or four cross racing. =BMX= BMX takes place off-road. BMX races are sprints on purpose-built off-road single-lap tracks typically on single-gear bicycles. Riders navigate a dirt course of jumps and banked and flat corners. =Cycle speedway= Cycle speedway is bicycle racing on short outdoor dirt tracks, 70‚Äì90 m in length. =Motor-paced racing= Motor-paced racing and Keirin use motorcycles for pacing so cyclists achieve higher speeds. =Average speeds= Speeds achieved on indoor tracks are usually greater than those on roads. Other factors affecting speed are the route profile (flats and hills), wind conditions, temperatures and elevation. At a 2013 event in Mexico, Fran√ßois Pervis achieved an average of with a flying start over 200 meters. The top average speed over the men's 1 km time trial at the 2004 Summer Olympics was recorded by Chris Hoy. Average speeds clearly drop with increasing distance, so that over the 120 km Cootamundra Annual Classic it is . In the 259 km 2010 Paris-Roubaix, Fabian Cancellara set a speed of , while over the 818 km Furnace Creek 508, the speed drops dramatically to . For an extreme road distance such as the 4800 km Race Across America, the average speed of the record holder is , while the 2350 km Freedom Trail over mountainous terrain in South Africa is at a record speed of . Non-racing disciplines =Mountain bike trials= Mountain bike trials is a sport where riders navigate natural and man-made obstacles without putting down their foot, or \\"dabbing\\". It is similar to motorcycle trials. Points are awarded for bike handling skills. =Freestyle BMX= Freestyle BMX is an extreme sport of stunt riding BMX bikes. =Artistic cycling= Artistic cycling is a discipline where athletes perform tricks (called exercises) in a format similar to ballet or gymnastics.

He was the father of former United States Deputy Secretary of Defense and World Bank Group President Paul Wolfowitz. Life and career Wolfowitz was born in 1910 in Warsaw, Poland, the son of Helen (Pearlman) and Samuel Wolfowitz. He emigrated with his parents to the United States in 1920. In the mid-1930s, Wolfowitz began his career as a high school mathematics teacher and continued teaching until 1942 when he received his Ph.D. degree in mathematics from New York University. While a part-time graduate student, Wolfowitz met Abraham Wald, with whom he collaborated in numerous joint papers in the field of mathematical statistics. This collaboration continued until Wald's death in an airplane crash in 1950. In 1951, Wolfowitz became a professor of mathematics at Cornell University, where he stayed until 1970. From 1970 to 1978 he was at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. He died of a heart attack in Tampa, Florida, where he had become a professor at the University of South Florida after retiring from Illinois. Wolfowitz's main contributions were in the fields of statistical decision theory, non-parametric statistics, sequential analysis, and information theory. One of his results is the strong converse to Claude Shannon's coding theorem. While Shannon could prove only that the block error probability can not become arbitrarily small if the transmission rate is above the channel capacity, Wolfowitz proved that the block error rate actually converges to one. As a consequence, Shannon's original result is today termed \\"the weak theorem\\" (sometimes also Shannon's \\"conjecture\\" by some authors). Further reading * Kiefer, J., ed.

He was Speaker of the House of Representatives of Thailand 1973-1974. He was the thirteenth Prime Minister of Thailand, serving in office from 1975 to 1976 between Seni Pramoj, his brother's, terms. Being the great-grandson of King Rama II, he was a member of the Thai royal family. He also portrayed the Prime Minister of the fictional country of \\"Sarkhan\\" in the 1963 motion picture The Ugly American with Marlon Brando. Biography He was born on 20 April 1911 at Sing Buri Province into an cadet branch of Chakri Dynasty with Chinese ancestry.http://www.tour- bangkok-legacies.com/home-of-m-r-kukrit.html The son of Brigadier General Prince Khamrob and his wife Daeng (Bunnag), his older brother was M.R. Seni PramojAn Impressive Day at M.R. Kukrit's Home ; Thailand Bibliography while his great-grandmother, Ampha, was of Chinese descent and was a consort of Rama II. He served as a corporal during the Franco-Thai War in 1940. Like many upper class Thais of his generation, his parents sent him and his siblings to boarding schools in England including Trent College. He finished his bachelor's degree in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) from Queen's College, University of Oxford. Upon returning to Thailand, his first job was in the field of banking; but his true vocation was his mastery of many forms of arts, including politics and journalism. Put off by Hollywood's portrayal of revered nineteenth-century king, Mongkut, in the 1946 film Anna and the King of Siam, based on the semi-fictional biographical novel of the same name, Kukrit and his brother, Seni Pramoj, wrote The King of Siam speaks in 1948. They sent their manuscript to the American politician and diplomat Abbot Low Moffat who drew on it for his biography entitled Mongkut the King of Siam (), and in 1961, donated the Pramoj manuscript to the Southeast Asian Collection, Asian Division, Library of Congress. He wrote for Siam Rath, the newspaper that he founded. Kukrit Pramoj (c. 1959) As a means of showing how Thai society adjusted to life in modern society, in 1953 Kukrit began a series of stories on the life and times of fictional Mae Ploy (). who as a young girl enters the service of a princess of Rama V's Royal Household, and dies the same day as Rama VIII. This story was to be one of many that were published in the Kukrit's Siam Rat. His satirical sense and unique sense of humour offered an incisive view of the times Kukrit chronicled.. As a scholar, he also wrote many non-fiction works ranging from history and religion to astrology. Most notable are his epics and many short stories portraying various aspects of life and documenting contemporary history. His Many Lives (, Lai Chiwit) was also translated into English. He was a leading authority on traditional Thai culture and had a polymathic range of interests from Thailand's classical dance to literature. Most famous for his literary works, he was named a National Artist of Thailand for literature in 1985, the inaugural year for the honour. And he received The Special Commemorative Prize of The Fukuoka Asian Culture Prizes in 1990, the inaugural year for the prizes again. His works encompass many subjects from humour to drama. He was also known as a staunch loyalist and served the monarchy for his entire life. He is considered one of the great statesmen of Thailand. His former home is now a heritage museum which is preserved; paying homage to his life and Thai traditions. He was married to M.R. Pakpring Thongyai with whom he had two children, a son and daughter. He died on 9 October 1995.

Englund had difficulty casting the part of the fictional Prime Minister, but he was so impressed by Kukrit's cultural refinement and mastery of English that he offered him the part, saying, \\"I can't think of anyone who could play it better.\\" Kukrit accepted, saying, according to Englund, \\"We are all actors anyway, and I think you're right that I could play it better than anyone.\\" Probably because of this, after he became a real-life Prime Minister of Thailand in 1975, the word \\"Sarkhan\\" has entered the Thai language as a nickname of Thailand itself, often with a slight self- deprecating or mocking tone.  M.R. Kukrit Heritage Home  The home that M.R. Kukrit built for himself in Bangkok has been registered by the Department of Fine Arts as 'Home of an Important Person'. It is open to the public on Saturdays, Sundays and official Thai holidays between 10am and 5pm. Standing in of land, surrounded by landscaped gardens, the house is a similar concept to the Jim Thompson House in Bangkok. Five small traditional Thai houses were dismantled and reassembled at the present site to make one house. The house is filled with artefacts and books collected by the owner. Additions to the original house include air conditioning, a modern bathroom, and a lift was installed when the owner became too frail to climb up and down stairs. The M.R. Kukrit Heritage Home is situated at 19 Soi Phra Pinit, South Sathorn Road, Sathon District, Bangkok 10120. Tel. +66 (0)2 286 8185. The nearest BTS Skytrain station is Chong Nonsi. English speaking guides are available to show visitors around. Photography is not allowed inside the house. The entrance fee is Bt50 for adults and Bt20 for children and students. Literary Works =Literary career= Kukrit Pramoj is perhaps best known in Thailand for his literary production, particularly his novel Four Reigns, which was published as a serial in his newspaper Siam Rat in 1950. Four Reigns tells the story of \\"Mae Ploi,\\" a young girl who grew up in the court of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) where she was an attendant to one of the princesses. Kukrit extends her story after her marriage during the reign of Rama VI, and in the process tells the story of mid-twentieth century Thailand through Mae Ploi's eyes. The story includes the reigns of four Kings of the Chakri dynasty (thus the title \\"Four Reigns\\"), and the 1932 Revolution against the absolute monarchy.see \\"The Transformation of Values as Seen Through \\"Si Phaen Din\\" by Dr. Mattani Mojdara Rutnin, republished in Kukrit Pramoj, His Wit and Wisdom (1983). Four Reigns was translated into English by Tulachandra. The Thai version of Four Reigns continues to be well-known to Thais in the twenty-first century because it has been used in Thai schools, and has been produced as a well-known films. Only two other of Kukrit's many novels, Many Lives, and Red Bamboo are translated into English. In addition, there is a compilation of Kukrit's English language writings and interviews, M. R. Kukrit Pramoj, His Wit and Wisdom, compiled by Vilas Manivat, and edited by Steve Van Beek. However, Kukrit's writings in the Thai language are voluminous, and include both fiction and non-fiction. Much of Kukrit's writing was first published as either columns or serials in the Siam Rat. A number of the books serialized and later turned into books including Four Reigns.Van Beek (1983), pp. 20-21. A wide range of subjects were addressed in these books, including contemporary politics, Kukrit's love of dogs, Thai history, Southeast Asian history, elephants, a history of the Jews, and many other subjects.Van Beek, Steve (1983). \\"Kukrit the man: A Brief Account,\\" pp. 11-26, in Kukrit Pramoj: His Wit and Wisdom by Kukrit Pramoj.

(NEB) was an Irish agency charged with developing nuclear power in Ireland. It was established in Ireland on November 30, 1973 by the Nuclear Energy (An Bord Fuinnimh N√∫icl√©igh) Act 1971. The board was responsible in the 1970s for pursuing the policy of developing a nuclear power station, which was to be located at Carnsore Point, County Wexford. This policy ultimately failed and the board gradually faded from public attention, eventually concentrating on nuclear-related environmental reports. It was not a large organisation, with the Electricity Supply Board doing most operational work. Nuclear power = Planning = In 1968, Ireland's economic development required more energy production and the Electricity Supply Board began evaluating ways of diversifying its electricity generation. The Turlough Hill project had just commenced and this was one of the most prestigious engineering projects since the foundation of the state and the Shannon hydroelectric scheme. In the 1970s the need for new energy sources became more urgent, especially after the 1973 energy crisis. In 1975 Bord G√°is was established in order to develop Kinsale gas field, slowing the nuclear energy project as it was hoped it may be an alternative. However, in 1974 planning permission was sought for four reactors with County Wexford County Council, with one to be built immediately, most likely of pressurized water reactor design. = Uncertainty = The economic slowdown of 1974 and 1975 saw the project temporarily put on hold. When Desmond O'Malley became the new Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy in 1977 the project once again became a priority of government policy. This time the government wanted to build a 650 MW plant at Carnsore at a cost of ¬£350 million (Punt) at then-prices. In 1979 the project was again postponed, following a change in government when George Colley became the new minister in charge of the project and the incident at Three Mile Island in the United States. Friends of the Earth and other groups lobbied against the plan and in 1981 the Electricity Supply Board and the government announced it was no longer national policy. = Cancellation = Ultimately the board was remembered for the plans put on and off hold, and resulting immense controversy. Also there was criticism that the government overestimated the need of energy in Ireland in the future; at one point it was estimated that industry would consume 57% of energy by 1990 - internationally this is rather large, as 40% is a typical value. Nevertheless, Ireland in the 1970s was regarded as being in a dangerous position on energy, as 75% of needs were met by oil, and European Economic Community policy was to reduce this below 50% by 1985, after two energy crises. Aftermath After 1981 the Nuclear Energy Board was not immediately abolished, instead rather than becoming nuclear advocate, with the board became redefined in a new role as an environmentalist. The board sponsored a number of reports, in particular on the Sellafield plant which has long been a source of dispute between Ireland and the United Kingdom. On 1 April 1992 the successor to the board was established, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.

He served as the United States Secretary of the Treasury for President Dwight D. Eisenhower.  Early life  Humphrey was born on March 8, 1890, and raised in Cheboygan, Michigan, the son of Caroline (n√©e Magoffin) Humphrey (1861‚Äì1946) and Watts Sherman Humphrey (1844‚Äì1916). Through his brother Watts S. Humphrey, he was the uncle of software engineer Watts Humphrey. He received both his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Michigan. Career After practicing law in Saginaw, Michigan for five years with his father's firm, he accepted a position as general counsel with steel manufacturer M. A. Hanna Company in 1917. That association lasted 35 years and included his ascension to company president in 1929. He served as Chairman of The Business Council, then known as the Business Advisory Council for the United States Department of Commerce in 1946.The Business Council, Official website, Background Following Dwight Eisenhower's election to the Presidency in 1952, Humphrey was recommended by close adviser General Lucius D. Clay, who had worked with the corporate magnate regarding post-war plans in Germany.  Secretary of the Treasury  As Secretary of the Treasury in the first Republican Administration in 20 years, Humphrey was one of the most influential of President Eisenhower's Cabinet members. Eisenhower was once quoted as saying, \\"When George speaks, we all listen.\\" Humphrey had given up a $300,000 salary to accept the Cabinet position that paid just $22,500. He fought to have a balanced budget, tight money, limits on welfare and foreign aid, as well as \\"trickle down\\" tax cuts. He was even more adamant about government spending, saying in a 1957 press conference that if it wasn't curbed, \\"you will have a depression that will curl your hair.\\" Humphrey left office on July 29, 1957. Following Humphrey's departure that same year, he returned to the Hanna Company, serving as honorary board chairman and director, then later became chairman of National Steel Corporation. = Later life= In 1962, Humphrey became embroiled in a potential controversy when a Senate committee investigated the stockpiling of nickel during his time in the Cabinet. The $98 million deal involved companies he had once headed, but he explained that his motivation was to increase the country's strategic stockpiles and was thus cleared. He made no profit from the deal. Personal life On January 15, 1913, Humphrey was married to Pamela Stark of Saginaw. They had three children together: * Cynthia Pamela Humphrey, who married Royal Firman Jr. They divorced in September 1970. * Gilbert Watts Humphrey (d. 1979), who became the Chairman of the Hanna conglomerate. * Caroline Helen Humphrey, who married John G. Butler. In his later years, Humphrey essentially remained out of the spotlight. His health deteriorated when he suffered an apparent heat stroke in August 1969. He then became a frequent visitor to hospitals until entering Cleveland's University Hospital cardiac unit on December 27, 1969. He died there on January 20, 1970. He was buried at the Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio.  References  External links *Papers of George M. Humphrey, Dwight D.

Thanks to a close personal friendship with President Harry S Truman, he became Secretary of the Treasury in the Truman administration. He is the first native-born Arkansan to hold a US Cabinet post.http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry- detail.aspx?entryID=5095 Historian Alonzo Hamby emphasizes Snyder's conservatism, stating that he was openly skeptical of New Dealism, broad- gauged social programs, and intellectuals who believed the economy could be run from Washington. Early life Snyder was born in Jonesboro, Arkansas, on June 21, 1895, to Jeremiah \\"Jerre\\" Hartwell Snyder and his wife Ellen (Hatcher),the third of six children. His father owned a small patent medicine manufacturing and distribution business in Jonesboro, Arkansas. Snyder obtained his early education through high school in Jonesboro, Arkansas and later attended Vanderbilt University‚Äôs School of Engineering from 1914 to 1915. Because of finances, he quit and returned to Arkansas, moving to Forrest City, Arkansas where he boarded with his sister, Sula Snyder Warren, and taught at a small country school.http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry- detail.aspx?entryID=5095 Snyder volunteered for the army in 1915 and trained at Fort Logan H. Roots in North Little Rock, Arkansas, in the artillery. He served with distinction as an officer in the Thirty-second Artillery. He saw action during World War I in five different sectors of the Western Front and was decorated for his service by both the United States and France. During his service in the artillery, he became friends with other noted Americans such as boxer Gene Tunney, America‚Äôs ‚Äúace of aces‚Äù fighter pilot Eddie Rickenbacker, and future presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Harry S. Truman (also in the artillery). Snyder was mustered out of the army in 1919 and returned to Arkansas after the war. He retained his commission as a captain and ultimately achieved the rank of colonel in the Army Reserve.http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry- detail.aspx?entryID=5095 On January 5, 1920, he married Carrie Evlyn Cook (1895-1956). They had one daughter, Edith Cook \\"Drucie\\" Snyder Horton (1925-1999) born in Forrest City, Arkansas. Although he planned to return to school to become an electrical engineer, at the urging of his uncle, Snyder took his first job in the banking industry as a bookkeeper in a bank in Forrest City, Arkansas. During the next ten years, he advanced rapidly in his chosen profession, working as an officer of numerous banks in Arkansas and Missouri.http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry- detail.aspx?entryID=5095 Washington Snyder moved to Washington in the early 1930s with a broad background in banking and business. He held several public and private offices including National Bank Receiver in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Loan Administrator, and Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion. In the last office he played a leading part in the transition of the American economy from a wartime to a peacetime basis. Liberals complained that he removed federal controls on the economy too quickly after the war, hurting consumers, delaying the housing program and bankrupting small businesses. His biographer says, \\"His handling of the steel crisis in 1946 was an even greater fiasco.\\"Vibha Kapuria-Foreman (1996), p 343 Treasury Secretary Snyder was appointed Secretary of the Treasury in 1946 by his close personal friend President Harry S. Truman, with whom he had served in the Army Reserves. Editorials criticized the cronyism and said his narrow range of experience made him unfit for the job.Vibha Kapuria-Foreman (1996), p 343 His task as Secretary was to establish a stable postwar economy. The main points of his program were maintaining confidence in the credit of the government, reducing the federal debt, keeping the interest rate low, and encouraging public thrift through investment in U.S. Savings Bonds. A deeply conservative businessman, he had faith that the free economy would work itself out. He reduced the national debt while balancing the budget. He was reluctant to spend large sums on the Marshall Plan of aid to Europe. Snyder had little diplomatic experience, and in his negotiations with British leadership regarding Britain's need for dollars, he angered his counterparts. Paul Nitze, an American negotiator, recalled a meeting in Washington in September 1949: :at one point Secretary Snyder made some very -- well, remarks which I thought were wholly undiplomatic and rude and showed his lack of concern for the UK problem (the general sense of them was why didn't the UK get a hold of itself, and why didn't its people do some work for change and why don't you cure those productivity problems in the United Kingdom, and why don't you get off your butt).Peter Hennessy, Never Again: Britain 1945-1951 (2006) p 340. At another meeting his British counterpart, Chancellor of the Exchequer Hugh Gaitskell, concluded that Snyder was, \\"a pretty small minded, small town semi- isolationist.\\" Happily for the British Snyder was outmaneuvered by Secretary of State Dean Acheson, who was much more sympathetic.Kenneth O. Morgan, Labour in power, 1945-1951 (1985) p 479 Snyder funded the Korean War by increasing taxes. He feuded constantly with the Federal Reserve system, until it became more independent in 1951. He retired from government in 1953 at the end of Truman's second term. Snyder died in Seabrook Island, South Carolina, on October 8, 1985, at the age of 90, and was buried in Washington National Cathedral.

He was the founder of the Canadian Psychological Association, the first Director of the Institute of Experimental Psychology, and Professor of Psychology at the University of Oxford. Humphrey‚Äôs research concentrated on behavioral studies such as reinforcement, habituation, and apparent movements, as well as psychophysical topics like audiogenic seizures. He is known for Humphrey‚Äôs Law.  Personal life  George Humphrey was born in the county of Kent, England on 17 July 1889. He was a student of Wilhelm Wundt, who inspired Humphrey‚Äôs early passion for experimental psychology. Psychologist Raymond Dodge also impacted Humphrey‚Äôs work in experimental psychology, as they amicably worked together at Wesleyan University. Being well known for his academic achievement and also highly regarded by his peers, Humphrey was selected by St. John‚Äôs College at Cambridge to be the first Dominion Fellow of the college‚Äôs new ‚ÄúDominion Fellowship,‚Äù established in 1947, to recognize individuals with a profound commitment to study and scholarship. He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry. Humphrey married Muriel Miller in 1918, but after her death in 1955, he remarried the following year to his colleague Berta Hotchberger. He spent the last years of his life in St. John‚Äôs College at Cambridge, where he was actively involved in the school and surrounded by close friends. Humphrey died after an illness quickly took his life on 24 April 1966. In his honor, Queen's University designated the main building of their department of psychology as Humphrey Hall. His colleagues remembered him as being very friendly, active, and neat, but also tenacious of his opinions.  Education  Humphrey graduated with honors from the University of Oxford where he studied the classical languages, mathematics, and philosophy. He was given a scholarship to study psychology at the University of Leipzig and worked alongside Wilhelm Wundt in the first psychology laboratory. Humphrey received a Ph.D. in psychology from Harvard University in 1920.  Professional History  In 1916, Humphrey traveled to Canada to teach classics at St. Francis Xavier University until 1918. After receiving his doctorate in 1920, he took a job as an assistant professor for four years at Wesleyan University in the United States. Humphrey returned to Canada and was given the position of Charlton Professor in Psychology at Queen‚Äôs University from 1924 to 1947. When he arrived at the university, psychology was a relatively new field of study and he made great strides to further develop the department. In 1939, he founded the Canadian Psychological Association and appointed Donald Hebb to be the first instructor in experimental psychology at Queen‚Äôs. Like other experimental psychologists at the time, he set up his own laboratory to bring the study of experimental psychology to the university. He was named head of the department and added new psychology courses, including graduate courses. Because of Humphrey‚Äôs contributions, the university began to recognize psychology as being independent from the philosophy department, but wasn‚Äôt formalized until 1950 after he left. He went on to become the first professor of psychology at his alma mater, University of Oxford, which had just opened a new honors school in psychology, philosophy, and physiology. He prompted the university to establish the Oxford Institute of Experimental Psychology and was named its first director. Humphrey also helped to develop military personnel tests and directed research for the Canadian Army during World War II. In 1956, he retired to Cambridge, England at the age of 67. Though no longer a professor, he continued to give lectures in Germany for the British Embassy.  Major Contributions and Works  Humphrey‚Äôs keen interest in human nature was encouraged by his time spent with Wundt. After the birth of his daughter, Humphrey observed the newborn by holding her out a second story window to see if she would respond with fear. He was then inspired to write several publications concerning the behavior of children. His first book, The Story of Man‚Äôs Mind (1932), advocates the significance of experience by referencing the case of the French feral child, Victor of Aveyron, and later wrote (with his wife Muriel Miller) a 1932 translation of Itard‚Äôs The Wild Boy of Aveyron. The Story of Man's Mind covers several schools of psychological thought including behaviorism, Gestalt psychology, and psychoanalysis. With Freud in his prime, Humphrey expressed skepticism about psychoanalytic theory, arguing that the role of sex was grossly overemphasized in the development of children. He also diminished the theory about the unconscious mind, claiming that much of it can be explained by the nature of conditioned reflexes. However, he did cite the existence of unconscious thought processes in Humphrey's Law, which states that automatization of a task (usually in the case of movement) is impaired when a task is performed with conscious effort. His work on classical conditioning revealed that the context in which a stimulus is presented majorly affects how the subject learns to respond, which he discussed in his second book, The Nature of Learning (1933). This book is considered by Queen's University to be his most important work. It brought attention to the concept of living organisms being \\"systems\\" that are regulated by homeostasis, physiologically and psychologically. In 1951, he wrote Thinking: An Introduction to Its Experimental Psychology, which had considerable success as it provided a written description of all research done on mental problem solving in humans conducted by Otto Selz, the W√ºrzburg School, and other Gestalt psychologists. Their findings largely supported Humphrey's assertion‚Äîdiscussed in his book Directed Thinking (1948)‚Äîthat a sequence of thoughts is governed by motivation. Humphrey thought that mental escapism could have great benefits and was healthy within reason. He particularly believed that watching movies helped \\"soothe the raw nerves\\" of people living in a post-war era. To him, escapism provided a means of coping with other aspects of everyday life that were overly restrictive, like work. Under the alternate pen name Donald MacPherson, Humphrey wrote two other books. Go Home Unicorn and Men Are Like Animals were science fiction novels that drew from Freudian psychology and were published pseudonymously in 1935 and 1937, respectively.

The town is an ecotourism destination due to its proximity to Kahurangi National Park and Farewell Spit Nature Reserve. History The town was originally named Gibbstown after the local settler and politician William Gibbs (1817‚Äì1897), who arrived in the area in 1851. The settlement was later renamed Collingwood after Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, Lord Nelson's second-in-command at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Following the discovery of payable gold deposits in the Aorere Valley in 1856 the town's population surged and the suggestion was made that Collingwood should become New Zealand's capital. In 1864, three Australian commissioners were tasked with recommending a more central location for the capital and they did visit Golden Bay (then still known as Massacre Bay) but their recommendation was for Wellington.Appendix to the Journals of the House of Representatives, 1864 Session D, No 2, Page 13 The town has been damaged by fire several times, being almost destroyed in 1904.Griffith, P., 2008.

Biography Former residence of Daniel Manning in Washington, D.C. Manning was born May 16, 1831, in Albany, New York. He was educated in the public schools and then entered the world of commerce. At the age of 11, Manning went to work for the Albany Atlas, which consolidated with the Argus in 1856. Manning became editor in 1865 and owner in 1873. In 1853, he married Mary Little, who died in 1882. There were four children: James Hilton Manning, who was a editor and manager of the Albany Argus; Frederick Clinton Manning, a prominent engraver of Albany; Mary E., wife of Jules C. Van der Oudermeuluen; Anna, wife of John A. Delehanty. In 1884, Manning married Mary Margaretta Fryer (1844-1928), daughter of William John Fryer and Margaret Livingston (Crofts) Fryer. Mary Margaretta Fryer Mary Margaretta Fryer was closely identified with the social life of President Cleveland's second administration as well as the first. Fryer was a native of Albany, and a daughter of William J. Fryer, an honored citizen of the state of New York. On her mother's side, she descended from Lord Livingston, and her ancestry did good service during Colonial times in shaping the affairs of New York State. She was Regent of the Albany Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, and interested in the work of that organization. Manning's political career was very successful as well.

Kiptanui was also the first man ever to run 3000m steeplechase in under eight minutes. Career Kiptanui emerged in 1991 as a relatively unknown athlete. He won several IAAF Grand Prix races that season. He celebrated an especially spectacular victory in Zurich where he fell on the track on the last lap but still won easily.

The neighborhood is located just south of downtown Oklahoma City on the North Canadian River.About Capitol Hill (accessed May 26, 2010). The Capitol Hill Urban Design District is an area designated in 1996 by Oklahoma City to try to maintain the existing historic, architectural and visual character of an area, while at the same time encouraging compatible, quality, new development. In 1997, Capitol Hill became an official Main Street community and today the district enjoys a rich multi- cultural quality Despite its name, Capitol Hill is a historic business and entertainment district in south Oklahoma City and should not be confused with the capitol campus, which is centered at N. Lincoln Blvd and E. 23rd Street where the state capitol building (of Oklahoma) and other government agencies reside. Geography The Capitol Hill neighborhood is south of downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and borders the Oklahoma River. History Capitol Hill was platted in 1900 by Benoni Harrington. The district soon became a center of commerce that boasted of major department stores such as John A. Brown and J.C. Penney. With the introduction of malls, particularly Crossroads Mall, many stores left Capitol Hill. Capitol Hill continued to decay until Capitol Hill Main Street, established in 1997, provided a foundation of economic development, promotion, design and organization that is restoring Capitol Hill to its former glory. Since 1997, the district has garnered $14.8 million in public and private reinvestment. Art and culture The area is now the center of Hispanic oriented commerce, culture, and nightlife, including the Knob Hill Theater, formally home to the Oklahoma Opry, restaurants, bakeries, graphic designers, churches, and service businesses. One of the major employers in the area is the Community Action Agency of Oklahoma and Canadian Counties. Though the area was annexed by Oklahoma City, it has retained its own chamber of commerce, community newspaper and even its own downtown along Commerce Street.

He was a notable anti-suffragist, challenging the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1920 and serving as president of the American Constitutional League. Biography Charles Stebbins Fairchild was born on April 30, 1842, in Cazenovia, New York, to Helen Childs and Sidney Thompson Fairchild. He attended a local seminary and graduated from Harvard College in 1863, then Harvard Law School in 1865. He then began practicing law in Albany with the firm of Hand, Hale & Swartz; and soon became active in the Democratic Party of New York. He was married to Helen Lincklaen in 1871, and began serving in minor governmental capacities until 1874 when he became Deputy Attorney General of New York. He was involved in the prosecution and eventual conviction of New York City Police Commissioners Oliver Charlick and Hugh Gardner for removing elected inspectors without notice. When Samuel J. Tilden was elected Governor of New York, he directed Fairchild to lead the prosecution of the Canal Ring. Tilden then backed Fairchild to be Attorney General of New York, first at the Democratic party convention in Syracuse in 1875. He was elected in 1875 and was in office from 1876 to 1877. Fairchild was not reelected and failed to defeat the Canal Ring. In January 1878, he was nominated to be Superintendent of Public Works by Gov. Lucius Robinson, but was rejected by the New York State Senate.Nominated in NYT on January 5, 1878Rejected in NYT on January 16, 1878 He resumed the practice of law until 1885, when he was appointed Assistant U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. Fairchild led a commission that overhauled the department, resulting in the firing of hundreds of clerks, changes in methods of bookkeeping and cuts in expenses attributed to the United States Customs House. When Secretary Daniel Manning's health forced him to resign in 1887, Fairchild was appointed to succeed, and served in Grover Cleveland's administration from 1887 to 1889. In 1886, the United States Treasury had a surplus of approximately $94 million due to high taxes and custom collections. In an attempt to prevent money from accumulating, Fairchild asked the United States Congress to reduce taxes and allow money to be deposited in banks. After Congress refused both requests, Fairchild began buying back government bonds to dispose of surplus revenue. His action is seen by some as averting a financial crisis. He was removed from office when Grover Cleveland lost reelection in 1888, and refused to return after Cleveland won again in 1892. As a Gold Democrat, he opposed the nomination of William Jennings Bryan for president. Fairchild then moved to New York City and was a prominent figure in business and philanthropy. He was involved with the Charity Organization Society. He was President of the New York Security and Trust Company from 1889 to 1904. He was on the board of the American Mechanical Cashier Company (a competitor of NCR) with investment banker Henry L. Horton and Judge Hiram Bond. He was President of the Atlanta and Charlotte Air Line Railroad and a director of the Erie and Pittsburgh Railroad. He was a prominent figure in the opposition to a 'snap convention' held by David B. Hill in 1892. Fairchild also served as president of the American Constitutional League (formerly the Men's Anti-Suffrage Association). = Fairchild v Hughes = Fairchild v. Hughes was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States decided whether a citizen, in a state that already had women's suffrage, had standing to challenge the validity of the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment. On July 7, 1920, Fairchild challenged the validity of the ratification process for the Nineteenth Amendment in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. The district court dismissed the case on July 20, and Fairchild appealed. On August 26, Hughes acknowledged Tennessee's ratification, and the Nineteenth Amendment became law. The Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court decision. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard arguments in November, 1922. In February, the Court unanimously decided that Fairchild, as a private citizen, lacked standing to challenge the amendment's ratification under the limitations of the Case or Controversy Clause of Article III.. = Later life and death = Fairchild died on November 24, 1924, and was buried at the Evergreen Cemetery in Cazenovia, New York. At the time of his death, he was the last living member of the first Cleveland Administration. Fairchild and his wife lived in the Lorenzo House. He was a brother of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Alpha chapter).

The festival was a weekend event which featured a variety of local bands and national headliners. Mainly aimed at local residents, the festival did not have overnight camping facilities and was financed by donations and benefit gigs. Starting as a small one-day festival in 1974, the festival grew during succeeding years and was said to be Britain's largest free festival until changes brought on by government legislation resulted in compulsory fees and security fencing being introduced. After problems were caused by a temporary move to Hengrove Park in 2001, due to the foot and mouth crisis, and a washout in 2007, the organisers declared bankruptcy in 2007. History Firetwirling was a popular amateur event at Ashton Court Festival. Image from 2005 festival. =Origins= The first festival was held in 1974, organised by Royce Creasey and friends, as a small event, for the local musicians to entertain the local community. The first festival took place over four successive weekends with bands playing from a stage improvised from a flat bed truck. Bristol City Council donated ¬£50. The following year the festival took place over one weekend and was located near to Ashton Court mansion. After this, new organisers came on board and fund-raising gigs were held enabling the event to grow steadily through the 1970s. =1980= In 1980, large numbers of people from far afield attended, trees were damaged and burnt and there was illegal camping and lurid press reports of drugs and nudity. It was not until 1983 that the festival recommenced. when it was a one-day event; in 1984 a de facto two-day event was created by staging it back-to-back with a one-day WOMAD event. The festival took place in a large sloped clearing surrounded on three sides by New Barn Wood and Clarken Coombe. The main stage was placed at the bottom of the slope and the second stage in a natural amphitheatre near the entrance to the clearing. There were many other performance spaces, varying from year to year, including a dance tent, marquees for world music, acoustic acts and performing arts, and the \\"Blackout\\" tent for experimental music and video, as well as a children's area and funfair rides. Camping on the festival site was not allowed. =21st century= In 2001 the Bristol Community Festival temporarily relocated to Hengrove Park in the south of the city. Ashton Court Estate, which includes a deer park, was closed as a quarantine measure due to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease that affected the United Kingdom that year. The move caused a massive drop in attendance and a heavy financial loss, leading to debts which hung over the organisation. This, along with changes to licensing laws and tightening health and safety requirements, led to a more commercial style of organisation, with a compulsory entrance fee and a strict security presence around the perimeter fence. This attracted criticism from some locals who felt that the \\"community\\" nature of the festival had been lost. Even so, the festival continued to be run by volunteers on a not-for-profit basis. In 2003 the weight and vibrations of crowds returning from the Ashton Court Festival and the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta put such a great strain on the Clifton Suspension Bridge that the Bridge Trustees decided to close the bridge to all traffic, including pedestrians, for the entirety of the festival and most of the Balloon Fiesta in 2004 and 2005. =Crisis= In December 2006 it was announced that the festival was in financial crisis and there was uncertainty over whether the 2007 event would take place. The festival planning went ahead with support and donations from a number of Bristol businesses. In June 2007 it was announced that alcohol would not be allowed to be taken on site, but would be available to purchase from official bars within the arena. Also, that everyone attending the festival would be searched on the way in. This announcement caused much controversy. Although locals have long referred to the festival as the \\"Ashton Court Festival\\", before 2004 it was officially called the Bristol Community Festival. Since then it became increasingly popular, and for several years it was claimed to be Britain's biggest free festival; however, the \\"suggested minimum donation\\" for entry become a gradually increasing compulsory entry fee. From 2007, children (aged 10‚Äì16) also had to pay an entry fee, while under 10s remained free (previously all children got in free), and a new discounted weekend ticket became available. The festival was typically attended by over 60,000 people annually. In the festival's last year, 2007, the site was moved to Smythe's field in front of Ashton Court Mansion. On the second day, the event was cancelled due to torrential rain, which made the site inaccessible to emergency vehicles. \\"The health and safety of our audience is what is important,\\" said organiser Steve Hunt. Over 80 bands were due to perform that day, including Damon Albarn's The Good, the Bad & the Queen. The cancellation increased the pressure on the already strained finances of the festival. On Friday 20 July 2007 Bristol Community Festival Ltd, the not-for-profit company which organised the event, announced that it had started the process of winding up the company due to unsustainable financial losses. Notable performers The festival's music policy always focused on local acts, but since the late 1990s there was a move towards attracting national acts to headline the festival. Major acts at Ashton Court in recent years include: * Steve Hillage in 1978 * Portishead in 1998. * Feeder and Rae & Christian in 1999. * Mad Professor, Kosheen and Stereo MC's in 2001. * Reef and Kosheen and Dirty Drugs in 2002. * Robert Plant, McKay and The Electric Soft Parade in 2003. * The Stranglers, Goldie Lookin' Chain and Glenn Tilbrook in 2004. * Super Furry Animals, Lemon Jelly, Roni Size and Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel in 2005. * Simple Minds, The Go! Team, Plan B in 2006. * The Good, the Bad & the Queen, The Fall, Gravenhurst in 2007. Legacy Following the end of Bristol Community Festival, other groups emerged hoping to continue with some sort of summer festival in Bristol. Bristol Music Festival became the Bristol Festival (now BrisFest) and has so far successfully put on four summer festivals, albeit in the city centre. 2011 saw the most successful even yet, with over 25,000 people attending over three days. BrisFest returned to Ashton Court in 2012 and 2013, however announced in December 2013 that they would not be continuing the festival into 2014. The event returned in 2015 and 2016 as part of the \\"Let's Rock Bristol\\" retro festival.

Standings or rankings are listings which compare sports teams or individuals, institutions, nations, companies, or other entities by ranking them in order of ability or achievement. A table or chart (such as a league table, a ladder or a leaderboard) may be employed to display such listings. A league table may list several related statistics, but they are generally sorted by the primary one that determines the rankings. Many industries and institutions may compete in league tables in order to help bring in new customers and clients. Those tables ranking sports teams are generally used to help determine who may advance to the playoffs or another tournament, who is promoted or relegated, or who gets a higher draft pick. Sport In sport, league tables group teams of similar abilities in a chart to show the current standing of the participants (teams or individuals) in a sports league or competition. These lists are generally published in newspapers and other media, as well as the official web sites of the sports leagues and competitions. At the very least, a league table will show the names of the teams and their points total or winning percentage (depending on the sport), sorted in order of points or percentage. However, many league tables show further statistics; these may include: * wins * losses * ties (draws) * goal differential (Goals scored minus goals conceded) ** goals scored ** goals allowed (conceded) * home/away win/loss records Usually, if a league is divided into conferences and divisions, the league table will also be. Often, a less specific table is also included. For example, National Hockey League tables will normally have a detailed table for each division, plus a table for each conference showing just the points totals. As an example, below is the league table for the Northeast Division of the National Hockey League, as of March 31, 2004: Team GP W L T OL GF GA Pts x-Boston 79 40 18 14 7 201 179 101 x-Toronto 80 43 24 10 3 234 204 99 x-Ottawa 79 41 22 10 6 254 178 98 x-Montreal 79 40 28 7 4 201 182 91 Buffalo 79 36 32 7 4 213 210 83 x - clinched playoff spot y - clinched division championship In the above table, an \\"x\\" placed before a team's name shows that the team has qualified for playoff position; other letters may be used to show that a team is guaranteed first place, has been eliminated from contention and so forth. From this table, we can see that Boston, Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal are all guaranteed playoff positions; the absence of a \\"y\\" shows that the division championship is still to play for. Meanwhile, because Buffalo has no symbol at all, they are not out of playoff contention, but have yet to clinch a playoff position. The following day, a new league table would appear in newspapers, updated based on the previous night's games. Of course, the above table would also be accompanied by those of the other divisions in the league. Education League tables are used to compare the academic achievements of different institutions. College and university rankings order institutions in higher education by combinations of factors. In addition to entire institutions, specific programs, departments, and schools are ranked. These rankings usually are conducted by magazines, newspapers, governments and academics. For example, league tables of British universities are published annually by The Guardian, The Independent, The Sunday Times and The Times. The primary aim of these rankings is to inform potential applicants about British universities based on a range of criteria. Similarly, in countries like India, league tables are being developed and a popular magazine, Education World, published them based on data from TheLearningPoint.net. It is complained that the ranking of England's schools to rigid guidelines that fail to take into account wider social conditions actually makes failing schools even worse. This is because the most involved parents will then avoid such schools, leaving only the children of non-ambitious parents to attend.Chris Roberts, Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme, Thorndike Press,2006 () Business In business, league tables list the leaders in investment banking activity, enabling people to quickly analyze financial data. Companies which collect this kind of data include Dealogic, Bloomberg L.P. and Thomson Reuters. The Thomson Reuters league tables list the top financiers in a particular industry. Dealogic's league tables are rankings of investment banks in terms of the dollar volume of deals that investment banks work on.

The Patrons lobbied extensively and became politically active, running provincial and federal candidates. The Manitoba Patrons, as a fraternal organization, was initially focused on coordinating an agrarian cooperative movement on the Prairies. Its first lodges in Manitoba and the North-West Territories began in 1890, with a \\"grand lodge\\" (central body) established in 1891.Brandon Mail, March 12, 1896, page 1 At first the group was known as the \\"Patrons of Manitoba and the North-West\\" - its conventions included delegates from Manitoba and the territorial districts of Assiniboia, Saskatchewan and Alberta.Brandon Mail, January 25, 1894 The organization's leader was Charles Braithwaite, who was chosen at a convention held in November 1891. Through direct bulk buying in competition with established stores, the movement brought down the price of farm supplies (binder twine) and other farmers' needs, and through strong lobbying it helped achieve a cut in tariffs on imported goods important to farmers. The Manitoba group turned to direct political action in 1894. Following a tour of Manitoba by Braithwaite (who was a spellbinding orator), the Patrons nominated candidates in all but two of the province's constituencies, in anticipation of the next provincial election. The Patrons were the first \\"third party\\" to emerge in Manitoba after partisan government was formally introduced to the province in 1888. They opposed both Conservatives and Liberals and were for a time affiliated with Dalton McCarthy, a dissident federal Conservative. On August 23, 1894, the Patrons proved they were a significant force in Manitoba politics when their candidate John Forsyth defeated Conservative leader John Andrew Davidson in a two-sided Beautiful Plains by-election (there was no Liberal candidate in the race). Forsyth was expelled from the Patrons in 1895 for using a railway pass (given free to legislators) in violation of party policy. Patrons of Industry made an appearance in the 1894 NWT Assembly election, running J.E. Annable in the Moose Jaw district - unsuccessfully. The party became internally divided over the Manitoba Schools Question. Many Catholic Patrons were alienated by the party's support of Liberal Premier Thomas Greenway's efforts to eliminate denominational schools, and left the party. The Patrons ran seven candidates in the provincial election of 1896, and two of them were elected: Watson Crosby in Dennis and William Sirett in Beautiful Plains. The Patrons ran candidates in two Manitoba provincial by- elections in 1896 who were not successful. (On the other hand, Matt McCauley was elected with official Patron backing in Edmonton (Alberta) in the 1896 North-West Assembly election.) Ed. Bulletin, August 13, 1896, page 3 Three Manitoba Patrons -- Postlethwaite (Brandon), Braithwaite (Macdonald), and Marshall (Marquette) -- ran in the 1896 federal election, but were unsuccessful, finishing third in their ridings. Braithwaite, who had led the Manitoba Patrons of Industry party since 1891, stepped down as party leader in January 1897, and the party effectively ceased to exist after this time. PI MLA Crosby died in 1897, and PI MLA Sirett did not run for re-election in 1899. In addition to supporting agrarian interests, the Patrons also supported prohibition, universal suffrage (for men and women) and electoral reform. These policies would later re-emerge in the platform of the Progressive Party of Canada and other farmer political parties such as the United Farmers of Manitoba and the United Farmers of Alberta.

The leader of the group was T. Nagi Reddy, who was a member of the legislative assembly in AP at the time. Other leading figures were D.V. Rao, Chandra Pulla Reddy and Kolla Venkaiah. Both Reddy and Rao had been active in the Telangana armed struggle, and Rao had formulated the \\"Andhra Thesis\\" of the Communist Party of India (CPI). APCCCR split from CPI(M) after the CPI(M) Burdwan plenum in April 1968. When APCCCR split from CPI(M) 11 of 14 district committees of CPI(M) in Andhra Pradesh sided with APCCCR. Around 60% of the CPI(M) membership in the state, 8000 people (according to an estimate made by CPI(M) leader P. Sundarayya), went over to the T. Nagi Reddy group. They were also able to win over the CPI(M) publication Janashakti. APCCCR was affiliated to the All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries (AICCCR), but the group got expelled due to political differences. APCCCR advocated a mass line, whereas AICCCR denounced work in trade unions as \\"economism\\". APCCCR saw the issue of participating or boycotting elections as a tactical issue, whereas AICCCR saw as a strategic one. AICCCR accused APCCCR of lack of loyalty towards the Communist Party of China. After the expulsion of APCCCR from AICCCR, AICCCR rapidly reorganized an Andhra branch, mainly drawing support from the Srikakulam region. The Srikakulam District Committee of APCCCR joined Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) (CPI(ML)). APCCCR launched limited armed struggles in Warangal, Khammam, Karimnagar, Nalgonda, East Godavari, etc.. APCCCR favoured combining mass movements and armed struggle, and opposed the annihilation line of CPI(ML). In April 1969 APCCCR issued a resolution called \\"Boycott Panchayat Elections - Establishing Village Soviets\\". In December 1969 six out nine State Committee members of APCCCR were arrested at a hotel in Madras, among them T. Nagi Reddy and D.V. Rao. The arrests were a heavy blow for the organization. In July 1970 a new state committee led by Chandra Pulla Reddy was created. APCCCR was later renamed as Andhra Pradesh Committee of Communist Revolutionaries (alt. Andhra Pradesh Revolutionary Communist Committee). In 1971 APCCR suffered a severe split, with the Chandra Pulla Reddy-led group leaving the party. This group also used the name APCCR. This group merged with the Provisional Central Committee, Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) of Satayanarayan Singh in 1973. In 1975 APCCR formed Unity Centre of Communist Revolutionaries of India (Marxist-Leninist) together with Northern Zone Committee Revolutionary Communist Unity Centre (Marxist- Leninist), West Bengal Communist Unity Centre and West Bengal Co-ordination Committee of Revolutionaries (WBCCR).

The magazine was published from 1991 and 1995. The first eight issues each came on a single floppy disk, but as the magazine became more popular and more articles were submitted by its readers, it required two to three disks per issue after that point. The editor of Grapevine was known as Parasite, later PaZZa/LSD. Several co editors helped with the magazine under pazzas guidance, Scud/lsd, Torch/lsd and KenD/lsd ,The magazine was originally coded by Monty Python, and then re-coded with a mouse driven interface later in the series by Shagratt, Fish/lsd,watchman/lsd and other artists regularly made custom art covers for the magazines title page. Echo/lsd (graham gray/spoon wizard) and Mub/lsd wrote original music for the background also Grapevine existed at a time when Internet use was not widespread in its native UK or abroad, and hence editions of the magazine were hotly traded amongst the demo scene. LSD sent out hundreds of floppy disk copies on each release, and most PD libraries at the time were keen to include the latest issues as soon as they were released. As a result of this, 17Bit PD library cut a deal with PaZZa to ensure distribution at a fair price, they were \\"paid\\" a box of 50 floppy disks per issue for this, which were used by LSD for file distribution (the days before modems for many people).

Breadth of topics  Grapevine accepted articles from any one and about any thing which resulted in the quality of the magazine being truly unique.

However, this was done unofficially by a group not connected to the original, known as Ellesdee. The usage of the original disk magazine's name, as well as Ellesdee being a corruption of the original creator's name (LSD), brought strong criticism from other members of the demo scene, including the original team.Scene.org Some original LSD members were approached for permission to start the revival project and the first issues contained submissions from KenD/LSD. The revival web site, as well as that of Ellesdee, was subsequently shut down. The exact reasons for this are in dispute.

His magnum opus was a Sanskrit-German dictionary. Biography He was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia. His German ancestors migrated to Russia from L√ºbeck in 1713. Having studied (1833‚Äì1835) Oriental languages, particularly Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit, at the University of Saint Petersburg, he continued his studies in Germany, first in Berlin and then (1839‚Äì1842) in Bonn. Returning to Saint Petersburg in 1842, he was attached to the Royal Academy of Sciences, and was elected an ordinary member of that society in 1855. In 1860 he was made Russian state councillor, and later privy councillor with a title of nobility. In 1868 he settled at Jena, and in 1885 moved to Leipzig, where he resided until his death. Scholarship B√∂htlingk was one of the most distinguished scholars of the nineteenth century, and his works are of pre-eminent value in the field of Indian and comparative philology. His first great work was a translation of the Sanskrit grammar of Panini, , with a German commentary, under the title Acht B√ºcher grammatischer Regeln (Bonn, 1839‚Äì1840). This was in reality a criticism of Franz Bopp's philological methods. This work was followed by: *Vopadevas Grammatik (Saint Petersburg, 1847) *√úber die Sprache der Jakuten (Saint Petersburg, 1851) *Indische Spr√ºche, a series of Sanskrit apothegms and proverbial verses (2nd ed. in 3 parts, Saint Petersburg, 1870‚Äì1873, to which an index was published by Blau, Leipzig, 1893) *a critical examination and translation of Chandogya-upanishad (Saint Petersburg, 1889) *a translation of Brihad-Aranyaka-upanishad (Saint Petersburg, 1889) His magnum opus was his great Sanskrit-German dictionary, Sanskrit-W√∂rterbuch (7 vols., Saint Petersburg, 1853‚Äì1875; shortened ed. (without citations) 7 vols, Saint Petersburg, 1879‚Äì1889), which with the assistance of his two friends, Rudolf Roth (d. 1895) and Albrecht Weber (b. 1825), was completed in 23 years. He also published several smaller treatises, notably one on Vedic accent, √úber den Accent im Sanskrit (1843). Also notable are his Sanskrit-Chrestomathie (Saint Petersburg, 1845; 2d ed., 1877‚Äì97), and an edition with translation of a treatise on Hindu poetics by Da·πá·∏çin, KƒÅvyƒÅdar≈õa (Leipzig, 1890). B√∂htlingk took up Panini's grammar again, 47 years after his first edition, when he republished it with a complete translation under the title Panini's Grammatik mit √úbersetzung (Leipzig, 1887). It has been suggested that, during the 1860s, B√∂htlingk pointed out the periodic nature of the Sanskrit alphabet to the Russian chemist Dmitry Mendeleev and thereby helped him in the formulation of the periodic table. According to this suggestion, Mendeleev's use of the prefixes eka, dvi, and tri (Sanskrit for one, two, and three) to name as yet undiscovered chemists elements may be viewed as an homage to Sanskrit grammar and to the Sanskrit grammarian PƒÅ·πáini.

The Ari√®s was a French automobile manufactured by La Soci√©t√© des Automobile Ari√®s in Asni√®res-sur-Seine. The firm was founded in 1902 by Baron Charles Petiet. The decision to end production was taken in 1937. Around 20,000 vehicles were produced in total. The first cars were two- and four-cylinder vehicles built 20 chassis at a time in a large factory. These shaft-drive cars had a rather unusual double rear axle, while the engines were built by Aster. In 1907 the company made its own narrow-angle V4 engine with desmodromic valves. The engine had a single cast iron T-head monobloc on a light alloy crankcase. This contained four cylinders in a square layout with a narrow 15¬∞ vee angle. Bore and stroke were 60 by 100mm, giving a capacity of 1.13 litres. It was rated at 8/10 fiscal horsepower. The crankshaft was short with disk webs, two main bearings and fork-and-blade connecting rods. Crankpins and main journals were held in the webs by tapers and a shallow nut, giving the effect of an undercut crankshaft. This made the engine extremely compact overall, long, wide and tall. The intention was to offer this compact engine as a replacement that would fit into a wide range of other vehicles. The crankshaft was drilled for a pressure oil feed to the crankpins, an advanced feature for this time, but the pistons and gudgeon pins were still lubricated by splash. In 1910 Ari√®s introduced a V6 engine on the same pattern for the 10/14 hp S6. Ari√®s omnibus in Prague, 1908 Ari√®s entered the field of commercial vehicle production in 1910, mainly for the purpose of supplying the French army; the works built mainly military trucks during World War I, as well as Hispano-Suiza aero engines. After the war the company presented three new models; one was a four-cylinder, a 7 cv OHC 1085 cc, while the other two were variations on a 15cv 3-litre. One had a sidevalve Aster unit, while the second featured a sporty OHC engine; some of these last were quite successful in racing events. 1932 Aries Berline, 4 Places Ari√®s had some motor-racing success in the 1920s, particularly with associated, although without success, at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and with more success in other touring car events. Their most successful drivers wore Robert Laly and Jean Chassagne, driving the 3 litre cars. Ari√®s stopped production of its 1100 cc and 3-liter cars, which had become obsolete, during the financial crisis of the 1930s. They were replaced in the catalogue with new 1500 cc and 2-liter models with an odd arrangement of a three-speed gearbox augmented by two-speed gears in the back axle, for a total of six speeds forward. Named the Super 10-50, few were made. After the war, Ari√®s attempted a comeback, briefly producing moped engines under the name ABG. See also * Arthur Duray, raced Ari√®s cars in the late 1920s.

The party initially received support from both socialists and conservative trade unionists, and succeeded in electing Arthur Puttee to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1900 federal election.

It is the largest water reclamation project in the United States, supplying irrigation water to over of the large project area, all of which was originally intended to be supplied and is still classified as irrigable and open for the possible enlargement of the system. Water pumped from the Columbia River is carried over of main canals, stored in a number of reservoirs, then fed into of lateral irrigation canals, and out into of drains and wasteways. The Grand Coulee Dam, powerplant, and various other parts of the CBP are operated by the Bureau of Reclamation. There are three irrigation districts (the Quincy-Columbia Basin Irrigation District, the East Columbia Basin Irrigation District, and the South Columbia Basin Irrigation District) in the project area, which operate additional local facilities. History The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation was created in 1902 to aid development of dry western states. Central Washington's Columbia Plateau was a prime candidate--a desert with fertile loess soil and the Columbia River passing through. Competing groups lobbied for different irrigation projects; a Spokane group wanted a gravity flow canal from Lake Pend Oreille while a Wenatchee group (further south) wanted a large dam on the Columbia River, which would pump water up to fill the nearby Grand Coulee, a formerly-dry canyon-like coulee. After thirteen years of debate, President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the dam project with National Industrial Recovery Act money. (It was later specifically authorized by the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1935, and then reauthorized by the Columbia Basin Project Act of 1943 which put it under the Reclamation Project Act of 1939.) Construction of Grand Coulee Dam began in 1933 and was completed in 1942. Its main purpose of pumping water for irrigation was postponed during World War II in favor of electrical power generation that was used for the war effort. Additional hydroelectric generating capacity was added into the 1970s. The Columbia River reservoir behind the dam was named Franklin Delano Roosevelt Lake in honor of the president. The irrigation holding reservoir in Grand Coulee was named Banks Lake. After World War II the project suffered a number of setbacks. Irrigation water began to arrive between 1948 and 1952, but the costs escalated, resulting in the original plan, in which the people receiving irrigation water would pay back the costs of the project over time, being repeatedly revised and becoming a permanent water subsidy. In addition, the original vision of a social engineering project intended to help farmers settle on small landholdings failed. Farm plots, at first restricted in size, became larger and soon became corporate agribusiness operations. The original plan was that a federal agency similar to the Tennessee Valley Authority would manage the entire system. Instead, conflicts between the Bureau of Reclamation and the Department of Agriculture thwarted the goal of both agencies of settling the project area with small family farms; larger corporate farms arose instead. The determination to finish the project's plan to irrigate the full waned during the 1960s. The estimated total cost for completing the project had more than doubled between 1940 and 1964, it had become clear that the government's financial investment would not be recovered, and that the benefits of the project were unevenly distributed and increasingly going to larger businesses and corporations. These issues and others dampened enthusiasm for the project, although the exact motives behind the decision to stop construction with the project about half finished are not known. Geology Drumheller Channels, 10 miles (16 km) south of Potholes Reservoir, are examples of channeled scablands The Columbia Basin in Central Washington is fertile due to its loess soils, but large portions are a near desert, receiving less than ten inches (254 mm) of rain per year. The area is characterized by huge deposits of flood basalt, thousands of feet thick in places, laid down over a period of approximately 11 million years, during the Miocene epoch.Orr (1996), pg. 288. These flood basalts are exposed in some places, while in others they are covered with thick layers of loess. During the last ice age glaciers shaped the landscape of the Columbia River Plateau. Ice blocked the Columbia River near the north end of Grand Coulee, creating glacial lakes Columbia and Spokane. Ice age glaciers also created Glacial Lake Missoula, in what is now Montana. Erosion allowed glacial Lake Columbia to begin to drain into what became Grand Coulee, which was fully created when glacial Lake Missoula along with glacial Lake Columbia catastrophically emptied.Orr (1996), pg. 305. This flood event was one of several known as the Missoula Floods. Unique erosion features, called channeled scablands, are attributed to these amazing floods.

The reversible pump-turbines are used to move water from Lake Roosevelt into Banks Lake, from which it can be either sent south into the Columbia Basin Irrigation system or returned to Lake Roosevelt by the generating pumps to create additional electricity for the grid. =Feeder Canal, North and Dry Falls Dams, Banks Lake= *Banks Lake (1951) is an artificial impoundment in the Upper Grand Coulee.

The reservoir is long and wide. *Potholes Reservoir Irrigation of the Columbia Basin When it was built, Grand Coulee Dam was the largest dam in the world, but it was only part of the irrigation project. Additional dams were built at the north and south ends of Grand Coulee, the dry canyon south of Grand Coulee Dam, allowing the coulee to be filled with water pumped up from the Columbia River. The resulting reservoir, called Banks Lake, is about long. Banks Lake serves as the CBP's initial storage reservoir. Additional canals, siphons, and reservoirs were built south of Bank Lake, reaching over . Water is lifted from Lake Roosevelt to feed the massive network. The total amount of the Columbia flow that is diverted into the CBP at Grand Coulee varies a little from year to year, and is currently about 3.0 million acre-feet. This is about 3.8 percent of the Columbia's average flow as measured at the Grand Coulee dam. This amount is larger than the combined annual flows of the nearby Yakima,https://pubs.usgs.gov/wdr/2005/wdr- wa-05-1/pdf/wa00103ADR2005_Figure60.pdf Wenatchee,https://pubs.usgs.gov/wdr/2005/wdr- wa-05-1/pdf/wa00103ADR2005_Figure56.pdf and Okanoganhttps://pubs.usgs.gov/wdr/2005/wdr- wa-05-1/pdf/wa00103ADR2005_Figure52.pdf rivers. There were plans to double the area of irrigated land, according to tour guides at the dam, over the next several decades. However, the Bureau of Reclamation website states that no further development is anticipated, with irrigated out of the original planned.Bureau of Reclamation website Interest in completing the Columbia Basin Project's has grown in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. One reason for the renewed interest is the substantial depletion of the Odessa aquifer. Agricultural operations within the CBP's boundaries but outside the developed portion have for decades used groundwater pumped from the Odessa aquifer to irrigate crops. Unintended consequences Hydroelectricity was not the primary goal of the project, but during World War II the demand for electricity in the region boomed. The Hanford nuclear reservation was built just south of the project and aluminum smelting plants flocked to the Columbia Basin. A new power house was built at the Grand Coulee Dam, starting in the late sixties, that tripled the generating capacity. Part of the dam had to be blown up and re-built to make way for the new generators. Electricity is now transmitted to Canada and as far south as San Diego. There are a number of issues regarding the runoff of irrigation water. The project region receives about 6 to of annual rainfall, while the application of irrigation water amounts to an equivalent 40 to . The original plans did not sufficiently address the inevitable seepage and runoff. In some cases the results are beneficial. For example, numerous new lakes provide recreation opportunities and habitat for fish and game. In other cases agricultural chemicals in the runoff cause pollution. Environmental impact One environmental impact has been the reduction in native fish stocks above the dams. The majority of fish in the Columbia basin are migratory fish like salmon, sturgeon and steelhead. These migratory fish are often harmed or unable to pass through the narrow passages and turbines at dams. In addition to the physical barriers the dams pose, the slowing speed and altered course of the river raises temperatures, alters oxygen content, and changes river bed conditions. These altered conditions can stress and potentially kill both migratory and local non- migratory organisms in the river. The decimation of these migratory fish stocks above Grand Coulee Dam would not allow the former fishing lifestyle of Native Americans of the area, who once depended on the salmon for a way of life. The environmental impacts of the Columbia Basin Project have made it a contentious and often politicized issue. A common argument for not implementing environmental safeguards at dam sites is that post-construction modifications would likely have to be significant. Tour guides at the Grand Coulee dam site, for example, indicate that a \\"fish ladder might have to be long to get the fish up the needed, and many fish would die before reaching the upper end\\" thus no fish ladders were built. Advocates of remedial measures point out that such steps would still be better than the status quo, which has led to marked die-offs and the likely extinctionNWFS 2003 Update Summary, p.5 of several types of salmon. The irrigation water provided by this project greatly benefits the agricultural production of the area. North Central Washington is one of the largest and most productive tree fruit producing areas on the planet. Without Coulee Dam and the greater Columbia Basin Project, much of North Central Washington State would be too arid for cultivation. Economic benefits and costs According to the federal Bureau of Reclamation the yearly value of the Columbia Basin Project is $630 million in irrigated crops, $950 million in power production, $20 million in flood damage prevention, and $50 million in recreation. The project itself involves costs that are difficult to determine. The farms that receive irrigation water must pay for it, but due to insufficient data from the Bureau of Reclamation it is not possible to compare the total cost paid by the Bureau to the payments received. Nevertheless, the farm payments account for only a small fraction of the total cost to the government, resulting in the project's agricultural corporations receiving a large water subsidy from the government. Critics describe the CBP as a classical example of federal money being used to subsidize a relatively small group of farmers in the American West in places where it would never be economically viable under other circumstances.

Background The firm had been founded in the late 1940s by Antonio Monge and Robert Rowe under the name Callista, but the two fell out over the future direction of the firm after its original project, a sporting model called the \\"Coupe des Alpes\\" first seen in prototype form at the 1950 Paris Motor Show, appeared likely to be severely undercut on price when Panhard themselves launched their Panhard Dyna Junior with a comparable level of performance at a far lower price than Callista could achieve with their elegant low volume cars. Monge resolved to return to his former occupation, preparing cars for motor sport events. Shortly after this setback Rowe, who had previously worked as an electrical engineer with the Fulmen business, but who also engaged in other trading activities, suddenly found himself financially ruined after he imported to France several hundred Romanian tractors that turned out to be defective. At the end of 1952 both the firms founding partners, for their own different reasons, withdrew from the project.Callista et Arista L'Arista Le Mans A new name and a new strategy The enterprise was rescued by Raymond Gaillard, also known in the automotive world as a regular competitor in the Le Mans 24 Hour race. Up to this point Gaillard had figured in the Callista business only as a substantial investor and potential sales distributor for the \\"Coupe des Alpes\\" model. Gaillard rescued the residual elements of the business and refounded it under the new name of Arista. From now on the firm concentrated on a smaller lighter and presumably cheaper model called the \\"Arista Ranelagh\\". The Ranelagh names came from the (then as now) fashionable Paris street, Rue du Ranelagh where Gaillard owned a Panhard dealership. Again based on the mechanical components from the Panhard Dyna X, the car was a low cabriolet with long overhangs at each end, reflected in the difference between the 2130 mm wheelbase and the 4100 mm overall length of the cabriolet model. There was a shorter roadster of only 3620 mm in length. The car weighed only 550/640 kg and a top speed of between 135 and 140 km/h (between 84 and 87 mph) was claimed. Both the light weight and the front-wheel-drive layout were determined by the car's Panhard underpinnings. About 100 were made. 1956 saw the arrival of the Arista Passy, powered by the 42 CV 848 cc engine from the Panhard PL17, and still listed in 1962. A model with the 50 CV \\"Tigre\\" engine was sold as the Arista Sport, although the weight savings over a regular PL17 was only about due to the car's ample equipment. The little Arista coup√©, though stylish, had by now become extremely expensive for a car of this engine size and performance. Sales seem to have slowed to a trickle. Other Arista designs appeared from time to time, but it is not clear if any others made it to production. Arista had disappeared from view by 1963, although the same business was later involved in making the Sovam sports car. References * Harald H.

He is known as the immortal of the Northern Song dynasty (960‚Äì1127), and may have been a historical figure of the period. Jur≈çjin is identified as the personification of the Southern Polar Star. While paintings and statues of Jur≈çjin are considered auspicious, he never developed a following independent of the other deities Seven Gods of Fortune. Jur≈çjin is often identified with Fukurokuju, another of the Several Gods of Fortune. In some accounts, the two are said to inhabit the same body. As such, the two are often confused. Jur≈çjin walks with a staff and a fan. He is depicted as an old man of slight stature, and by tradition, less than 3 shaku (approximately ). He is depicted with a long white beard and often a very tall, bald head. He has a scroll tied to his staff, on which is written the lifespan of all living things. The scroll is sometimes identified as a Buddhist sutra. The deer, a symbol of longevity, usually (but not always) accompanies him as a messenger, as do other long-lived animals such as the crane and the tortoise. Jur≈çjin is a popular subject of Japanese ink wash paintings. He was introduced into the Japanese art tradition by Zen Buddhist painters, and depictions of Jur≈çjin span from the Muromachi period (1337‚Äì1573) through the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868). Artists who depicted Jur≈çjin as a subject include Sessh≈´ (1420‚Äì1506), Sesson Shukei (1504‚Äì1589), Kan≈ç Tan'y≈´ (1602‚Äì1674), and Maruyama ≈åkyo (1733‚Äì1795).

The first model was a two-seater called Arkley SS, designed by John Britten in 1970 (not to be confused with the famous New Zealand motorcycle designer, John Britten). The retro \\"bug-eyed\\" design was inspired by a mixture of the Morgan and the original Austin-Healey Sprite. The main purpose was recycling old rusty or damaged Austin-Healey Sprites or MG Midgets. The Arkley SS utilised a BMC A-Series engine launched by Austin in 1951. The Arkley Midget used fibre glass front and rear ends fitted to the donor car. Transformation did not affect the main structural members. There were two versions, the S for standard wheels and the SS for wide wheels. Peter May, who had worked with John Britten Garages, founded Peter May Engineering in Halesowen in 1979 and bought the manufacturing rights to the Arkley in 1987. Production continued via Peter May Engineering until 1995, in the form of DIY kits. Since 1971, around 1000 kits have been sold, but the surviving number today is unknown. Some kits were modified, such as a one-off called Pink Bathtub, produced in 1990.

The first of these was set up by British trade unionists in 1895, and collapsed soon thereafter. The second was created in 1906, following a visit to the city from Ramsay MacDonald. The party received support from members of Arthur Puttee's Winnipeg Labour Party, which had been moribund since 1904. Like other groups of the same name, this Independent Labour Party was a reformist organization. It was opposed by members of the more radical Socialist Party of Canada. The ILP nominated Kempton McKim to contest the riding of Winnipeg West in the provincial election of 1907. McKim called for labour standards legislation and the public ownership of utilities. He was defeated by Thomas Johnson, a popular figure from the left wing of the Liberal Party. In 1908, some members agitated for the ILP to officially declare itself as socialist. They were opposed by another group, led by moderate reformer Fred Dixon (later a member of the provincial legislature). The controversy split the party, which ceased to exist as a viable organization after June 1908. The reformist faction of the ILP regrouped as the Manitoba Labour Party for the 1910 provincial election. In 1914-15, candidates nominated by the Labour Representation Committee officially ran for the \\"Independent Labor Party\\", even though no formal organization of that name seems to have existed at the time.

It has been theorized that he is a Japanese assimilation of the Chinese Three Star Gods (Fulushou) embodied in one deity. Most related in appearance to the Chinese star god Shou, he is the God of wisdom and longevity. According to some, before attaining divinity, he was a Chinese hermit of the Song Dynasty and a reincarnation of the Taoist god Xuanwu. It is said that during his human incarnation, he was a sennin; a philosopher who could exist without eating food. Fukurokuju probably originated from an old Chinese tale about a mythical Chinese Taoist hermit sage renowned for performing miracles in the Northern Song period (960‚Äì1127). In China, this hermit (also known as Jur≈çjin) was thought to embody the celestial powers of the south polar star. Fukurokuju was not always included in the earliest representations of the Seven in Japan. He was instead replaced by Kichij≈çten (goddess of fortune, beauty, and merit). He is now, however, an established member of the Seven Lucky Gods. He is sometimes confused with Jur≈çjin, another of the Several Gods of Fortune, who by some accounts is Fukurokuju's grandson and by other accounts inhabits the same body as Fukurokuju. As such, the two are often confused. Fukurokuju is usually portrayed as bald with long whiskers and an elongated forehead. He is said to be an incarnation of the Southern Polestar. The sacred book tied to his staff either contains the lifespan of every person on earth or a magical scripture. He is accompanied by a crane and a turtle, which are considered to be symbols of longevity. He is also sometimes accompanied by a black deer (ancient legends say a deer turns black if it is over 2000 years old).

He is the warlord and ruler of the extra-dimensional world of Polemachus. The conceit of the character is that he is a hero from the sword- and-sorcery genre, in a world of modern superheroes. Publication history Arkon first appeared in The Avengers #75 (April 1970), and was created by Roy Thomas and John Buscema. Fictional character biography Arkon was born of noble lineage on the extra-dimensional world Polemachus. The people of the Realm of Polemachus developed a culture that glorifies warfare, and Arkon succeeded in becoming the greatest warrior of his people. Appointed Imperion (ruler) of the largest country on Polemachus, Arkon mounted military campaigns against neighboring countries in an effort to conquer the world. His dreams were forgotten when Polemachus was faced with a worldwide catastrophe in that the light-and heat-providing planetary rings were disintegrating. Arkon's scientists determined that atomic explosions occurring on Earth somehow were extra-dimensionally translated to rekindle the energy rings for about a year. Although Polemachus had not developed nuclear weaponry, the scientists predicted that if they were to atomically annihilate the Earth, their world's energy-rings would be restored to power. Toward this goal, Arkon manipulated the hero known as the Scarlet Witch into reciting a magical spell found in a Polemachian book to enable Arkon to transport himself to Earth. Attracted to the Scarlet Witch and intending to marry her, Arkon kidnapped her as well as a group of atomic scientists. The scientists were forced to construct an atomic device. Before Arkon could detonate it on Earth, however, Scarlet Witch's super team, the Avengers battled Arkon. Iron Man and Thor managed to rekindle Polemachus' energy-rings via a super device devised by Stark, and Arkon ceased hostilities with Earth.Avengers #75-76 The Avengers had cause to revisit Arkon's world when their comrade, the Black Knight, was taken captive by Arkon while searching for the Well at the Center of Time. Arkon ceased hostilities with the Avengers when he learned that he was being duped by the Asgardian Amora the Enchantress, and later reconciled with the Avengers.Avengers #84 Although his world now possessed the capacity for atomic weapons, Arkon was dissatisfied with the length of time it took to build a nuclear arsenal. Thus, he devised a plan to pit three extra-dimensional worlds, one of which was Earth, against one another, in hopes that the energy from the resultant nuclear conflagration could be absorbed by his world. His elaborate machinations failed, due to the efforts of the Fantastic Four.Fantastic Four #160, 162-163 Arkon was forced to return to Earth yet again when the machine that Iron Man had once built to rekindle Polemachus' rings failed due to Arkon's tinkering with it. Arkon traveled to Earth to recruit Thor to recharge the machine, but since Thor had left the Avengers at that time, he settled for the mutant X-Man known as Storm, who also had the ability to summon lightning, forcing her teammates to go after them. After a monumental struggle, the conflict was settled amicably. Storm through Cyclops' optic blasts helped re- energize the Energy Ring, and Arkon returned Storm and her allies to Earth.X-Men Annual #3 Another time, the X-Men and the Fantastic Four helped Arkon drive off an extra-dimensional invasion of Polemachus by the alien race of Badoon.Uncanny X-Men Annual #5 Arkon was later prodded via a dream- suggestion to return to Earth because a Hollywood movie had been made about him. This subliminal coaxing was from Amora the Enchantress. She had been given the task of killing Doctor Strange during the \\"Acts of Vengeance\\" campaign (where all the major villains teamed up and tried to see if \\"swapping\\" foes would result in the defeat of their heroic enemies). Arkon fought Wonder Man to punish him for appearing in the \\"Arkon\\" movies, and told him to warn the studio not to make any more.West Coast Avengers #31 The Enchantress tricks Arkon into battling Dr Strange, but with the help of Clea, they are able to defeat her.Doctor Strange Vol. 3 #12-13 Some time later, Arkon traveled to Earth to employ the Avengers West Coast and Fantastic Four as pawns in his war with rival otherworldly monarch Thundra, until he made peace with Thundra after realizing they shared a strong mutual attraction.Avengers West Coast #75 Later, with Thundra as his consort, Arkon sought Avengers' aid in repairing Polemachus' energy ring and protecting the maiden Astra from becoming a human sacrifice to Polemachus' religious zealots led by the high priest Anskar.Avengers #358-359 During the Secret Wars storyline, Arkon finds himself on the Battleworld domain of Weirdworld. After many failed attempts to find his kingdom Polemachus, Arkon finally arrived at the end of the Weirdworld and discovered it was a floating island. He was ready to step off the cliff to meet his fate on the ground below when an uncontrolled dragon appeared from nowhere. Seeing this as his opportunity to finally find his kingdom, Arkon stole the beast from the ogres that tried to control it and rode it through Weirdworld's sky only to be caught by apes who used a strange fish and a line to fish the dragon out of the sky to the bottom of the sea.Weirdworld #1 Imprisoned alone in a cell with his hands bound, Arkon resorts to brute force running headfirst into the walls to escape his captivity in Apelantis. While it doesn‚Äôt result in his escape, Arkon‚Äôs actions attract the attention of a crystalline being named Warbow. Warbow explains to Arkon that while he has been able to escape the prison on his own, he is always recaptured by the underwater apes before he could reach the surface of the lagoon. Warbow offers to assist Arkon in escaping in the hopes that they both can manage it together and save his captive prince Crystar where they find his pieces in a bag. As Arkon fights off the underwater apes, he dreams of the home he seeks to return to. As he describes the world, he comes to the sad realization that he is losing his memory of his home.Weirdworld #2 After reaching a safe place, Warbow gave Arkon his map as he had promised. But to Arkon's surprise, it had many places he hadn't ever seen in his journey through Weirdworld. Enraged, Arkon left Warbow behind and continued his quest for Polemachus. Lost, Arkon ended up in the \\"Swayin' Saloon\\" where Skull the Slayer was waiting for him. While drinking, Skull the Slayer revealed to Arkon that he was sent by Morgan le Fay to kill him and both started to fight. In a failed attempt of killing himself as well as his enemy, Arkon cut the ropes that kept the saloon suspended and they fell into the swamp below. When Arkon regained consciousness after the fall, he found himself trapped in vines and surrounded by the Man-Things.Weirdworld #3 Arkon began to hallucinate about seeing Polemachus upside down when Skull freed him from the vines by attacking him fiercely. Arkon managed to get one of his Battle-Bolts and overcame his enemy. Before he could kill him, he was immobilized by the burning touch of one of the Man-Things. This time, Arkon hallucinated about his worst fear....Polemachus burning in front of his eyes. The hallucination ended with the arrival of the Swamp Queen of the Man-Things, a version of Jennifer Kale who is behind the rebellion against Morgan le Fay. After a brief conversation with the two warriors, the Swamp Queen forced them to face their fears in order to survive it and become her allies against le Fay. However, only Skull accepted the offer to become her ally. Arkon fled from the Forest of the Man- Things having remembered the path which led to Polemachus. Upon reaching the rock that was supposed to be the entrance to his kingdom, Arkon found himself yet again in front of a cliff at the end of Weirdworld. Filled with sadness and rage, Arkon pointed one of his Battle-Bolts towards his own belly ready to kill himself, unknowing that Polemachus was in fact in Weirdworld, suspended upside down as the underside of the floating island.Weirdworld #4 At the last minute, Arkon gave up on killing himself preferring to use his rage to conquer Weirdworld in order to turn it into his new kingdom instead. He was confronted by the Witch Queen le Fay and her army of ogres. Having been hit by a missile launched by the ogres, Arkon fell from Weirdworld and finally saw his kingdom under it before being saved from certain death by the Swamp Queen and her Man- Things who were accompanied by an army composed of the other inhabitants of Weirdworld including Skull the Slayer, Warbow, an army of Elves, an army of Eyemazons, an army of Man-Wolves, and the resurrected Crystar. A fierce battle ensued between the Swamp Queen's forces and le Fay's forces for the fate of Weirdworld. However, none of them emerged victorious as Battleworld collapsed after God Emperor Doom was defeated during the Secret War. With Weirdworld now a part of Earth-616 and located in the Bermuda Triangle, Arkon resumed his journey to find Polemachus.Weirdworld #5 As part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel event, Arkon is still searching for Polemachus and comes across the survivors of the airplane that crash-landed onto Weirdworld upon going through the Bermuda Triangle. He saves them and tells them that they need to get away from the plane wreck.Weirdworld Vol. 2 #1 When Arkon was sighted on Earth, Thundra and Tyndall arrived to look for help in finding him.Squadron Supreme Vol. 4 #1 Their search for Arkon was interrupted by the arrival of Warbow and his Crystal Warriors, the Magma Men, and the Savage Elves of Klarn as Thundra tells Tyndall to find the Squadron Supreme.Squadron Supreme Vol. 4 #2 When the Squadron Supreme, Tyndall, and Thundra end up on Weirdworld, they are ambushed by Arkon.Squadron Supreme Vol. 4 #3 It was discovered that Arkon has been possessed by an evil madness as he assists Modred and Warrior Woman into taking down Nighthawk, Blur, and Tyndall. When the three of them bring Nighthawk, Blur, and Tyndall to a specific castle, they find it inhabited by a revived Doctor Druid.Squadron Supreme Vol. 4 #4 Powers and abilities Arkon possesses a variety of superhuman abilities including great superhuman strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, and durability. Arkon also possesses an accelerated healing factor enabling him to rapidly heal damaged tissue should he sustain injury. While all of his people possess these same physical attributes, Arkon's are much more developed than the majority of his race. Arkon is a cunning military strategist. He is an extraordinary hand-to- hand combatant and swordsman, and is highly skilled in the usage of his throwing weapons, which were designed by the scientists and craftsmen of Polemachus. Arkon wields a collection of three energy weapons shaped like stylized lightning bolts that he carries in a quiver. Each of these bolts has a specific function and color. The golden bolts are used to open gateways to different dimensional planes. The scarlet and black bolts are used as offensive weapons and generate powerful explosive blasts when they hit their target. He also carries a shield. Arkon has been known to ride dinosaur-like reptilian mounts, some of which walk on two legs and others on four. Other reptilian mounts he uses have wings enabling them to carry him through the air. Other versions =JLA/Avengers= Arkon, Thundra, and all of Polemachus were last seen being wiped out by Krona during the JLA/Avengers crossover miniseries. However, since this took place in an intercompany crossover story, Arkon, Thundra, and Polemachus itself were all restored to normal when the miniseries ended.JLA/Avengers #4 This is further evidenced by Thundra's subsequent appearances in the Marvel Universe since the miniseries ended. =Earth-65= In this universe, Arkon is a character in a tabletop roleplaying game.Spider-Gwen (Vol. 2) #4 In other media =Television= Arkon as depicted in X-Men: The Animated Series * Arkon appeared in the two- part X-Men episode \\"Storm Front\\", voiced by Paul Haddad.http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Marvel-Universe/Arkon/ In the series, Arkon unleashes terrible weather conditions over Washington, D.C. to get Storm's attention. When she arrives to quell the weather, he begs her to return with him to his planet Polemachus to save it from meteorological chaos which threatens his people. Storm agrees to come, but both intrigued by this dynamic leader and slightly suspicious, she leaves a clue for the other X-Men to follow. Once Storm saves the planet she is proclaimed savior of Polemachus and Arkon asks her to marry him. She leaves him after learning that his ships are bringing thousands of slaves from nearby planets and knows that Arkon is a tyrant. * Arkon appears in the Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. episode \\"The Hunted\\",\\"Animated Surprise - Arkon to appear on Hulk and the Agents of SMASH ,\\" Superheroes R Us voiced by Liam O'Brien.

Vernacular architecture represents the majority of buildings and settlements created in pre-industrial societies and includes a very wide range of buildings, building traditions, and methods of construction. Vernacular buildings are typically simple and practical, whether residential houses or built for other purposes. Although it encompassed 95% of the world's built environment in 1969,Amos Rapoport, House Form and Culture (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1969), 2. vernacular architecture tends to be overlooked in traditional histories of design. It is not one specific style, so it cannot be distilled into a series of easy-to-digest patterns, materials, or elements.J. Philip Gruen, ‚ÄúVernacular Architecture,‚Äù in Encyclopedia of Local History, 3d edition, ed. Amy H. Wilson (Lanham, Maryland: Rowman & Littlefield, 2017): 697-98. Because of the usage of traditional building methods and local builders, vernacular buildings are considered part of a regional culture. Vernacular architecture can be contrasted against elite or polite architecture, which is characterized by stylistic elements of design intentionally incorporated for aesthetic purposes which go beyond a building's functional requirements. This article also covers the term traditional architecture, which exists somewhere between the two extremes yet still is based upon authentic themes.Holm, 2006 Etymology The term vernacular means \\"domestic, native, indigenous\\"; from verna, meaning \\"native slave\\" or \\"home-born slave\\". The word probably derives from an older Etruscan word. The term is borrowed from linguistics, where vernacular refers to language use particular to a time, place or group.Dictionary.com definitionCambridge advanced learner's dictionary definitionMerriam‚ÄìWebster definition Definitions Vernacular architecture is described as a built environment that is based upon local needs; defined by the availability of particular materials indigenous to its particular region; and reflects local traditions and cultural practices. Traditionally, the study of vernacular architecture did not examine formally schooled architects, but instead that of the design skills and tradition of local builders, who were rarely given any attribution for the work. More recently, vernacular architecture has been examined by designers and the building industry in an effort to be more energy conscious with contemporary design and construction‚Äîpart of a broader interest in sustainable design. The terms vernacular, folk, traditional, common, ordinary, and popular architecture are sometimes used interchangeably. However, Allen Noble wrote a lengthy discussion of these terms in Traditional Buildings: A Global Survey of Structural Forms and Cultural Functions where he presents scholarly opinions that folk building or folk architecture is built by \\"persons not professionally trained in building arts\\"; where vernacular architecture is still of the common people but may be built by trained professionals such as through an apprenticeship, but still using local, traditional designs and materials. Traditional architecture is architecture passed down from person to person, generation to generation, particularly orally, but at any level of society, not just by common people. Noble discourages use of the term primitive architecture as having a negative connotation.Noble, Allen George. Traditional buildings: a global survey of structural forms and cultural functions. London: I. B. Tauris, 2007. 1-17. Print..

Although vernacular architecture might be designed by people who do have some training in design, Ronald Brunskill has nonetheless defined vernacular architecture as: > ...a building designed by an amateur without any training in design; the > individual will have been guided by a series of conventions built up in his > locality, paying little attention to what may be fashionable. The function > of the building would be the dominant factor, aesthetic considerations, > though present to some small degree, being quite minimal. Local materials > would be used as a matter of course, other materials being chosen and > imported quite exceptionally. Vernacular architecture is not to be confused with so-called \\"traditional\\" architecture, though there are links between the two. Traditional architecture also includes buildings which bear elements of polite design: temples and palaces, for example, which normally would not be included under the rubric of \\"vernacular.\\" In architectural terms, 'the vernacular' can be contrasted with 'the polite', which is characterised by stylistic elements of design intentionally incorporated by a professional architect for aesthetic purposes which go beyond a building's functional requirements. Between the extremes of the wholly vernacular and the completely polite, examples occur which have some vernacular and some polite content, often making the differences between the vernacular and the polite a matter of degree. Dwelling of half-timbered construction on stone foundation, La Rioja, Spain The Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World defines vernacular architecture as: > ...comprising the dwellings and all other buildings of the people. Related > to their environmental contexts and available resources they are customarily > owner- or community-built, utilizing traditional technologies. All forms of > vernacular architecture are built to meet specific needs, accommodating the > values, economies and ways of life of the cultures that produce > them.Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World, volume 1, page > not cited Vernacular architecture is a broad, grassroots concept which encompasses fields of architectural study including aboriginal, indigenous, ancestral, rural, and ethnic architecturehttp://www.vernaculararchitecture.com/, a site which is part of http://www.ethnoarchitecture.org/ accessed 5/2/2013 and is contrasted with the more intellectual architecture called polite, formal, or academic architecture just as folk art is contrasted with fine art. William, after Brunskill, regards the 'Vernacular Zone' as being a range of buildings between two thresholds: the Vernacular and the Polite. These were below the Polite Threshold, but also had to be above the Vernacular Threshold. Buildings cruder than this did not survive, and so were not recorded. This was due to both their unimportance and the lack of attention paid to them, also to the insubstantial nature of their poor materials. A survey in the 1940s by Sir Cyril Fox and Lord Raglan examined 450 'old' cottages in Monmouthshire expected to date them to the medieval period. However careful study dated them to the late eighteenth century or later: 'cottages' earlier than this had simply not survived. Vernacular and the architect Architecture designed by professional architects is usually not considered to be vernacular. Indeed, it can be argued that the very process of consciously designing a building makes it not vernacular. Paul Oliver, in his book Dwellings, states: \\"...it is contended that 'popular architecture' designed by professional architects or commercial builders for popular use, does not come within the compass of the vernacular\\". Oliver also offers the following simple definition of vernacular architecture: \\"the architecture of the people, and by the people, but not for the people.\\" Frank Lloyd Wright described vernacular architecture as \\"Folk building growing in response to actual needs, fitted into environment by people who knew no better than to fit them with native feeling\\". suggesting that it is a primitive form of design, lacking intelligent thought, but he also stated that it was \\"for us better worth study than all the highly self- conscious academic attempts at the beautiful throughout Europe\\". A post-World War II dwelling at the Big Pasture Plateau, Slovenia, designed by the architect Vlasto Kopaƒç and based on the vernacular architecture of this mountainous area. Since at least the Arts and Crafts Movement, many modern architects have studied vernacular buildings and claimed to draw inspiration from them, including aspects of the vernacular in their designs. In 1946, the Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy was appointed to design the town of New Gourna near Luxor. Having studied traditional Nubian settlements and technologies, he incorporated the traditional mud brick vaults of the Nubian settlements in his designs. The experiment failed, due to a variety of social and economic reasons. In 1964, the exhibition Architecture Without Architects was put on at the Museum of Modern Art, New York by Bernard Rudofsky. Accompanied by a book of the same title, including black-and-white photography of vernacular buildings around the world, the exhibition was extremely popular. It was Rudofsky who first made use of the term vernacular in an architectural context, and brought the concept into the eye of the public and of mainstream architecture: \\"For want of a generic label we shall call it vernacular, anonymous, spontaneous, indigenous, rural, as the case may be.\\"Rudofsky, Architecture Without Architects, page 58 However, the range of studies about vernacular architecture since the book's publication suggests that Rudofsky's characterization was limiting and problematic; indeed, quite often vernacular architecture is not anonymous and designed in very intentional ways that are learned through generations of practice and based upon the availability of particular materials and profoundly affected by climate (and, thus, not \\"spontaneous.\\") Since the emergence of the term in the 1970s, vernacular considerations have played an increasing part in architectural designs, although individual architects had widely varying opinions of the merits of the vernacular. Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa is considered the pioneer of regional modernism in South Asia. Along with him, modern proponents of the use of the vernacular in architectural design include Charles Correa, a well known Indian architect; Muzharul Islam and Bashirul Haq, internationally known Bangladeshi architects; Balkrishna Doshi, another Indian, who established the Vastu-Shilpa Foundation in Ahmedabad to research the vernacular architecture of the region; and Sheila Sri Prakash who has used rural Indian architecture as an inspiration for innovations in environmental and socio-economically sustainable design and planning. The Dutch architect Aldo van Eyck was also a proponent of vernacular architecture. Architects whose work exemplifies the modern take on vernacular architecture would be Samuel Mockbee, Christopher Alexander and Paolo Soleri. Oliver claims that: > As yet there is no clearly defined and specialized discipline for the study > of dwellings or the larger compass of vernacular architecture. If such a > discipline were to emerge it would probably be one that combines some of the > elements of both architecture and anthropology with aspects of history and > geography. Architects have developed a renewed interest in vernacular architecture as a model for sustainable design.Forster, W., Heal, A. and Paradise, C., \\"The Vernacular as a Model for Sustainable Design\\" Chapter 14 in: W. Weber, S. Yannas, Lessons from Vernacular Architecture, Routledge, 2013 Contemporary complementary architecture is informed largely by vernacular architecture. Influences on the vernacular House in Brgule, Serbia Vernacular architecture is influenced by a great range of different aspects of human behaviour and environment, leading to differing building forms for almost every different context; even neighbouring villages may have subtly different approaches to the construction and use of their dwellings, even if they at first appear the same. Despite these variations, every building is subject to the same laws of physics, and hence will demonstrate significant similarities in structural forms. =Climate= One of the most significant influences on vernacular architecture is the macro climate of the area in which the building is constructed. Buildings in cold climates invariably have high thermal mass or significant amounts of insulation. They are usually sealed in order to prevent heat loss, and openings such as windows tend to be small or non- existent. Buildings in warm climates, by contrast, tend to be constructed of lighter materials and to allow significant cross-ventilation through openings in the fabric of the building. A log cabin in the region of Kysuce (Slovakia) - an example of vernacular architecture in relatively cold mountain climate using local materials (wood). Buildings for a continental climate must be able to cope with significant variations in temperature, and may even be altered by their occupants according to the seasons. In hot arid and semi-arid regions, vernacular structures typically include a number of distinctive elements to provide for ventilation and temperature control. Across the middle-east, these elements included such design features as courtyard gardens with water features, screen walls, reflected light, mashrabiya (the distinctive oriel window with timber lattice-work) and bad girs (wind-catchers). Queenslander, Australia Buildings take different forms depending on precipitation levels in the region ‚Äì leading to dwellings on stilts in many regions with frequent flooding or rainy monsoon seasons. For example, the Queenslander is an elevated weatherboard house with a sloped, tin roof that evolved in the early 19th-century as a solution to the annual flooding caused by monsoonal rain in Australia's northern states. Flat roofs are rare in areas with high levels of precipitation. Similarly, areas with high winds will lead to specialised buildings able to cope with them, and buildings tend to present minimal surface area to prevailing winds and are often situated low on the landscape to minimise potential storm damage. Climatic influences on vernacular architecture are substantial and can be extremely complex. Mediterranean vernacular, and that of much of the Middle East, often includes a courtyard with a fountain or pond; air cooled by water mist and evaporation is drawn through the building by the natural ventilation set up by the building form. Similarly, Northern African vernacular often has very high thermal mass and small windows to keep the occupants cool, and in many cases also includes chimneys, not for fires but to draw air through the internal spaces. Such specializations are not designed, but learned by trial and error over generations of building construction, often existing long before the scientific theories which explain why they work. Vernacular architecture is also used for the purposes of local citizens. =Culture= The way of life of building occupants, and the way they use their shelters, is of great influence on building forms. The size of family units, who shares which spaces, how food is prepared and eaten, how people interact and many other cultural considerations will affect the layout and size of dwellings. For example, the family units of several East African ethnic communities live in family compounds, surrounded by marked boundaries, in which separate single-roomed dwellings are built to house different members of the family. In polygamous communities there may be separate dwellings for different wives, and more again for sons who are too old to share space with the women of the family. Social interaction within the family is governed by, and privacy is provided by, the separation between the structures in which family members live. By contrast, in Western Europe, such separation is accomplished inside one dwelling, by dividing the building into separate rooms. Culture also has a great influence on the appearance of vernacular buildings, as occupants often decorate buildings in accordance with local customs and beliefs. Nomadic dwellings Stilt houses in Cempa, located in the Lingga Islands of Indonesia. A Yurt or ger, a circular dwelling from Mongolia, during erection There are many cultures around the world which include some aspect of nomadic life, and they have all developed vernacular solutions for the need for shelter. These all include appropriate responses to climate and customs of their inhabitants, including practicalities of simple construction such as huts, and if necessary, transport such as tents. The Inuit people have a number of different forms of shelter appropriate to different seasons and geographical locations, including the igloo (for winter) and the tupiq (for summer). The Sami of Northern Europe, who live in climates similar to those experienced by the Inuit, have developed different shelters appropriate to their culture including the lavvu and goahti. The development of different solutions in similar circumstances because of cultural influences is typical of vernacular architecture. Many nomadic people use materials common in the local environment to construct temporary dwellings, such as the Punan of Sarawak who use palm fronds, or the Ituri Pygmies who use saplings and mongongo leaves to construct domed huts. Other cultures reuse materials, transporting them with them as they move. Examples of this are the tribes of Mongolia, who carry their gers (yurts) with them, or the black desert tents of the Qashgai in Iran. Notable in each case is the significant impact of the availability of materials and the availability of pack animals or other forms of transport on the ultimate form of the shelters. All the shelters are adapted to suit the local climate. The Mongolian gers (yurts), for example, are versatile enough to be cool in hot continental summers and warm in the sub-zero temperatures of Mongolian winters, and include a close-able ventilation hole at the centre and a chimney for a stove. A ger is typically not often relocated, and is therefore sturdy and secure, including wooden front door and several layers of coverings. A traditional Berber tent, by contrast, might be relocated daily, and is much lighter and quicker to erect and dismantle ‚Äì and because of the climate it is used in, does not need to provide the same degree of protection from the elements.

File:Iraqi mudhif interior.jpgInterior of a mudhif; a reed dwelling used by Iraqi people of the marshlands Permanent dwellings A Southern African rondavel (or banda) The type of structure and materials used for a dwelling vary depending on how permanent it is. Frequently moved nomadic structures will be lightweight and simple, more permanent ones will be less so. When people settle somewhere permanently, the architecture of their dwellings will change to reflect that. Materials used will become heavier, more solid and more durable. They may also become more complicated and more expensive, as the capital and labour required to construct them is a one-time cost. Permanent dwellings often offer a greater degree of protection and shelter from the elements. In some cases however, where dwellings are subjected to severe weather conditions such as frequent flooding or high winds, buildings may be deliberately \\"designed\\" to fail and be replaced, rather than requiring the uneconomical or even impossible structures needed to withstand them. The collapse of a relatively flimsy, lightweight structure is also less likely to cause serious injury than a heavy structure. Over time, dwellings' architecture may come to reflect a very specific geographical locale. =Environment, construction elements and materials= The local environment and the construction materials it can provide, govern many aspects of vernacular architecture. Areas rich in trees will develop a wooden vernacular, while areas without much wood may use mud or stone. In early California redwood water towers supporting redwood tanks and enclosed by redwood siding (tankhouses) were part of a self-contained wind- powered domestic water system. In the Far East it is common to use bamboo, as it is both plentiful and versatile. Vernacular, almost by definition, is sustainable, and will not exhaust the local resources. If it is not sustainable, it is not suitable for its local context, and cannot be vernacular. Construction elements and materials frequently found in vernacular buildings include: * Adobe ‚Äì a type of mud brick, often covered with white- wash, commonly used in Spain and Spanish colonies * Bad girs ‚Äì a type of chimney used to provide natural ventilation, commonly found in Iran, Iraq and other parts of the Middle-East * Cob ‚Äì a type of plaster made from subsoil with the addition of fibrous material to give added strength * Mashrabiya (also known as shanashol in Iraq) ‚Äì a type of oriel window with timber lattice-work, designed to allow ventilation, commonly found in Iraq and Egypt in upper-class homes * Mud bricks ‚Äì loam or sand mixed with water and vegetable matter such as straw * Rammed earth often used in foundations * Thatch ‚Äì dry vegetation used as roofing material * Wychert ‚Äì a blend of white earth and clay Literature Following the eclipse by International Modernism of turn-of-the 20th century vernacular-inspired British and American Arts and Crafts buildings and European National Romanticism, an early work in the renewed defense of vernacular was Bernard Rudofsky's 1964 book Architecture Without Architects: A Short Introduction to Non-Pedigreed Architecture, based on his MoMA exhibition. The book was a reminder of the legitimacy and \\"hard- won knowledge\\" inherent in vernacular buildings, from Polish salt-caves to gigantic Syrian water wheels to Moroccan desert fortresses, and was considered iconoclastic at the time. Rudofsky was, however, very much a Romantic who viewed native populations in a historical bubble of contentment. Rudofsky's book was also based largely on photographs and not on on-site study. A more nuanced work is the Encyclopedia of Vernacular Architecture of the World edited in 1997 by Paul Oliver of the Oxford Institute for Sustainable Development. Oliver argues that vernacular architecture, given the insights it gives into issues of environmental adaptation, will be necessary in the future to \\"ensure sustainability in both cultural and economic terms beyond the short term.\\" Christopher Alexander, in his book A Pattern Language, attempted to identify adaptive features of traditional architecture that apply across cultures. Howard Davis's book The Culture of Building details the culture that enabled several vernacular traditions. Some extend the term \\"vernacular\\" to include any architecture outside the academic mainstream. The term \\"commercial vernacular\\", popularized in the late 1960s by the publication of Robert Venturi's \\"Learning from Las Vegas\\", refers to 20th-century American suburban tract and commercial architecture. There is also the concept of an \\"industrial vernacular\\" with its emphasis on the aesthetics of shops, garages and factories. Some have linked vernacular with \\"off-the-shelf\\" aesthetics. In any respect, those who study these types of vernaculars hold that the low-end characteristics of this aesthetic define a useful and fundamental approach to architectural design. Among those who study vernacular architecture are those who are interested in the question of everyday life and those lean toward questions of sociology. In this, many were influenced by The Practice of Everyday Life (1984) by Michel de Certeau. Humanitarian response Sutyagin House, a wooden single-family house declared illegal by the city of Arkhangelsk because of the fire hazard An appreciation of vernacular architecture is increasingly seen as vital in the immediate response to disasters and the following construction of transitional shelter if it is needed. The work Transitional Settlement: Displaced Populations, produced by Shelter Centre covers the use of vernacular in humanitarian response and argues its importance. The value of housing displaced people in shelters which are in some way familiar is seen to provide reassurance and comfort following often very traumatic times. As the needs change from saving lives to providing medium to long term shelter the construction of locally appropriate and accepted housing can be very important.\\"NGOs criticise tsunami shelters\\" BBC News ‚Äì 22 December 2006 Legal aspects As many jurisdictions introduce tougher building codes and zoning regulations, \\"folk architects\\" sometimes find themselves in conflict with the local authorities. A case that made news in Russia was that of an Arkhangelsk entrepreneur Nikolay P.

Young (born March 31, 1889 ‚Äì May 24, 1975) was an American architect, realtor and insurance agent. Over a span of 52 years, he designed and built 31 structures in Charlevoix, Michigan but was never a registered architect. He worked mostly in stone, using limestone, fieldstone, and boulders he found throughout Northern Michigan. The homes are commonly referred to as gnome homes, mushroom houses, or Hobbit houses. His door, window, roof and fireplace designs were very distinct because of his use of curved lines. Young's goal was to show that a small stone house could be as impressive as a castle. Young also helped make Charlevoix the busy, summer resort town that it is today. Ukraine Different regions in Ukraine have their own examples of vernacular architecture. For example, in the Carpathian Mountains and the surrounding foothills, wood and clay are the primary traditional building materials.

Most commonly the losing play either constitutes a free finesse, or else it gives declarer a ruff and discard. In a case where declarer has no entries to dummy (or to his own hand), the defender may also be endplayed into leading a suit which can be won in that hand. Example For example, South is declarer in 6 and West leads the diamond king. If the adverse spades are divided 2-1, there are 12 certain tricks (six spade tricks, two hearts, one diamond and three clubs) and the possibility of a 13th by correctly guessing the two-way finesse (or dropping the queen) in hearts. But if the spades are 3-0, declarer will need an endplay to avoid the heart guess. He should start by winning the diamond ace and ruffing a diamond in dummy, then cash the spade ace and spade king. If this reveals a 3-0 trump split, he now ruffs another diamond in dummy. If this is not overruffed, the contract is now assured. Declarer's now plays the king, ace, and queen of clubs, discarding a heart from dummy to reach the end position shown below: Declarer exits with a spade, and whoever wins is endplayed. If the defender leads a heart, North-South must make three heart tricks; if a club or diamond, declarer will ruff in one hand and discard a heart from the other, making an extra trump trick. Or if the defender has fewer than three clubs and chooses to ruff before the above position is reached, he is likewise endplayed, having to lead a heart or a diamond.

Her second husband, Marcus Kavanagh (1859‚Äì1937), was a Cook County judge in Chicago, Illinois from 1898 to 1935. Accounts differ on how she and the judge met, and where and when they married. In July 1908, the Chicago Tribune announced that they would be married at his parents' church in Des Moines, Iowa, but that the judge was \\"reticent as to the details.\\"\\"Bachelor Jurist and Bride-to-Be,\\" Chicago Tribune, 16 July 1908, p. 4. Another article in the Tribune, several weeks later, said that Mrs. Templeton had been abandoned by her first husband in Chicago circa 1893. In the course of the clerical work in the city recorder's office by which she supported herself,\\"Chicago Woman Writing Irish Fairy Tales,\\" Chicago Tribune, 2 August 1902, p. 16. she met Kavanagh, and they were to be married at the church in County Waterford, Ireland where his parents had been married. \\"It is said there has been a silent understanding and a wait of over ten years\\" until news of Templeton's death in 1907, the article explained.\\"Local Jurist Weds in Erin; Sequel of Chicago Romance,\\" Chicago Tribune, 19 August 1908, p. 13.

But according to her 1933 obituary in the same newspaper, they met in Ireland in 1907 while the judge was touring Europe and she was gathering material for a book, and they married on 19 August 1908, at his parent's church in Des Moines, Iowa.\\"Mrs. Kavanagh, Wife of Judge, Dies; Ill a Week,\\" Chicago Tribune, 31 October 1933, p. 22.

Judge Marcus Kavanagh, her second husband. Her best known work, Darby O'Gill and the Good People (), was first published as a series of stories under the name Herminie Templeton in McClure's magazine in 1901‚Äì1902, before being published as a book in the United States in 1903. A second edition, published a year before her death, was under the name Herminie T. Kavanagh. The Good People in the title refers to the fairies in Irish mythology. The English translation of daoine maithe is good people. Her second published book, Ashes of Old Wishes and Other Darby O'Gill Tales (), was published in 1926. In 1959, Walt Disney released a film based on these two books, called Darby O'Gill and the Little People. She also wrote two plays, The Color Sergeant (1903), and Swift-Wing of the Cherokee (1903). Judge and Mrs. Kavanagh lived in Chicago and Ocean Grove, New Jersey. She died of a heart ailment, and was buried in New York, her former home.

They formed in 1976, split-up in 1981, re-grouped in 1986 and have remained semi- active ever since. Critic Mark Deming calls them \\"quite simply, one of the best and brightest American bands of punk's first wave.\\"Deming, Mark \\"[ Weird World, Vol. 1 Review]\\", AllMusic, retrieved March 3, 2007 History =Formation= The band was formed in 1976 by singer John Denney and his guitarist brother Dix (sons of Hollywood actress Nora Denney), initially using the band names the Barbies and the Luxurious Adults.Martin C. Strong, The Great Indie Discography. Edinburgh, Scotland: Canongate Publishing, 2003; pg. 179 The Weirdos were originally a 1950s-inspired hard rock and roll band that, like the Ramones in New York City, predated the UK punk scene. While initially trying to distance themselves from the genre name \\"punk\\" that was created in New York, ultimately the band, in the words of John Denney, \\"just kinda became more like this punk ROCK N ROLL type thing and we kinda went with it because the fans wanted it. They wore us down and we just said 'OK, fine! We're punk rock, similar to the Ramones. Whatever you say.'\\"Al Kowalewski and Joy Aoki, \\"Weirder Than You,\\" Flipside, whole no. 65 (Spring 1990), pp. 38-43. In a 1990 Flipside interview, John Denney listed the Ramones, New York Dolls and Iggy Pop as fundamental musical inspirations, adding: > \\"When we saw the Ramones in '76, we already had short hair and we were > already playing fast music like that in late 1975 in small venues and halls > mostly, but the Ramones really made us decide to go for it even more. We > came before the Sex Pistols and The Damned.

Well before any of the UK > bands started cloning America's punk sound and before any of the UK albums > were released. I always felt we were a true garage punk band...\\" Denney claimed that the band's name dated from the early part of the 1970s and referred to his countercultural short hair, at a time when long hair on men was the fashion of the day. \\"In 1974 according to some left over hippies, I looked like a lobotomy, hippies thought I was weird,\\" Denney said. \\"A few months later when we formed, the rest of the band got really short cropped hair too. \\"We were all weird then, we were considered weirdos\\". By the beginning of 1977, the Weirdos were able to pack clubs (eventually including the Whisky a Go Go, The Roxy and later The Masque) as a headlining band. Known for their zany stage costumes and antics, the band helped shape the vigorous and experimental early Los Angeles punk scene and served as an inspiration to a crop of new bands. John Denney recalled: > \\"We [Los Angeles] had our own look, our own sound. It was apart from New > York or London.... We were staunchly against safety pins, we tried to parody > punk rock at first. We did happy faces onstage as a joke sometimes, which > was the exact opposite of what New York was doing. We were just thumbing our > noses at everything. Everything was a joke; punk was a joke, we were a joke. > Nonetheless, we were still serious about rocking.\\" =Recordings= The Weirdos' first release was a 7-inch EP, \\"Destroy All Music,\\" released in 1977 on Greg Shaw's Bomp! Records. It was followed by the 1978 single \\"We Got the Neutron Bomb,\\" released on the Los Angeles punk label Dangerhouse. The band later released two 12\\" EPs in 1979 and 1980. The band were highly critical of some of their recordings and shady engineers, with John Denney characterizing the 1979-80 period as \\"a big botch job\\" marked by a series of \\"aborted recording sessions.\\" It was not until 1991 that a first volume of early recordings would be remixed by the band for release by Frontier Records as a compilation album, Weird World - Volume One 1977-1981. More than another decade would pass before a long-planned second compilation album of early tracks would see the light of day, issued by Frontier in 2003 as We Got The Neutron Bomb - Weird World Volume Two 1977-1989. =Personnel= The Denney brothers were the only constant members, though guitarist/bassist Cliff Roman, bassist Dave Trout and Bruce Moreland (also of Wall of Voodoo), and drummer Nickey \\"Beat\\" Alexander were relatively long-term Weirdos. =Breakup and legacy= The Weirdos broke up in 1981. Cliff Martinez, who briefly drummed for the band, went on to join Red Hot Chili Peppers, playing on the latter's first two albums. Dix Denney was also close to becoming a member of the Chili Peppers. However, after many practices with Denney, things didn't work out and he was replaced by guitarist Jack Sherman. LA-based rock band Symbol Six stated that the Weirdos were one of their biggest formative influences, and covered \\"The Hideout'\\" which appeared on their self-titled 2013 album on Dr. Strange Records, even creating a tribute video for the song that honored the Weirdos. =Reformations= The Weirdos have reunited several times, beginning in 1990. The resulting first full-length studio album, Condor, issued that year by Frontier, was an effort to \\"re-establish ourselves as contemporary,\\" according to John Denney. A 2004 reunion included Circle Jerks bassist Zander Schloss and the Skulls drummer Sean Antillon in the lineup. Another reformed edition of the Weirdos, featuring the Denney brothers, Schloss and Devo drummer Jeff Friedl, appeared at the Punk Rock Bowling and Music Festival in Las Vegas on May 25, 2013, followed by additional 2013-2014 shows in California, Denver and Austin, as well as an appearance at the Dangerhouse Records Night concert on November 29, 2014 at the Echoplex in Los Angeles. In 2016, Bruce Moreland, the bassist from the 1978 version of the Weirdos, rejoined the band.

Mwene (plural: Awene) in Kikongo meant a person holding authority, particularly judicial authority, derived from the root -wene which meant, by the sixteenth century at least, territory over which jurisdiction was held. The ruler of Kongo was the most powerful mwene in the region who the Portuguese regarded as the king (in Kikongo ntinu king upon their arrival in 1483. Kandas, Gera√ß√µes and Houses The kingdom of Kongo had a formal state apparatus, in which most positions (rendas in Portuguese- language documents, meaning income bearing positions) were in the hands of the king, and the king himself was elected by powerful officials. Kings sought and held office with the assistance of a kanda. Each kanda (plural: makanda) was a faction which organized people according to a common goal, often but not always rooted in a kin-based relationship.John Thornton, \\"Elite Women in the Kingdom of Kongo: Historical Perspectives on Women's Political Power\\", Journal of African History 47 (2006): 439. Kandas generally took the name of a person (i.e. Nimi, Nlaza or Mpanzu), but could also take the name of a location or title such as Mbala (court)Thornton, John: \\"Elite Women\\" p. 445.) or birthplace (Kwilu or NsundiThornton \\"Elite Women,\\" p. 449.). The Kikongo prefix \\"ki\\" is added onto these names to mean \\"people with something in common\\".Thornton, \\"Elite Women\\", p. 445. These factions were recorded as gera√ß√µes or casas (lineages or houses) in Kongo documents written in Portuguese. Until the mid-seventeenth century, following the Battle of Mbwila, these factions were short lived and fluctuating, but following the battle, factions were much firmer and lasted for generations, particularly the Kimpanzu and Kinlaza.Thornton \\"Elite Women \\", p. 449. The Quilombo dos Palmares, a Maroon kingdom formed in Northeast Brazil, was founded by princes and nobles who were enslaved and transported to Portuguese Brazil after the battle in Kongo. There, they retained their titles and their lineage survived even after the kingdom itself was destroyed. Dynasties When the Portuguese arrived in Kongo in 1483,Oliver, Roland and Anthony Atmore: Medieval Africa, 1250‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001 p. 168. the reigning king represented the Nimi kanda.\\"Elite Women\\", p 445. This kanda was probably descended from Nimi a Nzima, father of the founder of Kongo.Thornton,\\"Elite Women\\", p. 445. Divisions emerged within the kanda during succession disputes, for example, following the death of Afonso I in 1542, his son Pedro I and grandson Diogo I formed two opposed factions, that of Pedro was called the Kibala (court) faction, and the other, whose name is unknown that followed Diogo.Thornton, \\"Elite Women\\", p. Other elections in the sixteenth century probably also involved similar factions, though the details are unknown. King √Ålvaro I was the first king of the House of Kwilu (Portuguese: Coulo). This kanda or lineage was named for the birthplace of √Ålvaro,John Thornton, The Kingdom of Kongo: Civil War and Transition, 1641‚Äì1718 (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1983) north of the capital city. The Kwilu reigned until 1614 when Antonio da Silva, Duke of Mbamba intervened to place Bernardo I on the throne, in place of √Ålvaro II's minor son, who would eventually take office as √Ålvaro III. Another kanda, the House of Nsundi, later known as the Kinkanga a Mvika, took control of Kongo in 1622 under Pedro II, and retained it through the reign of his son, Garcia I.Thornton, Kingdom of Kongo, p. 449-50. Garcia never held power strongly, and the Kimpanzu returned to power under Ambrosio I. Kimpanzu domination ended in 1641 when two brothers √Ålvaro and Garcia of the new House of Kinlaza overthrew √Ålvaro V and took power.Thornton, Kingdom of Kongo. The members of the Kikanga a Mvika were all killed or absorbed into the Kinlaza by 1657.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthonty: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684‚Äì1706\\", page 39. Cambridge University, 1998 The Kinlaza dynasty would reign until Kongo's catastrophic civil war following the 1665 Battle of Mbwila, when sporadic and violent alternation followed. The capital was destroyed in 1678.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthonty: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684‚Äì1706\\", page 23. Cambridge University, 1998 Its destruction forced the claimants from both sides of the conflict to rule from mountain fortresses. The Kinlaza retreated to Mbula where they founded the capital of Lemba.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthonty: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684‚Äì1706\\", page 39. Cambridge University, 1998 Earlier another branch of Kinlaza, under the leadership of Garcia III of Kongo founded a settlement at Kibangu. The Kimpanzu based their struggle for the throne at Mbamba Luvota in the south of Soyo.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthonty: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684‚Äì1706\\", page 39. Cambridge University, 1998 A new faction appeared in the form of the √Ågua Rosada kanda, headquartered at the mountain fortress of Kibangu. This might be considered a new house formed from both the Kinlaza and Kimpanzu, its founders were the children of a Kimpanzu father and a Kinlaza mother.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthonty: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684‚Äì1706\\", page 40. Cambridge University, 1998 All parties claimed kingship over Kongo (or what was left of it), but their power rarely spread outside their fortresses or the immediate surrounding area. The country was finally reunited by Pedro IV of the √Ågua Rosada kanda. Pedro IV declared a doctrine of shared power by which the throne would shift (in due time) from Kinlaza to the Kimpanzu and back.,Thornton, John: \\"Elite Women in the Kingdom of Kongo: Historical Perspectives on Women's Political Power\\", page 455. The Journal of African History, Vol. 47, 2006 while the √Ågua Rosada appear to have continued as neutral in Pedro's fortress of Kibangu.Thornton, John K: \\"The Kongolese Saint Anthonty: Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita and the Antonian Movement, 1684‚Äì1706\\", page 201. Cambridge University, 1998 The system functioned sporadically, with considerable fighting, until 1764 when Jos√© I of the Kinlaza faction usurped the throne and thrust the country back into civil war. The Kinlaza enjoyed a short lived second dynasty that ended in 1788. After that, the throne moved through various royal hands until the kingship was extinguished in 1914. Elections The selection of kings of Kongo was by a variety of principles, as kings themselves evoked different methods of selection in their letters announcing their succession. Typically the kingdom was said to pass by election,Thornton, John: \\"Elite Women in the Kingdom of Kongo: Historical Perspectives on Women's Political Power\\", page 439. The Journal of African History, Vol. 47, 2006 though the electors and the process they used changed over time and according to circumstances. Frequently election seems to have been a combination of elective and hereditary principles.Thornton, John: \\"Elite Women in the Kingdom of Kongo: Historical Perspectives on Women's Political Power\\", page 439. The Journal of African History, Vol. 47, 2006 Kings of Kongo The following section is divided into periods based on kanda or house rulership.

Further reading This list is constructed primarily from that found in Graziano Saccardo, 'Congo e Angola con la storia dell'antica missione dei cappuccini (3 vols, Milan, 1982‚Äì83), vol. 3, pp. 11‚Äì14. Saccardo bases his reconstruction on several kinglists produced over time, by Ant√≥nio da Silva, Duke of Mbamba in 1617, by Ant√≥nio de Teruel in 1664, by Pedro Mendes in 1710 and by Francisco das Necessidades in 1844. In addition many of the kings wrote letters and signed them with both their names and their numbers, and Saccardo has found many of these to verify the kinglists. Saccardo's king list has been modified in the following manner: the Kikongo names of the kings have been given in a Kikongo form following norms established in Joseph de Munck, Kinkulu kia Nsi eto' (Tumba, 1956, 2nd ed, Matadi, 1971). The Christian names of the kings are given in modern Portuguese spelling. In addition Saccardo's entries have been updated by a number of sources, most notably the kinglist, unknown to him found in the Instituto Hist√≥rico e Geogr√°fico Brasileiro (Rio de Janeiro) Manuscritos, Lata 6, pasta 2. \\"Catallogo dos reis de Congo\\" MS of c. 1758.

Produced by Flood and the band itself, the album's title is a pun on the James Jones novel, From Here to Eternity, and its subsequent 1953 film adaptation. Background and production After the breakup of Nick Cave's former band The Birthday Party, Cave formed a new project with former band member Mick Harvey. Cave and Harvey were joined by a semi-fluid group of bandmates, initially including Einst√ºrzende Neubauten member Blixa Bargeld on guitar, Hugo Race on guitar, and former Magazine member Barry Adamson on guitar, bass, and piano. After some studio work, the band's premiere public performance was held on New Year's Eve, 1983 in Melbourne, under the name \\"Nick Cave ‚Äì Man Or Myth?\\", followed by a tour. The band then briefly called themselves \\"Nick Cave and the Cavemen\\" before adopting the \\"Bad Seeds\\" moniker, in reference to the final Birthday Party release, The Bad Seed EP. The majority of the album was recorded at Trident Studios in London in March 1984. \\"Saint Huck\\", \\"Wings off Flies\\" and \\"A Box for Black Paul\\" were recorded at The Garden studio (owned by John Foxx) between September and October 1983. J.G. Thirlwell, an early member of the group, co-wrote \\"Wings Off Flies\\" and made uncredited instrumental contributions to the album, but departed early in the recording sessions due to creative disagreements and to work on his own solo material.Daniel Dylan Wray (2014) If This Is Heaven I'm Bailing Out: The Death Of The Birthday Party , The Quietus, accessed 5 January 2017 The band is also seen playing a live performance of the title track in the 1987 Wim Wenders film Wings of Desire. This version, recorded at Hansa Studio, Berlin in February 1987, is included on CD reissues of the album. Cave later said, \\"Well, I guess we weren't kicking people in the teeth anymore. I mean, it just became different. I wanted it to be more lyrically orientated and getting Blixa Bargeld from Einst√ºrzende Neubauten in the group made an incredible difference. He's a completely kind of atmospheric guitarist and incredibly economical and it gave me room to breathe.\\" Critical reception From Her to Eternity has been well received by critics. Trouser Press wrote that while \\"the album relies less on shock effects than any the Birthday Party ever made, the explosive parts are that much more effective.\\" Chris Long of BBC Music described it as \\"imperfect, visceral, exciting and, ultimately, classic.\\" Mat Snow said it was an, \\"one of the greatest rock albums ever made. Dynamic, subtly layered, funny and plain obsessive, From Her To Eternity is the work of a visionary unfettered by worship of the romantic rock'n'roll mythology, and which thus reaches peaks hitherto unscaled.\\" Pitchfork ranked it 63rd on their list \\"The 200 Best Albums of the 1980s\\", calling it \\"ghoulish to the point of ridiculousness, which is the entire point [...their] visceral hyperbole is something powerful, as though we‚Äôre hearing humankind‚Äôs palm read by a fortune teller with a cockeyed grin and a hand snatching your wallet.\\" 2009 remaster The album was remastered and reissued on 27 April 2009 as a collector's edition CD/DVD set, along with the three subsequent albums in the Bad Seeds catalog, namely The Firstborn Is Dead, Kicking Against the Pricks and Your Funeral...

The community is named for its historical location at the junction of the eastern leg of the Dixie Highway (which followed US 70 through the region) and the Lee Highway (which followed US 11).Jack Neely, \\"Down the Dixie Lee Highway.\\" From the Shadow Side: And Other Stories of Knoxville, Tennessee (Tellico Books, 2003), pp. 125-139. From the advent of automobile travel in the late 1920s until the construction of the Interstate Highway System in the late 1950s and 1960s, these two highways were major cross-country routes, and Dixie Lee Junction developed as a \\"last chance\\" stopover for tourists traveling southward from Knoxville. While the completion of the interstates drew away most of the cross-country traffic, the US 70/US 11 intersection still serves a strategic role as the western end of the four-lane Kingston Pike, a major commercial thoroughfare in western Knox County. The Dixie Lee Junction community lies adjacent to the town of Farragut, with the Knox-Loudon county line (which runs perpendicular to Kingston Pike) being the technical boundary between the two communities. US 70 approaches Dixie Lee Junction from Kingston to the west, and US 11 approaches from Lenoir City to the southwest. The merged highways then continue eastward for through Farragut and Knoxville. Two major interstate highways, Interstate 40 (I-40) and I-75, merge just northwest of Dixie Lee Junction. The Dixie Highway was conceived in 1914 to provide a convenient route from the Midwestern United States to Florida. Its eastern section entered downtown Knoxville via Broadway before veering westward along Cumberland Avenue and out into West Knoxville along Kingston Pike. The Lee Highway, which connected New York and San Francisco, entered Knoxville from Rutledge to the northeast, and merged with the Dixie Highway in downtown Knoxville. Knoxville lay along the Dixie Highway roughly halfway between the Midwestern states and Florida, and thus made a convenient place for Florida-bound tourists to stop for the night. Throughout the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, Kingston Pike was lined with motor courts and motels, and restaurants with oddly-shaped buildings and flashy signs designed to catch the attention of passers-by. Businesses in Dixie Lee Junction during this period consisted of \\"last-chance\\" ventures that provided food, fuel, and other supplies before south-bound drivers entered a predominantly-rural stretch of the highway en route to Chattanooga.

It was created in early May 1910 as a successor to the province's second Independent Labour Party (1906‚Äì08). Former Member of Parliament Arthur Puttee was a leading MLP organizer. The party fielded one candidate in the 1910 provincial election, and also ran candidates at the municipal level. The party's founding convention declared that \\"the ultimate object of attainment shall be to preserve to the worker the full product of his toil\\". The ambiguity of this statement was criticized by the more radical Socialist Party of Canada (SPC), which called for collective ownership in industry. After the SPC nominated candidates for Winnipeg North and Winnipeg West in the 1910 provincial election, the MLP sought to prevent confrontation and vote-splitting by fielding only one candidate of their own: Fred Dixon in Winnipeg Centre. Dixon was a moderate reformer, and campaigned in an unofficial alliance with the Manitoba Liberal Party. He was bitterly opposed by the SPC, which belatedly nominated W.S. Cummings to run against him as a spoiler. Dixon lost to the Conservative Party incumbent, Thomas Taylor, by seventy-three votes. Cummings's ninety-nine votes may have made the difference in the outcome. The SPC was widely blamed for Dixon's loss, and became marginalized in Winnipeg's labour community for the next eight years. The Manitoba Labour Party dissolved after the 1910 election. In 1912, its leaders formed the Manitoba Labour Representation Committee. Election results { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" !

The photography is by Jutta Heinglein. The album was recorded in the Hansa Studios in Berlin, Germany. Cave later said of this album, \\"Berlin gave us the freedom and encouragement to do whatever we wanted. We'd lived in London for three years and it seemed that if you stuck your head out of the box, people were pretty quick to knock it back in. Particularly if you were Australian.

They were originally developed to be all-black show dogs in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and were unpopular for work as a hunting dog. However, during the mid-20th century they were redeveloped as a longer-legged dog that was more suitable to be used for field work. They are now considered to be a rare breed, and are registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by The Kennel Club. Their fur is darker than other spaniels and they have no undercoat like most of the other field type spaniels. Their coats come mostly in solid colours with some occasional markings on the chest. They can make good family dogs and are patient with children, but can require some sort of purpose, be it hunting or agility work in order to prevent them from becoming bored and destructive. History Best Champion at Crufts in 1909. The Field Spaniel was originally developed for the show ring by competitors who were attempting to develop an all-black Spaniel. Some of the breeding methods of those early developers were criticised; one of the first breeders of the Field Spaniel, Thomas Jacobs, said of the origin; \\"Much has been written and said on the purity of the breed; deprecating the means I have adopted to produce them as calculated to alter a presumed type, and frequent missiles have been hurled at me and my dogs from behind the hedge. But where is the pure bred black spaniel we hear so much about? Proof of the existence of the pure bred one (if there ever was one!) has not been forthcoming. Like most sporting dogs, they are the result of different crosses.\\" They were unpopular with sportsmen as the dark colours of the breed did not show up in hunting conditions, and the elongated and short shape of the early breed was not very practical for moving easily through cover. The low-slung variety of Field Spaniel were developed by Phineas Bullock from dogs previously owned by Sir Francis Burdett, the secretary of the Birmingham Dog Show. Burdett was said to have owned a variety of black Cocker Spaniels. Bullock crossed the Field Spaniel with the Sussex Spaniel and the English Water Spaniel. In the 1870s he was very successful in the show ring with his variety of Field Spaniel; however, it resulted in a dog that was almost exactly like a Sussex Spaniel with the exception of the head itself. The dog who is considered to be the father of the modern English Cocker Spaniel is Ch. Obo, who was born in 1879 to a Sussex Spaniel father and a Field Spaniel mother. Obo's son Ch. Obo II is considered to be the father of the modern American Cocker Spaniel, who was described as being only ten inches high with quite a long body. By 1909, the average weight of a Field Spaniel was . Further mixing of the breed occurred with elements of the Basset Hound introduced. Various genetic health issues arose and action was taken in order to correct the problems within the breed. English Springer Spaniels were used to introduce healthier elements into the breed and resulted in the longer legged spaniel that we know today. Most of the modern breed can be traced to four dogs from the 1950s; Colombina of Teffont, Elmbury Morwena of Rhiwlas, Gormac Teal, and Ronayne Regal. The Field Spaniel remains a rare breed, even in the UK. In 2009, a total of 51 dogs were registered with The Kennel Club and has been in steady decline since 2000. Out of all the Spaniel breeds registered with The Kennel Club, the Field Spaniel has the lowest numbered registered year on year, with only the Sussex Spaniel coming a close second with 60 registrations in 2009. This is compared to the English Springer Spaniel with 12,700 and the English Cocker Spaniel with 22,211 registrations in 2009 alone. In order to promote the breed, they have been registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by The Kennel Club. Description =Appearance= Field Spaniel In liver colour The standard size for a Field Spaniel is tall at the withers, and a weight of between . This places it roughly between the English Cocker Spaniel and the English Springer Spaniel in size. Its coat comes in solid colours of black and liver, or in roan. Tan points, white markings on the throat and the chest can be ticked or the same colour as the rest of the body. They have a moderately long single coat with no undercoat. Feathering of the fur appears on the chest, belly, ears and on the back of the legs. The coat is not as heavy as that of a Cocker Spaniel but requires grooming in order to prevent mats from appearing in the fur. Docking of tails has been banned in a number of countries, including the UK, however, an exemption is made for working animals. =Temperament= A solid-black- coloured Field Spaniel. The Field Spaniel is an active and inquisitive breed, and makes a good companion. However, if left alone and unoccupied for long periods of time, they may become bored and destructive. They are suitable for dog agility and hunting. They are also patient with children and like to stay close to their family. When socialised, they are good with other dogs. They are generally docile and independent, and are not as excitable as Cocker Spaniels. Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs lists the breed as being above average in working intelligence. Health There are a few ocular conditions to which the Field Spaniel has a predisposition. These include cataracts, retinal atrophy and retinal dysplasia. Hip dysplasia has appeared in British lines of Field Spaniels. The Kennel Club and British Veterinary Association highly recommend eye testing and hip scoring be carried out by Field Spaniel breeders. In a health survey conducted by the Kennel Club (UK), the primary cause of death in Field Spaniels was cancer, with the second most frequent cause being old age. The median lifespan for the breed was found to be eleven years and eight months, which is five months higher than the median age for all dog breeds. However, as the authors noted, a response rate of only 24% may have resulted in reduced accuracy.

Daikokuten evolved from the Buddhist form of the Indian deity Shiva intertwined with the Shinto god ≈åkuninushi. The name is the Japanese equivalent of MahƒÅkƒÅla, the Hindu name for Shiva. The god enjoys an exalted position as a household deity in Japan. Daikoku's association with wealth and prosperity precipitated a custom known as fukunusubi, or \\"theft of fortune\\". This custom started with the belief that whoever stole divine figures was assured of good fortune if not caught in the act. The toshi-no-ichi (year-end market) held at Sens≈ç-ji became the main venue of the sale and disposal of such images by the fortune-seekers. Many small stalls were opened where articles including images of Daikoku were sold on the eve of New Year celebrations. The Japanese also maintain the symbol of Mahakala as a monogram. The traditional pilgrims climbing the holy Mount Ontake wear tenugui (a kind of white scarf) with the seed syllable of Mahakala. Daikoku is variously considered to be the god of wealth, or of the household, particularly the kitchen. He is recognised by his wide face, smile, and a flat black hat. He is often portrayed holding a golden mallet called Uchide no kozuchi, otherwise known as the \\"mallet of fortune\\", and is seen seated on bales of rice, with rats nearby signifying plentiful food. Daikoku's image was featured on the first Japanese bank note, designed by Edoardo Chiossone. Goddess Daikokutennyo The Butsuz≈çzui compendium of 1690 (reprinted and expanded in 1796) lists and illustrates six different manifestations of Daikoku, including the feminine form known as Daikokunyo (Â§ßÈªíÂ•≥) (\\"She of the Great Blackness\\") or Daikokutennyo (Â§ßÈªíÂ§©Â•≥) (\\"She of the Great Blackness of the Heavens\\"). As Daikoku is the nipponized form of the masculine MahƒÅkƒÅla, Daikokutennyo is the nipponized form of the feminine MahƒÅkƒÅli (a.k.a. Parvati). When Daikoku is regarded as the feminine Daikokutennyo, and Kisshoutennyo is counted among the seven Fukujin, all three of the Hindu Tridevi goddesses are represented among the Fukujin.

Sejdiƒá, I. Djuroviƒá, J. Jiang, \\"Time-frequency feature representation using energy concentration: An overview of recent advances,\\" Digital Signal Processing, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 153-183, January 2009. Time‚Äìfrequency analysis means analysis into the time‚Äìfrequency domain provided by a TFR. This is achieved by using a formulation often called \\"Time‚ÄìFrequency Distribution\\", abbreviated as TFD. TFRs are often complex-valued fields over time and frequency, where the modulus of the field represents either amplitude or \\"energy density\\" (the concentration of the root mean square over time and frequency), and the argument of the field represents phase.  Background and motivation  A signal, as a function of time, may be considered as a representation with perfect time resolution. In contrast, the magnitude of the Fourier transform (FT) of the signal may be considered as a representation with perfect spectral resolution but with no time information because the magnitude of the FT conveys frequency content but it fails to convey when, in time, different events occur in the signal. TFRs provide a bridge between these two representations in that they provide some temporal information and some spectral information simultaneously. Thus, TFRs are useful for the representation and analysis of signals containing multiple time-varying frequencies.  Formulation of TFRs and TFDs  One form of TFR (or TFD) can be formulated by the multiplicative comparison of a signal with itself, expanded in different directions about each point in time. Such representations and formulations are known as quadratic or \\"bilinear\\" TFRs or TFDs (QTFRs or QTFDs) because the representation is quadratic in the signal (see Bilinear time‚Äìfrequency distribution). This formulation was first described by Eugene Wigner in 1932 in the context of quantum mechanics and, later, reformulated as a general TFR by Ville in 1948 to form what is now known as the Wigner‚ÄìVille distribution, as it was shown in B. Boashash, \\"Note on the use of the Wigner distribution for time frequency signal analysis\\", IEEE Trans. on Acoust. Speech. and Signal Processing, vol. 36, issue 9, pp 1518‚Äì1521, Sept. 1988. that Wigner's formula needed to use the analytic signal defined in Ville's paper to be useful as a representation and for a practical analysis. Today, QTFRs include the spectrogram (squared magnitude of short-time Fourier transform), the scaleogram (squared magnitude of Wavelet transform) and the smoothed pseudo-Wigner distribution. Although quadratic TFRs offer perfect temporal and spectral resolutions simultaneously, the quadratic nature of the transforms creates cross-terms, also called \\"interferences\\". The cross-terms caused by the bilinear structure of TFDs and TFRs may be useful in some applications such as classification as the cross- terms provide extra detail for the recognition algorithm. However, in some other applications, these cross-terms may plague certain quadratic TFRs and they would need to be reduced. One way to do this is obtained by comparing the signal with a different function. Such resulting representations are known as linear TFRs because the representation is linear in the signal. An example of such a representation is the windowed Fourier transform (also known as the short-time Fourier transform) which localises the signal by modulating it with a window function, before performing the Fourier transform to obtain the frequency content of the signal in the region of the window.  Wavelet transforms  Wavelet transforms, in particular the continuous wavelet transform, expand the signal in terms of wavelet functions which are localised in both time and frequency. Thus the wavelet transform of a signal may be represented in terms of both time and frequency. The notions of time, frequency, and amplitude used to generate a TFR from a wavelet transform were originally developed intuitively. In 1992, a quantitative derivation of these relationships was published, based upon a stationary phase approximation.  Linear canonical transformation  Linear canonical transformations are the linear transforms of the time‚Äìfrequency representation that preserve the symplectic form. These include and generalize the Fourier transform, fractional Fourier transform, and others, thus providing a unified view of these transforms in terms of their action on the time‚Äìfrequency domain.

My Trial is the fourth studio album by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, released on 3 November 1986 by Mute Records. Your Funeral... My Trial was originally released as a double EP. The album was issued on CD with a different running order and the bonus track \\"Scum\\". During this period in his life, Cave was steeped in heroin addiction, perhaps evidenced by the melancholy, desperate mood of this album. Cave later said, \\"That particular record, which is my favourite of the records we've done, is very special to me and a lot of amazing things happened, musically, in the studio. There are some songs on that record that as far as I'm concerned are just about perfect as we can get really- songs like \\"The Carny\\", \\"Your Funeral, My Trial\\", and \\"Stranger Than Kindness\\", I think are really quite brilliant.\\" The album was remastered and reissued on 27 April 2009 as a collector's edition CD/DVD set. The CD features the original 8-song vinyl double EP's track listing and track order, while \\"Scum\\" is featured as a bonus audio track on the accompanying DVD. Recording Producer Flood said, \\"I remember Mick Harvey arrived in the studio with the guts of an old grand piano, that was the basis of the sound. It was just the strings, attached to a metal frame. He tuned certain notes, and used a guitar plectrum to pick the notes. It then ended up as \\"The Carny\\". That was the first day of recording Your Funeral‚Ä¶ My Trial, and that kind of set the tone for the whole record.\\" Reflecting on the album in 2020, guitarist Mick Harvey noted: \\"[The album] gave us the template to go forward with. It was organised rather than rambling. It all felt complete even though it was a disparate set of sounds and styles. It felt like it belonged to us. It sounded like The Bad Seeds.\\" Movies Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds appeared in the 1987 Wim Wenders film Der Himmel √ºber Berlin, performing \\"The Carny\\" (which is heard once before the performance scene) and \\"From Her to Eternity\\". \\"The Carny\\" also inspired the 2003 animated short film Jo Jo in the Stars, which won the BAFTA Award for Best Animated Short Film.

Closely related to the Chilodontidae and formerly included with them, the Anostomidae contain about 150 described species. Commonly known as anostomids, they are found in freshwater habitats from the R√≠o Atrato in northernmost South America to warm-temperate central Argentina; they are of Amazon origin, with few found west of the Andes (mainly in Colombia and Venezuela). Their scientific name approximately means \\"mouth on top\\", from Ancient Greek √°no- (·ºÑŒΩœâ) \\"up\\" (as an adverb) + st√≥ma (œÉœÑœåŒº·æ∂) \\"mouth\\", in reference to the arrangement of these fishes' mouth opening.FishBase (2004), Sidlauskas & Vari (2008) Description Anostomids have elongated bodies ranging from in length; their shape varies between fusiform and deeper-bodied, but even the latter are only moderately laterally. They have elongated, tapering heads with rather long, straight snouts, and small apical to upturned mouths immediately at or near the snout tip. This family contains many headstanders, which habitually swim with their heads pointing from 45¬∞ up to 90¬∞ downwards; most feed on plants near the bottom, while others also eat detritus and invertebrates picked up from river- or lakebeds. Adults guard the eggs after spawning. Anostomidae are generally considered edible, and some of the larger species are caught for food on a regular basis, much like large Leuciscinae (which are superficially similar Cypriniformes) are in the temperate Northern Hemisphere.Weitzman & Vari (1998), FishBase (2004), Sidlauskas & Vari (2008) Their jaws are rather short, with the maxillary bone small and excluded from the mouth opening, while the ascending process of the premaxilla is triangular in overall shape and robustly developed. One row of six or eight curved teeth occur in each jaw, arranged by length in a step-like fashion, with the front teeth being the longest; the pharyngeal teeth are enlarged and have two or more cusps each. Anostomid gill openings are small, with the gill membranes firmly joined to the isthmus; the ligament between the interopercle and the mouth is elongated and the interopercle is clearly separated from the retroarticular. On the sides of the preopercle is a large, elongated protrusion, where the powerful jaw adductor muscles attach. The third epibranchial gill arch has a curved anterior process which extends medially over the dorsal surface of the fourth infrapharyngobranchial arch. The circumorbital bone series is complete and includes a supraorbital bone, and at least four, often more, of the forward ribs are united by two or more intercostal ligaments. The lateral line is complete, contains 33-44 perforated scales, and runs along the midline of the body. The dentary bears a short lateral-line canal ending at or shortly behind mid-length, and altogether the lateral-line canals of the head are divided into at least two ossified tubes. All anostomids have an adipose fin; their dorsal fin contains one and 11, the anal fin one and 9, and the pelvic fins one and 8-9 hard and soft rays, respectively. Systematics and evolution Black-banded Leporinus (Leporinus fasciatus), the type species of Leporinus This family is in all probability monotypic as traditionally defined. Several attempts to delimit subfamilies have taken place, and several of the proposed groupings indeed correspond to clades within this family. Leporellus has long been recognized as the basal- most living anostomid genus, due to its many plesiomorphies shared with the Chilodontidae and its peculiar apomorphies, and separated as a monotypic subfamily by some. A large clade of \\"modern\\" genera was treated as Anostominae by some authors; others considered that subfamily more inclusive.Sidlauskas & Vari (2008) But the latter view is incorrect, as it includes a large number of lineages that are really basal members of the family and should not be treated as a subfamily (except monotypic ones, but these are generally avoided). Also, the huge assemblage usually treated under Leporinus is not monophyletic and in need of thorough study, to see how it is best divided. Depending on the exact relationships of Anostomoides, a Leporinus sensu lato clade could warrant recognition as another subfamily. Finally, Rhytiodus and Schizodon would almost certainly qualify as another subfamily, even if only the Anostominae warrant recognition otherwise. =Evolution and fossil record= The taxon Anostominae is also used to denote the entire family in outdated treatments, where the name \\"Anostomidae\\" is applied to the entire Anostomoidea (and sometimes even more distant relatives). In that respect, agreement is widespread today that the closest living relatives of the Anostomidae sensu stricto are the Chilodontidae headstanders, the toothless characins (Curimatidae) and the flannel-mouthed characins (Prochilodontidae). The origin of the Anostomidae can be quite confidently placed in the Paleogene, and somewhat less securely in late Paleogene, based on various evidence. For one, the biogeography of the family, with some very basal taxa found west of the Andes, indicates it was already well distinct when the northern part of that mountain range uplifted at the end of the Middle Miocene about 12 million years ago (Mya). Then, some scant but highly informative fossil evidence assigned to this family: a premaxillary tooth was found in the Colombian Villavieja Formation\\"La Venta formation\\" in Sidlauskas & Vari (2008) is the old name. and dated to the Laventan age about 13.5-11.5 Mya, while some pharyngeal teeth and other jaw parts found near Cuenca, Ecuador in the Cuenca basin (a structural basin) are about 19 million years old. The fossil remains resemble Leporinus and were assigned to the living genus, but given its paraphyly and rather basal position, until more fossils are found the known remains can only be considered fairly basal Anostomidae, incertae sedis, but probably close to the Leporinus assemblage. Cyphocharax mosesi, a fossil toothless characin found in Brazil, lived at the Oligocene-Miocene boundary about 23 Mya. Thus, at that time, the Anostomoidea families must have already been well distinct. Given that the Characiformes originated slightly more than 115 Mya, the Anostomoidea probably diverged from their characiform relatives the Late Cretaceous and diversified thereafter; a Paleogene origin of the Anostomidae is thus most likely, with present-day subfamilies (whatever eventually will be accepted) having diverged by the start of the Neogene. Whether the family originated in Oligocene or already in the Eocene (or perhaps even in the Paleocene) cannot be said until more fossil material is recovered, either to answer this question directly or to provide calibration for molecular phylogenetic studies.Filleul & Maisey (2004), Sidlauskas & Vari (2008) =Genera= The genera of Anostomidae are: Basal lineages * Abramites (two species) * Anostomoides (three species) * Hypomasticus (seven species) * Leporellus (four species) * Leporinus (79 species; paraphyletic) * Megaleporinus (10 species)Ramirez, J.L., Birindelli, J.L.O. & Galetti, P.M.Jr. (2017): A new genus of Anostomidae (Ostariophysi: Characiformes): Diversity, phylogeny and biogeography based on cytogenetic, molecular and morphological data.

The change of mood was greatly inspired by singer Nick Cave falling in love with Brazilian journalist Viviane Carneiro, and an apparently salutary spell in rehab which purged much of the despair and squalor reflected in the previous two albums.

Music: Cave, Bargeld, Roland Wolf) Song details \\"Foi Na Cruz\\" is based partly upon the traditional Brazilian Protestant hymn of the same title. The title translates roughly as \\"It Happened on the cross\\". \\"The Good Son\\" - the opening chant is based loosely upon the African-American traditional song \\"Another Man Done Gone\\". A recording of this traditional song, by Odetta, later appeared on Original Seeds Vol. 1, a compilation of material that influenced Cave. The Biblical story of Cain and Abel is an obvious influence on the song, which describes a \\"a tiller and he has a tiller's hand\\" like Cain, a farmer who feuds with and kills his brother. \\"The Witness Song\\" is based loosely upon the traditional American gospel song \\"Who Will be a Witness?\\". The single mix of \\"The Weeping Song\\" is a different mix than the one found on the album. Four of the songs on the album were left with their working titles (\\"The Ship Song\\", \\"The Weeping Song\\", \\"The Hammer Song\\", \\"The Witness Song\\"). The instrumental b-side \\"Cocks 'n' Asses\\" was retitled \\"The B-side Song\\" for the USA release.

The Koolie is a working or herding dog which has existed in Australia since the early 19th century when it was bred from imported British working dogs. Robert Kaleski, in an article on Cattle Dogs in the August 1903 issue of the Agricultural Gazette of New South Wales, describes the \\"Welsh heeler or merle, erroneously known as the German collie,\\" as a \\"blue-gray dog about the size and build of a smooth- haired collie, generally with wall eyes.\\" The British background predominated in the dogs that came to be associated with the \\"German collie\\" name. There is substantial variation in the Koolie population, as Koolies were bred to exhibit different characteristics in different regions. The Koolie Club of Australia defines the breed based on its ability to work rather than on its conformation. However, most Koolie breeders refer to the Koolie as a breed rather than as a type, and assert that it \\"breeds true\\", with various types or strains. The Koolie is a \\"herding dog\\", one which has a natural instinct to circle widely round sheep and bring them back to their owner. Koolies are known as silent, upright, working dogs. They are used for herding sheep and also for quiet careful work at close quarters at lambing time or for \\"shedding\\" (cutting out) sheep. Description =Appearance= Red Merle short coat blocking cattle The Koolie is as diverse as the country it originates from, Australia. In the north of Queensland and New South Wales they are tall, medium boned and agile, bred for mustering Simmental cattle and Brahma over many miles. In The Hunter Valley region and Snowy Mountains of New South Wales, they're thicker set and shorter to flush low lying cattle from the dense bush and gullies. In Victoria, one finds the smallest variety of the Koolie. Koolies are bred to meet the needs of the stockman, grazier and farmer, all agile, all with the same ability to adapt to any situation, all with a strong willingness drive. The Koolie vary from in size and are a contrast of coat, colour and body type, although they are merled coat pattern. The solid red or black Koolie are often mistaken for Kelpies, and some bi coloured Koolie have been taken for Border Collies by the general public, rarely if ever by breeders. As all of these breeds share Collie ancestry, they resemble each other. =Coat= mustering cattle The Koolie coat ranges from short/smooth (like that of the original blue merle Collies from Scotland), short (like a working Kelpie), medium and, not common, long (like the show Border Collie). Koolies are typically slightly longer than tall. The majority of owners prefer the short/smooth coats as they do not pick up grass seed, and are very easy to maintain, with the occasional swim to keep the coat glossy and free of parasites. =Colouring= Koolie colours can be solid (all one colour black or red/chocolate (this includes Koolie who are cryptic merle: carry the merle gene but do not display it obviously)) \\"bi\\" (black & white or red & white) \\"tri\\" (solid red or black, with white markings, normally with brown points), or \\"tri merle\\" (same description but merle) \\"merle\\" (grey, black, red/chocolate or white undercoat with large splashes of darker colourings of red/chocolate for red merles or black/grey for blue merles). Black Koolies will commonly have a black nose with black eyes, or tones of black including blue. Red or chocolate Koolies will commonly have a red or chocolate nose with brown eyes, or tones of brown, including yellow, and there can be combinations of both black or brown with the added blue eye/s. There are also dilute colours of slate or gun metal grey for black Koolies and fawn for Red Koolies. Also there is a yellow or cream colour created by the E,loci which is a masking gene and covers a red/chocolate Koolie to make it appear yellow/cream, this gene will also cover any merle, so it is advised that great care be taken and DNA testing done to discover if the E,loci is present before breeding. The same advice is given with relations to the dilute gene. =Temperament= Blue merle short coat heading sheep Graziers, stockmen and dairy farmers across Australia since days long past have typically selected breeds which display the abilities required to meet their working needs. The temperament found in a Koolie is a culmination of these much sought-after abilities. The optimal worker possesses a combination of working skills and bonding temperament. There are times when an uninitiated dog owner or a new enthusiast mistakes the Koolie as a shy, reserved or even a timid animal. The Koolie's temperament needs to be understood in proper context when one seeks an optimal match of skills and demeanour. Koolies are intelligent animals, and the most experienced handlers know well that they need guidance in training. A steady and supportive approach will be productive, proving the Koolie's adaptability in diverse situations when given time. Owners will be rewarded through the Koolie's diligence in varied roles such as in work situations, sporting activities, loyal service or the time honoured role of companionship. Known to be patient, temperate, dedicated, with a strong sense of willingness and devotion; the Koolie is not naturally aggressive but can demonstrate dominance. They show an untiring enthusiasm for work and an admirable hardiness when the job or circumstance requires. Health blue merle-smooth coat-In Agility The median longevity of Koolies is about 15 years, which is a typical lifespan for this breed. Koolies have a diverse but small gene pool and so can and do suffer from the many genetic problems found in recognised breeds however most have genetic tests available these days but hip and elbow scoring is necessary to reduce the incidence of Hip and Elbow Dysplasia, the merle for which the Koolie is most recognised by can, and does, produce blind and/or deaf white pups so merle testing should be performed prior to breeding, merle to solid are the safest option otherwise. =Medical research= *In 2003 DNA testing carried out on 56 individual Koolie bloodlines from Australia by Dr. Mark Neff of the University of California at Davis in the USA cleared those bloodlines tested for the presence of the mutant gene mdr1-1, which causes malfunction in the canine multidrug resistance gene; Collie bloodlines were chosen to be tested because they showed a reaction, even death, to chemicals, such as Ivermectin, used in the treatment of intestinal parasites. *In 2004, the Koolie Club of Australia in conjunction with Genetic Science Service of Australia launched the collection and processing of Koolie DNA, which continues to test for all current Collie diseases and family relationships. To date, the Koolie Club of Australia's database records show that their registered Koolie breed is relatively free of common genetic disorders that are found in recognised pure breeds, thanks to DNA testing. It is generally accepted that this is due to the natural breeding selection, which has continued unhindered for over 160 years. *In 2007, the Koolie Club of Australia through Genetic Science Service of Australia gained access to the Merle test, discovered in 2006 by Dr. Keith Murphy's laboratory of the Department of Pathobiology at the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences of Texas A&M; University more info *In 2008, Koolies registered with the Koolie Club of Australia have undertaken a breed specificity test to identify the Koolie genetically, the results will help discover and create stronger bloodlines. *In 2010, the Australian Koolie's own unique signature gene is discovered through ASAP laboratories in Victoria, Australia, by Dr. George Sofronidis, making them the first Australian breed recognised by their DNA before the controlling canine body of their home country. *In 2012, the Australian Koolie breed became a recognised member of the Veterinaries Genetics Assurance program. Herding technique A Red Merle koolie backing sheep. Koolies are much sought-after in rural Australia, and interest is now being shown in America, Canada, Germany, Finland, New Zealand, Switzerland and Holland. According to Geoff Broughton, past president of the Koolie Club of Australia for 7 years, the Koolie will head (move to the front or head of the stock to push them back towards you), heel or drive, (push the stock from behind), cast (move out and around the stock), block (hold the stock or block them from in front, in three sheep trials this action is called the pick up) and back (literally jump onto the backs of their charges to herd them if necessary). Koolies have a reputation for being upright workers with a good eye, who can easily shift their focus from holding the group to casting around a flock or gathering breakaways. They are not known for having \\"sticky eyes\\" (focusing on the sheep in front only). Unlike other working breeds, which are noted for their crouched form or style and preference for either yard or field work, Koolies are at ease working in closed surroundings such as yards or trucks and being out in paddocks and droving. As well as working anything from ducks to bulls, like all dogs of their kind they will herd family members and children in the absence of other charges. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at non-competitive herding tests. Koolies exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in stock dog trials. History Red Merle short coat blocking sheep The Koolie's ancestors were the smooth coated blue merle Collie (imported from Britain in the 19th century) and the Black and Tan Collie from the Highlands of Scotland; these were the same type imported by Thomas Hall for the creation of his Heelers. The Koolie is believed to be descended from the same Collie types that were brought to Australia for the kennels of Thomas S. Hall (an originator of the Australian Cattle Dog breed); some believe that they could be direct descendants of Hall's dogs. While some believe the \\"German Coolie\\" to be descended from the \\"German Tiger\\", a European herding dog, there is no genetic or even anecdotal evidence to support this claim. A more plausible theory is that these dogs were used by German immigrants in South Australia who, unable to correctly pronounce \\"collie\\", referred to the dogs as \\"coolies\\". Others have noted strong similarities with the Australian Koolie and the Welsh Collie, another British herding subtype. According to older Koolie breeders personal records, from diaries and photo albums the Koolie has been around for over 160 years. During the industrial era some bloodlines were influenced by Kelpie and Border Collie, as explained by one grazier in Western Australia, \\"You bred from the good workers which were around and Koolies were not always to be found, so you bred to the next best worker that was and this was either the Kelpie or Border depending on the region you lived and the stock you worked\\". In 2000, the Koolie Club of Australia was formed to preserve, protect and ethically promote the Koolie breed. The Koolie Club does not actively work towards bench standard recognition, feeling this would only be detrimental to the breeds working future. As of (2013), no bench standard exists. In 2004, the Koolie breed was recognised by the Australian Sporting Registrar, judges from the Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) may judge Koolies in all ANKC sanctioned sporting trials. In the states of Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland, registered Koolies may compete in, herding, obedience, tracking, jumping, gambles and dog agility events through registration on their State's Sporting Register as members of the Koolie Club of Australia. Solid Tri, short coat USA import In May 2006, the Stockdog Committee of the Australian Shepherd Club of America voted to accept the \\"Koolie/German Coolie\\" into their list of recognised and accepted herding breeds, admission was granted June 2006. In 2006, The American Herding Breed Association accepted the Australian Koolie onto their list of recognised and accepted breeds. =Exports= In 2002, the first exportation to America of a registered DNA tested Koolie were orchestrated by members of the Koolie Club of Australia, for Ms Torry Lynn Revels of North Carolina, USA. In 2003, at the Koolie Club of Australia's Annual General meeting a unanimous vote was returned to appoint Ms Revels the club's official representative in America, Ms Revels was instrumental in gaining acceptance of the Australian Koolie to the recognised breeds lists of the American Herding Breed Association and the Australian Shepherd Club of America in order to gain qualifying scores in herding trials. In 2008, the first exportation to New Zealand of a registered DNA tested Koolie were orchestrated by members of the Koolie Club of Australia, for Ms Penny Nalders of Wellington, New Zealand. In 2008, the first exportation to Finland of registered DNA tested Koolies were orchestrated by members of the Koolie Club of Australia, for Ms Sinikka Kumpusalmi of Vehmersalmi, and Mrs Satu Tasanen of Honkilahti, Finland. In 2011, the first exportation to Switzerland of registered DNA tested Koolies were orchestrated by members of the Koolie Club of Australia, for Ms Brigitt Stirnimann of Aarwangen, Switzerland.

The Beaver Lake watershed is 1,043 acres (4.2 km); the mean depth is 21 feet (6.4 m), and the maximum depth is 50 feet (15 m). Beaver Lake is actually a chain of one main and two smaller lakes, with the main lake getting the bulk of the recreation focus. Beaver Lake is part of a chain of three lakes: Long Lake, Beaver Lake, and a third unnamed lake, East of Lake Sammamish. It is drained by Laughing Jacobs Creek, a tributary of Lake Sammamish. There is public access via Beaver Lake Park, located at the southwest corner of the lake. Boaters are not allowed to use gasoline motors, but fishing is still a popular recreational activity on the lake. The boat launch site is not located within the Park, but rather via a WDFD water access site. The lake is also used for the swimming leg of the annual Beaver Lake Triathlon, which starts in the park. Ecology Beaver Lake \\"may soon need a name change\\" because flooding of some homeowner's docks, has prompted the Sammamish Parks and Recreation Department to obtain an emergency permit from the Washington Department of Ecology to relocate a family of beavers (Castor canadensis) that built a dam on Laughing Jacobs Creek, raising the lake's level. Beaver have been shown to increase salmon and trout abundance and size in several ways: their ponds recharge water tables which replenish stream flows in the dry season, provide critical habitat for young salmonids, and remove sediment loads from streams. Contrary to popular myth, most beaver dams do not pose barriers to trout and salmon migration, although they may be restricted seasonally during periods of low stream flows. Insect, invertebrate, fish, mammal, and bird diversity are also expanded. Water levels behind beaver dams can be controlled easily with flow devices such as a Beaver Deceiver. In fact, a 2006 survey found that trapping as a solution to beaver problems had a 79% failure rate within two years due to re-settlement by new beavers. Fishing Beaver Lake is heavily fished by locals. Many trout are caught from shore, but it is best for any species with a boat. Trout are found mostly in the main and larger sister lake. Bass are caught consistently in Beaver's many lily pads and fallen timber areas, and are abundant in the smaller, shallower sister lake. Perch are found all over, and dropping a worm under a dock produces many of them.

Background The town of Buhriz is heavily agricultural, located on fertile land along the Diyala River and engaged in the cultivation of date palms, orange trees, and other crops. The town has a beautiful old bazar that lies near the small river of Sariah (Khuraisan), it sells all kind of local fruit & vegetables. close to the bazar are two of the oldest mosques in Diyala province, The Big Mosque and Abu Al Gaith Mosque. Not far from it are 3 very nice local tea bars. or as locals call it (Gahwa), where usually people sit and have a nice cup of tea and chit chat about their days, and also it's a place to gather and watch matches of football. It maintains a rural character despite its proximity to Baqubah and Baghdad, with many residents living in traditional mud huts with some concrete-block houses. The town was known under the regime of Saddam Hussein as the home of many members of the Ba'ath Party, as well as being particularly conservative with traditional religious and tribal values predominate. Following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, Buhriz emerged as a flashpoint for guerrilla fighters opposed to the coalition troops and their Iraqi allies. It became the scene of repeated battles between U.S. and Iraqi forces and rebels throughout the spring and summer of 2004, and has fallen essentially under guerrilla control. Local leaders blame the detention of over 200 Buhriz residents as provoking further hostility. Yet in a shocking change of events in April 2007 and after the town was taken by al-Qaeda, the locals of the town had an agreement with the U.S. force in the area; it simply stated that they're going to help Americans kill and capture all of those who are associated with Al-Qaeda, in exchange U.S. forces will help them return safely to their homes that were taken by Al-Qaeda; this was the beginning of a great change in the balance of forces that led eventually to the full control over Diyala province by U.S. and Iraqi forces. History Buhriz may be the site of the medieval city of Bajisra. Its modern name is probably in honor of Mujahid ad-Din Buhriz, the engineer who in made the last serious effort to repair and re-open the nearby Nahrawan Canal in 1140. Adams, Robert M. (1965).

Despite his name, he was not related to Wail al-Shehri nor Waleed al-Shehri, brothers who boarded American Airlines Flight 11 to hijack it as part of the attacks. A Saudi, Shehri was a former college student who dropped out after failing his courses. He later left his home to fight in Chechnya in 2000, but was probably diverted to Al- Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan. It was during that time that he would be chosen to take part in the attacks in America. He received a U.S. student visa in October 2000. Shehri arrived in the United States in May 2001. On September 11, 2001, Shehri boarded United Airlines Flight 175 and assisted in its hijacking so that it could be flown into the South Tower of the World Trade Center.

The company also developed the world's first \\"off-road\\" vehicle for the Egyptian government, and another designed to travel on ice and snow for Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition to the South Pole. History George Johnston was by training a locomotive engineer from Neilson, Reid and Company Limited of Springburn, Glasgow. Johnston was commissioned by Glasgow Corporation Tramways in 1894 to build an experimental steam-powered tramcar to replace their fleet of horse-drawn trams. During a final test before a Corporation committee, it caught fire and work was abandoned. Johnston's attention was then turned to a detailed examination of continental makes of motor cars and he came to the conclusion that he could design and make a better vehicle than any of them and, in particular, a better engine. The first British-built motor car was thus conceived and by the end of 1895 was ready for financial backing. In the autumn of that year Johnston was joined by Norman Osborne Fulton and T. Blackwood Murray. Fulton was Johnston's cousin and was made responsible for manufacture and assembly, while Murray had electrical engineering experience, having been Works Manager with Mavor and Coulson, makers of mining machinery in Bridgeton. His first task was the development of electrical ignition in place of the incandescent platinum tubes of the Daimler engine. George Johnston had an experimental vehicle on the roads in November 1895, and there was an account in the Scotsman of a 3 hour journey in it, reputed to be the first Auto-Car to be seen in Scotland.The \\"Horseless Carriage\\" in Scotland, The Scotsman, 13 Nov 1895, p7 The driving of a horseless carriage in Glasgow resulted in a prosecution under the Locomotive Amendment Act of 1878, where George Johnston conducted his own defence arguing that the vehicle was registered as a carriage and did not fit the definition of locomotive in the act.The Horseless Carriage in Glasgow, Edinburgh Evening News, 23 January 1896, p3 While he lost his case and was given a nominal fine, there was growing pressure to amend the so called 'red flag acts' that were holding back British motor vehicle development, and later that year the passing of the Locomotives on Highways Act 1896 allowed motor vehicles to travel at as much as 12mph. =Mo-Car Syndicate= In 1895 Johnston formed a joint venture with Sir William Arrol MP, an engineer of the Forth Bridge to form the Mo-Car Syndicate Limited, which was to produce his car. Sir William was Chairman and Johnston was Managing Director, and the Syndicate included a Mr. Archibald Coats with a Mr P M Coats of Paisley, and a Mr. John Millar also of Paisley,New Companies. The Automotor and Horseless Vehicle Journal January 1899 while Norman Fulton was Works Manager. Sir William's main interest in the business was as the financial backer. The first Arrol-Johnston car was a six- seater \\"Dogcart\\" (a vehicle with two transverse seats placed back to back), which went into production at a factory at Camlachie, in the East End of Glasgow. The 1905 Arrol-Johnston opposed-piston twin cylinder engine The Dogcart was a wood-bodied vehicle powered by a 10 hp 2 cylinder opposed piston engine mounted beneath the floor, which was started by pulling on a rope. The vehicle boasted chain final drive and its high-wheeled, solid-tyred, horse- carriage type of body was retained well into the 1900s. The brakes were arranged in the form of shoes which could be pressed on the back of the solid rear tyres, and the suspension comprised full elliptic leaf springs at the front, and half-elliptics at the rear. Transmission and brake control levers were mounted close to the driver's right hand. The company's Camlachie premises were destroyed by fire in 1901, and production was moved to Paisley. In 1902 William Beardmore took the largest single shareholding in the company, creating a captive customer for his iron and steel components. He later became Chairman when A-J (as it was widely known) became a public company. A-J was restructured financially in 1903. New finance, mainly from Beardmore, became available, Beardmore wishing to help the firm stave off bankruptcy, and there were important changes in staff, including the arrival of J.S. Napier as Chief Engineer. George Johnston left as a result of a disagreement and founded the All British Car Company, a venture that was to be short-lived. A-J became effectively a wholly owned subsidiary of William Beardmore and Company =Arrol-Johnston Car Company Ltd.= 3-cylinder car from 1904, on display in Paris. In 1905 the company's name was changed to the Arrol-Johnston Car Company Ltd. They had a 4.5-acre well-equipped factory in Paisley, and it was said they made everything there for their vehicles excepting a few specialised items such as springs, tyres and lamps - they even made their own magnetos.The New Arrol-Johnston Petrol Car - Part 1, The Automotor Journal, 18 Nov 1905, pp1409-1410 In the same year, the company introduced a 3023cc 12/15hp model of more modern appearance; this, however, still used an opposed-piston engine producing 12bhp at 800rpm and 15bhp at 1100rpm. There was also a three- cylinder version of the dogcart; this was an uncouth 16 hp with the centre cylinder being of greater bore than the outer two. A 1905 Dogcart with solid wooden disc wheels still survives in Khartoum, inside the Sudan national museum, where it was supplied as a searchlight tender for the Sirdar of Egypt. Also announced at the 1905 Olympia show was the new 24/30 hp vertical four of 4654cc; followed in 1907 by the 38/45 hp of 8832 cc. In 1907 Arrol-Johnston were engaged to produce a car for the British South Polar Expedition,The Polar Expedition Motor Car, The Scotsman, 21st Feb 1907, p10 and it did make it to Antarctica, though it was of limited use except on hard ice, so it was restricted to the base camp areas. The car was an alcohol-fuelled air-cooled version of the 12-15hp model.A Magnificent Feat, The Newcastle Daily Chronicle, 25 Mar 1909, p5 The 12/15 hp twin survived in production until 1909. This was the year that T. C. Pullinger (formerly of Darracq, Sunbeam and Humber) joined Arrol-Johnston; he swept out the old range in favour of the new 15¬∑9 hp of 2835cc. That model featured a dashboard radiator and four-wheel brakes (the latter were dropped in 1911). For 1912 a 1794 cc 11¬∑9 hp, a 3640 cc 20¬∑9 hp and a 3618 cc 23¬∑8 hp were introduced. Former Arrol-Johnston factory, Heathhall In 1913 Arrol Johnston bought land at Heathhall, just outside Dumfries, and commissioned an American firm to build a factory. This is said to be the first factory in Britain to use ferro-concrete (concrete reinforced with metal bars), and was designed by Albert Kahn, architect of the Ford factory at Highland Park, Michigan, where the Model T was produced. A-J contracted to build 50 electric cars for Anderson Electric, maker of the Detroit Electric, at the new plant but it is not certain how many were actually made. Several models of car including the six-cylinder 23/9 were built up to the outbreak of war. The first post war Arrol-Johnston was the Victory model in 1919 designed by G. W. A. Brown which had an ohc 2651 cc 4-cylinder engine of 40 hp. They introduced the model to agents in March 1919 but the first production car was not delivered until August; it was sold to the Prince of Wales. The Victory sadly proved \\"unsellable and unreliable\\", and broke down while on a Royal tour of the West of England, so that the publicity attending its debut was not of the kind it needed.Baldwin, Nick, \\"A-Z of Cars of the 1920s\\", Bay View Books, Bideford, Devon, 1998 It was soon replaced by a modernized version of the prewar 15¬∑9 hp; it was cheaper, but this was due to such cost-cutting measures as a black-painted radiator and fixed ignition. The 15¬∑9 hp was revived as an urgent replacement for the Victory. A more modern version, the 20 hp, was introduced alongside the 15.9 hp in 1922. Advert from Pears' Annual Christmas 1921 In 1921 the cheaper Galloway was launched as, in theory, a separate make, from the Tongland works near Kirkcudbright. The car was based on the Fiat 501 and started with the 10/20 with a 1460 cc side-valve engine, in 1925 growing to the 1669 cc 12/20 and 12/30. Production moved to the main A-J factory in Heathhall in 1922. A short- lived 14 hp appeared in 1924, only to be replaced the following year by a 12¬∑3 hp model. There also was a 4-cylinder 3290cc Empire model manufactured for the colonies. =Arrol-Aster= In 1927 Arrol-Johnston were merged with Aster of Wembley, London to form the combined marque of Arrol-Aster, with directors from both Arrol-Johnston and Aster. The 15.9 hp was retained as were the two current Asters. Both the latter were given Burt-McCollum single sleeve valve engines in the interests of silence, but the 21/60 hp Aster was also available in its original ohv form, renamed the Arrol-Aster. Another completely new Arrol-Aster was the 2.5-litre 6-cylinder 17/50 hp with sleeve valves. The 21/60 hp Arrol-Aster and the 15.9 hp Arrol-Johnston were dropped for 1929, and a straight-8 Arrol-Aster substituted. It had a 3.3-litre sleeve valve engine consisting of the 17/50 unit with two extra cylinders and was available in supercharged form. This was a fast car intended as a sports model, but unlike the French sleeve-valve designs it could not produce high outputs as revolutions were limited. The company lasted for two years before the company went into receivership. Limited production and sales continued until 1931. Football Arrol-Johnston ran a works football team. In 1919 the football club was one of three clubs in Dumfries that merged to form Queen of the South F.C. The most notable players at Arrol-Johnston were Dave Halliday and Ian Dickson. Both then played for Queen of the South before going on to top score for their respective clubs in the top division in England. Halliday in particular had a highly successful goal-scoring career becoming one of the most prolific scorers in both UK and world football history. He then became a trophy-winning manager.Queens Legends career profiles of Dave Halliday and Ian Dickson See also *All-British *Aster *Arrol-Aster *Galloway (car) *Ateliers de Construction Mecanique l'Aster References External links *https://web.archive.org/web/20040812085725/http://www.britishmm.co.uk/history.asp?id=65 (Arrol-Johnston) *https://web.archive.org/web/20040814061602/http://www.britishmm.co.uk/history.asp?id=64 (Arrol-Aster) *http://autoclassic.com/features/classic_car_history/arrol_johnston_dogcart.html *https://www.flickr.com/photos/striderv/4300298265/ 1920 15.9 2-door tourer Category:Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers of Scotland Category:Companies based in Dumfries and Galloway Category:Renfrewshire Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1896 Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies disestablished in 1931 Category:1896 establishments in Scotland Category:1931 disestablishments in Scotland Category:History of Dumfries and Galloway Category:Veteran vehicles Category:Vintage vehicles ","title":"Arrol-Johnston"},{"id":"857760","text":"S.H. Arnolt Inc. of Chicago and Warsaw, Indiana sold four different manufacturer's cars with Bertone bodies during the period 1953 to 1968. Stanley H. \\"Wacky\\" Arnolt was a Chicago industrialist, who began importing foreign cars in the 1950s to the United States. Though sold as American cars, the cars were true hybrids, with British mechanicals, Italian bodywork, and U.S. sales and distribution, as well as in some cases final assembly and body work. S.H. Arnolt Inc. was a licensed automobile manufacturer in the State of Illinois. A fortuitous meeting with Bertone at the Turin Auto Show in 1952 resulted in four collaborative efforts between Arnolt and Bertone. Arnolt- MG 1955 Arnolt-MG 1955 Arnolt-MG The first was the Arnolt-MG, a four-seater Bertone-bodied car based on the MG TD chassis and XPAG 54hp engine. The Arnolt MG was designed by Giovanni Bertone, his son Nuccio, and Giovanni Michelotti. Of a planned production of 200 cars, 103 have been documented as built between 1953 and 1954 (67 coupes and 36 convertibles). Out of this total, the whereabouts of 36 are unknown and three are known to have been scrapped (as of 1993). The initial price was $3145. In 1954, MG informed Arnolt that it could no longer supply chassis and engines due to demand for its own complete cars (as well as the replacement of the TD by the TF), so Arnolt began looking for a larger-engined car. Arnolt-Aston 1953 Arnolt-Aston Martin DB2/4 Spyder (LML50/502) An attempt to build a Bertone-bodied Aston Martin DB2/4 roadster and sell it as an Arnolt-Aston was stopped by Aston Martin after three cars were built. There were three Arnolt-Astons designed by Bertone's fresh new designer - Franco Scaglione (chassis numbers LML50/502, LML 50/505 and LML 50/507). All looked very much like Scaglione's subsequent Arnolt-Bristol, having sharply creased fender lines, and were open cars without hardtops. There were four additional Bertone Astons that were commissioned at Arnolt's request and went through Arnolt's hands. These four cars are sometimes mistakenly referred to as Arnolt-Astons, but are not. These were 3 roadsters and 1 coup√©. All of the seven Arnolt-Astons still exist. One article refers to a possible eighth car, perhaps destroyed in the Chicago fire at Arnolt's factory. The cars were fitted with Aston's 125 hp, 2580 cc engine. Arnolt's Bentley Arnolt-Bentley Arnolt also had Bertone design and build a Bentley, which resembles a larger version of the Arnolt-MG Soup√© because it was also penned by Giovanni Michelotti who was working for Bertone at the time. This car was commissioned for S.H. Arnolt as a personal car. Bertone built the body on a 1953 R Type Continental chassis. The car was fitted with monogrammed flasks and glasses, and a special cosmetics compartment for Mrs. Arnolt. The car was originally painted gold and fitted with tan hides. Arnolt-Bristol 1954 Arnolt-Bristol Arnolt then negotiated with Bristol Cars Ltd in the UK for the purchase of 200 of their 404-series chassis and the 1971 cc, six-cylinder 130 hp engines from the earlier 403 model. Arnolt needed to find a new chassis source to meet his obligation to Bertone, in whom he had invested heavily, after MG proved unable to fill the original order for 200 cars. The chassis Bristol supplied were sent to Carrozzeria Bertone where they received a highly aerodynamic body with a flowing design that allowed the minimal hood height to clear the cars' three single barrel Solex 32 carburetors. The bodies were designed by Bertone's new designer/aerodynamicist, Franco Scaglione (soon to be famous as the designer of the Alfa Romeo B.A.T. concept cars). The very tall Bristol engine created problems for designing a sleek-looking sports car. Franco Scaglione handled these with particular genius - first by incorporating a hood scoop to lower the surrounding sheet metal, and then by incorporating sharply creased fender lines out over the wheels to draw the eye's attention away from the unusually tall peak in the hood. A few design changes were requested by S.H. Arnolt. Arnolt created a racing team for the Sebring 12-hour race, and in 1955, at their first attempt, the special lightweight cars finished first, second and fourth in the Sports 2000 class, winning the Team Trophy, a feat which was replicated in 1956 and 1960. The following year they took second and third in class. In 1957 the team withdrew after Bob Goldich's fatal accident on the first lap of his first stint in the car co-driven by Wacky Arnolt,\\"1957 Sebring 12 Hours from Bob Ballenger\\" Champion Motorsports April 3, 2008.

Retrieved on April 12, 2008. Arnolt Bristol deluxe (1958) The cars were available in four body styles: competition‚Äîa stripped road racer; bolide‚Äîa slightly better-appointed road racer; deluxe‚Äîa better-appointed version of the bolide (side windows and convertible top, instruments mounted in a housing in front of the driver, glove box set in the dash); and coup√©, with pop-up headlights. At least one open car was subsequently fitted with a removable hardtop by S.H. Arnolt. Prices as per a 1956 factory letter were $3995 for the competition model, $4245 for the bolide, $4995 for the deluxe and $5995 for the coupe. Factory options for the Arnolt-Bristol included a front sway bar, remote shifter, 11-inch Alfin drum brakes, convertible top, bumpers, Borrani KO steel wheels (nine sets were sold, and one car was sold with Borrani wire wheels) and several different rear end gear ratios. A special racing fuel tank was installed in some of the race cars but was never offered for sale to the public. Late in 1959 and 60, the 12-inch bell-shaped Bristol drum setup was offered, and in 1961 Bristol front disc brakes were offered to retro fit to the Arnolt-Bristol. The majority of the cars had steel bodies, with aluminum trunk and hood. The cars came with an owner's manual, spares manual and shop workbook, as well as a spare wheel and tire and complete tool kit. Additional items such as Arnolt key fobs, neck ties, ice buckets and Arnolt logo head scarves were available from the company. A wide variety of promotional literature, including brochures and postcards, was also produced. All of the cars were originally sold with Bristol BS1 MkII six-cylinder engines; some have subsequently been fitted with other engines. All Arnolt-Bristols were built between January 14, 1953 and December 12, 1959. The majority were built in 1954 and 1959. A total of 142 cars were produced, of which 12 were written off after a factory fire. The fire-damaged cars were used as a source of spares by Arnolt in later years. The total production included six coupes, and two aluminum alloy-bodied cars. One of the cars was originally right hand drive: the rest were all left hand drive. One of the cars never received a body, and was used as a rolling chassis for auto shows. This chassis is still in the possession of the Arnolt family. Approximately 85 of the cars are still known to be extant, in conditions that vary from needing complete restoration to concours quality. Despite the racing successes, the cars did not sell well. Some of the cars did not sell until after 1960, and the last car to be sold, fitted with four headlights, remained unsold until 1968. =Common Misconceptions= A number of published sources have contained errors on the production numbers of the Arnolt-Bristol. In part, this may be because some authors production or sales figures have been compared to existing copies of the S.H. Arnolt sales ledger. It is important to note that this ledger only records sales of the cars in the United States. As a result, European sales were not included. One result is that several sources claim only three coupes were built, when there were in fact six: one was sold in France and the other two in Spain (the chassis numbers of all of which are recorded in the Bristol Owner's Club registry). At the Paris Auto Show in 1955, an up-and-coming actor, Lee Marvin, saw the Arnolt-Bristol coupe and purchased it. In later years, Marvin would win the Oscar for Best Actor, and after his death, his ultra-rare Arnolt-Bristol Coupe (the only Arnolt ever built with the coved front fenders that would inspire the Corvette designers) sold at auction for $451,000. A second misconception is that the cars were originally fitted with any engines other than the Bristol six-cylinder. All Arnolt-Bristols were originally sold with the Bristol engine; S.H. Arnolt did not fit any other engines. In later years, thanks to the spacious engine compartment, a variety of larger engines such as American V8s have been fitted to individual cars. A third misconception is that S.H. Arnolt built the cars. The Arnolt-Bristol was built in Filton as a powered chassis; the body was fitted by Bertone in Italy, and only final assembly, fitting of options, prep work and (occasionally) paint and upholstery changes were done in Warsaw, Indiana.

Situated in the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Voivodeship, it is the county seat of the ≈Åƒôczyca County.  Origin of the Name  The town was probably named after a West Slavic (Lechitic) tribe called Leczanie, which inhabited central Poland in the early Middle Ages. Some scholars however claim that the town was named after an Old Polish word ≈Çƒôg, which means a swampy plain. In medieval Latin documents, ≈Åƒôczyca is called Lonsin, Lucic, Lunciz, Lantsiza, Loncizia, Lonsitia and Lunchicia. In the early 12th century, Gallus Anonymus called ≈Åƒôczyca ‚ÄúLucic‚Äù, and in 1154, Arab geographer Muhammad al- Idrisi named it Nugrada, placing it among other main towns of the Kingdom of Poland, such as Krak√≥w, Sieradz, Gniezno, Wroc≈Çaw and Santok.  Location  ≈Åƒôczyca lies in the middle of the county, and has the area of . In the past, the town was the capital of the Land of ≈Åƒôczyca, which was later turned into ≈Åƒôczyca Voivodeship. In the Second Polish Republic and in 1945 - 1975, ≈Åƒôczyca belonged to Lodz Voivodeship. In 1975-1998, it was part of Plock Voivodeship. The geometric centre of Poland is located near ≈Åƒôczyca.  History  The First Parliament in ≈Åƒôczyca, by Jan Matejko ≈Åƒôczyca is one of the oldest Polish cities, mentioned in the 12th century. It was the place of the first recorded meeting of Sejm, the Polish parliament, in 1182. In 1229 it became the capital of the Duchy of ≈Åƒôczyca (see Testament of Boleslaw III Wrymouth), which in 1263 was split into two parts - the Duchy of ≈Åƒôczyca and the Duchy of Sieradz. In the early 14th century, the ≈Åƒôczyca Voivodeship was created. This administrative unit of the Kingdom of Poland existed until the Partitions of Poland in the late 18th century. ≈Åƒôczyca, which lies in the centre of Poland, was for centuries one of the most important cities of the country. It received Magdeburg rights before 1267, and in 1331 the Teutonic Knights sacked the city during one of their repeated incursions into Poland. A considerable number of buildings were burned down, including two churches. A few decades later, on the initiative of Casimir the Great, the city was walled and a castle built to the southeast of the city. ≈Åƒôczyca prospered in the period between the mid-14th and mid-17th centuries. The royal castle, built by Casimir the Great, was located on a small hill, protected by a moat with water from the Bzura river. The complex was made from red brick, set on stone foundations. It was protected by a 10-meter high wall, with a tower located in its southwestern corner. Gate tower was placed in the western wall, in the basement was a prison, and in the courtyard there was a two-storey tenement building. Rooms of that building frequently housed meetings of the Royal Council. In 1964, widespread renovation of the complex began. Another building was added at that time, which now houses the Museum of the Land of ≈Åƒôczyca. Soon after its completion in the mid-14th century, the castle was named one of royal residences, and the seat of the Starosta of ≈Åƒôczyca. In 1406, it was burned by the Teutonic Knights, but the complex was rebuilt so quickly that in 1409, King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço attended here a meeting of his advisors, discussing the oncoming war with the Knights. Following the Battle of Grunwald (1410), a number of high-ranking Teutonic prisoners was kept here for ransom. Four sessions of the Sejm (Polish parliament) took place here: in 1420, 1448, 1454 i 1462. Furthermore, the castle served as headquarters of King Casimir IV Jagiellon, during the Thirteen Years' War (1454‚Äì66). At that time, the ≈Åƒôczyca Voivodeship was divided into three counties - Brzeziny, Orzel and ≈Åƒôczyca. In 1420, a Bohemian delegation offered here Czech crown to Jagie≈Ç≈Ço. The city's prominence came to an end with the Swedish invasion of Poland when the castle was overrun and most of the city once again destroyed, and it remained in a state of crisis until the Partitions. Following the invasion of Poland at the start of the Second World War, ≈Åƒôczyca was occupied by Nazi Germany and incorporated into the region known as Reichsgau Wartheland as part of the district (kreis) of Lentsch√ºtz (Germanized word for '≈Åƒôczyca'). In January 1942 there was a forced labor camp operating in or near the town.Zwangsarbeit im NS-Staat at German Federal Archive (Bundesarchiv) Accessed September 29, 2011. Jews had been an important part of the population of ≈Åƒôczyca since the late 1400s. At the beginning of the war in 1939, the Jewish population was more than 4000, about 30 percent of the community. The Germans began to terrorize, pillage, and humiliate the Jewish population from the beginning of the occupation. The Germans established a ghetto in late 1939, and later forbade any Jew to leave it on penalty of death. After the ghetto was enclosed, hunger and typhus ravaged the ghetto population. Periodically, hundreds of the community were expelled to other places, while Jews in other locations were brought to ≈Åƒôczyca. In April 1942, the remaining Jews, about 1700 people, were sent to the Chelmno death camp where they were immediately gassed. The local Poles took over their houses and what meager possessions they left behind. After the war it was reintegrated into the People's Republic of Poland.  Notable locations  250px 250px Because of its royal history ≈Åƒôczyca is probably more tourist-worthy than its current size might suggest. Some of the more interesting sights include: * The Royal Castle - originally dating from the 14th century, rebuilt from scratch after 1964. * The Church of St Andrew the Apostle‚Äîthe current church dates was consecrated in 1425. * The former Dominican monastery in Ul. Pocztowa (served as a prison from 1799 until 2006). Former political internees include W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Frasyniuk. * The Cistercian church and monastery in ul. Pozna≈Ñska, built between 1636-1643. * The defensive walls of ≈Åƒôczyca, some of which are still extant. The original walls enclosed an area of approximately 9 hectares, amounted to 1150 metres in length and 7 metres in height. The town plan is still recognisably that of a medieval town. A couple of kilometres away are the Collegiate church and the earthworks at the site of the medieval settlement of Tum.

For the 15th-century Jagiellon monarch, see W≈Çadys≈Çaw III of Poland, and for other monarchs with similar names see Ladislaus III (disambiguation). W≈Çadys≈Çaw III Spindleshanks (; b. 1161/67Kazimierz Jasi≈Ñski, Uzupe≈Çnienia do genealogii Piast√≥w, \\"Studia ≈πr√≥d≈Çoznawcze\\", vol. III, 1958, p. 202. ‚Äì 3 November 1231), of the Piast Dynasty, was Duke of Greater Poland (during 1194‚Äì1202 over all the land and during 1202‚Äì1229 only over the southern part), High Duke of Poland and Duke of Krak√≥w during 1202‚Äì1206 and 1228‚Äì1231, Duke of Kalisz during 1202‚Äì1206, ruler of Lubusz during 1206‚Äì1210 and 1218‚Äì1225, and ruler over Gniezno during 1216‚Äì1217. He was the fifth son of Mieszko III the Old, Duke of Greater Poland and since 1173 High Duke of Poland, but the third-born from his second marriage with Eudoxia, daughter of Grand Prince Iziaslav II of Kiev. The nickname \\"Spindleshanks\\" (Laskonogi) was given to W≈Çadys≈Çaw in the Chronicle of Greater Poland. Jan D≈Çugosz assumed that this was in reference to W≈Çadys≈Çaw's unusually long and thin legs.M. Przyby≈Ç, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Laskonogi, ksiƒÖ≈ºƒô wielkopolski 1202‚Äì1231, Pozna≈Ñ 1998, pp. 11‚Äì12. Under the rule of Mieszko III the Old The first appearance of W≈Çadys≈Çaw in contemporary sources was around 1168 in reference to the congress of Jƒôdrzej√≥w where, as a small child, he was a witness in a donation to the local Cistercian monastery. Between 1177 and 1179 W≈Çadys≈Çaw, his parents and siblings were forced to leave Poland as a result of the rebellion of Casimir II the Just and Odon, Mieszko III's eldest son from his first marriage, who resented the clear favoritism showed by his father to the offspring of his second marriage. W≈Çadys≈Çaw returned to his family only in 1181 and, despite being legally an adult, was not given his own district. Around 1186, W≈Çadys≈Çaw married Lucia, daughter of Jaromar I, Prince of R√ºgen. The union, whose principal purpose was to increase the influence of Mieszko III in Western Pomerania, was childless. After the death of W≈Çadys≈Çaw's half-brother Odon on 20 April 1194, W≈Çadys≈Çaw assumed the control of the Duchy in Southern Greater Poland (the Obra River), as guardian of his minor nephew W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic (son of Odon, born ca. 1190). On 13 September 1195, the death of his only surviving brother Boles≈Çaw in the bloody Battle of MozgawƒÖ left W≈Çadys≈Çaw as the sole heir of Mieszko III, and he began trying to restore the lands controlled by his father in the Duchy of Krak√≥w and to assume the overlordship of Poland. Duke of Krak√≥w and Greater Poland Mieszko III died on 13 March 1202. W≈Çadys≈Çaw could succeeded his father without barriers in Krak√≥w, Greater and Lesser Poland, thanks to the support of the powerful voivode Miko≈Çaj Gryfita. However, an opponent soon arose to the throne of Krak√≥w: the eldest son of Casimir II the Just, Leszek I the White, but his candidacy collapsed because he based its rule on the count palatine Goworek, who was a stubborn enemy of the voivode Miko≈Çaj. Loss of the Krak√≥w throne W≈Çadys≈Çaw's rule as Duke of Krak√≥w and High Duke of Poland lasted for four years, until 1206, when, after the death of his principal supporter voivode Miko≈Çaj Gryfita, Leszek I the White returned to the capital. The cause of the rebellion was a tough enforcement of rights against the powerful nobility and the alliance with the Pomeranians. Some historians placed the loss of Krak√≥w by W≈Çadys≈Çaw in an earlier period: a few months after the death of his father in 1202. In the absence of sources for this period, however, this fact is difficult to verify. Plans to restore Polish suzerainty over Pomerania Interest in the Pomeranian affairs, W≈Çadys≈Çaw was involved in two events. The first was a solemn meeting with King Valdemar II of Denmark, during which attempted to resolve disputes and determine the zone of influence. The second event was a surprising agreement with the Duke of Wroclaw, Henry I the Bearded, under which W≈Çadys≈Çaw surrendered the Duchy of Kalisz (part of the patrimony of his nephew W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic) in exchange of Lubusz, whereby it was easier to pursue an active policy on the Baltic coast. But in 1209 W≈Çadys≈Çaw lost Lubusz, taken by Conrad II of Landsberg, Margrave of Lusatia (his brother-in-law), who defeated the Duke in the Battle of Lubusz. Eventuality Henry I the Bearded, in the campaign between August 1210 and March 1211 could take Lubusz from the Germans, using the confusion after the death of Conrad II (6 May 1210) and the disputes about his heritage among the members of the House of Wettin. Conflicts with Archbishop Henry Kietlicz and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic The lost of Kalisz, putting into foreign hands, caused a deep dissatisfaction in W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic, who considered this land as part of his patrimony. The young prince (at that time around 16 years) managed to gain the support of the Greater Poland nobles and foremost the Archbishop of Gniezno, Henry Kietlicz, who wanted the opportunity to obtain from Spindleshanks privileges for the local Church and thus limit the power of the ruling house. However, despite the efforts of both Odonic and Archbishop Kietlicz, the rebellion was short-lived and unsuccessful. Both Kietlicz and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic had to flee to the court of Henry I the Bearded. The excommunication launched by Kietlicz against Spindleshanks was from little help to the insurgents, because of the support given to Mieszko III's son by Arnold II, Bishop of Pozna≈Ñ. Somewhat surprising was the reaction to these events by Henry I the Bearded, who not only accepted the exiles, but also endowed W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic with the Duchy of Kalisz, however, with the condition to return to him after he regained his inheritance. At the same time, the Archbishop Kietlicz went to Rome, where he had a personal meeting with Pope Innocent III. The protest made to the Holy See successfully blocked the attempt to appeal the curse made by Spindleshanks. The Pope also instructed the other Polish princes to help the Archbishop of Gniezno in returning to his diocese. Congress of G≈Çog√≥w and reconciliation with Archbishop Kietlicz Henry I the Bearded became a mediator between the warring parties, and on Christmas Day of 1208 he invited the two Greater Poland Dukes, the Archbishop of Gniezno and the Bishops of Wroclaw, Lubusz and Pozna≈Ñ to a meeting in G≈Çog√≥w. After long discussions, a settlement was finally reached between Spindleshanks and the Archbishop Kietlicz, who could return to Gniezno with all his goods restored, in exchange for lifting the anathema against the Duke. However, the conflict between uncle and nephew remained unsolved. Congress of Borzykowa In 1210 Spindleshanks supported the efforts of Mieszko I Tanglefoot, who wanted the restitution of the Testament of Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth, under which the Silesian branch are the rightful overlords of Poland. At this point, W≈Çadys≈Çaw was probably the immediate oldest member of the Piast dynasty after Mieszko I, and therefore, he certainly expect that after the imminent death of the venerable Duke of Racib√≥rz he could receive the title of High Duke and the Duchy of Krak√≥w. However, according to some historians, Henry I the Bearded was older than Spindleshanks. This was most probable, and was reflected in the bull issued by Pope Innocent III on 9 June 1210, where the Holy See demanded the restitution of all the hereditary rights of the Silesian branch according to Boles≈Çaw III's testament and also excommunicated Leszek I the White; this edict was made by the request of an anonymous Duke of Silesia, which could have only been Henry I the Bearded (because Mieszko I used the title of Duke of Raciborz-Opole). The situation became quite confused, as nobody was sure who held the real power. In July 1210 Leszek I the White, Henry I the Bearded, Konrad I of Masovia and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic met with the local Bishops at the , with the purpose to solve the problematic and mysterious Papal Bull. Mieszko I Tanglefoot wasn't present at the meeting; with an army and thanks to the support of the Gryfici family, he could enter in Krak√≥w and easily took Wawel. However, Archbishop Kietlicz didn't intend to accept the existing situation, and having received from the young princes and the local Church hierarchy words of support, began his efforts in Rome to withdraw the fateful Bull. These treatments were successful, and when in May 1211 Mieszko I Tanglefoot died, Leszek I the White was able to return to the throne of Krak√≥w. The intentions of the older generation had failed. Early rise of Archbishop Kietlicz and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic In 1215 W≈Çadys≈Çaw Spindleshanks' position was further weakened by the growth of the power of Archbishop Henry Kietlicz, who supported the provisions of IV Lateran Council, and the subsequent congress of the Junior princes in Wolb√≥rz, where Leszek I the White, Konrad I of Mazovia, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic and Casimir I of Opole not only agreed to extend the economic and legal benefits for the Church, but also supported the claims of Odonic to obtain his rightful inheritance. Finally, in 1216, in order to avoid an armed confrontation, Spindleshanks gave Odonic the district who previously belonged to his father (the exact territory was a matter of dispute between historians: some believed that Odonic received Southern Greater Poland with the Obra River as frontier, and others consider that the young prince received the entire district of Pozna≈Ñ together with his castle). The agreement between uncle and nephew was confirmed by a Bull of Pope Honorius III issued on 9 February 1217. There has also been an official reconciliation with the Archbishop Kietlicz, who received the privilege from Spindleshanks to receive the revenues from the cistercian monastery of ≈Åekno. Fall of Archbishop Kietlicz and the Treaty with Leszek I the White The terms of the reconciliation accorded in 1216 lasted less than a year. The proud and ambitious attitude of Archbishop Kietlicz effectively discouraged his supporters and stopped his meddling in Piast Dukes affairs. His importance suffered a further decline after the defeat of the policies of Pope Honorius III. In 1217 an unexpected treaty was concluded between the previous antagonists Leszek I the White and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Spindleshanks, under which if one or both rulers died without male issue, the other could inherit all his domains. This agreement clearly affected the interests of the Duke of Kalisz W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic, Spindleshanks' nearest male relative. Deposition of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic In the same year the Duke of Greater Poland took advantage from the benevolent neutrality of Henry I the Bearded and finally decided to resolve the conflict with Odonic and took the district of his nephew, forcing him to flee the country. The formal alliance between Spindleshanks and Henry I the Bearded (similar to the previous agreement with Leszek I the White) took place at the end of 1217 or early 1218, during an assembly in SƒÖdowel, through the mediation of the Bishops Pawe≈Ç II of Pozna≈Ñ and Wawrzyniec of Lubusz. For unknown reasons, the content of the arrangements was beneficial only to the Duke of Greater Poland, who not only received the permission to retain Odonic's district (which included parts of Kalisz, who under the agreement of 1206, was returned to Silesia), but also obtain the district of Lubusz (captured in 1209 by the Margrave of Lusatia Conrad II but recovered by Henry I the Bearded one year later) during his lifetime. The agreement of SƒÖdowel was ratified by a special papal bull issued on 9 May 1218, which further broke down the power of Archbishop Kietlicz. The first test of the Triumvirate (W≈Çadys≈Çaw III Spindleshanks, Henry I the Bearded and Leszek I the White) was the death in 1219 of Archbishop Henry Kietlicz and the common choice for the post of Archbishop, the chancellor Wincenty z Nia≈Çka, one of Spindleshanks' closest associates. Return of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic Despite the many benefits of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Spindleshanks received in the congress of SƒÖdowel he didn't participate in a national campaign against the pagan Prussians. The reason for this were the actions of his nephew W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic, who, thanks to the hospitality and collaboration of Swantopolk II of Pomerania (probably Odonic's brother-in-law) began his struggle against the authority of his uncle. The situation worsened when, in October 1223, Odonic surprisingly attacked and managed to conquer the town of Uj≈õcie, and soon afterwards (in 1225) the adjacent district of Nak≈Ço. Spindleshanks' situation became more complicated after the loss of Lubusz in 1225, captured by Louis IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, who took advantage from the constants fights of the Greater Poland Duke with his nephew and could conquer this important territory. New phase in the War against W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic. Defeat at Uj≈õcie The decisive battle between uncle and nephew took place in 1227. Spindleshanks sent an army under the command of the voivode Dobrogost besieged Uj≈õcie, but he couldn't take the strong local fortress, and on 15 July, Odonic surprisingly attacked the voivode, who was completely defeated and killed. Thanks to this victory, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic was able to take control over almost all Greater Poland; however, Odonic's ally Swantopolk II unexpectedly broke the existing treaty, took Nak≈Ço and proclaimed himself Duke, ended his homage to Leszek I the White. Congress of GƒÖsawa and murder of Leszek I the White The alliance of his nephew with the Pomeranian ruler put Spindleshanks' rule in jeopardy, and he feared that he could lose the remain of his lands; so, he decided to make a pacific solution to his disputes with Odonic. On St. Martin's day (11 November) 1227 a solemn congress of Piast rulers, bishops and nobles in the small Kuyavian district of GƒÖsawa was convened, where this and others delicate issue were discussed in order to take further steps. In addition to the instigator of the reunion, Leszek I the White, were also present his brother Konrad I of Masovia, Henry I the Bearded, Wladyslaw Odonic (whose assistance is disputed by historians), the entire episcopate and numerous representatives of Polish magnate families. For unknown reasons, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Spindleshanks didn't appear in GƒÖsawa, although is believed that both Archbishop Wincenty of Gniezno and Bishop Pawe≈Ç II of Pozna≈Ñ watched his interests. Nobody expected the tragedy, which occurred on the morning of 24 November: during a short break between the deliberations in the town of Marcinkowo G√≥rne, a group of Pomeranians attacked both Leszek I the White and Henry I the Bearded; Leszek I was killed and Henry I severely wounded, but did survive. Contemporary sources and later historiography clearly recognize Swantopolk II as the crime's author. However, some historians believed that W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic was an accomplice, passing all the plans and conversations to the Pomeranian ruler during the congress (according to the most recent work of Tomasz Jurek). Historians speculated that in 1227 the hostility between the Duke of Pomerania and Odonic suddenly appeared after Swantopolk II took Nak≈Ço. According to the proponents of the view that Odonic participated in the GƒÖsawa crime, believed that the capture of Nak≈Ço was only a distraction from the true intentions of Swantopolk II and Odonic. There are also other versions from these events, but because of shortage of resources and ambiguity were several theories; also, there strong probabilities that W≈Çadys≈Çaw Spindleshanks was involved in Leszek I's death, because was him, and not Swantopolk II, who obtain the greatest benefits from the crime. Recovery of the Krak√≥w throne After the crime of GƒÖsawa W≈Çadys≈Çaw Spindleshanks turns directly to the offensive. At the beginning of next year and under unknown circumstances, the Duke of Greater Poland, with the help of Silesian troops, could defeat his nephew Odonic, who was taken prisoner. Spindleshanks then went to Lesser Poland, where he present his claim over the throne of Krak√≥w under the basis of the agreement of mutual succession between him and Leszek I the White signed in 1217. Although the Duke of Krak√≥w leave a one-year-old son, Boles≈Çaw V, it was clear that until he reached the proper age, the rule over Krak√≥w had to be taken over by someone else. At the same time, Leszek I's brother Konrad I of Masovia appears in Lesser Poland and also put his claim over the Krak√≥w throne. The formal election of the new High Duke of Poland was made at a meeting in Wi≈õlica on 5 May 1228, where most of the powerful nobles gathered around the Bishop of Krak√≥w, Iwo OdrowƒÖ≈º, the voivode Marek z Brze≈∫nicy, Governor of Krak√≥w and Pakos≈Çaw the Old, voivode of Sandomierz. There was rejected the candidacy of Konrad I of Masovia in favor of Spindleshanks. Congress of Cienia The choice of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Spindleshanks as High Duke wasn't unconditional choice, because during an assembly organized in Cienia Pierwsza he was compelled to sign two important documents. In the first, the Duke of Greater Poland ensured several privileges to the Church, and even expanded it. The second was about the infant son of Leszek I the White, Boles≈Çaw V: the new High Duke took over his guardianship and making him his general heir. At the same time he promised not introduce any new law without the consent of the nobility and clergy of Lesser Poland. In this way, for the first time, the royal power in Poland was made by election. Spindleshanks assumed the direct rule only over Krak√≥w: the authority over Sandomierz was handed by Boles≈Çaw V's mother Grzymislawa, although formally, because at the end remained under the control of the High Duke. Election of Henry I the Bearded as Governor of Krakow Unfortunately, the political situation soon turned against W≈Çadys≈Çaw Spindleshanks. His nephew W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic, defeated and imprisoned by him, could escape to P≈Çock and resume the war against him, which made the Duke of Greater Poland unable to prepare for the expected invasion against Konrad I of Masovia (who became now an ally of Odonic). Therefore, he decided with the approval of Krak√≥w citizens (led by the powerful families of OdrowƒÖ≈º and Gryfici), to choose Silesian Duke Henry I the Bearded as ruler of the city, but only with the title of governor. Spindleshanks concession was given probably for the military support that Henry I give to him; in addition, the Silesian Duke obtain the promise of inheritance over Greater Poland, which was indeed a violation of the provisions contained in the Congress of Cienia, where Spindleshanks declared that Boles≈Çaw V was his heir. War against Konrad I of Masovia and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic Konrad I's military attack on Lesser Poland took place in the summer of 1228. The expedition, however, didn't bring success, because he was surprisingly attacked by Prince Henry, eldest son and heir of Henry I the Bearded, who successfully defeated the Masovian Duke in the Battles of Miƒôdzyborzem, Ska≈ÇƒÖ and Wrociery≈ºem. Konrad didn't give up and one year later he again started military operations, this time with better results, especially after the capture and imprisonment of Henry I after a supposed meeting in Spytkowice; this event successfully paralyzed the opponents of his late brother Leszek the White and Konrad managed to control most of Lesser Poland, although he released Henry I from captivity thanks to the efforts of his wife Hedwig of Andechs. Immediately, he deprived his nephew Boles≈Çaw V from the Duchy of Sandomierz and invested his own son Boles≈Çaw with this land. Shortly thereafter, Konrad I and his ally Odonic began the direct war against Spindleshanks. Konrad I unsuccessfully besieged Kalisz, despite the help of Russian troops. Spindleshanks, too busy in his fight against Odonic in the north, couldn't came in time to aid the city; however, the powerful city walls were too much for the Silesian Duke, who was forced to withdraw. Defeat and Escape Spindleshanks was soon defeated by his nephew under unknown circumstances, and forced to flee at the court of Duke Casimir I of Opole in Racib√≥rz. The deposition of young Boles≈Çaw V by his uncle was the excuse for Henry I to attack the Masovian Duke. Spindleshanks also took advantage of this, and renewed his alliance with the Silesian Duke, with the formally transfer of all his rights over both Greater and Lesser Poland to Henry I. Last attempt to recover Greater Poland In the spring of 1231 Henry I made his last expedition with Spindleshanks against W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic. Despite initial success, thanks to the help gave by Pawe≈Ç, Bishop of Pozna≈Ñ, and Greater Poland noble families Na≈Çƒôcz√≥w, ≈Åabƒôdzi√≥w and Nia≈Çk√≥w, ended in failure at the walls of Gniezno. Mysterious death and succession The expedition against his nephew Odonic was the last political activity of Spindleshanks. Following the information of medieval sources, although not properly confirmed by other sources of information, the demise of the former Duke of Greater Poland was under scandalous circumstances. According to the chronicles from the Cistercian French monk Alberic of Trois-Fontaines the almost seventy-years-old Spindleshanks was murdered in ≈öroda ≈ölƒÖska by a German girl whom he tried to rape. According some historians the story is not about W≈Çadys≈Çaw Laskonogi, but his nephew W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic. Another source who confirm the unworthy conduct of Spindleshanks came from Jan D≈Çugosz, who wrote that in the last year of his life his subjects despised him because of his \\"fornication with prostitutes\\". The date of death of W≈Çadys≈Çaw III Spindleshanks was generally placed on 3 November 1231 (another proposed date, 18 August, was suggested only by Jan D≈Çugosz, wasn't confirmed, and is rejected by historians). It is not known where he was buried. Some researchers, based on the information that the Duke died in exile, believes that W≈Çadys≈Çaw III Spindleshanks was buried in Silesia, perhaps in Racib√≥rz.M. Przyby≈Ç, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Laskonogi, ksiƒÖ≈ºƒô wielkopolski 1202‚Äì1231, Pozna≈Ñ 1998, pp. 160-162. Others, based on late chroniclers, assumes that he was buried in the Benedictine monastery in Lubin.M. Przyby≈Ç, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Laskonogi, ksiƒÖ≈ºƒô wielkopolski 1202‚Äì1231, Pozna≈Ñ 1998, p. 160. At his death, Henry I the Bearded, by virtue of the inheritance treaty, became the main claimant over both Greater and Lesser Poland, but his rights over this areas where soon contested and he had to fight to conquer both.

Mendez, Almeida, Pais, Lobo, e Lodulfo del P. M. Coronelli M.C. Cosmografo della Seren. Rep. di Ventia\\"--Vincenzo Coronelli (1690) With the intention of proceeding to Ethiopia, whose N…ôgus√§ n√§g√§st Susenyos I had been converted to Roman Catholicism by Pedro P√°ez, he left India in 1624. He struggled to overcome the difficulty that Ethiopia controlled none of the northern coastline, first disembarking at Pate and attempted to reach his destination along the Jubba River through country controlled by the Oromo, but was forced to return. Then in 1625 he set out again, accompanied by Afonso Mendes, the Catholic Patriarch of Ethiopia, and eight missionaries, landing at Beilul, a port on the coast of the Red Sea controlled by the king of the Afars, vassal to the Emperor of Ethiopia. After a month spent crossing the desert into the Ethiopian highlands, the party reached Fremona, where Lobo assumed the responsibilities of superintendent of the missions in Tigray. His other activities included recovering the remains of Crist√≥v√£o da Gama, who had been captured and executed by Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi in 1542, at the request of his great nephew Francisco da Gama, Conde da Vidigueira and Governor-general of India. He also served as a missionary to the southwest of Lake Tana, where he visited the source of the Blue Nile. The abdication of Emperor Susenyos (1632) deprived the Catholics of their protector; his successor, Fasilides, first confined them once again at Fremona, then in 1634 Lobo and his companions were exiled from Ethiopia, who were exposed to robbery, assaults and other indignities by the local population before reaching the Ottoman Naib at Massawa. He sent them to his superior at Suakin, where the Pasha forced the party to pay a ransom before they could proceed to India. Despite settling for a ransom of 4300 patacas (which he borrowed from local Banyan merchants), at the last moment the Pasha insisted on keeping Patriarch Mendes and three other senior priests for further money. Once Lobo reached Diu, he left for Goa by canoe, arriving at the provincial capital on 8 December 1634. There he attempted to convince viceroy Miguel de Noronha, conde de Linhares to send an armament to the Red Sea to capture Suakin and Massawa, free the patriarch by force, and restore Catholicism to Ethiopia. Although the Viceroy was willing to make a punitive expedition against Suakin to free the Patriarch, he did not want to overextend Portuguese forces and garrison either port. Unwilling to settle for just freeing the patriarch, Lobo embarked for Portugal, and after he had been shipwrecked on the coast of Natal, then captured by pirates, he arrived at Lisbon. Neither at this city, however, nor at Madrid and Rome, was any approval given to Lobo's plan. He accordingly returned to India in 1640, and was elected rector, and afterwards provincial, of the Jesuits at Goa. After some years he returned to his native city, where he died.

He entered into a correspondence with Henry Oldenburg of the Royal Society concerning the source of the Nile, which likely led to the publication in London of a little book entitled A Short Relation of the River Nile, of its source and current; of its overflowing the campagnia of √Ügypt, till it runs into the Mediterranean and of other curiosities: written by an eye-witnesse, who lived many years in the chief kingdoms of the Abyssine Empire. Translated by Sir Peter Wyche. Gabriel Pereira reported in 1903 that he had found three short works in manuscript by Lobo in the library of the Duke of Palmela, and in 1966 Fr. Manuel Gon√ßalves da Costa discovered in the Ajuda library at Lisbon another short work of Lobo, Breve Not√≠cia e Rela√ß√£o de Algumas Cousas Certas n√£o vulgares, e dignas de se saberem, escritas e [sic] inst√¢ncia de Curiosos, which repeated the topics of A Short Relation. His best known work is his memoirs of the years 1622-1640, which cover his voyage to India, his experiences in Ethiopia, and his journey back to Portugal; his Itiner√°rio, however, was not published during his lifetime. Baltasar Teles made large use of Lobo's writing in his Hist√≥ria geral da Ethi√≥pia a Alta (Coimbra, 1660), often erroneously attributed to Lobo, but incorporated much from Manuel de Almeida's manuscript work. Lobo's own narrative was translated from a copy owned by the Count of Ericeira by the Abb√© Joachim le Grand into French in 1728, under the title of Voyage historique d'Abissinie. An English abridgment of Le Grand's edition by Dr. Samuel Johnson was published in 1735 (reprinted 1789). Fr. da Costa discovered another manuscript of Lobo's work in the Biblioteca P√∫blica at Braga in 1947. This was not the same manuscript that le Grand translated; both were copies, with variations, of the original autograph left at the Casa de S√£o Roque at the time of Lobo's death. The whole of this manuscript was translated by Donald M. Lockhart, and published with an introduction and notes by C.F. Beckingham by the Hakluyt Society in 1984.

It turns out that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle can be expressed as a lower bound on the sum of these entropies. This is stronger than the usual statement of the uncertainty principle in terms of the product of standard deviations. In 1957, Hirschman considered a function f and its Fourier transform g such that :g(y) \\\\approx \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\exp (-2\\\\pi ixy) f(x)\\\\, dx,\\\\qquad f(x) \\\\approx \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\exp (2\\\\pi ixy) g(y)\\\\, dy ~, where the \\"‚âà\\" indicates convergence in 2, and normalized so that (by Plancherel's theorem), : \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(x)^2\\\\, dx = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty g(y)^2 \\\\,dy = 1~. He showed that for any such functions the sum of the Shannon entropies is non-negative, : H(f^2) + H(g^2) \\\\equiv - \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(x)^2 \\\\log f(x)^2\\\\, dx - \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty g(y)^2 \\\\log g(y)^2 \\\\,dy \\\\ge 0. A tighter bound, was conjectured by Hirschman and Everett,Hugh Everett, III. The Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: the theory of the universal wave function. Everett's Dissertation proven in 1975 by W. Beckner and in the same year interpreted by as a generalized quantum mechanical uncertainty principle by Bia≈Çynicki-Birula and Mycielski. The equality holds in the case of Gaussian distributions. Note, however, that the above entropic uncertainty function is distinctly different from the quantum Von Neumann entropy represented in phase space. Sketch of proof The proof of this tight inequality depends on the so-called (q, p)-norm of the Fourier transformation. (Establishing this norm is the most difficult part of the proof.) From this norm, one is able to establish a lower bound on the sum of the (differential) R√©nyi entropies, , where , which generalize the Shannon entropies. For simplicity, we consider this inequality only in one dimension; the extension to multiple dimensions is straightforward and can be found in the literature cited. =Babenko‚ÄìBeckner inequality= The (q, p)-norm of the Fourier transform is defined to be :\\\\\\\\mathcal F\\\\_{q,p} = \\\\sup_{f\\\\in L^p(\\\\mathbb R)} \\\\frac{\\\\\\\\mathcal Ff\\\\_q}{\\\\f\\\\_p}, where 1 < p \\\\le 2~, and \\\\frac 1 p + \\\\frac 1 q = 1. In 1961, BabenkoK.I. Babenko. An inequality in the theory of Fourier integrals. Izv. Akad. Nauk SSSR, Ser. Mat. 25 (1961) pp. 531-542 English transl., Amer. Math. Soc. Transl. (2) 44, pp. 115-128 found this norm for even integer values of q. Finally, in 1975, using Hermite functions as eigenfunctions of the Fourier transform, Beckner proved that the value of this norm (in one dimension) for all q ‚â• 2 is :\\\\\\\\mathcal F\\\\_{q,p} = \\\\sqrt{p^{1/p}/q^{1/q}}. Thus we have the Babenko‚ÄìBeckner inequality that :\\\\\\\\mathcal Ff\\\\_q \\\\le \\\\left(p^{1/p}/q^{1/q}\\\\right)^{1/2} \\\\f\\\\_p. =R√©nyi entropy bound= From this inequality, an expression of the uncertainty principle in terms of the R√©nyi entropy can be derived.H.P. Heinig and M. Smith, Extensions of the Heisenberg‚ÄìWeil inequality. Internat. J. Math. & Math. Sci., Vol. 9, No. 1 (1986) pp. 185-192\\\\. Letting g=\\\\mathcal Ff, 2Œ±=p, and 2Œ≤=q, so that and 1/2<Œ±<1<Œ≤, we have :\\\\left(\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb R} g(y)^{2\\\\beta}\\\\,dy\\\\right)^{1/2\\\\beta} \\\\le \\\\frac{(2\\\\alpha)^{1/4\\\\alpha}}{(2\\\\beta)^{1/4\\\\beta}} \\\\left(\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb R} f(x)^{2\\\\alpha}\\\\,dx\\\\right)^{1/2\\\\alpha}. Squaring both sides and taking the logarithm, we get :\\\\frac 1\\\\beta \\\\log\\\\left(\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb R} g(y)^{2\\\\beta}\\\\,dy\\\\right) \\\\le \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\log\\\\frac{(2\\\\alpha)^{1/\\\\alpha}}{(2\\\\beta)^{1/\\\\beta}} \\\\+ \\\\frac 1\\\\alpha \\\\log \\\\left(\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb R} f(x)^{2\\\\alpha}\\\\,dx\\\\right). Multiplying both sides by :\\\\frac{\\\\beta}{1-\\\\beta}=-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{1-\\\\alpha} reverses the sense of the inequality, :\\\\frac {1}{1-\\\\beta} \\\\log\\\\left(\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb R} g(y)^{2\\\\beta}\\\\,dy\\\\right) \\\\ge \\\\frac\\\\alpha{2(\\\\alpha-1)}\\\\log\\\\frac{(2\\\\alpha)^{1/\\\\alpha}}{(2\\\\beta)^{1/\\\\beta}} \\\\- \\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\alpha} \\\\log \\\\left(\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb R} f(x)^{2\\\\alpha}\\\\,dx\\\\right) ~. Rearranging terms, finally yields an inequality in terms of the sum of the R√©nyi entropies, :\\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\alpha} \\\\log \\\\left(\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb R} f(x)^{2\\\\alpha}\\\\,dx\\\\right) \\\\+ \\\\frac {1}{1-\\\\beta} \\\\log\\\\left(\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb R} g(y)^{2\\\\beta}\\\\,dy\\\\right) \\\\ge \\\\frac\\\\alpha{2(\\\\alpha-1)}\\\\log\\\\frac{(2\\\\alpha)^{1/\\\\alpha}}{(2\\\\beta)^{1/\\\\beta}}; : H_\\\\alpha(f^2) + H_\\\\beta(g^2) \\\\ge \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\log\\\\alpha}{\\\\alpha-1}+\\\\frac{\\\\log\\\\beta}{\\\\beta-1}\\\\right) - \\\\log 2 ~. Note that this inequality is symmetric with respect to and : One no longer need assume that ; only that they are positive and not both one, and that 1/Œ± + 1/Œ≤ = 2. To see this symmetry, simply exchange the r√¥les of i and ‚àíi in the Fourier transform. =Shannon entropy bound= Taking the limit of this last inequality as Œ±, Œ≤ ‚Üí 1 yields the less general Shannon entropy inequality, :H(f^2) + H(g^2) \\\\ge \\\\log\\\\frac e 2,\\\\quad\\\\textrm{where}\\\\quad g(y) \\\\approx \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb R} e^{-2\\\\pi ixy}f(x)\\\\,dx~, valid for any base of logarithm, as long as we choose an appropriate unit of information, bit, nat, etc. The constant will be different, though, for a different normalization of the Fourier transform, (such as is usually used in physics, with normalizations chosen so that ƒß=1 ), i.e., :H(f^2) + H(g^2) \\\\ge \\\\log(\\\\pi e)\\\\quad\\\\textrm{for}\\\\quad g(y) \\\\approx \\\\frac 1{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}\\\\int_{\\\\mathbb R} e^{-ixy}f(x)\\\\,dx~. In this case, the dilation of the Fourier transform absolute squared by a factor of 2 simply adds log(2) to its entropy. Entropy versus variance bounds The Gaussian or normal probability distribution plays an important role in the relationship between variance and entropy: it is a problem of the calculus of variations to show that this distribution maximizes entropy for a given variance, and at the same time minimizes the variance for a given entropy. In fact, for any probability density function \\\\phi on the real line, Shannon's entropy inequality specifies: :H(\\\\phi) \\\\le \\\\log \\\\sqrt {2\\\\pi eV(\\\\phi)}, where H is the Shannon entropy and V is the variance, an inequality that is saturated only in the case of a normal distribution. Moreover, the Fourier transform of a Gaussian probability amplitude function is also Gaussian‚Äîand the absolute squares of both of these are Gaussian, too. This can then be used to derive the usual Robertson variance uncertainty inequality from the above entropic inequality, enabling the latter to be tighter than the former. That is (for ƒß=1), exponentiating the Hirschman inequality and using Shannon's expression above, :1/2 \\\\le \\\\exp (H(f^2)+H(g^2)) /(2e\\\\pi) \\\\le \\\\sqrt {V(f^2)V(g^2)}~. Hirschman explained that entropy‚Äîhis version of entropy was the negative of Shannon's‚Äîis a \\"measure of the concentration of [a probability distribution] in a set of small measure.\\" Thus a low or large negative Shannon entropy means that a considerable mass of the probability distribution is confined to a set of small measure. Note that this set of small measure need not be contiguous; a probability distribution can have several concentrations of mass in intervals of small measure, and the entropy may still be low no matter how widely scattered those intervals are. This is not the case with the variance: variance measures the concentration of mass about the mean of the distribution, and a low variance means that a considerable mass of the probability distribution is concentrated in a contiguous interval of small measure. To formalize this distinction, we say that two probability density functions \\\\phi_1 and \\\\phi_1 are equimeasurable if :\\\\forall \\\\delta > 0,\\\\,\\\\mu\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb R\\\\phi_1(x)\\\\ge\\\\delta\\\\\\\\} = \\\\mu\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb R\\\\phi_2(x)\\\\ge\\\\delta\\\\\\\\}, where is the Lebesgue measure. Any two equimeasurable probability density functions have the same Shannon entropy, and in fact the same R√©nyi entropy, of any order. The same is not true of variance, however. Any probability density function has a radially decreasing equimeasurable \\"rearrangement\\" whose variance is less (up to translation) than any other rearrangement of the function; and there exist rearrangements of arbitrarily high variance, (all having the same entropy.)

David had previously worked as a coal miner. At the age of 16, Stahl was sent to a boarding prep school near Philadelphia. He attended Columbia University. Post- college he traveled, living in Greece‚Äîin caves outside of Matala, on Crete, the streets of Paris, then London, where he landed a job as a bartender at an Irish pub. He later returned to America to live in New York City, where he became a writer. Career Stahl began publishing short fiction, won a Pushcart Prize in 1976, and made a living writing for magazines and doing porn stories for cash. One writing job as humor editor for Hustler meant moving to Columbus, Ohio and living at the YMCA until the magazine moved its headquarters to California. Stahl lost his job six months to the day after taking it and ended up on unemployment in California, alongside an escalating heroin dependency, which eventually led to his contracting hepatitis C. He would go on to become a writer for the 1980s TV series ALF, Thirtysomething, and Moonlighting. In 1990 he would also write an episode for Twin Peaks and Northern Exposure; his work on the former was described by series co-creator Mark Frost as \\"an absolute car wreck... He turned in a completely incomprehensible, unusable, incomplete script a few days late and as I recall there were blood stains on it.\\"Dukes, Bill. Reflections: An Oral History of Twin Peaks (Nashville: short/Tall Press 2014) p.188 He has also acted in seven films. Permanent Midnight, his 1995 memoir, was adapted by Stahl into a 1998 film of the same name starring Ben Stiller that raised Stahl's profile and set the stage for his ongoing work in film. He wrote the screenplay for Bad Boys II, which starred Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. His novels Perv: A Love Story and Plainclothes Naked enjoyed moderate success. I, Fatty, a fictional autobiography of legendary movie comedian Roscoe Arbuckle received a favorable review from Thomas Mallon in The New Yorker and attracted attention from a variety of national media. According to Stahl, Johnny Depp has optioned the film rights for I, Fatty. Stahl edited The Heroin Chronicles (Akashic Books 2013), a collection of stories by various authors. Stahl has also written a number of CSI episodes which deal with transgressive topics and have been some of the most controversial but also gained some of the highest ratings. He introduced the dominatrix character Lady Heather, who has appeared in a number of episodes, the first of which, \\"Slaves of Las Vegas\\", featured viewer discretion advisory warning, due to nudity and sexual content. Stahl has been criticised for his inaccurate portrayal of furries in \\"Fur and Loathing\\". However, while earlier episodes of CSI had been criticised for the treatment of transgender people, his episode \\"Ch-Ch-Changes\\" was highlighted as offering a sensitive portrayal of the topic. It also got the largest audience to date, 31.5 million, with his \\"King Baby\\" being the second most watched that season.

The set features a live concert performance by Amos from her 2002 \\"Scarlet's Walk\\" tour, in support of her album by the same name. It was recorded live at Sound Advice Amphitheatre in West Palm Beach, Florida. The DVD also features photographs and other exclusive material including a full-length interview with Amos. The title is a sarcastic reference to the fact that on September 4, 2003 (the day of filming) there was a rainstorm. Accompanying the DVD is an EP called Scarlet's Hidden Treasures, which features six non-LP tracks. The DVD/CD was released in either a double CD jewel case, or in a special DVD case. Some controversy was sparked when the words \\"fucker\\" and \\"cock\\" were censored out of the live performance of the song \\"Professional Widow\\". Amos, who is an avid anti-censorship proponent, explained in an interview that she felt it was important not to have a parental advisory sticker on the label so that young people would be able to have access to the DVD, as she touches on many important political issues in her works. Although not mentioned in the track listing, Amos sings the first four lines of \\"Muhammad My Friend\\" as a bridge for \\"Take to the Sky\\".

The organisation advanced a moderate programme of social reform legislation. In 1904 the SPM became one of the constituent units founding the Socialist Party of Canada, an organisation which continued until 1925. Establishment The Socialist Party of Manitoba was established in 1902.Peter E. Newell, The Impossibilists: A Brief Profile of the Socialist Party of Canada. London: Athena Press, 2008; pg. 24. Although professing a long-term objective of \\"socialisation of the means of Production, Distribution, and Exchange,\\" in practice it followed the Fabian agenda of slow, incremental social legislation ‚Äî a modest programme characterised by one historian as \\"pure reformist labourism.\\"Newell, The Impossibilists, pg. 26 In one Winnipeg city election the SPM's candidate ran for office as a self-professed 'Labour Candidate' without so much as mentioning the word 'socialism' during the duration of the campaign. Included among the planks of the SPM's ameliorative reform programme were demands for universal suffrage, direct legislation, abolition of standing armies, implementation of the 8-hour day, establishment of old age pensions, and implementation of compulsory public education.Newell, The Impossibilists, pp. 24-25. Located in a largely rural province, the SPM had a small membership almost entirely contained in the city of Winnipeg. Socialist Party of Canada in Manitoba The Socialist Party of Canada was a revolutionary Marxist organization, founded in 1904 as a merger of the Socialist Party of British Columbia and related groups in Manitoba and Ontario, Canada. Although strongest in British Columbia, the SPC was also a credible force in Winnipeg. One member of the party was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1920 provincial election. During its early years, the Winnipeg SPC was a rival to larger reformist groups such as Arthur Puttee's Winnipeg Labour Party, from which many Socialists members had split. It was active in the local trade unions, and participated in the city's elections. The party ran John Donald Houston in Winnipeg for the federal election of 1908. He finished third, behind the Liberal and Conservative candidates. In the 1910 provincial election, the SPC ran candidates in three of Winnipeg's four ridings. They finished a distant third in all three, but may have been responsible for the defeat of reformist Manitoba Labour Party candidate Fred Dixon in Winnipeg Centre. Dixon's loss provoked a backlash against the SPC from Winnipeg's labour unions, weakening the party. Many of its members joined the newly formed Social Democratic Party of Canada, which became stronger in Winnipeg than any other city in western Canada. In the 1914 provincial election, the SPC ran George Armstrong and Bill Hoop for the two Winnipeg Centre seats, but did not challenge the SDP in Winnipeg North. Both SPC candidates finished a distant third in their ridings. Armstrong ran against Dixon, but could not prevent his election as an independent. The SPC was further marginalized in the 1915 provincial election. Its only candidate was Armstrong, who again placed third against Dixon. Subsequent events, however, would briefly revive the party's fortunes in the city. In 1919, the city of Winnipeg was shaken by a General Strike which pitted unionized and non-unionized workers against the city's employers. The strike was suppressed by force, but labour radicalism within the city was greatly increased. There were increased calls for labour unity in the city. For the 1920 provincial election, the SPC, SDP and reformist labour parties forged an electoral alliance to contest Winnipeg's ten seats (which were determined by a single transferable ballot). The labour list received more votes than any other party, and elected four candidates to the Legislature. Armstrong was elected, along with three candidates from the other parties. The 1920 election proved to be the party's greatest success in Manitoba. In 1921, the SPC lost many of its members to the newly formed Workers Party (which was the legal wing of the Communist Party of Canada) and ceased to function as a viable organization. Armstrong ran again as an SPC candidate in the 1922 election, and was frequently heckled by Workers Party candidates for his alliance with the reformist Independent Labour Party. Armstrong was defeated, and the party formally dissolved in 1925. Recreated Socialist Party of Canada Armstrong resurfaced as an SPC candidate in the 1932 provincial election, but fared poorly. The party does not appear to have functioned in the city for long after the election. In 1945, a recreated SPC ran James Milne in Winnipeg for Manitoba's provincial election. Milne claimed that neither the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation nor the Labor-Progressive Party was serious about eroding capitalism and poverty. He was defeated, and the party does not appear to have participated in any further Manitoba elections. Candidates of the Socialist Party of Canada in Manitoba 1910 provincial election: * W.S. Cummings (Winnipeg Centre) ‚Äî Cummings was nominated by the SPC as a spoiler candidate in Winnipeg Centre, opposing Fred Dixon who was backed by the Manitoba Liberal Party and the Manitoba Labour Representation Committee. Dixon's supporters alleged that the Conservative were assisting his campaign, and historian Ross McCormack has indicated there may have been some truth to this charge. Cummings finished a distant third with 99 votes (2.44%). Conservative candidate Thomas Taylor defeated Dixon by 73 votes. The SPC was blamed for Dixon's loss, and became marginalized in Winnipeg's labour community until 1919. Little is known of Cummings, aside from the fact that he contested this election.

Although if it is in a cup, it is commonly referred to as a 'snowball'. The dessert consists of ice shavings that are topped with flavored sugar syrup. Depending on the region of North America, the terms \\"snowball\\" and \\"snow cone\\" may refer to different things. Where the distinction is made, the former refers to a dessert made of finely shaved ice (\\"like soft fresh snow\\"), while the latter contains ground-up ice that is coarser and more granular (\\"crunchy\\"). History Snow cone vending truck in Arizona, with an unofficial image of Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse painted on the door, and an unofficial image of Mario painted on the upper-right corner. =Industrial Revolution= In the 1850s, the American Industrial Revolution made ice commercially available. Ice houses in New York would commonly sell ice to places like Florida. To transport the ice to Florida, the ice houses would send a wagon with a huge block of ice south. The route to Florida would pass right through Baltimore where children would run up to the wagon and ask for a small scraping of ice. Before long, mothers started to make flavoring in anticipation of their children receiving some ice. The first flavor the women made is still a Baltimore favorite: egg custard. Egg custard was an easy flavor to make as the only ingredients were eggs, vanilla, and sugar.Gienow, Michelle. ‚ÄúCold Comfort: On the Cultural Significance of the Snowball in Baltimore‚Äù City Paper. September 18, 1996. Retrieved January 20, 2011. =Theaters= By the 1870s, the snowball's popularity had risen to the degree that in the warm summer months, theaters would sell snowballs to keep their patrons cool. Because of this association with the theater, snowballs were thought of as an upper-class commodity. Signs in theaters instructing patrons to finish their snowballs before coming in to the second act are the earliest tangible evidence of snowballs. In the theaters in Baltimore during the time hand shavers were used to shave the ice. Around the city, snowballs were served on newspaper, but in the classy theaters, butchers' boats were used. In the 1890s, many people started to invent easier ways to make snowballs. In that decade, patents for electric ice shavers were filed. =Great Depression and World War II= During the Great Depression and World War II, snowballs became available outside of Baltimore. As snowballs were so cheap, they were one of the few treats that people could afford. This inexpensiveness earned snowballs the nicknames Hard Times Sundae and Penny Sunday. People in need of a job could sell snowballs, as it required little overhead. The treat became more popular during World War II, when all available ice cream was sent to soldiers, creating a need for an icy treat. This newfound lack of competition helped snowballs become popular across the country.Arnett, Earl ‚ÄúTracing the Origin, Spread of Snowballs.‚Äù Baltimore Sun. 3 Aug. 1977, B1. Similar confections Snowball In Hawaii, \\"shave ice\\" is similar to snowballs, and is sold in cone-shaped paper cups. \\"Rainbow,\\" a popular flavor, consists of three colors of syrup chosen usually for their color rather than their taste compatibility. Commonly, a scoop of vanilla ice cream or sweetened azuki beans is first added to the bottom of the cup and is capped with condensed milk.Interview with Henry Hong about Baltimore summer dessert traditions, on the 1:00 hour of the \\"Mid-Day with Dan Rodricks\\" program, July 9, 2009, WYPR Vendors in Texas and northern Mexico serve finely shaved ice desserts. Called a raspa, they are usually sold from a roadside stand or trailer. They come in many flavors, including leche (milk and cinnamon) and picosito (the Spanish word for 'spicy' made with lemon and chili powder). In central and southern Mexico it is called \\"raspado\\" (Spanish for 'shaved'), most commonly bought from street cart vendors, and both sugar syrups or chili flavors are added. In Costa Rica, these are called \\"copos\\" (Spanish for 'flake', as in 'ice flake') and are sold in a very similar fashion, though no spicy or chili options are available. The dessert ais kacang served in Malaysia and Singapore is another form of shaved ice. Ais kacang was originally served with red beans but now includes various fruits and other sweet toppings. In Japan they are known as kakig≈çri, and in India it is called a \\"gola\\" and usually served on popsicle sticks. In Britain the term snowball is sometimes used, however it refers to a different treat.http://www.mrwhippysofticecream.com/images/menu-board.jpg Slush (beverage) is similar, though more for drinking than eating, and both are common in the UK. They are often served in the same places as ice creams. In Peru this dessert is called Raspadilla, which is served in cups along with a spoon and/or a straw. It consists of ground ice which is thick and topped with juices of different flavors that can be combined. The most common flavors are pineapple and strawberry, but it can also be served with berry juice, passion fruit juice (maracuya), and purple corn juice (chicha morada). In some cases, though uncommon, it can be topped with condensed milk or yogurt. It is very popular on the beaches during summertime, and is also sold in the towns and cities from carts scattered throughout streets and avenues. Some vendors grind the ice from a block with a device or spoon with a blade like razor at one end, others have the ice already ground and stored in a cooler. Raspadilla is prepared in a cup in front of the customer who then selects the flavor of juice to pour on top. In the Costa Rican city of Puntarenas it is elaborated with the name Churchill. In France this dessert is called . In the United States Virgin Islands (the American islands of St. Croix, St. Thomas, St.John, Water Island located in the Caribbean) a similar desert is called \\"fraco\\" (pronounced fray-co) -- sometimes spelled \\"fraico\\".  Kala Khatta  Kala Khatta is a syrup made from the jambul fruit in India and some other parts of South Asia. It is primarily used as a flavoring for Indian ice lollipops or popsicles, sold as street food. Crushed ice is formed into a lump by hand and mounted on a stick to make the lollipop. Kala khatta syrup and seasonings such as salt and pepper are then poured on the lollipop.

He also played drums for the Ramones for a brief time in 1987, and performed under the name \\"Elvis Ramone\\". Life and career Burke's early experiences behind the drum kit began in the late 1960s and early 1970s as one of the founding members of Bayonne's premier cover bands, Total Environment and Sweet Willie Jam Band. Burke also gained percussion knowledge from his stint as a drummer in the famed Saint Andrew Bridgmen Drum and Bugle Corps in Bayonne. Recruited by Debbie Harry and Chris Stein when Blondie was first forming in 1974, Burke joined Blondie in 1975. He was a key figure in keeping the group together after Stein and Harry considered disbanding, following the departure of original bassist Fred Smith to Television and recruited his friend Gary Valentine to play bass. His style of playing was influenced by Hal Blaine, Keith Moon, Ringo Starr, and Earl Palmer. During the 1980s and 1990s, when Blondie was disbanded, Burke played drums for the Romantics (for whom Burke was the regular drummer between 1990 and 2004), Pete Townshend, Bob Dylan, Eurythmics, Dramarama, the Fleshtones, Iggy Pop, and Joan Jett, amongst others. He went on to record with the line-up of Chequered Past in 1983 with Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones, former Blondie bandmate Nigel Harrison, musician Tony Sales and singer/actor Michael Des Barres.

He is also a member of Magic Christian (Dirty Water Records), along with Flamin' Groovies guitarist Cyril Jordan (on guitar) and Plimsouls lead guitarist Eddie Munoz (on bass) and toured several times as drummer with the Hugh Cornwell Band. Burke played 90-minute sets at 100 concerts in a year and in 2008 it was reported that he had taken part in an 8-year study that analysed the physical and psychological effects of drumming and the stamina required by professional drummers, conducted jointly by the University of Gloucestershire and the University of Chichester.Rock drummers 'are top athletes' at BBC News Health Retrieved 26 November 2015 In July 2011, Burke received an honorary doctorate from the University of Gloucestershire, as a result of the drumming project.

It is also known as the Marr wavelet for David Marr.http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~brani/isyebayes/bank/handout20.pdfhttp://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/download/doc/detect_manual/wav_theory.html#wav_theory_mh : \\\\psi(x,y) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi\\\\sigma^4}\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left(\\\\frac{x^2+y^2}{\\\\sigma^2}\\\\right)\\\\right) e^{-\\\\frac{x^2+y^2}{2\\\\sigma^2}} 3D view of 2D Mexican hat wavelet The multidimensional generalization of this wavelet is called the Laplacian of Gaussian function. In practice, this wavelet is sometimes approximated by the difference of Gaussians function, because the DoG is separable and can therefore save considerable computation time in two or more dimensions. The scale normalised Laplacian (in L_1-norm) is frequently used as a blob detector and for automatic scale selection in computer vision applications; see Laplacian of Gaussian and scale space. The relation between this Laplacian of the Gaussian operator and the difference- of-Gaussians operator is explained in appendix A in Lindeberg (2015).Lindeberg (2015) \`\`Image matching using generalized scale-space interest points\\", Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision, volume 52, number 1, pages 3-36, 2015.

The D-Day Dodgers also inspired a popular wartime soldier's song (Roud Folk Song Index no. 10499). A rumour spread during the war that the term was publicized by Viscountess Astor, a Member of the British Parliament, who supposedly used the expression in public after a disillusioned serviceman in Italy signed a letter to her as being from a \\"D-Day Dodger\\". However, there is no record that she actually said this, in or out of Parliament, and she herself denied ever saying it. Reference to a \\"D-Day Dodger\\" was bitingly sarcastic, given the steady stream of Allied service personnel who were being killed or wounded in combat on the Italian front. A \\"dodger\\" is someone who avoids something; the soldiers in Italy felt that their sacrifices were being ignored after the invasion of Normandy, and a \\"D-Day Dodger\\" was a reference to someone who was supposedly avoiding real combat by serving in Italy, whereas the reality was anything but. The Ballad of the D-Day Dodgers Several versions of a song called \\"D-Day Dodgers\\", set to the tune \\"Lili Marleen\\" (a favourite song of all troops in the North African Campaign ‚Äì the British Eighth Army was a veteran formation from that theatre before landing in Italy), were sung with gusto in the last months of the war, and at post-war reunions. The song was written in November 1944 by Lance-Sergeant Harry Pynn of the Tank Rescue Section, 19 Army Fire Brigade, who was with the 78th Infantry Division just south of Bologna, Italy. There were many variations on verses and even the chorus, but the song generally and sarcastically referred to how easy their life in Italy was. There was no mention of Lady Astor in the original lyrics. Many Allied personnel in Italy had reason to be bitter, as the bulk of material support for the Allied armies went to Northwest Europe after the invasion of Normandy. They also noted sardonically that they had participated in several \\"D-days\\" of their own before the landings in Normandy became popularly known as \\"D-Day\\". The expression was used to refer to the day that any military operation began (with \\"H-hour\\" being the specific start time of an operation beginning on D-day), but the popular press turned it into an expression synonymous with the Normandy landings only. Italian campaign veterans noted that they had been in action for eleven months before the Normandy landings, and some of those had served in North Africa even before that. The numerous Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries across Italy are compelling evidence of the fighting which took place during campaigns such as Operation Avalanche and the subsequent Battle of Monte Cassino. Although Hamish Henderson did not write the song, he did collect different versions of it and it is attributed to him in the sleeve notes of the Ian Campbell Folk Group's \\"Contemporary Campbells\\". Many different variations have been recorded.

During a taping of The Jenny Jones Show, a television talk show, Amedure revealed that he was attracted to an acquaintance, Jonathan Schmitz (born ). Three days later, Schmitz confronted Amedure and shot him twice in the chest. He confessed to the killing and was found guilty of second degree murder. The Amedure family successfully sued The Jenny Jones Show for wrongful death, but the judgment was subsequently overturned by the Michigan Court of Appeals. The episode was never broadcast, although segments of it were played for television news programs.  Appearance on The Jenny Jones Show  On March 6, 1995, Amedure videotaped an episode of The Jenny Jones Show, in which he admitted to being a secret admirer of Jonathan Schmitz, who lived near him in Lake Orion, Michigan. Until the taping, Schmitz did not know who would be revealed as his secret admirer. Schmitz stated that he participated in the show due to curiosity, and he claimed later that the producers implied that his admirer was a woman, although the producers of the show claim that they did tell Schmitz that the admirer could be male or female. During the segment, Amedure was encouraged by Jones to share his fantasies about Schmitz, after which Schmitz was brought onstage. According to the Washington Post, \\"[t]he two men exchanged an awkward embrace before the host dropped her bombshell.\\" In response to Amedure's disclosure, Schmitz laughed, then stated that he was \\"completely heterosexual\\".  Aftermath and murder  According to footage of the murder trial, it was stated later by a friend of Amedure's that Amedure and Schmitz went out drinking together the night after the taping and an alleged sexual encounter occurred. According to the testimony at the murder trial, three days after the taping, Amedure left a \\"suggestive\\" note at Schmitz's house. After finding the note, Schmitz withdrew money from a bank, purchased a shotgun, and then went to Amedure's mobile home. He questioned Amedure about the note. Schmitz then returned to his car, got his gun, and returned to Amedure's trailer. He then shot Amedure twice in the chest, killing him. After killing Amedure, Schmitz left the residence, telephoned 9-1-1, and confessed to the killing.  Trial and sentencing of Schmitz  At trial, defense attorneys argued that Schmitz, who had been diagnosed with manic depression and Graves' disease, was caused to commit homicide by mental illness and humiliation, by way of the \\"gay panic defense\\". Schmitz was found guilty of second degree murder in 1996 and sentenced to 25‚Äì50 years in prison, but his conviction was overturned on appeal. Upon retrial, he was found guilty of the same charge once again and his sentence was reinstated. Schmitz was released from prison on August 22, 2017.  Trial of the show producers  In 1999, the Amedure family, retaining Geoffrey Fieger as lawyer, sued The Jenny Jones Show, Telepictures, and Warner Bros. for the ambush tactics and, as the Amedure family considered it, their negligent actions that resulted in Amedure's death. In May, the jury awarded the Amedures $29,332,686. The jury found that The Jenny Jones Show was both irresponsible and negligent, contending that the show intentionally created an unpredictable situation without due concern for the possible consequences. Time Warner's defense attorney later claimed the verdict would cause a \\"chilling effect\\" on the industry. The judgment was later overturned by the Michigan Court of Appeals in a 2-to-1 decision. The Michigan Supreme Court declined to hear the case.  Media coverage  The podcast Criminal included the murder of Scott Amedure and following trial of Jonathan Schmitz in their episode, \\"Panic Defense,\\" about the gay panic defense.

Location and features Fed by the Pine Rivulet and Breton Rivulet, the original natural freshwater lake, much smaller in size than its current surface area, was expanded as a result of the 1922 construction of Miena Dam #2 at its southern outflow into the Shannon River. This dam is considered to be of high heritage value by Engineers Australia. Miena Dam #2 created the once-famous Shannon Rise, in the 500-metre section of the Shannon River between the dam and Shannon Lagoon. The hatching of thousands of caddis moths in early summer, attracted large numbers of trout and fishermen. In 1967, a sloping-core rock-fill dam was built just downstream of Miena Dam #2 to increase the maximum-capacity level, destroying the Shannon Rise. It was raised a further in 1982, causing Miena Dam #2 to be periodically submerged. After Lake Pedder, the Great Lake is the state's third largest freshwater lake. At above sea level, the lake's uses include hydro- electric power, fishing, and tourism. Water from the lake flows into Poatina Power Station to generate hydro-electric power. The nearby towns of Liaweenee and Miena are popular holiday shack destinations for local tourists, despite the area's reputation as being one of the coldest places in the generally mild-weathered state. During the winter months, when the weather is hardly conducive to camping, the population of these two small towns drops to two or three hundred. Parts of the lake surface have frozen during July in some years. The Lake Highway or Highland Lakes Road runs along the west side of the lake and is sometimes snowed under in winter.

Musto is a former columnist for The Village Voice, where he wrote the La Dolce Musto column of gossip, nightlife, reviews, interviews, and political observations. He is the author of the books Downtown and Manhattan on the Rocks, as well as a compilation of selected columns published as La Dolce Musto: Writings By The World's Most Outrageous Columnist and a subsequent collection, Fork on the Left, Knife in the Back. Early life Musto was born in Manhattan to an Italian American family. He was raised in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn and graduated from Columbia University in 1976. During his studies, he was a theater critic for the Columbia Spectator. Career Musto is gay and has been published regularly in several LGBT publications, including Out and The Advocate. He contributes to Huffington Post, has written the weekly, entertainment-related Musto Unfiltered column for NewNowNext.com, pens pieces for Papermag.com, and has had bylines in The New York Times, W, and The Daily Beast. Among Musto's first journalistic jobs were assignments covering culture for Circus magazine, SoHo Weekly News, and After Dark magazine, as well as becoming the music critic for Us magazine in the 1980s. In 1982, he began writing for Details, then a downtown style-and- nightlife magazine, and in 1984, Musto began his Village Voice column, after having already written features for the publication. Musto's breathlessly dishy and opinionated first-person column celebrated nightlife and LGBT personalities, described outlandish New York club fetes, and gave vital early coverage to up-and-coming performers like John Sex, RuPaul, Kiki and Herb, Bridget Everett, Jackie Hoffman, Bianca Del Rio and Peppermint. A 1989 appearance in Slaves of New York‚Äîbased on Tama Janowitz's book centered on the New York nightlife scene‚Äîwas called the film's only moment of credibility by critic J. Hoberman of The Village Voice. Other cameos through the years were made in Garbo Talks (1984), Day of the Dead (1985), Jeffrey (1995), Death of a Dynasty (2003), The Big Gay Musical (2009), and Violet Tendencies (2010). Musto was great personal friend with the Videographer, Nelson Sullivan who filmed much of the footage we have today of the ‚ÄúClub Kids‚Äù. Musto also used his column to lambast homophobia and to demand attention to the growing AIDS crisis, Musto joining the activist group ACT UP and engaging in their highly influential rallies and protests. In 2011, The Advocate magazine referred to Musto's \\"legendary gossip column\\" and said, \\"Since 1984, shrewd and self- deprecating humorist Michael Musto has written his 'La Dolce Musto' column, tirelessly chronicling nightlife and celebrity culture. The bridge-burning blogger and baron of blind items has earned a position as both historian and spokesman for the gay community.\\" In the 1980s, Musto did nightlife-related segments for MTV, where his un-self-conscious gayness seemed radical. Videotographer Nelson Sullivan chose Musto as one of his favorite subjects and relentlessly followed the writer through clubs, appearances, and family get- togethers, many of the videos later surfacing on YouTube. From 1993 to 2000, he was one of the most prominent columnists on The Gossip Show, an E! program which featured colorful reporters relaying celebrity dish, and again, Musto was out and flamboyant on the show. He was featured on the cover of New York magazine in a 1994 \\"Gossip Mafia\\" story that spanned New York's most influential tattlers, including Richard Johnson, George Rush, and Jeannette Walls. In 1999, he cohosted \\"New York Central,\\" a nightly magazine-format show on the Metro Channel. He appeared in drag in a blue dress in the all drag queen music video for Cyndi Lauper's remake of her single \\"(Hey Now) Girls Just Want To Have Fun\\" (1994). He has also done cameos in videos by TV on the Radio, Sherry Vine, Sharon Needles, Jinkx Monsoon, Larry Tee, and Gorgon City featuring Jennifer Hudson, among many others. He penned several writeups in The Village Voice about the 1996 murder of Andre \\"Angel\\" Melendez, helping bring national attention to a case that resulted in the trial and conviction of Michael Alig and Robert \\"Freeze\\" Riggs. He was the first to report Alig's firing from The Limelight club by owner Peter Gatien and to allude to talk about a missing person from Alig's sphere. When his blind item describing the buzz on the details of the crime got picked up by The New York Post's Page Six gossip column, the story took on even more prominence. A later Village Voice feature story acknowledged Musto's breaking item. The movie \\"Party Monster\\" (2003) includes reference to a Musto item, and Musto has appeared in many related documentaries, including \\"Disco Bloodbath\\" and A&E;'s \\"American Justice,\\" as well as several Geraldo Rivera shows, where he had long been the expert on club kids. Discussing topics like gossip and nightlife, Musto also appeared on daytime talk shows hosted by Sally Jessy Raphael, Joan Rivers, Ricki Lake, Richard Bey, Gordon Elliott, and Mark L. Walberg. In 2001, Musto appeared in a groundbreaking ad campaign for Fortunoff in which he sported a wedding veil, campily promoting the possibility of same-sex marriage. In 2010, he made a cameo appearance in Erasure's re-release of A Little Respect (HMI Redux)'; the proceeds of this release were donated to help students attending the Harvey Milk Institute. Also in 2010, LCD Soundsystem mentioned Musto in the song \\"Pow Pow\\" playfully urging him to \\"Eat it\\" (wacky retaliation for banter between Musto and the group's James Murphy at a Paper Nightlife Awards ceremony). That year, Musto also added \\"Theater Producer\\" to his resume, when he produced the musical comedy Perfect Harmony about the search for truth, love, and high school a cappella championship glory, which played Off-Broadway in New York City. In 2011, Musto was named one of the \\"Out 100\\" as one of the country's most influential LGBT personalities. In 2013, he played himself in a scene on the NBC series \\"Smash\\", having also previously figured in a plot line involving his gossip writing. In May 2013, Musto was laid off from The Village Voice, but in 2016, he was back as an entertainment correspondent, writing three cover stories that year. Musto was a regular commentator on MSNBC's Countdown With Keith Olbermann, where he sardonically skewered the antics of Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, and other scandalous celebrities du jour. Starting in 2015, Musto became a recurring panelist on Logo TV's \\"Cocktails and Classics,\\" which involved showing well known films and offering campy commentary on them. He has moderated Broadway talkbacks for shows like \\"Talk Radio\\" and \\"End of the Rainbow,\\" and in 2016, was the celebrity guest star one night in the off-Broadway production of \\"Oh, Hello.\\" Musto has also dabbled in acting and singing. In 1980, he became lead singer of a Motown cover band called the Must, and once shared a bill with rising star Madonna. He played a lead role and received rave reviews from Eileen Shapiro of Huffington Post, for the film Vamp Bikers Tres by Eric Rivas, as a head doctor named Hedda Hopper alongside Lillo Brancato and Angel Salazar. The film premiered in 2016 at Anthology Film Archives and in 2018 was released by the Orchard. Musto sang a pop/reggae/dance ditty, \\"I Got Ur Back,\\" written and produced by Tyler Stone, based on Musto's idea, for Trax Records, released in 2017. A celebrity roast of Musto at Actors Temple on May 22, 2017‚Äîkicked off by Rosie O'Donnell and hosted by Bruce Vilanch‚Äîraised significant money for the Callen-Lorde clinic. In addition to doubling the take of the benefit, O'Donnell--after aiming some barbs at Musto's closet-busting mania--thanked him for pulling her into the community; in the 1990s, he'd urged her and Ellen DeGeneres in print to come out of the closet. He has won seven Glam Awards for Best Nightlife Writer/Blogger.

It was founded in late 1912, and was based on a British organization of the same name. The LRC cooperated with the Social Democratic Party of Canada in the municipal elections of 1913, and the two parties did not compete against each other in the 1914 provincial election. This was a marked contrast to the hostility which had previously existed between reformist labour groups and the Socialist Party of Canada (from which the SDPC had split). The party's candidates in 1914 were W.J. Bartlett (Assiniboia) and R.S. Ward (Elmwood). All of these candidates placed third, behind their Conservative and Liberal opponents. Fred Dixon was not a candidate of the LRC in 1914, but sympathized with most of its goals and was from the same reformist tradition. Unofficially supported by many in the LRC, Dixon was elected as an independent candidate in a Winnipeg constituency. For the provincial election of 1915, the LRC supported the two SDPC candidates in Winnipeg North (one of whom was successful), and also nominated William Bayley in Assiniboia. Bayley finished ahead of John Thomas Haig, the riding's Tory incumbent, and came within 55 votes of defeating Liberal John Wilton. Dixon again ran as an independent. The candidates nominated by the LRC in 1914-15 officially ran as \\"Independent Labour\\". This organization dissolved after the election of 1915.

In Vietnamese cuisine, it also refers to a type of short baguette with thin, crisp crust and soft, airy texture inside that is often split lengthwise and filled with various savory ingredients like a submarine sandwich and served as a meal. Plain banh mi is also eaten as a staple food. A typical Vietnamese sandwich is a fusion of meats and vegetables from native Vietnamese cuisine such as ch·∫£ l·ª•a (pork sausage), coriander leaf (cilantro), cucumber, pickled carrots, and pickled daikon combined with condiments from French cuisine such as p√¢t√©, along with chili and mayonnaise.Daniel Young. \\"East Meets West in 'Nam Sandwich\\", New York Daily News, 25 September 1996. However, a wide variety of popular fillings are used, from to ice cream. In Vietnam, sandwiches are typically eaten for breakfast or as a snack. The baguette was introduced to Vietnam in the mid-19th century, when Vietnam was part of French Indochina, and became a staple food by the early 20th century. During the 1950s, a distinctly Vietnamese style of sandwich developed in Saigon, becoming a popular street food, also known as b√°nh m√¨ S√†i G√≤n (\\"Saigon sandwich\\", \\"Saigon-style Banh Mi\\").Saigon-Style Banh Mi, Los Angeles Times Following the Vietnam War, Overseas Vietnamese popularized the sandwich in countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States. In these countries they are commonly sold in Asian bakeries. Terminology and In Vietnamese, the word ' is derived from ' (which can refer to many kinds of food, primarily baked goods, including bread) and ' (wheat). It may also be spelled ' in northern Vietnam. Taken alone, ' means \\"bread\\", but also understood to be the Vietnamese baguette. Via synecdoche, it may also refer to the sandwich, with the term ' or b√°nh m√¨ th·ªãt being used to disambiguate. A folk etymology claims that the word ' is a corruption of the French ', meaning soft, white bread. However, ' or its N√¥m form has referred to rice cakes and other pastries since as early as the 13th century, centuries before French contact. History The word , meaning \\"bread\\", is attested in Vietnamese as early as the 1830s, in Jean-Louis Taberd's dictionary '. French colonists introduced Vietnam to the baguette, along with other baked goods such as p√¢t√© chaud, in the 1860s, when Vietnam was part of French Indochina. Northern Vietnamese initially called the baguette ', literally \\"Western b√°nh\\", while southern Vietnamese called it , \\"wheat b√°nh\\". Nguy·ªÖn ƒê√¨nh Chi·ªÉu mentions the baguette in his 1861 poem \\"\\". Due to the price of imported wheat at the time, French baguettes and sandwiches were considered luxury items. During World War I, an influx of French soldiers and supplies arrived. At the same time, disruptions of wheat imports led bakers to begin mixing in inexpensive rice flour (which also made the bread fluffier). As a result, it became possible for ordinary Vietnamese to enjoy French staples such as bread. Many shops baked twice a day, because bread tends to go stale more quickly in the Vietnamese climate. Baguettes were mainly eaten for breakfast with some butter and sugar. A stand in Ho Chi Minh City Until the 1950s, sandwiches hewed closely to French tastes, typically a jambon-beurre moistened with a mayonnaise or liver spread. The 1954 Partition of Vietnam sent over a million migrants from North Vietnam to South Vietnam, transforming Saigon's local cuisine. Among the migrants were and , who opened a small bakery named in District 3. In 1958, became one of the first shops to sell '. Around this time, another migrant from the North began selling sandwiches from a basket on a mobylette, and a stand in Gia ƒê·ªãnh Province (present-day Ph√∫ Nhu·∫≠n District) began selling sandwiches. Some shops stuffed sandwiches with inexpensive Cheddar cheese, which came from French food aid that migrants from the North had rejected. Vietnamese communities in France also began selling '. After the Fall of Saigon in 1975, ' sandwiches became a luxury item once again. During the so-called \\"subsidy period\\", state-owned ph·ªü eateries often served bread or cold rice as a side dish, leading to the present-day practice of dipping in ph·ªü. In the 1980s, ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi market reforms led to a renaissance in , mostly as street food. Meanwhile, Vietnamese Americans brought b√°nh m√¨ sandwiches to cities across the United States.

The classic \\"swanny\\" or bush shirt is a heavy, hooded, woollen garment with a lace up section at the neck. Although a wide range of colours and patterns are available, the traditional swanny pattern is a dark tartan which could be described as a 'reverse gingham', with thick criss-crossing stripes of either blue or red over a black base. The item was widely worn by farmers, but in recent years its popularity has spread and it has become something of a fashion item. The Swanndri company also now produces a range of more urban- focussed garments. History Vintage Swanndri clothing label from approximately the 1960s The Swanndri, or \\"swanny\\" as it has been dubbed, was designed by William Broome (1873‚Äì1942). Since he registered Swanndri as a trademark on 23 December 1913, it has become an iconic New Zealand garment, and the term \\"swanny\\" has, to some extent at least, become a genericised trademark for heavy bush shirts within New Zealand. Broome, born in Staffordshire, England, immigrated to New Zealand at age 21. A tailor by trade, he established a clothier and outfitters business, The Palatine that was located on Devon Street, New Plymouth. Part of his business involved sewing woollen fabric from mills in Wanganui, Kaiapoi and Wellington, into the Swanndri garments. The characteristics of the \\"swanny\\" design include its heavy dark fabric, often in a tartan pattern, hood and laced neck closure. In more recent designs, a zip has replaced the lace-up neck. The original design was short sleeved, long in the back, and would be worn on top of work clothes for warmth and shower proofing. During production, these garments were dipped into a secret mixture and then dried. It is not known if Broome had been taught the method for shower proofing the fabric he used or whether he developed the formula himself. The mixture caused the garments to shrink unevenly so were sold as one size fits all. In 1938, Broome transferred the business to his wife, Ivy. Broome himself died four years later at aged 69 years. In 1952, Ivy sold the business and trademark to John McKendrick, who operated a clothing factory at Waitara. McKendrick began purchasing fabric that was closely woven and pre-shrunk which enabled him to make different pattern sizes and garments. He sourced his cloth from South Island-based Alliance textiles, and the business expanded with factories in Waitara and Opunake. Alliance purchased Swanndri in 1991 when McKendrick retired and continued for a few years until production centered in Timaru and the Taranaki operation closed. In 1994, Swanndri New Zealand Ltd purchase the brand from Alliance Textiles. According to the Swanndri‚Äôs corporate history, Broome‚Äôs design began after he was frustrated by the persistently rainy New Zealand weather. The name Swanndri was named by Broome because the rain would literally run off the back of the garment as it does on a swan.Swanndri NZ Website and Online Store Although new colors and features have been incorporated into the Swanndri, Broom‚Äôs original design influence can still be seen in New Zealand and among other producers around the world. Recent history Swanndri has been outsourcing its production to China since 2005. While the packaging and postage reinforces the NZ connection, the labelling says \\"Final construction in China to Swanndri NZ standards\\", thus the manufacturer no longer qualifies for Buy NZ Made.

Previous \\"Great Fires\\" had occurred in St. John's, during 1819 and 1846. Timeline At approximately 4:45 in the afternoon of July 8, 1892, a dropped pipe in Timothy O'Brien's stable, atop Carter's Hill on Freshwater Road, began what would become the worst fire in the history of St. John's. Initially, the fire did not cause any widespread panic; however, a series of catastrophic coincidences caused the fire to spread and devour virtually all of the east end of the city, including much of its major commercial area, before being extinguished. Rev. Moses Harvey witnessed the initial stages of the fire, and remarked to his friend that it \\"was a bad day for a fire.\\" A high wind from the northwest was blowing, hurling the sparks far and wide on the roofs of the clusters of wooden houses. For a month previous, hardly any rain had fallen, and the shingled roofs were as dry as tinder.\\" The situation was exacerbated because of work completed earlier in the day on the water mains. Although water flow was re-established by 3 p.m., two hours before the fire began, water pressure was insufficient to force water up into the higher sections of the city where the fire began. W.J. Kent remarked that the \\"flames therefore made headway before water was procurable and, as a very high westerly wind was furiously fanning the fire, it began to spread rapidly.\\" City of St. John's and the St. John the Baptist Cathedral after the fire An hour into the blaze, the people of St. John's realized that the fire could not be contained in the area of O'Brien's farm. Because locals believed stone walls would withstand the flames, residents moved valuables into numerous stone buildings in the city. One of the most common refuge areas was the Anglican Cathedral of St. John the Baptist. The nave and transepts of the church were filled with valuable property belonging to numerous families, including that of the Anglican bishop Lleweyn Jones. The cathedral and much of this property were also destroyed by the ravenous fire. Kent described the burning of the cathedral as follows: The fire was far from finished; the wind caused offshoots of the main fire to consume new sections of the city while the main fire continued its destructive trek towards the city's commercial centre, Water Street. The businesses that lined Water Street and Duckworth Street were destroyed as the fire spread throughout the downtown area. Rev. Harvey said, > \\"The beautiful shops, full of valuable goods; the stores behind, containing > thousands of barrels of flour and provisions of all kinds; the fish stores; > the wharves, which it had cost immense sums to erect, -- disappeared one by > one into the maw of the destroyer...the whole of Water Street, on both > sides, was 'swept with the besom of destruction.'\\" The fire continued to burn into the night and the early hours of the next morning. Rev. Harvey's description of the restless night said that \\"the terror-stricken inhabitants flying before the destroyer,‚Ä¶ the cries of weeping women hurrying with their children to places of safety -- all constituted a scene which not even the pen of Dante could describe.\\" Similarly, Kent said of that night, Basilica of St. John The Baptist and St. John's after the Great Fire of 1892 Daybreak on the morning of July 9, 1892 revealed the full extent of the fire's devastation. Kent described the sight of local residents viewing the desolation: Rev. Harvey presents a similar description: Less than $5,000,000 of the total estimated losses of $13,000,000 were covered by insurance. A large influx of financial aid from Britain, Canada and the United States helped the city recover from its devastating losses. Many of the present-day registered heritage structures were either built or re-built in the reconstruction period after the 1892 fire. The most prominent architect of this era in St. John's was John Thomas Southcott. He designed numerous Second Empire-styled buildings that had distinctive mansard roofs with bonnet-topped dormers protruding from the concave-curved roof surface. Southcott was so prolific that the term the \\"Southcott style\\" became associated with the architecture in the re-built city. Each year in Southcott's honour, the Newfoundland Historic Trust presents the Southcott Award for excellence in the restoration of heritage structures. Because of the devastation of the fire, the city of St. John's reorganized its fire department. It had previously relied only on volunteer brigades. By the end of 1895, the city had hired 22 paid firefighters and established three new fire stations throughout the city. Control of the fire department was placed under Newfoundland Constabulary‚Äôs Inspector-General.\\"1892 Fire\\", Newfoundland Heritage See also *Great Fire of 1846, also in St. John's References External links *Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador *Paul Butler. 1892, a 2008 novel about the fire. *Paul Butler.

The re-issue version's artwork was also designed and updated by Brandon Seavers, who had by this time bought out the multi-media company Audio MasterWorks with Mark Yoshida and renamed it AudioGraphic MasterWorks. Appearances Three of the songs originally recorded for Saliva's debut full-length were later re-tracked with producer [Bob Marlette] and mixed by John Goodmanson and Steve Thompson as part of the band's major record label Island Records debut Every Six Seconds in 2000. The three songs were Beg, Greater Than Less Than and 800. Beg and Greater Than Less Than appeared on Every Six Seconds, however 800 was cut from the album and kept as a b-side. It was only in 2002 that the song was finally released on the soundtrack of the film Resident Evil. The song Pin Cushion was taken from this album and appeared on the soundtrack of the 2000 Canadian werewolf horror film Ginger Snaps. At the time of its release (2010), it was the only Saliva album not to have a song included on the greatest hits compilation Moving Forward in Reverse: Greatest Hits.

She founded (1991) and for two decades served as president of Inteco, an investment and construction company. Her assets are now invested in Baturina's Investment Group. The Group's commercial activities cover a hotel chain (in Ireland, the Czech Republic and Russia), a membrane construction and engineering enterprise (Germany), a renewable energy project (Greece, Cyprus and Italy), a development project (Cyprus) and investments in a number of real estate investment funds focused on residential and commercial construction and development in Europe and the US. Baturina is the founder of the Be Open foundation. According to Forbes, with a fortune of $1.2 billion, she remains the richest woman in Russia. Biography Baturina is a Moscow native who began working as a design-technician at the (where her parents worked) after graduating from high school. She later got a degree, graduating from the Moscow-based S. Ordzhonikidze State University of Management in 1986. * 1980‚Äì1982: the Frazer plant, technician-designer, then senior design engineer of the Chief Technologist Department; * 1982‚Äì1989: Institute of Integrated Economic Development of Moscow, researcher; Russian Union of United Cooperatives, head of the Secretariat; the Mosgorispolkom Commission on cooperative activity, senior specialist. * since 1989 engaged in private business activities; * 1991‚Äì1994: LLP \\"Inteco\\", director; * 1994‚Äì2011: CJSC \\"Inteco\\", president; * 2006‚Äì2011: deputy head of the interdepartmental working group on the priority national project \\"Affordable and Comfortable Housing to Russian citizens\\", a member of the commission on the development of affordable housing under the President of the Russian Federation on the implementation of priority national projects and demographic policy. Baturina met her future husband, Yury Luzhkov, in 1987 when they were both serving at Mosgorispolkom, a Soviet-era municipal commission. At the period of their co-working the relationships were purely professional. In one of her interviews Baturina remembers: \\"We never even thought about anything like that when we were working together, it all happened much later\\". Baturina and Luzhkov married in 1991. The next year he became mayor of Moscow. In 2010 he was dismissed by President Dmitry Medvedev amidst still unproven accusations of corruption and mismanagement voiced on state run television. Yury himself had at one time been tipped to run for president, though he never did. After her husband's dismissal Baturina moved to London. She explains the choice of the city by the fact that her two daughters decided to study in London In November 2010 Luzhkov gave an interview to the Telegraph newspaper stating that the couple was sending their daughters to study in London to protect them from possible persecution from the Russian authorities. He also said that a house had been bought in the west of the city for them and that he and his wife intend to visit them regularly. Luzhkov also claimed that the Russian authorities were planning to break up Baturina's business empire and that the couple would fight the attempt: \\"We will not give up. My wife will battle for her business and for her honour and self-worth. That is for sure\\". In September 2009 The Sunday Times erroneously stated that Witanhurst, a large house in Highgate, North London, had been bought by Baturina, via an offshore front company. Baturina sued the papers owners, Times Newspapers, a subsidiary of News International. Times Newspapers apologized for the story and paid damages to her in October 2011. Baturina is one of many \\"Russian oligarchs\\" named in the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, CAATSA, signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2017. The report was \\"not a sanctions list,\\" the US administration pointed out though. The US Treasury report just listed every senior member of the political administration at the Kremlin, and every wealthy Russian with a net worth of $1 billion or more. So it did not impose any effect on Baturina. Career = Inteco = In 1989 Baturina launched her first enterprise with her elder brother Victor, primarily dealing with computer software and hardware. In 1991 Baturina founded her company, Inteco (\\"Inteko\\" (–ò–Ω—Ç–µ–∫–æ) in Russian), which focused on construction though it began as a plastics business. In 1994 Inteco purchased a plastic factory. In 1998 the company won the contract for producing 85,000 seats for Luzhniki Stadium, Moscow's largest stadium. The critics claimed that the decision was affected by Luzhkov as Mayor of Moscow, though Inteco stated that their price was 50% less than their nearest competitor's. In the middle of 1990s Inteco entered the construction business focusing on development of advanced materials and technologies for facade work, cement, brick and poured concrete construction, architectural design and real estate business. In 2001 Inteco acquired from a private person the controlling stake in one of the leading house-building factories in Moscow DSK-3. Following modernization the construction plant provided 500,000 square meters of housing per year. This acquisition, according to Baturina's interviews, became the starting point for the company's major construction activity. \\"DSK-3 is my first real step into construction. I had been viewing the market for a long time. I saw how quickly and dynamically it was developing, how many opportunities it was offering. Still the deal took place sort of accidentally. The lawyers of the former main owner‚Äôs widow came to me and said that some unfriendly entities were questioning her property rights and trying to simply rob her of her stake. And the frightened woman had decided to sell all the shares to Inteco on the condition that we defend her rights in court. We have successfully managed that and just like that, almost by accident, became the owners of the plant.\\" At one point Inteco was said to control 20% of construction in the capital. However, according to experts, quoted by media, from 2000 to 2010 of construction activities Inteco's share in the state order was no more than 2%. While the main contractors for the implementation of the Moscow government orders were construction companies MFS-6 (24.5%) Glavmosstroy (20.7%), SU-155 (13.7%) and MSM-5 (12.2%). In 2002 Inteco created a subsidiary \\"Strategy Construction Company\\", whose main objective was the construction of monolithic buildings. Such cement plants as \\"Podgorensky cementnik\\" and \\"Oskolcement\\", one of the largest cement producers in the central Russia, were also bought at that time. Inteco In 2005 Inteco sold its cement works for estimated US$800 000 to Eurocement Group in order to consolidate financial and administrative recourses that the company needed for the implementation of perspective construction programs. Shortly Inteco sold DSK-3, a producer of prefabricated buildings, as well and fully concentrated on the construction of monolithic housing and commercial real estate. Part of the proceeds from the sale of these assets were directed by Baturina to buying some high-yield \\"blue chips\\" of the largest Russian companies such as Gazprom and Sberbank. This step allowed the visionary businesswoman to later sell the shares in the crisis year of 2009 at a significant profit and return Inteco's earlier business development bank loans ahead of schedule, which allowed to keep the businesses afloat. The interest rate on loans at that time sprang up from 10.8 to 18 percent, which led to the ruin of a significant number of Russian developers. At the same time, as part of a new cement project, Inteco purchased Verkhnebakansky Cement Plant and the Atakaytsement cement factory located in the Krasnodar region.\\"Inteco\\" will spend USD 500 mln on cement. 15.12.2006 \\"Inteco\\" does not want to depend on price policy of cement suppliers As of 2007, the company owned such entities as Inteko Plast (55%), Bistro Plast (50%), construction firms SK DSK-3 (100%), Styre (100%), Inteco CENTER (100%), Inteco Chess (Elista, 100%), Intekostroy (70%). The company also owned enterprises in the city of Sochi - Park (100%), The Matrix (100%), Sochi AO (75.58%), Horizont (50%), Selectioner (Belgorod region., 100%) and Uspensky Agromashplast (Moscow reg., Uspensky, 38%). Inteco Group also included Russian Zemelny Bank and trading house Moscow River involved in the supply of grain. In 2007, the company's revenue, according to its own data, amounted to $1 billion. At the end of 2008, alongside with Gazprom and Russian Railways, Inteco was included into the list of 295 strategic enterprises of the country.

These are Ireland - United Kingdom, Northern Italy - Austria - Germany, the Baltic States - Russia - Kazakhstan,\\" Baturina said in her interview to \\"Sobesednik\\". =Development business= In late 2015, Baturina launched a development business in New York with an initial investment of US$10 million. The first set of commercial buildings she acquired is located in central Brooklyn, the third largest business centre of the city after Lower and Midtown Manhattan. The company is considering transferring the land they are located on to a category suitable for residential construction, so that a large-scale development project can be realised. In November 2016 Baturina's structures launched a construction and development project in Europe. Her company acquired a land plot on the coastline in a primary area of Limassol, Cyprus, intended for constructing high-end residential properties. The overall investment into the project will amount to EUR 40 million, and the completion of the construction is planned for 2021. = Membrane Construction = In Autumn 2015, Baturina's structures became a strategic investor of Hightex GmbH, a global membrane construction company based in Rimsting, Germany, having acquired 75% of the company. Her involvement gave the project the necessary impetus to restructure its operations and future development. 25% of the company belongs to its founder Klaus-Michael Koch, one of the pioneers of membrane construction.

The next acquisitions under consideration are in Greece and Cyprus. The company is developing a subproject that consists in applying the technology that allows saving the energy obtained from renewable sources, which constitutes a whole new system of wise energy consumption. Another trend within the energy project is constructing and servicing individual solar parks located mostly on the roofs of enterprises ‚Äì the consumers of energy. In 2018 Baturina's enterprise has launched the first ESCO (Energy Services Company) project in Cyprus. The project consists in energy- consumption optimization at a client enterprise or a production.

The full text of the cable makes clear that Mr Beyrle is simply repeating gossip and allegations conveyed to him by journalist Sergei Kanev. Beyrle writes, 'Kanev told us that Luzhkov's wife, Yelena Baturina, definitely has links to the criminal world, and particularly to the Solntsevo criminal group'. Beyrle stated that her husband Yury Luzhkov sat on top of a \\"pyramid of corruption\\". \\"Luzhkov oversees a system in which it appears that almost everyone at every level is involved in some form of corruption or criminal behaviour,\\" wrote Beyrle. \\"Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in Moscow's criminal world. Luzhkov is at the top. The FSB, MVD and militia are at the second level. Finally ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.\\" Beyrle also suggested that much of Luzhkov's business empire had been acquired using municipal finances to invest in \\"less than transparent\\" projects with former Soviet republics. The couple denied the accusations as \\"total rubbish\\".  Personal wealth  In the 2019 ranking of The World's Billionaires, Baturina with $1,2 billion remains for the 14th consecutive year the richest woman of Russia. In the 2018 ranking of The World's Billionaires, published by Forbes on 6 March, Baturina with $1,2 billion was for the 13th consecutive year the richest woman of Russia, and the only Russian female billionaire. Baturina is also the only independent self- made woman entrepreneur in the construction section of the Forbes list; she is number 55 of 56 self-made women billionaires who have built their fortune from scratch. Altogether there are 227 women on the list, over 75% of them have inherited their wealth from family. According to Forbes, Baturina's net worth was US$4.2 billion in 2008, up from US$3.1 billion in 2007, US$2.3 billion in 2006 and US$1.1 billion in 2004. According to magazine Finans, her wealth fell during the credit crunch to just US$1 billion in February 2009, causing her to ask the Russian government for a bailout for Inteko. Her wealth, as of 2012, was listed as US$1.1 billion. Baturina has a diverse portfolio. She owns hotels in the Black Sea tourist resort of Sochi, a hotel in Dublin through a private foundation in Austria, other hotels in Austria and the Czech Republic, over 72,000 hectares of agricultural land in the Belgorod Oblast, and also a factory that produces a million cans of sweetened condensed milk each year.

In 2013 the Sunday Times included Baturina into the annual Sunday Times Rich List, the list of the wealthiest people in Britain. The Russian entrepreneur took the 122nd 12th in the women list. Afterwards a few British journalists pointed out that if you discount the number of women who made the list due to \\"family wealth\\" (which they may have contributed towards to a greater or lesser degree), inheritance or divorce ‚Äî the first self-made female richlister is Baturina. \\"Money is like cement in construction. Money is not a goal but a means to reach the goal, the opportunity to do the things you want to do. The more money I have, the more large scale tasks I can solve. But I think you will agree that not everyone who owns a lot of money ever sets himself any tasks\\".

Community involvement In 2006, Baturina was appointed Deputy Head for the inter-ministerial group under the national project \\"Affordable and Comfortable Housing for Russian citizens.\\" Baturina was the only representative of the construction industry in the group. In connection to the project Inteco formed a special commission that was inspecting various regions in Russia in order to evaluate the state of the local construction enterprises, to determine the demand for construction materials and to collect demographic and sociological data. As a result, the commission developed the concept of the federal target program \\"Development of the construction industry\\". Later on, the Government of the Russian Federation based its \\"Strategy of development of building materials industry up to 2020\\" on that program. In 2010, Baturina became one of the first business leaders to provide support to the victims of fires in the Tula region.

In 1992 their first daughter, Elena, was born, followed in 1994 by Olga. In November 2010 Luzhkov gave an interview to the Telegraph newspaper stating that the couple were sending their daughters to study in London to protect them from possible persecution by the Russian authorities. It is understood that the family owns a home in the affluent Kensington area of London, purchased in 2013 through an offshore company domiciled in Gibraltar. The property, near Holland Park, was reported in 2018 to be worth at least ¬£25 million. In her interviews Baturina often says that she and Luzhkov are very lucky, as they still love each other. She enjoys cooking his favourite dish, borscht, and claims that a traditional \\"Soviet upbringing\\" made a good housewife of her. Baturina has an older brother, Viktor Baturin, who is also a businessman. In 2007 Viktor Baturin tried to sue his sister's company Inteco for US$120 million for wrongful dismissal, but lost the case. Baturina has had no contacts with her brother since a public conflict on business issues that occurred in 2007 and resulted in mutual lawsuits, that later were settled. She is involved in a libel case against a former financial director for her brother. After failing to appear before a court in December 2019, the court declared Baturina a \\"fugitive\\". The subpoena was rescinded in late January by Elista City Court. Allegedly, the subpoena was issued under instruction from the A1 investment company as part of its financial claim to Elena Baturina.

The new party's platform was written by three residents of the city (Richard Rigg, Herman Saltzman and Jacob Penner), and it has been estimated that nearly 20% of the SDPC's total membership lived in Winnipeg during the early 1910s. The party was more pragmatic than the SPC, and cooperated with reformist labour groups. It benefited from the relative weakness of the SPC in Winnipeg following the provincial election of 1910. The SPC had contributed to reformist Fred Dixon's defeat in this election, and was shunned by many in the city's trade union movement as such. In the provincial election of 1914, the SDPC ran Arthur Beech and Herman Saltzman as candidate's for Winnipeg North's two ridings. Both candidates were defeated, due in part to the SDPC's insistence that further immigration to the city be curtailed in a time of high unemployment (Winnipeg North was home to many recent immigrants). The party fared better in the election of 1915, when Richard Rigg was elected for Winnipeg North's second seat. Rigg had defended the city's immigrant population in the past, and was elected despite strong SPC opposition. Beech finished a close second in the other Winnipeg North seat. Both of the SDPC's candidates were also endorsed by the Labour Representation Committee, a reformist organization. Rigg did not remain in parliament long, resigning in 1917 to contest Winnipeg North at the federal level. This time, he was endorsed by reformist labourites and Liberal supporters of Wilfrid Laurier because of his opposition to conscription. Support for the war was strong in western Canada, however, and Rigg was defeated by a supporter of Robert Borden's Union government. Labour radicalism in Winnipeg increased after the General Strike in 1919. In the following year's provincial election, the Dominion Labour Party, SPC and SDPC were able to present a united slate of candidates in Winnipeg, running a combined total of ten candidates for the city's ten seats (which were determined by preferential balloting). John Queen was the sole Social Democrat on the ballot, and was declared elected to the legislature. The SPDC joined the Federated Labour Party in 1920. Queen was re- elected as an \\"Independent Workers\\" candidate in 1922, and became leader of the province's Independent Labour Party caucus the following year.

It is the general notion that a person has of the common expectations that others have about actions and thoughts within a particular society, and thus serves to clarify their relation to the other as a representative member of a shared social system.John O'Neill, Sociology as a Skin Trade (London 1972) p. 169 Any time that an actor tries to imagine what is expected of them, they are taking on the perspective of the generalized other. Precursors Mead's concept of the generalised other has been linked to Adam Smith's notion of the impartial spectatorLars Udehn, Methodological Individualism (2001) p. 367n ‚Äì itself rooted in the earlier thinking of Addison and Epictectus.Nicholas Phillipson, Adam Smith: An Enlightened Life (2011) p. 107 Adam Smith wrote: \\"We Conceive ourselves as acting in the presence of a person quite candid and equitable, of one who...is meerly a man in general, an impartial Spectator who considers our conduct with the same indifference with which we regard that of other people\\".Quoted in Phillipson, pp. 164‚Äì5 Role-play and games Mead began by contrasting the experience of role-play and pretence in early childhood, in which one role simply gives way to a different one without any continuity, with that of the organised game: \\"in the latter\\", he stated, \\"the child must have the attitude of all the others involved in that game\\".George H. Mead, Mind, Self, and Society (Chicago 1962) pp. 159, 154 He saw the organised game as vital for the formation of a mature sense of self, which can only be achieved by learning to respond to, and take on board, the others' attitudes toward the (changing) common undertakings they are involved in: i.e. the generalized other.Mead, p. 155 Mead argued that \\"in the game we get an organized other, a generalized other, which is found in the nature of the child itself....in the case of such a social group as a ball team, the team is the generalized other in so far as it enters ‚Äì as an organized process or social activity ‚Äì into the experience of any one of the individual members of it\\".Mead, pp. 160, 154 By seeing things from an anonymous perspective, that of the other, the child may eventually be able to visualize the intentions and expectations of others, and see him/herself from the point of view of groups of others ‚Äì the viewpoint of the generalized other. The attitude of the generalized other is the attitude of the larger community. According to Mead, the generalized other is the vehicle by which we are linked to society. Multiple generalized others Arguably, a modern differentiated society contains as many generalized others as there are social groupings:F. C. da Silva, G. H. Mead (2007) p. 50 as Mead put it, \\"every individual member of any given human society, of course, belongs to a large number of such different functional groups\\".Mead, p. 322 The result is that everybody will articulate aspects of the range of socio-cultural values in their own way, taking on the perspectives of a set of generalized others in a unique synthesis.da Silva, pp. 50‚Äì1 With rising levels of socialisation and individuation, more and more people, and more and more aspects of the self come into play in the dialectic of self and generalized other.Johannes Voelz, Transcendental Resistance (2010) p. 131 Psychoanalytic equivalents As a concept, the generalised other is roughly equivalent to the idea of the Freudian superego. It has also been compared to Lacan's use of the Name of the Father, as the third party created by the presence of social convention, law, and language in all human interaction.Vincent Crapanzano, Hermes' Dilemma and Hamlet's Desire (1992) pp. 88‚Äì9 It is also similar to Bakhtin's (Superaddressee) \\"superaddressee\\" presumed to receive and understand human communication.

Wooden coffins (or caskets) decompose, and often the weight of earth on top of the coffin, or the passage of heavy cemetery maintenance equipment over it, can cause the casket to collapse and the soil above it to settle. About burial vaults A burial vault is prepared for shipment by an employee at Clark Grave Vault, Columbus, Ohio, 1938. The burial vault or burial liner is designed to prevent the weight of earth or heavy cemetery maintenance equipment from collapsing the coffin beneath. Coffin collapse will cause the ground to sink and settle, marring the appearance of the cemetery and making it harder to maintain. Burial vaults originally emerged as a means of ensuring that grave robbers could not easily access a coffin and remove valuables, clothing, or even bodies from the coffin. Early vaults were made of wood (the \\"rough box\\"), although by the middle of the 1800s brick, iron and later steel vaults were used. By the late 1800s, the fashion of burying the deceased with jewelry lost favor. However, the value of burial vaults in ensuring that the ground did not settle over graves was seen, and burial vaults began to be more widely used. By the early part of the 20th century, concrete (and, later, reinforced concrete) vaults became more common. Although quite commonly used in many industrialized countries, the burial vault is very much a funerary item used almost exclusively in the 20th century. In the United States, the burial vault was largely unknown until the 1880s when the L.G. Haase Manufacturing Co., which owned a cemetery in Illinois, conceived the burial vault as a means of adding a product line to their funerary sales. As late as 1915, only 5 to 10 percent of funerals in the United States used a burial vault or liner. In the 1930s, company owner Wilbert Haase, who had an interest in Egyptian mummification, began promoting the sealed (or \\"waterproof\\") vault as a means of allegedly protecting the body from water, microbes, and vermin. The Haase company later purchased several plastics companies, and began manufacturing plastic burial vaults as well. The company dominates the American burial vault market today, with about 12 percent of all vault and liner sales. A burial vault encloses a coffin on all four sides, the top, and the bottom. Modern burial vaults are lowered into the grave, and the coffin lowered into the vault. A lid is then lowered to cover the coffin and seal the vault. Modern burial vaults may be made of concrete, metal, or plastic. Because the sides of the burial vault are attached to the bottom of the vault, the burial vault is generally stronger than a burial liner. Some burial vaults reverse the construction, so that only a base is placed beneath the coffin. The lid consists of the four sides and the top. These types of burial vaults allow a better seal between the lid and base. A burial liner is similar to a burial vault, but does not have a bottom. With a burial liner, the coffin is lowered directly onto the earth. The burial liner is then lowered over the coffin. Modern burial liners may also be made of concrete, metal, or plastic. Many come in a wide array of colors, even stripes. Burial vaults do not prevent the decomposition of the human remains within. Vaults which are installed incorrectly and too tightly sealed may not allow gases generated by the decomposing body to escape. Pressure then builds up within the vault until the vault ruptures, causing the vault to fail. Although some manufacturers of burial vaults claim that their vaults are \\"green\\" (environmentally friendly) and prevent the toxic chemicals used in embalming from leaching into the surrounding soil, such claims are uniformly false since the vault cannot be hermetically sealed without causing it to rupture from the pressure of decomposing gases. A truly \\"green\\" or natural burial does not use embalming fluids, and does not attempt to protect the body from the soil and rapid decomposition. Modern burial vaults often come in a variety of styles, which can greatly increase the cost. Modern vaults and liners sometimes are lined on the inside with bronze, copper, fiberglass, or stainless steel sheeting, and some vaults and liners are inscribed on the outer surface with words, scenes, or other images. Some jurisdictions require the use of a burial vault or burial liner. For example, several U.S. states require them. In some cases, cemeteries require the use of a burial vault or liner, although it is not a legal requirement. World usage Data on the use of burial vaults and liners outside the United States is very difficult to come by, and usage rates are not known. Burial vaults and liners are almost unheard of in China and Japan. Cremation is required in China, and is used in 90 percent of burials in Japan. They are also uncommon in Italy. In modern Italy, burial plots (either below-ground or in wall loculi) are re-used after a period of years, usually 10 to 25. At that time, most of the soft body parts have decomposed, and the bones are removed to an ossuary. In the United States, the use of burial vaults is also decreasing, caused by a sharp rise in the number of cremations. Whereas 36 percent of all deceased were cremated in the United States in 2008, the National Association of Funeral Directors forecast this to rise to 46 percent by 2015 and 59 percent by 2025. Jewish law does not bar the use of burial vaults or liners, and their use is permitted where law or a cemetery requires them. But Morrison David Bial argues that burial vaults are antithetical to traditional Judaism, in part because they deny the reality of death (e.g., inhibit decomposition of the body) and in part because they are ostentatious and undercut the equality of all people at death. Islamic law requires only that the body be washed, anointed, and wrapped in linen for burial. Funerals must be kept simple, and no ostentation is allowed. Preferably, the body should be buried without coffin or burial vault, although such is permitted if required by law. Generally, Muslims prefer to have separate cemeteries due to the specific preference for burial without coffin or vault. Criticisms Burial vaults and liners do not decompose, and have been criticized as being environmentally unfriendly. Burial vaults and liners consumed more than of steel and more than of reinforced concrete in 2009. A burial vault or liner is not the only solution to settling earth over the grave. Traditional burials with a casket leave a larger void and thus create more settlement when the casket decomposes or collapses. Natural or \\"green\\" burials do not use a casket, which means only minimal settling. In either case, the cemetery can remedy sunken graves by filling in the settled area.

In the late 18th century, scientists developed sensitive instruments for detecting 'electrification', otherwise known as electrostatic charge imbalance. The phenomenon of electrification by contact, or contact tension, was quickly discovered. When two objects were touched together, sometimes the objects became spontaneously charged. One object developed a net negative charge, while the other developed an equal and opposite positive charge. Then it was discovered that 'piles' of dissimilar metal disks separated by acid-soaked cloth, Voltaic piles, could also produce charge differences. Although it was later found that these effects were caused by different physical processes - triboelectricity, the Volta effect, differing work functions of metals, and others - at the time they were all thought to be caused by a common 'contact electrification' process. The contact electrification phenomenon allowed the construction of so-called 'frictional' electrostatic generators such as Ramsden's or Winter's machines, but it also led directly to the development of useful devices such as batteries, fuel cells, electroplating, thermocouples. Contact between materials is responsible for such modern electrical technology as semiconductor junction devices including radio detector diodes, photocells, LEDs, and thermoelectric cells.  History  The theory held that static electricity was generated by means of contact between dissimilar materials, and was in close agreement with the principles of static electricity as then understood. It was eventually replaced by the current theory of electrochemistry, namely, that electricity is generated by the action of chemistry and the exchange of electrons between atoms making up the battery. An important fact leading to the rejection of the theory of contact tension was the observation that corrosion, that is, the chemical degradation of the battery, seemed unavoidable with its use, and that the more electricity was drawn from the battery, the faster the corrosion proceeded. The Volta effect (described below) corresponds to a weak electric potential difference developed by the contact of different metals. Nowadays, this is often known as a contact potential difference. This effect was first discovered by Alessandro Volta, and can be measured using a capacitance electroscope comprising different metals. However, this effect does not, by itself, account for the action of electric batteries. A number of high voltage dry piles were invented between the early 19th century and the 1830s in an attempt to determine the answer to this question, and specifically to support Volta‚Äôs hypothesis of contact tension. The Oxford Electric Bell is one example. Francis Ronalds in 1814 was one of the first to realise that dry piles also worked through chemical reaction rather than metal to metal contact, even though corrosion was not visible due to the very small currents generated. Triboelectric contact If two different insulators are touched together, such as when a piece of rubber is touched against a piece of glass, then the surface of the rubber will acquire an excess negative charge, and the glass will acquire an equal positive charge. If the surfaces are then pulled apart, a very high voltage is produced. This so-called \\"tribo\\" or \\"rubbing\\" effect is not well understood. It may be caused by electron-stealing via quantum tunneling, or by transfer of surface ions. Friction is not required, although in many situations it greatly increases the phenomenon. Certain phenomena related to frictionally generated electrostatic charges have been known since antiquity, though of course the modern theory of electricity was developed after the Scientific Revolution. =Solid-solid contact= The mechanism of contact electrification (CE) between solid-solid has been debated for more than 2600 years. A most controversial topic in CE is the identity of the charge carriers: electron transfer, ion transfer or even materials species transfer. Recent studies by using Kelvin probe force microscopy suggest that electron transfer is the dominating charge carrier in CE for solid-solid cases. When the interatomic distance between two atoms belonging to two materials is shorter than the normal bonding length (typically ~0.2 nm), the electrons will transfer at the interface. It implies that a strong electron cloud overlap (or wave function overlap) between the two atoms/molecules in the repulsive region will reduce the interatomic potential barrier (Fig. 1), and result in electron transition between the atoms/molecules. The contact/friction force in CE is to induce strong overlap between the electron clouds (or wave function in physics, bonding in chemistry). Fig. 1 The overlapped electron-cloud (OEC) model for general case contact-electrification. =Liquid-solid contact= Besides ion transfer at liquid-solid interface, electron transfer occurs as well. As for the liquid-solid case, molecules in the liquid would have electron cloud overlap with the atoms on the solid surface at the very first contact with a virginal solid surface, and electron transfer is required in order to create the first layer of electrostatic charges on the solid surface. Then, ion transfer is the second step, which is a redistribution of the ions in solution considering electrostatic interactions with the charged solid surface (Fig. 2). Both electron transfer and ion transfer co-exist at liquid- solid interface. Fig. 2 The \\"two-step\\" model (Wang model) for the formation of electric double-layer (EDL) at a liquid-solid interface, in which the electron transfer plays a dominant role in the first step. Electrolytic-metallic contact If a piece of metal is touched against an electrolytic material, the metal will spontaneously become charged, while the electrolyte will acquire an equal and opposite charge. Upon first contact, a chemical reaction called a 'half-cell reaction' occurs on the metal surface. As metal ions are transferred to or from the electrolyte, and as the metal and electrolyte become oppositely charged, the increasing voltage at the thin insulating layer between metal and electrolyte will oppose the motion of the flowing ions, causing the chemical reaction to come to a stop. If a second piece of a different type of metal is placed in the same electrolyte bath, it will charge up and rise to a different voltage. If the first metal piece is touched against the second, the voltage on the two metal pieces will be forced closer together, and the chemical reactions will run constantly. In this way the 'contact electrification' becomes continuous. At the same time, an electric current will appear, with the path forming a closed loop which leads from one metal part to the other, through the chemical reactions on the first metal surface, through the electrolyte, then back through the chemical reactions on the second metal surface. In this way, contact electrification leads to the invention of the Galvanic cell or battery. See also: Dry pile Metallic contact If two metals having differing work functions are touched together, one steals electrons from the other, and the opposite net charges grow larger and larger; this is the Volta effect. The process is halted when the difference in electric potential (electrostatic potential) between the two metals reaches a particular value, namely the difference in work function values - usually less than one volt. At this point, the Fermi levels for the two metals are equal, and there is no voltage difference between them. [If there were a voltage difference between them, then a current would flow between them: so \\"zero current\\" implies \\"zero voltage difference\\".] Semiconductor contact If a metal touches a semiconductor material, or if two different semiconductors are placed into contact, one becomes charged slightly positive and the other slightly negative. It is found that if this junction between semiconductors is connected to a power supply, and if the power supply is set to a voltage slightly higher than the natural voltage appearing because of contact electrification, then for one polarity of voltage there will be a current between the two semiconductor parts, but if the polarity is reversed, the current stops. Thus contact between materials lead to the invention of the semiconductor diode or rectifier and triggered the revolution in semiconductor electronics and physics. In materials with a direct band gap, if bright light is aimed at one part of the contact area between the two semiconductors, the voltage at that spot will rise, and an electric current will appear. When considering light in the context of contact electrification, the light energy is changed directly into electrical energy, allowing creation of solar cells. Later it was found that the same process can be reversed, and if a current is forced backwards across the contact region between the semiconductors, sometimes light will be emitted, allowing creation of the light-emitting diode (LED).

The party enjoyed its greatest success in the province of Manitoba. In March 1918, Arthur Puttee and members of the Winnipeg Trades and Labour Congress (TLC) created the first branch of the Dominion Labour Party in Canada. The DLP was an ideological successor to various other reformist labour groups in Winnipeg, but was more explicitly socialist and actively cooperated with members of the Social Democratic Party of Canada. The Winnipeg local included such figures as Harry Veitch, Fred Tipping, and Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Fred Dixon. In the years after its formation, the DLP would set up other branches in cities throughout the Canadian prairies. It never had a strong central organization, and was more of a network than an organized movement. The Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 radicalized labour politics in Manitoba, and the DLP soon emerged as a much stronger force than the province's earlier labour parties had been. In the provincial election of 1920, the party formed an electoral alliance with the Socialist Party of Canada, the Social Democrats and a party representing returning ex-soldiers. Dixon easily topped the polled in Winnipeg, and eight other Labour MLAs were elected throughout the province (along with one Socialist and one Social Democrat). Among the new Labour MLAs were William Ivens, then serving a prison sentence, and A. E. Smith, who later joined Communist Party of Canada. Strictly speaking, not all of these figures were elected as Dominion Labour Party candidates: Smith, though a member of the DLP, campaigned under the banner of the \\"Brandon Labour Party\\". The DLP, however, provided the basic framework around which the provincial campaign was based. Dixon was the unquestioned leader of the labour group in the legislature. Late in 1920, the DLP split between followers of the American Federation of Labor and the One Big Union. When AFL supporters nominated an opponent of the General Strike as a DLP municipal candidate in Winnipeg, many others walked out and formed the rival Independent Labour Party. Dixon, who had previously been neutral, was the leader of the late 1920 walkout. Most other labour parliamentarians also left the DLP for the ILP, with Smith as the only prominent exception. The ILP subsequently became the dominant labour party in Manitoba. The DLP aligned itself with the new Canadian Labour Party, and soon ceased to exist in the province as an independent organization.

It has a population of 220,181 as of 2020. Ramparts of El Jadida From the sea, El Jadida's old city has a very \\"un- Moorish\\" appearance because of its massive Portuguese-built walls of hewn stone, one of the Seven Wonders of Portuguese Origin in the World. The Portuguese Fortified City of Mazagan was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004, on the basis of its status as an \\"outstanding example of the interchange of influences between European and Moroccan cultures\\" and as an \\"early example of the realisation of the Renaissance ideals integrated with Portuguese construction technology\\". According to UNESCO, the most important buildings from the Portuguese period are the cistern, and the Manueline Church of the Assumption. The city, and particularly its neighboring town of Sidi Bouzid, becomes extremely busy in the summer season with an influx of mainly Moroccan holiday-makers. Nearby is the five-star resort complex of Mazagan, which attracts some middle-class Moroccans as well as many international visitors from the Arabian Peninsula as well as from Europe and beyond. Mazagan complex has a golf course designed by Gary Player, casino, nightclub and restaurants. Between Mazagan complex and El Jadida is the Pullman Hotel, attached to which is Royal Golf El Jadida, another 18-hole course. The presence of nearby ports and factories is responsible for the pollution of El Jadida's beaches. The city is expanding as of 2014, partly as a result of increased activity at the nearby Jorf Lasfar port and its industrial zone.  Names  El Jadida's former names were: Cap Soleis, Portus Rutilis, Rusibis, Mazighen (Arabic: ŸÖÿßÿ≤Ÿäÿ∫ŸÜ, Berber: ‚µé‚¥∞‚µ£‚µâ‚¥≥‚¥ª‚µè), al-Breyja (Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ±Ÿäÿ¨ÿ©), Mazag√£o (Arabic: ŸÖÿßÿ≤ÿß⁄ØÿßŸà, Berber: ‚µé‚¥∞‚µ£‚¥∞‚¥≥‚¥∞‚µ°), al-Mahdouma (Arabic: ÿßŸÑŸÖŸáÿØŸàŸÖÿ©) and Mazagan (Arabic: ŸÖÿßÿ≤ÿß⁄ØÿßŸÜ, Berber: ‚µé‚¥∞‚µ£‚¥∞‚¥≥‚¥∞‚µè), Landmarks *The Portuguese cistern *The Cannons and the Fortress *The Old Port *The city's beach *The Municipal Theater (Mohamed Afifi Theater) *The Municipality building *The Post building *The Great Mosque *The Old City *The Red Chateau *The Lighthouse of Sidi Abou Wafi *The equestrian complex =Portuguese cistern= Manueline cistern of the El Jadida fortress. Expanded since 1514, this former warehouse (possibly an armory) was converted into a cistern in the sixteenth century. The underground chamber, measuring 34 meters by 34 meters, was constructed with five rows of five stone pillars. The cistern is famous especially for the thin layer of water that covers the floor, and which creates fine and ever- changing reflections from the little light there is and the spartan shapes of the columns and the roof. Its visual qualities are such that several movies have been filmed within the cavernous space, of which Orson Welles' Othello is the best known internationally. =Fortress of Mazagan= The design of the Fortress of Mazagan is a response to the development of modern artillery in the Renaissance. The star form of the fortress measures c 250m by 300m. The slightly inclined, massive walls are c 8m high on average, with a thickness of 10m, enclosing a patrolling peripheral walkway 2m wide. At the present time the fortification has four bastions: the Angel Bastion in the east, St Sebastian in the north, St Antoine in the west, and the Holy Ghost Bastion in the south. The fifth, the Governor's Bastion at the main entrance, is in ruins, having been destroyed by the Portuguese in 1769. Numerous colonial-era Portuguese cannons are still positioned on top of the bastions. The fort had three gates: the Seagate, forming a small port with the north-east rampart, the Bull Gate in the north-west rampart, and the main entrance with a double arch in the centre of the south rampart, originally connected to land via a drawbridge. A ditch, c 20m wide and 3m deep, formerly filled with seawater, surrounded the fort. During the time of the French Protectorate the ditch was filled in with earth and a new entrance gate was opened leading to the main street, the Rua da Carreira, and to the Seagate. Along this street are situated the best preserved historic buildings, including the Catholic Church of the Assumption and the cistern. History Map of Mazagan created by the US government in 1942. El Jadida, was first known as al-Breyja when it was seized by the Portuguese in 1502. Then, it became known as Mazag√£o. The Portuguese built a citadel in 1514, and a larger fortification in 1541. The Portuguese would continue to control the city until 1769, when they abandoned Mazag√£o, their last territory in Morocco. Upon their forced departure, the Portuguese destroyed the Governor's Bastion and evacuated to the Portuguese colony of Brazil, where they founded a new settlement called Nova Mazag√£o (now in Amap√°). The city was then taken over by Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah in 1769 and remained uninhabited, having been dubbed al-Mahdouma (The Ruined). Eventually, Sultan Abd al-Rahman of Morocco ordered that a mosque be built and the destroyed portions of the city rebuilt. The reinvigorated city was renamed al-Jadida, or The New. Climate Market, El Jadida, 2012 El Jadida has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Csa). In winter there is more rainfall than in summer. The average annual temperature in El Jadida is . About of precipitation falls annually.

It occurred between 1904 and 1908. In January 1904, the Herero people, who were led by Samuel Maharero, and the Nama people, who were led by Captain Hendrik Witbooi, rebelled against German colonial rule. On January 12, they massacred more than 100 German men in the area of Okahandja, though sparing women and children. In August, German General Lothar von Trotha defeated the Ovaherero in the Battle of Waterberg and drove them into the desert of Omaheke, where most of them died of dehydration. In October, the Nama people also rebelled against the Germans, only to suffer a similar fate. Between 24,000 and 100,000 Hereros, 10,000 Nama and an unknown number of San died in the genocide. The first phase of the genocide was characterized by widespread death from starvation and dehydration, due to the prevention of the Herero from leaving the Namib Desert by German forces. Once defeated, thousands of Hereros and Namas were imprisoned in concentration camps, where the majority died of diseases, abuse, and exhaustion. In 1985, the United Nations' Whitaker Report classified the aftermath as an attempt to exterminate the Herero and Nama peoples of South West Africa, and therefore one of the earliest attempts at genocide in the 20th century. In 2004, the German government recognized and apologized for the events, but ruled out financial compensation for the victims' descendants. In July 2015, the German government and the speaker of the Bundestag officially called the events a \\"genocide\\". However, it has refused to consider reparations. Despite this, the last batch of skulls and other remains of slaughtered tribesman which were taken to Germany to promote racial superiority were taken back to Namibia in 2018, with Petra Bosse-Huber, a German Protestant bishop, describing the event as \\"the first genocide of the 20th century\\".

Central figure Lieutenant General Lothar von Trotha, the Oberbefehlshaber (Supreme Commander) of the protection force in German South West Africa, in Keetmanshoop during the Herero uprising, 1904. The original inhabitants of what is now Namibia were the Bushmen and the Hottentots, both of whom were Hunter-gatherers who spoke dialects of the Khoisan language. Herero, who spoke a Bantu language, were originally a group of cattle herders who migrated into what is now Namibia during the mid-18th century. The Herero seized vast swaths of the arable upper plateaus which were ideal for cattle grazing. Agricultural duties, which were minimal, were assigned to enslaved Hottentots and Bushmen. Over the rest of the 18th century, the Herero slowly drove the Hottentots into the dry, rugged hills to the South and East. Robert Gaudi (2017), African Kaiser: General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck and the Great War in Africa, 1914-1918, Caliber. Pages 69-70. The Heroros were a pastoral people whose entire way of life centered on their cattle. The Herero language, while limited in its vocabulary for most areas, contained over a thousand words for the colours and markings of cattle. The Hereros were content to live in peace as long as their cattle were safe and well-pastured, but became formidable warriors when their cattles were threatened. According to Robert Gaudi, \\"The newcomers, much taller and more fiercely warlike than the indigenous Khoisan people's, were possessed of the fierceness that comes from basing one's way of life on a single source: everything they valued, all wealth and personal happiness, had to do with cattle. Regarding the care and protection of their herds, the Herero showed themselves utterly merciless, and far more 'savage' than the Hottentots had ever been. Because of their dominant ways and elegant bearing, the few Europeans who encountered Herero tribesmen in the early days regarded them as the region's 'natural aristocrats.'\\" Robert Gaudi (2017), African Kaiser: General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck and the Great War in Africa, 1914-1918, Caliber. Page 70. By the time of the Scramble for Africa, the area occupied by the Herero was known as Damaraland. The Nama were pastorals and traders and lived to the South of the Herero. In 1883, Franz Adolf Eduard L√ºderitz, a German merchant, purchased a stretch of coast near the Angra Pequena bay from the reigning chief. The terms of the purchase were fraudulent, but the German government nonetheless established a protectorate over it.Jan-Bart Gewald (1998) Herero heroes: a socio-political history of the Herero of Namibia, 1890‚Äì1923, James Currey, Oxford At that time, it was the only overseas German territory deemed suitable for white settlement.Peace and freedom, Volume 40, Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, page 57, The Section, 1980 Chief of the neighbouring Herero, Maharero rose to power by uniting all the Herero. Faced with repeated attacks by the Khowesin, a clan of the Khoikhoi under Hendrik Witbooi, he signed a protection treaty on 21 October 1885 with Imperial Germany's colonial governor Heinrich Ernst G√∂ring (father of World War I flying ace and Nazi Luftwaffe commander Hermann G√∂ring) but did not cede the land of the Herero. This treaty was renounced in 1888 due to lack of German support against Witbooi but it was reinstated in 1890. The Herero leaders repeatedly complained about violation of this treaty, as Herero women and girls were raped by German soldiers, a crime that the German authorities were reluctant to punish.Marcia Klotz (1994) White women and the dark continent: gender and sexuality in German colonial discourse from the sentimental novel to the fascist film, Thesis (Ph. D.) ‚Äì Stanford University, p. 72: \\"Although records show that Herero leaders repeatedly complained that Germans were raping Herero women and girls with impunity, not a single case of rape came before the colonial courts before the uprising because the Germans looked upon such offences as mere peccadilloes.\\" In 1890 Maharero's son, Samuel, signed a great deal of land over to the Germans in return for helping him to ascend to the Ovaherero throne, and to subsequently be established as paramount chief. German involvement in ethnic fighting ended in tenuous peace in 1894. In that year, Theodor Leutwein became governor of the territory, which underwent a period of rapid development, while the German government sent the Schutztruppe (imperial colonial troops) to pacify the region.\\"A bloody history: Namibia's colonisation\\", BBC News, 29 August 2001 = German colonial policy = Under German colonial rule, natives were routinely used as slave labourers, and their lands were frequently confiscated and given to colonists, who were encouraged to settle on land taken from the natives; that land was stocked with cattle stolen from the Herero and Namas,Bridgman, Jon M.

Over the next decade, the land and the cattle that were essential to Herero and Nama lifestyles passed into the hands of German settlers arriving in South West Africa. Theodor Leutwein later wrote, \\"The Hereros from early years were a freedom-loving people, courageous and proud beyond measure. On the one hand, there was the progressive extension of German rule over them, and on the other their own sufferings increasing from year to year.\\" Robert Gaudi (2017), African Kaiser: General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck and the Great War in Africa, 1914-1918, Caliber. Page 76. In January 1903, \\"a sex-starved German trader\\" named Dietrich was walking from his homestead to the nearby town of Omaruru to buy a new horse. Halfway to Dietrich's destination, a wagon carrying the son of a Herero chief, his wife, and their son stopped by. In a common courtesy in Hereroland, the Chief's son offered Dietrich a ride. Robert Gaudi (2017), African Kaiser: General Paul von Lettow- Vorbeck and the Great War in Africa, 1914-1918, Caliber. Page 75. That night, however, Dietrich got very drunk and after everyone was asleep, he attempted to rape the wife of the Chief's son. When she resisted, Dietrich shot her dead. When he was tried for murder in Windhoek, Dietrich denied attempting to rape his victim. He alleged that he awoke thinking the camp was under attack and fired blindly into the darkness. The killing of the Herero woman, he claimed, was an unfortunate accident. The court acquitted him, alleging that Dietrich was suffering from \\"tropical fever\\" and temporary insanity. Robert Gaudi (2017), African Kaiser: General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck and the Great War in Africa, 1914-1918, Caliber. Page 75. According to Major Theodor Leutwein, the new Governor of German Southwest Africa, the murder, \\"aroused extraordinary interest in Hereroland, especially since the murdered woman had been the wife of the son of a Chief and the daughter of another. Everywhere the question was asked: Have White people the right to shoot native woman?\\" Robert Gaudi (2017), African Kaiser: General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck and the Great War in Africa, 1914-1918, Caliber. Page 75. Against the violent objections of German settlers who considered him a \\"Race traitor,\\" Leutwein intervened and insisted upon a second trial for Dietrich before the colony's supreme Court. This time, Dietrich was found guilty of manslaughter and imprisoned. Robert Gaudi (2017), African Kaiser: General Paul von Lettow- Vorbeck and the Great War in Africa, 1914-1918, Caliber. Page 76. = Rising Tension = In 1903, some of the Nama clans rose in revolt under the leadership of Hendrik Witbooi. A number of factors led the Herero to join them in January 1904. One of the major issues was land rights. In 1903 the Herero learned of a plan to divide their territory with a railway line and set up reservations where they would be concentrated.Samuel Totten, Paul Robert Bartrop, Steven L. Jacobs (2007) Dictionary of Genocide: A-L, p.184, Greenwood Press, Westport, Conn. The Herero had already ceded over a quarter of their to German colonists by 1903, before the Otavi railway line running from the African coast to inland German settlements was completed. Completion of this line would have made the German colonies much more accessible and would have ushered a new wave of Europeans into the area.Drechsler, Horst (1980) Let Us Die Fighting: the struggle of the Herero and Nama against German imperialism (1884‚Äì1915), Zed Press, London Historian Horst Drechsler states that there was discussion of the possibility of establishing and placing the Herero in native reserves and that this was further proof of the German colonists' sense of ownership over the land. Drechsler illustrates the gap between the rights of a European and an African; the German Colonial League held that, in regards to legal matters, the testimony of seven Africans was equivalent to that of a colonist. Bridgman writes about racial tensions underlying these developments; the average German colonist viewed native Africans as a lowly source of cheap labour, and others welcomed their extermination. A new policy on debt collection, enforced in November 1903, also played a role in the uprising. For many years, the Herero population had fallen in the habit of borrowing money from colonist moneylenders at extreme interest rates (see usury). For a long time, much of this debt went uncollected and accumulated, as most Herero had no means to pay. To correct this growing problem, Governor Leutwein decreed with good intentions that all debts not paid within the next year would be voided. In the absence of hard cash, traders often seized cattle, or whatever objects of value they could get their hands on, as collateral. This fostered a feeling of resentment towards the Germans on the part of the Herero people, which escalated to hopelessness when they saw that German officials were sympathetic to the moneylenders who were about to lose what they were owed. Racial tension was also at play. White settlers normally referred to black Africans as ‚Äúbaboons‚Äù and treated them with contempt. One missionary reported: ‚ÄúThe real cause of the bitterness among the Hereros toward the Germans is without question the fact that the average German looks down upon the natives as being about on the same level as the higher primates (‚Äòbaboon‚Äô being their favorite term for the natives) and treats them like animals. The settler holds that the native has a right to exist only in so far as he is useful to the white man. This sense of contempt led the settlers to commit violence against the Hereros.‚Äù The contempt manifested itself particularly in the mistreatment of native women. In a practice referred to by the Germans as \\"Verkafferung\\", the native women were taken by the German man by peace and by force. = Revolts = In 1903, the Hereros saw an opportunity to revolt. At that time, there was a distant Hottentot tribe in the south called the Bondelzwarts, who resisted German demands to register their guns. The Bondelzwarts engaged in a firefight with the German authorities which led to three Germans killed and a fourth wounded. The situation deteriorated further, and the governor of the Herero colony, Major Theodor Leutwin, went south to take personal command, leaving almost no troops in the north. The Herero revolted in early 1904, killing between 123 and 150 German settlers, as well as seven Boers and three women, in what Nils Ole Oermann calls a \\"desperate surprise attack\\".Geoff Eley and James Retallack, (2004) Wilhelminism and Its Legacies: German Modernities, Imperialism, and the Meanings of Reform, 1890‚Äì1930, p.171, Berghahn Books, NY The timing of their attack was carefully planned. After successfully asking a large Herero clan to surrender their weapons, Governor Leutwein was convinced that they and the rest of the native population were essentially pacified and so withdrew half of the German troops stationed in the colony. Led by Chief Samuel Maharero, the Herero surrounded Okahandja and cut links to Windhoek, the colonial capital. Maharero then issued a manifesto in which he forbade his troops to kill any Englishmen, Boers, uninvolved peoples, women and children in general, or German missionaries. The Heroro revolts catalysed a separate revolt and attack on Fort Namutoni in the north of the country a few weeks later by the Ondonga. A Herero warrior interviewed by German authorities in 1895 had described his people's traditional way of dealing with suspected cattle rustlers, a treatment which, during the uprising, was regularly extended to German soldiers and civilians, \\"We came across a few Hottentots whom of course we killed. I myself helped to kill one of them. First we cut off his ears, saying, 'You will never hear Herero cattle lowing.' Then we cut off his nose, saying, 'Never again shall you smell Herero cattle.' And then we cut off his lips, saying, 'You shall never again taste Herero cattle.' And finally we cut his throat.\\" Robert Gaudi (2017), African Kaiser: General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck and the Great War in Africa, 1914-1918, Caliber. Pages 70-71. According to Robert Gaudi, \\"Leutwein knew that the wrath of the German Empire was about to fall on them and hoped to soften the blow. He sent desperate messages to Chief Samuel Maherero in hopes of negotiating an end to the war. In this, Leutwein acted on his own, heedless of the prevailing mood in Germany, which called for bloody revenge.\\" Robert Gaudi (2017), African Kaiser: General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck and the Great War in Africa, 1914-1918, Caliber. Page 80. The Hereros, however, were emboldened by their success and had come to believe that, \\"the Germans were too cowardly to fight in the open,\\" and rejected Leutwein's offers of peace.

According to Robert Gaudi, \\"The Germans suffered more than defeat in the early months of 1904; they suffered humiliation, their brilliant modern army unable to defeat a rabble of 'half-naked savages.' Cries in the Reichstag, and from the Kaiser himself, for total eradication of the Hereros grew strident. When a leading member of the Social Democratic Party pointed out that the Hereros were as human as any German and possessed immortal souls, he was howled down by the entire conservative side of the legislature.\\" Robert Gaudi (2017), African Kaiser: General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck and the Great War in Africa, 1914-1918, Caliber. Page 81. Leutwein was forced to request reinforcements and an experienced officer from the German government in Berlin. Lieutenant-General Lothar von Trotha was appointed Supreme Commander () of South West Africa on 3 May 1904, arriving with an expeditionary force of 14,000 troops on 11 June. Meanwhile, Leutwein was subordinate to the Colonial Department of the Prussian Foreign Office, which reported to Chancellor Bernhard von B√ºlow while General Trotha reported to the military German General Staff, which was only subordinate to Emperor Wilhelm II. Leutwein wanted to defeat the most determined Herero rebels and negotiate a surrender with the remainder to achieve a political settlement. Trotha, however, planned to crush the native resistance through military force. He stated that: By late spring of 1904, German troops were pouring into the colony. In August, 1904, the main Herero forces were surrounded and crushed at the Battle of Waterberg.  Genocide  In 1900, Kaiser Wilhelm II had been enraged by the killing of Baron Klemens von Ketteler, the Imperial German minister-plenipotentiary in Beijing, during the Boxer Rebellion. The Kaiser took it as a personal insult from a people he viewed as racially inferior, all the more because of his obsession with the \\"Yellow Peril\\". On 27 July 1900, the Kaiser gave the infamous Hunnenrede (Hun speech) in Bremerhaven to German soldiers being sent to Imperial China, ordering them to show the Chinese no mercy and to behave like Attilla's Huns. General von Trotha had served in China, and was chosen in 1904 to command the expedition to German Southwest Africa precisely because of his record in China. In 1904, Wilhelm was furious about a revolt in his colony by a people he also viewed as inferior, and likewise took the Herero rebellion as a personal insult, just as he had viewed the assassination of Ketteler. The bloodthirsty language that Wilhelm II used about the Herero in 1904 was strikingly similar to the language he used against the Chinese in 1900. However, Wilhelm denied, together with reichskanzler von B√ºlow, von Trotha's request to quickly quell the rebellion. No written order by Wilhelm II ordering or authorising genocide has survived. In February 1945 a RAF bombing raid destroyed the building housing all of the documents of the Prussian Army from the Imperial period, creating a lacuna in the historical record, as hardly any documents relating to the Herero uprising and genocide survived the fire. The tactics used by Trotha were the same tactics that he had used in China, only on a vaster scale. It is also known that throughout the genocide Trotha remained in regular contact with both the General Staff and with the Kaiser. Regardless of if a written order was given or not, there are historians who believe that the Supreme Warlord had given Trotha verbal orders. The fact that Trotha was decorated by Wilhelm II and was not court- martialled after the genocide became public lends support to the thesis that he had been acting under orders. General Trotha stated his proposed solution to end the resistance of the Herero people in a letter, before the Battle of Waterberg: Trotha's troops defeated 3,000‚Äì5,000 Herero combatants at the Battle of Waterberg on 11‚Äì12 August 1904 but were unable to encircle and annihilate the retreating survivors. The pursuing German forces prevented groups of Herero from breaking from the main body of the fleeing force and pushed them further into the desert. As exhausted Herero fell to the ground, unable to go on, German soldiers killed men, women, and children. Jan Cloete, acting as a guide for the Germans, witnessed the atrocities committed by the German troops and deposed the following statement: A portion of the Herero escaped the Germans and went to the Omaheke Desert, hoping to reach British Bechuanaland; fewer than 1,000 Herero managed to reach Bechuanaland, where they were granted asylum by the British authorities.Nils Ole Oermann (1999) Mission, Church and State Relations in South West Africa under German Rule 1884‚Äì1915, p. 97, Franz Steiner Verlag, Stuttgart To prevent them from returning, Trotha ordered the desert to be sealed off.Ulrich van der Heyden; Holger Stoecker (2005) Mission und Macht im Wandel politischer Orientierungen: Europaische Missionsgesellschaften in politischen Spannungsfeldern in Afrika und Asien zwischen 1800‚Äì1945, p. 394, Franz Steiner Verlag, Stuttgart German patrols later found skeletons around holes deep that had been dug in a vain attempt to find water. Some sources also state that the German colonial army systematically poisoned desert water wells.Samuel Totten, William S. Parsons, Israel W.

Regardless, German soldiers regularly raped young Herero women before killing them or letting them die in the desert.Samuel Totten,Paul Robert Bartrop,Steven L. Jacobs (2007) Dictionary of Genocide: M‚ÄìZ, Greenwood After the war, Trotha argued that his orders were necessary, writing in 1909 that \\"If I had made the small water holes accessible to the womenfolk, I would run the risk of an African catastrophe comparable to the Battle of Beresonia.\\" The German general staff was aware of the atrocities that were taking place; its official publication, named Der Kampf, noted that: Alfred von Schlieffen (Chief of the Imperial German General Staff) approved of Trotha's intentions in terms of a \\"racial struggle\\" and the need to \\"wipe out the entire nation or to drive them out of the country\\", but had doubts about his strategy, preferring their surrender.Manus I. Midlarsky (2005) The Killing Trap: Genocide in the Twentieth Century [Hardcover] p. 32, Cambridge University Press Governor Leutwein, later relieved of his duties, complained to Chancellor von B√ºlow about Trotha's actions, seeing the general's orders as intruding upon the civilian colonial jurisdiction and ruining any chance of a political settlement. According to Professor Mahmood Mamdani from Columbia University, opposition to the policy of annihilation was largely the consequence of the fact that colonial officials looked at the Herero people as a potential source of labour, and thus economically important. For instance, Governor Leutwein wrote that: Having no authority over the military, Chancellor B√ºlow could only advise Emperor Wilhelm II that Trotha's actions were \\"contrary to Christian and humanitarian principle, economically devastating and damaging to Germany's international reputation\\". Upon the arrival of new orders at the end of 1904, prisoners were herded into concentration camps, where they were given to private companies as slave labourers or exploited as human guinea pigs in medical experiments.Jeremy Sarkin-Hughes (2008) Colonial Genocide and Reparations Claims in the 21st Century: The Socio-Legal Context of Claims under International Law by the Herero against Germany for Genocide in Namibia, 1904‚Äì1908, p. 142, Praeger Security International, Westport, Conn.

Estimates of the mortality rate at the camps are between 45%Clarence Lusane (2002) Hitler's Black Victims: The Historical Experiences of European Blacks, Africans and African Americans During the Nazi Era (Crosscurrents in African American History), pp. 50‚Äì51, Routledge, New York and 74%. Food in the camps was extremely scarce, consisting of rice with no additions.Aparna Rao (2007) The Practice of War: Production, Reproduction and Communication of Armed violence, Berghahn Books As the prisoners lacked pots and the rice they received was uncooked, it was indigestible; horses and oxen that died in the camp were later distributed to the inmates as food. Dysentery and lung diseases were common. Despite those conditions, the Herero were taken outside the camp every day for labour under harsh treatment by the German guards, while the sick were left without any medical assistance or nursing care. Shootings, hangings, beatings, and other harsh treatment of the forced labourers (including use of sjamboks) were common. A 28 September 1905 article in the South African newspaper Cape Argus detailed some of the abuse with the heading: \\"In German S. W. Africa: Further Startling Allegations: Horrible Cruelty\\". In an interview with Percival Griffith, \\"an accountant of profession, who owing to hard times, took up on transport work at Angra Pequena, L√ºderitz\\", related his experiences. During the war, a number of people from the Cape (in modern-day South Africa) sought employment as transport riders for German troops in Namibia. Upon their return to the Cape, some of these people recounted their stories, including those of the imprisonment and genocide of the Herero and Nama people. Fred Cornell, a British aspirant diamond prospector, was in L√ºderitz when the Shark Island concentration camp was being used. Cornell wrote of the camp: Shark Island was the worst of the German South West African camps.Thomas Pakenham (1991) The Scramble for Africa, 1876‚Äì1912, page 615, Random House, New York L√ºderitz lies in southern Namibia, flanked by desert and ocean. In the harbour lies Shark Island, which then was connected to the mainland only by a small causeway. The island is now, as it was then, barren and characterised by solid rock carved into surreal formations by the hard ocean winds. The camp was placed on the far end of the relatively small island, where the prisoners would have suffered complete exposure to the strong winds that sweep L√ºderitz for most of the year. German Commander Von Estorff wrote in a report that approximately 1700 prisoners (including 1203 Nama) had died by April 1907. In December 1906, four months after their arrival, 291 Nama died (a rate of more than nine people per day). Missionary reports put the death rate at 12‚Äì18 per day; as many as 80% of the prisoners sent to Shark Island eventually died there.News Monitor for September 2001 Prevent Genocide International There are accusations of Herero women being coerced into sex slavery as a means of survival. Head of Shark Island prisoner used for medical experimentation. Trotha was opposed to contact between natives and settlers, believing that the insurrection was \\"the beginning of a racial struggle\\" and fearing that the colonists would be infected by native diseases. Benjamin Madley argues that although Shark Island is referred to as a concentration camp, it functioned as an extermination camp or death camp.Benjamin Madley (2005) \\"From Africa to Auschwitz: How German South West Africa Incubated Ideas and Methods Adopted and Developed by the Nazis in Eastern Europe\\", European History Quarterly Vol. 35, pp. 429‚Äì432: \\"Operational from 1905 to 1907, Haifischinsel, or Shark Island, was the twentieth century's first death camp. Though referred to as a Konzentrationslager in Reichstag debates, it functioned as an extermination centre.\\"Madley, p. 446: \\"Colonial Namibia's death camp at Shark Island was different from Spanish and British concentration camps in that it was operated for the purpose of destroying human life. Thus, it served as a rough model for later Nazi Vernichtungslager, or annihilation camps, like Treblinka and Auschwitz, whose primary purpose was murder.\\"Isabel V.

Traugott Tjienda, headsman of the Herero at Tsumbe and foreman of a large group of prisoners at the Otavi lines for two years, testified years later to a death rate of 28% (148 dead of 528 labourers) in his unit, Union of South Africa, 'Report on the Natives', 101.\\" = Medical experiments and scientific racism = Prisoners were used for medical experiments and their illnesses or their recoveries from them were used for research.Sebastian Conrad, German Colonialism: A Short History, p. 129. Cambridge University Press, 2008 Experiments on live prisoners were performed by Dr. Bofinger, who injected Herero that were suffering from scurvy with various substances including arsenic and opium; afterwards he researched the effects of these substances via autopsy. Experimentation with the dead body parts of the prisoners was rife. Zoologist (1872‚Äì1955) noted taking \\"body parts from fresh native corpses\\" which according to him was a \\"welcome addition\\", and he also noted that he could use prisoners for that purpose.H.

In October 2011, after 3 years of talks, the first 20 of an estimated 300 skulls stored in the museum of the Charit√© were returned to Namibia for burial. In 2014, 14 additional skulls were repatriated by the University of Freiburg. = Number of victims = A census conducted in 1905 revealed that 25,000 Herero remained in German South West Africa.Frank Robert Chalk, Kurt Jonassohn (1990) The History and Sociology of Genocide : Analyses and Case Studies, Montreal Institute for Genocide Studies, Yale University Press 1990 According to the Whitaker Report, the population of 80,000 Herero was reduced to 15,000 \\"starving refugees\\" between 1904 and 1907.UN Whitaker Report on Genocide, 1985, paragraphs 14 to 24, pages 5 to 10 Prevent Genocide International In Colonial Genocide and Reparations Claims in the 21st Century: The Socio-Legal Context of Claims under International Law by the Herero against Germany for Genocide in Namibia by Jeremy Sarkin-Hughes, a number of 100,000 victims is given.

Aftermath  Surviving Herero after the escape through the arid desert of Omaheke, c. 1907 Reiterdenkmal in Windhoek before its relocation in 2009 With the closure of concentration camps, all surviving Herero were distributed as labourers for settlers in the German colony. From that time on, all Herero over the age of seven were forced to wear a metal disc with their labour registration number, and banned from owning land or cattle, a necessity for pastoral society. About 19,000 German troops were engaged in the conflict, of which 3,000 saw combat. The rest were used for upkeep and administration. The German losses were 676 soldiers killed in combat, 76 missing, and 689 dead from disease. The Reiterdenkmal () in Windhoek was erected in 1912 to celebrate the victory and to remember the fallen German soldiers and civilians. Until after Independence, no monument was built to the killed indigenous population. It remains a bone of contention in independent Namibia. The campaign cost Germany 600 million marks. The normal annual subsidy to the colony was 14.5 million marks.Klaus Epstein (1959) \\"Erzberger and the German Colonial Scandals\\", English Historical Review, pp. 637‚Äì63 In 1908, diamonds were discovered in the territory, and this did much to boost its prosperity, though it was short-lived. In 1915, at the start of World War I, the German colony was taken over and occupied in the South West Africa Campaign by the Union of South Africa, acting on behalf of the British Imperial Government. South Africa received a League of Nations Mandate over South West Africa in 1919 under the Treaty of Versailles. = Recognition = In 1985, the United Nations' Whitaker Report classified the massacres as an attempt to exterminate the Herero and Nama peoples of South West Africa, and therefore one of the earliest cases of genocide in the 20th century.Israel W. Charny (1999) Encyclopedia of Genocide, pp. 288‚Äì289, ABC-CLIO, Santa Barbara, CA In 1998, German President Roman Herzog visited Namibia and met Herero leaders. Chief Munjuku Nguvauva demanded a public apology and compensation. Herzog expressed regret but stopped short of an apology. He pointed out that international law requiring reparation did not exist in 1907, but he undertook to take the Herero petition back to the German government.\\"Its Past on Its Sleeve, Tribe Seeks Bonn's Apology\\" (31 May 1998) New York Times, p.3 The Herero filed a lawsuit in the United States in 2001 demanding reparations from the German government and Deutsche Bank, which financed the German government and companies in Southern Africa. With a complaint filed with the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in January 2017, descendants of the Herero and Nama people sued Germany for damages in the United States. The plaintiffs sued under the Alien Tort Statute, a 1789 U.S. law often invoked in human rights cases. Their proposed class-action lawsuit sought unspecified sums for thousands of descendants of the victims, for the \\"incalculable damages\\" that were caused.Jonathan Stempel (January 5, 2017), Germany is sued in U.S. over early-1900s Namibia slaughter Reuters. Germany seeks to rely on its state immunity as implemented in US law as the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, arguing that, as a sovereign nation, it cannot be sued in US courts in relation to its acts outside the United States. On 16 August 2004, at the 100th anniversary of the start of the genocide, a member of the German government, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, Germany's Minister for Economic Development and Cooperation, officially apologised and expressed grief about the genocide, declaring in a speech that: She ruled out paying special compensations, but promised continued economic aid for Namibia which in 2004 amounted to $14M a year. This number has been significantly increased since then, with the budget for the years 2016‚Äì17 allocating a sum total of ‚Ç¨138M in monetary support payments. The Trotha family travelled to Omaruru in October 2007 by invitation of the royal Herero chiefs and publicly apologised for the actions of their relative. Wolf-Thilo von Trotha said, = Repatriation = Peter Katjavivi, a former Namibian ambassador to Germany, demanded in August 2008 that the skulls of Herero and Nama prisoners of the 1904‚Äì1908 uprising, which were taken to Germany for scientific research to claim the superiority of white Europeans over Africans, be returned to Namibia. Katjavivi was reacting to a German television documentary which reported that its investigators had found over 40 of these skulls at two German universities, among them probably the skull of a Nama chief who had died on Shark Island near L√ºderitz.\\"Katjavivi demands Herero skulls from Germany\\", (24 July 2008) The Namibian In September 2011 the skulls were returned to Namibia. In August 2018, Germany returned all of the remaining skulls and other human remains which were examined in Germany to scientifically promote white supremacy. This was the third such transfer, and shortly before it occurred, German Protestant bishop Petra Bosse-Huber stated ‚ÄúToday, we want to do what should have been done many years ago ‚Äì to give back to their descendents the remains of people who became victims of the first genocide of the 20th century.‚Äù As part of the repatriation process, the German government announced on 17 May 2019 that it would return a stone symbol it took from Namibia in the 1900s.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48309694  Germany to return Portuguese Stone Cross to Namibia ‚Äì BBC News = Compensation negotiations = On 11 August 2020, following negotiations over a potential compensation agreement between Germany and Namibia, President Hage Geingob of Namibia stated that the German government's offer was \\"not acceptable\\", while German envoy Ruprecht Polenz said he was \\"still optimistic that a solution can be found.\\" = Media = *A BBC Documentary Namibia ‚Äì Genocide & the second reich explores the Herero/Nama genocide and the circumstances surrounding it. *In the documentary , filmmakers Halfdan Muurholm and Casper Erichsen portray a 23-year-old Herero woman, who is aware of the fact that her great-grandmother was raped by a German soldier.

Drury (2014) We are Proud ..., Bloomsbury Methuen Drama = Link between the Herero genocide and the Holocaust = The Herero genocide has commanded the attention of historians who study complex issues of continuity between the Herero genocide and the Holocaust.David Johnson; Prem Poddar (2008) A Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures ‚Äì Continental Europe and its Empires, p. 240, Edinburgh University Press It is argued that the Herero genocide set a precedent in Imperial Germany that would later be followed by Nazi Germany's establishment of death camps.Andrew Zimmerman (2001) Anthropology and antihumanism in Imperial Germany, p. 244, University of Chicago Press According to Benjamin Madley, the German experience in South West Africa was a crucial precursor to Nazi colonialism and genocide. He argues that personal connections, literature, and public debates served as conduits for communicating colonialist and genocidal ideas and methods from the colony to Germany. Tony Barta, an honorary research associate at La Trobe University, argues that the Herero genocide was an inspiration for Hitler in his war against the Jews, Slavs, Gypsies, and others who he described as \\"non-Aryans\\". According to Clarence Lusane, Eugen Fischer's medical experiments can be seen as a testing ground for medical procedures which were later followed during the Nazi Holocaust. Fischer later became chancellor of the University of Berlin, where he taught medicine to Nazi physicians. Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer was a student of Fischer, Verschuer himself had a prominent pupil, Josef Mengele. Franz Ritter von Epp, who was later responsible for the liquidation of virtually all Bavarian Jews and Roma as governor of Bavaria, took part in the Herero genocide as well.Ben Kiernan (2007) Blood and Soil, a World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur, p. 36, Yale University Press Mahmood Mamdani argues that the links between the Herero genocide and the Holocaust are beyond the execution of an annihilation policy and the establishment of concentration camps and there are also ideological similarities in the conduct of both genocides. Focusing on a written statement by General Trotha which is translated as: Mamdani takes note of the similarity between the aims of the General and the Nazis. According to Mamdani, in both cases there was a Social Darwinist notion of \\"cleansing\\", after which \\"something new\\" would \\"emerge\\".

The district of Fraubrunnen is divided between Emmental and Bern-Mittelland. Geography The region comprises relatively low mountains on the right bank of the Aare. It includes the basins of the Emme and the Ilfis between Burgdorf and the boundary with the canton of Solothurn. Its principal elevation is the Napf, a mountain massif dominating the northwestern part of the Emmental Alps. The landscape is dominated by meadows and pastureland, with forest interspersed. Economy The original Emmental cheese is produced there, and the dairy industry still dominates the local economy. Pottery from the region is also prized, and the ceramics of the region have endured practically unchanged since the 17th century. Tourism has had less impact on the region than on other parts of Switzerland. Culture Emmental farmhouse The novelist Jeremias Gotthelf (1797‚Äì1854) was a pastor in the Emmental and wrote about the region. The Emmental also played a dominant role in the history of the Mennonites. =Architecture= The typical Emmental farmhouse has a steep roof with a large overhang that almost reaches the ground.

Barcel√≥, who in 1917 became the first President of the Senate of Puerto Rico, played an instrumental role in the introduction and passage of legislation which permitted the realization of the School of Tropical Medicine and the construction of a Capitol building in Puerto Rico. Early years Barcel√≥ was born in the City of Fajardo, Puerto Rico, to Jaime Jos√© Barcel√≥ Miralles (son of Antonio and Catalina) and Josefa Mart√≠nez de Le√≥n (b. 1842).BIOGRAF√çA: DON ANTONIO R. BARCEL√ì : PRIMER PRESIDENTE DEL SENADOAncestors of Jaime Jos√© Barcel√≥ Miralles Familias de Fajardo His father Jaime had emigrated from Palma, Majorca, Balearic Islands, Spain to Puerto Rico where he married Josefa (b. Naguabo, Puerto Rico) in Fajardo.La formaci√≥n del pueblo puertorrique√±o: la contribuci√≥n de los catalanes, bale√°ricos y valencianos Estela Cifre de Loubriel Instituto de Cultura Puertorrique√±aAncestors of Jaime Jos√© Barcel√≥ Miralles Familias de Fajardo. He became an orphan by the age of three; his father had died in 1870 and his mother in 1871. He went to live with his aunt, Carmela de Leon, and his grandmother Belen de Leon, both of whom raised him.Puerto Rico Por Encima de Todo: Vida y Obra de Antonio R. Barcel√≥, 1868-1938; by: Dr. Delma S. Arrigoitia; Publisher: Ediciones Puerto (January 2008); As a youngster, Barcel√≥ took an active interest in politics. He studied in the \\"Concillier Seminary\\" of San Juan where he earned a law degree. He joined the \\"Autonomist Party\\" (founded by Jos√© de Diego and Rom√°n Baldorioty de Castro in 1887) and soon became the party's secretary.El Nuevo Dia In 1897, he was appointed as a municipal judge of Fajardo. The United States allowed him to retain the position after its invasion during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. On February 4, 1899, Barcel√≥ married Maria Georgina \\"Josefina\\" Bird Arias, a daughter of the sugar baron Jorge Bird Le√≥n. Political career =Union Party of Puerto Rico= Barcel√≥ left the Autonomist Party and together with Luis Mu√±oz Rivera, Rosendo Matienzo Cintr√≥n, Eduardo Georgetti, Juan Vias Ochoteco, Jos√© de Diego, and others, founded the \\"Union party\\". The party, which believed in Puerto Rican independence, was led by Mu√±oz Rivera as president, with Barcel√≥ as the secretary general. The party won the election in 1904 and Mu√±oz Rivera was selected as a member of the House of Delegates, while Barcel√≥ was elected to the Chamber of Delegates in 1905.Antonio Barcel√≥ In 1910, Barcel√≥ founded the Association of Puerto Rico, with the idea of protecting the main industries of the island, which at that time were coffee, tobacco and sugar, against imported brands. The legislature of Puerto Rico passed law number 52 in 1913, which officially established the Association of Puerto Rico and renamed it the Association of Products made in Puerto Rico. The law also incorporated and protected the official logo of the association, which contains the phrase Hecho en Puerto Rico (Made in Puerto Rico). In 1914, Barcel√≥, Mu√±oz Rivera and de Diego were members of an executive council that tried to form an alliance between the Union and Republican Parties. In 1917, after Luis Mu√±oz Rivera died, Barcel√≥ became the leading force behind the liberal ideas of the island. He looked after Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, Mu√±oz Rivera's son, and continued the publication of La Democracia, the political newspaper founded by Mu√±oz Rivera. From 1917 to 1932, he was elected to the Senate of Puerto Rico, and was named president of the Puerto Rican Senate. Barcel√≥ opposed the Jones-Shafroth Act, which granted United States citizenship to residents of Puerto Rico, because he thought it might interfere with gaining independence. Also, the judicial and executive branches would still be controlled by the United States. The Jones-Shafroth Act was approved by the United States and signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson on March 2, 1917. The Union Party under Barcel√≥'s leadership resolved to adopt a different stance and to seek more autonomy, which he believed would finally lead to independence. This shift prompted de Diego, who was a strong independence advocate, to depart from the party. Antonio R. Barcel√≥ In 1921, President Warren G. Harding appointed Emmet Montgomery Reily, who was a strong supporter of \\"Americanism\\", as Governor of Puerto Rico. During his inauguration address, he insisted that the United States flag (\\"Old Glory\\") should be the only flag used over the island and denounced those who believed in Puerto Rican independence as anti-American and traitors. Additionally, he placed several mainland politicians in prominent positions in the Puerto Rican government. Reily was an extremely unpopular governor, he was the subject of corruption allegations and an investigation by Puerto Rican local officials. Under pressure, Reily resigned as governor in 1923. As Reily had convinced the American public that the independence advocates were enemies of the U.S., Barcel√≥ and his party opted for the creation of El Estado Libre Asociado (a Free Associated State), asking for more autonomy in Puerto Rico instead of independence. He received the support of U.S. Representative Phillip Campbell, who introduced a bill to the United States Congress to such respect. It also included provisions for Puerto Ricans to elect their own governor. The Campbell Bill did not pass Congress, however. This led to the departure of Jos√© Coll y Cuch√≠ from the party and his founding of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. As president of the Senate, Barcel√≥ supported legislation to give Governor Horace Towner and his cabinet, the economic resources to create the School of Tropical Medicine, the Capitol building, the state penitentiary and healthy quarters for workers (said quarters became known as \\"Barrio Obrero\\"). He played an instrumental role in what resulted in the construction of buildings for the University of Puerto Rico and the development of an excellent native faculty. In 1922, presiding Chief Justice of the United States, William Howard Taft made the following statement in regard to the :\\"Balzac v. Porto Rico\\" case: \\"Puerto Rico belongs to the United States, but is not part of the United States. Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory and even though Puerto Ricans have American citizenship, they do not have the same rights as the common American citizen\\".Balzac v. Porto Rico, 258 U.S. 298 (1922) Both Barcel√≥ and Jose Tous Soto, the president of the pro-statehood Republican Party of Puerto Rico, understood by Taft's statement that neither independence nor statehood would be considered for the time being. In 1924, they formed an \\"Alliance\\" between their political parties to concentrate on improving Puerto Rico's economic situation. The party was called Alianza Puertorrique√±a (or Puerto Rican Alliance). All this led to some differences in ideals between Eduardo Georgetti and Barcel√≥. Georgetti believed in the original ideal of the Union Party and that the \\"Alliance\\" coalition would not work because of their ideological differences. Barcel√≥ and a group of party delegates traveled to Washington to seek changes in the Jones Act of 1917, by presenting their views that the economic situation in Puerto Rico was a good one and that Puerto Ricans were capable of electing their own governor. Georgetti traveled to Washington, D.C., in representation of various Puerto Rican organizations, among them the Agriculturist Association and the Association of Sugar Producers. The group which he represented became known by the press as the Fuerzas Vivas (Live Forces). Georgetti and the \\"Fuerzas Vivas\\" presented the Secretary of War a \\"Memorandum\\" which presented the economic situation of the island in the brink of ruins. His actions were viewed by Barcel√≥ and the \\"Alliance\\" as an attempt by Georgetti and the \\"Fuerzas Vivas\\" to discredit him and weaken the \\"Alliance\\". Georgetti denied it and quit the alliance. Barcel√≥ was also a victim of an assassination attempt, but this did not keep him from believing and pursuing his liberal ideas.El Pensador =Liberal Party of Puerto Rico= Differences became apparent between Barcel√≥ and Tous Soto and F√©lix C√≥rdova D√°vila, the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico in Washington, as to the goals of the alliance. Barcel√≥ requested that Herbert Hoover, the newly elected President of the United States, retain Horace Towner temporarily as governor of the island. Hoover, however, consulted C√≥rdova D√°vila, instead of Barcel√≥, in regard to his intentions of naming Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. to the position. C√≥rdova D√°vila in turn notified Tous Soto, instead of Barcel√≥, as to Hoover's decision. Barcel√≥ felt offended that he was not consulted and convinced his followers, in the Unionist sector of the alliance, to disaffiliate themselves from the \\"Alliance.\\" Because of legal reasons Barcel√≥ was unable to use the name \\"Union Party.\\" In 1932, he founded the \\"Puerto Rican Liberal Party.\\" The Liberal Party's political agenda was the same as that of the original Union Party, urging independence as a final political solution for Puerto Rico. Among those who joined him in the \\"new\\" party were Felisa Rinc√≥n de Gautier and Ernesto Ramos Antonini. By 1932, Barcel√≥ had invited Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, son of Luis Mu√±oz Rivera, to join the Liberal Party. During the elections of 1932, the Liberal Party faced the Alliance, by then a coalition of the Republican Party of Puerto Rico and Santiago Iglesias Pantin's Socialist Party. Barcel√≥ and Mu√±oz Mar√≠n were both elected senators of Puerto Rico. Even though the Liberal Party received more votes than the Republican Party and the Socialist Party did individually, it received fewer votes than their candidates as a coalition. Eventually, Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, who had different points of view as to how Puerto Rico should go about obtaining its independence, would collide with Barcel√≥. Barcel√≥ believed that independence should be a gradual process, preceded by autonomous insular government. Following the R√≠o Piedras massacre in 1935, US Senator Millard Tydings in 1936 introduced a bill in Congress for Puerto Rican independence. The Puerto Rican parties supported the bill, but Mu√±oz Mar√≠n opposed it, saying it had unfavorable economic aspects. Tydings did not gain passage of the bill.Frank Otto Gatell, \\"Independence Rejected: Puerto Rico and the Tydings Bill of 1936\\", Hispanic American Historical Review, Vol. 38, No. 1 (Feb., 1958), pp. 25‚Äì44, accessed 15 December 2012 In 1936, a Liberal Party assembly was held in San Juan. Mu√±oz Mar√≠n said he was not interested in being considered for the position of Resident Commissioner and recommended Barcel√≥. This move would leave the presidency of the party open for Mu√±oz Mar√≠n. Barcel√≥ refused to be named commissioner and to relinquish his presidency. Mu√±oz Mar√≠n and his followers founded a group within the party called \\"Accion Social Puertorrique√±o\\" (Puerto Rican Social Action), who believed in gaining the immediate independence of Puerto Rico. After the Liberal Party was defeated in 1936 elections, its leaders held an assembly in Naranjales on May 31, 1937. Mu√±oz Mar√≠n presented his ideas as to how the party should be run. The majority of the party members objected and blamed him for their defeat, as well as criticizing his opposition of the bill for independence. Mu√±oz Mar√≠n considered this action the same as having been expelled from the party. Mu√±oz Mar√≠n and his followers, held an assembly in the town of Arecibo and founded the Partido Liberal, Neto, Aut√©ntico y Completo (\\"Clear, Authentic and Complete Liberal Party\\"), claiming to be the true Liberal Party. The Partido Liberal, Neto, Aut√©ntico y Completo, an independence political party, later became the Popular Democratic Party (PPD). It promoted the political status of an Estado Libre Associado (Free Associated State) status which Barcel√≥, as president of the Union Party, had asked for in 1923. Mu√±oz Mar√≠n had formerly opposed this. Later years Antonio R. Barcel√≥ died in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on October 15, 1938, and was interred in Santa Maria Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery in Old San Juan.Find a Grave He was survived by his wife, Josefina Bird (1880‚Äì1940) and three children (his son Jaime died in 1928), Antonio, Jr., Maria Antonia Josefina and Maria Angelica (1912‚Äì2004). With his passing, his daughter Maria Antonia Josefina, was elected president of the Liberal Party, thus becoming the first woman to preside a political party in Puerto Rico. The party ceased to exist in 1948. Antonio Rafael Anastacio Barcel√≥ Ironically, his grandson Carlos Romero Barcel√≥ (Maria Antonia Josefina's son) on January 2, 1977, was sworn in as Governor of Puerto Rico with a pro- statehood agenda, a political status which Antonio R. Barcel√≥ had opposed, as member of the Partido Nuevo Progresista de Puerto Rico (New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico).Congress Legacy The School of Tropical Medicine Barcel√≥ was responsible for the approval of many laws which led to reforms and that would greatly benefit the social justice, labor and the Puerto Rican economy. Barcel√≥ helped to establish the minimum wage rate, workers' compensation and limited working hours. Barcel√≥, also played a principal role in the establishment of \\"The School of Tropical Medicine\\", \\"The Federal Penitentiary\\", \\"The Antituberculosis Sanctuary\\" and numerous other centers. He introduced the proper legislation which permitted the construction of the Puerto Rico State Capitol. During his tenure as president of the Puerto Rico Senate. In 1928, Columbia University of New York, honored Barcel√≥ by bestowing upon him an Honorary Doctorate of Law. His memory has been honored by Puerto Rico by naming public buildings and schools after him, including the Antonio R. Barcel√≥ Legislative Building which previously housed the School of Tropical Medicine and the Department of Natural Resources. His philosophy remains relevant nearly a century later, as evidenced by references to it in contemporary political and journalistic commentary.http://www.elnuevodia.com/columna/678382/ Further reading *Puerto Rico Por Encima de Todo: Vida y Obra de Antonio R.

Correlating with the NT (intuitive‚Äìthinking) Myers-Briggs types, the Rational temperament comprises the following role variants (listed with their correlated Myers-Briggs types): Architect (INTP), Fieldmarshal (ENTJ), Inventor (ENTP), and Mastermind (INTJ).Keirsey.com Portrait of the Rational. This temperament makes up only 5 to 10 percent of the general population, making this the smallest temperament group. Description Rationals are abstract in speech and utilitarian in pursuing their goals. Their greatest strength is strategy. Their most developed intelligence role is that of either Engineers (Architects and Inventors) or Coordinator (Masterminds and Fieldmarshals). As the knowledge-seeking temperament, Rationals trust reason implicitly. They rely on objective observations and factual analysis in any given situation. They seek a logical argument as a basis for action. As strategists, Rationals strive to gain as much information as possible, applying what they learn to develop long-term plans and the steps for achieving them. They are characterized by a tough-minded personal style, tending to pursue either power or understanding. They are often strong-willed, ambitious, intelligent, and self-determined. Subjective thoughts and emotion have no place in the decision-making process of Rationals. Driven to excel, they work hard to achieve their goals, and they do well where they can take control or work independently on a task. Interests Rationals are drawn to science and technology. They usually seek careers involving systems--whether civil, mechanical, or electrical engineering, mathematical, organic (biology), social (psychology and sociology), or organizational (business and economics). Orientation Rationals are pragmatic about the world around them, having little use for social conventions or sentiment except as a means to an end. They weigh logical outcomes before acting, looking for errors in reasoning--in themselves and others. Some believe that ethical concepts like good and evil are relative, depending on particular points of view. They regard time as the duration of events rather than as a continuum. They view places as the intersection of two crossing lines (as in Cartesian coordinates, for example). Self-image Rationals' self-esteem is rooted in their ingenuity; their self-respect in their autonomy; and their self-confidence in their resoluteness. Values Rationals appear calm even in times of turmoil. They achieve this state through an intense concentration of effort rather than through emotional detachment. They trust reason and strive for achievement. They are knowledge-seekers who aspire to technical superiority, and so are pleased when others defer to their expertise. Social roles In romantic relationships, Rationals want a mindmate with whom they can discuss the topics that interest them, which are often abstract or theoretical, such as philosophy. As parents, they encourage their children to become self-reliant individuals capable of critical thinking. In their professional and social lives, Rationals are visionary leaders, developing and consolidating coherent long-term plans. =Stress= When under stress, Rationals may intellectualize or repress their feelings. The informative Rationals (Architects and Inventors) prefer theorizing, designing, and prototyping their ideas, which may cause them to feel overburdened when called upon to finalize their ideas into practical operation by themselves. This can result in feelings of inadequacy, which can lead to poor or no execution. The directive Rationals (Masterminds and Fieldmarshals) experience stress when their long-range vision is resisted or derailed. They may respond by collecting more and more minute data or by becoming increasingly authoritarian, unaware of how their demands are perceived by others. When confronted with negative consequences in their endeavors, Rationals may experience feelings of incompetence, especially if they are not emotionally intelligent. They are frustrated by inefficiency and the perceived illogical tendencies of others. =Traits in common with other temperaments= Keirsey identified the following traits of the Rational temperament: * Abstract in communicating (like Idealists) Rationals use concepts, possibilities, theories, and identified patterns as a means for communication. Although Rationals are realistic, the abstract world serves as a tool for thinking independently and developing new ideas that can be used in more practical matters. * Pragmatic in pursuing their goals (like Artisans) Rationals are unconventional thinkers when deciding on a task or solving a problem. Individualistic by nature, Rationals observe their own interests as a response to action, free from societal conformity or traditional thinking. Rationals are not necessarily uncooperative, but they will refuse to perform a certain action if it goes against their understanding or experience and is not based on sound logic or the facts in a given context. Variants According to Keirsey: * Masterminds are introspective, logical, rational, pragmatic, clear-headed, directive, and attentive. As strategists, they are better than any other type at brainstorming approaches to situations. Masterminds are capable but not eager leaders, stepping forward only when it becomes obvious to them that they are the best for the job. Strong-willed and very self- assured, they may make this decision quickly, as they tend to make all decisions. But though they are decisive, they are open to new evidence and new ideas, flexible in their planning to accommodate changing situations. They tend to excel at judging the usefulness of ideas and will apply whatever seems most efficient to them in accomplishing their clearly envisioned goals. To Masterminds, what matters is getting it done--but also learning the principles of how to get it done efficiently and well; that is, at a professional level of quality. However, they may not give much thought to the social cost of getting there, \\"focusing so tightly on their own pursuits [that] they can ignore the points of view and wishes of others.\\" * Inventors are often nonconformists and can have a circle of friends who are interested in their ideas or activities. Inventors are generally laid back, nonjudgmental, and good conversationalists. They are often able to explain their own complicated ideas, as well as comprehend the complex ideas of others. In arguments they may use debating skills, often to the significant disadvantage of their opponent.\\"The Portrait of the Inventor (ENTP),\\" Keirsey Temperament Website, Accessed May 15, 2018. This strategy can backfire, however, by alienating those seeking a cooperative relationship rather than a combative one--a typical source of conflict between Rationals and Idealists, for example. Inventors are generally ingenious individuals capable of rising to meet the demands of challenging situations. In work, they are usually good leaders of pilot products that test their abilities. Inventors are constantly looking for new ways to do things and usually have the social skills and drive to implement their ideas. According to David Mark Keirsey (the son of Dr David West Keirsey), Inventors are often perceived as the most outwardly arrogant of all types.\\"Me!?

Based in part on Love's own life, the manga follows an amnesiac alien character, Ai, who is transported to Tokyo from her war-torn homeland, where she attempts to piece her life together. Co-written by Love and Levy, the manga was initially featured in Japan in Shinshokan's Wings magazine, and later published in English by Tokyopop in three volumes between 2004 and 2006. A sequel, Princess Ai: The Prism of Midnight Dawn, was later published in two volumes in 2008 and 2010, respectively, and was written by Christine Boylan and Levy. Tokyopop re-released the original Princess Ai series in one volume, Princess Ai: The Ultimate Edition on October 9, 2007. Additionally, comic strips, art books, coloring books, fan books, and action figures based on the series and its characters have been released. Premise A young, amnesiac alien girl known only as Princess Ai is mysteriously transported to Tokyo, Japan from her war-torn home, Ai-Land, which is in the midst of a revolution. With only a heart-shaped box to clue her in on her past, Ai makes her living as a rock star at Club Cupid. She falls in love with a sensitive musician, Kent, much to the distaste of Kent's gay, possessive roommate, Hikaru. But Hikaru is the least of Ai's worries when gun-toting talent agents and demons seeking to take control of Ai's homeland, Ai-Land, are hot on her trail. Characters =Main characters= *Ai - Princess Ai is the main character of the story. She is the product of a relationship between her human father, King Sei, and a Dougen (Angel) female. Because of the war that rages between the Humans and the Dougen in Ai-Land, Ai's true parentage was kept a secret, even from Ai herself. Due to her mixed heritage, Ai sprouted wings on her back, tinged with red, and has the ability to control people's emotions with her singing. Also, Ai loves Nora and Kent, and she is torn between the two. **She is fiercely independent. She first learns she had wings in chapter 5. **She likes to wear torn clothes; if not, she cuts them. She eventually stops doing it once she got into H.T.A. **Her heart-shaped box she always kept with her is made of pure tenketsu, the blood of angels, the primary source of energy throughout Ai-Land. If humans touch it, they inevitable lead to death. If Dougen touch it, they eventually get a narcotic reaction. **She remembers in chapter 12 that Queen Lilith isn't her real mother but she still has the royal birthmark of a red rose on her right thigh. **Her real powers came out in chapter 15, a power even greater than tenketsu ‚Äî the power to create light. *Kent - Kent is a young man who works at the Shinjuku University library part- time. Kent was one of the first people to discover Ai after she appeared in Tokyo, and offered her a place to stay, an action which caused a lot of friction with his roommate Hikaru. Like Ai, he is of a mixed heritage, being half Japanese and half American, and uses this fact to help Ai come to grips with her dual heritage (chapter 11). **If it wasn't for Ai's pendant inside her heart-shaped box, Kent would have died protecting Ai from one of Meggi's tenketsu arrows. =Human characters= *Fa'an - He is a street musician with strangely compelling lyrics who helps Ai discover her flair for singing. He has a knack for appearing and disappearing at just the right time. He watches out for Ai, and is associated with the fallen (Princess Ai : Prism of Midnight Dawn). He is a mysterious person who knows of Ai's past. He even gave the key which unlocks Ai's heart-shaped box. **It was revealed in chapter 14 that Fa'an is a watcher, kind of like a guardian angel. He has the power to turn into a vulture. *Daisuke - He is Kent's coworker at the Shinjuku University library. Evey time Ai came to the library, he tried asking her out, which always ended up being interrupted by Kent. *Hikaru - He is Kent's gay roommate. Hikaru has a huge crush on Kent and a hatred for Ai, fueled by jealousy. Later on in the series, he makes peace with Ai and becomes one of her biggest supporters (volume 3, chapter 11). *Takeshi - Tough, tattooed, and tawdry, he is a VIP at the nightclub Club Cupid who just happens to work for H.T.A., the hottest talent agency (fictional) in Japan. He was ordered by Hayabusa to eliminate Ai during her worldwide stadium tour but his emotions got in the way (chapter 14). *Hayabusa - Takeshi's boss, the powerful president of H.T.A. (Hayabusa Talent Agency), who is allegedly connected with the Yakuza (the Japanese mob). He has major plans for Ai's debut - evil plans. After the destructive event in chapter 10, Hayabusa told Takeshi to have Ai record more songs, go on a stadium tour, and eliminate her on worldwide television. Then she will become a legend. All her unreleased content, music videos, remixes, will be under H.T.A. control and the money will be rolling in for a very long time. He was arrested in chapter 15 for what was about to happen to Ai and various other crimes. *Yoshi - Ai's personal assistant seen in volume 2. He is sometimes mistaken for a very tall woman. *Hiro - Ai's manager at H.T.A. He is ordered by Hayabusa to keep Ai under control. He tries to kill Ai during a blackout in chapter 15 but her true powers came to light. He got arrested for shooting the gun at Ai. *Lissa - She is Ai's tutor back in Ai-Land. She was Ai's best friend but Ai kept her wings a secret from her. From a flashback in chapter 12, Lissa told Ai that Queen Lilith wasn't her real mother. *Club Cupid **Shinji - The manager of Club Cupid. He lets Ai sing at Club Cupid. **Mika - A rude woman at Club Cupid, who calls Ai trashy. She wants Takeshi to notice her own talent and get into H.T.A. instead of Ai's. **Jen - The one singer at Club Cupid who takes the time to befriend Ai. Later on in the story, Jen dies getting Ai's heart-shaped box back from a robber. =The Dougen= The Dougen are non-human creatures which live in Ai-Land. The most royal of them are angels. * Angels **Nora - A leader of the revolutionaries in Ai-Land, this Angel wants equality‚Äînot superiority‚Äîover humans, but not everyone shares his views. He got really close to Ai and sent her to Earth for her safety. He didn't know that Ai was one of them but knew that Ai is someone who will change the world. **Kaz - Nora's radical cousin who believes that the human royal family must be conquered at all costs. Much to Nora's dismay, Kaz dispatched Tess to capture Ai. But later on, he discovers the truth about Ai and understands Nora's point (chapter 15). **Kemo - He is only seen in Princess Ai: The Prism of Midnight Dawn. He is one of the angels who helped with the second revolution, and is in league with Kaz. However, he now harbours a personal revenge against Ai, and is on the brink of insanity. * Furies **Tess - One of the 3 Furies of Ai-Land, she was sent to search out and drag Ai back to her planet. After a radical change of heart, she becomes Ai's protector (chapter 10). She understands that Ai is the key for peace in Ai-Land and Nora's plan is the right one. She has a dragon on each of her red wings which spews out fire. They are weak to liquid. **Meggi - The second Furie sister to be sent out to fetch Ai in chapter 11. She is Tess's younger sister. She is devoted to Kaz and is weak to flowers. She uses jealousy and vengeance to manipulate her enemies. She has snakes on each of her wings. **Alexa - She is third Furie Sisters to be sent out in chapter 13. She is Tess's and Meggi's sister, and Kaz's last hope to return Ai to Ai-Land. She has the power to freeze time. It is suspected that she has a crush on Takeshi. Background Princess Ai is a loose adaptation of Courtney Love's life story, with Ai functioning as Love's fantasy alter ego. In a 2003 interview concerning the series, Love stated: \\"I have always loved the Japanese culture and people. Princess Ai is a great character, because she feels like my alter ego, but in a fantasy setting.\\" The word \\"Ai\\" means \\"love\\" in Japanese. It is also generally believed that Kent, the sensitive, blonde guitar player who becomes Ai's love interest, is based on Courtney Love's late husband, Kurt Cobain. Co-created and co-written by Love and D.J. Milky, the initial run of Princess Ai was written and illustrated by Misaho Kujiradou and featured character designs by Ai Yazawa. According to Nielsen BookScan sales reports, Princess Ai topped the Adult Fiction Overall Trade Paper Graphic Novels list for the week ending July 25, 2004.

Several of his books won awards and other recognitions in Mexico and abroad.  Life  Elizondo was the fourth of six children of Aurora Elizondo of Huinal√° and Guadalupe Elizondo of Monterrey proper. Elizondo's father was a worker and union leader at the Fundidora de Fierro y Acero de Monterrey. His mother had served as an arbiter in water disputes in her town. Elizondo's interest in words and stories both fiction and non-fiction began when he was a child. His great grandparents on his mother's side told him many stories of the area, including battles against the indigenous of the area that were still ongoing at the end of the 19th century. This experience formed the basis of his literary development. He began writing stories in his free time since the sixth grade, when he decided he wanted to be a writer. He also began a project of the vocabulary and speech of his region's Spanish, which would eventually become the book Lexicon del Noreste. Another major influence on his writing was the death of his sister, who was run over by a car when she was seven. The loss shook the family, especially Elizondo, making him more sensible to death, according to his brother Carlos. Although he knew he wanted to be a writer, his family was practical. He attended the Colegio Civil and then went on to study public accounting at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Studies, graduating in 1975. He did study humanities for a time at UNAM, but he did not finish this degree. Later in life, he would earn a masters in humanities from Universidad de Monterrey and a doctorate in history from the Iberoamericana University. Elizondo retired from his administrative career, but wrote until his death of cancer, which he battled unsuccessfully for two years.  Career  Elizondo wrote novels, short stories, plays, works on history and biographies. He first started published short stories about Huinal√° and other communities in newspapers when he was seventeen. In the mid-1970s, he was working as an accountant with the Bank of Mexico, when he met writer Juan Jos√© Arreola at a caf√© in Mexico City. He presented some of his short stories to the writer, who had a reputation for supporting young talent, who pronounced Elizondo's work ‚Äúpure silver.‚Äù Elizondo wrote for the El Norte and El Porvenir newspapers, wrote biographies of Jos√© Vasconcelos and Mart√≠n Luis Guzm√°n along with histories of businesses and institutions. Elizondo also had an administrative and academic career which spanned over three decades. In 1975, he became the director of the General Archives of the State of Nuevo Le√≥n, continuing until 1979. In 1980 he became the director of Monterrey Tech's special collections, called the Cervantine Library. His career with the institution as head librarian and professor spanned 32 years. He retired from this position two years before his death because of his health. Elizondo was a member of the Academia Mexicana de la Lengua, as well as a member of the Mexican committee of the Memory of the World Programme (UNESCO).  Writing style  Elizondo's style was costumbrista, chronicling life and change in the towns and cities of his border region. He was one of five authors in the 1980s particularly noted for writing about desert life in northern Mexico, which was named ‚Äúnarrativo del desierto‚Äù (desert narrative), along with Daniel Sada of Baja California, Gerardo Cornejo of Sonora, Jesus Gardea of Chihuahua and Serverino Salazar of Zacatecas. His first book was a collection of short stories, Relatos de Mar, Desierto y Muerte (Stories of the Sea, Desert and Death), published in 1980. Several of his works won prizes and other recognitions. Ocurrencias de Don Quijote (1992) received five international awards. Relatos de mar, desierto y muerte received the Premio Nacional de Cuento in 1980. Setenta veces siete won the Premio Colima from the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes in 1987. Books such as Narcedalia Piedrotas (1993) and Setenta veces siete (1987) can be found on college syllabi. He had a passion for photography, which he inherited from his father. In addition to taking photographs, he had a large collection of them from the 19th century. His photographic work made its way into books such as Monterrey, una vision fotogr√°fica, Regiomontanos 1900 and Polvo de aquellos lodos. In 1999, he wrote a commemorative edition on the Palace of Lecumberri on its 100th anniversary (Lecumberri, √°ngel y escorpi√≥n: galer√≠a fotogr√°fica del ultimo d√≠a) which documented the conversion of the building from prison to the General Archives of the Nation.

The character was created by television producer William Dozier, editor Julius Schwartz, writer Gardner Fox and artist Carmine Infantino. Dozier, the producer of the 1960s Batman television series, requested Schwartz to call for a new female counterpart to the superhero Batman that could be introduced into publication and the third season of the show simultaneously. The character subsequently made her first comic book appearance as Batgirl in Detective Comics #359, titled \\"The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl!\\" (January 1967), by Fox and Infantino, allowing her to be introduced into the television series, portrayed by actress Yvonne Craig, in the season 3 premiere \\"Enter Batgirl, Exit Penguin\\", in September that same year. Barbara Gordon is the daughter of Gotham City police commissioner James Gordon, the sister of James Gordon Jr., and is initially employed as head of the Gotham City Public Library. Although the character appeared in various DC Comics publications, she was prominently featured in Batman Family which debuted in 1975, partnered with the original Robin, Dick Grayson. In 1988, following the editorial retirement of the character's Batgirl persona in Batgirl Special #1, the graphic novel Batman: The Killing Joke depicts the Joker shooting her through the spinal cord in her civilian identity, resulting in paraplegia. In subsequent stories, the character was reestablished as a technical advisor, computer expert and information broker known as Oracle. Providing intelligence and computer hacking services to assist other superheroes, she makes her first appearance as Oracle in Suicide Squad #23 (1989) and later became a featured lead of the Birds of Prey series. Reverting the character to her Batgirl persona, DC Comics relaunched its comic book titles in 2011 during The New 52 event, featuring her in the eponymous Batgirl monthly title as well as Birds of Prey. These changes were retained for the second company wide relaunch in 2016 known as DC Rebirth. The character was a popular comic book figure during the Silver Age of Comic Books, due to her appearances in the Batman television series and continued media exposure. She has achieved similar popularity in the Modern Age of Comic Books under the Birds of Prey publication and as a disabled icon. The character has been the subject of academic analysis concerning the roles of women, librarians and disabled people in mainstream media. The events of The Killing Joke, which led to the character's paralysis, as well as the restoration of her mobility, has also been a subject of debate among comic book writers, artists, editors and readership. Viewpoints range from sexism in comic books, to the limited visibility of disabled characters and the practicality of disabilities existing in a fictional universe where magic, technology, and medical science exceed the limitations of the real world. As both Batgirl and Oracle, Barbara Gordon has been featured in various adaptations related to the Batman franchise, including television, film, animation, video games, and other merchandise. Aside from Craig, the character has been portrayed by Dina Meyer and Jet√© Laurence, and has been voiced by Melissa Gilbert, Tara Strong, Mary Kay Bergman, Danielle Judovits, Alyson Stoner, Mae Whitman, Kimberly Brooks, Ashley Greene and Rosario Dawson, among others. In 2011, she was ranked 17th in IGN's \\"Top 100 Comic Book Heroes\\". Barbara Gordon will appear in the third season of the DC Universe and HBO Max series Titans as the new commissioner of Gotham City. Publication history =Detective Comics, Batman Family and other appearances (1967‚Äì1988)= Cover of Detective Comics #359, \\"The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl\\" (Jan. 1967), art by Carmine Infantino and Murphy Anderson Prior to the introduction of Barbara Gordon, the Batwoman character and her sidekick Bat-Girl appeared in Batman-related publications, but were eventually removed at the direction of editor Julius Schwartz for being outdated and unrealistic. Schwartz stated that he had been asked to develop a new female character in order to attract a female viewership to the Batman television series of the 1960s. Executive producer William Dozier suggested that the new character would be the daughter of Gotham City's Police Commissioner James Gordon, and that she would adopt the identity of Batgirl. When Dozier and producer Howie Horowitz saw rough concept artwork of the new Batgirl by artist Carmine Infantino during a visit to DC offices, they optioned the character in a bid to help sell a third season to the ABC television network. Infantino reflected on the creation of Batgirl, stating \\"Bob Kane had had a Bat-Girl for about three stories in the '50s but she had nothing to do with a bat. She was like a pesky girl version of Robin. I knew we could do a lot better, so Julie and I came up with the real Batgirl, who was so popular she almost got her own TV show.\\" Yvonne Craig portrayed the character in the show's third season. Barbara Gordon and her alter ego Batgirl debuted in Detective Comics #359 (Jan. 1967), \\"The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl\\", as the daughter of Gotham City's Police Commissioner James Gordon. In the debut story, while driving to a costume ball dressed as a female version of Batman, sporting a black bodysuit with yellow gloves, boots, utility belt and a bat-symbol along with a blue cape and cowl (similar to Batman's), Barbara Gordon intervenes in a kidnapping attempt on Bruce Wayne by the super villain Killer Moth, attracting Batman's attention and leading to a crime-fighting career. Although Batman insists she give up crime-fighting because of her gender, Batgirl disregards his objections. In her civilian identity, Barbara Gordon, Ph.D., is depicted as a career woman with a doctorate in library science, as well as being head of the Gotham City Public Library, \\"presumably one of the largest public libraries in the DC Comics version of reality.\\" She was given a regular backup slot in Detective Comics starting with issue #384 (February 1969), alternating issues with Robin until issue #404, after which she had the backup slot to herself. Frank Robbins wrote nearly all of these backups, which were penciled first by Gil Kane and later by Don Heck. Barbara Gordon's Batgirl exceeded the earlier Bat-Girl and Batwoman characters in popularity, and readers requested for her to appear in other titles. Although some readers requested that Batwoman also continue to appear in publication, DC responded to the fan-based acclaim and criticism of the new character in an open letter in Detective Comics #417 (1971), stating: \\"I'd like to say a few words about the reaction some readers have to Batgirl. These are readers who remember Batwoman and the other Bat-girls from years back ...They were there because romance seemed to be needed in Batman's life. But thanks to the big change and a foresighted editor, these hapless females are gone for good. In their place stands a girl who is a capable crime- fighter, a far cry from Batwoman who constantly had to be rescued [by] Batman.\\" Batgirl continues to appear in DC Comics publications throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, as a supporting character in Detective Comics, in addition to guest appearances in various titles such as Justice League of America, World's Finest Comics, The Brave and the Bold, Action Comics, and Superman. In the mid-1970s, Batgirl reveals her secret identity to her father (who had already discovered it on his own) and serves as a member of the United States House of Representatives. She moves to Washington, D.C., intending to give up her career as Batgirl and in June 1972, appeared in a story entitled \\"Batgirl's Last Case.\\" Julius Schwartz brought her back a year later in Superman #268 (1973), in which she has a blind date with Clark Kent, establishing their friendship, and fights alongside Superman. Batgirl and Superman later team up twice more in Superman #279 and DC Comics Presents #19. Batgirl also guest-starred in other Superman-related titles such as Adventure Comics, and in Superman Family #171, where she teams up with Supergirl. The character is given a starring role in DC's Batman Family comic book which debuted in 1975. The original Robin Dick Grayson became her partner in the series and the two were frequently referred to as the \\"Dynamite Duo: Batgirl & Robin.\\" Batgirl meets Batwoman in Batman Family #10, when the retired superhero briefly returns to crime-fighting (before Kane is murdered by the Bronze Tiger). The two fight Killer Moth and the Cavalier, and learn each other's secret identities. Batwoman retires once again at the conclusion of the story, leaving Batgirl to continue crime-fighting. Although this series ended after three years of publication, Batgirl continued to appear in back-up stories published in Detective Comics through issue #519 (October 1982). Crisis on Infinite Earths, a limited miniseries published in 1985, was written in order to reduce the complex history of DC Comics to a single continuity. Although Batgirl is a featured character, her role is relatively small‚Äîshe delivers Supergirl's eulogy in issue #7 of the 12-part series. The conclusion of Crisis on Infinite Earths changed DC Universe continuity in many ways. Following the reboot, Barbara Gordon is born to Roger and Thelma Gordon, and she is Jim Gordon's niece/adopted daughter in current canon. Post-Crisis, Supergirl does not arrive on Earth until after Gordon has established herself as Oracle; many adventures she shared with Batgirl are retroactively described as having been experienced by Power Girl. In Secret Origins #20 featuring Batgirl and the Golden Age Dr. Mid-Nite (1987), Barbara Gordon's origin is rebooted by author Barbara Randall. Within the storyline, Gordon recounts the series of events that led to her career as Batgirl, including her first encounter with Batman as a child, studying martial arts under the tutelage of a sensei, memorizing maps and blue prints of the city, excelling in academics in order to skip grades, and pushing herself to become a star athlete. =Batgirl Special #1 and Batman: The Killing Joke (1988)= The Joker shoots Barbara Gordon in Batman: The Killing Joke. The injury results in the character's paralysis. DC officially retired the hero in the one-shot comic Batgirl Special #1 (July 1988), written by Barbara Kesel. Later that year, Barbara Gordon appeared in Alan Moore's Batman: The Killing Joke. In this graphic novel, the Joker shoots and paralyzes Barbara in an attempt to drive her father insane, thereby proving to Batman that anyone can be morally compromised. Although events in The Killing Joke exert a great impact on the character, the story has little to do with her. In 2006, during an interview with Wizard, Moore expressed regret over his treatment of the character calling it \\"shallow and ill-conceived.\\" He stated prior to writing the graphic novel, \\"I asked DC if they had any problem with me crippling Barbara Gordon‚Äîwho was Batgirl at the time‚Äîand if I remember, I spoke to Len Wein, who was our editor on the project\\", and following a discussion with then-Executive Editorial Director Dick Giordano, \\"Len got back onto the phone and said, 'Yeah, okay, cripple the bitch.'\\" Although there has been speculation as to whether or not editors at DC specifically intended to have the character's paralysis become permanent, Brian Cronin, author of Was Superman A Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed (2009) noted that DC had hired Barbara Kesel to write the Batgirl Special specifically to retire the character and set her in place for The Killing Joke. Following the release of the graphic novel, comic book editor and writer Kim Yale discussed how distasteful she found the treatment of Barbara Gordon with her husband, fellow comic writer John Ostrander. Rather than allow the character to fall into obscurity, the two decided to revive her as a character living with a disability. Gail Simone would include the character's paralysis in a list of \\"major female characters that had been killed, mutilated, and depowered\\", dubbing the phenomenon \\"Women in Refrigerators\\" in reference to a 1994 Green Lantern story where the title character discovers his girlfriend's mutilated body in his refrigerator. =Suicide Squad, Birds of Prey and other appearances (1989‚Äì2011)= Barbara Gordon as Oracle in Oracle: The Cure #1 (May 2009), art by Guillem March Yale and Ostrander oversaw the development of Barbara Gordon's new persona as Oracle for the next several years. The character made her first comic book appearance as Oracle in Suicide Squad #23, anonymously offering her services to the government's Task Force X.Manning, Matthew K. \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 239: \\"Barbara [Gordon] set herself as an information guru...Called Oracle, Barbara was recruited by the Suicide Squad in the pages of issue #23 of the Squad's comic, written by John Ostrander and Kim Yale, and pencilled by Luke McDonnell. In the following two years, Oracle, under pen of Ostrander and Yale, made guest appearances in various DC titles until her identity was revealed to be Barbara Gordon in Suicide Squad #38 (1990) and she officially becomes a member of the Squad in issue #48 following an invitation from Amanda Waller. In 1992, Dennis O'Neil wrote Oracle as Batman's sole source of information in Batman: Sword of Azrael #1. This newly forged partnership established Oracle's status as Batman's intellectual equal. She is subsequently featured in the 12-issue miniseries The Hacker Files (1993). In \\"Oracle: Year One\\"‚Äîa story arc contained in The Batman Chronicles #5 (1996)‚ÄîYale and Ostrander tell the origin of Barbara Gordon's new persona as Oracle. Initially, Gordon's paralysis plunges her into a state of reactive depression. However, she soon realizes that her aptitude for and training in information sciences have provided her with tremendous skills that could be deployed to fight crime. In a world increasingly centered on technology and information, she possesses a genius-level intellect; photographic memory; deep knowledge of computers and electronics; expert skills as a hacker; and graduate training in library sciences. One night, she has a dream in which an all-knowing woman (similar to the Oracle at Delphi of Greek mythology) has her own face; it is then that she adopts \\"Oracle\\" as her codename. She serves as an information broker, gathering and disseminating intelligence to law enforcement organizations and members of the superhero community. She trains under the tutelage of Richard Dragon, one of DC's premiere martial artists, to engage in combat (using eskrima) from her wheelchair. She develops her upper- body strength and targeting skills with both firearms and batarangs. The success of Chuck Dixon's Black Canary/Oracle: Birds of Prey (1996) led to the comic series Birds of Prey starring the two title characters. During Chuck Dixon's crossover series Nightwing: Hunt for Oracle, Barbara Gordon and Dinah Lance meet in person and establish a long-term friendship. They form the nucleus of the Birds of Prey organization. While Oracle serves as the basic head of operations, Black Canary becomes her full-time employee and field agent. In 2000, the first Batgirl monthly comic was launched with Cassandra Cain as the title character. Oracle appears as a supporting character throughout the series, acting as a mentor to the new Batgirl, alongside Batman. Gail Simone took over as writer of Birds of Prey with issue #56. In an interview, Simone explained her fondness for Barbara Gordon, stating: \\"Kim Yale and John Ostrander picked up the character and made her into a brilliant master computer operator and one of the most fascinating characters in comics. From there, Chuck Dixon did wonderful things with her in his Birds of Prey run ... She's fantastic because even just sitting in a chair in a dark room by herself, she's tremendously compelling. The DCU without her would be a much less interesting place.\\" Simone integrates the Huntress into the comic, making her a central character in the series as Oracle's secondary field agent. In 2003, comic book authors Scott Beatty and Chuck Dixon revised Barbara Gordon's origin with the miniseries Batgirl: Year One. Gordon is a highly gifted child having graduated from high school early, but initially desires to join law enforcement as opposed to vigilantism in the previous origin myths. Brainiac virus, art by Adriana Melo During the 2004 crossover event Batman: War Games, Black Mask commandeers Oracle's computers and satellites and engages in a fight to the death with Batman. In order to prevent Batman from killing his adversary, Oracle initiates the Clock Tower's self-destruct sequence, provoking Batman to rescue her rather than continue the battle. This results in the destruction of Gordon's home and headquarters in the clock tower. Subsequently, Oracle decides to move on, and leaves Gotham City altogether. She cuts her ties with Batman, and after a temporary world trip with her team, relocates to Metropolis. In the events comprising Gail Simone's Birds of Prey: Between Dark and Dawn (2005), and Birds of Prey: The Battle Within (2005), Oracle is possessed by arch-villain Brainiac, an artificial intelligence entity, in order to become a biological being. Although Oracle overpowers Brainiac and expels him from her body, the advanced virus delivered by him remains despite his absence. The virus steadily causes cybernetic attachments to sprout all over her body. Oracle develops supernatural abilities that allow her to psychically interact with computer information systems. Although she loses these abilities after the virus is rendered dormant following an operation by Doctor Mid-Nite, she discovers she can move her toes. However, this proves to be short-lived; Gordon remains paralyzed. During the company- wide crossover Infinite Crisis (2005), Oracle teams with the Martian Manhunter in Metropolis to coordinate a counterstrike against the Secret Society's global jailbreak. The renewed romance between Barbara Gordon and Dick Grayson is also cut short by the Infinite Crisis storyline. When DC continuity jumps forward one year after the events of Infinite Crisis, Oracle and her team continue to work in Metropolis. Oracle works with Batman, although not on a regular basis as before. Oracle continues to lead the Birds of Prey, and expands the ranks of the operation. In Birds of Prey #99, Black Canary leaves the team and the Huntress becomes the team's de facto field leader, while Big Barda is brought in as the group's heavy-hitter alongside a larger, rotating roster. Oracle also makes an attempt to reforge her alliance with Power Girl. However, when Oracle invites her to rejoin the team, she replies that she will do so \\"when Hell freezes over.\\" In the crossover event Countdown to Final Crisis (2007), Oracle dispatches the Question and Batwoman to capture Trickster and Piper following their role in the murder of Bart Allen. She struggles to keep the identities of the world's heroes from being stolen and coordinates the response to a global crisis engineered by the Calculator, a villainous hacker and information broker. In The All-New Booster Gold #5 (2007), the title hero is given the mission of traveling back in time in order to prevent \\"a tragedy that he discovers never should've happened‚Äîthe Joker shooting and paralyzing Barbara Gordon, Batgirl.\\" Although Booster Gold makes several attempts to prevent the events which took place in Batman: The Killing Joke, he ultimately fails and Barbara Gordon's chronological history remains unchanged. Rip Hunter convinces him that Barbara's destiny is to become Oracle. Later, Batman reveals that he kept Joker's photos of Barbara and Booster Gold for years and waited until Booster Gold's correct age before confronting him. Batman then thanks Booster Gold for trying to stop the Joker and offers him his friendship. In \\"Whitewater\\", Gail Simone's final story arc on Birds of Prey (2007), Oracle and her team struggle for power with Spy Smasher, a government agent who has taken over the Birds of Prey organization. Eventually, Spy Smasher is forced to admit her defeat and returns control of the Birds of Prey organization to Oracle. At the conclusion of the arc, Oracle also adopts Misfit into the Birds of Prey. Sean McKeever temporarily took over as author of Birds of Prey, writing issues #113‚Äì117, Birds of Prey: Metropolis or Dust (2008). The following arc of the series Birds of Prey: Platinum Flats (2008) is written by Tony Bedard. In the company-wide 2008 Final Crisis storyline, Darkseid‚Äîwho has finally gained control of the Anti-Life Equation‚Äîattempts to put the mind-control equation on the internet. Both Oracle and Mister Terrific make desperate attempts to stop Darkseid, even attempting to shut down the entire Internet. Unfortunately, they both fail and those affected ended up mindless slaves of Darkseid. Freed from Darkseid's control after the restoration of the Multiverse, she attempts to shut down the criminal Unternet set up by her opposite number, the Calculator, as a Darkseid-free replacement for the regular Internet and still used by tech- savvy criminals. However, the Calculator, preventing her moves, takes control of the Kilg%re, gaining the ability to thrive in cyberspace by controlling digital and cybernetic avatars, and tracks Oracle down with his newfound powers. Even though Oracle foils him, she starts doubting her abilities and fears she's losing her edge and brilliance, which results in her disbanding the Birds of Prey team to do some soul-searching. Birds of Prey received cancellation in early 2009, with the final issue being #127. Oracle is subsequently featured in Oracle: The Cure, a limited series written by Kevin VanHook and a crossover arc with Batman: Battle for the Cowl (2009). The story chronologically follows the events of Final Crisis and Batman R.I.P. (2008). Oracle has returned to Gotham, and although the Birds of Prey are disbanded, she continues to summon them to help Nightwing and Robin deal with the growing crime in Gotham. The Calculator's plans finally come to their fruition, and Kuttler, hoping to save his dying daughter Wendy takes on the \\"Babbage\\" alias and begins prowling the digital world of Alta Viva, a virtual world game, for fragments of the Anti-Life Equation unleashed by Darkseid. Oracle, now living in a dilapidated rented apartment in Gotham, becomes aware of Kuttler's activities after \\"Cheesefiend\\", one of her informants, is brutally killed, with the Anti-Life Equation itself, after coming in contact with Babbage. Hoping to stop the Calculator and prevent him from piecing together the fragments of the Anti-Life Equation in his possession, Oracle travels to Hong Kong, hoping to steal them back by the means of an advanced supercomputer programmed to track the chunk of data left behind by Babbage. However, the Calculator discovers her attempts, swearing vengeance upon her. She manages to defeat Calculator, rendering the Anti-Life Equation's fragments useless. In 2009, the Batgirl comic book was relaunched with Stephanie Brown starring as the title character. Although Oracle initially tries to discourage Brown from crime-fighting, she eventually comes to accept her as Batgirl. She also mentors the Calculator's daughter, Wendy Harris, who was crippled following an attack at Titans Tower. Oracle later takes a job as an assistant professor at Gotham University. During the Green Lantern limited series Blackest Night, Hal Jordan crashes into the Bat-Signal after a fight with the Black Lantern Martian Manhunter. Oracle and Commissioner Gordon are both present. Origins & Omens hints towards an involvement in the storyline. After sending Green Lantern's intel to every superhero community across the planet of the Black Lanterns, the Gordons find themselves being attacked by the original Dark Knight's deceased rogue gallery members, who are all reanimated by the Black Lantern Corps. Oracle and her father are forced to fight for their lives as they witness the Black Lanterns massacring everyone on sight at Gotham Central. During the crisis, Oracle is rendered unconscious by an explosion and is possessed by Deadman, who uses Oracle's body to save Commissioner Gordon from the reanimated King Snake and the Trigger Twins. After being rescued by Batman, Robin, and Red Robin, the Gordons were attacked by Batman and Red Robin's parents with their saviors, the reanimated Graysons and the Drakes. While Grayson and Drake battle the Black Lanterns, Robin takes the Gordons to their underground base where Alfred tends her and her father's wounds. In Greg Rucka's Detective Comics #862, Barbara Gordon is approached by Huntress and Renee Montoya (the new Question) for help in tracking down a mysterious criminal who ordered a hit on them. Montoya is flabbergasted upon discovering that \\"Commissioner Gordon's daughter\\" is a superhero. In 2010, Birds of Prey was relaunched with Gail Simone returning to write the comic. The first arc is a tie-in with the Green Lantern Brightest Day limited series. Oracle reforms the Birds of Prey, this time with Dove and the recently resurrected Hawk as members. A new villainess calling herself the White Canary begins menacing the Birds, and publicly reveals Black Canary's civilian identity and frames her for a murder. While the team contends with White Canary in the streets of Gotham, Oracle is kidnapped by her former associates, Savant and Creote. This is eventually revealed to be a ruse in order to trick White Canary. Following the team's victory against White Canary, Oracle fakes her death during a battle with Calculator. With most of the criminal underworld now believing that she is dead, Oracle cuts off ties with all but a select few Gotham heroes, and is shown refusing to help Blue Beetle, Manhunter, and Booster Gold when they attempt to call her for assistance during battle. In Grant Morrison's Batman: The Return (2010), an installment of the limited series Bruce Wayne: The Road Home (2010), Batman enlists Oracle to help him run Batman Incorporated, a new global team of Batmen. He tasks her with helping him fight crime on a virtual front, and shows her a new modified Batgirl design that acts as her virtual avatar. Oracle is later shown directing Cassandra Cain, now known as Blackbat, on a mission in Hong Kong, where she captures some heroin smugglers for Batman. In Scott Snyder's Black Mirror storyline, Barbara Gordon is kidnapped by her brother, James Gordon Jr., who had returned to Gotham after a lengthy absence to become a serial killer. He stabs her in both of her legs, positioning the knives so that if she removes them, she will bleed to death. As she slowly bleeds, she is able to use her wits to distract him long enough for Batman and Commissioner Gordon to arrive and defeat her brother. =The New 52: Batgirl, Birds of Prey, and other appearances (2011‚Äì2016)= In September, 2011, following the company-wide relaunch, Barbara Gordon stars in a new Batgirl series‚Äîone of The New 52 titles featuring the company's most iconic characters. The conclusion of the limited series Flashpoint (2011) establishes a new continuity within the DC Universe, with all characters regressing to a younger age and earlier stage in their careers, while remaining in a modern timeline. DC Senior VP of Sales, Bob Wayne, explained that with each of their titles reverting to issue #1, \\"our creative teams have the ability to take a more modern approach‚Äînot only with each character, but with how the characters interact with one another and the universe as a whole, and focus on the earlier part of the careers of each of our iconic characters.\\" Wayne also stated that \\"The Killing Joke still happened and she was Oracle. Now she will go through physical rehabilitation and become a more seasoned and nuanced character because she had these incredible and diverse experiences. Public reaction to the change has been mixed, and has included criticism that DC has reduced the diversity of their character lineup, as well as \\"being disrespectful of the power the character had gained as a symbol to the disabled community in her role as Oracle.\\" DC Comics co-publisher Dan DiDio explained the decision by stating that \\"[w]e didn't want to turn our back on the diversity issue, but she'll always be the most recognizable [Batgirl]. We are working with concerns to diversify the line. We're always looking to re-position to be reflective of today's audience.\\" Gail Simone, who will be writing the series, stated: \\"For many years, I got to write the character as Oracle, and there is to this day, no character who means more to me. This is classic Barbara as she was originally conceived, with a few big surprises. It's a bit of a shock, to be sure, but we're doing everything we can to be respectful to this character's amazing legacy, while presenting something thrilling that a generation of comics readers will be experiencing for the first time ... Barbara Gordon leaping, fighting, and swinging over Gotham. Now, when citizens of that city look up, they are going to see BATGIRL. And that is absolutely thrilling.\\" In the new, revised continuity, the events of The Killing Joke took place three years before the current storyline, and while it is established she was paraplegic during that time, Barbara Gordon is written as having regained her mobility after undergoing experimental surgery at a South African clinic. Series writer Gail Simone stated that while the character is \\"one of the smartest and toughest women in comics ... One thing the book is truly about, is that the after-effects of something like PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) or other trauma-related syndromes, can strike even very smart, very intellectually tough people, even soldiers and cops\\", a subject that is generally overlooked in comic books. She also explained the method of the character's recovery is based upon real life experiences in that \\"some of the best real world work in the field of mobility rehabilitation is coming from South Africa. People have been talking about this as if it's some sort of mystical thing like returning from the dead, but there are treatments and surgeries that can restore mobility in some cases. Barbara's spine was not severed. That makes her a candidate.\\" Prior to release, Batgirl #1 sold out at the distribution level with over 100,000 copies printed in its first run according to Diamond Comic Distributors. Along with Action Comics #1, Justice League #1, Batman #1, Batman and Robin #1, Batman: The Dark Knight #1, Detective Comics #1, Flash #1, Green Lantern #1, and Superman #1, retailers were required to order a second printing. Calvin Reid of Publishers Weekly states in a review of the first issue: \\"The artwork is okay though conventional, while Simone's script tries to tie up of the end of the previous Barbara Gordon/Oracle storyline and setup up the new Batgirl. Her formula: murderous villains, blood splattering violence and high flying superheroics mixed with single-white-female bonding ... plus a cliffhanger ending to the first issue that offers a nifty [segue] into the new world of Barbara Gordon and Batgirl.\\" The New York Times critic George Gene Gustines wrote: \\"Unlike some of the other DC comics I read this week, Batgirl achieves a deft hat trick: a well-shaped reintroduction to a character, an elegant acknowledgement of fundamental history and the establishment of a new status quo. This is a must-buy series.\\" Earning a B+ rating in a review from Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker writes that Simone \\"[takes] her Birds of Prey storytelling powers and focuses them on the newly revived Barbara Gordon as Batgirl. The result is a burst of exhilaration, as Barbara/Batgirl revels in her new freedom even as she encounters a so-far not- terribly-chilling villain called Mirror.\\" Since the series relaunch in September 2011, Batgirl has remained within the top 30 of the 300 best-selling monthly comic book publications sold in North America. Monthly estimated sales figures are as follows: Batgirl #1 with 81,489 copies (ranked 12th overall), Batgirl #2 with 75,227 (ranked 14th), Batgirl #3 with 62,974 (ranked 18th), Batgirl #4 with 53,975 (ranked 23rd), Batgirl #5 with 51,327 (ranked 26th), and Batgirl #6 with 47,836 (ranked 30th). The hardcover edition of volume 1, Batgirl: The Darkest Reflection, which collects issues #1-6, made The New York Times Best Seller list, alongside Animal Man: The Hunt, Batman & Robin: Born to Kill, Batman: Detective Comics, Wonder Woman: Blood, Batwoman: Hydrology, Green Lantern: Sinestro. Additionally, Barbara Gordon makes an appearance in Birds of Prey #1, where Black Canary offers her a spot on the new Birds of Prey roster. She declines Canary's invitation, suggesting that Katana take her place instead.Birds of Prey (vol. 3) #1 Series writer Duane Swierczynski has stated that Batgirl will join the team in issue #4. He commented that while she \\"is an essential part of this team\\", she is not the focus of the series, as she is hesitant to be associated with the other characters because of their status as outlaws. In October 2014, the monthly Batgirl title underwent a soft reboot with the new creative team Brenden Fletcher (writer) Cameron Stewart (writer, layouts), Babs Tarr (artist) and Maris Wicks (colors). The first six- issue story explored Barbara Gordon's attempt to start a new life as a PhD student in the hip Gotham borough of Burnside. While seemingly light and engaging compared to Gail Simone's darker preceding run, the new arc ultimately dealt with Babs' inability to fully escape her earlier trauma and the villain was revealed as her own brain scans, an algorithm similar to the pre-New 52 Oracle. While the reboot was highly praised for its innovative use of social media, its fun and energy, and particularly for Tarr's art, several critics condemned the villain Dagger Type in issue #37 as a transphobic caricature. In response, the creative team issued a joint apology and revised the issue for the subsequent collected edition, Batgirl Vol. 1: The Batgirl of Burnside. On March 13, 2015 DC Comics released 25 Joker-themed variant covers for its various monthly series for release that June, in celebration of the character's 75th anniversary. Among them was a cover to Batgirl #41 by artist Rafael Albuquerque that took its inspiration from The Killing Joke. The cover depicts the Joker standing next to a tearful Batgirl, who has a red smile painted across her mouth. The Joker has one hand holding a revolver draped over Batgirl's shoulder and is pointing to her cheek with the other hand, as if gesturing to shoot her. The cover quickly drew criticism for highlighting a dark period in the character's history, especially when juxtaposed with the youthful, more optimistic direction of the series at the time. The hashtag #changethecover drew hundreds of posts on Twitter and Tumblr asking DC to not release the variant. DC ultimately withdrew the cover from publication at the request of Albuquerque, who stated, \\"My intention was never to hurt or upset anyone through my art...For that reason, I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled.\\"Ching, Albert (March 16, 2015). \\"DC Comics Cancels 'Batgirl' Joker Variant Cover at Artist's Request\\".

In volume five of Batgirl, Barbara Gordon is a student attending Burnside College in the trendy Burnside neighborhood of Gotham City.Batgirl (vol. 5) #7 =Alternative versions= Various alterations of the Barbara Gordon character have appeared in storylines published in and out of mainstream continuity titles. Variants of the character within continuity often appear in stories which involve time travel, such as the crossover limited series Zero Hour: Crisis in Time, a follow-up story preceded by the 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths which altered mainstream continuity. Notable imprints of DC Comics such as Elseworlds and All Star DC Comics have also featured alternate versions of the character. Barbara Gordon, as both Batgirl and Oracle, has made several appearances in Elseworlds comics since 1997. The Elseworlds imprint takes the company's iconic characters and places them in alternate timelines, places and events making heroes \\"as familiar as yesterday seem as fresh as tomorrow.\\" The character is given starring roles in the noir-style storyline Thrillkiller: Batgirl & Robin (1997), its sequel Batgirl + Batman: Thrillkiller '62 (1998), and the one-shot comic Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl & Batgirl (1998), all of which depict worlds where Barbara is Gotham's first bat-themed hero (Bruce Wayne is a police detective who becomes Batman in the 1960s-set Thrillkiller series, and merely serves as essentially her 'Alfred' in Elseworld's Finest in a timeline where Jim Gordon was killed rather than the Waynes). Barbara Gordon on the cover of Batgirl: Futures End #1 (Nov. 2014), art by Clay Mann In addition, the character has supporting roles in JLA: The Nail (1998), JLA: Created Equal (2000), Superman & Batman: Generations (2003), Batman: Year 100 (2006), and Batman: Earth One (2012). A version of her appears as \\"Nightwing\\" in the Smallville comic series, replacing Stephanie Brown as previously promoted. In 2005, DC Comics launched its All Star imprint‚Äîan ongoing series of comics designed to pair the company's most iconic characters with the most acclaimed writers and artists in the industry. Similar to Elseworlds, All Star is not restricted to continuity and establishes a fresh perspective for the latest generation of readership. According to Dan DiDio, \\"[t]hese books are created to literally reach the widest audience possible, and not just the comic book audience, but anyone who has ever wanted to read or see anything about Superman or Batman.\\" An alternate Barbara Gordon was adapted into Frank Miller's All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder (2005) as a teenage Batgirl. In addition, another variation of the character had been set to star in an eponymous All Star Batgirl title, written by Geoff Johns; however, the series was canceled prior to publication. In Batgirl: Future's End #1 (Nov. 2014), set in an alternate future, a trio of Batgirls include Casandra Cain, Stephanie Brown, and newcomer Tiffany Fox‚Äîthe daughter of Lucius Fox and the first African American character to be portrayed as Batgirl. In 2015, DC began publishing DC Bombshells, a title that places its characters in an alternate history primarily set during the 1930s and 1940s. In digital issue #42 (collected as print issue #14), Harley Quinn tells Pamela Isley about encountering \\"the Belle of the Bog\\", who appears to be a vampire version of Batgirl. DC Comics Bombshells Annual #1, published on 31 August 2016, reveals that Barbara Gourdon was a French fighter pilot during World War I. After she lost her boyfriend during the war, she traveled to Louisiana and did indeed become a vampire. Critical and editorial commentary In the aftermath of Batman: The Killing Joke, Barbara Gordon's paralysis has been the subject of debate, with arguments in favor of, and against, restoring her mobility. Writers, artists, editorial staff and critics have spoken in great length about the nature of subject, citing responses from readership, issues of sexism, diversity and representation, as well as other considerations that have impacted decisions regarding the character's portrayal. =Commentary in favor of Batgirl= Reacting to The Killing Joke and Barbara Gordon's later character development as Oracle in Batman: Gotham Knights, Ray Tate, a reviewer at Comics Bulletin, wrote \\"[t]here is absolutely no reason why Barbara Gordon should be in a wheelchair. Alan Moore and Brian Bolland meant The Killing Joke as an imaginary tale dealing with the iconography of Batman and the Joker ... [Batman] himself is a certifiable genius in biochemistry. There are countless examples of Batman employing that which is only theoretical in his fight against crime. His knowledge of stem cell technology should surpass that of the real world. There is simply no reason for Barbara Gordon to be confined to that wheelchair.\\" Regarding her representation as a character living with a disability, and her effectiveness as a hero compared to her incarnation as Batgirl, Tate asserts \\"[i]t's ridiculous to think somebody wakes up thinking how lucky they are to be confined to a wheelchair, and yet the attitude around DC and among the fans is that Oracle is the better character over Batgirl because of her handicap. Rubbish. Batgirl has fought more crime and done more to aid Batman as Batgirl than she has as Oracle. Batgirl has saved Batman's life on numerous occasions. Oracle has not. Barbara in this incarnation is not a bad character, but she is not better because she no longer hunts the night in cape and cowl.\\" In an article for Bitch magazine entitled \\"The Cold Shoulder: Saving Superheroines from Comic-book Violence\\", Shannon Cochran noted a long history of inequality regarding the treatment of female heroes. She quotes Gail Simone, who discussed the gender difference regarding the treatment of Batman and Batgirl regarding paralysis: \\"Both had their backs broken [Batman broke his in a dramatic Batcave confrontation with the villain Bane; Batgirl broke hers when she was ambushed in her home and shot in the spine by the Joker, never given a chance to fight]. Less than a year later, Batman was fine. Batgirl‚Äînow named Oracle‚Äîwas in a wheelchair and remained so for many years.\\" Artist Alex Ross and writer/producer Paul Dini made attempts to return the character to her original conception. Ross explained in an interview that he and Dini had planned to restore her mobility by placing her in a Lazarus Pit, a naturally occurring chemical pool in the DC Universe that has rejuvenating effects when a person is submerged within it. He stated that \\"we pitched then-Batman editor Denny O'Neil with these drawings of that costume design. The idea of using the red instead of the traditional yellow was meant to invoke the idea that coming from the Lazarus Pit, she was in a way, more compromised as a character ... Denny shot it down, because, according to him, everybody loves Barbara Gordon as Oracle and as a handicapped character. The theory was that DC didn't have enough handicapped characters, so they weren't going to do anything with Barbara as she was. And the design went into the drawer.\\" Kate Kane, the modern Batwoman introduced during 52, wears a variation of what would have been Gordon's new Batgirl costume designed by Ross. =Commentary in favor of Oracle= Although critical reception of Barbara Gordon's evolution into Oracle have been mixed among critics and other observers, according to John Ostrander: \\"We have, over the years, on those occasions when I have worked with the character, gotten some letters from those who have disabilities of one stripe or another and all have been very supportive. I feel very proud for my part in creating Oracle.\\" Supporters of Oracle argue that the Barbara Gordon character provides a greater service to DC Comics and its readers as a disabled character, regardless of the events that caused her paralysis. In her persona as Oracle, Barbara Gordon is not limited to the Batman Family, serving a unique and universal role in the DC universe. DC Senior Vice President Dan DiDio comments, \\"Some stories ... are so strong that undoing them would be a crime. The DCU would be a lesser place without Barry's sacrifice, or the crippling of Barbara at the hands of the Joker.\\" The character went through possible restoration during Birds of Prey when she is infected with microscopic machines known as nanites by the super villain Brainiac, which attempted to repair her DNA. Marc Dipaolo, author of War, Politics and Superheroes: Ethics and Propaganda in Comics and Film (2011) commented that DC writers and editors would not allow her to recover completely, and that \\"[t]he decision was made because there were not enough handicapped superheroes in the DC Universe to justify 'curing' one, and because it would have been odd to see Barbara Gordon escape from her wheelchair in the world of fiction when Christopher Reeve never had that opportunity.\\" =Restoration of the character's mobility and aftermath= In June 2011, DC announced that Barbara Gordon would be returning to the role of Batgirl in September 2011, in her own eponymous monthly comic, as part of a company-wide relaunch of all of their titles. In addition, former Birds of Prey writer Gail Simone would be writing the series. This announcement became one of the most controversial aspects of the DC Comics relaunch. Supporters of Barbara Gordon in her persona as Oracle expressed dismay over losing an iconic character for the disabled community. Journalist and blogger Jill Pantozzi, who is diagnosed with muscular dystrophy, stated that \\"people being disabled is part of the real world, it is essential it be part of the fictional world as well... Writer Kevin Van Hook did a great job showing what disabled individuals have to go through in the mini-series Oracle: The Cure. It's that type of honesty I expect more of ... While some diverse characters were mishandled over the years, Oracle was always treated with the utmost respect but this move is the most disrespectful I've seen in a long time.\\" Gail Simone responded directly by stating that at times when others had attempted to restore Gordon's mobility, she fought to keep her as a disabled character, even in light of requests from readers who also had disabilities that wished to see the character healed. However, part of her reasoning for reversing her decision and writing Batgirl with Gordon as the title character was that \\"[a]rms and legs get ripped off, and they grow back, somehow. Graves don't stay filled. But the one constant is that Barbara stays in that chair. Role model or not, that is problematic and uncomfortable, and the excuses to not cure her, in a world of purple rays and magic and super- science, are often unconvincing or wholly meta-textual. And the longer it goes on, the more it has stretched credibility. But now, everything has changed. If nearly everyone in the DCU, not just Batgirl but almost everyone, is now at a much earlier stage in their career, then my main objection no longer applies, because we are seeing Barbara at an earlier starting point.\\" Former Batman writer and editor Dennis O'Neil and Oracle co-creator John Ostrander have expressed disappointment over the change. O'Neil stated that during his tenure at DC, \\"[W]e had hordes of people in spandex beating up criminals ... We didn't have anybody like Oracle, who overcame a disability and was just as valuable and just as effective in a way that didn't involve violence.\\" However, he also stated that from an alternate point of view, \\"Barbara Gordon's perception in the mainstream public as Batgirl would be a very valid consideration.\\" Ostrander continues to view Oracle as a stronger character than Batgirl, but has also expressed faith in Gail Simone's skills as a writer. He commented that \\"[t]imes change and characters and people evolve. I changed things when I wrote characters, including changing Barbara to Oracle. Others do the same for this era ... Gail Simone is a good friend and a wonderful writer and I'm sure her work will be wonderful.\\" Characterization =Silver Age= At the time of her conception, Barbara Gordon's character was intended to reflect the women's liberation movement as an educated, career-oriented young woman, as well as a capable crime-fighter. Batgirl is considered to be one of the most popular characters to have emerged during the Silver Age of Comic Books. In The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines (2009), author Mike Madrid states: \\"While she embodied the spirit of a new wave of liberated superheroines, in the backdrop of the history of comic books, Batgirl carried on the tradition of the gutsy female vigilantes of the '40s who struck out on their own to right wrongs.\\" Although she is discouraged by Batman to engage in crime-fighting, she defiantly ignores his objections. Her career choice as a librarian is speculated to be due in part to the fact that it works as a convincing cover for her much more dangerous work as Batgirl. In an effort to conceal her identity from not only her enemies, but her father, Commissioner Gordon, and Batman and Robin, she initially conforms to appearance and personality traits stereotypical of a librarian. In her civilian identity, she is seen with her hair \\"tied up tightly in a bun. And she wears traditionally conservative‚Äînot to say dowdy‚Äîclothing. In other words, she embodies the stereotypical image of the female librarian of the day‚Äîbusy doing clerical tasks while attired and made up in such a way as to guarantee to minimize whatever physical attractiveness she might possess beneath her frumpy exterior.\\" Although her introduction was intended to embody feminist ideology, aspects of her persona were also considered to be sexist, such as the fact that \\"[m]uch of her arsenal was carried in a Bat-purse attached to her utility belt[.]\\" =Bronze Age= In spite of shortcomings in her characterization during the late 1960s, \\"by the early 1970s, Batgirl had matured, using her keen intellect, athletic dexterity, and burgeoning detective skills to solve petty and not-so-petty thefts\\". Her color scheme from the Adventures of Batman cartoon are used as her primary outfit. However, by the end of the Bronze Age of Comic Books in the mid-1980s (and with the dark, gritty influence of Frank Miller's work on the Batman-related titles), Batgirl became less valuable to the franchise \\"where there was not as much room for a librarian fighting crime in high heels\\". In this environment, Barbara Gordon becomes increasingly skeptical of her effectiveness as Batgirl until she decides to give up crime- fighting permanently. =Modern Age= Robin Anne Reid, in her 2008 book, Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews notes a lack of characterization given to Barbara Gordon by Alan Moore in Batman: The Killing Joke, stating, \\"Barbara Gordon was not portrayed as the intelligent and resourceful woman who assumed the Batgirl persona; she was portrayed as a cocoa-serving homemaker overly concerned with the mess her father was making cutting and pasting news clippings.\\" Following the character's recreation as Oracle, she is shown having overcome her paralysis at the hands of the Joker by utilizing her intellect to once again engage in crime-fighting as an information broker. Speaking on her characterization as a person living with a disability, comic writer Devin Grayson stated that being \\"[h]yper-defensive about her [paralysis], she has, if anything, over compensated. However, her very determination to remain self-reliant, though admirable and inspiring, has made her less willing than ever to accept support or aid of any kind.\\" A defining characteristic of Barbara Gordon is her sense of morality, which differs from that of Batman and her primary field agent Black Canary. She has demonstrated a willingness to use lethal force, such as in Chuck Dixon's Birds of Prey issue #10, \\"State of War\\", which contradicts the methodology used by her closest allies and most DC Comics characters. Dixon stated in an interview that \\"[s]he's less morally conflicted than other characters. She's very 'means to an end' oriented. She sees that sometimes you have to kill to save lives. She's not comfortable with that but accepts it. She would do anything to avoid using deadly force but, when push comes to shove, she'll drop the hammer.\\" She demonstrates a similar moral ambiguity in Gail Simone's Birds of Prey: Of Like Minds when she argues with Black Canary over using illegally obtained information, which denies criminals the right of due process. Although the Huntress has never been opposed to using lethal force, she also comes into conflict with Oracle over the fact that she will use the psychological impact of a mission to subconsciously manipulate her field agents into conforming to her ideology. =The New 52= As part of DC Comics' 2011 relaunch, The New 52, Barbara Gordon's paralysis is described as lasting only three years time. In Batgirl (volume 4), the character's age is reduced, and she is depicted as a recent college graduate, having earned a degree in forensic psychology. Although she resumes her work as Batgirl one year after recovering her mobility, she continues to suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder, causing her to hesitate in battle when exposed to gunfire that could result in receiving new spinal damage. The character also exhibits survivor guilt due to the fact that she has made a full recovery from her paralysis while others have not. In a September 2011 interview, Gail Simone stated, \\"I'm enjoying writing Batgirl at this stage in her life. She's younger, she doesn't know everything, she's been immersed in school and her life plan. Events conspire to change that plan, and she's nervous about that. I love writing Barbara under pretty much any conditions, but this really is a key time for her.\\" In Batgirl #45, Barbara Gordon began a romantic relationship with Luke Fox, the son of Lucius Fox and the new Batwing. Some of the character's background and previous relationships were erased. According to the artist of the new Batgirl series, Babs Tarr, Barbara Gordon and Dick Grayson were never romantically involved in the New 52 continuity. =DC Rebirth= For DC's 2016 DC Rebirth launch, Barbara Gordon headlines two monthly series: Batgirl (vol. 5) and Batgirl and the Birds of Prey. Batgirl (vol. 5), which is written by Hope Larson and illustrated by Rafael Albuquerque, begins with Barbara touring Asia to train with Eastern fighters.http://www.dccomics.com/comics/batgirl-2016/batgirl-1 Batgirl and the Birds of Prey, which is written by Julie and Shawna Benson, and is illustrated by Claire Roe, reunites her with former teammates the Black Canary and the Huntress (Helena Bertinelli).http://www.dccomics.com/comics/batgirl-and-the- birds-of-prey-2016/batgirl-and-the-birds-of-prey-rebirth-1 The first arc of the series restores her prior history as \\"Oracle\\", as the team works to track down an impostor using the alias.Benson, Julie; Benson, Shawna (2016).

DC Comics In the DC Rebirth continuity, Barbara continues to operate in Burnside after training in Asia.http://www.dccomics.com/comics/batgirl-2016/batgirl-7 She also shows a renewed romantic interest in Dick Grayson, but is unsuccessful due to him already being in a relationship.Benson, Julie; Benson, Shawna (2016). Batgirl and the Birds of Prey #7. DC Comics Powers and abilities =Martial artistry= According to the character's fictional biography, Barbara Gordon trained in Judo,Detective Comics #359 (January 1967)Batman: Gotham Knights #6 (August 2000) Kung Fu, Eskrima, KarateWho's Who: Update '87 #1 (August 1987) and Jujutsu, earning black belts prior to her tenure as Batgirl and is described as being a \\"star athlete.\\" Following the events of The Killing Joke, Barbara Gordon continued to train in martial arts as Oracle, despite being paralyzed from the waist down. She has extensive skills with eskrima fighting sticks, small firearms, and batarangs; she customarily keeps a pair of eskrima sticks stored in the armrests of her wheelchair as a contingency. In the revised continuity of The New 52, she reflects on the fact that she has been taking self-defense training since age 6 in Batgirl #0 (2012). =Intelligence and technological skill= Gordon is written as having a genius-level intellect and naturally possessing a photographic memory. She is described by Gail Simone as the most intelligent member of the Batman family and among all characters having operated out of Gotham City. Prior to the character's career as a vigilante, Barbara Gordon developed many technological skills, including vast knowledge of computers and electronics, expert skills as a hacker, and graduate training in library sciences. Like Batman, Barbara Gordon originally used a wide variety of computer electronics and gadgets during her early adventures as Batgirl. These included an infrared scanner built into the cowl of her costume, various bat-inspired weaponry, and the Batcycle. According to Gail Simone, Oracle maintains control over the 12 technologically advanced satellites that were created by Lex Luthor during his tenure as President of the United States. =Information broker= As Oracle, Barbara Gordon placed her considerable skills and knowledge at the disposal of many of the DC Universe's heroes. She is a skilled hacker, capable of retrieving and dispersing information from private satellites, military installations, government files, and the properties of Lex Luthor. Batman, himself a genius with a wide knowledge base and access to vast information resources, routinely consults Oracle for assistance. Writer and editor Dennis O'Neil, who first established Oracle as Batman's intellectual equal and source of information, stated that \\"[i]t was logical for her to be there in Batman's world ... Batman would need someone like that.\\" Cultural impact Since her debut in DC Comics publication, and fueled by her adaptation into the Batman television series in 1967, Barbara Gordon has been listed among fictional characters that are regarded as cultural icons. Author Brian Cronin, in Was Superman A Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed (2009) notes that following her 1967 debut, \\"Batgirl was soon popular enough to appear regularly over the next two decades and Yvonne Craig certainly made an impression on many viewers with her one season portraying young Ms. Gordon.\\" Similarly, Cronin states that following the publication of The Killing Joke, Barbara Gordon‚Äîin her new persona as Oracle‚Äîbecame \\"more popular, in fact, than she was when she was Batgirl. She even gained her own title, Birds of Prey, about her and a group of superhero operatives she organizes[.]\\" The character has been the subject of analysis in academia, regarding the portrayal of women, librarians, and disabled people in mainstream media. Throughout the course of the character's history, Barbara Gordon's intelligence has been one of her defining attributes. According to BusinessWeek, she is listed as one of the top ten most intelligent fictional superheroes appearing in American comics, and is the only female character to appear on the list. In 2011, Barbara Gordon was ranked 17th in both IGN's \\"Top 100 Comic Book Heroes\\" and Comics Buyer's Guide's \\"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\\". =Feminist interpretations= In The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines (2009), author Mike Madrid states that what set Barbara Gordon as Batgirl apart from other female characters was her motivation for crime-fighting. Unlike Batwoman who preceded her, \\"she wears his symbol on her chest, but she is not his girlfriend or faithful handmaiden.\\" Because she does not pursue a romantic interest in Batman, \\"Batgirl is a female Batman can actually regard as a brilliant peer and a partner in the war on crime, the same way he would a male.\\" Historian Peter Sanderson observed that while \\"Barbara Gordon initially conformed to hackneyed stereotypes as a dowdy librarian ... her transformation into Batgirl could be seen in retrospect as a symbol of the emerging female empowerment movement of the 1960s. (Moreover, by the 1970s Barbara had given herself a makeover even in her 'civilian identity' and ran for Congress.)\\" In the 1980s, Barbara Kesel, after writing a complaint to DC Comics over the negative portrayal of female characters, was given the opportunity to write for Barbara Gordon in Detective Comics. Robin Anne Reid, in Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews (2009), wrote that \\"Kesel's version of Batgirl established her as a character separate from Batman and Robin: a woman motivated to do what men do, but alone and in her own way. Her Secret Origins (1987) and Batgirl Special (1988) countered the victimized and objectified presentation of Barbara Gordon/Batgirl in Alan Moore's acclaimed The Killing Joke (1988).\\" She notes that Kesel's interpretation of the character emphasized her intelligence, technological skill, and ability to overcome fear. Commenting on Barbara Gordon's eventual evolution into Oracle, she states \\"[m]any readers and individuals within the industry believe that Barbara Gordon became a 'better' character after she was paralyzed, but few people comment on specifics of the event that allowed her to become that 'better' character.\\" In Superheroes and Superegos: Analyzing the Minds Behind the Masks (2010), author Sharon Packer wrote that \\"[a]nyone who feels that feminist critics overreacted to [Gordon's] accident is advised to consult the source material\\", calling the work \\"sadistic to the core.\\" Brian Cronin noted that \\"[many] readers felt the violence towards Barbara Gordon was too much, and even Moore, in retrospect, has expressed his displeasure with how the story turned out.\\" Jeffrey A. Brown, author of Dangerous Curves: Action Heroines, Gender, Fetishism, and Popular Culture (2011) noted The Killing Joke as an example of the \\"inherent misogyny of the male-dominated comic book industry\\" in light of the \\"relatively unequal violence [female characters] are subjected to.\\" While male characters may be critically injured or killed, they are more than likely to be returned to their original conception, while female characters are more likely to receive permanent damage. Reid states that although speculation behind the editorial decision to allow the paralysis of the character to become permanent included the idea she had become outdated, \\"if audiences had grown tired of Batgirl, it was not because she was a bad character but because she had been written badly.\\" Despite views that present the character's Batgirl persona as a symbol of female empowerment, a long-held criticism is that she was originally conceived as an uninspired variation of Batman \\"rather than standing alone as leader, such as Wonder Woman\\" who had no pre-existing male counterpart. In analyzing stereotypes in gender, Jackie Marsh noted that male superheroes (such as Batman) are depicted as hyper- masculine and anti-social, \\"while female superheroes are reduced to a childlike status by their names\\" such as the Batgirl character. Professor James B. South, chairman of the Department of Philosophy at Marquette University, stated that Barbara Gordon's character development as Oracle gave her a sense of independence she could not achieve as Batgirl. During her tenure as Batman's protege, \\"she seems to develop her own style of fighting as Batgirl, [but] she's still basically following in Batman's footsteps.\\" Following The Killing Joke, her recreation as Oracle, and the launch of Birds of Prey, \\"we see Barbara Gordon as a team leader and her transformation from a girl into a woman.\\" =Representation for library and information science= In The Image and Role of the Librarian (2002), Wendi Arant and Candace R. Benefiel argue that her portrayal as a librarian is considered to be significant to the profession, in that it is represented as a valuable and honorable career. Even in light of the fact that the character abandons it in order to run for United States Congress, Barbara Gordon is seen as being given a \\"career switch that even most librarians would consider a step up.\\" In the essay \\"Librarians, Professionalism and Image: Stereotype and Reality\\" (2007), Abigail Luthmann views the character less favorably, stating that \\"[t]he unassuming role of librarian is used as a low-visibility disguise for her crime-fighting alter-ego, and while her information-locating skills may have been useful to her extra-curricular activities no direct examples are given.\\" Unlike her earlier incarnation as Batgirl, \\"[a]s Oracle, Barbara Gordon is arguably the first true librarian-as-super-hero yet seen in a mainstream comic book (as opposed to a super-hero who happens to be a librarian in his/her private life).\\" Wendi Arant and Candace R. Benefiel note that Oracle exerts her influence over the DC Universe primarily from home, putting \\"to full use the information science skills [she] learned on her way to her PhD\\" In her new persona, \\"the physically challenged but superbly resourceful Oracle occupies a unique place in the annals of superhero-dom‚Äîthe 'information goddess' as crime stopper.\\" Using Barbara Gordon in her role as Oracle, author Sean Wise asserts her character as a model for business networking. In How to Be a Business Superhero: Prepare for Everything, Train with the Best, Make Your Own Destiny at Work (2008) he states that \\"[o]ver the last decade, Oracle has shown the power of a strong network of contacts, and in doing so she shows Business Superheroes the importance of cultivating contacts and developing assets that can further their collective goals.\\" Over the years, the American Library Association and DC Comics have collaborated on multiple projects to promote literacy. These efforts frequently involve Barbara Gordon. In 2004, artist Gene Ha created a poster and bookmark that depicted Barbara Gordon walking in a library. Her Batgirl costume appears in a window's reflection. The tagline \\"Librarians are heroes every day!\\" appears at the bottom of the poster and bookmark. In 2009, a poster featured Barbara Gordon as the Oracle alongside Batman, Nightwing, Robin, the Cassandra Cain version of Batgirl, and Huntress. In 2015, the ALA and DC Comics collaborated on a new set of posters and bookmarks in the ALA's \\"READ\\" campaign. By herself, Barbara Gordon appears in the \\"Batgirl of Burnside\\" guise as envisioned by Babs Tarr. In another design, she appears as the Oracle alongside other members of the extended Bat Family. =Representation for the disabled= Following the character's reinvention as the information broker Oracle, she has been regarded as a symbol of empowerment for disabled people. In Unleashing the Superhero in Us All (2008), author T. James Musler notes that \\"[f]or quite sometime, any handicap was considered insurmountable\\" citing Franklin D. Roosevelt as an example, who was never photographed in a wheelchair to avoid a perception of weakness. In reference to Barbara Gordon, he states \\"[r]ather than quitting crime fighting, Barbara combines her intellect and computer skills to help the superhero community by gathering and passing along information.\\" Her character thus signifies that \\"[n]o longer is a handicap overwhelming, a person can live a strong good life, handicap or not.\\" In The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia Of Comic-Book Icons And Hollywood Heroes (2004), author Gina Ren√©e Misiroglu observes that while disabled characters in comic books are typically utilized as gimmicks, or‚Äîas with Charles Xavier and Daredevil‚Äîare introduced with a pre-existing condition as part of their origin myth, \\"[a]s Oracle... Gordon stands tall as the most empowering disabled superhero. Readers witnessed her tragedy, and watched her rise above it.\\" James B. South's chapter \\"Barbara Gordon and Moral Perfectionism\\" in the 2004 book Superheroes and Philosophy analyzes how the changes in her life \\"from librarian to Batgirl to Oracle\\" drive her to pursue a higher self, illustrating the philosophical theory of moral perfectionism. In other media alt=Yvonne Craig poses in the Batgirl costume from the 1960s television show After the character was introduced in Detective Comics #359 in January 1967, at the request of the producers of the 1960s Batman television series, she was introduced into the television seriesportrayed by Yvonne Craigin the season 3 premiere \\"Enter Batgirl, Exit Penguin\\", in September that same year. Les Daniels, in Batman: The Complete History (2004), wrote that the goal of ABC was to \\"attract new audience members, especially idealistic young girls and less high-minded older men.\\" According to Craig: \\"I used to think the reason they hired me was because they knew I could ride my own motorcycle ... I realized they hired me because I had a cartoon voice.\\" A shared criticism of Batgirl and other female superheroes portrayed later in television (such as Wonder Woman and the Bionic Woman), is that she was not allowed to engage in hand-to-hand combat on screen. As such, \\"her fights were choreographed carefully to imitate the moves of a Broadway showgirl through the use of a straight kick to her opponent's face rather than the type of kick a martial artist would use.\\" However, Craig has also stated: \\"I meet young women who say Batgirl was their role model ... They say it's because it was the first time they ever felt girls could do the same things guys could do, and sometimes better. I think that's lovely.\\" During the early 1970s, Craig portrayed Batgirl once again in a public service announcement to advocate equal pay for women. Since Batman, the character has had a long history of appearances in television and other media. As Batgirl, Barbara Gordon plays a supporting role in a string of animated series, voiced by Jane Webb in The Batman/Superman Hour (1968), Melendy Britt in The New Adventures of Batman (1977), Melissa Gilbert in Batman: The Animated Series (1992), Tara Strong in The New Batman Adventures (1997) and Beware the Batman (2013), Danielle Judovits in The Batman (2004), Mae Whitman in Batman: The Brave and the Bold (2008) and Alyson Stoner in Young Justice (2011). The Batman series also showcased the character's first animated adaptation as Oracle, voiced by Kellie Martin in the episode \\"Artifacts\\" (2007). She also appears in DC Super Hero Girls voiced by Mae Whitman in season 1 as Barbara Gordon and season 2 as Batgirl. Other variations of the character that have been adapted into other media include an elderly Barbara Gordon, voiced by Stockard Channing and Angie Harmon in 1999's Batman Beyond, who after retiring as Batgirl, became commissioner of the Gotham City police department. Dina Meyer starred as Barbara Gordon in the television series Birds of Prey (2002). It became the first adaptation to show the character's progression from Batgirl to Oracle, which included her paralysis at the hands of the Joker. Meyer commented on her character's complex history stating: \\"She's multidimensional. She was a former superhero. She was extremely active physically for years, fighting alongside Batman. The unfortunate incident with the Joker took away the use of her legs ... but rather than give up and throw in the towel, as she could've done so easily, she went and studied escrima (a martial art), got stronger in her mental state and, while helping out her father on a case one day, realized she had a knack for solving mysteries. And all of a sudden she became this computer genius.\\" Overall, the series received criticism for its emphasis on aesthetics over plot. It aired for one season before receiving cancellation. In the fourth season of the TV series Arrow, after Felicity Smoak suffered a similar paralyzing injury, Oliver Queen gives her the codename Overwatch while commenting that \\"Oracle\\" was taken. Oliver: \\"Overwatch, we're on site.\\" Felicity: \\"Excuse me?\\" Oliver: \\"Well, I thought it was time you got a code name. What do you think?\\" Felicity: \\"It's perfect.\\" Oliver: \\"Was gonna go with Oracle, but it's taken.\\" Although in the comic books Barbara Gordon was never a member of the Teen Titans, she was slated to appear in the live-action Titans series, when originally proposed for TNT. This version of the character was to be a wheelchair-bound computer expert, but not yet be known as Oracle. This series was subsequently redeveloped for DC Universe without the character. In addition to live-action television and animation, the character has appeared in a number of video games included in the Batman franchise. She appears in The Adventures of Batman & Robin, Batman: Vengeance, Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu and Batman: The Killing Joke voiced by Tara Strong. She is also in Batman: Dark Tomorrow for the first time as Oracle. She also appears in LEGO Batman for the PC, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PlayStation Portable.Game Informer features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph. See \\"LEGO Batman: Character Gallery\\", Game Informer 186 (October 2008): 92. She plays a supporting role as Oracle in Batman: Arkham Asylum for the PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, serving as Batman's guide through Arkham, and is voiced by Kimberly Brooks. She also appears as the radio guide alongside Alfred Pennyworth, as they both serve as Batman's guides in the sequel, Batman: Arkham City. A teenage Barbara also appears in the prequel Batman: Arkham Origins, voiced by Kelsey Lansdowne. In the 2008 live-action film, The Dark Knight, a very young Barbara Gordon is depicted. She is credited as \\"Gordon's Daughter\\", while the name \\"Barbara Gordon\\" is reserved for Commissioner Gordon's wife. She also acts as the primary contact for hero characters as Oracle in DC Universe Online, voiced by Katherine Catmull for the PC and the PlayStation 3. She assists the player through the tutorial and will offer comments and advice throughout the game including a guided tour of the JLA Watchtower. She is a playable character in Injustice: Gods Among Us, with Kimberly Brooks reprising her role. Barbara has returned in Batman: Arkham Knight where she is voiced by Ashley Greene. In addition, Barbara also appears as a playable character as part of the game's season pass. Barbara Gordon appears in the 2017 animated film The Lego Batman Movie voiced by Rosario Dawson. She is introduced taking over from her father Jim Gordon to become the new Police Commissioner of Gotham. This allows for the continuation of still having a 'Commissioner Gordon' and gives a more prominent role to the character. She later dons her cowl and teams up with Batman as Batgirl in addition to her role as Commissioner. In March 2017, it was announced that Joss Whedon was in talks to write, direct and produce a Batgirl film as part of the DC Extended Universe. The film would center on Barbara Gordon, with The New 52 comics by Gail Simone serving as \\"a starting point\\" for the film. Whedon was to begin production on the film in 2018, but stepped down in February 2018. In April 2018, after impressing the studio with her work on the forthcoming film Birds of Prey, Christina Hodson was hired as screenwriter for Batgirl as well. The studio is actively looking for a female director. In the final season of Gotham, Barbara Lee Gordon is shown as the baby of Jim Gordon and his ex-fianc√©e Barbara Kean, named by the latter both after herself and after Jim's wife Dr. Lee Thompkins. Her parents share custody of her. She appears in the final episode portrayed by Jet√© Laurence. Barbara Gordon appears in Harley Quinn as a college student in the second season episode \\"Riddle U\\" where she helps Harley and Poison Ivy take down the Riddler and is seen making her own Batgirl costume.

It is a national historic district that is part of University City. It extends north from Market Street to Spring Garden Street, east to 32nd Street, west to 40th and Spring Garden Streets, and to 44th and Market Streets. History Powelton Village takes its name from the Powel Family, seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Welsh colonialists who held extensive estates in the area. Samuel Powel served as mayor of Philadelphia from 1775 to 1776 and again from 1789-1790. As in other parts of West Philadelphia, in the late 1800s trolley lines opened the area up to urbanization. Powelton soon became a choice residential spot for Philadelphia industrial tycoons. Powelton's luster began to wane by the 1920s, and by the 1940s the neighborhood was populated by low-income families and infested with \\"bottom\\" gangs, whose members lived in a stretch paralleling Market St. known as the \\"Bottom.\\" In the 1960s the Village was home to many members of the counterculture movement, and Powelton today enjoys a strong political activism and anarchist tradition, as well as a healthy multiethnic pluralism.http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/23907-reflections-on-vietnam-and- other-moments-of-campus-activism-an-interview-with-radical-professor-bertram- strieb. In addition to the Powelton Historic District, the Bell Telephone Exchange Building, The Powelton, Frederick A. Poth Houses, and John Shedwick Development Houses are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Neighborhood Commercial activity in Powelton is concentrated on Lancaster Avenue, particularly between 35th Street and 37th Street. The avenue is lined with shops, restaurants, and various other retail establishments. Many local businesses benefit from both Powelton residents and college students. Mad Greeks, Powelton Pizza, Village Pizza, California Pizza, and Ed's are all popular eating places. Lancaster Avenue near 36th Street has also previously been home to upscale Mexican and Thai restaurants. On the avenue near 37th are the newer Non-Stop Gryo, Indian Sizzler and Green Line Caf√©. Residential streets are mostly lined with Victorian twin houses, some of which are traditional family homes, while others have been subdivided into apartments. Detached houses, row houses, and apartment buildings also dot the neighborhood. An abundance of trees, many of which are historic, along with gardens maintained by many community residents, give the neighborhood a distinct feel. This aesthetic environment, along with the proximity to retail establishments and nearby universities, has resulted in increased home values in recent years, with some homes selling for several hundred thousand dollars. The southern end of Powelton Village includes property owned by Drexel University. Many students from Drexel live off-campus in Powelton's urban- structured row-house apartments because of the short walk to campus. The Powelton community has had a love-hate relationship with Drexel University. The Powelton Village Civic Association voices its members' concerns to local authorities. One of the members' concerns included the loss of their view of Center City, prompting Drexel University to limit the height of their new buildings. In recent developments the Powelton Civic Association have begun open attacks and complaints against local landlords in the neighborhood who rent to students in the neighborhood. Transportation Powelton is easily accessed by automobile and public transportation. The neighborhood is close to Interstate 76, and several major streets, including Market, Spring Garden, and 34th, cross the neighborhood. Bike lanes run along Haverford Avenue, Spring Garden Street and its bridge, Lancaster Avenue, and on 38th and 34th Streets south of Lancaster. The neighborhood is close to two subway stops on the Market-Frankford Line, located at 34th and Market and 40th and Market. Powelton is also easily accessed by trolley: the route 10 trolley runs on 36th Street between the Ludlow Street portal and Lancaster Avenue, continuing west on Lancaster Avenue. Additionally, there are two underground trolley stops close to Powelton: 33rd and Market, serving all trolley lines, and 36th and Sansom, serving all lines except route 10. Bus route 31 runs through the neighborhood, traveling north on 33rd, Baring, and 35th, and south on 37th, Baring, and 34th. Route 43 runs east on Spring Garden Street and west on Haverford Avenue. The neighborhood is adjacent to 30th Street Station, which serves all Northeast Corridor trains, the New Jersey Transit Atlantic City Line, and all Regional Rail lines, as well as the Market-Frankford Line and the subway-surface trolley lines. The neighborhood is highly walkable, and features broad, unobstructed sidewalks along grid-pattern streets throughout. Arts and Culture Several art and photo galleries have opened along Lancaster Avenue from 36th to 40th. The Community Education Center, at 35th and Lancaster, holds various community events and gatherings. Spiral Q Puppet Theater is located on Spring Garden Street between 31st and 32nd Streets. Nearby destinations include The Bridge, a movie theater at 40th and Walnut; and the Philadelphia Zoo at 34th and Girard. One signature event is Lancaster Avenue's \\"Second Fridays,\\" so named because it takes place on the second Friday of every month. Shops and galleries are open later and often have various specials, and the event often features live music. Education and Hospitality Public education choices include the Samuel Powel Elementary School at 36th and Powelton, the Drew School at 37th and Lancaster, and University City High School at 36th and Filbert. The University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University both have significant presences in the neighborhood, as well as in adjacent areas to the south. To serve these two universities, several hotels are located nearby, including the Sheraton, located at 36th and Chestnut and The Inn at Penn is located between 36th & 37th Sts. on Samson St. In Powelton proper, there are even a couple of bed- and-breakfasts, including the Cornerstone at 33rd and Baring.

The system evolved during this period as new classes of aircraft came into use. The specific, official \\"name\\" of a Luftstreitkr√§fte aircraft type consisted of the name of the manufacturer, the designation allocated to its class or category, and finally a Roman numeral. Thus the first \\"D\\"-class aircraft built by Albatros was named the Albatros D.I, the second was the Albatros D.II and so on. Application A complication in identifying wartime German aircraft is that German manufacturers typically used their own designations; and sometimes gave experimental productions unofficial \\"Idflieg-style\\" class numbers, perhaps in the hope of production orders. The \\"Rs\\" (giant seaplane), and \\"CLs\\" (two-seater seaplane) designations of the Zeppelin-Lindau company are examples, as are the unofficial \\"Dr\\" designations of the experimental Euler triplanes, which remained prototypes and were never officially named.Gray & Thetford (1962), pp. 573‚Äì578, 330‚Äì332 The German Navy had a system for classification of aircraft types but did not use this, nor the Luftstreitkr√§fte system, to specify particular aircraft types, preferring to use manufacturers' designations.Nowarra (1966) Airships were outside either system, being individually numbered in the same way as German destroyers and submarines, mostly in the \\"L\\" series.Chant (2000), p. As well as serving to identify types, Idflieg class letters were normally included as part of German aircraft serial number markings. List of Idflieg class letter prefixes * A ‚Äì originally monoplane aircraft. \\"A\\" type aircraft (for example the Rumpler Taube and Fokker M.5) were at no stage limited by any official specification apart from their wing layout; in practice most \\"A\\" class aircraft were unarmed two seat reconnaissance or training aircraft. Exceptions were the single-seat Fokker \\"A\\" types that became the famous \\"E\\" class fighters when they were armed with synchronised machine guns. After 1915, the \\"A\\" class gradually became extinct, as examples reached obsolescence and were discarded. Later monoplanes were included in the \\"D\\", \\"C\\" or \\"CL\\" classes, with equivalent biplanes. * B ‚Äì originally all biplanes. Not connected to any official specification, apart from the wing layout. In practice, later types in the \\"B\\" class were all low powered unarmed two-seaters, mostly used for training and other second line duties. * C ‚Äì two-seat armed biplanes (designation introduced by April 1915). This was the first new designation to be introduced after the outbreak of war and the first to have a defining specification. To reduce the vulnerability of early German military aircraft to Allied types equipped with machine guns, \\"C\\" types were armed with a rearward firing machine gun operated by the observer and (later) a forward firing synchronised machine gun for the pilot. An engine of more than 150 hp was also specified (later \\"C\\" types typically had over 200 hp). A number of future German fighter aces obtained their first victories in a \\"C\\" type aircraftVan Wyngarden (2006) ** CL ‚Äì lightweight \\"C\\" class aircraft (designation introduced early 1917). Later \\"C\\" types became progressively larger ‚Äì the \\"CL\\" specification was intended to provide smaller aircraft, nimble enough to be used as escorts for the heavier \\"Cs\\": effectively two-seat fighters. In practice, the \\"CL\\" types were mainly used for close support. Engine power of a \\"CL\\" was limited to less than 200 hp ‚Äì and total loaded weight to under 360 kg. In other respects \\"CL\\" types were similar to \\"C\\"s ‚Äì in fact serial and type numbers generally fell in the same sequence.Cheesman (1960) p. 132 ** CN ‚Äì \\"C\\" class aircraft modified to carry a heavier bomb load for use at night. Designation replaced by \\"N\\". * D ‚Äì single-seat armed aircraft, specifically intended for use by the new jagdstaffeln or fighter squadrons (designation introduced in 1916). Until late in 1918, when the system was rationalised, \\"D\\" implied an armed doppeldecker, or biplane. By the end of the war all single-seat fighters were designated as \\"D\\" types, as distinctions based on wing layout were abandoned. ** DJ ‚Äì Armoured \\"D\\" class aircraft. The only type in this class was the prototype AEG DJ.I and the designation may not have been official. * Dr ‚Äì single-seat armed triplane, or Dreidecker (designation introduced in late 1917 ‚Äì abandoned in late 1918). The first two Fokker Dr.I service test aircraft were in fact called \\"F.I\\". By the end of the war all new single-seat fighters became \\"D\\" types, regardless of wing layout. * E ‚Äì armed monoplane (designation introduced in 1915 ‚Äì abandoned in late 1918), from Eindecker. This was initially simply the monoplane version of the \\"C\\" class armed biplane, having the same relationship to the \\"C\\" class as the \\"A\\" had to the \\"B\\", and several early \\"E\\" types were two-seaters. In practice, due largely to the success of the single seat Fokker \\"E\\" types, which were single-seat fighters, the \\"E\\" class came to mean a single-seat fighter monoplane (i.e. the monoplane equivalent of the \\"D\\" class). In late 1918 the last \\"E\\" type, the Fokker E.V was redesignated the \\"D.VIII\\", and other late war monoplane types (such as the Junkers CL.I) were also designated in their \\"functional\\" class, in line with the abandonment of designations based on wing layout. * F ‚Äì single-seat armed triplane (designation used briefly in 1917). Applied only to the Fokker F.I, which was redesignated the \\"Dr.I\\" by the time it went into production. * G ‚Äì armed twin-engined biplane bomber aircraft, originally bore the \\"K\\" (Kampfflugzeug - \\"battle aircraft\\", see below) designation at the war's start, became \\"G\\" (Gro√üflugzeug - \\"large aircraft\\") in 1915. ** GL ‚Äì faster twin- engined aircraft suitable for use as a day-bomber or long range reconnaissance (designation introduced in 1918). Bore a similar relationship to the \\"G\\" as the \\"CL\\" bore to the \\"C\\". Weight and wing span were reduced, and crew was limited to two ‚Äì the forward gunner‚Äôs cockpit being eliminated. * J ‚Äì armoured dual-roleCooling 1990 pp. 24‚Äì25 liaison aircraft and ground attack aircraft (designation introduced in 1917). Most examples resembled \\"C\\" types in general layout ‚Äì differing only in being fitted with armour to reduce vulnerability to ground fire. The exception to this was the Junkers J.I, designed specifically as an armoured aircraft. * K ‚Äì armed biplane bomber aircraft with two or three engines (Kampfflugzeug‚Äì\\"battle aircraft\\"). Designation introduced early in 1915, and replaced by \\"G\\" later that year. (see \\"G\\" types above) * L ‚Äì heavy bomber mid way between G and R classes. Applied only to the Siemens-Schuckert L.I, which never saw operational service. * N ‚Äì two-seat single engined night (Nacht) bomber. Basically a \\"C\\" type aircraft with longer wing span to enable a heavier war-load. Designation introduced in 1918, superseding \\"CN\\" specification. * R ‚Äì a large bomber aircraft with at least three, in some cases up to six engines (Riesenflugzeug‚Äì\\"giant aircraft\\"). An important distinguishing feature from the \\"G\\" class (apart from size) was that all engines should be accessible in flight to permit running repairs.Haddow & Grosz (1962) Post war The system ceased to apply with the end of German military aviation following the Armistice; in the nineteen twenties and thirties, although the Fokker company gave its new military types \\"Idflieg\\" style numbers, to continue war-time sequences. Fokker two seat military reconnaissance aircraft continued the wartime \\"C\\" series and Fokker single- seater fighters were given numbers in the \\"D\\" series to exploit the reputation of the wartime D.VII.

It was founded in 1842 by Methodist leaders and Central Ohio residents as a nonsectarian institution, and is a member of the Ohio Five ‚Äì a consortium of Ohio liberal arts colleges. Ohio Wesleyan has always admitted students irrespective of religion or race and maintained that the university \\"is forever to be conducted on the most liberal principles.\\"Alexander, William M. \\"Ohio Wesleyan University\\". Peabody Journal of Education, Vol. 38, No. 4 (Jan. 1961), pp. 200‚Äì203. The site is 27 miles (44 km) north of Columbus, Ohio. It includes the main academic and residential campus, the Perkins Observatory, and the Kraus Wilderness Preserve. In 2010, Ohio Wesleyan had the eleventh highest percentage of international students among liberal arts colleges for the seventeenth straight year.U.S. News & World Report (2010) In its 2015 edition of U.S. college rankings, Niche ranked Ohio Wesleyan the 56th (out of 880 colleges) most politically liberal college in the U.S. U.S. News & World Report ranked Ohio Wesleyan 95th among U.S. liberal arts colleges in its 2018 edition.  History  = Founding = The Sulphur Spring, renovated in 2005, was a major vacation spot for health seekers in the 1830s. In 1841, Ohio residents Adam Poe and Charles Elliott decided to establish a university \\"of the highest order\\" in central Ohio.Williams, p. 15. To that end, they purchased the Mansion House Hotel, a former health resort with its Sulphur Spring, using funds raised from local residents. Poe and Elliott wrote a charter emphasizing \\"the democratic spirit of teaching\\", which was approved by the Ohio State Legislature. Early in the following year they opened the college preparatory Academy and formed a Board of Trustees.Hubbart, p. 14. Ohio Wesleyan University, named (like several other U.S. colleges and universities) after John Wesley, founder of Methodism, opened on November 13, 1844 as a Methodist-related but nonsectarian institution, with a College of Liberal Arts for male students.White, p. 229. Ohio Wesleyan's first president, Edward Thomson, stated in his inaugural address on August 5, 1846 that the school was \\"a product of the liberality of the local people.\\"Hubbart, p. 22. This liberal philosophy contributed to Ohio Wesleyan's vocal opposition to slavery in the 1850s.Hubbart, p. 38. In the annual celebration for George Washington's birthday in 1862, second president Frederick Merrick endorsed Ohio Wesleyan's \\"ideals of democracy\\" during his oration. = Curriculum growth and fundraising = alt=leftthumb250x250pxElliott Hall, the first college building on campus, was renovated in 2000 and is Ohio's oldest collegiate Greek Revival building.

During the mid-19th century, Ohio Wesleyan focused on attracting students, adding fields of study, and fundraising, by which it significantly increased its endowment.Hubbart, p. 45. Sturges Hall was constructed as the University's first library in 1855. In 1873, the school added the Department of Natural History housed in Merrick Hall. The Ohio Wesleyan Female College, established in 1853, merged with the university in 1877.Taylor, p. 53. Between 1876 and 1888, enrollment tripled and music education greatly increased, yet no major buildings were built in this time.Hubbart, p. 68.Hubbart, pp. 72‚Äì80. An early baseball game at Edwards Field, with Edwards Gymnasium in the background. By the end of the 19th century, Ohio Wesleyan had added a School of Music (1877), School of Fine Arts (1877), School of Oratory (1894), and Business School (1895) to the original College of Liberal Arts (founded in 1844).Kukula, R. & K. Trubner (1923). Minerva: Jahrbuch der Gelehrten Welt. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter and Company To address the need for new departments and specialized instruction, the administration improved the facilities and courses to make them on par with OWU's new academic position. University Hall, Slocum Library, extensions to the Monnett campus, and athletic facilities were all constructed during that period.Hubbart, pp. 87‚Äì88. Between 1891 and 1895, Ohio Wesleyan specialized the curriculum by establishing departments for physics, zoology, geology, speech, history, French, English, and economics.Hubbart, p. 90. This specialization encouraged undergraduates to continue studies at graduate level, allowed professional preparation for the Doctor of Philosophy degree, and promoted exchange study in Europe. Two professional schools for law and medicine were formed in 1896. In 1905, the Board of Trustees decided to keep Ohio Wesleyan a college, despite the expansion of the curriculum and campus and the word \\"university\\" in the institution's name.Hubbart, p. 110. The Bachelor of Science degree was abolished, which left only the Bachelor of Arts. Two students were selected as Rhodes Scholars in 1905 and 1909.Hubbart, p. 112. Edwards Gymnasium was built in 1906. In 1907, the United Societies of Phi Beta Kappa, the oldest undergraduate honor society in the United States, installed the \\"Eta of Ohio\\" Œ¶ŒíŒö chapter on campus. In 1909, the school added Sanborn Hall, housing the Music Department. In the 1920s, academic requirements for the bachelor's degree were reduced, and Latin and mathematics were no longer emphasized.Hubbart, p. 142. During the presidency of John W. Hoffman (1916‚Äì1928), the Academy and School of Business were closed; the Academy had started in 1842 as a preparatory school, and throughout its seventy-five years frequently outnumbered the college in enrollment.Hubbart, p. 127. Also in the 1920s, the chapel service was dropped and sororities were formed. Ohio Wesleyan also increased the number of buildings on campus, including Selby Stadium, Austin Manor, and Perkins Observatory; another building, Stuyvesant Hall, was in planning; and Edgar Hall was opened.Hubbart, p. 141. = Years of change, 1930‚Äì1984 = Stuyvesant Hall, built in 1930, is the oldest residence in use on West Campus. A $14 million, donor-funded renovation of the facility was completed in September 2012. During the Great Depression, both enrollment and alumni donations shrank.Hubbart, pp. 140‚Äì160. While the faculty size remained stable, lack of tuition and alumni revenues precipitated financial problems which threatened the college's survival in the administrations of Edmund D. Soper (1928‚Äì1938), Acting President Edward Loranus Rice (1938‚Äì1939), and Herbert John Burgstahler (1939‚Äì1949).Tull, p. 180. The administration adjusted the curriculum during the early 1930s to address these problems.Hubbart, pp. 160‚Äì164. Greek and Latin declined, while business administration and economics thrived and the highest enrollments were in the social sciences, English, pre-medicine, and history. The registrar reported that, in these years, the number of students from New England states, urban Ohio areas, and from international locations increased. By the 1930s, the Methodist students were a minority among the student body;Burtchaell, pp. 174‚Äì175; formal ties to the Methodist church were severed in the 1920sBurtchaell, pp. 304‚Äì319. and led to debate among Board members in the 1930s, eventually resulting in the university's current active but loose historical affiliation with the United Methodist Church.Burtchaell, p. 323. In a study into the relationship between American educational institutions and the Christian denominations they were historically affiliated with, James Tunstead Burtuchell writes that it was during this period that \\"in its personnel, its resources, and its students\\", Ohio Wesleyan lost its \\"symbiotic intimacy with the United Methodist Church.\\"Burtchaell, p. 326. In 1946, Ohio Wesleyan introduced a new \\"Centennial Curriculum\\", which enacted seven distribution requirements across the sciences and humanities; the new requirement for a foreign language course was added to the existing humanities requirement.Tull, p. 182. Thomson and Bashford Halls, originally men's dorms, were built between 1951 and 1954. In the 1960s, faculty, staff and administrators fought over administrative structure and control.Tull, pp. 182‚Äì183. They eventually settled on a new \\"statement of aims\\" that stressed values, rather than religious goal statements, and instituted a more internationalized curriculum, a new Women's Studies Program, and an International Business major; the faculty senate also introduced a new academic calendar with three 10.5-week terms.Tull, p. 183 Thomas Wenzlau's presidency (1968‚Äì1984) began with the challenge of campus unrest: Ohio Wesleyan students took over the ROTC building, demanded its shut-down, and eventually eliminated ROTC in 1970.Murchland, p. 34Murchland, p. 74. Students also demanded participation in departmental meetings and faculty committees, and the democratic process in the governance of Ohio Wesleyan grew in this period.Murchland, p. 35 Wenzlau's presidency witnessed decline in students' test scores, an unusually high attrition rate, lack of adequate research to identify potential major donors and a growing \\"party school\\" image,Murchland, pp. 38‚Äì39 leading to a rocky relationship between him and the student body.Murchland, p. 39 Between 1979 and 1982, the campus newspaper The Transcript frequently criticized Wenzlau's presidency, blaming it for \\"severely affecting the reputation of the college\\".Murchland, p. 41 This exchange resulted in a Washington Post report on the school that eventually precipitated the end of Wenzlau's presidency.Peterson, Bill. \\"Enrollments Lower, Costs Higher\\". The Washington Post, December 19, 1982, First Section, A5. = 1984-today = The president, David Warren, increased admission standards in 1985, engaged students in a \\"live-in\\" presidency, expanded media exposure and established a National Colloquium focused on the liberal arts. Warren engaged in forty-one interviews on the ABC and NBC networks.Murchland, pp. 44‚Äì45 More recently, Ohio Wesleyan has achieved several academic and athletic recognitions. A 1986 study, titled \\"Educating America's Scientists: The Role of the Research Colleges,\\" identified Ohio Wesleyan as one of 48 highly selective \\"science-active\\" liberal arts institutions in the nation.Educating America's Scientists: The Role of the Research Colleges.

Despite these efforts, Ohio Wesleyan is one of many liberal arts colleges in the United States that is experiencing declining enrollment. The 2017 incoming class was 9% smaller than the year before. Ohio Wesleyan continues to undertake construction projects. The Hamilton-Williams Campus Center opened in 1991. The Memorial Union Building was renovated in 2001 to accommodate the Economics Department, the Academic Resource Center, the Information Services portion of the combined Libraries and Information Services department, and the Woltemade Center for Economics, Business and Entrepreneurship.

In 2018, the University opened the Delaware Entrepreneurial Center at OWU in collaboration with the City of Delaware and Delaware County. In 2019, Ohio Wesleyan announced an ambitious Residential Renewal project, committing $60M to renovating existing buildings and the construction of a new village of apartments.  Academics  = Profile = Ohio Wesleyan President with students at the Columbus LGBT Pride Festival 2013. Ohio Wesleyan University is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission, and is a member of the Great Lakes Colleges Association, the Oberlin Group, and the Five Colleges of Ohio, a consortium of Ohio liberal arts colleges which also includes Kenyon College, Oberlin College, The College of Wooster, and Denison University. For 2011, Ohio Wesleyan accepted approximately 52% of its regular decision applicants, 33% of its transfer applicants, and had a yield rate of 26%. In 2010, the college accepted 36% of its international applicants. The middle 50% range of matriculating students for the class of 2010 was 1125‚Äì1320 for the SAT (old scale) and 24‚Äì30 for the ACT. Approximately 35% of accepted applicants were granted internal scholarships. Ohio Wesleyan follows a need-blind admission policy; financial circumstances are not considered when deciding whether to admit applicants. As of 2010, OWU's 1,950 students come from 43 states and 57 countries; 47% are from Ohio, 11% are international, and 54% are female. The student body is about 10% Asian, 6% Hispanic, and 9% Black. Fifty-nine percent of Ohio Wesleyan students claim no religious affiliation. The student-faculty ratio is 11:1 and faculty members teach all classes. Excluding independent studies and senior theses, nearly 60% of Ohio Wesleyan's class sections have fewer than twenty students enrolled. Ohio Wesleyan is generally known for a strong \\"left- leaning\\" student body and an administration with a \\"permissive\\" attitude. In 2007, 60% of OWU students favored the Democratic Party.Calhoon, Elisabeth. The Transcript (November 10, 2004). Retrieved on August 10, 2006; and ; and ; and In its 2015 edition of U.S. college rankings, Niche (company) ranked Ohio Wesleyan 56th (out of 880 colleges) most politically liberal college in the U.S. Ohio Wesleyan admits students of all cultures, lifestyles, and socio- economic backgrounds. An index examining gay-friendly policies places OWU among the nation's gay-friendly colleges,Windmeyer, pp. 5‚Äì100. and the university enacts policies to meet the six criteria developed by the Campus- Pride organization for recruiting and supporting students from a lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, and transgender population.   Nearly 18% of students at Ohio Wesleyan receive Federal Pell Grants, which mostly go to students whose family incomes are below $40,000. This measure indicates the degree to which economically disadvantaged groups are represented at OWU.  * The faculty consists of 142 tenured members. As of 2010, all the university's tenured or tenure-track faculty members hold a PhD or other terminal degree. The faculty is 37% female and 63% male, with 10% from underrepresented groups. Also as of 2006, women constitute 37% of the tenured professors and earn 94% of what male professors earn ‚Äì numbers which suggest favorable gender circumstances. = Curriculum, degrees and majors = Freshmen are paired early in their first year with academic advisors who oversee their students' academic progress. Upon completing 34 units of coursework, students may earn diplomas in Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, or Bachelor of Music. Ohio Wesleyan has research departments and teaching faculties in most academic disciplines; as of 2019, OWU offered nearly 90 majors. In its early days, OWU's curriculum began with classical studies, for the course catalogue maintained that \\"the classical course in Greek and Latin and pure mathematics bring correctness in mental processes that an applied art, or a living and slightly inflected language, do not permit.\\"Hubbart, p. 88. Scientific courses were added to Ohio Wesleyan's curriculum in 1849, and since then, scientific subjects have become a foundation to the liberal arts curriculum.Tull, p. 48. OWU also has a highly respected music department. = Emphasis on internationalism = Flags in University Hall of students' countries represented at Ohio Wesleyan University. Ohio Wesleyan has upheld academic internationalism since its early years; since the 19th century, the college has established links with several international schools. In 1879, OWU alumna Elizabeth Russell founded Kwassui Women's College in Nagasaki, Japan, when predominant Japanese culture considered women's education unimportant. Today, Kwassui College is one of the top finishing schools for young women in Japan. In 1899, William Ehnis (from the class of 1898) traveled to Africa and opened a school in Mutare, Zimbabwe, that eventually became the Africa University. Ada M. Coe was an early woman Spanish Professor here in 1917. The school also manifests international interest in the percentage of international students it recruits and enrolls annually. Since 1983, Ohio Wesleyan has been listed in U.S. News & World Report among colleges that attract the highest percentage of international students. The percentage of international students grew in the early and mid-1990s.Desruisseaux, Paul. Chronicle of Higher Education, 12/10/99, Vol. 46 Issue 16, pA57, 5p, Ohio Wesleyan University.

Chronicle of Higher Education, November 17, 2000, Vol. 47 Issue 12, pA76, 1p, Ohio Wesleyan University. In a study adjusted for school size, Ohio Wesleyan came ninth among 118 American colleges and universities in total aid awards to international students and 69th in average award per international student among both large universities and small liberal arts colleges. South East Asian students have significantly contributed to this growth. The United Nations flag, along with the flags of more than sixty represented nations and the U.S. flag, flies in University Hall in honor of the ideal of peaceful international relations. High participation in formal exchange programs constitutes a third target of the school's international focus.Tull, p. 140. Under a Great Lakes Colleges Association agreement, OWU established an exchange program with Waseda University in 1962 to provide approximately 30 American students with opportunities to study in Japan and 30 Japanese students to study at Ohio Wesleyan each year. The Salamanca program, founded by Conrad Kent in 1988, conducts the exchange of approximately one hundred students and faculty between OWU and the University of Salamanca in Spain. The academic collaboration frequently extends to joint participation in academic symposia: in 1993, members of the Salamanca faculty participated in a symposium on the Golden Age in Salamanca. = Libraries = The Beeghly Library is the main library of OWU. The library contains nearly 500,000 volumes in its collection, and is also home to the Archives of Ohio United Methodism, the Rare Books, Manuscripts, and Artifacts collection, as well as an archival collection of materials related to the history of the university. The Hobson Science Library is part of the Schimmel Conrades Science Center and supports research in the earth, life, and physical sciences.https://library.owu.edu/about OWU has 11 full-time librarians, with subject liaisons for each academic department, as well as a full-time archivist.https://library.owu.edu/staff-directory/az  Campus  The Ohio Wesleyan campus is next to downtown Delaware, and is bisected by Sandusky Street, the main north/south street through the heart of the city. The street informally divides the campus into an eastern sector composed mainly of academic buildings and a western sector composed mainly of residential and administrative buildings. Many facilities have been constructed in the last two years, with substantial benefit to science, art, and athletic programs on campus. = Other facilities and off-campus programs = OWU operates several facilities outside campus: The Philadelphia Business Center, Wesleyan in Washington, The New York Arts Program for the performing, visual, and media arts (a GLCA arts program), Perkins Observatory, The Strand Theatre, and the Kraus Wilderness Preserve. Perkins Observatory is situated in Delaware on land separate to the main campus. The observatory is named after Hiram Perkins, a former professor of mathematics and astronomy at the college. When the observatory was built in 1931, it housed the third-largest telescope in the world, which has since been moved to Arizona. The Perkins dome now houses a telescope, which is the second-largest in Ohio. The university also maintains offices for study abroad, US domestic study, and internship programs. Such programs include: Wesleyan in Washington, which allows students to study for a semester in Washington, D.C., in research and internship positions. The Philadelphia Center offers students hundreds of internship and field placement opportunities off-campus and the chance to live independently. and the New York Arts Program, which allows students of the arts to gain a semester of hands on experience in the arts in New York City. = Community relations = OWU has strong community ties with the City of Delaware. Students participate in Delaware's community through a variety of educational, social, and cultural programs. The student-led Columbus Initiative, founded in 1989, is an experiential learning partnership between OWU and Columbus public schools. More than 150 Ohio Wesleyan students from this program tutor and mentor underprivileged pupils from Columbus. The Ohio Wesleyan Ambassadors Program (ISAP) promotes cultural diversity and ethnic awareness within the local community, and exposes international students to American culture through the community. The program's ambassadors visit local schools to give presentations and participate in events for local non-profit community organizations. Campus organizations cooperate with local residents on issues of civic engagement and activism. Progress OWU allows students from Ohio Wesleyan and local schools to express their voices on politics, public policy, and corporate and social issues, both on campus and in the local community. Cultural programs also take part in community relations. In the 1960s, Ohio Wesleyan donated the Arts Castle, then part of the Fine Arts department, to the City of Delaware. It is now home to the Delaware County Cultural Arts Center. The Arts Castle hosts a variety of community programs in art, and offers classes ranging from ballet to fine arts. In 2004, the OWU received a donation to rehabilitate the historic Strand Theatre in downtown Delaware. The university and the City of Delaware sponsor several events in town throughout the year: the Delaware Arts Festival, the Little Brown Jug, the Delaware County Fair, and the Castle Arts Affair. The Delaware Arts Festival is an annual event held the weekend after Mother's Day on the streets of Historic Downtown Delaware. The festival hosts over 170 booths featuring works of local, regional, and other artists. OWU professors chair the committees that select winners. The Little Brown Jug, a harness race, is run during the Delaware County Fair in September. The OWU president and the college mascot traditionally award the trophy for the first division of the first heat of the race.  Student life  = Organizations and activities = The Hamilton- Williams Campus Center is the campus hub for student activities. Ohio Wesleyan University has 95 student clubs and organizations. The university offers three chapels as well as several Christian and other religious groups for its students. Its social organizations cover a wide range of interests, including chess, ultimate, finance, and medieval sword fighting. There are two a cappella singing groups on campus, \\"The OWtsiders,\\" a student-run group formed in 1999, and the all-female \\"Pitch Black\\" established in 2005. Another entertainment-related club is \\"The Babbling Bishops\\", an improvisational comedy troupe. The \\"Babbling Bishops\\" started in the fall of 1990 when a group of theatre concentration students formed a performance-oriented project for their theatre degrees. The project became an improv comedy troupe, rehearsing in Stuyvesant Hall and performing with other college improv troupes since 1996. Socially conscious students can join organizations such as the activist group \\"Young Democratic Socialists\\" or participate in student government groups, such as the Campus Programming Board and the Wesleyan Council on Student Affairs. The \\"PRIDE\\" organization offers support to OWU's LGBT students. Fewer than a third of Ohio Wesleyan's students are involved in Greek life, but that percentage has fluctuated significantly throughout the university's history. All six fraternities and five sororities on campus are currently involved in many philanthropic and community programs. Ohio Wesleyan has four religious chaplains: A Protestant minister, a Roman Catholic priest, and a Jewish rabbi. In addition to student groups and services associated with these three religions, there are groups associated with Islam, Buddhism and Unitarian Universalism, and even a group which holds services that are simply \\"spiritual\\" and separate from any organized religion. Services are also available for Quakers, Christian Scientists, Hindus, and Bah√° º√≠s, and there are many local religious groups in Delaware, Ohio. OWU's oldest student organizations are its literary clubs, including a number of student journals, magazines, and newspapers. The school's student-run weekly newspaper, The Transcript, is the oldest continuously published, independent, college newspaper in the United States. The OWL, an annual literary publication, features students' work and is one of the nation's oldest college literary magazines. Other student publications include The Civic Arts Review, the electronic Connect2OWU bulletin, and @Wesleyan, a quarterly online magazine. OWU Radio, formerly WSLN, broadcasts from Phillips Hall, and offers show times to students, faculty, and local citizens of Delaware. The university also has a student government, the Wesleyan Council on Student Affairs (WCSA). = Activism = OWU students make a social and artistic statement on the steps of the Hamilton-Williams Campus Center. Activism as represented in OWU's founding vision has had a significant role in Ohio Wesleyan's history.Hubbart, p. 10.Tull, p. 132. The first president, Edward Thomson, staunchly supported the abolition of slavery and liberalism. Other individuals associated with the university have fought racism. Branch Rickey, an alumnus, broke the racial barrier in baseball. Mary King, a civil rights activist, worked alongside Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the U.S. civil rights movement while she was a staff member of OWU's Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).Anderson, p. 57. In the 1980s, Ohio Wesleyan's administration, moved by student activism, pledged and eventually fully divested holdings connected to South Africa.Vellela, pp. 20‚Äì21.Tull, pp. 142‚Äì143. As of September 2007, Ohio Wesleyan joined a small group of liberal colleges that actively opposed the methodology and usefulness of U.S. News & World Report college rankings, despite the fact that the magazine ranked Ohio Wesleyan among the top national liberal arts colleges. Ohio Wesleyan's concern intensified with disclosures about institutions flagrantly manipulating data in order to move up in the rankings in U.S. News and other popular college guides. OWU has partisan political groups ranging from liberal to conservative, such the College Republicans and the College Democrats, and several activism awareness groups such as Black Men of the Future, Black Student Union (formerly Student Union on Black Awareness), PRIDE, Viva Latinx, and Rafiki Wa Afrika. Due to the school's proximity to Columbus, the Ohio state capital, many politically inclined students serve internships for state representatives. In the 2000s, students have been active on the Iraq War, race, globalization, and women's reproductive rights. * Wood, Allison. The Transcript (March 31, 2005).

Monnett Weekend, beginning in 1896, welcomes female alumni, parents, and friends of the university. Events include a \\"People's Parade\\" with clowns, banners and marching, faculty lectures, Maypole dancing, Choral Arts Society, and an all- campus carnival.Murchland, p. 79.Hubbart, p. 121. It started as a girls' athletic f√™te held at the Monnett Athletic Club for Mothers Day. All events were held at the Monnett Campus, where female students danced around the Maypole, while men were barred. The men, in turn, developed their own tradition: they arrived at Monnett Campus early in the morning, and concealed themselves in trees to watch the festivities, discreetly.Tull, p. 102. In 1884, Ohio Wesleyan held its first Mock Convention, which has recurred in every United States presidential election year since 1920. Its purpose is to inform participants, students, faculty staff, and Ohio residents about the presidential nominating convention, presidential candidate, and key issues in the upcoming election. Beginning in the 1920s, all freshmen were required to wear \\"dinks\\", red caps with black brims and a black W on the front.Tull, pp. 98‚Äì99. Disobedient students who refused to wear the \\"dink\\" were tossed into the Sulphur Spring (see later reference). This tradition ended in the 1960s. The freshman class of 1957 wore dinks for half the first semester.Murchland, p. 64. Ohio Wesleyan's Homecoming takes place in early October, while the Ohio Wesleyan football team plays one of its traditional rivals. New events, such as a bonfire and a five kilometer run, have been added from as recently as 2004. The President's Ball, a recent gala organized by the college president, takes place on the first Saturday of December. Other traditions include OWU vs. Denison, which stages a \\"fierce\\" athletic rivalry between Ohio Wesleyan and Denison University; the Sagan Colloquium, spanning the fall semester, recently expanded to include the spring semester, which consists of speeches focusing on an issue of concern to the liberal arts; and Orchesis, an annual celebration of modern dance and the arts, which occurs at the end of the academic year. \\"Fresh-X\\" is an optional program for newly admitted students that occurs just before orientation in which students may choose between hiking, backpacking and other outdoor activities to make friends with their new classmates. The campus used to host two major musical events, Unity through Music and Springfest. Unity through Music occurred once a year in the fall semester, and covered various musical styles in a carnival atmosphere, during the day; while, during the evening, a huge dance is held in the Hamilton-Williams Campus Center. Springfest, the second musical event, proceeded in mid-April and had featured well-known music groups such as Counting Crows, The Roots, Guster, Ben Folds, and Gym Class Heroes. It was organized by the Campus Programming Board, who have changed the name to \\"Bishop Bash,\\" in an attempt to create more campus pride. Bishop Bash has hosted multiple different styled events, including Drake Bell, Bo Burnham, and most recently, in 2017, The Mowgli's and NeverShoutNever. A rock next to Hayes Hall has been part of the residential campus for the last 50 years, and students continually repaint it with graffiti and slogans. = Housing = The House of Peace and Justice, a Small Living Unit on West Campus. The university can house up to 1,600 students on campus. First-year students are required to live on campus during their first two semesters. A lottery system matches second to fourth-year students with dormitories and another lottery system determines how many students are allowed to live in off-campus housing. Housing options include dormitories, small living units, fraternities, and cooperative housing. Thomson, Bashford, Stuyvesant, and Smith Halls are large mid-rise dormitories on campus. Welch Hall is designated as a \\"quiet\\" dorm for honors students. Hayes Hall is an all-female dorm. Students converse on the back porch of The House of Peace and Justice, a Small Living Unit on West Campus. Approximately 90 non-freshmen students live in Small Living Units (SLUs), which are co-ops united voluntarily to meet shared economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations in democratically controlled houses. The houses allow students to live cooperatively with one another by sharing regularly scheduled house chores, participating in the decision process, and, in some, sharing the cooking duties. Each unit houses a group of 10‚Äì17 students, and is organized to promote a common theme, usually indicated by the co-op's name. As of the 2017‚Äì2018 academic year, the SLUs consist of The Peace and Justice House, The Citizens of the World House, The Sexuality and Gender Equality House, The House of Linguistic Diversity, The House of Spiritual Athletes, The Tree House, and The Interfaith House. The University owns these houses; the co-ops, therefore, must follow the University's living policies. The co-ops do, however, elect their own members and do not have resident advisers or faculty in residence like other on-campus residence halls. They have a House Moderator who is selected by Residential Life and undergoes the same training as a resident advisor. At the end of each calendar year, every existing and potential co-op must submit a house proposal describing its plans for theme promotion for the next academic year. The University Housing office places co-ops in houses every year on a competitive basis. In addition the school offers Theme Houses, which do not have to go through the renewal process. They include the Honors House (HoHo) and House of Black Culture. Off- campus housing is available only to students residing in Delaware, Ohio while living with their spouse or direct family; 17 percent of students live off- campus. Most students assert Ohio Wesleyan's policy of off-campus housing as one of the \\"worst things\\" about Ohio Wesleyan.  Athletics  Selby Field, home to football, lacrosse, and field hockey. Ohio Wesleyan participates in the NCAA's Division III as a member of the North Coast Athletic Conference (NCAC). Known as the Battling Bishops, Ohio Wesleyan competes in 25 varsity men's and women's sports. The newest sports, men's wrestling and women's rowing, begin competition during the 2018‚Äì2019 academic year. The official school colors are red and black. Formal athletics at the college date to 1875, when the first football teams were organized to play against other institutions. In the late 1880s, Ohio Wesleyan had perhaps the strongest amateur baseball team in the state of Ohio behind the pitching of Phil \\"Lefty\\" Saylor. The school joined the Ohio Athletic Conference along with Oberlin College, Kenyon College, Ohio State, and Case Western in 1902. In 1983, Ohio Wesleyan joined with nine other colleges in Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania to create the North Coast Athletic Conference. The NCAC seeks to bring together a group of liberal arts institutions that value the primacy of the academic mission over the athletic one. Massa, Robert J. \\"College Athletics: The Tail Wagging the Dog?\\" College News (June 24, 2003). Retrieved on June 21, 2006. The men's lacrosse, golf and soccer teams are the most historically successful of the varsity teams, and soccer is the university's most intently followed sport. For seven of the last twelve years, Ohio Wesleyan has won the NCAC conference All-Sports Trophy for excellence in both women's and men's sports. In the Sears Director's Cup standings, OWU is among the top 25 overall collegiate athletics programs in the country. Because of the North Coast Athletic Association athletic agreement, the university is not permitted to offer academic scholarships for athletic recruiting. Ohio Wesleyan has won five NCAA Division III Championships, including men's basketball (1988), men's soccer (1998 and 2011), and women's soccer (2001 and 2002). In addition, Ohio Wesleyan's varsity athletic teams have been NCAC champions over 100 times, leading the teams of Denison University and Kenyon College. The nickname The Battling Bishops dates to 1925. This is also the name of the university's mascot, The Battling Bishop. Due to its ironic name, the mascot has been listed as one of the weirdest college mascots. Due to its red robe, The Battling Bishop looks actually like a Cardinal. Before 1925, Ohio Wesleyan's teams were referred to as \\"The Red and Black\\" and \\"The Methodists\\". Many schools, including several other Methodist ones, also claimed crimson and black as their colors, so the university decided to change the name. The men's lacrosse team at Selby Field. Ohio Wesleyan maintains athletic rivalries with other NCAC institutions. The men's lacrosse team has a historic rivalry with Denison University, the football team with Wittenberg University, the soccer team with Kenyon College, and the field hockey team with Oberlin College. Both Denison and Ohio Wesleyan issued alerts to their fans specifically for the OWU-Denison lacrosse game about unsportsmanlike behavior and profanity. In addition to the school's varsity athletics, club sports teams, including ultimate frisbee, chess, hockey, cricket, rugby, ski, and scuba, have been organized as student organizations under the auspices of the Office of Student Activities. Ohio Wesleyan's intramural program includes 16 sports. Sports such as skiing, squash and water polo have been offered, as well as a sports trivia competition. \\"Oh we're from dear old Wesleyan\\" is Ohio Wesleyan University's primary fight song. The song's lyrics were written in 1914 by Chass Cupett '1916.  People  = Administration = Under the charter granted by the State of Ohio, the Board of Trustees possesses the legal authority to operate the college. The charter and bylaws stipulate a board of 34 trustees, of whom one is the president. In general, it is the board that elects the president. Since Ohio Wesleyan's beginnings, sixteen people have held the title of president, and a few have served as interim president. Former presidents include lawyers, literary scholars, politicians, executives, and clergymen.Tull, pp. 26‚Äì29.

The events and associations with significant alumni involvement are Homecoming, 'W' Association, and A/PART (the alumni admission team). For the 2005‚Äì2006 fiscal year, Ohio Wesleyan's alumni giving rate was 35%. A number of the school's alumni have made notable contributions in the fields of government, law, academia, business, arts, journalism, and athletics, among others. In academia, Frank Sherwood Rowland (class of 1948) won the 1995 Nobel Prize for chemistry for his research on the depletion of the Earth's ozone layer.

This car was developed by Ferrari engineers in the late 1950s as a less expensive, compact alternative to existing Ferrari GT cars. ASA used inline-four and straight-six engines derived from the \\"250\\" 3-litre V12 designed by Gioacchino Colombo. The chassis was developed by Giotto Bizzarrini and was derived from the tubular frame chassis of the 250 GTO. The prototype that would become the ASA 1000 GT was first presented by Carrozzeria Bertone (Geneva 1961) under the name \\"Mille\\". Following this debut in late 1961, Enzo Ferrari decided to not sell the new car as a Ferrari and entrusted production to a close friend, Oronzio de Nora. The car was manufactured in Milan by a newly formed company called ASA (owned by the De Nora Electrochemical Group) from 1964 to 1969. The 1000 GT model was officially introduced in 1962, but due to production difficulties series production did not begin until 1964.  ASA 1000 GT  = Design and development by Ferrari = The ASA 1000 GT originated in a late 1950s experimental project by Ferrari engineers to create a less expensive, compact alternative to existing Ferrari GT cars. This project was designated \\"854\\" by the factory (for 850cc, 4 cylinders), however it was commonly but unofficially named \\"Ferrarina,\\" meaning \\"Little Ferrari.\\" The \\"Ferrarina\\" engine was derived from a late 1950s experimental inline-4, designated Tipo 122. This was basically a four-cylinder, slice of a Colombo V12 from a Ferrari 212, with a bore and stroke of 65 x 64mm and supplied by two Weber 38DCO carburetors. The Tipo 122 engine produced at 7000 rpm. The Tipo 122 was followed by the more powerful and slightly higher displacement Tipo 125 and 126 engines. The Tipo 126 engine displaced 973 cc and produced at 7000 rpm. These engines were tested in the \\"Ferrarina\\" prototype, a 2-door notchback coupe on a Fiat 1100 or 1200 chassis with a Pininfarina body, which was used by Enzo Ferrari as his personal transportation for some time in the late 1950s. The final engine design was completed in 1960 as the Tipo 141, with 1032cc displacement, bore and stroke of 69 mm x 69 mm, a single overhead cam and two Weber 38DCOA carburetors. According to Ferrari's records, this engine produced at 7200 rpm with a 9:1 compression ratio. Following Ferrari's development work on the 854/\\"Ferrarina\\" prototype, a new prototype called the \\"Mille\\" (\\"one thousand\\" in Italian) was shown at the 1961 Turin Auto Show on the Bertone stand. The Mille was an entirely new car based on the 854 project, with 2-door fastback coup√© bodywork designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro at Bertone. Although this prototype had no Ferrari badging, its design echoed contemporary Ferrari GT models and the origin of the design within Ferrari was well publicized. Despite positive publicity and official support of the project from Ferrari, at the time of the Mille's debut there were no plans for Ferrari to mass-produce the design. Ferrari engineers had planned around annual production of 3000-5000 cars, which would sell for approximately US$2600 each. Not only was the Ferrari factory inadequate for this kind of volume production, Enzo Ferrari was unwilling to expand it in order to produce the Mille. Even before the Turin debut of the Mille, Ferrari had begun searching for another company that would buy the design and bring it to market. = Formation of ASA and 1000 GT production = ASA 1000 GT rear view ASA head of operations Niccol√≤ de Nora (kneeling) and Giotto Bizzarrini (right) inspecting an ASA 1000 GTC alongside ASA staff By 1962, Enzo Ferrari decided to entrust production of the Ferrarina to close friend Oronzio de Nora and his son, Niccol√≤ de Nora. The de Nora Electrochemical Group formed a new company for this purpose under the name ASA (Autocostruzioni Societ√† per Azioni). ASA operations were headed by Niccol√≤ de Nora. Also involved in ASA management were race drivers Lorenzo Bandini, Gerino Gerini, and Giancarlo Baghetti and engineer Giotto Bizzarrini. The new firm had its headquarters on via San Faustino in Milan. The ASA 1000 GT production version, almost unchanged from the \\"Mille\\" prototype, was officially introduced at the 1962 Turin Auto Show. Despite this debut, due to production difficulties series production of the 1000 GT did not begin until 1964. The production 1000 GT used the 1032cc Tipo 141 I4 engine fitted with 40DCOE9 carburetors. It produced a stated at 6800 rpm, a HP/Litre ratio better than the contemporary Ferrari 275 GTB. Other sources report an output of at 7000 rpm. Production cars used a tubular spaceframe chassis designed by Giotto Bizzarrini, based on the 250 GTO. It was equipped with double wishbone front suspension and a live axle at the rear. Both front and rear of the car were equipped with coil springs, tubular dampers, an anti-roll bar and disk brakes. The coupe was bodied in steel with aluminum hood and trunk lids and weighed dry. Autocar magazine tested the 1000 GT shortly after its introduction and recorded a 0-60 mph time of 14.0 seconds and a 1/4 mile run in 19.3 seconds. At least two fiberglass-bodied convertibles were also produced. One of the convertibles was displayed at the 1962 Turin auto show alongside the coupe. Other than the fiberglass body, the convertible was mechanically identical to the 1000 GT coupe. = Commercial reception = The first production ASA 1000 GT couple was sold for $5920 in September 1964. Luigi Chinetti was the sole US importer of ASA and a majority of the 1000 GT production was sent to his dealership. Despite reportedly excellent driving dynamics and reliability, 1000 GT sales were low. The brand had little name recognition and Chinetti's American customers in particular preferred the much more powerful Ferraris. Additionally, the 1000 GT was extremely expensive for the performance offered, with retail prices around US$6000 when a new Chevrolet Corvette equipped with a much more powerful 427 c.i. V8 engine cost US$4500. In order to sell their stock of ASAs, Chinetti's dealership steadily lowered prices during the late 1960s and early 1970s. A new 1000 GT sold for $1800 in 1973, far below cost. ASA production never achieved the anticipated volume of 3000-5000 cars per year. Even when series production was fully operational during 1964 and 1965, only one car was built per week. Exact production figures are unknown, but sources agree that less than 100 ASA cars of all types were constructed. One source estimates that 50-75 1000 GTs were produced in total between 1964 and 1967, with an additional handful of convertibles and competition cars. The ASA factory officially closed in 1967, but some cars were assembled from spare parts and sold as new up through the early 1970s.  Competition cars  ASA 1000 GTC ASA Berlinetta 411 during 1966 Targa Florio The ASA 1000 GTC was a sports racing car built in 1963 by Giotto Bizzarrini and based on a production 1000 GT. The car was developed under a newly-founded Societ√† Autostar workshop. The body was designed and built by Piero Drogo's Carrozzeria Sports Cars. The engine had its displacement reduced to 995 cc to meet the under 1.0-litre racing classification. The tubular chassis with aluminium body saved the weight to a total of . Bizzarrini and Drogo also built a larger displacement car called 1300 GTC with 1.3-litre engine that debuted at the 1966 Trento- Bondone Hill Climb. The ASA Berlinetta 411 was the competition version of the 1000 GT Coup√©, introduced at the 1965 Paris Motor Show. It used the engine from the 1000 GT enlarged to by increasing the cylinder bore from 69 to 71 mm. This engine produced at 7500 rpm. The Berlinetta 411 had a lightweight all- aluminum body and plexiglass windows, resulting in a dry weight of compared to the regular 1000 GT's . Other modifications included wider tires and a competition gas filler. The exact number produced is unknown. Two competition 1000 GTs were entered in the 1965 Targa Florio. They placed 17th and 22nd overall, 3rd and 4th place in the 1000-1600cc prototype class. ASA also manufactured four fiberglass-bodied competition cars called the RB613 or Roll Bar 1300. These featured a more aerodynamic body designed by Luigi Chinetti Jr. and manufactured by Carrozzeria Corbetta. The chassis had an integrated roll bar, the source of the \\"RB\\" abbreviation in the name. The engine was a 1.3 liter straight-six, the design based on 1/2 of the Ferrari 250 V12. Two ASA RB613s were raced at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans, one an ASA factory entry and one entered by Luigi Chinetti's North American Racing Team. Neither car finished the race. NART entered another RB613 in the 1967 Daytona 24 Hours. Driven by Suzy Dietrich and Donna Mae Mims, the ASA finished 24th. The same driver team again drove the ASA for NART in the 1967 Sebring 12 Hours, finishing 25th. A similar 1.8 liter 4-cylinder RB618 or Roll Bar 1800 competition model was developed for the American market. The quantity produced and racing history of this model is unknown.

The first car was built in 1959 and subsequently modified by the designer in 1961. Only one was ever built. Background \\"Asardo\\" is an acronym for \\"American Special Automotive Research and Design Organization\\". The company's founder and chief designer was mechanical engineer Helmut Schlosser, an Austrian who had emigrated to the United States. In the late 1950s he was managing a machine shop in North Bergen, New Jersey. Schlosser was interested in sports cars, at one time owning a Siata with a Stanguellini engine. Schlosser had completed the design for what would become the Asardo by 1957, and construction began in 1958. 1500 AR-S For the Asardo 1500 AR-S Schlosser produced a compact curvaceous berlinetta body in fiberglass. The appearance of the front of the car has been compared to the Maserati 300S and the rear to some Ferraris. The car's gullwing doors were reminiscent of the Mercedes-Benz 300SL and in fact used Mercedes hinges and latches with a custom hold-up strut. The dashboard was from a Volkswagen Karmann Ghia as was the windshield, which was cut to fit. The bucket seats were from a Porsche Speedster. The electrical accessories were courtesy of Lucas. The chassis was a multi-tubular space frame. The front suspension used upper and lower A-arms from the Alfa Romeo Giulietta, coil springs and an anti-roll bar. The rear suspension also used many Giulietta parts, with a solid axle and alloy Alfa differential carrier on coil springs with trailing arms and an A-arm for lateral location. Koni telescopic shock-absorbers were used all four corners, as were Borrani wire wheels with knock-off spinners. Brakes were Girling/Alfa Romeo drums front and Alfin drums rear. Steering was the ZF-Gemmer worm-and-ball system used in the Alfas. The engine in the Asardo 1500 AR-S was the Alfa Romeo Twin Cam inline- four engine. In the Giulietta this engine displaced but for the Asardo its bore was increased from 74 mm to 79.5 mm with custom pistons and wet liners from Mahle so that its final displacement was . The Asardo's engine had a compression ratio of 11.5:1 and was equipped with two two-barrel Weber 40mm DCOE3 carburetors. Power output for the engine was estimated to have been at 6800 rpm. Power went from the engine to the rear axle through an Alfa Romeo four-speed manual transmission. The car was taken to the Lime Rock track, where driver Dolph Vilardi recorded lap times of 1 minute 16 seconds even though the engine mixture was too lean and only three-quarter throttle was used. Top speed was estimated to be . The Asardo debuted at the 1959 New York auto show. It was listed at a suggested price of US$5875.00 and was to be built at a rate of two cars per month in a new production facility in Weehawken, New Jersey. Schlosser and his financial backers disagreed about how the car would be sold. The financiers wanted to offer the Asardo as a partially completed car that allowed the buyer to choose their engine while Schlosser insisted that the car be sold complete with the Alfa engine. They parted ways over the difference and Schlosser went to Europe in search of alternate financing. 3500 GM-S Schlosser spent most of 1960 searching unsuccessfully for new backers. When he returned to the United States late that year former New York Giant turned auto dealer and racing driver Charlie Kolb with Florida VW/Porsche dealer Overkey Motors engaged Schlosser to redesign the Asardo to accept the Buick \\"215\\" aluminum V8 then under development at General Motors. Schlosser redesigned the chassis to make room for the new engine but kept the same body. The Buick engine and a Corvette transmission were installed in the car. Schlosser had designed an independent suspension system for the rear of the car but did not have the opportunity to install it, so the Alfa differential remained. The revised Asardo was renamed the 3500 GM-S. In competition and later history Vilardi raced the car in 1959 and was able to post a third place in the Montgomery preliminary on August 8 and a fourth place at the Lime Rock preliminary on October 17. After this Kolb made some track appearances. At various times the car has been owned by collectors in the United States, Japan, Germany and Spain. The Buick V8 has also been replaced with a 1600cc Alfa Romeo engine. The original 1500cc engine is reported to have languished behind an Alfa dealer in California for several years before being sold. Alfa Romeo Giulia TZ controversy In his 2002 book \\"Alfa Romeo TZ - Zagato Autodelta Conrero\\", author, racing driver and classic car dealer Philippe Olczyk suggested that the Asardo had strongly influenced the design of the Alfa Romeo Giulia TZ sports racer and that the car could be viewed as the first unofficial TZ prototype. Many in the motoring press and Alfa enthusiast community reacted with skepticism, pointing to significant differences between the cars.

In some cases, salt lakes have a higher concentration of salt than sea water; such lakes can also be termed hypersaline lakes. An alkalic salt lake that has a high content of carbonate is sometimes termed a soda lake. One saline lake classification differentiates between: *subsaline: 0.5‚Äì3‚Ä∞ (0.05-0.3%) *hyposaline: 3‚Äì20‚Ä∞ (0.3-2%) *mesosaline: 20‚Äì50‚Ä∞ (2-5%) *hypersaline: greater than 50‚Ä∞ (5%) Properties Salt lakes form when the water flowing into the lake, containing salt or minerals, cannot leave because the lake is endorheic (terminal). The water then evaporates, leaving behind any dissolved salts and thus increasing its salinity, making a salt lake an excellent place for salt production. High salinity will also lead to a unique halophilic flora and fauna in the lake in question; sometimes, in fact, the result may be an absence or near absence of life near the salt lake. If the amount of water flowing into a lake is less than the amount evaporated, the lake will eventually disappear and leave a dry lake (also called playa or salt flat). Brine lakes consist of water that has reached salt saturation or near saturation (brine), and may also be heavily saturated with other materials. Most brine lakes develop as a result of high evaporation rates in an arid climate with a lack of an outlet to the ocean. The high salt content in these bodies of water may come from minerals deposited from the surrounding land. Another source for the salt may be that the body of water was formerly connected to the ocean. While the water evaporates from the lake, the salt remains. Eventually, the body of water will become brine. Because of the density of brine, swimmers are more buoyant in brine than in fresh or ordinary salt water. Examples of such brine lakes are the Dead Sea and the Great Salt Lake. Bodies of brine may also form on the ocean floor at cold seeps. These are sometimes called brine lakes, but are more frequently referred to as brine pools. It is possible to observe waves on the surface of these bodies. Man-made bodies of brine are created for edible salt production. These can be referred to as brine ponds.  List  Bakhtegan and Maharloo salt lakes near Shiraz, Iran.

Like a body of water can have \\"sea\\" in its name and technically be a salt lake (for instance, the Salton Sea really being a salt lake), some of the last 18 listed salt lakes are playas, basins or ponds. This might even be the same way for the original 32 salt lakes that were listed here until April 6, 2020. Civilization tends to loosely categorize many of earth's bodies of water. 117,000,000 lakes scatter the earth, and together they only hold about seventeen thousandths or less of all water on earth, making salt lakes more interesting and special.

In body tissues, ions are also known as electrolytes, essential for the electrical activity needed to support muscle contractions and neuron activation. They contribute to osmotic pressure of body fluids as well as performing a number of other important functions. Below is a list of some of the most important ions for living things as well as examples of their functions: * Ca2+calcium ions are a component of bones and teeth. They also function as biological messengers, as do most of the ions listed below. See hypocalcaemia *Zn2+ \\\\- zinc ions are found in very small concentrations in the body, and their main purpose is that of an antioxidant; the zinc ions act as antioxidants both generally and for liver specific prooxidants. Zinc ions can also act as an antioxidant-like stabilizer for some macro-molecules which bind zinc ions with high affinity, especially in cysteine-rich binding sites. These binding sites use these zinc ions as a stabilizer to protein folds, making these protein motifs more rigid in structure. These structures include zinc fingers, and have several different conformations. * K+potassium ions' main function in animals is osmotic balance, particularly in the kidneys. See hypokalemia. * Na+sodium ions have a similar role to potassium ions. See sodium deficiency. *Mn2+\\\\- manganese ions are seen being used as stabilizer for varying protein configurations. However, manganese ion overexposure is linked to several neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. * Mg2+ magnesium ions are a component of chlorophyll. See magnesium deficiency * Cl‚àí inability to transport chloride ions in humans manifests itself as cystic fibrosis (CP) * the shells of sea creatures are calcium carbonate. In blood approximately 85% of carbon dioxide, is converted into aqueous carbonate ions (an acidic solution), allowing a greater rate of transportation. *Co2+\\\\- cobalt ions are present in the human body in amounts from 1 to 2 mg. Cobalt is observed in the heart, liver, kidney, and spleen, and considerably smaller quantities in the pancreas, brain, and serum. Cobalt is a necessary component of vitamin B12 and a fundamental coenzyme of cell mitosis. Cobalt is crucial for amino acid formation and some proteins to create myelin sheath in nerve cells. Cobalt also plays a role in creating neurotransmitters, which are vital for proper function within the organism. * adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a common molecule which stores energy in an accessible form. Bone is calcium phosphate. * Fe2+/Fe3+as found in haemoglobin, the main oxygen carrying molecule has a central iron ion. * source of nitrogen in plants for the synthesis of proteins.  Biological Functions of Inorganic Ions  = Ion Channels =  K+ Channels  Potassium ion channels play a key role in maintaining the membrane's electric potential. These ion channels are present in many various biological systems. They frequently play a role in regulation of cellular level processes, many of these processes including muscle relaxation, hypertension, insulin secretion etc. Some examples of potassium ion channels within biological systems include KATP channels, Big potassium channels, and Ether-√†-go-go potassium channels  Na+ Channels  Sodium ion channels provide an integral service through the body, as they transmit depolarizing impulses at the cellular and intracellular level. This allows sodium ions to coordinate much more intensive processes such as movement and cognition. Sodium ion channels consist of various subunits, however, only the principle subunit is required for function. These sodium ion channels consist of four internally homologous domains, each of which containing six transmembrane segments and resembling a single subunit of a voltage-dependent potassium ion channel. The four domains fold together, forming a central pore. That central pore of the sodium ions dictates the selectivity of the channel: both ionic radius and ionic charge are key in channel selectivity.  Cl‚àí Channels  Chloride ion channels vary from many other ion channels due to being controlled by the anionic chloride ions. Chloride ion channels are pore- forming membrane proteins that allow the passive transport of chloride ions across biological membranes. Chloride ion channels involve both voltage-gated and ligand-gated mechanisms to transport the ions across cellular membranes. Chloride ion channels have been found to play crucial roles in the development of human diseases, for example, mutations in the genes encoding chloride ion channels lead to a variety of deleterious diseases in muscle, kidney, bone, and brain, including cystic fibrosis, osteoporosis, and epilepsy, and similarly their activation is supposed to be responsible for the progression of glioma in the brain and the growth of malaria-parasite in the red blood cells. Currently, chloride ion channels are not completely understood, and more research is necessary.

LeBar (May 19, 1936 ‚Äì February 21, 2008) was a Roman Catholic priest who was the chief exorcist of the Archdiocese of New York in the United States.  Early career  Father LeBar was ordained in 1962. He was assigned as chaplain to Hudson Valley Psychiatric Center in 1982 and served until his retirement there in 2005. Previously he was a parochial vicar at Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Poughkeepsie, 1980‚Äì1982; St. Stanislaus, Pleasant Valley, 1979‚Äì1980; St. Catherine Laboure, Lake Katrine, 1973‚Äì1979 and 1965‚Äì1967; St. Joseph‚Äôs, Kingston, 1967‚Äì1973; St. Gregory Barbarigo, Garnerville, 1967; and St. John the Evangelist, White Plains, 1962‚Äì1965. He served briefly as administrator of St. Colman‚Äôs, East Kingston, and Holy Name of Jesus, Kingston. He taught religion at John A. Coleman Catholic High School, 1966‚Äì1970. In the 1970s LeBar was asked to become part of the Office of Communications of the Archdiocese of New York which at the time was dealing with the rise of groups they called \\"cults\\" and occult activity. In 1976 he was one of the priest advisors who supported the National Catholic Committee on Scouting's attendance with a Scout Service Corps at the 41st International Eucharistic Congress in Philadelphia and attended that event. He performed his first exorcisms in 1988 and 1989. In 1989 he also published his book, entitled Cults, Sects, and the New Age. He has counseled many former \\"cult members\\" and is a frequent speaker on this subject. He appeared as a guest on the Geraldo Rivera special Devil Worship Exposing Satan's Underground which aired on October 22, 1988.  Exorcist of the archdiocese of New York  He first came to prominence in 1991 when he took part in an exorcism in Palm Beach, Florida, which was broadcast on the ABC television program 20/20. He was appointed the chief exorcist of New York in 1992, by Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor. On June 25, 1995 Father LeBar was one of the guests on the Geraldo Rivera television program exploring satanic ritual abuse. When asked during an interview if he ever witnessed levitation during an exorcism he said, \\"I myself, have never seen a major levitation in the course of an exorcism. However, in one case in the preliminary investigation, I had a person who rose up above the pews of the church and was suspended there for a few minutes.\\" He told Spirit Daily at the time of the 25th anniversary release of the film The Exorcist that it, \\"is about the most accurate portrayal of what can happen at an exorcism that I have ever seen.\\" Actress Winona Ryder spoke with Father LeBar about exorcisms in 1999 in order to prepare for her film role in the movie Lost Souls in which LeBar was one of the consultants. He even allowed her to view some videotapes of exorcisms he had performed. Performance artist Linda Montano has also done work related to him since he died.Linda Montano: Events In July 2002 Father LeBar addressed a conference of Roman Catholic exorcists in Rome. He lived and worked in New York State and was assigned as Chaplain of the Hudson River Psychiatric Center in Poughkeepsie, a post he has held for almost twenty years.  Death  Father LeBar died of heart failure on the morning of February 21, 2008 at St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, NY. According to friends and colleagues, he was admitted to St. Francis and diagnosed as having what seemed to be (or at some point turned into) a bacterial infection which became septic. He was placed in intensive care and placed on a ventilator, until he died of heart failure. Father LeBar was buried from Regina Coeli Parish in Hyde Park, New York (roughly two hours north of Manhattan) where he was in residence for nearly the last 25 years, especially while he served during most of that time as priest-chaplain to the Hudson Valley Psychiatric Center. His body lay in-state at the church, where visitation were held on Sunday, February 24 in the afternoon and evening; the Mass of Christian Burial was concelebrated with one of the auxiliary bishops of New York on Monday, February 25, at 10:00. According to a colleague of Father LeBar: \\"For those of us who knew and worked with him, were served or mentored by him, we are trying with God‚Äôs grace to come to terms with this loss, both personally and for the Church in America. I have often remarked about Father‚Äôs disarmingly dry sense of humor‚Äîa hallmark of the same man who at times directly addressed and expelled demonic forces.

History  The organization was created in 1980, after an incident in September 1979 when the CTV Television Network incorrectly represented Chinese Canadians in an investigative show called W5. In a feature called \\"Campus Giveaways\\", CTV used allegedly incorrect statistics to conclude that foreign students were eroding other Canadians' opportunities for a secondary education and benefitting from public universities funded by Canadian taxpayers. All Chinese university students were treated as foreign students, regardless of their real nationality. The show also made numerous racial remarks about the Chinese students. The incident and the resulting campaign were reported in the Canadian media. In response, Chinese communities across Canada staged protests against CTV and forced the President of CTV to publicly apologize for the W5 feature. After the incident, Chinese who protested against CTV across Canada staged a meeting in Toronto. The meeting called for a stronger voice representing Chinese Canadians nationwide, thus the CCNC was formed. By 1980, the organization had developed nationwide presence with twenty-eight chapters, one of which is the United Chinese Community Enrichment Services Society (S.U.C.C.E.S.S.)  Advocacy history  Since the formation of the CCNC, it has spoken out against racial discrimination against Chinese in Canada. The CCNC is also involved in controversial issues concerning Chinese in Canada, like forcing the Government of Canada to apologize and redress the head tax that Chinese had to paid from 1885 to 1923. On November 28, 2005, the Toronto chapter of the CCNC was granted the William P. Hubbard Award for Race Relations by the Toronto city government, in recognition of the CCNC's advocacy for Head Tax redress. The CCNC has criticized the Bank of Canada for leaving out the image of an Asian Canadian from its 100 dollar bill and condemned the bank for listening to 'racist comments and feedback from the focus group' of its bank note design. The Bank of Canada later apologized to the CCNC's executive director Victor Wong.

Its southern end is at Interstate 376 at the Fort Pitt Bridge in Pittsburgh, and the north end is in Franklin Park at Interstate 79. It primarily serves at the main access route between Pittsburgh and its northern suburbs.  Route description  View of I-279 from the Swindell Bridge, roughly two miles north of downtown Pittsburgh. The southern terminus of I-279 is at I-376 in downtown Pittsburgh. It runs concurrently with U.S. Route 19 Truck from its southern terminus to exit 4. (US Route 19 Truck continues on Interstate 376 west.) I-279 crosses the Fort Duquesne Bridge over the Allegheny River, providing easy access to Heinz Field and PNC Park. Interstate 579 intersects I-279, but is only accessible by southbound traffic; likewise, traffic from I-579 can only head northbound on I-279 by the Interstate 279 Interchange. I-279 features two reversible high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes. The HOV lanes end at exit 5, which is an interchange with US 19. The road becomes more suburban and rural as it continues to head north. It has two additional interchanges, Bellevue/West View and Camp Horne Road. After Camp Horne Road, there are no exits until its terminus five miles later. The interstate terminates at its parent, Interstate 79. Like the interchange with I-579, this is also a partial interchange. Traffic on I-279 is only permitted to exit northbound on I-79, while only traffic heading southbound on I-79 can exit on to I-279 south. The section from exit 7A to exit 8B is also known as the North Shore Expressway.  History  I-279 inbound from the North Hills of Pittsburgh Interstate 279 was first proposed in 1958, to run along what is now I-79 between the current I-376 in Carnegie and the current I-279 in Franklin Park. On October 2, 1972, its route was swapped with I-79, putting I-279 onto its current route, although only the downtown portion and the Fort Duquesne Bridge were built at the time. In 1973, the designation was extended from downtown over Parkway West (what is now I-376) to I-79. This section became part of I-376 in 2009, and the I-279 signs were taken down there. I-279 from Fort Duquesne Bridge to its current northern terminus in Franklin Park was approved on June 4, 1975 but constructed from 1985 to 1989, opening in its entirety with a Governor Casey ribbon cutting on September 16, 1989. From 1997 to 2003, various ramps, the Fort Pitt Bridge, and nearby tunnels were reconstructed. A direct connection from I-279 south to I-376 east was opened in 2002. A tragedy occurred on the reversible HOV lanes in 1995 when a negligent highway worker failed to close the outbound gates, leading to a head-on collision that killed six. In 2006, to help prevent a repeat of this incident, automatic \\"fast acting gates\\" were activated at the southern entrances to these HOV lanes in downtown Pittsburgh. = Unearthed cemetery = During the last phases of construction of I-279 in 1987, a long-forgotten cemetery dating from the 19th century was unearthed near the site of the current I-279/I-579 split. Archaeologists spent four months exhuming the graves for cultural studies at the Smithsonian Institution, significantly putting PennDOT behind schedule to finish construction. It was determined that the graves belonged to Swiss and German immigrants that were members of a local church located next door to the cemetery in what was then Allegheny City, with 727 graves buried at the site between 1833 and 1861. The graves were forgotten about by 1911 when the church did an addition to the building and had the foundation unintentionally go through about fifteen graves, with the churchyard housing the cemetery later becoming a parking lot in 1950. Aside from a pair of stillborn twins, none of the graves were identified, and archaeologists were unable to find any living descendants due to the obscurity of the cemetery. The remains were reburied with one marker at the church's current cemetery in the Troy Hill section of Pittsburgh in 2003 after the Smithsonian Institution finished studying them; the congregation itself disbanded in 1984 after PennDOT bought the church property via eminent domain for I-279 and only had 21 members at that point. Today, it is the largest number of 19th century graves (Native American graves notwithstanding) ever studied archaeologically in America.http://old.post- gazette.com/lifestyle/20031028cemetery1028fnp2.asp  Exit list   See also   References   External links  * Category:Auxiliary Interstate Highways Category:Interstate Highways in Pennsylvania 2 Interstate 279 Interstate 279 Category:Roads with a reversible lane ","title":"Interstate 279"},{"id":"858111","text":"The beginning of the Livingstone Falls near Kinshasa A cataract of Inga Falls Livingstone Falls as seen by Stanley. Livingstone falls map Livingstone Falls (French: Chutes Livingstone; Dutch: Livingstonewatervallen) ‚Äî named for the explorer David Livingstone ‚Äî are a succession of enormous rapids on the lower course of the Congo River in west equatorial Africa, downstream from Malebo Pool in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Stanley, H.M., 1899, Through the Dark Continent, London: G. Newnes, Vol. One , Vol. Two Description Livingstone Falls consist of a series of rapids dropping in . They start downstream Malebo Pool and end in Matadi in Bas-Congo. The Congo River has the second largest flow rate in the world after the Amazon, which has no falls or rapids (except near its sources). The lowest rapids of Livingstone Falls, therefore, are the world's largest waterfall in terms of flow rate ‚Äî provided one accepts these rapids as being a waterfall. An interesting aspect of the long Livingstone Falls is the width of the channel. The channel is very narrow: in several stretches the channel width is less than 300 metres and for the majority of the length the channel is less than 800 metres wide. This is an extraordinarily narrow channel since the river flow rate typically exceeds . Investigations in 2008 and 2009 showed that sections between the rapids may be as deep as . The powerful rapids separate fish populations from one another, causing new species to evolve in close proximity to one another. History Although he explored the upper Congo, Livingstone never travelled to this part of the river and the Falls were named in his honour by Henry Morton Stanley. Stanley described the falls as \\"..the wildest stretch of river that I have ever seen. Take a strip of sea blown over by a hurricane, four miles in length and half a mile in breadth, and a pretty accurate conception of its leaping waves may be obtained. Some of the troughs were 100 yards in length, and from one to the other the mad river plunged. There was first a rush down into the bottom of an immense trough, and then, by its sheer force, the enormous volume would lift itself upward steeply until, gathering itself into a ridge, it suddenly hurled itself 20 or 30 feet straight upward, before rolling down into another trough. If I looked up or down along this angry scene, every interval of 50 or 100 yards of it was marked by wave-towers - their collapse into foam and spray, the mad clash of watery hills, bounding mounds and heaving billows, while the base of either bank, consisting of a long line of piled boulders of massive size, was buried in the tempestuous surf. The roar was tremendous and deafening. I can only compare it to the thunder of an express train through a rock tunnel.\\" Since the falls, which start with the Yellala Falls just above Matadi, are a barrier to navigation on the lower part of the river, the Matadi-Kinshasa Railway was constructed to by-pass them. \\"Grand Inga\\" proposed hydroelectric project Inga Falls on Congo River is a group of rapids in the latter portion of the Livingstone Falls, after the Malebo Pool. The Congo falls about 96 metres within this set of cataracts. The mean annual flow rate at Inga Falls is about 42,000 cubic metres per second. Given this flow rate and the 96 metre fall, it is possible to calculate that the Inga Falls alone has a power potential of approximately 40 GW. In 2014, Inga Falls was the site of two large hydro-electric power plants and is being considered for a much larger hydro-electric power generating station known as Grand Inga. The Grand Inga project, if completed, would be the largest hydro-electric power generating facility on Earth. The current project scope calls for the use of a flow rate 26,400 cubic metres per second at a net head of 150 metres; this is equivalent to a generating capacity of about 38.9 GW. This hydro-electric generator would be more than double the current world record holder, which is the Three Gorges facility on the Yangtze River in China.

It has also been published as Vril, the Power of the Coming Race. Some readers have believed the account of a superior subterranean master race and the energy-form called \\"Vril\\", at least in part; some theosophists, notably Helena Blavatsky, William Scott-Elliot, and Rudolf Steiner, accepted the book as based on occult truth, in part.Strube (2013), 55‚Äì123. One 1960 book, The Morning of the Magicians, suggested that a secret Vril Society existed in Weimar Berlin. However, there is no evidence for the existence of such a society. History The original, British edition of The Coming Race was published anonymously in May 1871, by Blackwood and Sons of Edinburgh and London. (Blackwood published four more \\"editions\\" in 1871.) Anonymous American and Canadian editions were published in August, as The Coming Race, or The New Utopia, by Francis B. Felt & Co. in New York and by Copp, Clark & Co. in Toronto. Late in 1871 Bulwer-Lytton was known to be the author. Erewhon, which was also published anonymously in March 1872, was initially assumed to be a Coming Race sequel by Bulwer-Lytton. When it was revealed that Samuel Butler was the writer in the 25 May 1872 issue of the Athenaeum; sales dropped by 90 percent. Plot summary The novel centres on a young, independent, unnamed, wealthy traveller (the narrator), who visits a friend, a mining engineer. They explore a natural chasm in a mine which has been exposed by an exploratory shaft. The narrator reaches the bottom of the chasm safely, but the rope breaks and his friend is killed. The narrator finds his way into a subterranean world occupied by beings who seem to resemble angels. He befriends the first being he meets, who guides him around a city that is reminiscent of ancient Egyptian architecture. The explorer meets his host's wife, two sons and daughter who learn to speak English by way of a makeshift dictionary during which the narrator unconsciously teaches them the language. His guide comes towards him, and he and his daughter, Zee, explain who they are and how they function. The hero discovers that these beings, who call themselves Vril-ya, have great telepathic and other parapsychological abilities, such as being able to transmit information, get rid of pain, and put others to sleep. The narrator is offended by the idea that the Vril-ya are better adapted to learn about him than he is to learn about them. Nevertheless, the guide (who turns out to be a magistrate) and his son Ta behave kindly towards him. The narrator soon discovers that the Vril-ya are descendants of an antediluvian civilization called the Ana, who live in networks of caverns linked by tunnels. Originally surface dwellers, they fled underground thousands of years ago to escape a massive flood and gained greater power by facing and dominating the harsh conditions of the Earth. The place where the narrator descended houses 12,000 families, one of the largest groups. Their society is a technologically supported Utopia, chief among their tools being an \\"all-permeating fluid\\" called \\"Vril\\", a latent source of energy that the spiritually elevated hosts are able to master through training of their will, to a degree that depends on their hereditary constitution. This mastery gives them access to an extraordinary force that can be controlled at will. It is this fluid that the Vril-ya employ to communicate with the narrator. The powers of the Vril include the ability to heal, change, and destroy beings and things; the destructive powers in particular are immense, allowing a few young Vril-ya children to destroy entire cities if necessary. Men (called An, pronounced \\"Arn\\") and women (called Gy, pronounced \\"Gee\\") have equal rights. The women are stronger and larger than the men. The women are also the pursuing party in romantic relationships. They marry for just three years, after which the men choose whether to remain married, or be single. The female may then pursue a new husband. However, they seldom make the choice to remarry. Their religion posits the existence of a superior being but does not dwell on his nature. The Vril-ya believe in the permanence of life, which according to them is not destroyed but merely changes form. The narrator adopts the attire of his hosts and begins also to adopt their customs. Zee falls in love with him and tells her father, who orders Ta√´ to kill him with his staff. Eventually both Ta√´ and Zee conspire against such a command, and Zee leads the narrator through the same chasm which he first descended. Returning to the surface, he warns that in time the Vril-ya will run out of habitable space underground and will claim the surface of the Earth, destroying mankind in the process, if necessary. =Vril in the novel= The uses of Vril in the novel amongst the Vril-ya vary from destruction to healing. According to Zee, the daughter of the narrator's host, Vril can be changed into the mightiest agency over all types of matter, both animate and inanimate. It can destroy like lightning or replenish life, heal, or cure. It is used to rend ways through solid matter. Its light is said to be steadier, softer and healthier than that from any flammable material. It can also be used as a power source for animating mechanisms. Vril can be harnessed by use of the Vril staff or mental concentration. A Vril staff is an object in the shape of a wand or a staff which is used as a channel for Vril. The narrator describes it as hollow with \\"stops\\", \\"keys\\", or \\"springs\\" in which Vril can be altered, modified, or directed to either destroy or heal. The staff is about the size of a walking stick but can be lengthened or shortened according to the user's preferences. The appearance and function of the Vril staff differs according to gender, age, etc. Some staves are more potent for destruction; others, for healing. The staves of children are said to be much simpler than those of sages; in those of wives and mothers, the destructive part is removed while the healing aspects are emphasised. Literary significance and reception The book was quite popular in the late 19th century, and for a time the word \\"Vril\\" came to be associated with \\"life-giving elixirs\\".. The best known use of \\"Vril\\" in this context is in the name of Bovril (a blend word of Bovine and Vril).. From 5 to 7 March 1891, there was even a \\"Vril-ya Bazaar\\" held at the Royal Albert Hall in London.Strube (2013), 48ff. Recent research has shown that Bulwer-Lytton developed his ideas about \\"Vril\\" against the background of his long preoccupation with occult natural forces, which were widely discussed at that time, especially in relation to animal magnetism or, later, spiritualism.Strube (2013), 13‚Äì44. In his earlier novels Zanoni (1842) and A Strange Story (1862), Bulwer-Lytton had discussed electricity and other \\"material agents\\" as the possible natural causes for occult phenomena. In The Coming Race, those ideas are continued in the context of a satirical critique of contemporary philosophical, scientific, and political currents. In a letter to his friend John Forster, Bulwer-Lytton explained his motives: Bulwer-Lytton has been regarded as an \\"initiate\\" or \\"adept\\" by esotericists, especially because of his Rosicrucian novel Zanoni (1842). However, there is no historical evidence that suggests that Bulwer-Lytton can be seen as an occultist, or that he has been the member of any kind of esoteric association. Instead, it has been shown that Bulwer-Lytton has been \\"esotericized\\" since the 1870s. In 1870, the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia appointed Bulwer- Lytton as its \\"Grand Patron.\\" Although Bulwer-Lytton complained about this by letter in 1872, the claim has never been revoked. Other claims, such as his membership in a German masonic lodge Zur aufgehenden Morgenr√∂the, have been proven wrong.Strube (2013), 55‚Äì74. Those claims, as well as the recurrent esoteric topics in Bulwer-Lytton's works, convinced some commentators that the fictionalised Vril was based on a real magical force. Helena Blavatsky, the founder of Theosophy, endorsed this view in her book Isis Unveiled (1877) and again in The Secret Doctrine (1888). In Blavatsky, the Vril power and its attainment by a superhuman elite are worked into a mystical doctrine of race. However, the character of the subterranean people was transformed. Instead of potential conquerors, they were benevolent (if mysterious) spiritual guides. Blavatsky's recurrent homage to Bulwer-Lytton and the Vril force has exerted a lasting influence on other esoteric authors.Strube (2013), 69ff., 77ff. When the theosophist William Scott-Elliot describes life in Atlantis in , the aircraft of the Atlanteans are propelled by Vril-force.. His books are still published by the Theosophical Society. Scott-Elliot's description of Atlantean aircraft has been identified as an early inspiration for authors who have related the Vril force to UFOs after World War II. George Bernard Shaw read the book and was attracted to the idea of Vril, according to Michael Holroyd's biography of him. French writer Jules Lermina included a Vril-powered flying machine in his . In his 2011 book of correspondences with David Woodard, Swiss writer Christian Kracht discusses his longstanding interest in Vril.Kracht, C., & Woodard, D., Five Years (Hanover: Wehrhahn Verlag, 2011), pp. 166‚Äì171. Stage adaptation A stage adaptation of the book was written by journalist David Christie Murray and magician Nevil Maskelyne. The production premiered at Saint George's Hall in London on 2 January 1905. Both Nevil Maskelyne and his father John Nevil Maskelyne collaborated on the special effects for the play. The play did not meet with success and closed after a run of eight weeks.. Vril Society =Willy Ley= Willy Ley (right) in a discussion with Heinz Haber and Wernher v. Braun, 1954 Willy Ley was a German rocket engineer who had emigrated to the United States in 1937. In 1947, he published an article titled \\"Pseudoscience in Naziland\\" in the magazine Astounding Science Fiction.. He wrote that the high popularity of irrational convictions in Germany at that time explained how National Socialism could have fallen on such fertile ground. Among various pseudoscientific groups he mentions one that looked for the Vril: \\"The next group was literally founded upon a novel. That group which I think called itself 'Wahrheitsgesellschaft' ‚Äì Society for Truth ‚Äì and which was more or less localised in Berlin, devoted its spare time looking for Vril.\\" =Jacques Bergier and Louis Pauwels= The existence of a Vril Society was alleged in 1960 by Jacques Bergier and Louis Pauwels.Goodrick-Clarke (2002), 113. In their book The Morning of the Magicians, they claimed that the Vril-Society was a secret community of occultists in pre-Nazi Berlin that was a sort of inner circle of the Thule Society. They also thought that it was in close contact with the English group known as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The Vril information takes up about a tenth of the volume, the remainder of which details other esoteric speculations, but the authors fail to clearly explain whether this section is fact or fiction. Historians have shown that there has been no actual historical foundation for the claims of Pauwels and Bergier, and that the article of Willy Ley has only been a vague inspiration for their own ideas. Nevertheless, Pauwels and Bergier have influenced a whole new literary genre dealing with the alleged occult influences on National Socialism which have often been related to the fictional Vril Society.Strube (2013), 126‚Äì142. In his book Monsieur Gurdjieff, Louis Pauwels. claimed that a Vril Society had been founded by General Karl Haushofer, a student of Russian magician and metaphysician Georges Gurdjieff. =Publications on the Vril Society in German= The book of Jacques Bergier and Louis Pauwels was published in German with the title: Aufbruch ins dritte Jahrtausend: von der Zukunft der phantastischen Vernunft (literally Departure into the Third Millennium: The Future of the Fantastic Reason) in 1969. In his book Black Sun, Professor Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke refers to the research of the German author Peter Bahn. Bahn writes in his 1996 essay, \\"Das Geheimnis der Vril-Energie\\" (\\"The Secret of Vril Energy\\"),. of his discovery of an obscure esoteric group calling itself the \\"Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft\\", which revealed itself in a rare 1930 publication Vril. Die Kosmische Urkraft (Vril, the cosmic elementary power) written by a member of this Berlin-based group, under the pseudonym \\"Johannes T√§ufer\\" (German: \\"John [the] Baptist\\"). Published by the influential astrological publisher, Otto Wilhelm Barth (whom Bahn believes was \\"T√§ufer\\"), the 60-page pamphlet says little of the group other than that it was founded in 1925 to study the uses of Vril energy.. See image in German Wikipedia The German historian Julian Strube has argued that the historical existence of the \\"Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft\\" can be regarded as irrelevant to the post-war invention of the Vril Society, as Pauwels and Bergier have developed their ideas without any knowledge of that actual association.Strube (2013), 126‚Äì140. Strube has also shown that the Vril force has been irrelevant to the other members of the \\"Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft,\\" who were supporters of the theories of the Austrian inventor Karl Schappeller (1875‚Äì1947).Strube (2013), 98‚Äì123. =Esoteric neo-Nazism= After World War II, a group referred to by Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke as the Vienna Circle elaborated an esoteric neo- Nazism that contributed to the circulation of the Vril topos in a new context.Goodrick-Clarke (2002). In their writings, Vril is associated with Nazi UFOs and the Black Sun concept. Julian Strube wrote that a younger generation related to the Tempelhofgesellschaft, has continued the work of the Vienna Circle and exerts a continuous influence on the most common notions of Vril. Those notions are not only popular in neo-Nazi circles but also in movies or computer games, such as Iron Sky, Wolfenstein, and Call of Duty.Strube (2013), 48ff.

They also offered a range of products for special builders: radiators, header tanks, lighting sets, steel tubing, sheet aluminium, various suspension parts, water pumps, tires, tubes and wheels. The company also made bonnets and hardtops for other mass-produced sports cars, including the Austin-Healey Sprite and Jaguar E-Type. History Ashley Laminates was founded in 1955 by Peter Pellandine and Keith Waddington. The name \\"Ashley\\" was chosen as it was the name of Peter Pellandine's house in Woodford Green. They designed and built their first car using GRP for the bodyshell. The two set up a small factory in a garage next to the Robin Hood Inn at Loughton, Essex to produce shells. The garage has now made way for the pub car park. In late 1956 Pellandine left the company to found Falcon Shells, another specials company. Pellandine took with him the rights and tooling to manufacture the short-wheelbase bodyshell for the Ashley 750 and the Sports Racer which he continued in production as the Falcon Mark 1 and Mark 2 respectively. In 1958, to increase manufacturing space, Ashley Laminates moved to the Potteries in Upshire, whilst retaining the Loughton premises as a showroom. He also introduced a new bodyshell, the 1172, and the Regent chassis. 1960 saw the introduction of the Sportiva. Ashley Sportiva at Auto Retro 2010 in Barcelona. For further info on this car see the AshleyPhoenix Story In 1961 the company moved again, this time to Bush Fair, Harlow, but the following year production of body shells ceased when the specials market waned, due to a change in Sales Tax rules. The company, however, continued to manufacture GRP hardtops and bonnets for sports cars. Adverts from 1963 onwards indicate that the company changed names to Ashley Auto Improvements and moved, this time to Bishops Stortford in Hertfordshire. Although Keith Waddington died in the mid-1960s, the company continued until 1972. The Ashley range of bodyparts has been re introduced in 2010 by Moto-Build Racing in Sutton in Surrey and whilst at present it focuses mainly on the MG Midget and Austin Healey Sprite there are moulds in progress for the Triumph Spitfire Mk1, 2 and 3, there is a website dedicated to this at www.ashleygt.co.uk Models =Ashley 750= Ashley 750 Hard top Ashley Based on the short- wheelbase (6-foot 3 inch) Austin Seven chassis, with its 747 cc engine (hence the model name). Later a long-wheelbase (6-foot 9 inch) version was offered. The price of both was the same: ¬£78 for the shell and ¬£25 for the hard top.

They are part of the ethnic Chinese diaspora (or Overseas Chinese). History The paifang at the entrance of Havana's Chinatown Chinese immigration to Cuba started in 1847 when Chinese (Cantonese and Hakka) contract workers were brought to work in the sugar fields, bringing the religion of Buddhism with them. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese workers were brought in from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan during the following decades to replace and/or work alongside African slaves. After completing eight-year contracts or otherwise obtaining their freedom, some Chinese immigrants settled permanently in Cuba, although most longed for repatriation to their homeland. Havana's Chinatown (known as Barrio Chino de La Habana) is one of the oldest and largest Chinatowns in Latin America. Some 5,000 immigrants from the U.S. came to Cuba during the late 19th century to escape the discrimination present at the time. Another, albeit smaller wave of Chinese immigrants, also arrived during the 20th century, some as supporters of the communist cause during the Cuban revolution and others as dissidents escaping the authorities in China. There were almost no women among the nearly entirely male Chinese \\"coolie\\" population that migrated to Cuba (1%). In Cuba, some Indian (Native American), mulatto, black and white women engaged in sexual relations or marriages with Chinese men, with marriages of mulatto, black and white women being reported by the Cuba Commission Report. 120,000 Cantonese labourers (all males) entered Cuba under contract for 8 years. Most of these men did not marry, but Hung Hui (1975:80) cites there was a frequency of sexual activity between black women and these Asian immigrants. According to Osberg (1965:69) the free Chinese practice of buying slave women and then freeing them expressly for marriage was utilized at length. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Chinese men (Cantonese) engaged in sexual activity with Black Cuban women and from such relations many children were born. In the 1920s, an additional 30,000 Cantonese and small groups of Japanese also arrived; both immigrations were exclusively male and there was rapid intermarriage with white, black and mulato populations. In the study of genetic origin, admixture and asymmetry in maternal and paternal human lineages in Cuba, thirty-five Y-chromosome SNPs were typed in the 132 male individuals of the Cuban sample. The study does not include any people with some Chinese ancestry. All the samples were White Cubans and Black Cubans. Two out of 132 male sample belong to East Asian Haplogroup O2 which is found in significant frequencies among Cantonese people is found in 1.5% of Cuban population. In the 1920s, an additional 30,000 Chinese arrived; the immigrants were exclusively male. In 1980, 4000 Chinese lived there, but by 2002, only 300 pure Chinese were left.http://www.uv.es/EBRIT/macro/macro_5006_64_24.html Two thousand Chinese, consisting of Cantonese and Hakkas, fought with the rebels in Cuba's Ten Years' War. A monument in Havana honours the Cuban Chinese who fell in the war, on which is inscribed: \\"There was not one Cuban Chinese deserter, not one Cuban Chinese traitor.\\"Westad, Odd Aren (2012) Restless Empire: China and the World Since 1750. (New York: Basic Books), pp.227‚Äì28. Chinese Cubans, including some Chinese Americans from California, joined the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898 to achieve independence from Spain, but a few Chinese, who were loyal to Spain, left Cuba and went to Spain. Racial acceptance and assimilation would come much later. When the new revolutionary government led by Fidel Castro came to power in 1959, the economic and political situation changed. Many Chinese grocery store owners, having had their properties expropriated by the new government, left Cuba. Most of these settled in the United States, particularly nearby Florida, where they and their U.S.-born children are called Chinese-Americans or Cuban Americans of Chinese descent, while a relatively few fled to the nearby Dominican Republic and other Latin American countries and also to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, where they are called Chinese-Puerto Ricans, Cuban- Puerto Ricans of Chinese descent or Cuban-Americans of Chinese descent. Chinese refugees to United States include people whose ancestors came to Cuba 10 years before the Cuban Revolution and those from the United States. As a result of this exodus, the number of pure Chinese dropped sharply in Havana's Barrio Chino. The places to which they migrated had a unique Chinese culture and a popularity of Chinese Cuban restaurants. Current distribution Cuchillo street, the heart of Havana's Chinatown The Chinese Cubans fought in the Cuban war of independence on the side of those seeking independence from Spain. A memorial consisting of a broken column memorializes Chinese participation in the war of independence at the corners of L and Linea in Havana. While many fled, some Chinese stayed after the start of Fidel Castro's rule in 1961. Younger generations are working in a wider variety of jobs than the previous generation. Many are entering show-business as song composers, actors, actresses, singers and models. The Barrio Chino de La Habana is no longer among the largest Chinatowns in Latin America. Most Chinese Cubans live outside Barrio Chino. Several community groups, especially Chinatown Promotional Group (Spanish: Grupo Promotor del Barrio Chino), worked to revive Barrio Chino and the faded Chinese culture. Chinese Language and Arts School (Escuela de la Lengua y Artes China) opened in 1993 and has grown since then, helping Chinese Cubans to strengthen their knowledge of the Chinese language. Today, Chinese Cubans tend to speak Mandarin, Cantonese, Hakka and a mixture of Chinese and Spanish, in addition to Spanish and English. They also promoted small businesses, like beauty parlors, mechanical shops, restaurants and small groceries, provided to them to create a view of Barrio Chino. Havana's Barrio Chino also experienced buildings of Chinese architecture and museum with backgrounds about China. As a result, the Chinese Cuban community has gained visibility. In literature * The influence of the Chinese migration to Cuba is thoroughly reflected in the novel The Island of Eternal Love(Riverhead Books, June 2008) by Cuban American author Da√≠na Chaviano. Originally published in Spain as La isla de los amores infinitos,(Grijalbo-Random House 2006) it has been translated into 25 languages.

In 1919 a new company Ashton-Evans Motors Ltd was formed. The cars were designed by E Bailey who had been with Sunbeam and later J. Bedford. The first car of the marque designed by E Bailey was described as \\"a three-wheeler with four wheels\\" and had a rear track of only to avoid the need for a differential. The rear axle was suspended by a quarter elliptic spring fastened to the tubular chassis at the front and resting on a metal plate on the top of the rear axle which was located by the use of a torque tube and two rods. It is not certain if any of these cars were sold. In 1920 Mr Ashton-Evans decided to find out what his customers wanted in an \\"owner driver's ideal\\" car and invited opinions. From the response he worked out that the car should have a four-cylinder water cooled engine not exceeding 12 taxable hp and be silent, vibrationless, easy to start and powerful. Gear changing should be silent and without the need to double declutch. There should be room for three people on the front seat. To meet this specification J Bedford designed a new car which became the Ashton 10.5 model, the Ashton-Evans name being temporarily dropped. This had a normal rear axle. Most cars featured -litre, 4-cylinder Coventry Simplex engines and three-speed constant-mesh gearboxes with selection made by dog clutches. Some of the early cars might have had two-cylinder engines. Two- and four-seat open bodies were available. Production of cars was slow and probably not profitable and in 1923 a single model, the 11/16 was made and the name returned to Ashton-Evans. A fire in 1924 badly hit production and car production was temporarily suspended in 1927 but never resumed. As many as 250 might have been made.

It is operated by the Detroit Zoological Society (DZS), a non-profit organization, along with the Belle Isle Nature Center, located within the city limits of Detroit on Belle Isle. The Detroit Zoo is one of Michigan's largest family attractions, hosting more than 1.5 million visitors annually. Situated on 125 acres of naturalistic exhibits, it is home to more than 2,400 animals representing 235 species. The Detroit Zoo was the first zoo in the United States to use barless exhibits extensively. History Historical marker at main entrance The first Detroit Zoo opened in 1883 on Michigan and Trumbull Avenues (area south of Michigan bounded by Church Street and west of 10th Street (then known as Wesley Street)), across from the then site of Tiger Stadium. William Cameron Coup's circus had arrived in town, only to succumb to financial difficulties. Luther Beecher, a local businessman, financed the purchase of the circus animals and erected a building for their display called the Detroit Zoological Garden. The zoo closed the following year and the building was converted into a horse auction site (the Michigan Avenue Horse Exchange).Austin, William (1974). The First Fifty Years. Detroit Zoological Society. The Detroit Zoological Society was founded in 1911, but the zoo's official opening did not occur until August 1, 1928. At the opening ceremony, acting Mayor John C. Nagel was to speak to the gathered crowd. Arriving late, Nagel parked his car behind the bear dens and as he came rushing around the front, Morris, a polar bear, leaped from his moat and stood directly in front of Nagel. Unaware how precarious his situation was, Nagel stuck out his hand and walked toward the polar bear joking, \\"He's the reception committee.\\" The keepers rushed the bear and forced him back into the moat, leaving the mayor uninjured. By 1930, the Bear Dens and Sheep Rock had been added, followed shortly by the Bird House. Next to be constructed were the Elk Exhibit, the Baboon Rock, and Primate and Reptile houses. The Detroit Zoo was the first zoo in America with cage-less exhibits. The onset of the Great Depression brought to a halt additional major projects, but expansion resumed in the 1940s and has periodically continued since then. During the depression, one of the more popular attractions was Jo Mendi, a four-year-old chimpanzee purchased by the zoo director with his own funds. A veteran of Broadway and motion pictures, the chimp performed an act for the audience. As one press account stated, \\"he enjoys every minute of the act...He counts his fingers, dresses, laces his shoes, straps up his overalls; pours tea and drinks it; eats with a spoon, dances and waves farewell to his admirers.\\" When the chimp fell ill in late 1932 after eating a penny, surgeons from area hospitals came to check him out. During his recovery, visitors brought toys, peanuts and more than $500 worth of flowers, along with several thousands cards and letters. Jo died in 1934 from hoof and mouth disease. In 1939, sculptor Corrado Parducci created the Horace Rackham Memorial Fountain, popularly known as \\"the Bear Fountain.\\" The memorial was one of four major donations made by Mary Rackham in the memory of her late husband Horace, the other three being college buildings named after him in Detroit, Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti, Michigan. From the 1950s through the early 1970s, local weatherman Sonny Eliot hosted a television program, At the Zoo, that was shown on Saturdays on television station WDIV. Until 1982, trained chimpanzees performed for visitors, but the act was discontinued at the insistence of animal rights activists. Also in 1982, the zoo began to charge an admission fee for the first time.

On February 18, 2006, the Detroit City Council voted to shut down the zoo as part of budget cuts, being unable to reach an agreement with the Detroit Zoological Society to take over the park and a legislative grant having expired that day. An uproar ensued and the Council, on March 1, 2006, voted to transfer operations to the Detroit Zoological Society with a promised $4 million grant from the Michigan Legislature. The city retained ownership of the assets, including the Detroit Zoo in Royal Oak and the Belle Isle Nature Center in Detroit. The Society is responsible for governance, management and operations, including creating a plan to raise the money needed to keep the facilities operating for generations to come. On August 5, 2008 voters in Macomb, Oakland, and Wayne counties overwhelmingly passed a zoo tax that provides long-term sustainable funding to supplement earned revenue and philanthropic support.

In September 2019, the Polk Penguin Conservation Center was closed for repairs. It will reopen in the fall of 2020. The penguins have been moved back to the original Penguinarium until the Polk Center reopens.

The center, which opened in June 2000, has a diverse range of frogs, toads, salamanders, newts and caecilians. The Wall Street Journal dubbed the attraction \\"Disneyland for toads\\". The National Amphibian Conservation Center participates in research and conservation efforts for species including the Panamanian golden frog, Puerto Rican crested toad, and Wyoming toad. In 2002, the Detroit Zoo was awarded the AZA National Exhibit Award for Amphibiville. =The Arctic Ring of Life= thumb The 4-acre Arctic Ring of Life, which opened in October 2001, is home to three polar bears, gray seals, a harbor seal and arctic foxes. It is among the largest polar bear habitats in North American zoos. In 2003, the Detroit Zoo was awarded the AZA Significant Achievement Award for the Arctic Ring of Life. =Cotton Family Wetlands and Boardwalk= Mimicking a Michigan ecosystem, the 1.7-acre pond and wetlands area and accompanying 7,200-square-foot boardwalk is home to native fish, frogs, turtles and birds as well as the zoo's trumpeter swans.

The Wetlands and Boardwalk are bounded by Amphibiville, the Warchol Beaver Habitat, the Edward Mardigian Sr. River Otter Habitat, and the Holden Reptile Conservation Center. Thanks to a $102,350 grant from NOAA, the Wetlands are also able to be used as professional development and outdoor classroom for teachers and students underrepresented in science fields. =Cotton Family Wolf Wilderness= The Cotton Family Wolf Wilderness is a $1.4 million two-acre sanctuary that features native meadows and trees, a flowing stream and pond, dens, and elevated rock outcroppings from which two gray wolves survey their surroundings. The habitat also incorporates a renovated historic log cabin which had existed on the property. =Giraffe Encounter= At the Giraffe Encounter, guests are able to feed the giraffes from an 18-foot-tall platform that extends into their habitat. This experience, which started in July 2007, runs Tuesday through Sunday from spring through fall. =The Great Apes of Harambee= The Great Apes of Harambee is a 4-acre indoor/outdoor habitat home to chimpanzees and western lowland gorillas. The animals may be rotated into each other's habitat spaces, as this simulates nomadic movement similar to wild behavior. =Holden Reptile Conservation Center= Opened as the Holden Museum of Living Reptiles in 1960, the Holden Reptile Conservation Center is home to 150 reptiles representing 70 species, 45 percent of which are considered threatened or endangered in the wild. =Edward Mardigian Sr. River Otter Habitat= thumb The Edward Mardigian Sr. River Otter Habitat provides a habitat for North American river otters and features a 9,000-gallon pool complete with waterfall and waterslide. The pool is enclosed on one side by a glass wall, on the other side of which is an observation building. The habitat is designed so that visitors ‚Äì including small children ‚Äì can enjoy an eye-level view of the otters as they swim. =Polk Penguin Conservation Center= thumb The Polk Penguin Conservation Center (PPCC), opened in April 2016. The Polk Penguin Conservation Center is the largest center for penguins in the world and was awarded the 2017 Exhibit Award by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, given annually to accredited zoos and aquariums for excellence in exhibit design. The PPCC is closed for waterproofing repairs as 9 gallons of groundwater had been seeping into the building daily, requiring pumping. The Detroit Zoological Society entered into arbitration with the original builders of the PPCC, Detroit based DeMaria Building Co. and Florida based Wharton-Smith Inc. to rectify the problem. After winning arbitration, executive director and CEO Ron Kagan has faulted the joint venture DeMaria/Wharton-Smith for its knowingly failure to properly waterproof the foundation and its failure to inform the D.Z.S. thereafter. Through mediation the joint venture Demaria/Wharton-Smith agreed to make necessary repairs at their own expense and have attributed faulty work to subcontractors. The joint venture maintains they are \\"proud of the quality of work provided to the D.Z.S. over the past two decades\\", citing numerous awards for their work on the PPCC. During the exhibit closure, the penguins that reside in the PPCC will move back to the original Penguinarium. The Polk Penguin Conservation Center is set to reopen in the fall of 2020 after repairs are complete. =Jane and Frank Warchol Beaver Habitat= Opened in 2013, the Jane and Frank Warchol Beaver Habitat abuts the Cotton Family Wetlands, and is home to nine beavers. As beavers are nocturnal, their night-time activities are recorded and played throughout the day on televisions in the exhibit. This is the first time beavers have been on display at the Detroit Zoo since 1969. =The Wildlife Interpretive Gallery= The Wildlife Interpretive Gallery is home to the Butterfly Garden, Matilda Wilson Free-Flight Aviary, Science On a Sphere, as well as DZS's permanent fine art collection. Shelle Isle, an exhibit dedicated to the partula snail ‚Äì a once-extinct animal the DZS is credited with saving. Other highlights Among other highlights at the Detroit Zoo are the Horace H. Rackham Memorial Fountain, the narrow gauge Tauber Family Railroad, the Carousel, and the Ford Education Center which houses the Simulator Ride and 4-D Theater. Detroit Zoological Society The Detroit Zoological Society (DZS) is a non-profit organization that operates the Detroit Zoo and Belle Isle Nature Center. Its $44.5 million annual operating budget is supported by earned revenue, philanthropic support, and a tri-county (Macomb, Oakland, and Wayne) millage. The organization has 260 full and part-time employees, more than 52,000 member households, and more than 1,000 volunteers. Delivering on its mission of \\"Celebrating and Saving Wildlife\\", the DZS is a leader in animal conservation and welfare. In collaboration with the DNR and USFWS, the DZS continues to release Zoo-reared federally endangered Karner blue butterflies in their natural habitats in Michigan with the goal of reestablishing self-sustaining populations. Each summer, DZS bird keepers assist with conservation efforts in northern Michigan for the federally endangered Great Lakes piping plover by artificially incubating abandoned piping plover eggs. Most recently, the DZS, in collaboration with the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge and the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, established of a common tern nesting site on Belle Isle. The Detroit Zoological Society is frequently asked to help with the rescue of exotic animals from private owners, pseudo-sanctuaries, roadside zoos, and circuses. Among the DZS's rescues are more than 1,000 exotic animals confiscated from an animal wholesaler in Texas, a polar bear that was confiscated from a circus in Puerto Rico, a lioness that was used to guard a crack house, and retired racehorses. In addition, the Detroit Zoological Society and Michigan Humane Society, in collaboration with dozens of local animal welfare organizations, host Meet Your Best Friend at the Zoo, the nation's largest offsite companion animal adoption program. Since the event's inception in 1993, more than 25,000 dogs, cats, and rabbits have been placed into new homes at the spring and fall events. The Center for Zoo and Aquarium Animal Welfare and Ethics (CZAAWE) was created in 2009 as a resource center for captive exotic animal welfare knowledge and best practices. It provides a much-needed forum for exotic animal welfare policy discussion/debate and recognizes captive exotic animal welfare initiatives through awards. The DZS provides educational experiences to nearly 70,000 teachers and students annually through camps, curriculum-based field trips, family and youth programs and professional development opportunities. The DZS also supports students and teachers through conservation education in rural rainforest communities through the Adopt-A-School program. The Berman Academy for Humane Education offers a broad range of unique and engaging programs that help people help animals. The Academy utilizes a variety of teaching strategies ‚Äì from traditional instruction to storytelling, role-playing, theater, and virtual technology ‚Äì to educate audiences about the need to treat other living creatures with empathy, respect and gentleness. Accredited by the Association of Zoos & Aquariums, the Detroit Zoo features many award-winning habitats including the Wildlife Interpretive Gallery, National Amphibian Conservation Center, Great Apes of Harambee and Arctic Ring of Life, which was named the number-two best zoo exhibit in the U.S. by the Intrepid Traveler's guide to \\"America's Best Zoos\\".

Early history (1910-1950) =Rhode Island Boy Scouts= The Rhode Island Boy Scouts (RIBS), formerly American Boy Scouts of Rhode Island , was a Scouting organization in the United States from 1910 until its merger with the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) in 1917. RIBS still exists as a trustee organization. =Boy Scouts of America= In 1910 the First Providence Troop was organized in Washington Park. On October 24, 1910 the troop was formally recognized by Scout headquarters. Troop meetings were held at the Broad Street School. The first Scoutmaster was Herbert R. Dean, a retired Army general. The first charter listed sixty-four boys. Four BSA councils were formed in the state. The first council, Providence Council (#546), was organized in 1916 based in Providence. The second was Pawtucket Council (#548) in 1917 and ended in 1920. From 1918 to 1924, Newport Council (#547) existed. In 1924, Woonsocket Council (#549) formed a council.HISTORY OF COUNCILS IN THE BSA -- FEATURED STATE: Rhode Island In 1917, Rhode Island Boy Scouts merged with Providence Council to form the Greater Providence Area Council (#546) and recognized its existence back to 1910. In 1922, Pawtucket Council was reorganized into Pawtucket & Central Falls Council (#548). In 1924, Newport Council became Newport County Council (#547). In 1926, the Greater Providence Area Council was created from the merger of Greater Providence Council and Newport County Council. In the years 1929 and 1930, the three Rhode Island councils merged into Narragansett Council. The present Narragansett Council was formed as the result of a 2001 merger between the Moby Dick Council and the Narragansett Council. =Narragansett Council= Narragansett Council is based in East Providence, Rhode Island, but has 3 service areas that serve communities in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut: *Southeast Service Area- New Bedford, Fairhaven, Dartmouth, Marion, Mattapoisett, Rochester, Acushnet, Wareham, Fall River, Assonet, Freetown, Somerset, Westport, Swansea, Seekonk, Rehoboth, Portsmouth, Middletown, Newport, Tiverton, Little Compton, East Providence, Bristol, Warren, Barrington *Southwest Service Area- Coventry, West Warwick, East Greenwich, West Greenwich, Exeter, Frenchtown, Warwick, Block Island, Narragansett, Wakefield, Westerly, Misquamicut, Bradford, Ashaway, Matunuck, Pawcatuck, Charlestown, Richmond, Hopkinton, Hope Valley, Peacedale, South Kingstown, Kingston, West Kingston, Davisville, North Kingstown, Quidnessett, Wickford, Jamestown *Northwest Service Area- Burrillville, Scituate, Foster, Glocester, Johnston, Smithfield, North Providence, Providence, Cranston, Woonsocket, Blackstone, Bellingham, North Smithfield, Millville, Uxbridge, Cumberland, Lincoln, Central Falls, Pawtucket *Northeast Service Area- North Attleboro, Attleboro, South Attleboro, Chartley, Norton, Mansfield, Dighton, Berkley, Taunton, East Taunton, Raynham, Middleboro, Carver, Lakeville Massasoit Council The Fall River Council rechartered as the Massasoit Council. It was headquartered in Fall River, Massachusetts and served that city and the surrounding communities of Somerset, Swansea, Westport, Tiverton and Little Compton. The Wampanoag District served Somerset and Swansea. The Council Office was located in the Women's Union Building on Rock Street. The Massasoit Council existed until 1972. The primary source for Boy Scout uniforms and gear was McWhirr's department store on South Main Street in Fall River. Many Council-wide Scouting events were often held at Lincoln Park in Westport, Massachusetts. The Firestone Rubber Company, which had a large factory in Fall River, sponsored the Firestone Award for outstanding Boy Scouts in the Massasoit Council in the 1950s and 1960s. These recognition events were held at White's in Westport. left Camping for the Fall River Council began in 1917 at Camp Stanford in Fall River and provided an outlet for boys for four years. It was decided in 1921 at a Fall River Council Executive Board meeting that the purchase of a wooded area would take place, naming it Camp Noquochoke. Additional land was purchased in Camp Noquochoke‚Äôs later years covering over on the eastern shore of the Westport River in Westport. Camp site facilities ranged from undeveloped, to tent sites with platforms, to A-frames (\\"Adirondacks\\") to cabins with stoves and bunk beds. The physical facilities were significantly improved in the late 1950s with a new dining hall (constructed by Fall River (Building) Trades Council with site work provided by the Navy SeabeesReservists) and an in-ground pool. The Navy Seabee Reservists did upgrade the camp road from the entrance on Pine Hill Road to its termination by the former or old dining hall ending at the river's bluff. The Seabees also did the site work for the new dining hall, dugout the archery range and may have partially or completely built the rifle range on the newly acquired Donovan property. This work done by the Seabees was part of their community service, especially non-profit agencies. Camp legend, the basis for many campfire stories, was a character named \\"Three-fingered Willie.\\" Camp Noquochoke continued to serve area youth until 1980. Cachalot Council On May 13, 1935, as part of complying with new rules of incorporation for Boy Scout councils in Massachusetts, the New Bedford Council changed its name to the Cachalot Council. The name, derived from the French and Portuguese words for sperm whale, was proposed by Joe Allen, of the [Martha's] Vineyard Gazette, in January 1933 to honor the history of whaling in New Bedford. At the time, the Council did own a property that was used as a camp. This property, off Rock O' Dundee Road in South Dartmouth [2], was too small and lacked adequate water sources, both for drinking and swimming. For a short time, from 1937 through 1942, the council shared the summer camp facilities of the Fall River Council [3], but this was deemed \\"not satisfactory for many reasons.\\" [4] From 1943 through 1945, summer camp was held at Camp Maxim, which was owned by the local Boys Club, and also failed to meet the needs of the program. In 1945, the Cachalot Council conducted a capital fundraising campaign expressly for the purpose of acquiring a suitable camp. Many local businesses and individuals contributed, and the campaign successfully raised $75,000. At the same time, the council began looking for a suitable property. After considering several properties [5], they placed on offer on a large parcel adjacent to the southeastern corner of Myles Standish State Forest, owned by \\"The Five Mile Corporation.\\" This corporation, headed by Theodore Steinway (of Steinway & Sons Piano), Albert Hathaway, and Russell Davis, had purchased the property during the Great Depression for a mere $12,000, and agreed to sell it to the council for the same price. The deed was signed over in January 1946, and preparations immediately commenced to open the Camp for its first summer camp season ever, with Roland Deneault as Camp Director, in summer of the same year. It has operated continuously since. Cachalot Scout Reservation remains to this day serving scouts in Southeast Massachusetts. Cachalot Council's Order of the Arrow lodge was Agawam Lodge 509 which had the totem of the whale. Moby Dick Council The Moby Dick Council (also known as Moby Dick Council of Massachusetts and Rhode Island) was formed in 1972 by a merger of the Cachalot Council of Greater New Bedford and the Massasoit Council of Greater Fall River. The two former councils were small, and fell victim to the BSA's desire to create larger councils. In 2001, Moby Dick Council suffered a similar fate, and merged with the Narragansett Council of Rhode Island, much to the chagrin of many old-timers of both the smaller councils and the larger Moby Dick Council. Camps Moby Dick Council originally had two camps: Camp Cachalot was the camp for Cachalot Council, and Camp Noquochoke was the camp for Massasoit Council. Camp Noquochoke was sold due to its smaller size and fewer prospects, and later became a residential neighborhood. Camp Cachalot still remains as a weekend and summer resident camp owned and operated by the Narragansett Council. Massasoit Council's Noquochoke Lodge 124 of the Order of the Arrow merged with Cachalot Council's Agawam Lodge 509 to form Neemat Lodge 124. Annawon Council 1930-2015 The Annawon Council is a local council of the Boy Scouts of America headquartered in Norton, Massachusetts. It is one of the few small councils that remained in the area. In 1930 Annawon Council was organized, but it was not until January 9, 1931, that it was incorporated under the laws of Massachusetts, and legally established as of April 20, 1933. At the time of organization, the Council included the communities of Attleboro, Mansfield, Norton, Taunton, Raynham, and Berkley. William Lee Abbott was appointed Scout Executive and secretary. Dr. Joseph L. Murphy of Taunton was the first Council president, Annawon was one of the last Councils in Massachusetts to be organized. In 1916 the first Scouting charters in Massachusetts were granted to the Fall River and the Fairhaven-New Bedford Councils. Annawon Council was incorporated in 1931. The state of Massachusetts required that both Fall River and Fairhaven-New Bedford council recharter under the articles of incorporation, at that time Fall River Council became known as the Massasoit Council and Fairhaven-New Bedford Council became known as the Cachalot Council. During 1932 first serious consideration was given a Council-owned camp site for Annawon Scouts. Although considerable thought was given to a site on Lake Mashpee on Cape Cod, the Council reneged on a thirty-day option to buy the property. During the summer of 1932 the invitation of Old Colony Council to camp with them at Camp Childs on Morey's Pond was accepted. on October 1, 1932, as a result of the permission of Mr. Clement Jeffers of Attleboro, a camp site for weekend camping was dedicated as Camp Jeffers. During the summer of 1933, the scouts camped on Greenwood Lake, West Mansfield, at Camp Annawon. This was the first year that a camp existed, the site was known as Camp Finberg, it was a YMCA camp. After considerable study in 1934, the Council purchased 25 Acres on Darby Pond in Plymouth for use as a camp site. The site was known as \\"Camp King\\" and was purchased from Phillip Cole for $2,500.00. From July 15 to August 19, scouts camped on the shore of Darby Pond at Camp Annawon. The original entrance road was off of Plymouth street just off of Carver St (Route 44). It crossed over the cranberry dam below the present BB Range. On June 24, 1935 William A. Collins of Norwich, Connecticut and a graduate of MIT was appointed Scout Executive. He immediately went into camp to direct the Council Camp, which was officially named Camp Norse for the first time. That year the boy week count rose to 165. In 1940 the land north of the original property of 25 acres was purchased for $300.00, it included an abandoned house in a large field. This field became the ball field. A new entrance road into camp was built off of Partings way road. It was later enlarged by the National Guard Army Corps of Engineers. In 1950 Ellis Brewster from the Plymouth Cordage Company donated 100 acres to Annawon council to increase the size of Camp Norse. That same year, the shallow well was replaced with a deeper well and then was enclosed in a block house through a grant from the George Magee Memorial Fund. In 1960 the camp received a bronze bell, dated 1891. Howard Fowler, Editor of The Mansfield News and former Council President, was instrumental in procuring the bell from the Mansfield Fire Department. It came from an old firehouse on West Church St In Mansfield. Camp Norse is the sole camp of the council located at 112 Parting Ways Rd. Kingston, MA. In 2014, it was announced that Annawon Council will be merging with a neighboring council. In the spring of 2015, Annawon Council's Executive Committee announced it will be starting merger talks with Narragansett Council headquartered in East Providence, Rhode Island. The council formally merged in September 2015. The council was divided into the following districts serving 11 communities in Bristol and Plymouth Counties: *Angle Tree District: North Attleboro, MA, Attleboro, MA, Norton, MA, Mansfield, MA *Sachem District: Dighton, MA, Berkley, MA, Taunton, MA, Raynham, MA, Middleboro, MA, Carver, MA, Lakeville, MA In June 1941, Tulpe Lodge, Order of the Arrow was approved by the Executive Board. On August 2, 1943, the council applied for and received a charter for their new Order of the Arrow Lodge, and Tulpe Lodge was official. The turtle shell symbol came from the turtles from Camp Norse. Apparently it was custom at the time to hollow out a turtle shell and use it as a neckerchief slide. There is no chapter system in use for the two districts of the lodge/council. Tulpe has hosted three conclaves at Camp Norse for Area 1C, and Section NE-1B. The name Tulpe remained in the Narragansett Council Merger. South East Camping Association In 1993 Camp Norse officially became Camp Norse Cub World and was no longer used for the summer camp for the Scout Troops but rather was used by Cub Scouts through the South East Camping Association (SEMCA). This was a North East Region BSA sanctioned program that included the Cape Cod and Islands Council, Annawon Council, and the Moby Dick Council. This effort was designed to use the resources available in these three councils. Troop camping for all three Councils was to be at Camp Cachalot which was owned by the Moby Dick Council. The Cub Scout summer camp would be at Camp Norse, and the Boy Scout High Adventure summer camp, would be at Camp Greenough on Cape Cod. The Original Narragansett Council 1917-2001 The Narragansett Council, Boy Scouts of America is part of a worldwide Scouting movement with over 15 million members in one hundred countries. Boy Scouting began in England in 1907 when the British military hero, Lord Robert Baden-Powell, organized the first Boy Scout camp. In 1908, he published Scouting for Boys and formed what would become the British Boy Scout Association. As a result of a ‚Äúgood turn‚Äù performed by an English Scout in London for Chicago publisher William D. Boyce, Scouting came to America. The Boy Scouts of America was incorporated in 1910 and chartered by Congress on June 15, 1916. Scouting in Rhode Island began as the Rhode Island Boy Scouts which was first organized as a voluntary association on September 6, 1910. On April 13, 1911, it was chartered under state laws for the purpose of giving boys of Rhode Island an organization in which they could be formed into groups that mirrored the newly formed national Boy Scout Program. From 1910 to 1917, Rhode Island Boy Scouts established groups (troops) throughout Rhode Island, except in Newport, Blackstone Valley and Woonsocket. In these locations, troops were organized and affiliated with the National Council Boy Scouts of America. In 1917, Rhode Island Boy Scouts ‚Äòmerged‚Äô with the National movement. Under the terms of the agreement, the Greater Providence Council Boy Scouts of America was formed to take over the operation of the Scouting Program and supervision of troops. The National Council Boy Scouts of America recognized the date of the Council‚Äôs organization as September 6, 1910, and granted all members back service to that date. The National Council Boy Scouts of America also agreed that the Rhode Island Boy Scouts could maintain its corporate identity so that it could continue to receive bequests, hold funds and properties and acquire other funds and properties in the future; thus, the formation of Rhode Island Boy Scouts as a Trustee organization. In 1929 and 1930, the Greater Providence Council Boy Scouts of America merged with the Newport County Council, the Pawtucket-Central Falls Council and the Woonsocket Council to form the Narragansett Council. The Order of the Arrow Lodge was the Wincheck Lodge 534 which had the totem of the bear and specifically served Yawgoog Scout Reservation. It was formed in the 1950s from Yawgoog's honor society, The Wincheck Indians, when the Order of the Arrow became growing in national popularity.  Narragansett Council 2002-2015 On July 1, 2001, the Moby Dick Council headquartered in New Bedford, Massachusetts, merged with the Narragansett Council in Providence, Rhode Island, adding 17 more cities and towns in Massachusetts to the 6 cities and towns the Narragansett Council was already serving. The Council serves almost 26,000 registered youth members and Learning for Life participants and supports in excess of 5,000 registered adult volunteers. The Narragansett Council operates two Scout Shops/Service Centers (one in the Summit Square Plaza on Route 2 in Warwick, RI and one in the Swansea Mall in Swansea, MA) and owned and operated eight great camps: Camp Aquapaug in South Kingstown, RI, Buck Hill Scout Reservation in Burrillville, RI, Camp Buxton in Rehoboth, MA, Cub World at Buck Hill Scout Reservation in Burrillville, RI, Cachalot Scout Reservation in Carver, MA, Champlin Scout Reservation in Cranston, RI, Sandsland on Block Island, and Yawgoog Scout Reservation in Hopkinton, RI. Administrative functions are housed at 10 Risho Avenue in East Providence, RI. The Order of the Arrow Lodge is Abnaki Lodge 102 with the totem of a bear and a peace pipe. Narragansett Council began merger talks with Annawon Council based in Norton, MA in 2015 and officially merged on September 10, 2015 under the name Narragansett Council. The Modern Narragansett Council On September 10, 2015, the Annawon Council headquartered in Norton, Massachusetts, merged with the Narragansett Council in East Providence, Rhode Island, adding 11 more cities and towns in Massachusetts to the 23 cities and towns the Narragansett Council was already serving. The newly merged operation, which will take the name of the Narragansett Council, includes all of Rhode Island, 34 communities in Massachusetts and 1 in Connecticut, and boasts nearly 14,000 Scouts, the largest in Northeast Area 1. The Narragansett Council‚Äôs main headquarters remain at its current location in East Providence. The Narragansett Council operates three Scout Shops/Service Centers (one in the Summit Square Plaza on Route 2 in Warwick, RI, one in the past Annawon Council Office and Scout Shop in Norton, MA, and one in the Swansea Mall in Swansea, MA) and owns and operates nine great camps: Camp Norse in Kingston, MA, Camp Aquapaug in South Kingstown, RI, Buck Hill Scout Reservation in Burrillville, RI, Camp Buxton in Rehoboth, MA, Cub World at Buck Hill Scout Reservation in Burrillville, RI, Cachalot Scout Reservation in Carver, MA, Champlin Scout Reservation in Cranston, RI, Sandsland on Block Island, and Yawgoog Scout Reservation in Hopkinton, RI. Administrative functions are housed at 10 Risho Avenue in East Providence, RI. The Order of the Arrow lodge of the new council is Tulpe Lodge 102 with the totem of the turtle, formed from a merger of Narragansett Council's Abnaki Lodge 102 and Annawon Council's Tulpe Lodge 245. Scouting in Rhode Island today The Narragansett Council of the Boy Scouts of America serves all of the state of Rhode Island and some of Massachusetts and Connecticut. Its several camps include Camp Yawgoog and Camp Cachalot. Girl Scouting in Rhode Island The first Girl Scout troop in Rhode Island was started in 1914 and the first council in 1919. In 1962 the then existing 9 Rhode Island councils merged to form Girl Scouts of Rhode Island.http://www.gsri.org/matriarch/MultiPiecePage.asp_Q_PageID_E_10_A_PageName_E_AboutHistory =Girl Scouts of Southeastern New England= Girl Scouts of Southeastern New England, headquartered in Warwick, Rhode Island is the council serving Rhode Island. It also includes 13 communities in Massachusetts (see Scouting in Massachusetts for map) and Pawcatuck, Connecticut.

Originally ordained as a Jesuit priest, he became Professor of Palaeography at the Vatican's Pontifical Biblical Institute. From 1958, he served as secretary to Cardinal Augustin Bea during preparations for the Second Vatican Council. Disillusioned by Vatican II, he asked to be released from certain aspects of his Jesuit vows in 1964 and moved to New York City, where he later became an American citizen. His 17 novels and non-fiction books were frequently critical of the Vatican hierarchy, whom he believed had failed to act on the Third Prophecy revealed by the Virgin Mary at F√°tima. Among his most significant works were The Scribal Character of The Dead Sea Scrolls (1958) and Hostage To The Devil (1976) which dealt with Satanism, demonic possession, and exorcism. The Final Conclave (1978) was a warning against Soviet espionage in the Holy See via Soviet spies in the Vatican. History =Early life and education= Martin was born in Ballylongford, County Kerry, Ireland, to a middle-class family in which the children were raised speaking Irish at the dinner table. Catholic belief and practice were central. His parents, Conor and Katherine Fitzmaurice Martin had five sons and five daughters. Four of the five sons became priests, including his younger brother, Francis Xavier Martin.\\"Papers of F.X. Martin\\", UCD Archives Martin received his secondary education at Belvedere College in Dublin. He studied philosophy for three years at University College Dublin, and on 6 September 1939, became a novice with the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits).Annuario Pontificio, 2010, p.1438. He taught for three years, spent four years at Milltown Park, Dublin, and was ordained in August 1954. Upon completion of his degree course in Dublin, Martin was sent to the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium, where he took a doctorate in archaeology, Oriental history and Semitic languages. He started postgraduate studies at both the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and at the University of Oxford, specializing in intertestamentary studies and knowledge of Jesus Christ and of Hebrew and Arabic manuscripts. He undertook additional study in rational psychology, experimental psychology, physics, and anthropology. =Work and ordination= Martin took part in the research on the Dead Sea Scrolls and published 24 articles on Semitic palaeography in various journals. He did archaeological research and worked extensively on the Byblos syllabary in Byblos, in Tyre, and in the Sinai Peninsula. Martin assisted in his first \\"exorcism\\" while staying in Egypt for archaeological research. He published a work in two volumes, The Scribal Character of the Dead Sea Scrolls, in 1958., 2 volumes. St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City He was sent to Rome to work at the Holy See as a private secretary of Cardinal Augustin Bea SJ from 1958 until 1964. This brought him into contact with Pope John XXIII. Martin's years in Rome coincided with the beginning of the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì65), which was to transform the Catholic Church in a way that the initially liberal Martin began to find distressing. He became friends with Monsignor George Gilmary Higgins and a fellow Jesuit priest, Father John Courtney Murray. In Rome, he became a professor at the Pontifical Biblical Institute, where he taught Aramaic, paleography, Hebrew and Sacred Scripture. He also taught theology, part-time, at Loyola University Chicago's John Felice Rome Center. He worked as a translator for the Orthodox Churches and Ancient Oriental Churches Division of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity under Cardinal Bea. Thus, Martin became well acquainted with prominent Jewish leaders, such as Rabbi Abraham Heschel, in 1961 and 1962. Martin accompanied Pope Paul VI on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in January 1964. He resigned his position at the Pontifical Institute in June 1964. In February 1965, Martin requested release from the Jesuit Order. He received a provisional release in May 1965 and a dispensation from his vows of poverty and obedience on 30 June 1965 (cf. qualified exclaustration). Even if dispensed from his religious vow of chastity, he remained under the obligation of chastity if still an ordained secular priest. Martin maintained that he remained a priest, saying that he had received a dispensation from Paul VI to that effect. He moved permanently to New York City in 1966, where he first worked as a dishwasher, a waiter and taxi driver, and continued to write. He co-founded an antiques firm and was active in communications and media for the rest of his life. After his arrival in New York, Cardinal Terence Cooke gave him written permission to exercise his secular priestly faculties. =Communications and media= Central Park, New York In 1967, Martin received his first Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1969, he got his first breakthrough with his book The Encounter: Religion in Crisis as a result of his expertise in Judaism, Christianity and Islam and with which he won the Choice Book Award of the American Library Association. Afterwards came other liberally oriented books like Three Popes and the Cardinal: The Church of Pius, John and Paul in its Encounter with Human History (1972) and Jesus Now (1973). Malachi Martin became a United States citizen in 1970. He received a second Guggenheim fellowship in 1969, which enabled him to write his first of four bestsellers, Hostage to the Devil: The Possession and Exorcism of Five Living Americans. With this book, published in 1976, Martin references his experience as an exorcist. According to the book he assisted in several exorcisms. William Peter Blatty \\"wrote a tirade against Malachi, saying his 1976 book was a fantasy, and he was just trying to cash in.\\" He became \\"an iconic person in the paranormal world.\\"McManus Darraugh. \\"The Strange Case of Father Malachi Martin\\", Independent, January 13, 2017 He was a periodic guest on Art Bell's radio program, Coast to Coast AM, between 1995 and 1998. The show continues to play tapes of his interviews on Halloween. During that decade, Martin also served as religious editor for National Review from 1972 to 1978, when he was succeeded by Michael Novak. He was interviewed twice by William F. Buckley, Jr. for Firing Line on PBS. He was an editor for the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Martin published several books in quick succession the following years: The Final Conclave (1978), King of Kings: a Novel of the Life of David (1980) and Vatican: A Novel (1986) were \\"factionals\\". The Decline and Fall of the Roman Church (1981), The New Castle: Reaching for the Ultimate (1982), Rich Church, Poor Church: The Catholic Church and its Money (1984) and There is Still Love: Five Parables of God's Love That Will Change Your Life (1984) were non-fiction works. His bestselling 1987 non-fiction book, The Jesuits: The Society of Jesus and the Betrayal of the Roman Catholic Church, was highly critical of the Order, accusing the Jesuits of systematically undermining church teachings. =Later life= Martin's The Keys of This Blood: The Struggle for World Dominion between Pope John Paul II, Mikhail Gorbachev, and the Capitalist West was published in 1990 and was followed in 1996 by Windswept House: A Vatican Novel. Martin continued to offer Mass privately each day in the Tridentine Mass form, and vigorously exercised his priestly ministry all the way up until his death. He was strongly supported by some Traditional Catholic sources and severely criticized by other sources, such as the National Catholic Reporter. Martin served as a guest commentator for CNN during the live coverage of the pastoral visit of Pope John Paul II to the United States 4‚Äì8 October 1995. In the last three years of his life, Martin forged a close friendship with the Traditionalist Catholic philosopher, Rama Coomaraswamy (1929‚Äì2006). In the final years before his death, Martin was received in a private audience by Pope John Paul II. =Death= The footstone of Malachi Martin in Gate of Heaven Cemetery Malachi Martin died of an intracerebral hemorrhage due to a fall in his apartment in Manhattan in 1999, four days after his 78th birthday. It was stated in the documentary Hostage to the Devil that Martin had said that he was pushed from the stool he was standing on by a demonic force. His funeral took place in St. Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic Chapel of West Orange, New Jersey, before the burial at Gate of Heaven Cemetery, in Hawthorne, New York. =Writings= In 1964, Martin, under the pseudonym Michael Serafian, wrote The Pilgrim: Pope Paul VI, the Council, & the Church in a Time of Decision, an apologia for the Jews, which, among other things, told the story of the Jewish question and the Second Vatican Council. He produced a number of best-selling fictional and non-fictional books. His fictional works purported to give detailed insider accounts of Church history during the reigns of Popes Pius XII, John XXIII, Paul VI (The Pilgrim, Three Popes and the Cardinal, Vatican: A Novel), John Paul I (The Final Conclave) and John Paul II (The Keys of This Blood, Windswept House). His non-fictional writings cover a range of Catholic topics, such as demonic exorcisms, Satanism, liberation theology, the Second Vatican Council (The Pilgrim), the Tridentine liturgy, Catholic dogma, modernism (Three Popes and the Cardinal; The Jesuits), the financial history of the Church (Rich Church, Poor Church; The Decline and Fall of the Roman Church), the New World Order and the geopolitical importance of the Pope (The Keys of This Blood). =Opinions= He spoke and wrote often about the Three Secrets of F√°tima and was an ardent supporter of Fr. Nicholas Gruner: \\"Father Gruner is fulfilling a desperately needed function in the ongoing perception of Mary's role in the salvation of our imperiled world. Father Gruner is absolutely correct that the consecration of Russia as‚ÄîOur Lady desired, has not been executed\\". Martin said concerning the three secrets of Mary at F√°tima in 1917, she requested that Russia be consecrated to her Immaculate Heart. He said that he stood outside the papal living quarters in 1960 whilst Pope John XXIII and Cardinal Bea and others were reading the document containing the third secret and that, in order to assure Russian cooperation at the approaching Second Vatican Council, the Pope decided against the mandate. Later, Paul VI and John Paul II decided against it for various reasons. He was an outspoken opponent of the alleged apparitions of the Virgin Mary at Meƒëugorje in former Yugoslavia. Martin said that false pretenses were used in obtaining earlier his recommendation. Concerning the Garabandal apparitions, he remained open-minded. In March 1997, Martin claimed on Radio Liberty's Steel on Steel, that two popes were murdered during the 20th Century: * Pope Pius XI was murdered on the orders of Benito Mussolini, because of his 1931 encyclical, Non abbiamo bisogno, which was critical of the Italian Fascist state. * Pope John Paul I was murdered according to Martin's book, Vatican: A Novel, by Jean-Marie Villot, formerly Cardinal Secretary of State under Pope Paul VI, under orders from the U.S.S.R.. Martin partially gave credence to the Siri thesis, saying that Cardinal Giuseppe Siri was twice elected pope in papal conclaves, but declined his election after being pressured by worldly forces acting through cardinals present at the conclaves. Martin called this the little brutality. On the one hand, Martin says that Siri was intimidated: on the other hand he says that Siri did indicate that his decision not to accept was made freely. * The first occasion, according to him, was the Papal conclave, 1963. Martin mentioned the possibility of a nuclear threat which involved \\"the very existence of the Vatican state\\" during this conclave on pages 600‚Äì610 of his book The Keys of this Blood, which deals primarily with Siri and the 1963 conclave. * The second time was the Papal conclave, October 1978. Martin said on Radio Liberty's programme Steel on Steel in March 1997, that Siri received a written note after his initial election threatening him and his family with death should he accept. Martin claimed that Popes John XXIII and Paul VI were Freemasons during a certain period and that photographs and other detailed documents proving this were in the possession of the Vatican State Secretariat. He allegorically mentioned these supposed facts in his 1986 novel Vatican: A Novel, where he related the Masonic adherence of Popes Giovanni Angelica and Giovanni De Brescia. He claimed Archbishop Annibale Bugnini C.M. was a Freemason and that Agostino Casaroli, long-time Cardinal Secretary of State, was an atheist. In his 1987 book The Jesuits, Martin claims to prove the existence of a diplomatic agreement between the Vatican and the USSR called the Metz Accord. The Vatican allegedly promised non-condemnation of communism in exchange for participation of Russian-Orthodox prelates as observers at the Second Vatican Council. In his book The Final Conclave, published on 1 August 1978,. the month of the 1978 conclave that resulted in the 26 August election of Albino Luciani, Malachi Martin wrote of the unexpected election of a Cardinal Angelico, a figure that has been interpreted as corresponding to Luciani. Martin stated that, along with diabolic possession, angelic possession also exists and that angels could have use of preternatural powers in certain circumstances. . Controversies =Alleged affairs= There were three allegations made against Martin of having affairs with women: * Martin was criticized most notably in the book Clerical Error: A True Story by Robert Blair Kaiser, Time magazine's former Vatican correspondent. Kaiser, a former Jesuit, accused Martin of having carried on an extramarital affair with his wife during 1964 in Rome, and claimed that Martin fled to the United States as a renegade from the priesthood. A friend of Martin's, William H. Kennedy, published an article in The Seattle Catholic disputing Kaiser's allegation and other claims made about Martin after his death. Kennedy points out that Kaiser admits in his book that he was diagnosed as having paranoid schizophrenia, and cites passages from Kaiser's book which he believes show that Kaiser was writing from a distorted and delusional perspective due to his mental illness. *In her 2008 book, Queen of the Oil Club: The Intrepid Wanda Jablonski and the Power of Information, Anna Rubino wrote that Martin had a love affair with oil journalist Wanda Jablonski on a visit to Beirut, Lebanon in the 1950s. The book was published long after the deaths of both Jablonski (1992) and Martin (1999). =Laicization dispute= The traditionalist Catholic website Daily Catholic said in 2004 that Father Vincent O'Keefe S.J., former Vicar General of the Society of Jesus and a past President of Fordham University, stated that Martin had never been laicized. According to this report, O'Keefe stated that Martin had been released from his Jesuit vows except for chastity. Religious vows such as those of Jesuits include that of chastity, but a religious priest dispensed from them is still bound by the obligation of chastity that is attached to his priesthood, unless he is also laicized, which usually includes dispensation from the obligation imposed by the law of celibacy. When a priest of a religious institute becomes a secular priest, he must first find a bishop willing to accept him as a member of the clergy of his diocese.Auguste Boudinhon, \\"Secularization\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia No claim has been made that Martin was incardinated into any particular diocese. Martin himself is quoted as stating that \\"'In 1965, Mr. Martin received a dispensation from all privileges and obligations deriving from his vows as a Jesuit and from priestly ordination' (Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, 25 June 1997, Prot. N. 04300/65)\\". The Daily Catholic said its 2004 statement was based on one by William Kennedy, according to which the declaration of Martin's laicization was mounted in retaliation for his book The Jesuits, which accused the Jesuits of deviating from their original character and mission by embracing Liberation Theology. =Alleged ordination as a bishop= During a videotaped memorial titled Malachi Martin Weeps For His Church, Rama Coomaraswamy, a sedevacantist cleric, claimed that Martin had told him that he had been secretly ordained a bishop during the reign of Pius XII in order to travel behind the Iron Curtain ordaining priests and bishops for the underground churches of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Coomaraswamy died in 2006.Anthony Cekada: Untrained and Un-Tridentine: Holy Orders and the Canonically UnfitCoomaraswamy, Rama, On the Validity of My Ordination, CoomaraswamyCatholicWritingsEkelberg, Mary Ellen, The Underground Church of Pius XII, Catholic Counterpoint, Broomall, ... =Alleged authorship= *The book The Pilgrim: Pope Paul VI, The Council and The Church in a time of decision was written by Martin under the pseudonym Michael Serafian. This was confirmed by Martin himself and corroborated independently by Hans K√ºng. Martin related that his choice of surname, Serafian, was due to meeting a carpet dealer in Jerusalem with that name, during the pilgrimage of Paul VI to the Holy Land in January 1964. Serafian is a common Armenian surname.. The Southern Poverty Law Center describes the publishing house as specializing in the most extreme radical traditionalist materials (Intelligence Report, Winter 2006, Issue Number: 124). *The pseudonym of Xavier Rynne, used to write more than 20 books on Vatican II, is not that of Martin, but of Fr. Francis X. Murphy C.Ss.R.. *The 1966 article Laures et ermitages du d√©sert d'Egypte published in M√©langes de l'Universit√© Saint-Joseph by the hand of \\"M. Martin\\" was written by Maurice Martin, and not Malachi Martin. =Joseph Roddy allegations= Journalist Joseph Roddy alleged ‚Äî in a 1966 Look Magazine article about the debate about Jews during the Second Vatican Council ‚Äî that one and the same person under three different pseudonyms had written or acted on behalf of Jewish interest groups, such as the American Jewish Committee, to influence the outcome of the debates. Roddy wrote that two timely and remunerated 1965 articles were penned under the pseudonym F.E. Cartus, one for Harper's Magazine and one for the American Jewish Committee's magazine Commentary. Roddy alleged that tidbits of information were leaked to the New York press that detailed Council failings vis a vis Jews under the pseudonym of Pushkin. Roddy claimed two unidentified persons were one and the same person ‚Äî a \\"young cleric-turned-journalist\\" and a \\"Jesuit of Irish descent working for Cardinal Bea...who was active in the Biblical Institute\\" ‚Äî he figuratively named as Timothy O'Boyle-Fitzharris, S.J. so as not to reveal the true identity of his source. Roddy mentioned The Pilgrim in a footnote to his article. In his 2007 book Spiritual Radical: Abraham Joshua Heschel in America, Edward K. Kaplan confirmed that Martin cooperated with the American Jewish Committee during the Council \\"for a mixture of motives, both lofty and ignoble...[He] primarily advised the committee on theological issues, but he also provided logistical intelligence and copies of restricted documents.\\" It is confirmed in the book that Martin used the pseudonyms Forest and Pushkin. Kaplan acknowledges that the kiss and tell book about the internal workings of the Council, The Pilgrim by Michael Serafian, was requested from Martin by Abraham J. Heschel, who arranged for the book to be published by Roger W. Straus, Jr.'s Farrar, Straus and Giroux printing company. It was published in the hope that it would influence the deliberations in the council. Once Martin's identity as author was revealed, it led to protests \\"and the book had to be removed from circulation at considerable financial loss to the publisher\\". Kaplan lastly states that Malachi Martin was the primary source of information for Joseph Roddy in writing his 1966 article for Look Magazine, and that O'Boyle-Fitzharris was, in fact, Martin. Kaplan judges the Roddy article as \\"dangerously misleading [due] to the credence it gives to the claim that without organised Jewish pressure the council declaration on the Jews would not have been accepted.\\" Martin explicitly denied he was a spy, along with denying other rumors. Michael Cuneo, in his book American Exorcism, writes that \\"Martin told me that he was perplexed, and more than a little annoyed, by the swirl of rumors surrounding his personal life.\\" Elsewhere, Martin admitted some of his work involved intelligence gathering behind the Iron Curtain and throughout the Middle East, and at times threatening cardinals with blackmail if they did not want to do what Cardinal Bea and Pope John XXIII wanted from them at the council. \\"I saw cardinals sweating in front of me,\\" Martin recalled. \\"And I began to enjoy it.\\" =Alleged Jewish heritage= Rumors appearing on various Catholic or sedevacantist websites and magazines alleged that Martin had Jewish ancestry of ancestral descent from Iberian Jews migrating to Ireland and Great Britain in the 15th century, and alleged him being an Israeli spy because of his first name, Malachi, after a Hebrew prophet and his extensive travels in the Levant. These allegations were rebutted by William H. Kennedy (In Defense of Father Malachi Martin). After having made genealogical inquiries with surviving relatives of Martin in Ireland, Kennedy concluded that Martin's father was an Englishman who moved to Ireland, and that Martin's mother was Irish on both sides. Fr. Rama Coomasrawamy confirmed this independently. The Irish language name Ma√©lsheachlainn is usually anglicized as Malachy and Saint Malachy was a 12th Century Irish saint. =Alleged photograph= Claims that Martin features as a curial monsignor in full regalia on a prominent photograph next to Pope John Paul I and his assistant Diego Lorenzi appeared on the Internet. The photograph, published in David Yallop's In God's Name: An Investigation into the Murder of Pope John Paul I as number 28 between pages 120 and 121, shows a \\"Monsignor Martin\\", visibly different from Malachi Martin. This is a case of mistaken identity: the cleric in the photograph was Jacques-Paul Martin, Prefect of the Casa Pontificia from 1969 to 1986.

Founding The first Leader Building with surrounding town, Regina, 1884The newspaper was first published as The Leader in 1883 by Nicholas Flood Davin, soon after Edgar Dewdney, Lieutenant- Governor of the North-West Territories, decided to name the then-vacant and featureless site of Pile-O-Bones, renamed Regina by Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, wife of the then Governor General of Canada, as territorial capital rather than previously established Battleford, Troy and Fort Qu'Appelle, presumably because he had acquired ample land on the site for re-sale. The first Leader Building, Regina, Assiniboia, 1884\\"A group of prominent citizens approached lawyer Nicholas Flood Davin soon after his arrival in Regina and urged him to set up a newspaper. Davin accepted their offerand their $5000 in seed money. The Regina Leader printed its first edition on March 1, 1883.\\"\\"Regina: The Early Years.\\" http://scaa.usask.ca/gallery/regina/central/downtown_business/CORA_RPL_B_395.html. Viewed November 16, 2012. Published weekly by the mercurial Davin, it almost immediately achieved national prominence during the North-West Rebellion and the subsequent trial of Louis Riel. Davin had immediate access to the developing story, and his scoops were picked up by the national press, briefly bringing the Leader to national prominence. Davin's greatest coup was sending his reporter Mary McFadyen Maclean to conduct a jailhouse interview with Riel. Maclean obtained this by masquerading as a francophone Catholic cleric and interviewing Riel in French under the nose of uncomprehending anglophone watch-house guards. Growth and absorbing competitors The Leader Building, 13th Avenue and Hamilton Street, downtown Regina, c. 1910. Having begun with a small wooden shack before Regina had full streets, or electricity and plumbing outside Government House, The Leader soon moved to a substantial office building on the southwest corner of Hamilton Street and 11th Avenue, one block east of what was then the post office, southwest across street from City Hall. Also around this time, it was acquired by the Sifton family It then moved to a multi-story building across Hamilton Street to the south of the Simpson's department store. It ultimately relocated in the 1960s to east-city outskirts on Park Street at Victoria Avenue, where it still remains. The third Leader- Post building, Hamilton Street west of the Simpson's store In 1920, the Leader merged with another paper, the Regina Evening Post, itself in a building on Twelfth Avenue at Rose Street before the merger, and continued to publish daily editions of both before consolidating them under the title The Leader- Post in 1930. http://www.reginalibrary.ca/prairiehistory/highlights_education.html In 1922, the paper launched one of the oldest radio stations in Canada, CKCK. Five years paper, the company was purchased by the Sifton family, which launched CKCK-TV, Saskatchewan's first television station, in 1954. Newspapers were a thriving industry in the days through television's arrival in the 1950s until the Internet in the 1990s began to change people's gathering of news, compounded by the merger of local companies into ownership of local companies by national multi-corporation organizations. Other titles absorbed by the Leader-Post included the Regina Daily Star and The Province. In 1995, the Leader-Post released an electronic version of the newspaper so that subscribers could view their newspapers on the Internet. Electronic and daily print subscribers also enjoy access to extra content not available to all readers. Corporate ownership Decline of local news coverage radically occurred in 1996, when the paper and its sister, the Saskatoon StarPhoenix, were acquired from their owner, the Markham, Ontario-based Armadale group, by Hollinger Inc., a company then headed by then-Canadian media baron Conrad Black. Within three months, the staffs at each newspaper had been cut by one- quarter, these cuts becoming a cause c√©l√®bre in Canadian journalism. The event with substantial elimination of staff and coverage of local news corresponded with one at the Regina television station CKCK-DT, once locally owned but by 1985 no longer so. An immediate effect was a significant reduction in coverage of local and provincial news, and a greater coverage of national events. Loss of news reporter staff, the increasing television news coverage and the arrival and growth of the internet all increased difficulty in preserving, much less increasing, the Leader-Post significance. Black's company subsequently divested itself of the Leader-Post in 2000, together with most other Canadian news media it had owned, in conjunction with Black's renunciation of his Canadian citizenship in order to obtain an English peerage. Eventually branding itself as the Regina Leader-Post, the newspaper shut down its printing facilities in 2015 in favor of being printed in Saskatoon with the press of The StarPhoenix.  Circulation  Like most Canadian daily newspapers, the Leader-Post has seen a decline in circulation. Its total circulation dropped by percent to 34,136 copies daily from 2009 to 2015.

The demise of HIH is considered to be the largest corporate collapse in Australia's history, with liquidators estimating that HIH's losses totalled up to A$5.3 billion. Investigations into the cause of the collapse have led to conviction and imprisonment of a handful of members of HIH management on various charges relating to fraud. History In 1968, Ray Williams and Michael Payne formed \\"M W Payne Underwriting Agency Pty Ltd\\", which was acquired in 1971 by British company CE Heath PLC. Ray Williams was appointed to the board of CE Heath in 1980. The business operations of CE Heath were subsequently transferred to \\"CE Heath International Holdings Ltd\\" in 1989 with CE Heath PLC retaining 90% ownership of CE Heath International Holdings. In 1992, CE Heath International Holdings floated on the Australian Stock Exchange. In 1995, CE Heath International Holdings acquired CIC Insurance Group. The remaining 48% holding that CE Heath PLC maintained in CE Heath International Holdings was sold to a subsidiary of CIC Insurance Group called CIC Holdings Limited. CIC Holdings increased its share in CE Heath International Holdings to 50% and CIC Holdings was purchased by Winterthur Swiss Insurance Company (Winterthur Swiss). In May 1996, CE Heath International Holdings changed its name to HIH Winterthur. Through 1997 and 1998, HIH Winterthur acquired a large number of companies both in Australia and globally, including Colonial Ltd General Insurance's operations in Australia and New Zealand, Solart in Argentina and Great States Insurance Co in the United States. Most notably, however, HIH acquired the large Australian insurance company FAI Insurance, whose chief executive Rodney Adler became a director of HIH in 1999. Winterthur Swiss sold its 51% share in HIH Winterthur to the public and HIH changed its name to HIH Insurance Ltd. Collapse With $8 billion in assets, HIH was considered one of Australia's largest insurance firms. However, after offsetting its assets with debts and potential insurance claims against the company, HIH was left, on paper, with net assets of only $133 million. McGrath & Riddell described HIH's solvency as \\"marginal\\" and stated in their report that \\"an extremely small movement (just 1.7%) in the value of assets could move the balance sheet into net asset deficiency.\\" That is, even the slightest setback would cause the company to become insolvent. On 15 March 2001, the board of HIH appointed a provisional liquidator to take control of HIH and 17 of its controlled entities. The board hoped this would give HIH time to review its operations and assess its financial position. On the same day, HIH was to announce its first-half result for the six months to 31 December 2000. The announcement had already been delayed once and rumours suggested that HIH's first-half result was a loss of $100 million. This figure quickly ballooned to $200 million, and then $300 million. Although the result was never announced, when McGrath announced his appointment as provisional liquidator he estimated that HIH had lost over $800 million over the six months to 31 December 2000. He attributed the HIH company failures to rapid expansion, unsupervised delegation of authority, extensive and complex reinsurance arrangements, under pricing, reserve problems, false reports, reckless management, incompetence, fraud, greed, and self‚Äìdealing. Formal winding-up orders were made on 27 August 2001. By then HIH liquidators estimated the deficiency of the group to be between $3.6 billion and $5.3 billion. The demise of HIH was the largest corporate failure in Australia's history. HIH insurance is currently in run‚Äìoff, which means it is managing its outstanding claims and not writing any new business. This process could take several years to complete; some have suggested as long as 10 years. Royal Commission Following the failure of HIH, Prime Minister John Howard announced that a Royal Commission would be established to inquire into the company's collapse. Justice Neville John Owen headed the Royal Commission, which tabled its report to Parliament on 16 April 2003. The findings of the Royal Commission are available on the HIH Royal Commission web site. Criminal charges and sentences =Adler pleads guilty= Former HIH director Rodney Adler was sentenced on 14 April 2005 to four-and-a-half years in prison, with a non-parole period of two-and-a-half years. Adler's sentence came after pleading guilty on 16 February 2005 to four criminal charges, which included: *two counts of disseminating information knowing it was false *one count of obtaining money by false or misleading statements *one count of being intentionally dishonest and failing to discharge his duties as a director in good faith and in the best interests of the company The sentence was a lenient one, since the judge accepted the defendant's plea of mitigation, citing that he had not sold any of his own shares, or personally benefitted from his actions. Stock market manipulation Criminal charges for stock market manipulation were laid against Adler after an investigation by the Australian Securities & Investment Commission (ASIC) into the purchase of HIH shares by Pacific Eagle Equities Pty Ltd, an Adler-controlled company. Pacific Eagle Equities purchased 1,873,661 HIH shares on 15 June 2000, 951,339 HIH shares on 16 June 2000 and 425,000 HIH shares on 19 June 2000 (ASIC, 2002) with HIH funds after Adler persuaded Ray Williams to shift $10 million from HIH to Pacific Eagle Equities. Adler's defence team negotiated with the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to drop charges of stock market manipulation in exchange for a guilty plea to other charges (Elias, 2005). Disseminating false information Adler attempted to induce investors to purchase HIH shares by telling a finance journalist on 19 June 2000 and 20 June 2000 that he had purchased 1,873,661 HIH shares on 15 June 2000 and 951,339 HIH shares on 16 June 2000 for himself (ASIC, 2002). Adler also told the journalist that he believed the share price for HIH was undervalued and presented an opportunity for a quick profit (Elias, 2005). Intentionally acting dishonestly  In October 2000 a company in which Adler had an interest, Business Thinking Systems (BTS), was in financial trouble. Adler sought a $2 million investment from HIH. Williams had been told by Adler that the company had raised $2.5 million, which it had not, and that Adler was prepared to invest $500,000, which he had no intention of doing, if HIH invested $2 million in BTS. HIH executive John Ballhausen was then told by Adler that he had invested the $500,000. The HIH board discussed and approved the $2 million investment in BTS in a November 2000 meeting. Adler attended the meeting and failed to disclose his financial interest in the business. Nor did he disclose his knowledge of its financial affairs (Elias, 2005). On 13 October 2007 at 8:30 a.m., Adler was released from the St Heliers Correctional Centre in the Upper Hunter Valley on parole, after serving two-and-a-half years of his sentence. However, in November 2007, he faced court in a NSW civil case related to bonuses he recommended for executives of the failed telco One.Tel. Adler was on One.Tel's remuneration committee. =Other charges= On 15 April 2005, Ray Williams was sentenced to 4 years and 6 months' jail with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months, after pleading guilty to misleading shareholders about the financial position of HIH. Williams was also banned from leading an Australian corporation for ten years. On 14 January 2008, Williams was released from jail after serving just under three years. Sydney businessman Brad Cooper was sentenced in the Supreme Court on 23 June 2006, after a jury found him guilty on 13 charges relating to bribes he paid a senior HIH official to push through false claims in the months before the insurer's collapse. He was sentenced to 8 years' jail with a non-parole period of 5 years. Cooper reportedly admitted to having a cocaine addiction during his high-flying days when he worked as a motivational speaker and as a salesman. At the time he entered jail in October 2005, Australian media stated he reported to prison officials that he had further addictions to painkillers, dex-amphetamines, and was on a valium addiction program. Prior to his arrest, he had begun a relationship with Sascha Ricci Griffin, and she continued their relationship with visits to him in court and jail, until his release in late 2010. Cooper filed an appeal from jail against the severity of his sentence, but the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed the application in March 2009. On 21 November 2008 it was reported that a charge had been dropped against former HIH chairman Geoffrey Cohen a week before it was due to be heard in Sydney's Downing Centre Local Court. The decision by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions not to proceed followed a similar decision in February 2008 relating to a more serious charge. Both were laid in 2005. Both abandoned charges related to Cohen's address to shareholders at the HIH annual general meeting in December 2000. In the second charge, ASIC alleged Cohen did not take reasonable steps to ensure that the information he gave to the shareholders at annual meeting was not misleading about a joint venture between Allianz Australia Ltd (Allianz) and HIH. The first charge alleged Cohen knowingly misled investors. References Further reading *Westfield, Mark (2003). HIH: The Inside Story of Australia's Biggest Corporate Collapse.

The company was founded by Bruce West, who designed the logo, created the name and designed all the early vehicles. His concept was to create modern vehicles with the potential of mass advertising through the appeal of historic vehicles. In 1984, West sold the moulds to Hunnable Holdings of Yeldham, Great Yeldham, Essex. Asquith \\"Vintage\\" Van used as ice-cream selling facility at the Stoomfestival (Steam festival) in Stoomcentrum Maldegem, a heritage railway in Belgium, in the town of Maldegen Mr West started building \\"retro-style\\" delivery vans on the Ford Transit chassis in 1982. In 1991, the company announced production of a 1930s-style taxi cab that would meet the London Public Carriage Office regulations on a purpose-built chassis. Originally based in Braintree in Essex, Asquith employed 30 full-time craftsmen who handmade over 1,000 vehicles, many exported to countries as far away as Paraguay, Japan and USA, though Germany has always been the biggest export market. In the late 1990s after the sale to Hunnables, the company experienced some challenges. The cost of manufacture had increased, research and development on new vehicles including the London Taxi had spiralled and a large Japanese order was cancelled due to increases in the exchange rate. The company was forced into receivership. The company was purchased from the liquidators by Mike Edgar in 1997. He built a team of designers led by Paul Keegan and engineers led by Eddie Parsons. Further investment was required to move the company forward and Edgar soon found that UK manufacture was too expensive and sought partnerships in other countries. At the time, relationships were established with third-party companies in Barcelona (Spain) and Katowice (Poland). In 2003, the molds and intellectual property rights were purchased by Simon Rhodes and Asquith Motors was established to develop new versions of the original vehicles. Due to various quality, language and distance issues with the overseas companies, it was decided to stop them manufacturing further vehicles. In 2005, Asquith Motors bought the assets of the 'Vintage Motor Company Ltd', based in Doncaster. The main assets included The Royale Windsor (a 1940s-style limousine) and The Royale Sabre (a 1940s-style sports car). These are due to manufactured in the future. In 2009, Asquith Motors appointed John Barlow, a well known and respected car designer and engineer, to develop new moulds for the Shire and Mascot, to be based on the Iveco Daily chassis. Launch of these vehicles was due in early 2010 and enquiries had been received from companies all over the world, who appreciated the classic style to advertise their business. No such model was ever produced though. As of September 2020, the website claims to have three new products in development; The Mascot eight seater bus, the smaller Shetland electric van and numerous vintage style trailers. These will be based on Iveco Daily commercial vehicles. No official launch date is set, apart from a twitter post in June 2019 announcing that the \\"New Asquith Shire is coming soon...\\".

Fathalishah, Fathali Shah, Fath Ali Shah; 25 September 1772 ‚Äì 23 October 1834) was the second Shah (king) of Qajar Iran. He reigned from 17 June 1797 until his death. His reign saw the irrevocable ceding of Iran's northern territories in the Caucasus, comprising what is nowadays Georgia, Dagestan, Azerbaijan, and Armenia, to the Russian Empire following the Russo-Persian Wars of 1804‚Äì1813 and 1826‚Äì1828 and the resulting treaties of Gulistan and Turkmenchay., page 728 Historian Joseph M. Upton says that he \\"is famous among Persians for three things: his exceptionally long beard, his wasp-like waist, and his progeny.\\" At the end of his reign, his difficult economic problems and military and technological liabilities took Iran to the verge of governmental disintegration, which was quickened by a consequent struggle for the throne after his death. Early life Fat·∏•- ªAli Shah Qajar He was born in Damghan on 25 September 1772, and was called Fat·∏•-  ªAli, a name which his great-grandfather, a prominent figure bore. He was the son of Hossein Qoli Khan Qajar, brother of Agha Mohammad Khan. He was also known by his second name of Baba Khan, a name he would use until his coronation in 1797. Fath Ali Shah By Armin Mehrabi Fat·∏•- ªAli was governor of Fars when his uncle was assassinated in 1797. Fat·∏•- ªAli then ascended the throne and used the name of Fath Ali Shah (with the word \\"shah\\" added on his name). He became suspicious of his chancellor Ebrahim Khan Kalantar and ordered his execution. Hajji Ebrahim Khan had been chancellor to Zand and Qajar rulers for some fifteen years. Much of his reign was marked by the resurgence of Persian arts and painting, as well as a deeply elaborate court culture with extremely rigid etiquette. In particular during his reign, portraiture and large-scale oil painting reached a height previously unknown under any other Islamic dynasty, largely due to his personal patronage. Fath Ali also ordered the creation of much royal regalia, including coronations chairs; the \\"Takht-e Khurshƒ´d\\" or Sun Throne; the \\"Takht-e NƒÅderi\\" or Naderi Throne, which was also used by later kings; and the \\"TƒÅj-e KiyƒÅni\\" or Kiani Crown, a modification of the crown of the same name created by his uncle Agha Mohammad Khan. The latter, like most of his regalia, was studded with a large number of pearls and gems. In 1797, Fath Ali was given a complete set of the Britannica's 3rd edition, which he read completely; after this feat, he extended his royal title to include \\"Most Formidable Lord and Master of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.\\" In 1803, Fat·∏•- ªAli Shah appointed his cousin Ebrahim Khan as the governor of the Kerman Province, which had been devastated during the reign of Agha Mohammad Khan. Russo-Persian wars =Russo-Persian War (1804‚Äì1813)= The siege of Ganja Fortress in 1804 during the Russo-Persian War (1804‚Äì1813) by the Russian forces under leadership of general Pavel Tsitsianov. During the early reign of Fath Ali Shah, Imperial Russia took control of Georgia, a territory which Iran had ruled intermittently since 1555 with the Peace of Amasya. Georgia, led by Erekle II, had forged an alliance with Persia's rival, Russia, following the Treaty of Georgievsk. To punish his Georgian subjects, his uncle, Agha Mohammad Khan, had invaded and sacked Tbilisi, seeking to reestablishing full Persian suzerainty over Georgia, in which he succeeded. Even though the Russian garrisons in the city had to retreat, Persia didn't manage to put back all of its needed garrisons over the country as Agha Mohammad Khan was assassinated soon afterwards in Shusha, following with Russia's act of annexation of those priorly-Iranian ruled parts of Georgia in 1801, after many Georgian embassies and a treaty. Also, not only was Georgia annexed but also was Dagestan invaded, which had also been under Persian rule since the early Safavid era. As it was seen as a direct intrusion into Persian territory, Fath Ali Shah, determined to reassert Persian hegemony over the whole region, declared war on Russia after General Pavel Tsitsianov attacked and stormed the city of Ganja, massacring many of its inhabitants and forcing many thousands to flee deeper within the Iranian domains. In 1804, Fath Ali Shah ordered the invasion of Georgia in order to regain it, under pressure from the Shia clergy, who were urging a war against Russia. The war began with notable victories for the Persians, but Russia shipped in advanced weaponry and cannons that disadvantaged the technologically inferior Qajar forces, who did not have the artillery to match. Russia continued with a major campaign against Persia; Persia asked for help from Britain on the grounds of a military agreement with that country (the military agreement was signed after the rise of Napoleon in France). However, Britain refused to help Persia claiming that the military agreement concerned a French attack not Russian. General Gardane, with colleagues Jaubert and Joanin, at the Persian court of Fath-Ali Shah in 1808. Persia had to ask for help from France, sending an ambassador to Napoleon and concluding a Franco-Persian alliance with the signature of the Treaty of Finkenstein. However, just when the French were ready to help Persia, Napoleon made peace with Russia. At this time, John Malcolm arrived in Persia and promised support but Britain later changed its mind and asked Persia to retreat. Though many years the war had been stale and located in various parts of Transcaucasia, the peace with Napoleon enabled the Russians to increase their war efforts in the Caucasus against Iran. In early 1813, under General Pyotr Kotlyarevsky, the Russians successfully stormed Lankaran. Russian troops invaded Tabriz in 1813 and Persia was forced to sign the Treaty of Gulistan with Russia. Treaty of Gulistan Georgia, Dagestan, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, before being forced to cede the territories to Imperial Russia per the two Russo-Persian Wars of the 19th century. On account of consecutive defeats of Persia and after the fall of Lankaran on 1 January 1813, Fath Ali Shah, was forced to sign the disastrous Treaty of Gulistan. The text of treaty was prepared by a British diplomat; Sir Gore Ouseley; and was signed by Nikolai Fyodorovich Rtischev from the Russian side and Hajji Mirza Abol Hasan Khan from the Iranian side on 24 October 1813 in the village of Gulistan. By this treaty all of the cities, towns, and villages of Georgia, villages and towns on the coast of the Black Sea, all of the cities, towns and villages of the Khanates in the South Caucasus and North Caucasus, and part of the Talysh Khanate, including Megrelia, Abkhazia, Imeretia, Guria, Baku khanate, Shirvan Khanate, Derbent, Karabakh khanate, Ganja khanate, Shaki Khanate and Quba Khanate became part of Russia.John F. Baddeley, The Russian Conquest of the Caucasus, Longman, Green and Co., London: 1908, p. 90 These territories altogether comprise modern-day Georgia, southern Dagestan, and most of the contemporary Azerbaijan Republic. In return, Russia pledged to support Abbas Mirza as heir to the Persian throne after the death of Fath Ali Shah. =Interlude on a different front= Between 1805 and 1816, Qajar rulers began invading Herat in neighboring Afghanistan with small detachments. The Persians were attempting to retake control of the city but were forced to abandon it due to Afghan uprisings. In 1818 the Shah sent his son Mohammad Vali Mirza to capture the city but he was defeated at the Battle of Kafir Qala. =Russo-Persian War (1826‚Äì1828)= Battle of Ganja, 1826, Franz Roubaud. Part of the collection of the Museum for History, Baku. In 1826, 13 years after the Treaty of Gulistan, the Shah on the advice of British agents and the utter dissatisfaction with the outcome of the previous war, Fath Ali Shah decided to occupy the lost territories. Crown prince Abbas Mirza, head of the armies, invaded the Talysh Khanate and Karabakh khanate with an army of 35,000 on 16 July 1826. The first year of the war was very successful, and the Persians managed to regain most of their lost territories of the 1804‚Äì1813 war, including the principal cities of Lenkoran, Quba, and Baku.William Edward David Allen and Paul Muratoff.

In May 1827, Ivan Paskevich, Governor of Caucasus, invaded Echmiadzin, Nakhichevan, Abbasabad and on 1 October Erivan. Fourteen days later, General Eristov entered Tabriz. In January 1828, when the Russians reached the shores of Lake Urmia, Abbas Mirza urgently signed the Treaty of Turkmenchay on 2 February 1828. Treaty of Turkmenchay The Turkmenchay Treaty was signed on 21 February 1828 by Hajji Mirza Abol Hasan Khan and General Ivan Paskevich. By this treaty the Erivan khanate (most of present-day Armenia, and also a small part of Eastern Anatolia), Nakhchivan khanate (most of the present-day Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan), the Talysh Khanate (southeastern Azerbaijan), and the Ordubad and Mughan came under the rule of Imperial Russia. By this treaty, Iran had lost all of its Caucasian territories comprising all of Transcaucasia and Dagestan to neighboring Imperial Russia. Iran furthermore pledged to pay Russia 10 Million in Gold, and in return Russia pledged to support Abbas Mirza as heir to the Persian throne after the death of Fath Ali Shah. The treaty also stipulated the resettlement of Armenians from Persia to the Caucasus, which also included an outright liberation of Armenian captives who were brought and had lived in Iran since 1804 or as far back as 1795. Later life firman in Shikasta Nasta ølƒ´q script, January 1831. Fath Ali later employed writers and painters to make a book about his wars with Russia, inspired by the Shahnameh of Ferdowsi. This book, considered by many to be the most important Persian book written in the Qajar period, is called the Shahanshahnama. In 1829, Alexandr Griboyedov, the Russian diplomat and playwright was killed in the encirclement of the Russia embassy in Tehran. To apologize, the Shah sent prince Khosrow Mirza to Tsar Nicholas I to deliver a formal apology, as well as one of the biggest diamonds of his crown jewelry, namely Shah Diamond. When his beloved son and crown prince Abbas Mirza died on 25 October 1833, Fath Ali named his grandson Mohammed Mirza as his crown prince. Fath Ali died a year later, on 23 October 1834. He is instantly recognizable in all 25 known portraits ‚Äì mainly due to his immense, deeply black beard, which reached well beneath his narrow waist. One of these portraits is being exhibited in the collection of the University of Oxford. Another one that of which artist was Mihr Ali is at the Brooklyn Museum. Besides eulogistic chronicles, the only real sources that allow us to judge his personality are those of British, French and Russian diplomats. These vary greatly: earlier in his reign they tend to portray him as vigorous, manly and highly intelligent. Later they begin to point out his extreme indolence and avarice.Joseph M.

Prince Yahya, ca. the 1830s.Prince Yahya, born in 1817, was the forty-third son of the Qajar ruler Fath Ali Shah (r. 1798‚Äì1834). Brooklyn Museum Fath-Ali Shah is reported to have had more than 1,000 spouses. He was survived by fifty-seven sons and forty-six daughters, along with 296 grandsons and 292 granddaughters. A book published in England in 1874 provided different numbers: > \\"It is believed that Fetteh Ali had the largest number of children ever born > to a man. Like a pious Mohammedan, he had only four wives, but his harem > generally contained from 800 to 1,000 ladies. By these he had 130 sons and > 150 daughters, and it is believed that at the time of his death his > descendants numbered five thousand souls. The three grandsons who merit > notice were the sons of Hussein Ali, the governor of Fars, who aspired to > the throne. The princes, Riza Kuli Mirza, Nejeff Kuli Mirza, and Timour > Mirza, were at Shiraz when their father attempted to seize the throne. They > were able to make their escape from the city.\\" While this is a large number of children, the claim that Fat·∏•- ªAli holds the record is not true. (Moulay Ismail ibn Sharif, who lived a hundred years earlier in Morocco, is said to hold the record for the most number of children born to a man.) Fat·∏•-Ali's first son, Mohammad Ali Mirza Dowlat Shah, was seven months older than the second son Abbas Mirza. Yet it was the latter who was named \\"Wali-ahd\\" or crown prince. This was on account of the fact that Dowlat Shah's mother, Ziba Chehreh Khanoum, was of non-Qajar origin (she was Georgian woman), and therefore he was passed over in favour of his younger brother. ;Consorts * Ziba Chehar Khanum, a Georgian lady from the Tzicara Chwili family; * Badr Jahan Khanum, daughter of Muhammad Jafar Khan Bastami Arab; * Asiyeh Khanum \\"Mehd-i-aulya\\", daughter of Fath Ali Khan Davallu; * Nushafrin Khanum, a Zand lady; * Maryam Khanum, a Jewish lady from Mazandaran; * Hajiyeh Badr al-Nesa Khanum Badran, daughter of Mustafa Quli Khan Qajar Qavanlu; * Kheyr al-Nessa Khanum (Aay Baaji), daughter of Majnoun Khan Pazouki, daughter of Morteza Qoli Khan Qajar Qavanlu; * Tawus Khanum \\"Taj-al- Dawleh\\", a lady from a family from Shiraz or an Isfahani concubine; * Golbadan Baji Khanum \\"Khazen-ol-Dowleh\\", a Georgian concubine, originally a lady in service to Fath Ali Shah's mother; * Kulsum Khanum, a lady from the family of Sayyeds of Pazvar; * Begum Jan Khanum, a lady from Qazvin; * Agha Baji Begum, daughter of Ibrahim Khalil Khan of Karabakh; * A daughter of Sadiq Khan Shaqaqi of Sarab Khanate; * Gul Pirhan Khanum, an Armenian concubine from Tbilisi; * Humai Khanum, a Kurdish lady from Mazandaran; * A daughter of Imam Qoli Khan Afsar Urumi; * Sunbul Khanum, a prisoner taken by Agha Mohammad Khan; * Khatun Jan Khanum, sister of Gulrukh Khanum, wife of Farukh Khan Amin- al-Dawleh; * Mihr al-Nesa Khanum, sister of Mahmud Khan Dunbuli; ;SonsL.A.

The area of the anvil-shaped island, including fringing islets and rocks mainly in the northeast, but also a few smaller ones in the southeast, is . The highest elevation is Moumoukai Peak, at an elevation of . Although Raoul is the only island in the Kermadec group large enough to support settlement, it lacks a safe harbour, and landings from small boats can be made only in calm weather. The island consists of two mountainous areas, one with summits of and , and the other with a summit of , the two separated by a depression which is the caldera of the Raoul volcano. History Evidence from archaeological sites on the northern coast of Raoul Island indicate that Polynesian people settled there in the 14th century. A 1980 publication also suggested a lower layer of deposits dated to the 10th century but this was rejected by the paper's author in 1991 in favour of the later date. Finds at the sites included stone implements of the Polynesian type, obsidian flakes, shells and charcoal. Obsidian of the same type has been found at early Maori sites at Shag River and Tai Rua, Otago on the South Island of New Zealand and there are also similarities to the Raoul settlement at archaic sites at Houhora and Papatowai. Higham and Johnson (1997) concluded that Raoul was settled from New Zealand but that the Kermadecs were a stepping stone in an early and rapid Polynesian migration from Polynesia to New Zealand and back although the occupation of the islands was relatively brief.Higham, Thomas and Johnson, Leigh (Oct 1997) The Prehistoric Chronology of Raoul Island, the Kermadec Group.

The island was uninhabited when first sighted by Western sailors and was named after Joseph Raoul, quartermaster of the Recherche, when it was sighted on 16 March 1793. Captain William Raven of the whaler Britannia sighted the island on 6 March 1796 and called it Sunday Island, a name which was subsequently in common usage. Captain Henry Mangles Denham of HMS Herald charted the island in 1854. The last regular occupants, Tom Bell and his wife Frederica, spent thirty-six years on the island before the New Zealand government evacuated them in 1914.

From 27 May to 16 June 1917, the German raider Wolf, under the command of Korvettenkapit√§n Karl August Nerger, anchored in the protected bay to undertake engine overhaul and maintenance. During this period Wolf captured the New Zealand steamship Wairuna (3,950 tons) and the American sailing bark Winslow (570 tons), commandeering all cargo and coal from both ships. The New Zealand government has permanently manned Raoul Island Station since 1937. It includes a government meteorological and radio station and hostel for Department of Conservation (DOC) officers and volunteers. The station stands on the northern terraces of the island, about in elevation above the cliffs of Fleetwood Bluff. When the New Zealand government established a weather and radio station on the island in 1939 it made Raoul the official name, probably to avoid confusion with a number of Sunday islands in Australia. Raoul Island Station represents the northernmost outpost of New Zealand. Geography Raoul Island, looking towards the minor islands northeast Two Holocene calderas are found at Raoul. The older caldera, which cuts the center of Raoul Island, is about long and wide respectively. Denham caldera, formed during a major dacitic explosive eruption about 2200 years ago, truncated the western side of the island and is long and wide respectively. Its long axis is parallel to the tectonic fabric of the Havre Trough that lies west of the volcanic arc. Historical eruptions at Raoul during the 19th and 20th centuries have sometimes occurred simultaneously from both calderas, and have consisted of small-to-moderate phreatic eruptions, some of which formed ephemeral islands in Denham caldera. A high unnamed submarine cone, one of several located along a fissure on the lower NNE flank of Raoul volcano, has also erupted during historical time, and satellitic vents at Raoul are concentrated along two parallel NNE-trending lineaments. The Denham caldera was named for the nearby Denham Bay, itself named by Royal Navy Captain Henry Mangles Denham in HMS Herald, who came to complete a (chart) survey of the island on 2 July 1854. His son Fleetwood James Denham (16yrs) died from a tropical fever, and was buried near the beach at the head of Denham Bay, where a number of the grass-grown graves of former settlers were. The brass plaque heading this grave has been preserved. Three small lakes, Blue Lake (, about 40% overgrown), Green Lake () and Tui Lake (, drinking water quality) are located in the northern caldera of Raoul Island. The plains surrounding the lakes are called Pumice Flats. =Climate= Raoul Island has a humid subtropical climate. Flora and fauna The scientific categorisation of the flora and fauna of the island began in 1854 when , captained by Henry Mangles Denham, arrived to complete the charting of the island. He arrived on the 2nd and was occupied till 24 July, during which time he frequently had to move the ship on account of the rough weather experienced. William Grant Milne and John MacGillivray, naturalists on board the Herald, made a small collection of plants on Raoul. This was forwarded by Captain Denham to Sir W. Hooker, and was described by Sir Joseph Hooker in the Journal of the Linnean Society for 1857. A scientific expedition was undertaken by a group of naturalists to the Kermadec Islands in 1908. The expedition established its base at Denham Bay. During that expedition one of the naturalists, W. L. Wallace, discovered numerous new insect species including the beetle Saprosites raoulensis. Raoul is part of the Kermadec Islands subtropical moist forests ecoregion and is largely covered with closed-canopy forest, predominantly of the evergreen Kermadec p≈çhutukawa (Metrosideros kermadecensis) and the Kermadec nikau palm (Rhopalostylis baueri, formerly described as Rhopalostylis cheesemanii). It is just far enough south that the occasional fertile coconut from Polynesia that washes up on shore and takes root will not survive in the longterm due to a lack of warmth.International Palm Society The island has no native land mammals and was formerly home to vast colonies of seabirds who nested in the forests. The islands may once have had a species of megapode (based on early settler records) and a subspecies of kereru.Tennyson, A. & Martinson, P. (2006) Extinct Birds of New Zealand Te Papa Press, Wellington Currently native landbirds on the island include the Kermadec red-crowned parakeet (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae cyanurus), the Australasian harrier, pukeko, tui and several introduced species.C.

Tennyson (2004) \\"Birds of the Kermadec Islands, South- west Pacific\\" Notornis 51(2): 61‚Äì90 The island forms part of the Kermadec Islands Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because it is an important site for nesting seabirds.BirdLife International. (2012). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Kermadec Islands. Downloaded from on 3 February 2012. Polynesian visitors introduced the Polynesian rat in the 14th century and Norway rats, cats and goats were introduced by European and American visitors in the 19th and 20th centuries. The rats and cats greatly reduced the seabird colonies, which mostly withdrew to offshore islets, and exterminated the red-crowned parakeet, the last confirmed record of resident parakeets for over a century being made in 1836. Although the goats did not eliminate the tree canopy as they did on other islands, they greatly reduced the understorey vegetation and were removed in 1986. The Department of Conservation eradicated rats and cats between 2002 and 2006, following which red-crowned parakeets soon returned naturally, presumably from the Herald Islets, away. The parakeets had been absent from the island for 150 years and their natural return was a notable event in parrot conservation. There are numerous invasive plant species on the island and a large scale weeding programme involving teams of DOC workers and volunteers has been under way for a number of years in an attempt to eradicate them. Myrtle Rust has been found on the island in 2017. The island is part of the Kermadec Islands Marine Reserve, New Zealand's largest marine reserve, which was created in 1990.

At the time, Mark Kearney, a DOC worker, was at the crater taking water temperature measurements. A area around Green Lake was affected with ash, mud and boulders. Two DOC workers were forced to turn back after going to the crater to search for Kearney. Following the eruption, DOC decided to evacuate the remaining five staff members. A Mil Mi-8 helicopter and Piper PA-31 Navajo aircraft took off from Taupo at 11a.m. that morning. They arrived at the island in the late afternoon and undertook a 45-minute search for Kearney but no sign was seen. The evacuated staff members were brought back to Auckland that evening. A Royal New Zealand Air Force P-3 Orion made an overflight on 21 March to provide further information on how safe it is to approach Green Lake. The volcanologists aboard decided the area was still unsafe, and that the crater lake had risen by about compared to measurements taken on 17 March. There was no cloud or ash plume. A group of police, the five evacuated workers, three other DOC staff and scientific staff left Tauranga on 18 March for the three-day boat trip to Raoul aboard the RV Braveheart to recover Kearney's body. They were able to undertake a limited search, but decided that it was extremely unlikely that Kearney survived given the amount of devastation in the area around Green Lake. The Braveheart began the journey back to the mainland on 25 March, with three of the DOC workers staying on the island to continue research. The three were joined by the other four evacuated workers at the start of May 2006. Two of the three will return to the mainland after the handover. Five hours after the eruption, the Aura satellite passed over and found an estimated of sulfur dioxide had been released.Alert Bulletin, Raoul Island volcano , 24 March 2006 This confirmed that there were magmatic gases in the eruption, and the presence of degassing magma within the volcano. By the end of April, the activity in the area had decreased significantly and the \\"Alert Level\\" was lowered to 1.Alert Bulletin, Raoul Island volcano , 26 April 2006 HMNZS Te Mana left for Raoul on 24 August 2006 on a resupply mission. Also on board were Kearney's sister, Merryn McDermott; three representatives of the NgƒÅti Kurƒ´ iwi; and Chris Carter, the Minister of Conservation. During a service held on 28 August, the NgƒÅti Kurƒ´ representatives performed a tapu lifting ceremony. A plaque was erected to honour Kearney. Te Mana also allowed some volcanic monitoring to be undertaken using its SH-2G Super Seasprite helicopter. During a dawn flight, sample bottles were filled with crater lake water. A report by the New Zealand Department of Labour into the death was released on 14 October 2006. It cleared the Conservation Department and Geological and Nuclear Sciences of any negligence related to the death of Kearney. The report stated that the eruption was unpredictable and there was no indication of imminent seismic activity. As a geographically active 'hotspot', the Kermadec Islands also experience frequent earthquakes, the most recently significant of which occurred at 22:39 NZST on 16 May 2006.Magnitude 7.4 ‚Äì Kermadec Islands Region , United States Geological Survey The epicentre was approximately SSW from Raoul and measured 7.4 on the moment magnitude scale, and as such is classified as a 'major' earthquake by the United States Geological Survey. It was felt as far away as Christchurch, New Zealand some from the epicentre. Also of note on 31 January 2007 at 4:15:55 NZST a Magnitude 6.5 (Strong) earthquake shook the island. The epicenter was approximately S of Raoul and below the seabed. On 9 December 2007 at 8:28pm NZST a magnitude 7.6 earthquake shook the area, centered approximately north of Raoul Island at a depth of . On 30 September 2008 at 3:19:31 NZST a magnitude 7.0 earthquake centered S of Raoul occurred, with an approximate depth of . More recently on 22 October 2011 at 05:57:17 NZST a Magnitude 7.4 earthquake originating at 28.941S 176.045W at a depth of 39 km occurred according to the United States Geological Survey. July 2011 7.6 earthquake 7 July 2011 ‚Äì 7:03am. A 7.6 Magnitude earthquake occurred at a depth of 24 km, 211 km east of Raoul Island. 7 July 2011 ‚Äì 8:51am Pacific Tsunami Warning Center scientist Barry Hirshorn told Newstalk ZB the quake generated a 1.9 metre tsunami at Raoul Island. October 2011 7.4 earthquake 22 October 2011 ‚Äì 5:57pm. A 7.4 magnitude earthquake occurred at a depth of , east of Raoul Island. The Ministry of Civil Defence had issued the advisory while it assessed the severity of the threat to New Zealand. The Ministry was warning people in coastal areas to stay off beaches and out of the water. People were advised to avoid sightseeing and remain on alert in case the earthquake has generated a tsunami, however by mid-morning warnings had lifted.  Mihai Muncus-Nagy  Department of Conservation volunteer Mihai Muncus-Nagy, a 33-year-old biologist from Romania, went missing on Raoul Island on 2 January 2012. He went to Raoul at the end of October 2011. His vehicle and gear were found close to where he was carrying out water temperature readings on the morning of 2 January 2012. The remaining staff and volunteers searched the shore, but did not find any further signs of him. A helicopter was sent to Raoul by the Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand (RCCNZ) from Taupo, New Zealand, to carry out an aerial search. A DOC boat was also used in the search. Muncus- Nagy was presumed drowned. Auckland District Court found the Department of Conservation culpable in his death for failing to ensure his safety.

It is near the border between the Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol regions in the foothills of the Alps, and about equidistant (60 km) from the major cities of Trento to the west and Vicenza to the south. The Asiago region is the origin of Asiago cheese. The town was the site of a major battle between Austrian and Italian forces on the Alpine Front of World War I. It is a major ski resort destination as well as the site of the Astrophysical Observatory of Asiago, operated by the University of Padua. Geography =Climate= The Town of Asiago.

Battle of Asiago Alpine-War 1915-1918 Monument in Asiago. The Battle of Asiago (Battle of the Plateaux) was a counter-offensive launched by the Austro-Hungarians on the Italian Front in May 1916, during World War I. It was an unexpected attack that took place near Asiago (now in northeast Italy, then on the Italian side of the border between the Kingdom of Italy and Austria- Hungary). Commemorating this battle and the fallen soldiers of World War I is the Asiago War Memorial, a monument and museum that is a popular site for visitors to the area. Ernest Hemingway fought here. In a later engagement in 1918, Edward Brittain, brother of Vera Brittain, was killed and was buried in the Granezza British military cemetery on the plateau. In 1970 Vera's ashes were scattered on his grave.

Most commonly, a seneschal was a senior position filled by a court appointment within a royal, ducal, or noble household during the Middle Ages and early Modern period ‚Äì historically a steward or majordomo of a medieval great house.Oxford University Press: SeneschalEncyclopaedia Perthensis; or Universal Dictionary of the Arts Volume 20 (1816), p. 437 In a medieval royal household, a seneschal was in charge of domestic arrangements and the administration of servants,The Free Dictionary: Seneschal. which, in the medieval period particularly, meant the seneschal might oversee hundreds of laborers, servants and their associated responsibilities, and have a great deal of power in the community, at a time when much of the local economy was often based on the wealth and responsibilities of such a household. A second meaning is more specific, and concerns the late medieval and early modern nation of France, wherein the seneschal () was also a royal officer in charge of justice and control of the administration of certain southern provinces called seneschalties, holding a role equivalent to a northern French bailiff ('). Finally, in the United Kingdom primarily, seneschal is an ecclesiastical term, referring to a cathedral official.\\"seneschal\\" Via the Free Dictionary. Collins English Dictionary ‚Äì Complete and Unabridged, 12th Edition 2014 HarperCollins Publishers Origin The term, first attested in 1350‚Äì1400, was borrowed from Anglo-Norman seneschal \\"steward\\", from Old Dutch *siniscalc \\"senior retainer\\" (attested in Latin siniscalcus (692 AD), Old High German senescalh), a compound of *sini- (cf. Gothic sineigs \\"old\\", sinista \\"oldest\\") and scalc \\"servant\\", ultimately a calque of Late Latin senior scholaris \\"senior guard\\". The scholae in the late Roman Empire referred to the imperial guard, divided into senior (seniores) and junior (juniores) units. The captain of the guard was known as comes scholarum.Leo Wiener, Commentary to the Germanic Laws and Mediaeval Documents (Harvard UP, 1915; reprint Union, NJ: Lawbook Exchange, 1999), 33-4. When Germanic tribes took over the Empire, the scholae were merged or replaced with the Germanic king's warband (cf. Vulgar Latin *dructis, OHG truht, Old English dryht) whose members also had duties in their lord's household like a royal retinue.D. H. Green, Language and History in the Early Germanic World (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1998), 110-2. The king's chief warbandman and retainer (cf. Old Saxon druhting, OHG truhting, truhtigomo OE dryhtguma, dryhtealdor), from the 5th century on, personally attended on the king, as specifically stated in the Theodosian Code of 413 (Cod. Theod. VI. 13. 1; known as comes scholae).Wiener, 34. The warband, once sedentary, became first the king's royal household, and then his great officers of state, and in both cases the seneschal is synonymous with steward. In France In late medieval and early modern France, the seneschal was originally a royal steward overseeing the entire country but developed into an agent of the crown charged with administration of a seneschalty (), one of the districts of the crown lands in Languedoc and Normandy. Hallam states that the first seneschals to govern in this manner did so by an 1190 edict of Philip II. The seneschals also served as the chief justice of the royal courts in their areas. The equivalent post throughout most of northern France was the bailiff ('), who oversaw a bailiwick ('). * William de Gometz was Seneschal of France .. * Osbern the Steward was seneschal to two dukes of Normandy.

The case inspired William Peter Blatty to write his novel The Exorcist. Life Halloran was born in Jackson, Minnesota, in 1921. He was the oldest of nine children. He became a student at the Campion Jesuit High School in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, in 1934.Campion Graduate Notables... He was a member of the school's football team. In 1941, he became a member of the Society of Jesus. Halloran attended St. Louis University and in 1954 was ordained a priest, and two years later began teaching theology and history at his old school the Campion Jesuit High boarding school in Prairie du Chien, while also coaching football. In 1963 he moved to Marquette University, where he taught history until 1966 when he volunteered for chaplain duty with the United States Army. He first served in Germany but in 1969, at the age of 48, he volunteered for paratrooper training and then for duty in Vietnam where he would say he saw more evil than in the boy's hospital bed back in 1949.

Conflicts and threats For farmers in the 200 villages along the Bandipur forest periphery, the national park is a vast pasture for grazing cattle and for collection of firewood and other forest produce. The reserve holds nearly 150,000 cattle. The Nugu wildlife sanctuary and Himavad Gopalaswamy range located in the north-west of the park are the most used by cattle. NH 67 through Bandipur National Park There are fears of possible transmission of diseases from cattle to wildlife. In 1968, large numbers of gaur were killed in an outbreak of rinderpest. Lantana bush introduced by British in the 19th century in tea gardens has spread rapidly at the cost of other valuable herbs and saplings. This bush is thorny, attracts mosquitoes, is not eaten by any herbivores and rapid spread has caused other species of fauna to vanish which is staple food for wild life. Rapid spread of Parthenium (Parthenium hysterophorus) has severely damaged bio-diversity and typical landscapes of this beautiful jungle is making way for this invasive weed. Elephants which traditionally migrate from dry to moist zones now increasingly come into contact with human habitations and farms are often damaged. Sugarcane crops are particularly attractive to them. Elephant Trying to Cross the NH 67 The National Highway (NH-181) &( NH-212 ) passes through Bandipur national park. This road has been a major concern as speeding vehicles have killed many wild animals in spite of frequent warnings to travelers from the forest department officials and restriction on movement of vehicles in some stretches between 6 P.M to 6 A.M. This has raised fears of extinction of habitat of wild animals exclusively found in this national park. On October 9, 2018 the National Park lost one of its prized possession, a tusker named 'Rowdy Ranga' hit by a bus in the night. After which the government of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka agreed to ban night traffic in the forest. However, Kerala condemns the 'Night Ban' and has asked for the ban to be lifted to save a reroute that increases the distance by 45 km.

In Russia, the term \\"liberal\\" can refer to wide range of politicians ‚Äì( for reference check NCERT class 9 chapter socialism and Russian revolution) simultaneously to Thatcherism/Reaganomics-related pro-capitalism conservative politicians (they are related to 1990s shock therapy \\"liberal\\" reforms), to centre-right liberal politicians (as in European political spectrum) and to left-liberal politicians (as in the US political spectrum). The term \\"liberal democrats\\" is often used for members of the far-right nationalist part, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. There are Russian opposition and pro-government liberal political parties in Russia. Pro-government liberal politicians support Putin's policy in economics. There are no liberal factions in Russian parliament at the moment. Centre-left liberalism was represented in the State Duma of Russian parliament by the Russian United Democratic Party \\"Yabloko\\" (7.86% in 1993 election, 6.89% in 1995, 5.93% in 1999). Pro-government liberalism was represented by the Our Home ‚Äì Russia (10.13% in 1995 election), the liberal political party founded by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Centre-right liberalism was represented by the pro-capitalist party Democratic Choice of Russia (15.51% in 1993) and its successor, the Union of Right Forces (8.52% in 1999 election). The Yabloko and the Republican Party of Russia ‚Äì People's Freedom Party are members of Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party. The Yabloko is also a member of Liberal International. Liberalism in the Russian Federation =History= Liberalism emerged in Russia before the Russian Revolution and continued to develop among Constitutional Democrats such as Pavel Miliukov living in exile after 1917. After the fall of communism, several new liberal parties were formed, but only one of them Yabloko (Yabloko ‚Äì Rosiyskaya Demokraticheskaya Partiya, a member of Liberal International) succeeded in becoming a relevant force. This is a left-of-center liberal party. The Union of Right Forces (Soyuz Pravykh Sil, a member of International Democrat Union) is a right-of-center liberal party. It can also be seen as a democratic conservative market party. In this scheme, the party is not included as liberal, being considered a democratic conservative party, but it can also be called liberal because of its pro-free- market and anti-authoritarianism stances.

His ideas were discussed and elaborated by such 19th-century liberal republican radicals as Alexander Herzen, Boris Chicherin, and Konstantin Kavelin.

Background The Get Up Kids evolved out of the breakup of Kingpin, which consisted of high school friends guitarist Jim Suptic, bassist Rob Pope and his brother drummer Ryan Pope. After that group's demise, vocalist/guitarist Matt Pryor formed Secret Decoder Ring with Suptic,Sharpe- Young 2005, p. 317 before they broke up after a six months. Pryor and Suptic started working with Rob Pope, who invited college friend drummer Nathan Shay to form The Get Up Kids in 1994. Following this, the group self financed the 7\\" single \\"Shorty\\", which would sell over 2,000 copies. Shay moved to St. Louis, Missouri to focus on his studies, eventually leaving the group in April 1996. Ryan Pope joined initially on a temporary basis as there was concern with having both brothers in the band, and with Suptic and Pope not getting along in the past. The group recorded two additional releases: one for Florida-based Outback Records, while the other was for Rhode Island-based Contrast Records. After recording four songs, the group sent copies of them to rock-centic labels listed in the publication The Musician's Guide To Touring and Promotion. The songs caught the attention of Ohio-based Doghouse Records, who was interested in signing the band. They wanted to release a 7\\" vinyl EP as a precursor to an album. Instead of recording another release, the group paid for the Outback release and issued it through Doghouse as the Woodson EP. The group subsequently signed a two-album recording contract with Doghouse.Shea 2009, event occurs at 2:48‚Äì55 Recording Four Minute Mile was recorded in April 1997 on a budget of $4,000Shea 2009, event occurs at 34:27‚Äì8 with Shellac bassist Bob Weston acting as producer. Instead of recording at Red House Recordings, which they had used for the previous EP, they opted to track the record at the Chicago Recording Company.Shea 2009, event occurs at 34:31‚Äì40 As Ryan Pope was still at school, the members went to a local music store to stock up on guitar strings and plectrums. They ended up running over a rock, and later found out it punctured the car's exhaust manifold, causing carbon monoxide to circulate through the car and had to travel with the windows down.Shea 2009, event occurs at 35:02‚Äì23 The members waited in the parking lot of Pope's school, before he got in the car and they drove to Chicago.Shea 2009, event occurs at 34:49‚Äì59 The recording sessions took place over the course of two and a half days from a Friday night to 3am on a Sunday.Shea 2009, event occurs at 35:25‚Äì32 When making the Woodson EP, the group tracked four songs and mixed them within one and a half days. They thought that since they were able to do four in one day, they would be able to do eleven in two and a half days for Four Minute Mile. As a result, some of the songs featured the low quality production that the EP had; Pryor later stated they should have spent more time recording it, while Suptic said it \\"sounds like crap\\". The short recording time was due to recording budget and also so that Pope wouldn't miss school the following day.Shea 2009, event occurs at 35:36‚Äì7 Pryor said Weston acted more in the vein of an engineer than a producer: \\"He's kind of like, 'Do you like how it sounds?' 'OK, yeah, it's cool.\\"Shea 2009, event occurs at 36:12‚Äì20 Weston mixed the recordings in a four-hour session.Shea 2009, event occurs at 37:03‚Äì5 Release As the members had an album coming out, they came to the decision to take a year off from school to do the band full-time. Suptic and Pryor worked with Joe Winkle of Boys Life at Linda Hall Library. The pair learned that Boys Life were touring and used their contacts, coupled with Pryor's copy of Maximumrocknroll Book Your Own Fucking Life guide, and started working on a touring route. This led the pair to Bob Nanna of Braid, who were also booking a tour in the same timeframe following the same route, deciding to go on tour together.Shea 2009, event occurs at 38:30‚Äì39:10 In June 1997, the group went on a US tour with Braid and Ethel Meserve. During this tour, the Get Up Kids played a show in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania with Coalesce, who they became friends with. Four Minute Mile was released on September 30. Further tour outings included an east coat and southern tour with Jejune and Mineral in September, west coast tour with No Knife in October and November, and concluded the year with a north east tour with Jimmy Eat World in December. Ryan Pope had planned to go college, until Doghouse offered to fund a European tour, which took place in February and March 1998 with Braid. The following month, they embarked on a southern tour, and a west coast tour with Braid in May. Following this, the group took a break, before eventually going on a nationwide tour supporting MxPx and Home Grown in October. After the conclusion of this tour, Coalesce drummer James Dewees joined as a keyboardist.Sharpe-Young 2005, p. 318 A remastered version of the album was released by Doghouse Records in 2001. This was largely a way of capitalizing on the recent success of the band's second album, 1999's Something to Write Home About, which rocketed the band to international stardom. In December 2008, Doghouse re-pressed the album on vinyl. Doghouse reissued the album, alongside The EP's: Red Letter Day and Woodson compilation, on cassette in 2017. Reception and legacy The album helped the band develop a national fanbase, as well as garnering a bidding war over the band from several major labels, including Geffen Records, Sub Pop Records and Mojo Records. The band ended up signing with Mojo, but was quickly disappointed with their choice when the label asked the band to re-record the song \\"Don't Hate Me\\", feeling that the label was underestimating their potential. Four Minute Mile is considered a benchmark album of the emo genre, influencing the likes of Saves the Day, the Early November, Midtown and Fall Out Boy.Shea 2009, event occurs at 3:13‚Äì22 In a 2005 interview with Alternative Press magazine, Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy remarked that the album had a major influence on the band as a whole. \\"The first time I heard [The Get Up Kids] was around Four Minute Mile. I was in high school. There was an honesty and sincerity [to the album]. It seemed more about the fact that this music was \\"emotional,\\" than an actual sound than labeled them\\".

Liberalism in the country is primarily represented by the centre-right Liberal Party.Monsma and Soper, p. 95. The Liberal Party is a fusion of liberal and conservative forces and are affiliated with the conservative centre-right International Democrat Union. The term \\"\\" is often used to distinguish philosophical liberals from members of the Liberal Party. Introduction Some of the earliest pioneers of the federation movement, men such as Alfred Deakin, came under the influence of David Syme of The Age. Other influencers of federalism included Samuel Griffith who while initially was seen as a supporter of the labour movement became partisan against the Labour movement with his legal intervention in the 1891 Australian Shearers' strike. While all of these men were generally self- described \\"liberals\\" their understanding of liberalism differed substantially. Deakin in particular was considered a radical who was disliked by both the traditional conservative Tory of the city and the squatting class of Australia. The degree of progressive sentiments also varied from colony to colony: social liberals such as David Syme were prominent in Victoria while others were prominent in South Australia, for instance. At any rate, Australia's parliamentary institutions, especially at a national level, were brand-new, so it was difficult for anyone to be labelled \\"conservative\\" in a traditional sense. The two largest political parties, the Free Trade Party and the Protectionist Party, could both loosely be described as \\"liberal\\" in the terms of the time. They were moderates with a strong belief in parliamentary institutions, financially orthodox and attached to the British Empire, with a distaste for radicalism. The third major political force was the trade union movement represented by Australian Labor Party. The rise in popularity of the Labor party began to become the major pre-occupation of these two other parties. In the early stages of the parliament, the Labor party engaged in a partnership with the more radical Protectionists, but Labor's wide-ranging policies for social reform met with only lukewarm support from most Protectionists. Fear of socialism became widespread among the ranks of the establishment, and as the question of tariffs was settled, there was increasing pressure on the non-Labor parliamentary forces to unite in opposition to Labor. The result was the Fusion in 1909, composed of Joseph Cook's Anti-Socialist Party (formerly Free Trade Party), and conservative Protectionists. The Fusion soon began calling itself the Liberal Party, proclaiming its adherence to classical liberalism. After Deakin's departure, the fervent anti-socialist Joseph Cook became leader of the party and it became the dominant right-wing force in Australian politics. The pattern of a non-Labor party defining itself as liberal rather than conservative and deriving support from a middle-class base continued to the formation of the present-day Liberal Party, founded in 1945 and led initially by Sir Robert Menzies. Malcolm Fraser, quoting from Menzies' memoir, Afternoon Light, described the decision to call the party \\"Liberal\\" in these terms, > We chose the word 'Liberal' because we want to be a progressive party, in no > way conservative, in no way reactionary. However, previous Liberal Prime Minister, John Howard, is reported to have described himself the most conservative leader the Liberal Party had ever had. The \\"wet\\" (moderate) and \\"dry\\" (conservative) wings of the Liberal party co- operated fairly harmoniously, but in the early 1970s as conservatives started to dominate in South Australia liberals led by Steele Hall broke off to form the Liberal Movement. In 1977, other dissident small-l liberal forces led by Don Chipp created the Australian Democrats. Contemporary Australian liberalism From the early 1990s, monetarism and social conservatism has characterised the Liberal Party's actions in Government and policy development. Former Prime Minister John Howard in a 2005 speech described the modern position: > The Liberal Party is a broad church. You sometimes have to get the builders > in to put in the extra pew on both sides of the aisle to make sure that > everybody is accommodated. But it is a broad church and we should never as > members of the Liberal Party of Australia lose sight of the fact that we are > the trustees of two great political traditions. We are, of course, the > custodian of the classical liberal tradition within our society, Australian > Liberals should revere the contribution of John Stuart Mill to political > thought. We are also the custodians of the conservative tradition in our > community. And if you look at the history of the Liberal Party it is at its > best when it balances and blends those two traditions. Mill and Burke are > interwoven into the history and the practice and the experience of our > political party. Federal \\"small-l liberals\\", such as Joe Hockey and Malcolm Turnbull were Cabinet ministers in the Howard government. Christopher Pyne , George Brandis and Bruce Billson served in the outer ministry. In 2018, members of this grouping made up the substantial majority of senior cabinet and ministry positions in the government of small-l liberal Turnbull. At the state level, \\"small-l liberals\\" have substantial influence particularly in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. The Democrats, fractured under the leadership of Cheryl Kernot and Natasha Stott-Despoja, moved to the left. Party leader Meg Lees formed the more avowedly centrist Australian Progressive Alliance in 2003. In 2002, Tasmanian Liberal candidate Greg Barns was disendorsed following comments opposing Government action taken over the Tampa affair. Barns joined the Australian Democrats, with the view of returning a strong liberal platform to the party. Ideology The governments of Menzies (1949‚Äì1966), Gorton (1968‚Äì1971) Fraser (1975‚Äì1983) and Howard (1996‚Äì2007) differed from each other in both social and economic approaches. Unifying threads of Australian liberalism, have included: *Opposition to communism. *Support for private enterprise. Previous Liberal party governments, especially under pressure from the Country Party in safeguarding its agricultural base, have been interventionist to varying degrees; but the current climate is very much in favour of deregulation and Monetarism *Opposition to major changes to the Australian Constitution. Once again, this varies: the Democrats, and quite a few Liberal Party members, support a republic. The Liberals and Democrats have shown much more affection for the Senate than has Labor. *In foreign policy, loyalty to Australia's major allied partner (the United Kingdom before World War II, the United States afterward), sometimes to the detriment of multilateralism. \\"Small-l\\" liberals often tend to repudiate this aspect: the Democrats were strongly critical of both Iraq Wars and Fraser, despite supporting it while in office, has called for an end to the ANZUS alliance.

History During the 1980s, superstrats were becoming popular amongst the many hard rock and metal guitarists, who needed the modifications to suit their individual playing styles. Soon, many guitar manufacturers began producing instruments with these modifications as standard. Most notable were the manufacturers Ibanez, Jackson/Charvel, Carvin and Yamaha. However, Fender itself had limited success thereabout. This was partially due to Fender's previous CBS ownership, which caused a drastic loss in Fender's quality and market share. The Showmaster was hence its most recent foray into the superstrat niche, and was introduced in 1998. Gene Baker, a master builder of Fender's Custom Shop at the time, was responsible for the creation of this set-neck, carved top version. Early Showmaster models (prototypes) were originally labeled as Stratocasters on their headstocks and are very rare. The Custom Shop Showmaster perimeter was a design supplied by John Suhr, another Senior master builder during that era. It started out as a US version of the Contemporary Stratocaster and featured two Fender Texas Special pickups in the neck and middle positions, a Seymour Duncan '59 Jeff Beck Trembucker in the lead position, a white pearloid pickguard and a deluxe locking tremolo bridge. Later after Suhr left it was turned into a back-routed carved set neck by Gene Baker. Suhr's new company Suhr Guitars actually cut the first 100 bodies for Fender. Construction :Note: In descriptions of pickup configurations, H refers to humbuckers and S refers to single-coils. The Fender Showmaster initially started as a Custom Shop model. It featured a carved maple top with hand scraped edges and cream binding, a set-neck maple neck (bolt-on on some models), a sleek mahogany body (many Showmaster guitars are made from basswood or alder; later models such as the Showmaster Elite, employ more exotic woods such as lacewood and spalted maple for the top and back), HSS or HH pickup configurations which consisted of Seymour Duncan '59 Trembucker humbucking pickups coupled with a pair of Fender Custom Shop Fat '50s single-coils. Other features included a rosewood or maple fingerboard with abalone inlays and 22 frets, as well as a choice of deluxe locking tremolo bridge, deluxe 2-point synchronized bridge with pop-in tremolo arm and stop-tail bridge (some Team Built one-off Showmasters came with the original Floyd Rose locking system and featured a lightweight ash body and a translucent Amber finish). Later, it appeared as a U.S. Special/Highway 1 model, retaining the set maple neck, Fender Enforcer humbuckers, a special \\"kill\\" switch and its traditional Stratocaster headstock (with Showmaster label, respectively), equipped with a Floyd Rose licensed vibrato and a 2-octave rosewood fingerboard. Some later Showmasters--such as the Elite--were produced in Korea, followed by Squier variants (formerly known as Stagemasters) featuring a basswood body, a reverse headstock, Floyd Rose licensed locking systems and Duncan Designed humbucking pickups. All Showmaster carved top models featured back-routed controls like most superstrats and came with a choice of bridges, abalone-inlaid rosewood fretboards with 24 frets, Seymour Duncan pickups, locking machine heads, and an LSR roller nut. The Blackout version came with a graphite nut, no fretboard inlays and Fender humbuckers instead of Seymour Duncans. The main distinguishing feature of Fender Showmasters--with the exception of the Flat Head--from other superstrats is the luxurious carved (quilted and flamed) maple top with the hand-scraped edges and cream binding. The Showmaster series also included a short-lived 7-string version with a stop-tail bridge that had been introduced around 1999/2000 and discontinued two years later. The most distinct feature of the Showmaster Elites was the inclusion of a black-painted Telecaster-shaped headstock with pearloid tuner buttons. In 2009, all Showmaster models were discontinued. File:Showmaster-jason-ellis.jpgJason Ellis signature File:Showmaster-rally-stripe.jpgRally Stripe File:Showmaster- skull-crossbones.jpgSkull & Crossbones Squier models Squier, Fender's budget marque, also produced the Showmaster. Most Squier Showmasters were made in China and retailed for $499. The line included a Jason Ellis signature model. There were Squier Showmasters marked \\"Crafted in Indonesia\\" as well (specs: HSS, 22 frets, rosewood fretboard, standard 2-point vibrato). A few Korean made Squier neck-thru V4 Stagemasters were re-branded Squier Showmasters in 2002 when Fender dropped the Stagemaster name due to a trademark claim by Kramer. It is not known exactly how many V4 neck-thrus were made with the Showmaster brand.

It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament.

The term is generally used only with a reference to a particular policy area, e.g. \\"market liberalism\\" or \\"social liberalism\\". In its extreme form it can be known as \\"libertarianism\\", although this term is used less in New Zealand than in some other countries. Some historians claim that liberalism was a dominant force in New Zealand until around 1936, citing the strong position of the Liberal Party. However, there is (and always was) debate as to whether the Liberal Party was actually liberal‚Äîaccording to some observers, it would be better described as \\"socialist\\", although this was a common accusation made against early 20th century liberals, around the world. Today, there is no party which is universally recognised as \\"the party of liberalism\\", although there are parties which attempt to claim this title‚ÄîACT New Zealand, for example, has labelled itself as \\"the Liberal Party\\".

An academy of sciences is a type of learned society or academy (as special scientific institution) dedicated to sciences that may or may not be state funded. Some state funded academies are tuned into national or royal (in case of the United Kingdom i.e. Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge) as a form of honor. The other type of academies are Academy of Arts or combination of both (e.g., American Academy of Arts and Sciences). In non-English-speaking countries, the range of academic fields of the members of a national Academy of Science often includes scholarly disciplines which would not normally be classed as \\"science\\" in English. Many languages use a broad term for systematized learning which includes both natural and social sciences and fields such as literary studies, linguistics, history, or art history. (Often these terms are calques from Latin scientia (the etymological source of English science) and, accordingly, derivatives of the verb 'know', such as German Wissenschaft, Swedish vetenskap, Hungarian tudom√°ny, Estonian teadus or Finnish tiede.) Accordingly, for example the Austrian Academy of Sciences (√ñsterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften), the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (Magyar Tudom√°nyos Akad√©mia), or the Estonian Academy of Sciences (Eesti Teaduste Akadeemia) also cover the areas of social sciences and humanities. As the engineering sciences have become more varied and advanced, there is a recent trend in many advanced countries to organize the National Academy of Engineering (or Engineering Sciences), separate from the national Academy of Sciences. Academies of science play an important role in science diplomacy efforts. Academies are increasingly organized in regional or even international associations. The Interacademy Partnership for example is a global network consisting of 111 national science academies. Additionally, there are many regional associations such as ALLEA in Europe, NASAC as the Network of African Science Academies, IANAS in Latin America and AASSA in Asia. Apart from national academies of science, there are now increasingly also national young academies. National young academies usually select members for a limited term, normally 4‚Äì5 years, after which members become academy alumni. Young academies typically engage with issues important to young scientists. These include, for example, science education or the dialog between science and society. Most young academies are affiliated with a senior Academy of Sciences or with a network of senior academies. The Global Young Academy, which itself is a science academy (e.g. full member of Interacademy Partnership) often serves as a facilitator of the growing global network of young academies. Since its creation, more than 35 national young academies have been established. In 2019, there were 41 national young academies.

Milwaukee Deep, also known as the Milwaukee Depth, is part of the Puerto Rico Trench. Together with the surrounding area, known as Brownson Deep, the Milwaukee Deep forms an elongated depression that constitutes the floor of the trench.

Media outlets overwhelmingly referred to the area as the Brownson Deep, while the name Milwaukee Deep was used by others.

Two models were made. History The 1937 car used Albert Gough's somewhat erratic 4-cylinder overhead-cam 1496 cc 78 bhp and 1996 cc 98 bhp engines with three valves and two spark plugs per cylinder which had been previously fitted to some Frazer Nashes where Gough had worked. An Arnott supercharged version was also available. Three or four- speed gearboxes were offered. The car had a tubular steel chassis and all round independent suspension using coil springs. Two-seat open sports and two- seat drophead coup√© bodies built by Abbott were available. From 1938 the car could be had with a 4¬∑3-litre V-12 Lincoln-Zephyr engine giving 112 bhp which proved to be the more popular. The car had a 3-speed gearbox. A four-seat version on a slightly longer chassis was made as well as the two-seaters. A 1496cc version raced in the 1938 Le Mans 24 hour race driven by Charles Morrison & Neil Watson (one of the company founders). The car retired with a broken driveshaft. The cars were very expensive and the outbreak of war stopped production after only about 20 cars were made. The company continued in existence making pumps and becoming Atalanta Engineering Ltd. RGS Atalanta Richard Gaylard Shattock revived the name after the Second World War with the RGS Atalanta, offering complete cars with fiberglass bodywork or parts kits until 1958. Lea-Francis, Ford and Jaguar engines were used, at least 1 car was equipped with an Aston Martin DB2/4 2.6 L or 3 L triple SU H6 carburettor engine. 1939 Atalanta 2 litre Roadster ex Midge Wiltby team car; body by Abbott of Farnham. In the late 1930s there was also an open sports version of the Atalanta, with a huge 7L American side-valve engine and an 8- position, gated gear change. Also a smaller-engined open sports version using an OHV engine with a blower. Other cars with the Atalanta name There was another unconnected Atalanta company based in Greenwich, London which built a few 9 hp four-cylinder cars from 1916 to 1917. Atalanta was a name also used on a car made by the rather mysterious Owen of London, England in about 1910. This company existed between 1899 and 1935 but seems to have made very few if any cars. Atalanta was also a sports-tourer version of the 20/25 hp Armstrong Siddeley line, sold between 1936 and 1938.Bill Smith: Armstrong Siddeley Motors; Veloce, Dorchester UK, 2006, pp.343-344 A new sports car manufactured by Atalanta Motors Ltd of Staffordshire was shown in 2012 and at the 2014 Hampton Court Palace Concours d'Elegance.

Background and development The Atla was a project of Jacques Durand, who served as chief designer and assistant engineer. Prior to starting work on the Atla Durand made small-displacement engines for motorized toys and later began using the engines in his own line of scale-models of sports cars like the Jaguar D-Type and the Mercedes-Benz 300SL. In 1957 he visited the workshops of Chappe et Gessalin to see what was involved in producing automobile bodywork in fibreglass and soon progressed to making a body for a full-sized car of his own design. It was Durand who named the car the \`Atla' (\\"A.T.L.A.\\" in some references). Development of the prototype took place in Durand's workshop in the cellar of his family's home in Antony. This was where the molds that would be used for laying up the fibreglass body were made and the first chassis was fabricated. It is said that Durand had to demolish the staircase going to the basement of the house to get the first car out of the workshop. Durand designed a small berlinette whose shape drew on cars that he had already produced as scale-models. The Atla's nose was reminiscent of the D-type and it had \\"portes papillon\\", or gull-wing doors like those on the 300SL. The car rode on a custom chassis that was designed for it by an acquaintance of Durand's named Charles Cusson. Cusson engineered a tubular steel space-frame that was very rigid and weighed approximately . Jean Schwab, who had a Renault dealership in Garches, not only handled sales of the car but also provided the financial support needed to put the car into full production and even supplied some of the necessary Renault parts used in building the car. Robert Jonet, who worked for Schwab, was transferred to the Atla shop full-time to assist in painting and trimming the cars. Schwab, who was a part-time racing driver, used his contacts to have the prototype Atla tested by the French automotive press. The magazine \\"l'Automobile\\" featured the car in an in-depth article and on its cover in its Issue 147 of July 1958. Feedback from these evaluations was used by the Atla team to make changes to the car before it went into production. Production of the car was moved from Durand's workshop in Antony to Garches. Atla Renault Powering the car was Renault's Billancourt engine, mounted behind the rear wheels in a rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout. The Atla could be bought in kit form or as a completed car. Two levels of kit were available. A basic kit included a bare body shell with the doors, hood and rear hatch mounted on hinges and the chassis with all attachment points and cost 250,000 Francs. A more complete kit could be had that included a painted body and an upholstered interior. This kit also came with all handles, a wiring loom and a fuel tank already installed. This version cost 650,000 Francs. Complete cars were offered in four different versions; two standard and two competition. A completely assembled Atla Type 750 used the version from the Renault 4CV that produced , and came with a 3-speed manual transaxle. The Atla Type 850 used the engine from the Renault Dauphine that developed , and also had a 3-speed manual transaxle. The 750 model weighed just and the 850 model was slightly heavier at . The first competition version, called either the Monza or Rally, also had a 750 cc engine but came with a 4-speed manual transaxle. The highest performance version was called the Sebring, and it came with an 850 cc engine and a 4-speed manual transaxle. A 5-speed transaxle was an option. Engines in the Monza/Rally and Sebring models were tuned by Autobleu and received Solex 32mm carburetors, performance camshafts, larger valves and new valve springs, modified cylinder heads and custom exhaust systems. These changes raised power output for the 750 to and as much as for the 850. The competition cars were slightly heavier than the standard cars. Atla Panhard At least one car was built with Atla bodywork and the air-cooled boxer-twin engine and transaxle from a Panhard Dyna Z in a front-engine, front-wheel-drive configuration. Apart from that the number built and attribution of the Atla Panhard is debated. Some references say that the Panhard drive-train was a factory option, and that six cars were built by them at a second assembly location in Malakoff. Others report that only one such car was built at the request of one specific customer. Uncorroborated claims have been made that it was built by another company and used the Atla body but a chassis from another car. An Atla Panhard was reported to be in the United States for several years before being repatriated to France. Release to end of production The prototype was complete by 1957 and the car went into production the next year. The Type 750 was priced at 860,000 Francs and the Type 850 cost 950,000 Francs. At a time when a Renault 4CV cost 419,000 Francs, a Dauphine 574,000 Francs and the larger Fr√©gate 929,000 Francs the Atla was competitively positioned in the market. After sales of about 20 cars the factory reviewed their production costs and increased the price of the car significantly, to 1,000,000 Francs. This major price increase caused orders to essentially stop, crippling the finances of the company. Production of the Atla ended shortly after, having only been built for little over one year. The total number of Atlas built is estimated to have been fewer than thirty cars. After the Atla project ended Durand went on to design several other cars, the first of which was the Sera. He and Cusson also partnered on another short- lived car project called the ALPA years later. Atla in motorsports An Atla made several appearances in the short film \\"Au Rallye de Gen√®ve\\" of 1959. An Atla-Renault was raced for several seasons in Sweden.

In addition to symphony concerts, the OSR performs as the opera orchestra in productions at the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Gen√®ve. Ernest Ansermet founded the OSR in 1918, together with Paul Lachenal, with a contingent of 48 players and a season of six months' duration. Besides Swiss musicians, the OSR players initially came from other countries, including Austria, France, Germany and Italy. Ansermet gradually increased the percentage of Swiss musicians in the orchestra, attaining 80% Swiss personnel by 1946. He remained the music director of the OSR for 49 years, from 1918 to 1967. A Swiss radio orchestra based in Lausanne was merged into the OSR in 1938. Subsequently, the OSR began to broadcast radio concerts regularly on Swiss radio. The orchestra had a long-standing contract for recordings with Decca Records, dating from the tenure of Ansermet, and made over 300 recordings for Decca, starting in 1947 with Debussy's La mer. The OSR premiered many works of the Swiss composers Arthur Honegger and Frank Martin. During the directorship of Armin Jordan (1985‚Äì1997), the OSR continued to make recordings on the Erato label. From 2005 to 2012, Marek Janowski was the artistic director and music director of the OSR. He conducted the OSR in recordings for the Pentatone label.

Investigations are headed by the \\"Cheaters Detective Agency\\". It began airing in 2000, and has aired 19 seasons so far. It has been hosted by Tommy Habeeb, Joey Greco, and Clark James Gable.  Show format  Actor Joey Greco was the show's longest-running host, hosting from late 2002 to mid-2012 and returning in 2019. On season 13, he was replaced by Clark James Gable, grandson of Clark Gable host till passing in 2019. The show's complainants can be either married or long-term significant others, and have included both opposite-sex and same- sex couples. Each episode begins with a brief interview of the complainant, detailing how the complainant met their partner and what has led them to believe that the partner is cheating, explaining suspicious activities or behavior. Next, the narrator (originally Robert Magruder, then Ken Eaken since 2015) describes the progress of the investigation of the partner (referred to as \\"the suspect\\"). Private investigators follow the suspect over the course of several days or weeks at their home, workplace, and/or in public with their alleged paramour (dubbed \\"the companion\\"). Occasionally, hidden cameras are installed in the complainant's and suspect's home. One or more recorded telephone conversations between the complainant and suspect, in which the suspect lies about his or her whereabouts, are also played. When the investigation turns up enough evidence of the suspect's infidelity, the show enters its second segment, \\"the confrontation.\\" The host meets with the complainant and shows them the evidence collected (originally on a video camera, then on an iPad). Graphic footage from the investigators‚Äîfor example, the suspect and their companion engaged in a sexual act‚Äîis shown uncensored to the complainant but digitally blurred to the show's viewers; however, uncensored versions of the trysts have been released on DVD. The briefing takes place when the suspect and their companion are concurrently being observed together nearby; the intent is to allow the complainant to catch the suspect in the act of infidelity. After contacting the detective on his cell phone to find out their whereabouts, the host and the complainant, along with a full crew of production personnel all carrying 35 mm cameras, and security personnel travel in a van and seek out and confront the alleged cheater. The confrontation often takes place in public places, such as bars, restaurants and parks, with the complainant and host both trying to get an explanation out of the suspect for their behavior. Confrontations are often violent in nature, forcing security guards to restrain the complainant, suspect and/or companion and have the potential to end badly, as one episode where host Joey Greco was stabbed during a confrontation. However, it has been suggested that the stabbing incident was staged. Suspects also have been known to push the security guards, which causes the security guards to push back and let them know that they will retaliate.http://www.insideedition.com/investigative/853-inside-edition- investigates-cheaters In very rare cases, animals unwittingly featured will have their heads blurred out for humorous effect. The final segment, \\"the conclusion,\\" presents parting thoughts from the complainant, the suspect and their companion as they depart the scene of the confrontation. Next, updates from previous cases, including interviews from suspects and their companions, are presented. Lastly, the narrator describes what became of the complainant, the suspect and the companion (and in rare cases, others that may also be involved) after the show. History The show was created by Bobby Goldstein, an attorney in Dallas, Texas. It made its debut in 2000. The original host of the show was actor Tommy Habeeb aka \\"Tommy Grand\\" (2000‚Äì2002). 2004 brought syndication reruns of previous seasons, edited into a half-hour Monday- through-Friday strip format with new intros by Joey Greco as host. When Cheaters began airing in high-definition, the show's title card, used for eleven seasons, was altered to 3D, and more high-definition graphics were incorporated into the show. Syndication Cheaters airs on Saturday nights on The CW Plus. It also aired on G4TV from 2006 to 2012. The CW Plus airs two episodes: a one-hour-long episode followed by a 30-minute episode. A 10-minute version of the show called Cheaters: Amazing Confrontations is available through on-demand services. In 2006, G4 began showing the strip version with faster-paced editing and music due to complaints that the show seemed boring and contrived, as well as a different narrator, for weekly airings on its Midnight Spank block. On December 9, 2009, G4 moved this show to the short- lived \\"Junk Food TV\\" block. G4 stopped airing the show December 2012. On January 2017, the syndicated half-hour strip format version of Cheaters returned to cable television, this time on VH1 during late Friday nights/early Saturday morning slots. Cheaters also re-aired on MTV2. Controversy and incidents In 2002, the Houston Press tracked down several people who said they were paid $400 per show by one of the detectives of the agency to act on the show, and were paid $50 per referral of other actors. One performer said, \\"What [the show's private detective] told me was that some of the episodes are real, but... they would do these ringer episodes to supplement the show.\\" The show's private investigator denies that he staged anyone's scenario and further added that the number of inquiries the agency receives made this unnecessary. The producers of Cheaters currently reiterate the reality of each episode in a legalistic message at its end, though a Federal Communications Commission representative confirmed to the Houston Press that \\"there's no law or regulation against presenting acted-out scenarios as reality on television.\\" Tuesday, October 8, 2019 On December 16, 2005, four employees of the show, the host Joey Greco, director Hunter Carson and two security guards, were indicted on charges of restraining a woman. On November 9, 2006, the four were acquitted. In another episode, Greco was detained at the scene of a bachelor party while helping a man confront his cheating fianc√©e. After Greco explained the situation about the couple to police, he was given a short talk about disturbing the peace and released with a written warning. On November 3, 2009, Inside Edition reiterated the claim that the show was staged, citing several more actors who said they were paid to appear. One of them appeared in the Greco stabbing episode and claimed it was staged. Despite the depiction of a male being placed under arrest for stabbing Greco, Inside Edition found that no actual arrest matching that description was made by the Rowlett, Texas police department, where the episode took place. The ambulance shown, along with the EMS personnel appeared to be from \\"Greater Dallas EMS\\". Greater Dallas EMS was a private transfer ambulance in the Dallas area but would have never been dispatched for a 911 emergency. They are now out of business after being raided by the FBI in an investigation known as Operation Easy Rider. Physician‚Äìpatient privilege would prevent the hospital that treated Greco from releasing records to Inside Edition. Nothing prevents the producers of Cheaters from voluntarily displaying the records, yet they have not done so. Despite the lack of records, Goldstein denied in an interview that the episode was staged. In a follow-up, aired on Inside Edition the following week (November 9, 2009), Greco was interviewed by investigative reporter Matt Meagher about the previous week's accusations. Greco declined to respond, claiming that he could not legally do so. On August 8, 2010, an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission press release reported that Bobby Goldstein Productions, Inc., and Cheaters II, Ltd. (Civil Action No. 3:08-CV-1912-P) paid $50,000 to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit. The suit was brought on the behalf of two female office assistants who were the target of frequent sexual jokes and comments, unwanted physical advances, and propositions for sex. The alleged perpetrators included members of upper management. Says attorney Robert A. Canino, a regional attorney from the EEOC Dallas District Office, \\"just because the creator of Cheaters promotes a TV show business which thrives on featuring sexual transgressions, it is no justification for engaging in sexual improprieties which violate the employment rights of his female employees behind the scenes.\\" Merchandise  Visual Entertainment of Canada has released several best-of collections of Cheaters on DVD in Region 1. In addition the Cheaters Spy Shop was launched in September 2011 to sell items used on the show and has been promoted in episodes beginning in the Season 12.'Cheaters' Now Offers Spy Products With the Launch of Cheaters Spy Shop, GlobeNewswire ‚Äì October 4, 2011 Cheaters DVD releases are uncensored, with language and sexual content (including occasional views of acts such as fellatio and penetration) shown unfiltered. References in pop culture The show has been parodied and referenced in several films and television shows, such as Janky Promoters (2009), George Lopez, Disturbia (2007), Sex Drive (2008), Just Go With It (2011), Mind of Mencia, TV: The Movie (2007), Talkshow with Spike Feresten, Workaholics, Unhitched, The Simpsons, and The Jay Leno Show. In the song Need It, released in 2020, Offset from Migos sings during the chorus:\\"Then I leave her, I can not get caught up, I can not be on Cheaters\\". Referencing his past, Offset seeks to avoid an appearance on Cheaters.

At the 2006 census, its population was 773, in 198 families. Domab is located between the three cities of Khvansar, Najafabad and Golpayegan. Domab is approximately 2140 meters above sea level. Located on the southern slope of Dalan mountain, Domab is irrigated via seasonal rivers. Choghagodar is also nearby. The village contains a museum with 200 artifacts, a library, computer center and film center. There is also a cultural house in the village.  History  Domab was referred to as Sabz Darreh Morad Abad in ancient documents. In those times, the settlement of Moradabad was most likely the nearest settlement to the Domab area. The cleaning of the Domab aqueduct led to the discovery of a stone lamp with Ostad Sha‚ÄôBan 1112 engraved on it. It is assumed that Domab became a permanent settlement between the years 1100 and 1150 A.D. The founders of the village are thought to be two brothers, named Moheb and Saleh, who began the families of Mohebian and Salehian. The farm at Domab and its surrounding region were at first rented from Dehagh. After World War II, inflation became a problem in the region, and quarrels broke out between Domab and neighboring settlements of Eshen, Rahmatabad, and Khundab. There was also agricultural rioting, recorded in the village historical register. Haj Hassan Domabi, said to be the son of Moheb, led the settlers of Domab to purchase the land from Dehagh. They registered the settlement as a village in the division of Isfahan. Haj Hassan implemented the construction of foundation plans for the settlement, a local bath, and a mosque. Eventually, for the establishment of security in the region, a large castle was constructed, presumed to be the largest castle in the region. Although smaller castles had existed prior to this one, the new castle provided additional security against highwaymen and plunderers. A few decades after this, there were internal problems in the village, due to arguments between the Mirzabi tribe and the Mohebi tribe. Externally, there were issues too; the main reasons for these arguments were economic, but also social issues as well. Lack of water and ownership rights on land contributed to these problems, but on these issues, the Mirzabi and the Mohebi banded together to defend the village. There is a historical story about Domabian people that tells there were all with tails after the fight with Mongoliasm; However it is not true.

Flach was born in K√∂nigsberg. He became a member of the liberal LDP (in the Soviet zone of Germany) and worked in 1948/1949 for the LDP newspaper Norddeutsche Zeitung in Schwerin. In October 1949 he fled to West-Berlin and became a member of the FDP. In 1949-1953 he studied political science. In 1956 he started to work for the federal headquarters of the party and had important campaign jobs in 1957 and 1961. But in 1962 he left the party organisation for the Frankfurter Rundschau, a leading newspaper then considered liberal. From 1971 on he worked again for the FDP, this time as secretary-general of chairman Walter Scheel. Being elected to the Bundestag in 1972 he became vice chairman of the Bundestag party. Flach died prematurely in Frankfurt, aged 43, in 1973 after having suffered a stroke a month before. Flach belonged to the left wing of his party and is considered an important contributor to social liberalism. He was one of the authors of the left liberal Freiburger Thesen, a programmatic paper the party accepted at its congress in October 1971. They stand for the turn to the left the party started in 1968 to become more independent from the conservatives and have a coalition with the social democrats (1969-1982).

As a musical term, sonatina has no single strict definition; it is rather a title applied by the composer to a piece that is in basic sonata form, but is shorter and lighter in character, or technically more elementary, than a typical sonata.Collins Music Encyclopedia (1959: William Collins & Co. Ltd.): sonatina The term has been in use at least since the late baroque; there is a one-page, one-movement harpsichord piece by Handel called \\"Sonatina\\".Oxford Companion to Music by Percy A. Scholes (1938, 1978 et al.).: O.U.P.: sonatina. It is most often applied to solo keyboard works, but a number of composers have written sonatinas for violin and piano (see list under Violin sonata), for example the Sonatina in G major for Violin and Piano by Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k, and occasionally for other instruments, for example the Clarinet Sonatina by Malcolm Arnold. The title \\"Sonatina\\" was used occasionally by J.S. Bach for short orchestral introductions to large vocal works, as in his cantata Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit, BWV 106, a practice with precedent in the work of the earlier German composer Nicolaus Bruhns.All Music Guide to Classical Music, Backbeat Books (2005). p. 55. This is the only sense in which Bach used the term sonatina, although he composed many chamber and solo sonatas for various instruments. As with many musical terms, sonatina is used inconsistently. The most common meaning is a short, easy sonata suitable for students, such as the piano sonatinas of Clementi. However, by no means are all sonatinas technically undemanding, for example the virtuoso sonatinas of Busoni and Alkan, and the Sonatine of Ravel, whose title reflects its neo-classical quality. On the other hand, some sonatas could equally have been called sonatinas: for example Beethoven's Op. 49, titled by the composer \\"Zwei Leichte Sonaten f√ºr das Pianoforte\\" (\\"Two Easy Sonatas for Piano\\") comprise only two short movements each, a sonata-allegro and a short rondo (No. 1) or minuet (No. 2), all well within the grasp of the intermediate student. However, other works titled \\"Sonatina\\", such as the Sonatina in F major, have been attributed to Beethoven. In general, a sonatina will have one or more of the following characteristics: brevity; fewer movements than the four of the late classical sonata; technical simplicity; a lighter, less serious character; and (in post-romantic music) a neo-classical style or a reference to earlier music. Muzio Clementi's sonatinas op. 36 are very popular among students. The first (or only) movement is generally in an abbreviated sonata form, with little or no development of the themes. For this reason, a sonatina is sometimes defined, especially in British usage, as a short piece in sonata form in which the development section is quite perfunctory or entirely absent:Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online: sonata the exposition is followed immediately by a brief bridge passage to modulate back to the home key for the recapitulation. Subsequent movements (at most two) may be in any of the common forms, such as a minuet or scherzo, a slow theme-and-variations, or a rondo.

Education He graduated in law and press- and communication sciences, and obtained a PhD in moral philosophy at the University of Ghent. He is professor Media and ethics at the University of Ghent. On 1 July 2010 he obtained the degree of Doctor of Moral Science at the University of Ghent with his doctoral dissertation \\"Pius XII and the extermination of the Jews. A moral and historical research into the moral responsibility of Pope Pius XII regarding the Final Solution to the Jewish Question.\\" Think tank He is a member of Liberales, an independent think tank within the liberal movement. Its members consider liberalism as a progressive movement supporting individual freedom, justice and human rights. Liberales reacts against what it calls \\"narrow minded conservatism\\" related to social economic, ecological and ethical issues supported by \\"compartmentalized\\" parties and structures. Writings With his book Het menselijk liberalisme (Human Liberalism), he inspires politicians in Belgian liberal parties as well as in the Dutch parties Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie and Democraten 66. He defends liberalism against attacks by anti- globalists, by stating that liberalism implies/should imply solidarity and that green politics is not contradictory to liberalism. He wrote the books Pleidooi voor het individualisme (A Plea for Individualism) and De derde feministische golf (The Third Feminist Wave), much of it focusing on Islamic feminism and its impact in Europe. This book contains exclusive interviews with Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Irshad Manji, Naima El Bezaz, , and Yasmine Allas.

The tax was abolished by the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923, which outright prevented all Chinese immigration except for that of business people, clergy, educators, students, and some others.Morton, James. 1974. In the Sea of Sterile Mountains: The Chinese in British Columbia. Vancouver: J.J. Douglas. The Tax Through the mid- to late nineteenth century, some 17,000 labourers were brought from China to do construction work on the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), though they were only paid a third or a half less than their co-workers (about $1/day). The provincial legislature passed a strict law to virtually prevent Chinese immigration in 1878. However, this was immediately struck down by the courts as ultra vires ('beyond the powers of') the provincial legislative assembly, as it impinged upon federal jurisdiction over immigration into Canada.Todd, Alpheus. [1894] 2006. Parliamentary Government in the British Colonies (2nd ed.). Clark, NJ: The Lawbook Exchange. . p. 194. Responding to anti- immigration sentiment in British Columbia, the federal parliament passed the Chinese Immigration Act in 1885, which stipulated that all Chinese entering Canada must first pay a $50 fee, later referred to as a head tax. This was amended in 1887, 1892, and 1901, with the fee increasing to $100 in 1900 and later to its maximum of $500 in 1903. However, not all Chinese arrivals had to pay the head tax; those who were presumed to return to China based on the apparent, transitory nature of their occupation or background were exempt from the penalty. These included arrivals identifying themselves as: students, teachers, missionaries, merchants, or members of the diplomatic corps. Not only did the Government of Canada collect about $23 million ($ in 2016 dollars)Canadian inflation numbers based on: \\"Consumer Price Index, annual average, not seasonally adjusted.\\" Statistics Canada. 18 January 2019. Retrieved 6 March 2019. table 18-10-0005-01 (formerly CANSIM 326-0021); \\"Consumer Price Index by product group, monthly, percentage change, not seasonally adjusted, Canada, provinces, Whitehorse, Yellowknife and Iqaluit.\\" Statistics Canada.

Such was achieved through the same law that ended the head tax: the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923, which stopped Chinese immigration entirely, albeit with certain exemptions for business owners and others. It is sometimes referred to by opponents as the Chinese Exclusion Act, a term also used for its American counterpart. Redress After the Chinese Immigration Act was repealed in 1948, various community activists including Wong Foon Sien campaigned the federal government to make its immigration policies more inclusive. However, the redress movement did not begin until 1984, when Vancouver Member of Parliament (MP) Margaret Mitchell raised in the House of Commons of Canada the issue of repaying the Chinese Head Tax for two of her constituents. Over 4,000 other head tax payers and their family members then approached the Chinese Canadian National Council (CCNC) and its member organizations across Canada to register their Head Tax certificates and ask CCNC to represent them to lobby the government for redress. The redress campaign included holding community meetings, gathering support from other groups and prominent people, increasing the media profile, conducting research and published materials, making presentations at schools, etc. The Chinese Canadian National Council, the longtime advocate [for/against] the head Tax redress, suffered a split after the Tiananmen Square Massacre. The CCNC had strongly condemned the human-rights record of the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Don Lee and his friends, who supported the PRC's assault on the protesters in Tiananmen Square, formed the National Congress of Chinese Canadians (NCCC). Don Lee, a former Vancouver NPA city councillor and the son of a deceased head-tax payer, has \\"acknowledged that some people see head-tax payers as victims, but he disagrees with this interpretation.\\" Lee said his father had the \\"'foresight' to pay the head tax and suffer the economic consequences, because it provided tremendous benefits to his descendants.\\"Head-Tax Issue Causes DivisionHead-Tax Payer Rejects MP's Proposal for Apology In 1993, then-prime minister Brian Mulroney made an offer of individual medallions, a museum wing, and other collective measures involving several other redress-seeking communities. These were rejected outright by the Chinese Canadian national groups. In the same year, after Jean Chr√©tien replaced Mulroney as prime minister, the Cabinet openly refused to provide an apology or redress. Still, the CCNC and its supporters continued to raise the issue whenever they could, including a submission to the United Nations Human Rights Commission and eventually undertaking court action against the Crown-in-Council, arguing that the federal Crown should not be profiting from racism and that it had a responsibility under both the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and international human rights law. In addition, the 1988 apology and compensation for the internment of Japanese Canadians during the Second World War was regarded as a precedent for redressing other racially motivated policies. The Ontario court declared in 2001 that the government of Canada had no obligation to redress the head tax levied on Chinese immigrants because the Charter had no retroactive application and the case of internment of Japanese Canadians was not a legal precedent. Two appeals in 2002 and 2003 were unsuccessful. =The Last Spike Campaign= In 2003, Canadian historian Pierre Berton gave a ceremonial iron railway spike to redress activists who toured the historical icon around the country as part of the \\"Last Spike Campaign\\", rebuilding support for a public demand for redress.Redress door left open When Paul Martin won the leadership of the federal Liberal Party and became prime minister in 2003, there was a sense of urgency as it became clear that there were perhaps only a few dozen surviving Chinese Head Tax payers left (they were paid $20,000) maybe a few hundred spouses or widows. Several regional and national events had been organised to revitalize the redress campaign: In 2004, Doudou Di√®ne, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, concluded that Canada should redress the head tax to Chinese Canadians in response to a submission by May Chiu, legal counsel to the Chinese Canadian Redress Alliance. In 2005, Gim Wong, an 82-year-old son of two head tax payers and a World War II veteran, conducted a cross-country Ride for Redress on his Harley Davidson motorcycle, where upon his arrival in Ottawa Prime Minister Paul Martin refused to meet him. =Bill C-333= On November 17, 2005, a group calling itself the National Congress of Chinese Canadians (NCCC) announced that an agreement had been reached between 11 Chinese-Canadian groups and the federal Cabinet, wherein the Queen-in-Council would pay $12.5 million for the creation of a new non-profit foundation to educate Canadians about anti-Chinese discrimination, with a specific pre- condition that no apology would be expected from any government figure. The NCCC was formed in the early 1990s and negotiated with the mantra \\"no apology and no individual compensation,\\" so the Liberal government selected them as the representative group to negotiate the deal. The Department of Canadian Heritage's announcement on November 24, 2005 stated that the agreed upon funding would be reduced to $2.5 million. It was later revealed that the Minister for Asia and Pacific affairs, Raymond Chan, who claimed to have negotiated the deal, had purposely misled both the ministers of the Crown and the public and some of the groups named as being party to the agreement stated publicly that their names had been used without permission; several other groups listed did not even exist. Taco Chan stated that \\"apology is not on\\" and argued \\"that to apologize would be tantamount to giving up immunity that has been granted to the government by the court.\\" Don Lee, the co-founder and national director of the NCCC has claimed that his organization had no direct ties to the Liberals; however, Toronto First Radio host Simon Li asked \\"Why, Mr. Prime Minister, on the eve of a federal election, was so much money given to a single organization that sent out squads of volunteers to campaign for Liberals in Toronto's Chinatown in the last election?\\"Head-tax debate heats up on hustings The Liberal deal with the NCCC upset the CCNC and its affiliates, as this purported deal had been reached without their input. Other community groups including the B.C. Coalition of Head Tax Payers and the Ontario Coalition of Chinese Head Tax Payers and Families criticized the agreement as well. Bill C-333, the Chinese Canadian Recognition and Redress Act, a private member's bill, was tabled in the federal parliament in order to implement the deal in November 2005. While C-333 sought to acknowledge, commemorate and educate about past government wrongdoings, it fell far short of the apology demanded by generations of Chinese Canadians. Furthermore, the clause in C-333 which stated \\"1.1 The Government of Canada shall undertake negotiations with the NCCC towards an agreement concerning measures that may be taken to recognize the imposition of exclusionary measures on immigrants of Chinese origin from 1885 to 1947\\" essentially excluded the CCNC, and its representation by proxy of more than 4,000 head tax payers, their spouses and families, from any settlement talks with the government. The Ontario Coalition of Head Tax Payers and Families lobbied the Conservative Party to stop the passage of Bill C-333. The Conservatives exercised a procedural prerogative and switched the order of Bill C-333 with Bill C-331, a bill to recognize past wrongs against Ukrainian Canadians during wartime, causing Bill C-333 to die when Prime Minister Martin's Liberals lost a motion of non-confidence and parliament was dissolved on 28 November 2005. =Political campaigning= As they had done while campaigning for the federal election in 2004, the New Democratic Party and Bloc Qu√©b√©cois stated, during the leadup to the January 2006 election, their support for an apology and redress for the head tax. Similarly, on 8 December 2005, Conservative Party leader Stephen Harper released a press statement expressing his support for an apology for the head tax. As a part of his party platform, Harper promised to work with the Chinese community on redress, should the Conservatives be called to form the next government.Conservative Party Of Canada Before his party ultimately lost the election, Martin issued a personal apology on a Chinese language radio program. However, he was quickly criticized by the Chinese Canadian community for not issuing the apology in the House of Commons and for then trying to dismiss it completely in the English-speaking media on the very same day. Several Liberal candidates with significant Chinese-Canadian populations in their ridings, including Vancouver-Kingsway MP David Emerson and the Minister of State for Multiculturalism and Richmond MP Raymond Chan, also made futile attempts to change their positions in the midst of the campaign. Others, such as Edmonton Centre MP Anne McLellan lost her riding to Conservative MP Laurie Hawn. =Apology= The 2006 federal election was won by the Conservative Party, though it was a minority government that was formed. Three days after the ballots had been counted on January 23, but before he had been appointed prime minister, Harper reiterated his position on the head tax issue in a news conference: \\"Chinese Canadians are making an extraordinary impact on the building of our country. They've also made a significant historical contribution despite many obstacles. That's why, as I said during the election campaign, the Chinese Canadian community deserves an apology for the head tax and appropriate acknowledgement and redress.\\" Formal discussions on the form of apology and redress began on 24 March 2006, with a preliminary meeting between Chinese Canadians representing various groups (including some head tax payers), heritage minister Bev Oda, and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister Paul Martin resulting in the \\"distinct possibility\\" of an apology being issued before 1 July 2006, to commemorate the anniversary of the enacting of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1923. The meeting was followed by the government's acknowledgement, in the Speech from the Throne delivered by Governor General Micha√´lle Jean on 4 April 2006, that an apology would be given along with proper redress. That year, from April 21 to April 30, the Crown-in-Council hosted public consultations across Canada, in cities most actively involved in the campaign: Halifax, Vancouver, Toronto, Edmonton, Montreal, and Winnipeg. They included the personal testimony of elders and representatives from a number of groups, among them the Halifax Redress Committee; the British Columbia Coalition of Head Tax Payers, Spouses and Descendants; ACCESS; the Ontario Coalition of Head Tax Payers and Families; the CCNC; and the Edmonton Redress Committee of the Chinese Canadian Historical Association of Alberta and Chinese Canadian Redress Alliance. Some considered that the major issues revolve around the content of any settlement, with the leading groups demanding meaningful redress, not only for the handful of surviving \\"head tax\\" payers and widows/spouses, but first-generation sons/daughters who were direct victims, as told in the documentary Lost Years: A People's Struggle for Justice. Some have proposed that the redress be based on the number of \\"Head Tax\\" Certificates (or estates) brought forward by surviving sons and daughters who are still able to register their claims, with proposals for individual redress, ranging from $10,000 to $30,000 for an estimated 4,000 registrants. On 22 June 2006, in the House of Commons for the first session of the 39th Parliament, Prime Minister Stephen Harper delivered an official apology to Chinese Canadians. During his address Harper spoke a few words in Cantonese, \\"Ga Na Daai Doe Heep\\" (, 'Canada Apologizes'), breaking the Parliamentary tradition of speaking either English and French in the House of Commons. The apology and compensation was for the head tax once paid by Chinese immigrants. Survivors or their spouses were paid approximately CAD$20,000 in compensation. There were only an estimated 20 Chinese Canadians who paid the tax still alive in 2006.Sympatico / MSN : News : CTV.ca: PM apologizes in House of Commons for head tax As no mention of redress for the children was made, the Chinese Canadian community continues to fight for a redress from the Canadian government. A national day of protest was held to coincide with Canada Day 2006 in major cities across Canada, and several hundred Chinese Canadians joined in local marches.

It is the main campus of the Faculty of Science of Sorbonne University. The Paris Diderot University (Paris VII), was also originally located on the Jussieu campus but moved to its new independent campus in the Paris Rive Gauche neighborhood in 2006-2012. Many ties continue to exist between the two universities. Because of reconstruction programs in progress (see below), various facilities have been moved out of the campus to other parts of Paris.  History  The campus was opened in 1951 and eventually it would host a great part of the old faculty of sciences of the Sorbonne. Built on the site of the old \\"Halle aux vins,\\" a wine market created by Napoleon Bonaparte, the campus remains incomplete to this day. In 1957, the first university buildings were built along the Eastern bank of the River Seine (le quai Saint-Bernard), and Rue Cuvier. In order to allow the wine?unclear to remain on the site, the architects planned to construct the buildings on stilts above the roads of the market. However, in 1964, with over 20,000 science students graduating high school (the baby boom generation), the old Sorbonne could not accommodate the influx of students. Cultural minister Andr√© Malraux entrusted the architect √âdouard Albert with the task of rapidly constructing a new science campus on the site. Albert's grand vision of modular metallic buildings, designed to facilitate interdisciplinary work and improve teaching, was never achieved, and eventually abandoned in 1972.  Facilities  Floor plan of the Jussieu Campus Most of the campus consists in a regular grid of 6-floor wings; at the points of intersection are staircases and elevators. The grid is built on a large elevated slab, and the wings do not reach to the bottom of the slab, making it possible to walk across the campus without entering the buildings. Underneath the slab are ground-level and underground facilities, including a car park. The main front of Jussieu is bounded by a 10 meter deep dry moat, and many pedestrian entrances are bridges over this moat that can be readily secured. The high security features of the campus are likely a response to the student riots that occurred in 1968 in this neighborhood. In the center of the campus is the Tour Zamansky, or Tour Jussieu, with 24 floors and a height of 90 meters, used for administrative purposes. Certain research libraries (in mathematics, for instance) are among the largest and with the widest selection of books in France. Campus restaurants are located in the northeast corner of the campus, many of which afford a pleasant view of the Seine River.  Controversies and asbestos  View of the campus in 2005 during asbestos removal. The campus was often decried as an architectural failure. The hollow space under the building wings enables wind to build up its force, and thus the environment on the slab is unfriendly. Sound-proofing is very poor, with classes regularly having to briefly stop when someone flushes the toilet next door. The regular grid plan is confusing, and only long-time residents can move through without going back to the wind-blown ground level, since many corridors do not allow through-crossing (laboratories etc. have often chosen to lock their corridor for safety reasons). The campus had increasingly deteriorated since its construction, and its older tower stairwells and exteriors were covered in perpetual graffiti. The most worrisome aspect of the Jussieu architecture was its extensive use of asbestos as a fire retardant. Asbestos fibers are carcinogenic when inhaled. As a consequence, the use of asbestos in buildings is prohibited in France, but was not at the time when the campus was built. The risks are particularly acute for workers who maintain the building (drilling walls, for example). In addition, the fire retardation is not considered sufficient, so that its metal frames would collapse in a large fire. An ambitious clean-up program was begun in 1997 after some high-profile protests. The wings are stripped of all equipment, walls, etc., down to the naked concrete frame, and are then rebuilt using more modern materials. Many advocated the destruction of Jussieu when the asbestos problem was addressed. However, the campus is protected as an architectural type, and must be restored to its original condition. In 1996 Claude All√®gre, a well known French politician and former scientist, opposed the removal of asbestos from the campus, describing it as harmless and dismissing concerns about it as a form of \\"psychosis created by leftists\\".\\"Claude All√®gre: Qui a peur du 'serial gaffeur'?\\", Marianne, May 30, 2009, p.48 The campus' asbestos is deemed to have killed 22 people and caused serious health problems in 130 others.\\"D√©j√† 22 morts et 130 malades: Les amiantes de jussieu\\", Nouvel Observateur, November 29, 2007 The 1997‚Äì2016 refurbishment completely removed the asbestos. This was also an opportunity to rebuild the campus to be more friendly to its inhabitants. The graffiti were removed; sound proofing and thermal isolation was added; many of the depressing round stairwells were replaced by straight ones; openings were made to create vistas and let in light; the prefabs were destroyed and replaced by gardens; courtyards were covered by transparent roofing; a dry garden was created around the Zamansky building; and a restaurant was opened in the South-East courtyard.  Transportation  The campus is served by the Paris M√©tro station Jussieu, as well as numerous bus lines.

The company's services also include testing, development, automation, and performance management software for programs running on mainframe computer systems. The company has its headquarters in Downtown Detroit, Michigan. In December 2014, Compuware was acquired by private equity firm Thoma Bravo and became a privately held company. In March 2020, Compuware reached deal to sell to Houston-based enterprise software company BMC Software. History =Inception and early years= In 1973, Peter Karmanos, Jr., Thomas Thewes, and Allen B. Cutting established Compuware Corporation. Their vision was to help people do things with computers by providing their clients with professional technical services, allowing them to focus on their own core businesses. In 1977, Compuware introduced Abend-AID, its first software product. Designed to detect bugs and suggest corrective action in corporate IBM mainframe systems. The release of Abend-AID established a product strategy for Compuware, alleviating the peaks and valleys of revenue that occur in the services business. By 1978, Compuware opened its first remote office to service the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore area. =1980s= Compuware launched its File-AID product line. Using a request-driven interface, File-AID products help programmers and developers quickly and easily find, create, extract, transfer, fix, convert, load, edit, age, and compare data. This allows developers to focus on developing and maintaining applications that meet business needs. Compuware also announced Playback, the company's first automated testing tool. Later, Compuware moved from its Southfield location to a new corporate headquarters in Farmington Hills, Michigan. Compuware also acquired its first European subsidiaries during the 1980s. Compuware launched Powerbase with Datazoom, a very user-friendly, non- programmable, relational database for MS-DOS through Compuware/Power-base Systems, Inc. =1990s= Throughout the 1990s, Compuware acquired several companies, building their position in the marketplace, including Centura Software, XA Systems, EcoSystems Software, Uniface development environment, Hiperstation, Coronet, Direct Technology Limited, DRD Promark, Inc, NuMega, Data Processing Resources Corporation, Programart, and the CACI Products Company. In 1992, Compuware completed its initial public offering (IPO) of stock trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol CPWR. In 1994, Compuware commenced a secondary public offering to raise cash, and named Joseph A. Nathan President and Chief Operating Officer. By April 1998, Compuware had more than $800 million in sales. At the end of 1998, Compuware surpassed the US$1 billion revenue mark. In 1999, the number of Compuware employees grew considerably, prompting the company to build a new headquarters building in Campus Martius Park in Detroit, Michigan. =2000s= Since 2000, Compuware has acquired e-business services firms BlairLake, Inc., Nomex, Inc., Covisint, LLC, Adlex, Inc., SteelTrace, Changepoint, Proxima Technology's Centauri Business Service Manager. In 2003, the company's 30th year of existence, Compuware completed construction on its new world headquarters building in downtown Detroit. On November 9, 2009 Compuware acquired Gomez, Inc. for its application performance management software. =2010s= On July 6, 2011, Compuware acquired dynaTrace software. On September 25, 2013 Compuware subsidiary Covisint announced pricing of initial public offering. On January 8, 2014 Compuware announced the planned divestiture of its Changepoint, Professional Services, and Uniface divisions to Marlin Equity Partners for $160 million. Compuware completed a spin-off of Covisint on October 31, 2014. In December 2014, Compuware was acquired by private equity firm Thoma Bravo, LLC. =Thoma Bravo Acquisition and Privatization= On September 2, 2014 Compuware and private equity firm Thoma Bravo, LLC, jointly announced that Compuware had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Thoma Bravo for approximately $2.5 billion. After finalizing the deal in December 2014, plans were announced to separate Compuware's remaining Mainframe and Application Performance Management (APM) business units into two distinct companies. The mainframe business unit retains the Compuware name and is exclusively focused on mainframe software. Christopher O'Malley is the current CEO. Compuware's former APM business operates independently under the new Dynatrace name with John Van Siclen operating as CEO. As a result of the privatization, Compuware stock is no longer listed on the NASDAQ. = Post- acquisition =  Agile DevOps Practices  Beginning in 2014, around the time of Thoma Bravo, LLC's acquisition, Compuware began shifting from a Waterfall development methodology to Agile development. With the release of Compuware Topaz‚Äîa solution that allows developers, data architects and other IT professionals to discover, visualize and work with mainframe and non- mainframe data in a common, intuitive manner‚Äîon January 5, 2015, Compuware has since released net-new mainframe software on a quarterly basis.

Although not previously a member of Salvia, the genus widely known as sage, since 2017 it has been included within them. It has an upright habit, typically reaching , with square stems and grey-green leaves that yield a distinctive odor when crushed. It is best known for its flowers. Its flowering season extends from mid-summer to late October, with blue to violet blossoms arranged into showy, branched panicles. It is native to the steppes and hills of southwestern and central Asia. Successful over a wide range of climate and soil conditions, it has since become popular and widely planted. Several cultivars have been developed, differing primarily in leaf shape and overall height; 'Blue Spire' is the most common. This variation has been widely used in gardens and landscaping. S. yangii was the Perennial Plant Association's 1995 Plant of the Year, and the 'Blue Spire' cultivar received the Award of Garden Merit from the Royal Horticultural Society. The species has a long history of use in traditional medicine in its native range, where it is employed as a treatment for a variety of ailments. This has led to the investigation of its phytochemistry. Its flowers can be eaten in salads or crushed for dyemaking, and the plant has been considered for potential use in the phytoremediation of contaminated soil. Description calyx, tube-shaped corolla, and exserted style Salvia yangii is a deciduous perennial subshrub with an erect to spreading habit. Superficially, it resembles a much larger version of lavender. Multiple branches arise from a shared rootstalk, growing to a height of , with occasional specimens reaching . The mature plant may be . The rigid stems are square in cross-section, and are covered by an indumentum formed by stellate, or star-shaped, trichomes and oil droplets. Especially during autumn, these hairs give the stems a silvery appearance. The grayish-green leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, and attached to the stems by a short petiole. They are generally and , although narrower in some populations. The overall leaf shape is oblate, a rounded shape longer than it is wide, to lanceolate, shaped like the head of a lance. They are pinnatipartite, with a deeply incised leaf margin that may be either wavy or sharp-toothed; even within a single community of S. yangii, there can be considerable variation in the details of leaf shape. Leaves near the top of branches may merge into bracts. The foliage is aromatic, especially when crushed, with a fragrance described as sage-like, a blend of sage and lavender, or like turpentine. The flowering season of S. yangii can be as long as June through October, although populations in some parts of its range, such as China, may bloom in a much more restricted period. The inflorescence is a showy panicle, , with many branches. Each of these branches is a raceme, with the individual flowers arranged in pairs called verticillasters. Each flower's calyx is purple, densely covered in white or purple hairs, and about . The corolla is tube-shaped, formed from a four-lobed upper lip and a slightly shorter lower lip; the blue or violet blue petals are about 1 cm long. The style has been reported in both an exserted‚Äîextending beyond the flower's tube‚Äîform and one contained within the flower; all known examples of S. yangii in cultivation have exserted styles. Gardening author Neil Soderstrom describes the appearance of the flowers from a distance as \\"like a fine haze or fog\\". Fruits develop about a month after flowering, and consist of dark brown oval nutlets, about . Taxonomy and phylogeny Salvia yangii was described, under the name Perovskia atriplicifolia, by George Bentham in 1848, based on a specimen collected by William Griffith in Afghanistan, now preserved at the Kew Gardens herbarium as the species's holotype. The specific epithet atriplicifolia means \\"with leaves like Atriplex\\", referring to its similarity to saltbush. While commonly known as Russian sage, S. yangii is not native to Russia. A Chinese population was described as a separate species in 1987 and given the name Perovskia pamirica, but has since been considered synonymous with S. yangii. =Phylogenetics= Within the family Lamiaceae, the large genus Salvia had long been believed monophyletic, based on the structure of its stamens. Several smaller genera, including Dorystaechas, Perovskia, and Meriandra were also included in tribe Mentheae, but were thought to be more distantly related. In 2004, a molecular phylogenetics study based on two cpDNA genes (rbcL and trnL-F) demonstrated that Salvia is not monophyletic, but comprises three identifiable clades. Clade I is more closely related to Perovskia than to other members of Salvia. S. yangii has been the subject of subsequent studies seeking to clarify the relationships within Mentheae. Further research combined palynological analysis of pollen grains with rbcL sequencing to provide additional support for the relationship between Perovskia and Salvia clade I. It also distinguished between S. yangii and S. abrotanoides, while confirming their close relationship. A subsequent multigene study (four cpDNA markers and two nrDNA markers) redrew parts of the Mentheae cladogram, making Rosmarinus a sister group to Perovskia. =Cultivars= alt=Flowers of the Blue Spire cultivar Several cultivars of S. yangii have been developed. They are primarily distinguished by the height of mature plants and the depth of the leaf-margin incisions. Many of these cultivars, especially those with deeply incised leaves, may actually be hybrids of S. yangii and S. abrotanoides. In that context, some may be referred to by the hybrid name Perovskia √óhybrida. The most common cultivar, 'Blue Spire', is among those suspected of being a hybrid. It was selected from German plantings by the British Notcutts Nurseries, and first exhibited in 1961. 'Blue Spire' grows to approximately , and has large, darker blue flowers. In 1993, it received the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. 'Filigran' reaches a height of ; this tall, sturdy cultivar's name is German for filigree, in reference to its lacy, fern-like foliage. 'Little Spire' is shorter, with a mature height of only . 'Longin' is similar in height to 'Blue Spire' but more upright. Allan Armitage established the late-flowering cultivar 'Mystery of Knightshayes' from a plant at Knightshayes Court. Other cultivars include 'Blue Haze', 'Blue Mist', 'Hybrida' (also called 'Superba'), 'Lace', 'Lisslit', 'Rocketman', and 'WALPPB'. =Similar species= Nine species are recognised within Salvia subg. Perovskia. S. abrotanoides shares much of the range of S. yangii, but is distinguished by its bipinnate leaves. Hybrids between these two species may occur naturally. Restricted to Turkestan in its native range, P. scrophularifolia is less upright; some forms have white flowers. The flowers of P. scabiosifolia are yellow. Distribution, habitat, and ecology Widely distributed across Asia in its native range, Perovskia atriplicifolia grows in western China, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, and parts of eastern Europe. It is found in steppes and on hillsides, and grows at higher elevations in mountainous regions, including the Himalayas. It has been recorded at of altitude in the Karakoram. In Pakistan's Quetta district, it is often found in association with the grass Chrysopogon aucheri, and may serve as an indicator species for soils with low calcium carbonate and chloride availability. The harsh habitats preferred by P. atriplicifolia are comparable to the sagebrush steppe of North America. In parts of its range, such as the Harboi, these steppe ecosystems are employed as rangeland for grazing animals such as sheep and goats, although this forage is generally of poor nutritional quality. P. atriplicifolia can serve as an important source of phosphorus and zinc, despite being high in poorly-digested material such as neutral detergent fiber and lignin. Cultivation Illustration from alt=Drawing of leaves and flowers Following its introduction to the United Kingdom in 1904, the Irish gardener and author William Robinson was immediately taken with the plant, which he described as being \\"worth a place in the choicest garden for its graceful habit and long season of beauty.\\" The Royal Horticultural Society records the establishment of cultivars beginning with P. 'Hybrida', selected at a Hampshire nursery in the 1930s. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, P. atriplicifolia had gained widespread popularity, and in 1995, it was selected as the Perennial Plant Association's Plant of the Year. The cultivar ‚ÄòBlue Spire ‚Äò has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. =Planting and care= Russian sage is a perennial plant suitable for a wide range of conditions, at least where its tendency to spread will not be a problem. The species prefers full sun. Specimens planted in partially shaded locations tend to spread or flop, although this behavior can be controlled somewhat by pinching young shoots or by providing a strong-standing accompaniment that the plant can drape itself around for support. Flowers bloom only on new growth. Plants trimmed to in early spring provide the best subsequent growth and flowering. Tolerant of both heat and cold, it is grown in North America in United States Department of Agriculture hardiness zones three through nine, although some cultivars may be better suited than others to extremes of temperature. It is successfully grown from the southwestern United States, north and east across much of the country, and across the Canada‚ÄìUS border into Ontario and Quebec. In the coldest of these areas, it may require considerable protection to survive the winter. In the United Kingdom, the Royal Horticultural Society has assigned it hardiness rating H4, indicating that it tolerates temperatures as low as , hardy in most of the country through typical winters. It also tolerates a variety of soil conditions. Although young specimens perform best when planted in a mixture of peat and either sand or perlite, P. atriplicifolia can thrive in sandy, chalky, or loamy soil, or heavy clay soil with sufficient drainage. It can endure a wide range of soil pH, as well as exposure to salty conditions near oceans. Its deep-feeding taproot makes it especially drought tolerant; for this reason it has seen wide use for xeriscaping in the Intermountain West. Overwatering and over-fertilization can damage its roots and lead to a rapid decline in health. P. atriplicifolia is otherwise generally free from plant pathogens. In cultivation, it is also rarely selected as forage by grazing animals, and so is considered both a deer-resistant and rabbit-resistant plant. =Landscaping= In alt=Purple flowering subshrub planted along road Russian sage has been praised for its usefulness in gardens and landscaping features. It is most commonly planted as an accent feature, such as an \\"island\\" in an expanse of lawn, but it can also be used as filler within a larger landscaping feature, or to enhance areas where the existing natural appearance is retained. Gardening author Troy Marden describes P. atriplicifolia as having a \\"see-through\\" quality that is ideal for borders. Some experts suggest groups of three plants provide the best landscape appearance. It is also suitable for container gardening. It does have an undesirable tendency to spread via rhizomes beyond it original planting. It attracts bees, hummingbirds, and butterflies, and contributes color to gardens‚Äîboth the blue of its late-season flowers, and the silvery colors of its winter stalks. =Propagation= Russian sage is frequently propagated by cuttings. Because its woody crown is resistant to division, softwood cuttings are taken from shoots near the base, generally in late spring. Hardwood cuttings selected in mid-to-late summer also provide a viable propagation technique. The plant is also grown from seed in cultivation. Such seeds require exposure to cold for 30‚Äì160 days to germinate, and seed-raised specimens may not preserve the characteristics of named cultivars. In the commercial greenhouse or nursery setting, its relatively large size and rapid growth can adversely affect quality or make plants more difficult and expensive to transport; the use of plant growth regulators such as chlormequat chloride and daminozide may be more cost-effective than large-scale pruning. Some members of the Lamiaceae can spread unchecked and become invasive plants. Planting of Russian sage near wild lands has been discouraged by some gardening guides out of concern for its potential to spread, but it is not yet considered invasive, and has been suggested as a substitute for purple loosestrife for this reason. Uses Used as a border in the alt=Purple flowers border a walking path Russian sage has a long history of use in traditional medicine, and is smoked as a euphoriant. In addition to its use in folk medicine, it is sometimes used in Russia to flavor a vodka-based cocktail. Its flowers are eaten in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan, including Kashmir, adding a sweet flavor to salads; they can also be crushed to yield a blue colorant for cosmetics or as a textile dye. This species is considered a candidate for use in phytoremediation because of its rapid growth, tolerance for harsh conditions, and ability to accumulate toxic heavy metals from polluted soil. =Phytochemistry= The phytochemistry of Russian sage is under basic research. Analysis of its essential oil has identified over two dozen compounds, although the compounds detected and their relative prevalence have not been consistent. Most analyses have identified various monoterpenes and monoterpenoids as the dominant components, such as carene, eucalyptol, limonene, Œ≥-terpinene, and (+)-Œ≤-thujone, although the essential oil of a sample from the Orto Botanico dell'Universit√† di Torino had camphor as its most prevalent component. Other monoterpenes, camphene, Œ±-pinene, and Œ≤-pinene are also present, as are sesquiterpenes such as Œ≥-cadinene, Œ¥-cadinene, trans-caryophyllene, and Œ±-humulene. Several terpenoid alcohols ‚Äî borneol, cedrol, and menthol ‚Äî have been extracted, as have caffeic acid and ferulic acid. More complex compounds have been isolated, some of which were first identified in this manner, including perovskatone; the glycosides atriplisides A and B; and atricins A and B, a pair of triterpenes that are similar to oleanane. Four diterpene glucosides have been isolated by extraction. The essential oil can function as a biopesticide, especially regarding Tropidion castaneum beetles and Camponotus maculatus carpenter ants.

Kippers might also be fighters of non-knightly status, who therefore did not fight on horseback.Francis G. Gentry (1995). German Epic Poetry. Page 329 The function of the kipper was to follow his knight in combat and retrieve armour or arms from fallen adversaries. If the adversary was not completely subdued and ready to surrender these, the kipper would bang on the armour-clad opponent with various blunt non-lethal instruments, like heavy sticks or clubs, to knock him unconscious for the purpose of gathering the spoils without further protest. It was the right of a knight to seize the armour and weapons of a fallen adversary during a tournament. In the early days, tournament fighting was not much different from open warfare, with few rules and none of the pomp and ceremony of the later tournaments. In this chaotic m√™l√©e, kippers were therefore mere foot soldiers of the tournament, and it was not their function or intention to participate in the fighting. In the later Middle Ages, when tournaments no longer resembled actual warfare and the chivalric code became more popular, kippers were frowned upon. Less warlike and more honorable tournament conduct was encouraged. The word kipper is cognate with Icelandic kippa (\\"to pull, snatch\\"), Danish kippen (\\"to seize\\"), and a Middle High German word that means \\"to beat or kick\\".

Background The poem was published by Leigh Hunt in the December 22, 1819 issue of The Indicator and reprinted in Posthumous Poems in 1824 edited by Mary Shelley.Hutchinson, Thomas, ed. The Complete Poetical Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley. London: Oxford University Press, 1909, page 578. It was included in the Harvard manuscript book where it is headed \\"An Anacreontic\\", dated \\"January, 1820\\". Anacreontics are poems written in the style of the ancient Greek poet Anacreon, known for his celebrations of love. Shelley wrote it in a copy of Leigh Hunt's Literary Pocket-Book, 1819, which was presented to Sophia Stacey, December 29, 1820. The poem is divided in two 8-line stanzas with an ABABCDCD rhyme scheme.Shelley, Percy Bysshe. The Selected Poetry and Prose of Shelley. Ware, Hertfordshire, UK: The Wordsworth Poetry Library, 2002. The main theme is the relationship between the \\"connection\\" that exists for things in the natural world and the poet's desire to be connected to his object of affection. Shelley asks how there can be unity in nature but a lack of union in human relationships. The poetic devices Shelley uses in the poem include Personification (Fountains mingle with the river; Winds of heaven mix forever with a sweet emotion; The mountains kiss high heaven; The waves clasp one another; Moonbeams kiss the sea), Metaphor (No sister flower could be forgiven if it disdained its brother), and the Rhetorical question (If thou kiss not me?). In popular culture British composer Roger Quilter set the poem to music in 1905 in the composition Love's Philosophy, Op. 3, No 1. In 2003, David Gompper set the poem to music in a score for baritone and piano.Composer David Gompper. Choral composer David N. Childs set the poem to music scored for a four-part women's choir and piano. The second stanza of the poem appears in the second season of Twin Peaks. References Sources *Bonca, Teddi Chichester.

Beringois of the Ms. G.B.f.18.a (2013) By the late 15th century, the manuscript was owned by Nicolaus Pol, who left the inscription Nicolaus Pol doctor 1494. Pol is known as the personal surgeon to the emperors at Innsbruck from 1495. After Pol's death in 1532, his library, presumably including this manuscript, passed to Innichen Abbey in South Tyrol. The fate of the manuscript during the 17th and 18th centuries is unknown, but it was part of the library of Hans Freiherr von und zu Aufsess, from which it passed to the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in 1852. The manuscript is a pragmatic commonplace book apparently compiled for the scribe's personal use. It is an early example of such a compilation (if indeed it dates to before 1400), and is as such notable as a document of the transition from oral to written tradition during the late medieval period. The compilation contains notes on an eclectic variety of topics, including alchemy, magical formulas, conjuring tricks, chemical recipes for fireworks, paints, medicine, ironworking, etc. A substantial portion of the manuscript is a combat manual, making it of particular notability for the study of Historical European Martial Arts. It is the earliest record of the German school of fencing in the tradition of Johannes Liechtenauer. Liechtenauer is here for the first time mentioned by name, and his teachings quoted. His tradition of martial arts, especially the fencing with the longsword would remain influential in Germany throughout the 15th and for much of the 16th century. The manuscript text had never been edited in print prior to its notability to the Historical European Martial Arts revival.

Hils (1985, p. 106) identified Hanko D√∂bringer as the author of the manuscript, a mistake inherited from the earlier survey by Wierschin (1965). It was inspired by the fact that the name is written on the page margin on fol. 43r. When the manuscript text was edited, it became clear that D√∂bringer's name was added in the margin because it had been omitted by accident from a list of four \\"other masters\\" discussed on that page.

While there is limited surviving documentation of the martial arts of classical antiquity (such as Greek wrestling or gladiatorial combat), surviving dedicated technical treatises or martial arts manuals date to the Late Middle Ages and the early modern period. For this reason, the focus of HEMA is de facto on the period of the half-millennium of ca. 1300 to 1800, with a German and an Italian school flowering in the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance (14th to 16th centuries), followed by Spanish, French, English and Scottish schools of fencing in the modern period (17th and 18th centuries). Arts of the 19th century such as classical fencing, and even early hybrid styles such as Bartitsu may also be included in the term HEMA in a wider sense, as may traditional or folkloristic styles attested in the 19th and early 20th centuries, including forms of folk wrestling and traditional stick-fighting methods. The term Western martial arts (WMA) is sometimes used in the United States and in a wider sense including modern and traditional disciplines. During the Late Middle Ages, the longsword had a position of honour among these disciplines, and sometimes historical European swordsmanship (HES) is used to refer to swordsmanship techniques specifically. Modern reconstructions of some of these arts arose from the 1890s and have been practiced systematically since the 1990s. History of European Martial Arts =Ancient history= Fol. 4v of the I.33 The first book about the fighting arts, Epitoma rei militaris was written into Latin by a Roman writer, Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus, who lived in Rome between the fourth and fifth centuries. There are no other known martial arts manuals predating the Late Middle Ages (except for fragmentary instructions on Greek wrestling, see Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 466), although medieval literature (e.g., sagas of Icelanders, Eastern Roman Acritic songs, the Digenes Akritas and Middle High German epics) record specific martial deeds and military knowledge; in addition, historical artwork depicts combat and weaponry (e.g., the Bayeux Tapestry, the Synopsis of Histories by John Skylitzes, the Morgan Bible). Some researchers have attempted to reconstruct older fighting methods such as Pankration, Eastern Roman hoplomachia, Viking swordsmanship and gladiatorial combat by reference to these sources and practical experimentation. The Royal Armouries Ms. I.33 (also known as the \\"Walpurgis\\" or \\"Tower Fechtbuch\\"), dated to ca. 1300,between ca. 1290 (by Alphonse Lhotsky) and the early-to-mid-14th century (by R. Leng, of the University of W√ºrzburg) is the oldest surviving Fechtbuch, teaching sword and buckler combat. =Post-classical history= The central figure of late medieval martial arts, at least in Germany, is Johannes Liechtenauer. Though no manuscript written by him is known to have survived, his teachings were first recorded in the late fourteenth-century N√ºrnberger Handschrift GNM 3227a. From the 15th century into the 17th, numerous Fechtb√ºcher (German \\"fencing-books\\") were produced, of which some several hundred are extant; a great many of these describe methods descended from Liechtenauer's. Longsword guards (1452 manuscript) Normally, several modes of combat were taught alongside one another, typically unarmed grappling (Kampfringen or abrazare), dagger (Degen or daga, often of the rondel dagger), long knife (Messer) or Dusack, half- or quarterstaff, pole weapons, longsword (langes Schwert, spada longa, spadone), and combat in plate armour (Harnischfechten or armazare), both on foot and on horseback. Some Fechtb√ºcher have sections on dueling shields (Stechschild), special weapons used only in trial by combat. Important 15th-century German fencing masters include Sigmund Ringeck, Peter von Danzig (see Cod. 44 A 8), Hans Talhoffer and Paulus Kal, all of whom taught the teachings of Liechtenhauer. From the late 15th century, there were \\"brotherhoods\\" of fencers (Fechtbruderschaften), most notably the Brotherhood of St. Mark (attested 1474) and the Federfechter. An early Burgundian French treatise is Le jeu de la hache (\\"The Play of the Axe\\") of ca. 1400. The earliest master to write in the Italian language was Fiore dei Liberi, commissioned by the Marquis di Ferrara. Between 1407 and 1410, he documented comprehensive fighting techniques in a treatise entitled Flos Duellatorum covering grappling, dagger, arming sword, longsword, pole-weapons, armoured combat and mounted combat. The Italian school is continued by Filippo Vadi (1482‚Äì1487) and Pietro Monte (1492, Latin with Italian and Spanish terms). Three early (before George Silver) natively English swordplay texts exist, all very obscure and of uncertain date; they are generally thought to belong to the latter half of the 15th century. =Early modern period= Renaissance In the 16th century, compendia of older Fechtb√ºcher techniques were produced, some of them printed, notably by Paulus Hector Mair (in the 1540s) and by Joachim Meyer (in the 1570s). In the 16th century, German fencing had developed sportive tendencies. The treatises of Paulus Hector Mair and Joachim Meyer derived from the teachings of the earlier centuries within the Liechtenauer tradition, but with new and distinctive characteristics. The printed fechtbuch of Jacob Sutor (1612) is one of the last in the German tradition. In Italy, the 16th century is a period of big change. It opens with the two treatises of Bolognese masters Antonio Manciolino and Achille Marozzo, who describe a variation of the eclectic knightly arts of the previous century. From sword and buckler to sword and dagger, sword alone to two-handed sword, from polearms to wrestling (though absent in Manciolino), early 16th-century Italian fencing reflects the versatility that a martial artist of the time was supposed to achieve.Tom Leoni, The Complete Renaissance Swordsman, Freelance Academy Press, 2010 Towards the mid-century, however, polearms and companion weapons beside the dagger and the cape gradually begin to fade out of treatises. In 1553, Camillo Agrippa is the first to define the prima, seconda, terza and quarta guards (or hand-positions), which would remain the mainstay of Italian fencing into the next century and beyond.Tom Leoni, Venetian Rapier, Freelance Academy Press, 2010 From the late 16th century, Italian rapier fencing attained considerable popularity all over Europe, notably with the treatise by Salvator Fabris (1606). * Antonio Manciolino (1531, Italian) * Achille Marozzo (1536, Italian) * Angelo Viggiani (1551, Italian) * Camillo Agrippa (1553, Italian) * Jer√≥nimo S√°nchez de Carranza (1569, Spanish) * Giacomo di Grassi (1570, Italian) * Giovanni Dall'Agocchie (1572, Italian) * Henry de Sainct-Didier (1573, French) * Angelo Viggiani (1575, Italian) * Frederico Ghisliero (1587, Italian) * Vincentio Saviolo (1595, Italian) * Girolamo Cavalcabo (1597, Italian) * George Silver (1599 (English) Baroque style Students fencing with rapier and dagger, ca. 1590 During the Baroque period, wrestling fell from favour among the upper classes, being now seen as unrefined and rustic. The fencing styles practice also needed to conform with the new ideals of elegance and harmony. This ideology was taken to great lengths in Spain in particular, where La Verdadera Destreza \\"the true art (of swordsmanship)\\" was now based on Renaissance humanism and scientific principles, contrasting with the traditional \\"vulgar\\" approach to fencing inherited from the medieval period. Significant masters of Destreza included Jer√≥nimo S√°nchez de Carranza (\\"the father of Destreza\\", d. 1600) and Luis Pacheco de Narv√°ez (1600, 1632). Girard Thibault (1630) was a Dutch master influenced by these ideals. The French school of fencing also moves away from its Italian roots, developing its own terminology, rules and systems of teaching. French masters of the Baroque period include Le Perche du Coudray (1635, 1676, teacher of Cyrano de Bergerac), Besnard (1653, teacher of Descartes), Fran√ßois Dancie (1623) and Philibert de la Touche (1670). Academie de l-Espee (Girard Thibault, 1628) In Italy, 17th century swordsmanship is dominated by Salvator Fabris, whose De lo schermo overo scienza d‚Äôarme of 1606 exerted great influence not only in Italy but also in Germany, where it all but extinguished the native German traditions of fencing. Fabris was followed by Italian masters such as Nicoletto Giganti (1606), Ridolfo Capo Ferro (1610), Francesco Alfieri (1640), Francesco Antonio Marcelli (1686) and Bondi' di Mazo (1696). The Elizabethan and Jacobean eras produce English fencing writers, such as the Gentleman George Silver (1599) and the professional fencing master Joseph Swetnam (1617). The English verb to fence is first attested in Shakespeare's Merry Wives of Windsor (1597). The French school of fencing originates in the 16th century, based on the Italian school, and develops into its classic form in the Baroque period. Rococo style Academic fencing (1725 etching) In the 18th century Late Baroque / Rococo period, the French style of fencing with the small sword and later with the foil (fleuret), in origin a training weapon for small sword fencing. By the year 1715, the rapier had been largely replaced by the lighter small sword throughout most of Europe, although treatments of the former continued to be included by authors such as Donald McBane (1728), P. J. F. Girard (1736) and Domenico Angelo (1763). In this time, bare-knuckle boxing emerged as a popular sport in England and Ireland. The foremost pioneers of the sport of boxing were Englishmen James Figg and Jack Broughton.Figg on the Pugilism.org website In the course of the 18th century, the French school became the western European standard to the extent that Angelo, an Italian-born master teaching in England, published his L'Ecole des Armes in French in 1763. It was extremely successful and became a standard fencing manual over the following 50 years, throughout the Napoleonic period. Angelo's text was so influential that it was chosen to be included under the heading of \\"√âscrime\\" in the Encyclop√©die of Diderot. =Late modern period= Development into modern sports Academic fencing (1831 painting) Transition to modern sports fencing: sabre fencing around 1900. In the course of the 19th century, Western martial arts became divided into modern sports on one hand and applications that retain military significance on the other. In the latter category are the methods of close-quarter combat with the bayonet besides use of the sabre and the lance by cavalrists and of the cutlass by naval forces. Apart from fencing with bladed weapons, European combat sports of the 19th century include boxing, savate in France, numerous regional forms of folk wrestling, and numerous styles of stick fighting. Wrestling, javelin, fencing, archery, and boxing continue some of the martial arts of Europe in modified sport form. Fencing in the 19th century transformed into a pure sport. While duels remained common among members of the aristocratic and officer classes, they became increasingly frowned upon in society during the course of the century, and such duels as were fought to the death were increasingly fought with pistols, not bladed weapons. Stick fighting Styles of stick fighting include walking-stick fighting (including Irish bata or shillelagh, French la canne and English singlestick or cane) and Bartitsu (an early hybrid of Eastern and Western schools popularized at the turn of the 20th century). Some existing forms of European stick fighting can be traced to direct teacher-student lineages from the 19th century. Notable examples include the methods of Scottish and British Armed Services singlestick, la canne and B√¢ton fran√ßais, Portuguese Jogo do Pau, Italian Paranza or Bastone Siciliano and some styles of Canarian Juego del Palo. In the 19th century and early 20th century, the greatstick (pau/b√¢ton/bastone) was employed by some Portuguese, French and Italian military academies as a method of exercise, recreation and as preparation for bayonet training. A third category might be traditional \\"folk styles\\", mostly folk wrestling. Greco-Roman wrestling was a discipline at the first modern Olympic Games in 1896. Inclusion of Freestyle wrestling followed in 1904. Revival Egerton Castle, Alfred Hutton and Mouatt Biggs giving a demonstration of \\"Old English sword-and-buckler play\\" before the Prince of Wales at the Lyceum Theatre in 1891 (The Graphic) Attempts at reconstructing the discontinued traditions of European systems of combat began in the late 19th century, with a revival of interest in the Middle Ages. The movement was led in England by the soldier, writer, antiquarian and swordsman, Alfred Hutton. Hutton learned fencing at the school founded by Domenico Angelo. In 1862, he organized in his regiment stationed in India the Cameron Fencing Club, for which he prepared his first work, a 12-page booklet entitled Swordsmanship. After returning from India in 1865, Hutton focused on the study and revival of older fencing systems and schools. He began tutoring groups of students in the art of 'ancient swordplay' at a club attached to the London Rifle Brigade School of Arms in the 1880s. In 1889, Hutton published his most influential work Cold Steel: A Practical Treatise on the Sabre, which presented the historical method of military sabre use on foot, combining the 18th century English backsword with modern Italian duelling sabre. Hutton's pioneering advocacy and practice of historical fencing included reconstructions of the fencing systems of several historical masters including George Silver and Achille Marozzo. He delivered numerous practical demonstrations with his colleague Egerton Castle of these systems during the 1890s, both in order to benefit various military charities and to encourage patronage of the contemporary methods of competitive fencing. Exhibitions were held at the Bath Club and a fund-raising event was arranged at Guy‚Äôs Hospital. Newspaper report on a \\"Ladies' night at the Bath Club\\" which included demonstrations in \\"swordsmanship, swimming and bartitsu\\" (London Daily Mail, 13 June 1899). Among his many acolytes were Egerton Castle, Captain Carl Thimm, Colonel Cyril Matthey, Captain Percy Rolt, Captain Ernest George Stenson Cooke, Captain Frank Herbert Whittow, Esme Beringer, Sir Frederick and Walter Herries Pollock. Despite this revival and the interest that it received in late Victorian England, the practice died out soon after the death of Hutton in 1910. Interest in the physical application of historical fencing techniques remained largely dormant during the first half of the 20th century due to a number of factors. Similar work, although more academic than practical in nature, occurred in other European countries. In Germany, Karl Wassmannsdorf conducted research on the German school and Gustav Hergsell reprinted three of Hans Talhoffer's manuals. In France there was the work of the Academie D'Armes circa 1880-1914. Italy's Jacopo Gelli and Francesco Novati published a facsimile of the \\"Flos Duellatorum\\" of Fiore dei Liberi, and Giuseppe Cerri's book on the Bastone drew inspiration from the two-handed sword of Achille Marozzo. Baron Leguina's bibliography of Spanish swordsmanship is still a standard reference today. Throughout the 20th century a small number of researchers, principally academics with access to some of the sources, continued exploring the field of historical European martial arts from a largely academic perspective. In 1972, James Jackson published a book called Three Elizabethan Manuals of Fence. This work reprinted the works of George Silver, Giacomo di Grassi, and Vincentio Saviolo. In 1965, Martin Wierschin published a bibliography of German fencing manuals, along with a transcription of Codex Ringeck and a glossary of terms. In turn, this led to the publication of Hans-Peter Hils' seminal work on Johannes Liechtenauer in 1985. During the mid-20th century, a small number of professional fight directors for theatre, film and television - notably including Arthur Wise. William Hobbs and John Waller, all of them British - studied historical combat treatises as inspiration for their fight choreography. In the 1980s and 1990s, Patri J. Pugliese began making photocopies of historical treatises available to interested parties, greatly spurring on research. 1994 saw the rise of the Hammerterz Forum, a publication devoted entirely to the history of swordsmanship. During the late 1990s, translations and interpretations of historical sources began appearing in print as well as online. The modern HEMA community Since the 1990s, there have emerged flourishing Historical European Martial Arts communities in Europe, North America, Australia and the wider English-speaking world. These groups are engaged in attempting to reconstruct Historical European Martial Arts using various training methods. Although the focus generally is on the martial arts of Medieval and Renaissance masters, nineteenth and early twentieth century martial arts teachers are also studied and their systems are reconstructed, including Edward William Barton-Wright, the founder of Bartitsu; combat savate and stick fighting master Pierre Vigny; London-based boxer and fencer Rowland George Allanson-Winn; French journalist and self-defence enthusiast Jean Joseph- Renaud; and British quarterstaff expert Thomas McCarthy. =Research and Publications= Research into the rapier style of the innovative Roman, Neapolitan and Sicilian School of Fencing in Italy‚Äôs 16th and 17th century was pioneered by M¬∞ Francesco Lod√†, PhD, founder of Accademia Romana d‚ÄôArmi in Rome, Italy. While research focused on the Marcelli family of fencing masters and their pupils in Rome and abroad (e.g. Mattei, Villardita, Marescalchi, De Greszy, Terracusa), through publication of papers and books on rapier fencing, attention was also paid to the influences of 16th century‚Äôs masters active in Rome, such as Agrippa, Cavalcab√≤, Paternoster, or of the early 17th like D‚ÄôAlessandri. Within Accademia Romana d‚ÄôArmi historical research has continuously been carried out also on Fiore de‚Äô Liberi‚Äôs longsword system, publishing the first italian analysis and transcription of MS. Par. Lat. 11269, Radaelli‚Äôs military saber and MS. I.33 sword and buckler, and more recently on Liechtenauer‚Äôs tradition of fencing. Research into Italian sword forms and their influence on the French styles of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries has been undertaken by Rob Runacres of England's Renaissance Sword Club. Italian traditions are mainly investigated in Italy by Sala d'Arme Achille Marozzo, where you can find studies dedicated to the Bolognese tradition, to the Italian medieval tradition by Luca Cesari and Marco Rubboli, and to the Florentine tradition by Alessandro Battistini. Central and Southern italian traditions are also investigated by Accademia Romana d‚ÄôArmi, through the studies of Francesco Lod√† on Spetioli (Marche) and Pagano (Neaples). Italian rapier instructors Tom Leoni (US) and Piermarco Terminiello (UK) have published annotated English translations of some of the most important rapier treatises of the 17th century, making this fencing style available to a worldwide audience. Leoni has also authored English translations of all of Fiore de' Liberi's Italian-language manuscripts, as well as Manciolino's Opera Nova and the third book of Viggiani's Lo Schermo. Ken Mondschein, one of the few professional academics working in this field, translated Camillo Agrippa's treatise of 1553 as well as the Paris manuscript of Fiore dei Liberi and written several academic articles. The martial traditions of the Netherlands are researched by Reinier van Noort, who additionally focuses on German and French martial sources of the 17th century. The ongoing study of the Germanic Langes Messer is most notably represented by the work of Jens Peter Kleinau Martin Enzi. Dierk Hagedorn has also published significant translations. Leading researchers on Manuscript I.33's style of fence include Roland Warzecha, at the head of the Dimicator fencing school in Germany as well as Herbert Schmidt of Ars Gladii. Other fencing traditions are represented in the scholarship of Stephen Hand and Paul Wagner of Australia's Stoccata School of Defence, focusing on a range of systems, ranging from the works of George Silver and the techniques depicted in the Royal Armouries‚Äô Manuscript I.33 to the surviving evidence for how large shields were used, rapier according to Saviolo and Swetnam and Scottish Highland broadsword. Christian Henry Tobler is one of the earliest researchers on the German school of swordsmanship. Early publications also included books by Terry Brown, John Clements, David M. Cvet (self-published in 2001). In 2003 Stephen Hand edited a collection of scholarly papers titled SPADA, followed by a second volume in 2005. Since the mid 2000s the rate of publication of HEMA related texts has greatly increased. A list of current publications is included below. = Events = Since 1998, Sala d'Arme Achille Marozzo has organized an annual championship in Italy. Due to the excessive number of participants, in 2011 this competitive event was split in two separate events: military weapons (in autumn) and civil weapons (in spring), extending the organization in a larger coalition of Italian HEMA clubs. Civilian weapons include single sword, sword and cape, sword and dagger, and sword and Brocchiero (Buckler). The military weapons are the two-handed sword, spear, shield and spear, sword and targe, and sword and rotella. The civil weapons championship is one of the largest HEMA tournaments in the world. Since 1999 a number of HEMA groups have held the Western Martial arts Workshop (WMAW) in the United States.Gregory Mele, ed., In the Service of Mars: Proceedings from the Western Martial Arts Workshop 1999‚Äì2009, Volume I, Freelance Academy Press, 2010 In 2000, The Association for Renaissance Martial Arts (ARMA), then known as the \\"Historical Armed Combat Association\\" (HACA), hosted the Inaugural Swordplay Symposium International conference bringing together many of the then leading researchers from the US, Europe and Australia. Since 2003 ARMA has held the ARMA International Gathering every two to three years. The Fiore-oriented Schola Saint George has hosted a Medieval Swordsmanship Symposium annually in the United States since 2001. The annual Australian Historical Swordplay Convention, primarily a teaching event was hosted and attended by diverse Australian groups from 1999 to 2006. It was held in Brisbane in 1999 and 2006, Sydney in 2000 and 2004, Canberra in 2001 and 2005, the Gold Coast in 2003 and Melbourne in 2004. Since 2009, Swordplay, a tournament event has been run each year in Brisbane. FightCamp has been running since 2004 and it is organized by London-based Schola Gladiatoria. Since 2006 a Swedish annual event called Swordfish has been taking place every year in Gothenburg, hosted by the Gothenburg Historical Fencing School (GHFS). It is currently one of the biggest HEMA tournaments in the world and is generally considered to be the \\"world cup of HEMA\\". Since 2006 a Canadian event called Nordschlag has been taking place annually in Edmonton, Alberta, hosted by The Academy of European Swordsmanship (The AES). It is Canada's first interprovincial tournament, and currently largest Canadian tournament, and has participants from all over Western Canada. The event also includes a full day workshop that features international and local instructors. Since 2010, The annual Pacific Northwest HEMA Gathering has been hosted by multiple schools and clubs in the Pacific Northwest. The tournament includes longsword, singlestick, glima, and one rotating weapon which is changed every year. The location of the event changes every year, and has been located at Fort Casey and Pacific Lutheran University. Since 2011, a biannual event called the Vancouver International Swordplay Symposium, has been held in Vancouver, Canada. Hosted by Academie Duello, this event has brought instructors, authors and researchers from around the world for workshops, lectures and seminars. Since 2013 an annual event, Fechtschule Edinburgh, an event focusing on 16th century Fencing has been hosted in Edinburgh, UK, by the Stork's Beak: School of Historical Swordplay. This Event has attracted many practitioners from around the world. Since 2014, the Purpleheart Armoury Open has been held in Houston, TX. Formerly Fechtshule America, the Purpleheart Armoury Open is one of the largest and fastest growing HEMA competitions in North America. In 2015 Australia's Stoccata School of Defence hosted a revival of the World Broadsword Championship in Sydney, Australia. This event, held throughout the late 19th century in England, the United States and Australia was last won by Parker in Sydney in 1891. Parker was never challenged. The 2015 event was won by Paul Wagner of Sydney, also the current holder of the Glorianna Cup, the broadsword championship of Britain. Lewis Hand of Hobart, Australia won the junior title. In the tradition of the 19th century title, the championship is held in the home town of the current Champion. As such the next championship will be held in Sydney in early 2017. Jousting tournaments have become more common, with Jousters travelling Internationally to compete. These include a number organised by an expert in the Joust, Arne Koets, including The Grand Tournament of Sankt Wendel and The Grand Tournament at Schaffhausen \\"An Interview with Arne Koets, jouster\\" The Jousting Life, December 2014 = Umbrella groups = In 2001, the Historical European Martial Arts Coalition (HEMAC) was created to act as an umbrella organization for groups in Europe, with 4 sets of goals: * Martial: reconstruct historical martial arts from primary sources; refine interpretations into viable, effective martial arts; test martial skills in a variety of competitive environments. *Research: locate, transcribe, translate primary sources; have a better understanding of the socio-historical context of the arts *Outreach: promote and publicise HEMA; dispel misconceptions & stereotypes; educate the general public *Community: establish a network of individuals and groups devoted to HEMA; foster close friendships and a sense of community among members; organise at least one annual HEMAC event. Since 2002, HEMAC has organized the annual International Historical European Martial arts Gathering in Dijon, France. In 2003, the Australian Historical Swordplay Federation became the umbrella organization for groups in Australia. In 2010, several dozen HEMA schools and clubs from around the world united under the umbrella of the HEMA Alliance, a US-based martial arts federation dedicated to developing and sharing the Historical European Martial Arts and assisting HEMA schools and instructors with such things as instructor certification, insurance, and equipment development.

Elizabeth Whelan and Frederick J. Stare have noted that: > Kushi's claim that cancer is largely due to his own versions of improper > diet, thinking, and lifestyle is entirely without foundation.

Located east of Aix-en-Provence, the town lies at the foot of the Sainte-Baume mountains. Baume or bama is the Proven√ßal equivalent of cave. The town's basilica is dedicated to Mary Magdalene. History The Roman Villa Lata, remains of which have been identified beneath Place Malherbe in the center of the town, was one among numerous agricultural working Roman villas in the plain that was traversed by the via Aurelia. The Abbey of Saint Victor at Marseille had dependencies in the neighborhood: Saint-Maximin, Saint-Jean, Saint-Mitre, Sainte-Marie. The Romanesque parish church dedicated to Saint Maximin of Trier was demolished in the final stages of constructing the basilica. In the 12th century, Berenguer Ramon I, Count of Provence, established Saint-Maximin as a town uniquely under his care. In 1246, following the death of Raymond IV Berenger, Provence passed through his younger daughter to Charles d'Anjou, brother of Louis IX of France and sometime king of Sicily. The tenuous Anjou presence at Saint-Maximin was fiercely contested by the seigneurs of Baux among other local leaders. The French baritone Louis Gassier (1820‚Äì1871) was born in Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume. The cultus of Mary Magdalene The little town was transformed by the well-published discovery on 12 December 1279, in the crypt of Saint-Maximin, of a sarcophagus that was proclaimed to be the tomb of Mary Magdalene, signalled by miraclesThe Dominican Bernard Gui, claimed in his chronicle, written early in the following century, that a sweet spicy fragrance emanated from the sarcophagus' contents, and that a green shoot was found to be growing from the Magdalen's tongue. (Jansen 2000) and by the ensuing pilgrim-drawing cult of Mary Magdalene and Saint Maximin, that was assiduously cultivated by Charles II of Anjou, King of Naples. He founded the massive Gothic Basilique Ste. Marie-Madeleine in 1295; the basilica had the blessing of Boniface VIII, who placed it under the new teaching order of Dominicans. The founding tradition held that relics of Mary Magdalene were preserved here, and not at V√©zelay,Other alleged burial places are at Ephesus (now in Turkey) and the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, whence, it is said, her remains were later removed to Europe. and that she, her brother Lazarus, and a certain Maximinus fled the Holy Land by a miraculous boat with neither rudder nor sailFor the literary topos in hagiography of the miraculous boat, compare the legends of Mac Cuill and the voyages of Hui-Corra and of Mael Duin, and in religious legend Brendan of Clonfert, Saint Tathan who was carried to Britain in a rudderless boat, the three Irishmen carried to King Alfred in an oarless boat (Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, year 891), the birth of Saint Kentigern, all instanced by Hares-Stryker, 1993. Celidoine is set adrift in a rudderless boat in the Estoire de Saint Graal. The translation of Saint James the Great in a rudderless boat to Hispania might be added.

Maximinus is venerated as St Maximin, a name shared by the 3rd-century Maximin of Trier and the 1st-century martyr, Maximinus of Aix, whom medieval legend conflated with the later Maximin; the conflated Maximin was added in the discussed medieval period to earlier lists of the Seventy Disciples. After landing in the Camargue, Mary Magdalene came to Marseille and converted the local people. Later in life, according to the founding legend, she retired to a cave in the Sainte-Baume mountains. She was buried in Saint-Maximin, which was not a place of pilgrimage in early times, though there is a Gallo-Roman crypt under the basilica. Sarcophagi are shown, of St Maximin, Ste. Marcelle, Ste. Suzanne and St. Sidoine (Sidonius) as well as the reliquary, which is said to hold the remains of Mary Magdalene. Genetic testing of some of the hairs in the reliquary confirmed that it was the hair of a woman of possible Jewish ancestry, but do not confirm the identity of the source of the hair http://www.ijsciences.com/pub/pdf/V52016121167.pdf. Construction of the basilica, begun in 1295, was complete as to the crypt when it was consecrated in 1316. In it were installed a Gallo-Roman funerary monument--of the 4th century in fact--and four marble sarcophagi, whose bas-reliefs permit a Christian identification. The Black Death in 1348, which carried away half the local population, interrupted the building campaign, which was not taken up again until 1404, but found the sixth bay of the nave complete by 1412. Work continued until 1532, when it was decided to leave the basilica just as it was, without a finished west front or portal or belltowers, features that it lacks to this day. The plan has a main apse flanked by two subsidiary apses. Its great aisled nave is without transept. The nave is flanked by sixteen chapels in the aisles.

Background and education Buxton was the son of Charles Buxton\\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. p19: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 and grandson of social reformer Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, 1st Baronet. His mother was Emily Mary, daughter of the physician and traveller Sir Henry Holland, 1st Baronet. He was born in London and educated at Clifton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, and was a member of the London School Board from 1876 to 1882. Political career In 1880, Buxton became prominent in political circles by the publication of his Handbook to the Political Questions of the Day, a work which eventually went through 11 editions. That same year, he ran for Parliament for Boston, but lost. However, he became an MP in 1883 by winning a by-election in Peterborough. He was defeated in the 1885 general election, but returned to Parliament the very next year, representing Poplar. He would represent this constituency in Parliament until 1914. From 1892‚Äì95, Buxton served as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. In 1905, he earned his first Cabinet post, that of Postmaster- General. In this capacity he introduced such services as penny postage to the United States, the Canadian magazine post, and cheap postage for the blind. In 1910, Buxton was named President of the Board of Trade; in this position he oversaw the passage or amendment of many trade and commerce laws. Upon the sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912, he asked Lord Loreburn, the Lord Chancellor, to appoint a commission of inquiry into the disaster. This commission eventually came to be headed by Lord Mersey. In February 1914, Buxton was appointed Governor-General of South Africa, and on 11 May of that year he was raised to the peerage as Viscount Buxton, of Newtimber in the County of Sussex. A revolt by some of the South African populace on the outbreak of the First World War temporarily threatened his safety, but the country's Prime Minister, General Louis Botha, immediately attached the Union of South Africa to Britain. Thereafter, Lord Buxton and General Botha formed an effective partnership, planning and executing South African actions in the war, including the invasion of the neighbouring German colony of South West Africa. Lord Buxton travelled widely throughout South Africa, and endeared himself to the people. Upon his retirement in 1920, the people demonstrated their affection for him. He continued his interest in South African affairs after returning to England, serving as president of the African Society from 1920‚Äì33. He was created Earl Buxton on 8 November 1920, and continued to be a member of the Liberal Party, often supporting his close friend and colleague Sir Edward Grey. In his later years, he had to undergo amputation of his leg due to a knee injury sustained earlier in his life. He died at Newtimber on 15 October 1934. Marriages Lord Buxton was twice married, firstly in 1882 to Constance Mary Lubbock (died 1892), second daughter of The 1st Baron Avebury, and secondly in 1896 to Mildred Anne Smith, elder daughter of Hugh Colin Smith, Governor of the Bank of England, of Mount Clare, Roehampton, a sister of the banker The 1st Baron Bicester and of Admiral Sir Aubrey Smith, RN.

Nasturtium was previously synonymised with Rorippa, but molecular evidence supports its maintenance as a distinct genus more closely related to Cardamine than to Rorippa sensu stricto (Al-Shehbaz & Price, 1998; Al-Shehbaz, Beilstein & Kellogg, 2006). Watercress or yellowcress is a common name for plants in this genus. These plants are related to garden cress and mustard, noteworthy for a peppery, tangy (pungent) flavor. The name Nasturtium comes from the Latin nasus tortus, meaning \\"twisted nose\\", in reference to the effect on the nasal passages of eating the plants. Nasturtium foliage is used as food by the caterpillars of certain Lepidoptera, including Orthonama obstipata (The Gem). One species, Nasturtium gambellii, is a federally listed in California as an endangered species in the United States.  Nomenclature  The genus Nasturtium should not be confused with the flowering garden annual commonly known as nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus).

Often other toppings are also added, such as cheese, onions, and mustard. The style has multiple regional variations in the United States, many calling for specific and unique sauce ingredients, types of hot dogs, or types of buns and referred to regionally under region-specific names. Regional variations =Texas wiener= In New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the \\"Texas hot dog\\", \\"Texas chili dog.\\" \\"Texas hot',\\" or \\"Texas wiener\\" is a hot dog with chili or hot sauce; it is served in variations with assorted condiments. The Texas wiener was created in Paterson, New Jersey, before 1920 and in Altoona, Pennsylvania, by Peter \\"George\\" Koufougeorgas in 1918 and originally called Texas Hot Wieners. The \\"Texas\\" reference is to the chili sauce used on the dogs, which actually has a stronger Greek cuisine influence due to the ethnicity of the cooks who invented it. It is considered a unique regional hot dog style. From its origins, the invention spread to the Pennsylvania cities of Scranton and Philadelphia. By the 1920s, it had reached Western New York, where numerous longstanding hot dog stands still remain, including a stand run by the Rigas Family (dating to 1921) and Ted's Hot Dogs (which opened in 1927). =Coney Island hot dog= In southeastern Michigan, a Coney Island hot dog is a European-style Frankfurter W√ºrstel (Vienna sausage) of German origin with a natural lamb or sheep casing, topped with a beef heart-based sauce, which was developed by Macedonian and Greek immigrants in the area. It has several local variations, including Detroit style, Flint style, and Jackson style. A Flint- style Coney Island hot dog =Hot wiener= In Rhode Island the hot wiener or New York System wiener is a staple of the food culture and is served at \\"New York System\\" restaurants. The traditional wiener is made with a small, thin hot dog made of veal and pork, giving it a different taste from a traditional beef hot dog, served in a steamed bun, and topped with celery salt, yellow mustard, chopped onions, and a seasoned meat sauce. =Michigan hot dog= In the North Country of New York State, a Michigan hot dog, or \\"Michigan\\", is a steamed hot dog on a steamed bun topped with a meaty sauce, generally referred to as \\"Michigan sauce.\\" =Cheese coney= Cheese coneys In Greater Cincinnati, Cheese coneys or Coney Islands (without the cheese) are hot dogs in buns topped with Cincinnati chili (a Greek-inspired meat sauce), onions, mustard, and cheese. =Carolina style= In North Carolina, hot dogs topped with chili, onions, and either mustard or slaw are referred to as \\"Carolina style\\", which is also used to refer to hamburgers with similar toppings. =Half-smoke= A half-smoke In Washington, D.C., the half-smoke is similar to a hot dog, but usually larger, spicier, and with more coarsely-ground meat, the sausage is often half-pork and half-beef, smoked, and served with herbs, onion, and chili sauce.

Early life Steyn was born in 1903 on a farm in the Orange River Colony, shortly after it had fallen under British rule during the Boer War. His parents were Christiaan Louwrens Steyn and Magdalena Josina Maria Kruger. He attended Kroonstad Secondary School and graduated with a law degree from the University of Stellenbosch in 1926, was admitted as an advocate (the South African equivalent of a barrister) in 1928, and obtained a doctorate in law in 1929.South Africa, Biographical Index, 1825‚Äì2005 Legal career There followed an illustrious career as a civil servant under four successive Prime Ministers. He was Attorney-General of South West Africa, which was then under South African administration, from 1931 to 1933, and worked in the Department of Justice from 1933 to 1944. He was appointed a King's Counsel in 1943. He assisted the South African delegation to the United Nations from 1946 to 1949, and was a legal adviser in the 1950 International Court of Justice hearing into South Africa's refusal to give up South West Africa. Steyn was appointed a judge of the High Court (Transvaal Provincial Division) in 1951. Shortly thereafter, in 1955, he was promoted to the Appellate Division. And soon after that he was appointed Chief Justice, ahead of the noted liberal judge of many years' appellate experience, Oliver Schreiner. This unprecedentedly rapid ascent reflected Steyn's favour with D F Malan's Afrikaner nationalist administration. As Chief Justice, Steyn acted ex officio as Officer Administering the Government, i.e. acting Governor-General, for the period between the death of Dr Jansen in 1959 and the installation of C.R. Swart in 1960, and again between Swart's resignation as the last Governor-General in 1961 and his inauguration as the first State President a few weeks later. It was he who administered the oaths of office to Swart on both occasions. Steyn's tenure as Chief Justice lasted twelve years. True to his appointment by an Afrikaner nationalist government, Steyn's jurisprudence was executive- minded and critical of English influences on South African law. He retired from the Bench in 1971. Personal life Steyn married Huibrecht van Schoor in 1928. They had two children. He died in 1976.

The submarine had a length of overall, a beam of and a mean draft of . They displaced on the surface and submerged. The A-class submarines had a crew of 2 officers and 11 ratings.

Construction and career A3 was built at Vickers, Barrow-in-Furness and was commissioned on 13 July 1904. She primarily served as a coastal defense and training submarine in her over seven years of service. On 2 February 1912, A3, along with several other submarines dispatched from the port of Gosport, conducted training exercises on target ships in the Solent. Whilst attacking the depot ship , A3 accidentally collided with its target. Its rudder and propeller were both disabled, and the submarine sank with all hands lost. The submarine was risen in March and was sunk as a gunnery target by shells from on 15 May 1912. In July 2016 the wreck of A3 was officially designated as a protected site.

The term can also be applied to those who uphold petty rules even at the expense of humanity or common sense. \\"Jobsworth\\" is a British colloquial word derived from the phrase \\"I can't do that, it's more than my job's worth\\", meaning that failing to do what is requested of them would be against what their job requires and would be likely to cause them to loose their job. The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as \\"A person in authority (esp. a minor official) who insists on adhering to rules and regulations or bureaucratic procedures even at the expense of common sense.\\"2nd Edition, Oxford University Press Jonathon Green similarly defines \\"jobsworth\\" as \\"a minor factotum whose only status comes from enforcing otherwise petty regulations\\". An example of the phrase in its original context in the 1965 Beatles movie Help!, when Roy Kinnear's character, the assistant scientist Algernon, exclaims \\"Well it's more than my job's worth to stop him when he's like this, he's out to rule the world...if he can get a government grant.\\" An example of the term in its fully formed metaphorical use was by UK folk-singer Jeremy Taylor, in a song he wrote in the late 1960s: The term became widespread in vernacular English through its use in the popular 1970s BBC television programme That's Life! which featured Esther Rantzen covering various human interest and consumer topics. A \\"Jobsworth of the Week\\" commissionaire's hat was awarded each week to \\"a startling tale of going by the book\\".BBC News: \\"Your job's worth more than you are\\". The term remains in use, particularly in the UK, to characterise inflexible employees, petty rule- following and excessive administration, and is generally used in a pejorative context.House of Commons Hansard Debates for 1 May 1996 (pt 10) \\"There seems to be here an element of what might qualify for Esther Rantzen's \\"jobsworth\\" award.

History The commission was established by the Marshall Aid Commemoration Act 1953 of the UK Parliament, in recognition of the Marshall Plan, which had provided economic support to Western Europe (including the UK) in the aftermath of the Second World War. The principal architect of the scheme was Sir Roger Makins (1904-1996), a Deputy Under Secretary in the Foreign Office. Soon after the bill was passed by parliament Makins was appointed British Ambassador to the United States. He was subsequently ennobled as Baron Sherfield. The commission has up to ten members, who are appointed by the British Government. The first chairman was Sir Oliver Franks (1905-1992), who had been British Ambassador to the US while the Marshall Plan was in operation. The work of the commission is administered by the Association of Commonwealth Universities. Twelve Marshall scholarships were awarded in the first year. The number of awards increased over the years with forty new awards made in 2017. Since 1954, approximately 1,800 Marshall Scholarships have been awarded. Marshall Sherfield Fellowships were established in 1997 for postdoctoral research. The fellowships are named after Lord Sherfield, who as Sir Roger Makins was the architect of the commission. Total expenditure in the year to March 2016 was ¬£2,157,267, of which 93% was funded by the UK government. Some scholarships were jointly funded from other sources. Marshall Scholarships Marshall Scholarships are for postgraduate study by US students at UK universities. Candidates are nominated by US universities and are interviewed by eight regional committees in the US, based at the British Consulates-General and at the British Embassy in Washington DC. The scholarships can cover courses of study from one or two years, extendable to three years. They pay university fees, a living allowance and travel from and to the US. Additional allowances are available for books and for research travel. Marshall Sherfield Fellowships Marshall Sherfield Fellowships support up to two American postdoctoral researchers to study at a UK university or research institute.

The town has a population of 690 (2013 census). In the MƒÅori language, \\"Tƒ´rau\\" means \\"place of many cabbage trees.\\" Tƒ´rau is a major junction in the New Zealand state-highway network. Just south of the township is the intersection of State Highway 1 and State Highway 5, where traffic from Auckland and Hamilton on State Highway 1 split to go either to Rotorua on SH 5, or continue along SH 1 to Taupo and beyond to Napier, Palmerston North and Wellington. State Highway 27 splits off State Highway 1 in the north of the town, providing a route north to the Coromandel Peninsula and an alternative route to Auckland, bypassing Hamilton. Tƒ´rau is primarily a farming town but in recent years has begun to exploit the income that comes from being at a major road junction. The small community of Okoroire (with hot springs) is located just north of Tƒ´rau. Okoroire railway station was over to the west of the hot springs, on the Kinleith Branch, opened on 8 March 1886 and closed to passengers on 31 July 1962 and to goods on 18 August 1968. The railway line remains open for freight. History and culture =European settlement= In the 19th century, Tƒ´rau, then Oxford, was originally planned as a large-scale city for the Waikato, however plans were changed after the entrepreneurial Rose family bought up large areas of land in the region, with the intention of making large returns when it came of high demand. Oxford later became a rural service town, and changed its name to Tirau in 1896. The name was spelled without a macron until 2019, when the New Zealand Geographic Board made Tƒ´rau the official name. =Railway station= Oxford railway station opened on 8 March 1886, from Auckland and from Morrinsville, where the Kinleith Branch is crossed by Okoroire Rd The line was extended south to PutƒÅruru and Lichfield on 21 June 1886. 563 passengers bought tickets in 1894, 330 in 1895 and 308 in 1896, when the main import was coal and the main exports timber and sheep. It was renamed Tirau on 8 March 1886 and closed to passengers on 12 November 1968 and to goods on 29 March 1981. The station had a small platform building, a goods shed and a water tower. =Recent history= In 1991, local business man Henry Clothier took advantage of the town's relatively cheap real estate and high traffic volume by opening an Antique shop in the former Rose Bros. grocery store building. Many other businesses followed suit off the back of his success throughout the 1990s until today. Tƒ´rau has built a reputation as a shopping destination for antiques, collectibles and other niche items. In 2005/06 the South Waikato District Council is working, on behalf of the Tirau Ward, in conjunction with the community, to develop a concept plan for Tƒ´rau's future. This project is taking the success of Tƒ´rau's transformation over the past decade and linking it with the requirements of the Local Government Act 2002 new emphasis on the four well-beings, social, economic, environmental and cultural. =Marae= The local PaparƒÅmu Marae and Te Apunga meeting house are affiliated with the NgƒÅti Raukawa hap≈´ of NgƒÅti M≈çtai and NgƒÅti Te Apunga. Tourism The Tƒ´rau 'good shepherd', outside the local church The town is now a well known tourist stop-off, and is characterised by many art works created out of corrugated iron. The church and many of the shops feature corrugated iron sculptures by local artist Steven Clothier and two large buildings are completely made from this material; the information centre which is shaped like a giant dog, and the neighbouring sheep and ram building \\\\- earning Tirau the title of \\"Corrugated Capital of the World\\". The Castle, a large toy museum on the town's southern limits which opened in 2000, can clearly be seen when heading towards the township from Rotorua or Taupo.

It resembles a carnival parade in some respects, but the vehicles (called lovemobiles) are usually less elaborately decorated. Unlike some carnival parades, a technoparade does not share the tradition of bombarding the spectators with sweets. However, the revellers do occasionally throw confetti (usually larger and more sparkly than that in a carnival parade) and spray foam from the vehicles onto the crowd. Nearly all of the vehicles are converted trucks. In order to power the amplifiers, the trucks are frequently equipped with an additional electrical generator. For safety reasons, horse- drawn floats are never used in technoparades: there would be a danger of horses panicking from the noise and chaos. However, there are occasional human-drawn floats equipped with generators, record players, amplifiers and loudspeakers. Some of the vehicles allow people to ride along, for a fee. For those on the sidelines, or travelling alongside on foot or bicycles, attendance is free.  Official program  The official program of a technoparade is generally not as important as what happens informally. In contrast to a carnival parade, the vehicles are little more than flatbed trucks with sound equipment, rather than elaborately decorated floats. There are usually no fireworks or other traditional elements of large celebrations. Technoparades are rarely linked to anniversaries of historical events: they usually simply take place in the summer to take advantage of the good weather. However, in Germany technoparades are usually officially registered as a political demonstration and thus have an appropriate motto. That way techno fans have a constitutional right to dance in the streets, and any objections from the authorities to noise and traffic obstructions are overruled and the cities also have to pay for security and cleaning up the streets afterwards.  Character  DJs deliver a constant stream of music from the parade trucks. Technoparades generally have a carnival atmosphere, where social rules (and some laws, or at least their enforcement) are at least loosened, and sometimes broken outright. An atmosphere of chaos and tolerance prevails as bystanders dance to the shifting sounds of successive vehicles rolling by them: the music blasting from one vehicle blends into that from another, which can mean a sudden change of dance style in the area where the spheres of influence overlap. The music coming from two sound trucks overlaps with approximately equal intensity, and people can dance to either of two competing rhythms. In the technoparade subculture they call this the Verwirrungsgebiet (\\"overlap zone\\") by analogy to a concept in radio frequency engineering. The street allows for a type of dancing that would be literally impossible in cramped German nightclubs, and the breadth of some people's dancing is further exaggerated as they throw their clothes outwards. Some in the crowd generally climb up to any high point that can possibly be scaled, more and more as the event continues. The spirit is usually continued at after-parties in the local nightclubs, sometimes including unofficial after-parties at venues having no official connection to the parade.  Problems  Law enforcement is often lax at Technoparades. Although not intended, sometimes things get destroyed by visitors of techno parades. The rain tube shown on the picture was torn down by a man in a slap-stick like manner when he tried to climb down from the roof of the building at the left on Street Parade 1997. At Street Parade 1998, it laid still at the place where it was put one year ago Technoparades are not without problems: * They are regarded by some participants as a license to consume illegal drugs. * A few technoparades have been exploited by makers of pornographic films. * There is an inherent danger of accidents as people climb on and off moving vehicles. * Technoparades usually have big crowds and few toilets, especially because the companies that rent out chemical toilets will not happily rent to technoparades; the crowds tend to climb on the roofs of the toilet structures, which are not built to withstand the weight. Some well- constructed toilets do exist, but not enough to serve the entire technoparade.

In contrast to technoparades which are characterized by free participation on the street, in this case only the passengers on the vessels or inside the trams are part of the event.

Typically those aged under 15 will be held in a Secure Children's Home and those over 15 will be held in either a Young Offender Institution or Secure Training Centre. Generally a young offender is regarded as such until the date of their 21st or 22nd birthday, whereupon he or she will be sent to an adult prison or can remain in the YOI until they turn 22 if deemed appropriate. Background Young Offender Institutions were introduced under the Criminal Justice Act 1988, but special centres for housing young offenders have existed since the beginning of the 20th century, with the first borstal being opened at Borstal, Kent in 1902. The regime of a Young Offender Institution is much the same as that of an adult prison. However, there are some slight differences, notably the lower staff to offender ratio. Prisoners serving sentences at Young Offender Institutions are expected to take part in at least 25 hours of education per week, which is aimed at helping them to improve their behaviour, to develop practical skills for use in the outside world and to prepare them for lawful employment following their release. There are also opportunities for prisoners to undertake work in Community Service Volunteer programmes. Violence can occur often in Young Offender Institutions. Some believe that staff do not always do enough to prevent violence. Inmates are often locked in cells for up to 21 hours a day and given little tuition or guidance. Three quarters of offenders released from Young Offender Institutions re-offend within a year. The use of isolation for young offenders is increasing though this is considered bad for their mental health. At all YOIs during six-month there were 306 cases of segregation lasting over a week, which is ‚Äúvery high‚Äù. Gang involvement, levels of prison staff and lack of NHS mental health beds may cause the rise in segregation. Offenders undergo risk assessments to assess the likeliness of reoffending. This assessment is known as Youth level of service.

Designed by Heinrich Strack after 1864 to commemorate the Prussian victory in the Danish-Prussian War, by the time it was inaugurated on 2 September 1873, Prussia had also defeated Austria and its German allies in the Austro-Prussian War (1866) and France in the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71), giving the statue a new purpose. Different from the original plans, these later victories in the so-called unification wars inspired the addition of the bronze sculpture of Victoria, the Roman goddess of victory, high and weighing 35 tonnes, designed by Friedrich Drake. Berliners have given the statue the nickname Goldelse, meaning something like \\"Golden Lizzy\\".Berlin Tourist Information - Tiergarten The Victory Column is a major tourist attraction in the city of Berlin. Its viewing platform, for which a ticket is required, offers a view over Berlin. History, design, and influences =Design and dimensions= Built on a base of polished red granite, the column sits on a hall of pillars with a glass mosaic designed by Anton von Werner. The column itself, designed by Heinrich Strack and inspired by the \\"lighthouse of Brescia\\" which stands in the Cimitero Vantiniano, the monumental cemetery of Brescia, consists of four solid blocks of sandstone, three of which are decorated by cannon barrels captured from the enemies of the aforementioned three wars. A fourth ring is decorated with golden garlands and was added in 1938-39 when the whole monument was relocated to its present position. The entire column, including the sculpture, is tall. =Designers and architects= Werner designed the original hall of pillars with a glass mosaic. The foundation is decorated with four bronze reliefs showing the three wars and the victorious marching of the troops into Berlin. They were created by: :* Moritz Schulz (1825-1904) :* Karl Keil (1838-89) :* Alexander Calandrelli (1834-1903) :* and Albert Wolff (1814-92) The relief decoration was removed in 1945. It was restored for the 750th anniversary of Berlin in 1987 by the French president at that time, Fran√ßois Mitterrand. Victory Column in its original size and location, on the K√∂nigsplatz across from the Reichstag, in 1900 =Location and relocations= Gladenbeck foundry, Berlin) View from the platform of the Victory Column towards Brandenburg Gate The Victory Column originally stood in K√∂nigsplatz (now Platz der Republik), at the end of the Siegesallee (Victory Avenue). In 1939, as part of the preparation of the monumental plans to redesign Berlin into Welthauptstadt Germania, the Nazis relocated the column to its present site at the Gro√üer Stern (Great Star), a large intersection on the city axis that leads from the former Berliner Stadtschloss (Berlin City Palace) through the Brandenburg Gate to the western parts of the city. At the same time, the column was augmented by another 7.5 metres, giving it its present height of 66.89 metres. The monument survived World War II without much damage. The relocation of the monument probably saved it from destruction, as its old site - in front of the Reichstag, at exactly 1,500 metres (one Roman mile) from the proposed new north-south triumphal way of the Nazis in line with the Imperial Victory Avenue in the Tiergarten - was destroyed by American air raids in 1945. Surrounded by a street circle, the column is also accessible to pedestrians through four tunnels, built in 1941 to plans by Albert Speer who likewise increased the width of the road between it and the Brandenburg Gate and designed the new Germania which was scheduled for construction after the victory obtained in the war. Via a steep spiral staircase of 281 steps, the physically fit may, for a fee, climb almost to the top of the column, to just under the statue and take in the views over the Tiergarten including the Soviet War Memorial, 1946, in line with the Nazi proposed north-south triumphal way by Speer and Adolf Hitler. Historical significance \\"El √Ångel\\", built in 1910 in Mexico City, bears a more than passing resemblance to the Berlin victory column, while both echo the earlier examples of the victory column crowned by an angel, notably the Alexander Column in Saint Petersburg. During the Battle of Berlin of 1945, Soviet Troops nicknamed the column \\"the Tall Woman\\". Polish Army troops, fighting alongside their Soviet allies, hoisted the Polish flag on the column on 2 May 1945 at the end of the Battle in Berlin. Polish flag raised on the top of Berlin Victory Column on May 2, 1945. It served as the location for Barack Obama's speech in Berlin as a US presidential candidate during his visit to Germany on 24 July 2008. The choice of site was controversial as it symbolises German military victories of the past and is seen by some as a monument to German militarism. In popular culture The golden statue atop the column, cast in 1873 by the Aktien- Gesellschaft Gladenbeck foundry in Berlin, was featured in the music video to U2's 1993 \\"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\\". In Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire (1987), the column is one of many such high places in the city where angels sit and look down. During the years of the techno Love Parade, the column was a meeting point where millions of people danced together. The Berlin queer monthly magazine Siegess√§ule was named after the monument, founded 1984 as a gay publication.https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/schwul-lesbisches-magazin- in-berlin-die-siegessaeule-wird-30/10983408.htmlTBS-Monatsinfo (Treff Berliner Schwulengruppen) (10 February 1984). \\"Gemeinsames\\".

History Breton and French Knights at the Combat of the Thirty in 1351. St Meriadek is said to have founded a chapel there during the 4th century. Much later Josslein became a stronghold of the House of Rohan. An alternative explanation for the location of the chapel concerns a labourer who in 808 discovered a wooden statue in the brambles which enabled his hitherto blind daughter to see. A chapel was constructed on the site of this miracle which subsequently grew into a church (parts of which date back to the twelfth century). A fresco in the church now recalls the Combat of the Thirty summarized below. In 1351, during the Breton War of Succession (part of the Hundred Years' War), two groups of approximately 30 English knights (led by Robert Bramborough, the English captain of Plo√´rmel) and Franco-Breton knights (commanded by Jean de Beaumanoir, captain of Josselin) staged an arranged combat at a spot halfway between the Chateau de Josselin and Plo√´rmel. The Franco-Breton side eventually won after killing or capturing the English force, including Bramborough. This episode was later known as the Combat of the Thirty.

History In the 1990s gravure magazines started to feature photos of girls wearing bloomers and school uniforms, some magazines featuring exclusively those types of clothes. Fetish shops selling these types of clothes also started appearing in Japan. Along with loose socks they became the symbol of high school girls in the 1990s. They are also sometimes worn as cosplay. Burusera shops Burusera shops sell used girls' gym suits and school uniforms. They also sell other goods procured from schoolgirls, e.g. undergarments, school swimsuits for physical education, socks, stationery, sanitary napkins and tampons. The clothes are often accompanied by ostensibly genuine photos of the girls wearing them. The clients are men who use the items for sexual arousal or stimulation. Schoolgirls once openly participated in the sale of their used garments, either through burusera shops or using mobile phone sites to sell directly to clients. Legal restrictions In August 1994, a burusera shop manager who made a schoolgirl sell her used underwear was arrested by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department on suspicion of violation of article 34 of the Child Welfare Act and article 175 of the Criminal Code.

He is now a farmer in Spain and the author of several popular autobiographical works. Background and musical career Stewart grew up in Horsham, Sussex. He was a classmate of Tony Banks and Peter Gabriel at Charterhouse in Surrey, and joined them in a school band called the Garden Wall. This was joined by classmates Mike Rutherford and Anthony Phillips to form Anon, which was renamed Genesis in January 1967. Stewart appears on Genesis's first two singles, \\"The Silent Sun\\" / \\"That's Me\\" and \\"A Winter's Tale\\" / \\"One-Eyed Hound.\\" Although several demos from Stewart's time with the band appear on the Genesis Archive 1967-75 box set, he is not credited with playing on any of them (though one track features drumming that may have been done by Stewart). Farmer and author At the recommendation of Jonathan King, Stewart was - rather unelegantly - fired from the band in the summer of 1968 due to his poor technique and was replaced by John Silver. After travelling and working throughout Europe, Stewart settled and bought a farm named El Valero in the Alpujarras region of Andalucia, where he lives and works with his wife Ana Exton and daughter Chlo√´. He came in last place for the position of local councillor in the 27 May 2007 local elections in √ìrgiva representing the Green Party, where he received 201 votes (roughly 8%). He is now known for his autobiographical books, Driving Over Lemons: An Optimist in Andalucia (1999, ) and the sequels, A Parrot In The Pepper Tree () and The Almond Blossom Appreciation Society (2006, ), about his life farming in Spain. All three are also available as audiobooks (Lemons , Parrot , and Almond ), narrated by Stewart. Stewart's publisher, Sort of Books, announced plans to release yet another Stewart memoir in 2009, this one focused on sailing, entitled Three Ways to Capsize a Boat: An Optimist Afloat.\\"Lemon prequel for Sort of Books\\" , The Bookseller, 9 January 2009; retrieved 29 January 2009.

It is broadcast on radio as well as distributed through media such as tape, CD, and podcast. A radio documentary, or feature, covers a topic in depth from one or more perspectives, often featuring interviews, commentary, and sound pictures. A radio feature may include original music compositions and creative sound design or can resemble traditional journalistic radio reporting, but covering an issue in greater depth.  History  = Origins = The early stages of fiction audio storytelling did not entirely resemble what would later be called radio documentary. In the 1930s, with radio stations like WNYC entering the airspace, reporters documented real people and real life scenarios through short on-the-ground interviews rather than dramatization. Other notable documentary broadcasts include the unrefined one-shot audio recordings of events, such as the Hindenburg disaster in 1937. By 1939, CBS responded to growing anxieties about immigration in the U.S. with a six-month series, titled \\"Americans All‚Ä¶Immigrants All,\\" that highlighted the stories of immigrant communities. The lack of documentary style reporting in this era can be attributed, in part, to technological limitations; recording equipment was not easily portable. = 1940s = An important moment in the establishment of radio documentary as a widely used and discussed format is the expansion of portable audio recording devices. In 1945, sound archivist and radio producer, Tony Schwartz began to use portable audio recording equipment to collect the sounds of his neighborhood in New York City to share on his WNYC radio show; his features ran for 30 years and grew to include the sounds of daily life recorded by and mailed to him from people around the world. This style of sharing true-life sound bytes would remain in public radio documentary. In 1946, one of the most pivotal developments in the spread and stylization of radio documentary was the creation of the CBS Documentary Unit. It was the first sector of a major media network dedicated to this format of radio. The unit was \\"'devoted exclusively to the production of programs dealing with major domestic and international issues and involving extraordinary research and preparation'\\". Not only did the content deviate from programming that favors advertisers, the style deviated from the standard, creating a well known format. The style of reporting for the CBS features was adopted and melded by ABC and NBC networks. The format included extensive interviews to gain multiple perspectives of an issue, an adherence to journalistic ethics, and often a call to action; the programming was usually released as multiple segments and at peak times. Examples of these first documentary projects include CBS' 1946 war feature, The Empty Noose, and ABC's 1949 program, V.D., A Conspiracy of Silence, addressing the lack of public attention to venereal disease. = 1970s = With the founding of National Public Radio in 1971, radio documentary began shifting again due to non-commercial educational media. For a short time, programs such as All Things Considered explored creative styles of presenting non-fiction by deviating from now traditional styles of radio documentary by hiring reporters outside of the radio sphere. = 1990s-present = Important shifts in technology have allowed radio documentary to travel beyond the analog. In the advent of podcasting and internet radio, the FCC provides no guidelines for these media. Programs are allowed to skirt FCC regulation, marking yet another shift in content and style of documentary programming. Current features that exemplify the new possibilities opened by podcasting include the often gritty subject matter of Love + Radio and the critical success of the podcast Serial due to the ability of listeners across the globe to access the content for free. Quotes Radio documentary in developing nations There has been tremendous interest in the field of Radio Documentaries particularly in the developing nations such as India, Iran, South Korea and Malaysia. In India for example, Radio Documentary is gaining in popularity due to the flexibility, efficiency and accessibility to the masses. Producers such as Chitra Narain and Danish Iqbal have been accredited with its revival and popularity in the region. Danish Iqbal who is primarily a Drama Producer combined the elements of Dramatic narrative to produce some memorable Radio Documentaries. His Documentary \\"Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai' is considered a Classic for the use of effective narrative and ambient sounds. This Documentary presents a heartfelt account of unseen bridges between a Kashmiri Shikarah Wala and his Auto Rickshaw Driver friend in Delhi. Although they never met each other but their unseen bond is the subject of this rare Documentary which transcends the barriers of political, religious and regional prejudices. Because both Chitra and Danish had a long tenure at Delhi and had creative collaboration with many Media Institutes, their influence is seminal in shaping the thinking of many of their students and co-workers. Danish won twice the prestigious Public Service Broadcasting Award for his documentaries.

Self-referential humor expressed discreetly and surrealistically is a form of bathos. In general, self- referential humor often uses hypocrisy, oxymoron, or paradox to create a contradictory or otherwise absurd situation that is humorous to the audience. Self-referential humor is sometimes combined with breaking the fourth wall to explicitly make the reference directly to the audience, or make self-reference to an element of the medium that the characters should not be aware of. Old Comedy of Classical Athens is held to be the first‚Äîin the extant sources‚Äîform of self-referential comedy. Aristophanes, whose plays form the only remaining fragments of Old Comedy, used fantastical plots, grotesque and inhuman masks and status reversals of characters to slander prominent politicians and court his audience's approval.Alan Hughes; Performing Greek Comedy (Cambridge, 2012) Examples RAS syndrome refers to the redundant use of one or more of the words that make up an acronym or initialism with the abbreviation itself, thus in effect repeating one or more words. However, \\"RAS\\" stands for Redundant Acronym Syndrome; therefore, the full phrase yields \\"Redundant Acronym Syndrome syndrome\\" and is self-referencing in a comical manner. It also reflects an excessive use of TLAs (Three Letter Acronyms). Meta has come to be used, particularly in art, to refer to something that is self-referential. Popularized by Douglas Hofstadter who wrote several books on himself and the subject of self-reference, meta-jokes are a popular form of humor. They contain several somewhat different, but related categories: joke templates, self-referential jokes, and jokes about jokes (meta-humour). =Joke template= This form of meta-joke is a sarcastic jab at the endless refitting of joke forms (often by professional comedians) to different circumstances or characters without a significant innovation in the humor.\\"Stars turn to jokers for hire\\" For example: *\\"Three people of different nationalities walk into a bar. Two of them say something smart, and the third one makes a mockery of his fellow countrymen by acting stupid.\\" *\\"Three blokes walk into a pub. One of them is a little bit stupid, and the whole scene unfolds with a tedious inevitability.\\" ‚ÄîBill Bailey *\\"How many members of a certain demographic group does it take to perform a specified task?\\" *:\\"A finite number: one to perform the task and the remainder to act in a manner stereotypical of the group in question.\\" *There once was an X from place B, *:Who satisfied predicate P, *:Then X did thing A, *:In a specified way, *:Resulting in circumstance C. =Class-referential jokes= This form of meta-joke contains a familiar class of jokes as part of the joke. Examples: * Bar Jokes: ** Three men walk into a bar... Ouch! (And variants:) ** A dyslexic man walks into a bra. ** Two men walk into a bar... you'd think one of them would have seen it. ** Two men walk into a bar... the third one ducks. ** A baby seal walks into a club. ** Two men walk into a bar... but the third one is too short and walks right under it. ** An Irishman walks past a bar. **The bar was walked into by a passive sentence... \\"active members only\\" was heard said. * What and Why Jokes: ** \\"What has four legs and barks?\\" \\"A dog.\\" \\"You heard it.\\" ** Why did the elephant cross the road? Because the chicken retired. ** What's an onomatopoeia? Just what it sounds like! ** Why did the chicken cross the road? To have its motives questioned. * Limericks: **W.S.

Here meta is used to describe that the joke explicitly talks about other jokes, a usage similar to the words metadata (data about data), metatheatrics (a play within a play, as in Hamlet), and metafiction. Marc Galanter in the introduction to his book Lowering the Bar: Lawyer Jokes and Legal Culture cites a meta-joke in a speech of Chief Justice William Rehnquist:Marc Galanter, \\"Lowering the Bar: Lawyer Jokes and Legal Culture\\", University of Wisconsin Press (September 1, 2005) , p. 3. > I've often started off with a lawyer joke, a complete caricature of a lawyer > who's been nasty, greedy, and unethical. But I've stopped that practice. I > gradually realized that the lawyers in the audience didn't think the jokes > were funny and the non-lawyers didn't know they were jokes. E. B. White has joked about humour, saying that \\"[h]umour can be dissected, as a frog can, but the thing dies in the process and the innards are discouraging to any but the pure scientific mind.\\"\\"Some Remarks on Humor\\", preface to A Subtreasury of American Humor (1941) Another kind of meta-humour makes fun of poor jokes by replacing a familiar punchline with a serious or nonsensical alternative. Such jokes expose the fundamental criterion for joke definition, \\"funniness\\", via its deletion. Comedians such as George Carlin and Mitch Hedberg used metahumour of this sort extensively in their routines. Hedberg would often follow up a joke with an admission that it was poorly told, or insist to the audience that \\"that joke was funnier than you acted.\\"Mitch Hedberg, \\"Mitch Hedberg - Mitch All Together\\", CD Comedy Central (2003) ASIN B000X71NKQ Johnny Carson in his Tonight Show career used to get laughs when reacting to a failed joke with, for example, a pained expression. Immediately following a failed joke about Lincoln's death Carson remarked, \\"A hundred years later, and you still can't do Abraham Lincoln jokes.\\" The latter remark got a better laugh than the initial joke. Similarly, Jon Stewart, when hosting his television program, used to wring his tie and grimace following an uncomfortable clip or jab. Eddie Izzard often reacts to a failed joke by miming writing on a paper pad and murmuring into the microphone \\"must make joke funnier\\" or \\"don't use again.\\" In one memorable scene, Groucho Marx said into a telephone, \\"Do you have Prince Albert in a can?\\" He then turned to face the camera and said to the audience, \\"Well, all the jokes can't be good, you have to expect that once in a while.\\" In the U.S. version of the British mockumentary The Office, many jokes are founded on making fun of poor jokes. Examples include Dwight Schrute butchering the Aristocrats joke, or Michael Scott awkwardly writing in a fellow employee's card an offensive joke, and then attempting to cover it with more unbearably bad jokes. The process of being a humorist is also the subject of meta-jokes; for example, on an episode of QI, Jimmy Carr made the comment \\"People laughed when I said I wanted to be a comedian. Well, they're not laughing now!\\"‚Äî a joke previously associated with Bob Monkhouse.

His creations during his twenty five years as Executive Pastry Chef (1979‚Äì2004) at the White House earned him the reputation of a creative genius. Mesnier was born into a family of nine children in the village of Bonnay, France. He first became interested in becoming a chef when he visited his brother's pastry shop in a nearby city and was delighted by the smell of fresh fruit in the kitchen. When he was fourteen, his mother secured an apprenticeship for him at a pastry shop in Besan√ßon. He worked from 6am to 8pm six days a week and in exchange received 300 francs a month, plus room and board, in addition to cooking lessons. Like most young apprentices, Mesnier was only given menial tasks, such as grocery shopping at first to see if he were truly interested in learning the profession. Mesnier stayed on and eventually was taught how to make cakes, croissants, and brioche. He also was first exposed to puff pastry and chocolate molding which laid the groundwork for his future specialties. At 17 he passed his apprenticeship exam and began to look for work that would both enhance his skills and his reputation. Eventually he found his way to Paris, working in a restaurant and pastry shop near the Op√©ra Garnier. He soon mastered all there was to learn in Paris and on the advice his employer he went to West Germany where techniques were more advanced. Mesnier lived in Hamburg and Hanover and learned how to make cakes, cookies, fondants, and marzipan modeling as well as mastering the German and English languages. Mesnier was hired as White House pastry chef in 1979 by First Lady Rosalynn Carter and retired on July 30, 2004.Executive Pastry Chef Roland Mesnier Bibliography * Dessert University: More Than 300 Spectacular Recipes and Essential Lessons from White House Pastry Chef Roland Mesnier, published August 10, 2004, * Sucr√© d'Etat : M√©moires du p√¢tissier fran√ßais de la Maison-Blanche, published February 14, 2006, * All the Presidents' Pastries: Twenty-Five Years in the White House, A Memoir, published February 13, 2007, [Note: this is an English translation of Sucr√© d'Etat] * Roland Mesnier's Basic to Beautiful Cakes, published October 16, 2007, See also * List of pastry chefs References *Judith Weinraub, 25 Years in the White House, Washington Post, 2 June 2004, Page F01 External links Bibliography available at Amazon.com Category:American male chefs Category:Pastry chefs Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:French emigrants to the United States Category:White House Executive Chefs Category:American food writers ","title":"Roland Mesnier"},{"id":"858509","text":"Schindleria brevipinguis is a species of marine fish in family Gobiidae of Perciformes.

A butler is a person who works in a house serving and is a domestic worker in a large household. In great houses, the household is sometimes divided into departments with the butler in charge of the dining room, wine cellar, and pantry. Some also have charge of the entire parlour floor, and housekeepers caring for the entire house and its appearance. A butler is usually male, and in charge of male servants, while a housekeeper is usually a woman, and in charge of female servants. Traditionally, male servants (such as footmen) were better paid and of higher status than female servants. The butler, as the senior male servant, has the highest servant status. He can also sometimes function as a chauffeur. In older houses where the butler is the most senior worker, titles such as majordomo, butler administrator, house manager, manservant, staff manager, chief of staff, staff captain, estate manager and head of household staff are sometimes given. The precise duties of the employee will vary to some extent in line with the title given, but perhaps, more importantly in line with the requirements of the individual employer. In the grandest homes or when the employer owns more than one residence, there is sometimes an estate manager of higher rank than the butler. The butler can also be assisted by a head footman or footboy called the under-butler. Background Butler c. 1922 The word \\"butler\\" comes from Anglo-Norman buteler, variant form of Old Norman *butelier, corresponding to Old French botellier \\"officer in charge of the king's wine bottles\\", derived of boteille \\"bottle\\", Modern French bouteille, itself from Gallo-Romance BUTICULA \\"bottle\\". The role of the butler, for centuries, has been that of the chief steward of a household, the attendant entrusted with the care and serving of wine and other bottled beverages which in ancient times might have represented a considerable portion of the household's assets. In Britain, the butler was originally a middle-ranking member of the staff of a grand household. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the butler gradually became the senior, usually male, member of a household's staff in the very grandest households. However, there was sometimes a steward who ran the outside estate and financial affairs, rather than just the household, and who was senior to the butler in social status into the 19th century. Butlers used always to be attired in a special uniform, distinct from the livery of junior servants, but today a butler is more likely to wear a business suit or business casual clothing and appear in uniform only on special occasions. A silverman or silver butler has expertise and professional knowledge of the management, secure storage, use and cleaning of all silverware, associated tableware and other paraphernalia for use at military and other special functions. Origin and history A slave in charge of wine in ancient Rome. The modern role of the butler has evolved from earlier roles that were generally concerned with the care and serving of alcoholic beverages. =Ancient through medieval eras= From ancient through medieval times, alcoholic beverages were chiefly stored first in earthenware vessels, then later in wooden barrels, rather than in glass bottles; these containers would have been an important part of a household's possessions. The care of these assets was therefore generally reserved for trusted slaves, although the job could also go to free persons because of heredity-based class lines or the inheritance of trades. The biblical book of Genesis contains a reference to a role precursive to modern butlers. The early Hebrew Joseph interpreted a dream of Pharaoh's ◊©◊ß◊î (shaqah) (literally \\"to give to drink\\"), which is most often translated into English as \\"chief butler\\" or \\"chief cup-bearer\\".Genesis 39-40. In ancient Greece and Rome, it was nearly always slaves who were charged with the care and service of wine, while during the Medieval Era the pincerna filled the role within the noble court. The English word \\"butler\\" itself comes from the Middle English word bo(u)teler (and several other forms), from Anglo- Norman buteler, itself from Old Norman butelier, corresponding to Old French botellier (\\"bottle bearer\\"), Modern French bouteiller, and before that from Medieval Latin butticula. The modern English \\"butler\\" thus relates both to bottles and casks. A pincerna depicted in service to a noble court during the Medieval Era. Eventually the European butler emerged as a middle-ranking member of the servants of a great house, in charge of the buttery (originally a storeroom for \\"butts\\" of liquor, although the term later came to mean a general storeroom or pantry).This was most likely from a loss of the original Latin meaning and the mistaken belief that buttery related to \\"butter\\". While this is so for household butlers, those with the same title but in service to the Crown enjoyed a position of administrative power and were only minimally involved with various stores. In a large house, the butler (centre-left) is traditionally head over a full array of household servants. This is the servant staff at the Stonehouse Hill of Massachusetts, the estate of Frederick Lothrop Ames, 1914. =Elizabethan through Victorian eras= The Steward of the Elizabethan era was more akin to the butler that later emerged.Anthony- Maria Browne, 2nd Viscount Montagu; Lord Montagu's Book of Rules and Orders, 1595. Gradually, throughout the 19th century and particularly the Victorian era, as the number of butlers and other domestic servants greatly increased in various countries, the butler became a senior male servant of a household's staff. By this time he was in charge of the more modern wine cellar, the \\"buttery\\" or pantry (from French pain from Latin panis, bread) as it came to be called, which supplied bread, butter, cheese, and other basic provisions, and the ewery, which contained napkins and basins for washing and shaving. In the very grandest households there was sometimes an Estate Steward or other senior steward who oversaw the butler and his duties. Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, a manual published in Britain in 1861, reported: > The number of the male domestics in a family varies according to the wealth > and position of the master, from the owner of the ducal mansion, with a > retinue of attendants, at the head of which is the chamberlain and house- > steward, to the occupier of the humbler house, where a single footman, or > even the odd man-of-all-work, is the only male retainer. The majority of > gentlemen's establishments probably comprise a servant out of livery, or > butler, a footman, and coachman, or coachman and groom, where the horses > exceed two or three. Glanusk Park in Powys, U.K., in 1891. The residence had 17 servants in residence. The largest stately houses could have 40 or more. Butlers were head of a strict service hierarchy and therein held a position of power and respect. They were more managerial than \\"hands on\\"‚Äîmore so than serving, they officiated in service. For example, although the butler was at the door to greet and announce the arrival of a formal guest, the door was actually opened by a footman, who would receive the guest's hat and coat. Even though the butler helped his employer into his coat, this had been handed to him by a footman. However, even the highest-ranking butler would \\"pitch in\\" when necessary, such as during a staff shortage, to ensure that the household ran smoothly, although some evidence suggests this was so even during normal times.Carrolyn Steedman, \\"The servant‚Äôs labour: the business of life, England, 1760‚Äì1820\\", Social History, Vol. 29 No. 1, (February 2004). The household itself was generally divided into areas of responsibility. The butler was in charge of the dining room, the wine cellar, pantry, and sometimes the entire main floor. Directly under the butler was the first footman (or head footman), although there could also be a deputy butler or under-butler who would fill in as butler during the butler's illness or absence. The footman‚Äîthere were frequently numerous young men in the role within a household‚Äîperformed a range of duties including serving meals, attending doors, carrying or moving heavy items, and they often doubled as valets. Valets themselves performed a variety of personal duties for their employer. Butlers engaged and directed all these junior staff and each reported directly to him. The housekeeper was in charge of the house as a whole and its appearance. In a household without an official head housekeeper, female servants and kitchen staff were also directly under the butler's management, while in smaller households, the butler usually doubled as valet. Employers and their children and guests addressed the butler (and under-butler, if there was one) by last name alone; fellow servants, retainers, and tradespersons as \\"Mr. [Surname]\\". Butlers were typically hired by the master of the house but usually reported to its lady. Beeton in her manual suggested a GBP 25‚Äì50 (US$2,675‚Äì5,350) per-year salary for butlers; room and board and livery clothing were additional benefits, and tipping known as vails, were common.D. Marshall, \\"The Domestic Servants of the Eighteenth Century\\", Economica, No. 25, (Apr. 1929), pp. 15‚Äì40. Available online with subscription The few butlers who were married had to make separate housing arrangements for their families, as did all other servants within the hierarchy. =Butlers in early United States= Robert Roberts's The House Servant's Directory, 1827. From the beginning of slavery in the United States, in the early 17th century, African Americans were put to task as domestic servants. Some eventually became butlers. Gary Puckrein, a social historian, argues that those used in particularly affluent homes authentically internalised the sorts of \\"refined\\" norms and personal attributes that would reflect highly upon the social stature of their masters or mistresses. One of the first books written and published through a commercial U.S. publisher by an African American was by a butler named Robert Roberts. The book, The House Servant's Directory, first published in 1827, is essentially a manual for butlers and waiters, and is called by Puckrein \\"the most remarkable book by an African American in antebellum United States\\". The book generated such interest that a second edition was published in 1828, and a third in 1843. European indentured servants formed a corps of domestic workers from which butlers were eventually drawn. Although not the victims of institutionalised slavery, many of them had not volunteered for domestic service, but were forced into it by indebtedness or coercion. As with African American slaves, they could rise in domestic service, and their happiness or misery depended greatly on the disposition of their masters. =The modern butler= Beginning around the early 1920s (following World War I), employment in domestic service occupations began a sharp overall decline in western European countries, and even more markedly in the United States. Even so, there were still around 30,000 butlers employed in Britain by World War II. As few as one hundred were estimated to remain by the mid-1980s. Social historian Barry Higman argues that a high number of domestic workers within a society correlates with a high level of socio-economic inequality. Conversely, as a society undergoes levelling among its social classes, the number employed in domestic service declines. Following varied shifts and changes accompanying accelerated globalisation beginning in the late 1980s, overall global demand for butlers since the turn of the millennium has risen dramatically. According to Charles MacPherson, President of Charles MacPherson Associates and owner of The Charles MacPherson Academy for Butlers and Household Managers, the proximate cause is that the number of millionaires and billionaires has increased in recent years, and such people are finding that they desire assistance in managing their households. MacPherson emphasises that the number of wealthy people in China has increased particularly, creating in that country a high demand for professional butlers who have been trained in the European butlering tradition.

There is also increasing demand for such butlers in other Asian countries, India, and the petroleum-rich Middle East.See for example Chadha, Monica. \\"Royal tips for Indian butlers\\", BBC News, 17 February 2003.

Higman additionally argues that the inequality/equality levels of societies are a major determinant of the nature of the domestic servant/employer relationship.Higman (2002). As the 21st century approached, many butlers began carrying out an increasing number of duties formerly reserved for more junior household servants. Butlers today may be called upon to do whatever household and personal duties their employers deem fitting, in the goal of freeing their employers to carry out their own personal and professional affairs. Professional butler and author Steven M. Ferry states that the image of tray-wielding butlers who specialise in serving tables and decanting wine is now anachronistic, and that employers may well be more interested in a butler who is capable of managing a full array of household affairs‚Äîfrom providing the traditional dinner service, to acting as valet, to managing high-tech systems and multiple homes with complexes of staff. While in truly grand houses the modern butler may still function exclusively as a top-ranked household affairs manager, in lesser homes, such as those of dual-income middle-class professionals, they perform a full array of household and personal assistant duties, including mundane housekeeping. Elizabeth Camille, a butler in Sydney, states, \\"I still make beds, clean toilets and peg out washing.... It's not all as glamorous as people perceive it to be.\\" Additionally see \\"Desperately seeking Jeeves\\", The Globe and Mail (Canada), 20 July 2007. Lynda Reeves, president of the Toronto- based House & Home Media, says that the term \\"butler\\" today is just \\"a pretentious name for a housekeeper\\". Butlers today may also be situated within corporate settings, embassies, cruise ships, yachts, or within their own small \\"Rent-a-Butler\\" business or similar agency.Jones, Harvey. \\"More money than time? Rent a butler\\". The Independent (UK), 15 December 2001. Available online. Archived by WebCite. Also see http://www.rentabutler.de and http://www.rentabutler.nl/. Along with these changes of scope and context, butlering attire has changed. Whereas butlers have traditionally worn a special uniform that separated them from junior servants, and although this is still often the case, butlers today may wear more casual clothing geared for climate, while exchanging it for formal business attire only upon special service occasions. There are cultural distinctions, as well. In the United States, butlers may frequently don a polo shirt and slacks, while in Bali they typically wear sarongs.Patrao, Michael. \\"The alter ago of Jeeves\\". The Deccan Herald, 27 July 2007. Available online. Archived by WebCite. In 2007, the number of butlers in Britain had risen to an estimated 5,000. Training Butlers traditionally learned their position while progressing their way up the service ladder. For example, in the documentary The Authenticity of Gosford Park, retired butler Arthur Inch (born 1915) describes starting as a hall boy.The Authenticity of Gosford Park, Documentary featurette in Gosford Park Collector's Edition DVD, Universal Studios, 2002. While this is still often the case, numerous private butlering schools exist today, such as The British Butler Institute.Simon (10 Feb 2007). Additionally, major up-market hotels such as the Ritz-Carlton offer traditional butler training, while some hotels have trained a sort of pseudo-butler for service in defined areas such as \\"technology butlers\\", who fix guests' computers and other electronic devices, and \\"bath butlers\\" who draw custom baths. Gender and butlering Butlers have traditionally been male, and this remains the norm. Probably the first mention of a female butler is in the 1892 book Interludes being Two Essays, a Story, and Some Verses by Horace Smith. In it Smith quotes the noted writer and Anglican clergyman Sydney Smith, who between 1809 and 1829 struggled to make ends meet in a poorly paid assignment to a rural parish in Yorkshire: > \\"I turned schoolmaster to educate my son, as I could not afford to send him > to school. Mrs. Sydney turned schoolmistress to educate my girls as I could > not afford a governess. I turned farmer as I could not let my land. A man > servant was too expensive, so I caught up a little garden girl, made like a > milestone, christened her Bunch, put a napkin in her hand, and made her my > butler.

Today, female butlers are sometimes preferred, especially for work within West Asian and Southeast Asian families where there may be religious objections for men to work closely with women in a household.See \\"Unique Rosewood Ladies Floor could start trend in Saudi, Middle East Hotels\\", 12 October 2007.

Archived by WebCite. Despite these trends, the Ivor Spencer School asserts that female butlers are not easily placed, on the whole. The Charles MacPherson Academy for Butlers and Household Managers reports that 40 per cent of the students admitted into its program are women. The school goes on to report that the labour market still has a preference for male butlers; however, the market is becoming more progressive and increasing numbers of female butlers are being hired.Charles MacPherson (9, April 2014) In ancient times, the roles precursive to butlering were reserved for chattel or those confined within heredity-based class structures. With the advent of the medieval era, butlering became an opportunity for social advancement‚Äîeven more so during Victorian times. Although still based upon various antecedent roles as manifested during different eras, butlering today has frequently taken over many of the roles formerly reserved for lower-ranking domestic servants. At the same time it has become a potentially lucrative career option.In Loeffler (15 April 2007), Nathalie Laitmon of The Calendar Group in Stamford, Connecticut, states that skilled butlers within the grandest households can make USD 200,000 (GBP 101,500). She states, \\"The bigger the lifestyle of the family, the more they can earn\\". Notable butlers * Eugene Allen, White House butler who served under eight U.S. presidents * Paul Burrell, butler to Diana, Princess of Wales * Leslie Bartlett, butler, toastmaster; and founder of The London School of British Butlers * Alonzo Fields, White House chief butler from 1932‚Äì1953 In visual art Heads of Six of Hogarth's Servants Butlers have been occasionally depicted in visual art. A famous painting, Heads of Six of Hogarth's Servants (c. 1758), is unique among such works. In it, the 18th-century English artist William Hogarth depicted his household servants, all surrounding the butler. In showing the group in a close-knit assemblage rather than in the performance of their routine household duties, Hogarth sought to humanise and dignify them in a manner akin to wealthy-class members, who were the normal subjects of such portraits. While this was a subversive act that certainly raised many eyebrows in his day‚ÄîHogarth conspicuously displayed the work in his estate home in full view of guests‚Äîat the same time he had painted his servants' facial expressions to convey the sincerity and deference expected of servant-class members. In contemporary art, \\"The Butler's in Love\\" series by U.S. artist Mark Stock is especially poignant. In the series, Stock portrays the butler as sick with love, but the possibility of fulfillment is hopeless: the love is a forbidden love, perhaps felt for the lady of the house, and so it must be suffered alone in silent concealment. In addition to the ongoing mannerisms and facial expressions of the butler, a seated lady once appearing in a curtained room and a recurring lipstick-stained absinthe glass over which the butler obsesses provide the interpretive clues. In selecting a butler as his subject, Stock sought to provide a \\"universal character\\", a pathos-laden figure that could be widely related to and that could depict the universality of loneliness felt by someone who can only look in from the outside. Stock began the series in 1985 to express his difficult feelings during a personal experience of unrequited love. One of the paintings was inspiration for a 3-D short film, \\"The Butler's in Love\\" by actor/director David Arquette, shot in 2008 at San Francisco's historic Westerfield Mansion.Croft, Karen. \\"Butlers in Love\\", Salon, 24 May 2001.

In fiction The real-life modern butler attempts to be discreet and unobtrusive, friendly but not familiar, keenly anticipative of the needs of his or her employer, and graceful and precise in execution of duty. The butler of fiction, by contrast, often tends to be larger than life and has become a plot device in literature and a traditional role in the performing arts. Butlers may provide comic relief with wry comments, clues as to the perpetrators of various crimes, and are represented as at least as intelligent and moral as their ‚Äúbetters,‚Äù or even more so. They are often portrayed as being serious and expressionless and in the case that the wealthy hero is an orphan‚Äîsuch as Batman, Chrono Crusade's Satella Harvenheit, or Tomb Raider's Lara Croft‚Äîmay be a father figure to said hero. Regardless of the genre in which they are cast, butlers in fiction almost invariably follow the \\"British butler\\" model and are given an appropriate- sounding surname. The fictional butler tends to be given a typical Anglo- Celtic surname and have an English accent. The Asian, African American, or Caribbean houseboy is a variant, but even these major-domos are based on the British icon. Today, butlers are usually portrayed as being refined and well- spoken. However, in 19th century fiction such as Dracula, butlers generally spoke with a strong Cockney or other regional accent. \\"The butler\\" is integral to the plot of countless potboilers and melodramas, whether or not the character has been given a name. Butlers figure so prominently in period pieces and whodunits that they can be considered stock characters in film and theatre, where a catchphrase is \\"The butler did it!\\" The best-known fictional manservant, and the archetype of the quintessential British butler, is himself not a butler at all. Reginald Jeeves, the iconic creation of author P. G. Wodehouse is a \\"gentleman's gentleman\\" and general factotum. Probably the best-known fictional butlers are Alfred from the Batman comic and films; Hudson of Upstairs, Downstairs television fame; Mr Carson from the Downton Abbey television series; and Crichton from J. M. Barrie's The Admirable Crichton. Lesser-knowns include Mr. Belvedere from the novel Belvedere, which was adapted into a feature film with sequels and later a television series; Lurch, from the television series The Addams Family, based on Charles Addams' The New Yorker cartoons; Beach, from the Wodehouse series about Blandings Castle; Niles, the butler at the Sheffield house in American sitcom The Nanny, Geoffrey from The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Bailey (an English canine butler) from the children's animated television series Arthur and Benson from the two series Soap and Benson. Not all fictional butlers portray the \\"butler stereotype\\", however. Alan Bates, who played the butler Jennings in the film Gosford Park, was coached in brooding detail by Arthur Inch, a longtime real- life butler.\\"The man who got it right for Gosford Park and told Richard E Grant what was wrong\\", Mid Sussex Times, 2002. Available online. Archived by WebCite. Also see The Authenticity of Gosford Park. Mr. Stevens, the butler played by Anthony Hopkins in the film Remains of the Day, was also acted with remarkable realism. A female butler, Sarah Stevens, is the principal character in Linda Howard's 2002 Dying to Please, a murder/romance novel.

Many books detailing specific techniques of martial arts are often erroneously called manuals but were written as treatises. Prose descriptions of martial arts techniques appear late within the history of literature, due to the inherent difficulties of describing a technique rather than just demonstrating it. The earliest extant manuscript on armed combat (as opposed to unarmed wrestling) is Royal Armouries Ms. I.33 (\\"I.33\\"), written in Franconia around 1300. Not within the scope of this article are books on military strategy such as Sun Tzu's The Art of War (before 100 BC) or Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus' De Re Militari (4th century), or military technology, such as De rebus bellicis (4th to 5th century). Predecessors Detail of the wrestling scenes at Beni Hasan. Some early testimonies of historical martial arts consist of series of images only. The earliest example is a fresco in tomb 15 at Beni Hasan, showing illustrations of wrestling techniques dating to the 20th century BCE. Similar depictions of wrestling techniques are found on Attic vases dating to Classical Greece. The only known instance of a book from classical antiquity is Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 466 from the 2nd century CE, detailing Greek wrestling techniques. There are some examples in the Chinese classics that may predate the turn of the Common Era: the Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian (c. 100 BCE) documents wrestling, referring to earlier how-to manuals\\" of the Western Han (2nd century BCE), which have however not survived. An extant Chinese text on wrestling is \\"Six Chapters of Hand Fighting\\" included in the 1st century CE Book of Han. All other extant manuals date to the Middle Ages or later. The \\"combat stele\\" at Shaolin Monastery dates to 728 CE. The earliest text detailing Indian martial arts is the Agni Purana (c. 8th century), which contains several chapters giving descriptions and instructions on fighting techniques.P. C. Chakravarti (1972). The art of warfare in ancient India. Delhi. It described how to improve a warrior's individual prowess and kill enemies using various methods in warfare whether they went to war in chariots, horses, elephants or on foot. Foot methods were subdivided into armed combat and unarmed combat.J. R. Svinth (2002). A Chronological History of the Martial Arts and Combative Sports. Electronic Journals of Martial Arts and Sciences. The former included the bow and arrow, the sword, spear, noose, armour, iron dart, club, battle axe, chakram and trident. The latter included wrestling, knee strikes, punching and kicking methods. The oldest extant European martial arts manual is Royal Armouries Ms. I.33 (c. 1300). \\"Illustrations only\\" manuals do not become extinct with the appearance of prose instructions, but rather exist alongside these, e.g. in the form of the Late Medieval German illuminated manuscripts.

Fechtbuch (plural Fechtb√ºcher) is Early New High German for \\"combat manual\\",fechten is cognate to English fight and still meant \\"fight, combat\\" in general in Early Modern times; in contemporary Standard German, fechten translates to \\"fencing\\", while the noun Gefecht retains the generic meaning of \\"fight, battle\\". one of the manuscripts or printed books of the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance containing descriptions of a martial art. Usually, the term is taken to include 15th- and 16th-century German manuals, but the nature of the subject matter does not allow a clear separation of these from treatises from other parts of Europe on one hand (particularly from the Italian and French schools), and from manuals of later centuries on the other hand.

The name of the system refers to the number of steradians (4œÄ) in a sphere. Development began in 1965, deliveries in 1967. It descends from the approach used in the System/360 mainframe family of computers in that members of the family were intended for use in many varied user applications. Previously custom computers had been designed for each aerospace application, which was extremely costly.  Models  System/4 Pi consisted of basic models: * Model TC (Tactical Computer) - A briefcase-size computer for applications such as missile guidance, helicopters, satellites and submarines. Weight: about * Model CP (Customized Processor/Cost Performance) - An intermediate-range processor for applications such as aircraft navigation, weapons delivery, radar correlation and mobile battlefield systems. Weight: total ** Model CP-2 (Cost Performance - Model 2), weight * Model EP (Extended Performance) - A large-scale data processor for applications requiring real-time processing of large volumes of data, such as manned spacecraft, airborne warning and control systems and command and control systems. Weight:  System/360 connections  Connections with System/360: * main storage arrays of System/4 Pi were assembled from core planes that were militarized versions of those used in IBM System/360 computers * software was for both 360 and 4 Pi * Model EP used an instruction subset of IBM System/360 (Model 44) - user programs could be checked on System/360  Uses  The Skylab space station employed the model TC-1, which had a 16-bit word length and 16,384 words of memory with a custom input/output assembly. AP-101 The AP-101, being the top-of-the-line of the System/4 Pi range, shares its general architecture with the System/360 mainframes. It has 16 32-bit registers, and uses a microprogram to define an instruction set of 154 instructions. Originally only 16 bits were available for addressing memory; later this was extended with four bits from the program status word register, allowing a directly addressable memory range of 1M locations. This avionics computer has been used in the U.S. Space Shuttle, the B-52 and B-1B bombers, and other aircraft. It is a repackaged version of the AP-1 used in the F-15 fighter.Computers in Spaceflight: The NASA Experience - Chapter Four - Computers in the Space Shuttle Avionics System When it was designed, it was a high-performance pipelined processor with core memory. While its specifications are exceeded by most of the modern microprocessors, it was considered high-performance for its era as it could process 480,000 instructions per second (compared to the 7,000 instructions per second of the computer used on Gemini spacecraft). It remained in service on the Space Shuttle because it worked, was flight-certified, and developing a new system would have been too expensive. The Space Shuttle AP-101s were augmented by glass cockpit technology. The B-1B bomber employs a network of eight model AP-101F computers. Semiconductor memory board from an IBM AP-101S Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer. The AP-101B originally used in the Shuttle had core memory. The AP-101S upgrade in the early 1990s used semiconductor memory. Each AP-101 on the Shuttle was coupled with an Input-Output Processor (IOP), consisting of one Master Sequence Controller (MSC) and 24 Bus Control Elements (BCEs). The MSC and BCEs executed programs from the same memory system as the main CPU, offloading control the Shuttle's serial data bus system from the CPU. The Space Shuttle used five AP-101 computers as general- purpose computers (GPCs). Four operated in sync, for redundancy, while the fifth was a backup running software written independently. The Shuttle's guidance, navigation and control software was written in HAL/S, a special- purpose high-level programming language, while much of the operating system and low-level utility software was written in assembly language. AP-101s used by the US Air Force are mostly programmed in JOVIAL, such as the system found on the B-1B Lancer bomber.Jovial to smooth U.S. Air Force shift to Ada.

It was a fast, agile aircraft, and the first interceptor in RAF service capable of speed higher than 200 mph (321 kmh). It was the fighter counterpart to the Hawker Hart light bomber. Design and development The Hawker Fury was a development of the earlier Hawker F.20/27 prototype fighter, replacing the radial engine of the F.20/27 with the new Rolls-Royce F.XI V-12 engine (later known as the Rolls-Royce Kestrel), which was also used by Hawker's new light bomber, the Hawker Hart. The new fighter prototype, known as the Hawker Hornet, first flew at Brooklands, Surrey, in March 1929.Mason 1992, p.213. The Hornet was a single-engined biplane, with single bay wings, initially powered by a 420 hp (313 kW) Rolls-Royce F.XIC engine enclosed by a smooth, streamlined cowling but was quickly re-engined with a 480 hp (358 kW) Kestrel IS.Goulding 1986, p.37. The prototype was evaluated against the similarly powered Fairey Firefly II, being preferred because of its better handling and its all metal structure, compared with the mainly wooden construction of the Firefly.Mason 1992, p.212. The Hornet was purchased by the Air Ministry at the start of 1930 and was subject to more tests, with a small initial production order for 21 aircraft (to be called Hawker Fury ‚Äì as the Air Ministry wanted fighter names that \\"reflected ferocity\\") placed during 1930. The Fury I made its maiden flight at Brooklands, with chief test pilot George Bulman at the controls, on 25 March 1931.Goulding 1986, p.38. The Fury was the first operational RAF fighter aircraft to be able to exceed 200 mph (322 km/h) in level flight. It had highly sensitive controls which gave it superb aerobatic performance. It was designed partly for the fast interception of bombers and to that end it had a climb rate of almost 2,400 ft/min (730 m/min, powered by a 525 hp/391 kW Kestrel engine). An experimental prototype, the High Speed Fury, was built to test design features for Hawker's planned competitor for the F.7/30 fighter competition (the Hawker P.V.3) as well as for more general development. While the P.V.3 was unsuccessful owing to the use of the unreliable evaporatively cooled Rolls-Royce Goshawk engine, many of the improvements tested on the High Speed Fury were incorporated in an improved Fury II, with a cleaned up airframe and reduced drag, powered by a 690 hp (515 kW) Mk4 Kestrel engine, which gave improved speed and rate of climb. Sidney Camm designed a monoplane version of the Fury in 1933. It was not developed until Rolls-Royce produced what became their famous Merlin engine. The design was then revised according to Air Ministry specification F5/34 to become the prototype Hawker Hurricane. Operational history The Fury I entered squadron service with the RAF in May 1931, re-equipping No. 43 Squadron. Owing to finance cuts in the Great Depression, only relatively small numbers of Fury Is were ordered, the type equipping No. 1 and 25 squadrons. At the same time, the slower Bristol Bulldog equipped ten fighter squadrons. The Fury II entered service in 1936‚Äì1937, increasing total number of squadrons to six. Furies remained with RAF Fighter Command until January 1939, replaced primarily with Gloster Gladiators and other types, such as Hawker Hurricane. After their front line service ended, they continued in use as trainers.Mondey 1994, p.142. The Fury was exported to several customers, being supplied with a variety of engines, including Kestrels, Hispano Suiza and Lorraine Petrel vee-type engines, Armstrong Siddeley Panther, Pratt & Whitney Hornet and Bristol Mercury radials. Three Furies were ordered by Spain in 1935, it being intended to produce another 50 under licence. The Spanish variant had a cantilever undercarriage design with Dowty internally sprung wheels, similar to that used on the Gladiator and was powered by a 612 hp (457 kW) Hispano Suiza 12Xbr engine, reaching a speed of 234 mph (377 km/h).Air International June 1980, p.286.Air International June 1980, p.288. The three Furies were delivered without armament on 11 July 1936, just before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. They were taken into service by the Spanish Republican Air Force, being fitted with machine guns salvaged from crashed aircraft. One Fury made a forced landing behind enemy lines due to a lack of fuel and was repaired by the Nationalists, although it was not used operationally, while the Republicans used one of the Furies in the defence of Madrid until wrecked in a crash in November 1936.Air International June 1980, pp. 288‚Äì289, 305. Although withdrawn from RAF squadrons, the Fury was still used by some foreign air forces in the early 1940s; Yugoslav Furies saw action against Axis forces in the German invasion of 1941. On 6 April 1941, a squadron of Furies took off against the invading German Messerschmitt Bf 109Es and Messerschmitt Bf 110s. In the resulting air battle 10 Furies were destroyed, almost the entire squadron. The commanding officer of the 36 LG was Major Franjo D≈æal, who watched from the ground as his men were slaughtered in their obsolete biplanes. In an unequal battle against superior adversaries, five aircraft were destroyed while taking off and eight pilots killed. Two more Furies and B√ºcker B√º 131 were destroyed on the ground. Of the attacking German aircraft, five Bf 109s and two Bf 110s failed to return, though most were non-combat losses, at least one was lost when rammed by a Fury. The other squadron of Yugoslav Furies active at the time of the invasion strafed enemy tanks and ground forces, some being lost to ground fire and one being destroyed in a dogfight with a Fiat CR.42. The rest of the Yugoslav Furies were destroyed when they became unserviceable or at the time of Armistice on 15 April. Ex-RAF Furies were also used by the South African Air Force against the Italian forces in East Africa in 1941 and despite their obsolescence, destroyed two Caproni bombers as well as strafing many airfields, destroying fighters and bombers on the ground. A total of 262 Furies were produced, of which 22 served in Persia, 3 in Portugal, at least 30 in South Africa, 3 in Spain, at least 30 in Yugoslavia and the remainder in the United Kingdom.

Surviving aircraft =Airworthy= 43 Squadron Hawker Fury A Hawker Fury Mk.I, serial number K5674 , is owned by the Historical Aircraft Collection and based at the Imperial War Museum Duxford in the United Kingdom. This aircraft was delivered to the RAF in 1935 and allocated to No. 43 Squadron, where it was flown until 1939 by Flying Officer Frederick Rosier, later to be Air Chief Marshal Sir Frederick Rosier. In 1940, it was sent to South Africa where it was flown by 13 Squadron (later 43 Squadron) of the South African Air Force. It was written off after making a forced landing, due to running out of fuel. It was returned to the United Kingdom in 2003 and restored to flying condition, with the civil registration G-CBZP. It made its first post-restoration flight in July 2012. =On display= A Hawker Fury Mk.I, serial number K1928, is being restored at Little Gransden Airfield by the Cambridge Bomber and Fighter Society.Cambridge Bomber and Fighter Society The aircraft was part of the first production batch of 21 aircraft built in the 1930s and was flown by No. 43 Squadron.

The Institute is based at the Temple of Peace in Cardiff. It has been a charity trust since inception in 1973 and became a registered charity with the Charity Commission in 2014. It had an endowment of ¬£1.2m in 2017‚Äì18.  History  The organisation's headquarters, the Temple of Peace in Cathays Park, was built in November 1938 by Minnie James of Dowlais, a bereaved mother of World War I victims, David Davies MP (later known as Lord Davies of Llandinam), and the King Edward VII Welsh National Memorial Association. The land was also gifted by the Montgomeryshire MP. In its early years it housed the King Edward VII Association, the United Nations Association (UNA) Wales, and in 1970 a successor organisation was proposed, which became the WCIA. The initiative for the foundation of the WCIA came in 1968 through a Western Mail editorial, which called for \\"Welshmen to look beyond the confines of Wales and Britain to extend their knowledge and understanding of the rest of the world.\\" Secretary of State for Wales, George Thomas MP was integral to bringing together the Association's Standing Conference. Among the early supporters were the Welsh Office, nearby local authorities, the University of Wales and education colleges, MPs, trade unionists, industrialists, churches, political parties, members of the media, and voluntary organisations. The opening ceremony was held on 11 October 1973 by Lady Tweedsmuir, Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

He is widely considered as one of the greatest living pianists. He was the first North American pianist to win the Leeds International Piano Competition, in 1972. Known as a leading interpreter of Bach, Handel, Scarlatti, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schumann, among other composers, Perahia has won numerous awards, including three Grammy Awards from a total of 18 nominations, and 9 Gramophone Awards in addition to its first and only \\"Piano Award\\". Early life Murray Perahia was born in the Bronx borough of New York City to a family of Sephardi Jewish origin. According to the biography on his Mozart piano sonatas CD, his first language was Judaeo-Spanish, or Ladino. The family came from Thessaloniki, Greece. His father moved to the United States in 1935. Perahia began studying the piano at age four, with a teacher, he said, who was \\"very limiting\\" because she made him play a single piece until it was perfect. He said his musical interests blossomed at age 15 for reasons he can't explain, and he began to practice seriously. At 17, Perahia attended Mannes College, where he studied keyboard, conducting, and composition with his teacher and mentor Mieczys≈Çaw Horszowski. During the summer, he also attended the Marlboro Music School and Festival, where he studied with musicians Rudolf Serkin, Alexander Schneider, and Pablo Casals, among others. He played duets for piano four hands with Serkin, who later made Perahia his assistant at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, a position he held for over a year. In 1965, Perahia won the Young Concert Artists International Auditions. In 1972, he was the first North American to win first prize at the Leeds Piano Competition, helping to cement its reputation for advancing the careers of young pianistic talent.\\"Previous Winners\\" , Leeds International Piano Competition Official Website, 2006. Accessed June 3, 2007. Fanny Waterman has commented (for Wendy Thompson's book Piano Competition: The Story of the Leeds) that Horszowski phoned her prior to the competition, and announced to her that Perahia would be the winner. Music career In 1973, Perahia worked with Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears at the Aldeburgh Festival, and with fellow pianist Radu Lupu. He was co-artistic director of the Festival from 1981 to 1989.\\"Perahia, Murray\\", Grove Music Online, 2007. Accessed June 3, 2007. In the 1980s, Perahia was invited to work with Vladimir Horowitz, an admirer of his art. Perahia says this had a defining influence on his pianism. He became close to Horowitz, whom he visited during the elder pianist's last four years to play for him. From 1973 - 2010, Perahia recorded exclusively for Columbia Masterworks, now Sony Classical. His first major recording project was Mozart's 27 piano concertos, conducted from the keyboard with the English Chamber Orchestra. In the 1980s, he also recorded Beethoven's five piano concertos, with Bernard Haitink and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. In 2016, Perahia signed with Deutsche Grammophon.http://www.deutschegrammophon.com/en/artist/perahia/ =Hand injuries= In 1990, Perahia suffered a cut to his right thumb, which became septic. He took antibiotics for this condition, but they affected his health.'I don't really have any technique'. Telegraph, 27 February 2003. In 1992, his career was threatened by a bone abnormality in his hand causing inflammation, requiring several years away from the keyboard, and a series of operations. During that time, he says, he found solace through studying the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. After recovering, he produced a series of award-winning recordings of Bach's keyboard works in the late 1990s, including a notable rendition of the Goldberg Variations. In early 2005, Perahia's hand problem recurred, prompting him to withdraw from the concert stage on the advice of his doctors. He cancelled several appearances at the Barbican Centre, as well as a 10-city national tour of the United States, but returned with recitals in German cities in 2006 and at the Barbican in April 2007. In autumn of 2007, he completed a 10-city tour of the United States. Owing to his hand problem, and on the advice of his doctor, Perahia cancelled a February 2008 solo recital at the Barbican Centre and a tour in the United States with the Academy of St Martin in the Fields (March and April 2008). He returned to the platform in August 2008, touring with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra under the direction of Bernard Haitink, and had an Asian recital tour in October and November. Recent activities Perahia has recorded Chopin's √©tudes, and Schubert's late piano sonatas. He is currently editing a new Urtext edition of Beethoven's piano sonatas. Besides his solo career, he is active in chamber music and appears regularly with the Guarneri and Budapest String Quartets. He is also Principal Guest Conductor of the Academy of St Martin in the Fields, with which he records and performs.\\"Murray Perahia\\" , The Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields Official Website, 2006. Accessed June 3, 2007. Since his return at the 2008 Proms season, Perahia has been continually active on the concert scene. Perahia appeared at Sir Neville Marriner's 90th birthday concert on April 1, 2014, playing Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, K 466 alongside the Academy of St Martin in the Fields conducted by Marriner.\\"Sir Neville Marriner at 90 concert, Royal Festival Hall, review\\", The Telegraph (Accessed: 17th April 2014).\\"Watch: Neville Marriner's 90th birthday concert\\", Classic FM (Accessed: 17th April 2014.) After 43 years (1973-2016) with Sony Classical (and its predecessor, Columbia Masterworks), Perahia has signed with the German label Deutsche Grammophon. His first release for the label, Bach's French Suites, came out in October 2016. Perahia's performance of Beethoven's Hammerklavier Sonata elicited this review from the Los Angeles Times: > Perahia threw himself into everything with a ferocious concentration. The > opening left-hand leap to the fugue's landing on a triumphant final cadence > 40 minutes later felt like a single gesture, a life passing by during a fall > and safe landing off a cliff. The epic Adagio was exceptional. Beethoven is > in a black mood. The twisted harmonies and endless melodic lines keep > shifting, trying to go one way and then the next, never finding resolution > or solace. For Perahia this was inescapable pain, but not to be dwelt upon. > His ability to find the life in each note proved intensely moving.\\"Pianist > Murray Perahia scales the Everest of Beethoven's 'Hammerklavier' in a > momentous performance\\" by Mark Swed, The Los Angeles Times, 28 April 2016 Jerusalem Music Center In January 2009, Murray Perahia was appointed president of the Jerusalem Music Center established by violinist Isaac Stern. In an interview with Haaretz newspaper he said: \\"Music represents an ideal world where all dissonances resolve, where all modulations ‚Äîthat are journeys‚Äî return home, and where surprise and stability coexist.\\"  Teaching  Perahia was invited to teach at the International Piano Foundation Theo Lieven (known today as the International Piano Academy Lake Como) to selected students. He has given masterclasses at such institutions as Juilliard School, Stanford University, and Peabody Institute, among many others. He held a Summer Course at the Jerusalem Music Centre in July 2017 to young Israeli pianists ages 12 to 18, including Niv Yehuda, Amir Ron, Yoav Levanon, Tom Borrow, Talmon Pachevsky, Yuval Shmila, and Tom Zalmanov. He continues to give frequent masterclasses as president of the JMC. In September 2020, he will hold a series of masterclasses in Munich on Beethoven Piano Sonatas, hosted by the renowned publisher G. Henle Verlag, with ten young professional pianists: Eden Agranat Meged, Elia Cecino, Yan Fang, Hyunji Kim, Song Hyeon Kim, Michael Lu, Nathalia Milstein, Misora Ozaki, Maksym Shadko, and Clara Isabella Siegle.  Personal life  Perahia lives in London with his wife, Ninette Shohet, who is of Iraqi-Jewish heritage. He has two adult sons, Benjamin and Raphael.

It is the largest tributary of the Duck River and is used for canoeing, especially in its middle section. The river is named for the Buffalo fish which was abundant when the first European settlers arrived. Sources The Buffalo rises in northern Lawrence County. Both the North and South Forks are crossed by U.S. Highway 43, the North Fork several times as it parallels that highway for about . The confluence of these two forks about a mile west of that highway is considered to be the head of the Buffalo. Course From the confluence, the Buffalo trends basically northwest for several miles, crossing into Lewis County, where it is crossed by the Natchez Trace Parkway. The confluence with the Little Buffalo River is in Lewis County as well, along with that of several other more minor tributaries. The stream is paralleled for a distance and then crossed by State Route 99 while flowing through the broad Texas Bottoms. In Lewis County, although meandering, the course of the stream is basically westward. Entering into northern Wayne County, the stream receives several more tributaries, most notably the Green River. A few miles below the mouth of the Green River near the community of Flatwoods, the Buffalo is bridged by State Route 13 and then turns to run a northerly course for the balance of its flow. It also crosses into Perry County near here. For most of its flow through Perry County, the Buffalo is roughly paralleled by State Route 13. Shortly after crossing into Humphreys County, it is bridged by Interstate 40 followed by Bakerville Rd. About 8 miles north of this is its confluence with the Duck. Watershed The upper part of the Buffalo River, in Lawrence County, is designated as a \\"State Scenic River\\" under the Tennessee Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The only incorporated towns along the Buffalo, Linden and Lobelville, are located in Perry County. Two unincorporated communities are adjacent to the river in Perry County, Flatwoods and Beardstown. =Hydrology= The Buffalo River watershed is the total land area that drains into the Buffalo River. It is designated as Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 06040004 by the USGS. It empties into watershed 06040003, the Lower Duck River watershed. The Buffalo River watershed is composed of three sub-watersheds; two sections of the Buffalo River and the Cane Creek sub-watershed. The southeastern part of the Buffalo River watershed is HUC 0604000401. It includes the headwaters of the Buffalo plus the Little Buffalo River and both Chief Creek and Fortyeight Creek. The western side and northern one-third of the watershed is HUC 0604000402. It reaches from the Green River in Wayne County at the southern end to the mouth of the Buffalo in Humphreys County. Cane Creek, the third part of the watershed is HUC 0604000403. It includes both Upper and Lower Cane Creek and stretches from the headwaters of Cane Creek near Hohenwald in Lewis County to the mouth of Cane Creek at Beardstown in Perry County. The Buffalo River watershed contains 1,200 miles of tributary streams and 349 lake acres of impounded water in ponds and water stored behind 10 dams. These dams are primarily in the southeastern portion of the watershed. The majority of the impounded water is in Laurel Hill Lake with plus an additional in the VFW Lake. TDEC has also identified some wetlands sites in the southeastern portion of the watershed. =Land Use= Land within the watershed is primarily forested land; 69% being deciduous, 3% is evergreen, and 4% is mixed forest. The second significant land use is agricultural crops. Pasture and hay fields account for 10% of the area while row crops occupy another 8%. Residential and commercial areas occupy less than 0.5% of the land. The soil in the watershed is primarily loam with some silty loam. The soil pH varies from about 4.85 to 5.45. Portions of the area are characterized by karst topography. Natural history The Buffalo is rich in aquatic life. Fishing it through passive methods such as limb and trot lines is traditional. There are many catfish and other non-game fish such as drum. The largest aquatic animal often found in the Buffalo is the alligator snapping turtle; which is in fact often caught (unintentionally for the most part) on trot and limb lines. These can easily weigh or more. TDEC lists 48 rare plant and animal species in the watershed. Rarity typically results from either a small population or a very restricted range. The non-aquatic species include 18 plants, one mammal, three birds, two reptiles, one amphibian, three insects and spiders, and one other invertebrate, There are 20 aquatic species associated with the river or its tributaries; 12 fish, one crustacean, three mussels, and four snails. =Fish= Identified rare fish in the Buffalo include eight varieties of Darters, one catfish (Saddled Madtom), and one Cavefish (Southern Cavefish). Most of the identified darters are listed as either Threatened or Endangered by either the State or Federal government. *Ammocrypta vivax, Scaly Sand Darter *Cyprinella monacha, Spotfin Chub ‚Äì Federal Threatened status *Etheostoma aquali, Coppercheek Darter ‚Äì State level Threatened status *Etheostoma boschungi, Slackwater Darter ‚Äì Federal Threatened status *Etheostoma cinereum, Ashy Darter ‚Äì State level Threatened status *Etheostoma denoncourti, Golden Darter *Etheostoma pseudovulatum, Egg- Mimic Darter ‚Äì State level Endangered status *Percina burtoni, Blotchside Darter *Percina macrocephala, Longhead Darter ‚Äì State level Threatened status =Crustacean= The Alabama crayfish, Orconectes alabamensis is a rare crayfish species found near the Buffalo. =Mussels= Three species of mussels are among the rare species listed by TDEC. Both the Cracking Pearly Mussel and the Pale Lilliput are listed by both State and Federal authorities as Endangered. *Hemistena lata, Cracking Pearly Mussel *Quadrilla cylindrical cylindrical, Rabbitsfoot *Toxolasma cylindrellus, Pale Lilliput =Snails= Four species of rare snails are found near the Buffalo; none of them are included by TDEC on species concerns lists. *Leptoxis praerosa, Onyx Rocksnail *Lithasia duttoniana, Helmet Rocksnail *Lithasia geniculata fuliginosa, Geniculate Rocksnail *Lithasia geniculata fulginosa, Geniculate Riversnail Geology All except a very small section on the southern end of the watershed is part of the Western Highland Rim, one of 25 Level IV subecoregions in the state. The dissected, rolling terrain in this area is of long ridges with fairly steep sides and deeply eroded hollows into those ridges, with the river in a wide flood plain of \\"bottom land\\". The elevation typically varies from . The predominant geology of the area is that of Paleozoic limestones. The Mississippian limestone base along with chert and shale is overlaid by fairly thin soils of moderate fertility that tend to be acidic. Much of the differential erosion leading to the terrain features is a result of the differences in deposition and mineralization of the various types of limestone in the area and the presence of large portions of chert. Some chert bears small quantities of the iron-containing mineral hematite or other oxides of iron. During the mid-to-late 19th century there was considerable iron-ore related mining and smelting of Limonite ore. The sizable tributary streams mostly flow out of fairly narrow hollows into the Buffalo; only the largest ones have true stream valleys of their own. Streams are fairly clear with a moderate gradient. Economy Canoeing float trips make a considerable contribution to the area's economy, which is fairly depressed compared to that of the state as a whole because of the general remoteness of the area. The Middle Tennessee Council of the Boy Scouts of America operates Grimes Canoe Base along the Buffalo in southern Perry County. A number of businesses provide commercial canoe and float access to the river for tourists. The river is primarily a Class I stream with significant stretches of flat water. Free float tubing is feasible in selected portions of the river. There are three trails associated with the river. * Buffalo River ‚Äì Perry County ‚Äì A scenic water trail through nature ‚Äì * Ladies Bluff Trail ‚Äì Perry County ‚Äì A scenic, hiking, wilderness trail ‚Äì ‚Äì Partially ADA compliant * Linden City Park Walking Trail ‚Äì Perry County ‚Äì Health and fitness trail ‚Äì ADA compliant =River access= * Metal Ford is accessible from the Natchez Trace Parkway about south of Tennessee State Route 20. * Lobelville, TN, Near Old TN-13 is a put in place with a 4 mile float to Cuba Landing Road (small fee required for takeout).

While the meaning of the surname \\"Schining\\" is uncertain, the suffix \\"ain Ringeck\\" may indicate that he came from the Rhineland region of south-western Germany. He is named in the text of his treatise as Schirmaister to one Duke Albrecht, Count Palatine of Rhine and Duke of Bavaria. Other than this, the only thing that can be determined about his life is that his renown as a master was sufficient for Paulus Kal to include him on his memorial to the deceased masters of the Society of Liechtenauer in 1470.Kal, Paulus. Untitled [manuscript]. Paulus Kal Fechtbuch (CGM 1507). Munich, Germany: Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, 1470. Ringeck seems to have authored one of the few complete glosses of the epitome of the grand master Johannes Liechtenauer, making him one of the most important German fencing masters of the 15th century. The identity of Ringeck's patron remains unclear, as four men named Albrecht held the title during the fifteenth century. If it is Albrecht I, who reigned from 1353 to 1404, this would signify that Ringeck was likely a direct associate or student of Liechtenauer. However, it may just as easily have been Albrecht III, who carried the title from 1438 to 1460, making Ringeck a second- or third- generation master carrying on the tradition.Tobler, Christian Henry. \\"Chicken and Eggs: Which Master Came First?\\" In Saint George's Name: An Anthology of Medieval German Fighting Arts. Wheaton, IL: Freelance Academy Press, 2010. Albrecht IV claimed the title in 1460 and thus also could have been Ringeck's patron; this seems less likely in light of Ringeck's apparent death within that same decade, meaning the master would have had to have penned his treatise in the final few years of his life. In its favor, however, is the fact that Albrecht IV reigned until 1508 and both the Dresden and Glasgow versions of the text were likely created during his time.  Writings  Ringeck is often erroneously credited as the author of the MS Dresden C487. While Ringeck seems to be the author of three of the core texts, glosses of Liechtenauer's verses on unarmored longsword fencing, armored fencing, and mounted fencing, the manuscript is an anthology of several treatises by different masters and is currently thought to have been composed between 1504 and 1519Handschriftencensus. Retrieved 27 September 2010. (well after the master's lifetime). Likewise, the MS E.1939.65.341, though often described as merely an illustrated version of the Dresden manuscript, is a separate anthology with its own collection of works by various authors and is internally dated to 1508.Internally dated on folio 22r. While it was not copied nearly as often as the more famous Anonymous gloss (often misattributed to Peter von Danzig), Ringeck's gloss nevertheless seems to have had a lasting influence. Not only was it reproduced by Joachim Meyer in 1570 as part of his final manuscript,Meyer, Joachim. Fechtbuch zu Ross und zu Fuss [manuscript]. MS Var.82. Rostock, Germany: Universit√§tsbibliothek Rostock, 1570. but in 1539 Hans Medel von Salzburg took it upon himself to create a revised version of Ringeck's Blo√üfechten gloss, integrating his own commentary in many places.

According to his own testimony, he was the student of one Hans Stettner, who was in turn an initiate of the tradition of Johannes Liechtenauer. He served as fencing master at three different courts in his career, serving in various military capacities including commanding men in at least three campaigns.Rainer Welle. \\"‚Ä¶ und wisse das alle h√∂bischeit kompt von deme ringen.

While several of these masters remain unknown, the majority wrote treatises of their own and Kal's list stands as an independent confirmation of their connection to the grand master. Kal's treatise is also interesting in that it represents the first attempt to give pictorial illustrations for parts of Liechtenauer's tradition of fencing.  Life  Little is known of Kal's early life, but from 1440 to c. 1449 he served Louis IV of the House of Wittelsbach, Count Palatine of the Rhine. In 1448, while in the count's service he participated in the defense Nuremberg, commanding a unit of wheel cannons below the gates.Quellen und Er√∂rterungen zur bayerischen und deutschen Geschichte, vol. 8. G. Franz, 1860. The Nuremberg Council notes from 17 March 1449 mention that he had broken the peace of the city at that time by drawing his weapons.Die N√ºrnberger Ratsverl√§sse, vol 1. Irene Stahl. Degener, 1983. Kal entered the service of Ludwig IX \\"the Rich\\" of the House of Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria-Landshut, on 29 September 1450. In 1461, he is mentioned commanding a unit of 12 marksmen. From 1465 to 1475, he seems to have also maintained a secondary occupation as a toll collector in Dingolfing.Geschichte der stadt Dingolfing und ihrer umgebung Von Joseph Wolfgang Eberl. F. Datterer, 1856. In November 1468, he participated in military actions on the Castle Saldenburg, which was successfully taken on 4 December.Baierische Landtags-Handlungen in den Jahren 1429 bis 1513, vol. 7. Bavaria: Landtag, Franz von Krenner, F.S. H√ºbschmann, 1804. Shortley thereafter, in c. 1470, Paulus Kal created a second, expanded version of his fencing manual for Ludwig IX, the current Cgm 1507 (as well, possibly, as the MS 1825). Kal is listed as a guest at the wedding of Ludwig's son George,Beytr√§ge zur vaterl√§ndischen Historie, Geographie, Staatistik, etc, vol. 2. Lindauer: Lorenz von Westenrieder, 1789. and continued in the duke's service until his death on 18 January 1479. On 12 February 1480, Paulus Kal entered the service of Sigismund, Archduke of Austria. Kal acted as one of the archduke's witnesses at a number of interrogations held on 17 October 1485 in Innsbruck, related to the witch trials being conducted by Heinrich Kramer at that time.Zeitschrift des Ferdinandeums f√ºr Tirol und Vorarlberg. Herausgegeben von dem verwaltungs-ausschusse desselben. Tiroler Landesmuseum Ferdinandeum, 1890. This is the final time that Kal's name appears in the histories. Several copies of Kal's treatise were created during the 1480s and 90s, including the extensive MS KK5126, but it is unknown if he directly commissioned any of them. In total, Paulus Kal's teachings are preserved in at least six manuscripts written between 1440 and 1514. The probable archetype, Cgm 1507, includes brief explanations in German for most devices (many extracted from Liechtenauer's record). There are four other text-less versions, and these were probably copied from the 1470 version. A sixth version was sold at auction in Italy during the 20th century as individual leaves; this copy contains single-word captions in Latin or Italian and was likely based on one of the four without text. In addition, Paulus Hector Mair based content in several sections of the Munich version (Cod.icon. 393) of his Opus Amplissimum de Arte Athletica on Kal's treatise. It appears that the copy he used for this was textless, and so he added his own extensive commentary on the images. The precise set of images Mair drew upon do not appear in any of the six extant manuscripts, which may signify that there was once a seventh copy of Kal's work which has since been lost.

McGee is a former ballet dancer and for three years was artistic director of her own ballet company. She presents a Sunday morning show for BBC Radio Berkshire. McGee was a finalist in BBC's 2017 Strictly Come Dancing, a winner of the 2019 Christmas Special, and as of January 2018 is a recurring member of the Loose Women panel. Early life and magic career McGee was born in 1958 in Kingston upon Thames, to Patrick McGee and Lillian Howes. She has two younger siblings, a sister called Donna and a brother named Robert.Index to the Register of Births for England and Wales, Oct‚ÄìDec 1958, District=Surrey N., Volume=5g, page=380 When McGee was young her parents ran a corner shop. Later, her father worked for a large manufacturing firm making gold rings and other jewellery. McGee attended Our Lady Immaculate RC Primary School in Tolworth, followed by Tolworth Girls' School, a secondary school also in Tolworth. At the age of 16 McGee auditioned for and won a place at the Royal Ballet School. After graduating, she joined the Iranian National Ballet Company in Tehran. Aged 19, she became part of the Corps de Ballet and later a soloist, but her ballet career was brought to an abrupt halt by the Iranian Revolution. She was forced to flee the country and returned to the UK with little in the way of money and possessions. Seeking new work she auditioned for the Bernard Delfont Organisation, which was responsible for a number of big summer resort shows and touring productions. Delfont found her a job performing on stage with magician Paul Daniels in his 1979 summer show in Great Yarmouth. She met Daniels on 23 May 1979 at rehearsals for the show, which were held at a church hall in London. She later joined Dougie Squires's Second Generation troupe as a dancer, which involved touring Europe with acts including Chris de Burgh and James Last. After winter work in pantomime, McGee joined Daniels again for his 1980 summer season in Bournemouth. She then performed in his London stage show It's Magic, which opened on 10 December 1980 and which, by the time it closed 14 months later, had become the longest running magic shows ever to play in the West End. McGee achieved national and international fame through television appearances with Daniels. After seeing her on stage in the West End, BBC producer John Fisher asked Debbie to appear in the BBC1 series The Paul Daniels Magic Show, which had begun in 1979. That series continued until 1994 and regularly attracted audiences of 15 million in the UK and was sold to 43 countries. Daniels regularly referred to McGee on his TV shows as \\"The lovely Debbie McGee\\", a phrase that entered popular culture as a stereotype for magicians' assistants. Daniels and McGee were married in Buckinghamshire in April 1988. In October 1991, McGee became the first female member of The Magic Circle, a society for British professional magicians. She celebrated by appearing on TV to perform a trick accompanied by Daniels as her assistant \\"The Lovely Paul\\", who was not allowed to speak during the performance. McGee was the 2017 winner of the Magic Circle's Maskelyne award \\"for services to British Magic\\", the same award that her husband received in 1988. McGee's pastimes include golf and she has played in celebrity charity events. Other work =Dance company= In 2000, McGee and Daniels set up Ballet Imaginaire to produce ballet shows and tour them around the country. However, the enterprise did not have financial success. =Radio= In 2004 McGee presented Box Jumpers, a two-part radio documentary about magician's assistants for BBC Radio 4. She works as a presenter for BBC Radio Berkshire, where, since 8 June 2008, she has hosted a regular Sunday morning show from 9 am to noon. On 12 June 2018, McGee was a guest on the BBC Radio 4 programme My Teenage Diaries. =Television and film= In 2001, McGee and Daniels were the subjects of an episode of When Louis Met... a documentary filmed by Louis Theroux. The episode, titled When Louis Met... Paul and Debbie, was broadcast on BBC Two and subsequently Netflix. In 2001, McGee appeared in the documentary Paul Daniels in a Black Hole, which challenged Daniels to be recognised as a famed magician in the United States within one week. McGee appeared on comedian Caroline Aherne's talk show The Mrs Merton Show in 1995; Aherne's character Mrs Merton asked McGee \\"what first attracted you to the millionaire Paul Daniels?\\", a joke which a poll later ranked as Britain's second-best one-liner. The couple later joked about the quip, with Daniels saying \\"when Debbie and I got married, I certainly wasn‚Äôt a millionaire and the other funny thing was Caroline had just married a millionaire so we thought that was hysterical\\". Calling the continuing popularity of the joke \\"lovely\\", McGee credits the appearance on Mrs Merton for kickstarting her own fame, saying \\"after Mrs Merton people started to really recognise me. It gave us great publicity.\\" In October 2004, McGee and her husband appeared on The Farm, Five's version of the RT√â show Celebrity Farm. In May 2006, she appeared on The X Factor: Battle of the Stars with her husband singing \\"Let Me Entertain You\\" by Robbie Williams. Debbie and Paul were knocked out in the first round of the talent show. On 1 April 2007, McGee appeared along with her husband, Vanessa Feltz, and her fianc√© Ben Ofoedu in a celebrity edition of Channel 4's hit reality television show Wife Swap. In 2008 McGee appeared on Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway. On 14 September 2010, McGee appeared on the celebrity version of Come Dine with Me. In 2012, McGee made a cameo appearance as herself in an episode of the UK TV comedy drama Stella. In 2017, McGee appeared alongside Nigel Havers, Simon Callow and Lorraine Chase in Barging Loving Celebs. She took part in Celebrity MasterChef in 2017. In August 2017, it was announced that McGee would be appearing as a contestant on the fifteenth series of Strictly Come Dancing where her professional dance partner was Giovanni Pernice. The couple reached the final but were beaten by Joe McFadden and Katya Jones. In November 2017 she appeared alongside Chesney Hawkes in Celebrity Antiques Road Trip. In December 2019, McGee appeared in the quiz show Tenable All Stars for a Christmas special. =Other activities= McGee continued to work alongside her husband in venues around the world. Also, according to the biography on her personal website, she has been writing a book for a long time. A cookery and party book written by McGee has appeared on WH Smith and Amazon websites called Dine with Debbie, although it is no longer in print. In 2005 she became the brand ambassador for 'Good Boy' chocolates. In 2006 McGee and friend Sue Simons created modelling and casting agency Debbie McGee Models. In February 2009, McGee and Daniels appeared in Closer magazine in a picture recreating an image from an Armani advert that featured footballer David Beckham and his wife Victoria. Later in the summer of that year, she appeared in a fringe theatre show in London called Frank's Closet.

Early life and education Kasarova was born in the central Bulgarian town of Stara Zagora, People's Republic of Bulgaria. Under the communist regime she studied Russian as a second language and had an early start in music education. She started taking piano lessons at the Pionerski Dom at age 4 (in 1970) and enrolled at Stara Zagora's Hristina Morfova School of Music and Performing Arts (normal studies in the morning, and music in the afternoon) in 1979. As she studied piano and worked as accompanist at recitals, Kasarova became so drawn to the voice as a musical instrument that upon earning her concert pianist diploma in 1987, she switched to study singing under Ressa Koleva at Sofia's Music Academy‚Äîfocusing on the works of Mozart and Rossini. Kasarova gave her first singing performance in Stara Zagora singing \\"Habanera\\" from Bizet's Carmen. She performed at Sofia National Opera while still a student. She performed the part of Rosina in The Barber of Seville for her graduation exam. Singing career In 1989, her final year at the Sofia Conservatory, she and 5 other students were sent to a month-long concert tour of France. The artist agent Luisa Lasser-Petrov made a recording of one of her performances which she sent to Herbert von Karajan, who immediately requested to see her in Salzburg and then in Vienna. They met in Salzburg where she was asked to sing \\"Agnus Dei\\" from Bach's Mass in B minor. Karajan wanted to engage her to sing Bach's mass with him at the Salzburg Festival the following year, but died shortly after. The Impresario of the Vienna State Opera, Ioan Holender (then jointly directing with Eberhard W√§chter) was persuaded by Lasser-Petrov to hear her auditions and immediately offered her a 2 yrs contract at that house to start in 1991-92 season. When she returned to Bulgaria, she took part in another audition at Stara Zagora Opera where she was heard by Christoph Groszer, the impresario of the Zurich Opera. He also immediately engaged her for his company. After graduation, Kasarova joined the ensemble at Zurich Opera in 1989 and made her professional stage debut in Wagner's G√∂tterd√§mmerung as the 2nd Norn and Wellgunde. She soon became a local favorite there with the audience appreciative of her unique vocal timbres, expressive intensity, and virtuoso ability. She also entered and won that year's Neue Stimmen competition. The competition was sponsored by Bertelsmann, which owns BMG Classics label, leading to her exclusive recording contract. In 1991, she made her debut at the Salzburg Festival singing 2 concerts in commemoration of Mozart's 200th death anniversary and as Annio in Mozart's La clemenza di Tito under Sir Colin Davis. In that same year she left Zurich to fulfill her contract at the Vienna State Opera debuting in the role of Rosina in Rossini's The Barber of Seville, and remained with the company for 2 years. There she married her Swiss husband. Her international career took flight in Salzburg in 1992 when at short notice, she stood in for Marilyn Horne as Tancredi in two concert performances of the Rossini opera. Since then she has been a regular guest at that summer festival, performing in Mozart's La clemenza di Tito, Idomeneo, Cos√¨ fan tutte, Mitridate, the Mozart pastiche Ombra felice, and Berlioz's La damnation de Faust. She has also performed at other notable opera festivals such as Bregenz, St. Moritz, Glyndebourne, Munich and Pesaro. Kasarova initially specialized in Mozart's operas and works by bel canto composers such as Rossini, Bellini, and Donizetti. By the mid 2000s she became much sought after in Baroque trouser roles such as Orph√©e in Gluck's Orph√©e et Eurydice, Ruggiero in H√§ndel's Alcina, and the title role in Ariodante. After her first assumption of Bizet's Carmen in 2008, however, her voice has gained more warmth and size as she adds more dramatic roles to her repertoire. When asked about her repertory change in interviews the singer consistently states her intention to keep singing bel canto roles for as long as possible in order to maintain vocal health as she moves toward the heavier roles of French, Verdi & Wagnerian operas. In 2003 Kasarova collaborated with the Bulgarian composer Krassimir Kyurkchiyski to produce the CD 'Bulgarian Soul'. She sings with the Cosmic Voices from Bulgaria and the Sofia Soloists Orchestra in this compilation of Bulgarian folk songs. \\"Many people don't know my native land. I would like them to discover the Bulgarian soul,\\" the singer commented. She won the \\"Singer of the Year\\" in 2003 Echo Klassik. In 2005 she won the Merkur Preis and was named Bavarian Kammers√§ngerin.

Borodino () is a rural locality (a village) in Mozhaysky District of Moscow Oblast, Russia, located west of Mozhaysk. The village is famous as the location of the Battle of Borodino on 7 September 181226 August in the Julian calendar then used in Russia. in the Napoleonic Wars during the French invasion of Russia. The Borodino Battlefield () is now part of the State Borodino War and History Museum and Reserve. The reserved area is ; the area of the protected zone is . History Archaeological evidence suggests that the area around Borodino was settled around 500 BC by Finnish, and then Slavic tribes. The well-preserved earthworks of a fort dating from about 200 BC, located near the village of Gorki, represent the earliest known military-historical construction in the Borodino area. However, the earliest written mention of the village of Borodino that has been found was in the 17th century. Borodino's lands were attached to the Moscow principality at the beginning of the 14th century and were at the boundary with Lithuanian territory along the old Smolensk road. The peasants farming the land cultivated winter rye, spring barley, oats, summer wheat, flax, hemp and buckwheat. The farms were assessed as \\"fair\\" to \\"average\\". Women, except for field work, were engaged in spinning flax and wool, weaving and knitting, for home use. During the Time of Troubles the area suffered from bandits and raiders, and even until the end of the 18th century much of the area was still abandoned. According to some reports the hamlet of Borodino was first mentioned in the Mozhayskie scribe books in 1601. During the Time of Troubles the village was described as having a \\"churchyard on the Tsar's sovereign land on the Voinka River (—Ä–µ–∫–∞ –í–æ–∏–Ω–∫–∞) with the Church of the Exaltation of the Cross of the Lord and the chapel of St. Nicholas\\", and further \\"in the church, images and candles and books and every church structure had secular parishioners\\". Prior to the construction of its own church at Borodino, people from the district were parishioners of the church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, which was on the other side of the Kolocha River at the confluence of the Stonets and Prudki creeks. This church with a chapel (the lower church) in honor of St. Nicholas, Archbishop of Myra was destroyed in the Time of Troubles, probably in 1609. After that, the locals were parishioners in the church of the Assumption in the village Semenov also having a lower chapel of St. Nicholas. The news of this church terminated in the middle of the 17th century. Since the beginning of the 17th century, the village was known as the first possession of the Russian Tsar Mikhail Fedorovich Romanov dynasty, which after 1613 was presented to them as the \\"Czar of Tsarevo salary\\" \\"yastrebniku\\" (position in the \\"tsar's hunting\\") Mozhayskoe policeman nobleman.

It is an independent institution, providing secondary education for boys aged 13-16 through a boys-only Year 1-4 section and pre-university education for students aged 17-18 through a coeducational Year 5-6 section. Since 2007, the school has offered the six-year Integrated Programme, which allows students to bypass the GCE O-Levels, and take the GCE A-Levels instead. Known as the Raffles Programme, it is offered jointly with its sister school, Raffles Girls' School (Secondary), or RGS. RI has had the highest number of admissions to the University of Cambridge, with 39 students receiving offers in 2015, and also boasts one of the highest Ivy League admissions rates. RI was among the first schools to receive the Ministry of Education's School Excellence Award. It is a member of various academic partnerships and alliances, such as the G30 Schools and The Winchester Network. It also co-founded the Global Alliance of Leading-Edge Schools.  History  An undated photo of the original Raffles Institution building at the junction of Bras Basah and Beach Road (the site diagonally opposite SAF Warrant Officers and Specialists Club building) =Foundation= Raffles Institution was founded by Sir Stamford Raffles, who proposed the establishment of the Institution or Singapore Institution at a meeting he convened on 1 April 1823. Raffles wanted to establish a college for the people of Singapore since the founding of the colony, and wrote on 12 January 1823 that a site for a planned college had been selected. His intention was to provide education for the children of local leaders in the new British colony of Singapore as well as the company's employees and others who wished to learn the local languages. Another objective was to \\"collect the scattered literature and traditions of the country\\" so that the most important may be published and circulated. Raffles referred to the plan as his \\"last public act\\"; by setting up the Institution, he hoped it that it could, through its generations of alumni, serve as \\"the means of civilising and bettering the conditions of millions\\" beyond Singapore. Those involved in the plan for the Institution included Reverend Robert Morrison, Sophia Raffles, William Farquhar, and William Marsden. It was initially suggested that the Institution should merge with the Anglo-Chinese College founded by Morrison in Malacca, but this plan did not materialise. Raffles contributed $2,000, secured a grant of $4,000 from the British East India Company and, together with subscriptions from other individuals, raised funds totalling $17,495 for the project. He drafted the curriculum, and set up the structure for the board of trustees that included William Wilberforce. The original building of Raffles Institution was sited on Bras Basah Road and it was designed by Lieutenant Phillip Jackson, the Garrison Engineer. Raffles laid the foundation stone of the building on 5 June 1823, a few days before he left Singapore for the last time on 9 June. No classes were held while the building was under construction, but the project stalled and the building was left unfinished for some time. Raffles' vision was also not shared by the Resident John Crawfurd, who felt the scale of the project excessive, and that the government should focus its efforts on elementary education instead. In 1835, a group of European merchants raised money for the Raffles Monument Fund to commemorate Raffles' contribution to Singapore, and proposed that it should be used to complete the Institution. George Drumgoole Coleman was then hired to finish and extend the original building by Jackson. Early years On 1 August 1834, Reverend F.J. Darrah opened the Singapore Free School with 46 boys, which quickly grew to nearly 80. When the building for the institute was completed in 1837, the school applied to occupy the building, a proposal the trustees of the Institution accepted. The Singapore Free School moved into the building in December 1837, and became the Institution Free School. It was however established as an elementary school rather than the college that Raffles had initially intended. Originally the school offered classes in Malay, Chinese and English, but the Malay classes soon closed in 1842 due to low enrolment, and it would eventually become an English-medium school. In May 1839, the first wing extension was completed, and the second at the end of 1841. In 1856, the Singapore Institution Free School was renamed Singapore Institution. In the 1860s, the school was gradually turned into a high school. In 1868 the school was renamed Raffles Institution. The most significant headmasters of the period were J.B. Bayley and R.W. Hullett, who oversaw the transition and ran the school for a cumulative period of 50 years. The school is Singapore's first institution to enrol girls, with 11 pupils accepted in 1844. In 1879, the girls wing of the school was established as Raffles Girls' School. =Relocation= The school moved in March 1972 to Grange Road. The old building was demolished and replaced by Raffles City Shopping Centre. The Bras Basah campus's library building is featured on the $2 paper and polymer note in Singapore currency.\\"The Singapore Mint:Note Facts\\", The Singapore Mint, 2013. Bust of Sir Stamford Raffles at the Year 1-4 atrium In 1984, it became one of two schools selected by the MOE to pilot the Gifted Education Programme to cater to intellectually gifted students. In 1990, the school moved again, this time from Grange Road to a new campus at Bishan, a recently created new town. =Raffles Junior College= In 1982 Raffles Junior College (RJC) was established at Paterson Road to take over the school's burgeoning pre-university enrolment. It subsequently moved to Mount Sinai Road. In 2004, the new Raffles Programme was offered to Secondary 1 to 3 students. It allows RI students to enter RJC and sit for the GCE A-Levels at 18, without having to sit for the GCE O-Levels, giving them more time to engage in enrichment and co-curricular or passion-driven activities. The curriculum serves to \\"seek to nurture the best and brightest into men and women of scholarship who will be leaders of distinction, committed to excellence and service in the interest of the community and nation.\\" This subsequently led to the merging of RI's GEP and Special/Express streams to form a single Raffles Programme stream, and the establishment of its in-house academic talent development programme, Raffles Academy, catering to exceptionally gifted students via subject-specific pullout classes from Year 3 onwards, in 2007. In 2005, RJC, along with Hwa Chong Junior College, became one of the first junior colleges in Singapore to attain independent status. RJC moved to its new Bishan campus adjacent to RI at the start of the 2005 school year, after attaining independent status and becoming the first Pre-University Institution in Singapore to be awarded the School Excellence Award. In 2009, RI and RJC re-integrated to form a single institution under the name Raffles Institution to facilitate the running of the Raffles Programme and better align processes and curriculum.  School identity and culture  RI is a member of various academic partnerships and alliances, such as the G30 Schools and The Winchester Network. It also co- founded the Global Alliance of Leading-Edge Schools. = Motto = The school motto - Auspicium Melioris Aevi - comes from the coat of arms of its founder, Sir Stamford Raffles. The official translation by the school is 'Hope of a Better Age'. = Houses = The five houses, three of them named after former headmasters, are Bayley, Buckley, Hullett, Moor and Morrison, represented by the colours yellow, green, black, red and blue respectively. : J.B. Bayley was a Headmaster who \\"raised Raffles Institution to a large and flourishing establishment\\", as recorded by the Board of Trustees.Bayley House page , Raffles Institution. : C.B. Buckley was the Secretary to the Board of Trustees of Raffles Institution. : R.W. Hullett was Raffles Institution's longest- serving Headmaster (31 years). : J.H. Moor was the first Headmaster of the school, and whose 4th great-grandson is Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada. : The Reverend Robert Morrison was the co-founder of Raffles Institution. Year 1 students are sorted into houses by class. In the early years of RI's history, there were ten houses, including a sixth Philips house (purple), later disbanded. House allocations used to be student-based, instead of class-based. Each House is led by a House Captain, a Year 4 student, who carries out his role along with the respective House Committee. The Houses participate in inter-house tournaments and activities, notably including the annual Inter-House Sports Carnival, Dramafeste and the Inter-House Debate tournament, with points earned from each activity contributing to the House Championship which is awarded at the end of the school year. Students of the college section were divided into five Houses, the name of which is an amalgamation of its counterparts in RI and RGS: : Bayley-Waddle : Buckle-Buckley : Hadley-Hullett : Moor-Tarbet : Morrison-Richardson = Uniform = The Raffles uniform from year 1-4 is all- white, including a white short-sleeved shirt with the Raffles badge at the top-right corner of the shirt pocket. Lower secondary students (Years 1 and 2) wear white short trousers and white socks. From Year 3 onwards, students may continue in short pants or opt for white long trousers. Shoes are white-based for all students, with the exception of laces, which must be fully white. Year 3 and 4 prefects must wear formal black shoes, except for Physical Education lessons, where they are required to change into appropriate shoes. School ties are worn only for formal occasions. Teachers have a formal gown for special occasions. The Raffles uniform for Year 5 and 6 male students are identical to the uniforms worn by Year 3s and 4s. The Raffles uniform for female students in Year 5 and 6 consist of a white blouse and a dark green, pleated skirt. = Discipline = In former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's book The Singapore Story,\\"The Singapore Story\\". Time Asia (Hong Kong). 21 September 1998. he mentions being caned for chronic lateness in the 1930s by the then headmaster, D.W. McLeod. In 1956, a former RI prefect wrote that, during his time there, \\"boys were caned on their bottoms for even winking at the girls. We did have very good discipline in our time and the boys became good citizens, lawyers, doctors, etc.\\"\\"A bit of discipline is good for boys\\". The Straits Times. Singapore. 8 October 1956.  Curriculum and student activities  Since 2007, the school has offered the six-year Integrated Programme, which allows students to bypass the GCE O-Levels, and take the GCE A-Levels instead. Known as the Raffles Programme, it is offered jointly with its sister school, Raffles Girls' School (Secondary), or RGS. = Orientation programmes =  Year 1 Orientation Camp  The new intake of Year 1 students go through a 3-day orientation camp, involving understanding the school's culture and knowing the campus grounds, and various activities to facilitate class bonding, leadership development, etc. Year 4 Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) and the Head and Deputy head prefects guide them through this camp and the rest of the orientation period. At the end of the camp, the Year 1s receive their school badges in the Junior Rafflesian Investiture Ceremony (JRIC), which occurs on the Friday of the Orientation Week. = Raffles Leadership Programme = The Raffles Leadership Programme (RLP) is an initiative of the Leadership Development Department, aimed at preparing Rafflesians to take on positions of leadership in school and in life. All Year 3 pupils go through the programme which includes going through the Leadership Challenge Workshop and taking the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Instrument. It also features a one-term residential component at RI Boarding. The boarding programme started as a trial in 2008 and has now become a full-cohort programme. Under the RLP, Year 3 pupils also get to take part in a ten-week residential programme in RI Boarding to learn about independent living skills. The RLP Boarding Programme was adjusted to a 7-week programme in 2019. = Students' Council (Year 5-6) = The Students' Council of the Year 5-6 section is divided into a total of eight departments, namely the Welfare Department, the Communications Department (Commz'D), the CCA Department (CCAD) and the five House Directorates. Each councillor also takes up one or two of the six functions, which are college events organised by the council: National Day, Teachers' Day, Grad Night, Open House, Orientation and Council Camp. Members of the Students' Council are selected through a college-wide election process. Each batch undergoes a rigorous selection process, which culminates in the Council Investiture. The Students' Council is headed by a President, who is assisted by his/her EXCO consisting of two Vice-Presidents, two Secretaries, the three Heads of Departments and the five House Captains. As of 2020, the school is served by the 40th batch of Student Councillors. = Co-curricular activities =  Year 1-4 (Secondary School section)  Raffles Institution offers about a forty CCAs under the co-curricular activity (CCA) programme, including sports, uniformed groups, performing arts, and clubs and societies. CCAs are categorised as either core or merit CCAs. Core CCAs comprise all sports, uniformed groups and performing arts, as well as Raffles Debaters while merit CCAs consist of all other clubs and societies. Every student of the school takes up at least one core CCA. Merit CCAs are optional, but students are encouraged to take up at least one merit CCA to supplement their core CCA. Certain merit CCAs, such as the Infocomm Club, however, may substitute for a core CCA instead. The school's sports teams and uniformed groups have earned top places in many national inter-school competitions, doing well in Red Cross Youth, Rugby, NCC, SAILING, Floorball, Boys' Brigade, and cross-country among others.\\"2005 Sports & Games Achievements\\" , Raffles Institution, 2005-2006.\\"2005 Achievements by Uniformed Groups\\" , Raffles Institution, 26 November 2005. The performing arts groups have also done well in the Singapore Youth Festival, held once every two years,\\"2005 Achievements by Music, Drama & Aesthetics Groups\\" , Raffles Institution, 2005-2006. while the clubs and societies have also won awards.\\"2005 Academic Competition Achievements\\" , Raffles Institution, 2005-2006. < Year 5-6 (Junior College Section)  The Year 5-6 section offers over seventy CCAs including sports, performing arts, and clubs and societies. Unlike in the first four years of the Raffles Programme, no distinction is made between core and merit CCAs. Students may offer up to two CCAs, no more than one of which may be a sports or performing arts group. Teams from RI performed well nationally in 2011, with the performing arts groups clinching 15 Golds (including 9 with Honours) and 5 Silvers at the biennial Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging and the sports teams winning 32 championship titles as well as 24 Silvers and 11 Bronzes at the National Interschools Sports Championships. The school's Clubs and Societies have also performed excellently in their various national competitions, with Raffles Debaters clinching championship titles and the History and Strategic Affairs Society clinching best school delegation awards at international Model United Nations conferences. = Publications = The college community is served by Raffles Press, the school's journalism society, which publishes its flagship online student newspaper Word of Mouth. The newspaper includes features, op-ed columns, sports reports and concert reviews. In addition, all staff and most students also receive a copy of the Rafflesian Times, the school's official magazine, from the Communications Department. The journalism society regularly publishes articles dealing with daily school life, recent assemblies and events as well as wider national issues including the SG50 sentiment and the 2015 Southeast Asian haze. In 2015, students from the school also started an unofficial satirical publication called \\"The Waffle Press\\" (a play on the official Raffles Press) that made fun of school events and examinations.  Boarding  The 13-storey twin towers next to the boarding complex Raffles Institution Boarding is housed in a Boarding Complex consisting of five blocks. These are named after the five Houses; Bayley, Buckley, Hullett, Moor and Morrison. Each block, apart from the new Hullett block, can accommodate 90 pupils. All blocks have their own staff, and the Boarding Complex is overseen by several Boarding Mentors. = History = The foundation stone of the Boarding Complex was laid by Lee Kuan Yew on 25 March 1994. The first batch of boarders moved into the Complex in 1996. During the upgrading works in 2006, the former Moor block was demolished to make way for a 13-storey twin tower hostel, the Hullett block, completed in July 2007, and the former Hullett block in turn renamed Moor. The three blocks of Buckley, Moor and Bayley houses boys enrolling in Raffles Leadership Programme, whereas Morrison block catered to girls previously.  Campus  Entrance to RI and RJC The Raffles Institution Year 1 - 4 campus consists of six main blocks on 18.65 hectares of land. =Yusof Ishak Block (Former Admin Block)= Raffles Institution Yusof Ishak Block The main building is the Yusof Ishak Block, comprising offices, staff rooms, lecture theatres, study areas and computer labs, as well the Main Atrium. It houses the Year 1-4 General Office and the Raffles Archives & Museum. Major upgrading works were completed in early 2007.\\"Hot News\\", Raffles Institution, 26 November 2005. = Science Hub = The Science Hub, opened in 2008, includes facilities for specialised research such as Xploratory-Labs;\\"MSD Singapore\\", Raffles Institution/ Merck Sharp and Dohme Exploratory Laboratories, 22 April 2000 as well as Chemistry, Physics and Biology labs. It also houses the Discovery Labs, a Laser Animation/Technology Studio, the Materials Science Lab and the Raffles Academy Home Room. It is connected to the Yusof Ishak Block. =Hullett Memorial Library / Shaw Foundation Dining Hall= The Hullett Memorial Library (HML) stands between the Sheares Block and ArtSpace. Co- founded by Dr Lim Boon Keng and Sir Song Ong Siang, it was named after Raffles Institution's longest-serving Headmaster, Richmond William Hullett, in 1923. The Library's official founding (even though a library and museum, from which the National Museum originated, had existed for decades prior to 1923) also marked the centenary of the founding of the institution.The History of The Hullett Memorial Library .

The school also has two tennis courts, two basketball courts, two squash courts, and two cricket nets. Following the re-integration with Raffles Junior College from 2009, more sports facilities are available. Floorball, table tennis, judo and gymnastics are RI sports now able to use the Year 5-6 Campus facilities.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed June 8, 2011 tributary of the Collins River in the U.S. state of Tennessee. Via the Collins River, the Caney Fork, and the Cumberland and Ohio rivers, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed. The Barren Fork rises in western Warren County, Tennessee. It is formed from the confluence of its north and south prongs, which join near the tiny community of Trousdale. Its component streams and their tributaries drain much of the eastern portions of Cannon County and Coffee County. The stream flows generally from west to east until it reaches the town of McMinnville, county seat of Warren County. From there it turns in a more northeasterly direction. From this point it is less than 5 linear miles (8 km) to the mouth of the Barren Fork into the Collins River, but considerably longer by the meandering course taken by the stream in its lower reaches. Near downtown McMinnville is a dam formerly utilized by the city as an electric power source; it was supplanted by the Tennessee Valley Authority system, as the small amount (by modern standards) of electricity it was capable of producing makes it impracticable to man and maintain by modern standards. The Barren Fork is named for the \\"Barrens\\" area of Middle Tennessee. This area comprises much of Coffee County, western Warren County, and southeastern Cannon County. The area was first named this by the early settlers, who were surprised to find a largely unforested area in the midst of what was generally a dense hardwood forest surrounding it. Several theories have been suggested as to its origin. The area is somewhat swampy, however; it is too moist for many types of hardwood trees that cannot survive long periods of \\"wet feet\\". It is suggested that it was cleared by Native Americans, in part using fire, so that the resulting open area would improve grazing conditions for elk, deer, and buffalo and thus improve hunting, and that they, like their white successors, also used the area for agriculture. Since only a limited number of native hardwood trees could grow in the area, it was relatively easy for the area to remain cleared once it had initially had much of its woody vegetation removed. The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA) maintains three boat access sites in McMinnville.

It is based on the novel Secret of the Ron Mor Skerry, by Rosalie K. Fry. It is centered on the Irish and Orcadian folklores of selkies‚Äîseals that can shed their skins to become human. The story, set on the west coast of Ireland, is about Fiona, a young girl who is sent to live with her grandparents and her cousin Eamon near the island of Roan Inish, where the selkies are rumored to reside. It is a family legend that her younger brother was swept away in his infancy and raised by a selkie. Part of the film takes place in Donegal. Plot Set in 1946, the story is told from the point of view of Fiona (Jeni Courtney), a young girl who is sent to live with her grandparents in an Irish fishing village, after the death of her mother, illness of her father, and her own failing health. In the evenings, her grandfather tells tales about the family's history, including the evacuation from their generational home on the tiny island of Roan Inish (in Irish, \\"seal island\\"), a real location near Narin, County Donegal, during the war. They live in the Ireland of tiny fishing villages, places where everyone knows one another. People live close to nature, and animals are respected and live alongside the villagers. Seals are especially respected for their special human-like spirit. It is said to be terribly wrong to harm a seal. As she meets other villagers, Fiona hears from a distant cousin about an ancestor who married a beautiful Selkie (seal-woman). The story goes that although theirs was a marriage full of happiness, success and many children, there was always the mysterious seal-bond to the ocean. Fiona's cousin tells her that the selkie's blood runs through some of the descendants, he himself is called a \\"dark\\", down through the generations, like himself, and Fiona's baby brother Jamie. Fiona hears details about how the sea seemed to steal her infant brother, Jamie, during the departure from Roan Inish, bobbing out of sight in his little cradle boat, some years earlier, never to be seen again. Her cousin, Eamon, who also lives near the grandparents for his health, often accompanies the Grandfather in his curragh - fishing boat - on daily errands to the islands including Roan Inish. Quickly the bright and older Eamon becomes a partner in Fiona's plans, as the day's adventures on the sea and shore become more interesting. Soon, on one of the visits to Roan Inish, Fiona believes that she has found Jamie romping on the strand and again, in the grass. She confides in Eamon, who warns her to not tell the grandparents for now. She observes that the seals seem to care for him, helping to feed him and play with him. They get the idea that her grandparents should move back to Roan Inish and, when they do, the seals will return Jamie to them. The grandparents' current landlord is selling their home and they will need to move soon, but won't move to Roan Inish due to the sadness they feel at losing Jamie. Without telling them, Fiona and Eamon reason: if they must move again, why not back to the cottages they loved best? Saying nothing to anyone about their plan, Fiona and Eamon set to the hard work of reclaiming the long- abandoned cottages on Roan Inish. They clean and restore the cottages, give them new thatch, paint, gardens, and furnishings. After returning to her grandparent's, a terrible storm rises and Fiona fears for Jamie's safety in the strong winds. She wonders aloud: \\"I hope he thinks to go inside the cottage.\\" Her grandparents hear her and are in utter disbelief at her explanation. Her grandmother is wise and unhesitant - rising to her feet and to the moment, her body and actions say: If there is any chance the child lives, when thought dead these years, rescue must be immediate. She gathers her husband, Eamon and Fiona, they pack what they need, and climb into the curragh and make their way to Roan Inish. Racing inside, they see that Jamie is not there and the wind is rising in power and the rain has begun. The grandparents are, however, astonished and grateful to Fiona and Eamon for their secret restoration of the cottages these past few weeks. Jamie's tiny cradle bobs to shore and he jumps out, heading for the cottages to escape the storm, shepherded to safety lovingly by the seals, as they'd probably been doing all along. But then he stops and runs back - he sees his Grandparents and Eamon and Fiona, his big sister, and has no memory of them. In front of the group, Grandmother calls to him to not be afraid and to come to them for love and safety - come to his family at last. Jamie remains motionless and afraid, still, then runs for his cradle, but at this point several of the seals herd him towards his family, and prevent him from returning to the cradle boat and the sea. He reluctantly makes his way into his grandmother's open arms and they make their way inside. Seeing that Jamie is safe, the seals depart. Indoors, the victorious family are elated at the return of the child they thought dead. They wrap Jamie in a blanket and sit in front of a warm dry fire. Fiona rocks him to sleep in her arms.

Without ostentation or self-consciousness, the film immerses you in the spume, fog and glare of the seaside life, with its temporal mysteries and its organic metamorphoses. Mason Daring's spare, traditional Irish score adds one more layer of melancholy atmosphere,\\" noted Scott Rosenberg of SFGate. Although in the original novel the story takes place in Scotland, the filmmakers decided to have the film take place in Ireland for practical reasons. According to John Sayles in the director's commentary, most of the film was shot in Donegal, Ireland, with some scenes being filmed at the Isle of Mull in Argyll, Scotland. Over 1,000 girls were tested for the role of Fiona, which required the actress to be \\"Thin, underweight, pale complexion, but perky and not afraid of water.\\" Reception =Critical response= It holds a 95% \\"Certified Fresh\\" and average rating of 7.8/10 on review site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 44 reviews. Scott Rosenberg of SFGate describes it as being \\"a lot like the island it's named after: It seems to occupy a time of its own, cut off from the speed and overload of contemporary life and drifting to its own ancient rhythms.\\" Critic Stephen Holden, film critic for The New York Times, liked the film's direction. He wrote, \\"The Secret of Roan Inish is the first film directed by Mr. Sayles that could be described as visually rhapsodic. Photographed by Haskell Wexler on Ireland's rugged northwestern seacoast, it is a cinematic tone poem in which man and nature, myth and reality flow together in a way that makes them ultimately indivisible.\\"Holden, Stephen.

It is located just to the west of Whitendale Hanging Stones in Lancashire at SD 64188 56541. Whalley, Lancashire at Grid Ref SD 72321.72 36671.1 (approximately), in December 2005 There has long been debate over the exact location of the geographical centre of the United Kingdom, and its constituent countries, due to the complexity and method of the calculation, such as whether to include offshore islands, and the fact that erosion will cause the position to change over time. There are two main methods of calculating this \\"centre\\": either as the centroid of the two-dimensional shape made by the country (projected to the Airy ellipsoid then flattened using the Transverse Mercator projection), or as the point farthest from the boundary of the country (either the sea, or, in the case of constituent countries, a land border). These two methods give quite different answers. Traditional locations The town of Haltwhistle in Northumberland has banners stating that it is the \\"Centre of Britain\\". By another calculation the centre can also be said to be Dunsop Bridge, Lancashire (historically in the West Riding of Yorkshire), 71 miles (114 km) to the south. However, in 2002 the Ordnance Survey conducted studies that pinpointed the respective centres more precisely, and it is their results that are quoted below. Centroid locations Put simply, the centroid is the point at which a cardboard cut-out of the area could be perfectly balanced on the tip of a pencil. Islands are assumed fixed to the mainland in their precise position by invisible rigid weightless wires. A mathematical method is used to do the balancing to a much greater accuracy than the practical method could achieve.

His followers and critics have argued that his thought exerts considerable influence on the evangelical Christian right.  Biography  Rushdoony was born in New York City, the son of recently arrived Armenian immigrants. Before his parents fled the Armenian Genocide of 1915, his ancestors had lived in a remote area near Mount Ararat. It is said that since the year 320, every generation of the Rushdoony family has produced a Christian priest or minister. Rushdoony himself claimed that his ancestors \\"would perpetually give a member of their family to be a priest to perform a kind of Aaronic priesthood as in the Old Testament, an hereditary priesthood. Whoever in the family felt called would become the priest. And our family did so. So from the early 300's until now there has always been someone in the ministry in the family.\\" Within weeks of arriving in America, his parents moved to the small farming community of Kingsburg, California, in Fresno County, where a number of other Armenian families had relocated. There his father, Yegheazar Khachig Rushdoony,1930 U.S. Census; WWII Registration Card founded a church, Armenian Martyrs Presbyterian. Rousas learned to read English by poring over the family's King James Bible: \\"By the time I reached my teens I had read the Bible through from cover to cover, over and over and over again\\". The family moved in 1925 for a short time to Detroit, where his father pastored another Armenian church. They returned to Kingsburg in 1931 and Rousas completed school in California.McVicar, pp. 22-23. His father was pastor of Bethel Armenian Presbyterian Church in San Francisco in 1942. Rousas had a younger sister, Rose (named for their mother), and brother, Haig. His father died in Fresno in 1961. = Education = Rushdoony attended public schools where he learned English, though Armenian was the language spoken at home. He continued his education at the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a B.A. in English in 1938, a teaching credential in 1939 and an M.A. in Education in 1940. Rushdoony and Arda Gent married in San Francisco the week before Christmas, 1943. Rushdoony attended the Pacific School of Religion, a Congregational and Methodist seminary in Berkeley, California, from which he graduated in 1944. Through letters over the years he kept up his friendship with his Pacific School of Religion mentor, theology professor George Huntston Williams, who saw in him the \\"heir of a great national Christian heritage\\" who would \\"enunciate anew the Gospel which seems to have been forgotten for a season.\\" In 1944 he was ordained by the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. He was later awarded an honorary Ph.D. from Valley Christian University for his book, The Philosophy of the Christian Curriculum. Gary North stated that Rushdoony read at least one book a day, six days a week, for fifty years of his life, underlining sentences and making an index of its main ideas in the rear. = Ministry = Rushdoony and his wife Arda served for eight and a half years as missionaries to the Shoshone and Paiute Indians on the remote Duck Valley Indian Reservation in northern Nevada. They lived in the reservation's primary town, Owyhee. It was during their mission to the Native Americans that Rushdoony began writing. Arda taught at the reservation school and at Sunday school, led a Girl Scout troop, coached the girls' basketball team, and visited with families. In 1945 they adopted Ronald, an orphaned baby from the reservation. Between 1947 and 1952 in Owyhee, four daughters were born to them. In late 1952 Rushdoony took an American Presbyterian Church pastorate at Trinity Presbyterian Church in Santa Cruz, California and the family left Duck Valley in January 1953. Their son Mark was born the next month in Santa Cruz. Rushdoony, c. 1958 In Santa Cruz, Rushdoony became a reader of the Christian libertarian magazine Faith and Freedom, which advocated an \\"anti-tax, non-interventionist, anti-statist economic model\\" in opposition to Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. Faith and Freedoms views on government aligned with Rushdoony's fears of centralized government power, given the Rushdoony family's memories of the Armenian Genocide. Rushdoony contributed articles to Faith and Freedom, including one describing his observations of the Duck Valley Indian Reservation, arguing that government support had reduced residents to \\"social and personal irresponsibility\\". The Rushdoonys separated in 1957 and later divorced. About this time, Rushdoony transferred his church membership from the American Presbyterian Church) to the Orthodox Presbyterian denomination. The Orthodox Presbyterian Church's newsletter, The Presbyterian Guardian, reported in July 1958 that \\"the Rev. Rousas J. Rushdoony‚Ä¶ was received and a new Orthodox Presbyterian Church organized, consisting of [sixty-six charter members] who had separated from the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. in Santa Cruz.\\" In their petition the group asked that Rushdoony be ordained as their pastor and stated, \\"[W]e cannot abide in any church which seeks to define righteousness or sin, salvation or sanctification, except in terms of the Word of God. We have witnessed, here in Santa Cruz, against modernism, man-made perfectionism, and church bureaucracy\\". The newsletter article goes on to report, \\"The Presbytery in receiving the church also examined Mr. Thomas Kirkwood and Mr. Kenneth Webb as prospective elders, and they with Mr. Rushdoony were constituted the session of the church,\\" and announced the publication of Rushdoony's By What Standard? later that year. = Later life = The May 1962 edition of The Presbyterian Guardian reported Rushdoony's resignation, noted as \\"reportedly to devote his time for his writing and lecturing.\\" Rushdoony also married his second wife, Dorothy Barbara Ross Kirkwood, in 1962. She died in 2003. Rushdoony moved to Los Angeles in 1965 and founded the Chalcedon Foundation; the monthly Chalcedon Report, which Rushdoony edited, began appearing that October. His daughter Sharon later married Gary North, a Christian Reconstructionist writer and economic historian. North and Rushdoony became collaborators and their partnership lasted until 1981 when it was ended due to a dispute over the content of one of North's articles. Following the dispute, North and Chalcedon continued to independently promote each other's views, but they did not reach a \\"truce\\" until 1995. Under Rushdoony, the Chalcedon Foundation grew to twelve staff members with 25,000‚Äì40,000 people on their mailing lists during the 1980s. Chalcedon and Reconstructionism obtained the support of major Christian book publishers and endorsements from influential evangelical leaders including Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell and Frank Schaeffer (who later repudiated the movement). RJ Rushdoony died in 2001 with his children at his side. Rushdoony's son, the Rev. Mark R Rushdoony, became and remains the president of the Chalcedon Foundation and editor of the Chalcedon Report.  Philosophical and theological contributions  Michael J. McVicar summarized Rushdoony's theology and philosophy as follows: Rushdoony developed his philosophy as an extension of the work of Calvinist philosopher Cornelius Van Til. Van Til critiqued human knowledge in light of the Calvinist doctrine of total depravity. He argued that sin affected a person's ability to reason. In order to be rational, Van Til claimed, one must presuppose the existence of God and the inerrant, divine inspiration of the (Protestant) Bible. Rushdoony attended to the implications ‚Äì where Van Til held true knowledge came from God, Rushdoony asserted that \\"all non-Christian knowledge is sinful, invalid nonsense. The only valid knowledge that non-Christians possess is 'stolen' from 'Christian-theistic' sources.\\" In effect, Rushdoony extended Van Til's thinking from philosophy to \\"all of life and thought.\\" = Early writings = Rushdoony began to promote the works of Calvinist philosophers Cornelius Van Til and Herman Dooyeweerd into a short survey of contemporary humanism called By What Standard?. Arguing for a Calvinist system of thought, Rushdoony dealt with subjects as broad as epistemology and cognitive metaphysics and as narrow as the psychology of religion and predestination. He wrote a book, The One And The Many: Studies in the Philosophy of Order and Ultimacy, using Van Tillian presuppositional philosophy to critique various aspects of secular humanism. He also wrote many essays and book reviews, published in such venues as the Westminster Theological Journal. = Homeschooling = Rushdoony's next focus was on education, especially on behalf of homeschooling, which he saw as a way to combat the intentionally secular nature of the U.S. public school system. By the early 1960s, he was active in the homeschooling movement, appearing as an expert witness in order to defend the rights of homeschoolers. He vigorously attacked progressive school reformers such as Horace Mann and John Dewey and argued for the dismantling of the state's influence on education in three works: Intellectual Schizophrenia (a general and concise study of education), The Messianic Character of American Education (a history and castigation of public education in the U.S.), and The Philosophy of the Christian Curriculum (a parent-oriented pedagogical statement). = History = Rushdoony then pursued history ‚Äì of the world, of the United States, and of the church. He maintained that Calvinistic Christianity provided the intellectual roots for the American Revolution and thus had always had an influential impact in American history. The American Revolution, according to Rushdoony, was a \\"conservative counterrevolution\\" to preserve American liberties from British usurpation and it owed nothing to the Enlightenment. He further argued that the United States Constitution was a secular document in appearance only and did not need to establish Christianity as an official religion since the states were already Christian establishments. Drawing on the work of theologian Robert Lewis Dabney, Rushdoony argued that the American Civil War \\"destroyed the early American Republic, which he envisioned as a decentralized Protestant feudal system and an orthodox Christian nation.\\" Rushdoony saw the North's victory as a \\"defeat for Christian orthodoxy.\\" Some historians have argued that this aspect of Rushdoony's thought influenced some activists in the Neo-Confederate movement and Southern conservatives such as J. Steven Wilkins. He would further this study in his works on American ideology and historiography, This Independent Republic: Studies in the Nature and Meaning of American History and The Nature of the American System. On the matter of Israel's place in history, he believed that the prophet Daniel \\"makes clear that God by-passed His chosen people in favor of four great monarchies...and then called forth a Fifth Monarchy which is by no means identified with Israel\\".Fruchtenbaum, Arnold G. (2001). Israelology: the missing link in systematic theology. Tustin, Calif.:Ariel Ministries. p. 29. .Rushdoony, Rousas John. (1970 reprint ed). Thy Kingdom Come. Fairfax, Va:Thoburn Press, p. 19. = Christian Reconstruction = Rushdoony's most important area of writing, however, was law and politics, as expressed in his small book of popular essays Law & Liberty and discussed in much greater detail in his three-volume, 1,894-page magnum opus, The Institutes of Biblical Law. With a title modeled after Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion, Rushdoony's Institutes was arguably his most influential work. In the book, he proposed that Old Testament law should be applied to modern society and that there should be a Christian theonomy, a concept developed in his colleague Greg Bahnsen's controversial book Theonomy in Christian Ethics, which Rushdoony heartily endorsed. In the Institutes, Rushdoony supported the reinstatement of the Mosaic law's penal sanctions. Under such a system, the list of civil crimes which carried a death sentence would include homosexuality, adultery, incest, lying about one's virginity, bestiality, witchcraft, idolatry or apostasy, public blasphemy, false prophesying, kidnapping, rape, and bearing false witness in a capital case. Although he supported the separation of church and state at the national level, Rushdoony also believed that both institutions were under the rule of God, and thus he conceived secularism as posing endless false dichotomies, which his massive work addresses in considerable detail. In short, he sought to cast a vision for the reconstruction of society based on Christian principles. The book was critical of democracy. He wrote that \\"the heresy of democracy has since then worked havoc in church and state ... Christianity and democracy are inevitably enemies\\" because democracy asserts the will of man over the will of God. Rushdoony believed that a republic is a better form of civil government than a democracy. According to Rushdoony, a republic avoided mob rule and the rule of the \\"51%\\" of society; in other words \\"might does not make right\\" in a republic. Rushdoony wrote that America's separation of powers between 3 branches of government is a far more neutral and better method of civil government than a direct democracy, stating \\"[t]he [American] Constitution was designed to perpetuate a Christian order\\". Rushdoony argues that the Constitution's purpose was to protect religion from the federal government and to preserve \\"states' rights.\\" Rushdoony's work has been used by Dominion Theology advocates who attempt to implement a Christian government subject to Biblical law in the United States. Authority, behavioral boundaries, economics, penology and the like would all be governed by biblical principles in Rushdoony's vision, but he also proposed a wide system of freedom, especially in the economic sphere, and claimed Ludwig von Mises as an intellectual mentor; he called himself a Christian libertarian. Rushdoony was the founder in 1965 of the Chalcedon Foundation and the editor of its monthly magazine, the Chalcedon Report. He also published the Journal of Christian Reconstruction and was an early board member of the Rutherford Institute, founded in 1982 by John W. Whitehead. In 1972, Cornelius Van Til \\"disclaimed affiliation\\" with Rushdoony and the Christian Reconstructionist movement, writing \\"...I am frankly a little concerned about the political views of Mr. Rushdoony and Mr. North and particularly if I am correctly informed about some of the views Gary North has with respect to the application of Old Testament principles to our day. My only point is that I would hope and expect they would not claim such views are inherent in the principles I hold\\". citing letter to Gregg Singer, 11 May 1972.  Criticism  Rushdoony was, and remains, a controversial figure, as is the Christian Reconstructionist movement in which he was involved. Pointing to Rushdoony's support for the death penalty, the British Centre for Science Education decried his perceived dislike of democracy and tolerance. Furthermore, Rushdoony has been accused of Holocaust denial and racism.* Sugg, John. \\"A Nation Under God\\" , Mother Jones, December 2005. \\"Rushdoony denied the Holocaust and defended segregation and slavery\\". * Braun, Aurel; Scheinberg, Stephen J. The Extreme Right: Freedom and Security at Risk, Westview Press, 1997, p. 71. \\"Rushdoony, a one-time John Birch society activist, has in his books 'maligned Jews, Judaism and Blacks, and [has] engaged in Holocaust \\"revisionism\\"'\\". * Lane, Frederick S.

Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative, Random House of Canada, 2003, p. 201. \\"Rushdoony was also a Holocaust denier.\\" * Blumenthal, Sidney. The Clinton Wars, Plume, 2004, p. 319. \\"One of the members of the small founding board, RJ Rushdoony, was a Holocaust denier who favored the death penalty for homosexuals and doctors performing abortions.\\" According to Frank Schaeffer, Rushdoony believed that interracial marriage, which he referred to as \\"unequal yoking\\", should be made illegal. He also opposed \\"enforced integration\\", referred to Southern slavery as \\"benevolent\\", and said that \\"some people are by nature slaves\\". Kerwin Lee Klein, however, argues that Rushdoony was not a \\"biological racialist\\" and that for him \\"racism founded on modern biology simply represented another pagan revival.\\" In The Institutes of Biblical Law, he uses the 1967 work Judaism and the Vatican by L√©on de Poncins as a source for Paul Rassinier's figure of 1.2 million Jewish deaths during the Holocaust, and the claim that Raul Hilberg calculated the number at 896,292, and further asserts that very many of these died of epidemics. He called the charge of 6 million Jewish deaths \\"false witness\\" against Germany. , citing \\"The false witness born during World War II with respect to Germany is especially notable and revealing. The charge is repeatedly made that six million innocent Jews were slain by the Nazis, and the figure‚Äîand even larger figures‚Äîis now entrenched in the history books. Poncins, in summarizing the studies of the French Socialist, Paul Rassinier, himself a prisoner in Buchenwald, states: Rassinier reached the conclusion that the number of Jews who died after deportation is approximately 1,200,000 and this figure, he tells us, has finally been accepted as valid by the Centre Mondial de Documentation Juive Contemporaine. Likewise he notes that Paul Hilberg, in his study of the same problem, reached a total of 896,292 victims. Very many of these people died of epidemics; many were executed...\\" In 2000, Rushdoony stated concerning this passage in his Institutes: \\"It was not my purpose to enter a debate over numbers, whether millions were killed, or tens of millions, an area which must be left to others with expertise in such matters. My point then and now is that in all such matters what the Ninth Commandment requires is the truth, not exaggeration, irrespective of the cause one seeks to serve.\\" Carl R. Trueman, Professor of Historical Theology and Church History at Westminster Theological Seminary wrote in 2009 regarding the passage and Rushdoony's Holocaust denial: Murray Rothbard, a prominent figure in the American libertarian movement, disputed Rushdoony's claim of being a libertarian in a scathing book review of Rushdoony's Intellectual Schizophrenia.

The season shares its title with the Korean dub of Dekaranger in South Korea, whose logo is similar to the American series. The initials in the title stand for \\"Space Patrol Delta\\"; in Dekaranger, it stood for Special Police Dekaranger, and in the South Korean dub of Dekaranger, it stood for Special Police Delta. The season debuted on February 5, 2005 as part of Jetix, originally airing on ABC Family; beginning with \\"Messenger, Part 2\\", the series moved to Toon Disney. A Japanese dub of S.P.D. started airing on Toei's digital television channel in Japan starting in August 2011, with two DVD volumes released on August 5. It features the original Dekaranger cast members dubbing over the voices of their American counterparts (with the exception of Mako Ishino, who is the series' narrator rather than voicing her character's counterpart). Synopsis 12 out of the 14 S.P.D. Rangers The story takes place in the year 2025, 21 years after the events of the previous season, when Earth has welcomed alien beings to live peacefully with the human race. However, peace is short lived as the planet-conquering Troobian Empire turns its destructive attention to Earth. When the Earth's first line of defense, the S.P.D. A-Squad, mysteriously vanishes without a trace, the protection of the planet falls to their replacements: the B-Squad Rangers, under the guidance of their dog-like alien commander, Anubis \\"Doggie\\" Cruger. When two reformed thieves join the team as the Red and Yellow S.P.D. Rangers, tensions threaten to tear them apart. With the alien threat growing stronger every moment, the Rangers must put aside their differences and go into action as one. Using teamwork, intergalactic weaponry and light-speed Zord vehicles to battle evil, they unite to become one of the ultimate forces for good: Power Rangers Space Patrol Delta.

Jetix Magazine is the official magazine of Jetix, the channel that showed S.P.D. in the UK in 2006. The strip was the first Power Rangers strip to be written by Transformers writer Simon Furman, collaborating for the first time on the PR strip with equally popular TF artist Andrew Wildman, who had previously done artwork for other Power Rangers strips under Jetix Magazines' previous banner of Fox Kids' Wicked. The strip ended with its own conclusion to the SPD series, the first time any comic strip version of Power Rangers has dared to pull off a different take on a PR finale. In the strip, A-Squad are brainwashed instead of corrupted and turn against their superiors. The B-Squad regulars deal with them and help Cruger defeat and overcome both Grumm and Omni, before being promoted to A-Squad status. During the course of the strip, a running sub-plot involving a rogue Krybot who had become self-aware and rebelled against Grumm gradually unfolded, he would resurface to warn SPD of Grumm's invasion attempt in the final story and supply Jack with a device that once inserted on the Terror, would incapacitate the Krybot fleet. Unlike \\"Endings\\", Jack does not leave the team, in another change, the Rangers do not decline the position of A-Squad (in the season, the rank of A-Squad was discarded in light of the previous team tarnishing it with their treacherous ways).

It was the sixth United States vessel named Revenge. Revenge was laid down as Right on 19 June 1942 by Winslow Marine Railway and Shipbuilding Company, Seattle, Washington; launched on 7 November 1942; renamed Revenge 15 May 1943; and commissioned on 21 July 1943, with Commander F. F. Sima in command. Service history =Marshall and Gilbert Islands campaign= After outfitting at Puget Sound Navy Yard, Revenge underwent shakedown out of San Pedro and San Diego, California. She departed on 13 October 1943 for further training in the Hawaiian Islands, and on 10 November she set course for Makin Island, the Gilberts, arriving two days later. After two days of minesweeping, she commenced anti-submarine patrol off Makin and Tarawa. Following Christmas and training at Pearl Harbor, Revenge sailed for Kwajalein Atoll and commenced minesweeping operations on 13 January 1944. For a brief period following the invasion, she alternated between antisubmarine patrol and harbor entrance control. From the end of February through mid-May, she was utilized as an escort vessel, travelling between the Marshalls, the Gilberts and the Hawaiian Islands. She then returned to the west coast. =Philippines campaign= Upon completion of a short availability at Mare Island Navy Yard, Revenge again commenced escort duty out of Pearl Harbor. September brought the resumption of training exercises, this time at Hilo, after which she sailed for Manus, the Admiralties. On 11 October she headed for the Philippines and the invasion of Leyte. The weather was exceedingly rough and, the night before the initial sweep, 20 foot seas were running. In spite of the weather, Mine Division 13 (of which Revenge was a unit) entered Leyte Gulf at daybreak with gear streamed. No navigational plots could be kept, nor could the ships remain on stations as the weather had reached typhoon intensity. No enemy action was observed, but activities were made hazardous by the abundance of floating mines and the difficulties involved in maneuvering the craft. Weather abated somewhat the next day and sweeping operations were earned out in a more normal fashion. After six days Revenge was credited with the destruction of nearly 70 mines. Once the beachhead was secured and the anchorage made safe, the division continued clearance sweeps around Homonhon and Samar. On 27 November, and Revenge made an exploratory sweep on the western side of Leyte. Revenge was scheduled to participate in the invasion of Luzon early in January 1945, but, because of a damaged propeller shaft, she was ordered to Pearl Harbor for repairs. In February she was again assigned convoy duty, this time out of Ulithi, Western Carolines. Then, on 19 March she got underway with some 70 other minecraft for the invasion of Okinawa. =Okinawa invasion= No early difficulties were encountered off Okinawa by Revenge. She operated just off the invasion beaches, where strong tides caused some anxiety and these very tides caused to drift into unswept waters 28 March, where she struck a mine and sank. In the attendant rescue operations, Revenge cleared a path to one side of Skylark while cleared a path to the other. Rescue work was so efficient that only five men died in the stricken minesweeper, and they were killed in the initial explosion. For 76 days Revenge remained on patrol off Okinawa. In March her gunners detected and sank a Japanese suicide boat as it attempted to run in under cover of darkness. Late in June relief was assigned and Revenge called at Guam for two weeks of availability. =Post-war operations= In July Revenge returned to Okinawa, but soon departed with a small minesweeping group for the East China Sea. Then, on 27 August, Revenge went alongside to take aboard a Japanese pilot for the sweep of Tokyo Bay. The next morning Revenge led the group into Tokyo Bay. There was a fairly wide channel, and safe anchorages were quickly charted for the rest of the fleet. The minesweepers then shifted operations to the coastline. After a month of such operations and some additional time in Tokyo Bay, the minesweepers were ordered to Sasebo. Operations out of Sasebo took Revenge and her sisters into the East China Sea and the Straits of Formosa. She spent Christmas of 1945 in Shanghai, and in January 1946 returned Sasebo. In mid-January she sailed for San Pedro, California, and from there through the Panama Canal for Charleston, South Carolina, for inactivation overhaul. Following inactivation on 18 March 1947 she was assigned to the Texas Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet, Orange, Texas. =Second commission, 1951-1955= Recommissioned on 14 February 1951 Revenge provided training services along the east coast as well as in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Reclassified MSF-110 on 7 March 1955, she decommissioned two days later and was assigned to the Florida Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet, at Green Cove Springs, Florida. Decommissioning and sale In 1961 Revenge was transferred to the Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility, Orange, Texas, where she remained until struck from the Navy list on 1 November 1966. She was sold for scrap in May 1967. Revenge earned six battle stars during World War II.

He was born in Bonn and studied in Berlin and Munich under Leopold von Ranke and Heinrich von Sybel, being especially influenced by the latter historian. After conducting research work at Simancas in Spain,Alfredo Alvar Ezqurerra: Intercambios culturales intangibiles: Maurenbrecher en Simancas (1862‚Äì1863), la Dieta de Augusta y el epistolario de Cantonay (1566), in Lutero su obra y su epocha, F.

Afterwards, he attained professorships in history at K√∂nigsberg (1869), Bonn (1877) and Leipzig (1884), where he was successor to his late friend Carl von Noorden. As a Protestant historian, Maurenbrecher felt an obligation to treat Catholic history objectively. He shared Ranke's views in regards to the common origin of the Protestant and Catholic Reformations. He chose the term \\"Catholic Reformation\\" as an indication of it being a positive tendency of reform rather than a defensive reaction to the Protestant Reformation. Maurenbrecher depicted the Dutch scholar Erasmus as a pioneer and proponent of Catholic reform.Google Books Man on His Own: Interpretations of Erasmus, C1750-1920, Volume 2 by Bruce Mansfield  Literary works  Many of Maurenbrecher's works are concerned with the Reformation, among them being: * England im Reformationszeitalter (D√ºsseldorf, 1866) - England and the Age of Reformation. * Karl V. und die deutschen Protestanten (D√ºsseldorf, 1865) - Charles V and the German Protestants. * Studien und Skizzen zur Geschichte der Reformationszeit (Leipzig, 1874) - Studies and sketches on the history of the Reformation. * Geschichte der Katholischen Reformation (N√∂rdlingen, 1880, incomplete) - History of the Catholic Reformation. Other writings by Maurenbrecher include: * Gr√ºndung des deutschen Reiches 1859-1871 (Leipzig, 1892; 1902) - Founding of the German Empire 1859‚Äì1871. * Geschichte der deutschen K√∂nigswahlen (Leipzig, 1889) - History of the German royal elections.

The band got their breakthrough with the release of the album Hurricane Bar. Their main fan base is in Sweden, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Japan. Band members are Bj√∂rn Dixg√•rd (vocals, guitar), Carl- Johan Fogelklou (bass), Jens Siverstedt (guitar), Daniel Haglund (keyboard) and Patrik Heinkipieti (drums). History =Early years (1999‚Äì2002)= The roots of Mando Diao date back to 1999 when Bj√∂rn Dixg√•rd (vocals, guitar) and Daniel Haglund (keyboard) played in a band called Butler, which they had founded in the middle of the 1990s. In 1996, Gustaf Nor√©n (vocals, guitar), joined the band. In 1999, Carl-Johan Fogelklou (bass, backing vocals) and Samuel Giers (drums) became members and completed the original band. The current line-up decided to take the project more seriously. Bj√∂rn Dixg√•rd and Gustaf Nor√©n locked themselves up in a summer house and spent 14 months writing songs. They claim the Beatles as their original source of inspiration. Allegedly, Gustaf joined the band after he and Bj√∂rn had talked all night about this band. The two renamed their band Mando Diao, a name that appeared to Bj√∂rn Dixg√•rd in a dream in which a man came up to him and shouted \\"Mando Diao!\\". Mando Diao made their first public performances in the clubs of their hometown Borl√§nge in 1999. A local writer described them in an article as the best unsigned band he had ever seen. This was soon followed by a record deal with EMI Sweden. =First breakthrough (2002‚Äì05)= The release of their debut album Bring 'Em In in 2002, and of their first single \\"Sheepdog\\" made the band popular in Sweden; the 1960s and 1970s music style and sound as well as the singers¬¥ voices were soon seen as the \\"typical\\" Mando Diao sound by their fans. Gustaf Nor√©n once compared Bring 'Em In to music by The Kooks, the Small Faces and The Kinks, declaring his band's music best and even better than many albums by The Beatles or The Rolling Stones. The band began touring Sweden and other Scandinavian countries together with local bands as The Hellacopters or Kent. Daniel Haglund left the band in 2003, due to some minor disputes, and was replaced by Mats Bj√∂rke. =International success (2005‚Äì11)= With every album release, the band's international success increased; in 2007 Mando Diao appeared for the first time as headliner on a music festival, the Live Earth concert in Hamburg. After the recording of Above And Beyond - MTV unplugged, Samuel Giers left the band at the beginning of 2011. Since September 2011, Mando Diao is supported by Patrik Heikinpieti (drums) and Daniel Haglund (guitar, keyboard). =Swedish album Infruset (2012)= In 2011, Gustaf Nor√©n and Bj√∂rn Dixg√•rd began working on poems written by the Swedish poet Gustaf Fr√∂ding, and setting them to music. The result, their first album in Swedish, Infruset, was highly rated and appreciated all over Europe even before the official release . On 28 October 2012, the world premiere was broadcast as a live cinema event - Mando Diao live p√• bio in theaters and cinemas in Sweden, Germany and Switzerland. Infruset has turned out to be the band's most successful album in Sweden: it has won a Swedish Grammis award, sold four times platinum in Sweden. Due to their success, the band was awarded with the Swedish Rockbj√∂rnen, a fan award, as best livegroup in 2013. The album has been charting on the Swedish Albums Chart for 101 weeks from November 2012 until June 2015 and is Sweden's 9th all-time best-charting album. The single \\"Str√∂vt√•g i hembygden\\" remained in the Swedish radio top ten charts for 127 weeks in May 2015. =New influences and reorientation (since 2012)= On 23 April 2014 Mando Diao's seventh studio album √Ülita was released in Sweden; the international release was on 2 May 2014. The first single, \\"Black Saturday\\", was released in Sweden on 11 January 2014. The new synth rock sound has led to many disputes amongst fans of the band and critics. The Russian synthesizer \\"Aelita\\" has been the source and inspiration for this album, leading away from the former music style. On 18 November 2014, keyboard player Mats Bj√∂rke officially left the band. His main focus is on working as producer in his own studio. =Projects (2015)= On 16 October 2014, \\"Love Last Forever\\", the official song for the ski world championship 2015 in Falun, featuring Maxida M√§rak, a young Swedish artist and S√°mi, who by her singing and wearing S√°mi clothes while performing this song is raising awareness for the minority problems in Sweden, has been presented to the public.

Five people were taken to the hospital with injuries such as broken arms and legs. According to the management of Norrlandsoperan, the hall had been checked, but they had never thought the floor, consisting of several moveable parts on concrete girders over a hole, wouldn't hold the 170 people in the room, since the fire department had given them approval for 800 people.

Entering service in 1871 for Atlantic crossings, she was later chartered to Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company (O&O;) in 1875. The ship provided passenger service for O&O; in the Pacific until 1895 when she was sold for scrap. Design and construction Builder's model, at the Merseyside Maritime Museum, showing the ship as altered in 1872. Oceanic was built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast, and was launched on 27 August 1870, arriving in Liverpool for her maiden voyage on 26 February 1871. Powered by a combination of steam and sail, she had twelve boilers generating steam at 65 pounds-force per square inch (450 kPa) powering a single four cylinder compound steam engine, 2 x and 2 x , with a stroke of . A single funnel exhausted smoke and four masts carried sail. The hull was constructed of iron and divided into eleven watertight compartments. A crew of 143 operated the vessel. The Oceanic had a capacity of approximately 1,000 third-class and 166 first-class passengers, known at the time as 'steerage' and 'saloon' class. The White Star Line was among only a handful of trans- Atlantic passenger lines to segregate their third-class accommodations; single men were berthed in the bow while berthing for single women and families was in the stern. First-class cabins were positioned amidship, away from ocean movements and the vibration of the engines. The contemporary press described her \\"more an imperial yacht than a passenger liner.\\" Innovative features included running water and electric bells to summon stewards in the first- class cabins. Portholes in the ship were much larger than on contemporary liners, providing more light. The saloon dining room was large enough to seat all first-class passengers at once. Maritime historian Daniel Allen Butler writes \\"With her unparalleled accommodations and stunning appearance ... the Oceanic established the White Star Line as the arbiter of comfort on the North Atlantic\\".The RMS Titanic: Conception, Catastrophe, and Legacy By Captain Meghan Cleary, p. 1 Service history A painting of RMS Oceanic (left) standing by the sinking SS City of Chester after their collision on 22 August 1888.A newspaper illustration of RMS Oceanic (left) colliding with SS City of Chester. Oceanic left for her maiden voyage from Liverpool on 2 March 1871 carrying only 64 passengers, under Captain Sir Digby Murray. Not long after departing, she had to return because of overheated bearings. Her voyage restarted on 16 March. From that point onward, Oceanic was a success for the White Star Line. She was to be the first of a series of six sister ships constructed in rapid succession: Atlantic, Baltic, Republic, Adriatic, and Celtic. All were of the same approximate dimensions with differences in tonnage, with the exception of the Adriatic and the Celtic, the designs for which were later modified to slightly increase their sizes. In January 1872, Oceanic underwent a refit, during which a large forecastle was added to help prevent the bow being inundated during high seas. Two new boilers were added to increase steam pressure and thus engine power, and the four masts were shortened. Oceanic continued sailing with the White Star line on the Liverpool to New York City route until 11 March 1875, when she was chartered to the Occidental & Oriental Steamship Company for service between San Francisco, Yokohama and Hong Kong. The White Star Line provided the officers, while the crew was Chinese. The ship itself remained in White Star Line colours, but flew the O&O; flag. During the repositioning voyage from Liverpool to Hong Kong, Oceanic set a speed record for that route. Later, she also set a speed record for Yokohama to San Francisco in December 1876, and then broke her own record over that route in November 1889, with a time of 13 days, 14 hours and 5 minutes. On 22 August 1888, Oceanic collided with the coastal liner just outside the Golden Gate; the latter ship sank, killing 16 on board.The New York Times, 23 August 1888 On 7 January 1890, Nellie Bly boarded Oceanic in Yokohama to cross the Pacific as part of her voyage Around the World in Seventy-Two Days. She arrived in San Francisco on 21 January 1890, which was a day behind schedule as a result of rough weather. In 1895, Oceanic was returned to the White Star Line, which planned on putting her back into service. She was sent back to Harland and Wolff for re-engining, but when the ship was inspected closely, it was found to be uneconomical to perform all the work needed. Instead, she was sold for scrap, leaving Belfast for the last time on 10 February 1896, under tow, for a scrapyard on the River Thames.

He was noted for repopularising a simple, close-cut geometric hair style called the bob cut, worn by famous fashion designers including Mary Quant and film stars such as Mia Farrow, Goldie Hawn, Cameron Diaz, Nastassja Kinski and Helen Mirren.Helen Mirren with a chin length bob, Hairfinder His early life was one of extreme poverty, with seven years of his childhood spent in an orphanage. He quit school at age 14, soon holding various jobs in London during World War II. Although he hoped to become a professional football player, he became an apprentice hairdresser at the suggestion of his mother. After developing a reputation for his innovative cuts, he moved to Los Angeles in the early 1970s, where he opened the first chain of worldwide hairstyling salons, complemented by a line of hair- treatment products.Martin, Richard. Encyclopedia of Popular Culture, St. James Press (2000) p. 313 He sold his business interests in the early 1980s to devote himself to philanthropy. Vidal Sassoon: The Movie, a documentary film about his life, was released in 2010. In 2009, Sassoon was appointed CBE by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. In 2012 he was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork ‚Äì the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover ‚Äì to celebrate the British cultural figures of the last six decades. Early life Sassoon was born to Jewish parents in Hammersmith, west London, and lived nearby in Shepherd's Bush. His mother, Betty (Bellin) (1900‚Äì1997), an Ashkenazi Jew, was born in Aldgate, in the East End of London, in 1900. Although she was surrounded by grinding poverty, Sassoon writes that she nonetheless resolved to make the best of her life. Her family had emigrated to England from Ukraine in the 1880s to escape the antisemitism and pogroms then prevalent. His father, Jack Sassoon, a Sephardi Jew was born in Thessaloniki, in the northern part of (today) Greece.Sassoon, Vidal. Vidal: The Autobiography, Macmillan (2010) e-book They met in 1925 and married in 1927. They then moved to Shepherd's Bush, which contained a community of Greek Jews. Sassoon had a younger brother, Ivor, who died from a heart attack at the age of 46. His father abandoned the family for another woman when Vidal was three years old. With his mother now unable to support the family, they fell into poverty and were evicted, becoming suddenly homeless. They were forced to move in with his mother's older sister. There, they shared a two-room tenement with his aunt and her three children. The tiny flat where the seven of them lived had no bathroom or inside toilet, forcing them to share the one outside landing toilet with three other families. He remembered often standing in line to use it in freezing weather. Their roof was also falling apart, which let rain pour through. \\"All we could see from our windows was the greyness of the tenement across the street,\\" writes Sassoon. \\"There was ugliness all around.\\" Due to poverty as a single parent, his mother eventually placed Sassoon and his younger brother in a Jewish orphanage, where they stayed for seven years, until he was 11, when his mother remarried. His mother was only allowed to visit them once a month and was never allowed to take them out. =Education= He attended Essendine Road Primary School, a Christian school of about a thousand children. He was frequently taunted by classmates as a \\"Yid\\" or with chants of \\"All Jews have long noses.\\" One of his proudest days at the school was winning the 100-yard dash in an all-school contest. \\"The urge to win has never left me,\\" he writes. Evacuation However, he says that he was \\"a very bad student\\" with abysmal grades in most classes, except for mental arithmetic. After one session of mental arithmetic, his master said teasingly, \\"Sassoon, it is a pleasure to see that you have gaps of intelligence between bouts of ignorance.\\" He took a volunteer job as a choir boy for the local synagogue, which gave him one of the few chances to see his mother who would come on Saturdays. Sassoon and the other children at the school were evacuated after WWII began on 3 September 1939. He was eleven. \\"It's a date I'll never forget,\\" he said. \\"Suddenly my brother and I and all our fellow orphans were on trains with hundreds of thousands of other kids, moving out of London.\\" He and his brother were taken to Holt, Wiltshire, a small village of a thousand people.\\" = First jobs = An underground bomb shelter in London during World War II After his return to London he left school at the age of 14 and worked as a messenger. The war was in full force with London still being bombed, which forced him to sleep in underground shelters. During work hours, he said \\"I got used to seeing bodies and blood, and hearing cries of agony\\" as he carried messages from central London to the docks. Upon the insistence of his mother, they tried to get him into a hairdressing apprenticeship; his mother told him that her ambition was for him to become a professional hairdresser. However, he saw himself becoming a football player, a sport he excelled at. \\"I could not imagine myself backcombing hair and winding up rollers for a living.\\" When she took him to the hairdressing school of a well-known stylist, Adolph Cohen, they were disappointed immediately when they were told it was a two-year programme and would cost much more than they could afford. \\"My mother looked so terribly dejected,\\" he said, as they left the salon. \\"I thought she might faint.\\" A few minutes later, Mr. Cohen called them back to the salon, then told him, \\"You seem to have very good manners, young man. Start Monday and forget the cost.\\" His mother began to cry out of joy. =Wartime activities= At the age of 17, although he had been too young to serve in World War II, he became the youngest member of the 43 Group, a Jewish veterans' underground organisation which broke up fascist meetings in East London.The Archive Hour, BBC Radio 4, first broadcast 19 April 2008. The Daily Telegraph calls him an \\"anti-fascist warrior-hairdresser\\" whose aim was to prevent Sir Oswald Mosley's movement from spreading \\"messages of hatred\\" in the period following World War II. In 1948, at the age of 20, he joined the Palmach (which shortly afterwards was integrated into the Israeli Defence Forces) and fought in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, which began after Israel declared statehood. During an interview, he described the year he spent training with the Israelis as \\"the best year of my life,\\" and recalled how he felt: Career Sassoon trained under Raymond Bessone, in his salon in Mayfair. Sassoon opened his first salon in 1954 in London;\\"British-born celebrity hairdresser Vidal Sassoon dies\\" BBC 9 May 2012 singer-actress Georgia Brown, his friend and neighbour, claimed to be his first customer. Sassoon cutting Mia Farrow's hair for Rosemary's Baby in 1968 Sassoon stated his intentions in designing new, more efficient, hair styles: \\"If I was going to be in hairdressing, I wanted to change things. I wanted to eliminate the superfluous and get down to the basic angles of cut and shape.\\" Sassoon's works include the geometric perm and the \\"Nancy Kwan\\" hairstyles. They were all modern and low-maintenance. The hairstyles created by Sassoon relied on dark, straight, and shiny hair cut into geometric yet organic shapes. In 1964, Sassoon created a short, angular hairstyle cut on a horizontal plane that was the recreation of the classic \\"bob cut.\\" His geometric haircuts seemed to be severely cut, but were entirely lacquer-free, relying on the natural shine of the hair for effect. Advertising and cosmetics executive Natalie Donay is credited with discovering Sassoon in London and bringing him to the United States, where in 1965 he opened his first New York City salon, on Madison Avenue. In 1966, inspired by 1920s film star Clara Bow's close cropped hair, he created designs for Emanuel Ungaro. Director Roman Polanski brought him to Hollywood from London in 1968, at a cost of $5,000 (), to create a unique pixie cut for Mia Farrow, who was to star in Rosemary's Baby. In the early 1970s Sassoon made Los Angeles his home. In 1971 he promoted his 30-year-old second-in-command, artistic director Roger Thompson, to director of the Sassoon salon, explaining jocularly that, \\"Twenty-five years of schlepping behind a barber chair are enough!\\" John Paul DeJoria a friend of Sassoon co-founded Paul Mitchell Systems with Paul Mitchell, one of Sassoon's former students. Mitchell said that Sassoon was \\"the most famous hairstylist in the history of the world.\\" Goldie Hawn's bob cut in Cactus Flower (1969) Sassoon began his \\"Vidal Sassoon\\" line of hair- care products in 1973. The actor Michael Caine, who when young and struggling \\"was roommates with Terence Stamp and Vidal Sassoon ‚Äì he used to cut my hair, and he always had a lot of models around,\\" claimed to have inspired this, saying, \\"I told him that he must have something that is working for him while he slept. I told him he had to make shampoos and other hair-care products.\\" Whatever the inspiration, Sassoon's brand was applied to shampoos and conditioners sold worldwide, with a commercial campaign featuring the slogan \\"If you don't look good, we don't look good.\\" Former salon colleagues also bought Sassoon's salons and acquired the right to use his name, extending the brand in salons into the United Kingdom and the United States. The El Paso, Texas-based Helen of Troy Corporation began manufacturing and marketing Sassoon hair-care products in 1980. In 1983, Richardson-Vicks purchased the Los Angeles-based Vidal Sassoon Inc. as well as Sassoon's Santa Monica, California, hairdressing school; the company had already bought his European businesses. Sassoon's 1982 sales of hair products had topped $110 million, with 80 percent of revenues derived in the US. Two years later the company was bought by Procter & Gamble. Vidal, who remained a consultant through at least the mid-1990s, sued in 2003 for breach of contract and fraud in federal court for allegedly neglecting the marketing of his brand name in favour of the company's other hair product lines, such as Pantene. He sold his business interests in the early 1980s to devote himself to philanthropy. By 2004, it was reported that Sassoon was no longer associated with the brand that bears his name. He also had a short-lived television series called Your New Day with Vidal Sassoon, which aired in 1980. Sassoon was twice a guest on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, on 27 June 1970 and 9 October 2011, when he was also Resident Thinker on the Nowhereisland art project. He was a mystery guest on What's My Line? in March 1967.  Honours  Sassoon was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace in the 2009 Birthday Honours. Personal life Sassoon Salon, Leeds Sassoon married his first wife, Elaine Wood, his salon receptionist, in 1956; the marriage ended in 1958. In 1967, he married his second wife, actress Beverly Adams. They had three biological children and one adopted son: daughter Catya (1968‚Äì2002), an actress who died from a drug-induced heart attack; son Elan BenVidal (b. 17 January 1970); son David (b. circa 1972); and daughter Eden Sassoon. Some sources additionally cite Oley Sassone, a music-video director who spells his last name slightly differently, as a son but this appears to be in error. Sassoon and Adams divorced after 13 years of marriage. His third wife was Jeanette Hartford-Davis, a dressage champion and former fashion model; they married in 1983 and divorced soon after. In 1992 he married designer Rhonda \\"Ronnie\\" Sassoon. Sassoon disinherited his son David, with whom he was estranged. Sassoon in his 2010 autobiography described David, adopted in 1975 at age 3, as an \\"African-American / Asian boy ... with twinkling eyes and an irresistible smile\\" who nonetheless became troubled and was eventually sent to a reform school. =Philanthropy= Having had a lifelong commitment to eradicating anti-Semitism, Sassoon started the Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism, or SICSA, in 1982. Located at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, it is devoted to gathering information about antisemitism worldwide. After selling his company, he then worked towards philanthropic causes such as the Boys Clubs of America and the Performing Arts Council of the Music Center of Los Angeles via his Vidal Sassoon Foundation. He was also active in supporting relief efforts after Hurricane Katrina. It also funded educational pursuits on a need-basis in Israel and elsewhere. At the time of his death he had academies in England, the United States and Canada, while initiating plans to open new ones in Germany and China. Illness and death In June 2011 it was reported that Sassoon had been diagnosed with leukemia two years earlier. He died on 9 May 2012 at his home in Bel Air, Los Angeles. His death was originally reported to be a result of natural causes, and later reported to have been a result of his leukemia. He died in the presence of his family. Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Kevin Maiberger said that when the police arrived at his residence at Mulholland Drive he was already dead. A memorial service was planned for a later date.  Legacy  \\"Vidal was like Christopher Columbus,\\" said Angus Mitchell, who studied under Sassoon. \\"He discovered that the world was round with his cutting system. It was the first language that people could follow.\\" Neil Cornelius, the incumbent owner of Sassoon's first solo venture, called him a \\"hairdressing legend\\". Grace Coddington, Sassoon's former model and creative director of American Vogue, said that he changed the way the public looked at hair: John Barrett of the John Barrett Salon at Bergdorf Goodman said that Sassoon \\"was the creator of sensual hair. This was somebody who changed our industry entirely, not just from the point of view of cutting hair but actually turning it into a business. He was one of the first who had a product line bought out by a major corporation\\". Books and films * Sorry I Kept You Waiting, Madam (1968), his autobiography; New York: Putnam.

It consists of two families: the monotypic Australiteuthis and the diverse and commercially important Loliginidae (~50 species). Some taxonomists classify this taxon as a suborder of the order Teuthida, in which case it is known as Myopsina. This reclassification is due to Myopsina and Oegopsina not being demonstrated to form a clade. A number of morphological features distinguish members of Myopsida from those of its sister group, Oegopsida. Some of the most obvious differences are found in the structure of the eyes: those of myopsid squids lack a secondary eyelid and are instead covered by a transparent corneal membrane, the opening of which is reduced to a microscopic anterior pore in most species. The arms and tentacles are ornamented with simple suckers (hooks are never present), with additional suckers usually borne on the buccal lappets. The carpal (\\"wrist\\") portion of the tentacular club lacks a locking apparatus, and a tentacle pocket is present on the head. The funnel has no lateral adductor muscles. An internalised shell is present in the form of a well-developed gladius, which is located dorsally within the mantle and extends for almost its entire length. In contrast to oegopsids, females possess accessory nidamental glands in addition to the main nidamental glands. They however lack a right oviduct.Jereb, P. & C.F.E. Roper (2010). Squids. In: P.

Myopsids are found in coastal waters worldwide. They are demersal, generally feeding on or near the bottom.

When income drops, people buy standard or economy vehicles instead. In economics, a luxury good (or upmarket good) is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally as income rises, so that expenditures on the good become a greater proportion of overall spending. Luxury goods are in contrast to necessity goods, where demand increases proportionally less than income. Luxury goods is often used synonymously with superior goods. The word \\"luxury\\" originated from the Latin word luxus, which means indulgence of the senses, regardless of cost.  Definition  A luxury good can be identified by comparing the demand for the good at one point in time against the demand for the good at a different point in time, with a different income level. When income goes up, demand for luxury goods goes up even more than income went up. When income goes down, demand for luxury goods go down even more than income went down. For example, if income goes up 1%, and the demand for a product goes up 2%, then the product is a luxury good. This contrasts with basic goods, for which demand stays the same or decreases only slightly as income goes down. Market characteristics Wine and foie gras Luxury goods have high income elasticity of demand: as people become wealthier, they will buy proportionately more luxury goods. This also means, however, that should there be a decline in income its demand will drop more than proportionately. Income elasticity of demand is not constant with respect to income, and may change sign at different levels of income. That is to say, a luxury good may become a necessity good or even an inferior good at different income levels. Some luxury products have been claimed to be examples of Veblen goods, with a positive price elasticity of demand: for example, making a perfume more expensive can increase its perceived value as a luxury good to such an extent that sales can go up, rather than down. However, it is important to note that Veblen goods are not the same as luxury goods in general. Although the technical term luxury good is independent of the goods' quality, they are generally considered to be goods at the highest end of the market in terms of quality and price. Classic luxury goods include haute couture clothing, accessories, and luggage. Many markets have a luxury segment including, for example, luxury versions of automobiles, yachts, wine, bottled water, coffee, tea, foods, watches, clothes, jewelry, and high fidelity sound equipment. Luxuries may be services. The hiring of full-time or live-in domestic servants is a luxury reflecting disparities of income. Some financial services, especially in some brokerage houses, can be considered luxury services by default because persons in lower-income brackets generally do not use them. Luxury goods often have special luxury packaging to differentiate the products from mainstream competitors. Market trends Originally, luxury goods were available only to the very wealthy and \\"aristocratic world of old money\\" that offered them a history of tradition, superior quality, along with a pampered buying experience. Luxury goods have been transformed by a shift from custom-made (bespoke) works with exclusive distribution practices by specialized, quality-minded family-run and small businesses to a mass production of specialty branded goods by profit-focused large corporations and marketers. The trend in modern luxury is simply a product or service that is marketed, packaged, and sold by global corporations that are focused \\"on growth, visibility, brand awareness, advertising, and, above all, profits.\\" Increasingly, luxury logos now available to all consumers at a premium price across the world including online. The three dominant trends are the main factors that have accelerated the rapid growth of the industry, including the customer base and variations in the consumptions of different brands. The three dominant trends in the global luxury goods market are globalization, consolidation, and diversification. Consolidation involves the growth of big companies and ownership of brands across many segments of luxury products. Examples include LVMH, Richemont, and Kering, which dominate the market in areas ranging from luxury drinks to fashion and cosmetics. Global consumer companies, such as Procter & Gamble, are also attracted to the industry, due to the difficulty of making a profit in the mass consumer goods market. The customer base for various luxury goods continue to be more culturally diversified, and this presents more unseen challenges and new opportunities to companies in this industry. Market size The luxury goods market has been on an upward climb for many years. Apart from the setback caused by the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, the industry has performed well, particularly in 2000. In that year, the world luxury goods market ‚Äì which includes drinks, fashion, cosmetics, fragrances, watches, jewelry, luggage, handbags ‚Äì was worth close to $170 billion and grew 7.9 percent.‚ÄúThe World Market for Luxury Goods.‚Äù Global Market for Luxury Goods. Nov 1, 2001, March 5, 2007. The United States has been the largest regional market for luxury goods and is estimated to continue to be the leading personal luxury goods market in 2013, with a value of 62.5 billion euros. The largest sector in this category was luxury drinks, including premium whisky, champagne, and cognac. This sector was the only one that suffered a decline in value (-0.9 percent). The watches and jewelry section showed the strongest performance, growing in value by 23.3 percent, while the clothing and accessories section grew 11.6 percent between 1996 and 2000, to $32.8 billion. North America is the largest regional market for luxury goods. The largest ten markets for luxury goods account for 83 percent of overall sales, and include Japan, China, United States, Russia, Germany, Italy, France, United Kingdom, Brazil, Spain, and Switzerland. In 2012, China surpassed Japan as the world's largest luxury market. China's luxury consumption accounts for over 25% of the global market. The Economist Intelligence Unit published a report on the outlook for luxury goods in Asia which explored the trends and forecasts for the luxury goods of China market across key markets in Asia. According to the Global Wealth and Lifestyle Report 2020, with Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tokyo and Singapore four of the five most expensive cities for luxury goods were located in Asia. In 2014, the luxury sector was expected to grow over the following 10 years because of 440 million consumers spending a total of 880 billion euros, or $1.2 trillion. Art history Secular Rococo luxury or treasure binding for a book, using techniques from the making of gold boxes, in gold, mother of pearl and hardstone, Berlin, 1750‚Äì1760. By this time such lavish bindings were unusual. Though often verging on the meaningless in modern marketing, \\"luxury\\" remains a legitimate and current technical term in art history for objects that are especially highly decorated to very high standards and use expensive materials. The term is especially used for medieval manuscripts to distinguish between practical working books for normal use, and fully illuminated manuscripts, that were often bound in treasure bindings with metalwork and jewels. These are often much larger, with less text on each page and many illustrations, and if liturgical texts were originally usually kept on the altar or sacristy rather any library that the church or monastery who owned them may have had. Secular luxury manuscripts were commissioned by the very wealthy and differed in the same ways from cheaper books. \\"Luxury\\" may be used for other applied arts where both utilitarian and luxury versions of the same types of objects were made. This might cover metalwork, ceramics, glass, arms and armour, and a wide range of objects. It is much less used for objects with no function beyond being an artwork: paintings, drawings and sculpture, even though the disparity in cost between an expensive and cheap work may have been as large. Scope of the term With increasing \\"democratization\\" of luxury goods, new product categories have been created within the luxury market, called \\"accessible luxury\\" or \\"mass luxury\\". These are meant specifically for the middle class, which sometimes called the \\"aspiring class\\" in this context. Because luxury has now diffused into the masses, defining the word has become more difficult. Bringing up to the modern day the long and generally very unsuccessful history of sumptuary laws designed to curb excessive personal consumption, in February 2013, the Chinese government banned advertisements for luxury goods on its official state radio and television channels. Socioeconomic significance A necklace by Van Cleef & Arpels Several manufactured products attain the status of \\"luxury goods\\" due to their design, quality, durability, or performance that are remarkably superior to the comparable substitutes. Thus, virtually every category of goods available on the market today includes a subset of similar products whose \\"luxury\\" is marked by better-quality components and materials, solid construction, stylish appearance, increased durability, better performance, advanced features, and so on. As such, these luxury goods may retain or improve the basic functionality for which all items of a given category are originally designed. There are also goods that are perceived as luxurious by the public simply because they play a role of status symbols as such goods tend to signify the purchasing power of those who acquire them. These items, while not necessarily being better (in quality, performance, or appearance) than their less expensive substitutes, are purchased with the main purpose of displaying wealth or income of their owners. These kinds of goods are the objects of a socio-economic phenomenon called conspicuous consumption and commonly include luxury vehicles, watches, jewelry, designer clothing, yachts, as well as large residences, urban mansions, and country houses. Luxury brands A luxury handbag by Herm√®s The idea of a luxury brand is not necessarily a product or a price point, but a mindset where core values that are expressed by a brand are directly connected to the producer's dedication and alignment to perceptions of quality with its customers' values and aspirations. Thus, it is these target customers, not the product, that make a luxury brand. Brands that are considered luxury connect with their customers by communicating that they are the top of their class or considered the best in their field. Furthermore, these brands must deliver - in some meaningful way - measurably better performance. What consumers perceive as luxurious brands and products change over the years, but there appear to be three main drivers: (1) a high price, especially when compared to other brands within its segment; (2) limited supply, in that a brand may not need to be expensive, but it arguably should not be easily obtainable and contributing to the customers' feeling that they have something special; and (3) endorsement by celebrities, which can make a brand or particular products more appealing for consumers and thus more \\"luxurious\\" in their minds. Two additional elements of luxury brands include special packaging and personalization. These differentiating elements distance the brands from the mass market and thus provide them with a unique feeling and user experience as well as a special and memorable \\"luxury feel\\" for customers. However, the concept of a luxury brand is now so popular that it is used in almost every retail, manufacturing, and service sector. Moreover, new marketing concepts such as \\"mass-luxury\\" or \\"hyper luxury\\" further blur the definition of what is a luxury product, a luxury brand, or a luxury company. Examples include LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy), the largest luxury good producer in the world with over fifty brands, including Louis Vuitton, the brand with the world's first fashion designer label. The LVMH group made a net profit of ‚Ç¨8.1 billion on sales of ‚Ç¨42.6 billion in 2017. Other market leaders include Richemont and Kering (previously named PPR). A rather small group in comparison, the wealthy tend to be extremely influential. Once a brand gets an \\"endorsement\\" from members of this group, then the brand can be defined as a true \\"luxury\\" brand. An example of different product lines in the same brand is found in the automotive industry, with \\"entry-level\\" cars marketed to younger, less wealthy consumers, and higher-cost models for older and more wealthy consumers. The advertising expenditure for the average luxury brand is 5-15% of sales revenue, or about 25% with the inclusion of other communications such as public relations, events and sponsorships. Luxury department stores Since the development of mass-market \\"luxury\\" brands in the 1800s, department stores dedicated to selling all major luxury brands have opened up in most major cities around the world. Le Bon March√© in Paris, France is credited as one of the first of its kind. In the United States, the development of luxury-oriented department stores not only changed the retail industry, but also ushered the idea of freedom through consumerism, and a new opportunity for middle- and upper-class women. Luxury shopping districts Fashion brands within the luxury goods market tend to be concentrated in exclusive or affluent districts of cities around the world. These include: * Amsterdam's P.C.

She is arguably best known for her championing of correctness and aesthetics in the English language, which is the subject of her popular and widely discussed 2003 book, Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation. The book was inspired by a BBC Radio 4 show about punctuation, Cutting a Dash, which she presented. Besides her promotion of linguistic prescription and commentary on English grammar, Truss has written many radio plays, both comedic and dramatic. She has also written novels, and grammar guides for children. Early life Lynne Truss was born on 31 May 1955 in Kingston upon Thames. She was educated at the Tiffin Girls' School and University College London, where she was awarded a first class degree in English Language and Literature. Career Truss began her media career as a literary editor. She then spent six years as a television critic for The Times, before moving into sports journalism for the same newspaper. She spent four years in the latter field, and in 2009 wrote a book about her experiences with it, Get Her Off the Pitch: How Sport Took Over My Life. Politics In August 2014, Truss was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's referendum on that issue.

The IBM 407 Accounting Machine, introduced in 1949, was one of a long line of IBM tabulating machines dating back to the days of Herman Hollerith. It had a card reader and printer; a summary punch could be attached. Processing was directed by a control panel. The 407 was the central component of many unit record equipment shops which were the mainstay of IBM's business at the time. It could print digits, letters and several special characters in any of 120 print positions, spaced . In 1976 the IBM 407 Accounting Machine was withdrawn from marketing. Description The 407 read punched cards, totaled fields on the cards, made simple decisions, printed results, and, with the aid of a summary punch, output results on punched cards that could be input to other processing steps. The operation of the 407 was directed by the use of a removable control panel and a carriage tape. Exit hubs (impulse emitting) on the control panel are wired to entry hubs (impulse accepting) for the task to be done (see Wiring of unit record equipment). There are hubs for each card column (at both reading stations), print position, counter digit, and so on. Logic tests were also available. Each input card was read at two successive reading stations. Thus, for example, fields in a card could be compared with the following card and, should a change be detected, say in invoice number, totals could be printed. Unlike earlier IBM tabulating machines, which had 80 read brushes at each read station, one for each column, the 407 had 960 brushes at each station, one for each possible hole in a punched card. Cards were held in position during each read cycle and the per digit pulses needed were generated using commutators, one for each column. This allowed the card to be read more than once at each station, for greater flexibility. For printing, the 407 used type wheels, an improvement over earlier tabulators that used print bars. The 48-character wheels were stationary until a character impulse was to be printed; the wheel then rotated in two steps. the first step rotated each wheel to one of 12 groups of characters based on the digit impulse associated with that print position. Digit impulses included the digits 1 through 9 (in reverse order), the 8-3 and 8-4 combination punches and a group (N) for no digit impulse. One of four characters in each group was then selected based on the zone impulse (0, 11, 12 or none) for that character position. This selection happened at the same time the type wheel was driven against the ribbon. The timing of the zone impulse selection was controlled by a complex set of linkages and electromagnets called the Analyzer, one for each of the 120 print positions. Each type wheel also emitted an impulse (called \\"echo\\") for the character actually printed. The control panel could be wired so the echo impulses were accumulated for totals; report totals then reliably reflected what had actually been printed. Mechanical systems including the card reader, printer, counters and storage units were all driven by a single motor, which also drove an oil pump and a generator that provided 46-volt power for the electrical logic. This included about 900 relays which were mounted on three swing-out gates. The control panel had a matrix of 43 by 52 holes, most of which were assigned. The 407 was available in a model that could read 100 cards per minute, and one reading 150 cards per minute. The former had a relay which would inhibit every third card feed cycle (giving the machine a characteristic \\"shrink-shrink-thunk\\" sound). It was possible to insert a folded card between that relay's contacts to \\"overclock\\" the slower model to the faster speed. Market impact The 407 rented from $800 to $920 per month ($ to $ per month in dollars), depending on the model.IBM History page about 407 Its print mechanism was used in the IBM 716 introduced in 1952 with the IBM 701 computer, and the 716 was used with many machines in the IBM 700/7000 series. The 407 itself was adapted as an input/output unit on the IBM 650. Later, the 407 print mechanism was used in the IBM 1132 line printer, part of the low cost IBM 1130 computer system, introduced in 1965. The IBM World Trade Corporation marketed Computing Accounting Machines (CAM), variations of either the IBM 402 or 407 with an attached computer. CAM variations of the 407 included the IBM 421, 444, and 447.IBM 402, 403 and 407; IBM 421, 444, 407 and 447 for World Trade Corporation Computing Accounting Machines, IBM, undated, 11pp, A24-3475-0.

By 1519, he was an outspoken critic of the Roman Catholic Church. Hutten was a bridge between the Renaissance humanists and the Lutheran Reformation. He was a leader of the Imperial Knights of the Holy Roman Empire along with Franz von Sickingen. Both were the leaders in the Knights' Revolt. Biography His life may be divided into four parts: his youth and cloister life (1488‚Äì1504); his wanderings in pursuit of knowledge (1504‚Äì1515); his strife with Ulrich of W√ºrttemberg (1515‚Äì1519); and his connection with the Reformation (1510‚Äì1523). =Youth and cloister life= Hutten was born in Steckelberg Castle, now in Schl√ºchtern, Hesse. He was the eldest son of a poor and not undistinguished knightly family. As he was small of stature and sickly his father destined him for the cloister, and, when he was ten years old, his father placed him at the nearby Benedictine monastery in Fulda to be educated as a monk. The monastic school there was highly regarded in Germany, and he received an excellent education. However, he disliked the mode of life, and in 1505 fled to Cologne. He thus obtained his freedom, but incurred the undying anger of his father. =Pursuit of knowledge= Plaque to Ulrich von Hutten, Schlossstrasse, Wittenberg In Cologne, Hutten met Hoogstraten, Johannes Rhagius (also known as Johannes Aesticampianus), and other scholars and poets. In 1506, he went to Erfurt, but soon after rejoined Rhagius at Frankfurt an der Oder where a new university was opening. There he took his master's degree and published his first poem. In 1507, he followed Rhagius to Leipzig. The 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica reported that, in 1508, a shipwrecked beggar on the Pomeranian coast, while the New International Encyclopedia described him as stricken down with the pestilence and recovering. In 1509, he was studying theology at the University of Greifswald, where he was at first received kindly. In 1510 he spent time further studying theology at Wittenberg University.Von Hutten plaque, Wittenberg However his burgher patrons could not tolerate the poet's airs and vanity and ill-timed assertions of his higher rank. Wherefore Hutten left Greifswald, and as he went was robbed of clothes and books, his only baggage, by the servants of his late friends. In the dead of winter, half starved, frozen, penniless, he reached Rostock. In Rostock, again the humanists received him gladly, and under their protection he wrote against his Greifswald patrons, thus beginning the long list of his satires and fierce attacks on personal or public foes. Rostock could not hold him long, and he wandered on to Wittenberg, where in 1511 he published his Ars Versificatoria, a work on versification. His next stop was Leipzig, and thence to Vienna, where he hoped to win the emperor Maximilian's favour by an elaborate national poem on the war with Venice. But neither Maximilian nor the University of Vienna would lift a hand for him. So Hutten went on to Italy, and settled at Pavia to study law. In 1512, his studies were interrupted by war: in the siege of Pavia by papal troops and Swiss, he was plundered by both sides, and escaped, sick and penniless, to Bologna. On his recovery, he served for a short time as a private soldier in the emperor's army, but by 1514 was back in Germany. Thanks to his poetic gifts and the friendship of Eitelwolf von Stein (d. 1515), he won the favour of the elector of Mainz, Archbishop Albert of Brandenburg. Here high dreams of a learned career rose on him: Mainz should be made the metropolis of a grand humanist movement, the centre of good style and literary form. =Strife with Ulrich of W√ºrttemberg= Hutten's gravestone on Ufenau island But the murder in 1515 of his relative Hans von Hutten by Ulrich, duke of W√ºrttemberg changed the whole course of Hutten's life; satire, chief refuge of the weak, became his weapon. With one hand he took his part in the famous Epistol√¶ Obscurorum Virorum (The Letters of Obscure Men), and with the other launched scathing letters, eloquent Ciceronian orations, or biting satires against the duke. These works made him known throughout Germany. Epistol√¶ Obscurorum Virorum was written in support of Hutten's mentor, the prominent theologian Johannes Reuchlin, who was engaged in a struggle to prevent the confiscation of Hebrew texts. Epistol√¶ contained a series of fictitious letters, addressed to Hardwin von Gr√§tz, that sarcastically attacked the scholastic theologians who were acting against Reuchlin. Hutten went again to Italy to take the degree of doctor of laws, and returned to Germany in 1517. There the emperor took him under his protection and bestowed on him the honors of a poet's laureate crown and knighthood. However, he also spared Ulrich, duke of W√ºrttemberg. While in Italy, Hutten had become imbued with a fierce hatred for the papacy, which he bitterly attacked in his preface to an edition of Laurentius Valla's De Donatione Constantini, published in 1517. He thus helped prepare the way for Martin Luther. In 1518, Hutten accompanied his patron, Archbishop Albert, on several official journeys to Paris and to the Diet of Augsburg, where Luther had his famous conference with Thomas Cajetan. Subsequently, Hutten established a small printing press, and published pamphlets written in the German language attacking the Pope and the Roman clergy. =Participation in the Reformation= Lake Z√ºrich, Ufenau island: St Peter & Paul church, where Ulrich von Hutten is buried Archbishop of Mainz Albrecht von Brandenburg denounced him at Rome, whereupon in 1519 Hutten became a supporter of Luther and his calls for religious reform. Unlike Luther, Hutten tried to enforce reformation by military means when he, along with Franz von Sickingen attempted to begin popular crusade within the Holy Roman Empire against the power of the Roman Catholic Church in favour of Luther's reformed religion. In what is known as the Knights' Revolt, they attacked the lands of the Archbishop of Trier in 1522. The archbishop held out, however, and the knights were eventually defeated in 1523, destroying them as a significant political force within the empire. Following his defeat, Hutten tried to convince Erasmus of Rotterdam to side with the Reformation. Erasmus refused to take sides, and he also refused to see Hutten when the latter came to Basel in 1523, ill and impoverished, to see him. Their estrangement culminated in a literary quarrel between the two humanists. Hutten died in seclusion on the island of Ufenau on Lake Zurich. Health issues For the final 15 years of his life, Hutten suffered from the \\"French disease\\" (or syphilis), of which he died. He wrote a text in 1519, De morbo Gallico (On the French disease), about the symptoms of what is thought to be syphilis and its treatment with Guaiacum. His text is regarded as one of the first patient narratives in the history of medicine; Holbein the Younger's portrait of him from 1523 is the first known realistic portrait of a person with the disease.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322948546_First_Portrait_of_a_Syphilitic_Patient_Ulrich_Von_Hutten Works Hutten was more open in the expression of his opinions than any other man, probably, of his age. He did much to prepare the way for the Reformation and to promote it. He was a master of the Latin language, and excelled in satirical and passionate invective. His literary life is generally divided into three periods: (1) Period of Latin poems (1509‚Äì16); (2) period of letters and orations (1515‚Äì17); (3) period of dialogues and letters in Latin and German (1517‚Äì23). In all he published some 45 different works. His chief works were his Ars versificandi (The Art of Prosody, 1511); the Nemo (1518); a work on the Morbus Gallicus (1519); the volume of Steckelberg complaints against Duke Ulrich (including his four Ciceronian Orations, his Letters and the Phalarismus) also in 1519; the Vadismus (1520); and the controversy with Erasmus at the end of his life. Besides these were many poems in Latin and German. =Letters of Obscure Men= His most noteworthy contribution to literature was his portion of the Epistol√¶ Obscurorum Virorum (Letters of Obscure Men). At first the cloister world, not discerning its irony, welcomed the work as a defence of their position against Johann Reuchlin; though their eyes were soon opened by the favor with which the learned world received it. The Epistol√¶ were eagerly bought up; the first part (41 letters) appeared at the end of 1515; early in 1516 there was a second edition; later in 1516 a third, with an appendix of seven letters; in 1517 appeared the second part (62 letters), to which a fresh appendix of eight letters was subjoined soon after.. How far Hutten was the parent of this celebrated work was long a matter of dispute. Hutten, in a letter addressed to Richard Croke, denied that he was the author of the book, but there is no doubt as to his connexion with it. Erasmus was of opinion that there were three authors, of whom Crotus Rubianus was the originator of the idea, and Hutten a chief contributor. D. F. Strauss concluded that Hutten had no share in the first part, but that his hand is clearly visible in the second part, which Strauss attributed‚Äîalong with the more serious and severe tone of that bitter portion of the satire‚Äîin the main to Hutten. Holborn, however, citing the later scholarship of B√∂mer, regards the matter of authorship \\"as closed in all essential points\\". According to them, the first part was the work of Rubianus (save for the first epistle, written by Hutten), while the appendix and the second part were mostly by Hutten, with additional contributions from Hermann von dem Busche and others. = Life as a vassal knight = Hutten writes a graphic description of the harshness of life as a vassal knight (a Lehnsmann) in medieval Europe in a letter to Willibald Pirckheimer(1470‚Äì1530) that dispels the glamour with which the life of the nobility is sometimes viewed. Family In addition to Hans von Hutten, Ulrich von Hutten was also related to the German adventurer Philipp von Hutten. Legacy * As a student at the University of Bonn, Carl Schurz began work on a tragedy based on Hutten's life. He abandoned it, never to return to finish the work, when the 1848 revolution broke out in Germany. * During World War II, the German Wehrmacht named some of its final infantry divisions after noteworthy individuals of German history. One such infantry division, fielded in March 1945, was the Infantry Division Ulrich von Hutten.

He was born in Haslingden, Lancashire, and is buried in Thaxted churchyard in Essex. Early years Alan Rawsthorne was born in Deardengate House, Haslingden, Lancashire , to Hubert Rawsthorne (1868‚Äì1943), a well-off medical doctor, and his wife, Janet Bridge (1877/8‚Äì1927) . Despite what appears to have been a happy and affectionate family life with his parents and elder sister, Barbara (the only sibling), in beautiful Lancashire countryside, as a boy Rawsthorne suffered from fragile health (; ). Although he did at various times attend schools in Southport, much of Rawsthorne's early education came through private tutoring at home . Despite a childhood aptitude for music and literature, Rawsthorne's parents tried to steer him away from his dreams of becoming a professional musician. As a result, he unsuccessfully tried to take on degree courses at Liverpool University, first in dentistry and then architecture. Concerning dentistry, Rawsthorne is on record as having said \\"I gave that up, thank God, before getting near anyone's mouth\\", while his friend Constant Lambert quipped \\"Mr Rawsthorne assures me that he has given up the practice of dentistry, even as a hobby\\" . Career In 1925, Rawsthorne was finally able to enrol at the Royal Manchester College of Music , where his teachers included Frank Merrick for the piano and Carl Fuchs for the cello. In 1927, Rawsthorne's mother died aged just forty-nine. After graduating from the Royal Manchester College of Music around 1930, Rawsthorne spent the next couple of years pursuing his piano training with Egon Petri at Zakopane in Poland, and then briefly also in Berlin . On his return to England in 1932, Rawsthorne took up a post as pianist and teacher at Dartington Hall in Devon, where he became composer-in-residence for the School of Dance and Mime . In 1934, Rawsthorne left for London to try his fortune as a freelance composer. His first real public success arrived four years later with a performance of his Theme and Variations for Two Violins at the 1938 International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) Festival in London. The next year, his large scale Symphonic Studies for orchestral was performed in Warsaw, again at the ISCM Festival. The first in a line of completely assured orchestral scores, the Symphonic Studies, which can be heard as a concerto for orchestra in all but name, rapidly helped Rawsthorne establish himself as a composer possessing a highly distinctive musical voice (; ). Other acclaimed works by Rawsthorne include a viola sonata (1937), two piano concertos (1939, 1951), an oboe concerto (1947), two violin concertos (1948, 1956), a concerto for string orchestra (1949), and the Elegy for guitar (1971), a piece written for and completed by Julian Bream after the composer's death. Other works include a cello concerto, three acknowledged string quartets among other chamber works, and three symphonies. Rawsthorne wrote a number of film scores. His best‚Äìknown work in this field was the music for the 1953 British war film The Cruel Sea , and his other scores included many popular British films, such as The Captive Heart (1946), School for Secrets (1946), Uncle Silas (1947), Saraband for Dead Lovers (1948), Pandora and the Flying Dutchman (1951), Where No Vultures Fly (1951), West of Zanzibar (1954), The Man Who Never Was (1956) and Floods of Fear (1958). Family Rawsthorne was married to Isabel Rawsthorne (n√©e Isabel Nicholas), an artist and model well known in the Paris and Soho art scenes. Her contemporaries included Andr√© Derain, Alberto Giacometti, Pablo Picasso and Francis Bacon. Isabel Rawsthorne was the widow of composer Constant Lambert and stepmother to Kit Lambert, manager of the rock group the Who, who died in 1981. Isabel died in 1992.

Biography At the end of autumn 2001 during Helloween's \\"The Dark Ride Tour\\". Roland Grapow, present in the band since 1989, and Uli Kusch from 1994, decided to form a side project. Shortly after this decision, both were fired from their long-time job in Helloween. Born the name \\"Masterplan\\" based on the idea that they would be master musicians with the future in their hands, in the words of the Headbanger - Gerardo Trevino Garza (Creator of the name), starts the newest power metal band of the new millennium. Roland subsequently invited for keyboards Janne Wirman, which at that time played in the band Children Of Bodom. For vocals, Russell Allen was invited but had to decline the invitation since he was firm in his own band Symphony X. A second invitation was made for Michael Kiske, who also rejected the proposal, claiming that he wanted to keep away from the metal scene. After contact with Norwegian band Ark famous album Burn The Sun and subsequently the album Worldchanger, singer J√∏rn Lande was invited. J√∏rn accepted the invitation, completing the band after about six months of the beginning of the project. Their first full-length self-titled album, Masterplan was released in 2003, produced by Andy Sneap. The band then consisted of Grapow and Kusch with J√∏rn Lande. The main part of the keyboard lines on the album were arranged and programmed by Roland and Uli, while keyboard player Janne \\"Warman\\" Wirman recorded some sessions for the album, but could not stay on as a full-time member due to his commitments to Children of Bodom. Axel Mackenrott replaced him on tour and since then as a permanent member. Studio bassist J√ºrgen Attig (Casanova) helped with some bass lines on the recordings, but Grapow was the main bassist for the album. For tour and subsequent recordings, Jan-S√∂ren Eckert was hired as a permanent member. The band received the \\"European Border Breakers Award\\" from the European Commission in 2004, for the debut album success around Europe. In January 2005 Masterplan released their second album, Aeronautics once again produced by Andy Sneap and the band. After two successful albums and their respective tours, during the writing of the third album the band parted ways with vocalist J√∏rn Lande, citing \\"musical differences\\" as the reason for the split. The split was amicable enough that J√∏rn agreed to perform four previously arranged live appearances before departing although two of these were eventually canceled by the promoters. On October 4, 2006 Uli Kusch announced his departure from the band in an interview with Darkside.ru. Although not discussing the details of what had happened, he mentioned the democratic principles of making decisions in the band as one of the reasons of his leaving - according to him, it often made getting a consensus nearly impossible. Three days later, Masterplan announced their new line-up through their official web site: Grapow, Mackenrott, Eckert, with new members Mike DiMeo (Riot, The Lizards) and Mike Terrana (ex-Artension, ex-Rage, Metalium, ex-Axel Rudi Pell). The band toured with Saxon as an opening act for Saxon's Inner Sanctum tour. The band's third album, suitably titled MK II, was released on February 26, 2007. It was produced this time by the band's actual leader, Roland Grapow himself, at his own studio in Slovakia. The album was recorded in September and October 2006. On January 11, 2009, Mike DiMeo confirmed on his MySpace page that he had parted ways with Masterplan. On July 25, 2009, the band finally revealed that J√∏rn Lande has made his return to Masterplan. On April 16, 2010, a single titled Far From the End of the World was released to precede the band's new fourth album, Time To Be King, once again produced by Roland Grapow. On July 13, 2011, the band has announced in their official website that they were writing songs for a new album. The album is set to be released in March 2013...:: MASTERPLAN ::.. In July 2012, it was announced that Martin Marthus Skaroupka (Cradle of Filth drummer) will play on the new Masterplan album...:: Masterplan taps Martin \\"Marthus\\" Skaroupka (Cradle of Filth drummer) for new album ::.. In early November, it was announced that Rick Altzi and Jari Kainulainen would replace Jorn Lande and Jan Eckert on the upcoming album...:: Masterplan announces new line-up (2012) ::.. In November 2012, during an interview with Metal Shock Finland's Chief Editor, Mohsen Fayyazi, when talking about Jorn's departure from the band, Roland stated the following: \\"Everybody always expects something special from Jorn, but it‚Äôs a very unstable situation. To keep happy it‚Äôs not easy and to be honest I‚Äôve not heard from him for 2 years. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, we‚Äôre still friends but we just don‚Äôt have much contact.\\" On February 21, 2013 the new album was announced. The title of the album is Novum Initium and it was released on June 14, 2013 through German record label AFM Records. In an interview made in Italy, on September 16, 2016, Roland Grapow confirmed the addition of At Vance member Kevin Kott as the drummer of the band replacing Martin Marthus ≈†karoupka whose commitments with his other band Cradle of Filth prevented him for playing shows with Masterplan. They also announced the release of a new album consisting of re-recordings of Helloween songs written by Roland Grapow from the time he was in the band. The album, PumpKings, was released on July 28, 2017. Grapow stated that the album was not any kind of revenge for being fired from Helloween, or not being invited to their Pumpkins United World Tour in 2017: \\"[fans] all thought it was kind of a revenge or something... now I remember. To me, it's just a relaxing situation [...] I never had this in my mind. It's just a bit coincidental because I delayed this album for two years and it came out at the same time when the reunion tour came.\\" Members =Current members= * Roland Grapow - guitars (2001-present), lead vocals, bass, keyboards (2001-2003) * Axel Mackenrott - keyboards (2003-present) * Rick Altzi - lead vocals (2012-present) * Jari Kainulainen - bass (2012-present) * Kevin Kott - drums (2016-present) =Former members= * Uli Kusch - drums (2001-2006) * J√∏rn Lande - lead vocals (2001-2006, 2009-2012) * Jan S.

The family was previously considered to be monotypic but the World Register of Marine Species assigns two genera to this family. The species classified under Histioteuthidae are mostly weakly muscled, moderately sized squid with a maximum mantle length of 33 cm. They generally have very long, robust arms and a short mantle with small, rounded fins. Their main distinguishing feature is that the eyes are different sizes and orient in different vertical directions. The larger left eye is semitubular, mobile, generally is directed back and up as indicated by the pattern of iridophores on the eye's outer surface. This means that when the squid is positioned onliquely the eye is pointed upwards towards the surface. It is thought that this is used to detect animals above the squid silhouetted against the sun during the day. The right eye has a normal shape and is oriented laterally and slightly downward. This arrangement gives the family the common name of cock-eyed squid.

The San Rafael Swell, measuring approximately , consists of a giant dome-shaped anticline of sandstone, shale, and limestone that was pushed up during the Paleocene Laramide Orogeny 60‚Äì40 million years ago. Since that time, infrequent but powerful flash floods have eroded the sedimentary rocks into numerous valleys, canyons, gorges, mesas, buttes and badlands. The swell is part of the Colorado Plateau physiographic region. Geography Interstate 70 in the San Rafael Swell Interstate 70 divides the Swell into northern and southern sections, and provides the only interstate access to the region. The swell lies entirely within Emery County. The northern Swell is drained mainly by the San Rafael River, while the southern Swell is drained mainly by Muddy Creek, which eventually joins the Fremont River to become Dirty Devil River northeast of Hanksville, Utah. The Dirty Devil River flows southward into the Colorado River, while the San Rafael River joins the Green River before it also flows into the Colorado. Muddy Creek cuts into the western edge of the Swell, exits at Muddy Creek Gorge, and then flows across the Blue Hills Badlands near Caineville to its confluence with the Fremont River. Geology The Little Grand Canyon on the San Rafael River The San Rafael Swell was formed when deeply buried Precambrian dike swarm rocks faulted, or broke, during the Laramide orogeny, about 60 million years ago. These \\"basement\\" rocks below the present-day Swell moved upwards relative to the surrounding areas and caused the overlying sedimentary rocks to fold into a dome-like shape called an anticline. The resulting structure is analogous to a series of blankets draped over a box. Since that time, the relentless force of running water has eroded the geologic layers, resulting in older rocks becoming exposed in the middle of the Swell, and younger rocks exposed around the edges. Many of the most impressive landforms are composed of more resistant rocks, including the Jurassic Navajo Sandstone, Jurassic Wingate Sandstone, and Permian Coconino Sandstone. The folding is much steeper on the eastern edge of the Swell than in the west, and this eastern edge is referred to as the San Rafael Reef. Both the San Rafael River and Muddy Creek drain out of the high Wasatch Plateau and the cut directly across the uplift of the Reef, which marks them as superimposed streams, pre-dating the time of the uplift. Part of the Swell has geographic features that resemble Mars. The Mars Society decided to set up the Mars Desert Research Station in the area as a Mars analog for such reasons. Ecology The San Rafael Swell is an area of high plant endemism, with many native plants occurring nowhere else in the world. An example is the endangered San Rafael cactus (Pediocactus despainii).Pediocactus despainii. Center for Plant Conservation. History Evidence of Native American cultures, including the Fremont, Paiute, and Ute, is common throughout the San Rafael Swell in the form of pictograph and petroglyph panels. Examples are the Millsite Rock Art and the Buckhorn Draw Pictograph Panel, with rock art left by the Barrier Canyon Culture and the Fremont Culture. From about 1776 to the mid-1850s the Old Spanish Trail trade route passed through (or just north of) the Swell. In the past 150 years, areas of the Swell have been used for the grazing of sheep and cattle, as well as for uranium mining. Many of the gravel roads in the interior of the swell were originally used to service the uranium mining activities. Although surrounded by the communities of Price, Green River, Hanksville, Ferron, Castle Dale, and Huntington, the Swell itself does not support permanent residents. The Swell has been used by Hollywood filmmakers as a location setting for alien planets, including the Planet Vulcan in the 2009 film Star Trek and the alien world in Galaxy Quest. In 2002, then-governor Mike Leavitt of Utah proposed the creation of a San Rafael Swell National Monument. President George W. Bush, who had authority to create such a monument under the Antiquities Act, never acted on Leavitt's proposal. The idea of federal designation of the San Rafael Swell as a National Monument resurfaced in 2010 in a Department of the Interior document. In May 2018, US Representative John Curtis put forward a bill to make the area a National Monument, to be called \\"Jurassic National Monument.\\"Jurassic National Monument San Rafael Recreation Area Aerial view of San Rafael Desert. Goblin Valley is at lower extreme right, with Wild Horse Butte to the left. The shadow of a contrail marks the San Rafael Reef, with the Swell behind it. The area is managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. On March 12, 2019, the Emery County Public Land Management Act was signed into law as the Dingell Natural Resources Act. As part of this designation, approximately 217,000 acres were protected as the San Rafael Swell Recreation Area. Goblin Valley State Park The following wilderness areas were congressionally designated around the San Rafael Swell Recreation Area as part of the John D. Dingell. Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act: Big Wild Horse Mesa (18,192 acres), Cold Wash (11,001 acres), Devil‚Äôs Canyon (8,675 acres), Eagle Canyon (13,832 acres), Horse Valley (12,201 acres), Little Ocean Draw (20,660 acres), Little Wild Horse Canyon (5,479 acres), Lower Last Chance (19,339 acres), Mexican Mountain (76,413 acres), Middle Wild Horse Mesa (16,343 acres), Muddy Creek (98,023 acres), Red‚Äôs Canyon (17,325 acres), San Rafael Reef (60,442 acres), and Sid‚Äôs Mountain (49,130 acres).San Rafael Swell Recreation Area - BLM Cattle grazing is only allowed in parts of the Swell that are not designated as such. The San Rafael Swell is also dotted with sections of land managed by the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration, as is much of the state of Utah. Goblin Valley State Park is on the southeastern edge of the San Rafael Swell. Recreation The San Rafael Swell attracts hikers, backpackers, horseback riders, trail runners and all-terrain vehicle (ATV) enthusiasts. Many steep, narrow slot canyons popular with technical canyoneers are found in the San Rafael Reef. The Eastern Reef is a popular destination for rock climbers. It is home to some of the longest climbing routes in Utah, and is aptly nicknamed the Sandstone Alps.

It has about 66,000 inhabitants. It is the capital city of the Most District, situated between the Central Bohemian Uplands and the Ore Mountains, approximately northwest of Prague along the B√≠lina River and southwest of √öst√≠ nad Labem. Etymology The name Most means \\"bridge\\" in Czech. The town was named after the system of bridges that crossed the swamps in this area in the 10th century. The German name for Most is Br√ºx (derived from the German word for \\"bridge\\", Br√ºcke). History =Medieval period= Lookout tower of the rebuilt Hnƒõv√≠n The Latin Chronica Boemorum mentions a Slavic settlement below the Gnevin Castle called Gnevin Pons (Czech: Hnƒõv√≠nsk√Ω most) in 1040. Through the swamps there led a merchant route from Prague to Freiberg. The network of wooden bridges was built to provide comfortable passages through this territory. Hneva from the Hrabi≈°ic dynasty established a military stronghold to protect caravans. Under this stronghold, the village that would become Most developed. In 1227 Kojata, the last of the Hrabi≈°ics, passed his property to the cloister of the Knights of the Cross. Between 1238‚Äì1306 the town was part of the territory possessed by the P≈ôemyslids and it became rich with many churches. The mid-13th century saw the beginning of substantial German immigration as King Ottokar II sought to replace losses from the Mongol invasion of eastern Europe in 1241. Germans settled throughout and primarily along the northern, western, and southern borders of Bohemia, although many lived in towns like Br√ºx, where they were the majority population, throughout the kingdom. The Bohemian kings Ottokar II, John of Bohemia, and Charles IV all granted city rights to Br√ºx. In 1526 Bohemia became a part of the Austrian Habsburg monarchy, designated as Crown lands and the city became head of the Br√ºx District, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia. Following the Austria-Hungary compromise of 1867 it remained part of Austrian Bohemia.Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den √∂sterreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm Klein, 1967 During the 15th and 16th centuries, the city was hit by several fires. In circa 1530, city reconstruction began with the foundations of several significant facilities, including the new dean's church and the Renaissance city hall. During the Thirty Years' War, the city was occupied by Swedish troops. Both in the early years and in the last years of the war, it was captured by stratagem. In a similar manner the castle Hnƒõv√≠n was captured. After the Thirty Years' War, the city lost much of its economic and political significance. =19th century growth= In the second half of the 19th century, industry and mining emerged, and in 1870, a railway line was built. Construction included sugar works, porcelain factory, steel works, brewery, and the founding of a city museum. In 1895 the city was affected by quicksand that swallowed several houses, including some of their occupants. In 1900 the textile industry RICO plant was erected. In 1901, an electric tramline linked Most with Litv√≠nov's administrative parts of Kopisty and Janov u Litv√≠nova. The construction (1911‚Äì1914) of the Janov dam at K≈ô√≠≈æatky solved the city's supply of drinking water. In 1905 Most had a population of 21,500 people and the most modern theatre of its time within Austria-Hungary, built in 1910 and designed by Viennese architect Alexander Graf, was opened in Most in 1911.Baedeker, Karl, Austria-Hungary, Leipzig, 1905, p.237. =Czechoslovakia= The 1919‚Äì1920 Peace Treaties that ended World War I created a new state from the territories of the Czech lands (Bohemia, Moravia) and of Slovakia. This new confederation was called Czechoslovakia, and Most was within the borders of the new state. According to the 1930 census, there were 28,212 citizens living in Most (9,740 people of Czechoslovak ethnicity, 17,549 German, 33 Russian and 154 Jewish).Encyklopedie brann√© moci Republiky ƒåeskoslovensk√©, Ji≈ô√≠ Fidler & V√°clav Sluka Under the Munich Agreement in 1938, using the census-based V√∂lkerkarte Mitteleuropas ethnicities map of 1937, it was found that Most fell within the ethnic German-speaking zone which would become part of the Sudetenland districts to be separated from Czechoslovakia. From 1938 until 1945, the city was administered as a part of the Regierungsbezirk Aussig of Reichsgau Sudetenland. On 15 December 1942, Most began output of Ersatz fuel synthesized from lignite at the Sudetenl√§ndische Treibstoffwerke AG (STW) Maltheuren plant, and a subcamp of Sachsenhausen provided forced labor. Stalag IV-C (Wistritz bei Teplitz) was at the \\"Sudentenland Treibstoff Werke\\", and Most was repeatedly bombed during the Oil Campaign of World War II. In May 1945 Most was restored to Czechoslovakia. Shortly afterwards, the German population was expelled. The city was renamed to its Czech language name of Most, and a degree of resettlement by Czechs took place. =Destruction & redevelopment= In 1964, the Most Coal Company began the demolition of the historical old town of Most in order to make room for the expanding lignite mines in the area. Financed and led by the Communist government of Czechoslovakia, the company pulled down the town's historic buildings including a brewery dating from the 15th century and the 1910 theatre. New low-cost, standardized, multifamily housing projects were built (panel√°ky, in reference to the precast concrete panels from which they were made). In the summer of 1968, an American film company shot scenes for the war film The Bridge at Remagen in the town; the clearance work providing realistic looking war-damaged properties. The demolition work ended in 1970. Although the old town was flattened, the Communist authorities decided to preserve the Gothic Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. The entire building, which was built between 1517 and 1594 and designed by Jakob Heilmann of Schweinfurt, was moved by train to the newly constructed town 2,759 feet [841 meters] away. The move took 28 days to complete at the rate of roughly 98 feet [30 meters] per day. The Czechoslovak government took pride in the relocation of this religious structure, and the building was mentioned in the Guinness Book of World Records as the heaviest building ever moved on wheels. Today most Czechs consider the decision to demolish Most as a destruction of Bohemian history and culture. Nevertheless, the redevelopment of the new town opened a new industrial era and opportunities in the area. Labor mobility drew skilled and unskilled labor to the mining and construction sectors in Most making it one of the busiest regions in Czechoslovakia. Economy Most lies at the heart of the northern Bohemian lignite-mining region and serves as an important industrial railway junction. During the latter half of the 20th century, Most was considered to be one of the most polluted coal mining towns in communist Czechoslovakia. Most's other industries includes textile, ceramics, steel, and chemicals. Foreign mining operations continue to operate in the area in the 21st century. Some surrounding villages are planned to be abandoned due to surface mining. However environmental conditions have improved in recent years around Most, in particular the growing of apples and grape vines has developed. Tourism As a redeveloped city, Most does not have many historical sights, yet there are two important ones: Hnƒõv√≠n Castle and the Gothic Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. On the other hand, there are many amusement facilities which can be visited: planetarium, observatory, autodrome, aquadrome or hippodrome.The city of Most viewed from Hnƒõv√≠n Culture The Hippodromo (Racecourse) in the Velebudice district of Most was the host of the 18th International Meeting of 2CV Friends between 28 July and 2 August 2009, attracting 3,333 vehicles and approximately 10,000 people. Districts * The neighborhood of Rudolice nad B√≠linou is home to the Ch√°nov housing estate, created during the communist era, which has become a symbol of the poverty and ghettoization of many Romani people in the Czech Republic. * Vtelno used to be a village near Most. When the new city was built near it, Vtelno became an integral part of Most. It has a church, a historical Baroque manor, and many monoliths and sculptures that have been collected during the era of demolition of villages in the region (due to coal mining).

Common themes in Southern Gothic literature include deeply flawed, disturbing or eccentric characters who may be involved in hoodoo, decayed or derelict settings, grotesque situations, and other sinister events relating to or stemming from poverty, alienation, crime, or violence.  Origins  Elements of a Gothic treatment of the South were first apparent during the ante- and post-bellum 19th century in the grotesques of Henry Clay Lewis and in the de-idealized representations of Mark Twain. The genre was consolidated, however, only in the 20th century, when dark romanticism, Southern humor, and the new literary naturalism merged in a new and powerful form of social critique. The thematic material was largely a reflection of the culture existing in the South following the collapse of the Confederacy as a consequence of the Civil War, which left a vacuum in its cultural and religious values. The resulting poverty and lingering bitterness over the issue of slavery in the region during Reconstruction exacerbated the racism, excessive violence, and religious extremism endemic to the region. The term \\"Southern Gothic\\" was originally pejorative and dismissive. Ellen Glasgow used the term in this way when she referred to the writings of Erskine Caldwell and William Faulkner. She included the authors in what she called the \\"Southern Gothic School\\" in 1935, stating that their work was filled with \\"aimless violence\\" and \\"fantastic nightmares.\\" It was so negatively viewed at first that Eudora Welty said, \\"They better not call me that!\\"  Characteristics  The Southern Gothic style employs macabre, ironic events to examine the values of the American South. Thus unlike its parent genre, it uses the Gothic tools not solely for the sake of suspense, but to explore social issues and reveal the cultural character of the American South ‚Äì Gothic elements often taking place in a magic realist context rather than a strictly fantastical one.Bjerre, T. (2017, June 28). Southern Gothic Literature. Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Literature. Warped rural communities replaced the sinister plantations of an earlier age; and in the works of leading figures such as William Faulkner, Carson McCullers and Flannery O'Connor, the representation of the South blossomed into an absurdist critique of modernity as a whole. There are many characteristics in Southern Gothic Literature that relate back to its parent genre of American Gothic and even to European Gothic. However, the setting of these works is distinctly Southern. Some of these characteristics are exploring madness, decay and despair, continuing pressures of the past upon the present, particularly with the lost ideals of a dispossessed Southern aristocracy and continued racial hostilities. Southern Gothic particularly focuses on the South's history of slavery, racism, fear of the outside world, violence, a \\"fixation with the grotesque, and a tension between realistic and supernatural elements\\". Similar to the elements of the Gothic castle, Southern Gothic gives us the decay of the plantation in the post-Civil War South. Villains who disguise themselves as innocents or victims are often found in Southern Gothic Literature, especially stories by Flannery O'Connor, such as Good Country People and The Life You Save May Be Your Own, giving us a blurred line between victim and villain. Southern Gothic literature set out to expose the myth of old antebellum South, and its narrative of an idyllic past hidden by social, familial, and racial denials and suppressions.

The genre shares thematic connections with the Southern Gothic genre of literature, and indeed the parameters of what makes something Gothic Americana appears to have more in common with literary genres than traditional musical ones. Songs often examine poverty, criminal behavior, religious imagery, death, ghosts, family, lost love, alcohol, murder, the devil and betrayal.  Photographic representation  The images of Great Depression photographer Walker Evans are frequently seen to evoke the visual depiction of the Southern Gothic; Evans claimed: \\"I can understand why Southerners are haunted by their own landscape\\". Another noted Southern Gothic photographer was surrealist, Clarence John Laughlin, who photographed cemeteries, plantations, and other abandoned places throughout the American South (primarily Louisiana) for nearly 40 years.  Postmodern pastiche  William Gibson took an ironic look at the cult of \\"Southernness\\" in his novel Virtual Light. Rydell, the stolid, southern antihero, is looking for a job at an LA shop called Nightmare Folk Art‚ÄîSouthern Gothic. The (northern) owner says he finds Rydell unsuitable: \\"What we offer people here is a certain vision, Mr. Rydell. A certain darkness as well. A Gothic quality....The Mind of the South. A fever dream of sensuality\\". Put out by finding himself not southern enough for this New Englander, \\"'Lady,' Rydell said carefully, 'I think you're crazier than a sack full of assholes.' Her eyebrows shot up. 'There,' she said. 'There what?' 'Color, Mr. Rydell. Fire. The brooding verbal polychromes of an almost unthinkably advanced decay.'\\"  See also   References   External links  * The Southern Literary Trail website features the major fiction writers from the South during the 20th Century Category:American literature Category:Southern United States literature Category:Culture of the Southern United States Category:Gothic fiction Category:Horror genres Category:Speculative fiction ","title":"Southern Gothic"},{"id":"858750","title":"Bang Sao Thong District"},{"id":"858755","text":"Lewisport may refer to: *Lewisport, Kentucky *Lewisporte, Newfoundland and Labrador *Lewisport, Virginia, early name of what is now West Union, West Virginia ","title":"Lewisport"},{"id":"858756","text":"Melbourne street art of a stereotypical male bogan.

Bogan ( ) is Australian and New Zealand slang for a person whose speech, clothing, attitude and behaviour are considered unrefined or unsophisticated. Depending on the context, the term can be pejorative or self-deprecating.> The prevalence of the term bogan has also been associated with changing social attitudes towards social class in Australia. Since the 1980s, the bogan has become a very well-recognised subculture, often as an example of bad taste. It has antecedents in the Australian larrikin and ocker, and various localised names exist that describe the same or very similar people to the bogan.Moore, Bruce: Of Boondies, Belgium Sausages and Boguns, (archive of dead link ) Ozwords (Australian National University), November 1998. Etymology The origin of the term bogan is unclear; both the Macquarie Dictionary and the Australian Oxford Dictionary cite the origin as unknown. Some Sydney residents' recollection is that the term is based on the concept that residents of the western suburbs (stereotyped as \\"Westies\\") displayed what are now termed \\"bogan\\" characteristics and that an individual who displayed these characteristics to a strong extent was as \\"west\\" as the Bogan River in western New South Wales. According to another anecdote, the term emerged in Melbourne's outer-western and outer-eastern suburbs in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The term became widely known in the late 1980s when the teenage character Kylie Mole (played by Mary-Anne Fahey), in the Australian sketch comedy television series The Comedy Company, frequently used the term to disparage anyone she disliked. The same program included a sketch about a magazine called Bogue (a parody of Vogue), which featured traditional bogans. Merrick and Rosso (from Melbourne) also used the term on their Triple J national radio show. The Australian National Dictionary Centre (ANDC) included the word in its Australian dictionary project in 1991 and said the earliest use they found was in the September 1985 issue of surfing magazine Tracks: \\"So what if I have a Mohawk and wear Dr. Martens (boots for all you uninformed bogans)?\\" In 2019, Bruce Moore of the Australian National University published a piece in The Conversation, in which he suggested an earlier usage or origin of the word, discovered by historian Helen Doyle: an article in a student magazine published at Melbourne's Xavier College in 1984, which describes a fictional toy‚Äîthe \\"bogan doll\\"‚Äîwhich possesses many characteristics of the bogan stereotype. There are places in western New South Wales that contain bogan in their name‚Äîfor example Bogan Shire, the Bogan River and the rural village of Bogan Gate. Bogan Gate, for example, is derived from the local Aboriginal word meaning \\"the birthplace of a notable headman of the local tribe\\". Residents of streets such as Bogan Place and Bogan Road have been moved to action by the negative connotations of their street names and lobbied to rename them, prompting Ku-ring-gai mayor Nick Ebbeck to joke that he was a bit of a bogan himself. The 1902 poem \\"City of Dreadful Thirst\\" by Australian poet Banjo Paterson makes reference to a \\"Bogan shower\\" as a term meaning \\"three raindrops and some dust\\", although this is likely a reference to the dry area around the Bogan River. Makeshift gates in a rural fence in northwest NSW were known as bogan gates at least as early as the 1960s.  Concept  Some features regularly associated with the bogan stereotype include residing in the outer working class suburbs of larger cities, having teeth that have not had dental care due to cost, having an anti-authoritarian or jingoistic stance, as well as being interested in classic rock music, hoon-driving and excessive alcohol consumption. Certain types of clothing are stereotypically associated with bogans, including flannelette shirts, blue singlets, Stubbie shorts, Fluro workwear, Ugg boots, jeans and black leggings. Vehicles, such as earlier Holdens from FJ to HQ, Toranas, some Commodores, (more so sports variants, especially Peter Brock Commodores), SS models, HSV, and Ford Falcon right up to AU models, particularly modified or poorly-maintained examples, also have similar associations. A person described as a bogan may refuse to conform to middle-class standards of taste, dietary habits, leisure activities, styles of dress and ways of speaking, and might be looked down upon by some groups due to preconceived perceptions and biases which can often exacerbate the hardships faced by disadvantaged people. Mel Campbell argued in a 2006 article in The Sydney Morning Herald that bogan (including \\"cashed-up bogan\\") is a nebulous, personal concept that is frequently used in a process by which \\"we use the idea of the bogan to quarantine ideas of Australianness that alarm or discomfort us. It's a way of erecting imaginary cultural barriers between 'us' and 'them'.\\" Campbell argues that though many people believe they know exactly what a bogan is and what their characteristics might be, there is no defined set of characteristics of a bogan: the speaker imagines the denoted person to be different from, and less cultured than, themselves. Campbell considered \\"cashed-up bogan\\" to be a \\"stupid term\\". A similar argument is made by David Nichols, author of The Bogan Delusion (2011), who says that people have \\"created this creature that is a lesser human being to express their interclass hatred\\".Chris Johnston, Class war festers in hated bogan zeroes, The Age, 4 June 2011. See also The Bogan Delusion, Affirm Press  Non-pejorative usage  By the turn of the third millennium, the term bogan came to be employed more favourably to indicate a pride in being rough around the edges. In 2002, Michelle Griffin discussed the fact that \\"bogan\\" is no longer just being used as an insult, but is in fact a way to identify with the \\"Aussie\\" culture that many Anglo‚ÄêSaxon Australian citizens are proud of. In the past, bogan was a term of disdain, but nowadays it has become \\"cool\\" to be a bogan. Radio station Triple J held a \\"National Bogan Day\\" on 28 June 2002, which they commemorated by playing music by rock bands such as Cold Chisel, Midnight Oil, Rose Tattoo and AC/DC.Griffin, Michelle: Bogansville: meet the new in-crowd, The Age, 16 July 2002. In a 2011 study, linguistics students at the University of Auckland found that the term was likely to be thought of as positive by people under the age of 30, compared with over-30s who generally felt it was more of a negative term. Representation =Television= The typical bogan has been portrayed on television in shows such as Outrageous Fortune, Bogan Hunters, Pizza, Housos, Bogan Pride, Kath & Kim, and Upper Middle Bogan. Peter (pronounced 'Poi-da') was a recurring bogan character played by Eric Bana on the comedy sketch show Full Frontal. =Film= In the 2016 film Suicide Squad, DC Comics villain Captain Boomerang‚Äîa classically Australian character‚Äîis depicted as having a bogan-esque personality. =Internet= The popular website (and 2010 bestselling book) Things Bogans Like contains 250 articles on various things that bogans are claimed to like, and suggests that a \\"bogan today defies income, class, race, creed, gender and logic\\". In 2007 Microsoft deemed bogan to be one of twenty colloquialisms most relevant to Australian users when the word was added to the dictionary of Microsoft Office 2007.Press release: Strewth! Microsoft Office 2007 will recognise more dinky-di words, Microsoft Corporation, 15 May 2006. The word entered the Oxford English Dictionary in June 2012. The word bogan attracts negative attention online towards Anglo- Australians, and consequently boganbroadcast is actively campaigning to reclaim the term in a positive way. =Apps= An app known as \\"The Bogan Test\\" has been created to examine a person's likelihood to fall within the boundaries of the bogan category. =Music= Australian ska-punk band Area-7 achieved one of their biggest hits with the song \\"Nobody Likes A Bogan\\", released in 2002. Ben Folds included the lyric \\"Now I see the Bogans at the motor race\\" in his song \\"Adelaide\\" from his 'Super D' EP, released in 2004. Use in marketing \\"CUB\\" or \\"cashed up bogan\\", was used by one marketing researcher in 2006 to describe people of a blue collar background now earning a high salary and spending their earnings on expensive consumer items as a matter of conspicuous consumption. The media have cited tennis player Lleyton Hewitt and his actress wife, Bec Cartwright, as examples. Subsequently, the Kaesler Winery, in the Barossa Valley, released a Shiraz wine under the name Bogan. Regional equivalent terms The Courier-Mail described \\"bogan\\" as peerless, and that it warrants acceptance as an Australian keyword. It also wrote \\"There are plenty of other words purporting to describe the same social and cultural subset or behaviour, but 'bogan' really does stand alone\\". Although the term \\"bogan\\" is understood across Australia and New Zealand, certain regions have their own slang terms for the same group of people. These terms include: * \\"Bevan\\" or \\"Bev\\" in Queensland. * \\"Booner\\" in Canberra. * \\"Chigger\\" (also \\"chigga\\" or \\"chig\\") in Tasmania. This appears to be a reference to the Hobart suburb of Chigwell. * \\"Scozza\\" in Geelong, Victoria, Australia. \\"Westie\\" or \\"westy\\" is not synonymous with bogan, although westies are often stereotyped as being bogans. \\"Westie\\" predates bogan, originating in Sydney in the 1970s to refer to people from that city's western suburbs. As Sydney's western suburbs are predominantly working class blue collar areas, the term connotes a predominantly working class blue collar person ‚Äì someone with little education, little taste, and very limited horizons. \\"Westie\\" is now in wide use in many cities and towns across both Australia and New Zealand, where it especially refers to the denizens of West Auckland.

Its main effect was to abolish the six county councils of the metropolitan counties that had been set up in 1974, 11 years earlier, by the Local Government Act 1972, along with the Greater London Council that had been established in 1965. In their place many single purpose authorities known collectively as 'joint authorities' were established for fire service, police and passenger transport. An ad hoc education authority was established for Inner London and a planning authority for Greater London. The legislation permitted councils to form 'joint arrangements' for waste disposal and other services that they wished to provide together. Time-limited residuary bodies were created to dispose of the assets of the former authorities. Background Following the victory of the Conservative Party at the 1979 general election, Margaret Thatcher's government were involved in a series of high-profile disputes with the GLC and Metropolitan County Councils. All of the authorities were controlled by, or came under the control of the opposition Labour Party during Thatcher's first term. The Conservative manifesto for the 1983 general election pledged their abolition, describing the councils as \\"a wasteful and unnecessary tier of government\\". Having won a landslide victory in the 1983 General Election, the government published a white paper in October of that year, Streamlining the cities. Its proposals formed the basis of the Local Government Bill. Provisions The core provision, section 1, stated that \\"the Greater London Council; and the metropolitan county councils\\" shall cease to exist. It came into effect on 1 April 1986, with some powers being devolved to the metropolitan boroughs themselves and London boroughs and others to joint authorities (such as for fire or police purposes) consisting of members of each of the metropolitan district councils within each county. At the time of the Act, one third of the population of England were living in Greater London and the metropolitan counties.Hampton, W., Local Government and Urban Politics, (1991) Time-limited residuary bodies were created to handle the disposal of the councils' assets. Part III of the Act also set up the Inner London Education Authority, which had previously been a committee of the GLC responsible for education in Inner London, as a directly elected body. This was to remain in existence for only three years. The Local Government Act 1972 allowed councils to voluntarily form joint committees to provide services together and the Local Government Act 1985 extended this principle by directing local authorities to form some shared arrangements whilst permitting them to form others as they wished. =Local authorities abolished by Part I= Six metropolitan county councils were abolished and the local authority of Greater London. *Greater London Council *Greater Manchester County Council *Merseyside County Council *South Yorkshire County Council *Tyne and Wear County Council *West Midlands County Council *West Yorkshire County Council =Joint committees established by Part II= *Joint planning committee for Greater London *Greater Manchester Trading Standards Joint Committee *Merseyside County Trading Standards Joint Committee *South Yorkshire Trading Standards Joint Committee *Tyne and Wear Trading Standards Joint Committee *West Midlands Trading Standards Joint Committee *West Yorkshire Trading Standards Joint Committee =Joint arrangements established by Part II= *East London Waste Authority *Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority *Merseyside Waste Disposal Authority *North London Waste Authority *Western Riverside Waste Authority *West London Waste Authority =Ad hoc authorities established by Part III= *Inner London Education Authority Note: The outer London borough councils and metropolitan district councils were already education authorities. =Joint authorities established by Part IV= A number of single purpose authorities were established, collectively known as joint authorities in the legislation. ;Fire and civil defence authorities *Greater Manchester Fire and Civil Defence Authority *London Fire and Civil Defence Authority *Merseyside Fire and Civil Defence Authority *South Yorkshire Fire and Civil Defence Authority *Tyne and Wear Fire and Civil Defence Authority *West Midlands Fire and Civil Defence Authority *West Yorkshire Fire and Civil Defence Authority ;Passenger transport authorities *Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Authority *Merseyside Passenger Transport Authority *South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority *Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Authority *West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority *West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority Note: London Regional Transport was established separately by the London Regional Transport Act 1984. ;Police authorities *Greater Manchester Police Authority *Merseyside Police Authority *Northumbria Police Authority *South Yorkshire Police Authority *West Midlands Police Authority *West Yorkshire Police Authority Note: The Metropolitan Police was under the control of the Home Office and unaffected by the legislation. =Ad hoc bodies established by Part V= *London Boroughs Grants Committee =Residuary bodies established by Part VII= *Greater Manchester Residuary Body *London Residuary Body *Merseyside Residuary Body *South Yorkshire Residuary Body *Tyne and Wear Residuary Body *West Midlands Residuary Body *West Yorkshire Residuary Body =Ad hoc bodies established by Part IX= *London Research Centre References Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1985 Category:Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom concerning England Category:Local government legislation in England and Wales ","title":"Local Government Act 1985"},{"id":"858767","text":"Thomas Fasti Dinesen (9 August 1892 ‚Äì 10 March 1979Gravsted.dk: Thomas Fasti Dinesen ) was a Danish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the younger brother of the author Karen Blixen (who used the pen name Isak Dinesen). Details He was born in an affluent and landed (but bourgeois rather than aristocratic) family in Rungsted, Denmark. Following the outbreak of the First World War, Dinesen attempted to enlist in the British, French, and United States armies, before finally being accepted by the Canadian Corps in 1917. He enlisted in the 236th Battalion (New Brunswick Kilties), CEF before transferring to the 42nd Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force:Bird, Will R, Ghosts Have Warm Hands, CEF Books, Ottawa, 2002, p. 139 the Royal Highlander Regiment, known as the Black Watch of Canada. The MacLean Kilties were the 236th Canadian Battalion, recruited in Nova Scotia. It reached England in 1917 and was broken up for reinforcements.Bird, Will R, Ghosts Have Warm Hands, CEF Books, Ottawa, 2002, p. 75 During the Battle of Amiens he was 26 years old, and a private in the 42nd Quebec Regiment (Royal Highlanders of Canada) Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force when, on 12 August 1918 at Parvillers, France, he displayed conspicuous bravery when, five times in succession, he rushed forward alone against entrenched enemy troops and put hostile guns out of action. He was credited with killing 12 of the enemy using both bayonet and grenade, and with inspiring his comrades at a very critical stage of the action. For this action, Dinesen was awarded the Victoria Cross (or VC). He also received the French Croix de guerre Thurman, Judith Isak Dinesen: The Life of a Storyteller, St. Martin's Press, 1982, p. 141 His name appears on the List of Canadian Victoria Cross recipients. He was commissioned.Messenger, Charles, The day we won the war, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, 2008 p.68 and later achieved the rank of lieutenant. On 7 August 1918, whilst waiting to go into action, Dinesen wrote of his night in Gentelles Wood: 'All day long we rested in this pleasant spot - we even had permission to make a little fire here and there under a thickly branched tree and do a bit of cooking. The regular meals are good and plentiful, of course, but we never miss a chance of eating unlimited quantities of extra food. The last tin of baked beans was opened - there's no reason to go into battle with a haversack heavier than was absolutely necessary! We washed and shaved carefully in order to look our best before Fritz ... Our equipment was inspected for the last time: Gas-masks, rifles, ammunition, shaving kit, iron rations - everything was OK. Some of us were presented with an extra gift - mine was a big and heavy bag containing a dozen or so Mills bombs! Just before sunset we had to fall in for a final parade. Then supper - and at l0pm we were again fighting our way through the throng on the Amiens - Roye road.' Dinesen, Thomas, VC, A Dane with the Canadians, Jarrolds, London, 1930 pp. 214-215 (republished by Naval and Military Press), quoted in Messenger, Charles, The day we won the war, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, 2008 p.68 Thomas's sister, the famous Danish author Karen, (whom he, and most of their Danish friends, called \\"Tanne\\") later wrote that her brother's bravery, and the recognition from the British Crown, in some measure saved her own reputation in the community of British colonials among whom she lived in British East Africa. According to Blixen, she had inadvertently alienated many of her neighbors by helping to buy horses for a German officer she met on board ship while sailing to Kenya for the first time. Only months later this officer, General Paul Emil von Lettow- Vorbeck, was named commander of the German forces in East Africa, and waged an effective campaign against Blixen's English neighbors. Blixen commented that the suspicion and resentment this aroused in her fellow colonists only subsided after her brother won the VC.Letter by Karen Blixen, Ngong in Kenya 13 December 1918 published in \\"Breve far Afrika\\" 1978 Life after the war In 1918, Thomas Dinesen moved to British East Africa to help his sister manage her coffee farm in the Ngong hills southwest of Nairobi. He was his mercurial sister's most reliable confidant.Thurman, Isak Dinesen: The Life of a Storyteller pp. 165‚Äì166 He designed and largely built the farm's coffee- roasting plant (which later burned down). Early in 1923, Thomas left the colonial life and returned to Denmark. In his later years he took up writing, and wrote a number of books in Danish. The best known is Tanne, about his famous sister. In 1929 he published the book No man's land: En dansker med canadierne ved vestfronten. It was translated into English in 1930 under the title Merry Hell!: A Dane with the Canadians. The book describes his troublesome way to the Western Front as well as the events that won him the VC. He died in 1979. He is buried in H√∏rsholm Churchyard, H√∏rsholm, Denmark. His VC and other medals are held in the Lord Ashcroft VC collection in the Imperial War Museum.
