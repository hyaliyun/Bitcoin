She was the daughter of George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury. Her husband, Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland, had wished to marry Anne Boleyn instead of her. Family Mary Talbot was one of the eleven children of George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury, and his first wife, Anne Hastings. Her paternal grandparents were John Talbot, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury, and Catherine Stafford, daughter of Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and Anne Neville. Her maternal grandparents were William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings, and Katherine Neville, a younger sister of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick. Marriage In January 1524, Lady Mary was forced to marry Henry Percy, heir to the earldom of Northumberland, who had fallen deeply in love with Anne Boleyn, then a lady-in-waiting to Queen Catherine of Aragon. He naturally did not wish to marry Mary. It was Cardinal Thomas Wolsey who was responsible for breaking up the affair between Henry and Anne, reminding Henry of his precontract with Mary Talbot, with whom he had been betrothed from 1516.Alison Weir, The Six Wives of Henry VIII. p.157 After Henry's father, the 5th Earl of Northumberland, was quickly summoned to the English court and apprised of the situation, he took Henry Percy home to Alnwick Castle in Northumberland. The date of the marriage is debated, with estimates made between September 1523Alison Weir, The Six Wives of Henry VIII. p.158 and August 1525 or August 1526David Starkey, Six Wives:The Queens of Henry VIII, p. xxii It seems to have been an unhappy marriage from the start. Henry succeeded his father as the 6th Earl on 19 May 1527, and Mary was henceforth styled as the Countess of Northumberland. The marriage, however, was unhappy, and they had no children. In June 1532, Mary sought an annulment, on the grounds that her husband had a precontract with Anne Boleyn.Alison Weir, The Six Wives of Henry VIII. p.234 Percy was questioned by Henry VIII and the petition was thrown out by Parliament; the Percys remained married. Mary died on 16 April 1572, Henry Percy having died many years before on 30 January 1537. In later life, though she had a grant of abbey lands from the Dissolution of the Monasteries, she was suspect of being a Roman Catholic, a favourer of Mary Queen of Scots, and of hearing mass in her house. She was buried in Sheffield church.

Plot In 1945, after the end of World War II in Europe, Karl 'Kalle' Blücher examines the ruins of the cigarette factory where he worked in the city of Dresden. The other workers tell him they need carbide to replace the destroyed roof. They assign him the job of getting it, as he has a brother-in-law in Wittenberge who works at a carbide company. Also, they are all married and have to look after their families, while he is single and a vegetarian, so he should be better able to feed himself along the way. Karl walks to Wittenberge. His brother-in-law gives him seven barrels, but cannot help him with their transportation. His return to Dresden turns into a long chain of comical incidents. First, a good-looking war widow named Karla invites him to put the barrels on her wagon and takes him a short distance to her farmhouse, where he spends the night and they become romantically entwined. He promises to return after he makes his delivery. Next, he hitches a ride on a truck in exchange for his cigarettes. While waiting for another ride, he hunts mushrooms in the nearby forest, unaware that the woods have been mined until an old man warns him. A second truck takes him further along in return for his cooked mushrooms. Finding a seemingly empty barn, he takes a nap in the loft. Soviet soldiers find him (and a hidden cache of Nazi food), so they take him to their commandant. The sympathetic commandant believes his story and lets him go, but tells him he needs permits from Dresden and Potsdam to transport raw materials between regions. Karl instead talks the captain in charge of supplies into giving him stamped written authorization and a cart for two barrels of carbide. Later, hunger overcoming his beliefs, he decides to go fishing using carbide (which explodes when it is wet). The first barrel he opens contains chalk, but the second has carbide. The explosion, however, results in suspicious Soviet troops taking him into custody again. Back he goes to the same commandant. This time, he trades the captain one more barrel for a 30-kilometre truck ride (Karl gives him the one with chalk inside). Along the way, they pick up first a middle-aged singer, then Karin, a teenage orphan in pigtails determined to go to America. The trio then find an abandoned boat. The singer, unable to steal the boat, leaves the next morning. Karl rows the barrels and the girl (who does not want to go to Dresden) down the river. When one of the oars breaks, they end up stranded on the concrete pillar of a wrecked bridge in the middle of the river with two barrels; the boat comes loose and drifts away with the other two. Karin abandons him the next morning. Then an American soldier appears in a motorboat. He is willing to help (in exchange for a barrel), but is forbidden to go into Soviet-controlled territory, so Karl steals his boat. He later docks and encounters Clara, a middle-aged widow. She plies him with liquor, but he ends up too drunk to go to bed with her as she wants. (One of her worker tells him that he is the 13th man Clara has taken in.) Two German ex-soldiers show up and are put to work gardening. Karl fixes some machinery in a sawmill. One of the soldiers sleeps with Clara. Early the next morning, the pair steal Karl's barrels, but he wakes up in time to drive them off. He is next given a ride by an undertaker in exchange for a eulogy. Taking a nap in the empty coffin, he terrifies a later hitchhiker when he emerges from it. At the funeral, they discover that the dead man was despised when the \\"mourners\\" slip quickly away. At a black market, he tries to exchange transportation for a barrel, but is instead arrested. He escapes and is recaptured; fortunately, the man in charge believes he is working for the Soviet occupiers and lets him go. Finally, after six weeks, he returns to the factory with two barrels of carbide. He finds letters from Karla there. Karl borrows a bicycle and starts back to Dresden.

Under Australia's federal system, transport policy and regulatory responsibilities span across Commonwealth, state and territory, and local governments. Differences between these regulatory systems mean that national transport operators can face inconsistent regulations, creating unnecessary inefficiency and cost. The NTC is focused on reforms which improve the productivity, safety and environmental outcomes of the Australian transport system . This has subsequently led to the development of transport regulatory policies such as Performance-Based Standards, Heavy Vehicle Driver Fatigue Reform and the Chain of Responsibility. The NTC also plays a role in implementation planning to ensure reform outcomes are relevant and effective, as well as coordinating, monitoring, evaluating and maintaining the implementation of approved reforms. Recommendations and advice are presented to the Standing Council on Transport and Infrastructure (SCOTI) - comprising transport, infrastructure and planning ministers - for approval by majority vote. Based in Melbourne, Victoria, the NTC has six commissioners including a Chief Executive. Dr Gillian Miles was appointed Chief Executive Officer in 2019. History =Hughes & Vale case= Australia is a federation that relies on the Constitution to divide power between the Commonwealth (federal) government and the six original States (see federalism in Australia). As the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act did not specify Federal control over road transport, it effectively relinquished full jurisdiction of that area to the States. In 1952, truck drivers were frustrated by the levies on interstate road transport, which were designed to protect the state-owned railways. They placed a copy of the constitution in a barrow and pushed it by hand between Melbourne and Sydney. This journey took 11 days, 2 days quicker than a parcel mailed at the same time and carried by rail. Their purpose was to challenge the validity of the New South Wales State Transport Act against \\"Section 92 of the Constitution which provides that trade, commerce and intercourse between the States shall be absolutely free\\". Known as the Hughes & Vale case, they eventually led a successful constitutional challenge in the High Court which opened-up the development of interstate road transport and Australia in general. Hughes & Vale was a significant turning point for the transport industry in Australia. It was the catalyst for the growth of interstate road transport, which in turn highlighted the limitations of having different road transport regulations between states. =Razorback Blockade= In 1979, 3000 truck drivers staged blockages of major highways at nearly 40 locations in Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia to protest against ton-mile taxes and low freight rates. Known as the Razorback Blockade (for a blockage of the Hume Highway at the top of Razorback Mountain, near Picton, New South Wales) truck drivers involved claimed higher charges made them financially worse off. Their efforts were not in vain and ton-mile tax was abolished shortly after the protests. Apart from charging woes, there was also a demand for a list of reforms such as the establishment of advisory bodies to solve problems in the industry, equal pay for all drivers, licensing to control the number of trucks in the industry and uniform weight and speed limits to be implemented. =Establishment of the National Road Transport Commission= Both the Hughes & Vale case and the Razorback blockade were contributing factors to the recommendation in the last report of the Inter- State Commission (ISC) proposing significant changes be made for all vehicle charges, and that a National Commission be created. At the time, microeconomic reform was a central policy of the Labor Commonwealth government. The cooperation of all six States and two Territories was needed as many of its high priority agendas such as transport, and electricity generation and distribution were State governed. The assembly of leaders at the Special Premiers Conference in 1991, including the notable support of Premier Nick Greiner of New South Wales, a non-Labor Government, gave bipartisan support to the reform process. In 1991, the National Road Transport Commission was formally established by an inter-governmental agreement. 2002 review Under its enabling legislation, the NTC's role and performance must be reviewed every six years by independent steering committee. The 2002 review of the National Road Transport Commission Act recommended that the NRTC's role be expanded to include rail and intermodal transport to encourage a more holistic approach to land transport reforms. Rail transport regulations in Australia are also governed by States and Territories and, like road transport, culminated in a number of inconsistencies across the nation. It was noted rail transport system in Australia was ready for a more formal process of reform parallel to that of road transport and that operators and track owners on the national road network needed consistent processes for safety regulation. High priority issues targeted for rail regulatory reform included the establishment of a framework to improve and strengthen the co-regulatory system including application of mutual recognition, and the development of a national policy on key safety issues such as fatigue, testing for drugs and alcohol and medical fitness of safety-critical rail workers. In 2004, the National Road Transport Commission was formally renamed the National Transport Commission to accommodate the inclusion of rail and intermodal transport into its existing mandate. Consequently, the existing National Road Transport Commission Act 1991 was replaced by the National Transport Commission Act 2003. =The National Transport Advisory Council (NTAC)= Also included in the 2002 review of the NRTC was a recommendation for the creation of a non-statutory body called the National Transport Advisory Council (NTAC). The proposed function of NTAC was to conduct strategic analyses and give advice to the ATC on strategic priorities for national infrastructure investment, options for pricing of access to road, rail and other transport infrastructure and directions and priorities for modal integration relevant to national freight issues. The long term intention was for functions of the NTAC to be transferred through to the National Transport Commission after three years if agreed upon unanimously by the ATC. Despite the recommendation, NTAC was never implemented. 2009 review A steering committee was appointed in January 2009 to conduct the NTC's most recent review and delivered its final report to the Chair of the Australian Transport Council (ATC, the predecessor to SCOTI) in August 2009. The Coalition of Australian Governments (COAG) and the ATC endorsed the recommendations in December 2009. Key recommendations which were endorsed included: *Explicitly expanding the NTC's mandate to include working with jurisdictions to develop viable implementation plans *Monitoring and evaluating national reform outcomes using a broader range of tools, including data collection, post-implementation research and effectiveness reviews *Focusing on priority projects set by the ATC and regularly reporting on project progress *The NTC Commissioners to be appointed as a governing board under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. Effectiveness The work of the NTC has attracted support and criticism since its establishment. The commission's early projects led to major gains in many areas of road transport, particularly in the heavy vehicle sector. Widely praised early reforms delivered included charges, registration, dangerous goods, licensing, vehicle standards and mass and access. The delivery of the Australian Road Rules in 1999 represented a major reform initiative touching both the light and heavy vehicle sectors. The commission's recent work in the rail safety area, however, has been the subject of concern among some Governments and other stakeholders. While support was obtained for NTC's efforts in securing State and Territory approval for a model Rail Safety statute for Australia based on existing regulation, later work in developing operative legislation in the same field has been criticised based on concern about insufficient analysis. Concerns have also been expressed about inconsistent drug and blood alcohol standards across the country. Current reform projects Some of the reform projects currently being undertaken by the NTC include: *National Heavy Vehicle Regulator – In July 2009, COAG agreed to establish an independent National Heavy Vehicle Regulator which will administer a national system of laws for heavy vehicles with a gross vehicle mass of over 4.5 tonnes. Located in Brisbane, Queensland the regulator and laws are to come into effect by 1 January 2013. The NTC is undertaking the legislation work stream for the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator project. This involves consolidating existing legislation, resolving outstanding policy issues to support the establishment of the new regulators and finalising the Heavy Vehicle National Law. *National Rail Safety Regulator - Australia currently has seven rail safety regulators administering an agreed national law with state variations. In 2009, COAG approved the establishment of a single to deliver improved safety outcomes, reduce the regulatory burden on industry and increasing cost-effectiveness for governments. NTC is undertaking the legislation workstream of the project, which is focused on consolidating existing law for inclusion in the new national legislation. *COAG Road Reform Plan - The COAG Road Reform Plan was established by the Coalition of Australian Governments (COAG) to undertake a feasibility study investigating alternative charging systems for heavy vehicles. The NTC is contributing to the feasibility study that may result in changes to Australia's current heavy vehicle charging scheme. A range of alternative charging models are being considered, aimed at better aligning the road prices charged with the actual costs imposed by a vehicle on the roads (based on the mass carried, distance travelled and types of roads used). *National Ports Strategy – Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd requested that Infrastructure Australia and the NTC develop a National Ports Strategy. The strategy which aims to drive a coordinated approach from all levels of government to planning for ports and their road and rail links, in the face of growing freight demand. *Modular B-triples - B-triples, which comprise a prime mover and three semi-trailers, operate almost Australia-wide. However, their uptake is currently hindered by inconsistent road access and operating conditions across state and territory borders. The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) directed the NTC to develop a national framework for modular B-triple operations to provide wider and more consistent B-triple access across the country. *Performance Based Standards – The NTC developed the Performance Based Standards scheme, in which heavy vehicles do not subscribe to the traditional 'prescriptive' regulations regarding length and mass and are specifically designed to perform a certain task as productively as possible. PBS vehicles need to meet 16 minimum vehicle 'performance' standards to ensure they are stable on the road and can turn and stop safely. The scheme has been in operation within state and territory roads authorities since October 2007. The NTC is currently working on improvements to the scheme which are designed to improve national consistency and certainty of access for industry.

Resazurin has a blue to purple color (at pH > 6.5) and is used in microbiological, cellular, and enzymatic assays because it can be irreversibly reduced to the pink-colored and highly fluorescent resorufin (7-Hydroxy-3H-phenoxazin-3-one). At circum-neutral pH, resorufin can be detected by visual observation of its pink color or by fluorimetry, with an excitation maximum at 530-570 nm and an emission maximum at 580-590 nmChen, J. L., Steele, T. W., & Stuckey, D. C. (2015). Modeling and application of a rapid fluorescence-based assay for biotoxicity in anaerobic digestion. Environmental science & technology, 49(22), 13463-13471.http://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.5b03050. When a solution containing resorufin is submitted to reducing conditions (Eh < -110 mV), almost all resorufin is reversibly reduced to the translucid non-fluorescent dihydroresorufin (sin. hydroresorufin) and the solution becomes translucid (the redox potential of the resorufin/dihydroresorufin pair is -51 mV vs. standard hydrogen electrode at pH 7.0). When the Eh of this same solution is increased, dihydroresorufin is oxidized back to resorufin, and this reversible reaction can be used to monitor if the redox potential of a culture medium remains at a sufficiently low level for anaerobic organisms. Resazurin solution has one of the highest values known of Kreft's dichromaticity index. This means that it has a large change in perceived color hue when the thickness or concentration of observed sample increases or decreases. Usually, resazurin is available commercially as the sodium salt. Cell viability applications Resazurin is reduced to resorufin by aerobic respiration of metabolically active cells, and it can be used as an indicator of cell viability. It was first used to quantify bacterial content in milk by Pesch and Simmert in 1929. It can be used to detect the presence of viable cells in mammalian cell cultures. It was introduced commercially initially under Alamar Blue trademark (Trek Diagnostic Systems, Inc), and now also available under other names such as AB assay, Vybrant (Molecular Probes) and UptiBlue (Interchim). Resazurin based assays show excellent correlation to reference viability assays such as formazan-based assays (MTT/XTT) and tritiated thymidine based techniques.UptiBlue viable cell assay technical manual The low toxicity makes it suitable for longer studies, and it has been applied for animal cells, bacteria, and fungi for cell culture assays such as cell counting, cell survival, and cell proliferation.. To take the place of a standard live/dead assay, resazurin also be multiplexed with chemiluminescent assays, such as cytokine assays, caspase assays to measure apoptosis, or reporter assays to measure a gene or a protein expression. The irreversible reaction of resazurin to resorufin is proportional to aerobic respiration. Other applications Reduction of resazurin to resorufin, and reversible reduction of resorufin to dihydroresorufin. Resazurin is effectively reduced in mitochondria, making it useful also to assess mitochondrial metabolic activity. Usually, in the presence of NADPH dehydrogenase or NADH dehydrogenase as the enzyme, NADPH or NADH is the reductant that converts resazurin to resorufin. Hence the resazurin/diaphorase/NADPH system can be used to detect NADH, NADPH, or diaphorase level, and any biochemical or enzyme activity that is involved in a biochemical reaction generating NADH or NADPH. Resazurin can be used to assay L-Glutamate, achieving a sensitivity of 2.0 pmol per well in a 96 well plate. Resazurin can also be used to measure the aerobic biodegradation of organic matter found in effluents. Resazurin is used to measure the amount of aerobic respiration in streams Since most aerobic respiration occurs in the stream bed, the conversion of resazurin to resorufin is also a measure of the amount of exchange between the water column and the stream bed. Synthesis Resazurin is prepared by acid-catalyzed condensation between resorcinol and 4-nitrosoresorcinol followed by oxidation of the intermediate with manganese(IV) oxide: Resazurin synthesis Treatment of the crude reaction product with excess sodium carbonate yields the sodium salt of resazurin, which is typically the commercial form of the dye. Running the condensation step in alcohols is possible but results in lower yields of the product; in pure water or acetic acid, the reaction does not proceed satisfactorily. Related dyes 10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine (also known as Amplex Red), structurally related to resazurin, reacts with H2O2 in a 1:1 stoichiometry to produce the same by-product resorufin (used in many assays combining for example horseradish peroxidase (HRP), or NADH, NADPH using enzymes).Zhou, M., Diwu, Z., Panchuk-Voloshina, N., et al.

He was also Ambassador of Colombia to the United Kingdom where he tried in vain to gain recognition for the nascent nation of Colombia. Family Francisco Antonio Zea was born in Medellín on 2 November 1766, the son of Pedro Rodríguez de Zea Casafus, a Spaniard from Marchena, Seville, and María Rosalia Ignacia Díaz Peláez whose paternal family hailed from Asturias while her maternal side was a well established Criollo Paisa family. He was baptised on 23 November 1766 with the name Juan Francisco Antonio Hilarión Zea Díaz. Zea married in Madrid in 1805 to Felipa Meilhon y Montemayor, a gaditana born in 1788, daughter of Juan Antonio Meilhon, a native of Béarn, France, and Antonia Montemayor, native of Ronda, Málaga. Out of this marriage only one daughter was born, Felipa Antonia Zea Meilhon, who would later become Viscountess of Rigny after marrying Alexander Gaulthier, Viscount of Rigny, son of Henri, Count of Rigny. Zea's widow died in Madrid in 1833, and his daughter then- widow of Rigny, died on 4 September 1887 at the Château de Fougères. Early career Zea began his education in Medellín. Afterwards he travelled to the Real Colegio y Seminario de Popayán, where his distant relative José Félix de Restrepo was a professor. In the Seminary he became acquainted with other young Neogranadines who would go on to become precursors and martyrs of the independence such as Francisco José de Caldas, Camilo Torres Tenorio, Francisco Antonio Ulloa, and José María Cabal. He finished his studies in 1785, and although his father wanted him to continue his ecclesiastical studies, Zea moved the next year to Bogotá in hopes of studying jurisprudence, goal which he attained by applying and receiving a scholarship from the Colegio Mayor de San Bartolomé. He had to endure poverty and sickness, to the point that he was expelled for not being able to pay his pension. He was able to continue his studies with the help of Gabriel Muñoz, and in 1788 he became an adjunct professor of grammar and in 1789 adjunct professor of philosophy, positions which allowed him to improve his living situation. Maybe it was his love of teaching, or his need and desire for a stable income, but he decided to postpone his degree to teach full-time, degree which he never did achieve. He became renowned as a tutor to the extent that Viceroy José Manuel de Ezpeleta hired him as a private tutor for his children. = Botanist = While in the Real Colegio y Seminario de Popayán, he wrote his treatise \\"Hebephilo,\\" for the Papel Periodico inviting young men to the study of nature. Following his move to Santafé (modern-day Bogotá) to study jurisprudence, Zea made a name for himself among the intellectual circles of the city. This led to the recommendation of José Celestino Mutis for his appointment as an aggregate to the Royal Botanical Expedition to New Granada, following Mutis' retirement in 1789. Zea decided to abandon his career as a lawyer and devote to research and science following this appointment. Following his exile from New Granada, and the subsequent time he spent in a scientific mission in France, he was appointed director of the Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid upon his return to Spain in 1803. = Spanish exile = Zea was a common discussant on political matters along with other heroes of Colombian independence, many of whom like him had attended school in the Seminary in Popayán and later moved on to Santafé, like Camilo Torres, and Francisco José de Caldas. During this time he became a close friend of Antonio Nariño. While Zea spent his time in Fusagasugá devoted to his botanical studies in 1794, he was arrested along with Antonio Nariño, and many others, as he was implicated in the circulation of the\\"Droits de l'homme, and was sent with them to Spain, where he spent two years as a prisoner, first in the Castle of San Sebastián of Cadiz, and then in the city itself, and later on to Seville. Zea and his fellow prisoners were absolved in 1799, but he had to remain in Spain as he found himself impoverished. Zea appealed the conditions and reasons of his arrest, and managed to obtain royal authorization for his reinstatement to the Botanical Expedition and the payment of his missed salaries while in prison. While waiting for the reimbursement, Zea also managed to befriend the Minister of Finance in Spain, and by way of him he managed to obtain a commission to move to Paris on a scientific mission to update his knowledge and acquiring scientific equipment. Arguably, the government also desired to keep him away from New Granada. He spent about two years in Paris, devoted mostly to the study of chemistry. He also occasionally attended political meetings organized by Francisco de Miranda. On his return to Spain, in 1803, he was elected member of several Spanish scientific societies, and was appointed editor of the Mercurio de España and Semanario de Agricultura. He was also appointed director of the Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid, a very prestigious scientific position for an American, and for one who had been in jail a few years earlier. He accepted the position with the goal of writing the results of Mutis' Botanical Expedition, which he believed would improve the conditions and development of his native New Granada as well as improve the use of crops and animals from the Americas, which he believed would increase trade. While he was director of Botanical Garden he made continuous requests to be allowed to be relieved from his appointment and return to his homeland, but all of these requests were unheard, without a major explanation. Exile in France and Independence Campaign In 1808 during the Peninsular War, Napoleonic France took over Spain. Zea took the invasion as an opportunity to leave his position as director of the Botanical Garden, and declared himself an afrancesado right away. Zea's insubordination to Spain, his allegiance to France and his love of French culture and French language which he spoke fluently made him one of the few Neogranadine afrancesados of his time. Murat offered Zea and Ignacio Tejada to become representatives of the Americans. As such, Zea was one of the 85 deputies from Spain convened by order of Napoleon I of France at Bayonne, to select a new king of Spain. The new king selected was Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon's elder brother, under whose authority Zea entered Spain and who shortly afterwards named him prefect at Málaga. Zea's time as prefect did not last long however, as with the defeat of the French in 1814, Zea had to escape from Spain, moving first to London and then returning to seek refuge in France. During this period, Zea became very active in communicating with the American colonies and tried to support their independence efforts. He went to Santo Domingo in 1815 to meet Bolívar, and the two became close friends. Zea then would move to Haiti to support the independence campaign as Bolívar had found sanctuary there by the government of Alexandre Pétion. In February, 1816, Bolívar appointed him Manager of Finance of the Confederate States of New Granada and Venezuela. Pétion offered Zea to become the Minister of Agriculture of Haiti, but Zea preferred to travel to Venezuela to help with Bolívar's independence campaign. Zea became one of Bolívar's closest advisors, and accompanied him to the conquest of Angostura in July, 1817. Once installed in Angostura, Zea created what would become the official newspaper of the new government called Correo del Orinoco (Orinoco's Mail). Zea had little role in the military efforts, but his vast knowledge, political skill, oratory skills and even his masonic link to Bolívar allowed him to become Bolívar's close advisor, and to be appointed to a number of positions in the political course of the new government. He was appointed Manager (February, 1816), Member of the Provisional Junta of government (May, 1817), President of the Court for the seizure of the goods of the supporters of the king (September, 1817), President of State and Finance (November, 1817), Deputy to the Congress (February, 1819), President of Congress (February, 1819), and following the liberation of New Granada, as Vice-President of the Republic (December, 1819), and finally, Plenipotentiary Minister in the Exterior (December, 1819). Founding of Colombia =President of Congress= House of the Congress of Angostura In 1819 Zea took part in what would be known as the Congress of Angostura, a legislative body gathered by Simon Bolivar in the city of Angostura in Venezuela, where delegates from Venezuela provinces and the Casanare province of New Granada planned to charter the course for the new liberated nation of the Gran Colombia. When the congress first convened on 15 February 1819, Zea, as delegate for Caracas was elected President of the Congress of Venezuela and Diego de Vallenilla Arana its Deputy Secretary. This meant that while congress deliberated on the future political composition of the nation and elected its leaders, Zea was both the chief executive officer and the chief legislative officer. The signs of internal division began showing soon after as Venezuelans did not want to be ruled by a Neogranadine for they thought of themselves as independent of the new nation, in the end it proved too much as Zea was confronted with a lot of opposition from the Venezuelan armed forces who did not want to be commanded by a civilian, let alone a Neogranadine forcing Zea to step down on 7 September 1819, however he remained a member of congress. =Vice President= Carlos Soublette, Pedro Briceño Méndez, Francisco Antonio Zea, Gregor MacGregor and Luis Brión in Ocumare. 19th century illustration by Carmelo Fernández. On 17 December 1819, the Congress of Angostura passed the Constitution of 1819 which officially created the First Republic of Colombia, a country made of 3 departments: Venezuela, Cundinamarca, and Quito. Congress also elected Simón Bolívar the First President of Colombia, and Zea as the First Vice President of Colombia, it also elected individual Vice presidents for the departments, Juan Germán Roscio as Vice President of Venezuela, and Francisco de Paula Santander as Vice President of Cundinamarca, the office of Vice President of Quito was left vacant as the Royal Audience of Quito was still under Spanish rule. =Diplomat= Lithograph by Rudolph Ackermann of His Excellency Ambassador Zea with the following extract of his letter inscribed. ::\\"Whoever will approach Colombia with pacific benevolent intentions, may draw in full security from the common source of our riches. Such is the single basis which we are desirous to have with all the people of the earth cordiality, liberty, reciprocity. The jealousies and distrusts which were formally such fruitful sources of mischief are banished from the legislation as well as from the spirit of our fellow citizens. We will never falsify the philanthropic principles for which blood has flowed in such abundance on the field of battle & on the scaffold... Colombia derives her rights for no one. The author of her own strength, she relies upon her own means alone to maintain herself independent, powerful, free and invulnerable.\\" – Extract from Mr. Zea's note to the Ambassadors of the different European Powers at Paris. 8 April 1822. As Plenipotentiary Minister in the Exterior, Zea was tasked with obtaining financial help from the British, as well as restoring the image of the American colonies following the independence war. He returned to England in June 1822 with the objective of acquiring a loan of five million pounds sterling. Zea was able to get support for the independentist cause from many of sympathetic Brits who called themselves Friends of South American Independence, among them some notable figures like the general Gregor MacGregor; Edward Adolphus St Maur, 11th Duke of Somerset; Sir James Mackintosh; Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne; William Wilberforce; Sir Benjamin Hobhouse; John Diston Powles, and various other members of the British Parliament, who on 10 July 1822 at the City of London Tavern had given him a dinner party in his honour and that of Colombia's as a way to show support and raise that much needed credit for Colombia. Zea however never saw the conclusion of his mission for he died shortly after. Death Death found Francisco Antonio Zea at the age of 56 on 28 November 1822, at the Royal York House Hotel, in Bath, Somerset, England, where he had gone to take refuge in the famous hot springs. His remains were later interred at Bath Abbey on 4 December 1822. Statue of Francisco Antonio Zea, located at the Zea Plaza in Medellin, Antioquia.

Louis Dauterman of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin opened the Wonder Spot in 1952, and Bill Carney purchased it in 1988. According to Carney, as many as 50,000 visitors came to the site each year during the mid-1990s. However, when more sophisticated theme parks and water parks in the area began threatening his business, Carney decided to sell the site to the village of Lake Delton in 2006 for $300,000. The village planned to build a road near the ravine. At the time of its closing, the Wonder Spot was the oldest permitted attraction in the Wisconsin Dells region.

His books were rooted in three major literary movements in Latin America: Romanticism, Modernism, and Postmodernism. Paoli was also a Secretary General of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party and a Puerto Rican patriot. In 1950 he was imprisoned for having a Puerto Rican flag in his home, and for speaking on behalf of Puerto Rico's independence. Early years Matos Paoli was one of nine siblings born and raised on the family farm in the town of Lares, a town which is historically known for El Grito de Lares, Puerto Rico's first rebellion for independence. His mother died in 1930 when he was 15 years old. The death of his mother compelled him to write his first collection of poems, titled Signario de Lágrimas, which was published in 1931. Matos Paoli received his primary and secondary education in his hometown. In high school he dedicated most of his time to reading classical literature. Francisco Matos Paoli It was during his youth that he met Pedro Albizu Campos and became inspired to join the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party in its struggle for Puerto Rico's independence. In 1933, Matos Paoli met fourteen-year-old Lolita Lebrón, during the celebration of her baptism into the Catholic faith. Soon, Matos Paoli became Lebron's first boy friend and they would often write letters to each other where they exchanged the poetry that they wrote. Matos Paolí's family opposed their relationship because they considered Lebrón a jíbara (peasant). Her father also opposed this relationship and ordered her to stop writing to Paoli. However, they both continued to write to each other until he moved to San Juan to continue his education.Ribes Tovar et al., p.37 Matos Paoli enrolled at the Polytechnical School of the University of Puerto Rico and earned his bachelor's degree in education with a major in Spanish. Lebrón, who became a nationalist herself and led the 1954 attack against the United States House of Representatives, moved to San Juan, where she studied sewing and continued her romantic relationship with Matos Paoli.Ribes Tovar et al., p.46 The relationship ended when Matos Paoli continued his postgraduate studies in the UPR and moved to Paris, France, for a year to study comparative literature at the Sorbonne. In 1937, he published his second collection of poems titled Cardo Labriego. During this time he met Isabel Freire Meléndez, a fellow independence advocate who in 1942 became his wife. After he earned his master's degree in Spanish literature, he returned to Puerto Rico and in 1943 began a professorship in the Humanities Department of his alma mater, the University of Puerto Rico.Francisco Matos Paoli, poeta He also became involved in spiritualism and founded a spiritualist center called Luz y Progreso (Light and Progress). Nationalist and poet Paoli's political activities and beliefs influenced his literary work. On May 21, 1948, a bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and nationalist movements on the archipelago. The Senate, which at the time was controlled by the Partido Popular Democrático (PPD) and presided by Luis Muñoz Marín, approved the bill.\\"La obra jurídica del Profesor David M. Helfeld (1948-2008)'; by: Dr. Carmelo Delgado Cintrón This bill, which resembled the anti-communist Smith Act passed in the United States in 1940, became known as the Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law, technically \\"Law 53 of 1948\\") when the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Jesús T. Piñero, signed it into law on June 10, 1948. Under this new law it became a crime to print, publish, sell, or exhibit any material intended to paralyze or destroy the insular government; or to organize any society, group or assembly of people with a similar destructive intent. It made it illegal to sing a patriotic song, and reinforced the 1898 law that had made it illegal to display the Flag of Puerto Rico, with anyone found guilty of disobeying the law in any way being subject to a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment, a fine of up to US$10,000 (), or both, for each offence. According to Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa, a non-PPD member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, the law was repressive and was in violation of the First Amendment of the US Constitution which guarantees Freedom of Speech. He pointed out that the law as such was a violation of the civil rights of the people of Puerto Rico.La Gobernación de Jesús T. Piñero y la Guerra Fría In 1949, the Nationalist Party held an assembly in the town of Arecibo and named Paoli Secretary General of the party. Some of his duties as Secretary General of the party included the presentation of patriotic speeches. Due to the Gag Law, these duties placed Paoli on a collision course with the U.S. government. In September 1950, Paoli traveled to the towns of Cabo Rojo, Santurce, Guánica and Lares, where he participated in Nationalist activities. On October 30, the Nationalists staged uprisings in the towns of Ponce, Mayagüez, Naranjito, Arecibo, Utuado (Utuado Uprising), San Juan (San Juan Nationalist revolt), and Jayuya (Jayuya Uprising). On November 2, 1950, the police arrived at Paoli's home in Río Piedras and searched for guns and explosives. The only thing they found was a Puerto Rican flag but, due to the Gag Law, this enabled them to arrest and accuse Paoli of treason against the United States. The evidence used against him was the Puerto Rican flag in his home, and four speeches he'd made in favor of Puerto Rican independence. On the basis of this \\"evidence\\" Paoli was fired from his professorship at the University of Puerto Rico, and sentenced to a twenty-year prison term, which was later reduced to ten years. In jail, he shared his cell with Pedro Albizu Campos. Campos suffered from ulcerations on his legs and body caused by radiation, and Paoli tended to his needs. Political prisoner While in prison, Paoli edited a newspaper which included news of political prisoners, poems, patriotic songs and drawings. During his confinement he suffered from hallucinations which resulted in a mental breakdown and he was sent to a Psychiatric hospital. After his recovery, he wrote Canto a Puerto Rico (I Sing to Puerto Rico), and resumed his involvement with spiritual mysticism and Christianity. In 1951, he published a collection of poems in a book which he titled Luz de los Héroes (The Light of Heroes), which spoke about the Puerto Rican independence movement. Paoli's poetry also covered other aspects of human existence such as religion, mystic and spiritual experiences, love, death, solitude, social justice, suffering, freedom, the landscape, and his fellow Puerto Ricans.Dictionary of Literary Biography on Francisco Matos Paoli Paoli was released on probation on January 16, 1952. Nationalists attack the U.S. House of Representatives On March 1, 1954 Lolita Lebrón, together with three other members of the Nationalist Party, entered the visitor's gallery above the chamber in the House of Representatives in Washington, D.C.. Lebron stood up and shouted \\"¡Viva Puerto Rico Libre!\\" (\\"Long Live a Free Puerto Rico!\\") and unfurled the flag of Puerto Rico. Subsequently, the group opened fire with semi-automatic pistols.Edward F. Ryan, The Washington Post, March 2, 1954, pp.1, 12-13. The U.S. government ordered the wholesale arrest of Nationalist Party members including Paoli, who was not involved in the incident. Upon his incarceration in Rio Piedras prison without any visitor's privileges, Paoli initiated a hunger strike. On May 26, 1955, after ten months in jail and in poor health, Paoli was finally pardoned by Puerto Rican Governor Luis Muñoz Marín. Written works Paoli was named resident poet of University of Puerto Rico and served as lecturer. In 1977, the Department of Hispanic Studies at the UPR campus in Mayagüez nominated him for the Nobel Prize in literature in recognition of his substantial contribution to world literature. His critics consider his books rooted in three major literary movements in Latin America: Romanticism, Modernism, and Postmodernism. Amongst his published works are the following: *Canto a Puerto Rico (1952) \\"I Sing to Puerto Rico\\" *Luz de los Héroes (1954) \\"Light of Heroes\\" *Criatura de Rocío (1958) \\"Creature of Mist\\" *Canto a la Locura (1962) \\"Song to the Madness\\" *El Viento y la Paloma (1969) \\"The Wind and the Pigeon\\" *Cancionera (1970) \\"Song Book\\" *La Marea Sube (1971) \\"The Raising Waves\\" *Cancionero II (1972) \\"Song Book Pt.2\\" *Rostro en la Estrella (1973) \\"A Face in the Star\\" *Isla para los Niños (1981) \\"Island for Children\\" *Hacia el Hondo Vuelo (1983) \\"Towards the Deep Flight\\" *Decimario de la Virgen (1990) \\"A Vigil for the Virgin\\" Later years Paoli and Lebron remained lifelong friends and he wrote the foreword to one of her books of poems. In July 1982, Paoli was selected as one of fifty poets to attend the Sixth World Congress of Poets held in Madrid, Spain. He also attended, by invitation, the eighth World Congress of Poets in Athens, Greece in 1985. Among the magazines which published his essays were Asomante, Puerto Rico Ilustrado, and Alma Latina. In 1989, the Manati Foundation of Art and Culture of the town of Manati, dedicated their annual Juegos Florales (Poetry Pageants) to Paoli. Paoli lived with his wife Isabel Freire de Matos (1915–2004), herself an educator and journalist, in San Juan. He became ill and was hospitalized at the Hospital del Maestro in Hato Rey, where he died on July 10, 2000.

The courts of common pleas are the trial courts of general jurisdiction in the state. They are the only trial courts created by the Ohio Constitution (in Article IV, Section 1). The duties of the courts are outlined in Article IV, Section 4. Each of Ohio's 88 counties has a court of common pleas. The Ohio General Assembly (the state legislature) has the power to divide courts of common pleas into divisions, and has done so, establishing general, domestic relations, juvenile, and probate divisions: *General divisions have original jurisdiction in all criminal felony cases, all civil cases in which the amount in controversy is more than $15,000, and all cases involving title to real estate, excepting eviction matters. General divisions also have appellate jurisdiction over the decisions of some state administrative agencies and of city agencies. *Domestic relations divisions have jurisdiction over proceedings involving divorce (dissolution of marriage), annulment, legal separation, spousal support, parental rights, children, etc. *Juvenile divisions hear cases involving juvenile delinquency (minors under 18 years of age charged with acts that would be crimes if committed by an adult) as well as cases involving unruly, dependent and neglected children. Juvenile courts have jurisdiction in adult cases involving paternity, child abuse, non-payment of child support, contributing to the delinquency of minors, and the failure to send children to school (truancy). *Probate divisions – Formerly probate was handled by separate probate courts under Ohio Constitution of 1851, which had original jurisdiction over the probate of wills, supervision of the administration of estates, and guardianship. In 1968, the Modern Courts Amendment to the Ohio Constitution was adopted, establishing probate divisions of the courts of common pleas instead. Probate courts additionally have jurisdiction over the issuance of marriage licenses, adoption proceedings, determination of sanity or mental competency and certain eminent domain proceedings. Probate judges may also act as marriage officiants and charge a fee for the service. Judges of the court of common pleas are elected to six-year terms on a nonpartisan ballot, although candidates may choose to run in partisan primary elections. In order to be appointed or elected to the court, a person must be an attorney with at least six years of experience in the practice of law.

It lies north of the town of Hexham and is the main access to the A69 bypass.  History  The Tyne was crossed by two ferries called the east and the west boats (Warden Bridge). As a result of persistent agitation, a bridge was started in 1767 and completed in 1770. It was built by Mr Galt and consisted of seven arches. Less than a year later it was swept away in the great Tyne flood of 1771. In that flood, eight bridges shared the fate of Hexham. In 1774 a new attempt was made to the west by Mr Wooler, an engineer who had been working on the new Newcastle bridge. Piles were sunk to carry the piers but work was abandoned on discovering that the \\"soil beneath the gravel was a quicksand with no more resistance than chaff\\". This first bridge, Hexham Old Bridge, was about upstream of the present bridge. The authorities next approached John Smeaton, whose name as an engineer was famous. Henry Errington of Sandhoe was given the contract for the sum of £4,700, Northumberland Archives: Hexham Bridge Papers SANT/BEQ/1/4/1 and work started in 1777. Although the half-completed piers were washed away the following year, work continued and the new bridge was opened to traffic in 1780 [others give 1781]. However, on 10 March 1782, there was a heavy fall of snow followed by a violent hurricane. The valleys of the north and south Tyne were inundated and the nine arches were completely overturned. They are still visible and act as a sort of weir. Robert Mylne, a famous architect and engineer, was called in to report on the feasibility of rebuilding Smeaton's bridge. He was eventually given the contract to build a fourth bridge, and the work was completed in 1793. It is listed as a Grade II* building by Historic England.

These codes are available to academic or research institutes, software manufacturers or veterinary practices after a request for a permission. VeNom Codes Membership The VeNom Codes have been developed in the first opinion and referral hospitals at the RVC in collaboration with Glasgow Vet School and the PDSA and are now maintained by a multi-institution group of veterinary clinicians and IT specialists from the RVC, Glasgow Vet School and the PDSA called the VeNom Coding Group. A small group of members from various institutes manage and maintain the list of terms, and invite or authorize others to use the term. A second group of members provide the scientific input to ensure the list is peer reviewed and correct - these members can be any one who uses the list. Any disputes over the list will be solved by a general consensus and overseen by the management group. VeNom Codes The VENOM codes comprise an extensive, standardised list of terms for recording the best available diagnosis at the end of an animal visit. It comprises mainly diagnoses but also includes terms appropriate for administrative transactions (e.g. non prescription diet sales, over the counter items, travel related items) and preventive health visits (vaccination(s), routine parasite control, neutering). In the event that the clinician seeing the animal feels unable to record a diagnosis for the visit (for example, on a first consultation when only limited diagnostic workup has been possible, e.g. coughing where a precise diagnosis is not yet available) it is also possible to select one or more presenting complaints (again, these are standardised in the list). If an item is missing from the list, please advise us and we will make the necessary adjustments if required. We are currently working on other lists (procedures etc.) and these will be added to the VENOM codes in due course. The VENOM codes are a long list of conditions (Term name) identified by their unique numeric codes (Data Dictionary Id). There is a label field to identify the type of term (Container and Container ID–e.g. diagnosis, presenting complaint, administrative task etc.). The Top level modelling field includes the parent grouping / body system for each term. There is also a CRIS Active flag which is elected if the PMS prefers the referral centre version. In this version presenting complaints are stated without 'presenting complaint - ' prefix and the administrative tasks are excluded. For the first opinion version the Rx Active flag field allows selection of this version and includes presenting complaints with the prefix ‘presenting complaint -’ to highlight this is not strictly a diagnosis. The final field is the Active Flag key which indicates if the term is active or has been inactivated. The VENOM Codes have been developed in the first opinion and referral hospitals at the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) in collaboration with Glasgow Vet School and the PDSA and the codes are now maintained by a multi-institution group of veterinary clinicians and IT experts from the RVC, Glasgow Vet School and the PDSA called the VENOM Coding Group. The codes are a long list identified by their unique numeric code and work best with a multi- letter search function–so clinicians type ‘abs’ and get all possible terms with abs as first letters of any of the words in the diagnosis–e.g. ‘anal sac abscess’, ‘abscess–neck (cervical)’,...etc. For some terms there are synonyms in brackets behind the main term to allow identification of the correct term if these letters are typed in the search box. The main concern for VENOM Codes is that all PMS's and other end-users that adopt the VENOM codes also adopt the rules of the VENOM Coding group–namely that the VENOM Coding group maintains the list. If, for example, a practitioner requests a new item, then you forward the request to us (or they go direct to us). We then put it to the VENOM Coding group to vote on and if approved it is added to the list, if not it doesn't go on the list. Our turn around on new items is 3-5 working days currently. The new item would be added to the list and then emailed out to each computer management system that uses the codes to upload to their system and practices. We are now working to 3 monthly updates, though can issue additional updates if end-users require specific terms to be added sooner. We also request that the diagnostic lists used by the PMS's and other end-users are kept restricted to the standard VENOM terms and that practitioners can not their own terms as they go along. The Data Dictionary The codes are a long list identified by their unique numeric codes (Data dictionary id) and work well with a multi-letter search function–so clinicians type ‘abs’ and get all possible terms with abs as first letters of any of the words in the diagnosis–e.g. ‘anal sac abscess’, ‘abscess–neck (cervical)’,...etc. For some terms there are synonyms in brackets behind the main term to allow identification of the correct term if these letters are typed in the search box. Apart from the Term name and data dictionary id (numeric code), there is a label field to identify the type of term and then currently the other fields of the codes include a 'CRIS active flag' which is elected if you want the referral version–presenting complaints without 'presenting complaint' prefix and without the admin tasks etc. Otherwise for the first opinion version the ‘Rx Active flag’ field allows selection of this version. The final field is the Active flag which indicates if the term is active or has been inactivated.

It was located two kilometres southeast of Beersheba. According to the Jewish National Fund, the name means \\"House of the Tamarisk\\" and refers to the tamarisks planted by the patriarch Abraham at Beersheba. The pioneers of Beit Eshel were Holocaust survivors from Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Germany. As one of three outposts, the residents of Beit Eshel were tasked with checking the viability of agriculture in the area based on climate analysis, availability of water, etc. In 1947 the village had a population of over 100. In May 1948, when Egypt invaded Israel in the early stages of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Beit Eshel was cut off from Jewish territory and was shelled heavily by the Egyptians. According to the Haganah, this attack was repulsed. After 8 men and women were killed, many buildings destroyed or harmed and with the Egyptians continuing to fire at the village. The Egyptian army continued to shell Beit Eshel sporadically. In October 1948, with the conquest of the city of Beersheba, Beit Eshel was liberated. However, the settlers of Beit Eshel couldn't cope with the large scale destruction, decided to abandon the settlement and to establish a new moshav named HaYogev in the Jezreel Valley. In 1960, a group of Beersheva residents established a volunteer society to preserve Beit Eshel as a national heritage site.Stayput Beersheba Archaeology Excavations at Beit Eshel in 2003 by a joint team of the Israel Antiquities Authority and the Archaeological Division of Ben Gurion University of the Negev unearthed Ghassulian flint sickle blades from the fifth millennium BC, suggesting that the site was a Chalcolithic flint workshop.

He is notable for mid-twentieth century research he did on the thermodynamics of the light- independent reactions of photosynthesis. Life Tamiya was a student of Keita Shibata, a plant physiologist, as a student at Tokyo University. Andrew Benson, who was instrumental in understanding carbon fixation in plants considered Tamiya inspirational in his own success as a scientist. Tamiya worked and studied in Japan, Europe, and the United States, collaborating internationally with a variety of scientists. After World War II, during the Allied Occupation of Japan, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology physicist Harry C. Kelly selected Tamiya to assist him in evaluating scientific research in Japan. The mission was largely in response to the destruction of cyclotrons by the United States Army acting out of fear the Japanese had been researching and developing a nuclear weapon during the war. One of the cyclotrons destroyed was an instrument that Tamiya required for his research. In 1953 Tamiya, working with other Japanese scientists, developed techniques for the synchronous culture of the green algae Chlorella, a model organism used by Otto Heinrich Warburg whom Tamiya admired. Tamiya was able with it to culture algal cell lines that were all in the same developmental stage, a technique used by later scientists to decipher the life cycles of other single celled eukaryotic organisms. In 1966 Tamiya was made a foreign associate member of the United States National Academy of Sciences. In 1977 he was given the Japanese Order of Culture for his contributions to science in Japan.

These networks address local sustainable development challenges through research and capacity development. This was the birth of Regional Centres of Expertise on ESD (RCEs). RCEs are acknowledged by the UNU based on recommendations of the Ubuntu Committee of Peers for the RCEs, which consists of signatories of the Ubuntu Declaration signed in 2002. RCEs aspire to achieve the goals of the DESD by translating its global objectives into the context of the local communities in which they operate. This is then accomplished by acting as a catalyst for institutions that promote ESD through formal, non-formal and informal education, and by providing suitable platforms to share information and experiences and to promote dialogue among regional stakeholders through partnerships for sustainable development. They also develop regional knowledge bases to support ESD and promote its goals in a resource effective manner. This can be achieved through the delivery of training programmes, by facilitating research into ESD, through public awareness raising, and by increasing the quality and access to ESD in the region. An RCE should have four core elements: * Governance - addressing issues of RCE management and leadership * Collaboration - addressing the engagement of actors from all levels of formal, non-formal and informal education * Research and development - addressing the role of research and its inclusion in RCE activities, as well as contributing to the design of strategies for collaborative activities, including those with other RCEs * Transformative education - contributing to the transformation of the current education and training systems to satisfy ambitions of the region regarding sustainable living and livelihood. RCEs also have four major ESD goals to be promoted in an effective way: * Re-orienting education towards SD, by covering integrating SD and ESD into the current curriculum and tailoring it to address issues and local context of the community in which they operate; * Increase access to quality education that is most needed in the regional context; * Deliver trainers’ training programmes and to develop methodologies and learning materials for them; * Lead advocacy and awareness raising efforts to raise public awareness about the importance of educators and the essential role of ESD in achieving a sustainable future. RCEs promote the long-term goals of ESD, such as environmental stewardship, social justice, and improvement of the quality of life. RCEs are not only significant for the region itself, where they provide a unique opportunity to promote learning and development for SD, but also important at international level where they help to constitute the Global Learning Space for Sustainable Development. Globally, RCEs are facilitated through the United Nations University Institute for Advanced Studies (UNU-IAS) who provide a framework for strategy, best practice and techniques for success, which can then be translated to the regional level. RCEs have recently been acknowledged in the 2009 Bonn Declaration which calls for action to “develop knowledge through ESD networking” through “networks that could serve as centres of expertise and innovation”.

It is often smoked or cooked in some manner before purchase so that the buyer can eat it without further preparation. It is very different from popular American bacon, which is typically sold soft and uncooked. Szalonna roast Szalonna can be cooked over a pit. This involves cutting the szalonna into long chunks or cubes, spearing them, and roasting them over an open fire. The szalonna cooks to be somewhat crispy and is then eaten with other dishes or alone. Once it starts to sizzle and drip with fat, the szalonna is removed from the fire and the fat is allowed to drip onto a slice of freshly baked bread. The szalonna is returned to the fire and the process is repeated until the piece of bread is nearly saturated with fat from the szalonna. Sliced cucumber, red onion, green peppers, sliced radishes, paprika, other vegetables, ground pepper, and salt are used to add flavor to the slice of bread, and then more drippings are followed to top it off. Periodically, the charred remains are scraped off of the szalonna and are used as an additional topping. This dish was considered to be peasants' food since the most important aspect was the fat, discarded by wealthier Hungarians. Preparation, cooking and serving remain a longstanding summer tradition among even second and third generation American Hungarians. The szalonna (or \\"greasy\\" or \\"dirty\\") bread is often served with brandy or beer; in many families, \\"Opening Day\\" has become a rite of passage for families of American-Hungarian descent, where traditional family stories and customs are shared as a part of the meal. Young children are given their first taste of the bread at that time. During and after World War II a hard fruit slab that could be sliced was referred to as Hitlerszalonna.

He is known as a founder of onomastics and folk etymology studies in Germany, and also for his seminal contributions made in the early years of Mayanist research, towards the decipherment and understanding of calendrical elements in the pre-Columbian Maya script.Coe (1992, pp.107–108); Hammond (1991, p.10)  Biography  Ernst Wilhelm Förstemann was born in Danzig as the son of the mathematician Wilhelm August Förstemann. His family was originally from Nordhausen. From 1831 to 1840 he was educated at the local grammar school, where his father was a teacher of Mathematics. In 1840 Förstemann went to study Comparative linguistics at the Humboldt University of Berlin but moved to Halle (Saale) in 1841, where he continued his studies at the Martin Luther University of Halle- Wittenberg. During his years at university, Förstemann was particularly furthered by Karl Lachmann, Franz Bopp and August Friedrich Pott. Upon his return from Halle, Förstemann was appointed assistant teacher at the Danzig grammar school and also worked as a private tutor until 1848. In 1845 he took the Staatsexamen in Berlin. Förstemann was also the only contestant in a competition hosted by Jacob Grimm that required a list of names that were in use in Germany until the year of 1100. Although he only submitted a draft, he won the prize and was encouraged by Grimm to publish the completed work in 1858. When Förstemann was offered a position as librarian at the Fürst zu Stolberg-Wernigerodesche Bibliothek in 1851, he gave up his position at Danzig and went to Wernigerode. Also, he added about 20.000 volumes to the library's holdings . In addition to his work as librarian, Förstemann also accepted a teaching assignment at the local grammar school. In 1865 Förstemann was invited to Dresden by the widow of Frederick William IV of Prussia, where he succeeded Gustav Klemm as chief librarian at the Royal Public Library (now the Saxon State Library), which contained the Dresden Codex. Förstemann reorganized the library and began to work on a new catalogue. Förstemann resigned in 1887, aged 65, in favour of the less strenuous task of overseeing the King's private library and the library of the Sekundogenitur (Dresden).

Morgan played international rugby for Wales and in 1908 was selected to join Arthur Harding's Anglo-Welsh tour of New Zealand and Australia. Rugby career One of the first clubs that Morgan was affiliated to was Guy's Hospital, following his older brother Teddy Morgan, who was already a Welsh international rugby player. During the 1905/06 season while representing Guy's, Morgan was invited to play for invitational touring team the Barbarians.Starmer-Smith, Nigel The Barbarians Macdonald & Jane's Publishers (1977) pg. 227 By 1908, Morgan was back in Wales, and playing for first class Welsh team, Cardiff. It was while representing Cardiff, that Morgan was selected for the Anglo-Welsh team to tour Australia and New Zealand with his brother Teddy. The British team were outclassed in the first Test Match against New Zealand in Dunedin, and five replacements were made for the second test in Wellington, which included both Morgan and his brother. Morgan found himself one of three halfbacks, in an unorthodox formation which mimicked the New Zealand seven man pack. Joining Morgan at half back were two other Welsh players, James \\"Tuan\\" Jones and moved from threequarters, Reggie Gibbs. The game ended in a 3-3 draw and Morgan was reselected for the final test in Auckland. Despite his considerable rugby experience to date it took until 1910 for Morgan to win a cap for his own birth country, Wales. In a home game played at the Cardiff Arms Park, Morgan was brought into the Welsh team to face Scotland as part of the Five Nations Championship as a replacement for Dicky Owen. Morgan was partnered at halfback with Percy Bush, which saw the Welsh team win by a comfortable 14 points to nil. The next game, Morgan was replaced by Newport's Tommy Vile and didn't represent Wales again. After his rugby career for Cardiff came to an end, Morgan would often turn out for French team Stade Bordelais, where he was nicknamed \\"Billy Bordeaux\\".

The company specializes in landscape design, landscape planning and landscape management with a focus on the conservation of historic landscapes. The company is based in York and is run by Managing Director Alex Robinson.  History  After studying agriculture at the University of London and spending three years with Country Life, Patrick James spent four years working at the Heritage Lottery Fund. It was there that James gained architectural experience and decided to start his own company. Teaming up with two associates, Tom Stuart-Smith and Todd Longstaffe-Gowan, James founded The Landscape Agency in October 1998. After two years, James decided to seek additional start-up capital to grow the business. The funding was successful and the company began to grow rapidly. As the company grew, the range of the projects also widened, although efforts remained focused on historic landscape projects across England and Ireland. Early commissions for the Landscape Agency included preparing landscape management plans for Yorkshire Sculpture Park, Bramham Park, the London Zoo and Broadlands - a ‘Capability’ Brown park in Hampshire. In 2003, The Landscape Agency was awarded the London Squares garden award for its work on the north central garden in Eaton Square.http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-24859112_ITM The company had spent the previous four years redesigning and replanting the once dilapidated gardens. In 2007, the firm was commissioned by the Royal Horticultural Society to masterplan the Society's gardens at Wisley, Hyde Hall, Rosemoor and Harlow Carr. Then Creative Director Alistair Baldwin led the project, bringing about major change at all four sites.http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/gardening/Pupils-reap-benefits-of- gardening.3511322.jp More recent projects include the rejuvenation of the gardens at Lowther Castle in Cumbria, the rejuvenation of Belgrave, and Hackfall - a Grade I landscape near Ripon which had been neglected for almost a century. The Hackfall project was awarded a £1 million grant by the Heritage Lottery Fund and, in 2008, the project won the RIBA/Landscape Institute White Rose Award.

Design Blohm & Voss designers began to consider airborne missiles late in 1938, even before the outbreak of war. First of these to be developed was the Bv 143, a glide bomb with rocket booster. Trials began in 1939.Hermann Pohlmann, Chronik Eines Flugzeugwerkes 1932-1945 (Story of an aircraft manufacturer, 1932-1945), Motor Buch, 2nd Impression, 1982, pp.194-196. By 1941, Allied merchant ships were slow and easy targets for German coastal bombers, but were proving increasingly well-equipped with anti-aircraft artillery, making short-range attacks prohibitively costly. Interest was raised in the development of a stand off weapon to engage unarmored merchant ships from beyond the range of the Bofors 40 mm gun. The BV 143 was one of several stand off bomb and missile designs researched by the Blohm & Voss Naval Engineering Works for this anti- shipping role.Sterrenburg, Frithjof A.S. The Oslo Report: Nazi secret weapons forfeited. wlhoward.com. Retrieved on June 6, 2009. The Bv 143 was designed to be air-dropped from beyond the range of antiaircraft guns, glide towards the target, engage its solid rocket motor below the line of fire of guns, and commence a short (30 second, maximum) high speed dash to the target, striking above the waterline. The first design, with straight wings and cross-like tail,Christopher, John. The Race for Hitler's X-Planes (The Mill, Gloucestershire: History Press, 2013), p.133. featured a 2-meter instrumented \\"feeler probe\\" suspended from the body, designed to start the rocket on contacting the sea surface.Gustin, Emmanuel. Luftwaffe Research Group. warbirdsresourcegroup.org. Retrieved on June 6, 2009. A pitch-only autopilot then maintained the bomb at the 2 m probe length until striking the target. The first working prototypes of this design were completed in February 1941. Tests during 1943Christopher, p.133. showed the probe-based design to be unworkable and after additional design time it was replaced with a radio altimeter, which although being less fragile also ultimately proved unsatisfactory. The bomb proved consistently unable to reliably maintain altitude stability with either design, with rocket misfires and failures also proving troublesome. After building and testing 157 examples, the project was eventually abandoned in favor of the Henschel Hs 293.Hermann Pohlmann, Chronik Eines Flugzeugwerkes 1932-1945 (Story of an aircraft manufacturer, 1932-1945), Motor Buch, 2nd Impression, 1982, pp.194-196: \\"Es wurden insgesamt September 1943 (Baustopp) 157 Geräte abgeliefert und in Versuchen verbraucht.\\"Ford, Roger (2000).

Background Garlies was the eldest son of John Stewart, 7th Earl of Galloway, and Anne, daughter of Sir James Dashwood, 2nd Baronet, and attended Westminster School before embarking on a career in the Royal Navy. Military career Garlies entered into the navy at an early age, serving as a 13-year-old midshipman under the command of his uncle, Commodore Keith Stewart at the Battle of Dogger Bank in August 1781, and also in the Great Siege of Gibraltar in 1782. In 1789 he was promoted to lieutenant, serving in the frigate in the Mediterranean. He returned to England in early 1790, when appointed commander of the fire ship . He was promoted to post-captain on 30 April 1793, and soon after was appointed to the frigate , serving in the West Indies, and being wounded while covering the landing of the army at Guadaloupe in April 1794, and was then sent with detachments of troops to accept the surrender of the islands of Marie-Galante and La Désirade. In 1795 he took command of the frigate , and took Sir John Jervis out from England to assume command in the Mediterranean. Commanding a division of four frigates and a sloop, he engaged the Spanish ship of line San Francisco de Asís in the Action of 25 January 1797, in which he was forced to withdraw. He served in the area until the Battle of Cape St Vincent in February 1797. After the battle Lively carried Sir Robert Calder, with the account of the victory, and Lord Minto, Viceroy of Corsica, and his suite, who were on board during the battle, back to England. Around November 1799 Garlies commissioned the frigate , and commanded her in the Channel and on the coast of Ireland until early 1801, making several captures and recaptures: * On 17 May 1800 Hussar, the frigate Loire and the schooner recaptured the ship Princess Charlotte, and captured the French schooner La Francoise. * On 2 March 1801 Hussar captured the French schooner Le General Bessieres. * On 12 April 1801 Hussar recaptured the ship James of Liverpool. In early 1801 Garlies moved into the , to serve on the blockade of Brest, remaining there until the Treaty of Amiens in early 1802 brought a short-lived period of peace. Following the renewal of hostilities in May 1803 he commanded the ship , and sat on the Board of Admiralty in between May 1805 and February 1806. Galloway saw no further active service, but was promoted to Rear-Admiral on 31 July 1810; to Vice Admiral on 12 August 1819; and to Admiral on 22 July 1830. Political career Apart from his military career Garlies also sat as a Member of Parliament. He was first elected in 1790 for the constituency of Saltash, and served until vacating his seat in favour of his brother William in February 1795. He returned to Parliament when elected MP for Cockermouth on 22 July 1805, and then sat for Haslemere after the 1806 election, but was shortly after obliged to quit his seat following the death of his father on 13 November, when he became the Earl of Galloway, and moved to the House of Lords. He served as Lord Lieutenant of Kirkcudbright from 26 December 1794 to 1807, and from 1820 to 1828, and of Wigtownshire from 28 March 1807 to 1828.

Vieira dismissed him from that post in October 2007; some suggested that he was dismissed due to pressure from opposition leaders and military officials.\\"Guinea-Bissau interior minister replaced\\", Radio France Internationale (nl.newsbank.com), 17 October 2007. Following the November 2008 parliamentary election, Dabó regained a position in the government as Minister of Territorial Administration on 7 January 2009. Dabó was reportedly known for having a \\"flamboyant lifestyle\\", and rumors suggested that he was involved in the drug trade, which is pervasive in Guinea- Bissau.\\"Guinea-Bissau candidates keep it low-key after killings\\", AFP, 10 June 2009. Vieira was assassinated by members of the armed forces on 2 March 2009; the soldiers killed him in retaliation for an explosion which killed Chief of Staff Batista Tagme Na Wai. There had been a long and violent feud between Vieira and Na Wai. No one was prosecuted for the killing and a presidential election was scheduled for 28 June to select a new president. Dabó resigned from PAIGC and as a minister in mid-May 2009 to put himself forward as an independent candidate and became one of 13 candidates contesting the election. Election campaigning was due to open on 6 June. Death His supporters say that between 3:30 and 4 am (local and GMT) on 5 June 2009 a group of around 30 uniformed and armed soldiers arrived at his home and demanded to see him. The soldiers were then said to have shot their way to Dabó's bedroom where he was asleep in bed with his wife, injuring some of his six-member security team in the process. The soldiers are then alleged to have shot Dabó several times, killing him instantly. According to Agence France-Presse, a \\"medical source\\" told them that Dabó had suffered three AK-47 bullet wounds to the abdomen and one to the head, fired from short range. The Guinea-Bissauan authorities present a different series of events and say that he died in an exchange of fire whilst resisting arrest over an alleged coup plot. Former Defence Minister Hélder Proença was also reported to have been killed on a road between Bula and Bissau alongside his driver and a bodyguard. Several other PAIGC politicians have been detained by security forces as part of the coup investigation. The Guinea-Bissauan state intelligence service says that the coup's aims were \\"physically eliminating the head of the armed forces, overthrowing the interim head of state and dissolving the national assembly\\". It has been suggested by journalist Jean Gomis and reported by the BBC that he may have been killed on the orders of military leaders who feared prosecution over the assassination of President Vieira had Dabó won the election. Analysts consulted by the Reuters news agency stated that if a power vacuum occurs, Latin American drug cartels may be able to extend their influence over the country, which serves as a port for the shipping of cocaine to Europe. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that he was \\"concerned about the emerging pattern of killings of high-profile personalities in Guinea-Bissau\\" and stressed \\"the importance and urgency of conducting a thorough, credible and transparent investigation into the circumstances\\" of the killings. The United Nations Security Council condemned the killings of Dabó and Proença \\"in the strongest terms\\" on 9 June. Both the UN and the African Union urged the election to proceed on schedule, however.

Overview Monte de Piedad Florida Street headquarters The bank was chartered on May 23, 1878, as the Monte de Piedad (Piety Mount) in a measure against the prevalence of usury in Buenos Aires (mostly targeting the growing wave of immigration in Argentina).Banco Ciudad: historia The board of directors' first meeting on July 10 outlined the goal of \\"serving the working community, which is in the greatest need of such an institution.\\" Opening its doors in a Montserrat ward residence formerly belonging to Viceroy Joaquín del Pino (1801–04), the bank grew quickly; in 1888, it was nationalized and transferred to the City of Buenos Aires. Its new headquarters in the financial district was accompanied by new market capitalization, allowing it provide personal, business and mortgage loans and payday advances. It soon began to administer pension funds and became a leading local source for underwriting of initial public offering activity on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange, government bonds, and foreign trade, as well. The institution was rechartered officially as the Municipal Savings and Loan Bank in 1904. Following initially disappointing results, increased investment in bank branches, agencies and other forms of representation led to the institution's renewed growth, particularly during the tenure of bank president Enrique Peña, who in 1916 committed the institution to \\"combat usury in the most effective possible way – making branches readily available throughout the city so as to lessen inconvenience to those who need our services.\\" A nationalist coup in 1943 led to the sudden advent of Col.

University of North Carolina Press, 1990. and in 1944, the savings & loan was again re-chartered as the Municipal Bank of Buenos Aires to give depositors more commercial banking options in Argentina's growing public sector. The bank became a leader in small business lending, and financed public housing projects in underprivileged areas. The city purchased a downtown lot on the massive Nueve de Julio Avenue (where the Mercado del Plata wholesaler stood) in 1947 for the construction of municipal offices, and an important branch was opened therein after the building's 1961 completion. The bank's headquarters were relocated to a refurbished Florida Street building, the former A la Ciudad de México department store, in 1968. These and other new offices allowed the bank to expand its larger-scale commercial lending activities. Its growing competition with the Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires led to the adoption of its current name in 1972. Ninth of July Avenue branch The Bank of the City of Buenos Aires is the ninth-largest in Argentina by deposits, which in February 2010 totaled US$3.6 billion (3.6% of the domestic total), and its loan portfolio of US$2.8 billion made it the nation's eighth-largest lender; it maintained 61 branches, employing over 3,000 people. = Authorities =  Bank of the city of Buenos Aires' Directory  The Directory is integrated by its president, Guillermo Laje, vice president, Fernando Jorge Elías, and general manager, Gustavo Jorge Cardoni.  Directors  The Directors are Delfina Rossi, Nicolás Massot, Gastón Rossi, Franco Moccia.  Syndic  The syndic of trustee is Paula Beatriz Villalba.  Branch offices  = Córdoba = The new branch in the capital city of Cordoba, located in 45 Buenos Aires St., is already running and open to the public from 8:30 to 13:30hs, and offers all banking and financial services. The inauguration ceremony in Cordoba's Capital became a prominent political event, mainly because of its attendees, politicians from both national and provincial arches, from different parties. Among them were the Vice Governor Martín Miguel Llaryora; the city's mayor, Javier Ramón Mestre; the Vice Chief of Government of Buenos Aires, Diego Santilli; the former president of the bank and current Minister of the Interior Rogelio Frigerio; the Vice Mayor of Cordoba Felipe Lábaque; the national senator Laura Rodríguez Machado and the national deputy Héctor Baldassi. The Bank offers free Savings, Checking and Remuneration Accounts, credit and debit cards, and personal and mortgage loans. Companies, as well as small and medium size enterprises will benefit from personalized customer service and counseling, and will have at their disposal the wide range of products the bank has to offer, such as funding lines for working capital and capital and leasing goods, with the most competitive rates and terms of the market, to allow to development of productive, farming and service activities in the region. Ortiz Batalla, current president of the Bank of the City of Buenos Aires, has announced a modernization plan which includes the permanent update of the virtual operation channels, homebanking, and the brand-new mobile banking app the bank launched in March. It also contemplates an ambitious program to renew their fleet of ATMs. = Mendoza = For the first time in its 137 years of trajectory, the third bank of Argentina has expanded to the interior of the country. During the inauguration ceremony of the new branch, located in 32 Catamarca St., there was a symbolic ribbon cut, witnessed by the bank's president, Javier Ortiz Batalla; Mendoza's governor, Alfredo Cornejo; the minister of the Interior, Rogelio Frigerio, and the Vice Chief of Government of Buenos Aires, Diego Santilli, among other government officials. This branch has two floors and 4 ATMs, aside from several lines of cashiers for personalized attention on an area of 600m2, as it stands where the Peuser library used to work (32 Catamarca St.). The bank has committed to offer credits for the internal market and for exporters, with accessible rates and the longest terms of the market.  Branches in Buenos Aires City  The bank has around fifty offices in all of Buenos Aires, some of them designed by MSGSSS studio in the 1960s, during the expansion at the end of the 1960s. They possess a representative aesthetic, with blue glass panes, metallic linings and white interiors, even though some offices keep the original appearance, with glass bricks on the front. = Headquarters = The current bank's head office was designed by MSGSSS studio in 1968, as a symbol of the entity's openness towards new directions. It was built in record time and inaugurated the following year. Since then it has become a well-recognized architectural piece because of the extensive use of glass bricks as a construction material, the integral design of all its furniture and the idea of building a bank with a glazed panel, open to the public on the pedestrian Florida St., unlike the classic concept of a sturdy and closed bank, which attempted to give an image of trust and safety. Located in a building that had been erected for a \\"A la Ciudad de México\\" store, on the corner of Florida and Sarmiento St., the structure was kept by the interior was totally remodeled, and display cases and marquees were open on the facade to showcase the items going up for auction and the bank activity to the walking public. Between 1977 and 1981, an extension to the headquarters of the Bank of the City of Buenos Aires was built, with access through 630 Sarmiento St., today known as the \\"Centre Branch\\". This new access was commissioned to Aslan and Ezcurra architects, and consisted of a glazed tower with metal beams of seven underground levels, plus ground level and 18 floors. In August 2016, the headquarters were re- inaugurated with an avant-garde remodeling, following the parameters outlined in its original construction. This re-inauguration had been planned in 2008 by the current President of the Central Bank, Federico Sturzenegger. = Esmeralda complex = A few blocks away, on 660 Esmeralda St., lies the Esmeralda complex, also known as the Sales Building, where the bank has been holding its public auctions since the 1930s. This building was also remodeled by MSGSSS in 1969, and it stands out because of its ramps and extensive counters with objects up four auction. = New Branch Project = In February 2010, the Bank of the City of Buenos Aires announced an architecture competition to design its new corporate office, in front of Parque Patricios, within the city's new Technological District. For that purpose, the bank purchased a whole block between Uspallata, Atuel, Los Patos and Iguazú streets, which formerly belonged to the City's Institute of Housing. The winning proposal for the building would win the contract to erect it, so the studios competing had to be associated with contractors in order to present their projects. In August 2010, the English Norman Foster and Partners won the competition, associated with the Argentinian designers Berdichevsky-Cherny y Edgardo Minond and CRIBA constructions. Their entire project would cost 200 million pesos, and would take 22 months to build. Argentinian studios like Aisenson (second place), Richter-Dahl Rocha (third place), MSGSSS, Mario Roberto Álvarez and Associates, Antonini-Schön-Zemborain, Hampton-Rivoira, B4FS, Dujovne-Hirsch, Urgell-Penedo-Urgell, and the Uruguayan architect Rafael Viñoly also submitted their designs. The construction started towards the end of 2010. The building was awarded in the 3rd Annual Awards for Excellence in Sustainability, organized by the American Planning Association, in the \\"Sustainable Building Project\\" category.  History  = Municipal Savings and Loans Bank= The board of directors first meeting after its establishment, on July 10, outlined the goal of \\"serving the working community, which is in the greatest need of such an institution.\\" The bank opened its doors in a Monserrat Ward residence that formerly belong to Viceroy Joaquin del Pino, it grew quickly and changed its name six times until it reached its current denomination. The first substantial change occurred in 1888 when, after the federalization of Buenos Aires, the bank was nationalized and transferred to the jurisdiction of the City of Buenos Aires. On September 30, 1904, through law 4351, the institution was called \\"Municipal Savings and Loans Bank\\". Its new headquarters in the financial district were accompanied by new market capitalization, and it allowed it to provide personal, business and mortgage loans and payday advances. It soon began to administer pension funds and became a leading local source of underwriting of initial public offering activity on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange, provincial and national government bonds, and foreign trade, as well. But the main change was that the bank was allowed to collect the public's deposits in Savings Accounts. At first, it followed disappointing results, which increased investment in bank branches, agencies and other forms of representation, and led to the institution's renewed growth, particularly during the tenure of bank president Enrique Peña, who in 1916 committed the institution to \\"combat usury in the most effective possible way – making branches readily available throughout the city so as to lessen inconvenience to those who need our services.\\" = Municipal Bank of Buenos Aires = A nationalist coup in 1943 led to the sudden advent of Col. Juan Perón as the new regime's chief policy-maker. The new government quickly made the control of price gouging in banking and public services a policy centerpiece, and in 1944, the bank was again re-chartered as the Municipal Bank of Buenos Aires, to give depositors more commercial banking options in Argentina's growing public sector. The mass movements that appeared in Argentina since the forties integrated socially and politically urban classes derived from European immigration and rural inland workers, both of which became industrialized. This impacted on the evolution of the bank: social loans under a pledge had started to become a limited tool in a modernizing and growing country that converted its inhabitants into citizens. Municipal Bank had to expand its role then, as the new professionals and salaried employees required loans to buy and set up their own homes, and salesman and small industrial entrepreneurs needed to expand and modernize their facilities to keep up with the expanding internal market. The bank became a leader in small business lending, and financed public housing projects in underprivileged areas. The city purchased a downtown lot on the massive Nueve de Julio Avenue (where the Mercado del Plata wholesaler stood) in 1947 for the construction of municipal offices, and an important branch was opened therein after the building's 1961 completion.  First House B.A Credits  The First House B.A credit line is a response from the Bank of the City of Buenos Aires and the Instituto de Vivienda de la Ciudad (Institute of Housing of the City of Buenos Aires) to the housing problem in the city. This program offers mortgage credits with the lowest rate in the market, so people are able to choose and acquire their own homes, all through an objective and transparent allocation system. The system gives a score to each applicant, and those people who reach a certain scoring are selected and notified through email, and given appointment to present their documentation in the Institute of Housing. Those people who do not make the cut are also informed of their situation via email, and are reminded they can register again the following month. = The conditions to purchase a house are = It has to be a single dwelling, for familiar use and permanent occupation. The property must be worth up to $1.100.000 for applicants without children, and $1.300.000 with children. The house cannot be a luxury residence, meaning the value cannot exceed the $27.000 per square meter. The appraisal will be performed by the Bank of the City of Buenos Aires. Applicants can buy their property in the City of Buenos Aires as well as in the Great Buenos Aires, considered to be less than 100 km from the city limits. = Bank of the City of Buenos Aires = The bank's headquarters were moved to its current location, a refurbished Sarmiento and Florida Street building, on May 23, 1968, on the occasion of the 90th anniversary of its foundation. These and other new offices allowed the bank to expand its larger-scale commercial lending activities. The relocation gave the bank the opportunity to create a new image with colored glazed bricks in large surfaces, both internal and external, as well as the creation of an advertising logo and the possibility to equip all of its offices and subsidiaries. Its growing competition with the Bank of the Province of Buenos Aires led to the adoption of its current name, \\"Bank of the City of Buenos Aires\\", of May 16, 1972. The Bank risked being privatized during the nineties, but several political forces and the bank's own employees defended it, and so it managed to remain under the state's orbit. After the modernization and cleanup process done over the last few years, the Bank retook its social role, confirmed throughout its institutional history.

His sermons had a crucial role in the affirmation of the Slovene language. He is also known by his monastic name John Baptist of Sveti Križ in Vipava (;Joannes Baptiſta à S. Cruce Vippacenſi. 1696.

Sacrum promptuarium, vol. 1 Life Lionelli was born to a Slovene mother and an Italian father in the town of Sveti Križ (now Vipavski Križ) in the Vipava Valley, County of Gorizia. A recent theory conjectures that he was actually born as Ivan Hrobat, the illegitimate son of Katarina Hrobat and a nobleman of the Lanthieri family, and that the surname Lionelli was purchased to avoid embarrassment.Kmecl, Matjaž, Marjan Krušič, & Kazimir Rapoša. 1997.

He took the name \\"Joannes Baptista à Sancta Cruce Vippacensi\\" upon joining the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin in reference to his native town and probably also to the Spanish mystic St. John of the Cross. He served in various monasteries in the Slovene Lands, including the Capuchin monastery of St. Francis Assisi in his native town, and in Croatia. Lionelli died in Gorizia, where he had spent the last years of his life. Work Lionelli wrote over 230 sermons, which he published in a series of five books entitled ' (The Holy Handbook). One of his best-known sermons is ' (On New Year's Day). The publication of these books was financed by members of the nobility and benefactors from within the Church. Lionelli's Sacrum promptuarium was published between 1691 and 1707. The first two volumes were published in Venice, the remaining three in Ljubljana. They are written in the Brda dialect of Slovene, with strong influence of the neighbouring Inner Carniolan dialect, with numerous Germanisms and Latin quotations. The syntax presents a typical Baroque style, with references to Classical tradition.  References  * Snoj, Marko (2006). Slovar jezika Janeza Svetokriškega (Dela, 49/7; 49/8).

In contrast to other classical riding schools, only women ride and train the 40 Lipizzaner stallions. Public performances take place every week on Sundays. There is also an affiliated stud farm that provides horses for the academy as well as preserving a valuable genetic outcross pool for European studs. The roots of the South African Lipizzaners trace to two individuals, both immigrants to South Africa who were each born in Eastern Europe: Horse breeder Count Elemér Janković-Bésán de Pribér-Vuchin of Hungary and horse trainer Major George Iwanowski of Poland. The Jankovics- Bésán family was long known as influential breeders of Lipizzan horses. The animals they bred included Tulipan, founder of the foundation bloodline of the same name. They also preserved an important branch of the Pluto bloodline. About 1890, the family stud farm at Terezovac (now in Croatia), a part of the Jankovics-Bésán estate, was split up because of an inheritance issue. As a result, a second stud was founded in Cabuna, not far from Terezovac. After the resolution of yet another dispute over the Slavonian property of the Jankovics-Bésáns in the late 1920s, the horse breeding operation then moved to Öreglak in Hungary. In 1944, the owner of the stud, Count Jankovics-Bésán, was forced to flee Hungary due to the advance of the Red Army. He left with eight Lipizzans: six mares and two stallions. He first went to Sünching, Germany, where his parents' stud farm was located, and then he fled with his horses to Dorset, England, arriving at Christmas 1946 at the property of Lord Digby. Then, in December, 1948, Jankovics-Bésán brought the horses to South Africa where he settled in Mooi River in KwaZulu-Natal. Iwanowski Major George Iwanowski (born 13. March 1907, died 28. May 2008), a former Polish cavalry officer, set up the tradition of classical horsemanship in South Africa on his own. Iwanowski was born on the property of his family in Lebiodka, Poland (today Belarus). He earned a degree at the College of Agriculture in Warsaw. In his dissertation, he wrote about horse breeding. After two years as an assistant manager of the Polish National Stud in Bogusławice, he finished cavalry school and went into the army. After the Second World War he took over Gestüt Lauvenburg in Rhineland for two years. Then he went to South Africa. He and Josy Hicks founded Centaur Stables in Johannesburg. This later became the first home of the South African Lipizzaners. The academy and breeding program Rider Simone Howarth and Maestoso Erdem, performing the Levade The relationship between Janković-Bésán's horses and the training talents of Iwanowski began in 1951, when the two men met at the Royal Agricultural Show in Pietermaritzburg. Janković-Bésán then invited Iwanowski to his farm in Mooi River, and offered Iwanowski the Lipizzan stallion Maestoso Erdem for training. Iwanowski trained the stallion up to the Haute ecole level. Later Janković-Bésán had to sell his herd, which then consisted of 6 stallions, 9 mares and 3 fillies, for financial reasons. They were purchased by Jack and Angela Irvin. About 1972, the Irvins went to Vienna and imported the stallion Maestoso Palmira to add new blood to the herd in order to prevent inbreeding. They later imported another stallion to use as an outcross, Siglavy Savona. However, the Lipizzan stallions and mares in South Africa are still direct descendants of the original six mares and two stallions. The stud now has up to 20 broodmares, and has become a genetic outcross pool for European studs, because these bloodlines were cut off for several generations from the rest of the world. Jack Irvin was also the head of the company National Chemical Products, which became the first sponsor of the South African Lipizzaners, and the company continued its sponsorship until 1978. In the mid-1950s, George Iwanowski met Colonel Hans Handler, who at the time was second in command at the Spanish Riding School. Handler began to travel to South Africa once a year to help Iwanowski with the planning, the choreography and the training for the performance. The first public performances of the South African Lipizzaners was in 1957. There were 4 riders. Other than Iwanowski, all riders at the academy were women. Some riders of the first graduating class were Mietie of Hartesveldt, Margie Widman, Ann Sutton, Lynn Jarmen, Gill Meyer, Anne Webb, Ania Glintenkamp, Eva Sydow, Carol Kretszchmar, Maureen Quinn, Helen Dalgliesh and Valerie Welsh. Other staff of the Spanish Riding School continued to travel to South Africa to further develop the program. Chief Rider Ignaz Lauscha's first trip to teach in South Africa was in January 1976, later on Rider Ernst Bachinger, Chief Rider Hubert Eichinger and Chief Rider Andreas Hausberger helped to train the stallions and riders.

Game summaries =Game 1= Friday, October 16, 2009 — 7:57 PM (ET) at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, New York On a blustery night where the official game time temperature was , starter CC Sabathia limited the Angels to one run on four hits and a walk in eight innings, striking out seven in a 4–1 Yankee win. The Yankees staked Sabathia to a 2–0 lead in the bottom of the first on an Alex Rodriguez sacrifice fly and an unusual RBI infield single from Hideki Matsui. Matsui hit a short popup to the left side of the infield, but there was a miscommunication between third baseman Chone Figgins and shortstop Erick Aybar and the ball fell in for a single, enabling Johnny Damon to score from second. Vladimir Guerrero set up the Angels' only run in the top of the fourth, hitting a high fly ball to deep left field that looked to be a home run but bounced in front of the fence for a double instead, possibly due to the windy conditions. Guerrero scored two batters later on Kendrys Morales' single. The Yankees added a run in the fifth on Matsui's second run-scoring single of the night, and a pair of Angels errors led to New York's fourth run in the sixth. After reaching base on a walk, Melky Cabrera advanced to second on John Lackey's errant pickoff attempt. Derek Jeter then singled up the middle, but Torii Hunter overran the ball, allowing Cabrera to score without a play at the plate. Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth, recording his 36th career postseason save. =Game 2= Saturday, October 17, 2009 — 7:57 PM (ET) at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, New York Once again, the Yankees struck first in the second inning. After Nick Swisher worked a two-out walk—his first in this postseason—Robinson Canó hit his first career postseason triple to deep right-center field to score Swisher. In the bottom of the third, Derek Jeter hit a solo home run to right field to give the Yankees a 2–0 advantage. The Angels fought back in the fifth. After Maicer Izturis hit a leadoff ground rule double to right field, Erick Aybar's one-out single brought Izturis home to cut the lead in half. Later in the inning, New York starter A. J. Burnett's bases-loaded wild pitch caused the game to be tied at two. Both teams threatened multiple times in the ensuing innings, but neither scored and the game was sent to extra innings. In the top half of the 11th, Gary Matthews, Jr. drew a walk off Yankees reliever Alfredo Aceves, advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by Erick Aybar, and scored on an RBI single by Chone Figgins. At this point, the weather took a turn for the worse, which included rain and snow falling, but the Yankees battled back. In the bottom half of the frame, Alex Rodriguez tied the game with a leadoff home run off Angels closer Brian Fuentes. Then, in the 13th inning, Melky Cabrera managed to reach on an error committed by Izturis, consequently driving in the winning run. Izturis had the option of throwing to first for the second out, but instead attempted a tough throw to get the force at second for a potential double play, completely missing shortstop Aybar. Figgins, who was backing up the play, came up with the ball in an attempt to get the play at the plate but it slipped out of his hand. Jerry Hairston, Jr., who had reached on a single to start the inning, came around to score on that error. Alex Rodriguez's 11th-inning home run was his second late-inning game- tying home run in this postseason. Both were off the opposing team's closer (the Minnesota Twins' Joe Nathan, in ALDS Game 2). =Game 3= Monday, October 19, 2009 — 4:13 PM (ET) at Angel Stadium of Anaheim in Anaheim, California For the third game in a row the Yankees scored first, this time on Derek Jeter's leadoff home run off Angels starter Jered Weaver. They extended their lead on solo home runs by Alex Rodriguez in the fourth inning and Johnny Damon in the fifth, both off Weaver. Yankees starter Andy Pettitte held the Angels scoreless until the fifth inning, when he yielded a solo home run to Howie Kendrick in the fifth. The next inning, Vladimir Guerrero hit a two-run home run, also off Pettitte, to tie the game. The Angels took the lead in the seventh, thanks to Kendrick's one-out triple and Maicer Izturis' sacrifice fly, both off Joba Chamberlain. However, a Jorge Posada solo home run off Kevin Jepsen—the sixth in the game—tied it again in the eighth. Another Angels' gaffe proved costly. In the eighth inning Abreu led off with a double but attempted to stretch it into a triple. An alert Jeter called for the ball at second and tossed to Mark Teixeira who was covering second, since Robinson Canó was in the outfield, to tag Abreu for the out. For the second consecutive time in the series, the Yankees and Angels played extra innings. The Angels loaded the bases with one out in the tenth inning against Mariano Rivera, but were unable to score. In the bottom of the 11th inning, Yankees pitcher David Robertson retired the two Angels batters he faced and was one out away from forcing a 12th inning when manager Joe Girardi replaced him with Alfredo Aceves, a decision that would later be criticized by the New York media. Aceves, who yielded a go-ahead run to the Angels in the 11th inning of Game 2 that was later erased by Rodriguez' home run, yielded a single to Kendrick on a 3–1 count. Jeff Mathis, the Angels' backup catcher who was inserted into the game in the eighth inning, followed with a double to deep left field, scoring Kendrick from first and winning the game in a walk-off. =Game 4= Tuesday, October 20, 2009 — 7:57 PM (ET) at Angel Stadium of Anaheim in Anaheim, California Yankees ace CC Sabathia started Game 4 on three days' rest, which proved to be no problem, as he pitched eight strong innings, allowing only one earned run on a home run by Kendrys Morales in the fifth, five hits, and two walks, while striking out five. For the fourth straight game in the series the Yankees scored first. With runners on second and third and one out, Robinson Cano hit into a fielder's choice to score Alex Rodriguez. After a walk loaded the bases, Melky Cabrera's two-run single made it 3–0 Yankees. Next inning, Mark Teixeira hit a leadoff single and Angels' starter Scott Kazmir was relieved by Jason Bulger, who allowed a two-run home run to Rodriguez, tying a postseason record set by Lou Gehrig and Ryan Howard for recording an RBI in eight consecutive games. In the eighth, Cabrera walked off of Ervin Santana who was relieved by Matt Palmer. Johnny Damon's home run made it 7–1 Yankees. Rodriguez doubled to lead off the ninth and scored on Jorge Posada's sacrifice fly. One out later, Robinson Cano walked and Brett Gardner singled before both scored on a double by Cabrera, giving him four RBIs. Chad Gaudin relieved Sabathia in the bottom of the ninth and retired the Angels in order as the Yankees were one win away from their first World Series since 2003. The game included three controversial calls by the umpiring crew that third base umpire and crew chief Tim McClelland—who made two of the three calls in question—admitted were in error, drawing more attention to the argument for instant replay in baseball. =Game 5= Thursday, October 22, 2009 — 7:57 PM (ET) at Angel Stadium of Anaheim in Anaheim, California Unlike the previous four games, this time the Angels scored first. With Chone Figgins on third base and Bobby Abreu on first, Torii Hunter singled to center field, scoring both Figgins and Abreu. Hunter then scored on an RBI double by Vladimir Guerrero, followed by a Kendrys Morales RBI single that scored Guerrero from second. All this was done before the first out was recorded. From that point on, neither starter—John Lackey for the Angels and A. J. Burnett for the Yankees—allowed a run until the seventh inning. In the top half of that inning, Lackey worked into a bases-loaded jam with two outs when manager Mike Scioscia replaced him with Darren Oliver. Mark Teixeira connected with Oliver's first pitch for a double that scored all three inherited runners—Melky Cabrera, Jorge Posada, and Derek Jeter. After an intentional walk to Alex Rodriguez, Hideki Matsui singled, scoring Teixeira and tying the game. Oliver was replaced with Kevin Jepsen, who yielded a triple to Robinson Canó that scored Rodriguez and Matsui, giving the Yankees a two-run lead. In the bottom half of the seventh, Abreu hit an RBI groundout that scored Jeff Mathis from third. Hunter then drew a walk, followed by a Guerrero single that scored Erick Aybar, and a Morales single that scored Hunter, giving the Angels a one-run lead. The Yankees threatened Angels closer Brian Fuentes in the ninth inning. With two outs, Fuentes loaded the bases, but Nick Swisher popped out to end the game. =Game 6= New York Yankees celebrate after their 5–2 win against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Sunday, October 25, 2009 — 8:20 PM (ET) at Yankee Stadium in Bronx, New York Game 6 was originally scheduled to be played on Saturday, October 24, but was postponed because of rain. Angels gaffes once again proved costly. In the top of the second, baserunner Vladimir Guerrero ran too far from first base on a fly ball out and was doubled off. The game remained scoreless until the top of the third inning when Bobby Abreu singled home Jeff Mathis, who singled to lead off and moved to second on a groundout, to give the Angels the early lead. The Yankees left six men on base in the first and second innings before they finally broke through in the bottom of the fourth after Johnny Damon lined a two-run single with the bases loaded off of Joe Saunders to give them the lead for the remainder of the game. A single reloaded the bases before Alex Rodriguez walked to force in another run. Saunders was then removed in favor of Darren Oliver, who pitched shutout innings. Andy Pettitte pitched a strong game, allowing one run in innings while striking out six. Mariano Rivera entered the game in the eighth inning for a six-out save. Chone Figgins hit a leadoff single in the eighth, moved to second on a groundout and scored on a Guerrero single with two outs to close the gap to 3–2. In the bottom of the eighth, Robinson Cano drew a leadoff walk off of Ervin Santana, who was relieved by Scott Kazmir. The Angels misfielded two sacrifice bunts by the Yankees, a fielding error by Howie Kendrick and a throwing error by pitcher Scott Kazmir, allowing a run to score. A walk loaded the bases before Mark Teixeira's sacrifice fly made it 5–2 Yankees. Rivera retired the side in the ninth to record the Yankees' 40th American League pennant. =Composite box= 2009 ALCS (4–2): New York Yankees over Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Notes External links *2009 ALCS at Baseball-Reference *2009 ALCS at ESPN American League Championship Series Category:American League Championship Series Category:Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim postseason Category:New York Yankees postseason Category:2009 in sports in California Category:2009 in sports in New York City Category:21st century in Anaheim, California Category:October 2009 sports events in the United States ","title":"2009 American League Championship Series"},{"id":"23104823","text":"The 2009 National League Championship Series (NLCS) was a best-of-seven baseball game series pitting the Los Angeles Dodgers against the Philadelphia Phillies for the National League Championship and the right to represent the National League in the 2009 World Series. The Phillies defeated the Dodgers four games to one. Los Angeles, whose NL-best 95–67 record topped Philadelphia's 93–69 record, retained home-field advantage. The series, the 40th in league history, began on October 15 and finished on October 21. TBS carried the championship on television. The Phillies won the series, four games to one, advancing to the World Series for the second consecutive year. They were, however, defeated by the New York Yankees, 4-2\\\\. This was the second consecutive NLCS between the Dodgers and Phillies and the fifth overall. The first two meetings were won by the Dodgers in 1977 and 1978, and the third by the Phillies in 1983; none of the three resulted in a World Series Championship by either team. The Phillies defeated the Dodgers in five games in 2008 en route to their 2008 World Series title. This match-up is the most frequent in the history of the NLCS (as of 2009) tied with the Pirates vs Reds. In 2009, the Dodgers won the regular season series, four games to three, outscoring the Phillies 26–25. The Phillies would go on to lose to the New York Yankees in the World Series in six games. Summary =Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Philadelphia Phillies= Game summaries =Game 1= Thursday, October 15, 2009 — 8:07 PM (ET) at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California James Loney gave the Dodgers an early lead with a solo home run in the second inning. Dodger starter Clayton Kershaw was solid through the first four innings, but the Phillie got to him in the fifth, scoring five runs on three hits on a Carlos Ruiz three-run home run, and later a Ryan Howard two-RBI double. The Dodgers made up most of the deficit in the bottom half of the fifth when Andre Ethier reached base on a Chase Utley throwing error that scored Russell Martin, immediately followed by a Manny Ramirez two-run home run. With the Phillies ahead by one run in the top of the eighth, Philadelphia outfielder Raúl Ibañez padded his team's lead with a three-run home run off George Sherrill, his former teammate in Seattle, after two leadoff walks. The Dodgers scored two runs in the bottom half of the eighth on Martin's RBI single and a Rafael Furcal sacrifice fly, but Ryan Madson shut down the eighth-inning rally and Brad Lidge, despite allowing a hit and a walk, pitched a scoreless ninth to earn the save. =Game 2= Friday, October 16, 2009 — 4:07 PM (ET) at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California Game 2 featured a pitching duel between Vicente Padilla and Pedro Martinez, two pitchers who were not even on their respective teams' Opening Day rosters. Martinez pitched seven innings of scoreless ball and Padilla nearly matched him with of one-run ball. The only run came on a Ryan Howard solo shot in the fourth. That RBI gave Howard six for the post-season, which tied the record for a span of six post-season games. However, in the eighth the Phillies bullpen ran into trouble when Casey Blake singled to start off the inning and Ronnie Belliard bunted for a hit. On a 3–2 pitch Russell Martin grounded into a tailor-made double play to Pedro Feliz, but Chase Utley threw the ball away which allowed the Dodgers' first run of the game. It was Utley's second error in two games; he had just three in 156 games during the 2009 regular season. Scott Eyre relieved Chan Ho Park and allowed a single to Jim Thome. Ryan Madson then walked Rafael Furcal to load the bases and struck out Matt Kemp, but Andre Ethier drew a walk-off of J. A. Happ which scored the go-ahead run to win the game for the Dodgers. Five relievers were used in the bottom of the eighth. Jonathan Broxton closed out the game and the Dodgers evened the series 1–1. =Game 3= Sunday, October 18, 2009 — 8:07 PM (ET) at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Philadelphia jumped out early against Hiroki Kuroda in the first from the two-run triple by Ryan Howard. The next batter, Jayson Werth, hit a two-run shot into the hedges behind the center-field fence. Next inning, Carlos Ruiz hit a leadoff double and scored on Jimmy Rollins's one-out double to knock Kuroda out of the game. Scott Elbert in relief walked two to load the bases before Howard's groundout made it 6–0 Phillies. They added two more runs in the fifth off of Chad Billingsley when Raul Ibanez walked with two outs and scored on a triple by Pedro Feliz, who then scored on a Carlos Ruiz single. Three more were added in the eighth thanks to a three-run homer by Shane Victorino off of Ronald Belisario. Pitcher Cliff Lee held the Dodgers to three hits and had ten strikeouts in eight innings of work. With the large lead in hand, Lee batted in the bottom of the eighth stroking a single and scoring on the Victorino home run, but he did not start the ninth inning. Chad Durbin retired the Dodgers in order that inning to give the Phillies a 2–1 series lead. =Game 4= Monday, October 19, 2009 — 8:07 PM (ET) at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania The Phillies once again jumped out to an early lead in the first inning when Ryan Howard hit a two-run home run off Dodgers starter Randy Wolf. As a result, Howard tied Lou Gehrig's record of most consecutive postseason games with an RBI, at eight. The Dodgers tied the game in the top of the fourth inning when Phillies starter Joe Blanton allowed RBI singles to James Loney and Russell Martin. The Dodgers took the lead in the fifth inning on a Matt Kemp solo home run, and tacked on another run in the sixth on an RBI hit by Casey Blake to make it 4–2. Chase Utley answered in the bottom of the sixth with an RBI single of his own, cutting the Dodger lead to 4–3, which is where it would stand until the ninth inning. Jonathan Broxton, trying to work a four-out save for the Dodgers, retired Raúl Ibañez to start the ninth inning. He then walked Matt Stairs and hit Carlos Ruiz. After a Greg Dobbs line out to third base, Jimmy Rollins stepped to the plate with runners on first and second base with two outs. On a 1–1 count, Rollins hit a line drive into the right-center field gap, easily scoring pinch runner Eric Bruntlett and Ruiz, giving the Phillies a 5–4 walk-off win. It was later reported that Manny Ramirez hit the showers before the game was over. =Game 5= Philadelphia Phillies celebrate after their 10–4 win against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Wednesday, October 21, 2009 — 8:07 PM (ET) at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania The Dodgers went up 1–0 in the first inning after Cole Hamels gave up a solo home run to Andre Ethier. The Phillies came right back in the bottom of the first after Jayson Werth deposited a three-run home run into the right field seats off of Vicente Padilla. In the second, James Loney's leadoff home run made it 3–2 Phillies, but in the bottom half, Pedro Feliz's leadoff home run gave the Phillies that run back. In the fourth, Jayson Werth hit a leadoff single and scored on Raul Ibanez's double, knocking Padilla out of the game. A walk and hit-by-pitch from Ramon Troncoso loaded the bases. George Sherrill hit Shane Victorino with a pitch to force in another run. Orlando Hudson's home run in the fifth made it 6–3 Phillies and Rafael Furcal's double knocked Hamels out of the game. In the sixth, Victorino's home run after a hit-by-pitch off of Clayton Kershaw made it 8–3 Phillies. Jayson Werth's home run next inning off of Hong-Chih Kuo made it 9–3 Phillies. In the eighth, Chan Ho Park allowed two leadoff singles, then Ryan Madson walked Manny Ramirez to load the bases with no outs before Matt Kemp's RBI single made it 9–4 Phillies. Madson, though, retired the next three batters to end the inning and the Phillies got that run back in the bottom half when Chase Utley scored on a wild pitch from Ronald Belisario. Brad Lidge retired the Dodgers in order in the ninth to seal the Phillies' 10–4 win and advance them to the World Series. =Composite box= 2009 NLCS (4–1): Philadelphia Phillies over Los Angeles Dodgers Notes External links *2009 NLCS at Baseball-Reference *2009 NLCS at ESPN National League Championship Series Category:National League Championship Series Category:Los Angeles Dodgers postseason Category:Philadelphia Phillies postseason Category:2009 in sports in California Category:2009 in sports in Pennsylvania Category:2009 in Los Angeles Category:2009 in Philadelphia Category:October 2009 sports events in the United States ","title":"2009 National League Championship Series"},{"id":"23104845","text":"St David's Welsh Church, Colwyn Bay (Eglwys Dewi Sant) is in Rhiw Road, Colwyn Bay, Conwy County Borough, Wales.

Three divisional winners and a \\"wild card\\" team played in the two series. The ALDS began on Wednesday, October 7 and ended on Sunday, October 11. The matchups were: * (1) New York Yankees (East division champions, 103–59) vs. (3) Minnesota Twins (Central division champions, 87–76): Yankees win series, 3–0. * (2) Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (West division champions, 97–65) vs. (4) Boston Red Sox (Wild Card qualifier, 95–67): Angels win series, 3–0. The Twins and Detroit Tigers finished the 162-game schedule in a first-place tie atop the American League Central and played a one-game playoff at the Metrodome on Tuesday, October 6 that was won by the Twins, 6–5, in 12 innings, giving them the division championship and a postseason berth. The Yankees, by virtue of finishing with the best record in the American League, were given the choice of playing an eight-day series (with three off-days) or a seven-day series (with two off- days) and opted for the former. This is the third consecutive season—and the fourth since 2004—that the Angels and Red Sox have met in the ALDS. The Red Sox swept the Angels in 2004 and 2007, and defeated the Angels 3–1 in 2008. The Twins and Yankees last met in the postseason in the 2004 ALDS, which the Yankees won 3–1. The Angels and Yankees each swept their respective series in three games. Since the advent of division series play in 1995, this was the first time that the winners of both divisional series swept their opponents (Royals and Orioles swept both of their ALDS series in 2014, defeating the Angels and Tigers respectively). The Yankees went on to defeat the Angels 4-2 in the ALCS, and defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 4-2 to win the 2009 World Series. Game 3 of the Twins–Yankees series was the final Major League Baseball game at the Metrodome, as the Twins moved into their new home stadium, Target Field, starting with the 2010 season. TBS carried the tie breaker game and also televised all Division Series games in the United States. __TOC__ Matchups =New York Yankees vs. Minnesota Twins= =Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim vs. Boston Red Sox= New York vs. Minnesota =Game 1= 6:07 p.m. (ET) at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, New York In the first postseason game at the new Yankee Stadium, the Yankees rebounded from an early 2–0 deficit to take the first game of the series, 7–2, behind a strong outing from CC Sabathia and timely hitting by Derek Jeter, Nick Swisher, Alex Rodriguez, and Hideki Matsui. The Twins opened the scoring in the third by stringing together three consecutive two-out hits, including an RBI single by Michael Cuddyer. One batter later, a passed ball by Jorge Posada enabled Joe Mauer to score from third, giving the Twins a 2–0 lead. The Yankees answered in the bottom of the inning when Jeter smashed a two-run home run into the left field seats, and in the fourth, a two-out RBI double off the bat of Swisher put the Yankees in front for the first time of the night. One inning later, Rodriguez broke an 0-for-29 postseason skid with runners on base (dating back to the 2004 ALCS) by lining a two-out single to left center, scoring Jeter from second and knocking Twins starter Brian Duensing out of the game. Matsui then belted a two-run home run into Monument Park off reliever Francisco Liriano, making it 6–2 Yankees. Rodriguez added another RBI single in the seventh off of John Rauch with the run charged to Liriano to complete the scoring. Sabathia settled down after the third inning, striking out eight and limiting the Twins to two runs (one earned) and eight hits in innings of work. The Yankees bullpen then combined for innings of scoreless relief. =Game 2= 6:07 p.m. (ET) at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, New York Late-game heroics from Alex Rodriguez and Mark Teixeira powered the Yankees past the Twins in Game 2 for a commanding two-games-to-none series lead. The Twins' Nick Blackburn and Yankees' A. J. Burnett pitched five shutout innings each before Delmon Young walked with one out in the top of the sixth, stole second and scored on Brendan Harris's triple, but the Yankees tied the score in the bottom of the inning on Rodriguez's RBI single off of Blackburn. In the eighth, Phil Hughes allowed a two-out walk to Carlos Gomez, who moved to third on Harris's single and scored on Nick Punto's single. Mariano Rivera relieved Hughes and allowed an RBI single to Denard Span. With the Yankees trailing 3–1 in the bottom of the ninth, Teixeira led off with a single off Twins closer Joe Nathan, and Rodriguez followed with a dramatic game-tying two-run home run into the Yankee bullpen in right center. The Yankees threatened to win the game in the tenth, putting runners on first and third with one out, but Johnny Damon lined out to shortstop Orlando Cabrera and Brett Gardner was doubled off third to end the inning. In the top of the 11th the Twins mounted a threat of their own, beginning with a Joe Mauer base hit later in an at-bat in which he had already been denied a ground-rule double on a blown call by left field umpire Phil Cuzzi, who erroneously called Mauer's drive down the left field line foul. Replays showed the ball landed inside the foul line in fair territory. Two subsequent Twins hits moved baserunners up a single base and loaded the bases with nobody out, meaning that Cuzzi's officiating error possibly cost the Twins a run. Yankees reliever David Robertson was able to work out of the jam, bringing the total number of runners left on base by the Twins to 17. That set the stage for Teixeira, who opened the bottom of the frame by lining José Mijares' 2–1 pitch down the line and just over the left field wall for a walk- off home run. Teixeira's home run was the first of his postseason career and the first postseason walk-off home run by a Yankee since Aaron Boone's series- winner in Game 7 of the 2003 ALCS. =Game 3= 7:07 p.m. (ET) at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota Starters Carl Pavano and Andy Pettitte matched zeroes until the bottom of the sixth, when Joe Mauer singled off Pettitte with two on to put the Twins ahead 1–0. The Yankees seized the lead half an inning later on a pair of opposite field solo home runs by Alex Rodriguez and Jorge Posada. In the eighth, Nick Punto led off with a double off New York's Phil Hughes and Denard Span followed with an infield single, but Punto made a wide turn around third and was thrown out trying to get back to the bag, effectively ending the threat. In the top of the ninth, Ron Mahay, Jon Rauch and Jose Mijares walked three straight batters with one out before consecutive RBI singles by Jorge Posada and Robinson Cano off of Joe Nathan padded the Yankees' lead to 4–1. Mariano Rivera recorded the final four outs, earning the save and sending the Yankees on to the American League Championship Series in the Twins' final game at the Metrodome. =Composite box= 2009 ALDS (3–0): New York Yankees over Minnesota Twins Los Angeles vs. Boston =Game 1= 9:37 p.m. (ET) at Angel Stadium of Anaheim in Anaheim, California Game 1 started off as a pitchers' duel between Los Angeles' John Lackey and Boston's Jon Lester. Each starter gave up four hits; however, one of the hits given up by Lester was a three-run home run by Torii Hunter in the fifth inning that proved to be all the run support Lackey needed. In the seventh, Ramon Ramirez loaded the bases for the Angels on a walk, hit-by-pitch and single with no outs. Takashi Saito in relief allowed a two-out Kendry Morales RBI single that scored Vladimir Guerrero and Juan Rivera. Lackey pitched shutout innings while Darren Oliver pitched shutout innings. This was the first time the Red Sox had been shut out in postseason play since Game 2 of the 1995 ALDS, and the first ever shutout by Angels pitching in the postseason. =Game 2= 9:37 p.m. (ET) at Angel Stadium of Anaheim in Anaheim, California The Red Sox scored their first run of the series when Jacoby Ellsbury tripled to lead off the fourth and scored on Victor Martinez's single. However, they did not score again while the Angels tied the game in the bottom half on Kendrys Morales's sacrifice fly with two on. The Angels broke the tie with three runs in the seventh to hand Josh Beckett his first loss in nine postseason starts since Game 3 of the 2003 World Series. Vladimir Guerrero drew a leadoff walk and pinch runner Howie Kendrick stole second, then Maicer Izturis broke the deadlock with an RBI single and, after Mike Napoli was hit by a pitch, Erick Aybar's two-run triple over center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury's head chased Beckett from the game two batters later. Angels starter Jered Weaver continued in the footsteps of Game 1 starter John Lackey with a masterful performance, striking out seven while limiting the Red Sox offense to one run on two hits and two walks in innings. =Game 3= 12:07 p.m. (ET) at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts The Angels stunned the Red Sox and the Fenway crowd with two runs in the eighth and three in the ninth, overcoming late-inning deficits of 5–2 and 6–4 to sweep the series and advance to the American League Championship Series. Scott Kazmir started for Los Angeles and was largely ineffective, surrendering five runs on five hits and three walks in six innings. The Red Sox struck first in the third when a one-out walk and subsequent single was followed by a two-run double by Dustin Pedroia, who scored on Victor Martinez's single to put them up 3–0. After the Angels got on the board in the fifth on Kendrys Morales's home run, J. D. Drew hit a two-run home run in the bottom half that gave Boston what seemed like a comfortable 5–1 lead. The Angels chipped away against Boston starter Clay Buchholz in the sixth, putting runners on first and third with none out before Kendrys Morales grounded into a run-scoring 5–4–3 double play. Red Sox reliever Billy Wagner worked into a second-and- third, two-out jam in the eighth, prompting manager Terry Francona to summon Jonathan Papelbon from the bullpen for a four-out save. Juan Rivera greeted Papelbon by lining his first pitch to right center for a two-run single, momentarily making it a 5–4 game, but Boston added an insurance run in the bottom of the inning off of Kevin Jepsen when David Ortiz singled with two outs and was replaced by pinch runner Joey Gathright, who stole second and scored on Mike Lowell's single. Papelbon retired the first two batters in the top of the ninth, but Erick Aybar kept the inning alive with a two-strike single. After Chone Figgins worked a walk, Bobby Abreu, also down to his final strike, doubled off the Green Monster to score Aybar from second. Torii Hunter then received an intentional walk, loading the bases for Vladimir Guerrero. Guerrero ripped Papelbon's first pitch for a two-run single to center, putting the Angels ahead 7–6. Closer Brian Fuentes retired the Red Sox in order in the bottom of the inning for the save. =Composite box= 2009 ALDS (3–0): Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim over Boston Red Sox Notes External links *NYY vs. MIN at Baseball-Reference *LAA vs. BOS at Baseball-Reference *LAA vs. BOS at ESPN *NYY vs. MIN at ESPN American League Division Series Category:American League Division Series Category:New York Yankees postseason Category:Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim postseason Category:Boston Red Sox postseason Category:Minnesota Twins postseason Category:2009 in sports in California Category:2009 in sports in Massachusetts Category:2009 in sports in Minnesota Category:2009 in sports in New York City Category:21st century in Anaheim, California Category:2009 in Boston Category:2000s in Minneapolis Category:October 2009 sports events in the United States ","title":"2009 American League Division Series"},{"id":"23104890","text":"This is a list of public parks in Dubai.

Los Angeles starter Randy Wolf loaded the bases with no outs in the first inning, but allowed just one run on Ryan Ludwick's one-out single. In the bottom half of the inning, St. Louis starter Chris Carpenter gave up a two-run home run to Matt Kemp, giving the Dodgers a lead they would never relinquish. In the third, they put runners on first and second on a walk and hit-by-pitch before Casey Blake's RBI single put them up 3–1. The Cardinals cut the lead back to one in the fourth when Colby Rasmus drew a leadoff walk, moved to second on a groundout and scored on Skip Schumaker's double. In the fifth, Rafael Furcal's sacrifice fly with runners on second and third made it 4–2 Dodgers. Next inning, Kyle McClellan hit Russell Martin with a pitch with the bases loaded to force in another run, charged to Dennys Reyes, for the Dodgers. In the top of the ninth, Jonathan Broxton allowed a one-out single to Ryan Ludwick, who scored on Mark DeRosa's two-out double, before striking out Rick Ankiel looking to end the game and give the Dodgers a 1–0 series lead. Los Angeles slugger Manny Ramirez was held to 1-for-4 with one walk, while St. Louis slugger Albert Pujols was 0-for-3 with two intentional walks. The game ran 3:54 which made it the longest nine-inning postseason game in history: however, the record was broken four days later by the Rockies and Phillies. =Game 2= 6:07 p.m. (ET) at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California In an amazing pitching duel, Game 2 was dominated by Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright and Dodgers phenom Clayton Kershaw, who was pitching in his first career postseason start. In the second inning, Matt Holliday hit a home run to put the Cardinals ahead 1–0, but Dodger slugger Andre Ethier hit his first career post-season homer to tie it up 1–1 in the bottom of the fourth, the first hit Wainwright allowed. Wainwright dominated throughout his start, retiring the first 11 hitters he faced, while Kershaw kept pitching in and out of trouble. In the seventh inning, a double by Colby Rasmus with no outs scored Mark DeRosa to put St. Louis ahead 2–1, but Rasmus was thrown out at third base, which ended up being a huge play. At the time, it seemed to be enough to allow Wainwright to pitch to victory; in the eighth inning, however, he pitched into a bases-loaded jam. With two outs, Game 1 hero Matt Kemp grounded out to Albert Pujols to end the threat, and going into the ninth inning, Cardinal closer Ryan Franklin was brought in with one out. After retiring Manny Ramirez, Dodger first baseman James Loney hit a fly ball to Holliday, who lost the ball in the lights and it hit off his belly, allowing Loney to reach second on the error. After a walk to Casey Blake, mid-season acquisition Ronnie Belliard hit a clutch two-out single to score pinch runner Juan Pierre to tie the game, and after Russell Martin walked to load the bases, veteran pinch hitter Mark Loretta, who was 0-for-15 career against Franklin, hit a walk-off single to center field to score Blake and the Dodgers won the game in dramatic fashion, spoiling the gem by Wainwright and sending the series to St. Louis with a 2–0 LA advantage. =Game 3= 6:07 p.m. (ET) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri The Dodgers swept the Cardinals 3–0, and went on to go face the Phillies in a NLCS rematch. Vicente Padilla silenced the Cardinals' bats again by pitching dominantly, allowing no runs on four hits through seven innings. The 47,296 attendance was the largest crowd to see a game at Busch Stadium since it opened in 2006. In the top of the first, Matt Kemp singled with one out off of Joel Piñeiro and scored on Manny Ramirez's two-out double. In the third, Andre Ethier's two-run home run made it 3–0 Dodgers. Next inning, Ronnie Belliard hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a groundout, and scored on Rafael Furcal's two-out single. In the seventh, Ethier tripled with two outs off of John Smoltz and scored on Ramirez's single. The Cardinals scored their only run of the game in the eighth when Julio Lugo walked off of George Sherrill, stole second and scored on Albert Pujols's single off of Jonathan Broxton. Broxton pitched a scoreless ninth to seal the series for the Dodgers. =Composite line score= 2009 NLDS (3–0): Los Angeles Dodgers over St. Louis Cardinals Philadelphia vs. Colorado =Game 1= 2:37 p.m. (ET) at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Amidst strong, swirling winds at Citizens Bank Park, the Phillies cruised to a 5–1 victory behind a dominating performance from Cliff Lee. Philadelphia broke a scoreless tie in the bottom of the fifth when Jayson Werth drew a leadoff walk and scored on an RBI double by Raúl Ibañez, who scored two batters later on a single from Carlos Ruiz. Rockies starter Ubaldo Jiménez ran into more trouble in the sixth, giving up a leadoff single to Chase Utley, who stole second, then an RBI double to Jayson Werth and an RBI triple to Ryan Howard. Joe Beimel relieved Jimenez and allowed an RBI single to Ibanez. Lee, meanwhile, retired 16 straight Colorado batters from the second inning into the seventh, picking up the complete game win in his first career postseason start. Lee was one strike away from completing a shutout, but Troy Tulowitzki lined a two-out, two-strike double in the top of the ninth to plate the Rockies' only run. Actor Kevin Bacon and his brother Michael sang the national anthem before the game. =Game 2= 2:37 p.m. (ET) at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 2008 NLCS and World Series MVP Cole Hamels faced Rockies' starter Aaron Cook in Game 2\\\\. In the top of the first inning, the Rockies scored the first run of the game when Todd Helton hit a ball up the first base line that was misplayed by Hamels allowing Carlos Gonzalez to score from third. Rockies' catcher Yorvit Torrealba then hit a two-run home run off of Hamels in the fourth inning after he had not hit a home run since May 6. Next inning, Dexter Fowler's sacrifice fly with runners on second and third made it 4–0 Rockies. Hamels was then told his wife was going into labor and lifted for a pinch-hitter in the bottom of the fifth inning. The Phillies would fight back in the sixth. After consecutive hits by Shane Victorino and Chase Utley put runners on first and second with nobody out, Ryan Howard hit a line-drive double into the right field corner making the score 4–1 Rockies. Jose Contreras relieved Cook as Raúl Ibañez hit a one- out single to center field scoring two runs to cut the score to 4–3 Rockies. Pedro Feliz's single loaded the bases, but Carlos Ruiz grounded into an inning-ending double play. Charlie Manuel would use potential Game 3 starters Joe Blanton and J.A. Happ in the seventh, with Happ only throwing four pitches and leaving with an injury after being hit on the leg with a line drive. The Rockies loaded the bases off of them before Fowler's sacrifice fly off of Scott Eyre made it 5–3 Rockies. Jayson Werth hit a home run in the eighth inning off of Rafael Betancourt to once again close the Rockies lead to one, but Huston Street retired Shane Victorino with two runners on base with two outs in the ninth inning to send the series to Colorado tied 1–1. =Game 3= 10:07 p.m. (ET) at Coors Field in Denver, Colorado Game 3 was originally scheduled for October 10 at 9:37 p.m. Eastern, but was postponed due to snowy weather in the Denver area. The city received two inches of snow by Saturday morning, and forecasts called for a game-time temperature of . The October 10 low was , breaking a record set in 1905. This normally would not have been a problem due to Coors Field's underground heating system, and the Rockies have played in freezing conditions before. However, MLB began giving serious thought to postponing the game after hearing that the temperature would barely make it above freezing, and reports of icy roads and numerous accidents clinched the decision. This pushed Game 4 back to October 12, with Game 5, if necessary, to be played the next day in Philadelphia with no travel day. The temperature at game time (10:07 pm Eastern; 8:07 pm local) was and it dropped over the course of the game, which ended after midnight local time. At 4:06, this was the longest nine-inning postseason game ever (breaking a record set four days earlier by the Dodgers and Cardinals.) Chase Utley's two-out home run off of Jason Hammel made it 1–0 Phillies in the first, but in the bottom half, Todd Helton's RBI groundout after back-to-back leadoff singles off of J. A. Happ tied the score. After a single and strikeout, Garrett Atkins's RBI single put the Rockies up 2–1. In the third, Helton drew a leadoff walk and scored on Atkins's double to make it 3–1 Rockies, but in the fourth, a leadoff walk and single was followed by Ryan Howard's RBI single. Hammel then walked two to load the bases and force in another run to tie the game. After a double play, Carlos Ruiz's RBI single put the Phillies up 4–3, but Carlos Gonzalez's home run in the bottom of the inning off of Joe Blanton tied the game. In the sixth, back-to-back one-out walks off of Jose Contreras were followed by Ruiz's RBI single that put the Phillies up 5–4. In the bottom of the seventh, Scott Eyre allowed a leadoff double and subsequent single before being relieved by Ryan Madson, who allowed a one-out sacrifice fly to Troy Tulowitzki to tie the game. In the ninth, Ryan Howard's sacrifice fly with two on off of Huston Street put the Phillies up 6–5. Brad Lidge pitched a scoreless bottom half despite allowing two walks to give the Phillies a 2–1 series lead. =Game 4= 6:07 p.m. (ET) at Coors Field in Denver, Colorado Game 4 was originally scheduled to start on Game 3's date and start time, but due to the Saturday postponement was pushed back to Monday with first pitch at 4:07 Mountain Time. With an extra day of rest, both teams pitched their aces in a rematch of Game 1\\\\. The Phillies quickly struck in the first, as the second batter of the game, Shane Victorino, hit a home run into the Rockies bullpen. Jimenez would settle down, virtually matching the Phillies' Cliff Lee the rest of the way, his only other run coming on a Jayson Werth homer in the sixth. Lee wasn't as dominant as he was in Game 1, but held the Rockies at bay until the sixth when Troy Tulowitzki doubled home Todd Helton to cut the Phillies lead to 2–1. Jimenez pitched seven innings before giving way to Franklin Morales. The Phillies would load the bases in the eighth with one out, but Rafael Betancourt would get a pop out and strikeout to keep Philadelphia from adding to their lead. With one out in the bottom of the inning, Lee walked Dexter Fowler. Helton then bounced what looked like a tailor-made double play ground ball to Chase Utley. Fowler, to avoid running into him, jumped and hurdled over Utley, whose throw to second was wide and an error. Lee was pulled and a double switch was made, Ryan Madson in to pitch, Ben Francisco in left field. Tulowitzki promptly stepped up and hit a shallow fly to left that Francisco made a diving catch on to rob the Rockies of the potential tying run. Jason Giambi pinch hit, and on the first pitch punched a game-tying single to left. Yorvit Torrealba followed by hitting a two-run double over the head of Victorino, giving the Rockies their first lead. In the ninth Colorado again turned to Street, the losing pitcher in Game 3\\\\. This time he opened the inning by striking out pinch hitter Greg Dobbs, prompting Ryan Howard to tell his teammates to \\"get me to the plate, boys.\\" Jimmy Rollins, though, as he did the previous night, singled. After Victorino bounced into a fielder's choice that saw Rollins forced out at second, Utley stepped up and went down 2–2 in the count. He would, however, work a walk to bring go-ahead run Ryan Howard to the plate. On a 2–1 pitch, Howard belted a double to the wall in right field, tying the game. Werth followed with a bloop single to shallow right on a 2–2 pitch as the Phillies matched the Rockies' three-run rally with one of their own to retake the lead. Colorado would threaten again in the ninth against Scott Eyre. With one out, Carlos Gonzalez singled, tying him with Dante Bichette for the club record for hits in the Division Series at ten. Following a Fowler lineout, Helton singled up middle. Brad Lidge was again summoned from the bullpen and faced Tulowitzki in a rematch of the previous night's final at-bat. Having looked at two sliders, and barely checked his swing on another, Lidge threw Tulowitzki a 2–2 slider. This time Tulowitzki could not check his swing, striking out to end the game, and sending the Phillies to the NLCS with a three-games-to-one series victory. It also marked the first time in Division Series history that all four series winners clinched on the road, as the Dodgers, Angels and Yankees all had completed sweeps on the road previously. =Composite line score= 2009 NLDS (3–1): Philadelphia Phillies over Colorado Rockies Notes External links *LAD vs. STL at Baseball-Reference *COL vs. PHI at Baseball-Reference *LAD vs. STL at ESPN *COL vs. PHI at ESPN National League Division Series Category:National League Division Series Category:Philadelphia Phillies postseason Category:St. Louis Cardinals postseason Category:Los Angeles Dodgers postseason Category:Colorado Rockies postseason National League Division Series National League Division Series National League Division Series National League Division Series Category:21st century in Denver Category:2009 in Los Angeles Category:2009 in Philadelphia Category:2000s in St. Louis Category:October 2009 sports events in the United States ","title":"2009 National League Division Series"},{"id":"23104917","text":"Isogenic may refer to: *Zygosity *Isogenic human disease models  See also  * Isogenous (disambiguation) ","title":"Isogenic"},{"id":"23104944","text":"Lamina basalis can refer to: * Basal lamina (extracellular matrix layer) * Basal plate (placenta) * Basal plate (neural tube) * Bruch's membrane (lamina basalis choroideae) ","title":"Lamina basalis"},{"id":"23104948","text":"Jagdgeschwader 134 (JG 134) \\"Horst Wessel\\" was a Luftwaffe fighter-wing prior to World War II.

It was the first full- sized planetarium in Africa, and the second in the southern hemisphere. History The idea of setting up a planetarium in Johannesburg was first discussed in 1956 when the Festival Committee — which had been instituted to organise the celebrations of Johannesburg's seventieth anniversary — decided to raise the funds necessary to buy and house a Zeiss planetarium to be set up for the celebrations. As there was too little time to obtain a new instrument, it was decided to buy an existing planetarium projector from Europe. After lengthy negotiations, the Festival Committee was successful in persuading the Parliament of Hamburg to sell their planetarium's projector which had been in use there since 1930. The Hamburg Parliament, however, imposed as its conditions that the planetarium's projector be fully modernised in the Zeiss factory at Oberkochen, and that Johannesburg would in due course have a new planetarium built for Hamburg. The Hamburg projector was immediately dismantled and moved to Oberkochen for an overhaul, and was in time completely rebuilt. Soon, the responsibilities of the Festival Committee were taken over by the Johannesburg City Council, which after further negotiations, sold the projector to the University of the Witwatersrand for use as both an academic facility for the instruction of students, and as a public amenity. Plans for a new building to house the projector were first drawn up in 1958, and construction began in 1959. The planetarium finally opened on 12 October 1960. The Johannesburg Planetarium is often consulted by the media, and the public, in order to explain unusual occurrences in the skies over South Africa. In 2010, the Johannesburg Planetarium celebrated its golden jubilee.

Mitchell (August 3, 1903 – April 23, 1974) was an American attorney and Democratic Party official. He served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 1952 to 1956, and was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for Governor of Illinois in 1960. Early life and career Mitchell was born August 3, 1903 in Rock Valley, Iowa, the son of a dairyman who had a small banking business. He graduated pre-law at Creighton University in 1926, and took a job in Washington D.C. as a credit and sales manager for GMAC (now Ally Financial) while attending law school at night at Georgetown University. He practiced law in Chicago from 1932 to 1942, returning to Washington as a Senate committee counsel. Political activist Mitchell helped Adlai Stevenson enter politics, and helped manage his successful gubernatorial run. In 1952, after being selected as the Democratic candidate for president, Stevenson designated Mitchell as chairman of the DNC. When Republican vice presidential candidate Senator Richard Nixon was disclosed to have had a private fund reimburse him for his political expenses, Mitchell called for Nixon's resignation from the ticket, a demand that \\"recoiled\\" on him with the massive public wave of support for Nixon following the Checkers speech, in which Mitchell's demand was referred to and he himself mentioned by name. While the Democratic ticket was defeated in a landslide in 1952, Mitchell worked with Stevenson to pay off the party's massive campaign debt and work toward recapturing control of Congress in 1954. He was successful on both counts. It would take the Republicans 26 years to recapture the Senate and 40 years to recapture the House of Representatives. He also put in place new rules to ensure that Democratic party officials would either have to support the ticket or resign—which had been a problem in 1952, with some Democrats reluctant to oppose Republican presidential candidate General Dwight Eisenhower. Later life Mitchell left the DNC in 1956, and in 1960 made an unsuccessful run for governor from Illinois. He was defeated in the Democratic primary in a crushing defeat, losing to Otto Kerner, Jr., receiving 17%, though he attracted 185,000 votes. In 1968, he worked as a campaign advisor for Senator Eugene McCarthy's presidential run in the lead-up to the 1968 Democratic National Convention. He died in Washington DC in 1974.

Zara was introduced as the new general practitioner at The Mill on 4 June 2009, and remained a regular until April 2012 when Walsh left to go on maternity leave. She returned for a brief appearance in December 2012, before returning full-time in February 2013. In September 2015, Dermot Walsh left again to go on maternity leave. She returned full-time from March 2016 onwards. Zara has been involved in a number of different storylines including being kidnapped, dealing with early menopause, the birth of her son, her relationship with Daniel Granger (Matthew Chambers), and her feud with stepdaughter Izzie Torres (Bethan Moore). For her portrayal of Zara, Walsh won the award for Best Female Acting Performance at the 2015 RTS Midlands Awards. Storylines Zara first appears in June 2009 when Heston Carter (Owen Brenman), Julia Parsons (Diane Keen) and Lily Hassan (Seeta Indrani) are interviewing for a new GP. Zara arrives at The Mill and is introduced. Daniel Granger (Matthew Chambers) flirts with her, and Zara turns up at Daniel's apartment. The pair have sex, but Zara ends the relationship right after, stating that they needed to get it out of the way before they could work together. After being kidnapped with Jack Hollins (Nicolas Woodman), the pair have sex. After an ongoing affair, eventually Jack told his dad, Rob Hollins (Chris Walker) that he had been in a relationship with Zara. Karen Hollins (Jan Pearson) confronted Zara, and as she was doing this, Zara bent over to pick something up and Karen noticed her underwear was the same of what she found weeks ago in Jack's room. Karen then got very angry and called Zara a \\"slut, whore and paedophile\\", and the pair had a fight in reception. Zara begins a relationship with Matthew (Nicholas Shaw) and when his mother, Judith, (Caroline Langrishe) arrives in Letherbridge, she thinks that Zara is familiar with her and knows her from somewhere else. Zara denies this, but it is later revealed that they have met previously. Zara asks Daniel to use his charm on Judith when she comes for Botox treatment in his clinic. Afterwards, Zara asks Daniel to seduce Judith and have sex with her, to which he declines this immediately. After months of dates and casual sex, Zara and Daniel become a couple. Zara then starts having hot flushes and menopausal symptoms, and realises she is undergoing early menopause. Zara believes Daniel wants to end the relationship a couple of days later, so she ends it first. Daniel traps Zara in her office and they get back together. Daniel and Zara try IVF, and are left devastated when they discover it has not worked and she is not pregnant. Zara begins showing the signs of pregnancy, and Daniel rushes out to a chemist; when he returns, Zara is sitting on the bed with a pregnancy test in her hands. After Daniel tells her that he loves her, she reveals the results of the test, and both she and Daniel are overjoyed to discover that she is pregnant. Zara goes into premature labour at the Mill, with only Cherry Clay (Sophie Abelson) and Kevin Tyler (Simon Rivers) around to help her. Zara gives birth to a baby boy named Joe (Emily and Lewis Whitehouse). Daniel arrives shortly after and Zara, Daniel and their baby are taken to hospital. After much debate regarding the welfare of their new baby leaving the safety of the hospital, they return home. After discovering that Daniel had slept with Cherry, Zara ends the relationship with him, and leaves with Joe in August 2012. Zara returns in December 2012 for a meeting with Howard Bellamy (Ian Kelsey). As she is about to leave once again, she is persuaded to talk to Daniel, she reveals that she now has a job in Bristol and sees no reason to come back and leaves once again. She returns once again after leaving her job in Bristol, and returns to work in The Mill. She warms towards Daniel once again the following month, Daniel later discovers that she is dating another man named Dutch. After giving Dutch the third degree, Daniel admits to Zara that he misses everything about her which scares Dutch off, although Zara is initially furious with Daniel for his interference they then fall back into each other's arms. However, as they start meeting up for liaisons again, Zara reveals that she will be setting strict time limits on their time together and will not be letting Daniel spend any extra time with Joe. They later resume their relationship. Zara later takes a sabbatical from The Mill in September 2015 and at her leaving party she gives a speech, and tells them all to count down the days until she returns. Zara nervously returns to The Mill and is impressed by new boss Anthony Harker (Adam Astill). Zara catches up with Karen over lunch and is amazed to hear about Valerie Pitman (Sarah Moyle) and Barry Biglow's (David Perks) wedding and launches into a tirade about what an evolutionary disaster their children would be. Karen is reassured that the old Zara is definitely back. Daniel and Zara attempt to spice up their love life, and go to a bar to role play but they argue and Zara goes outside. While outside, Zara witnesses a stabbing and chooses to give evidence. During this time, Joe is kidnapped, and the family have to be protected by the police due to the possibility of violence and threats from gang members who were involved in the murder. Daniel blames Zara for risking the safety of their family for the sake of assisting with the investigation. In 2018, following some ups and downs with other staff, Daniel and Zara become the only partners at The Mill Health Centre. Daniel's daughter, Izzie Torres (Bethan Moore) comes to stay with them after arguing with her mother. Zara is still traumatised from the threats and kidnapping of Joe. She struggles to get on with Izzie, who does not express interest in getting to know her. On one occasion, Izzie takes Joe to the shop without telling Zara. When she sees that they are missing, she panics and phones Daniel and the police. Izzie returns while Zara is broken down by the front door, and slaps Izzie. Daniel moves out and does not communicate with Zara about his plans. At the 2018 Christmas party, Emma convinces Zara to go to take her mind off Daniel's absence. Zara gets drunk and Sid Vere (Ashley Rice) comes back to her house and they have sex. Daniel returns home and sees them. He does not confront them, but later confronts her and punches Sid. Zara tries for some time to convince Daniel to give her another chance. He finally agrees and moves back in but their relationship is strained and they decide to split up. In 2019, Daniel begins a relationship with practice manager Becky Clarke (Ali Bastian), which Zara has trouble adjusting to. However, while attending a medical conference at a hotel, Zara and Daniel sleep together in a hotel room. Zara enters a relationship with Adam Regan (Edward MacLiam), and while waiting for him to come home from work, his twin brother Gareth (Edward MacLiam) pretends to be Adam, and tries to rape Zara. She fights him off, spraying hairspray in his eyes and stabbing him in the leg with the heels of her shoe, and calls the police. Due to her seeing Gareth's face when she looks at Adam, she ends the relationship. With both of their partners having left Letherbridge, Zara and Daniel begin their relationship again. Creation =Characterisation= Speaking of Zara, Walsh said in an interview with OK! magazine: \\"I think it would be fair to call Zara a bit of a handful! She's quite the volatile personality, and I grabbed the character with both hands. She’s been a bit of a home-wrecker in the past, but I like her; even when you’re playing a baddie, you have to play a baddie like you’re playing a heroine. She behaves appallingly. I don’t think I’d particularly want her as a friend, but she’d be a great fun ride if you’re with Zara!\\". =Personality= Asked if she prefers playing Zara's bitchier moments or her more vulnerable side, Walsh replied: \\"Well, nothing beats a good putdown line or a bitchy comment! We have some brilliant writers, so Zara does get the last laugh so often. But that makes it all the more enjoyable when she doesn't get the last laugh and ends up with egg on her face. That only really works if she's had a few weeks of really getting away with everything, and then when it all goes wrong for her, she simply can't believe it!. She went on to say: \\"Equally with her vulnerable moments - I think they really work when there are fewer of them, because then they're more of a surprise. We see her hard exterior, but then we know that in private, she's just like the rest of us and is full of doubts and fears.\\" Development =Relationships= In September 2010, Walsh revealed details of an upcoming storyline involving Zara and Daniel Granger portrayed by Matthew Chambers. Speaking at the Inside Soap Awards she said: \\"There's a fantastic five-part story coming up in the next few weeks involving my character and Daniel. I don't want to give everything away, but something terrible happens to Daniel's baby daughter and Zara steps in to help. It's all very dramatic!\\" She added: \\"It's nice to be the good guy for a change. Normally Zara plays the baddie and for once she gets to play the heroine, which makes a nice change for me!\\" In June 2020, Walsh talked about Zara's relationship with Daniel on a live- streamed interview. She talked about a two-year arc that producer Peter Eryl Lloyd devised for Zara and Daniel, with the breakdown of their marriage, Zara sleeping with Sid Vere (Ashley Rice), their separate relationships, and their eventual reunion. She stated that she does not typically like to know about storylines in advance as it aids her to portray Zara's reaction to events naturally, but that it was useful to know the outcome for their relationship. She added that if their relationship was simple, it wouldn't be interesting for viewers. On their slow burn relationship, she stated that it was \\"exhausting but such a pleasure to play long form\\", and hinted that their reunion would be as complicated as their marriage breakdown. =Pregnancy= Speaking to Digital Spy, Walsh talked about how she prepared for Zara's labour scenes saying, \\"It was very daunting, really - especially as we know that so many people watching Doctors are people who are staying at home with their children. It will be fresh in their memories, so I didn't want to do it wrong! But of course, when you start researching, you discover that it's different for every woman - and if you ask people about giving birth, everybody will say something different. I've been preparing for it for a long time, though, as it's what my character has wanted ever since she came into the show. That was nearly three years ago, so to finally get the thing that I've played her as wanting for so long was quite emotional to shoot.\\" On calling the baby Joe, she said, \\"I think it's really appropriate, because Daniel's father figure was Joe Fenton (Stephen Boxer), who was on the show for years and was the patriarch of Doctors for a long time. So that's a very significant name for Daniel, and I think it's very loving of Zara that she doesn't insist on calling the baby something like Lysander or Demetrius - as she'd teased him that she would!\\" Walsh also stated that it has been \\"amazing\\" working with babies. =Temporary exit= In April 2012, Walsh announced on the ITV programme This Morning that she was expecting a baby and would be leaving to go on maternity leave. Asked how Zara would depart, producer Peter Eryl Lloyd told Digital Spy: \\"We're so pleased for her and she's loving being a mum, though of course we miss her - she'll leave our screens at the end of August. Don't panic, it's not forever; rest assured she will return maybe in the festive season. But yes, how to get rid of Zara? It was a real challenge to motivate such a dramatic exit, particularly when she has to take Joe with her and have a reason to come back. Things do get very dark for Zara and Daniel - with an act that changes many lives at The Mill. That's all I'm saying for now, but there's a major clue just before the Olympics.\\" =Return= Walsh returned to film scenes in October 2012, making a brief appearance in December 2012. Zara returned on screen full-time in February 2013. Speaking of her return in an interview with Digital Spy, Walsh revealed that it was amazing to be back: \\"As they say, everything changes but everything stays the same! I filmed Zara's departure scenes in April last year, and then I did two weeks in September for her return at Christmas, which was a bit early because my baby was so little! I then returned full-time in November. It's madness as I'm just busier than ever! I'm doing the same job, but of course I've got my baby now too.\\" Speaking of Zara's feelings towards Daniel once she returns, she said: \\"Well, it's very complicated. She gives him a very hard time and she's keeping his access arrangements to their baby as they were before - very minimal. However, if she hated him that much and really did want him out of her life, my question is: what is she doing back? Zara obviously can't live with Daniel and can't live without him. Their relationship is so complicated.\\" Reception Walsh and Matthew Chambers, who plays Daniel Granger, were nominated for Best On-Screen partnership at the 2012 British Soap Awards but lost out to Jake Wood and Jo Joyner who play Max and Tanya Branning on EastEnders. They have since been nominated in 2013, 2017 and 2018. For her portrayal of Zara, Walsh won Best Female Acting Performance at the 2015 RTS Midlands Awards. Walsh shared her delight on Twitter, admitting that she was overwhelmed to receive the prize on her first day back at work following maternity leave. She has also been nominated for Serial Drama Performance at the National Television Awards in 2019 and 2020.

On 31 August 2005, Kevin James and three other men were indicted on terrorism charges related to conspiracy to attack military facilities in the Los Angeles area and of attempting to fund their campaign by robbing gas stations in Southern California over the previous three months. Kevin James, a Muslim convert, was accused of founding a radical Islamic group called J.I.S (Jam’iyyat Ul-Islam Is-Saheehجمعية الإسلام الصحيح , Arabic for \\"Assembly of Authentic Islam\\") from his cell in Folsom Prison in California, and of recruiting fellow inmates to join his mission to kill infidels. The announcement of the arrests was made by the Attorney-General Alberto Gonzales in the presence of the director of the FBI Robert Mueller in Washington D.C. Robert Mueller mentioned the incident in a \\"Major Executive Speech\\" in June 2006 on the day that the 2006 Sears Tower plot was announced. The Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI outlined the case in his congressional testimony in September 2006. Background The attack is one in a series of Islam-related attacks and failed attacks by Muslims on military installations in the United States, including the 2009 New York terrorism plot, the 2007 Fort Dix attack plot, the 2009 Little Rock recruiting office shooting, and the September 11 attacks on the Pentagon. The culprits * Kevin James, 29, Muslim convert, a U.S. national, founded J.I.S.

WAKIN, May 23, 2009. About a month later, Washington was released from prison and recruited Patterson and Samana, neither of whom had a criminal record, at an Inglewood mosque. Conviction On 14 December 2007, Kevin James pleaded guilty to \\"conspiracy to levy war against the United States through terrorism\\" and faces up to 20 years in federal prison. Levar Washington also pleaded guilty to the same in addition to a weapons charge and could get 25. Gregory Patterson is expected to accept a plea deal, and Hammad Samana is currently undergoing psychiatric treatment. In an interview with the prosecutor, the reporter remarked that \\"the cell appears to have been remarkably indiscreet about committing plans to paper. They even left the text of a press release Mr. James had written for use once they committed a successful attack. And one of the ringleaders, James, was in prison the whole time.\\" Documents such as these formed the basis of the evidence, since the group hadn't gotten to the point of gathering materials to make explosives. A 2011 NPR report claimed some of the people associated with this case were imprisoned in a highly restrictive Communication Management Unit.

This information is used by engine management systems to control the fuel injection or the ignition system timing and other engine parameters. Before electronic crank sensors were available, the distributor would have to be manually adjusted to a timing mark on petrol engines. The crank sensor can be used in combination with a similar camshaft position sensor to monitor the relationship between the pistons and valves in the engine, which is particularly important in engines with variable valve timing. This method is also used to \\"synchronise\\" a four stroke engine upon starting, allowing the management system to know when to inject the fuel. It is also commonly used as the primary source for the measurement of engine speed in revolutions per minute. Common mounting locations include the main crank pulley, the flywheel, the camshaft or on the crankshaft itself. This sensor is one of the two most important sensors in modern-day engines, together with the camshaft position sensor. As the fuel injection (diesel engines) or spark ignition (petrol engines) is usually timed from the crank sensor position signal, failing sensor will cause an engine not to start or will cut out while running. Engine speed indicator takes speed indication also from this sensor.  Types of sensor  There are several types of sensor in use. The inductive sensor, Hall Effect sensor, magnetoresistive sensor, optical sensor. Inductive sensors have the simplest construction and are usually purely passive devices. Hall effect and magnetoresistive sensors have the advantage over inductive sensors in that they can detect static (non-changing) magnetic fields. Optical sensors do not have great resistance against fouling but are able to provide the most precise edge detection. Some engines, such as GM's Premium V family, use crank position sensors which read a reluctor ring integral to the harmonic balancer. This is a much more accurate method of determining the position of the crankshaft and allows the computer to determine within a few degrees the exact position of the crankshaft (and thereby all connected components) at any given time.  Function  The functional objective for the crankshaft position sensor is to determine the position and/or rotational speed (RPM) of the crank. Engine Control Units use the information transmitted by the sensor to control parameters such as ignition timing and fuel injection timing. In a diesel, the sensor will control the fuel injection. The sensor output may also be related to other sensor data including the cam position to derive the current combustion cycle, this is very important for the starting of a four- stroke engine. Sometimes, the sensor may become burnt or worn out - or just die of old age at high mileage. One likely cause of crankshaft position sensor failure is exposure to extreme heat. Others are vibration causing a wire to fracture or corrosion on the pins of harness connectors. Many modern crankshaft sensors are sealed units and therefore will not be damaged by water or other fluids. When it goes wrong, it stops transmitting the signal which contains the vital data for the ignition and other parts in the system. A bad crank position sensor can worsen the way the engine idles, or the acceleration behaviour. If the engine is revved up with a bad or faulty sensor, it may cause misfiring, motor vibration or backfires. Acceleration might be hesitant, and abnormal shaking during engine idle might occur. In the worst case, the car may not start. The first sign of crankshaft sensor failure, usually, is the refusal of the engine to start when hot but will start again once the engine has cooled. One detail of some designs is the \\"three-wire\\" inductive crank sensor whereby the third wire is actually just a co-axial shield around the two main sensor wires to prevent them from picking up stray electrical pulses from elsewhere in the vehicle engine bay.  Examples  Another type of crank sensor is used on bicycles to monitor the position of the crankset, usually for the cadence readout of a cyclocomputer. These are usually reed switches mounted on the bicycle frame with a corresponding magnet attached to one of the pedals crankset arms.  Notes  GMR (giant magnetoresistance) technology is also used for Crank, Cam rotor sensing purpose. Mitsubishi is the first who used this technology in automotive application purpose.

Presented by Derek Mooney, the programme airs Monday to Friday from 15:00 to 16:30. Mooney was the 18th most listened-to radio programme in Ireland. It was presented by Brenda Donohue or Aonghus McAnally when Derek Mooney was absent. Its predecessor programme, Mooney Goes Wild, was known for its coverage of nature and the later programme featured web broadcasts of blue tits nesting and hatching. In 2009, Mooney's blue tits nested live online in the gardens of President Mary McAleese. History Mooney Goes Wild started in 1995 on Saturdays on RTÉ Radio 1. It mainly focused on wildlife and nature. Jackie and Daw was broadcast on Mooney Goes Wild. Mooney Goes Wild on One won the prestigious Prix d'Europe in Berlin in 2000, with the award given for a programme that observed the lives of two nesting jackdaws. On 2 October 2006, the programme moved to a weekday slot. In early 2009, RTÉ weather presenter Nuala Carey launched a nationwide search to find herself a man on Mooney. Reports of her escapades at several dating events accompanied by her friend Ciara were broadcast on the radio programme. In 2011, it featured a world record attempt at having the most people dressed up as a leprechaun in the one place. People came from Italy, Poland and Romania to participate in the \\"Largest Gathering of People Dressed as Leprechauns\\". Mooney combined with the RTÉ Concert Orchestra and the RTÉ radio audience to create Mooney Tunes from the Grand Canal Theatre for RTÉ over Christmas 2011, an obvious pun on the similarity between the presenter's name and the word \\"Looney\\" as used in Looney Tunes, the Warner Bros. animated cartoon series. Jedward put in an appearance at the show. Listeners were left stunned on Friday 13 April 2012 when a caller to Mooney was attacked by a swarm of bees live on the national airwaves. The caller screamed down the telephone before going silent amid the sound of the buzzing swarm. Mooney bee expert Philip McCabe had been giving advice to the listener at the time of the incident. In July 2012, Mooney criticised listeners who complained about the show discussing issues to do with the LGBT community. Format With the change to Mooney the programme's focus changed more to general chat and interviews. It also had live music and music discussion. In 2009, Mooney was the first place to preview six contestants going up to represent Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest. A memorable feature of the show was \\"Mooney's Money\\", whereby Mooney would dispense cash to listeners via a competition. Dermot O'Neill was a frequent guest on the programme. As well as talking about gardening he was once offered to learn opera. He took up the challenge and performed at a New Year's Day concert on Mooney. Authors, such as Joan Geraghty, spoke about their books on the show. Mooney also searched for a Little Orphan Annie to star in an Irish tour of the musical Annie. The finalists were reduced to three. The competition was won by Nastasia Vashko from Limerick. Fridays were dedicated to the original format of the Mooney Goes Wild show, with guests, and panelists such as Éanna ni Lamhna, talking about nature and wildlife in Ireland. Annually Nestwatch had cameras in birds' nests. It was similar to the setup of the BBC's Springwatch. One nest box was installed in the gardens of President Mary McAleese at Áras an Uachtaráin in 2009 at her own invitation. The male blue tit once went missing and the female blue tit had only laid six eggs, half of what was initially expected. Show reporter Terry Flanagan visited national school students to observe their freshly hatched chicks. The weekday programme originally lasted two hours, but was shortened when Drivetime was extended. There are news and sport bulletin interruptions during the programme.

John Lawrence Angel (1915–1986) was a British-American biological anthropologist born on 21 March 1915 in London. His writings have had the biggest impact on paleodemography. Education His mother, Elizabeth, was an American classicist, and his father, John, was a British sculptor. The family emigrated to the United States in 1928. Angel completed his undergraduate degree at Harvard College in 1936 where he studied under Clyde Kluckhohn, Carleton S. Coon and Earnest A. Hooton. Hooton had a particular influence on Angel and arranged for him to conduct field work in Greece early in his career as a graduate student. While in Greece he collected data on archaeological human remains from various sites. These data became the basis of his dissertation and he received his Ph.D. degree from Harvard in 1942. Career After completing his degree he taught briefly at the University of Minnesota and the University of California at Berkeley. In 1943 he accepted a post in the anatomy department of Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where he taught and conducted research until his appointment in 1962 as Curator of Physical (Biological) Anthropology at the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution. During his career at the Smithsonian he broadened his research emphasis to include forensic anthropology. He was a consultant to the Federal Bureau of Investigation but also assisted many regional police units in identifying human remains from forensic cases. Angel had a major influence on research in biological anthropology in emphasizing the importance of combining cultural and biological data in interpreting human skeletal samples from past human groups. He worked closely with archaeologists in his effort to reconstruct what he called the social biology of archaeological human populations. Although Greece remained the focus of much of his research throughout his life he extended this focus to include archaeological human remains from Turkey. His research on human skeletal paleopathology laid the groundwork for much of the research being conducted in that field of research today.

The director of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, Lord Kylsant, had falsified a trading prospectus with the aid of the company accountant to make it look as if the company was profitable and to entice potential investors. Following an independent audit instigated by HM Treasury, Kylsant and John Moreland, the company auditor, were arrested and charged with falsifying both the trading prospectus and company records and accounts. Although they were acquitted of falsifying records and accounts, Kylsant was found guilty of falsifying the trading prospectus and sentenced to twelve months in prison. The company was then liquidated, and reconstituted as The Royal Mail Lines Ltd with the backing of the British government. As well as its immediate impact, the case instigated massive changes in the way companies were audited. The case highlighted flaws in the way company accounts were reviewed, and \\"probably had a greater impact on the quality of published data than all the Companies Acts passed up to that date\\".Camfferman (1998) p.4 The case \\"fell like an atomic bomb and profoundly disturbed both the industrial and the accountancy worlds\\", and has also been linked to reduced public trust of big businesses. The case is also seen as the reason for the demise of accounting with the aid of secret reserves. Background The Royal Mail Steam Packet Company was a British shipping company founded in London in 1839 by James MacQueen. It became the largest shipping group in the world when it took over the White Star Line in 1927.Shipping Lines: Royal Mail Steam Packet Company Lord Kylsant had been chairman of the company since 1902. He had expanded the company rapidly: aside from the White Star Line, he bought the Pacific Steam Navigation Company in 1910 for £1.5 million,£1,500,000 in 1910 would be worth approximately £ in . the Union-Castle Line in 1912, and assumed control of the Harland and Wolff shipyards in 1924.Hyde (1960) p.220 The company had prospered during the First World War as the government paid to requisition its ships as military supply vessels and troop transports. The company had saved the profits, predicting that it would need them to cover income tax and excess profits tax. After these taxes had been paid there was approximately £1 million left,£1,000,000 in 1919 would be worth approximately £ in . which they again saved, hoping to use this to cover any financial difficulties that might arise. The reserves were again boosted with government money paid under the Trade Facilities Act 1921,Stacey (1980) p.150 but between 1921 and 1925 the profits of the company rapidly dropped and, beginning from 1926, the directors supplemented the company income by taking money from the reserves.Hyde (1960) p.221 In 1929 the company asked HM Treasury for an extension of the period in which government loans to the company could be paid. The Treasury first demanded an audit of the company accounts, and sent Sir William McClintock to write a report on the financial state of the company. McClintock's report revealed that the company had not earned any trading profits since 1925, but was still paying dividends by taking money from the reserves. The company had reported £439,000 profits for 1926,£439,000 in 1926 would be worth approximately £ in . but had drawn £750,000£750,000 in 1926 would be worth approximately £ in . out of the reserves and falsified accounts to make it appear that the money came from trading. In 1927 the company made a trading loss of £507,000,£507,000 in 1927 would be worth approximately £ in . but money was again drawn from the reserves to make it appear that the company had made a profit of £478,000.£478,000 in 1927 would be worth approximately £ in .Green (1982) p.72 As a result of this, and a report that in 1928 the company had issued a fraudulent prospectus inviting customers to buy shares in the company and saying that it had earned an average £500,000 a year in the last decade, arrest warrants were issued for Lord Kylsant and John Moreland, the company auditor. At the time the ruse was discovered the company had a trading deficit of £300,000 a year,£300,000 in 1929 would be worth approximately £ in .Edwards (1989) p.151 the reserves were completely exhausted, and the company owed £10 million.£10,000,000 in 1929 would be worth approximately £ in .Green (1982) p.93 Trial The trial began at the Old Bailey on 20 July 1931 before Mr Justice Wright, with Sir William Jowitt, D.N. Pritt and Eustace Fulton for the prosecution, Sir John Simon, J.E. Singleton and Wilfred Lewis for Lord Kylsant and Sir Patrick Hastings, Stuart Bevan, Frederick Tucker and C.J. Conway for John Moreland.Brooks (2008) p.1 The indictment contained 3 counts. On count 1 Kylsant was charged with issuing a document, namely the annual report for 1926 with intent to deceive the shareholders about the true state of the company, Morland was charged with aiding and abetting this offence. Count 2 was an identical count relating to the annual report for 1927 against both defendants and on count 3 Kylsant alone was charged with issuing a document—the debenture stock prospectus of 1928 with intent to induce people to advance property to the company.Brooks (2008) p.3 All counts were contrary to section 84 of the Larceny Act 1861. Both defendants pleaded not guilty to all counts.Brooks (2008) p.2 The main defence on the use of secret reserve accounting came with the help of Lord Plender. Plender was one of the most important and reliable accountants in Britain, and under cross-examination stated that it was routine for firms \\"of the very highest repute\\" to use secret reserves in calculating profit without declaring it.Hyde (1960) p.224 Patrick Hastings said that \\"if my client ... was guilty of a criminal offence, there is not a single accountant in the City of London or in the world who is not in the same position.\\"Hyde (1960) p.226 Both Kylsant and Moreland were acquitted of counts 1 and 2, but Kylsant was found guilty on count 3Brooks (2008) p.262 and was sentenced to 12 months in prison.Brooks (2008) p.266 Kylsart appealed his conviction on count 3 and was bailed pending the appeal. The appeal was heard in November 1931 where the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, ruling that although the statements within the prospectus were all true, the document as a whole was false because of what it concealed, omitted or implied.R v Kylsant [1932] 1 KB 442 Aftermath Following Kylsant's conviction the company was liquidated, and reconstituted as The Royal Mail Lines Ltd with the backing of the British government. The case led to several changes in the way companies were audited. Because many accountants shared Plender's view that secret reserve accounting was a regular and respectable practice, and because the pair had not been found guilty of publishing false information as a result of this, the professional response was disjointed and half-hearted. There were major changes, however: although the practice of secret reserve accounting remained acceptable, companies disclosed their use of this in their audit reports.Camfferman (1998) p.6 The Companies Act 1947 made it clear that failing to disclose the use of this process was unacceptable, and undermined the \\"true and fair view\\" companies were required to give in their financial statements. A second major change was in the approach accountants took to their job. Previously the attitude was that accountants were only required to do their legal duty, but after the Royal Mail Case accountants were more and more expected to use their ethical and moral judgement in making decisions.Camfferman (1998) p.7 Contemporaries said that the case \\"probably had a greater impact on the quality of published data than all the Companies Acts passed up to that date\\". The case \\"fell like an atomic bomb and profoundly disturbed both the industrial and the accountancy worlds\\", and has been linked to reduced public trust of big businesses. Following his release in 1932, Kylsant stayed mainly out of the public eye despite a brief return in 1933. Influence on contract law The case also affected misrepresentation in the English law of contract. A misrepresentation is an untrue statement of fact that induces a contract, and a victim may rescind and perhaps be awarded damages. In the Kylsant case, the court held that the prospectus, though \\"strictly true\\", was fraudulently intended to give a misleading impression and was thereby an \\"untrue statement\\", allowing investors to sue. Kylsant's statement was deemed fraudulent on the basis of the \\"3-part test in Derry v Peek \\" Derry v Peek [1875] 14 App Cas 337 which held that a person who (i) intentionally told lies, or (ii) was reckless with the truth, or (iii) did not believe in what he was saying, was liable in fraudulent misrepresentation. In the later case of Doyle v Olby,Doyle v Olby [1969] 2 QB 158 Lord Denning MR declared that a person making a fraudulent misrepresentation was liable in damages for \\"all direct consequences\\", whether loss was foreseeable or not; whereas the general rule for the award of damages in contract is that the loss caused by the breach must be foreseeable either to the parties or to the \\"reasonable man\\", as in Hadley v Baxendale.Hadley v Baxendale [1854] EWHC Exch J70; (1854) 9 Ex Ch 341; 156 ER 145 Notes UK CPI inflation numbers based on data available from Measuring Worth: UK CPI References Bibliography   Category:1931 in England Category:English criminal case law Category:Accounting scandals Category:1931 in case law Category:1931 in British law Category:Auditing in the United Kingdom Category:1931 crimes in the United Kingdom ","title":"Royal Mail Case"},{"id":"23105518","text":"Map showing the nine districts of Delhi.

Distribution Archeria traversii is scattered locally across southern New Zealand (the South Island and Stewart Island), where it is endemic.Allan, H.H. 1961. Flora of New Zealand. Volume I: Indigenous Tracheophyta - Psilopsida, Lycopsida, Filicopsida, Gymnospermae, Dicotyledons. Government Printer, Wellington. It is notably absent from Marlborough and much of the eastern South Island. Ecology It is largely found in shrublands and conifer- broadleaf forests, at lowland to montane altitudes. Flowering takes place from December to February, and fruiting from February to April.Smith-Dodsworth, J.C. 1991. New Zealand Native Shrubs and Climbers. David Bateman Ltd, Auckland. Morphology ; Habit: An erect shrub, up to 5 m tall but often much shorter. It has spreading to ascending branches, with leaves that are fairly evenly spaced (rather than clustered, like A. racemosa). Multiple trunks are often formed, and can be highly twisted, rough, and covered in epiphytic bryophytes. The bark is dark brown in colour, with branchlets that are light reddish when young and light brown when mature. ;Leaves: Narrow lanceolate leaves, becoming glabrous and leathery. Dark green on the adaxial side, while abaxially they tend to be much paler. The leaf apices are acute to subacute, and sometimes reddish in colour. The base of the leaf is rigid and nearly sessile, attached to the stem with a short and flat petiole. Dimensions are roughly 7–12 mm long and 2–4 mm wide. Leaf margins are entire, minutely ciliolate, and flat to slightly recurved. Prominent venation can often be seen on the abaxial sides of the leaves (3- to 5-veined). ;Inflorescence: A solitary terminal raceme, with 8–16 flowers, ranging from 10–30 mm in length. The axis and short curved pedicels are both pubescent. The bracts are oblong and caducous. ;Flowers & fruits:The flowers are perfect, 4–5 mm long, urn shaped, with a corolla that is white to pink to deep red in colour (often lighter at the base and darkening towards the lobes). The sepals are oblong and ciliolate, frequently light green but turning to red towards the tips. Capsules are 2–3 mm in diameter, with 3–5 locules.Dawson, J., Lucas, R. 2011. New Zealand's Native Trees. Craig Potton Publishing, Nelson. Evolutionary history The phylogeny of the genus remains unknown, but morphologically A. traversii appears to most closely resemble A. racemosa, the only other New Zealand species in the genus. Conservation status Archeria traversii is currently regarded as non-threatened.De Lange, P., Heenan, P., Norton, D., Rolfe, J., Sawyer, J. 2010. Threatened Plants of New Zealand. Canterbury University Press, Christchurch. Etymology Archeria was named by Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1844 after the nineteenth-century Tasmanian botanist W. Archer. The specific epithet traversii comes from William Travers, a 19th- century New Zealand naturalist and politician, after whom the plant species was named.

A Birmingham City supporter, he signed for the club in 1950, initially as an amateur. After completing his National Service in the Royal Army Service Corps, he turned professional in May 1952. He had to wait nearly four years for his first-team debut, which came on 7 March 1956, deputising for the injured Roy Warhurst in a First Division game at Huddersfield Town which finished 1–1. One of several players tried in the half-back line in the run-up to the 1956 FA Cup Final, Linnecor was not selected for that game. He played 11 times in the following season,Matthews, pp. 191–192. and in April 1957 was sold to Lincoln City as a makeweight in the £15,000 deal which took Dick Neal in the opposite direction. After narrowly avoiding relegation from the Second Division in 1957, Linnecor remained at Lincoln for the rest of his Football League career, a further seven full seasons, during which he scored 55 goals from 287 appearances in all competitions. He is remembered for the hat-trick he scored against Liverpool at Anfield in 1960 to give Lincoln a 3–1 victory and inflict on Liverpool their first home league defeat of the year. In the 1964 close season, Linnecor left Lincoln, by then in the Fourth Division, and moved into non-league football with Boston, newly formed and playing in the Lincolnshire League. He then played for Grantham Town, where he scored 11 goals from 88 appearances, helping the club reach the second round of the 1968–69 FA Cup, where they were defeated only in the last few minutes of the match by that season's League Cup winners Swindon Town, and to victory in the Midland League Cup. After that he played for Worksop Town and Bourne Town, whom he assisted to successive United Counties League titles, and coached junior players at Lincoln City. After leaving full-time football, Linnecor worked as a salesman before becoming a storeman at Ruston's. He managed Ruston Sports football team for a number of years, and was a vice- president of the club. On retirement, Linnecor and his wife, Beryl, settled in the Lincoln area.

Over 40,000 people use the building each year.Dartmouth House The original building was constructed in the mid 18th-century and what today comprises Dartmouth House was two separate residences, numbers 37 and 38 Charles Street.37 and 38, Charles Street W1, Westminster, British Listed Buildings. Retrieved 13 February 2016.Location , Dartmouth House website. Retrieved 13 February 2016. The first owner of number 37 was Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Carnarvon from 1757–1776. In 1870, the banker Edward Baring bought both properties and on his creation as Baron Revelstoke in 1885, he converted the two houses into one to house his collection of French antique furniture and art. He remodelled and refurbished the house in a French Roccoco style. There is a painted ceiling by Pierre-Victor Galland above the grand staircase. However a crisis at Baring Brothers and Co Bank meant that spending on the buildings was curtailed and all building and design work ceased. Many of Lord Revelstoke’s furnishings and objects d’art had to be sold at auction, although he continued to live here until his death in 1897. The next owner, Lord Dartmouth (the 6th Earl of Dartmouth), made the most significant changes to the interior of the house in 1900, with the creation of the Long and Small Drawing Rooms. The house was used as the Dartmouth family home until the outbreak of war in 1914, when it was used by the British Red Cross as a military hospital. It was sold again in 1918 to the Hon. Mrs Robert Lindsay. Dartmouth House was purchased by the English-Speaking Union in 1926 for the sum of £45,000 from the Hon. Mrs Robert Lindsay. It was formally opened as the London Headquarters of the ESU by the then Prime Minister, Sir Stanley Baldwin, on the 22 February 1927. Today, Dartmouth House is an important heritage building in Mayfair. It was upgraded by the UK government Department of Culture, Media and Sport to be a Grade II* listed building.

Both Proud and his character live with spina bifida. The character made his first appearance in the episode broadcast on 10 September 2009 and his last in the one broadcast on 19 July 2010. Storylines Adam's introduction to the show begins when Manda Best (Josie Lawrence) tells her boyfriend Minty Peterson (Cliff Parisi) that her son, Adam is on a summer holiday abroad but will return to the UK shortly due to his academic studies. Minty is reluctant when Manda suggests Adam stay with them as they don't have a spare room as they have a lodger Darren Miller (Charlie G. Hawkins). However, Manda makes arrangements for Adam to stay and he arrives on 10 September 2009. He quickly forms a low opinion of Minty, and takes a liking to Libby Fox (Belinda Owusu), Darren's girlfriend. Libby is due to go to Oxford University, so they become friends. He returns to Oxford at the end of the summer holidays, texting Libby that he will see her there. Adam returns to Walford unexpectedly and continues to be rude and hostile to Minty. He is also shocked to discover that Libby and Darren are engaged. He soon returns to Oxford but his car breaks down whilst he is in hospital for a routine health check. Not wanting to worry Manda, Adam phones Minty for assistance and Minty goes but confronts Adam about his rudeness. Adam tells Minty that he is very wary of his mother's usual choice of men, as many have let her down in the past. However, he agrees to try to be more polite in future. He returns over Christmas and wonders why Libby is with Darren, thinking she cannot see beyond his wheelchair. Following the revelation that Darren is the father of Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison)'s baby son, Adam teases Darren about Libby. He defends his mother when Minty is angry at her for not telling him about Darren and Heather. He continues to tease a distraught Darren after he spent the night on a bench, but Manda tells Adam he should know when someone is in need. Adam then takes Darren to a party and agrees to look after him. The next day, Darren wonders what he should say to Libby, who has gone back to Oxford early. Adam tells him he should give her some space, and Darren agrees, but Adam then sends Libby a text message saying he is there for her if she needs a friend. When Manda comes home one night in tears, she tells Adam she thinks Minty is having an affair. Adam and Libby search for evidence and find a letter that Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook) has sent him. Adam decides not to tell his mother but Libby says they should and she tells Manda about it. Manda decides to leave Walford after Minty admits having feelings for Sam. Adam returns to Oxford and when he comes back to Walford again, he and Libby are dating. Darren confronts him saying he has probably been bad-mouthing him for months, and Adam hits back by saying that Libby makes up for being unattractive by being good in bed. Adam spots Libby in the cafe where Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) starts to flirt with her and after Libby leaves, Adam punches Fatboy. Adam is approached by Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield) for help with her exams. She pays him for exam papers, but after Adam is annoyed by Libby's behaviour during a picnic, he tells Lucy he wants payment in kind, not money and demands a kiss as a down payment. Minty sees them kiss again but Adam tells him that Lucy is very tactile. After Lucy's final exam, Adam demands sex but she refuses, saying she has played him at his own game and won. Adam threatens to expose Lucy's tricks but Lucy says that anything would be better than having sex with him. Lucy tells her brother Peter (Thomas Law) that she was blackmailed by Adam, who confronts him and threatens to tell Libby. Adam says that it would not be a good idea as Libby is still coming to terms with the deaths of her parents Denise Wicks (Diane Parish) and Owen Turner (Lee Ross) (Denise is later found alive). However, Libby is standing behind him and hears everything, then reveals it to a crowd that gathers after throwing his belongings out on the street. He accuses her of only dating him to make herself look good and says she will be trying to kill him next. He insults Denise, so Libby slaps him and tells him to leave. Adam gets in his car and drives away. Creation and development Adam is the son of character Manda Best, played by Josie Lawrence. Both the character and the actor have spina bifida and are wheelchair users. He was introduced as part of a series of measures by the BBC to raise the profile of disabled actors. He began filming in June 2009 and appeared on-screen from September 2009. =Casting= Speaking of his casting, Proud said he is \\"delighted and honoured to be joining such a talented cast [and] very excited and looking forward to bringing the character to life.\\" The show's executive producer, Diederick Santer, said it was \\"about time\\" the show cast an adult actor with a disability, as up until Proud's casting, all disabilities in the show had been portrayed by children or able-bodied adults: \\"In recent years, we've had a number of regular and guest characters with disabilities, some of them children like Janet Mitchell [who has Down's syndrome] and more recently Syd's son, Noah [who is deaf]. We've also told the story of Jean Slater who suffers from bipolar disorder. But this is the first time we've had a regular adult character with a visible disability played by an actor with a disability. It's about time.\\" In an interview with magazine Disability Now, Proud said he was offered the part of Adam at the same time as wondering whether a regular part would come up: \\"It was spooky the way it all worked out.\\" He went on to say \\"To move representation of disability in the media forward is something I take a lot of pride in. It is one of those lovely bonuses of doing what I do, you feel like hopefully if you do it right you're encouraging more disabled people to get into acting and not just increasing people's awareness of disability,\\" and said he is not worried about the inevitable narrow-mindedness of some of the EastEnders audience: \\"Someone once said, 'If you can't laugh at yourself you're missing the joke of the century'. You will always get some people that disagree with the majority but I don't think it's their opinions that would matter to me.\\" Proud also said that the programme's sets may cause problems for the character, but will serve to highlight them: \\"We haven't tackled the height of the Queen Vic bar yet! But it's all representative, I mean, the world isn't accessible, and it's important that the set highlights this for my character.\\" Although the character's spina bifida is not the focus of his storyline, he still has to deal with other people's reactions to his disability. =Personality= The character is described as \\"a 20-year-old self-obsessed, snobbish Oxford University student,\\" though Proud disagrees with this assessment of the character's personality, saying, \\"The word I would use is 'spiky'. He's lovely and refreshing, not a stereotype, a very unique character. There's lots of potential with him. He does ruffle feathers and stuff but I think the response [to him] is going to be good.\\" He added that the character is ambitious and driven by success, and that he is \\"hard to be friends with.\\" He said he was happy about the fact that the character was not \\"too nice\\". Santer said that the character would be \\"interesting, but possibly irritating\\". =Departure= On his departure, Proud said: \\"I have had a wonderful time at EastEnders and loved every minute of it over the last year. It has been fantastic to play such a complex character like Adam. I have made some great friends amongst the cast and crew and wish the show all the best for future.\\" His final episode was broadcast on 19 July 2010.

A well-educated and successful lawyer, he was repeatedly sent as envoy to Ostrogothic Italy in the prelude to the Gothic War of 535–554. Despite his diplomatic skill, he was not able to avert war, and was imprisoned by the Goths in Ravenna for a few years. Upon his release, he was appointed to the post of magister officiorum, head of the imperial secretariat, which he held for an unparalleled 26 years. In this capacity, he was one of the leading ministers of Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565), playing an important role in the Byzantine emperor's religious policies and the relations with Sassanid Persia; most notably he led the negotiations for the peace agreement of 562 that ended the 20-year-long Lazic War.. His historical writings survive only in fragments, but provide unique source material on early Byzantine ceremonies and diplomatic issues between Byzantium and the Sassanids. Biography =Early career: envoy to Italy= Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) and his entourage, mosaic from the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna. Peter was born in Thessalonica about the year 500, and was of Illyrian origin according to Procopius; according to Theophylact Simocatta, however, his origin was from Solachon, near Dara in Mesopotamia.. After studying law, he embarked on a successful career as a lawyer in Constantinople, which brought him to the attention of Empress Theodora. In 534, on account of his rhetorical skills, he was employed as an imperial envoy to the Ostrogothic court at Ravenna. At the time, a power struggle was developing there between Queen Amalasuntha, regent to the young king Athalaric, and her cousin Theodahad. Following the death of Athalaric, Theodahad usurped the throne, imprisoned Amalasuntha, and sent messages to Emperor Justinian hoping for recognition.. Peter met the envoys at Aulon, on his way to Italy, and notified Constantinople, seeking new instructions. Emperor Justinian ordered him to convey the message to Theodahad that Amalasuntha was under the Emperor's protection and not to be harmed. Nevertheless, at the time Peter arrived in Italy, Amalasuntha had been killed; Procopius's narrative in the Gothic War is ambiguous here, but in his Secret History, he explicitly claims that Peter arranged the murder of Amalasuntha on instructions from Theodora, who feared her as a potential rival for Justinian's attentions.. Whatever assurances might have been privately given by Theodora to Theodahad, in public, Peter strongly condemned the act, and declared that there would be \\"war without truce between the emperor and themselves\\" as a result.Procopius. De Bello Gothico, I.4. Peter then returned to Constantinople with letters from Theodahad and the Roman Senate to the imperial couple, bearing pleas for a peaceful solution, but by the time he reached the imperial capital, Emperor Justinian had resolved on war and was preparing his forces. Consequently, Peter returned to Italy in the summer of 535 conveying an ultimatum: only if Theodahad abdicated and returned Italy to imperial rule, could war be averted.. A two-pronged Byzantine offensive followed soon thereafter, attacking the outlying possessions of the Ostrogothic kingdom: Belisarius took Sicily, while Mundus invaded Dalmatia. Upon hearing these news, Theodahad despaired, and Peter was able to secure wide-ranging concessions from him: Sicily was to be ceded to the Byzantine Empire; the Gothic king's authority within Italy was severely restricted; a gold crown was to be sent as an annual tribute and up to 3,000 men were to be provided for the imperial army, underlining Theodahad's subject status.. Theodahad, however, fearing that his first offer would be rejected, then instructed Peter, under oath, to offer the cession of all Italy, but only if the original concessions were rejected by Justinian. In the event, Justinian rejected the first proposal, and was delighted to learn of the second one. Peter was sent back to Italy with Athanasius, bearing letters to Theodahad and the Gothic nobles, and for a time it seemed as if the cradle of the Roman Empire would return peacefully to the fold. It was not to be: upon their arrival in Ravenna, the Byzantine envoys found Theodahad in a changed disposition. Supported by the Gothic nobility and buoyed up by a success against Mundus in Dalmatia, he resolved to resist, and imprisoned the ambassadors.. =Magister officiorum= Peter remained imprisoned in Ravenna for three years, until released in June/July 539 by the new Gothic king, Witigis, in exchange for Gothic envoys sent to Persia who had been captured by the Byzantines.. As a reward for his services, Emperor Justinian then appointed Peter to the post of magister officiorum (\\"Master of the Offices\\"), one of the highest positions in the state, heading the palace secretariat, the imperial guards (the Scholae Palatinae), and the Public Post with the dreaded agentes in rebus.. He would hold this post for 26 consecutive years, longer by a wide margin than any other before or after.. At about the same time or shortly thereafter, he was raised to the supreme title of patrician and the supreme senatorial rank of gloriosissimus (\\"most glorious one\\"). He was also awarded an honorary consulship.. As magister, he took part in the discussions with Western bishops in 548 on the Three-Chapter Controversy, and was repeatedly sent as an envoy in 551–553 to Pope Vigilius, who opposed the emperor on the issue. Peter is also recorded as attending the Second Council of Constantinople in May 553.. The Roman–Persian border as agreed in 561–562. In 550, he was sent as envoy by Justinian to negotiate a peace treaty with Persia, a role he reprised in 561, when he met the Persian envoy Izedh Gushnap at Dara, to end the Lazic War. Reaching an agreement over the Persian evacuation of Lazica and the delineation of the border in Armenia, the two envoys concluded a fifty-year peace between the two empires and their respective allies. The annual Roman subsidies to Persia would resume, but the amount was lowered from 500 to 420 pounds of gold. Further clauses regulated cross-border trade, which was to be limited to the two cities of Dara and Nisibis, the return of fugitives, and the protection of the respective religious minorities (Christians in the Persian Empire and Zoroastrians in Byzantium). In exchange for Persian recognition for the existence of Dara, whose construction had originally sparked a brief war, the Byzantines agreed to limit their troops there and remove the seat of the magister militum per Orientem from the city.; . As disagreements remained on two border areas, Suania and Ambros, in spring 562, Peter travelled to Persia to negotiate directly with the Persian Shah, Chosroes I, without however achieving a result.. He then returned to Constantinople, where he died sometime after March 565.. His son Theodore, nicknamed Kontocheres or Zetonoumios, would succeed him as magister officiorum in 566, after a brief interval where the post was held by the quaestor sacri palatii (\\"Quaestor of the Sacred Palace\\") Anastasius. He held the post until some time before 576, being appointed as comes sacrarum largitionum (\\"Count of the Sacred Largess\\") thereafter; in the same year, he also led an unsuccessful embassy to Persia to end the ongoing war over the Caucasus.. Assessment As one of the leading officials of the age, Peter was a controversial figure, receiving greatly differing assessments from his contemporaries. To John Lydus, a mid-level bureaucrat of the praetorian prefecture of the East, Peter was a paragon of every virtue, an intelligent, firm but fair administrator and a kind man. Procopius in his public histories attests his mild manners and desire to avoid giving insult, but in his private Secret History he accuses him of \\"robbing the scholares\\" (the members of the Scholae) and being \\"the biggest thief in the world and absolutely filled with shameful avarice\\", as well as being responsible for the murder of Amalasuntha.Procopius. Secret History, XXIV.24. From quite early in his career, Peter was renowned for his learning, his passion for reading, and his discussions with scholars.. As a speaker, he was eloquent and persuasive; Procopius calls him \\"fitted by nature to persuade men\\",Procopius. De Bello Gothico, I.3. while Cassiodorus, who witnessed his embassies to the Ostrogoth court, also praises him as vir eloquentissimus and disertissimus (\\"most eloquent man\\"), and as sapientissimus (\\"most wise\\"). On the other hand, the late 6th-century historian Menander Protector, who relied on Peter's work for his own history, accuses him of boastfulness and of rewriting the records to enhance his own role and performance in the negotiations with the Persians.. Writings Peter wrote three books, all of which survive only in fragments: a history of the first four centuries of the Roman Empire, from the death of Julius Caesar in 44 BC to the death of Emperor Constantius II in 361 AD, of which about twenty fragments are extant (it has been suggested that the third- century material in this was taken from PhilostratusProphecy and History in the Crisis of the Roman Empire: A Historical Commentary on the Thirteenth Sibylline Oracle. By David S. Potter. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1990: Ch. 2.); a history of the office of magister officiorum from its institution under Constantine the Great (r. 306–337) to the time of Justinian, containing a list of its holders and descriptions of various imperial ceremonies, several of which are reproduced in chapters 84–95 of the first volume of the 10th-century De Ceremoniis of Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (r. 913–959); and an account of his diplomatic mission to the Persian Empire in 561–562, which has been used as a source by Menander Protector.. Until recently, Peter was also ascribed the authorship of the 6th-century Peri Politikes Epistemes (\\"On Political Science\\"), a six-volume book discussing political theory, drawing extensively from Classical texts such as Plato's The Republic and Cicero's De re publica. It too survives only in fragments.. Peter was the first late Roman/Byzantine author to write on imperial ceremonies, beginning a tradition that lasted unto the 14th century. His histories are also an important historical source; for instance, his work alone preserves the negotiations and provisions of the Roman–Persian treaty of 298 between Galerius and Narseh.. The Lost History of Peter the Patrician, published by Routledge in 2015, is an annotated translation from the Greek by Thomas M. Banchich of the fragments of Peter’s History, including additional fragments which used to be considered the work of the Roman historian Cassius Dio's so-called Anonymous Continuer.

John Howley in his studio  Life  Howley was born in Melbourne and studied at the National Gallery School of Art in Melbourne (1949–54) under Murray Griffin. In 1954 and again in 1955 he exhibited with Group Four, and in 1956 at Brummels Gallery,'Local Ceramics On Show' The Age Dec 17 1956, p.5 which established his reputation as an avant- garde artist. In 1962 he left Australia for England and spent 3 years traveling in Europe and North Africa painting and playing improvised music. From 1965 to 1967 he lived for two years in Tel Aviv, Israel where he had 5 exhibitions. In 1967 Howley returned to Melbourne and started to exhibit at Georges Mora’s Tolarno Gallery. In 1980 he established with his Israeli curator wife The Acland Street Art Gallery that continued to exhibit Howley along with several other artists until 1989. The next year he moved to Williamstown, Melbourne dedicating himself to his painting and his involvement in improvised music. The artist now lives in countryside Victoria, Australia. Howley painted 80 portraits and 2 commissioned murals Tullamarine Airport, Melbourne and Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, (the latter mural with two other artists) and has exhibited in Germany, England, Israel, USA and Australia.  Artistic development  In his student years John Howley’s study of Renaissance masters was the first major influence in his work. Other influences from that time include German Expressionism and the Australian Social Realism movement. Howley's formal studies and draftsmanship enabled him to explore a variety of different expressive modes. His oeuvre is characterised by a constant search for new ways to comment on contemporary civilisation – mainly the transition into a technologically controlled society. His paintings create alternative and fantastic realities. Music As well as a painter, Howley was also pianist and vocalist for the Howley, Calvert, George trio - an improvisational jazz trio, (1994-2007) including Robert Calvert on saxophone, and Robert George on drums.

Origins The bleaching business was established in 1792 by William Sykes. Sykes had been born at Wakefield and had been active in the cloth industry at Halifax and Manchester. On 27 November 1792 an advertisement appeared in the Manchester Mercury to let land at Edgeley, Stockport, Cheshire as > An Eligible situation for Bleach Ground or Print Field in which there are a > number of Fine White Sand Springs with a Rivulet capable of Turning Wash > Wheels etc. The Grounds lie very contiguous to the populous Manufacturing > Town of Stockport where Bleachers and Printers are both much wanted and > every encouragement will be given to a good tenant William Sykes took the land, first renting, but later purchasing it, and built a bleach works. To bleach cloth, it was repeatedly steeped in natural alkaline solutions derived from ash, called \\"bucking\\". It was then washed and exposed to sun and air by being hung out in the bleachfields (known as \\"crofts\\"). After being immersed in buttermilk, called ‘souring’ it received final washing, stretching and drying. The process could take up to eight months and with cloth in the open, a watchman was employed to guard Sykes crofts at night. Theft of cloth from a croft was an offence liable to capital punishment. Handloom weavers from Edgeley, Stockport, Adswood, Cheadle and Cheadle Hulme brought cloth to the works for bleaching and these were sold on to Manchester and London merchants. An early list of Sykes customers includes well-known names as Oldknow of Nottingham, Radcliffe of Stockport (a pioneer of the fine muslin industry) and Cadbury of Birmingham, a silk mercer and father of the founder of the well-known chocolate firm. The list also mentions names of customers as far afield as Boston, Massachusetts America and Messina Italy.Stockport Advertiser History of Stockport Chapter IX p103 When Sykes settled in Stockport, there were few trees in the area. As wood was needed in the drying process, he undertook extensive tree-planting on land which later became public property in Alexandra Park. He built a \\"stately house\\" Edgeley House, which was the home of the family for succeeding generations.Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council Alexandra Park, Edgeley The works were originally driven by water power, but in 1803 the works was provided with a 12 horse-power steam engine. By 1804 new chemical methods had been introduced using calcium hypochlorite which eliminated the need for grassing the cloth in the fields but required more water. Expansion Sunset over Sykes' Reservoir, January 2006. Edmund Sykes succeeded his father in the business some time before 1809. In 1812, Luddite demonstrators attacked the works and threatened the Sykes family in their home until they were dispersed by the militia. Edmund Sykes employed Pickfords and other proprietors of stage-wagons to distribute the wares. In 1820, Edmund's younger brother Richard joined the business which was then carried on under the name of E & R Sykes. In 1828 Edmund Sykes retired from the business and went to live at Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire.Stockport Advertiser History of Stockport Chapter IX p104 Under Richard Sykes' ownership, the business at Edgeley developed rapidly and every effort was made to modernise the plant. Wells were sunk including the \\"Silver Well\\" was sunk, and by 1830 these had quadrupled the water supply. Reservoirs were also built. These undertakings were of great value to people in the area in times of excessive drought. Richard Sykes also took a keen interest in public affairs. He was Justice of the Peace for Cheshire, Alderman for Stockport, and Mayor in 1850-1851. He was an active member of the Society of Bleachers. Sykes and Co were interested in the use of science in the bleaching industry, and their books include exhaustive tests made by them comparing different manufacturer's bleach. They also employed John Dalton, the chemist, as consultant on the quality of their water supply. Richard Sykes died in 1876 and his son Thomas Hardcastle Sykes succeeded to the business, undertaking speculative ventures at home and overseas.Stockport Advertiser History of Stockport Chapter IX p105 Bleachers Association Sykes became a limited liability company in 1892 but management remained in the family including Thomas Sykes' son, Alan, known as Jack. However, there was severe internal competition within the bleaching trade, which discouraged long-term investment, so the business did not develop the technical and scientific knowledge as much as foreign. As a result, the Bleacher's Association was created in June 1900, amalgamating around 60 businesses in bleaching and finishing of cotton goods.

It has a rural character with rolling hills, farmland and classic New England scenery. This area was designated because it is one of the last remaining stretches of green in the Boston to Washington, D.C. heavily urbanized corridor. The valley also has the largest stretch of dark night sky in the Boston-D.C. corridor. It contains some of the largest unbroken forests in Southern New England, in a region of Connecticut known as the Quiet Corner. Geography The corridor consists mostly of the Eastern New England Upland, transitioning to the coastal forests to the south and east. The rolling hills in the southern part of the Corridor become more rugged in the northern part of the corridor. The highest elevation is Burley Hill in Union, CT. The corridor has a high concentration of state parks, state forests and other reserves, such as the Yale-Myers Forest, Pachaug State Forest, and the Norcross Wildlife Sanctuary. Of the area's over 700,000 acres, over 77% is made up of forest and farms. The 35-town region is home to over 300,000 people. The Last Green Valley is half the size of Grand Canyon National Park and more than ten times that of Acadia National Park, New England's only national park.Total of all forest and reserved land in the area The over 1,100 square miles of protected territory extend from the northernmost point of East Brookfield, Massachusetts to the southernmost point of Preston, Connecticut. History Beginning in the 1980s, developmental pressures pushed citizens into creating organizations to protect lands, especially farmland from development. A report in 1988 by the National Park Service outlined solutions and it led to the creation of the Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor in 1994. It was expanded in 1999 to include several communities in Massachusetts. In December 2014, Congress passed a law officially renaming the area the Last Green Valley National Heritage Corridor.

He was one of the most prominent portraitists of the Biedermeier period. He became renowned for his realistic portraits. He worked mostly in the Austrian Littoral, but also produced religious paintings in Carniola and in Croatia. His handiwork can be seen in the Holy Mary Church in Stoliv. Nowadays, many of his works are on display in the Revoltella Museum in Trieste, some in the National Gallery of Slovenia in Ljubljana, National Museum of Serbia and in the Museum of History and Art of Gorizia. He is considered part of both the Italian and the Slovenian national culture canon. Biography Giuseppe Tominz was born in Gorizia as the second of eleven children of Ivano Tominz, a dealer in ironware, and his wife Maria Anna Gioacchini of Udine. He was educated in a bilingual environment. He attended a primary school run by Piarists in Gorizia, where he began to learn to paint in the third year. He received his first training as a painter from the local artist Karel Keber and probably also from the painter Franz Caucig. In 1809, he left for Rome with the help of Austrian Archduchess Maria Anna, sister of Emperor Francis I of Austria, and count Francesco della Torre. In Rome, he studied painting with Domenico Conti Bazzani and in the Scuola del Nudo at the Accademia di San Luca. In 1814, he was awarded a silver medal for his drawing Study of the Apostople. Two years later, he married Maria Ricci and in 1818, have two son Augusto and Alfredo will become the first director of the Revoltella Museum in Trieste. In the same year, Tominz returned with his family to Gorizia. Of his early artistic works, several anatomical studies, sketches and one of his landscapes View of Vietri, Rieti and the Salerno Bay have survived. In 1819, Tominz lived for some time in Vienna. From 1821 to 1823, he lived occasionally in Ljubljana, where he exhibited his works and painted portraits of nobles, members of the bourgeoisie, religious dignitaries and participants at the Congress of Laibach. Between 1830 and 1855, he lived and worked in Trieste. He later moved back to Gorizia, and finally to his estate in Gradišče nad Prvačino (Gradiscutta, in Italian), where he died in 1866. Work Pietro Stanislao Parisi with family from 1849 Tominz's early works include portraits of members of the nobility and bourgeoisie, but also of simple people. His influence can be seen in the works of the Slovene painters and Mihael Stroj. The style of Tominz's portraits was influenced by late Classicism and by the style of Viennese portrait artists of the Biedermeier period. The people in his portraits have sharp features and clear forms, but despite this the depictions are realistic, sometimes with an ironic touch. The backgrounds are filled with landscapes or the city from which the person depicted originated. Tominz also included objects that hint at the profession or the lifestyle of the person depicted. Inspired by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres or Vincenzo Camuccini, he used cool colours and plastic models of people. He is however best known for his oil painting technique, his precise skills of observation and his rapid style. When depicting religious motifs, Tominzc relied on graphical templates, the old Italian masters and Nazarene painters. Amongst his numerous sacred works are altars and other pictures for churches in Gorizia, Prvačina, Aquileia, Kanal ob Soči, Gradisca d'Isonzo, and elsewhere.

He has studied genetics. Background His father Dumitru Peligrad a boyar and philanthropist was placed under house arrest after the invasion of Romania by the Red Army (starting 23 August 1944), but refused to submit to regular police checks. Although belonging to a class deemed \\"unhealthy\\" by the then communist regime, the young researcher was a brilliant undergraduate at the University of Bucharest. Pioneer of Romanian radio-genetics (his first studies focused on the influence of electricity on the life of plants), agronomist (1956), Doctor (Ph.D) in Genetics (1961), then a professor at the University of Bucharest, he fought theories of Lysenkoism, imposed by the ex-USSR in the former so-called \\"popular democratic\\" countries of Central and Eastern Europe. After 1948 his laboratories were destroyed three times and he was banned from the university in the late 1950s. In his first book, published in Romanian, in 1969, General Biology, Genetics and Improvement, Denis Buican did not hesitate to formally confront Lysenkoism amidst repressive political and social campaigns undertaken in science and agriculture by the powerful Stalinist director Trofim Lysenko and his followers, starting year 1920. History of Science Naturalized French in 1972, he undertook a work of history and philosophy of science, embodied by his thesis of Doctor (Ph.D) of State (1983), History of Genetics and Evolutionism in France, the first true history of this science published in France. In 1989, his book The Revolution of Evolution received a Grand Prize from the French Academy. In 1997, he presided over the \\"Biology and Medical Science\\" section of the twentieth International Congress of History of Science (Liege, Belgium). Professor of history of science at the French University of Paris X-Nanterre (1983–2003), he is the author of a new theory of evolution, the \\"Synergistic Theory of Evolution\\". Publications A writer in Romanian and French, Denis Buican has published several collections of poems, in sensitivity close to poems written by Romanian poets Mihai Eminescu, Lucian Blaga and Tudor Arghezi. Haunted by nothingness, these short poems, very dense, open up a universe that is not unlike that of Romanian philosopher Emil Cioran. Romania's First Radiobiology Laboratory In 1955 he founded the first radiobiology laboratory of Romania and, the following year, he graduated this university as an agricultural engineer. Fighting tirelessly Lysenkoism's theories (which caused to his lab to be destroyed three times: in 1956, 1960 and 1962), he continues his research on plants' resistance to cold and on the heterosis (or hybrid vigor) for hybrids of Zea mays (the maize). His works, which were initially the subject of a first doctorate (Ph.D) thesis, in natural science (defended and published in Bucharest, Romania, in 1961), will be extended, completed and introduced, after his arrival in France, in a second doctoral thesis (defended and published at the Faculty of Sciences, in Paris, France, in 1970). Theorist of biology, Denis Buican has developed a new model called \\"Synergistic Theory of Evolution\\". It updates and complements the previous \\"Synthetic Theory\\" having in view that the natural selection underlined by Charles Darwin is to be applied only to phenotype, so that certain phenomena (such as lethal mutations) were not sufficiently taken into account by this old model. Buican's theory and model have introduced \\"a new concept in the evolutionary and hereditary process - i.e the pre-selection genotyping\\" - which may be defined as \\"the natural operation which eliminates a priori, to genotype level, any genetic combination or mutation which is unfit for the survival of it\\" (The revolution of evolution, 1989). Guided by the \\"Systems Theory\\" of Ludwig von Bertalanffy, Buican's theory envisages synergistic multi-pole selection which would be able to act within every living (from the atom to human being). French Teacher Philosopher and historian of science Visiting professor at the Sorbonne University (1969–1974), senior lecturer at the University of Dijon (1974–1980) and at the University of Paris I (1980–1983), Denis Buican teaches Philosophy and History of biological sciences, while preparing a third (state) doctoral thesis on the history of genetics in France, under the direction of . Philosopher of sciences, he redefines notably the place of chance in evolution, in departing positions adopted by Jacques Monod: beyond the absolute chance postulated by the Nobel Prize, he introduces an \\"oriented chance\\" (called \\"evolving orthodromic\\") and considers (in \\"Chance, necessity and logic of living\\", La Nouvelle Revue Française, 225, 1971) the opportunities to be offered by genetic manipulation – which will be confirmed by the first genetic engineering work done in 1974. New Theory Denis Buican has also developed a new theory of knowledge, called Biognoséologie, which attempts to exceed the Kantian distinction between phenomena and noumènes (those \\"things by themselves\\" which, according to Kant, can not be investigated by human beings) : based on ethology's data and on advances in molecular biology, he considered the so-called \\"relative noumènes\\", which would likely capture a probable reality. Historian, based on the epistemological model of Thomas Kuhn (The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 1962), he also considered the introduction of genetics in France as a \\"run with obstacles\\": the science of heredity was accepted only in 1945, not without some resistance by biologists themselves, most of them being attached to . He is also the author of an essay, \\"The eternal return of Lysenko\\" (1978) dedicated to the interpretation of Lysenkoism: denouncing the theories of the philosopher Dominique Lecourt (author of the essay Lysenko published in 1976), which denied any liability to Marxism in the emergence then the triumph of Stalin's Lysenkoism theses. On the contrary he shows that the roots of Lysenkoism are to be found in the messianism and determinism of Marx and Engels. Becoming a professor at University of Paris X – Nanterre, in 1983, Denis Buican devoted most of his research on the history of Darwinism, Evolution and Genetics, he publishes many books. Respect For The Individual A free man without illusions about Western democracies - which he did not consider to be truly democratic and readily qualified them as being only \\"police- and plutocratic demagogies\\" - he calls, on contrary, for an open, meritocratic society, based on the principles of power separation and reciprocal control of powers (according to Montesquieu), on the respect for the individual value and on equal opportunities. Probabilistic, he wished that the human society will enable everyone to freely and fully develop her/ his hereditary potential. Very critical in respect to the French university system - which he readily denounces as having a clan structure, attitudes and behaviors - he considers that \\"a society aiming to be simultaneously equitable and efficient does require a selective - and even a micro-selective - educational system being able to offer to everyone, from cradle to the grave, the possibility to develop herself / himself without any discrimination of class or race, of religion or customs, as far as her/ his genetic heritage does allow.\\" (The university as sacred mad cow of the Republic, Paris, F.-X. de Guibert, 2004, p. 127).

The estate, located at 601 Couchwood Road, is southeast of Hot Springs, Arkansas, straddling the border of Garland and Hot Spring counties on the north shore of Lake Catherine. The estate was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for two separate reasons. It was first listed on 1986 for the five naturalistic sculptures by Dionicio Rodriguez that are located on the property; these were commissioned by Couch. The estate was again listed on 2001 for its association with Couch, and for its well-preserved collection of Rustic architecture. Several of the estate's eight buildings were designed by the noted Arkansas architect John Parks Almand. Presidents Hoover and Roosevelt both spent time at Couchwood as guests. There are five red cedar log-houses on the estate: the Big House, Calhoun, Little Pine Bluff, Remmelwood and the Traincar. Today, the estate serves as a retreat for descendants and visitors. The estate is sometimes available for renting for such purposes as weddings, business trips or as a vacation getaway.

Ogawa and Noriaki Tsuchimoto have been called the \\"two figures [that] tower over the landscape of Japanese documentary.\\" Career Ogawa began his career at Iwanami Productions (Iwanami Eiga) making PR (public relations) films alongside other important directors such as Tsuchimoto, Kazuo Kuroki, Yōichi Higashi, and Susumu Hani. Turning independent, he first made documentaries about radical political movements in 1960s and 1970s Japan, most famously the \\"Sanrizuka\\" or \\"Narita\\" series, which recorded the struggle by farmers and student protesters to prevent the construction of the Narita International Airport in Sanrizuka, Chiba Prefecture. He won the Directors Guild of Japan New Directors Award for Summer in Narita in 1970. Ogawa's was a committed form of documentary, which clearly took the side of those combatting unjust power. A growing sense that he did not understand the life of the farmers he was filming, however, led Ogawa and his crew, collectively called Ogawa Productions, to leave for Magino in Yamagata Prefecture where they spent decades filming the life and histories of everyday farmers while living with them and pursuing agriculture. He often worked with the cinematographer Masaki Tamura. The \\"Magino\\" films became the epitome of Ogawa's stance towards documentary: that one can only record a reality that one has been truly immersed in. Ogawa was influential in the creation of the Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival, where the top prize in the Asia program was named after him. The film Devotion by Barbara Hammer is about Ogawa Productions.

Additionally, an MID does not confer postnominals, hence it is not included here. (13 February 1895 – 20 December 1970) was an officer in the British Army and later the Australian Army who commanded an Australian commando unit during the Second World War. Harcourt's military career began in 1914 when he was commissioned into the British Army. During the First World War he served on the Western Front, commanding a machine gun unit. He gained promotion quickly, advancing to the rank of major by the end of the war. He also received a number of notable decorations. Later, Harcourt served during the Russian Civil War before emigrating to Australia in 1929. Following this, he worked as a public servant in Tasmania before the outbreak of the Second World War when he joined the Australian Army and subsequently went on to serve in the Australian commandos, taking part in the fighting in New Guinea and Borneo. Following the end of the war, Harcourt retired from the military and returned to working for the Tasmanian government. He died in 1970 at the age of 75. First World War Harcourt was born in Westcliff-on-Sea, in Essex, England, on 13 February 1895. In 1914, he entered the British Army as a second lieutenant with a Regular commission. Initially, he served with the 1st Battalion, Royal Dublin Fusiliers, taking part in the disastrous Gallipoli campaign before he was seconded to the Machine Gun Corps with whom he served on the Western Front in France and Belgium. With this service Harcourt was quickly promoted, first to acting captain, then acting major by the time he was 23 years old.Trigellis- Smith 1992, p. 2. Despite holding these acting ranks, he was not substantively promoted to lieutenant until mid-1918, although when it was announced his seniority was backdated to November 1917. At one point he held three different ranks, a substantive rank of second lieutenant, a temporary rank of lieutenant and an acting rank of major. For his service during the war, Harcourt received a Distinguished Service Order, a Military Cross, and was mentioned in despatches three times. He also received the French Croix de Guerre and the Légion d'honneur.Trigellis-Smith 1992, pp. 2–5. Russian Civil War In early 1919, Harcourt was attending a staff course in the United Kingdom when he heard about the deteriorating situation in North Russia. Hoping to secure a position on the Relief Force that was being sent, Harcourt went to the War Office where he offered his services. Due to his experience with the Machine Gun Corps, he was offered command of a machine gun unit with the acting rank of major. However, the unit had not been formed and Harcourt was told that it was up to him to carry out his own recruiting. Having met a number of Australian soldiers during the previous war, Harcourt decided to go to the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) headquarters at Horseferry Road, where he spoke to a number of officers and other ranks who were still waiting for repatriation to Australia. Finding that there was considerable enthusiasm, particularly amongst the other ranks, Harcourt eventually arranged for the recruitment of between 400 and 500 Australians into the British Army for service in RussiaMuirden 1990, p. 53. although in the end only about 150–300 Australians completed the process.Dennis et al 1995, pp. 436–437. These men formed part of the North Russia Relief Force (NRRF), which departed for Archangel in the SS Czar and Czarina. Soon after landing in Archangel in June 1919 the NRRF began an offensive campaign designed to push the Bolshevik forces back so that the White Russian forces could carry out a withdrawal to Archangel.Dennis et al 1995, p. 437. This offensive was initially focused upon the railways and river systems and Harcourt was ordered to move his unit along the Archangel–Vologda railway line and to engage any Bolshevik forces encountered. By July they had reached Obozerskaya, about south of Archangel and about north from Emtsa, where they established a base from which further operations against the Bolshevik forward areas. At this time Harcourt was placed in command of a composite company made up of machine gunners, artillerymen and infantry, which became known as \\"Harcourt Force\\".Bottrell 1974, p. 37. The unit carried out patrols and probing raids in their area of operations and Harcourt was tasked with planning an attack on Bolshevik positions around Emtsa. As the situation continued to deteriorate for the Allies plans were made for the force to begin withdrawing. On 29 August 1919, the last British offensive was launched at Emtsa. Harcourt's force was tasked with capturing an artillery battery in the main Bolshevik position, however, his guide led him to the wrong objective in the darkness and suddenly the company came under intense and unexpectedly heavy fire. Although wounded, Harcourt liaised with a company from the 45th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, and together they captured the main battery. For this action Harcourt received a Bar to his DSO.Bradley 2004, p. 14. The citation reads: The engagement ended with the surrender of the Bolshevik forces, however, as Harcourt prepared his men for an advance south to Vologda he received orders to pull back to Archangel and eventually they were evacuated back to England where the men were demoblised and Harcourt returned to the Royal Dublin Fusiliers. For his services, however, the Russian government-in-exile presented him with both the Order of Saint Vladimir and the Order of Saint Stanislaus, 2nd Class, with Swords.Challinger 2010, p. 209. Inter-war years During the 1920s Harcourt continued to serve with the British Army and was stationed in India. It was while he was on the subcontinent that he discovered an alternative route between India and Burma. The significance of this find was not immediately realised until 1942 when, after the Japanese invaded Burma and subsequently gained control of the only known route out of Burma, British intelligence recalled Harcourt's discovery and using this information the Allies were able to route their withdrawing armies and the large numbers of refugees around the main Japanese force back into India. This route became known as \\"Harcourt's Highway\\". In 1927, Harcourt took a leave of absence from the British Army and in 1929 he travelled to Australia. He eventually applied for a discharge from the army and decided to settle in Victoria. Later he moved to Tasmania where he took a job with the government and became a civil servant.McCarthy 1959, p. 279. He also became involved in the Boy Scouts and in 1933 he served as secretary and organiser of the first World Scout Jamboree to be held in Australia, taking place over Christmas 1933–34. On 28 April 1939, while he was working with the Youth Employment Office in Hobart, Harcourt was involved in a motor vehicle accident at Kings Meadows, Launceston. While attempting to take evasive action to avoid hitting a car that was driving on the wrong side of the road, Harcourt's car collided with a pedestrian who had been walking on the road. Although Harcourt rushed the pedestrian, an eight-year-old boy, to hospital, the boy's injuries proved fatal. An inquest was subsequently held and found that Harcourt was in no way to blame for the accident. Second World War When the Second World War broke out in September 1939 Harcourt sought to return to the United Kingdom to rejoin the British Army. As his job was considered vital to the war effort, the Australian government prevented him from leaving, however, he was eventually allowed to join the Militia.Bottrell 1974, p. 39. On 3 August 1940, he reported for war service and was appointed as a lieutenant. A short time later he was officially promoted to majorCommonwealth of Australia Gazette, Issue 190/40, p. 1955. and taken on the strength of the headquarters of the 6th Military District (Tasmania) as the brigade major of the 12th Infantry Brigade based at Brighton. In February 1941 Harcourt was allowed to transfer to the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF)—thus allowing him to serve overseasAt the time the provisions of the Defence Act (1903) prevented the government deploying members of the Militia overseas for active service. As a consequence of this, at the time Australia had two armies, the first one being the Militia for home defence and the 2nd AIF for deployment overseas. Later the provisions of the Act were changed to allow the deployment of the Militia to certain combat zones in the South West Pacific Area.—and after undergoing training at Puckapunyal he was subsequently posted to the 2/9th Armoured Regiment in August 1941, as the officer commanding 'C' Squadron. In mid-1942, Harcourt was seconded for special duties and was temporarily posted to the Guerrilla Warfare SchoolTrigellis-Smith 1992, p. 5. that had been set up at Wilsons Promontory in Victoria to begin training independent companies in irregular warfare techniques based on the recommendations of the British Military Mission in Australia, headed by Lieutenant Colonel J.C. Mawhood.Horner 1989, p. 21. In order to prove himself fit for active service with the independent companies Harcourt was required to pass a rigorous physical fitness and endurance program that was said to have tested even the instructors at the school, many of whom were a lot younger than Harcourt, who was 47 at the time. On 6 June 1942, Harcourt became the commanding officer of the 2/6th Independent Company, which would later be renamed the 2/6th Commando Squadron. Almost immediately Harcourt began the process of preparing the company for operational service in the Pacific.Trigellis-Smith 1992, pp. 5–6. A shortage of stores and equipment initially hampered the company's training, however, in mid July they entrained and were moved north to Queensland where they were initially based at Yandina before moving to Townsville on 28 July 1942.Trigellis-Smith 1992, pp. 8–9. On 2 August 1942, the company embarked on the MS Tasman bound for New Guinea.Trigellis-Smith 1992, pp. 10–11.Bottrell 1974, p. 40. On 6 August 1942, the 2/6th Independent Company disembarked in Port Moresby and shortly afterwards it was placed directly under the command of the headquarters of the 7th Division.Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 12. As the Japanese began to advance over the Owen Stanley Range towards Port Moresby the company began patrolling operations to the west of Port Moresby and Harcourt was given responsibility for advising divisional headquarters of Japanese movements around the Kokoda Track and to provide protection for the division's flanks.Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 13. Later, in November and December 1942 the company fought alongside the 126th and 128th Infantry Regiments around Buna, where they were used mainly in the reconnaissance role, but also as assault troops where necessary.Trigellis-Smith 1992, pp. 97–119. During this time, Harcourt reported directly to the 32nd Division's commander, Major General Edwin Harding on the location of Japanese forces, as well as the progress and disposition of US forces in the region.Bradley 2004, p. 15.Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 110. At the end of the fighting around Buna Harcourt was decorated with the Silver Star for gallantry by General MacArthur, who later singled the 2/6th Independent Company out for special praise in his Order of the Day on 9 January 1943.Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 118. The award was later reported in Hobart's The Mercury newspaper on 21 January 1943. In writing the official history of the Australian involvement in the early campaigns in the Pacific, Dudley McCarthy described Harcourt as being \\"an intrepid officer whose forty- seven years seemingly had done nothing to lessen his zest for living, his energy or his physical endurance\\". Nevertheless, in July 1943, following service in New Guinea Harcourt was told that he was too old for active service and was subsequently detached to the headquarters of II Corps on 18 July 1943 before officially relinquishing command of the 2/6th on 8 August 1943.Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 148. He was later transferred to the Jungle Warfare Training Centre at Canungra, in Queensland, where he served as a senior instructorTrigellis-Smith 1992, p. 151. and then later commanding officer of the 3rd Australian Reinforcement Training Battalion (Jungle Warfare). In late 1944, Harcourt was able to secure a posting to the 2/7th Cavalry Commando Regiment, one of three Australian commando regiments that were set up to administer the independent companies, and he became the regimental second-in-command.Bottrell 1974, p. 41. In May 1945, Harcourt took part in the landing at Balikpapan, after the regiment was committed to the fighting on Borneo late in the war. Following the end of hostilities in September 1945 Harcourt was repatriated to Tasmania and on 20 November 1945 his appointment in the 2nd AIF was terminated. Later life Upon leaving the Army in 1946, Harcourt returned to the public service, being appointed the Deputy Director of Industrial Training in Tasmania under the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme.Bottrell 1974, p. 41. He remained in this role until 1949 when he undertook a research position with the Industrial Development Branch of the Premier's Department (Tasmania). During this time, Harcourt was also actively involved in Legacy, helping to establish facilities at Coningham, teaching night classes in carpentry and metal work.Bottrell 1974, p. 42. Between 1952 and 1967 Harcourt served as State Secretary of the Tasmanian branch of the Australian Legion of Ex-Servicemen and Women. In 1954 he was the official transport officer for the Royal visit to Australia. In 1955, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen's Birthday Honours List for his community work and involvement in the public service.The award has been listed on the Australian Honours Database as \\"Henry Gladwin Harcourt\\". Additionally while the database lists the date of conferment as being 1955, Trigellis-Smith states that it was 1957. During 1957–58, Harcourt served as the President of Legacy's Hobart Branch.

The system is actually a commercial off the shelf (COTS) product from Omnitracs, and is in use by commercial trucking fleets throughout the world. Initially, when the system was first in use by the US Army in Europe (USAREUR), it was run through an Alcatel contract out of Paris with a data feed to the USAREUR G4 Logistics Automation Division (LAD). After it became more heavily used, it was determined that the Army needed its own secure hub on a military base in Germany. This hub was located in Mannheim, Germany outside of Coleman Barracks at a location known as the \\"tank-farm\\". This location was chosen because it already housed other satellite hubs, one of which was for AFN. The Land Earth Station (LES) portion of the system was maintained by a company called Data Path (which was acquired by Rockwell Collins in 2009http://www.rockwellcollins.com/news/page12220.html). The servers that processed the messages and GPS location information through the QTRACS software were initially housed in Friedrichsfeld, Germany and maintained by the USAREUR G4 office. The G4 contracted this work out to the Titan Corporation (now owned by L3 Communications). Management of the program was eventually turned over to PEO EIS.http://www.eis.army.mil/ The servers were eventually moved to Kilbourne Kasserne in Schwetzingen. This move was made because the facility at Friedrichsfeld was not robust enough and had a poor communications path with no redundancy. The site in Schwetzingen, also known as \\"Site-S\\", had better comms and was also an official military Network Operations Center (NOC). At its height, there were three server stacks for processing DTRACS data. One stack for European devices, another for devices in SWA and a third for receiving a split-feed from the KBR (Kellog Brown and Root) owned and operated server. While KBR had their own vehicles and server, all three systems used the same satellite for their communications. As of January 2010 the KBR solution still exists, but was moved to Ramstein Airbase. On the military side, the system was replaced by a newer system called Movement Tracking System, or MTS. The last use of DTRACS by US military personnel was in early 2007. While some devices are still used by KBR in their deployment, the military decided to switch to MTS instead of DTRACS for its logistics tracking solution. The primary reason for the switch is that MTS provided a mapping capability in the vehicle. Of course this came at a price. A typical DTRACS device cost in the neighborhood of $2,500, while an MTS device cost approximately $20,000 or more. Further funding for MTS from the military allowed the system to have Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) included in the system. This allowed the trucks to read active ANSI and ISO18000 RFIDRadio-frequency identification tags that were included in its cargo and report live locations back to the Radio Frequency - In-Transit Visibility (RF-ITV) system maintained by PEO EIS Product Director Automated Movement and Identification Solutions (PD AMIS)http://www.eis.army.mil/programs/amis  Capabilities  DTRACS devices were capable of sending messages to each other and their dispatchers. The dispatchers used either a DTRACS device in a box (referred to as a \\"Fly Away Kit\\" or FAK) or online software (QTRACS) to send and receive messages from the drivers. While the DTRACS FAK only allowed limited communications, the QTRACS software allowed the dispatcher to see all communications they sent to and from their trucks as well as their assigned vehicles \\"truck to truck\\" messages. It also provided topographical maps, and where necessary, satellite imagery provided by NIMA (now NGA). Vehicles could send free text messages containing up to 1,900 characters. There were all preformatted or 'canned' messages where the driver only needed to fill in blank fields and hit send. Such messages included NBC1 reports, NEDIVAC message and arrival and departure messages among others.

The historical region of Irahistan consists of several counties in Fars Province (Larestan, Khonj, Gerash, Lamerd) and Bastak County in Hormozgan. In Bahrain, Sunni Bahrainis of Achomi ancestry are known as Hola. Achomi people speak the Achomi language.

The majority of Achomi people are Sunni Muslims, with a Shia minority. In the thirteenth century, Lar briefly became a center of trade and commerce in southern Persia.

Both texts have been dated within the period 1370–1410 and the Charter Fragment is given in two Cornish orthographies. (Earlier examples of written Cornish exist but these are the first in continuous prose or verse.) Background It was not until the reign of Athelstan that the Cornish kings became subject to the rulers of Wessex: even so the border was established irrevocably on the east bank on the Tamar and in ecclesiastical matters Cornwall was added to the territory of the Bishops of Sherborne. Under Canute it ceased to be subject to the King of England and only later, at an unknown date in Edward the Confessor's reign was annexed again. After the Conquest the Earldom of Wessex was broken up and soon Cornwall was established as a Norman earldom of importance. Cornwall was regarded as a separately named province, with its own subordinated status and title under the English crown, with separate ecclesiastical provision in the earliest phase. There were subsequent constitutional provisions under the Stannary Parliament, which had its origins in provisions of 1198 and 1201 separating the Cornish and Devon tin interests and developing into a separate parliament for Cornwall maintaining Cornish customary law. From 1337, Cornwall was further administered as a 'quasi- sovereign' royal Duchy during the later medieval period. The implication of these processes for the Cornish language was to ensure its integrity throughout this period. It was until early modern times the general speech of essentially the whole population and all social classes. The situation changed rapidly with the far-reaching political and economic changes from the end of the medieval period onwards. Language-shift from Cornish to English progressed through Cornwall from east to west from this period onwards. Growth in population continued to a likely peak of 38,000 before the demographic reversal of the Black Death in the 1340s. Thereafter numbers of Cornish speakers were maintained at around 33,000 between the mid-fourteenth and mid- sixteenth centuries against a background of substantial increase in the total Cornish population. From this position the language then inexorably declined until it died out as community speech in parts of Penwith at the end of the eighteenth century. =Linguistic changes= During this middle period, Cornish underwent changes in its phonology and morphology. An Old Cornish vocabulary survives from ca. 1100, and manumissions in the Bodmin Gospels from even earlier (ca. 900). Placename elements from this early period have been 'fossilised' in eastern Cornwall as the language changed to English, as likewise did Middle Cornish forms in Mid-Cornwall, and Late Cornish forms in the west. These changes can be used to date the changeover from Cornish to English in local speechways, which together with later documentary evidence enables the areas within which Cornish successively survived to be identified. Middle Cornish is best represented by the Ordinalia, which comprise a cycle of mystery plays written in Cornish, it is believed at Glasney College, Kerrier, in west Cornwall, between 1350 and 1450, and performed throughout areas where the language was still extant in open-air amphitheatres (playing-places or 'rounds' - plenys-an-gwary in Cornish) which still exist in many places. There is also a surviving religious poem Pascon agan Arluth (The Passion of Our Lord) which enable a linguistic corpus of Middle Cornish to be ascertained. Later miracle play compositions include: Beunans Meriasek (the Life of St. Meriadoc) datable to 1504; and William Jordan of Helston's Gwreans an Bys (The Creation of the World). These may hark back to older forms of the language, for other writings in the sixteenth century show the language to have been undergoing substantial changes which brought it into its latest surviving form (Late or Modern Cornish). These writings include John Tregear's translation of Bishop Bonner's 'Homilies' c. 1556. The Charter Fragment, ca. 1400 Reverse of British Library Add. Ch. 19491, showing the Middle Cornish poem known as the Charter Fragment The Charter Fragment is a short poem about marriage, believed to be the earliest extant connected text in the language. It was identified in 1877 by Henry Jenner among charters from Cornwall in the British Museum and published by Jenner and by Whitley Stokes.Jenner, H.

A journalist named Robert Blackstone came to interview her. They were married a year later on Dec. 6, 1928, and he became her manager. Travels in nature Following their marriage, the couple travelled through the western United States in a home-made \\"flivver bungalow\\", a trailer that they dubbed the \\"Brownie House\\". They explored the country; Postle honed her art, accepted commissions and drew inspiration from the American landscape for her future work.\\"A Rare Bird: The Art and Life of Joy Postle\\", by Denise Hall; in Reflections, a journal of the Orange County Regional History Center, Spring 2009. Chronicler of the Florida environment They arrived in Florida in 1934 and continued their nomadic life, camping, hiking and bird watching; these explorations gave Postle the opportunity of closely studying nature and refining her craft. In 1937, Postle was involved in the WPA Art Project. Three years later, Blackstone conceived the idea for their \\"Glamour Birds\\" act in which bird song, recorded by Blackstone, and music accompanied Postle as she painted birds and educated her audience. Postle and Blackstone eventually settled in a modest home and studio on Lake Rose at Orlo Vista near Gotha, Florida in 1942. Postle counted many creative people in her circle of friends including the Chicago / Florida Prairie Style architect Hermann V. von Holst whose portrait she drew. \\"Joy told me once that she had performed for Carl Sandburg,\\" her step-grandson Daren Kelly remembers.

Later years A fire at their home in 1968 killed Blackstone and badly injured Postle. After years of extensive surgery, she resumed her performances and exhibitions. She continued taking commissions for pet portraits, exhibiting her work, and selling paintings well into old age.

A National Guard Armory, National Guard Armory Building, or National Guard Readiness Center is any one of numerous buildings of the U.S. National Guard where a unit trains, meets, and parades. A readiness center supports the training, administration, and logistics of National Guard units by providing assembly space, classrooms, weapons and protective personal equipment storage, and training space. Readiness centers can also be utilized as communal assembly areas, utilized by local organizations and governments. After World War II, the Section 5 Committee of the Office of the Chief of Staff, War Department, chaired by MG Milton Reckord, approved a policy of constructing National Guard armories using 75% federal and 25% state funding. In 1968, the Army National Guard had 2,786 armories; in 2000 the Army National Guard had 3,166 armories in 2,679 communities. In 2009, the Kansas Adjutant General's Department announced it would be closing 18 of its then-56 National Guard armories \\"due to state budget cuts.\\" A report to Congress in 2014 noted that some National Guard armories are in poor or failing condition, with \\"the average nationwide [Readiness Center] condition [being] fair, but bordering on poor…\\".

Development  At the end of World War II many German engineers were 'seconded' by the Soviet government to continue their advanced research under direct supervision of the USSR. One of the most significant German teams was OKB-1 (opytno-konstruktorskoye byuro – experimental design bureau) set up in GOZ-1 (Gosudarstvenny opytnyy zavod – state experimental plant) at Dubna near Moscow. OKB-1, with Dr. Brunolf Baade as chief designer, continued work on German-built aircraft such as the EF-131 and '140', which used many components of the two EF-131's, as well as design work on the stillborn EF 132 long-range bomber. By early 1948 Semyon M. Alekseyev had been appointed supervisor/chief warden/supervisor of OKB-1, with Dr. Brunolf Baade remaining as chief designer. This has caused confusion in the past with '150' being ascribed to Alekseyev and not OKB-1 (OKB-1 was not named after Baade for propaganda reasons). In 1948 OKB-1 started design work on a new jet bomber, designated RB-2 (Reaktiivnyy Bombardirovshchik – jet bomber), to a specification drawn up by ADD (Aviahtsiya Dahl'nevo Deystviya - long range aviation). This design evolved until the use of a new designation seemed prudent and thus '150' was born. (Note:- many aviation writers use Samolyet/aircraft or Izdeliye/product descriptors when the aircraft was simply called '150', the same applies to '140' and its variants.). The '150' was originally to be powered by two Lyul'ka TR-3 turbojet engines, but on 20 May OKB-1 was ordered to use Mikulin AMRD-04 engines, this decision was eventually overturned and the smaller, lighter and less powerful Lyul'ka TR-3A was finally selected. The '150' was constructed throughout with light alloy stressed skin and high-strength steel for highly stressed parts. The fuselage was of oval section fore and aft with a cylindrical section in the middle. The 35° shoulder-mounted swept wings had 1 o 20' anhedral on the lower surface, outboard of rib 4. The outrigger undercarriages were mounted in large pods at the wingtips which also served as endplates and anti-flutter balance weights. The upper surface of the wings had two wing fences on each side. The 45° swept fin and 40° swept tailplane were constructed in a similar fashion to the wings, the tailplane attached to the extremity of the fin with eight degrees of dihedral to improve longitudinal stability, and a large carrot-like fairing at the fin/tailplane junction. The main and nose undercarriages retracted aft into the fuselage, with the main undercarriage able to kneel for takeoff making takeoff possible on shorter runways. The twin-wheeled nose and main gears had levered suspension and different tracks to improve rough-field performance. The kneeling undercarriage was initiated at the start of the takeoff run and gradually bled oil out of the Oleo-pneumatic strut until the required incidence of three degrees was reached just before liftoff. After takeoff the undercarriage was selected to retract which reversed the oil flow as the undercarriage retracted. All undercarriages were enclosed with fairings and doors when retracted. The bicycle undercarriage arrangement was tested on the Alekseyev I-215D. The seven-stage axial compressor Lyul'ka TR-3A (later AL-5) turbojet engines, with variable exhaust nozzles and petrol engine starters, were housed in the streamlined nacelles attached to pylons at 26% span. To boost takeoff performance, four '126-1' JATO rockets of 2,000 kg (4,410 lb)for 17s could be attached to the rear fuselage ('129-1' JATO bottles were used on the prototype). The control system of the '150' was revolutionary for its time, with irreversible, electrically signalled and electrically driven screwjacks operating the control surfaces. This was one of the first \\"fly by wire\\" aircraft as well as one of the first all-powered flying control aircraft, albeit without the benefit of modern computers. Doubts about the control system were allayed at an early stage by extensive testing and demonstrations with an 'iron bird' test rig which duplicated the system installed in the aircraft, and a captured Ju 388L, designated '145', which was modified with the electrical control system. The electrical power source for the flying controls also raised doubts about the ability of the electrical system to cope, especially with an engine failure. To provide electrical power in the event of generator or engine failure a drop-down RAT(ram air turbine), driven by ram air in the aircraft slipstream provided a backup system. The defensive armament was carried in remotely controlled dorsal and tail barbettes, with the dorsal gunner sitting at the rear of the large cockpit facing rearwards and the tail gunner in the tail operating the tail barbette. The pilot controlled a single forward-firing fixed cannon in the starboard forward fuselage. Up to 6,000 kg (13,320 lb) of bombs were to be carried internally in the fuselage bomb bay between the nose and main undercarriages. The forward fuselage pressure cabin housed the pilot. The co-pilot/radio-operator and dorsal gunner were accommodated under a large greenhouse-style canopy, the navigator in the extreme nose, and the tail-gunner in his own pressure cabin sitting on a downward-firing ejection seat. The forward compartment crew members were intended to have ejection seats but photographic evidence in the reference given does not show this. '150' was provided with the latest radios, radars and navigation aids, with a ground mapping bombsight radar in a chin fairing under the nose, which also housed the taxi and landing lamps. Despite the high priority given to the actual aircraft, progress was slow during the design and construction phases due, in no small part, to the low priority given to the foreign OKB for resources. Baade was in constant contact with the 'powers that be' defending the slow progress but falling short of blaming the paranoid administration system. As well as the bureaucratic setbacks, the aircraft had a steady stream of system and structural failures which needed to be addressed before the aircraft could fly. On top of the problems already mentioned the OKB were forced to stop work completely in June and July 1949 while the conversion of the '140' into the '140-R' was given the highest priority, (in hindsight this was a complete waste of resources). Flight trials finally began in September 1952. but progressed slowly due to the weather and rectifying the defects discovered during the trials. The seventeenth flight on 9 May 1953 proved to be the last, when the pilot Yakov I. Vernikov misjudged the flare on landing, the aircraft ballooned and stalled into the runway from approx 10m. Extensive but repairable damage was caused, but the '150' was never repaired, with test rigs, airframe components, and other parts dispersed to other OKB's. OKB-1 was disbanded and the German engineers were repatriated to the GDR.

Life He was the son of Robert Talbot of Carton, County Kildare, who was the third son of Sir Thomas Talbot of Malahide, County Dublin; his mother was Jenet FitzGerald, daughter of Thomas Fitzgerald. He was educated for the law, and attained a leading position as a lawyer in Dublin. About 1603 he was appointed Recorder of Dublin, but, being a staunch Roman Catholic, which was a bar to public office he was soon afterwards removed from office for recusancy. On 13 April 1613 he was returned to the Irish Parliament as MP for County Kildare, and became the unofficial legal adviser to the Roman Catholic party in the Irish House of Commons (they were a minority in the House, but a very large one). Thomas Ryves, a close ally of the new Speaker, complained to the Westminster government that Talbot had abetted the return to Parliament of two schismatics. During the stormy scenes which marked the election of a Speaker in the Irish House of Commons, culminating with one of the rival Speakers (who was an extremely fat man) sitting on the other, Talbot urged that the House should first purge itself of members elected by illegal means. On 30 May he was appointed by the House one of the deputies to represent to James I the corrupt practices employed in the elections to secure a Protestant majority, and the arbitrary treatment of the Anglo-Irish Catholics. He crossed to England in July, and was examined by the Privy Council on his conduct in the Irish House of Commons. During the discussion of this question Archbishop George Abbot demanded Talbot's opinion on a book (probably the Defensio fidei Catholicae adversus Anglicanae sectae errores) in which (he said) Francisco Suárez openly maintained the right of Catholics to kill an heretical king. Talbot hesitated, but acknowledged James as the lawful king. The Council was not satisfied with his answers, and on 17 July Talbot was committed to the Tower of London. On 13 November 1613 the Star Chamber sentenced him to a fine of £10,000. Early in the following year, however, Talbot was allowed to return to Ireland, and the fine was probably remitted. James I, on releasing him, disclaimed any intention of forcing the Irish Catholics to change their religion. From this time Talbot became a supporter of the government, but took little part in politics. On 4 February 1622 he was created a baronet, and he subsequently received various grants of land. He died on 16 March 1633 and is buried in Laraghbryan Cemetery outside Maynooth. Marriage and children By his wife Alison, daughter of John Netterville of Castleton, co. Meath, Talbot had issue eight sons and eight daughters. The eldest son, Robert, succeeded as second baronet, and from Robert's daughter Frances, who married Richard Talbot of Malahide, descended the Baron Talbot de Malahide. The second son was Peter Talbot, Archbishop of Dublin, and the eighth was Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell. Tyrconnel became Lord Lieutenant during the reign of James II, overhauling the Royal Irish Army which then fought in the War of the Two Kings # Robert; # Peter; and # Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell. Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, Sir William's eighth son Of Sir William's daughters, Margaret married the landowner Sir Henry Talbot; Frances married James Cusack, grandson of Sir Thomas Cusack, Lord Chancellor of Ireland; Eleanor married Sir Henry O'Neill, 1st Baronet, of Killelagh, and was the mother of Sir Neil O'Neill and of Rose O'Neill, foster daughter and heir-at-law of Rose MacDonnell, Marchioness of Antrim; Mary married Sir John Dongan, 2nd Baronet, and had at least ten children, including Sir Walter Dongan, 3rd Baronet, William Dongan, 1st Earl of Limerick, and Thomas Dongan, 2nd Earl of Limerick.

Despite the universal currency of the term \\"Four Oirat\\" among Eastern Mongols, Oirats, and numerous explanations by historians, no consensus has been reached on the identity of the original four tribes. While it is believed that the term Four Oirats refers to the Choros, Torghut, Dorbet and Khoid tribes,René Grousset Empire of Steppes, p.341 there is a theory that the Oirats were not consanguineous units, but political-ethnic units composed of many patrilineages.C. P. Atwood Enc, p.310 Background The Oirats were one of the forest peoples who lived in west of the Mongols of Genghis Khan. They submitted to Genghis in 1207 and played prominent roles in the history of the Mongol Empire. After the overthrow of the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), Möngke-Temür, a high official of the Yuan, had placed himself at the head of the Oirats. When he died, three chieftains, Mahamu (Mahmud), Taiping and Batu-bolad, ruled them.E. Bretschneider-Mediaeval Researches from Eastern Asiatic Sources,p.161 They sent envoys with gifts to the Ming dynasty. In 1409, the Yongle Emperor (r. 1402–1424) bestowed upon them the title of wang in return. The Oirats began to challenge the Borjigin Emperors in the reign of Elbeg Khan (c. 1394–1399). It is curious to find one of the 3 chief was with Muslim name, Mahmud. Before 1640, the Oirats had been wavering between the two faiths, Islam and Buddhism. Both these creeds had supporters among the pagan Oirats.Fred Walter Bergholz The partition of the steppe, p.52 Apogee The Chinese Yongle Emperor demanded Öljei Temür Khan Bunyashiri to accept his supremacy in 1409 but Öljei Temür refused and defeated a Ming force the next year. In 1412 a large force under Yongle forced Öljei Temür Khan to flee westward. The Oirats led by Mahamu of Choros killed Öljei Temür who suffered great loss.Altan tobchi, p.158 The Western Mongols had Delbeg Khan, a descendant of Ariq Böke, whose family had been relegated to Mongolia during the Yuan, crowned. However, the Eastern Mongols under Arugtai of the Asud refused to accept the new khan and they were in constant war with each other. The Ming dynasty intervened aggressively against any overpowerful Mongol leader, exacerbating the Mongol- Oirat conflict. In 1408 Mahamu was succeeded by his son Toghan, who continued his strife with Arugtai chingsang. By 1437, Toghan had totally defeated Arugtai and an Ögedeid Emperor Adai Khan. Toghan made Genghisid princes his puppet khans of the Mongolia-based Northern Yuan dynasty. When he died in 1438, his son Esen became a taishi. The Oirats had close relations with Moghulistan and Hami where the Chagatayid Khans reigned. From the Ming chronicles, it is known that the Oirats conducted regular raids on those areas. Esen crushed the Moghulistan and Hami monarchs and forced them to accept him as their overlord. He also conquered Outer and Inner Mongolia and subjugated the Jurchens in Manchuria. The Ming's Zhengtong Emperor was captured by Esen in 1449. During his reign, the Oirat headquarters was centered on north-west Mongolia and Barkol and the Irtysh were the western limits of their settlement. Esen relied on Muslim merchants from Samarkand, Hami and Turpan and his own royal house: Choros was related to Moghulistan according to a myth. After murdering Khagan Agbarjin, Esen took the title khan for himself. But soon after he was overthrown by the Oirat noblemen and killed by a son of a man whom he executed. Decline Esen's death broke up the unity of the Oirats. They now warred with each other for leadership. Esen's son Amasanj moved west, pillaging the lands of Hami, Moghulistan and the Uzbegs.Dmitri Pokotilov, Wolfgang Franke History of the Eastern Mongols During the Ming Dynasty from 1368 to 1634, p.31 From 1480 on, the Eastern Mongols under Mandukhai Khatun and Dayan Khan pushed the Oirats westward. By 1510 Dayan Khan had unified the entire Mongol nation including Oirats. However, the Khalkhas and some princes of southwest Inner Mongolia repeatedly launched massive attacks on the Oirats and looted their properties in the Irtysh, Barkol and Altai from 1552 to 1628. The Oirats were still powerful in Mongolia even after the fall of Esen and continued to hold Karakorum until the 16th century when Altan Khan recaptured the city from the hands of the Oirats. Oppressed and subjugated by Altan Khan of the Khalkha, Oirat confederation crushed the Khalkha prince Sholoi Ubaashi Khungtaiji perhaps around 1623. Collapse The collapse of the confederation of the Oirats began with Torghuds, along with the Dorbets and a few Khoshud clansmen, seceding from the union. In 1628 the Torghud chief Khoo Orlug with some Dorbeds and Khoshuuds moved westward across the Kazakh steppes.René Grousset The Empire of the Steppes, p.521 The little jüz of the Kazakhs and the Nogais tried to halt them at Nemba and Astrakhan but were defeated by the Torghuds. The Torghuds subjugated local Turkic peoples of Manghyslak and Caspian Sea. They colonized the Volga Delta and occupied whole steppes north of the Caspian, establishing the Kalmyk Khanate.Stephan Thernstrom, Ann Orlov, Oscar Harvard encyclopedia of American ethnic groups, p.599 The Kalmyks plundered the Khanate of Khiva from 1603 to 1670. The Kalmyk Khanate proved good allies to the Russian Empire. The Khoshuud Güshi Khan went to Qinghai (Koke Nuur) in 1636. He increased his possessions in Tibet and Amdo. Güshi Khan protected the 5th Dalai Lama and his Yellow Church from the old red clergy of the Tibetan Buddhism.Charles Sherring, Thomas George Longstaff Western Tibet and the British Border Land, p.246 The Khoshut Khanate defeated the enemy of the Dalai Lama and Güshi Khan appointed his son ruler of Tibet.Rolf Alfred Stein, J. E. Driver Tibetan civilization, p.82 About 1620 the Choros scattered after bitter fighting with the Khalkha Altan Khan. Some of the Choros fled with a body of the Dorbed northward into Siberia and present-day Baranaoul. But the majority of the Choros with the Dorbeds and the Khoids settled in the region of the Black Irtysh, the Urungu, the Imil, and the Ili, forming the Dzungar Khanate.Fred Walter Bergholz The partition of the steppe, p.353 In 1640 the Oirats and the Khalkha made peace and formed an alliance, issuing new code, the Mongol–Oirat code. Led by the Khoshuud nobility, the Oirats began to convert to Buddhism. They became the chief defenders of the Dalai and Panchen Lamas. The Oirats who used the Mongolian script adopted in 1648–49 the clear script designed by the Oirat cleric and scholar Zaya Pandita Namkhaijamtsu. Despite their geographical distribution, the Oirats maintained strong ties with each other and remained powerful players of Inner Asian politics until 1771.C. P.

In July of 2020 he became Director of Enrollment Management and Student Success at Touro University California's College of Osteopathic Medicine, where he has served professionally for 23 years. Walter Hartwig graduated summa cum laude in anthropology at the University of Missouri in 1986. He undertook graduate work in biological anthropology under the late Francis Clark Howell at the University of California at Berkeley in 1986, where he developed an interest in South American monkeys.Photograph of Walter Hartwig, Ph.D., at Touro University California Graduation Ceremony, June 2009 Academic career Fieldwork in Colombia introduced Hartwig to Alfred L. Rosenberger, who soon became a mentor and colleague with whom he continues to collaborate. Hartwig’s early publications emerged from their shared interest in the fossil record of South American monkeys, of which Hartwig is now an international authority. Hartwig turned to comparative cranial anatomy for his dissertation research, conducted at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. This led to later publications on the relationship of brain development to face development. During his research time in Chicago, Hartwig taught for the University of Illinois at Chicago, Loyola University, and Indiana University – Northwest. After obtaining his Ph.D. from UC-Berkeley in 1993 he moved to Washington, DC, to further his collaborations with Rosenberger, who at that time was a senior postdoctoral fellow at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. Later that year, Hartwig accepted a two-year postdoctoral research and teaching position in the Department of Anatomical Sciences at Stony Brook University. He had the opportunity there to work closely with John Fleagle, whose broad vision of primate evolution has been a significant influence in Hartwig’s writings. He moved back to Washington, DC, in 1995 as a Visiting Lecturer for George Washington University, and then returned to Berkeley in 1996 as a Lecturer in anthropology. In 1997 what is now the Touro University College of Osteopathic Medicine opened in San Francisco and Hartwig joined the founding faculty as an anatomist. He served as Chair of Basic Sciences from 2003–2009, Assistant Dean of Clinical Education from 2010-2013, Chair of Admissions from 2012-2017, and Associate Dean of Academic Affairs from 2013-2020. Research Hartwig’s early research in the primate fossil record led to field projects in Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia and Tanzania. Together with eminent Brazilian paleontologist Castor Cartelle he published and named the first evidence of extinct \\"mega-monkeys\\", two species that were more than twice the size of any living South American monkey. In 2002, Hartwig edited a critically acclaimed reference volume, The Primate Fossil Record for Cambridge University Press. To date Hartwig has authored three books, and published research in 14 different peer-reviewed journals and nine books across primatology, evolution, education and the history of science. After several years of developing a gross anatomy curriculum in his medical school professorship, Hartwig published a textbook in 2007. Following his medical school administration service he published a guide to medical school admissions and curriculum in 2009, now in its second edition. His interests in scientific credibility have led to an appearance on the Today Show, and testimony in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Australia. Awards and recognition Hartwig’s research has been funded through grants from the National Geographic Society, the Louis S.B. Leakey Foundation, and the Explorers Club. He has received study fellowships from the National Science Foundation, Robert H. Lowie Fellowship, Sigma Xi, and the Thomas J. Dee Foundation. In 2019-20 he was nominated by students to be the American Osteopathic Foundation Educator of the Year. In 2008 Hartwig became the subject of a Facebook fan site. Jeopardy! Hartwig appeared on Jeopardy! on September 20, 2000. After leading going into Final Jeopardy, Hartwig answered the question incorrectly and finished in 2nd place, winning a trip to South Carolina.

He was the first husband of Sibyl Hathaway, 21st Seigneur of Sark, and grandfather of her successor, Michael Beaumont. Life Beaumont was the son of William Spencer Beaumont and the great grandson of John Thomas Barber Beaumont, both British Army officers. While painting a portrait of her, Beaumont became infatuated with Sibyl Collings, the daughter of Seigneur William Frederick Collings of Sark. Despite her father's severe opposition, the couple eloped and married. Beaumont and Collings together had seven children: Bridget Amice Beaumont (1902-1948); Francis William Lionel Beaumont (1903-1941), father of John Michael Beaumont; Cyril John Astley Beaumont (1905-1973); Basil Ian Beaumont (1908-1909); Douce Alianore Daphne Beaumont (1910-1967); Richard Vyvyan Dudley Beaumont (b. 1915); Jehanne Rosemary Ernestine Beaumont (1919–88). Collings writes extensively about her relationship with Beaumont in her 1961 autobiography. Beaumont first joined the British Army as a part-time second lieutenant in the 2nd Volunteer Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment on 5 August 1905, but he resigned that commission on 24 March 1908. When the First World War began in 1914, Beaumont joined the 2/5 Battalion Gloucestershire Regiment, By 25 August 1915 he was a temporary lieutenant and was transferred to the General List for service with the West African Frontier Force (WAFF). On 1 May 1916 he was transferred back to the Glosters still in the rank of temporary lieutenant but was granted seniority in that rank from 27 September 1914. He was then further transferred to a labour battalion, the 36th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers on 17 June 1916. He relinquished his commission on 19 July 1917 due to ill-health. Official records show his date of qualification for the Silver War Badge as 11 September 1915, suggesting that whatever wound or disease eventually led to his discharge occurred or was contracted on that date. This source also indicates that he served in Cameroon.The medal card shows the theatre of war by the code 5c, which is decoded as Cameroon, see There is some contradiction of the official sources in family accounts: in an announcement of his son's marriage in 1924, his rank is given as captain;The official sources are the Gazettes and medal card previously referred to and also an official death notice in and his wife writes in relation to his death that in 1918 Beaumont was deployed in France when the Spanish flu pandemic brokeout and then had misfortune of being sent to London on leave at the height of the pandemic in that city. Beaumont died of the Spanish flu on 24 November 1918 at the age of 41. He is buried in Brookwood Cemetery in Brookwood, Surrey.Beaumont is buried in plot 182389.

Unusually for a UK by- election, the counting process was not started until the following day, for a variety of reasons including the high number of postal votes. The winner of the by-election was Chloe Smith of the Conservative Party, who at 27 became the youngest member of the House of Commons, known as the Baby of the House. Boundaries As boundary changes did not come into effect until the 2010 general election, Norwich North was fought on those boundaries in place at the 2005 general election. The constituency includes parts of two local government areas, Norwich and Broadland, with the majority of the electorate in Broadland. Nine wards of Broadland (Mile Cross, Crome, Thorpe St Andrew, Sprowston, Old Catton, Catton Grove, Hellesdon, Drayton and Taverham) fall within its boundaries, together with four wards of the City of Norwich (Catton Grove, Crome, Mile Cross, Sewell).

Secondary market Ticket exchanges allow people to buy and sell tickets online. For example, an individual who purchased tickets to a concert may find that they can no longer go and hence sell their tickets on a ticket exchange. Originally, this industry was dominated by street-based touts working outside large events and venues, buying tickets cheaply from people who had spares and selling them on to last-minute buyers. While some street touts may still exist, the advent of the internet has transformed the industry. Secondary markets today are predominantly online. There are two types of ticket exchanges, also called secondary marketplaces - for event tickets and for travel reservations. Ticket exchange in events Event ticket exchanges are predominantly dominated by four big players - StubHub, Viagogo, Seatwave and GetMeIn. Among these big online ticket marketplaces, smaller players are emerging offering slightly different services, like marketplaces which limit the price of the tickets to the current live price. The event ticket exchanges have suffered significant criticism in recent years for enabling 'armchair' touts.https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/nov/28/fan-to-fan-ticket- exchanges These are small groups of people who purchase a large number of event tickets before fans are able to purchase them for themselves. These groups then sell these tickets on the ticket exchanges for a significantly higher price. Ticket exchange in air travel There are online marketplaces where people can offer their transferable flight tickets and hotel reservations for sale. For travellers without travel insurance, it can reduce losses when unable to travel. Flights are transferable if the name on the ticket can be changed. There are over 60 airlines which allow name changeshttps://sparefare.net/Airlines. These airlines always charge a fee for this service.

The painting exemplified the Art for art's sake movement – a concept formulated by Pierre Jules Théophile Gautier and Charles Baudelaire. First shown at the Grosvenor Gallery in London in 1877, it is one of two works (the other being Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Firewheel) inspired by the Cremorne Gardens, a celebrated pleasure resort in London. One of his many works from his series of Nocturnes, it is the last of the London Nocturnes and is now widely acknowledged to be the high point of Whistler's middle period. Whistler's depiction of the industrial city park in The Falling Rocket includes a fireworks display in the foggy night sky. Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket is most famously known as the inception of the lawsuit between Whistler and the art critic John Ruskin. Composition Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket is fundamentally composed of bleak tones, with three main colors: blue, green, and yellow. Restricted in its use of colors, the piece develops a muted yet harmonious composition. The billowing smoke gives the viewer a clear distinction between the water and the sky, where the separation blurs into a cohesive and somber space. It is this large avalanche of fog that represents the rocket of the title. Dabs of yellow enliven the artwork as exploding fireworks in the misty air. The figures watching are almost transparent, their shapes general and simplistic. To the left, the artist signs his name in a manner that has clearly been influenced by Japanese prints, with thick, straight brushstrokes that appear to imitate Japanese characters. Influenced by Japanese artists like Utagawa Hiroshige, Whistler spent years perfecting his splatter technique. Eventually he possessed the ability to make an object or person with what appeared to be nothing more than a single flick of paint. Although Whistler's critics denounced his technique as reckless or lacking artistic merit, it is notable that Whistler spent much of his time with meticulous details, often going so far as to view his work through mirrors to ensure that no deficiencies were overlooked.Prideaux, pg. 110 Concept and theory The Falling Rocket retains a certain degree of colour-laden luminosity that provokes spatial ambiguity set against a structure of line and form. Nocturnes were a series of paintings which, through painterly style, were evocative of differing night time scenes. The artist insisted that they were not pictures, but rather, scenes or moments. Working against contemporary inclinations for narrative (indicative of the heavy consumption of literature), Whistler can be seen arguing for painting's essential difference from literature within this work, as colour and tone trounce hints of narrative or moral allusion. Whistler's focus was on coloristic effects as a means of creating a particular sensation. More than that, a Nocturne is concerned with its depiction of space, seeking a particular sense of void that seems to arise only in the night time. As part of the Art for Art's Sake movement, the artwork seeks to provide complex emotions that go beyond the technicalities of the imagery. Whistler believed that certain experiences were often best expressed by nuance and implication. These compositions were not designed to avoid the truth of a scene, but instead served as a means of reaching deeper, more hidden truths.Prideaux, pg. 173 His artistic endeavours no longer concerned themselves with physical accuracy, seeking only to capture the essence of an intangible, personal and intimate moment. Whistler has been quoted as saying \\"If the man who paints only the tree, or flower, or other surface he sees before him were an artist, the king of artists would be the photographer. It is for the artist to do something beyond this.” In essence, The Falling Rocket is the synthesis of a fireworks scene in London, and so by no means does it aim to look like it. Like his other Nocturnes, the painting is meant to be seen as an arrangement, set to invoke particular sensations for the audience. Controversy Affronted by The Falling Rocket, John Ruskin accused Whistler of \\"flinging a pot of paint in the public's face\\" in the Fors Clavigera.Merrill, Linda, After Whistler: The Artist and His Influence on American Painting. City: Publisher, 2003. Pg. 112 As a leading art critic of the Victorian era, Ruskin's harsh critique of The Falling Rocket caused an uproar among owners of other Whistler works. Rapidly, it became shameful to have a Whistler piece, pushing the artist into greater financial difficulties.Prideaux, pg. 132 With his pride, finances, and the significance of his Nocturne at stake, Whistler sued Ruskin for libel in defence. In court, he asked the jury to not view it as a traditional painting, but instead as an artistic arrangement.Stuttaford, Genevieve. \\"Nonfiction – the Aesthetic Movement by Lionel Lambourne.\\" Vol. 243. (1996). In his explanation, he insisted that the painting was a representation of the fireworks from the Cremorne Gardens. During the trial, Sir John Holker asked, \\"Not a view of the Cremorne?\\" to which Whistler was quoted as saying, \\"If it were a view of Cremorne, it would certainly bring about nothing but disappointment on the part of the beholders.\\"Prideaux, pg. 126 However, his case was not helped when The Falling Rocket was accidentally presented to trial upside down.Prideaux, pp. 135–136 His explanation of the composition proved fruitless before the judge. The Ruskin vs. Whistler Trial, which took place on November 25 and 26, 1878, was disastrous for Whistler. While he did not lose, he only won a farthing.Whistler, James Abbott McNeill. WebMuseumn, Paris After all the court costs, he had no choice but to declare bankruptcy. Whistler was forced to pawn, sell, and mortgage everything he could get his hands on.Prideaux, pg. 123 Whistler included a transcript of the case in his 1890 book The Gentle Art of Making Enemies. John Ruskin was not aware of the effort and theory that had gone into Nocturne in Black and Gold when he accused The Falling Rocket of being a public insult. Ruskin had berated Whistler's paintings long before the event leading up to the trial. Four years earlier he had denounced Whistler's art as \\"absolute rubbish\\".Prideaux, pg. 122 It is speculated that Ruskin was envious of Whistler's close relationship with Charles Augustus Howell, who often aided Whistler financially – especially after the court case.Pennell, Elizabeth and Joseph Pennell. The Life of James McNeill Whistler. London: Ballantyne Press, 2012. pp. 81–82 It is also said that the artist's lack of homage offended Ruskin. Whistler was not the only person disturbed by the art critic's commentary. Henry James was one individual that spoke out against Ruskin, remarking that Ruskin had begun to overstep his bounds as an art critic, becoming tyrannical in his diction – so much so that to see him brought to court over his offensive words was perceived as a delight.Prideaux, pg. 129 It has been suggested John Ruskin suffered from CADASIL syndrome and the visual disturbances this condition caused him might have been a factor in his irritation at this particular painting.Kempster PA, Alty JE.

A graphic novel serialization relating to the anime is being published in Japanese magazine Animage, beginning from its July 2009 issue. However, on June 29, 2013, Ryūtarō Nakamura died due to pancreatic cancer. At Overload 2014, ABe announced that a new director was found to continue working on Despera. In 2018, Yoshitoshi ABe and Chiaki J. Konaka said the reason Despera is in development hell isn't due to the lack of funds, but because of the current state of the anime industry. Story The story centers around a 12-year-old girl named Ain, who often builds devices despite the lack of scientific background for them. The sci-fi alternative period story is set in Tokyo during the Taishō era in 1922, one year before the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. Characters * - A 12-year-old girl who resides in her workshop inside the basement of the Ryōunkaku in Asakusa, Tokyo. A technical genius with no prior scientific knowledge, she is able to create electronic devices far beyond the capabilities of the current era. Some of the devices created include early versions of a modern computer, complete with typewriter keyboards and cathode ray tube display monitors. In the novel version, one of her ongoing works is a mysterious robot which she refers to as . Despite being 12 years old, she often displays a mature expression of an adult. She also displays an uncanny ability to generate electricity from her hands when she takes on a tank squadron later in the story. * - A man in his 30s who is an associate of Ain's. In the prologue chapter of the novel, he claims to be able to see the future through the displays on Ain's computer monitors. In the novel version, he sells these information, known as prophecies, to the Japanese military and the aristocracy to fund for Ain's inventions. In the serialized version, he has no name and is only referred to as \\"the man\\", and his face is unseen throughout the illustrations. In both versions, he is described as being emotionless, and only displays deep affection for Ain. * - A military officer who works for the Japanese army's science institute. He holds the rank of 2nd lieutenant. Enoki is sent to Asakusa to investigate the unstable electrical discharge occurring in the vicinity of the Ryōunkaku. * - A Japanese nobleman with the title of viscount. It is unknown what relationship Kimiyasu has with Ain, but he is interested in her unorthodox inventions. He has a primary residence in Sanbanchō of Chiyoda-ku, and a second residence at the Kanda-Surugadai district. * - A Russian woman of aristocratic origins, Barbara is a refugee who escaped from Harbin during the disownment of the presence of Russians by the Chinese Republic. She lives in the Kanda-Surugadai residence owned by Kimiyasu who has taken her in. Ain is particularly uncomfortable of Barbara's presence as she is frightened of her pale white complexion, presumably having never seen a Russian before.

Development Despera graphic novel under serialization in Animage magazine. During Sakura-Con 2009 held on April at Seattle, Washington, famed character designer Yoshitoshi ABe revealed that he will be developing a new anime titled Desperant (デスペラント). He also announced that he will be working with many of the staff who worked on Serial Experiments Lain. Details on the storyline were scarce as ABe stated that the anime has not been officially unveiled in Japan, but revealed that it will be set during Japan's Taishō era. In his official blog the very next day, ABe clarified that the title of the anime is called Despera and not the one he stated earlier, due to a speaking error during the convention announcement. In his official website, Chiaki J. Konaka has announced a graphic novel serialization in Japanese magazine Animage which will last for one year, with the story penned by him and artwork provided by ABe. Production was placed on hold due to Nakamura's health issues.

It is based on the idea that common experiences of a species become incorporated into its genetic code, not by a Lamarckian process that encodes specific memories but by a much vaguer tendency to encode a readiness to respond in certain ways to certain stimuli. Language Language, in the modern view, is considered to be only a partial product of genetic memory. The fact that humans can have languages is a property of the nervous system that is present at birth, and thus phylogenetic in character. However, perception of the particular set of phonemes specific to a native language only develops during ontogeny. There is no genetic predisposition towards the phonemic makeup of any single language. Children in a particular country are not genetically predisposed to speak the languages of that country, adding further weight to the assertion that genetic memory is not Lamarckian. However, there is scientific evidence of a gene for perfect pitch which is more common in Asian countries where pitch is critical to the meaning of a spoken word. Trauma, phobias, and neuropsychiatric disorders Neuroscientific research on mice suggests that some experiences can influence subsequent generations. In a 2013 study, mice trained to fear a specific smell passed on their trained aversion to their descendants, which were then extremely sensitive and fearful of the same smell, even though they had never encountered it, nor been trained to fear it. Changes in brain structure were also found. The researchers concluded that \\"[t]he experiences of a parent, even before conceiving, markedly influence both structure and function in the nervous system of subsequent generations\\". Scientists speculate that similar genetic mechanisms could be linked with phobias, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorders, as well as other neuropsychiatric disorders, in humans. Historical views In contrast to the modern view, in the 19th century, biologists considered genetic memory to be a fusion of memory and heredity, and held it to be a Lamarckian mechanism. Ribot in 1881, for example, held that psychological and genetic memory were based upon a common mechanism, and that the former only differed from the latter in that it interacted with consciousness. Hering and Semon developed general theories of memory, the latter inventing the idea of the engram and concomitant processes of engraphy and ecphory. Semon divided memory into genetic memory and central nervous memory. This 19th-century view is not wholly dead, albeit that it stands in stark contrast to the ideas of neo-Darwinism. In modern psychology, genetic memory is generally considered a false idea. However, biologists such as Stuart A. Newman and Gerd B. Müller have contributed to the idea in the 21st century. In fiction *In the 1975 Doctor Who episode The Ark in Space, an insectoid species known as the Wirrn possess a form of race memory as part of a hive mind. Also in the 1984 episode Frontios, Turlough demonstrates the race memory after a nervous breakdown. *In the Assassin's Creed universe, genetic memory is decoded by a virtual machine called the Animus. The Animus decodes and renders memories in a three- dimensional field, allowing the reliving of previous events and the discovery of hidden information.The Science Fact Animating Assassin's Creed's Animus. Kotaku.com. 11 April 2012. Retrieved 8 November 2015. *In Jean M. Auel's The Clan of the Cave Bear, the Neanderthals are able to tap into their shared genetic memory via hallucinogenic herbal concoctions created by their medicine men and women, and sometimes even without using the drug. It is explained in the novel that while this allows them access to a vast array of survival skills learned over thousands of years of slow evolution, they lack the ingenuity and innovation to advance beyond what they already know, and are thus doomed to die out as a species. The Cro-Magnon, who in the novel do not have access to their genetic memories, instead possess a more developed frontal lobe and are thus able to reason and deduct at a level far beyond the Neanderthal. *In 7aum Arivu movie, Bodhidharma (of the 5th or 6th century, who knows hypnotism, martial arts, and cures to a plethora of diseases) is brought back to life in the modern day through a descendant of his by a genetic researcher by genetic memory concept to save his country. *In the 2001 Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda episode The Devil Take the Hindmost, there are colonists called the Hajira who genetically possess all their parents' memories up to the time they are born. *In the TV show Stargate SG-1, an alien race known as the Goa'uld possess and transfer their knowledge via genetic memory, so any newborn goa'uld will possess all the memories and knowledge of their ancestors. *In Alien Resurrection movie, the cloned Ellen Ripley has memories of the past suggested to be a result of genetic crossing with the aliens.

Immigration Reierson had been sponsored in 1843 by a group of prospective emigrants and financiers to tour the United States and report settlement possibilities. He made his way to the Republic of Texas. Reierson traveled to Austin, where President Sam Houston encouraged him to bring Norwegian settlers to the republic and promised aid in the establishment of a colony. Johan Reinert Reierson, Pioneer(Promise of America. The Norwegian Emigrant Museum, Hamar, Norway) In 1844, Reierson wrote and published a comprehensive book about America titled Pathfinder for Norwegian Emigrants to the United North American States and Texas (Norwegian: Veiviser for norske emigranter til De forenede nordamerikanske stater og Texas) a comprehensive book about America published in Norway. Reierson particularly advocated Texas as the most promising regions for settlement.R. Reierson's Indiscretions (Einar Haugen. Norwegian-American Historical Association. Volume 21: Page 269) Reierson decided to immigrate to Texas and establish a Norwegian colony in the republic. With a small group of Norwegians, including his own family, he returned in the spring of 1845. Before departing for America, he established a monthly magazine, Norway and America (Norwegian: Norge og Amerika) to report on the progress of the Norwegians in America to the people of Norway. When Reierson immigrated to Texas, Elise Wærenskjold assumed the editorship of the popular magazine until she herself immigrated to Texas in 1847. Norwegian Texans(University of Texas Institute of Texan Cultures. San Antonio: Encino, 1970) After the annexation of Texas in 1845, Reierson led his group of settlers into the state and established the first real Norwegian immigrant colony in Texas in Henderson County. The colony, originally named Normandy, merged with nearby Brownsboro. In 1850, Reierson established a second colony. Families from Brownsboro moved to these communities, which they named Four Mile Prairie in Van Zandt County and Prairieville in Kaufman County. In 1848 the Texas legislature had formed Van Zandt and Kaufman counties out of Henderson County.

The Foundation supports the training and development of South Africa’s young musicians through national courses, national and international tours and workshops, and networks nationally and internationally. It also assists regional youth orchestra and music education programmes countrywide. It organises youth orchestra courses, where the South African National Youth Orchestras are formed. This has included the South African National Youth Orchestra, South African National Concert Orchestra, the South African National Wind Orchestra, the South African National Youth Baroque Orchestra, South African National Youth Brass and the South African National Youth String Orchestra. Members of these orchestras are under the age of 25. The Foundation Sasol was the main sponsor from 1979–2014 when the Foundation was formed to look after the South African National Youth Orchestra (formed in 1964). The Foundation has also been supported by De Beers, Rupert Musiekstigting, Adcock-Ingram, Southern African Music Rights Organisation (SAMRO), Blackie and Associates, Primedia (1998 tour), AECI, and Business & Arts South Africa over a number of years. SANYOF has a management team and is assisted by a large network of volunteers. The Foundation is a cooperating member of the European Federation of National Youth Orchestras (EFNYO). Courses The orchestra courses are held every year during the school holidays, in a different city in South Africa. Courses have been presented in Bloemfontein, Durban, Cape Town, Johannesburg, Port Elizabeth, Pretoria, Potchefstroom, Hartbeespoort and Stellenbosch. Repertoire includes a wide variety of works by baroque, romantic, 20th century and contemporary composers, with an emphasis on performing works by South African composers. This course has also been known as an opportunity to participate in chamber music, socialise and establish friendships. History The course first started as a holiday music camp at Hartbeespoort Dam in 1964, with 87 participants, organised by the South African Society of Music Teachers (SASMT). The early pioneers included Korie Koornhof, Arthur Wegelin, Paul Loeb van Zuilenburg, Diane Heller and Betty Pack together with the first conductor, Leo Quayle. The seeds those early pioneers sowed quickly took root and in 1975 the SA National Youth Orchestra took part in the International Festival of Youth Orchestras in Aberdeen, followed by a short tour of Europe three years later. In 1979, Sasol came on board as a founding partner of the National Youth Orchestra Foundation to provide infrastructure and organisational skills. Sasol remains a committed partner to this day, providing sponsorship for the annual youth orchestra course and its development initiatives. The South African National Youth Orchestra Foundation holds courses around the country with tutelage by top local and international teachers and conductors. Under the management of Dorothy van de Geest and with the help of her husband, Professor Gerard van de Geest, the South African National Youth Orchestra reached unprecedented levels, performing in Scotland, in Europe and in Red Square in Moscow. In 2006, the South African National Youth Orchestra took part in the Beethoven festival in Bonn performing a programme of South African works in addition to Beethoven's symphony no. 5.

It was founded in 1864 by the American pioneer Eliza Jane Gillett Bridgman as Bridgman Girls' College, later Peking Bridgman Girls' High School as a Christian academy offering female education, making it the oldest girls' school and the earliest western style academy in Beijing, and was credited with educating a large number of female Chinese leaders before the foundation of \\"Red China\\". Although the Bridgman Girls' High School became the public, co-education Beijing No.166 High School after the Communist government took over, nowadays, it still holds a special relationship with Mount Holyoke College, a member of American Seven Sisters, due to its historical traditions, and periodically dispatches students to visit the Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory. The school is proud that all of its liberal arts and most of its science students could pass the enrolment line of key universities (Tier 1 schools) in National Higher Education Entrance Examination, which is considered as a proof of elite school in China.  History  =Qing Dynasty Period= The famous American pioneer educational missionary in China, Eliza Jane Gillett Bridgman (1805–1871) opened up Bridgman Girls' College after obtaining substantial land in 1864, following the British and French victory of the Second Opium War. The college had changed her name to Peking Bridgman Girls' High School since 1895. During the Boxer Rebellion, one third of students were killed, and others were protected by British embassy until the Eight-Nation Alliance controlled Peking. Later, the school was developed into a series of Christian academies: the Bridgman Boys' High School (now Beijing No.25 High School), the Bridgman Elementary School (now Dengshikou Primary school), and in 1905, the Women's College of Yenching University was established based on the school, which was spited up by the Communist government, and merged into Tsinghua University, Renmin University of China, Peking University whilst the campus is still occupied by Peking University today. =Republic of China Period= After the Republic of China founded, the school purchased the Tung-Fu campus, which had been Grand Secretary of the Jiajing Emperor Yan Song's palace in Ming Dynasty, as well as belonged to the Kangxi Emperor's mother, Empress Xiaokangzhang's family in Qing Dynasty. During the era of ROC, the influence and history of Bridgman Girls' High School led to it being one of the most prestigious schools in Beijing, huge amount of female from Chinese upper class had attended the school. =People's republic of China Period= The school remained as an independent school until 1951, when the Communist Government took over all western background academy after China intervened in the Korean War. At the beginning, it was renamed as Beijing No.12 Girls' High School, and was one of ten \\"Municipal Model High Schools\\" accredited by the Beijing Municipal Government. While the Cultural Revolution made serious impact to the school due to its history of Christian academy that educating females from upper class, who were the main social group would be purged in the revolution. For example, the female drama director Sun Weishi aroused enmity and was killed by Mao's wife, and a leader of the revolution Jiang Qing, was graduated from Bridgman Girls' High School.

It is renowned for its unique mythology and belief. It is believed that one who worships and offering rituals to Devi (Kadakkalamma) will be protected from evil and their life will be filled with prosperity and wealth. Kadakkal Temple has four main temples situated equal distances in three directions from the Temple Pond (Kadakkal Chira): Devi Temple, Siva Temple, Taliyil Temple and Kilimarathukavu Temple. The uniqueness of the main Devi temple is that there is neither an idol nor a pujari. During the temple festival thousands of devotees come to Kadakkal to worship 'Devi'. On the first day of the festival, thousands of women offer Pongal (dish) to the Devi at the temple ground. The festival starts with 'Kuthirayeduppu', which is a grand procession followed by Kuthiyottam and pageants. The festival ends with 'Guruzi', a spiritual ritual. കടക്കൽ ദേവി ക്ഷേത്രം Mythology Kadakkal temple has an unusual mythology related to its existence, that Kadakkal Devi came from Tamil Nadu with her four sisters: Kadakkal Devi situated in Peedika (a small kind of trade shop made of wood), near Kadakkal and Anchal Devi situated, in Kadayattu Kalari near Anchal, Karavalur Devi in the village of Karavalur, and Kariyara Devi at Kariyara. The four temples are called the same name: Peedikayil Bhagavathy Temples. Another story concerns Panayappan, a Tamil trader who was killed by Kadakkal Devi in revenge for exploiting her family. After that she moved to Kadakkal Peedika, which became the sanctum sanctorum of the present Kadakkal Devi Temple. The Nettur Kurup, who was the eyewitness of this incident, got permission from the devi to perform pooja to the devi in the Peedika. Every year devotees celebrate the devi's holy birthdate \\"Thiruvathira\\" of Kumbha, in the Malayalam Calendar) as their regional festival. Festivals of Kadakkal Temple The most important day of Kadakkal Devi Temple is Thiruvathira Nakshathram (star) in the Malayalam month Kumbha, celebrating the holy birthday of the mother goddess \\"Kadakkal Amma\\".

Background  She was born in Léogâne to a poor but free family as the daughter of Guillaume Bonheur and Marie-Sainte Lobelot. She was educated by her aunt Élise Lobelot, who was the governess of a religious order. She married Pierre Lunic, master-cartwright to the Brothers of Saint- Jean de Dieu. She became a widow in 1795.  The siege of Jacmel  During the siege of Jacmel in 1800, she made herself a name for her work for the wounded and starving. She managed to convince Dessalines, who was one of the parties besieging the city, to allow some roads to the city to be opened, so that the wounded in the city could receive help. She led a procession of women and children with food, clothes and medicine back to the city, and then arranged for the food to be cooked on the streets.  Life with Dessalines  On 2 April 1800, she married Jean-Jacques Dessalines, with whom she had a long-time relationship. They had seven children: *Princess Marie Françoise Célimène Dessalines (Saint-Marc, 2 October 1789 - 1859). Legitimated by the subsequent marriage of her parents. She never married, but had a daughter with Captain Bernard Chancy. *Albert Dessalines (died young before 1804). Legitimated by the subsequent marriage of her parents. *Prince Jacques Bien Aimé Dessalines (Saint-Marc, 2 April 1793 - aft. 1832). Legitimated by the subsequent marriage of his parents. He never married, but had one daughter by Adélaïde Appolon. *Princess Célestine Dessalines (Saint-Marc, 2 April 1793 - 10 August 1867), twin with her brother Jacques. Legitimated by the subsequent marriage of her parents. Married at Cap-Henry, 10 April 1817, to Pierre Daux. No issue. *Princess Jeanne Sophie Dessalines (20 January 1799 - 10 August 1867). Legitimated by the subsequent marriage of her parents. Married to N. Cazenave. No issue. *Louis Dessalines (died young before 1804). Legitimated by the subsequent marriage of her parents. *Princess Serine Dessalines. Marie-Claire was described as kind, merciful and natural, with an elegant and cordial manner. She adopted the numerous children produced by Dessalines' adulterous affairs. She was a contrast to her husband in her tolerance and support and by showing indiscriminate kindness to people of all colors. She was a great opponent of Dessalines' policy toward the white French people of Haiti; she saw to the needs of the prisoners, and she did not hesitate, despite her husband's anger, to save many of them from battle wounds suffered during the revolution war. She is reported to have fallen to her knees before him to beg him to spare their lives and is said to have hidden one of them, Descourtilz, under her own bed to save him. She was made Empress of Haiti in 1804 upon the creation of the monarchy of Haiti, and crowned with her husband at the Church of Champ de Mars on 8 October 1804. She kept the status for two years.  Later life  After the deposition and death of her Dessalines in 1806, she denied the offer from Henry Christophe to move in with his family. As a widow, she was styled Princess Dowager on 17 October 1806. As the property of her late husband was confiscated, she lived in poverty in Saint-Marc until August 1843, when she was granted a pension 1,200 gourdes. In 1849, when Faustin I of Haiti became Emperor, he idealized the late Dessalines and enlarged Marie- Claire's pension as a sign of his admiration. Marie-Claire, who felt no sympathy for this attitude, refused the money. She moved in with her granddaughter, and lived in poverty until her death in 1858 in Gonaïves. Legacy In her honour, the Fondation Marie-Claire Heureuse Félicité Bonheur Dessalines, also known as the Fondasyon Félicité (FF), was established by Dr Bayyinah Bello in 1999 to undertake humanitarian, social and educational work in Haiti. Soon after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the non-profit organization Friends of Fondation Félicité was set up to support FF in helping the Haitian people to rebuild their country.\\"Birmingham charity continues to help Haiti one year on\\", BBC Birmingham, 12 January 2011.

Life  He was the son of John Bolton, of Fenton, Staffordshire, and was born about 1570. He practised for a time as a barrister in England. He was a defendant in a lawsuit about land in Fenton Calvert, Stafford, three miles from Newcastle-under-Lyme, in Queen Elizabeth I's time. He moved to Ireland with the object, it was alleged, of avoiding the results of an unfavourable judgment passed on him by the court of Star-Chamber in this lawsuit. At the end of 1604, he obtained office as temporary Recorder of Dublin, and was confirmed in the post in 1605. Through government influence he was elected in 1613, in opposition to the Roman Catholic candidate, one of the representatives of Dublin in the Irish House of Commons of which the Crown candidate Sir John Davies became the Speaker, although it was claimed that a majority of the House had actually voted for the Catholic candidate Sir John Everard. Bolton resigned from the Recordership of Dublin in the same year. Bolton received a knighthood in 1618 from Sir Oliver St John, Lord Deputy of Ireland. At the end of 1618 Bolton was appointed Solicitor-General for Ireland. Bolton became Attorney-General to the Court of Wards at Dublin in 1622 and was appointed Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer in 1625. In December 1639 Bolton was appointed Lord Chancellor of Ireland. As Chancellor, Bolton presided in the Irish Parliament which commenced at Dublin in March 1640. Bolton was regarded as a chief adviser of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, the Lord Lieutenant, in his attempts to introduce arbitrary government. The Privy Council of Ireland was dominated by four of Strafford's allies: Sir George Radcliffe, James Butler, Earl of Ormonde, Robert Dillon who was a connection by marriage, and Bolton.Wedgwood, p. 260. On 11 February 1641, the House of Lords acquitted him on a charge of having endeavoured to prevent the continuance of the existing parliament. In a letter dated 11 February 1641 Bolton transmitted to the committee of the house attending the king in England a schedule of grievances of Ireland voted by the Irish House of Lords at Dublin on the same day. Strafford's fall from power began late in 1640. On 27 February 1641 a committee was appointed by the House of Commons in Ireland to draw up charges against Bolton, Radcliffe, John Bramhall, bishop of Derry, and Sir Gerard Lowther, Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, to impeach them of high treason. The Chancellor, as chairman of the house, had to receive the articles against himself. The house after some further debate declared that the Lord Chancellor was not fit to execute that place. Sir William Ryves, second justice of the Court of King's Bench, was appointed by letters patent Speaker of the Irish House of Lords, during the King's pleasure, in the absence of the Chancellor, and took up office on 11 May 1641. The complexion of matters was changed by the Irish Rebellion of 1641, and eventually the impeachment proceedings were dropped; they had at least in part been tactical, to prevent Strafford's allies being called as witnesses in his defence at his impeachment.Wedgwood, p. 332. Bolton, a member of the Privy Council at Dublin, signed the despatch of 25 October 1641, announcing to Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester, Strafford's successor as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland but then in England, the hostile movements in Ireland. By a resolution of 21 June 1642, that no members should sit or vote until they had taken the oath of supremacy, the House of Commons excluded the Roman Catholic representatives, among whom were those who had been most active in the proceedings against Bolton and his associates. On the same day, Bolton and Lowther petitioned the House, and it was unanimously resolved to proceed no further upon the articles of accusation against them. On the following day, Bolton was restored by the lords to his place as Chancellor, and on 2 August 1642 resumed his position in their House. Bolton was actively engaged in negotiations connected with the cessation of hostilities between England and the Irish in 1643. In 1644 Bolton was a principal counsellor of the Lord- Lieutenant, Ormonde, in negotiating with the Irish confederation concerning peace. His name appears first amongst those of the privy council who signed the proclamation issued at Dublin on 30 July 1646 announcing the conclusion of a treaty of peace between Charles I of England and his Roman Catholic subjects in Ireland. He joined in the statement on the condition of Ireland of 19 February 1647 submitted by Ormonde to Charles I. Sir Richard Bolton died in November 1648. Strafford's biographer calls Bolton an honest and able, if rather colourless man, and a dependable servant of the Crown.Wedgwood, p. 245. Works In 1621 Bolton published at Dublin, in a folio volume, a selection of statutes passed in parliaments held in Ireland.The Statutes of Ireland, beginning the third year of King Edward the Second, and continuing until the end of the Parliament begun in the eleventh year of the reign of our most gracious Soveraigne Lord King James and ended in the thirteenth year of his reign of England, France, and Ireland. Newly perused and examined with the Parliament rolls; and divers statutes imprinted in this book which were not formerly printed in the old booke. Bolton dedicated this work to his benefactor Sir Oliver St. John, Lord Deputy of Ireland. An addition containing statutes of the tenth and eleventh year of Charles I was published in 1635. Bolton published in 1638, at Dublin, A Justice of Peace for Ireland, with a second edition appearing in 1683. A Justice of Peace for Ireland, consisting of two books. The first declaring th' exercise of that office by one or more Justices of Peace out of Session. The second setting forth the forme of proceeding in sessions and the matters to be enquired of and handled therein. Composed by Sir Richard Bolton, Knight, Chief Baron of His Majesties Court of Exchequer in Ireland. Whereunto are added many presidents of indictments of treasons, felonies, misprisons, praemunires and finable offences of force, fraud, omission and other misdemeanors of severall sorts more than ever heretofore have been published in print. In the first edition, Bolton praised the peaceful and settled condition of Ireland; a condition which was to change all too quickly.Wedgwood p. 245. Bolton was erroneously supposed to have been the author of a brief treatise entitled A Declaration setting forth how and by what means the laws and statutes of England from time to time came to be of force in Ireland. Family By his first wife, Frances, daughter of Richard Walter of Stafford, he left one son, Edward, and several daughters. His second wife was Margaret, daughter of Sir Patrick Barnewall of Turvey and Mary Bagenal. Bolton's son Edward succeeded him as solicitor-general in Ireland in 1622, and as chief baron in 1640. On the death of Charles I, Edward Bolton was reappointed Chief Baron by Charles II. From that office, he was removed by the parliamentarian government, which, however, employed him in 1651 as commissioner for the administration of justice in Ireland. Notes References * C. V.

In the United States, plastics used in the construction of plenum cable are regulated under the National Fire Protection Association standard NFPA 90A: Standard for the Installation of Air Conditioning and Ventilating Systems. All materials intended for use on wire and cables to be placed in plenum spaces are designed to meet rigorous fire safety test standards in accordance with NFPA 262 and outlined in NFPA 90A. Plenum cable is jacketed with a fire-retardant plastic jacket of either a low-smoke polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or a fluorinated ethylene polymer (FEP). Polyolefin formulations, specifically based on polyethylene compounding had been developed by at least two companies in the early to mid-1990s; however, these were never commercialized, and development efforts continue in these yet- untapped product potentials. Development efforts on a non-halogen plenum compound were announced in 2007 citing new flame-retardant synergist packages that may provide an answer for a yet-underdeveloped plenum cable market outside the United States. In 2006, significant concern developed over the potential toxicity of FEP and related fluorochemicals including the process aid perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) or C8 such that California has proposed some of these materials as potential human carcinogens. The NFPA Technical Committee on Air Conditioning, in response to public comment, has referred the issue of toxicity of cabling materials to the NFPA Committee on Toxicity for review before 2008. In 2007, a development program specifically targeting the production of a non-halogen plenum cable compound was announced to specifically address lingering toxicity concerns presented by halogenated compounds for use in European and other global markets.  Riser cable  Cable that is run between floors in non-plenum areas is rated as riser cable. The fire requirements on riser cable are not as strict. Thus, plenum cable can always replace riser cable, but riser cable cannot replace plenum cable in plenum spaces. Both plenum and riser cables commonly include a rope or polymer filament with high tensile strength, which helps support the weight of the cable when it is dangling in an open chute. Cables like twisted-pair, coaxial, HDMI, and DVI are available in both plenum and riser versions. The cable cost is often significantly higher than general-use cable due to the special restricted-use flame retardant materials. Cable stiffness Plenum-rated and riser-rated cables are restricted to only allow certain chemicals for manufacture of the wire insulation and cable sheath. Typically this results in reduced flexibility of plastic cables, making it stiff and hard to bend. The bend radius may also be increased, and tight bends can potentially crack or tear the insulation and sheathing. References External links *Videos showing flammability of cables (including Plenum rated) based on jacket rating The videos here, while presenting a comparative viewpoint, do not show the fire tests used to determine the relative acceptability of cables for use in plenum spaces. The fire tests shown in the referenced link are small scale (bench) demonstrations of relative burning characteristics under one condition that is not sanctioned by or used by any safety code or regulation in determining suitability for use in plenum or other applications. * NFPA 90A: Standard for the Installation of Air-Conditioning and Ventilating Systems Category:Signal cables ","title":"Plenum cable"},{"id":"23107809","text":"Cazones de Herrera, or Cazones, is a town and municipality located in the north of the Mexican state of Veracruz on the Gulf of Mexico. While it has tourist attractions along its shore, especially in the Barra de Cazones area, the municipality, including the seat, has a high level of socioeconomic marginalization. Most of the municipality's population works in agriculture. The town The town of Cazones de Herrera is 321 km from the state capital of Xalapa. It is a small town typical for the area, with a main church, main plaza, kiosk and municipal palace or government office. It is located next to the Cazones River and there is boat service from the municipal seat to communities on the other side of the river, including boats that carry vehicles. While it is the largest community in the municipality with a population of 4,260 as of 2010, it has a high level of socioeconomic marginalization. History Stack) The town name comes from the Spanish word for the sharpnose shark, which used to be plentiful here. The appendage “de Herrera” is in honor of soldier and politician José Joaquín de Herrera. Its municipal seal contains elements related to the area’s production of citrus fruit and corn as well as a sharpnose sharks. Other elements refer to the lands and Farallón Island at the mouth of the Cazones River. In the pre- Hispanic period, the area was part of Totonacapan, although it came under the domination of the Aztecs in the 15th century. After the Conquest, the Totonacs came to dominate the local culture again. After Independence, the area became part of the Papantla municipality. The current municipality was created in 1936 with land that formerly belonged to the municipalities of Papantla and Tuxpan, with the settlement of Cazones designated as a town. The current official name was adopted in 1956. The municipality Boats on the main docks in Barra de Cazones The town of Cazones de Herrera is the local government for 70 other communities which cover an area of 106.11 km2. It borders the municipalities of Tuxpan, Papantla, Poza Rica and Tihuatlán with the Gulf of Mexico to the east. Aside from the municipal seat, other significant communities are La Unión with 1,850 people, Manilio Fabio Altamirano with 1,214 people, Barra de Cazones with 1,167 people, and Rancho Nuevo with 1,065 people. The municipal government consists of a municipal president, an officer called a “síndico”, and four representatives, called “regidors.” The municipality has an average altitude of ten meters above sea level. Its main river is the Cazones, which splits the municipality into two parts and is the traditional dividing line between Totonacapan and La Huasteca. The mouth of the river is here, forming the Barra (shoal) de Cazones. The municipality’s shoreline faces the Gulf of Mexico and includes a number of beaches, including Playa Chaparrales, where marine turtles come to lay their eggs in March and April. The climate is hot and humid with an average annual temperature of 25C and an average rainfall of 2,000mm. The main ecosystem is high growth perennial rainforest. Remaining forests still have tropical hardwoods. The shoreline has a number of estuaries with mangroves. Wildlife includes rabbits, raccoons, opossums, armadillos, and coyotes. The shoreline has various estuaries with mangroves. The mangroves on the river are home to various species of crab, some of which are in danger of extinction. Fields in the municipality The area today is considered to be in the far southeast of the La Huasteca cultural region, with traditional dances belonging to this region, with danzón as the most traditional music. The municipality organizes regular events to promote and preserve the traditional dances of the Veracruz Huasteca. The establishment of the municipality is celebrated from June 16-23 each year. Carnival is another important annual festival. The local cuisine is rich in local seafood such as shrimp, sea bass, crab, and octopus, often served with mole, adobo, and chili pepper. One notable non-seafood dish is pork served in a chili pepper and garlic sauce. Just over 15% of the population speaks an indigenous language with the rest speaking Spanish. The municipality is considered to have a high level of socioeconomic marginalization. About 34% have problems obtaining sufficient food; 45% have problems obtaining sufficient education or job training and about 70% lack their own land. Of the municipality’s 71 communities, fifty are considered to be highly or very highly marginalized. As of the 2010 census, there were 5,991 residences. About 58% have running water, and less than 47% have drainage. Over 96% have electricity and access to a landfill. Seventy percent of homes have cement floors with 24% having dirt floors. About 15% have autos, 86% have televisions, 70% have refrigerators, 69% have radios, 34% have cell phones, just over five percent have computers, and less than two percent have Internet. About 54% of the working population of the municipality is involved in agriculture, fishing, and forestry. Principle crops include corn, oranges, bananas, green chili peppers, and grapefruit. Most livestock is cattle, followed by pigs, sheep, goats, and domestic fowl. About 12 percent is involved in mining, construction, and utilities. About 32% is involved in commerce and services, including tourism. View of Playa Chaparrales Wild turkeys in Cazones Tourist attractions in the municipality are related to its shoreline and includes beaches such as Playa Azul, Playa Boquitas, Playa Sur, and Playa Chaparrales, as well as the Cazones River. The best known area is Barra de Cazones, where almost all of the municipality’s hotels are. The community centers on the main boardwalk and docks which were built by the state in 2006. The Cazones lighthouse was built in the 1970s to guide small vessels such as fishing boats. Farallón is a small island located at the mouth of the Cazones River about half a kilometer from the ocean. In the colonial period, it was a refuge for pirates. One side of the island has a cliff called “El Chivo” eighteen meters high, which is popular for rappelling. The island is home to a species of black iguana called “garrobo negro.” Playa Sur is the best known beach because of its hotels and other tourist infrastructure. Playa Norte is a virgin beach with no permanent structures located on the opposite side of the mouth of the Cazones River from the main docks. The area is a haven for flocks of sea gulls and parts are filled with sea shells and pieces of coral. One of the features of this beach is “El Pulpo” (The Octopus), a rock formation with six branches formed by erosion from sea waves. Another is the Cueva del Tigre (Tiger Cave) a small cave which is hidden during high tide. View of the Cazones River Playa Chaparrales is a semi-virgin beach with permanent structures generally out of view of the shoreline. This beach has heaps of shells pushed onshore in capricious formations. It is a protected nesting site for three of Mexico’s protected marine species. Visitors are welcome to the beach during nesting periods which are guarded by government officials. Playa Azul is a semi virgin beach which contains an estuary called El Tejón. Playa Boquillas is named after the Boquillas River estuary. Arrecife Blake (Blake Reef) is also called the “Bajo Negro” (Black Low) because it is home to species of black coral. It also has expanses of mangroves. La Encantada is a cave which is home to a small species of bat. There are 71.1 km of highway in the municipality, almost all of which is maintained by the state. The municipality has thirty two preschools, one special education facility, forty two primary schools, sixteen middle schools, and nine high schools. There are no facilities of higher education. There are seventeen public libraries. There is a rate of just over fifteen percent illiteracy as of 2010. Just over 19% have not finished primary school. The National Triathlon of Cazones is a major annual sporting event in the north of Veracruz, sponsored by the municipality and the federal government. Money raised from the event is used to help preserve marine turtle habitats.

It is a 121-bed hospital which became SIM's first training hospital.  Background  There was missionary activity in Egbe so many years ago particularly through Rev. Tommy Titcombe and his wife (a British-born Canadian Missionary), on behalf of the Serving In Mission (SIM) from the United States, Canada, and the UK, who served in Egbe and Yagba land from 1908 for more than a decade, this has left a positive impact on the people of Egbe, Yagba and Nigeria at large. He came to Egbe at a time when West Africa was considered a white man's grave due to the existence of malaria. 'Oyinbo' Egbe as Rev Titcombe was fondly called was used by God to start a large and healthy church in Yagba land that continues until this day. He was also renowned for caring for the sick, especially those with ulcerous wounds. ECWA Hospital Egbe became one of the products of the work.  History  Tommy Titcombe, while preaching from place to place usually saw people with sores; this encouraged him to embark on health care services, while he was quick to notice this as another avenue to winning souls. Formation of ECWA Hospital Egbe gradually began. Tommy Titcombe married Ethel McIntosh in 1915; this union brought about a turning point in the history of the hospital. Tommy and wife arrived Egbe two days before Christmas 1915 from their honey moon, they didn’t realise how exciting Christmas Day was going to be. As they were getting ready to go to the five O’clock service on Christmas morning, a messenger came running from the town beckoning Ethel to come quickly. There was a woman who had just giving birth to twins. She had had four babies and all had died. At that time Yagbas (this is what people from Egbe and surrounding communities are called) believed that a woman who gave birth to twins was something less than human and they wouldn’t let them live in the village any longer. Believing one of the twins must be an evil spirit, so, they were waiting for the medicine man to come and kill both of them. Consequently, Ethel (Tommy’s wife) was able to save the twins and the woman from being put to death, though there was resistance from the people, but for God’s intervention. The first twins (Reuben and Ruth) were saved on that day without any evil befalling them as the people believed and the practice was gradually abolished from among the Yagba people. Perhaps, because Ethel wanted to save more twins, she decided to start a small maternity in their house. This was the genesis of ECWA Hospital Egbe. In 1925 they started building a Maternity and Clinic, with Christian converts’ support and hard labour, the building was completed in 1926. Since the birth of the Hospital, Rev and Mrs. Titcombe had worked hard to sustain it till 1951. It must be tough for them since both of them do not have a formal medical training; they developed the nursing skill with time. By 1950, Egbe people had started to develop and manifest a very positive response to the medical services. No doubt there was increased patronage from both within and outside Egbe, consequently Rev and Mrs. Titcombe could no longer cope with the increasing number of patients even with the helping hand of Olutoju who was a trained Nurse, hence there was an immediate need for trained personnel. Meanwhile, Rev Tommy Titcombe had consulted with Dr. George Campion in 1949; Dr. Campion was in his final year of medical training at Canada. He agreed to come to Egbe after his course. Tommy and Ethel’s decision to return home was a ‘sad news’ for Egbe people, but since Tommy was getting old, and must have felt a growing sense of peace within himself saying “now I have more time to pray for Egbe Hospital and SIM Missionaries”. Tommy officially retired home in his 77th years in 1958. The arrival of Dr. Campion and his wife who decided to go back into nursing after her degree course (B. A. Honours in English Language) marked the peak of the final transition of the hospital to one of the biggest, most popular and most successful hospital in the present Kogi State and Nigeria at large. Because of the medical inconvenience posed on him by lack of necessary buildings, he immediately initiated the construction of certain buildings which include: the main building housing; Autoclave room, operation theatre, Doctor’s offices, Outpatients Department (OPD), Patients’ waiting room, card room, Ward A and the Laboratory. These buildings were completed and dedicated on 17 July 1953. By January 1954, the 25-bed added Ward A (called Dr. Schoffstall ward) could no more accommodate the ever- increasing number of patients. The rate of growth and fame of the hospital became unprecedented, so by 1962, the available ward A (Schoffstall ward) and ward B (Hope Sneath ward) became inadequate, thus a third ward C (Gay Hawtin Ward) was started and completed with 19 beds. The hospital could boast of 69 bedded wards. In 1965, Campion added some pressing building needed which include: Central Supply Room, Administration, Pharmacy, cashiers and Accounts with second floor operating suite completed. Further more, because of the 520 births received in 1970 alone, the new maternity was equipped with 35 beds. Because of the need to reflect the image of the hospital as a mission aimed and for evangelism purpose, Dr. Campion initiated the building of three Pastor’s Offices in 1971, the building was dedicated to the memory of Dr. Janet Troupe who died in Nigeria while treating Lassa fever patients. In fact, the programme was designed that all the patients had to pass through one pastor or the other. Dr. and Mrs George Campion returned home in 1986.  ECWA School of Nursing and ECWA School of Midwifery  Dr. Campion soon realised the fact that very soon more hands will be needed in order to carry on with the work; he took the first paramedical initiatives to establish a Nursing Training School (NTS)(now ECWA School of Nursing, Egbe) which will produce nurses that will be engaged in the medical service of the hospital. Although, the school was established in 1955, the government’s approval was not secured until 1957. ECWA Nursing Training School was the first of its kind in the whole Kogi and Kwara for many years. ECWA School of Midwifery, Egbe was first established in 1977 as Midwives Training School and since has been graduating midwives who practice in Nigeria and abroad.

His elder sister is the artist Susannah Fiennes and his maternal grandfather was soldier and courtier Guy Salisbury-Jones. One of William's brothers died in a road accident at the age of three before he was born, and another brother, Richard, developed epilepsy which caused aggression and mood swings (and eventually his death at the age of 41). Fiennes was educated at the Dragon School in Oxford, Eton College, and Oxford University, where he received both undergraduate and graduate degrees. Writing Fiennes' first book, The Snow Geese (2002), is his account of how he followed snow geese from Texas to their summer breeding grounds on Baffin Island, and a meditation on the idea of home. Mark Cocker reviewed it for The Guardian, writing: \\"The Snow Geese is the debut of a striking talent\\". It was shortlisted for the 2002 Samuel Johnson Prize and won the 2003 Hawthornden Prize, the 2003 Somerset Maugham Award and the 2003 Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year Award. His second book, The Music Room (2009), is his memoir of growing up in an English castle with an elder brother, Richard, who suffered from severe epilepsy which caused mood swings and intermittent aggression, but who could also be very loving and creative. The Music Room was called \\"a small masterpiece, a tribute to the power of place, family and memory\\" by Nicholas Shakespeare, who reviewed it for the Telegraph. It was shortlisted for the Costa Book Awards, the Duff Cooper Prize, the Ondaatje Prize, the PEN/Ackerley Prize and the Independent Booksellers' Book of the Year Award.

In 2011, Fiennes contributed a short fable, \\"Why the Ash has Black Buds\\", to an anthology titled Why Willows Weep. Sales from the book raised funds for The Woodland Trust and its mission to plant native trees throughout Great Britain. In 2018, he contributed a chapter to the book Beneath the Skin: Great Writers on the Body (Profile Books). The chapter is about two years in his early 20s when the chronic illness Crohn's disease forced him to live with part of his intestines protruding outside of his abdominal cavity through a surgical incision. First diagnosed at the age of nineteen, he has undergone several surgeries and hospitalisations over the years and in 2009, he called his struggle with Crohn's \\"exhausting and demoralising\\".An Englishman's castle, The Guardian, 11 April 2009.

He is a third cousin of the actors Ralph Fiennes and Joseph Fiennes. He plays cricket as a member of the Authors XI team of British writers and contributed a chapter, \\"Cricket and Memory\\" (which concludes with him breaking his collarbone while diving to make a catch), to the team's 2013 book about their first year together, The Authors XI: A Season of English Cricket from Hackney to Hambledon. Team captain Charlie Campbell describes Fiennes in the book as \\"the best fielder in the side and the most stylish batsman\\", while teammate Jon Hotten calls him \\"undoubtedly the nicest man in cricket\\".

Moses, Mariana Klaveno, Tristan Lake Leabu, Madison Davenport, and Stacy Haiduk. Released on the Lifetime Movie Network, its plot concerns a couple who hires a live-in nanny who inserts herself increasingly into the family routine. Then friends of the family begin to have mysterious accidents, as the nanny conspires to replace the mother through murder. The film received generally negative reviews, with many critics saying the film was derivative of other 90’s femme fatale psychological thrillers, with many especially comparing it to the similar film The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (1992). Despite this, Mariana Klaveno’s performance as psychopath Abby received praise. Plot A couple, Carter and Meghan, decide that they should hire a live-in sitter so that they can both work and support their two children, Max and Casey. Abby Reed answers their advertisement and they move her in immediately. After some initial rough spots with the kids, the family warms to Abby. Abby seems obsessed with Carter, and when she helps organize a company party for a big success — that is rained out — she's in tears and distraught over the failed party. Carter's friend Tate tries to take advantage of Abby in her upset state, and then Tate is discovered dead in a car accident. Neighbor Mel is then suspicious of Abby, and is soon found dead as well, electrocuted in her bath. Then, Meghan's friend Shawna, now suspecting Abby as well, threatens disclosure as the final moments of Abby's plan to replace Meghan unfold. As backstory, we find that Abby had been rescued from her abusive mother by family lawyer Carter many years before, where Abby's obsession originates with the family and desire to replace Meghan as his wife.

The site is a scheduled ancient monument.Manor of the More, Moor Park Three Rivers Museum, Accessed 7 February 2014 In the grounds of the school exist parts of at least two large stone pillars approximately one meter in length which are said to be part of the original manor. History The site was inhabited by the 12th century. The house came to Wolsey as a possession of the Abbey of St Albans in 1515 and passed to Henry VIII in 1531. By the mid-16th century, there was a timber-framed long gallery 15 feet broad and 253 feet in length. Most of the house was made of brick. Catherine of Aragon came to live at the More in the winter of 1531/32. The house was redecorated by the painter John Hethe with the Queen's badges (the ciphers of Anne Boleyn) in 1534. In 1541, Hethe painted the king's bedchamber with blue bice and fine colours. Stained glass was installed by Galyon Hone. Provision was made in 1542 for the king's archery and two deer barns were built. There were two grandstands to watch the hunting. It seems that the building was abandoned after 1556 and may have had inadequate foundations.Colvin, Howard, ed., The History of the King's Works, vol. 4 part 2, HMSO, (1982), 164-169, with conjectural plan. The royal inventory of 1547 listed 157 items at the More in the care of Richard Hobbes. Ten of the suites of tapestry had borders with Wolsey's coat-of-arms. Two crimson velvet chairs were embroidered and carved with Anne Boleyn's initials.Starkey, David, ed., The Inventory of Henry VIII, vol. 1, Society of Antiquaries, (1998), nos. 13334-13491; chairs no. 13423 Remedial work was attempted between 1547 and 1552. A detailed survey was taken in 1568. In 1576, the 2nd Earl of Bedford leased the house. He apparently decided the house was not worth restoring and in 1598 it was recorded as being in ruins. The house was finally demolished in 1661. In about 1617, the 3rd Earl of Bedford built a new house on the hill to the southwest, within the deer park. Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford, described her building and improvements at Moor Park in a letter to a friend: \\"...my works at the More, where I have been a patcher this summer, and I am still adding some trifles of pleasure to that place I am so much in love with, as, if I were so fond of any man, I were in hard case.\\"Richard Griffin Lord Braybrooke, The Private Correspondence of Jane Lady Cornwallis (London, 1842), p. 48.

A right-handed batsman, he struggled at first-class level, scoring only 96 runs from five innings - largely in a career-best knock of 33. He did, however, enjoy greater success as an all- rounder in District Cricket's Hawke Cup for Wairarapa, and as a bowler for Central District's under-23 team. He was also a very occasional right-arm medium bowler, who sent down a tidy yet wicket-less 64 balls. Career Short was born in January 1953 in Whangarei in Northland, and he joined Wairarapa's cricket team - playing a number of matches of the Hawke Cup between 1970 and 1988. His achievements in the Hawke Cup of 1970/71 saw enough success to win him a place in the Central District's Under-23 team, for whom he played three matches, taking consecutive five-wicket-hauls. His efforts at this level earned him selection for his first match on 30 December 1978, having scored 75 and 105 against Nelson at the end of January, and 127 against Hutt Valley on 25 February. In his first match for the Central District Stags, against Auckland, he took a catch to dismiss John Wiltshire for 40 as Auckland reached 284. Opening the batting, Short's 20 was overshadowed by Test batsman Robert Anderson's 127; Central District closing their innings at 285/6 with a one-run lead. Short then took two further catches and bowled three economical - yet wicket-less - overs for four runs, and scored 15 as the match ended in a draw. Short returned to Wairarapa to score 60 and 99 against Poverty Bay at the end of January 1979, and returned to Central Districts to face Otago in the final of the 1978/79 Shell Trophy. Otago, thanks largely to a knock of 222 by Ian Rutherford, scored 543/8 declared. Short, batting at six, scored 33 of the Stags' 275. Following on, only three runs were scored by the undefeated openers before the match ended as a draw. He returned again to the Hawke Club prior to making his one-day debut against Northern Districts at Hamilton on 25 November 1979. He batted at seven, and was stumped for two as Central Districts collapsed to an eight-wicket defeat. Short returned for the final time to the Central Districts team to face Northern Districts in the 1979/1980 Shell Trophy, on 12 January 1980. Batting at six once more, he scored 13 and 15 as Northern Districts took a close-one wicket victory. Short continued to play for Wairarapa in the next few years, including a match on 10 January 1981, where he took three wickets for 64 runs and scored a century. His final match, against Southland, took place in February 1988.

They have been identified as a Bronze Age warrior chieftain. A few other examples of burial in a scooped-out oak tree have been found in Scotland and East Anglia, but it was an unusual method of inhumation and the remains found near Scarborough, are the best preserved. The remains were discovered in 1834 in a burial mound near Gristhorpe and excavated under the auspices of the Scarborough Philosophical Society. The Bronze Age remains were originally donated to the Rotunda Museum in Scarborough and a report of the excavation was published in the same year by the precocious 17-year-old William Crawford Williamson, the son of the Museum curator. They were taken to Bradford in 2005 for a new evaluation directed by Drs. Nigel Melton and Janet Montgomery, while the museum was being refurbished. Recent findings The Bradford team deduced that the man was a high status individual, not unlike a tribal chieftain judging by his height of six feet. Growing to such a height may well have been because of a relatively good diet, an indication of social standing. He also boasts a nearly-full set of teeth in remarkable condition. Other clues to his status come from the grave goods. There were a lot of artefacts. The body was wrapped in a skin cloak, of which only fragments survive. There was a bronze dagger, a bark vessel that was sealed in some way, flint tools, hair from the hide and a wicker basket containing food residue. The individual was of advanced age and seems to have died from natural causes. There were a few healed fractures, consistent with the life of a warrior. Much of what was dug up in has not survived. There was a lot of fatty material, probably from degraded body tissues, in the watery coffin which had dried out. The bones were discoloured by the reaction of iron in the water with the tannin in the bark of the coffin and the skeleton was originally preserved by boiling it in glue in a laundry copper. This ruined any chance by present-day archaeologists to do a DNA study but collagen was able to be used from the skeleton for both dating and dietary isotope purposes. Several radiocarbon dates from the tree rings of the oak coffin and the composition of a ceremonial bronze dagger helped confirm the dating making this burial one of the best dated Early Bronze Age burials in Britain. Dendrochronological dating was attempted but the sequence remains floating until further finds from the period can be dated. Metallurgical and lead isotope analyses of the bronze dagger blade indicate that Ireland is likely to be the ultimate source of the copper ore used, but that it had been recycled with other ores being introduced. The original 1834 illustration of the blade appears to depict a scabbard that is no longer present. Scanning electron microscopy detected traces of animal collagen on the blade, confirming the former presence of a scabbard or sheath. The pommel of the dagger was fashioned from whalebone. The flint knife provided evidence of it having been hafted and re-sharpened twice. Microwear analysis indicated that it had been used to work hides and cut meat. The recent work has permitted comparison with radiocarbon dates from other British examples, as well as with the series of dendrochronological dates obtained from Bronze Age tree-trunk coffin burials which have been excavated in Denmark where such burials are much more common. Isotopic analysis of a tooth has indicated he is likely to have originated from the Scarborough area and ate a lot of meat throughout his life. Radiocarbon dating of the tooth dentine and thigh bone undertaken at Bradford University has shown that he died around 4000 years ago.Gristhorpe Man: an Early Bronze Age log-coffin burial scientifically defined. Andrew S Wilson, Adrian Evans, Alison Sheridan, Christopher Knüsel, Cathy Batt, Armin Schmidt, Tim Horsley, Alan Ogden, A R Ogden. 2010, Antiquity https://www.academia.edu/35968374/Gristhorpe_Man_an_Early_Bronze_Age_log_coffin_burial_scientifically_defined Dr Alan Ogden, an osteologist at Bradford University, has completed what is thought to be a first in forensic archaeology by reconstructing Gristhorpe Man’s face and making him ‘talk’ using computer software. A possible cause of disability if not death for Gristhorpe Man was ascertained during CT-scanning at St Luke's Hospital in Bradford. The researchers found that he had a brain tumour growing on the left side of his skull which may well have led to him suddenly collapsing and possibly epilepsy. The remains are back on display in the Rotunda Museum in Scarborough alongside details of the new insights and findings into his life. Gristhorpe Man has made an appearance in Michael Portillo's Great British Railway Journeys when Portillo visited Scarborough. Details of the project and new findings have been published in Current Archaeology (Vol. 250 2011) and Antiquity (Vol. 84 No. 325 2010) and a book of the full project and scientific analyses undertaken \\"Gristhorpe Man: a life and death in the Bronze Age\\" edited by Nigel Melton, Janet Montgomery and Christopher Knüsel was published in 2014.

It is named after the Slavic tribe of the Drevani.  Definition  In the German federal system of natural geographic regions, the Drawehn forms the eastern end of the Lüneburg Heath (D28), the Ostheide, bordering the neighbouring area of Wendland and Altmark (D29). From a cultural perspective the Drawehn is, however, largely oriented towards Wendland. Its precise boundary is not clear: the name is often used synonymously for the ridge known as the East Hanoverian End Moraine (Osthannoverschen Endmoräne). Then again it may refer only to its southern portion - the northern part being referred to as the Göhrde. Sources from the 14th to the 16th century counted the entire upper and lower geest west of the Jeetze plain and east of the Uelzen-Bevensen Bowl as well as the Dahlenburg Basin as the Drawehn. In this sense the term is defined as the main ridge of the East Hanoverian End Moraine including its foothills as well as the flatter eastern slopes to the fluviatile Lüchow plain. The northern end of the East Hanoverian End Moraine can be further subdivided into the Göhrde and Klötzie regions – with no clear cut transition or boundary. The Klötzie (also the Elbhöhen or \\"Elbe Heights\\") is the northern edge of the ridge, up to 70 metres high, which slopes steeply down to the glacial valley of the River Elbe between Hitzacker and Neu Darchau. And Göhrde refers to the more or less wooded terrain of the Göhrde State Forest (rather than the administrative area) which is located on a rolling area of high ground on the northwest part of the ridge.  Formation  The old moraine landscape of Lower Saxony emerged in the course of four great glacial advances of the Scandinavian ice sheet 350,000 to 130,000 years ago – one during the Elster glaciation and three during the Saale glaciation. The glacier of the most recent, Weichselian glaciation only reached the northeastern edge of the present Elbe valley depression, so that the existing terminal moraines beyond that point there were only affected periglacially, for example in the shape of solifluction over the frozen ground, by meltwater erosion and sediments or through wind- blown deposits of sand. The last two Saale glaciation advances in particular, the Drenthe II and the Warthe stadia, unfolded the East Hanonerian Terminal Moraine. It is therefore geomorphologically younger than the geest in western and central Lower Saxony, but clearly older than the young moraine landscapes in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Ostholstein (= Baltic Uplands).

Plot During the Spanish Civil War, a battalion of the International Brigades is cut off without water or ammunition. The commander, Major Bolaños, requests his commissar, the German Heinrich Witting, to select five volunteers who will remain in the trenches and hold off the enemy, while the battalion retreats across the Ebro River. Witting chooses the Frenchman Pierre, the German Willi, the Pole Oleg, the Spaniard José and the Bulgarian Dimitri. In addition, the Soviet radio operator Vasia stays behind to handle communications. After the battalion leaves, the group fends off the Nationalists for several hours and then breaks out. Vasia disappears; while searching for him, Witting is spotted by the enemy and shot. Before he dies, he rips a piece of paper into five parts which he encapsulates in spent cartridges. He gives a cartridge to each of his five men and orders them to carry it back to the battalion, claiming it contains an important message. It would be decipherable only if all the pieces would reach their destination. After finding Vasia, the volunteers make their way across the Sierra in the hot summer, and run out of water. All the wells in the area are guarded by the Nationalists. The group's members become desperate with thirst, and their attempts to get water are frustrated. They begin to quarrel among themselves. Vasia, mad with thirst, wanders into a village in search of water and is caught by the Guardia Civil. Before being executed, the others rescue him. Vasia then volunteers to hold off the pursuing Falangists. Pretending to surrender, he approaches the enemy soldiers with a grenade in his hand and dies when it explodes. Afterwards, Pierre leaves his cover to try and drink from a well, only to be shot dead. The others, almost too dehydrated to move, cross the Ebro and rejoin the battalion. When the cartridges are unsealed, they learn that the message was: \\"Stay together, so you will survive\\".

William Herbert Purvis (also known as Herbert Purvis) was born in Sussex, England. He and his father John Purvis (1820–1909) came to Hawaii in 1878. A distant cousin, Edith Mary Winifred Purvis, also came to Hawaii and married into the Holdsworth family; their daughter married into the Greenwell family (early Kona coffee merchants) and had daughter Amy B. H. Greenwell (1920–1974). Edith's brothers were Robert William Theodore, a businessman on Kauai, and Edward William Purvis who served as King Kalakaua's vice chamberlain. The Purvis family were early investors in the Pacific Sugar Mill at Kukuihaele near Waipio Valley on the northeast coast \\"Big Island\\" of Hawaii. The lands were from the estate of King Lunalilo, consolidated by Purvis and the royal doctor Georges Phillipe Trousseau. In 1882, Purvis introduced macadamia seeds into the Hawaiian Islands after he visited Australia. He planted seed nuts that year at Kapulena, Hawaii at , just southeast of the Pacific Mill. For many years, the trees were grown just as ornamental plants. Macadamias have since become an important tree crop in Hawaii. Total area in macadamia production is and Hawaii’s macadamia industry is valued at $175 million annually. Major macadamia production is on the island of Hawaii. Purvis introduced the mongoose to control rats at the plantation in 1883. The mongoose has become an invasive pest. In 1889 he was elected into the Royal Colonial Institute. In 1887, Purvis hired Scottish arboriculturalist David McHattie Forbes from his position as Foreman Forester of the estate of Fletcher's Saltoun Hall to import and cultivate cinchona trees above the sugar line in Kukuihaele, Hawaii at the Pacific Sugar Mill. He married Mabel Vida Turner and had at least four children: Arthur Frederic Purvis (1890–1955), Inez Adele Isobel Kapuaimohala Purvis (1891–1961), John Ralph Purvis (1894–1915), and Herbert Charles Purvis (1897–1945).

It was never part of Microsoft's original mobile phone roadmap, and has been described by its former chief executive Steve Ballmer as \\"not the full release Microsoft wanted\\" (which later became Windows Phone 7). Ballmer also indicated that the company \\"screwed up with Windows Mobile\\", lamenting that Windows Mobile 7 was not yet available and that the Windows Mobile team needed to try to recoup losses. Microsoft unveiled this version at the 2009 Mobile World Congress in February, and several devices were supplied with it. It was released to manufacturers on May 11, 2009; the first devices running the operating system appeared in late October 2009. Several phones that officially shipped with Windows Mobile 6.1 can be officially updated to Windows Mobile 6.5. This update includes some significant new added features, such as a revamped GUI, a new Today screen resembling that of Microsoft's Zune player with vertically scrollable labels (called 'Titanium'). WM6.5 also included the Internet Explorer Mobile 6 browser, with improved interface. Along with Windows Mobile 6.5, Microsoft announced several cloud computing services codenamed \\"SkyBox\\", \\"SkyLine\\", \\"SkyMarket\\". \\"SkyBox\\" has been confirmed as My Phone, while \\"SkyMarket\\" has been confirmed as Windows Marketplace for Mobile. This version was designed mainly for easier finger usage. Some reviewers have noted interface inconsistencies, with some applications having small buttons making them harder to operate using only a finger. Whilst this version of Windows Mobile does not natively support capacitive screens, mobile manufacturers have been able to use them on their devices.  Updates  In the months following the release of Windows Mobile 6.5, development shifted from Windows Mobile to its successor Windows Phone. As such no major upgrades were planned or released, although three minor updates; 6.5.1, 6.5.3 and 6.5.5; were made to satisfy consumers during the transition period. 6.5.1 brings larger user interface elements, including icon based soft buttons (rather than text based), an updated contacts app, native support for A-GPS, improved threaded text messaging, and performance improvements. It was unofficially ported to several Windows Mobile phones. The second minor update was announced on February 2, 2010, along with the Sony Ericsson Aspen which was the first phone to use this version. 6.5.3 continues the trend of attempting to provide a more finger- friendly user interface with several new usability features such as native support for multitouch; although device maker HTC Corporation created proprietary workarounds to allow multi-touch to work on some applications it installed on its HD2 handset (However, Microsoft applications on this handset, such as the Internet Explorer web browser, did not support multi-touch.) and drag-and-drop start menu icons. Touchable tiles replaced soft keys. Internet Explorer Mobile 6 also received some major updates including decreased page load time, improved memory management and gesture smoothing. As with other updates it was unofficially ported to some other devices. Additional features include threaded email and Office Mobile 2010. The last minor update and the last released version is 6.5.5. It first leaked in January 2010, and was unofficially ported to some Windows Mobile phones. The name Windows Mobile 6.5.5 has been applied to these newer builds, although this name remains unconfirmed by Microsoft.  Reception  Windows Mobile 6.5 has received negative reviews. Gizmodo criticized it for being a superficial upgrade from Windows Mobile 6.1 and noted that it is \\"just not enough\\".

The film is a story of a compelling, creative friendship.  Upcoming Projects  Callicoon Center Band Two and a half hours from New York City lie the Catskill Mountains and rural Sullivan County. For the last seventy-five years, in the summer, for one hour on Wednesday nights, rain or shine, the Callicoon Center Band has been playing. The audience is mostly locals, because Wednesday night is not really convenient for the city people whose second homes dot the hills and lakes surrounding Callicoon Center. Also the music may not be quite to their taste. Polkas, Waltzes, and the hits of fifty years ago come blaring and bouncing out of the thirty member band. Local music teachers, merchants, social workers, teens and retirees commit to ten weeks of rehearsal in the spring and ten performances over the summer. In this hour-long documentary, Academy Award nominated® director Alice Elliott celebrates music and community as the band rides the waves of change.

The filmmakers, several of whom are current and former residents, are passionate about sharing the story of Manhattan Plaza with the world. It is a unique model of what can be achieved by bringing together over 3,500 people from differing cultural, ethnic and economic backgrounds.

The reserve was established in 1979, and is managed by the California Department of Fish and Game. The Pine Hill Ecological Reserve is one unit of the much larger Pine Hill Preservesystem that consists of five separate units of varying size that total more than and protects eight rare plants and their gabbro soil habitat. It is jointly managed by several local, state and federal agencies through a Cooperative Management Agreement. History Preservation efforts started in 1977, when surplus lands managed by the California Department of Forestry were to be disposed of in the Pine Hill area. Environmental groups joined together to urge the state to set aside significant natural areas from development and by 1979, the summit of Pine Hill became a state-owned ecological reserve of . In 1991, were added by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and in 2002 and 2004, BLM and the county of El Dorado added another . Flora Four of the eight rare plants are endemic and known to exist only in the Pine Hill area and nowhere else. Five of the eight species are listed as threatened species or endangered species under both the state and federal endangered species acts. The western portion of El Dorado County has almost 10% (740 species) of California's native plants growing here, making the site nationally significant for species diversity. Six of the eight rare plants grow in the Pine Hill Ecological Reserve unit. =Rare plants= Rare plants are protected at the federal level by the Endangered Species Act (ESA) which mandates that the agencies authorized by the ESA (US Fish and Wildlife Service, National Marine Fisheries Service) provide the secretary of interior the names of species needing protection, a final determination is then made by the secretary and the list is published in the Federal Register, the species are now officially \\"listed\\" or \\"federally listed\\". The Endangered Species Act also requires these same agencies to undertake recovery plans with the goal of delisting the species (for example, the bald eagle is no longer a listed endangered species.)

Stebbins' morning glory Stebbins' morning glory (Calystegia stebbinsii) is State listed as endangered since 1981 and federally listed as endangered since 1996. There are four unique observations in Nevada County and fifteen in El Dorado County. The plant is a leafy perennial herb of the morning glory family (Convolvulaceae). Stebbins' morning glory looks similar to the common morning glory, the difference is the leaf shape. Flowers are white and bloom in spring. Named after G. Ledyard Stebbins, who collected a type specimen in 1970.USFWS Pine Hill Recplan.pdf p.25 Layne's butterweed. Layne's butterweed Layne's butterweed (Packera layneae) (syn: Senecio layneae, Layne's ragweed) has been State listed as rare since 1979 and federally listed as threatened since 1996. A perennial herb of the aster family (Asteraceae), it has yellow flowers and blooms from April to August. Besides El Dorado County, it can also be found in Yuba, Tuolumne and Butte counties. It is found in all the units of the Preserve in rocky, open interior chaparral and woodland areas. It was first collected under the name Senecio layneae by Kate Layne-Curran near Sweetwater Creek of El Dorado County in May 1883.

It is a low-growing shrub of the cacao family (Sterculiaceae), with red-orange flowers that bloom April through July. It is possibly a close relative to the dwarf flannelbush species found in Butte, Nevada, and Yuba Counties in the Sierras, but ongoing studies have yet to determine to what degree. The species was first collected by Beecher Crampton in 1956. The Pine Hill flannelbush is endemic (grows nowhere else) to Pine Hill area. Total species population is estimated at 2,000, which makes the flannelbush one of the rarest plants in California.

El Dorado mule ears (Wyethia reticulata), Red Hills soaproot (Chlorogalum grandiflorum) and the Bisbee Peak rush-rose (Helianthemum suffrutescens) are not on the state or federal lists, but are a \\"species of concern\\" (or \\"sensitive\\"), which is a species that may not meet the Endangered Species Act criteria for listing, but have issues such as locally rare, newly discovered, or not enough information about the plant. *El Dorado mule ears (Wyethia reticulata) is native to the Pine Hill area and spreads by underground root sprouts (clonal). Some parent plants may be several hundred years old.USFWS Recplan.pdf p. 90 *Red Hills soaproot (Chlorogalum grandiflorum) is also found in the Red Hills area of Tuolumne County, is a perennial herb and blooms in June with flowers opening at dusk and closing at morning. It grows in chaparral on serpentine and gabbro soils, and also in ponderosa pine woodland. *Bisbee Peak rush-rose (Helianthemum suffrutescens) is a low-growing evergreen shrub with yellow flowers, and flat leaves covered with soft, very dense white hairs. Besides El Dorado County, it is found in Amador, Calaveras, Tuolumne, Mariposa, and Sacramento counties and looks very similar to the common rush-rose (Helianthemum scoparium). It is a species of concern because more information is needed about this plant. Red Hills soaproot Landscape, wildlife, and vegetation The landscape of the reserve unit includes the summit of Pine Hill (2,031 ft) with prominent ridgelines heading northeast, west, and south. Waterways in the general area include a portion of the South Fork American River, along with perennial and intermittent tributary streams such as Weber, Martel and Sweetwater Creeks. The Preserve is formed by five non-contiguous units (of which the ecological reserve is the centrally-located, state-owned unit), that stretch over a area of the gabbro soil formation. The gabbro soil formation dates from 175 million years ago during the late Jurassic Period. The dominant soils are classified as sandy loams of the Rescue Soil Series. These soils are well drained, with a high iron and magnesium content and a characteristic red color. The other units in the Preserve are: Cameron Park, Martel Creek, Penny Lane and Salmon Falls. There are three main vegetation types — grassland, woodland, and chaparral. The chaparral type is known as Northern Mixed Chaparral (NMC) or gabbroic NMC, of the California interior chaparral and woodlands ecoregion, and is the most common occurring vegetation within the Preserve. Plant species of the chaparral type include chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum), white leaf Manzanita (Arctostaphylos viscida), toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia), California redbud (Cercis occidentalis), poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), different species of Ceanothus, and California coffeeberry (Frangula californica) (syn: Rhamnus californica). Wildlife in the area include coyote, black-tailed jackrabbit, black-tailed deer, mountain lion, California ground squirrel, and black bear. Bird species include red-winged blackbird, great egret, red-tailed hawk, and valley quail. Some of the reptiles in the Pine Hill Preserve are western rattlesnake, California whipsnake, and the California horned lizard. Background The summit of Pine Hill, elevation , has a fire lookout station operated by the California Department of Forestry (CDF). Botanists believed the rare plants were safe on the state-owned property until the agency bulldozed a firebreak across the summit in the mid 1970s. Stands of Pine Hill flannelbush and the El Dorado bedstraw were damaged. Beginning in 1977, the California Native Plant Society became aware of CDF's intention to dispose of the property surrounding the fire lookout station. Correspondence from CDF to the state's Department of General Services listed properties, induding Pine Hill, as surplus. The surplus parcels list then went through the legislative process where it was determined that the properties were indeed surplus to the state's needs. The Society united with other environmental groups to encourage the state government to begin a coordinated effort to preserve significant natural areas. From 1978 to 1979, a multi-constituent committee, including the California Native Plant Society, Audubon Society, and California Resources Agency, met to set up a significant natural area for Pine Hill. In May 1979, the California Fish and Game Commission accepted the property and a transfer was made from the Department of Forestry to the Department of Fish and Game. =Listings= Five of the eight rare plants were listed under California's Native Plant Protection Act in the years 1979 to 1982, and were federally listed in 1996. Seven of the eight species were in the first edition of CNPS's Inventory of Rare and Endangered Plants of California published in December,1974. One month later, the Smithsonian Institution presented to the US Congress their report that listed four of the eight species as either endangered or threatened. =County actions= The California Native Plant Society together with the Department of Fish and Game provided El Dorado County with information about the various species and the need for protection in 1989. Housing construction and the ensuing habitat fragmentation, road construction and maintenance, herbicide spraying, change in fire frequency, off-road vehicle use, illegal dumping, horse overgrazing, competition from invasive non-native vegetation, and mining activities imperil these species. The county Board of Supervisors approved funding of a field survey and study by the private company, EIP Associates in early 1991. The final report, titled Preserve Sites and Preservation Strategies for Rare Plant Species in Western El Dorado County was completed in November, 1991. In 1992, The Board of Supervisors had an advisory committee formed, with members from the development community, county, state and federal agencies, and environmental groups, including the American River Conservancy. The goal of the El Dorado County Rare Plant Advisory Committee was to identify feasible preserve sites, funding mechanisms, and management strategies for these future preserves using information from the EIP report and other sources. The Committee presented the final report to the County in February, 1993. The report recommended setting aside more than in five separate areas and two small, satellite areas. The preserve sites were identified because they would protect more than one population of each species, protect against catastrophic loss at any one site, maintain genetic diversity within the rare plant species, and preserve a representation of the geographic range, diversity of plant associations, and other potentially important site-specific conditions associated with the rare plants. The Board of Supervisors approved, in concept, four of the preserves and directed that the Salmon Falls, Martell Creek, Pine Hill and Penny Lane preserve units be included in the General Plan update. The Board did not approve the Cameron Park southern preserve site at that time. The El Dorado County General Plan was adopted by the Board in January, 1996 and amended (Resolution 57-98) in March, 1998 to include the Cameron Park unit. =Cooperative Management Agreement= In 2001, a Cooperative Management Agreement (CMA) for the Pine Hill Preserve was signed by three federal agencies (Bureau of Land Management, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and US Bureau of Reclamation), two state agencies (California Department of Fish and Game and California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection), El Dorado County, El Dorado Irrigation District, and the American River Conservancy. A separate agreement between El Dorado County and the Bureau of Land Management created funding for a preserve manager. The Cooperative Management Agreement sets the amount of participation for each agency. El Dorado County is tasked with several actions, one of which is to create and implement an INRMP- Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan. The American River Conservancy's participation includes maintaining property acquisition summary records on behalf of all the member agencies. Public access-Pine Hill unit Access is restricted to guided tours because of the rarity of the plants, and that the reserve is almost completely surrounded by private property. The reserve highlights the plant community that grow on soil derived from gabbro bedrock. A gated, closed road leads to the summit. \\"Although these plants are fire- adapted, a fire at the wrong time of the year could be devastating to one or more of these rare species.\\" explains DFG Botanist Daniel Burmester, in the Outdoor California magazine article dated Nov-Dec 2001. Naturalist-led tours are offered by the Bureau of Land Management and are limited to 30 people.

In the field of contracts it is well known for MacKinnon LJ's decision in the Court of Appeal, where he put forth the \\"officious bystander\\" formulation for determining what terms should be implied into agreements by the courts. In the field of company law, it is known primarily to stand for the principle that damages may be sought for breach of contract by a director even though a contract may de facto constrain the exercise of powers to sack people found in the company's constitution. Facts Mr Shirlaw had been the managing director of Southern Foundries Ltd, which was in the business of iron castings. But then another company called ‘Federated Foundries Ltd’ took over the business. The new owners had altered article 8 of Southern Foundries Ltd's constitution, empowering two directors and the secretary (who were friends of Federated Foundries) to remove any director. Then they acted on it, by sacking Mr Shirlaw. Mr Shirlaw's contract, signed in 1933 stated that he was to remain in post for ten years. Mr Shirlaw sued the company for breach of contract, claiming for an injunction to stay in office or substantial damages. Judgment Humphrey's J in the High Court awarded £12,000 to Mr Shirlaw for breach of contract. =Court of Appeal= The Court of Appeal held (Sir Wilfrid Greene MR dissenting on this point) that it was an implied term in the 21 December 1933 agreement that the company would not remove Mr Shirlaw from his directorship for the time in which he was appointed as managing director. Furthermore, it was held that it was an implied term that the company would not alter its articles to create a right of removal and there was no case for reducing the damages awarded by the High Court. At the end of his judgment MacKinnon LJ read out this famous passage.[1939] 2 KB 206, 227 Goddard LJ concurred with MacKinnon LJ =House of Lords= Viscount Maugham, Lord Atkin, Lord Wright, Lord Romer and Lord Porter upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal. The House of Lords held it was wrong to act on the change in the articles, that this was a breach of contract, and upheld the £12,000 damages award. Lord Atkin gave a succinct first judgment.717 Lord Wright, concurring, stated that it was a breach of contract if a director was removed without cause.722 See also *UK company law *Imperial Hydropathic Hotel Co, Blackpool v Hampson (1882) 23 Ch D 1 *Isle of Wight Railway Company v Tahourdin (1884) LR 25 Ch D 320  References  Category:United Kingdom company case law Category:English contract case law Category:House of Lords cases Category:1940 in British law Category:1940 in case law ","title":"Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd v Shirlaw"},{"id":"23108699","title":"Canora (provincial electoral district)"},{"id":"23108721","text":"Simeon (Menologion of Basil II, 10th century) Simon is described in the New Testament as one of the brothers of Jesus ().Greek New Testament, Matthew 13:55: \\"οὐχ οὖτός ἐστιν ὁ τοῦ τέκτονος υἱός; οὐχ ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ λέγεται μαριὰμ καὶ οἱ _ἀδελφοὶ_ αὐτοῦ ἰάκωβος καὶ ἰωσὴφ καὶ σίμων καὶ ἰούδας;\\" In , people ask concerning Jesus, \\"Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?\\" while in they ask, \\"Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us?\\" The Catholic Church defined that \\"brothers of Jesus\\" are not biological children of Mary, because of the dogma of the perpetual virginity of Mary, by virtue of which it rejects the idea that Simon and any other than Jesus Christ God could be a biological son of Mary, suggesting that the so-called Desposyni were either sons of Joseph from a previous marriage (in other words, step- brothers) or else were cousins of Jesus.

It is the fastest growing religion in U.S. prisons, where the population is 18 percent Muslim (compared to 1 percent for the general population); 80 percent of all prison religious conversion are to Islam. History Black Muslim organizations, such as The Nation of Islam and Moorish Science Temple of America, formally began prison outreach efforts in 1942. However evidence suggests that Muslims may have comprised a small fraction of the inmate populate in the United States as early as the 1910s. New research brought to light an African immigrant inmate at San Quentin State Prison named Lucius Lehman, who was proclaiming himself to be a Muslim religious leader during his incarceration from 1910-1924. Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad himself was incarcerated in the early 1940s when he was convicted of draft evasion. Elijah Muhammad's organization would later gain its most famous convert, Malcolm X, who took interest in Black Muslim movement while incarcerated. Rate of conversion to Islam In addition to immigration, the state, federal and local prisons of the United States may be a contributor to the growth of Islam in the United States. J. Michael Waller claims that Muslim inmates comprise 17–20% of the prison population in New York, or roughly 350,000 inmates in 2003. He also claims that 80% of the prisoners who find faith while in prison convert to Islam.United State Senate, Committee on the Judiciary , Testimony of Dr. J. Michael Waller October 14, 2003 These converted inmates are mostly African American, with a growing Hispanic minority.SpearIt, Raza Islamica: Prisons, Hip Hop & Converting Converts August 3, 2010 (revised February 27, 2013). According to a 2003 estimate by FBI, there are 350,000 Muslims in federal, state and local prison, about 30,000 - 40,000 more being converted every year. Concern and characterization in United States Muslims prisoners have been characterized as a danger or threat for radicalization in the media. Yet despite the fact of there being over 350,000 Muslim inmates in the United States, little evidence indicates widespread radicalization or foreign recruitment. Rather, research has shown that Islam has a long history of positive influence on prisoners, including supporting inmate rehabilitation for decades. An early example of this type of characterizations from the media is a New York Times article that alleged Imam Warith Deen Umar, Islamic chaplain for the New York State prison system, was reported to have praised the September 11 attacks; prompting members of Congress to call for an investigation. The article states that in a 2004 report, the Justice Department faulted the prison system for failing to protect against “infiltration by religious extremists.” However, the report made clear that the problem was not chaplains, but rather unsupervised inmates. In January 2010, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by Senator John Kerry, released a report that stated as many as three dozen formerly incarcerated individuals who converted to Islam in American prisons have moved to Yemen where they could pose a \\"significant threat\\". However no documentation or verifiable evidence was provided to back up the committee's report (even though the report stated the individuals traveled to apparently learn Arabic)\\\\--rather it was simply accepted and invoked as evidence. Another example of such characterization comes from Annenberg Professor of International Communication J. Michael Waller, who asserted that outside Islamist groups linked to terrorism are attempting to radicalize Muslim converts in prison, but other experts suggest that when radicalization does occur, it has little to no connection with these outside interests.

Kelsey, directly subordinate to Echols from 1934 to 1945, called him \\"The Man Who Won World War II.\\" Early career Oliver Patton Echols was born on March 4, 1892 in Charlottesville, Virginia, to William Holding Echols, a university professor.Mathematics at West Point in the Early Twentieth Century Oliver Echols attended Virginia Polytechnic Institute and the University of Virginia, studying aviation engineering. Echols enlisted in 1916 and served in World War I with the United States Army Air Service, American Expeditionary Force, from August 1917 to April 1919, participating as an aviator in the battles of Champagne-Marne, Aisne-Marne, St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne. At the rank of captain, Echols served as Chief of Air Service, I Corps, for the final drive against German forces. Echols's educational and military preparation for his later specialization included attendance at the Army Industrial College, Command and General Staff School, Army War College, and Air Corps Tactical School. He served in the Air Corps Experimental Engineering Section and the Procurement Section before becoming the chief engineer of the Materiel Division from 1934 to 1938. War production In January 1936, Echols telephoned Howard Hughes to say the Air Corps was interested in purchasing the record-breaking Hughes H-1 Racer as a pursuit plane—it was faster than anything they had. Hughes agreed to fly the aircraft to Wright Field for a demonstration, but he failed to show up for the appointment that Echols had set up with higher Air Corps brass. After that snub, Echols never again gave Hughes a chance to bid on Air Corps projects, not even in October 1941 when Hughes offered the twin-boom D-2 fighter-bomber design. Echols allowed Wright Field engineers to examine the D-2 but they concluded that it would be too heavy for its own engines after incorporating required military features such as armor plate, a bullet- resistant windshield and stronger landing gear.Bartlett, Donald L.; Steele, James B. Howard Hughes: His Life and Madness, pp. 88, 108–109. Retrieved on June 5, 2009. Echols was assistant chief of the Materiel Division at Wright Field near Dayton, Ohio from 1939 to 1940. As chief of that division, which was headquartered in Washington, he served from 1940 to 1942. In March 1942, a reorganization changed his title to commanding general, Materiel Command, in the Army Air Forces headquarters—a position changed a year later to assistant chief of staff for materiel, maintenance and distribution. Until April 1945 Echols continued to play the major role in the production of the prime tools of American airpower. The real impetus to aircraft production came in May 1940 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt went to Congress with a call for a program of no less than 50,000 \\"military and naval\\" aircraft per year for the nation's defense. (The Air Corps and the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics agreed that the Navy would get 12,500 of these.) A year and a half later, on December 7, 1941, the airframe weight of U.S. aircraft production increased sixfold—from the rate of per year, to . By November 1942 the production rate had tripled again, to 50,000 aircraft per year. In the following year and a half to June 1944, Echols supervised another tripling of production. From 1941 on, United States aircraft production was much greater than the combined output of Japan and Germany, and the force of 3,305 combat planes in December 1941 grew to 41,000 in August 1945. Not all of these aircraft were of self- powered metal construction: in March 1942, Echols told the joint Senate–House committee that the Army Air Corps had ordered 1000 wooden gliders, each capable of carrying 50 soldiers.Oswego Palladium-Times, March 18, 1942. Asks 17 Billion For Use In War: President Recommends More Than 8 Billion For Army Air Corps. Retrieved on June 5, 2009. One of Echols's most important yet little known roles was his membership from 1943 to 1945 on the Air Production Board and on the Executive Committee of the War Production Board. He represented the Army Air Forces in the committee task of coordination of all production, and the establishment of priorities for use of tools, materiel and manpower within the national war program. Helping to determine the relative strength of air versus land and sea forces of the United States were one of Echols's responsibilities, as was the task of deciding relative strengths of fighter aircraft to light-, medium- and heavy bomber forces. In early 1939, a combination of Army Air Forces tactical staff under General Arnold and Materiel Division engineers under then-Lieutenant Colonel Echols, prescribed the military requirements around which the B-29 Superfortress was to be built. As Boeing was testing the first prototype, Echols surprised Chief Engineer Wellwood Beall of Boeing by telling him that the Army Air Forces intended to spend $2 billion on the bomber.Time, July 19, 1954. Gamble in the Sky, page 8 of 9. Retrieved on June 5, 2009. The first production model was completed in July 1943 and 11 months later B-29s were bombing Japan. While at Wright Field and in Washington, Echols was known in the profession as the man chiefly responsible for the long, hard process of bringing a plane into being—planes such as the B-24 Liberator, the B-17 Flying Fortress, the B-50 Superfortress and the B-36 Peacemaker. He helped with the initial planning that led to the B-47 Stratojet and B-52 Stratofortress and the earliest American jet aircraft.

It is a stone church built in the late 18th century by the area's Palatine German immigrant population. It has been renovated significantly since then. The church congregation was established in 1729.http://www.frontiernet.net/~rhinebeckreformed/ Worshippers at first were those who farmed the surrounding areas, but as the nearby villages of Rhinebeck and Red Hook grew and Lutheran churches were established there, the local congregation dwindled. Today only quarterly meetings are held. In 1975 it and the accompanying parsonage (now home to the Museum of Rhinebeck History) and schoolhouse were listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Property The church and outbuildings are located on a parcel on the west side of a curved stretch of Route 9, just 0.6 mile (1 km) north of its junction with NY 9G. It is midway between the villages of Rhinebeck and Red Hook, on a gentle rise in the land. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs The main building, the church, is directly opposite the junction with Stone Church Road. It is a three-by-five-bay fieldstone two- and-a-half-story edifice with a four-story tower in its southeast corner. The east and west walls are fenestrated with high round-arched glass windows trimmed in brick. The main entrance is located on the east side of the tower. Inside the pulpit is on the west, with galleries of pews on the other three sides. The tower itself is built in four stages. The first three stories are fieldstone, with brick-trimmed round-arched openings matching those on the building. They are filled with doors on two sides of the first story, windows on the second and louvered vents on the third. The second stage is a square, flushboard-sided wood segment with round-arched louvered vents. It is topped with an octagonal section trimmed with pilasters at the corners and finally the cupola, crowned with a weathervane and gold ball. Stephen McCarty, a local builder, was contractor for changes implemented during 1823–24 that re- oriented the church, that convertit from a meetinghouse type space into a church type space, and that added a tower. alt=A side view of the church on an overcast day with the steeple at left. On the main block are five round-arched windows similar to those on the steeple To the south along the highway is the schoolhouse. It is a one-story clapboard-sided frame building with a gabled metal roof pierced by a brick chimney. Its corners are pilastered as well and there is a small cornice. The parsonage is to the north, past the church cemetery. It is a two-story frame building on a stone basement with a gabled roof now done in modern shingles. There is a two-story frame wing, added later, on the rear. The roof's eaves have a boxed cornice and plain frieze. On the front is a flat-roofed porch supported by octagonal columns. The first floor has the original Federal style mantels. History Britain had offered its North American colonies as a refuge to Palatine Germans who fled to escape religious persecution following the War of Spanish Succession in the early 18th century. After years in work camps to pay back the cost of passage, in a failed attempt by the British to produce naval stores on the lands of the Livingston family in today's Columbia County, some of the Germans settled in today's Rhinebeck, swelling the population of an area lightly settled by the Dutch a few decades before. In 1715, the Lutheran Germans built a church to share with members of the Dutch Reformed Church until they could establish their own. They were able to do this 14 years later, in 1729. The next year they built their first church on the site of the current building, midway between the two small settlements in the region along the Albany Post Road. At that time the main entrance was in the center of the eastern wall, and there was no tower. By 1786 the congregation had grown to the point that a new building was necessary. It followed the meetinghouse plan, with the exception of the corner tower. The parsonage came later, in 1798, when The Rev. Friedrich Quitman, a man reported to be of high regard within American Lutheranism of the time, was hired as pastor. His son John, later to serve as a general in the Mexican–American War and as governor of Mississippi, was born in the house that year. Later in Quitman's pastorate, in the early 1820s, the congregation hired a local builder named Stephen McCarty to do $3,000 ($ in contemporary dollars) worth of renovations to the church. Following the plans of Christopher Wren's churches in London, its original plan was altered to make it more formal. The original side entrance was closed off, longitudinal aisles were introduced and the pews arranged to focus attention on the pulpit. The tower was added as well. After Quitman's death in 1832, the congregation built the school building. In 1843 all walls save the west one were resurfaced in stucco, and Venetian shutters (currently stored in the tower) were added to the windows. The growth of the villages and the subsequent establishment of Lutheran churches in them led to a decline in membership at St. Peter. In 1860 the church broke with the Lutheran Synod, making it hard to find a new pastor and costing it more members. Renovations continued apace. In 1870 a new pulpit, platform and accompanying furniture were installed. The current pipe organ came along in 1882. Stained glass windows, since removed, were installed in 1890, the last major alteration to the original building. Around that time, John Jacob Astor bought much of the land in the area for his estate, which had been home to most of the remaining congregants, and later demolished the residences. This exacerbated the decline in membership. The church was still able to continue as a weekly church until 1939, when its members finally went back to the quarterly meetings, the minimum activity necessary to qualify as a separate church. The area's Lutheran churches still hold occasional services there, and a small local church meets there. The parsonage and school have been used by the Museum of Rhinebeck History since 1993.

Her background was in engineering, and she worked in aeronautics and aviation safety. She retained a strong interest in science and technology, particularly the role and advancement of women in these fields. Early life Beryl Catherine Myatt was born at Leigh-on-Sea on 18 April 1923. She was the daughter of Ernest Myatt and Dorothy Wood. Platt was educated at Westcliff High School for Girls in Southend-On-Sea, Essex where her favourite subject was mathematics. The headmistress of Westcliff predicted that this \\"outstanding pupil\\" had a university future ahead of her at Cambridge but, despite excellent exam results, the outbreak of the Second World War led to a hiatus in Platt's education. With the fear of German invasion, Platt and her family moved away from the coast and she spent a year at Slough High School for Girls (nowadays Upton Court Grammar School), where she initially gained entrance to read Mathematics at Cambridge. Education In July 1941, the government announced a state bursary – including £25 per week pocket money – for engineering undergraduates to help the war effort, and in the hope that more engineers would be needed to re-build Britain after the war. Platt is quoted as describing this sum as \\"a fortune to me at the time\\", and chose to switch her studies to Aeronautical Engineering. When Platt arrived at Girton College, Cambridge, she was one of five women amongst 250 men studying Mechanical Sciences (now Engineering); she was only the ninth woman to be accepted since her original predecessor in the First World War. Wartime necessity meant the course was reduced to an intensive two years, including for Platt three weeks' experience on the shop floor of the Hawker Aircraft Company. When Platt completed her engineering studies in 1943 women did not receive the same honours as their male counterparts: she was not awarded a degree, only a 'Title of degree'. It was not until five years later, in 1948, that women were admitted to degrees at Cambridge. Aeronautical career Upon graduation in 1943, Platt was advised by C. P. Snow in his role at the University of Cambridge Appointments Board (a sort of careers advisory service) to contribute to the war effort and so Platt choose to return to the Hawker factory. This was the beginning of six years of work between 1943 and 1949 as a technical assistant in the aviation industry. Platt's first job was at Hawkers Experimental Flight Test Department, where she was one of only three women in the department, working alongside men who had left school at fourteen but were highly skilled technicians and craftsmen. Platt's wage for a nominal forty-eight-hour week, in practice extending to all hours, was less than three pounds. Platt worked on the testing and production of three of the RAF's outstanding fighter planes of the time: the Hurricane, the Typhoon, and the Tempest V, the latter being the first conventional aircraft to counter the German V-1 pilotless jet missiles. After the end of the war, Hawker's brilliant chief designer Sidney Camm offered Platt a continued role at Hawkers but Platt declined, preferring to move from war planes to investigating air safety for British European Airways. Some of her analyses were models of their kind, for instance charting procedures to ensure safe landings if an engine failed on take-off or over mountains. Platt quickly established herself as a perfectionist and a distinguished engineer. In 1951, she was elected to membership of the Women's Engineering Society. In 1949, Platt married Stewart Sydney Platt, marking the end of her professional career in aeronautical engineering. Platt became a housewife, and a mother of two children, Hon. Roland Francis Platt (b. 1951) and Hon. Victoria Catherine Platt (b.1953). Both her children are chartered accountants. Once Platt's children began at school she considered a return to the aircraft industry but there were none to be found within range of Writtle, the village where she lived. Instead, Platt turned her hand to politics, although she continued her interest in science and technology. Political career Platt's political career began very locally through her membership of the parochial church council and so she was surprised to be nominated for a sudden vacancy on Chelmsford Rural District Council in 1956, a role she held until 1974. In 1965, Platt was elected to Essex County Council and held this role until 1968, when she was appointed to the office of Alderman of the Essex County Council from 1969 and 1974. Platt was also appointed chairman of the Essex County Council between 1971 and 1980. Platt was created a life peer taking the title Baroness Platt of Writtle, of Writtle in the County of Essex and joined the House of Lords on 28 May 1981. She chose the title Baroness Platt of Writtle, after her home village in Essex, and a cogwheel as her coat of arms, symbolising her life of service as an engineer. On 24 June 1981, less than a month after joining the House, Platt made her maiden speech on a \\"subject very close to [her] heart\\", that of higher and further education. Platt was a member of the European Communities Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men between 1983 and 1988 and became chair of the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) in 1983. In 1984, as a result of encouragement from the Finniston Report, the EOC together with the Engineering Council set up WISE – Women into Science and Engineering. The initiative was very much spearheaded by Platt and was established to highlight the career opportunities for girls and women in science and engineering professions. Platt was an active member of the House of Lords and between 1990 and 2008 she served on a number of committees relating to science, technology and engineering, including the Select Committee on Science and Technology. From 5 October 2010, Platt was on a leave of absence. and she died on 1 February 2015.Baroness Platt of Writtle Honours and appointments Platt was a member of the council of the City and Guilds of London Institute between 1974 and 1994. She was a member of the Cambridge University Appointments Board between 1975 and 1979. She was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1978 Birthday Honours. Platt has been awarded numerous of honorary fellowships and doctorates including an Honorary Fellow of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers (Hon.F.I.Mech.E.) in 1984, an honorary degree of Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) by City University, London, in 1984 an honorary degree of Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.) by Bradford University, an honorary degree of Doctor of Technology (D.Tech.) by Brunel University in 1986, an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) by University of Cambridge in 1987, a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (F.R.Eng.) in 1988, an Honorary Fellow at Girton College, Cambridge in 1988, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (F.R.S.A.). On 16 July 2008, Platt was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) by the University of Southampton. She was given the Freedom of the City of London in 1988. She was also made a liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Engineers in 1988. Between 1984 and 1992, she was Vice-President of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology and between 1994 and 2001 Platt was Chancellor of Middlesex University.

Development  The EF-131 was developed based on fragments of project documentation for the Ju 287 after the Red Army captured the Junkers factory in Dessau. The first prototype was built from components of the Junkers Ju 287 V2 and V3, the second and third prototypes (V – Versuchs – test/research/prototype) of the Luftwaffe's radical forward-swept-wing jet bomber. The V2 was nearly complete before the end of World War 2, but was hidden in the forest at Brandis along with Ju 287 V1 and eventually blown up by the Germans to avoid capture by US forces, and remnants of it, including wing sections, were taken into Red Air Force hands under military intelligence supervision along with the skeletal airframe of the unfinished V3.Lommel, Horst, 2004. Junkers Ju 287: The World's First Swept-Wing Jet Aircraft. Atglen, PA: Shiffer Publishing, Ltd. The V3 was to have been the first 287 to be made to pre-production model specifications, and the eventual EF-131 was almost identical to it in terms of overall design, except in having a slightly longer fuselage. The airplane was completed in the Soviet zone of occupied Germany, but was dismantled and transported to GOZ-1, (Gosudarstvenny Optniy Zavod – state experimental plant), at Dubna near Moscow, because the victorious Allies forbade the construction and testing of aircraft in occupied Germany. OKB-1 at GOZ-1 was formed with Dr. Brunolf Baade as the chief designer, and a very talented team of German engineers seconded by the Soviet government. Extreme pressure was applied to get the aircraft ready to appear in the 1947 Aviation Day fly-past at Tushino airfield, but several factors combined to prevent the EF-131 from appearing. Flight testing in the USSR began on 23 May 1947, at the LII airfield, after the airframe had been strengthened to meet the requirements of a TsAGI(Tsentralniy Aerodinamicheskiy i Gidrodinamicheskiy Institut- central aerodynamics and hydrodynamics institute) structural survey, which revealed major weaknesses of the airframe. The first flight resulted in the port undercarriage collapsing due to a bolt failure, subsequent flight tests revealed major deficiencies such as nosewheel shimmy and tail surface vibration. Rectification of the defects caused many delays but the worst delays were caused by bureaucracy when it was decreed that foreign workers could not work at the LII airfield. The aircraft sat at LII over the winter but the harsh conditions caused the deterioration of rubber components and wiring, which required lengthy repairs. Preparations for resuming flight tests were almost complete in June 1948 when Ministry of Aircraft Industry Order No. 440 ordered that further work on the EF-131 be discontinued, termination of the programme being confirmed by resolution No.3206-1301 issued on 23 August 1948. The EF-131 had become obsolete as newer Soviet-built engines with better performance became available. The airframe of the second prototype was used for the 140 programme.

Under his guidance, the researchers of the department carried out research in the spectral theory of random fields (in particular, his doctoral-degree thesis, which is a Soviet doctorate, was devoted to this theory), asymptotic methods in probability theory, the theory of stochastic differential equations, and applied problems in probability theory and mathematical statistics. The Department of Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics was repeatedly distinguished as the best department of Kiev University. In 1970, the Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics journal () was founded on Yadrenko's initiative. This journal has played an important role in the development of the world-renowned Kiev school of probability theory. Since 1974, the journal is translated into English and is republished by the American Mathematical Society. In 1969, Yadrenko founded another periodical edition, a collection of popular-science articles In the World of Mathematics (). In 1995, this periodical collection was transformed into a popular scientific, methodological, and historical journal. This journal is intended for a broad circle of readers interested in mathematics from schoolchildren to professional mathematicians. As a scientist, Yadrenko is known for his works on the theory of random fields and their statistical analysis. He wrote more than 200 articles in this field, the majority of which were translated into English. A survey of the results obtained by Yadrenko in the theory of random fields can be found in the paper \\"On Yadrenko’s works in the theory of random fields\\".\\"On Yadrenko’s works in the theory of random fields,\\" (Buldygin, Kozachenko, and Leonenko) Ukr. Mat. Zh., 44, No. 11 (1992) Yadrenko's monograph \\"Spectral Theory of Random Fields\\"\\"Spectral Theory of Random Fields\\", Vyshcha Shkola, Kiev (1980) became a handbook for experts in random fields. This book was awarded the Prize of Ukrainian Ministry of Education, and its English version was published in 1983 in the United States. Yadrenko developed the spectral theory of homogeneous and isotropic random fields in Euclidean, Hilbert, and Lobachevskii spaces. These results were used by Yadrenko and his disciples for the solution of important problems of linear prediction and filtration of random fields. He founded the theory of Markov random fields, which represented a new direction in the theory of random fields. Later, the theory of Markov random fields was further developed in works related to problems of statistical physics and quantum field theory. Yadrenko studied the analytic properties of choice functions of random fields. In particular, he established conditions for the continuity, analyticity, and quasianalyticity of random fields. Yadrenko also investigated problems of statistics of random fields. For example, he established conditions for the absolute continuity and singularity of measures that correspond to Gaussian random fields, and he developed efficient methods for the solution of statistical problems for random fields (problems of extrapolation, filtration, interpolation, and estimation of regression coefficients). Yadrenko worked in various branches of applied probability theory, including optimal methods for quality control in mass production, statistical modeling of noises in semiconductors, statistical analysis of random number generators, statistical problems of reliability theory, and statistical models of distributions with random intensity. For a series of works in the theory of random fields, Yadrenko was awarded the Krylov Prize of the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences. Yadrenko was the founder and the leader of a scientific school in random fields and stochastic processes. Among his disciples, there are 45 candidates of science. Ten of his disciples became doctors of sciences (Soviet doctorate): V.V. Anisimov (Corresponding Member of the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences) and professors V. L. Girko, Yu. V. Kozachenko, O. I. Klesov, M. M. Leonenko, Yu. D. Popov, D. S. Sil'vestrov, N. M. Zinchenko, M. P. Moklyachuk, and A.B. Kachyns'kyi. Yadrenko was a skilled teacher. His lectures were characterized by mathematical rigorousness, high scientific level, and clarity of presentation. Many Ukrainian experts in probability theory and mathematical statistics learned these branches of mathematics at his lectures. Yadrenko was the author of 24 textbooks on different branches of mathematics, including Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics ()Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics, (Yadrenko, I. I. Gikhman and A. V. Skorokhod) Vyshcha Shkola, Kiev (1988) and an unparalleled book of problems in probability theory (written together with A. V. Skorokhod, A. Ya. Dorogovtsev, and D. S. Sil’vestrov), the English version of which was published in 1997 in the United States. In 1995, for the first time in Ukraine, Yadrenko began to deliver lectures on actuarial mathematics and the theory of insurance risk. Together with his disciples M. M. Leonenko, Yu. S. Mishura, and V. M. Parkhomenko, Yadrenko published the first Ukrainian textbook on econometrics and contemporary financial and actuarial mathematics. Yadrenko is one of the initiators of the introduction of the new mathematical study program \\"Statistics\\" in Ukraine. From 1997 to 2001, he headed the Statistical Aspects of Economics global international project within the framework of the TEMPUS-TACIS program of the European Community. He also made tremendous contributions to the training of talented young mathematicians. For more than 40 years, he was an organizer of mathematical circles for scholars and school mathematical competitions at different levels. Since 1970, Yadrenko headed the jury of All-Ukrainian mathematical competitions for schoolchildren and students. He also headed the All-Ukrainian correspondence competitions in physics and mathematics, and for many years he delivered TV lectures on mathematics for schoolchildren. In addition, Yadrenko was the Vice-President of the Ukrainian Mathematical Society, a member of the bureau of the Department of Mathematics at the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences, the Editor-in-Chief of the Applied Statistics Actuarial and Financial Mathematics () scientific journal, a deputy editor of the Theory of Probability and Mathematical Statistics () journal, and a member of the Editorial Board of the Random Operators and Stochastic Equations international journal. For his scientific and pedagogical activities, Yadrenko was awarded numerous medals. In particular, he was awarded the State Prize of Ukraine (2004).

Largely relegated to airborne duty by the constraints of jungled terrain, FACs began operations as early as 1962. Using makeshift propeller-driven aircraft and inadequate radio nets, they became so essential to air operations that the overall need for FACs would not be completely satisfied until 1969. The FAC's expertise as an air strike controller also made him an intelligence source, munitions expert, communication specialist, and above all, the on-scene commander of the strike forces and the start of any subsequent combat search and rescue if necessary. Present as advisors under Farm Gate, FACs grew even more important as American troops poured into Vietnam after the Tonkin Gulf Incident. The U.S. Air Force (USAF) would swell its FAC complement to as many as 668 FACs in Vietnam by 1968; there were also FACs from the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and allied nations. For the early years of the war USAF manning levels were at about 70% of need; they finally reached 100% in December 1969. The FACs would be essential participants in close air support in South Vietnam, interdiction efforts against the Ho Chi Minh Trail, supporting a guerrilla war on the Plain of Jars in Laos, and probing home defenses in North Vietnam. As the war came to center on the Trail in 1969, the FAC role began to be marginalized. Anti-aircraft (AAA) defenses became steadily more aggressive and threatening along the Trail as the bombing of North Vietnam closed down. The communist enemy moved their supply activities to nighttime, quite literally leaving the FACs in the dark. The American response was twofold. They used fixed-wing gunships with electronic sensors to detect communist trucks, and onboard weaponry to destroy them. They also began putting FACs in jet aircraft and in flareships as a counter to the AAA threat. At about the same time, emplaced ground sensors began to complement and overshadow FAC reconnaissance as an intelligence source. FAC guidance of munitions also began to come into play in 1970. By the time the Vietnam War ended in 1975, the U.S. and its allies had dropped about six times as many tons of bombs as had been dropped in the entirety of World War II. A considerable proportion of this tonnage had been directed by forward air controllers. Operating environment =Terrain= The Forward Air Controller (FAC) fulfilled many duties during the Second Indochina War. In addition to the usual close air support strike missions to aid South Vietnamese ground forces in their struggle against insurgents backed by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, he might direct combat search and rescue operations or air interdiction strikes on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Other FAC duties included escort of supply truck convoys, or involvement in covert operations. The FAC also advised ground commanders on usage of air power, and trained indigenous personnel in forward air control. Most of all, he flew the core mission of visual reconnaissance, seeking information on the enemy.Churchill, p. xvi. The airborne FAC flew the Cessna O-1 Bird Dog or other light aircraft slowly over the rough terrain at low altitude to maintain constant aerial surveillance. By patrolling the same area constantly, the FACs grew very familiar with the terrain, and they learned to detect any changes that could indicate enemy forces hiding below. The rugged jungle terrain of South East Asia easily hid enemy troop movements. However, the FAC looked for tracks on the ground, dust settling in foliage, roiled water in streams--all signs of furtive enemy movement. Both unexpected campfire plumes and rows of fresh vegetables growing near water in \\"uninhabited\\" areas were also tip-offs to communist camps. However, decoy camps were not unknown; ofttimes fires were kept underground, with the smoke plumes being redirected through a laterally extended chimney. The communist insurgents were proficient in both camouflage and disguise. Camouflage extended down to individual soldiers using green branches to garnish backpacks. As part of disguise, the insurgents would sometimes dress as civilians, even going so far as to dress as monks or as women carrying small children. Despite these evasions, by 1968 FAC visual recon had largely suppressed daytime communist activities.Churchill, pp. 15 - 16. Flying low and slow over enemy forces was very dangerous for the FACs; however the enemy usually held his fire to avoid discovery. However, when the enemy opened fire, it might hit him with anything from rifle bullets to 37mm antiaircraft cannon. A low pass for post-strike bomb damage assessment was another hazardous duty.Churchill, p. 24. American ground FACs began to supply on-the-job training to South Vietnamese counterparts in Tactical Air Control Parties, in an effort to improve poor performance by the local FACs. However, rough terrain, limited sight lines, and difficulty in communication always seriously hindered ground FAC efforts in Southeast Asia.Walton, p. 31 =FAC aircraft= A wide variety of aircraft were used in the forward air control role. Propeller-driven O-1A over Vietnam. Common propeller-driven FAC aircraft were: * Cessna O-1 Bird Dog: This two-seater served as the original FAC aircraft. Slow, unarmed and unarmored, its small size limited its payload and it did not have instrumentation for night operations. Although it carried three radios for air strike coordination--Frequency Modulation, High Frequency, and Very High Frequency--only one radio channel was available at a time.Walton, p. 37Churchill, pp. 15 - 16, 28. O-2A fires smoke markers at a target. * Cessna O-2 Skymaster: 510 were modified for military service. A businessman's aircraft, it was adapted for interim use by FACs, to replace the O-1. It was a faster airplane, with two engines in a tractor/pusher arrangement, four hard points for ordnance, and a seven-hour linger time. Its side by side seating limited the pilot's line of vision to the right and to the rear.Churchill, pp. 50 - 53. A USAF OV-10A firing a white phosphorus smoke rocket to mark a ground target * OV-10 Bronco: The first American airplane designed for FAC work; entered combat service on 6 July 1968. With double an O-1's speed, excellent all-around sight lines for observation, an armored cockpit, and an avionics suite that included eight secure radios along with the flight instruments, the OV-10's five ordnance hard points made it a potent combination of FAC and light strike aircraft.Churchill, pp. 57 - 58.Walton, pp. 41 - 42 By 1972, the Bronco was responsible for laser illuminating targets for about 60% of the \\"smart bombs\\" dropped in Vietnam.Churchill, p. 61. Other propeller-driven aircraft were also used as FAC aircraft, usually in an interim, ad hoc, or specialized role: * Cessna U-17 Skywagon * North American T-28 Trojan * A-26 Invader * A-1 Skyraider * OV-1 Mohawk * Fairchild AC-119 * C-123 Provider: Call sign \\"Candlestick\\" * C-130 Hercules: Call sign \\"Blindbat\\"Churchill, pp. 63 - 65. * Douglas RC-47PChurchill, p. 25. * C-7 CaribouChurchill, p. 80. Fast FAC jet Jet aircraft were also used for FAC duties: * Grumman F-9 Cougar: Used by U.S. Marine Corps as original Fast FAC experimentChurchill, pp. 134 - 135. * F-100 Super Sabre: Call sign \\"Misty\\" * McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II: Call signs \\"Stormy\\", \\"Wolf\\", \\"Night Owl\\", \\"Whiplash/Laredo\\"Churchill, pp. 64 - 65. * Martin B-57 Canberra =Rules of engagement= The Rules of Engagement (ROE) placed restrictions on the use and direction of air strikes. In 1961, when American pilots and South Vietnamese FACs began to fly combat missions together, the first ROE was established. The original requirement was that only the Vietnamese FACs could drop ordnance because all air strikes required the approval of the South Vietnamese government. Also, aircraft could return fire if fired upon, in what was dubbed \\"armed reconnaissance\\".Churchill, pp. 13 - 14.Walton, pp. 27 - 28 On 25 January 1963, the ROE were updated to establish some free-fire zones containing only enemy troops; permission was not needed to place an air strike there. The requirement for Vietnamese approval was also waived for night missions supporting troops in contact, so long as they were supported by a Douglas C-47 flareship. By 1964, the ROEs had changed to allow U.S. Army aircraft to observe from as low as 50 feet, while the USAF and VNAF were held to a 500-foot minimum. As the war evolved, so did the ROE; they became complex. Different branches of the military service--U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Navy--flew under differing rules. For instance, the requirement for a Vietnamese FAC on-board was waived for U.S. Army FACs. On 9 March 1965, U.S. air was cleared to strike in South Vietnam with airplanes stationed in-country; however, Thailand-based bombers were forbidden to hit South Vietnamese targets.Churchill, p. 28. The Rules changed according to the location of the action and force involved. Only USAF FACs could support U.S. Army ground forces in South Vietnam, unless the Army was operating in a free fire zone. And while the military approved air strikes in Vietnam, approval of any target in Laos depended on the American ambassador.Churchill, p. 11. Common to all iterations of the ROE was insistence on aligning strike runs so ordnance was dropped or fired headed away from friendly troops and innocent civilians, and toward the enemy troops. Extraordinary circumstances might find a FAC constrained to direct a drop parallel to friendly lines. Only in dire emergencies would the FAC decree approve strikes in a direction toward friendly forces. The ROE were also clear that, no matter how junior in rank the FAC, he was in complete control of the air strike. Inattentive or disobedient pilots were sometimes told to carry their bombs back to base.Churchill, pp. 18 - 20, 23 - 24. There is anecdotal evidence that \\"friendly fire\\" incidents were reported all the way to the U.S. President. An outstanding example of FAC salvation of the civilian populace occurred on 8 February 1968. Several hundred refugees moving on Route 9 from Khe Sanh to Lang Vei were spared an artillery barrage when Captain Charles Rushforth identified them as a non-military target.Churchill, p. 76. Staff personnel tested the FACs on the Rules on a monthly basis. The FAC might have to master more than one set of the ROEs. The complexity of the Rules, and the aggravation of conforming with them, were a prime recruiter for the Raven FACs working undercover in Laos.Robbins, pp. 21 - 30.Rowley (1975), pp. 164 - 168. =System= In many cases, the forward air control system began with the forward air controller being pre-briefed on a target. He then planned his attack mission. In other cases, an immediate air request came in requiring a rapid response; the FAC might have to divert from a pre-briefed target. In any case, the FAC would rendezvous with the strike aircraft, preferably out of view of the targeted enemy. Once permission to strike was verified, the FAC marked the target, usually with a smoke rocket. Once the strike aircraft identified the marked target, they were directed by the FAC. Once the strike was complete, the FAC would make a bomb damage assessment and report it.Anthony, pp. 67 - 74.Rowley (1972), pp. 59 - 71. The FAC was the most important link in any one of the air control systems; in any of them he served as a hub for the strike effort. He was in radio contact not just with the strike aircraft; he also talked to the Airborne Command and Control Center coordinating airstrike availability, to ground forces, and to the headquarters approving the strike. He was supported by Tactical Air Control Parties co- located with ground forces' headquarters ranging down to the regimental, brigade, or battalion level. However, the multiplicity of systems, their equipment shortages, and the inexperience of participants, all handicapped the FAC in the Vietnam War. In summary, whether airborne or ground bound, a FAC's expertise as an air strike controller made him an intelligence source, munitions expert, communication specialist, and above all, the on-scene commander of the strike forces and the start of any subsequent combat search and rescue if necessary. Operations There were four focal points of anti- communist air operations during the Second Indochina War. Only two of these four focal points were located in Vietnam. =South Vietnam= Before the Tonkin Gulf Incident The U.S. Air Force had shut down FAC operations after the Korean War, in 1956. In 1961 it revived the doctrine and sent five fighter pilots as FACs to Bien Hoa Air Base in the Farm Gate contingent to advise and train the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (VNAF) in directing air strikes from O-1 Bird Dogs.Churchill, p. 12. In the process, the USAF reinvented both forward air control and the Air Commandos. The reinvention was complicated by the language and cultural difficulties between Americans and Vietnamese, the clash between the two country's differing FAC procedures, and South Vietnamese policies toward FACs.Rowley (1972), pp. 14 - 21. Inadequate radios and a clash of four differing communications procedures--U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and the VNAF--would plague attempts to standardize a forward air control system. Although all users agreed that strike aircraft should be diverted from preplanned missions to supply close air support, the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, and the Vietnamese military each followed different new complex communication procedures for the redirection.Rowley (1972), pp. 63, 66, 82. The U.S. Air Force believed in a centralized top-down control system. The U.S. Army opted for a decentralized one. The Vietnamese had a more complex centralized system, and trusted only a very few senior officers and officials to approve strikes. The U.S. Special Forces sometimes was forced to circumvent any system because of dire emergencies.Rowley (1972), pp. 62, 64, 66, 72 - 84. The Marines continued their organic system of Marine fliers supporting Marine infantry.Lester, p. 7. Combat Controllers in Vietnam featured on the cover of a 1968 issue of Airman Magazine. The FACS' situation was aggravated by shortages and maldistribution of the most basic supplies. A 1957 inter-service agreement laid supply responsibility for U.S. Air Force FAC efforts to support the U.S. Army on the Army. The latter owned the O-1 Bird Dogs; both the USAF and the VNAF depended on transfers of the aircraft to them. Both radio jeeps and ordinary vehicles were in short supply. Supplies all around were scanty, and the logistics system was a nightmare. With the Army doing such a poor job of supply, the USAF assumed the responsibility, but logistics problems would dog the FACs until war's end.Rowley (1972), pp. 37 - 43. In December, 1961, the Tactical Air Control System set up as part of the Farm Gate effort began handling air offensive operations, including airborne forward air control. On 8 December 1961, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff granted the newly re- established 1st Air Commando Group authority to strike communist insurgents. On 8 February 1962, the Air Operations Center for Vietnam was set up at Tan Son Nhut on the outskirts of Saigon; it would be the command and control network for forward air control.Walton, P. 29 In April 1962, a USAF study concluded only 32 American FACs were required for Vietnam service; by the time the last of the 32 had been assigned a year later, they were obviously insufficient.Rowley (1972), p. 26. On 14 April 1962, the VNAF began training Forward Air Guides (FAGs) as ground personnel to aid airborne FACs. By 1 July 1962, 240 FAGs had been trained, but were authorized to direct air strikes only in an emergency. The FAGs were often misassigned upon return to duty, and seldom used in practice. The FAG training program dwindled away.Rowley (1972), pp. 21 - 24. At the same time, the Americans tried to \\"sell\\" the concept of a FAC stationed as an Air Liaison Officer at each Vietnamese headquarters as an advisor on air power.Rowley (1972), pp. 25 - 27. Flareship operation At night, the communist guerrillas would attack detachments of Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) troops in isolated hamlets. The Farm Gate air commandos improvised a night FAC procedure, using a C-47 to drop flares, with T-28s or A-26 Invaders dive bombing under the flares. The Viet Cong fled these strikes. Eventually, it took only the first flare for the communists to break off an assault.Anthony, pp. 6 - 11. In 1962, elements of Marine Observation Squadron 2 landed at Soc Trang to join the forward air control effort. The squadron would later transition from the O-1 to UH-1 Huey helicopters.Walton, p. 47 It was also in 1962 that the communists began to attack convoys moving supplies within South Vietnam. A program of shadowing truck convoys with FAC O-1s began; no escorted resupply column was ambushed during early 1963. As the war escalated, the Vietnamese military needed more FACs than could be trained. The U.S. Air Force responded by activating the 19th Tactical Air Support Squadron (19th TASS) at Bien Hoa Air Base on 17 June 1963. Despite chronic shortages of aircraft, vehicles, and radios, the 19th TASS would persevere into combat readiness. However, their effectiveness was constrained by the fact that the Vietnamese FACs were subject to prosecution for any \\"friendly fire\\" incidents. The U.S. Army's 73d Aviation Company also began FAC duties at this time; they were somewhat more successful than the 19th TASS because the Army allowed surveillance from a lower altitude than the USAF.Rowley (1972), pp. 30, 37 - 48. After the Tonkin Gulf Incident After the Gulf of Tonkin incident served as the American casus belli in August 1964, the United States began to add large numbers of ground troops needing air support in South Vietnam. As of January, 1965, there were only 144 USAF airborne FACs to support them; 76 of these were assigned as advisers. There were also 68 VNAF FACs, but only 38 aircraft, in the four Vietnamese liaison squadrons. Yet the Rules of Engagement mandated a forward air controller direct all air strikes in South Vietnam.Rowley (1972), p. 34.Walton, p. 36Lester, p. 114. At this juncture, the overloaded air control mission began to metastasize in response to events. On 7 February 1965, Viet Cong guerrillas attacked Pleiku Air Base. On 2 March, the U.S. retaliated by beginning a campaign, Operation Rolling Thunder, to bomb North Vietnam. To streamline operations, the American FACs were relieved of the necessity of carrying Vietnamese observers to validate targets on 9 March. The Operation Steel Tiger interdiction campaign against the Ho Chi Minh Trail and the Demilitarized Zone was started on 3 April 1965. In September 1965, the USAF's 12th Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) landed in Vietnam to begin management of the FAC force. TACPs were slated to be assigned one per maneuver battalion, one per brigade headquarters, and four per divisional headquarters.Churchill, pp. 28 - 29. Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff General Earle G. Wheeler visited South Vietnam in the midst of all this, in March 1965. He saw a need for more FACs. Immediately after his return stateside, the JCS authorized three more Tactical Air Support Squadrons in June 1965.Rowley (1975), p. 6. In the midst of this buildup in number of FACs, the first Airborne Command and Control Center was launched to serve as a relay between TACP and the FAC pilots.Project CHECO ABCCC Report, p. 2. Retrieved 20 September 2015. ABCCC would become the inflight nerve center of the Vietnam air war. It not only kept track of all other aircraft, it served \\"to assure proper execution of the fragged missions and to act as, a central control agency in diversion of the strike force to secondary and lucrative targets.\\" ABCCC would expand into a twenty-four-hour-per-day program directing all air activity in the war.Project CHECO ABCCC Report, p. 11. Retrieved 20 September 2015. By early 1965, the USAF had realized that TACAN radar was a near- necessity for bombing operations, due to the lack of reliable maps and other navigation aids. As a result, Combat Skyspot radars were emplaced throughout South Vietnam and elsewhere in Southeast Asia.Mahnken, p. 97. By October, 1965, the U. S. Air Force realized it still had an insufficient number of FACs. Although the Rules of Engagement were changed to lessen the workload on the FAC force, the USAF continued short of trained Forward Air Controllers until the U. S. drawdown of troops lessened demand. By April 1966, five Tactical Air Support Squadrons had filled out the Air Force combat units of the 504th Tactical Air Support Group. The squadrons were based thus: * 19th Tactical Air Support Squadron: Bien Hoa Air Base, Republic of Vietnam (RVN) * 20th Tactical Air Support Squadron: Da Nang Air Base, RVN * 21st Tactical Air Support Squadron: Pleiku Air Base, RVN * 22d Tactical Air Support Squadron: Binh Thuy Air Base, RVN * 23d Tactical Air Support Squadron: Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base, Kingdom of Thailand The 504th Group served mostly for logistics, maintenance, and administrative functions. It comprised only 250 O-1 Bird Dog FACs for all South Vietnam.Churchill, p. 36. The FACs were supposed to be assigned two per maneuver battalion. However, the FACs were actually assigned to ground force brigades and lived and worked with the battalions on active operations.Walton, pp. 44 - 45 As of September 1966, in the wake of establishing the 23d TASS, the FAC effort was still short 245 O-1 Bird Dogs, with no suitable alternatives.Rowley (1975), p. 34. From December 1965 onwards, close air support for the U.S. Navy's riverine forces in the Mekong Delta came from carrier aviation. On 3 January 1969, the U. S. Navy raised its own forward air control squadron, Light Attack Squadron 4, using OV-10 Broncos borrowed from the Marine Corps. VAL-4 was stationed at Binh Thuy and Vung Tau, and would fly 21,000 combat sorties before its disbandment on 10 April 1972. Those sorties would be a mix of light strike missions and forward air control. The 220th Reconnaissance Airplane Company, under operation control of 3rd MARDIV in I Corps, was the only Army company officially authorized to direct air strikes. Due to the Marine pilots of VMO-6 being overstretched by the intensity of combat operations in the DMZ, pilots of the 220th were, uniquely, given the Marine designation of Tactical Air Coordinator (Airborne). As airborne controllers, they were formally approved to run air strikes in addition to directing artillery and Naval gunfire.Hooper, p. 2. The Royal Australian Air Force sent 36 experienced and well-trained FACs to serve in Vietnam, either attached to USAF units or with No. 9 Squadron RAAF. Vice Air Marshal (retired) Graham Neil, \\"RAAF Forward Air Controllers\\", Royal Australian Air Force Association website. Accessed 8 August 2015. One of them, Flight Lieutenant Garry Cooper (see Further reading section below), served with such distinction he was recommended for the Medal of Honor by Major General Julian Ewell.Churchill, pp. 20 - 21. The Royal New Zealand Air Force placed 15 of its FACs under U. S. command during the war., Author unknown, \\"Unit notes - Vietnam Veterans Roll\\". Ministry for Culture and Heritage, updated 8 April 2014. By 1968, there were 668 Air Force FACs in country, scattered at 70 forward operating locations throughout South Vietnam.Walton, p. 48 By November, a minimum of 736 FACs were deemed necessary for directing the air war, but only 612 were available.Lester, p. 118. The USAF was scanting and diluting the requirement that all FACs be qualified fighter pilots by this time, in its effort to supply the demand.Harrison, pp. 47 - 53. FAC manning levels from 1965 through 1968 averaged only about 70% of projected need.Rowley (1975), p. 10. By this time, the cessation of enemy daytime activities in areas surveilled by FACs, as the communists changed to night operations, would lead to a shift to night FAC operations by some O-2s. One hundred percent manning of the FAC requirement effort would finally come in December, 1969, via lessened demand for the mission.Lester, pp. 114 -116, 119. The Mekong Delta and the Cambodian incursion Following preliminary trial against the Ho Chi Minh Trail, Operation Shed Light A-1 Skyraiders fitted with low-light- level television were tested in night operations over the Mekong Delta. Flying at 2,000 to 2,500 feet altitude, the A-1s found enemy targets on 83% of their sorties, and launched attacks in about half these sightings. The A-1s took more hits over the Delta than they had over the Trail, and the television did not work as well as expected. By the time the test was over on 1 December 1968, the USAF had decided to further develop the sensor. The cameras were stripped from the test A-1s, and the aircraft forwarded to the 56th Special Operations Wing.Anthony, pp. 121 - 122. However, the low-light-level television would be further developed as part of a sensor package installed in Martin B-57 Canberra bombers.Anthony, pp. 127 - 132. The communists used Cambodia as a sanctuary for their troops, flanking the South Vietnamese effort and venturing across the border into South Vietnam's Mekong Delta for operations and retreating into \\"neutral\\" territory to escape counterattacks. On 20 April 1970, the Cambodian government asked the U.S. for help with the problem of the border sanctuaries. On 30 April, the U.S. and South Vietnam sent ground forces into Cambodia to destroy communist supplies and sanctuaries. They were supported by a huge air campaign. Four Tactical Air Support Squadrons were committed to the effort--the 19th, 20th, 22d, and 23d. To handle such a massive effort, a TACP was committed, relaying its instructions to FACs through a central airborne FAC dubbed \\"Head Beagle\\". When he proved unequal to handling the volume of incoming air support, a Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star was assigned to the task in December 1970. Although American ground forces withdrew from Cambodia by 1 July, the air interdiction campaign continued. A detachment of the 19th TASS, the French-speaking \\"Rustic\\" FACs, remained to patrol in support of Cambodian troops.Churchill, pp. 85 -86, 90. The American FACs would covertly support the Cambodian non- communists by directing massive U. S. air strikes until 15 August 1973.Walton, p. 54. =North Vietnam= The U.S. military considered the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and the southern portion of North Vietnam as an extension of the South Vietnamese battleground. In 1966, the U.S. used FACs from the 20th TASS, flying O-1 Bird Dogs and later O-2 Skymasters, to direct air strikes in the Route Pack 1 portion of Rolling Thunder.Churchill, p. 67. Contained within Route Pack 1, Tally Ho took in the southern end of the Route Pack plus the DMZ. By August 1966, communist anti-aircraft fire made eastern half of Tally Ho too hazardous for the O-1s.Schlight, pp. 1 - 2. As ground fire made the Tally Ho mission increasingly hazardous for the slow prop planes, the Marines pioneered Fast FACs in Vietnam, using two-seated F9F Panther jets in this area, as well on deep targets on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The Marine Fast FACs also adjusted naval gunfire when they were north of the DMZ. There were also pioneering efforts by \\"Misty\\" Fast FACs.Rowley (1975), pp. 173 - 188. The greatest effect Rolling Thunder had on FAC usage was its demise. President Johnson halted bombing above 20 degrees north longitude in North Vietnam on 1 April 1968. On 1 November 1968, he entirely ended the bombing of North Vietnam, closing Operation Rolling Thunder.Summers, Karnow, p. 96. These halts would cause a drastic redirection of American air power toward the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos.LaFeber, p. 63. =Laos= The basis for military operations in Laos were radically different from that in Vietnam. Laotian neutrality had been established by the international treaty of the 1954 Geneva Agreement which prohibited any foreign military except a small French military mission.Castle, pp. 11 - 15. In December 1961, General Phoumi Nosavan seized control of the Kingdom of Laos in the Battle of Vientiane.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 37 - 43. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) backed his rise to power and established themselves and their Thai mercenaries as the prime advisers to the Lao armed forces.Warner, pp. 32 - 33. On 29 May 1961, because there could be no military advisory group in Laos, U.S. President John F. Kennedy granted the Ambassador control of all American paramilitary activities within that country.Castle, pp. 54 - 55. Thus it was that the CIA gained charge of the ground war in Laos. They contracted out aerial supply missions in the country to the civilian pilots of the CIA's captive airline, Air America.Castle, p. 43. U.S. Air Force FACs would be secretively imported by the ambassador to control air strikes under his supervision.Rowley (1975), p. 164. The initial use of forward air control in northern Laos was a sub rosa effort by both airborne and ground FACs during 19–29 July 1964 for Operation Triangle.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 111 - 112.Anthony, Sexton, p. 125. Heartened by this experience, the USAF initially used enlisted Combat Controllers garbed as civilians, with the call sign \\"Butterfly\\", to direct air strikes from civilian aircraft flown by Air America. After General William Momyer cancelled the \\"Butterfly\\" assignment, the Raven forward air control unit was created on 5 May 1966 for service in Laos as a successor to the Butterfly program. The U.S. Air Force's Project 404 began an organized FAC effort at the request of Ambassador William H. Sullivan. These Raven FACs were stationed throughout Laos. Two of their Air Operations Centers were in northern Laos, at Luang Prabang and Long Tieng. Two more AOCs edged the Ho Chi Minh Trail, at Pakxe and Savannakhet. A fifth AOC was at Vientiane. Project 404 accepted veteran FACs in the Vietnam theater who volunteered for the Raven FAC assignment; they tended to be warriors frustrated with bureaucracy and Byzantine Rules of Engagement.Robbins, pp. 7 - 9. Few in number, flying in civilian clothing in unmarked O-1 Bird Dogs or U-17s, the Ravens often faced overwhelming tasks. In one instance, a FAC flew 14 combat hours in a single day. In another, a FAC directed 1,000 air strikes in 280 combat hours within a month. Upon occasion, queues of up to six fighter-bomber flights awaited target marking by a Raven.Robbins, pp. 61, 88 - 89, 94 - 95. By 1969, 60% of all tactical air strikes flown in Southeast Asia were expended in Laos.Robbins, pp. 188 - 190. The ranks of the Ravens were greatly augmented to handle this stepped-up air offensive, though they never exceeded 22.Robbins, p. 64. Working as a Raven FAC was an exhausting, high- risk, high-stress job. By war's end, there had been 161 Butterflies and Ravens directing air strikes in Laos; 24 were lost in action. The overall casualty rate ran about 50%. By the end of his tour, Raven Craig Duehring calculated that 90% of their planes had been hit by ground fire at some point, and 60% had been downed.Robbins, pp. 335 - 336. Nor were the Ravens the only FACs working in Laos. By mid 1969, about 91 FAC sorties per day were launched into Laos, about a third of them jet FACs.Schlight, p. 35. Northern Laos An O-2A over Laos, 1970. The Raven FACs were stationed throughout Laos. Two of their Air Operations Centers (AOCs) were in northern Laos, at Luang Prabang and Long Tieng. Two more AOCs edged the Ho Chi Minh Trail, at Pakxe and Savannakhet. A fifth AOC was located at Vientiane. Simultaneously, beginning in March 1966, TACAN units began to be emplaced within Laos.Anthony, pp. 203 - 205. Lima Site 85 was sited on Phou Pha Thi, Laos, in the Annamese Cordillera with its beamed pointing over the nearby border at Hanoi. It would be overrun in March 1968.Anthony, Sexton, pp. 182 - 184. Unlike the other bombing campaigns in Southeast Asia, the northern Laotian bombing campaigns within Barrel Roll would support a guerrilla force in action.Anthony, Sexton, p. 271. U.S. Air Force and Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) tactical air sorties directed by forward air controllers cleared the way for CIA-sponsored guerrillas commanded by General Vang Pao in their battle for the Plain of Jars. Among these campaigns were Operation Pigfat,Conboy, Morrison, p. 201. Operation Raindance,Conboy, Morrison, p. 210. Operation Off Balance,Anthony, Sexton, pp. 304 - 306. and Operation About Face.Ahern, pp. 326 - 327. Joining the Ravens in this endeavor were the \\"Tiger\\" Fast FACs.Rowley (1975), pp. 193 - 194. Ho Chi Minh Trail =In the beginning= The Ho Chi Minh Trail-- Vietnamese name Trường Sơn trail--consisted of a network of roads and transshipment points concealed by the jungle. It would eventually develop into an intricate system of over 3,000 miles of interweaving roadways, trails, and truck parks running down the eastern edge of the Vietnamese/Laotian border. Although located in Laos, the materiel shipped along the Trail supplied the communist troops in South Vietnam. Associated with it were other roads running through Dien Bien Phu to Xam Neua and further into northern Laos. FAC reconnaissance patrols over the Ho Chi Minh Trail in southern Laos began in May 1964,Churchill, pp. 11, 27 - 29. even as the Trail network began massive expansion. It became apparent that victory for the North Vietnamese war effort depended on keeping the Trail open.Nalty, pp. 5 - 6. As noted above, the Operation Steel Tiger interdiction campaign began 3 April 1965. The communist counter to daytime air strikes was a switch to night movement of supplies.Lester, p. 178. O-1 Bird Dogs were originally tried for night FAC operations to interdict those shipments. Inadequate instrumentation and a small load of target markers so handicapped it that other aircraft came into use in the role.Churchill, p. 52. In July 1966, A-26 Invaders using the call sign \\"Nimrod\\" began night operations against the Ho Chi Minh Trail with support from multi-engine flareships.Churchill, p. 70. Though principally a strike aircraft, it served as a FAC on occasion.Anthony, p. 100. Also in 1966, the U.S. Air Force began experimenting with various night vision devices for FAC use, under the code name Operation Shed Light.Anthony, pp. 115 - 118. =Advent of sensor intelligence= The Starlight Scope became a key tool for night FAC operations. Originally it was tried mounted in the 0-2 Skymaster. By late 1966, the scope was being used for FACing along the southern Ho Chi Minh Trail from C-130 Hercules flareships under the call sign \\"Blind Bat\\". These FACs worked in conjunction with 0-2s; after \\"Blind Bat\\" illuminated an area with a flare, the 0-2 would mark the actual target. Strike aircraft were variously T-28 Trojans, A-1 Skyraiders, A-26 Invaders, or later in the war--A-37 Dragonflies or F-4 Phantoms. C-123 Providers of the 606th Special Operations Squadron, under the call sign \\"Candlestick\\", filled a similar role over the northern end of the Trail.Anthony, pp. 134 - 137. From September to December 1967, a prototype AC-130 gunship tested various detection sensors' ability to locate trucks. The new gunship mounted improved night vision capabilities, an infrared detection unit, an array of radars, and a searchlight. The latter could be filtered to produce infrared or ultraviolet beams, as well as ordinary light. An ignition detector would be added later, to pinpoint the running engines of supply trucks.Nalty, pp. 54 - 55. Testing of the sensors later incorporated into the Igloo White military intelligence system began in December 1967. At that time, FAC reconnaissance found five to ten times as many trucks as the prior December; as many as 250 trucks were spotted in single convoys, risking air strikes by running with lights on. However, the Battle of Khe Sanh sidetracked sensor usage from the Ho Chi Minh Trail to track the communists besieging the U.S. Marines in the embattled fire base. This distraction undercut a full testing of \\"people sensors\\"; as a result, the USAF favored the tested sensors, which detected trucks.Nalty, pp. 13, 18 - 22. In January 1968, four A-1 Skyraiders modified to carry two low- light-level television cameras were assigned to Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Base. By February, they were flying test missions into Steel Tiger to direct strikes against trucks on the Trail. However, proper testing depended on flying a straight level course while not exposed to ground fire. The Ho Chi Minh Trail offered little chance of that. The sensor test was moved to South Vietnam.Anthony, pp. 115 - 121. =The war on trucks= On 1 November 1968, President Lyndon Baines Johnson declared a halt to bombing in North Vietnam, thus suspending Operation Rolling Thunder. Immediately, with North Vietnamese targets off limits, the air power directed at the Ho Chi Minh Trail nearly quintupled, rising from 140 to 620 sorties per day. Operation Commando Hunt would concentrate on destroying so many communist supply trucks that the insurgency in the south would collapse from lack of supplies. Communist anti- aircraft weaponry, freed from defense duties by the bombing halt, also moved south to the Trail. At November 1968's end, U.S. intelligence estimated there were 166 anti-aircraft guns defending the Trail. Five months later, by the end of April 1969, 621 anti-aircraft guns had been reported. Although no fire control radar was detected, the optically aimed weaponry was still a potent force. Some few 57mm guns could reach an aircraft at 12,500 feet altitude. Over half of the guns sited along the Trail were 37mm cannons, which could range up to 8,200 feet altitude. Dual mounted 23mm guns constituted most of the other artillery; they had a range of 5,000 feet. Underlying the anti- aircraft artillery, a plethora of machine guns fired at lower level fliers. Compounding the FAC's difficulties, the communists had more prepared sites than antiaircraft guns, and could quickly shift guns from one site to another. They also set up decoy sites of dummy guns.Nalty, pp. 98 - 99. By mid-1969, American strike pilots noted increased effectiveness in antiaircraft defense due to the influx of experienced gunners.Anthony, p. 140. By the end of 1969, the growing hazards of enemy anti-aircraft fire caused the withdrawal of the \\"Candlesticks\\" from the Trail.Rowley (1975), p. 159. In early 1970, the Paveway system came into action; it required the FAC use of a laser designator to guide so-called \\"smart bombs\\". Differing designators were mounted on both AC-130 Blindbats and F-4 Phantoms; both were used successfully.Anthony, pp.147 - 148. In June 1970, the era of flareship FACs ended, as the \\"Blindbats\\" were withdrawn. The Martin B-57 Canberras of Operation Tropic Moon superseded them. However, the B-57 had its success limited by its high fuel consumption and substandard sensors.Nalty, pp. 156, 236. The fixed-wing gunships working the Trail became the principal truck busters in Operation Commando Hunt. The AC-119s would prove marginal in performance, and too vulnerable to ground fire to continue campaigning against trucks on the Trail.Nalty, pp. 57 - 58, 236. However, the AC-130 would become the American's premier weapon against supply convoys.Nalty, p. 236. =Campaign results= Between November 1970 and May 1971, the 12 AC-130 Spectres of the 16th Special Operations Squadron (SOS) were credited with destroying 10,319 enemy trucks and damaging 2,733 others. When these spectacular results were added to those of other units interdicting the Trail, it became apparent that if the damage assessments were correct, the North Vietnamese were out of usable trucks. Continuing steady traffic on the Trail mocked that assumption.Zeybel, October 1995, \\"Night Spectre Haunts the Ho Chi Minh Trail\\", Vietnam, pp. 38 - 45. At the time, the 16th SOS had developed its own damage assessment criteria, given that visual observation of strike results was infrequent. According to the 16th: * A vehicle that exploded and/or caught on fire was considered destroyed; * A vehicle hit by a 40mm shell was considered destroyed; * If a 40mm shell exploded within 10 feet of a vehicle, it was reported damaged; * A vehicle hit by 20mm fire was considered damaged. According to Vietnam Magazine, on 12 May 1971, these criteria were tested with a staged firepower demonstration by an AC-130, directed against eight targeted trucks on a bombing range near Bien Hoa AB. By applying the criteria, these eight test targets would have been reported as five destroyed, three damaged. In actuality, a ground check proved only two trucks destroyed. Five more trucks were operable after repair. One that would have been reported destroyed under the criteria was still drivable. Unexploded 20mm shells littered the ground, surrounding the trucks. As a result of this test, the damage criteria were changed to report only exploding or burning trucks as destroyed. Notable Forward Air Controllers * Steven L. Bennett: Medal of Honor recipient * Hilliard A. Wilbanks: Medal of Honor recipient * Craig W. Duehring: Assistant Secretary of the Air Force in later years * George Everette \\"Bud\\" Day: Medal of Honor recipient Legacy By the time Igloo White ended, it had cost in excess of two billion dollars in equipment costs, excluding the cost of lost aircraft. Operating expenses doubled that. Despite the expense, Igloo White's emphasis on interdicting supply trucks instead of enemy troops failed to deter continuing communist offensives in South Vietnam.Nalty, pp. 282 - 283, 299 - 301. The Vietnam War saw about 13 million tons of bombs dropped by the U.S. and its allies. This was approximately six times the tonnage dropped during World War II. However, unlike World War II, there was no mass dumping of ordnance on cities full of civilians. Instead, in close air support--and in many interdiction situations --forward air controllers were charged with following stringent Rules of Engagement in directing air strikes.Dunnigan, Nofi, pp. 107, 131. The expertise went to little avail. When Raven FAC Greg Wilson called The Pentagon for a post-Laos assignment as a fighter pilot, he was told, \\"We're trying to purge the Vietnam FAC experience from the fighter corps because we have moved into an era of air combat where the low-threat, low speed, close air support you did in Southeast Asia is no longer valid. And we don't want these habits or these memories in our fighter force.\\"Robbins, p. 411. This was symbolic of what was to come. Once again the United States Air Force abandoned forward air control at the war's end,Lester, p. 194. just as it had following World War IIGooderson, p. 26. and after the Korean War.Churchill,p. 9.

She was confirmed by John Jackson, bishop of Lincoln on 22 March 1863, at Walkeringham. A few weeks previously the Edward Twells, newly consecrated bishop of the Orange River Mission (as the Bloemfontein Mission was then called), visited the Walkeringham Vicarage, where Mr. Stockdale, Henrietta and a cousin of hers met with him. The young Henrietta's missionary enthusiasm was fired by this meeting, and she and her cousin were both made Associates of the Bloemfontein Mission. > \\"From that time, when she was only fifteen, until her death nearly fifty > years afterwards, she gave her prayers, her thoughts, her time, and finally > herself to the Bloemfontein Mission, and died in its cause.\\"  Going to South Africa  In 1870 Bishop Allan Becher Webb was made Bishop of Bloemfontein, and before he went out he visited Bole to see Henrietta. A year later the Revd Mr Bevan from the Orange River Mission visited the family and was instrumental in having Herietta's brother go out to the mission at Modderpoort. She followed in due course, responding to a call by Webb for teachers and nurses. Miss Stockdale received some months’ training as a nurse at the Clewer Hospital and at the Great Ormond Street Hospital for children. She sailed for South Africa, with other volunteers and in the company of Archdeacon and Mrs Croghan, on 6 March 1874, the same day on which she had, eleven years before, been made an Associate of the Orange River Mission. Landing at Port Elizabeth, the party travelled up to Bloemfontein, where they founded the Community of St Michael and All Angels. When Miss Stockdale was admitted to full membership of the order, about 1875, she took her vows and was henceforth known as Sister Henrietta.  Kimberley and the establishment of Southern Africa's first training school for nurses  Sister Henrietta first went across to Kimberley in the winter of 1876, working as district nurse in the mining camps, and then at Kimberley's new Carnarvon Hospital. She returned to England to recover from typhoid contracted at this time, taking the opportunity to train further at London's University College Hospital. It was on her going back to Kimberley that she established Southern Africa's first training school for nurses at the Carnarvon Hospital. \\"Inspired and guided by her\\", wrote Dr Charlotte Searle, \\"Kimberley nurses moved out to wherever they were needed, establishing hospitals, starting nurses' training schools, and providing nursing care.\\" Sister Henrietta spent a year as Matron at the St George's Hospital in Bloemfontein (1877), but then returned to Kimberley. In 1880-1881, during the First Boer War, she took charge of the military hospital at Newcastle, Colony of Natal.  State Registration of Nurses  Sister Henrietta registered with the British Trained Nurses’ Association in 1890 (she held certificate No 15), and maintained contact with its founder, Mrs Bedford Fenwick, who was an early advocate of State registration of nurses. In South Africa Sister Henrietta persuaded influential figures, notably Dr William Guybon Atherstone of Grahamstown, to back legislation providing for registration of nurses and midwives. This was achieved through the Cape Colony's Medical and Pharmacy Act of 1891. The Carnarvon and Diggers' Hospitals combined to become the Kimberley Hospital in 1892. Subsidised by the Cape Government, it was enlarged and attracted doctors such as Leander Starr Jameson and John Mackenzie, who took part in the training of nurses. The Community of St Michael and All Angels withdrew from Kimberley Hospital in 1895, whereafter Sister Henrietta established a maternity nursing home and nursing co-operative at St Michael's Home.  Death  Sister Henrietta died in Kimberley on 6 October 1911, aged 64, and was buried at the Dutoitspan Cemetery.  Commemoration  = Windows, statues and grave site = A stained glass window at St Cyprian's Cathedral, installed in the nave soon after her death, was given in memory of Sr Henrietta. In 1970 a statue by Jack Penn, reputedly one of the only statues of a nun, was erected in the cathedral grounds and unveiled by Bishop Philip Wheeldon. A bust, based on the same statue, is situated in the north transept of the Anglican Cathedral in Bloemfontein, where the Community of St Michael and All Angels was founded. In 1984 the remains of Sister Henrietta, and of two fellow workers also originally buried at Dutoitspan Cemetery, were reinterred at St Cyprian's Cathedral. The graves (with the later addition of the reinterred remains of Archdeacon Lawson) are within a commemorative garden, alongside the statue.A Cathedral Pilgrimage - brochure on the history of St Cyprian's Cathedral, Kimberley, 2010 The grave of Sister Henrietta and her fellow workers at St Cyprian's Cathedral, Kimberley = Annual commemorations and centenary = Over a number of years, Sister Henriettta has come to be remembered annually in Kimberley. The St Cyprian's Guild at the cathedral, in association with the Historical Society of Kimberley and the Northern Cape, organised services led by cathedral clergy and choir at the Sister Henrietta Stockdale Chapel (at the hospital), on 6 October each year. The anniversary of her death is fixed in the calendar of saints of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa, which also provides a collect for Sister Henrietta CSM & AA.Lectionary for An Anglican Prayer Book 1989, The Anglican Church of Southern Africa The centenary of her death in 2011 was marked with a Health and Wellness Day on the lawns at St Cyprian's Cathedral and a Thanksgiving Mass in the cathedral at which Bishop Oswald Swartz presided and preached.Diamond Fields Advertiser, 6 October 2011. In the spirit of Sister Henrietta's vision, and with links thus rekindled with health and medical services in the city, the cathedral promotes and co-ordinates this new pattern of commemoration through health screening, education and career guidance, combined with a symbolic element of thanksgiving and wreath-laying.Sister Henrietta Stockdale Annual Health Day, 2013 = Institutions and awards = The Henrietta Stockdale Training College for nurses in Kimberley was named in recognition of this pioneer nurse who initiated training courses for nurses at Kimberley Hospital and was instrumental in obtaining state registration for nurses and midwives in the Cape Colony in 1891. It had been through her work that South Africa became the first country in the world to legally recognise nursing education, approve nursing schools and provide statutory curricula and examinations for nurses. The South African Nursing Association established a prize, the Henrietta Stockdale Floating Trophy at the University of the Witwatersrand, which is awarded to students achieving the highest level of professional maturity during the four year nursing degree at the university. = Sister Henrietta Stockdale Chapel = The Kimberley Hospital Chapel, built in her time at the hospital (with a dedication to St Michael), was declared a provincial heritage site in 1963 (now a Provincial Heritage Site) and is known as the \\"Sister Henrietta Stockdale Chapel\\".\\"Sister Henrietta Stockdale – recalled on the centenary of her death\\", Now and Then: Newsletter of the Historical Society of Kimberley and the Northern Cape, October 2011 In 1887 Sister Henrietta had proposed that the Sisterhood's existing oratory should be converted into four bedrooms, owing to the demand for extra wards as well as extra accommodation for nurses. She then sought public subscription and mining company support for the building of a new Chapel and purchase of an organ, plans being approved by 5 July 1887. By St Michael's Day, 29 September that same year, the new chapel had been completed and was furnished and ready for its dedication. Furnishings include stained glass windows depicting St Michael the Archangel, and the Angels Gabriel, Uriel and others. Initially the property of the Anglican Church, open for use by any denomination, it was deemed from 1947 to be property of the Kimberley Hospital. Memorial plaques within the chapel were erected in memory of nursing members and associates of the Community of St Michael and All Angels as well as nursing and medical staff of the Kimberley Hospital spanning the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  Assessment  Dr Charlotte Searle has described Sister Henrietta as a \\"remarkable woman, who laid the foundation of professional nursing and modern hospital organisation in Southern Africa ... [she] was regarded as a saint by some, and as a keen business woman politician by others. She had a fearless approach to the political questions of the day, and never hesitated to enlist the aid of a Royal Princess when she felt that nursing and the care of the sick were threatened.\\" Assessing her impact after a hundred years, in October 2011, the Dean of Kimberley, the Very Revd Simon Aiken, said that \\"Sister Henrietta's legacy is the living, active, ongoing delivery of healthcare to ordinary people, most especially the marginalised who might not have access to such opportunities.\\"  References  Category:1847 births Category:1911 deaths Category:19th-century Christian nuns Category:20th- century Christian nuns Category:Anglican nuns Category:Anglican saints Category:Disease-related deaths in South Africa Category:English Anglicans Category:English nurses Category:Members of Anglican religious orders Category:People from Gringley-on-the-Hill Category:People from Kimberley, Northern Cape ","title":"Henrietta Stockdale"},{"id":"23108938","text":"Chiconquiaco is a municipality in Veracruz, Mexico.

Ross, (July 7, 1945 – May 1, 1985) was an American teacher, lawyer, and government official who was famous for his celebrity as a child prodigy and television game show contestant. Ross's game show winnings, totaling $164,000 (), were for two months in the spring of 1957 the highest ever earned on a United States television game show. Early years Ross was born to Pauline Ross on July 7, 1945. Ross was known as a prodigy and a genius. At age seven, he gained national attention by passing a federal examination for a ham radio operator's license. At ten, he became known as the whiz kid who won $100,000 on The Big Surprise, a television quiz show. Many of the questions he correctly answered concerned the stock market. As a prize, he became the first guest to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange. At eleven, on February 10, 1957, Ross won $64,000 on The $64,000 Challenge. This total made Ross the highest winner of game show prize money for two months, until passed by another child contestant, Robert Strom, on April 16. At 14, Ross was graduated from high school and immediately matriculated at Reed College. In his senior year, he transferred to the University of California at Los Angeles to be closer to his family. At 18 years of age, in 1963, Ross entered Yale Law School. While there, he was editor-in-chief of the Yale Law Journal. He began seeing a psychoanalyst to manage his neurotic tendencies. He graduated at 20, and went on to study at Yale's graduate school of economics for three years. Reports conflict on whether he graduated or if he failed to write his doctoral dissertation. Career Ross was awarded a teaching fellowship at Harvard in the early 1970s. He then went on to teach at Columbia Law School. He also became involved in politics and held positions of public service. After resigning from Columbia University, Ross joined the California gubernatorial campaign of Edmund Gerald Brown Jr., (Jerry Brown), becoming a part of the \\"issues and ideas staff\\". Later, he would aid in creating Mr. Brown's first budget. In 1975, Ross accepted an appointment to the California Public Utilities Commission under California Governor Jerry Brown, making him one of the youngest members of the commission. The appointment was to last six years, but Ross resigned after just two. He then went on to serve President Jimmy Carter in the State Department. There, he worked as an advisor to a former professor at Yale, Richard Cooper, who was the under-secretary for economic affairs. Ross resigned from this position after one year and slipped into a deep depression. In 1978, while in Boston, Ross was awarded a foundation grant to do a monograph on nuclear proliferation. Upset about a failed romance, Ross attempted suicide and was admitted McLean Hospital, a private psychiatric clinic outside Boston. Upon his release, he moved back to California and joined the faculty at Boalt Hall, the University of California law school on the Berkeley campus. He resigned from the faculty in 1984 following a brief stay in the hospital after students found him under his car, rehearsing his lecture, in the parking lot of the school. He then went on to work for a small law firm in San Francisco, where he was to be the \\"idea man\\" with no strenuous legal work, but the deterioration of his mind made concentrating an impossible task. During his career, Ross tended to co-author books and articles with partners who would see the work through to completion—a task which was near impossible for Ross with his racing mind. He co-wrote a book about students' legal rights during the Vietnam War draft called The Lottery and the Draft: Where Do I Stand?. With Peter Passell, a fellow professor at Columbia University, Ross co-wrote \\"Retreat from Riches: Affluence and Its Enemies\\" about a national policy of rapid growth being the only way to reduce poverty in America. In April 1972, Ross co-authored a strenuous attack on the newly published book, The Limits to Growth, in the New York Times. In total, Ross co-wrote or wrote three books on economics, articles for the New York Review of Books and The New York Times, and a popular compendium of the best of everything from pizzas to police precincts called The Best.  Death  Ross's life unraveled as his mood swings and impatience with himself and the world became uncontrollable. Ross was aware his mental state was deteriorating and aggressively sought out physical solutions for his mental ailments. Convinced his emotional problems had a physical cause, Ross spent a considerable amount of time in medical libraries researching new and unorthodox treatments to cure himself. Among the treatments he tried were elaborate drug regimes, shock treatments, and brain surgery. The surgery, a cingulotomy, was performed at Massachusetts General Hospital and consisted of snipping a circuit in the limbic system. The surgery failed to alleviate his depression. Those around Ross attempted to intervene and help. His friends lent him money and tried to find him jobs that were better suited for his mental state. In April 1985, Ross moved in with his brother, Daniel, accepting Daniel's and his mother's help. On May 1, 1985, at 39 years old, Ross committed suicide in the pool of Capri Motel in Santa Clara, California. After his death, a psychiatrist who had treated Ross remarked, \\"the early fame and brilliant success of his youth ruined him. Being a child prodigy is an enormously powerful event that disrupts normal development.\\" Ross never married and left no children. He is remembered as a \\"true genius, a sweet, likable and generous man.\\" References External links * Ross, in his own words: Television Interview with Mike Wallace 1957 Category:1945 births Category:1985 deaths Category:Contestants on American game shows Category:University of California, Los Angeles alumni Category:Yale University alumni Category:Harvard University faculty Category:Columbia University faculty ","title":"Leonard Ross"},{"id":"23108944","text":"Connected Living is a Quincy, Massachusetts-based provider of social networking services to senior citizens.

He was Scientific Director of the U.S. Naval Observatory from 1963 to 1977. He specialized in astrometry, especially work on double stars and stellar distances. Life Kaj Strand was born February 27, 1907 in Hellerup, Denmark, on the outskirts of Copenhagen. He entered the University of Copenhagen in 1926, majored in astronomy, and graduated in 1931 with Magister (Master's) and Candidate Magister degrees. At the invitation of Ejnar Hertzsprung, during the 1930s he worked at Leiden on a program of photographing double stars; he applied these results toward his doctorate from Copenhagen in 1938. From 1938-42 Strand worked under Peter van de Kamp as a Research Associate at Swarthmore College, and began the photographic double star program with the refractor telescope at the college's Sproul Observatory. During World War II he entered the U.S. Army, and then the U.S. Army Air Force, and flew as a Captain and chief navigator on B-29 Superfortress tests. As head of the Navigation Department he was involved in operational training of special air crews, including the first atomic bomb crew. After the war Strand returned briefly to Swarthmore College, and in 1946 began as an associate professor at Yerkes Observatory. In the same year he became chairman of the Astronomy Department at Northwestern University, and was responsible for planning the University's new computer center. In 1958 Strand accepted a position as head of the Astrometry and Astrophysics Division at the U.S. Naval Observatory rising to the position of Scientific Director in 1963. He pioneered in the determination of stellar distances using reflecting telescopes, and was primarily responsible for the design and construction of the Strand Astrometric Telescope, dedicated in 1964 at the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station in Arizona. Claim of extrasolar planets Strand is also known for his 1942 and 1957 claims of a planetary system around the nearby star 61 Cygni while working under the direction of Peter van de Kamp at the Sproul Observatory. These claims were later refuted by Wulff Heintz, also of the Sproul Observatory.

In 1962, Moon won The Associated Electrical Industries Prize for Sculpture, a competition that was judged by his friend Phillip King, the British sculptor. At this time he was living and working in Chepstow Road, West London and had his first solo show at the nascent Rowan Gallery in Knightsbridge. (The painter Bryan Young had recommended Moon's work to the gallery's owner Alec Gregory-Hood). Moon also married Elizabeth Bryant and started teaching part-time at St Martin's School of Art and Chelsea School of Art within the same year. In 1964 they moved to a 2-bedroom flat in Swiss Cottage and Moon used one room as a studio. Son Robert was born that year. In 1966 they bought a house in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey and during the following year Moon built a large studio in the back garden, taking a lead from John Hoyland who had moved to Kingston and built a studio shortly beforehand. (Painters Bernard Cohen and John Edwards also followed suit). Second son Benedick was born at home in 1966. The first works completed in the new Kingston studio in 1967 were the Y-shaped paintings. Daughter Georgina was born at home in 1970. Jeremy Moon became a leading figure in British art during the 1960s and 1970s. His work was abstract and geometric in form. His early paintings until 1964 used oil on canvas, switching then to the new acrylic paints. He generally applied paint in a flat and unmodulated way using masking tape to delineate clear areas of colour. He was an early exponent of the shaped canvas and also produced a small number of 3D and relief works. Reoccurring motifs and elements within his paintings included grid-like forms composed of vertical, horizontal or diagonal lines. Drawing was a central part of his practice and he used pencil, pen and pastels incessantly on A4 letter- writing paper to develop ideas for works. His peers included John Hoyland, Bridget Riley, Ian Stephenson, Bernard Cohen, Patrick Caulfield, Phillip King and Anthony Caro. During Moon's lifetime he had solo shows at The Rowan Gallery yearly between 1963 and 1973 except for 1964. His work is held in the collections of Tate, The Arts Council, The British Council, The British Museum, The Victoria & Albert Museum, The Government Art Collection, National Museums Scotland, National Museums of Northern Ireland, Manchester City Art Gallery, Southampton City Art Gallery, The Fitzwilliam Museum, The Cecil Higgins Museum & Art Gallery, The University of Warwick, The Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Portugal, The Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, The Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney, Australia, The RISD Museum, Providence RI USA, The Walker Art Center, Minneapolis USA. Corporate collections include British Airways and Daimler Chrysler, Stuttgart, Germany. Death and legacy Moon died aged 39 following a motorcycle accident at Robin Hood roundabout on the A3 whilst commuting back from Chelsea to Kingston on 30 November 1973. Since his death, his work has continued to be shown widely. The Serpentine Gallery in London held a retrospective of his work in 1976. There was also a retrospective in 2000 that toured to Harris Museum - Preston, Bow Arts - London, Graves Art Gallery - Sheffield and Kettles Yard - Cambridge. His studio, archive and estate remain in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey. Jeremy Moon is represented by Luhring Augustine.

Description This is a perennial herb forming a small cushiony mat covered in oval leaves up to about centimeter long. The greenish leaves are coated in woolly fibers in shades of brown to pink or white. The inflorescence arises on an erect scape, or stem, bearing a head of small flowers which are white to pink with a darker midrib. Distribution It is endemic to California, where it can be found in the Transverse Ranges, the Sierra Nevada foothills, and in the case of one variety, the high Sierra Nevada and far western Great Basin. It grows in dry habitat in sand or gravel. Species There are five varieties of this species: *E. k. var. alpigenum, the southern alpine buckwheat, grows in subalpine to alpine areas in the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains, including San Gorgonio Mountain. *E. k. var. austromontanum, the southern mountain buckwheat, grows in mountain habitat in the Transverse Ranges, including the pebble plain near Big Bear. It is a federally listed endangered subspecies. *E. k. var. kennedyi is known from the eastern San Bernardino Mountains and from the Mount Pinos area *E. k. var. pinocola, the Kern buckwheat, is known from only three occurrences in the mountains at the southernmost tip of the Sierra Nevada where it meets the Transverse Ranges near Tehachapi. *E. k. var. purpusii can be found in several mountains and ranges in southern and eastern California. Some varieties serve as foodplants for butterfly species such as Bauer's dotted blue (Euphilotes baueri) and Ord Mountain metalmark (Apodemia mormo dialeuca).Flora of North America Profile References External links *Jepson Manual Treatment of Eriogonum kennedyi *The Nature Conservancy *UC Photo gallery − Eriogonum kennedyi kennedyi Category:Endemic flora of California Category:Flora of the California desert regions Category:Flora of the Sierra Nevada (U.S.) Category:Natural history of the California chaparral and woodlands Category:Natural history of the Mojave Desert Category:Natural history of the Transverse Ranges ~ ~ ","title":"Eriogonum kennedyi"},{"id":"23109144","text":"Herman Fishman (March 7, 1917 - December 14, 1967) was an American basketball and baseball player and the founder of the sports camp, Camp Michigama.

Elpinice (, Flourished c. 450 BC ancient Greece) was a noble woman of classical Athens. She was the daughter of Miltiades, tyrant of the Greek colonies on the Thracian Chersonese, and half sister of Cimon, an important Athenian political figure. She is known from Plutarch's life of Pericles where she appears twice in political confrontations with the Athenian statesman. Greek law allowed marriage between a brother and sister if they had different mothers. Some accounts say that Elpinice was for a time married to her brother, but was later given as a bride to Callias, one of the richest men in Athens, who had fallen in love with her. Callias had made marriage to Elpinice the condition for paying, on Cimon's behalf, the fine which had been imposed upon their father Miltiades and for which Cimon had inherited responsibility. When Cimon was charged with treason for taking bribes from Alexander I, king of Macedonia, she negotiated his acquittal with Pericles.Plut. Cim. 4, 14, Pericl . 10; Nepos, Cim. 1 Pericles rebuked Elpinice for being an outspoken woman When the people of the island of Samos revolted against Athenian rule, Pericles pursued a war against them and punished them by demolishing their city walls, confiscating their ships and forcing them to pay a large fine. Rather than celebrate the victory Elpinice was a lone voice who pointed out that it was won over Athens' own people rather that against her true foreign enemies such as the Phoenicians or Medes. Pericles rebuked her with the words \\"As an old woman you should not anoint yourself with oils.\\" This dismissed the seriousness of her charge and at the same time implied women's only power lay in their sexuality. She was a lover to the artist Polygnotus of Thasos who used her features in his work depicting the Trojan woman Laodice. At her death she was buried with members of her own family by birth and not her husbands. This suggests a continuing closeness and loyalty with her brother.

He served in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1920 to 1925. he had previously and later again served on the Webster Parish Police Jury. During the Great Depression, he became involved in the Georgist movement and published an article about its single tax proposal. Colbert also served from 1944 to 1946 as the mayor of the small city of Minden, the seat of government of Webster Parish in northwestern Louisiana. He later worked in real estate. Background Colbert was born in Webster Parish in 1882 to John A. Colbert and his third wife, the former Sarah Eliza Taylor. The senior Colbert was from 1892 to 1896 the Webster Parish clerk of court, an elected position.Respect for the Past; Confidence in the Future: Webster Parish Centennial, 1871-1971, Webster Parish Police Jury, pp. 14-16 Colbert attended local schools. For higher education, he attended Louisiana Tech University in Ruston. He was editor of the defunct The Minden Democrat newspaper and another former publication, The Signal-Tribune, considered the forerunner of the current Minden Press-Herald. Political career In 1908, Colbert and city council member Connell Fort co-managed the successful gubernatorial campaign in Webster Parish of Jared Y. Sanders Sr.. The candidate was from Franklin in St. Mary Parish in south Louisiana. After Sanders was elected, he appointed Fort as the conservation agent for northwestern Louisiana. Later Fort was elected and served as mayor of Minden, the parish seat of Webster.\\"Connell Fort Dies Saturday Night at His Residence Here: Was Great Civic Worker and Builder of This City,\\" Webster Signal-Tribune, March 5, 1937, pp. 1, 6 From 1912 to 1920 and 1936 to 1940, Colbert was elected from former Ward 4 as a member of the elected Webster Parish Police Jury. This governing body is similar to a county commission in other states. Colbert was elected to the state legislature in 1920 and 1924. He resigned during his second term when Governor Henry Fuqua appointed him to the Louisiana Tax Commission, a position that he continued under governors Oramel H. Simpson and Huey P. Long Jr. Colbert served as chairman of the Minden Democratic Executive Committee, the panel that handled the filings of candidacy. For a time, he was the chief aide to U.S. Representative John N.

After three centuries of religious use by various congregations, the chapel—which had been Brighton's first Nonconformist place of worship—passed into secular use in 1988 when it was converted into a pub. It was redesigned in 1825, at the height of Brighton's Georgian building boom, by at least one of the members of the Wilds–Busby architectural partnership, Brighton's pre-eminent designers and builders of the era, but may retain some 17th-century parts. It has been listed at Grade II in view of its architectural importance. History Although evidence of Neolithic settlement has been found in the area now occupied by the city, Brighton started to develop as a fishing village in the 12th century. Fishermen's houses were clustered together below the cliffs on the English Channel coast, a parish church (St Nicholas' Church) was built on higher ground to the northwest, and development gradually spread to the land immediately above the cliffs. By the 17th century, four streets named after the cardinal directions formed the boundaries of the village. Until that time, St Nicholas' Church was the only place of worship in Brighton. Nationally, only the Church of England was recognised as legitimate. Various Acts of Parliament proscribed Roman Catholic and Nonconformist worship: in particular, the Conventicle Act 1664 prevented groups of non-Anglican Christians meeting for worship. By about 1660, however, a Nonconformist community had developed sufficiently to be able to found a school. A religious census carried out in 1676 found 260 Nonconformists, 8% of the village's population of 3,340. As restrictions on their religious practices eased, a chapel was built; this was initially used by Presbyterians. It was built in the heart of the old village on a street which was later named Union Street in reference to the chapel. Sources disagree on the date of its founding and construction. Many identify 1683, others prefer 1698, and 1688 has also been put forward as the date of construction or the date the land was sold to the Presbyterian community. A foundation stone still exists in the south wall, but its date has been identified as either 1683 or 1688. The east wall, in a traditional Sussex style with cobbled stones, flints and red brick dressings In its early years, the chapel was used exclusively by Presbyterians; but its first permanent minister—Reverend John Duke, who was in charge between 1698 and 1745—allowed Independent Christian ministers to hold services there as well. The name \\"Union Chapel\\" was adopted to reflect the coming together of the different denominations. The name \\"Union Street Chapel\\" was also used occasionally after the street took that name. In around 1800, a house was constructed next to the chapel for the incumbent minister to live in, and burials began to be made in the former yard area behind the building. About ten years later, the chapel was extended; the east wall, built of cobbled stones and flints with red-brick dressings in a style found frequently in Sussex, may date from that redevelopment, although other sources state it may have been part of the original 17th-century structure. Brighton grew rapidly, from its original fishing village status to a fashionable town and seaside resort, from the second half of the 18th century, helped by royal patronage, local doctor Richard Russell's advocacy of sea-bathing and seawater-drinking as a cure for various ailments, and improved transport connections to London and other places. By the early 19th century, demand for new buildings—especially in the fashionable Regency style—was very high, and a group of three builders and architects, who worked together and separately at different times, became the most significant contributors to Brighton's building stock of the period. Amon Wilds and his son Amon Henry Wilds, together with Charles Busby, were responsible for developments such as Kemp Town, the Brunswick estate, Regency Square, the Royal Albion Hotel and various churches. The Union Chapel was completely redesigned in 1825 in a Classical style with Greek Revival and Egyptian Revival elements, and at least one member of the group was responsible; but there is disagreement over their respective contributions. Most sources identify Amon Wilds as being solely responsible; others name Charles Busby on his own, in collaboration with Amon Henry Wilds, or even together with Amon Wilds senior. Research by English Heritage in 1992 suggested that ascribing the work to Amon Wilds senior was a mistake; that the design was created by Charles Busby in 1825 when he was still in partnership with Amon Henry Wilds; that both men signed it; and that after the partnership was split up later in 1825, Wilds took responsibility for the work. Memorial tablet to Henry Varley, a preacher during the Glynn Vivian Miners' Mission era At the time of the reconstruction, the chapel was still in use by both Presbyterians and Independents, but by 1838 it was used solely by the latter. This development came during the 37-year incumbency of Reverend John Nelson Goulty, who became the minister in 1824. Some interior remodelling was carried out in 1875, and a new minister—Reverend Reginald Campbell—reinvigorated the chapel's fortunes at the end of the 19th century after a period of stagnation. Around the same time, another Nonconfirmist chapel in Brighton—the Queen Square Congregational Church, founded in 1853—was experiencing falling congregations, and sought a merger with the Union Chapel, whose ecclesiastical practices were compatible. The churches merged in around 1898; Reverend Campbell was the minister. The name \\"Union Church\\" was adopted. In 1905, the congregation moved permanently to the larger church on Queen Square, after a period in which both buildings were used, and Union Chapel was sold and became an Evangelical mission hall—the Glynn Vivian Miners' Mission. It was sponsored by Richard Glynn Vivian, a Welsh industrialist. He was converted to Evangelical Christianity while staying in Brighton after suddenly losing his sight, and devoted the rest of his life to improving the working and spiritual lives of miners in Britain and elsewhere. The Union Chapel was the base for this work from 1905 until 1927 or 1931, when the Elim Pentecostal Church bought it. It became known as the Elim Free Church or the Elim Tabernacle of the Four Square Gospel, and internal alterations removed almost all the interior fittings from the 1825 reconstruction. In September 1988, the Elim congregation left the building and it was put up for sale again, with the expectation that it would become a restaurant or pub—ending 300 years of religious worship on the site. The building was acquired by the Firkin Brewery, a pub chain established in 1979 which was experiencing significant growth by the early 1990s. They named it the \\"Font & Firkin\\", and installed a microbrewery on site. Architecture H. Wilds, Architect\\" The building is a dominant presence on the north side of Union Street, now a very narrow pedestrianised passage in the heart of The Lanes, the series of passageways lined with old buildings which formed the centre of the ancient village. The tall, wide, stuccoed façade, facing south, is in the Greek Revival style, with Doric pilasters, a triglyph and a large pediment—in keeping with many of the Wilds–Busby partnership's Regency era buildings in Brighton; but the two doorways and three windows are tapered from bottom to top, a feature associated with Egyptian Revival architecture. The roof is partly gabled. The east wall, facing Meeting House Lane, pre-dates the 1825 work on the main façade; it consists of cobbled stonework and flints in a regular pattern, with red-brick dressings at the corners and around the arch-headed sash windows on the ground floor and the larger rectangular first-floor sash windows. The interior has been changed since the building entered commercial use. There had been a gallery around three sides, reached by a pair of staircases from immediately inside the doorways. The gallery was held up by a series of cast iron columns with decorative capitals, and was the only 19th-century feature to survive during the Elim congregation's occupancy. The pulpit had stood in the centre of three arches in the north wall. Pews were arranged in a semicircle facing it. The building today After the Elim congregation vacated the building, it was converted into a large pub, the Font & Firkin—part of the former Firkin Brewery chain. This was later disestablished, all of its pubs were sold and all in-pub brewing was stopped; the Font & Firkin was the last ex-Firkin pub in Britain to stop, in 2003. The pub is still open and now trading as simply The Font. The building was listed at Grade II on 20 August 1971. It is one of 1,124 Grade II-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove.

Since TangoVia Buenos Aires understands tango as a constantly evolving living art form, it promotes all of its formats as contemporary and alive. Goals The organization's main goal is the development and implementation of educational and preservation projects linked to tango, especially the recovery of original sheet music, recordings, films and all other historical material related to the genre. TangoVia Buenos Aires also produces festivals, concert seasons, books and educational tools, documentaries and CDs. Teaching Activities Since its inception, TangoVia Buenos Aires has worked with the Orquesta Escuela de Tango Emilio Balcarce (“Emilio Balcarce” Tango Orchestra School), created by artistic director Ignacio Varchausky and directed today by the prestigious maestro Néstor Marconi. The award-winning documentaryhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isfUmNsOZhY “Si Sos Brujo: A Tango Story”http://www.woodstockfilmfestival.com/festival2006/details.php?id=15132 — directed by Caroline W. Neal and co-produced by TangoVia Buenos Aires — traces the birth and development of this pedagogical programme based on oral transmission, thanks to which young musicians learn the orchestral styles of tango, its language and secrets, directly from great musicians who played in the orchestras of the 1940s and 1950s and remain active today. Digital Tango Archive Officially presented on 17 June 2009, the Digital Tango Archive is TangoVia's exhaustive and almost archaeological effort to recover lost materials relating to the history of tango recordings. Unique in the worldhttp://www.pagina12.com.ar/imprimir/diario/suplementos/radar/9-5351-2009-06-09.html \\\\- the Digital Tango Archive already houses over 700 original arrangements for the tango orchestra (orquesta típica) and more than 600 for bandoneon solos. Through the digitalisation of high quality recordings, high resolution digital scanning of photographs, scores, musical arrangements and the correct transcription of video archives, a security copy is being created of the enormous amount of existing material. Its classification according to multiple criteria enables this material, once reserved to a few scholars, to be offered to everyone for free consultation. In Argentina there are at least one hundred thousand tango recordings made between 1902 and 1995 (end of the analogical era). However, less than 20% of this material is available on CD. There are already three thousand recordings that appear in catalogues, and thousands of hours of radio and TV programmes, which no longer exist in any format and have been lost forever. Artistic Productions Through a series of activities, TangoVia Buenos Aires has contributed to the promotion, preservation and first-hand enjoyment of the art of one of the most influential Argentine musicians in history: Horacio Salgán. One example is the artistic production of the CD “Raras Partituras 4” featuring Salgán’s unknown compositions and arrangements for both tango orchestra (recorded by the Gran Orquesta TangoVia Buenos Aires) and for piano solo (recorded by Andrés Linetzky). The CD was produced in collaboration with the Biblioteca Nacional de Argentina (Argentina's National Library) and was followed by the book “Arreglos para orquesta típica: Tradición e innovación en manuscritos originales” (Arrangements for a Typical Tango Orchestra: Tradition and Innovation in Original Manuscripts), co-published with the National Library and offering for the first time Salgán’s original arrangements for tango orchestra, as well as an analysis, bibliography and catalogue of Salgán’s work. Since TangoVia Buenos Aires believes the tango tradition continually reinvents itself, it produces new recordings and festivals every year, featuring today’s most notable artists in contemporary tango. Since 2003 TangoVia Buenos Aires has been the artistic producer of the Buenos Aires Tango Festival in Paris, in conjunction with the National Theater Palais Chaillot; 2008 marked the fourth edition of this festival. Other productions include the Festival Montpellier Danse 03, the Festival Buenos Aires Tango in the Auditorium Parco della Musica in Rome in both 2006 and 2008, and the Festival TangoVia Buenos Aires in both Genoa, Italy and Lille, France in 2005. In the field of CD production, TangoVia Buenos Aires has launched two series. One of them is \\"El arte del bandoneón\\" (The Art of the Bandoneon). This series intends to create and preserve a kind of musical memory: a unique register of the most outstanding contemporary bandoneon players, recorded intimately playing solos on the bandoneon. The series began with the CD “Instantaneas” by Julio Pane and continued in 2008 with the CDs “Tiempo Esperado” by Néstor Marconi, “Mi Fueye Querido” by Leopoldo Federico, which won the 2009 Latin Grammy Award for Best Tango Album, and “Mi Refugio” by Walter Rios. The second series “El arte de la orquesta típica\\" (The Art of the Tango Orchestra) began with “Amanecer Ciudadano” featuring an orchestra directed by the renowned bandoneonist Víctor Lavallén. Support TangoVia Buenos Aires is supported by numerous public and private institutions, both in Argentina and abroad, including The Government of the City of Buenos Aires, la Sociedad Argentina de Autores y Compositores de Música (SADAIC), la Asociación Argentina de Intérpretes Musicales (AADI), Universidad Nacional de Quilmes, Biblioteca Nacional de la Republica Argentina, Instituto Nacional de Cine y Artes Audiovisuales (INCAA), Festival de Tango Buenos Aires, IICES, Jazz at Lincoln Center, CODARTS (Conservatory of Rotterdam), Sydney Youth Orchestra, Fondazione Musica per Roma and Parco della Musica, Publishing Houses Warner/Chappell Music and Epsa Publishing, and the Foundation “La Casa del Tango”.

The Cut is distributed in the US through Hulu.http://www.imediamonkey.com/2012/05/11/bbc-drama-the- cut-comes-to-hulu/ Characters =Character descriptions= Jay Kelso Jay Kelso (played by Samuell Benta) is the main protagonist of Series 1, and plays a minor role in Series 2. =Series 1= Jay grew up in care, and knows little about his family background. At the start of the series, his birth certificate is found in the pocket of a dead man, prompting lawyers in London to contact Jay. When he arrives, he is told that he is in fact the actual owner of the Loxley's cafe, which Toni and Olive now run. Jay quickly befriends Olive and Toni, but does not tell them the real reason he is in town. His best friend Fin soon turns up and persuades Jay to find out where the cafe rent goes. They track it to the Dive Bar, where the landlord, Joey, informs them that he was friends with his grandfather, who gambled the cafe to him so that he could afford to find Jay and his mother, Carmen. They play poker to win the cafe back, and Fin manages to win the game for Jay. Soon after, Jay confesses to Toni that he owns the cafe. Later in the series he strikes up a relationship with Marla, and moves out of the Loxley's to live in a flat with Fin. After Marla discovers that he owns the cafe, she tells him that they are over and, realising that there is nothing left for him in London, Jay returns home. =Series 2= Jay is absent for most of Series 2. Marla, full of regret for how she acted, has not heard from him at all, although Toni is still sending him the cafe rent. After several months, he turns up out of the blue for Marla's 18th birthday, but quickly realises that Marla is now in a relationship with Elliott. Jay claims he is sorry for leaving her, and says that he left because his foster mother had a heart attack. Marla ultimately forgives him and leaves Elliott to be with him. However, it is revealed to the viewers that Marla's mother, Amy, is manipulating Marla to choose Jay over Elliott, in return for Jay selling her the Loxley's Café. At the end of the series, Amy announces that Jay has sold her the cafe, and Marla and Mack realise that Amy used Marla to achieve this. Marla asks Jay to leave, and he does, reluctantly. Marla Mackinnon Marla Lucy Mackinnon (played by Lara Goodison) is Jay's and later Elliott's love interest, and Stephen's sister. She is the main focus character of Series 3, and is arguably the most central character in all three series, as she is the only character to have appeared in all forty episodes and to have been consistently involved with storylines. =Series 1= Marla is a strong- willed, straight-talking vegan. Her attitude makes her appear very rude and stuck up, although this is partly due to frustration over being treated differently from Stephen by her parents. Although she gets mostly A and A* grades, her father Mack expects nothing of her and doesn't expect her to go to university, even though Stephen is trying to get into Oxford University. As well as being a self-harmer, it is also implied that Marla has an eating disorder, as she is often shown providing food for other people, but not eating much herself. At the start of Series 1, her mother, Amy, disappears, and Mack refuses to tell her why. She has an obvious attraction to Jay, who she meets when he saves her father's life, but finds it hard to get close to him, and remains cold to hide her feelings. Marla's determination to find her mother eventually leads Mack to admit that she is in Brighton, and she and Jay go to find her. When they find Amy, she tells Marla the real reason she left, but this is not shown onscreen. Marla is visibly affected by Amy's revelation, and tells Jay she wants to spend the night in Brighton, as she can't stand to face Mack yet. In their B&B; room, Marla admits to Jay that she is lonely and a self-harmer, and they end up kissing. In the following episode, Marla resolves to return home, and later tells Jay that Mack was having an affair with Toni. She and Jay continue to see each other, but their relationship is strained by her obsession with getting her parents back together. She finally manages to blackmail Mack into going to bring Amy home (by threatening to tell Stephen about the affair). When Amy does return, Marla is delighted, but when Amy mentions that Jay owns the cafe, she is furious that Jay did not tell her and tells him it's over. At the end of the series, Amy and Mack continue to fight, and Marla she realises her family life is not working. She goes to apologise to Jay, only to find he's left London to go home. She is left distraught. =Series 2= At the start of Series 2, Marla has heard nothing from Jay, and has started self-harming again. Amy is still living at home, despite tension between her and Mack. Despite her insecurities, she tries to move on from Jay. Her old friend Catherine turns up out of the blue, but it is not explained how they know each other. Later in the series, she meets swimming champion Elliott, and tries hard to stop people thinking she fancies him. Elliott and Marla have a love-hate relationship for a few episodes, and it becomes clear that they both fancy each other. Near to the end of Series 2, she turned eighteen and after a fun day out with Elliott, is later shocked when Jay turns up at her party. Marla initially tells Jay to leave, as she has moved on and is now with Elliott, but Jay says that he is sorry for leaving, and only didn't contact her because his foster mum had a heart attack and he was too preoccupied to think about her. Marla ultimately breaks up with Elliott and gets back with Jay. At the end of the series, Amy announces that she has bought the Loxley's café from Jay. Marla is shocked, as Jay had previously been very against selling it, and realises that her mum had used her as a bribe to win the café. She tells Jay to leave, as she does not want to be with him anymore. She later apologises to Elliott. Series 3 - In Series 3, Amy has left home again, this time for good. Marla has to cope with Stephen leaving to go to Oxford, and her American cousin, Taylor, taking his place in the Mackinnon house. Marla and Elliott are going steady, but Marla becomes pregnant. She worries how this will affect Elliott, as he is close to becoming an internationally famous swimmer, and this will hold him back. Mack pressures Marla into having an abortion, but she and Elliott decide to keep the baby. Marla leaves home and temporarily moves into the cafe, where Ryan and Ruby look after her. Elliott proposes to her and she accepts, but she is unaware that Elliott's financial situation is dire. After insisting on a huge, glamourous wedding, she eventually realises that she doesn't need so many luxury items, she just wants Elliott. Marla makes up with Mack and prepares to get married, but the series ends on a cliffhanger when Amy showed up at their wedding and interrupts them... Stephen Mackinnon Stephen Mackinnon (played by Matthew Kane) is Marla's brother and Olive's on/off boyfriend. He plays a central role in Series 1 and 2, but a much less important role in Series 3, as his character leaves to go to Oxford University. =Series 1= At the start of the series, he is at an expensive boarding school, but is suspended after punching a bully. It is revealed to the viewers that he got himself suspended on purpose so that he could see his secret girlfriend, Olive, on his 18th birthday. Olive (who is three years younger than him) has bought tickets for them to go to Paris, but Stephen has doubts about it, especially when he finds out that the tickets are one-way. It is revealed to the viewers that he has another girlfriend, Rosa, who doesn't know about Olive. As Olive and Stephen are about to leave for Paris, Rosa turns up on the platform, humiliating Olive and causing her to dump Stephen. As the series progresses, Rosa and Stephen still have a relationship, but it is clear to the viewers that he is not sure if he prefers her or Olive. When he deliberately takes Rosa to an event that Olive is going to show Olive up, they both dump Stephen and he is left alone. In later episodes, he becomes close to Fin, and after getting drunk together, they end up kissing. Near to the end of Series 1, he asks Fin out to a school party, but when he finds out that Tommy is going to ask Olive, he goes to ask her instead, which she eventually agrees to. Stephen cannot bring himself to tell Fin that he's not going with her after all, and leaves her waiting on the night of the party. He also claims to have left a necklace for Olive in the cafe, which was actually left by Tommy. Fin turns up halfway through the party and tells Olive what is really going on. Tommy and Stephen get into a fight, resulting in Stephen leaving the party alone, as all of his friends have turned against him. =Series 2= In Series 2 he joins Olive's school, Deaconsfield. Olive and Tommy are now dating, a fact for which Stephen doesn't hide his disdain. He forms an unlikely friendship with Tommy's younger brother Alex, who loathes and despises Tommy. Alex and Stephen hatch a plan to get rid of Tommy. As Tommy has previously been in trouble for using cannabis at school, Alex and Stephen plant some in his locker, leading to Tommy being expelled, and then sent to boarding school in Northern Ireland by his father. Olive is distraught, not just because Tommy has left but because she thought that he'd finished using drugs. Stephen becomes threatened by Olive's increasing friendship with Alex, and worries that Alex will tell Olive what they did. After they are accidentally abandoned on a school trip, Stephen and Olive get back together, leaving Alex on his own. Stephen thinks that Alex fancies Olive and has been torments him about it, but Alex fervently denies this. Stephen is stunned when Alex insists that it isn't Olive that he fancies, and doesn't immediately react when Alex kisses him. Stephen then punches Alex in the face, and Alex runs off. Stephen blackmails Alex into keeping quiet about his punch by threatening to tell people that he kissed him. Tommy returns and quickly puts two and two together when he notices the bruise on Alex's face and cuts on Stephen's knuckles. When Tommy confronts Stephen about hitting Alex, Stephen admits to it and says that it was because Alex kissed him. After the truth about the kiss is revealed, Alex responds by telling Olive and Tommy that Stephen had paid him to plant the drugs in Tommy's locker so that Olive and Tommy would break up. Olive dumps Stephen for the final time, saying that he was her first love but he won't be her last. At the climax of Series 2, Alex tries to kill himself by jumping off a building. Stephen, Tommy and Olive run up to the roof to try to persuade him not to jump. In desperation, Olive climbs up to save him, but ends up falling to her death herself. Series 3 - At the start of Series 3, Stephen spends some time in a mental institution to recover from the death of Olive. Whilst there, he makes friends with Jack, another patient, who makes him realise that he can move on with his own life. In Episode 3, he finally accepts his Oxford place. He reappears in the final episodes for Marla and Elliott's wedding. Olive Loxley Olive Loxley (played by Billie North) is Stephen's on/off girlfriend, and dated Tommy for a while as well. She plays a central role in Series 1 and is the main focus character in Series 2, at the end of which she is killed off. She also makes a cameo at the end of Series 3. =Series 1= Olive is portrayed as a shy romantic. She works for her older sister and legal guardian, Toni, in a café, but is secretly in a long-distance relationship with Stephen, who is three years older than her and the son of Toni's enemy. She has bought tickets to Paris, planning to run away there with Stephen when he returns from boarding school. When he returns, she tells him about Paris, but he is not as enthusiastic as her. As they are about to get on the train, Stephen's other girlfriend, Rosa, arrives, and Olive is furious with Stephen and dumps him. Over the next few episodes, she tries to avoid Stephen, but seems to be getting closer to him. About halfway through Series 1, she meets popular Tommy and bonds with him immediately, but their friendship is strained when it becomes clear that he is embarrassed to talk to her when his friends are around. Olive also becomes friends with Rosa after she dumps Stephen. Near the end of Series 1, Rosa is instrumental in persuading Tommy to ask Olive out to a school party, but Stephen asks her as well, and Olive eventually agrees to go with Stephen after he claims to have left a necklace for her at the cafe (it was actually left by Tommy). At the party, Fin turns up and tells Olive that Stephen had asked her to go before he found out that Tommy wanted to go with Olive, and Tommy tells her that he gave her the necklace. Olive leaves Stephen and goes home with Tommy. =Series 2= After Toni is attacked at the end of Series 1, Olive spends a lot of time with her in hospital, and doesn't spend much time with Tommy or her friends. Series 2 starts with the new school term. Olive and Tommy are going steady, but their relationship is strained when Stephen joins their school. Olive becomes wary of Tommy's close friendship with Rosa, and eventually Rosa tells her that she has kissed Tommy. Even though this happened before Olive and Tommy got together, Olive dumps Tommy for not telling her. While she obviously still has feelings for Tommy, this comes to nothing as drugs are found in Tommy's locker and he is expelled from school, and then sent to boarding school by his father. In the following episodes Olive becomes friends with Tommy's younger brother Alex, who she is unaware plotted with Stephen and planted the drugs in Tommy's locker to frame him. She also joins a school band as the lead singer, which causes a slight rift between her and her friend Frankie, as she wanted to do it as well. After they are both accidentally stranded on a school trip, she and Stephen get back together. In the following episodes, Olive begins to alienate everyone except Stephen. She falls out with Toni, as she finds out Toni has been having an affair with Mack. She also stops being friends with Alex, as she believes that Alex fancies her and is jealous of her relationship with Stephen, and also because he claims that Rory, their English teacher, hit him, which Olive believes Rory would never do. Tommy returns and discovers that it was actually Stephen, not Rory, who hit Alex. When Tommy confronts Stephen, he responds by saying that it was because Alex kissed him. After this is revealed, Alex tells Olive that Stephen paid him to plant the drugs in Tommy's locker. Olive tells Stephen it's over, because she knows he will never change. She also refuses to get back with Tommy, as she is happier being single. In the climax of Series 2, she reads a message on a mirror from Alex which reads \\"You don't care if I exist, So you won't care of I'm dead. Alex.\\" She realises that Alex intends to kill himself, and heads to the roof with Stephen and Tommy to try to talk him down. In desperation, she climbs right up to the edge, but is accidentally knocked off the roof herself, falling to her death. =Series 3= Olive is dead by Series 3, but appears to Frankie as a ghostly apparition in the closing scene of the final episode. Antonia 'Toni' Loxley Antonia 'Toni' Loxley (played by Jessica Dickens) is Olive's sister and legal guardian. She plays a central role in Series 1 and 2, and leaves the series in the first episode of Series 3. =Series 1= At the start of Series 1, she originally rented the café that she and Olive work in from an unknown proprietor. She cares about Olive, but is also extremely controlling over her. Toni's enemy is Mack, who is trying to evict her and Olive from the cafe - but later in the series it is revealed that she has secretly been having an affair with him. After Olive tries to run away to Paris with Stephen, she realises that she is too controlling over Olive and makes an effort to give her more space. She is also flustered when she finds out that her lodger, Jay, actually owns the cafe. At the end of Series 1, she is attacked and left for dead on the cafe floor. =Series 2= By Series 2, Toni has recovered from her attack, but is now very paranoid and initially refuses to work without Olive around, although she eventually softens a bit on this and hires Cameron and Catherine respectively. Her relationship with Mack mirrors Olive's relationship with Stephen, and she appears to be just as insecure as her sister. She has a brief relationship with Rory, Olive's English teacher who she had previously dated when she was a teenager, but he breaks things off when Olive tells him about her and Mack. At the end of the series, Mack's wife, Amy, reveals that Jay has sold the cafe to her and warns Toni that she and Olive have a day to move out. However, this is annulled when Amy leaves after Marla discovers her plan. =Series 3= In Series 3, Toni appears at Olive's funeral, and then announces that she is leaving as well. Her last request to Mack is not to sell the cafe. Daniel 'Mack' Mackinnon Daniel 'Mack' Mackinnon (played by Dermot Martin) is Stephen and Marla's father. He appears in all three series. =Series 1= He is buying up all the houses in the street as he is developing the area, but is having difficulty obtaining Toni's café, as it is not clear who owns it. Before the start of the series, his wife leaves him because of his affairs. At the end of the first episode, he is attacked by an unknown assailant late at night when returning home to join his family for Stephen's 18th birthday. Jay finds him and saves his life. As the series continues, he alienates both of his children - Marla by being unsupportive of her academic brilliance, and Stephen by disapproving of his relationship with Olive. Near the end of the series, it is revealed that he was secretly having an affair with Toni. When Marla finds out, she blackmails him, saying she will tell Stephen about the affair if Mack does not persuade Amy to come home. He manages to bring her back, but they start fighting again straight away. =Series 2= Between Series 1 and Series 2, Mack and his family move house to make a fresh start, but they remain in the same neighbourhood. He is furious with Toni for sending the police to interview his family after she was attacked. In Series 2 Mack becomes closer to Stephen, and he tells him that he has only ever loved two women - but does not tell Stephen who the other one is. Stephen later finds out about the affair after he sees Mack kissing Toni. At the end of the series, he realises that Amy has used Marla to persuade Jay to sell her the cafe and evict Olive and Toni. Mack coldly tells both Jay and Amy to leave, and says that Toni will always have a home with him. =Series 3= At the start of Series 3, he attends Olive's funeral, and honours Toni's departing wishes that he not sell the cafe, but he does rent it out to Ryan and Ruby. He also allows his niece Taylor to stay in the house when Stephen leaves home. He supports Marla's relationship with Elliott, until he finds out that Marla is pregnant and forces her out of the house when she refuses to have an abortion. He later apologises and asks to give her away at her wedding. Fin Scott Fin Scott (played by Alice Southwood) is Jay's best friend from back home. She appears only in the first series. =Series 1= When Jay decides to leave their hometown to find out about his past, Fin advises him not to run away from his problems, stating that that will not make things better. Jay leaves anyway, but promises to return. Throughout the first episodes of Series 1, Jay calls Fin to update her on what's happening to him, but it becomes clear to Fin that he is not coming home. About halfway through the first series, Fin turns up out of the blue, and it quickly becomes clear that she is interested in the money for the cafe. She persuades Jay to find out where the cafe rent goes, and wins the cafe back from Joey Horton in a poker game. Jay falls out with Fin when she annoys Marla, Olive and Toni, and forces him to tell Toni that he owns the cafe. They later become friends again. Fin has a brief romantic fling with Stephen, before being stood up by him in favor of Olive. Fin claims that she wouldn't have minded being dumped, and it is only that he was too cowardly to tell her that she cares about. At the end of Series 1, Jay leaves London, leaving Fin behind yet again. It is revealed in Series 2 that Fin followed Jay home. Thomas 'Tommy' Fitzpatrick Thomas 'Tommy' Fitzpatrick (played by Edward Green) was Olive's boyfriend for a while, and is Alex's brother. He has a semi-regular role in Series 1 and 2, and appears briefly at the start of Series 3. =Series 1= Tommy does not appear until Episode 9 of the first series, but it is mentioned that he previously dated Marla, and their relationship ended badly. He first appears putting up posters for an underage music/film/art event he's organising, including in the Loxley's café. He and Olive hit it off immediately, but she quickly realises that he will only talk to her on his own, and not when his friends are around. Rosa persuades Tommy to forget about his friends, and ask Olive to the school party. However, when he finds out that Stephen wants to take her as well, he pretends that he was only asking her to get more people to come. He leaves a necklace for Olive in the cafe, but she thinks that Stephen left it. On the night before the party, Tommy and Rosa share a spliff, and they kiss, which they both regret afterwards. At the party, Fin arrives and tells Olive that Stephen asked her first, and Tommy tells her that he in fact gave her the necklace. Stephen leaves in a temper, and Tommy and Olive go home together. =Series 2= Tommy and Olive are still together, although she does not know about his kiss with Rosa. Their relationship is strained when Stephen joins their school. Things get even more difficult when it becomes clear that Rosa is still interested in Tommy. When Tommy's brother Alex steals Rosa's phone and sends a text of confession to Olive, Tommy determines to tell her the truth. However, Rosa tells her first, causing Olive to break up with Tommy. Soon after, he is expelled from school after drugs are found in his locker (unbeknown to him, they were planted there by Alex and Stephen.) After this, his father sends him to boarding school in Northern Ireland. Tommy does not reappear until the end of Episode 12, when he turns up out of the blue only to discover that Olive and Stephen are back together. When Tommy hears that Rory Andrews has hit Alex he doesn't believe it. Tommy is informed by Elliott that Alex and Stephen have been spending a lot of time together while he has been away. When Tommy sees that Stephen has cuts on his knuckles, he confronts Stephen about hitting Alex. Stephen admits to it, and says that it was because Alex kissed him. After this is revealed, Alex tells Olive and Tommy that Stephen paid him to plant the drugs in Tommy's locker so that Olive and Tommy would break up. Olive breaks up with Stephen, but does not get back with Tommy, because he's really lovely but is more interested in beating Stephen than in being with Olive. =Series 3= In Series 3 Tommy attends Olive's funeral, then leaves after making peace with Stephen. Rosa Willis Rosa Willis (played by Scarlett Bowman) is Olive's biggest rival for male attention. She appears in all three series, but doesn't play a central role in any of them. =Series 1= She first appears as Stephen's girlfriend at boarding school, and is initially unaware about Stephen's relationship with Olive. A few weeks after Stephen's suspension, she returns home to see him, and discovers about Olive and Stephen's plan to run off to Paris. She leaves Stephen to think about what he wants from their relationship, and joins Olive at her school (her character profile on the website says that she had to leave the private school because her father lost his job as a hedge fund manager.) After going out with Stephen a few more times, she dumps him as she realises that he is only using her to make a point to Olive. She apologises to Olive about her part in Stephen's deception and they become friends. When Rosa realises Tommy's attraction to Olive, she encourages him to ask her out. It doesn't work and Olive decides to go out with Stephen instead. The night before the party, Rosa shares a spliff with Tommy and they kiss. =Series 2= In Series 2, Rosa and Olive once again become rivals, as Rosa, jealous of Olive's relationship, begins to pursue Tommy for herself. She manages to split Olive and Tommy up, but doesn't manage to acquire Tommy. After the first few episodes of Series 2, Rosa disappears from the series with no explanation, although presumably this is because none of the other characters are talking to her anymore. =Series 3= Rosa returns in Series 3 working in a clothes shop. It is revealed that she is no longer on speaking terms with Tommy, and didn't attend Olive's funeral because she felt uncomfortable. She helps Marla plan for her wedding, and kisses Noah in the final episode, suggesting that there might be something between them. Amy Mackinnon Amy Mackinnon (played by Tilly Wood) is Marla and Stephen's mother. Her biggest role is in Series 2, but she makes appearances in Series 1 and Series 3 as well. =Series 1= Amy disappears before the start of Series 1 and Marla determines to find her. Later in the series, Mack admits to Marla that Amy ran away from her family to stay in Brighton so she could forget about her problems. Marla goes to Brighton to confront Amy, and Amy tells Marla about Mack's affair with Toni. When she gets home, Marla blackmails Mack into going to Brighton to persuade Amy to come home, which he does. However, as soon as she gets back, Amy falls out with the rest of the family again. =Series 2= In Series 2, Amy is still living at home, although her relationship with Mack is still rocky. She is close to Marla, but can be quite intimidating and often puts pressure on her. When Jay returns, Amy encourages Marla to stick with Jay rather than move on to Elliott. However, it is revealed to the viewers that Amy wants Jay to sell her the Loxley's Café in exchange for him getting back with Marla. At the end of the series, Amy reveals that she is now the new owner of Loxley's Café and the Loxley's flat as Jay has sold it to her and warns Toni that herself and Olive have a day to move out. When Marla and Mack find out, they force Jay and Amy to leave for good. =Series 3= Amy returns at the end of Series 3, after Marla and Elliott have planned their wedding. She is now CEO of a large company, who are planning to offer Elliott a job. Elliott accepts the offer as he desperately need the money, but later reneges on it. Amy turns up at his wedding to Marla and interrupts it, but it is not revealed what happens next. Cameron Benedick Cameron Benedick (played by Wilfred Taylor) is an intelligent boy who is unlucky in love. He plays a central role in the second and third series. =Series 2= Cameron is close friends with Frankie and Olive. He was initially besotted by Marla and tries to ask her out in an early episode, although she just makes fun of him. He later develops a crush on Marla's friend Catherine, though it appears that she only sees him as a friend. He appears unaware of the fact that his best friend Frankie is in love with him. Despite being geeky and unpopular, Cameron is also kind and brave, which is shown when he tried to protect Frankie when she was in trouble at the Dive Bar. This briefly earns Cameron hero status at school, but this quickly diminishes after he is sick on Catherine on the way to a school trip and suffers an allergic reaction to halloumi at Marla's 18th birthday party, having believed it to be potato. When giving her advice for her playlist with Radio 1, Catherine kisses a shocked Cameron, leaving him with a smile on his face and Frankie jealous. On the day of Catherine's Radio 1 Playlist Catherine calls Cameron her boyfriend so the security guard would let him in. =Series 3= In Series 3 Cameron and Catherine are initially dating, but Catherine dumps him as she feels that she is out of his league. After Taylor spreads rumours that they are sleeping together, Cameron and Frankie agree to lose their virginity to each other as friends, but this strains their friendship as both have feelings for one another but are unable to express them. Cameron's grandfather also dies, further straining his friendship with Frankie as his family commitments prevent them from talking about what happened between them. In the later episodes, Frankie disappears and Cameron and Alex track her down and rescue her. In the final episode, Cameron and Frankie forgive each other by Olive's grave. Francesca 'Frankie' Stern Francesca 'Frankie' Stern (played by Maisie Crossland) is an attention-seeking friend of Olive and Cameron. =Series 2= She is trying to solve the mystery of Toni's attack, which involves tracking down Jay. She is very unpopular, and there are a lot of rumours flying about her, often involving equally unpopular Dean. She also secretly fancies Cameron, and is jealous of both his friendship with Catherine and his increasing popularity at the school. She has recently replaced Olive as the lead singer of the school band. Frankie later witnesses Catherine kissing Cameron and is jealous. Frankie and Olive have a chat about boys and how their love life has improved or not and their issues. On the main night of the gig Frankie tells Olive that she hasn't told Cameron about her feelings for him because she wants him to be happy with Catherine. Olive tells Frankie that it is really nice of her to care about Cameron so much and that Frankie is Olive's best friend. Olive then lets Frankie sing the lead at the gig. =Series 3= In Series 3 it is revealed that Frankie is a carer for her mum, who has mental problems. Later in the series, it is revealed that Frankie used to have a brother, who died. Her brother's psychotic killer, Andrew Cromwell, tracked her down and trapped her in Mack's storeroom, but she managed to escape. She entered into an unlikely relationship with Noah, but this is unlikely to continue, because in the final episode she kissed Cameron and Noah kissed Rosa. Alex Fitzpatrick Alex Fitzpatrick (played by Connor Scarlett) is Tommy's younger brother, who is a 'nasty piece of work', possibly misunderstood. =Series 2= He set up a deal with Stephen to sort out Stephen's social life, including framing Tommy and getting him expelled from school, leaving Stephen's path to Olive clear. He is friends with Olive and it is thought he has a crush on her. Although he was initially just making sure she didn't find out about his trick with Stephen, he has now stopped doing Stephen's bidding in the hopes of getting Olive for himself. He's been getting jealous of Stephen and Olive's relationship and we've been led to believe that he fancies Olive when it is in fact Stephen he fancies; he shows this by kissing him. This suggests he is confused about his sexuality and could be homosexual. Alex later tells the headmaster that it was Mr. Andrews (Rory) that hit him in the face and gave him a black eye when it was in fact Stephen. When Tommy confronts Stephen about hitting Alex, Olive asks why and then he responds by saying that it was because Alex kissed him. After the truth about the kiss is revealed, Alex gets his own back on Stephen by telling Olive that Stephen had paid him to plant the drugs in Tommy's locker and send him away so that Olive and Tommy could break up because Stephen was jealous as he doesn't want Olive to be with anyone but himself. Tommy then asks why Alex did that to his own brother and explains that Alex is his brother and he would do anything for him but Alex says that all Tommy cared about is Number 1 – himself, which Tommy himself denies. When Tommy confronts Alex about the kiss with Stephen, Alex says just because of the kiss it does not mean he is gay and Tommy responds by saying he know it doesn't and he didn't say that. Olive goes off to the toilets where a message has been left from Alex for anyone to read which states \\"You don't care if I exist, So you won't care of I'm dead. Alex.\\" We later see Alex on top of the building's roof standing close to the edge, which shows he wants to jump. =Series 3= In Series 3, Alex is very depressed following Olive's death, and says that he visits her grave every day because 'Olive was the only one who listened'. Recently, his father threw him out, and he is staying with Jack. It is currently unknown whether Alex is gay or bisexual. In recent episodes he is shown to have friendships with both Jack and Taylor, although it is unclear whether he is romantically interested in either of them. Rory Andrews Rory Andrews (played by Duane Henry) is an easy-going English teacher at the school. =Series 2= He is portrayed as an intelligent man, who is smart enough to strike deals with students when the need arises. He is excited by Elliott's talents, and reluctantly expels Tommy after finding drugs in his locker. He also dated Toni as a teenager, which Toni seems embarrassed about, having admitted to Olive that he cried and gave her a high five when they first slept together. He started to date Toni again recently, but then found out about Toni's affair with Stephen and Marla's father Mack Mackinnon after Olive had confronted Toni in front of him. Rory is later suspended after Alex accuses him of hitting him in the face and giving him a black eye. Toni comes to see Rory and explains that she's sorry for what happened and he explains to her that what she does is none of his business and is further shocked when he assumes Toni isn't sure whether to believe him over the Alex incident. Toni then apologises to Rory for thinking he hit Alex. Rory does not return for the third series, and it is mentioned that he has left the school. Catherine Cadence Catherine Cadence (played by Deborah May) is a friend of Marla's who turns up out of the blue in Series 2. =Series 2= She is passionate about music and has applied and been accepted for a work experience placement at Radio 1. She is currently working in the Loxley's cafe, much to Marla's disdain. At the cafe, she often bends the rules by doing things like keeping the cafe open late and throwing parties, against Toni's wishes. She is close friends with Cameron, although it is possible that she is just using him. Catherine has been recently snogging and flirting with George which makes everyone assume that they are now a couple and makes Cameron despondent. After Cameron helps her with her playlist for her work experience with Radio 1 she kisses him. On the day of Catherine's Radio 1 Playlist Catherine calls Cameron her boyfriend so the security guard would let him in. =Series 3= At the start of Series 3, Cameron and Catherine are going steady, but Catherine quickly dumps him. She later loses her job at Radio 1 when Marla blabs to her mum, but quickly forgives Marla and takes control of the school radio station instead. Elliott Baden Elliott Gerald Baden (played by Alex Roe) is a popular, sporty, good-looking boy who is not fazed by much. =Series 2= He first appears having won a swimming trophy, a fact that Rory is very excited about. He has a love/hate relationship with Marla. After Marla's ex Jay Kelso returned on her 18th Birthday, Elliott has told Marla how he feels and has told her that he will give her some space to think about who she wants to be with, soon competing with Jay for Marla's affection. Elliott gives Marls his car to practise driving as he says he's going to go away for a bit. When Elliott tells Marla that he spotted Jay and Marla's mother (Amy) talking about a making a deal, Marla asks him if he heard what they said which he responded no which makes Marla think that Elliott is just jealous because she has chosen Jay over him. When Marla asks Jay why he didn't deny it, he reassures her that they did have a deal but it was that if Jay promised to look after Marla then her parents would give them some space. =Series 3= At the end of Series 2, Marla and Elliott get back together and are still together in Series 3, but their relationship is put under strain by Elliott's swimming commitments. However, when Elliott finds out that Marla is pregnant, he makes it clear that Marla and the baby come first.

Jack Simmons/Andrew Cromwell Jack Simmons (played by Dominic Sherwood) is a friend of Stephen's from the mental institution who is introduced in Series 3. =Series 3= After Stephen leaves for Oxford, Mack employs Jack to clean his properties and he forms a bond with Alex. He also seems to have a strange interest in Frankie, and it has been implied that the reason for this is that he killed her brother in a car accident, and that he was formerly known as Andrew Cromwell. Towards the end of series three, the character breaks the fourth wall, and stares scarily into the camera at least once. Taylor Mackinnon Taylor Mackinnon (played by Kellie-Rose Demmel) is an American cousin of Marla and Stephen who stays with them in Series 3. Series 3 - She quickly becomes disliked by many characters - including Marla and Catherine, with Marla saying \\"That absolute cow! She's been undermining me all day. First, she stole the last of my shampoo - and forced me to look like a skank; and then she tried to outdo me on the modelling thing; and then she dissed my beautiful bag; and then she tries it on with my boyfriend, knowing fullwell who he is.\\" Marla and Catherine then steal one of Taylor's diaries and share the contents with her friends. Taylor has recently expressed a romantic interest in Ryan, her teacher's husband, although he has not as yet given an indication that the feeling is mutual. She has also expressed interest in Greg Cranborne, but later starts bullying him mercilessly, to the extent where he threatens her with a knife.

Hitlerin elämä ja teot is a pseudo-historical black humor novel written by Veikko Huovinen. Its opening suggests that it is a product of original research into the personal history of Adolf Hitler, undertaken to dispel the myths concerning Hitler and attempting to understand his motivations in beginning the Second World War. However, the novel is in fact an elaborate mockery of Hitler, using numerous false documents in order to tell an absurd history of the dictator. A Finnish word veitikka of the novel's name literally means \\"little rogue\\" or \\"little rascal\\". Background By 1970, Veikko Huovinen had established himself as a prominent author of folksy comedy novels in Finland. He had begun exhibiting a strong affinity to pacifism with his novel Rauhanpiippu in 1956, but during the 1960s had not written anything obviously political. Veitikka, therefore, was a shock to his fans and readers in general, as using Adolf Hitler as a vehicle for comedy was unheard of at that time. Huovinen had even as a young man been fascinated with Hitler; his father had been a fervent opponent of Nazis during the Second World War (despite Finland's quasi-alliance with Germany), and Huovinen wondered why anyone would follow such an obvious madman. By 1970, his despair over the failings of mankind had crystallized to an idea to write about a dictator - Adolf Hitler. Plot summary The novel begins with the birth of Adolf Hitler and his early childhood. Huovinen describes the young Adolf as a rebellious child with a weak constitution, but with an intimidating gaze and vulgar speech. Also, his uncanny ability with a rifle is commented upon. Adolf eventually ends up as a vagrant in the streets of Vienna, selling mediocre watercolor paintings. The novel suggests that during this time Hitler met Joseph Goebbels, with whom he had an instant rapport with his vulgarities and anti-semitism - the first radical departure from actual history. The novel swiftly moves to the First World War, and describes Hitler's exploits as a behind-the-lines scout sniper - who, in his spare time, criticizes the Army High Command and tells jokes so disgusting that even hardened soldiers stay silent. Also his foul-smelling flatulence is commented upon. While following Hitler's rise to power from the Great Depression to the Second World War, the novel makes its most outrageous claim; Hitler and Goebbels jointly conceived the Second World War in order to \\"teach the pompous German nation a lesson\\" with two distinct operations. The first, \\"Operation Ulex\\" has the goal of starting a war and reaching decisive victories in the short term - while making strategic mistakes that will hurt in the long run. The second, \\"Operation Saublöder Arsch\\" involves deliberately losing the war, while prolonging it to the bitter end with as much bloodletting and destruction as possible. When all is lost, Hitler and Goebbels leave the corpses of look- alikes behind, escaping the siege of Berlin with guns blazing and board a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor bound for South America. When en route, they express their disgust for the servile, obedient Germans and fantasize about Latin women. Analysis Veitikka was a considerable departure for Huovinen. His previous novels had been humanist in nature, but Veitikka had a misanthropic tone. Huovinen asserts throughout the novel that men who follow charismatic leaders are fools, and it is a characteristic of mankind throughout its history. He does go on that the only weapon against such dictators is humor, because if one laughs at a dictator, the dictator loses the credibility he needs. He encourages the reader to laugh at Hitler, so that no one might take Nazism seriously ever again.

Development The Auster J/1 Autocrat of 1946 had achieved considerable sales success but orders died away in the late 1940s. Few sales were achieved in the important Australian market as the Autocrat's 100 h.p. engine was not powerful enough for the harsher summer conditions experienced there. In 1950, Auster Aircraft utilised an uncompleted Autocrat airframe and wing structure and incorporated a larger fin and rudder to compensate for the installation of a 130 h.p. de Havilland Gipsy Major engine which had been modified by the fitment of double scavenge pumps to match the cooling system.Hitchman, 1989, p. 31 The prototype first flew in 1950 and was followed by several other conversions of Autocrat airframes, but construction soon switched to the use of new airframes. Most sales were made in Australia and New Zealand.

The spray bars were installed using supports on the Aiglet's fuselage undersurfaces and the wing struts.

These were flown out to Sudan in autumn 1950 and within a month had rid of farmland of locusts and other insect pests.Jackson, 1973, p. 69 The agricultural task required operation at very low heights in conditions of extreme heat and inevitably resulted in the loss of many Aiglets in accidents. After withdrawal from crop-spraying use during the late 1950s and early 1960s, the survivors were purchased by aerial photo contractors, aero clubs and private owners.Ellison, 1966, pp. 49-52 Many of these aircraft were fitted with an extra fuel tank beneath the fuselage, as shown in the adjacent photograph.

The municipality covers an area of 219.49 km². As of 2005, the municipality had a total population of 20,343. The original name was N’dabi, which in Otomi means “place where tree trunks float” or “where there is much water.” The current name is from Nahuatl and means “near a lake” or “an extension of water.” The municipality has both an Aztec glyph as well as a coat of arms. History This area became populated 15,000 to 20,000 years ago when nomads entered this valley in search of mammoths. Between 7,000 and 12,000 years ago, the people of this area gradually became sedentary, forming villages, and initiating agriculture based on corn, beans, squash and chili peppers. One of the first known tribes to dominate this area was the Matlatzinca around 3,500 BCE, but suffered attacks by neighboring Purépecha. By the pre-classic period, society had developed into stratified tribes and by 200 BCE a tributary system has been developed. On the site of the town of Amanalco was found a 7,000-year-old human footprint in volcanic rock belonging to someone now called the “man of Amanalco.” The Aztecs conquered this area along with the rest of the Valley del Matlatzinco (today Toluca Valley) in 1476 under the rule of Axayacatl. Amanalco came under the jurisdiction of Metepec. After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Gonzalo de Sandoval took control of the valley with ease, as the native Matzalincas saw the Spaniards as a way to protect themselves from the Purépecha. The valley then became part of the lands awarded to Hernán Cortés when he was named the Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca by the Spanish king. Under Spanish rule in the early colonial period, Amanalco remained subject to Metepec. A village was founded in the middle of the 16th century by several medicinal herb collectors, according to oral tradition. Franciscans came to the village and named it San Jerónimo Amanalco. By 1600, the Mexicas had abandoned the area and groups of Otomi came to settle. In 1604, Amanalco was made a governing center for the area. The Amanalco area was the encomendero of Juan de Sámano, whose Hacienda en Zinacantepec, La Gavia, claimed lands in Amanalco. However, the natives of the area managed to reclaim this land. In 1613. The village’s church was constructed in the 16th century. The church became a parish in 1768 as a dependency of the parish of San Francisco del Valle, now Valle del Bravo. The population of the town joined with the insurgency in 1810 and many fought against royalist general Juan Bautista de la Torre as part of Miguel Hidalgo’s army. In return, the village asked for legal title to the land on which it sits, as the La Gavia Hacienda still made claims here. The first Spanish families moved here only in the early 19th century. At this time the village was also known as Amanalco de las Cucharas (spoons) as it was noted to the manufacture of spoons. The village and surrounding area became a municipality in 1826. The village supported the Play de Ayutla in 1854. In 1858, liberal General Felipe Berriozábal came through here on his way to Mexico City, fighting against conservative guerrilla forces. The village was declared a town in 1875 and added “de Becerra” to the name after José María Becerra. Becerra was a parish priest here in the mid-19th century. He worked here for over twenty years, instructing natives on carpentry, introduced potable water and building houses which were donated to families in the municipality. He died in 1868 in what is now Valle de Bravo, but his remains were brought back to Amanalco and buried in the parish church. He is considered to be a protector of the community. During the Porfirio Díaz period (1880s to 1910), the La Gavia Hacienda again made claims on the land of the municipality and eventually took over the economic life of the town, with almost all the inhabitants working for the hacienda for little pay. For this reason, the residents joined the forces of Andrés Fabila during the Mexican Revolution, who were aligned with the Zapatistas. However, the town was destroyed by Zapatista forces under Carmen Esquivel during the war. This left the municipality without a local government for several years. By 1919, steps had been taken to reconstruct the municipal seat under the direction of Alfonso Fabila, with the first post war municipal president being José Avila. However, the war had the effect of returning lands seized by the La Gavia Hacienda back to the indigenous and mestizo peoples of the municipality and the formation of ejidos. Reconstruction of the seat would continue until the mid-20th century. La Gavia was dispossessed under the government of Lázaro Cárdenas in the 1930s.

Medical Post, April 10, 2007 Introduction Banting lived at the house in London for ten months, beginning in June, 1920. He attempted a private medical practice and when it was unsuccessful, he began working at the University of Western Ontario; his research for a lecture there was what inspired his 25 word idea that provided the key to discovering insulin, and prevented the certain death of those affected by diabetes. Banting returned to the University of Toronto to begin his research on insulin in the spring of 1921. Banting House is dedicated to the story behind the discovery of insulin, as well as Banting's life and career. Its galleries focus on everything from his time spent in London, to his contributions in both World Wars, to his efforts as an artist. Some notable artifacts include Banting's original art, desk, medicine cabinet, and bed frame, as well as his Military Cross, the KBE, and his official replica of the Nobel Prize. Banting House was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1997. History For decades, the public viewed the house as the \\"Birthplace of Insulin,\\" and many individuals expressed their desire to have it turned into a shrine or monument to honour the Canadian hero. It was first internationally referred to with the title \\"Birthplace of Insulin,\\" in 1923, by the Detroit Free Press.\\"Birthplace of Insulin\\". Detroit Free Press, December 9, 1923\\"Banting home in London memorial to insulin hero\\". Toronto Star, May 12, 1982 After 47 years, the house received official recognition in 1970, in the form of a plaque for the house, awarded by the London Public Library Board.\\"Banting House gets $22,367 Wintario Grant\\". London Free Press, May 10, 1983 In 1981, the London & District Branch of the Canadian Diabetes Association purchased the house, and began to use it as an office; they hoped to eventually restore the house, and turn it into a museum. Through various grants and fundraising efforts, by 1984, the museum was operational. Museum features Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother at the unveiling ceremony of the Flame of Hope in July 1989 The statue of Frederick Banting outside Banting House Banting House features archival materials, artifacts, and other ephemera associated with Banting as co-discoverer of insulin, doctor, and artist, as well as his involvement in the first and second world wars. One gallery depicts the kind of office Banting might have had, and contains several of his belongings, including his original medicine cabinet, and a graduated cylinder Banting used during his time at the University of Western Ontario.\\"Banting's beaker finds a more public home\\". Western News, May 27, 2010 The apothecary in the next room features a sink that Banting installed for his medical practice. Other galleries in the museum hold original belongings of Banting as well, most notably his desk and his bed frame. The bed frame is kept in Banting's bedroom, and visitors are encouraged to take a moment or a picture with it, as it is not roped off like many other areas of the museum. Additionally, an official replica of the Nobel Prize medal co-awarded to Banting and Macleod is on display, as well as many of Banting's other medals. Other displays include the military gallery, which includes a representation of the type of operating room Banting would have worked in on the field during the First World War, some information on the projects he headed during the Second World War, and an entire gallery filled with artwork done by Banting. Adjacent to the museum is Sir Frederick G. Banting Square, a garden with several information plaques, and three main attractions. Two of the attractions, a full-sized sculpture of Banting writing his life-altering idea down, and the Flame of Hope, were unveiled by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. The Flame of Hope, symbolizing the hope for a final cure for diabetes, was kindled by Her Majesty during her visit.\\"She's late but 4,000 wait to say hello to Queen mum\\". London Free Press, July 8, 1989 The third attraction is the globe sculpture, which was added more recently in 2010. It represents Canada's gift to the world, and embraces Banting House's visitors from abroad, with the names of every country listed on it.

It was acquired by FIS in July 2019 for $43 billion. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange until 16 January 2018 when it was acquired by Vantiv to form Worldpay, Inc. History = Early History = WorldPay started as an online multi-currency payment system in 1997. The founder Nick Ogden partnered with National Westminster Bank to provide the financial systems and Andrew Birch of Symbiant to provide the end user payment gateway. When Royal Bank of Scotland took over National Westminster Bank, Worldpay was wholly acquired and merged with an electronic payment system called Streamline which was first released by Centre-file ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of National Westminster Bank, in 1989. = Management History = RBS Ownership In 1995 the Streamline system was reabsorbed into the bank when the trading name and payroll service of Centre-file ltd were sold to Ceridian. NatWest was acquired in 2002 by Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS) which renamed the business RBS WorldPay and appointed Ron Kalifa as CEO. RBS expanded the business significantly by acquiring and merging a number of payment solutions companies from different countries. Over the next five years it was combined with seven leading retail payment solutions brands: Streamline, Streamline International, PaymentTrust, Netherlands based Bibit, RiskGuardian and US-based Lynk. Divestment from RBS As a condition in the European Commission's clearance in December 2009 of state aid to RBS, Worldpay was to be sold as part of a plan to divest selected businesses from the group. On 6 August 2010, Advent International and Bain Capital agreed to acquire Worldpay for £2.025bn, including a £200m contingent consideration, and appointed Ron Kalifa, who has previously headed up the global transaction services division with RBS, as CEO. The RBS Group retained a 20% stake in the newly independent business, with Advent International and Bain Capital owning 40% each. The sale completed on 1 December 2010. In November 2013, RBS said it had sold its remaining stake of about 20 percent in Worldpay to the payment processing firm’s majority shareholders, private equity firms Advent International and Bain Capital. The company listed on the London Stock Exchange through an initial public offering (IPO) in October 2015. At the IPO, Advent and Bain earned a combined profit of £3.2 billion from their five year investment, selling about £1.2 billion of company stock and retaining a £2.3 billion stake. Acquired by Vantiv In July 2017, Vantiv announced its intention to acquire Worldpay for $10.4 billion. The combined entity kept the \\"Worldpay\\" name, and was headquartered and listed in the United States, but internal operations continued to be based in the U.K. In August 2017, Vantiv announced that it would acquire Worldpay. The transaction was completed on 16 January 2018. There was initial concern from UK politicians over whether the merger was as a result of the fall in the pound's value since 2016, turning British assets into bargains for foreign investors. However, WorldPay's vice-chair, Ron Kalifa, described the deal as \\"a meger of equals\\" and emphasised that the timing was simply coincidental, as the company was \\"not ready [to do the deal] last year when the pound was in a different position.\\" Acquired by FIS In March 2019, Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), a payment rival based in Florida, bought Worldpay in a deal worth £32 billion.  Acquisitions  On 21 December 2010, the UK division of Worldpay acquired Cardsave, one of the leading independent sales organisations distributing credit and debit card processing services to small retailers. In May 2011 Worldpay acquired Envoy Services Limited, a leading provider of alternative payment solutions to eCommerce merchants worldwide, for an undisclosed amount. In June 2013, Worldpay launched Worldpay Zinc, a mobile card processing terminal which connects to smart phones. In September 2013, Worldpay revealed it had acquired US payment processing company Century Payments. In 2014, Worldpay announced a definitive agreement to acquire SecureNet Payment Systems from private equity firm Sterling Partners. The acquisition was completed in December of that year. Following this acquisition, WorldPay announced that it would spend $10 million relocating its US headquarters to Atlanta. Operations The company provided payment services for mail order and Internet retailers, as well as point of sale transactions. Customers are a mix of multinational, multichannel retailers, with the majority being small business merchants. It also provided loans to small businesses. In 2016, WorldPay presented its own IT platform, which enabled the company to process up to 20 times more transactions. This decision was a part of the process to separate WorldPay entirely from the Royal bank of Scotland and their technology systems.

He is chiefly remembered for his sponsorship of Crewe's Act of 1782, which barred customs officers and post office officials from voting. Crewe Hall, Cheshire c.1818 Early life Crewe was the eldest son of John Crewe, Member of Parliament for Cheshire between 1734 and 1752, and grandson of John Offley Crewe who had also held the same seat before him. On his father's death in 1752 he succeeded to Crewe Hall. Parliamentary career In 1764 he was chosen High Sheriff of Cheshire, and he entered parliament at a by-election in 1765 as Whig member for Stafford; but at the next general election, in 1768, he was returned unopposed for Cheshire, which he represented for the next 34 years. He was never opposed for Cheshire, and presumably was highly regarded locally : the Dictionary of National Biography records that he was \\"an enlightened agriculturalist and a good landlord\\". In the factional politics of the Whig Party, Crewe was initially a friend and follower of the Duke of Grafton, but later became a particular supporter of Charles James Fox, apparently subsidising him to the tune of £1200 a year. After Fox's resignation from office in 1782, the incoming administration considered offering Crewe some governmental office to secure his support, but were told that his only ambition was for a peerage. He remained loyal to Fox, and in February 1784 was on Fox's list of new peers to be made should he return to office as he hoped. Fox did not succeed in returning to power at that point, but eventually - four years after his retirement from the Commons - Crewe was rewarded with the desired peerage when Fox finally returned to office in 1806. Crewe was created Baron Crewe, of Crewe in the County Palatine of Chester on 25 February 1806. Crewe rarely spoke in the House of Commons, and more than half his recorded contributions concerned a single measure, the Parliament Act of 1782 which thereafter bore his name. This was an attempt to curb a particular source of corruption in elections: in many of the rotten boroughs of the period, only a few votes were needed to swing elections, and it was common for those who held the power of appointment to various well-paid official posts to reserve these for voters in return for co-operation at election time. The scale of the problem may be judged by Prime Minister Rockingham's statement that 11,500 officers of customs and excise were electors, and that 70 Commons seats were decided chiefly by such votes. William Dowdeswell had attempted in 1770 to put a stop to this practice by preventing officers of the Custom, Excise and Post Office from voting. This measure had not reached the statute book, but Crewe introduced a bill with the same object in 1780 and again in 1781, succeeding on the latter occasion in passing it into law. Unfortunately, the new regulation was easily evaded, as the power of patronage was simply shifted to offer lucrative offices to the voters' relatives instead of to the voters themselves. Private life He married Frances Anne Greville, daughter of Fulke Greville (1717-1806) and Frances Macartney, in 1766, and they had two surviving children: * John, who succeeded him in the peerage * Emma, who married Foster Cunliffe Lord Crewe died in 1829. His wife, usually known simply as \\"Mrs Crewe\\", was a noted political hostess. She died in 1818.

He agreed to abide by the parole conditions of a Yemeni jihadist rehabilitation program directed by judge Hamoud al-Hitar. In them he had to accept more education about Islam, as well as discuss his new and old ideas about jihad with the judge and younger students. During a September 2009 interview with reporter Michelle Shephard of the Toronto Star, al-Bahri said that he was no longer a member of al-Qaeda, but that he supported the organization for some of its beliefs. He claimed to have recruited Salim Ahmed Hamdan to al-Qaeda, where the latter became a driver for bin Laden. The two men married sisters. Captured in Afghanistan in 2001, Hamdan was the first detainee tried under the United States' tribunals; his military defense attorney took his case to the US Supreme Court in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006) to challenge their constitutionality. Al-Bahri and Hamdan were the subjects of the documentary, The Oath (2010), by American director Laura Poitras, which explored their time in al-Qaeda and afterward.

On his return to Sanaa, Yemen, he was arrested by security forces in February 2001 at the request of the United States. Al-Bahri has said he was held without trial for nearly two years, 13 months of which in solitary confinement. He learned about 9/11 in his prison cell in Sanaa.Al-Bahri, Nasser, Guarding bin Laden: My Life in al- Qaeda. p.185. Thin Man Press. London. Under the direction of a Yemeni judge, Hamoud al-Hitar, al-Bahri agreed to participate in the Yemeni jihadist rehabilitation program, through which captured jihadists took education and challenged their philosophy, while working with students. Al-Bahri was finally released in 2002 after a few months in the program. He said it was not very effective. Post-release Following his release, al-Bahri studied business administration and subsequently worked as a taxi driver.Al-Bahri, Nasser, Guarding bin Laden: My Life in al-Qaeda. p.189. Thin Man Press.

On bin Laden's instruction, al-Bahri and Salim Ahmed Hamdan married sisters.Al-Bahri, Nasser, Guarding bin Laden: My Life in al-Qaeda. p.144. Thin Man Press. London. Hamdan returned to Yemen in November 2008, having been imprisoned by the United States in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and being convicted on a charge in 2008. Captured in Afghanistan and detained by the United States, Hamdan was the first detainee tried under the military tribunals and took his case to the United States Supreme Court in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006). After appealing his conviction, Hamdan was acquitted in October 2012 by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Other activities Al-Bahri wrote a memoir with the help of Georges Malbrunot about his experiences, which they published in French as Dans l'ombre de Ben Laden: révélations de son garde du corps repenti (\\"In the Shadow of Bin Laden: Revelations of His Repentant Bodyguard\\") (2010). In 2013, an English translation of the book, by Susan de Muth, was published in London under the title Guarding bin Laden: My Life in Al-Qaeda. Al-Bahri has said he opposes attacks that injure or kill civilians. While talking to the Toronto Star in 2009, he said he had supported al Qaeda's 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City, as a means to make Americans aware of their nation's activities abroad. In April 2010, al-Bahri said that he regretted not having killed bin Laden when he had a chance, as so many civilians died because of the al-Qaeda leader. He is described as \\"disengaged\\" from the war with the West, although he stated admiration for some of al-Qaeda's ideals. Death Al-Bahri died of an undisclosed illness in the Yemeni city of Mukalla on 26 December 2015. In popular culture Abu Jandal is played by in The Looming Tower miniseries.

He played as a goalkeeper. Before he turned professional he was capped a number of times for the Welsh Amateur XI. Personal life Evans was born in Llandaff, now part of Cardiff. As a youngster he sang in a choir and considered becoming a clergyman, but chose instead to join the police, and served in the Barry area before taking up football full-time. He participated in a wide variety of sports apart from football, and later worked as a physical training instructor and athletics coach. He was married to Mary, and died in Bournemouth, Dorset, in 1977 at the age of 74. Club career Evans joined the amateur club Cardiff Corinthians in 1922, and within a couple of years had earned his first selection for the Wales Amateur XI. He moved on to Football League club Aberdare Athletic, still as an amateur, in October 1926. He played 24 games in the 1926–27 season, which was Aberdare's last in the Football League, as they finished bottom of the Third Division South and failed to be re-elected. Despite his club's lack of success, Evans himself performed sufficiently well to earn his first cap for the full Wales national team. Evans moved on briefly to Merthyr Town, also of the Third Division South, and had short spells with former club Cardiff Corinthians and with Western League side Lovells Athletic, before settling at Barry of the Southern League in 1928. Described as \\"something of a risk-taker, but ... a classy and reliable 'keeper\\", his only weakness an erratic clearing kick, Evans passed two seasons at Barry. In April 1930 he returned to the Football League with Cardiff City, then playing in the Second Division. He understudied Ireland international Tom Farquharson at Cardiff, and in three years at the club played only eight league games, though this lack of first- team football did not prevent his selection for his country. In September 1933 he joined Birmingham of the First Division, again as deputy to an international goalkeeper, in this case England's Harry Hibbs. After playing only twice for Birmingham's first team in the 1933–34 season, Evans was appointed assistant trainer at the club. He then spent time abroad, returning to England in 1937 to take up the position of trainer at Blackburn Rovers, which he held until the outbreak of the Second World War. International career Evans was first selected for the Wales Amateur XI in October 1924; they beat the touring South African team 1–0, though \\"they had a very anxious time during the first half, when they were mainly indebted to L. Evans, their goalkeeper, for preventing any score.\\" He continued to receive complimentary notices when representing his country. Against England in 1925, \\"if it had not been for some sound play by Evans, the goalkeeper, the score might have been considerably higher\\"; in a 4–0 defeat two years later, \\"the real hero of the Welsh side was L. Evans, the goalkeeper\\"; and in 1929, again with English opposition, \\"Evans gave a magnificent performance in goal, stopping shot after shot from the English forwards with amazing confidence\\". He made his last appearances for the Amateur XI in 1932, in a 5–0 victory against Scotland's amateurs, when, in the opinion of The Times' correspondent, \\"there was no cooler player on the field than L. Evans, the Welsh goalkeeper.\\" While an Aberdare Athletic player, and still an amateur, Evans was selected for the full Wales side; he made his debut on 9 April 1927 in a 2–2 draw at home to Ireland. He won his second cap as a Cardiff City player, chosen to play Scotland on a day when the pool of players available for selection was restricted by the Football League's rule forbidding its clubs from releasing players other than to England on days when League matches were being played; this weakened team earned a 1–1 draw. He also appeared in Wales' next game, a 4–0 defeat at home to England, and his fourth and last full cap was won as a Birmingham player and a professional, in a 1–0 win against Ireland in Belfast in November 1933. In the summer of 1929, Evans was part of a Football Association of Wales team which toured Canada, playing 15 matches over a five- week period where he shared the goalkeeping duties with Bert Gray.

He joined the Muslim Brotherhood in 1972, but left it in early 1980s after he became a judge. Newsweek reported that when he adjudicated the case of the murder of two Yemeni Jews in 1984 he received death threats when he broke an unspoken tradition that judges not impose the death penalty for the killers of Jews.

Al-Hitari acknowledged that his first deradicalization program consisted mostly of senior religious clerics engaging in \\"theological duels\\" with the jihadist prisoners. He claimed the program had been \\"98% successful\\". Al-Hitari answered Shephard's questions about a report from the Countering Terrorism Center at West Point, that described his first anti-jihadist program as a failure. Al-Hitari was asked about the criticism in the West Point report that his rehabilitation program had focused merely on persuading the prisoners that Yemen should not be the target of jihad inspired violence, but it didn't spend enough energy curbing the prisoners desire to attack targets outside of Yemen.

Biography  Willem was born to Joost Teellinck, a mayor of Zierikzee, and Johanna de Jonge in 1579. His father died when he was 15. Willem received an excellent education. He studied at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, and then received a doctorate from the University of Poitiers in France. He then lived among the Puritans in England for a time. It was at this time that he became a Calvinist. In England Willem met Martha Greendon. She was a Puritan woman, and the two were married. It was while in England that Willem also decided to become a minister and give up the pursuit of law. Dutch church historians tend to think of Willem, and perhaps his brother Eewout, as giving the original impulse to Precicianism as a movement.Can These Bones Live?, F. Ernest Stoeffler, Christian History, Volume V, No 2 1986, page 4  Ministry  Willem studied theology at the University of Leiden under both Franciscus Gomarus and Jacob Arminius. At first he tried to stay neutral in the controversy although he personally was a Gomarist. Teellinck was ordained in 1606 and began serving a parish in Duiveland. Teellinck stayed in contact with his English Puritan friends, especially John Dod, Arthur Hildersham, and Thomas Taylor. Teellinck brought the English Puritanism to his ministry in the Netherlands. He stressed repentance, practical godliness, and willing to address current events in his sermons. In 1612, he was sent by his Classis to the Hague to have the government call a National Synod to resolve the growing conflict between Calvinism and Arminianism. This would eventually result in the Synod of Dort. In 1613 Willem Teellinck took a call to the pastorate in Middelburg. He served here until his death in 1629. The church grew under his leadership, and he gained quite a reputation as a very godly minister, even going as far to continually visit the sick even during an outbreak of pestilence and plague. At the age of 50, Willem Teellinck died. Thousands mourned his death.  Works  Teellinck wrote at least 127 manuscripts, including 20 full-length books (many of his books were printed by Middelburg printer Hans van der Hellen), although not all were printed and some were printed after his death. His first work was published in 1608, and was entitled The Love of the Fatherland. It was about the need of the government to enact laws to help restrain sin. Most of his works, however, dealt more with personal piety or exegesis of the Bible. This includes his longest work, The Key of Devotion, which is about 800 pages. However, Teellinck did also write works against the Roman Catholic Church and Arminianism. His book The True Path of Godliness was recently translated into English.

The settlement was probably established around 800 BCE, when the city of Teotenango was in existence. It remained an important town through the colonial period, part of the vast lands held by a family which came to be known as the Counts of Calimaya. The town is home to one of the oldest examples of an open chapel in the State of Mexico. Today, the municipality is still mostly agricultural but there has been rapid construction of housing divisions, changing parts of it from rural to suburban. The town The town of Calimaya is located south of the city of Toluca in the Valley of Toluca. It is divided into five neighborhoods: Los Angeles, El Calvario, San Martin, Gualupita and San Juan. The town centers on a square called the Plaza de Kiosko which is flanked by the municipal palace, a set of arches that contains businesses and the Casa de Cultura. This “culture house” contains old documents and archeological pieces, as well as the municipal library, which was opened in 1986. The plaza area is bordered on the east by Juárez Street. Directly across this street is the clock tower and the former Franciscan monastery and current parish church. The clock tower was built in 1910, as part of preparations for the Centennial of Mexico's Independence. The parish of San Pedro y San Pablo is part of a former Franciscan monastery complex mostly constructed between 1529 and 1594. It is one of the most complete former monasteries to survive from the 16th century in the Valley of Toluca. The complex consists of a main church, an open chapel, a baptistery, a chapel called the Capillas de la Tercera Orden and an atrium with some remaining chapels. The main churche contains an altarpiece from the 16th century with an image called “El Señor del Cuerito” (The Lord of the Leather), which is an image painted on leather, which was considered very miraculous a long time ago. It also contains a painting called La Madre María de la Luz by Miguel Cabrera. The open chapel and baptistery area is the oldest surviving part of the complex. The chapel is believed to have been built in 1529 by the Franciscans that came to evangelize the area and one of the first of its kind in New Spain. One unusual characteristic of the chapel is that the four arches are asymmetrical. It has been listed as a historic monument by INAH as it combines European and indigenous elements. The baptistery contains the originally 16th century font. Despite its importance historically, the open chapel is the least visited monument in the State of Mexico. The main reason is that it is not as well known as contemporaries such as the monastery in Acolman. The municipal market was opened in 1998. The municipality View of the municipal palace from the main plaza The municipality of Calimaya consists of the seat and twenty nine other communities. Outside of the seat, the main communities are: Concepción Coatipac, San Bartolito Tlaltelolco, San Andrés Ocotlán, San Diego de la Huerta, San Lorenzo Cuauhtenco, San Marcos de la Cruz, Santa María Nativitas and Zaragoza de Guadalupe. The municipality is part of the metropolitan area of Toluca, located south of the city. It borders the municipalities of Toluca, Metepec, Mexicalzingo, Chapultepec, Tianguistenco, San Antonio la Isla, Tenango del Valle and Santa María Rayón. From 2008 to 2011, population and housing has increased significantly. Population rose from 38,770 in 2005 to 47,033 in 2010. The number of housing units have increased from 7,464 in 2005 to 10,589 in 2010. This increase is mostly due to the construction of housing developments in the municipality from 2008 to 2011. In this time period, developers have added 11,373 units to the 7,151 that existed before. The new developments are changing the municipality from rural to suburban, and the municipality cannot keep up with services. From 2000 to 2010, the population has grown from 35,166 to 47,033 a 33% increase. There are no major indigenous communities in the municipality with only 108 people speaking any kind indigenous language, mostly Mazahua and Otomi. There are 41 schools in the municipality from preschool to high school level. There are thirteen preschools, seventeen primary schools, eight middle schools, two distance learning middle schools (telesecundaria), and one high school/preparatory school. There are also two job training centers and a day care center. The municipality is considered to have a low level of socioeconomic marginalization. Over 95% of the population has basic services such as sewerage, running water and electricity; however, in 85% of the municipality, drainage is insufficient, and police coverage is sparse. 93% of the surface area is used for agriculture, livestock and forestry, with the rest being residential areas or mining. Just over thirty percent of the working population is dedicated to agriculture and forestry. The main crop is corn. There is only one location that produces livestock (cattle) in any quantity. The municipality, along with federal authorities, has been promoting fish farming operation with the aim of generating jobs in the rural areas. Much of this is for the pet market locally and later for export to the United States. The water used to raise the fish is then reused in greenhouse operations. Industry consists of small workshops and one factory producing clothing. Workshops produce tubes, cinderblock, bathroom fixtures and food processing such as corn for tortillas. Mining of sand, gravel and other construction materials is more important. Just over thirty percent of the working population is dedicated to mining and manufacturing. Mineral resources consist of those used for construction such as sand and gravel. According to the municipal president about half of the municipality's mines, which generate about four thousand jobs directly or indirectly, are not in compliance with environmental laws. This is particularly true of those that extract tepojal, a volcanic stone used in construction. The municipality has 978 commercial enterprises in 88 concentrations. Most are dedicated to local, primary needs such as food. Most commerce centers on the municipal seat with its municipal market and traditional Thursday tianguis, which has operated since the 16th century. This sector of the economy is growing as the population grows. Thirty nine percent of the working population is dedicated to commerce and services. Zacango Zoo The municipality is home to one of the largest and most important zoos in Latin America, located on the former Zacango Hacienda. Dating from the first half of the 17th century, the hacienda was important not only for agriculture but also as a stopping point for mule trains as well as a commercial center. Today, its forty eight acres are dedicated to about 1500 animals from 250 species in enclosures meant to imitate the creatures’ natural habitats. The property has a number of services including a library, museum, education center, auditorium, “ecological house”, chapel, as well as an area with restaurants and souvenir stands. The center has a large artificial lake with boats for rent. There is a “children’s zoo” which allows for the petting of the animals there, including the recently born ones. It offers camps for children, which includes activities such as preparing food for the animals, and tours at night focusing on nocturnal species. The zoo has breeding programs of endangered species, whose successes include the birth of thirty three reptiles in 2010. In 2011, the zoo performed surgery on a ten-year-old Bengal tiger, whose lumbar was damaged during a fall at a Cancun zoo. This involved the successful transplanting of stem cells to the damaged area, the first done on a wild species. History View of the open chapel at the former Franciscan monastery Clock tower built for Mexico's Centennial in 1910 The name comes from Nahuatl and means “where houses are constructed.” The symbol of the entity is an Aztec glyph which contains two of the signs for house on a horizontal line. “de Díaz González” was added to the official name in 1894 in honor of Prisciliano María de Díaz González, a politician and judge of the time. It is believed that the community of Calimaya was founded at the same time as Teotenango, in 800CE. In the pre Hispanic period, the area was dominated by the Matlatzincas, with groups of Otomis, Mazahuas and Mexicas. This affected the language, culture and economy of the area. The first known ethnicity in the area was the Matlazincas with the area under the control of Teotenango. The area was still dominated by the same ethnicity when the Aztecs under Axayacatl conquered it in 1472 with long established villages. Gonzalo de Sandoval conquered the area in 1521 for the Spanish. The area initially became an encomienda of Hernán Cortés, who later handed it over to Juan Gutiérrez Altamirano. Gutiérrez would temporarily lost control of the property in 1530 but Cortés intervened and the family would control it for generations, becoming the Counts of Santiago Calimaya. The Franciscans were in charge of evangelization, establishing themselves in 1524. Calimaya was one of three main sub-dominions in the area along with Tepemaxalco and Mexicaltzingo, which probably remained after the Conquest until 1549, when Spanish style councils replaced indigenous authority. Calimaya's council formally began to function in 1560, with the area recognized as an “Indian Republic” (República de Indios). In 1560, the colonial government ordered the reorganization of the territories of Calimaya and Tepemaxalco. Much of this territory was not populated, so five new towns were founded: Mexicaltzingo, Chapultepec, San Antonio la Isla, Santa María Nativitas and San Andrés Ocotlán, each of these being subordinate to either Calimaya. The same year, Calimaya received authorization to hold a weekly market on Thursdays. By the end of the 16th century, the indigenous population of the area dropped by 70%. Agriculture remained the main economic activity through the colonial period, either on solid land or on artificial islands on area's lake and swamp called chinampas. In the 17th century, the area was divided into various haciendas, but all were under the control of the Count of Santiago Calimaya. By the beginning of the 18th century, some were independent of this family such as the Zacango Hacienda, belonging to a family named Martínez, the Rojas family ranch and others belonging to the Bartolomé, Gómez and López families. The grandson of Juan Gutiérrez Altamirano married the granddaughter of the viceroy in 1616, which gained him a noble title, becoming the Count of Santiago Calimaya. This family was one of the most important during the colonial era. Their Mexico City residence is now the Museum of the City of Mexico. This title passed from the Altamirano family to the Cervantes family due to the lack of heirs in 1809. The last of this family to have the title was José Juan de Cervantes, as the rights to the property ended with Independence. However, Cervantes managed to maintain control over most of the land until his death 1874. His descendants divided the lands. By 1718, the town of Calimaya would be a base for Spanish and Criollo merchants, which had an effect on the social order, forming schools and religious brotherhoods for festivals which are still celebrated. During the Mexican War of Independence, the town of Calimaya was negatively affected by the uprising as well as an epidemic in 1813. The Count was one of the signers of the Act of Independence of the country. From the beginning of the colonial era, Calimaya has been a seat of government under different arrangements. It became a municipality upon the creation of the State of Mexico just aft the conclusion of the War of Independence. The municipality was erected with the formation of the State of Mexico in 1824. The economy remained tied to agriculture during most of the 19th century, but during the Porfirio Díaz period, the economy of the area grew and changed, especially in the town, where commerce became increasingly important. When Toluca became the capital of the State of Mexico, its growth created demand for agricultural products, also helping Calimaya's economy. It was also an important last stop before the capital for caravans arriving from the south. A number of the town's major works are from the late 19th to early 20th century due to this. The seat was officially declared a town in 1894. In 1897, a rail line was opening connecting Toluca, Metepec, Mexicaltzingo, Calimaya and Tenango. Around the same time, electric, telephone and telegraph service arrived. The economic inequality in Mexico was evident in Calimaya as well by 1910, exacerbated by a fierce snowstorm in 1909 which ruined local crops. However, no fighting related to the Mexican Revolution occurred here. The 1910s and 1920s brought an end to the area's prosperity. However, the 1920s and 1930s would also bring technology such as more modern highways such as the one connecting Toluca and the south, which replaced the rail line. Socioeconomic reforms brought much agricultural land under the control of ejidos. During the colonial period, the seat controlled a territory of 520.5 km2. The current municipality is 103.11km2. Environment The land in the municipality is mostly flat, with the west side. The highest elevation is 4,578 meters above sea level, which is located on the slopes of the Nevada de Toluca. The lowest elevation is 2,600. In addition to the Nevado, another elevation is the Tepemaxalco Mountain, popularly known as the Cerro de los Cuates or Cerro de Putla. There are various streams in the area including the Las Cruces, Los Temascales, Las Palmas and El Ojo de Agua. Others run only during the rainy season. The climate is classified as temperate and wet (Cwbg) with most rain falling in the summer. The driest months are from November to March. Average annual rainfall is between 800 and 900mm. Average annual temperature is between 12 and 14C. The highest temperatures average under 22C and usually occur in June. Freezing temperatures are possible from November to January and sometimes as early as September and as late as May. The possibility of early and late freezes can affect agriculture. Ninety three percent of the municipality's surface is used for agriculture, livestock and forestry, with the rest used for residences and mining. The only wild areas are forests of oyamel fir, holm oak and pine on the slopes of the Nevada. The slopes of the volcano still contain fresh water springs, many of which run during the rainy season and when the snow melts off the volcano. Most of the municipality is deforested and the process continues due to lack of vigilance. Most wildlife has been exterminated except in the forested areas where some wildcats, deer and eagles can be found. Culture Religion is mostly Catholicism with some syncretism from indigenous influences. Customs related to the agricultural cycle have not completely disappeared from the municipality. Seeds are still blessed before planting. Another old tradition is the “Paseo de los locos” (Procession of the crazy men), who are men dressed as women. Today, it is done for fun, but it has its origins in a fertility ritual tied to agriculture, with the aim of bringing rain. The most important religious celebration for the municipality is the feast day of Saints Peter and Paul on 29 July. Each year the event is sponsored by three volunteers called “mayordomos” with fireworks, bullfights and live bands. Next in importance are the processions related to Holy Week. This tradition dates back to the early colonial era and show the influence of the Spanish from Seville which dominated the town then. The Santa María Nativitas Church is an example of folk Baroque style with the decoration molded from plaster. Another of this type is the chapel at San Andrés Ocotlán, whose main portal contains Salomonic columns, possibly added at the beginning of the 18th century. Others include the San Juan Bautista, San Bartolito and Nuestra Señora de los Ángeles chapels as well as the Nuestra Señora de la Concepción Church in Coatipac. This last contains an important main altar. Mariachi music has been popular only since the 1970s, but has become an important part of traditional religious festivals. The first mariachi band in the municipality was the Mariachi San Juan, which is now known as the Mariachi de los Angeles. Today, there are about twenty or so in the municipality which mostly play weddings and other local events. The municipality hosts an annual Feria de Mariachi, which attracted about sixty bands in 2011 from as far as Jalisco and Aguascalientes. The municipality used to be known for the weaving of a shawl called a rebozo. However, this tradition has all but died out. Typical dishes here are the same as the region (barbacoa, tamales, etc.), with one local drink called tecui. The name is from Nahuatl and means “to move the heart.” It has its origins in the 19th century when mules brought sugar cane alcohol from Morelos, which was then mixed with sweetened orange juice. This is then lit just before serving.

In the U.S. state of Kansas, US-81 is a main north-south highway central part of the state. Wichita is the only metropolitan area US-81 serves in the state but the highway does serve several other larger towns in Kansas such as (from south to north) Wellington and Concordia. Route description US-81 at US-166's western terminus Nearly all of US-81 in Kansas is either freeway or expressway. The route enters Kansas as a two-lane near Caldwell. From South Haven to Wichita it closely parallels Interstate 35, which is also known as the Kansas Turnpike in that area. After South Haven, the only town of any significance along US 81 until Wichita is Wellington, which is just west of the Turnpike along U.S. Route 160. US-81 concurrent with I-135 and K-15 At Wichita, US-81 joins Interstate 135. The two highways remain joined until Salina, with I-135's mile markers taking precedence. Interstate 135 ends at Interstate 70 but US-81 continues as a freeway to Minneapolis, then as an expressway passing through Concordia before exiting the state north of Belleville. All but of US-81's alignment is maintained by KDOT. The entire section within Wellington is maintained by the city. The section within Wichita from the south city limit to I-135 is maintained by the city. The entire section within Concordia is maintained by the city. History US-81 at the north end of I-135 at I-70 The alignment of US-81 from Wichita to Salina prior to the completion Interstate 135 is fully intact. The prior alignment ran from where current US-81 breaks off for Interstate 135 at 47th street, north through Wichita along Broadway street. Old US-81 roughly parallels Interstate 135 to Newton. Old US-81 follows current K-15 through Newton between an interchange with US-50 and Hesston Road, where old US-81 breaks northwest onto Hesston road. Old US-81 then travels through the small Kansas towns of Hesston, Moundridge, and Elyria, before turning to the north, and going through the town of McPherson as Main street. North of McPherson, old US-81 continues to Lindsborg, where it follows current K-4 until an interchange with Interstate 135. Old US-81 passes under Interstate 135 and continues to parallel it about 1/2 mile to the east. Old US-81 then travels through Assaria, where it encounters another brief overlap with K-4 and K-104. Old US-81 continues through the city of Salina as Ninth street. North of Salina, Old US-81 encounters brief overlaps with K-143 and K-18. Old US-81 follows K-106 to an interchange with current US-81, where the two alignments are joined back together. In a June 8, 1960 resolution, K-225 was assigned from US-81 east to I-35W (modern I-135). K-225 became a section of US-81 by 1979, when US-81 was moved from its former alignment in Wichita to run along I-135. K-226 was first designated as a state highway in a March 8, 1961 resolution. The highway remained the same, then between 1979 and 1981, US-81 had been realigned onto I-35W and at this time K-226 was decommissioned. In an August 24, 1966 resolution, a section of the new I-35W was to be built south of Lindsborg. At this time, K-155 was proposed to connect US-81 to the new I-35W. This plan was later cancelled in a March 29, 1961 meeting, when US-81 was realigned onto I-35W to current exit 72, then west along the proposed K-155 (modern Smoky Valley Road) to the old US-81 alignment. From Salina to the Nebraska state line, the highway is named the Frank Carlson Memorial Highway, in honor of the late Senator Frank Carlson. Senator Carlson was a native of Concordia who represented Kansas in the U.S. Senate from 1951-1969. Before serving in the Senate, he was Governor of Kansas from 1947–1950.

He was born in Alexanderwohl, Southern Russia. Voth was sent by the Mission Board of the General Conference Mennonite Church to work among the Arapaho and the Hopi people. Life and career Voth learned the Arapaho language and customs at Darlington, Indian Territory, near Fort Reno, where he worked from June 1882 to January 1892. Voth was made superintendent in 1884. He married Barbara Baer from the mission the same year, they had a daughter, Frieda. His wife died in 1889. Voth married Martha Moser, who had also worked at Darlington, in 1892 and they both went to work at Oraibi with the 3rd mesa Hopi, Northern Arizona the next year. Martha Voth died in 1901. Henry Voth had witnessed the Ghost Dance revivalism among his Arapaho congregation. He collected objects and later sold them to the Bureau of American Ethnology.

His closest collaboration was with George A. Dorsey from Chicago. The Field Museum published Voth's series of precise descriptions of Hopi ceremonies and folklore, illustrated with his Kodak No. 1 photographs. Voth was one of very few non native writers on the Hopi fluent in the Hopi language. Among his papers at Bethel College are his studies in the Arapaho language, Hopi religion, and a Hopi dictionary. Voth left the Hopi and the Heathen Mission field in 1903. He married Katie Hershler in 1906 and from 1914 to 1927 served the Zoar Mennonite Church in Goltry, Oklahoma as its resident minister.

She is a distinguished scientist at Microsoft Research. Early life and education Dwork received her B.S.E. from Princeton University in 1979, graduating Cum Laude, and receiving the Charles Ira Young Award for Excellence in Independent Research. Dwork received her Ph.D. from Cornell University in 1983 for research supervised by John Hopcroft. Career and research Dwork is known for her research placing privacy-preserving data analysis on a mathematically rigorous foundation, including the co-invention of differential privacy, a strong privacy guarantee frequently permitting highly accurate data analysis (with McSherry, Nissim, and Smith, 2006). The differential privacy definition provides guidelines for preserving the privacy of people who may have contributed data to a dataset, by adding small amounts of noise either to the input data or to outputs of computations performed on the data. She uses a systems-based approach to studying fairness in algorithms including those used for placing ads. Dwork has also made contributions in cryptography and distributed computing, and is a recipient of the Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize for her early work on the foundations of fault-tolerant systems. Her contributions in cryptography include Nonmalleable Cryptography with Danny Dolev and Moni Naor in 1991, the first lattice-based cryptosystem with Miklós Ajtai in 1997, which was also the first public-key cryptosystem for which breaking a random instance is as hard as solving the hardest instance of the underlying mathematical problem (\\"worst-case/average-case equivalence\\").

It was released as a single in 1997 on 7\\" vinyl, limited to 500 copies. The song appeared on the duo's debut album Northern Star and again on their second album, Vertigo, released in April 1999.  Production and content  The song was written and produced whilst the duo were staying in a cottage in Ambleside in the Lake District, writing material for their first album. A sample of Patti Page's \\"Old Cape Cod\\" forms the basis of the song: the lines \\"If you're fond of sand dunes and salty air/Quaint little villages here and there\\", sung in Page's multi-tracked close-harmony, is repeated throughout the song, with the addition of synthesizer bass and slowed-down drum programming. The band found \\"Old Cape Cod\\" when they bought a 1950s compilation album from a bargain bin in a shop in Ambleside for 50p. Tom Findlay suggested that the use of only one section of the song's lyric left the track open to interpretation, \\"giving it a slightly eerie, melancholy quality\\", although he admitted that this wasn't by design but because the sampler they were using could only record ten seconds of audio at a time. A blues-style trombone solo inspired by the spiritual song \\"At the River\\" was performed by Andy Cato to produce a more chill-out track. According to Cato the only reason he had taken his trombone to the Lake District was because he wanted to practice before an upcoming jazz concert: when he wanted to record the trombone melody, he had to improvise a microphone by swapping around the wires in a speaker from the cottage's Alba hi-fi as the duo didn't have a microphone with them and were staying in a remote location. Cato credited this as giving the recording \\"a real vintage character\\".  Release  \\"At the River\\" was originally released as a single on 7\\" vinyl in 1997 in a limited pressing of 500 copies, and appeared on the duo's debut album Northern Star as well as its follow-up, Vertigo, in 1999. Rob da Bank made it his single of the week in DJ Mag: he subsequently handed a copy to Zoe Ball, who started playing it on The Radio 1 Breakfast Show. Although the BBC Radio 1 playlist committee initially believed the song was too slow for radio, support from radio producers and listeners meant that it forced its way into rotation. On 26 July 1999, the single was re-released on 12\\" and CD. This re-release peaked at number 19 in the UK Singles Chart. It was used in adverts for Marks & Spencer Food in 2006, and in the films About Time and The Low Down.

In 2001, the title of the Diocese of Jamaica was extended to include ‘and the Cayman Islands’ to recognise the growth of the Anglican Church in those islands, which had become part of the diocese of Jamaica in the 1960s. __TOC__ History Cathedral of St Jago de la Vega The Church of England arrived in Jamaica after the conquest of the Spanish-held island by Britain in the seventeenth century. The first Anglican clergymen arrived in 1664, by which time the island had been divided into 7 parishes. The first church was built between 1661 and 1664. This was the church of St Catherine in Spanish Town, constructed on the site of the earlier Spanish Church of the Red Cross, which had been destroyed by the fighting between 1655 and 1660. Other churches followed in the parishes of St Andrew (Half-Way-Tree), Vere (Alley), Port Royal, St David's (Yallahs), St Thomas in the East (Morant Bay), St John's (Guanaboa Vale), St Dorothy's (Old Harbour) and Clarendon (Chapleton). Prior to the creation of the Diocese of Jamaica in 1824, the island's churches were under the notional jurisdiction of the Bishop of London. Practicality meant that in reality it was dominated by the local administration and planter elite and failed to gain the support of the slave population. Christopher Lipscomb, with no local loyalties, was sent over to change the situation. During his 19 years as Bishop of Jamaica, Lipscomb firmly established the Anglican Church on the island, ordaining 73 deacons and 66 priests, consecrating 31 churches and licensing 41 other buildings for worship, and attracting much of the slave class into the congregation. His successor, Aubrey Spencer, continued his evangelical work, converting St Catherine's church in 1843 to the Diocesan Cathedral of St Jago de la Vega and establishing three Archdeaconries (Cornwall, Middlesex and Surrey). In 1866, Courtenay was coadjutor Bishop of Kingston, and there were three archdeaconries: William Rowe was \\"Archdeacon and Commissary for Cornwall\\", Thomas Stewart for Surrey, and J. William Acting for Middlesex.The Clergy List for 1866 (London: George Cox, 1866) p. 452 Bishops Christopher Lipscomb The bishops of the diocese have included: “Who was Who” 1897-2007 London, A & C Black, 2007 Who’s Who 2008 (London, A & C Black, 2008 #Christopher Lipscomb 1824–1843 #Aubrey George Spencer 1843–1872 #:Courtenay was consecrated coadjutor Bishop of Kingston in 1856 #Reginald Courtenay 1872–79 #William George Tozer 1879–1880 #Enos Nuttall 1880–1916 #:A.

It comprises seven halls of residence (Ferens, Lambert, Nicholson, Morgan, Downs, Reckitt and Grant) and the Lawns Centre. The latter was the complex's catering and social hub. The halls accommodated almost 1,000 students. In March 2019 it was announced that the Lawns would be closed as student accommodation in the next academic year. Description The Lawns halls are set in of landscaped parkland, dominated by large sports pitches. There is also a large car park on site and a police station at the main entrance. Of the seven halls on the site, Ferens is of a traditional rectangular 'Sandhurst block style' with the accommodation around three sides of a central lawn. It is somewhat isolated from the other halls both by its location and by a natural screen of trees. Each of the other halls, which were designed by the architectural firm Gillespie, Kidd and Coia, comprises five blocks identified by the letters A to E, and accommodates approximately 140 residents. A typical block configuration was three floors, with each floor accommodating nine students in seven rooms. The lawns were developed on the grounds of the former Cottingham Grange, which had been used as an army camp in the Second World War; the nearby Ferens Hall was originally known as 'Camp Hall'. The Lawns has its own bus stop in the car park and is the terminating route for services 103/105, which run to the university and terminate at Hull Paragon Interchange. =The Lawns Centre= The dining hall in 2017 The Lawns Centre has recently had a £2.5m refurbishment after flooding in Cottingham.

Most rooms have a sun terrace. Before 1985, Downs Hall offered accommodation to male students only. However, due to a decline in preference for an all-male hall, at the start of the 1985 year (autumn of 1984), Downs Hall was open to both male and female students. The hall was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1993 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. The hall closed at the end of the 2017-2018 academic year. =Morgan Hall= Morgan Hall was the third hall of the planned 12 halls of residence upon the Lawns Complex. Morgan Hall takes its name from the first principle of Hull University College Arther Morgan. The Hall has 133 single rooms, most with balconies. The hall was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1993 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. =Nicholson Hall= Nicholson Hall Nicholson Hall was the fifth hall of the planned 12 halls of residence upon the Lawns Complex. It takes its name from the principal of Hull University College 1935 John Nicholson. John Nicholson led the campaign to achieve the college's independence, which eventuated on 13 May 1954. Nicholson Hall house's approximately 142 students in both medium and en-suite rooms. This is the only self-catered Hall on the Lawns Complex. Most rooms have washbasins and a balcony. In 2009 Nicholson Hall was re-furbished converting all double rooms to singles, updated kitchen diner kitchens similar to the Downs and Morgan Hall designs with additional en-suite facilities in particular blocks.

Committees and responsibilities From the date of inception until 1969 Halls of Residence at the University of Hull were presided over by the \\"Halls of Residence Committee\\". This committee was responsible for the day-to-day running of Traditional halls until the creation of the lawns. The committee was composed of wardens, facilities management from the university and the vice-chancellor. In 1968 at the decision of the committee the \\"Halls of Residence Committee\\" was dissolved and the council of the newly built Lawns complex (known as \\"The Lawns Forum\\") gained the responsibility of term time activity upon the Lawns complex. Financial matters and conference responsibilities all passed to the relevant departments of the University and out of the hands of the wardens.Halls of Residence Committee November 1961 – December 1968  Closure  By the start of the 2017/2018 academic year, The Lawns was the last operating halls of residence site in Cottingham following the closures of Cleminson Hall in 2004, Needler Hall in 2016, and Thwaite Hall in the summer of 2017.

It was released on April 28, 2009 by Prosthetic Records. In 2015, a reissue titled Animals as Leaders – Encore Edition was released with bonus tracks. Background Before Animals as Leaders Tosin Abasi was a member of metalcore band Reflux that had been disbanded. Reflux's former record label Prosthetic Records saw Abasi's guitar work and asked him to create a solo album for them. Abasi initially declined, feeling such an endeavor would be \\"egotistical and unnecessary\\".Allyn, Bobby (February 9, 2009). \\"Q&A;: Animals as Leaders.\\" Washington City Paper. Retrieved June 5, 2009. Afterwards, Abasi enrolled in the Atlanta Institute of Music which helped give him new creative ideas for music composition. Abasi later changed his mind saying that \\"doing a solo album seemed to make a lot more sense\\", and decided to take the label's offer. However, he did not want the project's new album to just represent the idea of one person. Abasi's school experience aided him in developing ideas for the album. While at school he learned fundamental harmony, jazz playing standards, and improved on playing classical guitar. Composition, recording and production Animals as Leaders was recorded in early 2008. Abasi recorded all guitar and bass tracks on the album; drums and various synthesized effects were programmed by engineer Misha Mansoor (Periphery, Haunted Shores). Abasi and Mansoor are credited for composing the music for all tracks on Animals as Leaders. All twelve tracks on the album are guitar driven instrumentals that are intended to showcase Abasi's guitar skills. Abasi uses techniques such as tremolo picking, sweep- picking, two-handed tapping, fingerpicking, and slapping throughout the album.
