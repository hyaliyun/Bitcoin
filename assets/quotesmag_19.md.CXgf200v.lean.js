It has a primarily technical focus, working on specifications, implementations, conferences and testing to help Linux developers improve Linux for use in CE products.  Initiatives CELF has several key initiatives, including: * a set of technical working groups, which produce specifications and implementations (usually patches against existing open source projects) to enhance Linux suitability for CE products * hosting of conferences dedicated to embedded Linux (see below) * providing hardware resources to open source developers * funding for direct feature development, via contracting with a few Linux developers * a test lab in San Jose, California, United States.  History  The forum is an outgrowth of a joint project between Sony Corporation and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. (also known as Panasonic). CELF was founded in June 2003 by several large consumer electronics companies, including Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd., Sony Corporation, Hitachi Ltd., NEC Corporation, Royal Philips Electronics, Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., Sharp Corporation, and Toshiba Corporation. As of 2009 CELF has about 30 members, consisting of consumer electronics manufacturers, semiconductor vendors, and Linux software companies. Membership ARM Ltd., AXE, Inc., Broadcom, Canon Inc., ETRI, Fujitsu Limited, Fuji-Xerox, Hewlett-Packard, Hitachi, Ltd., IBM, Intel Corporation, JustSystems Corporation, LG Electronics, Lineo Solutions, Inc, Panasonic Corporation, MIPS Technologies, NEC Corporation, NXP Semiconductors, Renesas, Royal Philips Electronics, Samsung Electronics, Selenic Consulting, Sharp Corporation, SnapGear, Sony Corporation, Toshiba Corporation, Yamaha CorporationCE Linux membership list  Technical working groups and output  As of 2007, CELF had the following technical working groups: # Audio, Video and Graphics # Bootup Time # Digital Television Profile # Memory Management # Mobile Phone Profile # Power Management # Real Time # Security # System Size These working groups collect improvements to Linux and Linux-related software from CELF members, and help members coordinate on projects to enhance Linux in their respective technical areas. The forum encourages its members to submit technical output directly back to the relevant open source project (for example, by sending enhancements to the Linux kernel directly to the Linux kernel mailing list, or to an appropriate technology- or architecture-specific mailing list.) Collected information and forum output is primarily located on the forum's wiki for embedded developers  Community Projects  The CE Linux Forum also has sponsorships to bring embedded projects to fruition. Thanks to grants from CELF, amongst others the LinuxTiny patches and the LogFS and SquashFS flash file systems have been pushed to mainline Linux. CELF hosts the eLinux.org wiki, a wiki dedicated to Embedded Linux.  Conferences and jamborees  The forum has been the driving force behind the Embedded Linux Conference since 2005. Originally started as a conference in the US in spring, there now also is a yearly ELC Europe in the Autumn time frame. Both conferences are very developer-focused and usually attract 150-200 Linux engineers. ELC is an English-language conference with several parallel tracks and lasts 2 or 3 days. The European conference has always been co-hosted: in 2007 it was hosted with the Real-time Linux Workshop in Linz, Austria; in 2008 with the NLUUG in Ede, Netherlands; and in 2009 with Embedded Systems Week in Grenoble. The 2009 and 2010 spring conferences in the Americas were co-organized with the Linux Foundation. CELF sponsored the Linux Symposium from 2004 to 2008, hosting BoFs and sessions specific to embedded use of Linux and development of Linux capabilities for embedded use. In Japan and Korea, CELF organizes Technical Jamborees every two months. Jamborees are smaller, have a single track, and are held in the local language.

It is usually made out of wood and embellished with decorative aspects such as intricate carving or painting, and is gilded as well. They were common in Renaissance Tuscany. No examples of Florentine sets of spalliere with inset paintings have survived intact. At the most expensive level, all four walls of a room seem to have had panels fitted, which were richly decorated with carved wood, marquetry, and sometimes paintings inset into the wood.

After undertaking art studies, he was a staff member at The Philadelphia Times and the Boston Herald. He also contributed to publications including Scribner's and Harper's.  Biography  Bailey was born in Camden, New Jersey. At the age of 15, Bailey became a student at the Pennsylvania Museum School of Art in Philadelphia. \\"A year later one of his drawings of flowers was accepted for the annual exhibition of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts where he later studied. In addition to these schools he also had the chance to study at Royal College of Art, London; Academie de l‚Äôecluse, and Acadmie Bilouil, Paris, France. Deciding that ‚Äúhe wanted to see great events and make pictures of them,‚Äù he joined the art staff of The Philadelphia Times in 1892 and two years later went to The Boston Herald. He found plenty of action for his pencil in the life of the city-crime, court trials, fires, and shipwrecks-and in the political conventions of 1900.**\\" \\"From 1892-1901 he was a staff artist on the Philadelphia Times and the Boston Herald, to later contribute to Scribner's, Harper's, The Century, Everybody's and other leading, The Harper's Weekly, Leslies Weekly and Colliers. Throughout this experience he had to travel extensively. In 1902 he represented the Boston Herald as special artist at the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in London. Then in 1907 he visited Paris, London, Italy, and Germany as a special staff artist for Harper's Magazine. Upon the entry of the United States into World War I in 1917, Bailey was the first artist authorized to make drawings of navy yards, gun shops and munition plants ***.\\" \\"The drawings that he did were later published and exhibited in art museums widely and won Bailey the Official Thanks of Josephus Daniel the former Secretary of the Navy **.\\" These drawings were later acquired by the Smithsonian Institution and a set of prints was installed in the French War Museum, Paris **.\\" After this expedition, Bailey traveled extensively throughout Spain. He completed his tour in 1921, after traveling cities and small towns all over the country capturing the landscapes and scenes in watercolors and drawings. In 1925 he did another Spanish tour and later this collection of 150 drawings was turned into a published book, \\"Little Known Towns of Spain.\\" This book received a great amount of attention in addition to the royal decree of thanks from King Alphonso XIII of Spain. Within the book was the following write-up: \\"At a meeting, in Paris, of Agnacio Zuloaga and Vernon Howe Bailey, Senor Zuloga having highly complimented Mr. Bailey on his work in Spain said, ‚ÄúBut when I saw your book of watercolors and drawings of Spain, I was angry with you, for you have disclosed to the world the names of Spanish towns of which I hoped it would never learn, for the tourists will spoil them and gone will be their true character, and the life and the old costumes I have loved to paint will have vanished. Within fifteen years Spain will have been spoiled for me.‚Äù For with adventuresome spirit and disregarding the hardships of primitive modes of travel and the meagre accommodations of small inns, Vernon Howe Bailey had struck out from customary main travelled roads, to investigate and picture whatever those remote, delectable, and unsung towns of the back-country might disclose for his pencil. The drawings and paintings of Vernon Howe Bailey have been well known for many years through publication in leading magazines and exhibition in museums. Their Individuality and distinctive character has won the high approval of critics and connoisseurs of this country and Europe. Having travelled extensively in the United States, England, France, Germany and Italy, Bailey seeking fresh subject decided in 1921 to see Spain, where during the summer of that year he made a considerable tour, visiting its largest cities and some provincial capitals and smaller towns. Spain captivated him, and each day was devoted to expressing the varied subjects and medieval atmosphere of some thirty towns. How well he succeeded was attested by the purchase of his entire collection of one hundred and fifty drawings by the Hispanic Society of America for the permanent collections of its museum in New York; and he was elected a corresponding member of that Society. To the delights of Spain‚Äôs smaller towns, Bailey was particularly responsive, causing him to resolve that one day he would return and visit more of them. This he did several years later, when by such means of transportation as was readily at hand-primitive motor buses, great two-wheeled mule carts, and at times astride a burro - he went far into the interior to towns often difficult of access. His wanderings having begun in Catalonia, led southward into the provinces of central Spain, to the Mediterranean and down that coast into Murcia and across Granada to the far westerly province of Estremadura, bordering the Portuguese frontier, thence into northern Spain and back to his starting point, making an almost complete circuit of the country. This long period of travel represented intensive work in forty more towns, and it is they, their castle-crowned heights, their cathedrals, palaces, plazas, and bridges which compose his present exhibition. His Excellency Merry del Val, former Spanish Ambassador to Great Britain wrote of this collection of Mr. Bailey‚Äôs work, ‚ÄúIt tells more of Spain and her spirit than a hundred volumes.‚Äù During his exhibition in Madrid, under the auspices of the Duke of Alba, His Majesty Alfonso XIII attended the exhibition and honored Mr. Bailey with a Royal Decree of Thanks in appreciation of his work in Spain; further recognition was evidence in his election as a corresponding member in the distinguished Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, Madrid, the fourth American to be so honored. The Old Spain is passing and, as Zuloaga predicts, will soon have vanished, but in these watercolors and drawings its ancient and highly picturesque towns will remain, vividly recorded. In anticipation of an extended sojourn abroad, the collection at hand has been entrusted to these Galleries by Mr. Bailey, who has made it possible for the works included to be offered at prices far lower than previously. On Tuesday afternoon, January 5, the opening day of the exhibition, Mr. Bailey will give an informal talk on his roamings in those fascinating and unexploited towns, whose charm his pencil has caught forever. The exhibition will continue until the 23rd of January.***\\" Bailey's special subject were city streets, landscapes, buildings and maritime scenes in Europe and America. The best known of his drawings are his sketches in pencil of London, his watercolor and drawings of Spain and his drawings of skyscrapers in New York City. Bailey was the first artist privileged by the United States government on the declaration of war to make drawings of navy yards, munition factories, and other centres of war work, as mentioned. These drawings appeared in exhibitions and were published in the leading magazines throughout the country. The collections he created in Spain were later bought by The Hispanic Society, and were shown in the Mus√©e de la Guerre of France contains a collection of lithographs of American war subjects. Besides his work as a newspaper artist in London and America, Bailey illustrated many books. Once returning to the United States the series of lithograph studies of New York skyscrapers in 1927 that Bailey did were later exhibited in London under the patronage of the Dutchess of Rutland****.\\" After exhibition in London, the drawings were taken to the National Library and Museums in Madrid under the auspices of the Duke of Alba. The exhibition was opened by King Alfonso XIII, who issued him a Royal Decree of Thanks, and he was elected a Corresponding Member of the Royal Academy of Find Arts of San Fernando **.\\" Another significant moment in Bailey's life was the time when he had the chance to be the only artist permitted to produce a comprehensive collection of drawings of the Pope's private apartments. This project took Bailey a year and during this amazing experience he was able to choose whatever composition and subject he wanted. He created over 100 watercolors and drawings. Later the collection was exhibited in the American Art Asso- Anderson Galleries in New York.  Gallery  File:Charleston, the place and the people, by St. Julien Ravenel.

Denver Seminary is a private, Evangelical Christian seminary with its main campus in Littleton, Colorado and extension campuses in Washington, DC and South Korea. It offers Master of Arts, Master of Divinity, Doctor of Ministry, and Master of Theology degrees and has enrollment of about 900 students. Denver Seminary adheres to the National Association of Evangelicals Statement of Faith. History Denver Seminary was founded in 1950 by members of the newly founded Conservative Baptist Association. This is a group of churches that separated from the Northern Baptist Convention over theological differences stemming from the Fundamentalist‚ÄìModernist Controversy conflict earlier in the twentieth century. The school was originally known as the Conservative Baptist Theological Seminary and, in 1982, changed its name to Denver Conservative Baptist Seminary. The school changed its name again in 1998 to Denver Seminary to reflect its growing appeal to a wide-spectrum of evangelical students. Students are required to sign the statement of faith used by the National Association of Evangelicals. Dr. Carey Thomas became the Seminary's first president in 1950. In 1956, Dr. Vernon Grounds was appointed as the second president and remained so until 1979. During his tenure, Vernon Grounds was responsible for initiating, directing, and managing the Seminary's extensive growth and progress. In June 1962, Denver Seminary was granted associate membership in the American Association of Theological Schools (now the Association of Theological Schools). Full accreditation was achieved in the Association of Theological Schools in 1971 and in the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools in 1972. Forty-one years after Denver Seminary's inception (1991) the student body numbered over five hundred students who came from forty states, fifty-three denominations, and fifteen countries. In 1996, Dr. Clyde McDowell, the fifth president, pioneered the groundbreaking effort behind becoming the first seminary ever to receive accreditation by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs (CACREP) for its counseling degree program. Additionally, Dr. McDowell reinvented the school's approach to seminary education by incorporating an intensive, contextualized mentoring experience into its core curriculum‚Äîa program of training and mentoring for which Denver Seminary has become well known. In 2005, under the leadership of President Craig Williford, Denver Seminary moved from the Englewood, Colorado location to a new campus in Littleton, Colorado where the school currently resides. Built from the ground up specifically for the Seminary, the campus features an academic/leadership training center; a learning resource center (home to the library and student center); an administrative building, which includes the Shepherd's Gate Counseling Center; and nearly 100 student apartments. The campus is situated next to the historic South Platte River with views of the Rocky Mountains and access to running and biking trails along the river. In 2002, Senior Professor of Church History Bruce Shelley authored a biography on Grounds titled Transformed by Love:The Vernon Grounds Story. This book gives a comprehensive overview of Denver Seminary's history as it developed from a small denominational school to a major evangelical seminary under Grounds' leadership. =Presidents= The following men have served in the presidency of Denver Seminary: 1\\\\. Carey S. Thomas, 1950-56 2\\\\. Vernon C. Grounds, 1956-1979 3\\\\. Haddon Robinson, 1979-1991 4\\\\. Edward L. Hayes, 1993-1996 5\\\\. Clyde McDowell, 1996-1999 6\\\\.

Mark Young, 2009‚Äìpresent  Accreditation  Denver Seminary is accredited by Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada, Higher Learning Commission, the Association for Clinical Pastoral Education, and the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs (CACREP).  Theological stance  The evangelical theological stance of Denver Seminary is captured by the words of the late chancellor Vernon Grounds: > Here is no unanchored liberalism, freedom to think without commitment. Here > is no encrusted dogmatism, commitment without freedom to think. Here is a > vibrant evangelicalism, commitment with freedom to think within the limits > laid down in Scripture. This statement was first used by Grounds to stake out Denver Seminary's theological position in the midst of conflict between moderately conservative and ultra-conservative factions of the Conservative Baptist Association that eventually led the ultra-conservative faction to withdraw from the CBA and found the Conservative Baptist Fellowship (CBF). Grounds, formerly the academic dean of fundamentalist Baptist seminary in New York state affiliated with the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches, eventually became a key spokesperson for the evangelical movement that attributes its roots to the writings of Carl F. H. Henry. Under his leadership, Denver Seminary became firmly rooted in this theological camp.  Publications  Since 1998, Old Testament professor Richard Hess has edited the Denver Journal: An Online Review of Current Biblical and Theological Studies. This is primarily an electronic journal that provides Denver Seminary faculty an opportunity to publish book reviews on the latest theological scholarship. Engage Magazine is published biannually since 2013. The magazine features articles written by faculty addressing current topics in the church and ministry as well as stories of students and alumni. It is distributed to Denver Seminary alumni, students, staff, faculty, donors, and friends.  Library  The Carey S. Thomas library is the largest evangelical protestant library between Chicago and Los Angeles. It is composed of volumes carefully selected to provide the best in theological and scholarly literature as an undergirding for the school's curriculum. The present collection totals approximately 185,000 volumes, both in print and electronic format, and is located in the main library in Littleton, Colorado and in the extension campus libraries in Washington DC and West Texas.

As the senior physician responsible for the mental observation ward at the Central Middlesex Hospital he described and named Munchausen syndrome in a 1951 article in The Lancet. Personal life Richard Asher was born to the Reverend Felix Asher and his wife Louise (n√©e Stern). He married Margaret Augusta Eliot at St Pancras' Church, London on 27 July 1943,GRO Register of Marriages: September 1943 1b 4 Pancras - Asher = Eliot whereupon his father-in-law gave him a complete set of the Oxford English Dictionary, which doctor and medical ethicist Maurice Pappworth alleged was the source of Asher's \\"accidental\\" reputation as a medical etymologist. They had three children: Peter Asher (born 1944), a member of the pop duo Peter & Gordon and later record producer, Jane Asher (born 1946), a film and TV actress and novelist, and Clare Asher (born 1948), a radio actress. Richard Asher's brother Thomas married Margaret's sister, Susan.Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 107th edition, vol. 3, ed. Charles Mosley, Burke's Peerage Ltd, 2003, p. 3482 The Asher family home above his private consulting rooms at 57 Wimpole Street was briefly notable when Paul McCartney lived there in 1964‚Äì66 during his relationship with Jane Asher. In 1964 Asher suddenly gave up his hospital post and perhaps all medical activities. He suffered from depression in later life and reportedly died by suicide at the age of 57. Ideas and reputation Asher was regarded as \\"one of the foremost medical thinkers of our times\\", who emphasised the need \\"to be increasingly critical of our own and other people's thinking\\". Asher was particularly concerned that \\"many clinical notions are accepted because they are comforting rather than because there is any evidence to support them\\".Talking Sense quoted in Asher was hailed as a pioneer in challenging the value of excessive bed rest following treatment, and argued that the Pel‚ÄìEbstein fever (a fever characteristic for Hodgkin's disease) was an example of a condition that exists only because it has a name. They cite Asher's lecture Making Sense (Lancet 1959;2:359) Asher's 1949 paper \\"Myxoedematous Madness\\" alerted a generation of physicians to the interaction between the brain and the thyroid gland. As a result, young and elderly psychiatric patients are now screened for thyroid malfunction. Some of the 'madness' cases are now thought to be the early descriptions of Hashimoto's encephalopathy, a rare neuroendocrine syndrome sometimes presenting with psychosis. Notable articles Asher is remembered today mostly for his \\"refreshingly provoking\\" articles which \\"sparkle with sequins--his own aphorisms, imaginary dialogue, fantasies, quotations.\\" Ruth Holland's introduction to A Sense of Asher, quoted in He thought that medical writing should provide \\"useful, understandable, and practical knowledge instead of allotov-words-2-obscure-4-any-1,2-succidin-understanding-them.\\" Anthologies of his articles were well-received, with the Talking Sense collection being described as \\"still the best advice on medical writing.\\" Notable articles include: *The Dangers of Going to Bed (1947) - \\"one of the most influential medical papers ever written\\" *The Seven Sins of Medicine (1949, in Lancet 1949 Aug 27;2(6574):358-60) *Myxoedematous Madness (1949) *Munchausen‚Äôs syndrome (1951, in Lancet 1951 Feb 10;1(6650):339-41) *Respectable Hypnosis (1956) *Why Are Medical Journals So Dull?

When focusing on a certain quotation, one must interpret it within its scope. Nested quotation can be used in literature (as in nested narration), speech, and computer science (as in \\"meta\\"-statements that refer to other statements as strings). Nested quotation can be very confusing until evaluated carefully and until each quotation level is put into perspective. In literature In languages that allow for nested quotes and use quotation mark punctuation to indicate direct speech, hierarchical quotation sublevels are usually punctuated by alternating between primary quotation marks and secondary quotation marks. For a comprehensive analysis of the major quotation mark systems employed in major writing systems, see Quotation mark. In JavaScript programming Nested quotes often become an issue using the eval keywordhttps://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_eval.asp. The eval function is a function that converts and interprets a string as actual JavaScript code, and runs that code. If that string is specified as a literal, then the code must be written as a quote itself (and escaped accordingly). For example: eval(\\"var a=3; alert();\\"); This code declares a variable a, which is assigned the value 3, and a blank alert window is popped up to the user. =Nested strings (level 2)= Suppose we had to make a quote inside the quoted interpreted code. In JavaScript, you can only have one unescaped quote sublevel, which has to be the alternate of the top-level quote. If the 2nd-level quote symbol is the same as the first- level symbol, these quotes must be escapedhttps://www.w3schools.com/js/js_strings.asp. For example: alert(\\"I don't need to escape here\\"); alert('Nor is it \\"required\\" here'); alert('But now I do or it won\\\\'t work'); =Nested strings (level 3 and beyond)= Furthermore, (unlike in the literature example), the third-level nested quote must be escaped in order not to conflict with either the first- or second-level quote delimiters. This is true regardless of alternating-symbol encapsulation. Every level after the third level must be recursively escaped for all the levels of quotes in which it is contained. This includes the escape character itself, the backslash (‚Äú\\\\‚Äù), which is escaped by itself (‚Äú\\\\\\\\\\\\‚Äù). For every sublevel in which a backslash is contained, it must be escaped for the level above it, and then all the backslashes used to escape that backslash as well as the original backslash, must be escaped, and so on and so forth for every level that is ascended. This is to avoid ambiguity and confusion in escaping. Here are some examples that demonstrate some of the above principles: document.write(\\" Hello, this is the body of the document.\\"); document.writeln(\\" \\"); document.write(\\" A newline in HTML code acts simply as whitespace, whereas a <br> starts a new line.\\"); document.write(\\" \\"); eval('eval(\\\\\\"eval(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"alert(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Now I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'m confused!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\")'); Note that the number of backslashes increase from 0 to 1 to 3 to 7 to 15, indicating a rule for successively nested symbols.

Background The play had its debut in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania in July 2006 at the Arts YOUniverse center for the applied and living arts. The production was under the direction of Paul Winarski and starred Greg Korin as the Archbishop. After several revisions by the director and author the play was remounted in Scranton in February 2007 at the Old Brick Theatre. It is a one-man dramatization of events in the life of Catholic Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, whose shady tenure as head of the Vatican Bank included suspicions of money laundering, Ponzi schemes, and even assassination. The original production while well received, underwent several script revisions by the author and director in order to streamline the piece. The revised version which opened in Scranton ran 15 minutes shorter and is now considered the final version of the play. A Las Vegas production of the play is also in the planning with original star Greg Korin. Plot The play takes place in a small office in what may be purgatory, but looks very much like the archbishop's office in Sun City, Arizona, his last residence as a retired man of the cloth. Marcinkus relates directly to the audience stories from his youth, growing up in Al Capone's Chicago and how he eventually became a priest. As the piece unfolds he tell his version of the Vatican Bank Scandal, his appointment as head of the bank, the death of Pope John Paul I, and his job as \\"bulldog\\" to Pope John Paul II. Although dramatic, the piece is lightened by the humor that Flannery has instilled in his version of Marcinkus, who was popularly quoted as saying You can't run the church on Hail Marys . Reaction The niece of Archbishop Marcinkus, afraid that the play would be a hatchet job on her uncle, contacted playwright Flannery, who sent her a copy of the text. Not only did she agree that the play was a balanced look at her uncle's life, but even offered a few suggestions which the author included in his rewrite.

An anime adaptation was released in January 2004 in Japan, replacing Explosive Shoot Beyblade G Revolution in its 18:00 timeslot. It premiered in the United States in April 2005. Like its predecessor, it is themed around an enhanced version of a traditional children's game ‚Äì whereas Beyblade was based around spinning tops, Battle B-Daman is a dramatized version of marbles. It is the first show of the B-Daman series to be dubbed in English. In Japan, the second season, titled , was superseded by Crash B-Daman, a new series with an all new cast and story. The toyline was originally manufactured by Takara and was licensed by Hasbro for release in United States and by Sonokong for release in South Korea. The initial design of the B-Daman series was based on Bomberman (hence the name of the original version of the toy: \\"Bomberman B-Daman\\"), but the belt buckle was replaced with a \\"marble\\". The manga is published in English by Chuang Yi.  Gameplay  Like other creature-based anime and manga, Battle B-Daman focuses on numerous in-universe games: * Six wall: Score points by knocking out numbered boxes. In the show, knocking out a wall tile causes a matching item to be dropped into a giant hot bowl. In the show, it is guarded by Pandoro. * Trap shooting: Shoot down target while running an obstacle course containing lakes, walls, poles. In the desert area, targets periodically disappear. In the show, it is guarded by Shigan. * Lion stage: A L-shaped stage. Player scores by firing B-DaBalls to the goal zone blocked by 2 spinning fences. This stage emphasizes rapid fire. In the show, it is guarded by Assado. * Phoenix stage: A T-shaped stage. Player scores 20 points by knocking down targets behind 2 spinning fences. This stage emphasizes rapid power. In the show, it is guarded by Joe. * Shield stage: A square stage separated by a fence, with right half separated by a spinning fence. Each half contains 3 targets. This stage emphasizes control. In the show, it is guarded by Sly. * Dragon stage: A zigzag stage with spinning fence in the middle. Player scores 1 point for every B-DaBall landed at opponent's field. This stage emphasizes rapid balance. In the show, it is guarded by Joshua. * Sword stage: A rectangle stage, played in direct hit battle rules. In the show, it is guarded by Cain. * Head to head ultimate strike: Each player fires at a rectangular formation of 5x10 pins, located at player's right end at opposite field. Winner is determined by how many pins left standing at the end of match, or who knocks out all pins in opponent's field first. In Yamato vs. Gray match, each player fires at a stage with backward moving track, with spikes at the end of each track. In Terry vs Liena match, player stands on moving wooden posts on a pool filled with vicious marine creatures. * Super ultimate strike: A game table invented by Armada involving scoring points by shooting at the moving targets at the end of the table. Between 2 ends of the table lies one of 3 obstacles that challenges different skills. Target barricades emphasize on accuracy, gate emphasize on power, and spinner emphasize on rapid fire. * Cannonball: A shot put type game of firing 5 shots to knock a giant pin furthest from starting point. * Power alley: Score points by shooting at the target at the opposite end of the table. The amount of score depends on the shot's strength. In B-Daman tournament, player competes in climbing a 100-story tower by shooting at the target, with the rate of elevation based on the score. However, a miss shot causes played to descend from the tower. * DHB: Direct Hit Battle, whoever hits the opponents B-Daman in a button below the barrel wins. This is the most commonly played variation. The following games were introduced in season 2: * Mecha B-DaBattle race/Metal Shot battle race: A game type debuted in the Merimoke village metal shot Battle B-Daman tournament. B-DaPlayer rides a hover board to navigate obstacle course, consisting column, gas, giant B-DaBall. At the end of the course, player wins prize by shooting at the target on the giant Sun Moon-doll. * Target Road: A game hosted by Mr. Penguin, which is an obstacle course for shooting down all targets within time while running to the targets. The course is guarded by Parthenon, Mr. Penguin's chief of security. * Knock down block: Player knocks down the top pyramid by knocking down underneath square blocks, arranged in pyramid formation. Winner is decided by the ability of putting the top pyramid to the circle. * Target Battle: A variant of super ultimate strike game that does not have obstacle between player and target. * Battle Royal Hockey: A variant of B-Daman Invasion, but with 5 players. A player can be defeated by shooting the puck into the slot in player's side. During the course of the match, extra puck is dropped into the B-DaBattlefield. Under Haja's modification, tear-gas bombs are dropped into B-DaBattlefield, which explode when being fired. * Spider match: A unique battle involving players standing on a suspending arena made of ropes in spider web formation.  Plot   Season 1  The show is about Yamato Delgado (Daiwa in the Japanese version), who gets the legendary Cobalt Blade. He and his friends use the sport of B-Daman to fight the Shadow Alliance (who wants to take over the world). This show takes place in the B-Da World where its inhabitants are humans, anthropomorphic animals, and robots. Using the legendary B-Daman, Yamato enters the Winners tournament organized by a group (the JBA in the Japanese version and the IBA (International B-Daman Association) in English version) to become the B-Da Champion. However, he also ends up in fights against the Shadow Alliance.  Season 2 (Fire Spirits)  After the defeat of the Shadow Alliance, Yamato is in search of special B-DaBalls called Strike Shots, which originated from shooting stars. After a fight with the mysterious Haja and obtaining his Strike Shot, the Drive Shot, Yamato then met Gunnos, a rookie B-Da Player. He got his own Strike Shot to participate in the Winners Tournament along with Yamato's old friends and rivals. But little did they know, a terrible evil is about to put the B-Da World in peril once more. Characters =Main Cast= * : :: Introduced in season one, 11-year-old Yamato is the main character. Raised by cats until the age of 5, his foster mother did not allow him to own a B-Daman until Cobalt Blade appeared to him one fateful night. Cobalt Blade, supposedly the best B-Daman ever made. But it gets heavily damaged by Cain McDonnell, one of Yamato's enemies. Following its near destruction, Cobalt Blade is rebuilt as Cobalt Saber, the first B-Daman to use the newly developed Blaster Core (also known as Delta core) system by Armada. This new system allowed the very core of the B-Daman to be modified. Yamato's special attack is Cobalt Power Blast, a powerful attack that utilizes the friction of the battlefield. Yamato somehow looks like a cat. He is most likely named after the powerful Japanese battleship Yamato. In the second season of the anime and second half of the manga, Yamato's Strike Shot is the Drive Shot for his new B-Daman called Cobalt Saber Fire, which would later be upgraded to Cobalt Blaster with the Cartridge system and the Stealth Drive Shot until the final episode in which Cobalt Blaster transformed into Cobalt Blaster Drive Cannon with the R.C. system and the Legend Drive Shot. In the manga, Yamato already begun with having a B-Daman named Cobalt Sword which would be upgraded to Cobalt Blade. * : :: He is Yamato's friend and is a tough guy. He was a member of the Shadow Alliance because he was trying to save his sister Liena from them. He uses the B-Daman, Chrome Zephyr which is later upgraded to Chrome Raven then Chrome Raven Cyclone, Chrome Harrier and then Chrome Windrush Harrier (Chrome Lancer). Grey started appearing in season 1. He is 12 years old. His Strike Shot is the Speed Shot. * : :: Bull has three personalities: The calm and naive side, the confident side and the wild side that appears when he presents his B-Daman. This dark side remains until the end of a B-DaBattle and can enter a berserker state where he's practically invincible. He uses the B-Daman, Helio Breaker which later gets destroyed and he decides to be a B-Daman mechanic. Later on, he creates Helio Berserker and Helio Flyer which is either from the Delta Core or the Roller Core. Bull started appearing in season 1. He is 11 years old. In season one, Bull met a girl. She only likes Bull's hyper-form and when she learnt that the 'calm' Bull is the true Bull, she lost interest in him. She later goes on to like the calm, full of snot, true Bull. In Season 2, Bull meets up with Akyulus and eventually befriends the silent boy. Bull is the first ever friend of Akyulus. Nearing the start of the second Winners Tournament, he makes a decision to be a full-time B-Da Mechanic, vowing to make Revolver Hades, the best B-Daman ever so that Akyulus could use it to defeat Yamato. * : :: He is Yamato's fellow friend under Armada. He has a Scottish accent and uses the B-Daman, Wing Ninja which was later recreated into Wing Sword and Wing Eagle. Terry started appearing in season 1. He is 10 years old. In Season 2, Terry and Joe decide to enter the Winners Tournament together but along the way, Terry finds a Strike Shot, Random Shot. Joe deems that Terry will not improve with him along so he leaves, only to find Terry following him, not wanting him to go. However, Haja hears of this Strike Shot and attacks Terry for it. The two enter into battle and Haja pretends to admit defeat. Falling for his trick, Haja snatches the Strike Shot from Terry and he shoots. It is originally aimed towards Terry but Joe steps in to protect his brother/pupil. Terry has his blaster destroyed and then gets a new one named HudoFudoMaru and his Strike Shot is the Split Shot. * : :: Yamato's foster mother, she adopted him at the age of five. She is 22 years old. She runs a restaurant called Mie's Caf√©, later on changed to Mie's Cat Cafe. For she is just only one to run her Cafe, she asked Liena, Armada and all the others to help her run her Caf√©. Then one day, she's suddenly somewhat feared by Armada because Armada always escapes his chores. And when he does that, Mie is getting almost furious. She thought that was the way in making Armada responsible! * : :: Grey's sister who was captured by the Shadow Alliance, made into a tough B-DaBattler and Ababa had her impersonate Sigma. She always wants to be at her brother's side. She took a small liking to Enjyu. She had the B-Daman, Garnet Wind which was first made for control, but had rapid fire added in its Zero 2 version. The rapid fire was added due to the new core, the Roller Core. The Roller Core had an added magazine head. The magazine head allowed you to hold 3 B-DaBalls instead of 2. The Roller Core as added to Li Yong Fa's B-Daman, King Rekuso. * Armada : :: Yamato's giant cat mentor, the legendary B-Daman master. He invented the Zero system, the framework for which all B-Daman are based upon. After Cobalt Blade was destroyed, he created the Zero 2 Blaster Core system, the framework for which Chrome Raven, Chrome Raven Cyclone, Cobalt Saber, Cobalt Saber Fire, Blazing Kaizer, Garnet Cyclone and then Zero 389. He also created the Cartridge system with Bears in the 2nd season as well as the Metal system in season 3. * Tommi :: Tommi is the black cat that follows Yamato. Marda B's good side uses him later on in the series to speak to Yamato and his friends. * B-DaMage : :: The series narrator, B-DaMage is an omnipotent being who along with her three cats, the Meowmigos (who corrects B-DaMage's mistakes) serves to explain about the world that the story takes places in, the characters, and the rules of B-Daman. She is called \\"B-Damajin\\" in the Japanese version. * Meowmigos : :: The Mewomigos are the companions of the B-DaMage. * Big Cheese : :: Little is known about this mouse except that he appears in segments with the B'DaMage and the Meowmigos. =Shadow Alliance= The Shadow Alliance (called simply \\"Shadow\\" in Japan) are the main antagonists of Season One with goals of B-DaWorld Domination. Some members of the Shadow Alliance have a 3rd eye which is the symbol of the Shadow Alliance and is a sign that the character is under Marda B.'s control. There are two incarnations of the group: There was the original and the Neo Shadow Alliance. The members of this group are as following: * Marda B. : :: Marda B. is the main villain of the 1st season who established the Shadow Alliance and Neo Shadow Alliance. Marda B. was a mysterious being who was the greatest B-DaPlayer. He was the first B-DaMaster. He was a good person, but also very competitive. When he asked for an eternal life to remain undefeated forever, he was punished by being turned into a spirit. His competitive side separated from him and became an evil spirit wanting to conquer the B-DaWorld. The good side came to live in a statue that guarded powerful B-DaBalls carrying his own essence, which became known as the B-Energy, the only thing that can defeat the evil Marda B. When Ababa had been depowered by Marda B. after being exposed as a criminal, he started the Neo Shadow Alliance, where all of the members he sent to, attack Yamato and the gang who were innocent B-DaPlayers under his control (with the exception of Enjyu, Biarce, Cain, and Joshua who joined on their own free will). Marda B.'s evil form seems to be one giant flaming eye (which is very similar in appearance to the eye of Sauron from Lord of the Rings) that always seemed to be floating in the sky. In episode 51, Marda B. fuses with Biarce to form, Marda Biarce, and reveals his plot: He sent the Shadow Alliance after Cobalt Blade, sent the Neo Shadow Alliance to collect B-DaSpirits. and even created Biarce, just so he could culminate his plan to conquer the B-DaWorld by having the ultimate B-DaBattle with Yamato. At the end of the final episode of season 1, his full good form is revealed a seemingly huge gray cat wearing in a white topki. * Ababa : :: An evil cat who worked for Marda B with the ability to brainwash people. He even managed to brainwash Bull. Ababa was the leader of the Shadow Alliance, which consisted of major characters like Grey, Enjyu, Wen, and Li. When depowered by Marda B, he is turned back into his original form, a purple cat with long hair. He makes a small cameo with the rest of the crowd, after Yamato and his friends return from defeating the Neo Shadow Alliance. * : :: Enjyu used to be a talented kid who wished to improve his skills more as a B-Daman player. His father, however wanted him to take a dive on each of his battles so his dad could pay for their rent. Before each battle, Enjyu's opponents would pay him to lose the match, making them look skilled and Enjyu, an amateur. Fed up of his life, Enjyu joined the Junior B-Daman Tournament. There he was disqualified after unfairly being accused of cheating due to his refusal to repeat his past life. After being betrayed by his only \\"friend\\", Enjyu took out his anger on his father in a B-DaBattle. As soon as the battle commenced, Enjyu's personality and hair changed from blue to red. The reason of why his hair changed color is uncertain. After the battle, Enjyu joined the Shadow Alliance where he later received Lightning Kahn (Bloody Kaiser in the original version), the brother of Cobalt Blade, as his new B-Daman. Later in the series, Lightning Kahn was upgraded to Blazing Kahn by Marda B. and later in season 2 is upgraded once more into Variable Kaiser (Hasbro never released a Cartridge System version, so the name remains unchanged), in order to defeat Yamato in the finals. However, instead of defeating him, Enjyu saved Yamato's life and quickly be-friended him. He later rejoined the Neo Shadow Alliance so that he could have fought Marda B. to avenge his new \\"friends\\". At the end of season 1, Marda B. brainwashes Enjyu, and Terry used his part of the B-Energy to set him free, but Enjyu wasn't happy about that. He was angry because he felt as if Terry wasted his B-Energy, which he could use to save the world, to save him.

Despite being hotheaded, sarcastic and limited experience, he possesses amazing skill. His first B-Daman was a rapid-fire B-Daman named Gun Breaker which was a remake of Helio Breaker from Season 1. He enters the Winners Tournament for his village as he promises them that when he left that he would go and win. After encountering Yamato, he tags along and becomes part of the regular rivalry between the two. While he is rude and obnoxious to Yamato, he is extremely polite towards others such as Terry & Joe, even bowing down to them because he thinks they are 'cool and smart,' and he saved a village from bandits using his new B-Daman, Break Ogre and his Strike Shot, the Metal Shot. He is in love with a girl named Kiko, and dislikes the daughter of the highest man in their village. Akyulus * („Ç¢„Ç≠„É•„É©„Çπ) Little is known about this boy. He has said that he is the last survivor of a clan who knows the secret of a special B-Daman move. His B-Daman was Revolver Hades. He is befriended by Bull, and slowly begins to accept him as a companion and friend. Bull then vows to make Revolver Hades, even better than Cobalt Saber Fire, in order to help Akyulus win the tournament. In the qualifying rounds of the 2nd Winners Tournament, Akyulus is Division 2 and the contestants had to navigate through a series of difficult obstacles to shoot their B-DaBall into the final hole - a B-Daman version of golf. Akyulus is the first to finish, using Revolver Hades' special spin control abilities, making him the first to qualify. In the quarter finals, the 10 contestants that made it through, are regrouped into Set A and B. Akyulus is grouped into Set A where the five contestants enter a pyramid to face three challenges. They would have to hit a hovering blue ball to pass a challenge and that would transport them to a higher level and eventually out of the pyramid. Akyulus and Enjyu are the victors of this challenge and they come out together so the first to emerge is unknown. In the semi-finals, there are only four contestants left, Yamato, Gunnos, Enjyu and Akyulas. Enjyu and Akyulas face off in a game where they must defend their goal with their B-Daman while attempting to shoot their own B-DaBalls into the opponent's goal. Each player had to score ten goals before they would be declared the winner. Akyulas easily defeats Enjyu, but not before Enjyu finally uses all his strength to score one goal - tarnishing Akyulas' perfect 10‚Äì0 to 10‚Äì1. Akyulas is said to be a legendary battler from the spirits above. In the Winners Tournament that he joined, he battled last against Yamato. And thanks to that battle, he regained some of his memories, his past. And some of that past is bad. He remembered that 100 years ago, his village was destroyed by the evil side, causing his peaceful village into complete chaos. And, as being a Legendary B-DaPlayer, he also has the power to create Strike Shots. But, when he does that, he loses some of his energy. Thanks to this ability, he attracted the attention of Beadeus and was captured, later forced to create the Ultimate Gadeaum shot. Afterwards, he was released into a dark underground dungeon where Yamato found him. However, due to the creation of the Gadeaum shot, he lost his will and became an uncontrollable, demonic fighter. Also, the Revolver Hades had been upgraded to Gatling Hades sometime during his capture, and he used it to battle and nearly defeat Yamato. However, Yamato managed to rescue him by attacking and disabling Gatling Hades with the Stealth Drive Shot, which was the proof of his and Yamato's friendship. He later on decided to be with Yamato and the gang because Beadeus had already announced to the people of the whole B-DaWorld that Yamato's side and Beadeus's side will fight. In the beginning, Yamato thought that the battle was too easy. Until he found out that the evil sealed by Akyulas's ancestors had been awakened because of the Ultimate Gadeaum Shot that Akyulas had made. Galdezer has now been fully awakened. Now because of the creature's escape, he battled alongside Yamato to defeat Galdezer. He befriends Yamato, Terry, Grey, Gunnos, and all the others later on. Now, in the final battle, it's up to Yamato to succeed. Akyulas thought about Yamato and the Ultimate Gadeaum Shot. He thought that the Strike Shot was so powerful so he thought he should make another Strike Shot that would defeat it. Shin tried to warn him that when he created another Strike Shot, it will cost him his life. He said that he would never create a Strike Shot anymore and would live a happy and peaceful life with Yamato for the rest of their lives. But when he sleeps, he dreamed about Yamato being beaten by Galdezer. He then decided to disobey Shin and create the Ultimate Drive Shot. During the next day, he didn't appear to support his newfound friend, but when Yamato was almost beaten, he then appeared and gave Yamato the Legend Drive Shot. Shin now then knew that he had created another Strike Shot when he told Yamato to use it. Shin * („Ç∑„É≥) He is a talking wolf who travels with Akyulas - seems to speak for Akyulas too. He's the one who first talked to Bull when they met. He sometimes annoys Bull, because Bull calls him a lot of names, like \\"spot\\", \\"doggie\\" and a lot of other names. He's like the secretary and speaker of Akyulas. He's the one who explained to Yamato and the gang, the past of Akyulas. Ironically, the last time Bull talked to him, Bull finally called him Shin, but he too reacted to the use of his own name as another insult coming from Bull. Haja/Scorpious * He is a scorpion-haired B-DaPlayer. Obsessed with entering tournament, he took the Random Shot from Terry and defeated Joe. After losing in the Winners Tournament, he also tried to sabotage the tournament, but was stopped by Terry. Haja eventually lost to Terry in the spider match. Fortunately for him, he was able to recover, thanks to Beadeus and his servants. His mission is supposed to be stopping Yamato and his friends from rescuing Akyulas, but Haja disobeys his \\"master\\". He then destroys Beadeus's spy machines. He later \\"hires\\" Jinbee to be his loyal servant. Yamato and his friends were unsure of where he ended up to after he tried to stop him again. He was absorbed by Galdezer so that he could have maximum power. After Yamato defeated Galdezer, he was released and promised to everyone that he would never be evil anymore, but then denied it. After that, he was struck by an asteroid. He was the last character to appear in this anime. His B-Daman is the Gale Scorpion which has a quick loading core. Yago The B-Daman smith that made Break Ogre. Kiku Yago's granddaughter is shown to have interest in Gunnos after he helps save her village. She seems to be jealous of Hana after she met her at the Winners Tournament. Aaron Toffler The bandit leader who tried to take the Break Ogre, but was defeated by Gunnos with Break Ogre and the Metal Shot. Bears * A B-Daman researcher who designed DHB advance core system. Kia A boy who saves Enjyu at the icy mountain so he can get back to the tournament. He heals Enjyu and helps him recover. Kia's robot, Loodo is killed by Enjyu when he realises the strikeshot is the chest of the robot. After that, Kia swears revenge on him and Enjyu tells him to do that he must become a strong b-da player. Later on, Kia forgives Enjyu and remains by his side at all times. Loodo * A mechanical soldier who lived with Kia, guarding Black Drive Shot. Loodo was destroyed by Enjyu during a B-DaBattle against Enjyu. Mr. Penguin A B-Daman organizer for the Target Road game. Parthenon The chief of security of the Target Road game. Madame Yang The town manager of the town with the Spike Shot. Kiba A serious B-DaPlayer who had trained with Wen and Li before entering the town with his Spike Shot and his b-daman go-tiger. He is Wen's best friend. Kiba usually hates jokes, that's why when he usually hears one, he gets really angry which is good because it increases his power. Winners Tournament * / Hanna: Hanna is a green-haired girl that had met Gunnos during a summer, and was abandoned by Gunnos when Hanna showed a bug to Gunnos. Hanna eventually met Gunnos in the Winners Tournament. When Gunnos saw her again in the Winners Tournament, Gunnos promised her that he will win for her father. Also in the Winners, Hanna and Kiku saw each other, Hanna said to Kiku that she knew Gunnos a long time before Kiku does. Hurting Kiku, and letting Kiku watch they're \\"engagement\\" and \\"wedding\\".

He was defeated by Grey. * The Black Roses of Midnight: A trio of A-block round 1 players that specializes on collaborative battle, with technique Beauty Rose. The trio were defeated by Kiba. Their move was unknown to Yamato until later on, when Armada told them. Later they joined Bedeaus and tries to stop Yamato and gang on their way to rescue Akyulus by using their newly obtained Death Cartridge system. This time they were defeated by Wen and Li using their Double Rapid fire attack. * Killer M: A-block round 1 player, in the form of killer matsutake mushroom. His specialty is to 'accidentally' knock down pillar that rival B-DaPlayer stood on.

Jinbee's Strike Shot is the Impact Shot. When Jinbee joined Beadeus (Also called \\"Master Hefai\\" by his followers), he worked as a maid for Haja when Haja got well. He helped Haja in his every plan and also, backfiring it. Other media A video game for the Game Boy Advance, titled simply Battle B-Daman, was developed by Takara and published by Atlus.

The countdown starts when one foot enters the restricted area and resets when both feet leave the area.Rule 5 (Violations), Article 26. The three-second rule was introduced in 1936 and was expressed as such: no offensive player, with or without the ball, could remain in the key, for three seconds or more. The three-second rule came about in part following a game at Madison Square Garden between the University of Kentucky (UK) and New York University (NYU) in 1935, won by NYU 23-22. The University of Kentucky team did not take their own referee, a common practice at the time, despite advice to the UK coach Adolph Rupp from Notre Dame coach George Keogan, who had lost to NYU the week prior and who warned Rupp of the discrepancies in officiating between the Midwest and the East. The game was rough. UK was unable to run its normal offense (which consisted of using screens) without being called for a foul. NYU's Irving Terjesen and Irwin Klein combined to guard one of UK's major players, Leroy Edwards, allowing him to score a mere 6 points (the lowest output of his career). The New York Post reacted with alarm: \\"The score says that NYU is the best college basketball team in the country and that the East still is supreme. But if Frank Lane, the referee from the Midwest, had worked the game, it's safe to assume big Leroy Edwards would have been given a fantastic number of foul shots. Minor mayhem was committed on the person of Edwards by Terjesen and Klein. Something will have to be done or the game will become entirely too rough.\\"New York Post, quoted in , cited in See also * Defensive three- second violation * Key (basketball) * Five-second rule  References  Category:Rules of basketball Category:1936 introductions Category:Basketball terminology The three second rule is one of the most crucial moments in the game and kind of rare to be brought up.

Maggini was a pupil of the most important violin maker of the Brescian school, Gasparo da Sal√≤. Maggini's early instruments are now considered very desirable because, despite their apparent naive craftsmanship, they are wonderful instruments. They first tended to be modified copies of his teacher's instruments. But once established on his own around the year 1606, Maggini developed his skills and experimented with his designs until he achieved a level of expertise that is still highly regarded. His violas, like these of his master, are regarded as the best in the world for the rich deep sound and power of tone. The only known pupil of Maggini is Valentino Siani, who worked with him c. 1610-1620, before he moved to Florence and started his own business. Maggini succumbed to the Italian plague of 1629‚Äì31 that also took another important early luthier, Girolamo Amati. This fact arouses suspicions that some of Maggini's later works are perhaps creations from a different maker since tests reveal that some instruments bearing a genuine Maggini label are from trees living after Maggini's death. The National Music Museum has two Maggini instruments in its collection. One is a bass viola da gamba. The other is a violin. The 18th-century European violin virtuoso- composer Ivan Mane Jarnoviƒá played a Maggini violin. A genuine Maggini violin ranges in value from $200,000 to $2,000,000.

Biography In 1965, Fournier approached Andr√© Franquin with drawings of his favourite characters, the cast of Spirou. As Franquin sought a way to retire as Spirou creator, and devote himself to Gaston Lagaffe, he passed on Fournier's work to Yvan Delporte, the editor of Spirou magazine. Fournier's own creation Bizu was serialised in Spirou between 1967‚Äì69, until Fournier was finally chosen by Dupuis as Franquin's successor. The first story was Le faiseur d'or which first appeared in Spirou on 29 May 1969. Fournier added his personal poetic and environmentalistic mark to the saga. In 1979, after nine feature stories, he decided to leave the project and devote himself to Bizu. Spirou et Fantasio was eventually continued by Nic and Cauvin, In 1998 Fournier launched Les Crannibales, a humouristic comics series based on scripts by Zidrou.

The party combined a strong Christian and conservative programme with progressive ideas on labour and tried to provide an alternative for disillusioned Social Democrat voters. Part of the Berlin movement, it increasingly focused on the Jewish question with a distinct antisemitic attitude.  History  Adolf Stoecker, In December 1877, Adolf Stoecker, domestic chaplain at the court of Emperor Wilhelm I and board member of the Evangelical Church of the Prussian Union, together with the economist Adolph Wagner had founded the Central Association for Social Reform (Zentralverein f√ºr Sozialreform), dealing with injustice and poverty after the Industrial Revolution. The organization was meant to counter the rise of the presumably revolutionary Social Democratic Party and to answer the urging social question on the basis of Protestant religion and monarchism. It was constituted as a laborers' party on 1 February 1878. The program of the CSP included: * Founding of mandatory specialized cooperatives * Settlement of the apprenticeship system * Commercial arbitration * Social insurance: mandatory widows and orphans, disability and pension funds * Eight-hour day * Factory Acts * Restoring laws against usury * Progressive income and inheritance taxes In turn, Social Democrats like Johann Most led a large conjugation in protesting against the party and its Christianity while the reformist approach repelled social conservative voters. In the 1878 elections, the party obtained less than 1% of the vote, thereby failing to enter the German Reichstag parliament. Upon their defeat, the CSP gave up its stance as a workers' party and concentrated on petit-bourgeois sections of the electorate. Although antisemitism was only a minor theme in the early stages of the party, the antisemitic message was carried by the so-called Berlin movement (Berliner Bewegung) of the 1880s, which gathered considerable support. The party linked criticism of capitalism with hatred toward Jews, denoting both big business and social liberal or socialist movements as Judaized and fulfilling the plans of the world Jewry to exterminate the German people (which according to the CSP did not include Jews). The party never gained mass support, but Stoecker from 1879 onwards was able to obtain a seat in the Reichstag after an electoral coalition with the German Conservative Party (DKP). In the parliament, he acted as a DKP far-right, advocating the abolition of universal suffrage and intriguing against the policies of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck until his resignation in 1890. Stoecker was even able to include some antisemitic remarks in the DKP's 1892 party manifesto, but when the Conservatives became worried with the over-tones in his messages (although they were more targeted at Reform Judaism than orthodox Judaism) the Christian Socials were forced from the coalition in 1896 and approached to the antisemitic German Social Party. In turn, a left-wing group around Friedrich Naumann split off to found the National-Social Association. The final demise of the Christian Social Party came in the early 1900s. Stoecker died in 1909 and in November 1918 most members of the CSP under lead of Reichstag member Reinhard Mumm (who succeeded Stoecker in representing the Arnsberg constituency) stepped over to the German National People's Party (Deutschnationale Volkspartei, DNVP) in 1918. The group separated itself again, emerging as the Christian Social People's Service (Christlich-Soziale Volksdienst) in 1929 after the business magnate Alfred Hugenberg had become DNVP chairman.

The raid involved three air strikes, sixty tanks backed by helicopter gunships. The AFP news agency reported that three houses were razed by Israeli bulldozers and a dozen homes were hit by tank shells. The raid was the beginning of Operation \\"Autumn Clouds\\" by the Israeli military. Both the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and the Prime Minister, Ismail Haniya, have described the raid as a massacre. =3 November shootings= On 3 November 2006 one Palestinian woman was killed and ten were reported wounded by Israeli military fire. The women had gathered outside a mosque in Beit Hanoun after an appeal by the local radio for women to rescue Palestinian militants trapped inside a mosque by disguising the militants as women. The Israeli military claimed that their soldiers had spotted two Palestinian militants dressed in women's clothes hiding within the crowd of women, and that the militants were using the women as human shields.http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20698726-1702,00.htmlGunman may have dressed as women in mosque raid The Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority, Ismail Haniyeh, praised the women whom he said \\"...led the protest to break the siege of Beit Hanoun\\". =7 November withdrawal= Palestinian government officials said on 7 November that IDF troops were beginning to withdraw, thus ending the operation.

At least 19 Palestinian civilians were killed and 40 wounded. One day later Assistant Secretary-General Angela Kane of the United Nations Department of Political Affairs briefed the U.N. Security Council on the shelling. She \\"urged both sides in the conflict to 'return to dialogue'\\".U.N. Department of Political Affairs A resolution proposed by Qatar as condemnation of the shelling was brought before the Security Council and was vetoed by the United States, with the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. John Bolton calling the proposed resolution 'one-sided' and 'politically motivated'. Following this rebuff, a watered-down and non-binding resolution was passed by the U.N. General Assembly on 17 November 2006 expressing the assembly's 'distress' at the shelling and calling for a fact- finding mission to be sent to Gaza. The resolution was passed by a majority including the European Union member states. Among the several objectors were the United States and Israel.U.N. calls for end to Israel's Gaza ops =16 November= On 16 November, Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants firing from Beit Hanoun launched a Qassam rocket at the Israeli town of Sderot, killing one and injuring one other. Israel's Prime Minister released a statement saying: \\"This is precisely the type of murderous attacks that we are trying to prevent. Israel will take any means necessary in protecting our citizens.\\" =Aftermath= Israel refused to cooperate with the UN Human Rights Council and obstructed any international investigation into the matter. A Human Rights Council mandated mission which was to have been led by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, was refused to enter Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory. On 11 November the United States vetoed a Security Council draft resolution calling for the establishment of a fact-finding mission into the events of 8 November in Beit Hanoun. A UN report, written by the Special Rapporteur, concluded that ‚Ä≥it seems clear that the indiscriminate firing of shells into a civilian neighbourhood with no apparent military objective constituted a war crime, for which both the commanding officer and those who launched the 30-minute artillery attack should be held criminally responsible‚Ä≥.

He is best known for producing such film as Pleasantville and A Man Apart. His directorial debut was with the film 9/Tenths in 2006. Biography Producer of two Academy Award-nominated short films, two-time CableACE Award nominee and a Satellite Awards Nominee, Bob Degus started from the ground up and has, at one point or another, done almost every job in filmmaking; including writer, director, cinematographer, editor, post-production supervisor, Oxberry-animation cameraman, and most importantly, caterer. Growing up in Rochester, New York, his family has a long history of working for Eastman Kodak ‚Äì Following somewhat in their footsteps, Bob wanted to make film as well ‚Äì just not film stock. He wanted to take it a step further and actually make movies. Degus directed the 2006 independent feature, 9/Tenths, starring Gabrielle Anwar, Henry Ian Cusick and Dave Ortiz. He also directed and edited a 35mm short film, Another Round that was invited to screen at the Los Angeles International Film Festival and was subsequently purchased by Showtime for airing on their network. He likes to say he has produced or worked with more first time feature directors than just about any other producer in Hollywood, most notably producing Gary Ross' feature debut film, the triple Academy Award nominated Pleasantville which he produced alongside Steven Soderbergh and John Kilik. Bob continued to work with Gary Ross for the next five years. He was the production executive on F. Gary Gray's highly successful feature- directorial debut film, Friday and also worked with Gray again on Set It Off (which was New Line's highest grossing film the year it was produced) and he later produced F. Gary Gray's A Man Apart. Bob also worked as a production executive at New Line Cinema, where he oversaw Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Trial and Error with Jeff Daniels, B*A*P*S, with Halle Berry, to name a few; and numerous independent projects including the film adaptation of the Broadway play Love! Valour! Compassion!. Bob served as head of production at Chanticleer Films where he oversaw, produced or was directly involved with more than 40 short-features, directed by first-time directors, made under the auspices of the award winning The Discovery Program, which received more than seven Academy Award nominations during the period he oversaw the program, and literally hundreds of other awards from film festivals throughout the world. He also produced and conceptualized Funk Blast, the premiere centerpiece attraction at Paul Allen's \\"Experience Music Project\\" Museum, in Seattle, where he brought together James Brown, Maceo Parker, Bootsy Collins, George Clinton, Chaka Kahn, and Herbie Hancock, producing a state-of-the-art 70mm ride-film, which dramatically advanced editing techniques in ride movies. In the summer of 2005 Bob produced the low- budget independent feature Graduation alongside Jane Sindell, Jason Blum, Fred Fuchs, Robin Bradford and Scott Hansen. In addition to all this, Bob is an avid photographer and an active, voting member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He regularly serves on the Foreign Language Film Award Nominating Committee and is a member of the executive board for his branch.

They were part of the larger \\"Flower Class\\" shipbuilding project, which were also referred to as the \\"Cabbage Class\\", or \\"Herbaceous Borders\\". The ships were also used outside their minesweeping duties as patrol vessels, tugs, and personnel and cargo transports. The design for the Arabis class was made at the end of 1914. All 36 British vessels were ordered in July 1915, and were built in three batches, averaging 12 vessels. A further 8 vessels were later built in British shipyards for the French Navy. The design was highly appealing, as most shipyards were capable of building them, and construction could be completed in five months. Like the preceding Acacia and Azalea class sloops, these were single-screw Fleet Sweeping Vessels (Sloops) with triple hulls at the bows to give extra protection against loss when working.

The Knanaya are descendants of Syrian Christians who reportedly migrated to the Malabar coast during the fourth century under the leadership of Thomas of Cana. During the 17th century, they split into Catholic and Orthodox (Jacobite) Churches. Knanaya History The Knanaya trace their origins to Thomas of Cana (Knai Thoma), a Syrian merchant who led a group of 72 Jewish-Christian immigrant families, a bishop named Uraha Mar Yausef, and clergymen from Mesopotamia to settle in Cranganore, India in the 4th century (some sources place these events as late as the 9th century). This may reflect a historical migration of East Syrian Christians to India around this time, which established the region's relationship with the Church of the East. Though the traditional date of arrival for the Knanaya community is 345 C.E. found in the culture and ancient folk songs of the community, several scholars and officials noted throughout the colonial era that this figure may in fact be in reference to a later date between 745-811 C.E. The Knanaya, also called Southist or Thekkumbhagar in Malayalam, are the descendants of Thomas of Cana and his followers, while the older St. Thomas Christians also called Northist or Vadakkumbhagar, descend from the local Christian body which had been converted by Thomas the Apostle centuries earlier. The Oxford History of the Christian Church states the following about the division: > \\"In time, Jewish Christians of the most exclusive communities descended from > settlers who accompanied Knayil Thomma (Kanayi) became known as ‚ÄòSouthists‚Äô > (Tekkumbha ÃÑgar)...They distinguished between themselves and ‚ÄòNorthists‚Äô > (Vatakkumbha ÃÑgar). The ‚ÄòNorthists‚Äô, on the other hand, claimed direct > descent from the very oldest Christians of the country, those who had been > won to Christ by the Apostle Thomas himself. They had already long inhabited > northern parts of Kodungallur. They had been there even before various waves > of newcomers had arrived from the Babylonian or Mesopotamian provinces of > Sassanian Persia.\\" Elements of Thomas of Cana's arrival feature in ancient songs as well as the Thomas of Cana copper plates awarded to his followers by a local Hindu ruler. These plates are said to have granted Thomas' followers 72 social, economic, and religious rights from Cheraman Perumal, the Chera king. The plates were present in Kerala during the time of the Portuguese colonization in the early 17th century, but were lost during Portuguese rule. Portuguese Archbishop Francis Ros notes in his 1604 account M.S. ADD 9853 that the plates were taken to Portugal by Franciscans. The Knanaya invoke the plates as evidence of their descent from Thomas of Cana's mission.

In French, the name of the society is a pun, in which abaiss√©s ('the abased', 'the lowly'), is pronounced , very similar to A-B-C (). Their members represent a wide variety of political viewpoints, ranging from communist agitation to advocacy for democracy to supporting the Levellers and more, but on 5 June 1832 they all join the popular insurrection known as the June Rebellion and organize the construction of a massive barricade. Hugo brings them into the narrative when Marius Pontmercy, one of the novel's principal characters, attaches himself to the group without becoming one of them. With their fight led by Enjolras, all of the members of the group die during the rebellion. Characters Jean Valjean and Gavroche both also fight with the student rebellion, with Valjean barely making it out alive and Gavroche dying. The central story is also told in the 1980 musical version of Les Mis√©rables, though many of the members lack characterization in the musical. Role in the novel The Friends of the ABC is a reference to the historical Society of the Rights of Man. Hugo comments on the Rights of Man society in the novel, describing the many spin-off sub-groups in Paris and elsewhere:Les Mis√©rables, Volume 4, Book First, Chapter 5.

His motto is \\"never a lawyer\\".Les Mis√©rables, Volume 3, Book Fourth, Chapter 1. On the way to build a barricade in the June Rebellion, Bahorel gains the attention of Gavroche due to his bold behavior.Les Mis√©rables, Volume 4, Book Eleventh, Chapter 4 He is the first of the principal Friends of the ABC to die in the revolt and is killed by a municipal guardsman.Les Mis√©rables, Volume 4, Book Fourteenth, Chapter 3 *Combeferre ‚Äì \\"The Guide\\". Representing the philosophy of the revolution, he \\"completes and corrects\\" Enjolras. An intellectual, Combeferre advocates for societal and scientific progress. In contrast to Enjolras, whom one \\"would have liked to fight under\\", it is mentioned that one would prefer to \\"march behind\\" him. At the barricade, Combeferre is killed by bayonet while assisting a wounded soldier, and was able to do no more than look up to the sky before he died.Les Mis√©rables, Volume 5, Book First, Chapter 21 *Courfeyrac (also de Courfeyrac) ‚Äì \\"The Center\\". Courfeyrac is compared with Tholomyes, Fantine's lover featured earlier in the novel; however, contrary to Tholomyes, Courfeyrac is honorable and loyal. Alongside Combeferre \\"The Guide\\" and Enjolras \\"The Chief\\", Courfeyrac is described as \\"The Center\\" on account of his warm and radiant personality. He is Marius Pontmercy's closest companion. He dies defending the center of the barricade.Les Mis√©rables, Volume 5, Book First, Chapter 22 *Enjolras ‚Äì \\"The Chief\\". Youthful, handsome, and charming, though \\"capable of being terrible\\", he is the leader of the Friends of the ABC. A \\"priest of the ideal\\", Enjolras is devoted to the revolution and his republican ideals. He is a skilled combatant during the June Rebellion, facing a battalion of the National Guard alone, but he sustains no wounds or injuries prior to his death. Enjolras is killed by firing squad in the Corinthe, holding hands with Grantaire. *Feuilly ‚Äì An orphaned fan maker who taught himself to read and write. He has great interest in foreign affairs and history, and he is described to have \\"adopted the people\\".

He has knowledge of Italian, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and his interest in poetry is grand. Though he is timid and quiet, he is intrepid, and good above all. Shortly after the first assault on the barricade, Jean Prouvaire is found to be missing among the insurgents. Combeferre and Enjolras realize that he is taken prisoner, but before they can attempt a truce, they recognize the sound of his voice from the end of the street. After they hear the sound of gunfire, they determine that Prouvaire is killed.Les Mis√©rables, Volume 4, Book Fourteenth, Chapter 5 *Joly (also Jolllly) ‚Äì A hypochondriac student of medicine. Joly is described as the happiest of all of the Friends despite his eccentricity and hypochondria. He is called \\"Jolllly\\" with four Ls, a pun on the English word \\"jolly\\". He has the habit of touching his nose with the tip of his cane, which shows he has a sagacious mind. The morning of June 5, Joly dines with Lesgle and Grantaire before joining his fellows in building the barricade, despite having a cold.Les Mis√©rables, Volume 4, Book Twelfth, Chapter 2 Joly dies alongside the other insurgents on the barricade during the June Rebellion. *Lesgle (also L√®gle, Laigle, L'Aigle ['The Eagle'] or Bossuet) ‚Äì Lesgle is the son of a man who was granted a post-office by Louis XVIII. He is bald at twenty five years old. Unlucky but good-humoured, he says often that he lives \\"under a roof of falling tiles\\". Lesgle has no home of his own and usually stays with friends, most often Joly. He is the first Friend of the ABC to meet Marius.Les Mis√©rables, Volume 3, Book Fourth, Chapter 2.

The temple was built during the rule of the Hoysala Empire. Known to legend as Ekachakranagara, Belavadi is said to be the place mentioned in Mahabharatha where Pandava prince Bheema killed the demon Bakasura and protected the village and its people. Belavadi is 29 km southeast of Chikmagalur town on the Chikmagalur-Javagal highway. It is a short distance from the famous temple towns of Belur and Halebidu. 500x500px  Architecture  This ornate trikuta (three shrined) temple was built in 1200 C.E. by Hoysala Empire King Veera Ballala II. The material used is Soapstone.Kamath (2001), p136. Quote:\\"The Western Chalukya carvings were done on green schist (Soapstone). This technique was adopted by the Hoysalas\\", Each of the three shrines has a complete superstructure (tower on top of shrine) and is one of the largest temples built by the Hoysala kings. While the famous temples at Belur and Halebidu are known for their intricate sculptures, this temple is known for its architecture.Foekema (1996), p53 The plan of the temple is unique in that two of the shrines face each other and are located on either side of a wide and spacious open mantapa (hall) containing thirty seven bays.Quote:\\"A bay is a square or rectangular compartment in the hall\\", Foekema (1996), p93 The temple complex has two closed mantapas, one with thirteen bays and another with nine bays, at the end of which is a central shrine. This third shrine is an older construction and exhibits a standard architectural idiom containing all the basic elements of a Hoysala temple. The inner walls of the older shrine are plain, but its roof is well decorated. In all, the temple complex has fifty nine bays (hence it has many pillars), most of which are lathe-turned and bell shaped,Quote:\\"This is a common feature of Western Chalukya-Hoysala temples\\", Kamath (2001), p117 while a few have decorative carvings on them. According to Foekema, the outer wall of the temple is of the \\"old style\\", with one eaves running around the temple where the superstructure meets the wall of the shrine. Below this are miniature decorative towers on pilasters (aedicule). This is followed by a second eves. A panel of Hindu deities and their attendants (frieze) are below this eves followed by a set of five moldings that form the base of the wall.Quote:\\"An eaves is a projecting roof, overhanging the wall\\", Foekema (1996), p93 Lathe turned pillars of the mantapa between the Venugopala and Yoga Narasimha shrines of the Veeranarayana temple at Belavadi Domical bay ceiling art in outer mantapa of the Veeranarayana temple at Belavadi The two newer shrines have different plans. One shrine is square in shape while the other is star shaped (stellate). The tower of the shrine has an apex called the kalasha (decorative water-pot like structure) below which are three tiers of decorated miniature roofs.Quote:\\"The Kalasha is the water pot like structure at the peak of the tower\\", Foekema (2001), p27 The superstructure over each of three shrines is connected to a low protrusion tower called Sukanasi (tower over the vestibule, called \\"nose\\" of the main tower)Quote:\\"Tower on top of vestibule connecting hall and shrine\\", Foekema (1996), p22 The Sukanasi consist of two tiers of decorated miniature roofs. In all other aspects the two shrines are identical. All shrines have sculptured decoration on the towers, and the sculptures on the walls are bold and are visible from a distance.Foekema (1996), pp54-55. However, they are not sharp and impressive from close quarters unlike in other Hoysala temples. The important sculptures with fine finish are that of the Hindu god Krishna dancing on the head of Kalia the serpent, and the Garuda (eagle). This is a Vaishnava temple and all three shrines have images of the Hindu god Vishnu, though in different forms (avatar). The central shrine (older shrine) has an tall image of Narayana with four hands and is considered one of the best examples of Hoysala art. It is well elaborated with ornamentation and stands on a padmasana (lotus seat). The southern shrine has an tall image of Venugopala (the god Krishna playing a flute) including a garuda pedestal and the northern shrine has a tall image of Yoganarasimha, sitting in a yoga posture. Decorative sculptures such as kirtimukhas (gargoyles) are used to make the shrine (vimana) towers ornate..

In addition to this they could be employed as a projectile as well as used to make fire and make ochre.

Against French and Lao forces, however, Ong Keo continued the struggle until his murder in 1910. After his death, fighting still continued under his successor Ong Kommandam until at least 1937. Local legend holds that Ong Keo survived the murder attempt and lived until the early 1970s. Early life Ong Keo was an Alak, born in Ban Paktai, Muang Thateng, in what then was part of the kingdom of Champasak, but now is in Xekong or Sekong Province.Polsena, Vatthana; 2006; Post-war Laos: The Politics of Culture, History, And Identity; Cornell University Press; ; pp 121-138 His father was a village chief. Ong Keo moved rapidly up the leadership ladder because of his charisma and intelligence, and his fluency in Lao and Pali. He performed religious ceremonies on Mount Tayun, which was close to his home village. He advocated that foreigners be thrown out. His following grew quickly and soon they began calling him Pha Ong Keo ( ‚àí Wiktionary: pr√° ong g√¢ew) ‚àí \\"Venerable Precious-Jewel,\\" and a Phu Mi Boun (, lit. \\"person have Buddhist merit\\"), usually translated in the messianic sense as The Holy Man. Rebellion He launched his rebellion in Thateng in response to the destruction of the temple of Ban Nong Mek. This rebellion lasted six years before a truce could be made. Phu Mi Boun surrendered to the French in October 1907 after military defeats, epidemics and famine disheartened his troops. Despite his surrender, he never submitted to the conditions the French laid on him. He continued to use the title of \\"Great King\\" that he had given himself, performed Buddhist/Alak religious rites and encouraged his disciples, particularly Ong Kommandam, to carry on his struggle. In 1910, the French Commissioner of Saravane, Jean-Jacques Dauplay, ordered that he be killed for his \\"arrogant\\" attitude.Gunn, Geoffrey C.; 1990; Rebellion In Laos: Peasant And Politics In A Colonial Backwater; Westview Press USA; Some sources say that Dauplay himself killed Ong Keo after summoning him to a meeting, with a gun he had hid in his hat.Moppert, Fran√ßois; Mouvement de r√©sistance au pouvoir colonial fran√ßais de la minorit√© proto-indochinoise du plateau des Bolovens au Sud-Laos : 1901-1936; Doctorate Thesis, Universit√© de Paris VII, 1978  See also  * The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland Southeast Asia (2009) * Zomia (geography), a term used in the book References Category:Year of birth missing Category:Laotian military leaders Category:1910 deaths Category:Assassinated military personnel Category:Deaths by firearm in Laos ","title":"Ong Keo"},{"id":"7733502","text":"H.331 is part of the ITU suite of standards for Video Teleconferencing.

It is located in the Cielo Vista neighborhood on the near east side of El Paso, north of the large shopping center Cielo Vista Mall and south of El Paso International Airport, and is the only El Paso Independent School District high school in East El Paso. History The school cost $2 million in 1955 to build. The school's original plan included only 70 classrooms, a cafeteria that could hold up to 500 people, an indoor rifle range, a field house, and a combined gymnasium and auditorium. The first graduating class was in January 1956. The school, which was named for William H. Burges, a prominent local attorney of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, serves portions of near East, East-Central and South-Central El Paso. Its feeder schools are Ross Middle School and MacArthur Elementary-Intermediate School. MacArthur is the only K-8 primary school remaining from a long trend in the district of separating pre-kindergarteners to fifth graders into elementary schools, sixth-to-eighth-graders into middle schools, and ninth-to-twelfth-graders into high schools, which began circa 1970. The elementary schools in the Burges feeder pattern include Bonham, Cielo Vista (which graduate into MacArthur), Hawkins, Hillside and Hughey (which graduate into Ross). Most of the Burges attendance zone lies between Interstate 10 on the south, the Fort Bliss main post and El Paso International Airport on the north, the Patriot Freeway (US 54) on the west and the boundary of the Ysleta Independent School District on the east. However, a portion of South-Central El Paso is zoned for Burges which is bordered roughly by Interstate 10 on the north, railroad tracks running north of El Paso Drive on the south, Raynolds Street on the west, and on the east, an industrial area just north of the three-way intersection of Delta Drive, Trowbridge Drive and North Loop Road which extends into the Ysleta Independent School District. The portion of the Burges attendance zone lying south of Interstate 10 is zoned for Hawkins Elementary west of Trowbridge and Hughey Elementary east of it, and Ross Middle overall. The eastern half of the Fort Bliss main post, which is zoned for Ross Middle and Hughey Elementary, which lie at the southeastern edge of the main post, is zoned for Austin High for grades nine to twelve.http://www.episd.org Burges hosts a teaching and child development magnet program and mainstream classes for deaf high school students.

Plants of the genus Medicago, or bur clovers, are closely related to the true clovers (Trifolium) and sweet clover (Melilotus). Like the true clovers, black medick has three leaflets and a small, yellow flower closely resembling those of lesser trefoil. Black medick belongs to the same genus as alfalfa. Names The generic name Medicago is derived, via Latin , from Ancient Greek () \\"Median\\", because alfalfa was believed to have been introduced from the region of Media (now in Iran) in antiquity. The specific name lupulina means \\"wolf- like\\", and refers to the hop, or willow-wolf. Its scientific name is a translation of the common name hop clover (or hop-clover), which is also used for several members of the genus Trifolium. Also spelled \\"medic\\" or \\"meddick\\", the plant is known by a number of alternate names, including nonesuch, black nonesuch, black medic clover, hop clover, hop medic, black clover, black hay, blackweed, English trefoil, hop trefoil, and yellow trefoil. Some of these names are also applied to wildflowers of the related genera Trifolium and Melilotus. Description Medicago lupulina is an annual or short-lived perennial plant, growing each year from adventitious buds on the roots. Mature plants measure from in height, with fine stems often lying flat at the beginning of growth and later erecting. The leaves are compound, each with three oval leaflets, carried on a short petiole; the center leaflet usually has a longer petiole. The leaflets are hairy, toothed toward the tip, and differ from those of the similar Trifolium dubium in that they end in a short point. Black medick has small (2‚Äì3 mm) yellow flowers grouped in tight bunches (compact racemes). On larger plants the flower heads may reach or more. The fruit is a single-seeded pod, 1.5 to 3 mm in diameter, that does not open upon maturation, but hardens and turns black when ripe. Each pod contains a single amber-colored seed. Like other legumes, the roots of black medick contain nodules hosting nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Plants that survive for more than one year may develop a deep tap root. Distribution A native of the old world, black medick is found throughout Europe, north Africa, the Near East, and most of Asia, including India, China, and Korea. It is naturalized in central Asia, Japan, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, and much of South America. Black medick is found throughout the United States, including Hawaii and Alaska. Black medick thrives in dry to moist, well-drained soils containing sand, loam, or clay, and is a pioneer plant, often growing on disturbed ground. It grows in alkaline, neutral, and mildly acidic conditions. It does not grow in shady areas. Black medick grows well in limestone soils and on coastal sand dunes, where it suffers less competition from the other plants, and as such is found on many islands, such as Taiwan, the Canary Islands, the Azores, and Madeira. It is resistant to cold and can be found on mountains up to 1,800 meters. Uses Black medick is one of the flowers used to make honey. It is frequently found in natural pastures, and may be planted in order to create artificial meadows, especially on dry land. The presence of black medick in large concentrations as a lawn weed may indicate that the soil is poor in nitrogen. However, because black medick and other clovers fix nitrogen in the soil, this deficiency can improve over time due to the presence of these plants. Black medick is sometimes used as a fodder plant. Its hardiness and ability to grow in poor soils, as well as its tendency to fix nitrogen in the soil, make black medick a good choice for pasturage, although its fodder value is limited. It is grazed by sheep but is not very palatable to cattle. Similar plants Black medick may be confused with other plants that have three leaflets and small yellow flowers, such as hop trefoil (Trifolium campestre), large hop trefoil (T. aureum), lesser hop trefoil (T. dubium), and yellow woodsorrel (Oxalis stricta). =Photographs= Image:Medicago lupulina 02 ies.jpgFlower Image:Medicago lupulina 04 ies.jpgLeaves and flowers Image:Medicago lupulina 10 ies.jpgFlowers wilting after pollination Image:Medicago lupulina 11 ies.jpgunripe seed pods (green) Image:Starr 040723-0305 Medicago lupulina.jpgripe seed pods (black) Image:Medicago lupulina seeds.JPGseeds next to US dime for scale Image:Medicago lupulina root nodules.JPGRoot with nodules Image:Medicago lupulina.jpgan entire uprooted plant =Illustrations= Image:Illustration Medicago arabica1.jpgColor plate: M. arabica top; M. lupulina bottom.

Framed as a contemporary Oedipus tale, the plot focuses on a teenager who, raised by his neurotic aunt, finds himself at the center of a murder investigation after she stabs a man to death in their house. The boy's sexually repressed aunt secretly harbors incestuous feelings for him, while a homophobic detective investigating the crime irrationally believes the murder to be a result of a homosexual love triangle. Financed by the independent Royal American Pictures, the film was shot in Los Angeles in 1981. Michael Miller was originally hired to direct, and completed the filming of the opening sequence with cinematographer Jan de Bont before being fired and replaced by Asher, who shot the remainder of the film with Robbie Greenberg. Given a regional release in Oregon in November 1981 through Comworld Pictures, the film expanded to other U.S. cities in early 1982, and was nominated for a Saturn Award for the Best Horror Movie of 1982 by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films. It was reissued theatrically in 1983 under the title Night Warning, under which it was subsequently released on home video. The film has attracted critical discussion for its early positive portrayal of a gay male character. Plot High school senior Billy Lynch lives with his protective aunt Cheryl, who has raised him since infancy after his parents died in a car accident. A gifted basketball player, Billy is offered a chance at a scholarship to attend the University of Denver, but Cheryl dismisses the idea, assuming that Billy will stay with her to \\"contribute.\\" At school, Billy is bullied by one of his basketball teammates, Eddie, who is jealous of Billy's close camaraderie with their coach, Tom Landers; meanwhile Julia, the school newspaper photographer, begins to take a romantic interest in Billy. On Billy's 17th birthday, Cheryl changes her mind about the scholarship, and asks Billy to stop by the television repair shop to have the shop technician, Phil Brody, come by to look at their set. That night, after Phil works on their television, Cheryl makes aggressive sexual advances toward him; when he refuses, Cheryl stabs him to death with a kitchen knife, which Billy witnesses through the window. Cheryl hysterically claims Phil tried to rape her. A bigoted police detective (and former Marine and Purple Heart recipient), Joe Carlson, is assigned to the case, and is skeptical of Cheryl and the alleged rape attempt. After discovering that Phil Brody was gay, and that he was in a same-sex relationship with Billy's coach, Tom, he assumes the murder to be the result of a love triangle between Phil, Tom, and Billy, and that Cheryl is covering for her nephew. Carlson begins questioning Billy, accusing him of being a \\"fag\\", and harasses Tom, forcing him to resign from his job at the high school. Carlson also inquires from Julia about her and Billy's sexual relationship. Meanwhile, Cheryl feeds Billy drugged milk, which causes him to perform poorly at his scholarship tryout, and cleans out the attic so he can have an apartment space in the house. Sergeant Cook, who has been casing Cheryl's home, believes Billy to be innocent, and is suspicious of Cheryl. After walking in on Billy and Julia having sex, Cheryl becomes enraged with Billy. In the attic, Billy finds a photo of a man named Craig, whom Cheryl claims was one of his mother's old boyfriends. Billy has Julia stop by the house to distract Cheryl so that he can investigate further; locked in a box upstairs, he finds his birth certificate, indicating that Cheryl is actually his mother, and that Craig was his father. Meanwhile, downstairs, Cheryl strikes Julia in the head with a meat tenderizer, and again drugs Billy with milk, rendering him unconscious. Julia awakens in a secret room in the basement, where she discovers Craig's mummified corpse and his severed head in a jar of formaldehyde next to a makeshift shrine. Cheryl's nosy neighbor Margie, having grown suspicious, arrives shortly after to investigate the goings-on on the property, and is followed into the woods behind the house by Cheryl, who stabs her to death with a machete. Sergeant Cook then enters the house in search of Julia, who has been reported missing by her mother, and is also murdered by Cheryl after discovering Julia in the basement. Cheryl chases Julia out of the house, and they both fall in a pond near the woods, where Cheryl again knocks Julia unconscious. Billy awakens in the attic, which Cheryl has adorned with his childhood toys, and stumbles downstairs to call the police. While attempting to dial 911, Cheryl attacks him with a knife, and a violent struggle ensues, ending with Billy impaling her with a fireplace poker. Billy calls Tom, asking for help. Shortly after, Carlson arrives at the house, where he finds Tom treating Billy's stab wounds, and sees Cheryl's lifeless body on the floor. In a rage, Carlson blames Billy and Tom for the crimes, and draws his gun on them, despite Julia's insistent cries that Cheryl was responsible. Tom and Carlson get into a scuffle, during which Billy is able to grab the gun, shooting Carlson multiple times. Carlson bleeds to death in front of the living room piano while Billy and Julia embrace, both crying. Cast Analysis and themes =Malignant motherhood= Oedipus the King, specifically regarding adoption and mother-son incest Horror film scholar John Kenneth Muir writes extensively regarding the themes of motherhood in Butcher, Baker, Nightmare Maker in his book Horror Films of the 1980s, specifically the warped relationship that Billy's aunt Cheryl (whom he later discovers to be in fact his mother) has with him. Muir points out several motifs surrounding this theme, such as the milk Cheryl uses to drug him, \\"a symbol of her twisted motherhood... Billy is rendered impotent by the milk, infantilized by Cheryl's inappropriate and inimical ministrations.\\" Muir also suggests that the film may potentially be engaging with the American stereotype that overbearing mothers produce gay sons, as Billy's sexuality is questioned by those around him throughout the film. Several other critics and scholars have noted the plotline of Butcher, Baker, Nightmare Maker is modeled after Oedipus the King by Sophocles, borrowing the themes of adoption and incestual yearning from a mother to her son. Muir writes that when Billy eventually murders Cheryl in self-defense, he impales her with a tire iron‚Äîa phallic symbol‚Äîand that, after the struggle, her dead body collapses around his in what resembles a sexual position. =Inversion of the \\"final girl\\"= Writer Marc Heuck notes that the film > predicted tropes of young adult books and films for decades to come: a > teenager living in relative comfort is thrust into dangerous circumstance > beyond their preparedness or comprehension, and discovers that neither > parental figures nor the law can be trusted. Hell, many of us in our > advanced age still have nightmares of this sort and never quite transcend > that basic fear. It‚Äôs this theme that probably kept those teenage girls in > their seats when the subject matter started getting really icky and they > would have been tempted to leave for the mall. Heuck also views the character of Billy as an inversion of the \\"final girl\\" trope, in that he \\"not only is he directly injured by the villains and survives against the odds, he is also extremely attractive, feeding into the unhealthy motivations of those who threaten him within and the desires of the audience watching him outside.\\" The counterpoint to Billy is the character of Julia, his girlfriend, whom Heuck notes as taking on the \\"helpful boyfriend\\" role often present in slasher films. =Portrayal of homosexuality= Butcher, Baker, Nightmare Maker has been noted for being an early film to portray a homosexual male character as a positive figure by featuring Tom Landers, Billy's gay basketball coach who is subjected to homophobia, and later comes to Billy and Julia's rescue in the final sequence. Steve Easton, who portrayed the character, recalled that the screenplay did not sensationalize the character's sexuality: \\"He's a gay man, but he's not a pervert. He just likes men, and he's got a boyfriend, and his boyfriend is murdered.\\" Scholar Jeffery Dennis notes that Tom's partner, who is murdered early in the film by Billy's aunt Cheryl, is \\"perhaps the only gay person in all of American cinema who is not an urban sophisticate\\", as well as one of the only characters in the film shown to be an upstanding individual. Likewise, Dennis interprets an inversion of social norms in which heterosexual desire as \\"oppressive and sinister... Aunt Cheryl opines that \\"Homosexuals are very, very sick!\\" as she murders half a dozen people, grabs and fondles Billy, drugs his milk, and finally tries to stab him.\\" The question of Billy's potential homosexuality is also noted, though Dennis states that his \\"sexual identity is not answered by his constant protesting-too-much or by his buddy bond with the coach.\\" Production =Screenplay= The character of the unhinged Cheryl was partly inspired by female film antagonists such as Baby Jane Hudson in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962) Producer and co-writer Stephen Breimer co-wrote the film's screenplay with Boon Collins and Alan Jay Glueckman, aspiring to blend elements of character-driven films led by female villains (such as What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?) with the slasher film. The genesis of the story was based on Breimer's own curiosity about his biological parents, as he himself was adopted. Though the core of the plot was devised by Breimer and Glueckman, Boone, a writer from Vancouver, helped write several sequences, including the opening car crash death of Billy's parents. =Casting= Jimmy McNichol, cast as the male lead, Billy, was among the first to sign on to the film. McNichol had achieved significant success as a child star, which led to him signing a three-picture contract with executive producer Jerry Weintraub, in which he would receive top billing. Breimer had initially wanted Bill Paxton for the leading role, but instead gave him a minor supporting part as one of Billy's bullying classmates. After McNichol was cast, Bo Svenson, who was also represented by McNichol's talent agency, was cast in the role of Joe Carlson, the homophobic detective. In seeking an actress to portray Cheryl, the unhinged aunt of Billy, producer Stephen Breimer hand-selected Susan Tyrrell based on her performance in Fat City (1972). Glueckman was enthusiastic about Tyrrell's involvement in the film, having met her on the set of Forbidden Zone (1980). Director William Asher instructed Tyrrell to \\"pull out all the stops,\\" giving her character an exaggerated performance that would help lend the film a \\"larger-than-life\\" quality. Julia Duffy was cast as Billy's girlfriend, Julia, beating out several other actresses who auditioned for the part, including Daryl Hannah and Ally Sheedy. =Filming= Principal photography took place in Los Angeles, California. Though William Asher is solely credited as director, the film's opening sequence was shot by Michael Miller, who had previously directed Jackson County Jail (1976) for Roger Corman. Jan de Bont served as Miller's cinematographer for the scene. Finding Miller's production pacing too slow, the film's investors fired Miller and replaced him with Asher. Asher had previously had a long career directing in television, including numerous episodes of I Love Lucy and Bewitched. The home in the film was located on a historic property in Elysian Park that housed a larger estate, as well as several other cottages. Release =Distribution= The film was first given a small regional release through Comworld Pictures under the title Butcher, Baker, Nightmare Maker in several cities in Oregon, including Salem and Corvallis, on November 20, 1981. A novel tie-in written by Joseph Burgo was issued by Pocket Books on December 1, 1981. The film's theatrical release expanded in March 1982, screening in St. Louis, Missouri, as well as Vancouver, British Columbia. The film was re-released in January 1983 under the title Night Warning, first screening in the California cities of San Francisco and Santa Cruz, as well as Indianapolis, Indiana. =Critical response= Upon the film's opening in Corvallis, Oregon, local Corvallis Gazette-Times critic Lloyd Woods praised the performances of Tyrrell and Svenson as well as the direction of William Asher, who he felt \\"does a credible job in developing the derangement.\\" Leonard Maltin awarded the film his usual two-and-a-half out of four stars, his most frequently used rating, writing: \\"Explosive, tour-de-force acting by Tyrrell distinguishes this formula horror film. Following its January 1983 re-release under the title Night Warning, critic J. A. Conner of the Santa Cruz Sentinel characterized the film as a \\"Tennessee Williams version of Psycho\\" and deemed it an early contender for the worst films of 1983, summarizing: \\"Night Warning is just another drive-in grindhouse sleazoid mess that somehow wandered into town by the back door.\\" AllMovie awarded it two-and-a-half out of five stars and labeled it \\"an especially unique entry into the slasher film cycle in the 1980s\\" based on its influences, the 1960s Gothic horror films. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Unfolding deftly under Asher's direction, Night Warning combines darkly outrageous humor with persuasive psychological validity.\\" Variety called it \\"a fine psychological horror film\\" in which Tyrrell \\"gives a tour-de-force performance.\\" In Horror Movies of the 1980s, John Kenneth Muir rated it 3.5/4 stars. Muir called it \\"a true gem of the decade\\" and \\"the 1980s' most twisted, bizarre cinematic vision of motherhood.\\" In a 2019 article published in Film Comment, Justin Stewart praised Asher for directing \\"with a meat-and-potatoes efficiency and visual sense, letting the casting, risk-taking performances, and the twisted, quirky screenplay... carry the day,\\" and also praised Tyrrell's performance. =Home video= The film screened on The Movie Channel in the fall of 1983, and was released on VHS through HBO Home Video under the Night Warning title in 1985. In the United Kingdom, the film was deemed a \\"video nasty\\" by the British Board of Film Classification and refused a video certificate. Independent label Code Red issued the film on DVD in 2014,and reissued it on Blu-ray on July 18, 2017, which featured a 2K scan of the original film elements.

Significant symbols are a later by-product of the meaning emergent in the act, which meaning is described, or accounted for, in terms of symbols or language. Origin Significant symbols originated by the social behaviorist George Herbert Mead, who made a great impact in sociologist studies in the 20th century. Mead was interested specifically in the work of Wilhelm Wundt. It was from Wundt that Mead gained an understanding how the gesture is involved in social interaction. This sociological term significant symbols is the basis for symbolic interactionism, which attempts to define the self. Language Language, in Mead's view, is communication through significant symbols. Physical objects can be significant symbols, but vocal gestures, especially language, are the crucial significant symbols. Language brings out the same response in both the speaker and hearer. Language is the highest form of communication, a mature development of the gesture situation; therefore, the major tool of the interaction from which minds and selves emerge. Language is important because it is the means by which an individual may convey his attitudes and assume the roles of others, and thus participate in the interactionary creation of mind and self. Language also makes possible the critically important ability of people to think, to engage in mental processes. Thinking, as well as the mind, is simply defined as conversation that people have with themselves using language; this activity is like having a conversation with other people. Language allows people to stimulate their own actions as well as those of others. Role-taking and coordinated behavior Through role-taking and the development of significant gestures and symbols the mind develops as the ability to indicate to one's self the same response that one's gestures had brought out in others, and to control the response in terms of it. Accuracy in role-taking also implies a preexisting social world of shared linguistic meanings that enable actors to respond to their own oncoming behavior in the same way as the other. Without them, role- taking and coordinated behavior could not proceed. Significant symbols' specific meaning differs in various social situations. Communication Significant communication may also be defined as the comprehension by the individual through the meaning of her gestures. Mead describes the communication process as a social act since it necessarily requires at least two individuals in interaction with one another. It is within this act that meaning arises. The act of communication has a triadic structure consisting of the following components: * An initiating gesture on the part of an individual * A response to that gesture by a second individual * The result of the action initiated by the first gesture In and during the social contact, the mind recognizes symbols and translates those symbols, and acts or adjusts to symbols based on the previous knowledge of meaning. Significance of gestures A gesture, then, is an action that implies a reaction. The reaction is the meaning of the gesture and points toward the result (the \\"intentionality\\") of the action initiated by the gesture. Gestures \\"become significant symbols when they absolutely arouse in an individual making them the same responses which they explicitly arouse, or are [intended] to arouse, in other individuals, the individuals to whom they are addressed.\\" Although people and animals employ insignificant gestures, only people employ significant gestures, or those that involve thought before a response is made. Significant symbols always imply a context within which it has significance, a universe of discourse. The universe of discourse is constituted by a group of individuals carrying on a common social process, within which these symbols have common meaning within that group, regardless of whether the members are making the gestures or responding to them. Examples *If you bark at a dog, the dog will bark back. If you bark at a human, the human may or may not bark back. It all depends on the human's decision to the symbol *If an organism were to scratch their tooth repeatedly, only those involved within that social situation might be able to interpret that gesture and subsequently be able to respond. This is the essence of the significant symbol. It has meaning. One can respond to it. *If an individual was to say the word dog to another person, both persons would have a similar mental image of a dog. *If an individual yelled the word fire in a crowded theater, everyone would be driven to escape the theater as quickly as possible.

Laura Smith Haviland (December 20, 1808 ‚Äì April 20, 1898) was an American abolitionist, suffragette, and social reformer. She was an important figure in the history of the Underground Railroad. Early years and family Laura Smith Haviland was born on December 20, 1808, in Kitley Township, Ontario, Canada to American parents, Daniel Smith and Asenath \\"Sene\\" Blancher,Hinshaw, William Wade. Encyclopedia of American Quaker Genealogy. Vol. IV. Transcribed records from the Adrian Monthly Meeting, Michigan Territory. Note: Her first name is recorded as both \\"Asenath\\" and \\"Sene\\" in the Quaker Records. Sene was a short form of the name Asenath, not her full given name. She was born in Jamaica, VT. who had immigrated shortly before her birth. Haviland wrote that Daniel was \\"a man of ability and influence, of clear perceptions, and strong reasoning powers,\\" while her mother Sene was \\"of a gentler turn, ... a quiet spirit, benevolent and kind to all, and much beloved by all who knew her.\\" The Smiths, farmers of modest means, were devout members of the Society of Friends, better known as Quakers. Haviland's father was a minister in the Society and her mother was an Elder. Though the Quakers dressed plainly, and strictly forbade dancing, singing, and other pursuits they deemed frivolous, many of their views were progressive by the standards of the day.Eisenmann, Linda. Historical Dictionary of Women's Education in the United States, pages 332-333. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1998. The Quakers encouraged the equal education of men and women, an extraordinarily forward-thinking position in an age when most individuals were illiterate, and providing a woman with a thorough education was largely viewed as unnecessary.Lorber, Judith Gender Inequality: Feminist Theories and Politics, Pages 1-3. Roxbury, MA: Roxbury Pub., 2001Smith, R. Drew Freedom's Distant Shores: American Protestants and Post-colonial Alliances, Page 111. Waco: Baylor University Press, 2006 Quaker women as well as men acted as ministers.Cahn, Susan. Industry of Devotion: The Transformation of Women's Work in England, Page 115. New York: Columbia University Press, 1987 While most Quakers did not agitate vocally for abolition, the majority condemned slavery as brutal and unjust. It was in this atmosphere that Haviland was raised. In 1815, her family left Canada and returned to the United States, settling in the remote and sparsely populated town of Cambria, in western New York. At the time there was no school near their home, and for the next six years Haviland's education consisted of little more than \\"a spelling lesson\\" given to her daily by her mother. Haviland described herself as an inquisitive child, deeply interested in the workings of the world around her, who at a young age began questioning her parents about everything from scripture to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. Once she had mastered spelling, Haviland supplemented her meager education by devouring every book she could borrow from friends, relatives, and neighbors, reading everything from religious material to serious historical studies. At sixteen, Laura met Charles Haviland, Jr., a devout young Quaker, whose parents were both respected ministers. They were married on November 11, 1825, at Lockport, New York. According to Laura, Charles was a devoted husband and theirs was a happy marriage. They were the parents of eight children. The Havilands spent the first four years of their marriage in Royalton Township, near Lockport, New York, before moving in September, 1829, to Raisin, Lenawee County, in the Michigan Territory. They settled three miles (5 km) from the homestead her parents acquired four years earlier. Michigan was then a largely unsettled wilderness, but land was cheap, and there were a number of other Quakers in the vicinity. Anti-slavery work and the Raisin Institute Haviland vividly recalled seeing African Americans verbally abused, and even physically assaulted, in Lockport, New York, when she was a child. These experiences, combined with the horrific descriptions in John Woolman's history of the slave-trade, made an indelible impression. > The pictures of these crowded slave-ships, with the cruelties of the slave > system after they were brought to our country, often affected me to tears > ... My sympathies became too deeply enlisted for the poor negroes who were > thus enslaved for time to efface. Haviland and other members of the Raisin community helped Elizabeth Margaret Chandler organize the Logan Female Anti-Slavery Society in 1832. It was the first anti-slavery organization in Michigan.Laura Smith Haviland. Michigan Historical Center, Department of History, Arts and Libraries. The Official State of Michigan Website. http://www.michigan.gov/hal/0,1607,7-160-15481_19271_19357-163242--,00.html Five years later, in 1837, Haviland and her husband founded a \\"manual labor school ... designed for indigent children,\\" which was later known as the Raisin Institute. Haviland instructed the girls in household chores, while her husband and one of her brothers, Harvey Smith, taught the boys to perform farm work. At the Havilands' insistence, the school was open to all children, \\"regardless of race, creed, or sex.\\" It was the first racially integrated school in Michigan.Berson, Robin Kadison. Marching to a Different Drummer: Unrecognized Heroes of American History, pages 114-120. Greenwood Press, 1994 Some of Haviland's white students, upon learning they were to study with African Americans, threatened to leave. Most were persuaded to remain, however, and Laura wrote that once the students were together in the classroom their prejudices \\"soon melted away.\\" In 1838, Harvey Smith sold his farm, and the proceeds were used to erect accommodations for fifty students. The Havilands expanded the school's curriculum, operating it more closely along the lines of traditional elementary and secondary schools. They then hired a graduate of Oberlin College to serve as the school's principal. Due to their diligence, the Raisin Institute was soon recognized as one of the best schools in the Territory. As the Havilands became more actively involved in anti- slavery work, tensions grew within the Quaker community. There was a split between the so-called \\"radical abolitionists,\\" like the Havilands, who wanted immediate emancipation, and the majority of Orthodox Quakers. Although the Quakers condemned slavery, most did not approve of active participation in abolitionist societies.Grover, Kathryn. The Fugitive's Gibraltar: Escaping Slaves and Abolitionism in New Bedford, Massachusetts, page 32. Boston: Univ of Massachusetts Press, 2001 By 1839, in order to continue with their abolitionist work, the Havilands, her parents, and fourteen other like-minded Quakers, felt compelled to resign their membership.Hinshaw, William Wade. Encyclopedia of American Quaker Genealogy. Vol. IV, Page 1366. Transcribed records from the Adrian Monthly Meeting, Michigan Territory. They then joined a group of Methodists known as the Wesleyans, who were equally devoted to the abolitionist cause. In the spring of 1845, an epidemic of erysipelas killed six members of Haviland's family, including both of her parents, her husband, and her youngest child. Haviland also fell ill, but survived. At thirty-six, Haviland found herself a widow with seven children to support, a farm to run, the Raisin Institute to manage, and substantial debts to repay. Sadly, just two years later tragedy struck again, when her eldest son died. Due to lack of funds, Haviland was forced to close the Raisin Institute in 1849. In spite of her personal losses, she continued with her abolitionist work, and in 1851, she helped organize the Refugee Home Society in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. Fugitive slaves were settled there, a church and school were erected for them, and each family was given twenty-five acres to farm.Foner, Philip S. History of Black Americans: From the Compromise of 1850 to the End of the Civil War, page 151. Greenwood Press, 1983. Laura remained on for several months as the settlement's teacher.Foner, Philip S. History of Black Americans: From the Compromise of 1850 to the End of the Civil War, pages 151-152. Greenwood Press, 1983. She then traveled to Ohio, where, with her daughter Anna, she taught in a school founded for African American children in Cincinnati and Toledo, Ohio. By 1856, she had raised enough funds to reopen the Raisin Institute, and returned to Michigan. The new curriculum included having former slaves give lectures about the realities of life on a slave plantation. The Institute closed once again in 1864, after most of the staff, and some of the students, enlisted to fight during the Civil War. Work for the Underground Railroad During the 1830s, the Haviland family began hiding runaway slaves on their farm. Their home became the first Underground Railroad station established in Michigan. After her husband's death, Haviland continued to shelter fugitive slaves in her home, in some cases, personally escorting them to Canada. She played an important role in the Detroit branch of the group, where she was considered railroad \\"superintendent\\", with George DeBaptiste the \\"president\\"and William Lambert the \\"vice president\\" or \\"secretary\\".Tobin, Jacqueline L. From Midnight to Dawn: The Last Tracks of the Underground Railroad. Anchor, 2008. p200-209 She also traveled to the South on multiple occasions to aid escaped slaves. Her first trip was made in 1846, in an effort to free the children of fugitive slaves, Willis and Elsie Hamilton. The children were still in the possession of their mother's former slave owner, John P. Chester, a tavern-keeper in Washington County, Tennessee.1850 United States Census. The 4th Subdivision, Washington Co., TN, Page 113A. Chester had learned of the Hamilton's whereabouts and sent slave-catchers after them. When that failed, Chester attempted to lure the Hamiltons to his plantation with the promise that they would be treated as freedmen and reunited with their children. Suspecting a trap, Haviland went to Tennessee in their place, accompanied by her son Daniel and a student from the Raisin Institute, James Martin, who posed as Willis Hamilton. Mr. Chester became irate once he realized Willis Hamilton was not with Mrs. Haviland. He held the trio at gunpoint, threatening to murder them, kidnap James Martin, and enslave him in Willis Hamilton's stead. They managed to escape, but Mr. Chester did not forget Laura Haviland. His family would continue to haunt her for fifteen years, pursuing her legally in court and privately with slave catchers, while barraging her with derogatory letters. The following letter was sent by Chester's son, Thomas K. Chester, in February 1847. It's provides a good example of the tone which permeated the Chester family's correspondence with Haviland: Haviland responded, sarcastically thanking him for naming the child after her family and stating that she hoped \\"like Moses, may he become instrumental in leading his people away from a worse bondage than that of Egypt.\\" Enraged by what he deemed her insolence, Thomas Chester placed a bounty on Haviland's head. All throughout the South he circulated \\"hand-bills\\" (fliers) describing Mrs. Haviland, detailing her abolitionist work, naming her place of residence and offering $3000, a considerable sum at the time, to anyone willing to kidnap or murder her on his behalf. Three years later, after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law, the Chester family attempted to have Haviland tried under the new statute for \\"stealing\\" their slaves. Haviland not only ran the risk of being physically harmed by angry slave-owners, like the Chesters, or their slave-catchers, if found guilty of violating the Fugitive Slave Law she would also be subject to hefty fines and imprisonment. Still, Haviland was determined to continue with her work, no matter what the personal cost: > ... I would not for my right hand become instrumental in returning one > escaped slave to bondage. I firmly, believe in our Declaration of > Independence, that all men are created free and equal, and that no human > being has a right to make merchandise of others born in humbler stations, > and place them on a level with horses, cattle, and sheep, knocking them off > the auction-block to the highest bidder, sundering family ties, and > outraging the purest and tenderest feelings of human nature. Fortunately for Haviland, her case was brought before Judge Ross Wilkins, who sympathized with the abolitionists. The Chesters attempted to regain possession of the Hamiltons by force, but were prevented by Haviland and her neighbors. Judge Wilkins delayed her case, allowing Haviland to help the Hamiltons escape to Canada. In the end, Haviland evaded legal punishment. In addition to another failed rescue attempt, detailed in her autobiography, Haviland later made other, more successful journeys south that went unmentioned in her memoirs. In the guise of a white cook, and once even posing as a fair skinned free person of color, she visited plantations and managed to help some slaves escape north.Jeffrey, Julie Roy. The Great Silent Army of Abolitionism: Ordinary Women in the Antislavery Movement, page 221. University of North Carolina Press, 1998. Civil War and Reconstruction Laura Haviland holding slave irons. During the Civil War, Laura toured many refugee camps and hospitals, even venturing onto the frontlines, to distribute supplies to displaced citizens, freed slaves, and soldiers. In the spring of 1865, the commissioner of the newly created Freedmen's Bureau, General Oliver O. Howard, named Haviland Inspector of Hospitals.Blanding, Leonard Clark. Genealogy of the Blanding Family, Page 496. Published privately by the author, 1995 Haviland's actual duties consisted of far more than inspecting hospitals. She spent the next two years traveling through Virginia, Tennessee, Kansas and Washington, D.C., distributing supplies, reporting on the living conditions of Freedmen and indigent whites, organizing refugee camps, establishing schools, working as a teacher, volunteering as a nurse at Freedmen's hospitals, and giving public lectures. In an effort to help whites understand what the Freedmen had endured under slavery, she toured abandoned plantations and collected chains, irons, restraints, and other implements which had been used on slaves. Haviland transported these items north and exhibited them during her lectures. She also met personally with President Andrew Johnson to petition for the release of former slaves still being held in Southern prisons for attempting years before to escape slavery. While working at the Freedmen's Hospital in Washington, D.C., Haviland met and befriended Sojourner Truth, who later recalled an incident that took place one day when they had gone into town to get supplies. Haviland suggested they take a street car back to the hospital. Truth described what happened next as follows: The Haviland Home orphanage After the Civil War, the Freedmen's Aid Commission acquired the former Raisin Institute, renamed it the Haviland Home, and converted it into an orphanage for African American children. Its first residents were seventy- five homeless children brought by Haviland from Kansas. As other children joined their ranks, and their numbers increased, many whites in Michigan became unnerved. They claimed that Haviland was burdening white taxpayers and demanded that Haviland Home be closed. Matters came to a head in 1867, when the orphanage was purchased by the American Missionary Association, who closed the orphanage, and literally threw the orphans out into the street. Haviland abandoned her work in Washington, D.C., to return to Michigan and help the children. She managed to collect enough donations to purchase the orphanage and began to manage it herself. By 1870, funds were extremely scarce. The situation became so dire that, at Haviland's urging, the state took over the orphanage and it became the Michigan Orphan Asylum. Later years When the Reconstruction ended in 1877, many African Americans fled the South, where they were subject to attacks by racist individuals and groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. Thousands of African American men, women and children, crowded into makeshift refugee camps in Kansas. Determined to help, Haviland set out with her daughter Anna for Washington, D.C., where she testified about the appalling conditions at the camps, before traveling to Kansas with supplies for the refugees. Using her personal savings, Haviland purchased in Kansas for the Freedmen at one of the refugee camps to live on and farm. Death and legacy During her life, Laura Haviland not only combated slavery and worked to improve the living conditions of Freedmen, she was also actively involved in other social causes, advocating for women's suffrage, and helping to organize the Women's Christian Temperance Union in Michigan. Laura Haviland died on April 20, 1898 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, at the home of her brother, Samuel Smith.Ancestry.com.

Symbolically, at Haviland's funeral, hymns were sung by a choir of white and African American singers, and then her casket was carried to the grave by a group white and African American pall- bearers. In recognition of her efforts, the town of Haviland, Kansas was named in her honor. A statue of Laura Haviland stands in front of the Lenawee County Historical Museum in Adrian, Michigan.

Hayden (January 15, 1890 - February 18, 1973) was an American painter who depicted African-American life, landscapes, seascapes, and African influences. He sketched, painted in both oils and watercolors, and was a prolific artist of his era. Early life Born Peyton Cole Hedgeman\\"Palmer C. Hayden papers, 1920-1970\\", Archives of American Art, Smithsonian. on January 15, 1890, in Widewater, Virginia, Palmer C. Hayden drew during his childhood, and was introduced into the arts by his older brother who drew as well. (Speculations regarding how many other siblings he had exist, but cannot be proved.) Despite his early interest in art, Hayden's initial ambition was to become a fiddle player, but several obstacles prevented this, two of which were his demure nature and the financial hardships of his family. In reflection years into his seniority, Hayden stated he still continued to regret not following his initial ambition, unwavered by his success as an artist. This conflict is reflected at times in his art; in particular, Midnight at the Crossroads is a personal painting that depicts the decision he was forced to make. The explicit tilt of his feet and face in the direction of the musician's path, yet his ultimate descent down the path of the artist signifies just how powerful of a conflict this was for Hayden. As an adolescent, Hayden relocated to Washington, D.C. in order to find work, where he became a porter and an errand boy. The subject of his sketches shifted to objects and activities he witnessed daily, such as sailboats and fishermen. It was in Washington, D.C. where Hayden ultimately began to pursue an art career, and where he first encountered an experience with explicit racism. Hayden had placed an ad in the local paper for an artist‚Äôs assistant, and was bewildered when he was rejected for being African-American upon arriving at the interview. Discouraged, Hayden decided to go into employment as a laborer for the Buffalo Bill Circus and then the Ringling Brothers Circus. He bounced from occupation to occupation with little commitment, then decided to enter the army's black company stationed in the Philippines. Hayden in the army. During his army service, Hayden was stripped of his birth name and was given the name Palmer Hayden instead by a commanding sergeant during World War I. The justification behind this abrupt decision is speculated but ultimately unknown, and two popular theories have emerged within the community of art historian; one theory is employed in Bearden and Henderson's book A History of African American Artists: 1792 to the Present, in which the story follows Hayden asking for a letter of reference from his previous job but having his name mistakenly written as Palmer Hayden instead of Peyton Hedgeman. Unwilling to ask for another letter that correctly identified him, he took the letter and adopted the name Palmer Hayden as he transitioned into the army. The alternate theory is stated in Driskell's Harlem Renaissance: Art of Black America, where it is claimed his commanding sergeant mispronounced his real name, giving him the name Palmer Hayden instead. Despite the modern dispute, it has been factually determined that he thereafter referred to himself as Palmer Hayden and eventually legally changed his name a decade later. Within the army, he found himself pleased with the amount of spare time he had and even found a tutor in second lieutenant Arthur Boetscher, who enjoyed map drawing and would often loosely instruct Hayden. This marked Hayden's first real encounter with any form of artistic education. After four years of participation, Hayden decided to enlist again and this time, was assigned to the 10th Cavalry at West Point. While he was not a cadet, his role was taking care and training the horses that the cadets learned to ride on. At this time, he also enrolled himself in a correspondence drawing course, on which he spent $10 monthly out of the $18 he made monthly. After he was discharged from the army, he relocated to Greenwich Village, a neighborhood located in lower Manhattan within New York City. During the pursuit of his slowly developing art career, he worked as a postal clerk, janitor, and a variety of other part- time jobs in order to provide for himself. This period of his life was disheartening, but was justified when Hayden eventually became a prolific Harlem artist of his era. Artistic beginnings and Parisian travels Hayden pursued artistic professionalism by studying charcoal drawing at Columbia University as he simultaneously worked nights at the post office. While this initially satisfied him, he later determined that his night job ate up more of his time than he liked, so he quit and began janitorial services in various apartment buildings throughout New York City. Coincidentally, the first tenant he worked for was Victor Perard, an artist and art instructor at the Cooper Union, previously called the Cooper Institute. Hayden was hired to clean Perard's studio and was encouraged to continue to develop his art. Hayden eventually decided to pursue a formal education, and studied at the Cooper Union in New York City, Columbia University, and privately with Perard, practicing independent studies at Boothbay Art Colony in Maine during the summers as well. A chance encounter with Alice Dike, a woman for whom he was moving furniture, led to the discussion of art and his experience as an artist. Compelled by his cause, Dike provided him with a brochure from her church broadcasting The Harmon Foundation's Award for Distinguished Achievement, which encouraged individuals to participate and enter their pieces. Hayden decided to enter and in 1926, he won a sum of money and a gold medal for his painting Schooners after being recognized as the recipient of the Distinguished Achievement in Visual Arts in the Harmon Foundation's first awards ceremony. In response to this honor, a New York Times headline crudely glorified him, stating ‚ÄúNegro Worker Wins Harmon Art Prizes: Gold Medal and $400 Awarded to Man who Washes Windows to Have Time to Paint\\", suggesting his employment and race were defining factors of his craft as opposed to his extensive efforts. While racially involved themes were not quite yet prominent concepts in Hayden's work, The Harmon Foundation's white founder William E. Harmon was nonetheless making a blatant social statement by publicly praising art created by an African-American man from a struggling background. The award is additionally credited for launching his career as an artist because of how prestigious of an accomplishment it was seen for anyone, but especially for a simple janitor. Hayden's success with The Harmon Foundation allowed the existence of his premier solo show in April 1926 at the Civic Club. Following his achievements, Hayden combined accumulated funds, as well as his trophy money from The Harmon Foundation and a gracious gift of $3,000 from Dike, to travel to Paris, France, where he found further inspiration for his art. He did not enroll in art school there but the next five years spent in Paris were productive regardless, and Hayden captured not only Parisian society, but also the integration of Afro-European into the upscale environment. He was mentored for a short while by an artist named Clivette Le Fevre, but ultimately, the relationship ended because of Le Fevre's disbelief in Hayden's talents. Hayden's years in Paris, as well as his arguably primitive style, is particularly evident in the 1930 piece Nous Quatre a Paris, which portrays four black men in a cafe, drawn with stereotypically large lips and cartoonish facial features to emphasize characteristically black features that were shunned and often seen as revolting, as a result of the discourse from white beauty. While in France, Hayden did not remain stationed in Paris and also traveled to the coasts in order to continue painting landscapes and seascapes. He was particularly fond of Concarneau, a small village primarily sustained by fishermen, and painted several scenes of the town, one of which being Concarneau - Andr√©e de la Mer. He also visited several museums and a variety of exhibits, such as the Louvre, and found inspiration within its walls. Hayden became acquainted with philosopher Alain Locke, who showed him African art he had collected from his extensive travels. Hayden's admiration for African art led him to paintings depicting African designs, patterns, and forms, such as Fetiche et Fleurs in 1933. He was also fascinated by the establishment of colonial Northern African towns and sketched what he saw in museums and exhibits. Return, racial commentary and stylistics After five years abroad, traveling with funds borrowed from the American Aid Society of Paris, a non-profit organization meant to support Americans abroad, Hayden decided to return to the United States on August 11, 1932. He remained in New York City, where he had lived before going abroad, and upon his return, he became a Works Progress Administration artist with an impressive salary of about $30 weekly. In contrast to his active involvement with African culture and racism abroad, Hayden painted mostly buildings and landscapes at this time. In his free time, he continued with oil and watercolor paintings, but also dabbled in pen and ink drawings. His artwork is most notable for depicting African-American life during the Harlem Renaissance, as well as racial conflicts/obstacles, perceptions of racism, and African folklore. His paintings have been described by some critics as primitive and demeaning for depicting xenophobic stereotypes of African Americans by exaggerating bosoms, lips, and nostrils and portraying the mass consumption of watermelon and other foods associated with black racism, such as in The Watermelon Race. Other art historians find some of the earliest indications of black empowerment in Hayden's work for his ownership and embracement of defining stereotypes that he regurgitated at critics through their exaggerated impact. A great number of his paintings following his years in Paris were associated with the Harlem Renaissance and black urban life in the city. However, while depictions of African-American life are what he is most remembered for, they are not his sole claim to fame; Hayden's career began with landscape portrayal and this continued simultaneously alongside his racially influenced art, with nature originally more prominent than the depictions of African-American life. A particular interest of his was seascapes and life in bustling harbors, as it had been in his adolescence. These particular scenes often held a religious significance for him, which was not further elaborated on by Hayden. Additionally, as his comfort within the artistic community grew, he offered a political voice in his paintings, and in 1935, he depicted The Execution of NIRA, which referenced the Supreme Court's refusal of the National Industrial Recovery Act on the grounds of unconstitutionality. Hayden branching out artistically became more evident as his work became more outspoken and experimental. One of Hayden's most prolific works came in 1937, when he created the iconic alleged narrative The Janitor Who Paints. This painting, labeled a protest painting √† la The Execution of NIRA, was thought by critics to be a personal commentary on Hayden's sentiments regarding the assorted, meagerly paid early jobs he had to take in order to survive that he was criticized for in the press. Despite his success and popularity not only in America, but also in Europe, Hayden was still regarded by some as an lowly janitor who had little to no artistic training and worth. In this painting, an African-American woman, man, and child are depicted in a crowded area which is made even more stifled by a canvas, cleaning supplies, and simple home decoration. All three are shown with thick, prominent lips, characteristic of caricatures of African people, and in the first draft, a bold portrait of Abraham Lincoln was hung on the wall. The title of the painting, as well as the contrast of cleaning supplies and art material, imply a balance, such as the one that existed in Hayden's own life before he was recognized for his work. Inevitably, Hayden was scrutinized by both the black and white community as problematic for seemingly endorsing negative stereotypes in this painting as well. The aged Hayden Ten years after his initial visit in 1926, Hayden returned to Paris briefly; little else is known about this visit. He was back in New York within a year and at the age of 50, he married Miriam Huffman. He decided in 1944 to begin a new project, which resulted in a three-year effort that culminated his most fulfilling works: The John Henry series. The idea was rooted in a legend he had been told in childhood by his father and he took to researching the legitimacy of the folktale, drawing inspiration to integrate into his art. Any other explanations for why Hayden felt so strongly about John Henry and the series as a whole are unclear and unspecified, but are most likely linked to his proud ties to the African-American community. In his elder years, Hayden continued to be active with his art, regularly being selected for prestigious awards and traveling between Paris and the United States to fuel his inspiration. Racism remained a relevant topic in his life and art, leading him to publicly speak out against racist policies hindering the African-American and Hispanic communities. An example of this was seen in 1966, when Hayden wrote to William Booth, the Chairman of the City Commission on Human Rights, regarding the advocacy for an equal number of African Americans, Latinos, and white people on the board to prevent mistreatment fueled by prejudice and power. Hayden died on February 18, 1973, shortly after receiving a grant to depict Negro soldiers between the world wars.

This small insectivorous bird inhabits the coniferous and mixed forests of western North America. The name of this bird commemorates William Alexander Hammond who was the surgeon general of the US Army. Hammond collected bird specimens for Spencer Fullerton Baird.  Description  Adults are 12‚Äì14 cm long (4.7-5.5 in), span about 22 cm (8.7 in) across the wing and weigh 8-12 g (0.3-04 oz). They have grayish-olive upperparts, darker on the wings and tail, with whitish underparts; they have a conspicuous white eye ring, white wing bars, a small bill and a short tail. The breast is washed with grey and the sides of the belly with yellow. Female usually have a shorter, wider bill compare with male's. Immature are similar to adults, but have broader wing bars and are more buff. Many species of Empidonax flycatchers look closely alike. Hammond's flycatchers are mainly confused with Dusky (E. oberholseri) and Gray (E. wrightii) flycatchers, which are similar in color and size and have an overlapping range. The best way to distinguish the Hammond's flycatcher is by its call, breeding habitat and/or range.  Taxonomy  Hammond's flycatchers are part of the genus Empidonax, which includes a dozen of other species. Despite the relatively large range of the species, the Hammond's flycatcher does not present a lot of genetic variations. This might be the result of a bottleneck event, that could have occurred when the species range was confined to the South of the Pleistocene ice. The bird's morphology, including its plumage, is also consistent across its range. However, there are evidence showing that some Hammond's flycatcher on Vancouver Island, in British Columbia, have evolved longer, thicker bills in the absence of Western flycatchers, which occupy a very similar niche but usually has a thicker bill than the Hammond's flycatcher. The Hammond's, the Dusky and the Gray flycatchers are sister species, with no evidence of interbreeding.  Habitat and distribution  The Hammond's flycatcher is a migratory species, breeding in Western North America and wintering in Mexico and Central America. = Habitat = Their preferred breeding habitats are mature coniferous and mixed forests. They are typically found in dense fir forests, conifer and aspen forests and dogwood. Their habitats on wintering grounds are similar to the ones used as breeding grounds. = Distribution = Hammond's flycatchers can be found in the Western United States, including Montana, Wyoming, California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado. In Canada, their range include British Columbia, Yukon and Alberta. Certain birds have been found as far North as Alaska. Overall, their breeding range is formed by regions that have been greatly influenced by past glaciation events. These birds are migratory and winter in Mexico and in Central America.  Behavior  = Vocalizations = The song is a multi versed hoarse ssilit, greeep, silit, pweet. The call is a sharp peek. Hammond's flycatchers do not sing during the fall migration or on wintering grounds. They start singing in early May, shortly after their arrival on breeding grounds. The frequency of the song is usually higher at the beginning of the mating season and drops as summer progresses; males that do not have a partner sing more often and at a higher frequency than paired males. Like in other species of the genus Empidonax, bill snapping and mandibles clicking are commonly used in a threatening context. = Diet = Their favorite preys include beetles, flies, bees, butterflies and moths, with a mean length of 5.7 mm and a mean weight of 1.656 mg. True beetles, and net- winged insects can also be part of their diet. They wait on an open perch high or in the middle of a tree and fly out to catch insects in flight, (hawking), also sometimes picking insects from foliage while hovering, (gleaning). = Reproduction = These birds are believed to be monogamous and show no evidence of extra-pair copulation. Male Hammond's flycatcher physically fight at the beginning of the breeding season, locking themselves together in midair and fluttering to the ground. They tend to nest on high, small to medium-sized branches of tall trees. They also prefer areas where they can be covered by leaves, on the northeast or southwest sides of trees. Finally, they prefer old-growth forest, with a minimum age of 80 to 90 years. They make a cup nest on a fork in a tree. Females usually lay in early June three or four creamy white eggs, sometimes marked with small reddish-brown dots. The female incubates the eggs for about 15 days. The hatchlings are altricial; both the male and the female are responsible of feeding the young.

In furniture and other decorative arts, it is an ornamental carved band of tapered, curving and sometimes alternating concave and convex sections, usually diverging obliquely either side of a central point, often with rounded ends vaguely reminiscent of flower petals. Gadrooning, derived from Roman sarcophagi (illustration) and other antiquities, was widely used during the Italian Renaissance, and in the classicising phases of 18th- and early 19th- century design. In medieval European metalwork gadroons on circular dishes are often tapering, ending in a point on a central circular zone, and run diagonally across the surface in a spiral. Similar, but typically not tapered, designs were popular in Rococo porcelain and metalwork. In Renaissance or neo- classical work they are normally thinner and straighter. The term may also be applied to spiraling stop-fluting running up a classical column.

It runs north-northwest from the Boulevard des Italiens to the √âglise de la Sainte-Trinit√©. In the 17th century the chemin des Porcherons crossed a swampy piece of ground north of the porte Gaillon, a city gate in the wall built during the reign of Louis XIII, leading to the village of Les Porcherons. It is called a chauss√©e because the marshy ground required raised construction that ran along the top of a sort of dyke. At the rue de Provence it crossed the \\"great sewer\\" or , which was approximately two meters wide. Under an ordinance dated 4 December 1720, the street was graded and resurveyed as a wider boulevard with a width of eight toises and extended to meet the grands boulevards to the south. This new boulevard stretched from the end of to Rue Saint-Lazare. The frequent stays of Louis XV in Paris led to the building of splendid homes such as that of Louis Antoine de Pardaillan de Gondrin, the Duke of Antin (1665‚Äì1736).

Notable places At the intersection of the Boulevard des Capucines, stood the former h√¥tel de Montmorency, which gave way to the Th√©√¢tre du Vaudeville in 1869, and then the Paramount Op√©ra cinema theater in 1927. The main hall of the theater corresponds to the 'grand salon' -- probably a ballroom‚Äîof the 18th-century h√¥tel. The rotunda above the facade has been preserved. The notorious stood on the present site of the √âglise de la Sainte-Trinit√©. It opened in 1724, and could accommodate 600 people for public festivities. At the intersection of the Boulevard des Italiens stood the barracks of the Gardes Fran√ßaises - a regiment of the royal guard which was to play a key role in the revolutionary events of July 1789. The barracks was built by the Duke of Biron in 1764. It gave the boulevard its name for some years. On 12 July 1789, a platoon of the French Guards saved its colonel, M.

She had a private chapel and a theater. The duke's secretary baron Grimm and Madame d'Epinay lived in one of the apartments. Grimm hosted Mozart and his mother for five months in 1778. The street's most famous resident, Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, also lived here from 1833 to 1836. Frequent visitors included Franz Liszt. H√¥tel of Mlle Guimard * At n¬∞9, the h√¥tel of mademoiselle Guimard, who made her reputation as a dancer at the Op√©ra, where she earned 600 livres a year. She made her fortune however as the mistress of the prince de Soubise, and lived in an advanced Neoclassical building erected for her by Claude-Nicolas Ledoux in 1770-73. It was dubbed the \\"temple of Terpsichore crowned by Apollo\\", a reference to Mlle Guimard. The building had a 500-seat theater which rivalled the Op√©ra.

The consortium currently has over 40 adopters; key members behind the specification include Broadcom, Intel, LG, Panasonic, NEC, Samsung, SiBEAM, Sony, Philips and Toshiba. The founders intend the technology to be used for Consumer Electronic devices, PCs, and portable devices. The specification was finalized in January 2008.  Technology  The WirelessHD specification is based on a 7 GHz channel in the 60 GHz Extremely High Frequency radio band. It allows either lightly compressed (proprietary wireless link-aware codec) or uncompressed digital transmission of high-definition video and audio and data signals, essentially making it equivalent of a wireless HDMI. First-generation implementation achieves data rates from 4 Gbit/s, but the core technology allows theoretical data rates as high as 25 Gbit/s (compared to 10.2 Gbit/s for HDMI 1.3 and 21.6 Gbit/s for DisplayPort 1.2), permitting WirelessHD to scale to higher resolutions, color depth, and range. The 1.1 version of the specification increases the maximum data rate to 28 Gbit/s, supports common 3D formats, 4K resolution, WPAN data, low-power mode for portable devices, and HDCP 2.0 content protection. The 60 GHz band usually requires line of sight between transmitter and receiver, and the WirelessHD specification ameliorates this limitation through the use of beam forming at the receiver and transmitter antennas to increase the signal's effective radiated power, find the best path, and utilise wall reflections. The goal range for the first products will be in-room, point-to-point, non line-of-sight (NLOS) at up to 10 meters. The atmospheric absorption of 60 GHz energy by oxygen molecules limits undesired propagation over long distances and helps control intersystem interference and long distance reception, which is a concern to video copyright owners. The WirelessHD specification has provisions for content encryption via Digital Transmission Content Protection (DTCP) as well as provisions for network management. A standard remote control allows users to control the WirelessHD devices and choose which device will act as the source for the display.  Competition  WirelessHD competes with WiGig in some applications. WiGig transmits in the same 60 GHz band used by WirelessHD.

It continues to follow James T. \\"Joker\\" Davis through his Vietnam odyssey. The book was supposed to be the second of a \\"Vietnam Trilogy\\", but Hasford died before writing the third installment. Plot The novel begins sometime after The Short-Timers leaves off and is divided into three parts. =\\"The Winter Soldiers\\"= Having been demoted from Sergeant to Private, Joker is still at the Khe Sanh base, which is about to be abandoned by American Marines after withstanding a two- month siege. He believes most of his previous squad-mates are dead, even the seemingly indestructible Animal Mother. Joker blames their deaths on \\"The Phantom Blooper\\": an elusive enemy, supposedly American and armed with an M79 grenade launcher, who fights alongside the Viet Cong against his countrymen. Joker is still haunted by the memory of his friend Cowboy, who had been wounded and whom Joker mercy-killed in order to keep their squad from being cut down by a sniper. As a result, Joker's behavior has become increasingly erratic and violent. He sets up one of his squad-mates to be killed in an attempt to draw the Phantom Blooper out of hiding, then forces an inattentive Marine on guard duty to hold a live hand grenade with the pin out. Later, as the Viet Cong attempt to overrun the base, Joker splits his platoon sergeant's tongue with a straight razor. The Marines turn back the attack, suffering heavy losses in the process. The next night, Joker ventures out in search of the Phantom Blooper, but is wounded by friendly fire and captured by the enemy. =\\"Travels With Charlie\\"= Joker has been living and working in a small Viet Cong village for over a year since his capture, waiting for a chance to escape. He has not been tortured or sent to a POW camp, and his captors have begun to trust him to some degree. In Joker's mind, his best chance is to fool them into believing he has converted to their cause, to accompany them on an attack against an American position, and then to make his escape when the shooting starts. As time passes, however, he begins to side increasingly with the Viet Cong, seeing them - the people he has been trained to kill - as ordinary human beings just like himself. When a team of Army soldiers arrives to rescue him, he is wounded in the ensuing firefight but manages to shoot down one of their choppers with a discarded M79 before passing out. =\\"The Proud Flesh\\"= Joker is sent to Yokosuka Naval Hospital in Japan for medical treatment and psychological counseling. He quickly makes it clear that he does not regret any of his actions as a Viet Cong captive, and he expresses his disgust and outrage at having been sent by his country to fight in a futile war. Despite initial threats of a court-martial for treason, he is eventually given a Section 8 discharge and sent home to the United States. Upon arriving in California, Joker finds that his squad radioman, Donlon, is alive, attending college, and protesting the war. Animal Mother, he also learns, was captured by the Viet Cong but escaped from a POW camp; he is still an active Marine. Joker and Donlon attend a demonstration that is quickly and forcefully broken up by the police, but Joker manages to slip away with the help of an ex-Marine cop who served with him at Khe Sanh. Next, Joker travels to Cowboy's home in Kansas, and has a brief and uneasy meeting with Cowboy's parents. Their son's body was never recovered from the jungle, and Joker chooses not to tell them that he mercy-killed Cowboy. Finally, Joker reaches his family's farm in Alabama, all the while feeling a growing disillusionment with the war and America. Deciding there is nothing left for him in the United States, and realizing that he has become the Phantom Blooper he was once obsessed with stopping, he sets out to return to Vietnam and his life among the Viet Cong villagers. Literary significance and criticism This sequel made less of an impact than The Short-Timers (1979), which was the basis for the film Full Metal Jacket (1987). (Some dialogue from The Phantom Blooper is also present in Full Metal Jacket.) Nonetheless, The Phantom Blooper was highly regarded by reviewers. Before Hasford died in 1993, he had planned to continue Joker's story in a third novel. However, the 2021 Russo- American direct-to-video animated movie Dustforce 3: Invasion of the Mighty Morphing Power Snatchers, which would be produced by Soyuzmultfilm alongside Klasky Csupo and Hitbox Films and released by Paramount Pictures, would be inspired by The Phantom Blooper: A Novel of Vietnam and Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures itself by adding the appearance of Splaat for the first time in his first direct-to-video animated movie role, as well as his gang and the characters from Love Live!

Behind her is a large body of water and above her is the moon. The woman's seated position, in combination with the crescent moon, recalls the High Priestess card, and we find a link as well in this card's representation of the characteristic feminine strength of intuition. The woman's blindfold and the sea show a necessity to rely not on immediate stimuli but on deeper thoughts and feelings, that part of the unconscious mind that we call our higher self. Her seated position, when conceptually paired with the balanced swords and the blindfold, may also recall the Justice card. Yet here the concept of justice is not one of retribution, but of making decisions that are balanced, moral and that we trust to be harmonious within and without ourselves. Unlike the \\"hoodwinked\\" woman held captive on the Eight of Swords, this card depicts a woman in control. The scene and the discipline of her pose do more to suggest that she has placed the blindfold on herself, as is done in many cultures, ritualistically, to encourage reliance on the other senses (for example the use of blindfolds in martial arts). The woman is blind in her situation, but she is safe, not only unafraid, but centered. She wields powerful weapons, but they are not held in a position that is threatening to her or anyone else. The moon and the sea reinforce this sense of calm and equanimity. This is a card of meditation, not of action. The crossed swords point to different possible directions, but for the moment the character is looking inward rather than outward and in the possession of an awesome power that protects her until she finds the direction to apply it.

Plot summary An exploratory spacecraft of the Galactic Corps, charged with opening up planets for human colonisation, sometimes by terraforming, crash-lands on an alien planet. They find that the ecology is heavy in ammonia, making the atmosphere unbreathable by humans, and the soil unsuitable for the Earth-type plants they have brought for colonisation. As they are unable to take off again, the crew spend their time trying to adjust the environment to make it suitable for possible future human colonists, by cultivating Earth plants which will create oxygen. Although they spend many years at this task, they fail and, one by one, they die of ammonia poisoning. As the last man dies, the flesh of the buried crew feeds the plants and finally helps them to flourish, providing the catalyst that alters the environment to become more Earth-like.

The crater to the south of the rille in the left half of the image is Silberschlag. The dark patch at the top right is the floor of the crater Boscovich. Oblique view also from Apollo 10, with Ariadaeus crater in lower left and Rima Ariadaeus extending to the horizon. Rima Ariadaeus is a linear rille on the Moon at . It is named after the crater Ariadaeus, which marks its eastern end. It is over 300 km long and is categorized as a straight rille because of its linear nature.  Formation  Some scientists think that the linear rilles might have formed after large impact events, while others believe that the rilles were formed as a surface manifestation of deep-seated dike systems when the Moon was still volcanically active. Rima Ariadaeus is thought to have been formed when a section of the Moon's crust sank down between two parallel fault lines (making it a graben or fault trough). Rima Ariadaeus shows no trace of associated volcanism and is thus considered to be an end member of the sequence where only pure faulting is involved i.e. a linear rille.  Age  The ridges crossing the rille trough of Rima Ariadaeus and the surrounding plains units have been offset by the trough, proving that the ridges are older than the faults. Some craters are cut off by the faults and are, therefore, older. Other craters lie on the wall of the trough and are younger than the faulting. The faulting must be relatively young because so few craters appear to be younger than the faults, and because the edges of the trough appear to be crisp and little affected by slumping and other mass wasting.  NASA photograph  Apollo mission photographs of the Rima Ariadaeus revealed a 300 km-long (about one eighteenth of the moon's diameter) rift line on the surface of the moon. On being asked in 2010 about Internet suggestions that this was proof of the Quranic story of the splitting of the moon, NASA scientist Brad Bailey said, \\"My recommendation is to not believe everything you read on the internet. Peer-reviewed papers are the only scientifically valid sources of information out there. No current scientific evidence reports that the Moon was split into two (or more) parts and then reassembled at any point in the past.\\" References External links * ","title":"Rima Ariadaeus"},{"id":"7734128","text":"Physica Scripta is an international scientific journal for experimental and theoretical physics.

Dhammika, along with 500 other lay followers (Pali: pancahi upasake-satehi), approaches the Buddha and his monks (Pali: bhikkhavo) and Dhammika asks the Buddha how should a disciple (Pali: sƒÅvako) be virtuous (Pali: sƒÅdhu) -- both a disciple who has gone from home to homeless (Pali: agƒÅrƒÅ anagƒÅrameti) and a disciple from a household (Pali: agƒÅrino ... panupƒÅsakƒÅse). Dhammika then proceeds to extol the Buddha's compassion and wisdom.Ireland (1983b) points out that Dhammika's elaborate veneration of the Buddha is an important part of this sutta insomuch that it models \\"faith\\" while the rest of the sutta discusses \\"moral discipline.\\" These two endeavors -- faith and discipline -- Ireland states, \\"are the basic requisites for making further progress on the Buddhist path.\\"  Monastic virtue  In response to Dhammika's question, the Buddha first addresses his monks and advises them as follows: * do alms rounds at the appropriate time * be rid of interest in the five senses * return from alms rounds, sit alone and turn inward * do not slander or blame others or seek out disputation * care for your food, dwelling and robes but do not become attached to them  Lay virtue  The Buddha notes that a householder's obligations prevent a householder from fully pursuing a monk's path.Ireland (1983b) compares the Buddha's comment here to the Buddha's last verse in the \\"Muni Sutta\\" (\\"The Sage,\\" Sn 1.12) which Ireland translates as: \\"As a peacock never approaches the swiftness of a swan, so a householder cannot imitate a bhikkhu, a hermit meditating in the forest.\\" Thus, the Buddha articulates \\"the layman's duty\\" (Pali: gahatthavatta), what are essentially the Five Precepts, as follows: # Do not kill or hurt living things or incite others to kill # Avoid taking what is not given or inciting others to do so # Observe celibacy or at least do not have sex with another's wife # Do not lie or incite others to lie # Do not drink or incite others to drink intoxicants For the Uposatha, the Buddha extols the practice of the Eight Precepts, which involve the aforementioned Five Precepts (with celibacy alone identified for the third precept) and the following three precepts added: * Do not eat at inappropriate times (traditionally meaning, one meal before noon) * Do not wear garlands or perfumes * Sleep at floor level The Buddha further stated that, when celebrating the Uposatha, with a purified heart (Pali: pasanna citto) and rejoicing mind (Pali: anumodamƒÅno), the wise (Pali: vi√±√±u) share their food and drink with monks of the Sangha. In the sutta's last verse, the Buddha advises that, if a lay person supports their parents and engages in fair trading, they will be reborn among self-radiant devas.

Although originally enlisting as a private, he was the first African-American soldier promoted to commissioned rank, as a line officer, in that conflict, as evidenced by the U.S. War Department's initial refusal of that promotion due to his \\"African descent.\\"Emilio 1995, p. 194. Swails was a free black who was so light in coloring that he was often mistaken as white.Emilio 1995, p. 194. He was single and employed mostly as a waiter in Cooperstown, New York at the start of the Civil War, and although he fathered several children by Sarah Thompson, they never married.AAHI 2010. His enlistment papers state he was employed as a boatman in Elmira, New York when he joined the army.Emilio 1995, p. 336. In 1863, he answered Frederick Douglass' call to arms and joined the 54th Massachusetts when it began forming, and served in that regiment, eventually being commissioned as an officer, until the end of the war. After the war, he settled in South Carolina and later Washington, D.C., becoming a lawyer and politician. Civil War career Stephen Swails was a member of the 54th Massachusetts, enlisting and then rising through the ranks to receive a commission. He joined Company F of the 54th on 23 April 1863 and was soon appointed the company's first sergeant.Emilio 1995, p. 336. Due to the loss of men in the assault on Fort Wagner, and when Colonel Edward Hallowell assumed command of the 54th, Swails was appointed acting sergeant-major of the 54th on 12 November 1863.Emilio 1995, p. 135. In early 1864, the regiment was posted to Florida as part of General Truman Seymour's expedition. On 20 February, while still performing duty as the regiment's sergeant-major, Swails was wounded in the head at the Battle of Olustee. Setting out toward the Union supply point at Sanderson, he soon fell unconscious on the road, but was placed on a cart by one of the 54th's officers.Emilio 1995, pp. 165, 169. On 26 February 1864, Colonel Hallowell, > ...In accordance with the desire of his officers as well as his own... > recommended to Governor Andrew that Sergeant Swails be commissioned in > recognition of many soldiery qualities and his gallantry at Olustee.Emilio > 1995, p. 179. On 26 March 1864, the regiment received a list of promotions approved by Governor Andrew, one of which was Swails' promotion to 2nd lieutenant.Emilio 1995, p. 183. Thus began the fight to secure for Stephen Swails what may have been the first commission as a line officer given to an African American in the Union Army.AAHI 2010.Cornish 2006.Emilio 1995, p. 268. In May 1864, while the regiment was posted on Morris Island, South Carolina, during the siege of Charleston, Swails' application to muster as a 2nd lieutenant with the regiment was refused by the War Department. The reason given was \\"Lieutenant Swails' African descent.\\" Colonel William Gurney, the post commander, ordered Swails to remove his officer's uniform and reassume duties as an enlisted man. However, Colonel Hallowell obtained a furlough for Swails and sent him, along with all the necessary paperwork, to Major General John Foster, commander of the Department of the South. Once there, Lieutenant Swails presented his case, and received General Foster's recommendation, which was forwarded to higher authority.Emilio 1995, p. 194. Lieutenant Swails then returned to duty with the regiment. In addition to correspondence between the Department of the South, Governor Andrew and the War Department, Lieutenant Swails also received a furlough to travel to Washington to present his own case. He then returned to duty. Finally, on 17 January 1865, orders were received from the War Department, authorizing Stephen Swails to muster as a 2nd lieutenant with the regiment, ending almost a year-long struggle on his behalf by Colonel Hallowell, Governor Andrew and the officers of the 54th. During this period, Swails continued to perform his duties as a line officer in Company D and participated in numerous actions.Emilio 1995, p. 268. On 11 April 1865, near Camden, South Carolina, Lieutenant Swails was wounded for a second time. While the 54th was on reconnaissance near a railroad junction, several locomotives, one with the steam up, were observed after dark. A detachment led by Lieutenant Swails rushed the trains and captured them. As Lieutenant Swails entered the cab of one locomotive, he waved his hat in triumph. This action drew the attention of the sharpshooters that he had deployed to shoot the trainmen if they tried to escape. Mistaking him for a white engineer, they fired at and wounded him.Emilio 1995, p. 296. Second Lieutenant Swails was promoted to 1st lieutenant on 28 April 1865 and discharged on 20 August 1865, when the regiment mustered out at Boston.Emilio 1995, p. 336. Post-war career After the war, Swails worked as an agent for the Freedmen's Bureau, practiced law in the South, and became active in the political life of South Carolina. He married Susan Aspinall, a mixed-race Charlestonian, who bore him three children, Irene, Stephen Jr. and Florine. (Because Sarah Thompson bore him a son named Stephen Jr., he had two children with that name.) He was the mayor of Kingstree, where he lived from 1868 to 1879. He served as a state senator for ten years (1868‚Äì1878), including three terms as president pro tem.Swain and Bullard 2010. Swails was a delegate to the 1868, 1872 and 1876 Republican national conventions. He became a member of the U.S. Electoral College, and also edited a newspaper, the Williamsburg Republican.AAHI 2010.Cornish 2006. He was forced out of politics after Reconstruction. After a white mob tried to assassinate him, he resigned from office and, through his Republican connections, obtained jobs in Washington, D.C. with the U.S. Postal Service and the United States Treasury Department.AAHI 2010.Cornish 2006. Stephen Swails is buried in the Friendly Society Cemetery, Charleston, South Carolina.Swain and Bullard 2010. Family Because of his complicated private life, Stephen Swails' descendants are plentiful, and live in Toronto, upstate New York, Philadelphia, and Atlanta. One of his surviving grandchildren was James Swails Sr., of Rochester, New York, who died in 2004. His granddaughter, Carolyn Janet Rollins, and another grandson, Robert Swails, are also deceased. Caroline Janet Rollins was a counselor in New Jersey. She married Joseph Tyler Jefferson. They have eight surviving children. Robert Swails Rollins was a Doctor of Internal Medicine, graduated from Lincoln University in Pennsylvania. He had two sons and a daughters and lived on Long Island, New York. Dr. Robert Swails Rollins was a flight surgeon in the United States Air Force and, after military service, had a practice on Long Island, New York. Citations References * *Egerton, Douglas (2016).

Your acts may be legitimate. However, you prefer to use your mind and intellect rather than force or via obvious means. The Reversed meaning of the card means excess use of intellect with little success on an outcome, to surrender, or to have little care on solving a problem. The questioner needs to break away from ingrained habits or ways to approach problems. Rider-Waite symbolism The figure is taking stealthy steps, looking back to examine the scene he is leaving.

In many countries around Europe it is used as a game card. This card has the numerical value of nine. In many countries Tarot cards are believed to tell the future, or have a divination usage. In these countries it is a very negative sign to have this card be turned. It is believed that it being turned can be instigated by others, as it might be coming up to show that one has been cruel to someone nearby.  Card appearance  This card has a lot to do with someone's mind and their doubts and pain. The card shows a person, most often a woman, lying down or sitting up but they are or were sleeping. When this card is reversed it can be about real or imagined doubts or pain, just as dreams can be about real or imagined parts of our life. Most often the person on the card is on a bridge symbolizing a person between the worlds of dreaming and reality or also the worlds of life and death. Above the person lies their fears, hanging above them in an airy or dreamy way; this can be represented through demons, devils or even a heavily agitated night sky. Often there are sharp objects such as swords or knives, representing that a persons fears may pierce or stab through them. The swords could also mean that they are there to help the person cut through their own difficulties.  Divination usage  If this card is shown in an upright position, it can mean deception, premonitions and bad dreams, suffering and depression, cruelty, disappointment, violence, loss and scandal. However, all of these may be overcome through faith and calculated inaction. This is the card of the martyr and with it comes new life out of suffering. This card can represent being plagued by fear, guilt, doubt, and worries that are to a large extent, unfounded. Chances are the person in question is dealing with a problematic situation or a difficult decision, but his or her worst fear is unlikely to materialize. If the card is shown in an ill- dignified or reversed manner then it has a different meaning. When turned this way it means distrust, suspicion, despair, misery or malice. Total isolation away from comfort and help: institutionalization, suicide, imprisonment and isolation. However, in a generally positive spread, the reversed meaning of this card can also indicate that the nightmare may be ending. The Nine of Swords reversed can actually be a hopeful card, counseling faith in the future and the promise of better days ahead.

Meaning and symbolism  Rider-Waite Tarot deck In the upright or positive light, the ten of swords represents destruction, being pinned down by a multitude of things or situations. The person lying on the ground, defeated and bleeding, may also represent a feeling of hopelessness and being trapped by emotions or mental anguish, since swords represent strife and the mind. Dark clouds hovering above the person signify despair and a bleak situation. However, upon closer examination of the images in the Rider-Waite card, any death or destruction, like all things, may not be permanent. There is hope in spite of the situation; the golden sky in the distance suggests that the current situation is bad, and things will improve. In the reversed state, the card indicates a troubling situation that will continue for a significant amount of time. The card suggests that the subject should not despair in difficult times, to avoid ruining future prospects for success.

Interpretation The Knight of Swords is often taken to represent a confident and articulate young man, who may act impetuously. The problem is that this Knight, though visionary, is unrealistic. He fights bravely, but foolishly. In some illustrations, he is shown to have forgotten his armor or his helmet. A 'rush to war' is a possibility with this warrior.

Although Nuamthong's body was found with a suicide note, family members testified that he had given no hint of being depressed or about to commit suicide.bact' is a name: Nuamthong Praiwal Prachatai, ‡∏à‡∏î‡∏´‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏à‡∏≤‡∏Å‡πÉ‡∏à‡πÅ‡∏ó‡πá‡∏Å‡∏ã‡∏µ‡πà‡∏û‡∏•‡∏µ‡∏ä‡∏µ‡∏û ‚Äú‡∏ä‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏´‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏¥‡∏î‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏Ñ‡∏á‡πÑ‡∏°‡πà‡∏û‡∏ö‡πÄ‡∏à‡∏≠‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏õ‡∏è‡∏¥‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏≠‡∏µ‡∏Å, 2 November 2006 Nuamthong wore a black T-shirt with a drawing of the Democracy Monument and a poem about the power of the masses.

The Young People for Democracy Movement (YPD) condemned Akara's views as ignorant and noted that, \\"His remark is an insult, as Thailand has a long history of people dying to defend democracy from dictatorship.\\" Prime Minister General Surayud Chulanont said he was saddened by the news but doubted there would be copycat suicide attempts. After his death, an interview Nuamthong had earlier given was partially aired by iTV. The broadcast came to an abrupt end after the Director of Army-owned Channel 5 called to give a warning. Additional troops were dispatched to keep order at the station.

Tarot cards are used throughout much of Europe to play tarot card games. In English-speaking countries, Tarot cards are utilized primarily for divinatory purposes. Huson, Paul, (2004) Mystical Origins of the Tarot: From Ancient Roots to Modern Usage, Vermont: Destiny Books, Mystical Origins of the Tarot Interpretations * The Queen of Swords traditionally corresponds to the roles of widow, crone, and divorc√©e. She is seen to have very high standards and can be highly critical of herself and others. * \\"For a woman in our culture,\\" states American Tarot reader and artist Tiffany Lee Brown, \\"this could look like a pretty enviable show of power.\\" In this interpretation, the Queen of Swords card represents what women have historically lacked for countless generations: \\"the boundaries, the physical ability, the power to completely lay out the terms under which we will parlay... to say how words are spoken in front of us, who does what to or toward our person.\\" The contemporary Queen of Swords may represent positive feminist traits such as self-sufficiency, independence, and intelligence. * The position of Queen of Swords in a reading is relevant to the card's interpretation. If the card appears in a future position, the queen could be \\"showing you the way,\\" wrote Mary K. Greer, author of \\"21 Ways to Read a Tarot Card\\" (Llewellyn, 2008) and other Tarot-related books. Greer encourages divinatory Tarot practitioners to avoid fixating on gender roles matching biological sex; a queen might represent the querent's father, for example. Smith-Rider-Waite symbolism This section pertains to the symbolism evident in the Queen of Swords card as depicted in the Smith-Rider- Waite Tarot deck, also known as the RWS or Smith-Waite deck, which was illustrated by Pamela Colman Smith, also known as Pixie. * The Queen of Swords is extending her hand, perhaps to reach for another; but she also holds her sword firmly before her, perhaps as a warning, a self-protection or a test for another. The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, or PKT notes that she is familiar with sorrow. * Her crown is made up of butterflies, which are symbolic of the element of air and the realm of the mind. This depiction can be seen as showing the freedom of her thought and her active intellect. * Note the difference between the pristine white clouds, and the darker ones showing up on the right bottom corner. The darker clouds may suggest her sorrows, as the PKT has specified. The lighter clouds highlight the unusual clarity of her mind and thoughts. This illustration may be compared with other sword court cards, where illustrator Pamela Colman Smith has painted mostly tarnished- looking clouds. * Some interpret the queen's hand held out in front as a signifier of putting thoughts into action. All the sword cards represent the mind and the element of air all the skyscapes will indicate the \\"emotion\\" of the card. The clouds low on the horizon in this card can be read as suggesting new ideas or a new enterprise.

The property is the site of the seat of the vast 18th- century land empire of Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1693-1781), the only ennobled British colonial proprietor to live in one of the North American colonies. The surviving remnants of his complex ‚Äî a later replacement brick house and Fairfax's stone land office ‚Äî were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. Description Greenway Court is located down a long private drive on the west side of White Post Road south of the village of White Post. The property now consists of about , although it was in the 18th century at the center of landholdings in excess of . Its principal feature today is a brick farmhouse built in 1828, the original plantation house having been demolished c. 1834. The main historic structure surviving from the period of the Fairfax residency is the Land Office, a c. 1762 single- story gable-roofed limestone structure, and there is also a timber smokehouse dating to the 18th century. History The Greenway Court Estate Office Greenway Court was the center of the \\"Northern Neck Proprietary\\" or \\"Fairfax Grant\\", which passed to Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron from his mother's family, the Culpepers, who had taken proprietorship of the land in 1673. Fairfax laid out the Greenway Court estate in 1747, intending it to be a much larger establishment than it became. The main house was a 1-1/2 story timber structure with long sloping roofs and corbelled brick chimneys. It was originally intended to house the land steward, but it was occupied by Fairfax with his nephew, Thomas Bryan Martin, until his death in 1781. Fairfax employed a young George Washington as a surveyor on his extensive land holdings. Abandoned, the roof of the main house at Greenway Court collapsed in 1834, after which the structure was pulled down. A visit to this estate is the subject of \\"A Night at Greenway Court,\\" an 1896 short story by Willa Cather. Unincorporated community Greenway Court is used as a name to describe the unincorporated community in which the former estate is located.

It is one of the twelve schools in the Chaffey Joint Union High School District. History In 1882, founders of the City of Ontario George and William Chaffey established the Chaffey College of Agriculture and an on-campus secondary school with assistance from the University of Southern California (USC). The local community was granted control of the secondary school in 1901 and named it Ontario High School. Ten years later, in 1911, the school was renamed to Chaffey High School. In 1967, a campus south of Chaffey High School was named Ontario High School. The Ontario Jaguars' rival school is the Chaffey Tigers; their annual football game is known as \\"The Cat Bowl\\". In 2014 the school was remodeled to include a modernized campus, a new two story building with 32 classrooms, and, for the first time in 47 years, a football stadium known as \\"Jaguar Stadium\\". The current principal is Eduardo Zaldivar, preceded by Cary Willborn. OHS is currently the last high school with lockers in the Chaffey Joint Union High School District. Campus Ontario High School was built on of land on the south side of Ontario, California. The campus has eight permanent classroom buildings, along with 34 portable classrooms, for a total of 110 separate classrooms, an auditorium, cafeteria and multi-purpose room, library, gym, locker room facilities, two pools, and fine arts and vocational facilities. In 2014, an extensive modernization took place with the help of \\"Measure P\\", constructing a new campus, a 2 story building, solar panels in the parking lot, and a new stadium in which the school will be able to host its first home football games. Academics Ontario High School follows a standard California high school curriculum as defined by the California Department of Education's High School Graduation Requirements and tests students with the Standardized Testing and Reporting (STAR) program and the California High School Exit Exam. Students have the opportunity to earn college credit through College Board Advanced Placement (AP) courses. In addition, Ontario High School has many honors classes, supports the Gifted and Talented Education (GATE) program and the National Honors Society, and participates in the nationwide Renaissance program. Arts Ontario High School supports a wide array of fine and performing arts including art, art history, music appreciation, drama, choir, dance, band, percussion, ceramics, and color guard classes. =Band, percussion, and color guard= Ontario High School's instrumentalists, percussionists, and color guard performers compete in the Southern California Judging Association (SCJA) circuit for marching season during the first three months of the academic year. For the remainder of the year the Color Guard competes as a \\"winter guard\\" against other guards while the instrument and percussion sections have their orchestral season. The band's major performances are the Holiday Showcase, Music Americana, and Pops! concerts. The Music Americana concert is unique because the band performs with the United States Marine Corps Band. The Color Guard also has several acts during the Holiday Showcase, the Pops! concerts, and their end of the year show, the Color Guard Spectacular. For most of its history, the marching season group was known as the Ontario High School Jaguar Band and Color Guard. They won many awards in band tournaments and marched in several parades throughout southern California. At a point between 2000 and 2008, the group was renamed the Ontario High School Pride. On November 1, 2008 the Ontario High School Pride entered the Surf City Open marching competition and won the highest \\"sweepstakes\\" awards and an invitation to the 2nd Annual California State Championship. This is the first time in its history that the combined marching band, percussion, and color guard competed in a state level competition. On November 22, 2008 the Ontario High School Pride won the 5A Division of the California State Championships for their performance titled \\"The Lion King Goes Broadway\\" and became the 2008 Division 5A California State Champions. Long-time band director Dave Berry retired at the close of the 2008-2009 school year. Ontario High School hired alumni Elyse Doremus to replace him and carry on his legacy in the 2009-2010 school year. =Dance= The school's dance classes‚ÄîDance Fundamentals, Core 2, Dance production and Dance Company‚Äîperform an end-of-the-year show to songs such as Bad Romance by Lady Gaga, Heads Will Roll by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Fuego by The Cheetah Girls, We Got the Beat by The Go-Gos, Street Lights by Kanye West, Hush Hush by The Pussycat Dolls, Send Me On My Way by Rusted Root, The Beautiful People by Marilyn Manson, Scars by Kelis, What's This from Nightmare Before Christmas, and I Took the Night by Chelly.

Channa later became a disciple of the Buddha and achieved arahantship, as is described in the 78th verse of the Dhammapada. Channa was a servant in the court of King ≈öuddhodana who was entrusted to attend to the needs of Siddhartha, who had been lavished and pampered in a series of purpose-built palaces in order to shield him from thoughts of pain and suffering. This was done due to a prophecy by the ascetic Asita, who predicted that Siddhartha would renounce the throne to become a spiritual leader were he to contemplate human suffering. Channa was the servant who served as the charioteer pulled by the horse Kanthaka, when Siddhartha saw the Four sights whilst meeting his subjects in the Sakya capital Kapilavastu, which prompted his decision to renounce the world. During these expeditions, Channa explained to Siddhartha the sights of an elderly man, a sick person, a dead person whose funeral was being conducted and finally, an ascetic who had renounced worldly life for a spiritual one, as Siddhartha who had been secluded from such sights within the palace was taken aback. Channa was later entrusted by Siddhartha to accompany him upon his escape from the palace to become an ascetic, whilst the remainder of the palace guards were asleep. After initially protesting and refusing to accept that Siddhartha would leave him, Channa saddled Kanthaka,http://www.rootinstitute.com/buddhism/buddhism_shakyamuni_sorrow.html guiding him out of the town aboard the horse to a forest by the edge of the Anoma River.http://www.watlaori.org/who%20is%20buddha.pdf Channa returned Siddhartha's acoutrements, weapons and hair to Suddhodarnha upon his return to the palace, after Siddhartha compelled him to return after Channa had refused to leave him. Upon Siddhartha's enlightenment as Gautama Buddha and return to Kapilavastu, Channa became a Buddhist monk, joining the Sangha. Due to his lone accompaniment of the Buddha on his renouncement, Channa behaved in an overbearing way to the other monks, and frequently criticized the two chief disciples Sariputta and Moggallana. In spite of continual advice from The Buddha he continued to abuse the other monks. Prior to the parinibbana, the Buddha instructed Ananda to impose the brahmadanda on Channa, whereby the other monks would simply ignore him. After the parinibbana, Channa learned of the decree, and feeling remorse for his behaviour, he fainted three times before asking and obtaining pardon. He eventually became an arahant.

Bundy was born to a Quaker family in Guilford County, North Carolina, and moved by covered wagon to a farm near Monrovia, Indiana, with his family at the age of five. He studied briefly in Indianapolis with Barton S. Hays but was primarily self-taught. Bundy did travel to New York to copy paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for a time. He joined the art department of Earlham College in 1887 and took up painting full-time in 1895 from a studio behind his home on West Main Street in Richmond, Indiana. He was a founding member of the Society of Western Artists and was a central influence in the founding of the Richmond Art Museum in 1898. He was known for his portrayal of Indiana landscapes and particularly for his paintings of American beech trees, though he did make brief trips to paint in California and northern Michigan. Bundy's work continues to be sought after, and his is found in numerous private collections and museums, including the Haan Mansion Museum of Indiana Art, the Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Indiana State Museum and the Richmond Art Museum.

It was founded in 1995 by socialist historian Keith Flett who continues to organise and represent the organisation. Apart from its numerous campaigns in support of beards and against pogonophobia in the workplace and discrimination against those who wear beards as part of their religion, it currently hosts the annual Beard of the Year award. On the face of it, the campaign is semi-humorous, with its outwardly frivolous aims, its occasionally outlandish claims of discrimination and conspiracy, and its founder, who is also the spokesman for the Campaign for Real Conkers. However, the organisation has drawn attention to more serious issues, having spoken out against, among other incidents, the suspension of a fireman for refusing to shave off his goatee and the banning of beards among ExxonMobil oil workers (in both cases employers claimed that beards interfered with breathing apparatus). Flett believes that an issue of \\"real discrimination\\" exists against men with beards. Although he admits that a beard, unlike race and gender, is a matter of choice, he has claimed that beardism is associated with more serious forms of discrimination: The size of the organisation is unknown; Flett refers to the organisation as \\"an informal network\\" and has claimed \\"a few hundred supporters\\" in the past. He is the organisation's sole spokesman in the media. Campaigns Robin Cook, first modern Foreign Secretary to sport a beard On the occasion of its founding, Keith Flett claimed that \\"Beards are politically progressive. All the great revolutionary socialists had a beard. Stalin had a moustache.\\" The BLF soon took up the cause of beards in British politics. In 1996 the BLF called for a bearded man to be appointed to the Cabinet. According to Independent diarist Eagle Eye, sources from the Labour Party, then in opposition, promised that if they were elected, the cabinet would include the first bearded minister since Baron Passfield in 1929. Upon Labour's victory in the general election a year later, the bearded Robin Cook was duly appointed Foreign Secretary. Since then, however, the BLF has regarded New Labour as obsessed with a clean-shaven image, with some notable exceptions (including David Blunkett and Charles Clarke). In 1998 the BLF expressed outrage at actor Sean Connery being denied a knighthood, claiming that \\"normally reliable New Labour sources\\" had told them that the reason was his beard. Connery himself claims that his knighthood was delayed because of his support for Scottish independence,Official website of Sean Connery, accessed on 2006-12-30. while others have pointed out his tax exile status and previous remarks that some complained condoned violence against women. Connery was eventually knighted in 2000. In 2000 the BLF joined the anti-capitalist May Day protests with a \\"mass beard waggle\\", decrying the waste of natural resources involved in producing shaving foam and brushes. It also claimed that Robert Burns had a beard, and that contemporary pictures of him which depict the Scottish poet as clean-shaven were a manufactured image designed to make him more popular to the English. The Burns Federation said that there was no evidence to support Flett's claims, and said that he was \\"talking through his beard\\". In 2002 the BLF called for a semi-boycott of the second Harry Potter film Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, citing the continued presence of obviously fake beards worn by actors Robbie Coltrane and Richard Harris. Flett claimed that the Christmas season was the worst time of year for beardist taunts, with the Potter movies adding to the ammunition already given by Father Christmas. Acknowledging that the pressure from beardies' children would be too great to consider an outright boycott, he said that supporters were merely being encouraged to hiss and boo at the screen. In 2006 the BLF joined the ranks of organisations issuing health advice during the record-breaking heat wave by advising beard-wearers to trim their beards, cover them with handkerchiefs and to keep them cool by placing them \\"briefly in the freezer department of a fridge or dipping [them] in a pint of real ale\\". The BLF boycotted the 2007 World Beard and Moustache Championships as they claimed the event was over obsessive about the cutting and styling of whiskers rather than the pure cultivation of beards. They were also angered by the Handlebar Club who were hosting the event because of their full club membership ban of those who possess a beard of any description. Handlebar moustache wearer and satirist Michael \\"Atters\\" Attree who was Honorable Chairman and Master of Ceremonies of the 2007 championships (and sits upon the committee of the Handlebar Club) hit back at the BLF claiming that their attitude towards his London-based club's handling of the WBMC was \\"Nonsense and utter Poppycock.\\" He stated \\"One's personal grooming is of the utmost importance if one is to be a gentleman. Often it's the beard clubs that have been the WBMC hosts. We are just showing the beardies how to do it properly\\". Commenting on the Socialist aspirations of the BLF Attree stated \\"I'd rather be shot by a moustachioed fascist than bored to death by the BLF\\". In 2007 during the Labour leadership campaign, the Beard Liberation Front held group discussions and decided to endorse Charles Clarke for the position, although he eventually announced he was not standing and would be backing Gordon Brown. Organiser Keith Flett was reported as saying: In June 2010 Keith Flett announced that the BLF had set the 2010 Beards and Sandals season to run from 6 June to 31 August. Beard of the Year Jeremy Corbyn, 2001's Beard of the Year In 2000, Frank Dobson was named \\"Beard 2000\\", amid controversy over his claim that Labour spin doctors had told him to shave off his prize-winning beard for the upcoming elections for Mayor of London. Dobson said that he had told them to \\"Stick it up their wickit\\". Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn, who considered his beard \\"a form of dissent\\" against New Labour, defeated Rolf Harris to win 2001's award. 2002's winner was Education Secretary Charles Clarke, who beat comedian Ricky Gervais and Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams for the title, although Flett suggested that his beard was probably a \\"pragmatic\\" one to conceal multiple double chins. The 2004 Beard of the Year was held jointly by cricketer Andrew Flintoff and NATFHE union leader Paul Mackney, due to the close polling between them. After the English cricket team regained the Ashes for the first time in sixteen years, Andrew Flintoff won the award again in 2005, this time unshared, to go with his BBC Sports Personality of the Year award and his MBE. The Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson came second, while former joint-winner Paul Mackney was pushed into third. England's loss of the Ashes the following year did not prevent the 2006 award going to a cricketer for the third year running; this time to England spin-bowler Monty Panesar, who narrowly won with 30 percent of the vote. Cuban President Fidel Castro was second with 29 percent; Paul Mackney was again third, tying with Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams with 10 percent each. Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds and Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan shared the award for Beard of the cricket World Cup 2007, with Panesar the runner-up. In 2007 the Beard of the Year was awarded to Robert Plant, the lead singer from Led Zeppelin. Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury made a comeback to win 2008's Beard of the Year from Prince William. In 2009 Rage Against the Machine vocalist Zach de la Rocha added Beard of the Year to the band's Christmas Number One. He defeated the Slovene philosopher Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek. 2010's Beard of the Year was Sinn F√©in President Gerry Adams. The winner in 2011 was writer and restaurant critic Jay Rayner.From Yahoo News: http://uk.news.yahoo.com/photos/beard-of-the- year-2011-1325086940-slideshow/ 2012 saw the award presented to journalist and radio broadcaster Robin Lustig.http://kmflett.wordpress.com/2012/12/28/bbc- veteran-lustig-beats-cricketer-panesar-for-beard-of-year-2012/ BBC veteran Lustig beats cricketer Panesar for Beard of Year 2012 Michael Eavis, who organises the Glastonbury Festival was awarded Beard of the Noughties, beating former Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Keith Flett said \\"Both Eavis and Castro have taken a back seat towards the end of the decade but their beards remain iconic. Michael Eavis is a true hirsute icon of the Noughties and he beat Castro to the accolade by the merest whisker.\\" In 2013 Gareth Malone won the Beard of the Year. He beat John Hurt, Geoff Parling, and Jeremy Paxman, who made it to the shortlist, but fell outside the top 3, despite having one of the most discussed beards of 2013. 2013 also saw the first St. David's Day Beard of Wales award, which went to Adam Jones. Leigh Halfpenny won in 2014, and Joe Ledley won in 2016. 2015 was won jointly by brewer Toby Copestake and musician Chris Fox. The latter also came second in 2016 and won outright in 2017. Units outside Britain In March 2012, Keith Flett corresponded with Zorko Sirotiƒá, Croatian visual artist, and appointed him head of the BLF's Central and Eastern Europe unit. Flett announced this via his Twitter page on 9 March.

After the end of World War I, the Rhineland came under Allied occupation. Under the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, the German military was forbidden from all territory west of the Rhine and within 50 km east of it. The 1925 Locarno Treaties reaffirmed the permanent demilitarised status of the Rhineland. In 1929, German Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann negotiated the withdrawal of Allied forces. The last soldiers left the Rhineland in June 1930. Following the Nazis', taking power in 1933, Germany began working towards rearmament and the remilitarisation of the Rhineland. On 7 March 1936, using the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance as a pretext, Chancellor and F√ºhrer Adolf Hitler ordered the Wehrmacht to march 3,000 German troops into the Rhineland, to joyous celebrations across Germany. The French and the British governments, unwilling to risk war, decided against enforcing the treaties. The remilitarisation changed the balance of power in Europe from France and its allies towards Germany by allowing Germany to pursue a policy of aggression in Western Europe that had been blocked by the demilitarised status of the Rhineland. The fact that Britain and France did not intervene made Hitler believe that neither would get in the way of Nazi foreign policy. That made him decide to quicken the pace of German preparations for war and the domination of Europe. On 14 March 1936, during a speech in Munich, Hitler stated, ‚ÄúNeither threats nor warnings will prevent me from going my way. I follow the path assigned to me by Providence with the instinctive sureness of a sleepwalker\\". Background =Versailles and Locarno= Border between France and Germany after WW I (1919-1926). Under Articles 42, 43 and 44 of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, which was imposed on Germany by the Allies after World War I, Germany was \\"forbidden to maintain or construct any fortification either on the Left bank of the Rhine or on the Right bank to the west of a line drawn fifty kilometers to the East of the Rhine\\". If a violation \\"in any manner whatsoever\\" of the article took place, it \\"shall be regarded as committing a hostile act... and as calculated to disturb the peace of the world\\".Martin Gilbert and Richard Gott, The Appeasers (Phoenix Press, 2000), p. 41. The Locarno Treaties, signed in October 1925 by Germany, France, Italy and Britain, stated that the Rhineland should continue its demilitarised status permanently.Kallis, pp. 112‚Äì113. Locarno was regarded as important by being a voluntary German acceptance of the Rhineland's demilitarised status as opposed to the Diktat of Versailles.Emmerson, pp. 22‚Äì23Shore, p. 7.Duroselle, pp. 116‚Äì117 Under Locarno's terms, Britain and Italy guaranteed the Franco- German border and the continued demilitarized status of the Rhineland against a \\"flagrant violation\\" without being more specific.Emmerson, pp. 23 & 97. A German attack on France would oblige Britain and Italy to go to France's aid under Locarno and likewise, a French on attack Germany obliged Britain and Italy to come Germany's aid. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg called the demilitarised status of the Rhineland the \\"single most important guarantee of peace in Europe\\" by preventing Germany from attacking its western neighbours and, as the demilitarised zone rendered Germany defenseless in the West, making it impossible to attack its eastern neighbours by leaving Germany open to a devastating French offensive if the Reich tried to invade any state guaranteed by the French alliance system in Eastern Europe, the cordon sanitaire.Weinberg (1970), p. 239. The Versailles Treaty also stipulated that Allied military forces would withdraw from the Rhineland by 1935. However, German Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann announced in 1929 that Germany would not ratify the 1928 Young Plan of continuing to pay reparations unless the Allies agreed to leave the Rhineland in 1930. The British delegation at the Hague Conference on German war reparations in 1929 proposed for reparations paid by Germany to be reduced and British and French forces to evacuate the Rhineland. The last British soldiers left in late 1929, and the last French soldiers left in June 1930. As long as the French continued to occupy the Rhineland, it functioned as a form of \\"collateral\\" under which the French could respond to any German attempt at overt rearmament by annexing the Rhineland. Once the last French soldiers left the Rhineland in June 1930, it could no longer play its \\"collateral\\" role, which opened the door for German rearmament. The French decision to build the Maginot Line in 1929 was a tacit French admission that it was only a matter of time before German rearmament on a massive scale would begin sometime in the 1930s and that the Rhineland was going to be remilitarised sooner or later.Emmerson, p. 25.Young (1996), pp. 19‚Äì21. Intelligence from the Deuxi√®me Bureau indicated that Germany had been violating Versailles throughout the 1920s, with the considerable help of the Soviet Union. With the French troops out of the Rhineland, Germany could be expected only to become more open about violating Versailles.Young (1996), p. 21. The Maginot Line, in turn, lessened the importance of the Rhineland's demilitarised status from the view of French security. =Foreign policy= The foreign policy of Fascist Italy was to maintain an \\"equidistant\\" stance from all the major powers to exercise the \\"determinant weight\\" by which the power Italy with which chose to align would decisively change the balance of power in Europe. The price of such an alignment would be support for Italian ambitions in Europe and/or Africa.Kallis, pp. 129 & 141. The foreign policy goal of the Soviet Union was set forth by Joseph Stalin in a speech on 19 January 1925 that if another world war broke out between the capitalist states: \\"We will enter the fray at the end, throwing our critical weight onto the scale, a weight that should prove to be decisive\\".Uebersch√§r, Gerd & M√ºller, Rolf-Dieter Hitler's War in the East, 1941‚Äì1945: A Critical Assessment, Oxford: Berghahn Books, 2002 page 14 To promote that goal, which would lead to the global triumph of communism, the Soviet Union tended to support German efforts to challenge the Versailles system by assisting the secret rearmament if Germany, a policy that caused much tension with France. An additional problem in Franco-Soviet relations was the Russian debt issue. Before 1917, the French had been by far the largest investors in Imperial Russia and the largest buyers of Russian debt and so the decision by Vladimir Lenin in 1918 to repudiate all debts and to confiscate all private property, owned by Russians or by foreigners, had hurt the world of French business and finance quite badly. The question of the Russian debt repudiation and compensation for French businesses affected by Soviet nationalisation policies poisoned Franco-Soviet relations until the early 1930s. The centrepiece of interwar French diplomacy had been the cordon sanitaire in Eastern Europe, which was intended to keep both the Soviet Union and Germany out of Eastern Europe. To that end, France had signed treaties of alliance with Poland in 1921, Czechoslovakia in 1924, Romania in 1926 and Yugoslavia in 1927.Young, (1996), pp. 17‚Äì18. The cordon sanitaire states were intended as a collective replacement for Imperial Russia as France's chief eastern ally. They emerged as areas of French political, military, economic and cultural influence.Duroselle, pp. 172‚Äì182. Regarding Germany, had always been assumed by the states of the cordon sanitaire that if Germany should attack any of them, France would respond by beginning an offensive into western Germany. Long before 1933, German military and diplomatic elites had regarded the Rhineland's demilitarised status as only temporary and planned to remilitarise the Rhineland at the first favourable diplomatic opportunity.Kallis, pp. 78‚Äì79 & 82‚Äì83. In December 1918, a meeting of Germany's leading generals (the German Army functioned as a \\"state within the state\\"), decided that the chief aim would be to rebuild German military power to launch a new war to win the \\"world power status\\" that the Reich had sought but failed to win in the last war.M√ºller, Klaus J√ºrgen The Army, Politics and Society in Germany, 1933‚Äì1945, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1987page 48. Throughout the 1920s and the early 1930s, the Reichswehr had been developing plans for a war to destroy France and its ally, Poland, which presumed the remilitarisation of the Rhineland.Kallis, p. 79. Steps were taken by the German government to prepare for the remilitarisation, such as keeping former barracks in a good state of repair, hiding military materials in secret depots and building customs and fire watchtowers that could be easily converted to observation and machine gun posts along the frontier.Emmerson, p. 28. From 1919 to 1932, British defense spending was based upon the Ten Year Rule, which assumed that no major war would occur for the next ten years, a policy that led to the British military being cut to the bone.Bond, pp. 197‚Äì198. In Britain, the idea of the \\"continental commitment\\" of sending a large army to fight on the European continent against Germany was never explicitly rejected, but it was not favoured.Bond, p. 198. The memory of the heavy losses taken in the First World War had led many to see the \\"continental commitment\\" of 1914 to be a serious mistake. For most of the interwar period, the British were extremely reluctant to make security commitments in Eastern Europe and regarded the region as too unstable and likely to embroil Britain in unwanted wars. At most, Britain was willing to make only limited security commitments in Western Europe, and even then, it tried to avoid the \\"continental commitment\\" as much as possible. In 1925, the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Austen Chamberlain, had famously stated in public at the Locarno conference that the Polish Corridor was \\"not worth the bones of a single British grenadier\\". Arthur Harris used the same phrase in 1945 and the historian Frederick Taylor on p. 432 in Dresden: Tuesday, February 13, 1945 mentionsled that it was a deliberate echo of a famous sentence used by Otto von Bismarck: \\"The whole of the Balkans is not worth the bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier\\". As such, Chamberlain declared that Britain would not guarantee the German-Polish border on the grounds that the Polish Corridor should be returned to Germany. That the British did not take even their Locarno commitments seriously could be seen in Whitehall's prohibition of the British military chiefs from holding staff talks with German, French and Italian militaries about what to do if a \\"flagrant violation\\" of Locarno occurred.Emmerson, p. 24. In general, for most of the 1920s and 1930s, British foreign policy was based upon appeasement under which the international system established by Versailles would be revised in Germany's favour within limits to win German acceptance of that international order, thereby ensuring peace. One of the main British aims at Locarno was to create a situation in which Germany could pursue territorial revisionism in Eastern Europe peacefully.Schuker (1999), pp. 48‚Äì49. The British viewed that if Franco-German relations improved, France would gradually abandon the cordon sanitaire. Once France had abandoned its allies in Eastern Europe as the price of better relations with Germany, the Poles and Czechoslovaks would be forced to adjust to German demands and peacefully hand over the territories claimed by Germany, such as the Sudetenland, the Polish Corridor and the Free City of Danzig (now Gda≈Ñsk, Poland). The British tended to exaggerate French power with the normally-Francophile Sir Robert \\"Van\\" Vansittart, the Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office, writing in 1931 that Britain was faced with an \\"unbearable\\" French domination of Europe, and a revival of German power was needed to counterbalance French power.Bennett, Edward German Rearmament and the West, 1932‚Äì1933, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2015 page 109 France's economic and demographic weaknesses in the face of Germany's strengths such a much-larger population and economy, together with the fact that much of France had been devastated by World War I while Germany had escaped mostly undamaged, were little appreciated in Whitehall. European situation (1933‚Äì1936) =Diplomacy= In March 1933, German Defence Minister, General Werner von Blomberg had plans drawn up for remilitarization.Kallis, p. 82. Blomberg, in the fall of 1933, began to have a number of the para-military Landspolizei units in the Rhineland with secret military training and equipped with military weapons to prepare for remilitarization.Emmerson, pp. 28‚Äì29. General Ludwig Beck's memo of March 1935 on the need for Germany to secure Lebensraum (living space) in Eastern Europe had accepted that remilitarization should take place once it was diplomatically possible. In general, it was believed by German military, diplomatic and political elites that it would not be possible to remiltarize before 1937.Kallis, p. 83. The change of regime in Germany in 1933 caused alarm in London, but there was considerable uncertainty about Hitler's long- term intentions. The uncertainty over what Hitler's ultimate intentions in foreign policy were coloured much of British policy towards Germany until 1939. The British could never quite decide if Hitler was merely revising Versailles or the unacceptable goal of seeking to dominate Europe. British policy towards Germany was a dual-track policy of seeking a \\"general settlement\\" with the Reich in which the \\"legitimate\\" German complaints about the Versailles Treaty would be addressed, but the British would rearm to negotiate with Germany from a position of strength, to deter Hitler from choosing war as an option, and ensure that Britain was prepared in the worst case of Hitler really wanting to conquer Europe. In February 1934, a secret report by the Defence Requirements Committee identified Germany as the \\"ultimate potential enemy\\" against which British rearmament was to be directed. Although the possibility of German bombing attacks against British cities increased the importance of having a friendly power on the other side of the English Channel, many British decision-makers were cool, if not downright hostile, towards the idea of the \\"continental commitment\\".Bond, pp. 198‚Äì199. When British rearmament began in 1934, the army received the lowest priority in terms of funding after the air force and the navy, in part to rule out the \\"continental commitment\\" as an option.Bond, p. 199. Increasingly, the British came to favor the idea of \\"limited liability\\", under which if the \\"continental commitment\\" were to be made, Britain should only send the smallest-possible expeditionary force to Europe and to reserve its main efforts towards the war in the air and on the sea.Bond, pp. 200‚Äì201. Britain's refusal to make the \\"continental commitment\\" on the same scale as World War I caused tensions with the French, who believed that it would be impossible to defeat Germany without another large-scale \\"continental commitment\\" and deeply disliked the idea that they should do the bulk of the fighting on their land. In 1934, French Foreign Minister Louis Barthou decided to end to any potential German aggression by building a network of alliances intended to encircle Germany, and he made overtures to the Soviet Union and Italy. Until 1933, the Soviet Union had supported German efforts to challenge the Versailles system, but the strident anticcommunism of the German regime and its claim for Lebensraum led the Soviets change positions on the question of maintaining the Versailles system. In September 1933, the Soviet Union ended its secret support for German rearmament, which had started in 1921. Under the guise of collective security, Soviet Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov started to praise the Versailles system, which the Soviet leaders had denounced as a capitalist plot to \\"enslave\\" Germany. In the 1920s, Benito Mussolini had started to subsidise the right-wing Heimwehr (\\"Home Defense\\") movement in Austria, and after Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss had seized dictatorial power in March 1933, Austria had fallen within the Italian sphere of influence.Sullivan, Barry \\"More than meets the eye: the Ethiopian War and the Origins of the Second World War\\" pages 178‚Äì203 from The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered A.J.P. Taylor and the Historians, London: Routledge, 1999 page 179 The terrorist campaign mounted by Austrian Nazis, with the open support of Germany, against the ultraconservative Dollfuss regime had the aim of overthrowing him to achieve the Anschluss, which caused considerable tensions between Rome and Berlin. Mussolini had warned Hitler several times that Austria was within the Italian, not German, sphere of influence and that the Germans had to cease trying to overthrow his prot√©g√©, Dollfuss. On 25 July 1934, the July Putsch in Vienna had seen Dollfuss assassinated by the Austrian SS and an announcement by the Austrian Nazis that the Anschluss was at hand. The Austrian Nazis attempted to seize power all over Austria, and the SS Austrian Legion, based in Bavaria, began to attack frontier posts along the German-Austrian border in what looked like the beginning of an invasion. In response, Mussolini had mobilised the Italian Army, concentrated several divisions at the Brenner Pass and warned Hitler that Italy would go to war with Germany if he tried to follow up the putsch by invading Austria. The Austrian-born Hitler, although deeply offended by Mussolini's blunt assertions that his birthplace was within the sphere of influence of any power other than Germany, realised he was in no position to do anything except to beat a humiliating retreat. To his disgust, he had to disallow the Putsch that he had ordered and could not follow it up by invading Austria, whose government crushed the Putsch by the Austrian Nazis. After Barthou was assassinated on 9 October 1934, his work in trying to build anti-German alliances with the Soviet Union and Italy was continued by Pierre Laval. On 7 January 1935, during a summit in Rome, Laval essentially told Mussolini that he had a \\"\\"free hand\\"\\" in the Horn of Africa and that France would not oppose an Italian invasion of Abyssinia. On 14 April 1935, British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, french Prime Minister Pierre Laval and Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini met in Stresa to form the Stresa Front to oppose any further German violations of Versailles after Germany stated in March 1935 that it would no longer abide by Parts V or VI of the Treaty of Versailles. In the spring of 1935, joint staff talks had begun between France and Italy with the aim of forming an anti-German military alliance. On 2 May 1935, Laval travelled to Moscow, where he a signed a treaty of alliance with Soviet Union.Emmerson, p. 33. At once, the German government began a violent press campaign against the Franco-Soviet pact and claimed it was a violation of Locarno and an immense danger for the Reich. In his \\"peace speech\\" of May 21, 1935, Adolf Hitler stated, \\"In particular, they [the Germans] will uphold and fulfill all obligations arising out of the Locarno Treaty, so long as the other parties are on their side ready to stand by that pact\\".Heinemann, p. 112. That line in Hitler's speech was written by Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath, who wished to reassure foreign leaders who felt threatened by Germany's denunciation in March 1935 of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, which had disarmed Germany. At the same time, Neurath wanted to provide an opening for the eventual remilitarisation of the Rhineland and so hedged the promise to obey Locarno only as long as other powers did the same. Hitler had always taken the line that Germany did not consider itself bound by the Diktat of Versailles but would respect any treaty that it willingly signed such as Locarno under which Germany had promised to keep the Rhineland demilitarized forever. Thus, Hitler always promised during his \\"peace speeches\\" to obey Locarno as opposed to Versailles.Weinberg (2013), p. 188. =Abyssinia Crisis= On 7 June 1935, MacDonald resigned as prime minister due to ailing health and was replaced by Stanley Baldwin. The leadership change did not affect British foreign policy in any meaningful way. On October 3, 1935, Italy invaded Abyssinia, and thus began the Abyssinia Crisis. Under strong pressure from British public opinion, which was very much for collective security, the British government took the lead in pressing the League of Nations for sanctions against Italy.Weinberg (2013), p. 171. The decision of Baldwin to take a strong line for collective security was mostly motivated by domestic politics. Having just won an election on 14 November 1935 with a platform including the upholding collective security, the Baldwin government pressed very strongly for sanctions against Italy for invading Abyssinia. The League Assembly voted for a British motion to impose sanctions on Italy with immediate effect on 18 November 1935. The British line that collective security must be upheld caused considerable tensions between Paris and London, with the French taking the viewpoint that Hitler, not Mussolini, was the real danger to the peace and that if the price of continuing Stresa Front was accepting the conquest of Abyssinia, it was worth paying. The British historian Correlli Barnett wrote for Laval, \\"all that really mattered was Nazi Germany. His eyes were on the demilitarised zone of the Rhineland; his thoughts on the Locarno guarantees. To estrange Italy, one of the Locarno powers, over such a question as Abyssinia did not appeal to Laval's Auvergnat peasant mind\\".Correlli Barnett, The Collapse of British Power, London: Methuen, 1972, page 353. With Paris and London openly at loggerheads over the correct response to Italian invasion, to say nothing of the very public rift between Rome and London, an opening was seen in Germany for remilitarisation of the Rhineland. The dispute placed the French in an uncomfortable position. On one hand, Britain's repeated refusal to make the \\"continental commitment\\" increased the value to the French of Italy as the only other nation in Western Europe capable of fielding a large army against Germany.Shore, p. 8. On the other hand, the British economy was far larger than the Italian economy, which thus meant from the long-term French perspective, Britain was a much better ally as Britain had vastly-more economic staying power than Italy for what was assumed would be another guerre de la longue dur√©e (\\"long-term war\\") against Germany. The American historian Zach Shore wrote, \\"rench leaders found themselves in the awkward position of seeking the military co-operation of two incompatible allies. Since Italy and Britain had clashing interests in the Mediterranean, France could not ally with one without alienating the other\\". To avoid a total rupture with Britain, France did not use its veto power as a member of the League Council but voted for the sanctions. However, Laval used the threat of a French veto to water down the sanctions and to have such items such as oil and coal, which might have crippled Italy, removed from the sanctions list.Duroselle, p. 109. Nonetheless, Mussolini felt betrayed by his friends in France; it was the country with which he was most angry with for the sanctions after Britain. Despite Mussolini's outrage about the sanctions, however, they were largely ineffective. The United States and Germany-l, both of which were not members of the League, chose not to abide by the sanctions and so American and German businesses supplied Italy with all of the goods that the League had placed on the sanctions list, making them more of an annoyance than a problem for the Italians.Duroselle, p. 114. Italian cryptographers had broken the British naval and diplomatic codes in the early 1930s and so Mussolini knew very well that although Britain might threaten war through such moves as reinforcing the Mediterranean Fleet in September 1935, the British had already decided that they would never go to war for Abyssinia.Smith, p. 261. Armed with that knowledge, Mussolini felt free to engage in all sorts of wild threats of war against Britain from late 1935 onwards and to declare at one point that he rather see the entire world \\"go up in a blaze\\" than to stop his invasion.Smith, p. 262. Mussolini's frequent threats to destroy the British Empire if the British continued to oppose his war had created the impression in late 1935 to early 1936 that Britain and Italy were on the verge of war. In late 1935, Neurath started rumours that Germany was considering remilitarising the Rhineland in response to the Franco-Soviet pact of May 1935, which Neurath insisted was a violation of Locarno that threatened Germany. At the same time, Neurath ordered German diplomats to start drawing up legal briefs justifying remilitarisation of the Rhineland under the grounds that the pact violated Locarno. In doing so, Neurath was acting without orders from Hitler but in the expectation that time was ripe for remilitarisation because of the crisis in Anglo-Italian relations. To resolve the Abyssinia Crisis, Robert Vansittart, the Permanent Undersecretary at the British Foreign Office, proposed to the Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare what came to be known as the Hoare‚ÄìLaval Pact under which half of Abyssinia would be given to Italy, with the rest nominally independent under Emperor Haile Selassie. Vansittart who was a passionate Francophile and an equally-ardent Germanophobe, and he wanted to sacrifice Abyssinia for the sake of maintaining the Stresa Front against Germany, which he saw as the real danger.Doerr, Paul British Foreign Policy, 1919‚Äì1939, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1998 page 137Neville, Peter Hitler and Appeasement: The British Attempt to Prevent the Second World War, London: A&C; Black, 2006 page 138 Vansittart had a powerful ally in Hankey, a proponent of realpolitik, who saw the entire idea of imposing sanctions on Italy as much folly.Pratt, Larry East of Malta, West of Suez: Britain's Mediterranean Crisis, 1936‚Äì1939, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975, pages 26‚Äì27 Persuaded of the merits of Vansittart's approach, Hoare travelled to Paris to meet with Laval, who agreed to the plan. However, Alexis St. Leger, the General Secretary at the Quai d'Orsay, unlike most other French officials, who were pro-Italian, was one of the few to have a visceral dislike of Fascist Italy. He, therefore, decided to sabotage the plan by leaking it to the French press.Duroselle, p. 111. St. Leger was by all accounts a \\"rather strange\\" character and sometimes chose to undercut policy initiatives of which he disapproved.Cairns, John \\"Reflections on France, Britain and the Winter War Problem, 1939‚Äì1940\\" pages 269‚Äì285, from The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments edited by Joel Blatt, Berghahn Books: Providence, Rhode Island, 1998 page 285 In a strange asymmetry, Vansittart was for the French approach that it was worth allowing the Italian conquest in order to continue the Stresa Front, and St. Leger was for the British approach of upholding collective security, even at the risk of damaging the Stresa Front. When the news of the plan of essentially rewarding Mussolini reached Britain, such an uproar was caused that Hoare had to resign in disgrace; he was replaced by Anthony Eden, and the newly-elected Baldwin government was almost toppled by a backbenchers' revolt. Baldwin lied to the House of Commons by claiming that the cabinet was unaware of the plan and that Hoare was a rogue minister acting on his own. In France, public opinion was just as outraged by the plan as in Britain. Laval's policy of internal devaluation of forcing deflation on the French economy to increase French exports to combat the Great Depression had already made him unpopular, but the Hoare-Laval plan further damaged his reputation. The Chamber of Deputies debated the plan on 27 and 28 December, and the Popular Front condemned it, with L√©on Blum telling Laval: \\"You have tried to give and to keep. You wanted to have your cake and eat it. You cancelled your words by your deeds and your deeds by your words. You have debased everything by fixing, intrigue and slickness.... Not sensitive enough to the importance of great moral issues, you have reduced everything to the level of your petty methods\\".Geoffrey Warner, Pierre Laval and the Eclipse of France (New York: Macmillan, 1969), p. 126. Mussolini rejected the Hoare-Laval plan by saying he wanted to subject all of Abyssinia, not just half of it. Following the fiasco of the Hoare-Laval plan, the British government resumed its previous policy of imposing sanctions against Italy in a half-hearted way, which imposed serious strains on relations with Paris and especially Rome. Given the provocative Italian attitude, Britain wanted to begin staff talks with France for a possible war with Italy.Emmerson, p. 35. On 13 December 1935, Neurath told the British ambassador, Sir Eric Phipps, that Berlin regarded any Anglo-French staff talks without Germany, even if directed only against Italy, as a violation of Locarno that would force Germany to remilitarise the Rhineland. Though Italo-German relations had been quite unfriendly in 1935, Germany was an outspoken supporter of the Italian invasion and offered Mussolini a benevolent neutrality.Emmerson, p. 37 Under the banner of white supremacy and fascism, Hitler came out strongly for the Italian invasion and made a point of shipping the Italians various raw materials and weapons, despite the League's sanctions.Kallis, p. 144-145. Hitler's support for the conquest won him much goodwill in Rome. By contrast, Laval's pro- Italian intrigues and his efforts to sabotage the British-led effort to impose sanctions on Italy created a lasting climate of distrust between the British and the French.Pratt, Larry East of Malta, West of Suez: Britain's Mediterranean Crisis, 1936‚Äì1939, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975 page 26 German remilitarisation =Neurath and secret intelligence= The British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden anticipated that by 1940 Germany might be persuaded to return to the League of Nations, accept arms limitations, and renounce her territorial claims in Europe in exchange for remilitarisation of the Rhineland, return of the former German African colonies and German \\"economic priority along the Danube\\"Crozier, Andrew Appeasement and Germany's Last Bid for Colonies Macmillan Press: London, United Kingdom, 1988 p. 33. The Foreign Office's Ralph Wigram advised that Germany should be permitted to remilitarise the Rhineland in exchange for an \\"air pact\\" outlawing bombing and a German promise not to use force to change their borders. However, 'Wigram did not succeed in convincing his colleagues or cabinet ministers'.Emmerson, pp. 62‚Äì3. Eden's goal has been defined as that of a \\"general settlement\\", which sought \\"a return to the normality of the twenties and the creation of conditions in which Hitler could behave like Stresemann.\\" (Gustav Stresemann German chancellor, foreign minister and democrat during the Weimar Republic)Crozier, Andrew Appeasement and Germany's Last Bid for Colonies, Press: London, United Kingdom, 1988 p. 32. On 16 January 1936, the French Premier Pierre Laval submitted the Franco-Soviet Pact to the Chamber of Deputies for ratification.Weinberg (1970), p. 247. In January 1936, during his visit to London to attend the funeral of King George V, Neurath told Eden: \\"If, however, the other signatories or guarantors of the Locarno Pact should conclude bilateral agreements contrary to the spirit of Locarno Pact, we should be compelled to reconsider our attitude.\\"Heinemann, p. 113. Eden's response to Neurath's veiled threat that Germany would remilitarise the Rhineland if the French National Assembly ratified the Franco-Soviet pact convinced Neurath that if Germany remilitarised, then Britain would take Germany's side against France. There was a clause in the Locarno treaty calling for binding international arbitration if the one of the signatory powers signed a treaty that the other powers considered to be incompatible with Locarno.Weinberg (1970), p. 241. Both Neurath and his State Secretary Prince Bernhard von B√ºlow professed to every foreign diplomat with whom they spoke that the Franco-Soviet Pact was a violation of Locarno, but at the same time both strongly advised Hitler not to seek international arbitration in order to determine whether the Franco-Soviet pact really was a violation of Locarno. Seeking international arbitration was a \\"lose-lose\\" situation for Germany: on the one hand, if it were ruled that the Franco-Soviet pact was incompatible with Locarno, then the French would have to abandon the pact, thereby depriving Germany of an excuse to remilitarise; on the other hand, if it were ruled that Franco-Soviet pact was compatible with Locarno, Germany would likewise have no excuse for remilitarisation. Although Neurath indicated several times in press conferences in early 1936 that Germany was planning on using the arbitration clause in Locarno in order to help convince public opinion abroad that the Franco-Soviet pact was a violation of Locarno, the German government never invoked the arbitration clause. At the same time, Neurath received an intelligence report on 10 January 1936 from Gottfried Aschmann, the Chief of the Ausw√§rtiges Amt's Press Division, who during a visit to Paris in early January 1936 had talked to a minor French politician named Jean Montiny who was a close friend of Premier Laval, who had frankly mentioned that France's economic problems had retarded French military modernization and that France would do nothing if Germany remilitarized the Rhineland.Shore, pp. 5‚Äì6. Neurath did not pass on Aschmann's report to Hitler, but he placed a high value upon it.Shore, p. 6. Neurath was seeking to improve his position within the Nazi regime; by repeatedly assuring Hitler during the Rhineland crisis that the French would do nothing without telling Hitler the source of his self-assurance, Neurath came across as a diplomat blessed with an uncanny intuition, something that improved his standing with Hitler.Shore, p. 12‚Äì13. Traditionally in Germany the conduct of foreign policy had been the work of the Ausw√§rtiges Amt (Foreign Office), but starting in 1933 Neurath had been faced with the threat of Nazi \\"interlopers in diplomacy\\" as various NSDAP agencies started to conduct their own foreign policies independent of and often against the Ausw√§rtiges Amt.Shore, p. 13‚Äì14. The most serious of the \\"interlopers in diplomacy\\" was the Dienststelle Ribbentrop, a sort of alternative foreign ministry loosely linked to the NSDAP headed by Joachim von Ribbentrop which aggressively sought to undercut the work of the Ausw√§rtiges Amt at every turn.Shore, pp. 14‚Äì15. Further exacerbating the rivalry between the Dienststelle Ribbentrop and the Ausw√§rtiges Amt was the fact that Neurath and Ribbentrop utterly hated one another, with Ribbentrop making no secret of his belief that he would be a much better foreign minister than Neurath, whereas Neurath viewed Ribbentrop as a hopelessly inept amateur diplomat meddling in matters that did not concern him.Shore, pp. 14‚Äì16. Baron Konstantin von Neurath in 1939. As Foreign Minister in 1936, Neurath played a decisive role in German decision-making that led to the remilitarization. =The decision to remilitarize= During January 1936, the German Chancellor and F√ºhrer Adolf Hitler decided to remilitarize the Rhineland. Originally Hitler had planned to remilitarize the Rhineland in 1937, but chose in early 1936 to move re-militarization forward by a year for several reasons, namely: the ratification by the French National Assembly of the Franco-Soviet pact of 1935 allowed him to present his coup both at home and abroad as a defensive move against Franco-Soviet \\"encirclement\\"; the expectation that France would be better armed in 1937; the government in Paris had just fallen and a caretaker government was in charge; economic problems at home required a foreign policy success to restore the regime's popularity; the Italo-Ethiopian War, which had set Britain against Italy, had effectively broken up the Stresa Front; and apparently because Hitler simply did not feel like waiting an extra year.Emmerson, pp. 72‚Äì74.Weinberg (1970), p. 246. In his biography of Hitler, the British historian Sir Ian Kershaw argued that the primary reasons for the decision to remilitarize in 1936 as opposed to 1937 were Hitler's preference for dramatic unilateral coups to obtain what could easily be achieved via quiet talks, and Hitler's need for a foreign policy triumph to distract public attention from the major economic crisis that was gripping Germany in 1935‚Äì36.Kershaw (1998), pp. 582‚Äì586. The German War Minister General Werner von Blomberg. During a meeting between Prince Bernhard von B√ºlow, the State Secretary at the Ausw√§rtiges Amt (who is not to be confused with his more famous uncle Chancellor Bernhard von B√ºlow) and the French Ambassador Andr√© Fran√ßois-Poncet on 13 January 1936, where B√ºlow handed Fran√ßois-Poncet yet another note protesting against the Franco-Soviet pact, Fran√ßois-Poncet accused B√ºlow to his face of seeking any excuse, no matter how bizarre, strange or implausible to send troops back into the Rhineland.Emmerson, p. 39 On 15 January 1936, a top-secret NKVD report was sent to Joseph Stalin entitled \\"Summary of Military and Political Intelligence on Germany\\", which reported ‚Äì based on statements from various diplomats in the Ausw√§rtiges Amt ‚Äì that Germany was planning on remilitarizing the Rhineland in the near- future.Shore, p. 10. The same summary quoted B√ºlow as saying that if Britain and France made any sort of agreement concerning military co-operation that did not involve Germany: \\"We would view this as a violation of Locarno, and if we are not dragged into participating in negotiations, we will not consider ourselves bound by Locarno obligations concerning the preservation of the Rhine demilitarized zone\\".Shore, p. 11. The Soviet report warning of German plans for remilitarization was not passed on to either the British or French governments. On 17 January 1936 Benito Mussolini ‚Äì who was angry about the League of Nations sanctions applied against his country for aggression against Ethiopia ‚Äì told the German Ambassador in Rome, Ulrich von Hassell, that he wanted to see an Austro-German agreement \\"which would in practice bring Austria into Germany's wake, so that she could pursue no other foreign policy than one parallel with Germany. If Austria, as a formally independent state, were thus in practice to become a German satellite, he would have no objection\\".Strang, G. Bruce \\"War and Peace: Mussonlini's Road to Munich\\" pages 160‚Äì190 from The Munich Crisis, 1938 edited by Igor Lukes & Erik Goldstein, Frank Cass: London, 1999 page 173.Cassels, Alan \\"Mussolini and the Myth of Rome\\" pages 57‚Äì74 from The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered A.J.P. Taylor and the Historians, London: Routledge, 1999 page 63. By recognizing that Austria was within the German sphere of influence, Mussolini had removed the principal problem in Italo-German relations. Italo-German relations had been quite bad since mid-1933, and especially since the July Putsch of 1934, so Mussolini's remarks to Hassell in early 1936 indicating that he wanted a rapprochement with Germany were considered extremely significant in Berlin. In another meeting, Mussolini told Hassell that he regarded the Stresa Front of 1935 as \\"dead\\", and that Italy would do nothing to uphold Locarno should Germany violate it. Initially German officials did not believe in Mussolini's desire for a rapprochement, but after Hitler sent Hans Frank on a secret visit to Rome carrying a message from the F√ºhrer about Germany's support for Italy's actions in the conquest of Ethiopia, Italo-German relations improved markedly. On 24 January, the very unpopular Laval resigned as premier rather than be defeated on a motion of no-confidence in the National Assembly as the Radical Socialists decided to join the left-wing Popular Front, thereby ensuring an anti-Laval majority in the Chamber of Deputies.Duroselle, pp. 112‚Äì113. A caretaker government was formed in Paris led by Albert Sarraut until new elections could be held. The Sarraut cabinet was a mixture of men of the right like Georges Mandel, the center like Georges Bonnet and the left like Joseph Paul-Boncour which made it almost impossible for the cabinet to make decisions.Duroselle, p. 113. Immediately, the Sarraut government came into conflict with Britain as Eden started to press the League for oil sanctions against Italy, something that the French were completely opposed to, and threatened to veto.Duroselle, p. 115. On 11 February 1936, the new French Premier Albert Sarraut affirmed that his government would work for the ratification of the Franco-Soviet pact. On February 12, 1936, Hitler met with Neurath and his Ambassador-at-Large Joachim von Ribbentrop to ask their opinion of the likely foreign reaction to remilitarization. Neurath supported remiltarization, but argued that Germany should negotiate more before doing so whereas Ribbentrop argued for unilateral remilitarization at once.Heinemann, p. 114. Ribbentrop told Hitler that if France went to war in response to German remiltarization, then Britain would go to war with France, an assessment of the situation with which Neurath did not agree, but one that encouraged Hitler to proceed with remiltarization. On the 12th of February Hitler informed his War Minister, Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg, of his intentions and asked the head of the Army, General Werner von Fritsch, how long it would take to transport a few infantry battalions and an artillery battery into the Rhineland. Fritsch answered that it would take three days organization but he was in favour of negotiation, as he believed that the German Army was in no state for armed combat with the French Army.Rupert Matthews, Hitler: Military Commander (Arcturus, 2003), p. 115. The Chief of the General Staff, General Ludwig Beck warned Hitler that the German Army would be unable to successfully defend Germany against a possible retaliatory French attack.Rupert Matthews, Hitler: Military Commander (Arcturus, 2003), p. 113. Hitler reassured Fritsch that he would withdraw his forces if there were a French countermove. Weinberg wrote that: > \\"German military plans provided for small German units to move into the > Rhineland, joining the local militarized police (Landespolizei) and staging > a fighting withdrawal if there were a military counter-action from the West. > The story that the Germans had orders to withdraw if France moved against > them is partially correct, but essentially misleading; the withdrawal was to > be a tactical defensive move, not a return to the earlier position. The > possibility of a war was thus accepted by Hitler, but he clearly did not > think the contingency very likely.\\"Weinberg (1970), p. 252. The operation was codenamed Winter Exercise. Unknown to Hitler, on 14 February Eden had written to the Quai d'Orsay stating that Britain and France should \\"enter betimes into negotiations...for the surrender on conditions of our rights in the zone while such surrender still has got a bargaining value\\".Emmerson, p. 66. Eden wrote to the British cabinet that the end of the demilitarized zone would \\"not merely change local military values, but is likely to lead to far-reaching political repercussions of a kind which will further weaken France's influence in Central and Eastern Europe\\".Kagan, p. 212. In February 1936, the Deuxi√®me Bureau started to submit reports suggesting that Germany was planning on sending troops into the Rhineland in the very near-future.Duroselle, pp. 122‚Äì123. Because Fran√ßois-Poncet's reports from Berlin indicated that the German economic situation was quite precarious, it was felt in Paris that sanctions against Germany could be quite devastating, and might even lead to the collapse of the Nazi regime.Duroselle, p. 123. Along with Ribbentrop and Neurath, Hitler discussed the planned remilitarization in detail with War Minister General Werner von Blomberg, Chief of General Staff General Ludwig Beck, Hermann G√∂ring, Army Commander-in- Chief General Werner von Fritsch and Ulrich von Hassell.Kershaw (1998), p. 584. Ribbentrop and Blomberg were in favor; Beck and Fritsch were opposed and Neurath and Hassell were supportive, but argued that there was no real need to act now as quiet diplomacy would soon ensure remilitarization.Kershaw (1998), pp. 584‚Äì585. That Hitler was in close and regular contact with Hassell, the ambassador to Italy all through February and early March, showed how much importance Hitler attached to Italy. Of the three leaders of the Stresa front, Mussolini was easily the one Hitler most respected, and so Hitler viewed Italy as the key, taking the view that if Mussolini decided to oppose the remilitarization, then Britain and France would follow. Not withstanding Mussolini's remarks in January, Hitler was still not convinced of Italian support, and ordered Hassell to find out Mussolini's attitude.Weinberg (1970), p. 247-248. On 22 February, Hassell wrote in his diary that the pending ratification of the Franco-Soviet pact was just a pretext, writing: \\"it was quite clear that he [Hitler] really wanted the ratification to use as a platform for his action\\".Weinberg (1970), p. 250. That same day, Hassell held a meeting with Mussolini, where Il Duce stated if oil sanctions were applied against Italy, he would \\"make Locarno disappear of its own accord\\", and that anyhow Italy would not act if German troops were to enter the Rhineland.Weinberg (1970), p. 249. At the same time, Neurath started preparing elaborate documents justifying remilitarization as a response forced on Germany by the Franco-Soviet pact, and advised Hitler to keep the number of troops sent into the Rhineland very small so to allow the Germans to claim that they had not committed a \\"flagrant violation\\" of Locarno (both Britain and Italy were only committed to offering a military response to a \\"flagrant violation\\").Heinemann, p. 114‚Äì115. In the statement justifying remilitarization that Neurath prepared for the foreign press, the German move was portrayed as something forced on a reluctant Germany by ratification of the Franco-Soviet pact, and strongly hinted that Germany would return to the League of Nations if remilitarization was accepted. After meeting with Hitler on 18 February, Baron von Neurath expressed the viewpoint \\"for Hitler in the first instance domestic motives were decisive\\".Kershaw (1998), p. 581. At the same time that Frank was visiting Rome, G√∂ring had been dispatched to Warsaw to meet the Polish Foreign Minister Colonel J√≥zef Beck and to ask the Poles to remain neutral if France decided on war in response to the remilitarization of the Rhineland.Weinberg (2013), p. 194. Colonel Beck believed that the French would do nothing if Germany remilitarized the Rhineland, and thus could assure those in the Polish government who wished for Poland to stay close to its traditional ally France that Poland would act if France did while at the same time telling G√∂ring that he wanted closer German-Polish relations and would do nothing in the event of remilitarization. On 13 February 1936 during a meeting with Prince Bismarck of the German Embassy in London, Ralph Wigram, the head of the Central Department of the British Foreign Office stated that the British government (whose Prime Minister from 1935 to 1937 was Stanley Baldwin) wanted a \\"working agreement\\" on an air pact that would outlaw bombing, and that Britain would consider revising Versailles and Locarno in Germany's favor for an air pact. Prince Bismarck reported to Berlin that Wigram had hinted quite strongly that the \\"things\\" that Britain were willing to consider revising included remilitarization. On 22 February 1936 Mussolini, who was still angry about the League of Nations sanctions applied against his country for aggression against Ethiopia, told von Hassell that Italy would not honour Locarno if Germany were to remilitarize the Rhineland.Neville, Peter Mussolini, London: Routledge, 2004 p. 135. Even if Mussolini had wanted to honour Locarno, practical problems would have arisen as the bulk of the Italian Army was at that time engaged in the conquest of Ethiopia, and as there is no common Italo-German frontier. Historians debate the relation between Hitler's decision to remilitarize the Rhineland in 1936 and his broad long-term goals. Those historians who favour an \\"intentionist\\" interpretation of German foreign policy such as Klaus Hildebrand and the late Andreas Hillgruber see the Rhineland remilitarization as only one \\"stage\\" of Hitler's stufenplan (stage by stage plan) for world conquest. Those historians who take a \\"functionist\\" interpretation see the Rhineland remilitarization more as ad hoc, improvised response on the part of Hitler to the economic crisis of 1936 as a cheap and easy way of restoring the regime's popularity. The British Marxist historian Timothy Mason famously argued that Hitler's foreign policy was driven by domestic needs related to a failing economy, and that it was economic problems at home as opposed to Hitler's \\"will\\" or \\"intentions\\" that drove Nazi foreign policy from 1936 onwards, which ultimately degenerated into a ‚Äúbarbaric variant of social imperialism\\", which led to a \\"flight into war\\" in 1939.Kallis, p. 165.Kershaw (2000), pp. 7, 88 & 165‚Äì166. As Hildebrand himself has noted, these interpretations are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Hildebrand has argued that although Hitler did have a \\"programme\\" for world domination, the way in which Hitler attempted to execute his \\"programme\\" was highly improvised and much subject to structural factors both on the international stage and domestically that were often not under Hitler's control.Kershaw (2000), p. 143. On February 26 the French National Assembly ratified the Franco-Soviet pact. On February 27, Hitler had lunch with Hermann G√∂ring and Joseph Goebbels to discuss the planned remilitarization, with Goebbels writing in his diary afterwards: \\"Still somewhat too early\\".Kershaw (1998), p. 585. On February 29 an interview Hitler had on February 21 with the French fascist and journalist Bertrand de Jouvenel was published in the newspaper Paris-Midi.Duroselle, p. 122. During his interview with a clearly admiring de Jouvenel, Hitler professed himself a man of peace who desperately wanted friendship with France and blamed all of the problems in Franco-German relations on the French who for some strange reason were trying to \\"encircle\\" Germany via the Franco-Soviet pact, despite the evident fact that the Fuhrer was not seeking to threaten France. Hitler's interview with de Jouvenel was intended to influence French public opinion into believing that it was their government that was responsible for the remilitarization. Only on March 1 did Hitler finally make up his mind to proceed.Kershaw (1998), p. 586. A further factor in Hitler's decision was that the sanctions committee of the League was due to start discussing possible oil sanctions against Italy on 2 March, something that was likely to lead the diplomats of Europe to be focused on the Abyssinia Crisis at the expense of everything else.Weinberg (2013), p. 196. =The Wehrmacht marches= Not long after dawn on March 7, 1936, nineteen German infantry battalions and a handful of planes entered the Rhineland. By doing so, Germany violated Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles and Articles 1 and 2 of the Treaty of Locarno.Parker (1956), p. 355. They reached the river Rhine by 11:00 a.m. and then three battalions crossed to the west bank of the Rhine. At the same time, Baron von Neurath summoned the Italian ambassador Baron Bernardo Attolico, the British ambassador Sir Eric Phipps and the French ambassador Andr√© Fran√ßois-Poncet to the Wilhelmstrasse to hand them notes accusing France of violating Locarno by ratifying the Franco-Soviet pact, and announcing that as such Germany had decided to renounce Locarno and remilitarize the Rhineland.Shirer, p. 291. When German reconnaissance learned that thousands of French soldiers were congregating on the Franco-German border, General Blomberg begged Hitler to evacuate the German forces. Under Blomberg's influence, Hitler nearly ordered the German troops to withdraw, but was then persuaded by the resolutely calm Neurath to continue with Operation Winter Exercise.Kallis, p. 113. Following Neurath's advice, Hitler inquired whether the French forces had actually crossed the border and when informed that they had not, he assured Blomberg that Germany would wait until this happened.Rupert Matthews, Hitler: Military Commander (Arcturus, 2003), page 116. In marked contrast to Blomberg who was highly nervous during Operation Winter Exercise, Neurath stayed calm and very much urged Hitler to stay the course.Heinemann, p. 115. The Rhineland coup is often seen as the moment when Hitler could have been stopped with very little effort; the German forces involved in the move were small, compared to the much larger, and at the time more powerful, French military. The American journalist William L. Shirer wrote if the French had marched into the Rhineland, A German officer assigned to the Bendlerstrasse during the crisis told H. R. Knickerbocker during the Spanish Civil War: \\"I can tell you that for five days and five nights not one of us closed an eye. We knew that if the French marched, we were done. We had no fortifications, and no army to match the French. If the French had even mobilized, we should have been compelled to retire.\\" The general staff, the officer said, considered Hitler's action suicidal. General Heinz Guderian, a German general interviewed by French officers after the Second World War, claimed: \\"If you French had intervened in the Rhineland in 1936 we should have been sunk and Hitler would have fallen.\\"J. R. Tournoux, Petain et de Gaulle (Paris: Plon, 1964), p. 159. That Hitler faced serious opposition gains apparent weight from the fact that Ludwig Beck and Werner von Fritsch did indeed become opponents of Hitler but according to the American historian Ernest R. May there is not a scrap of evidence for this at this stage.May, Ernest R.: Strange Victory, New York: Hill & Wang, 2000 page 37. May wrote that the German Army officer corps was all for remilitarizing the Rhineland, and only the question of timing of such a move divided them from Hitler.May, Ernest R.: Strange Victory, New York: Hill & Wang, 2000 pages 35‚Äì36. May further noted that there is no evidence that the German Army was planning on overthrowing Hitler if he had been forced to order a withdraw from the Rhineland, and the fact that Mussolini utterly humiliated Hitler during the July Putsch in 1934 by forcing Germany to climb-down on Austria without leading to the slightest effort on the part of the Reichswehr to overthrow Hitler must cast further doubt on the thesis that Hitler would have been toppled if only he been forced to withdraw from the Rhineland. Writing about relations between Hitler and his generals in early 1936, the American historian J.T. Emerson declared: \\"In fact, at no time during the twelve-year existence of the Third Reich did Hitler enjoy more amicable relations with his generals than in 1935 and 1936. During these years, there was nothing like an organized military resistance to party politics\\".Emmerson, p. 36 Later on in World War II, despite the increasing desperate situation of Germany from 1942 onwards and a whole series of humiliating defeats, the overwhelming majority of the Wehrmacht stayed loyal to the Nazi regime and continued to fight hard for that regime right up to its destruction in 1945 (the only exception being the putsch of July 20, 1944, in which only a minority of the Wehrmacht rebelled while the majority remained loyal).Bartov, Omer \\"Soldiers, Nazis and War in the Third Reich\\" pages 133‚Äì150 from The Third Reich The Essential Readings edited by Christian Leitz, London: Blackwell, 1999 pages 137‚Äì139 & 144‚Äì146 The willingness of the Wehrmacht to continue to fight and die hard for the National Socialist regime despite the fact Germany was clearly losing the war from 1943 onwards reflected the deep commitment of most of the Wehrmacht to National Socialism.Bartov, Omer \\"Soldiers, Nazis and War in the Third Reich\\" pages 133‚Äì150 from The Third Reich The Essential Readings edited by Christian Leitz, London: Blackwell, 1999 pages 138‚Äì139. Furthermore, the senior officers of the Wehrmacht were deeply corrupt men, who received huge bribes from Hitler in exchange for their loyalty.Goda, Norman \\"Black Marks: Hitler's Bribery of his Senior Officers During World War II\\" from pages 96‚Äì137 from Corrupt Histories, Toronto: Hushion House edited by Emmanuel Kreike, & William Chester Jordan, 2005 page 102 In 1933, Hitler had created a slush fund known as Konto 5 run by Hans Lammers, which provided bribes to senior officers and civil servants in exchange for their loyalty to the National Socialist regime. Given the intense devotion of the Wehrmacht to the National Socialist regime and its corrupt senior officers who never got quite enough in the way of bribes from Hitler, it is very unlikely that the Wehrmacht would have turned on their Fuhrer if the Wehrmacht were forced out of the Rhineland in 1936. Reactions =Germany= Goebbels, Hitler, and von Blomberg On 7 March 1936 Hitler announced before the Reichstag that the Rhineland had been remilitarized, and to blunt the danger of war, Hitler offered to return to the League of Nations, to sign an air pact to outlaw bombing as a way of war, and a non-aggression pact with France if the other powers agreed to accept the remilitarization. In his address to the Reichstag, Hitler began with a lengthy denunciation of the Treaty of Versailles as unfair to Germany, claimed that he was a man of peace who wanted war with no-one, and argued that he was only seeking equality for Germany by peacefully overturning the unfair Treaty of Versailles.Kershaw (1998), p. 587. Hitler claimed that it was unfair that because of Versailles a part of Germany should be demilitarized whereas in every other nation of the world a government could order its troops to anywhere within its borders, and claimed all he wanted was \\"equality\\" for Germany. Even then, Hitler claimed that he would have been willing to accept the continued demilitarization of the Rhineland as Stresemann had promised at Locarno in 1925 as the price for peace, had it not been for the Franco-Soviet Pact of 1935, which he maintained was threatening to Germany and had left him with no other choice than to remilitarize the Rhineland. With his eye on public opinion abroad, Hitler made a point of stressing that the remilitarization was not intended to threaten anyone else, but was instead only a defensive measure imposed on Germany by what he claimed were the menacing actions of France and the Soviet Union. At least some people abroad accepted Hitler's claim that he been forced to take this step because of the Franco-Soviet pact. Former British Prime Minister David Lloyd George stated in the House of Commons that Hitler's actions in the wake of the Franco-Soviet pact were fully justified, and he would have been a traitor to Germany if he had not protected his country.House of Commons, July 27, 1936: https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=1936-07-27a.1207.1 When German troops marched into Cologne, a vast cheering crowd formed spontaneously to greet the soldiers, throwing flowers onto the Wehrmacht while Catholic priests offered to bless the soldiers.Kershaw (1998), p. 588. Cardinal Karl Joseph Schulte of Cologne held a Mass at Cologne Cathedral to celebrate and thank Hitler for \\"sending back our army\\". In Germany, the news that the Rhineland had been remilitarized was greeted with wild celebrations all over the country; the British historian Sir Ian Kershaw wrote of March 1936 that: \\"People were besides themselves with delight ‚Ä¶ It was almost impossible not to be caught up in the infectious mood of joy\\".Kershaw (1998), p. 590. Not until the victory over France in June 1940 was the Nazi regime to be as popular as it was in March 1936. Reports to the Sopade in the spring of 1936 mentioned that a great many erstwhile Social Democrats and opponents of the Nazis amongst the working class had nothing but approval of the remilitarization, and that many who had once been opposed to the Nazis under the Weimar Republic were now beginning to support them. To capitalize on the vast popularity of the remilitarization, Hitler called a referendum on 29 March 1936 in which the majority of German voters expressed their approval of the remilitarization. During his campaign stops to ask for a yes vote, Hitler was greeted with huge crowds roaring their approval of his defiance of Versailles. Kershaw wrote that the 99% ja (yes) vote in the referendum was improbably high, but it is clear that an overwhelming majority of voters did genuinely chose to vote yes when asked if they approved of the remilitarization.Kershaw (1998), p. 590‚Äì591. The American journalist William L. Shirer wrote about the 1936 election: > \\"Nevertheless, this observer, who covered the \\"election\\" from one corner of > the Reich to the other, has no doubt that the vote of approval for Hitler's > coup was overwhelming. And why not? The junking of Versailles and the > appearance of German soldiers marching again into what was, after all, > German territory were things that almost all Germans naturally approved of. > The No vote was given as 540, 211.\\"Shirer, p. 294. In the aftermath of the remilitarization, the economic crisis which had so damaged the National Socialist regime's popularity was forgotten by almost all.Kershaw (1998), p. 591. After the Rhineland triumph, Hitler's self- confidence surged to new heights, and those who knew him well stated that after March 1936 there was a real psychological change as Hitler was utterly convinced of his infallibility in a way that he not been before. =France= General Maurice Gamelin, the French Supreme Commander, 1936 Historians writing without benefit of access to the French archives (which were not opened until the mid-1970s) such as William L. Shirer in his books The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich (1960) and The Collapse of the Third Republic (1969) have claimed that France, although possessing at this time superior armed forces compared to Germany, including after a possible mobilization 100 infantry divisions, was psychologically unprepared to use force against Germany.Shirer, p. 291‚Äì293. Shirer quoted the figure of France having 100 divisions compared to Germany's 19 battalions in the Rhineland.Shirer, p. 293. France's actions during the Rhineland crisis have often used as support of the d√©cadence thesis that during the interwar period the supposed decadence of the French way of life caused the French people to degenerate physically and morally to the point that the French were simply unable to stand up to Hitler, and the French in some way had it coming when they were defeated in 1940.Young, (1996), p. 146. Shirer wrote that the French could have easily turned back the German battalions in the Rhineland had the French people not been \\"sinking into defeatism\\" in 1936. Historians such as the American historian Stephen A. Schuker who have examined the relevant French primary sources have rejected Shirer's claims, finding that a major paralyzing factor on French policy was the economic situation.Schuker (1997), pp. 223 & 236‚Äì37. France's top military official, General Maurice Gamelin, informed the French government that the only way to remove the Germans from the Rhineland was to mobilize the French Army, which would not only be unpopular but also cost the French treasury 30 million francs per day.Schuker, (1997), p. 235. Gamelin assumed a worst-case scenario in which a French move into the Rhineland would spark an all-out Franco-German war, a case that required full mobilization. Gamelin's analysis was supported by the War Minister, General Louis Maurin who told the Cabinet that it was inconceivable that France could reverse the German remilitarization without full mobilization.Young (1978), p. 121. This was especially the case as the Deuxi√®me Bureau had seriously exaggerated the number of German troops in the Rhineland when it sent in a report to the French cabinet estimating that there were 295,000 German troops in the Rhineland. The Deuxi√®me Bureau had come up with this estimate by counting all of the SS, SA and Landespolizei formations in the Rhineland as regular troops and so the French believed thary only a full mobilization would allow France to have enough troops to expel the alleged 295,000 German troops from the Rhineland. The real number was actually 3,000 German soldiers. The French historian Jean-Baptiste Duroselle accused Gamelin of distorting what the Deuxi√®me Bureau's intelligence in his report to the cabinet by converting the SS, SA and Landespolizei units into fully-trained troops to provide a reason for inaction.Duroselle, p. 125-126. Neurath's truthful statement that Germany had sent only 19 battalions into the Rhineland was dismissed by Gamelin as a ruse to allow the Germans to claim that they had not committed a \\"flagrant violation\\" of Locarno to avoid having it invoked against Germany, and he also claimed that Hitler would never risk a war by sending such a small force into the Rhineland. Albert Sarraut, the French prime minister at the time of the crisis At the same time, in late 1935 to early 1936 France was gripped by a financial crisis, with the French Treasury informing the government that sufficient cash reserves to maintain the value of the franc as currently pegged by the gold standard in regard to the US dollar and the British pound no longer existed, and only a huge foreign loan on the money markets of London and New York could prevent the value of the franc from experiencing a disastrous downfall.Schuker, (1997), p. 237. Because France was on the verge of elections scheduled for the spring of 1936, devaluation of the franc, which was viewed as abhorrent by large sections of French public opinion, was rejected by the caretaker government of Prime Minister Albert Sarraut as politically unacceptable. Investors' fears of a war with Germany were not conducive to raising the necessary loans to stabilize the franc, and the German remilitarization of the Rhineland, by sparking fears of war, worsened the French economic crisis by causing a massive cash flow out of France, with worried investors shifting their savings towards what were felt to be safer foreign markets.Schuker, (1997) pp. 237‚Äì238. The fact that France had defaulted on its World War I debts in 1932 understandably led most investors to conclude that the same would occur if France was involved in another war with Germany,. On March 18, 1936, Wilfrid Baumgartner, the director of the Mouvement g√©n√©ral des fonds (the French equivalent of a permanent under- secretary) reported to the government that France, for all intents and purposes, was bankrupt.Schuker, (1997), p. 238. Only by desperate arm-twisting from the major French financial institutions could Baumgartner manage to obtain enough in the way of short-term loans to prevent France from defaulting on its debts and to keeping the value of the franc from sliding too far, in March 1936. Given the financial crisis, the French government feared that there were insufficient funds to cover the costs of mobilization and that a full-blown war scare caused by mobilization would only exacerbate the financial crisis. The American historian Zach Shore wrote, \\"It was not lack of French will to fight in 1936 which permitted Hitler's coup, but rather France's lack of funds, military might, and therefore operational plans to counter German remilitarization\\".Shore, pp. 7‚Äì8. An additional issue for the French was the state of the French Air Force.Emmerson, pp. 108‚Äì109. The Deuxi√®me Bureau reported that the Luftwaffe had developed considerably more advanced aircraft than what France had and that the superior productivity of German industry and the considerably-larger German economy gave the Luftwaffe had a three-to-one advantage in fighters. Problems with productivity in the French aircraft industry meant the French Air Force would have a great deal of trouble replacing its losses in the event of combat with the Luftwaffe. Thus, it was believed by the French military elite that if war came, the Luftwaffe would dominate the skies, attack French troops marching into the Rhineland and even bomb French cities. Yet another problem for the French were the attitudes of the states of the cordon sanitaire.Emmerson, p. 119. Since 1919, it had accepted that France needed the alliance system in Eastern Europe to provide additional manpower (Germany's population was one-and-half times that of France's) and to open up an eastern front against the Reich. Without the other states of the cordon sanitaire, it was believed impossible for France to defeat Germany. Only Czechoslovakia indicated firmly that it would go to war with Germany if France marched into the Rhineland. Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia all indicated that they would go to war only if German soldiers entered France. French public opinion and newspapers were very hostile towards the German coup, but few called for war.Emmerson, p. 116. Most French newspapers called for League of Nations sanctions to be imposed on the Reich to inflict economically-crippling costs force the German Army out of the Rhineland and for France to build new and to reinforce existing alliances to prevent further German challenges to the international status quo. One of the few newspapers to support Germany was the royalist Action Fran√ßaise, which ran a banner headline reading: \\"The Republic Has Assassinated the Peace!\\" and went on to say that the German move was justified by the Franco-Soviet Pact.Duroselle, p. 129. On the other ideological extreme, the communists issued a statement calling for national unity against \\"those who would lead us to carnage\\" who were the \\"Laval clique\\", which was allegedly pushing for a war with Germany, which would supposedly be good for capitalism.Duroselle, p. 128. Georges Mandel in 1932. The combative conservative Mandel was the only French minister to advocate war in response to the remilitarization. Upon hearing of the German move, the French government issued a statement strongly hinting that military action was a possible option. From 9:30 am to noon on 7 March, a meeting of the French cabinet took place to discuss what to do; it ended with the conclusion that the French Foreign Minister, Pierre √âtienne Flandin, should meet the ambassadors of the other Locarno powers to discuss their reaction.Parker (1956), p. 356. Georges Mandel was the sole voice in the French cabinet demanding France to march at once into the Rhineland to expel the German troops, regardless of the costs.Emmerson, p. 104 Later that day, another cabinet meeting was called with General-Secretary Alexis St. Leger, representing the Quai d'Orsay and Maurice Gamelin, who represented the military. Both decided to issue a statement that France reserved every option to oppose the remilitarization. Flandin, upon hearing of the remilitarization, immediately went to London to consult British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, as Flandin wished, for domestic political reasons, to find a way of shifting the onus of not taking action onto British shoulders.Schuker, (1997), pp. 238‚Äì239. Baldwin asked Flandin what the French government had in mind, but Flandin said that it had not yet decided. Flandin went back to Paris and asked the French government what its response should be. They agreed, \\"France would place all her forces at the disposal of the League of Nations to oppose a violation of the Treaties\\".A. J. P. Taylor, The Origins of the Second World War (Penguin, 1991), p. 130. On 8 March, Prime Minister Albert Sarraut went on French radio to state: \\"In the name of the French government, I declare that we intend to see maintained that essential guarantee of French and Belgian security, countersigned by the English and Italian governments, constituted by the Treaty of Locarno. We are not disposed to allow Strasbourg to come under fire from German guns\\".Parker (1956), p. 357. At the same time, the French cabinet had decided, \\"We will put all our forces, material and moral, at the disposal of the League of Nations... on the one condition that we shall be accompanied in the fight for peace by those who are clearly bound themselves to do so by the Rhineland pact\\".Parker (1956), p. 358. In other words, France would act against Germany only if Britain and Italy did likewise. Pierre- √âtienne Flandin, the French foreign minister at the time of the crisis Since the French government, for economic reasons, had already ruled out mobilization and war as a way of reversing Hitler's Rhineland coup, it was decided that the best that France could do under the situation was to use the crisis to obtain the \\"continental commitment\\", a British commitment to send large ground forces to the defense of France on the same scale of World War I.Schuker, (1997), p. 239. The strategy of Flandin strongly implied to the British that France was willing to go to war with Germany over the Rhineland issue, in the expectation that the British did not want to see their Locarno commitments lead them into a war with the Germans over an issue in which many British supported the Germans. As such, Flandin expected that London to apply pressure for \\"restraint\\" on Paris.Young (1978), p. 124. The price of the French \\"restraint\\" in regards to the Rhineland provocation, an open violation of both the Versailles and Locarno Treaties, would be the British \\"continental commitment\\" unequivocally linking British security to French security and committing the British to send another large expeditionary force to defend France against a German attack.Young, (1978), pp. 124‚Äì25. During his visit to London to consult with British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin and Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden, Flandin carried out what the Canadian historian Robert J. Young called \\"the performance of a lifetime\\" in which he expressed a great deal of outrage at the German move, stated quite openly that France was prepared to go to war over the issue and strongly criticised his British hosts for the demands for French \\"restraint\\". However, he failed to not offer to do anything for French s√©curit√© (security).Young (1978), p. 123. As expected by Flandin, Eden was opposed to the French taking military action and appealed for French \\"restraint\\". Not aware of what Flandin was attempting to do, French military officials urged the government to tell Flandin to tone down his language.Young (1978), pp. 123‚Äì124. In the face of Flandin's tactics, on March 19, 1936, the British government made a vague statement linking British security to French security, and for the first time since World War I, it agreed to Anglo-French staff talks albeit of very limited scope. Though disappointed with the British offers, which the French felt were too little, the French considered the pledges of British support gained in 1936 to be a worthwhile achievement, especially since economic reasons mobilization was not considered a realistic option in 1936. Those French officials such as Quai d'Orsay's directeur politique (political director), Ren√© Massigli, who believed in the idea of an Anglo-French alliance as the best way of stopping German expansionism expressed a great deal of disappointment that Britain was not prepared to do more for French s√©curit√©.Ulrich, Raph√§elle \\"Ren√© Massigli and Germany, 1919‚Äì1938\\" pp. 132‚Äì48 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 The Decline and Fall of A Great Power edited by Robert Boyce, London, United Kingdom: Routledge, 1998 p. 144. In a report to Flandin, Massigli warned that if French accepted remilitarization, the Poles, the Yugoslavs and the Romanians would drift into the German orbit, and the Czechoslovaks would do their best to stay loyal to the 1924 alliance with France, and it would only be a matter of time before Germany annexed Austria.Weinberg (1970), p. 254. In particular, Massigli warned that if the Germans could fortify the Rhineland, they would essentially be given a free hand to expand into Eastern Europe. As part of an effort to secure more in the way of the long-desired \\"continental commitment\\" that had been a major goal of French foreign policy since 1919, Gamelin told the British military attach√©: The generalissimo of the French Army, Maurice Gamelin, told the French government that if France countered the German forces, France would be unable to win fighting alone in a long war and so would need British assistance. The French government, with an upcoming general election in mind, decided against general mobilization of the French Army.Taylor, A.J.P. The Origins of the Second World War Penguin: London, 1991 page 131. Remilitarization removed the last hold France had over Germany and so ended the security that France had gained from the Treaty of Versailles. As long as the Rhineland was demilitarized, the French could easily reoccupy the area and threaten the economically-important Ruhr industrial area, which was liable to an invasion if France believed the German situation ever became a threat.Correlli Barnett, The Collapse of British Power (Pan, 2002), p. 336. =United Kingdom= The reaction in Britain was mixed, but they did not generally regard the remilitarization as harmful. Lord Lothian famously said it was no more than the Germans walking into their own backyard. George Bernard Shaw similarly claimed it was no different than if Britain had reoccupied Portsmouth. In his diary entry for 23 March, Harold Nicolson MP noted that \\"the feeling in the House [of Commons] is terribly pro-German, which means afraid of war\\".Harold Nicolson, The Harold Nicolson Diaries: 1919‚Äì1964 (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2004), p. 139. During the Rhineland crisis of 1936, no public meetings or rallies were held anywhere in protest at the remilitarization of the Rhineland, and instead there were several \\"peace\\" rallies where it was demanded that Britain not use war to resolve the crisis.Emmerson, p. 144. Ever since the economist John Maynard Keynes had published his best-selling book The Economic Consequences of the Peace in 1919‚Äîin which Keynes depicted Versailles as an unbearably harsh Carthaginian peace imposed by the vindictive Allies‚Äîan increasingly large segment of British public opinion had become convinced that the Treaty of Versailles was deeply \\"unjust\\" to Germany.Weinberg (1970), p. 259. By 1936, when German troops marched back into the Rhineland, the majority of British people believed that Hitler was right to violate the \\"unjust\\" Versailles treaty, and it would be morally wrong for Britain to go to war to uphold the \\"unjust\\" Treaty of Versailles. The British War Secretary Alfred Duff Cooper told the German Ambassador Leopold von Hoesch on 8 March: \\"through the British people were prepared to fight for France in the event of a German incursion into French territory, they would not resort to arms on account of the recent occupation of the Rhineland. The people did not know much about the demilitarization provisions and most of them probably took the view that they did not care 'two hoots' about the Germans reoccupying their own territory\\". Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, unknown date The Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin claimed, with tears in his eyes, that Britain lacked the resources to enforce her treaty guarantees and that public opinion would not stand for military force anyway.Taylor, A.J.P. The Origins of the Second World War, London: Penguin 1961, 1976 p. 132. The British Chiefs of Staff had warned that war with Germany was inadvisable under the grounds that the deep cuts imposed by the Ten Year Rule together with the fact that rearmament had only begun in 1934 meant that at most Britain could do in the event of war would be to send two divisions with backward equipment to France after three weeks of preparation.Kagan, p. 213. Additionally, fears were expressed in Whitehall if Britain went to war with Germany, then Japan, which since 1931 when Japanese had seized Manchuria from China had been making claims to be the only power in the Far East, might take advantage of the war to start seizing Britain's Asian colonies.Emmerson, p. 139. The British Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, discouraged military action by the French and was against any financial or economic sanctions against Germany, immediately meeting the French ambassador Charles Corbin to urge restraint on the French. Eden instead wanted Germany to pull out all but a symbolic number of troops, the number they said they were going to put in the first place, and then renegotiate. An additional factor that influenced British policy was the lack of the Dominion support. All of the Dominion High Commissioners in London, with South Africa and Canada being especially outspoken in this regard, made it quite clear that they would not go to war to restore the demilitarized status of the Rhineland, and that if Britain did so, she would be on her own. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that \\"...by 13 March that the British Dominions, especially the Union of South Africa and Canada, would not stand with England if war came. The South African government in particular was busy backing the German position in London and with the other Dominion governments\\".Weinberg (1970), p. 258. Both the South African Prime Minister General J. B. M. Hertzog and the Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King had to face domestic constituencies, respectively the Afrikaners and the French Canadians, many of whom had deep objections to fighting in another \\"British war\\" against Germany, and as such both Hertzog and Mackenzie King were staunch supporters of appeasement as the best way of avoiding such a war. Neither Hertzog nor Mackenzie King wished to have chose between loyalty to the British Empire vs. dealing with anti-British voters if war came. Ever since the Chanak Crisis of 1922, Britain had been keenly conscious that Dominion support could no longer be automatically assumed, and remembering the huge role the Dominions had played in the victory of 1918, could not consider fighting another major war without Dominion support. The British Foreign Office for its part expressed a great deal of frustration over Hitler's action in unilaterally taking what London had proposed to negotiate. As a Foreign Office memo complained: \\"Hitler has deprived us of the possibility of making to him a concession which might otherwise have been a useful bargaining counter in our hands in the general negotiations with Germany which we had it in contemplation to initiate\\".Medlicott, W.N. Britain and Germany Athlone Press: London, United Kingdom, 1969 page 24. The Rhineland crisis completed the estrangement between Eden who believed that Hitler's proposals in his speech of 7 March were the grounds for a \\"general settlement\\" with Germany, and Vansittart who argued that Hitler was negotiating in bad faith.Roi, pp. 128‚Äì129. Eden and Vansittart had already clashed during the Abyssinia Crisis with Eden supporting sanctions against Italy while Vansittart wanted Italy as an ally against Germany. Vansittart argued that there was no prospect of a \\"general settlement\\" with Hitler, and the best that could be done was to strengthen ties with the French in order to confront Germany.Roi, pp. 128‚Äì130. The Germanophobe Vansittart had always hated the Germans, and especially disliked the Nazis, whom he saw as a menace to civilization. Vansittart had supported Eden's efforts to defuse the Rhineland crisis as British rearmament had only just began, but being an intense Francophile Vansittart urged the government to use the crisis as a chance to begin forming a military alliance with France against Germany. By the spring of 1936, Vansittart had become convinced that a \\"general settlement\\" with Germany was not possible, and Hitler was seeking the conquest of the world. A Foreign Office official Owen O'Malley suggested that Britain give Germany a \\"free hand in the East\\" (i.e. accept the German conquest of all Eastern Europe) in exchange for a German promise to accept the status quo in Western Europe.Roi, p. 130. Vansittart wrote in response that Hitler was seeking world conquest, and that to allow Germany to conquer all of Eastern Europe would give the Reich sufficient raw materials to make Germany immune to a British blockade, which would then allow the Germans to overrun Western Europe. Vansittart commented that to allow Germany to conquer Eastern Europe would \\"lead to the disappearance of liberty and democracy in Europe\\". By contrast, Eden saw British interests as confined only to Western Europe, and did not share Vansittart's beliefs about what Hitler's ultimate intentions might be. Nor did Eden, the rest of the Cabinet or the majority of the British people share Vansittart's conviction that Britain could not afford to be indifferent about Eastern Europe. Though the British had agreed to staff talks with the French as the price of French \\"restraint\\", many British ministers were unhappy with these talks. The Home Secretary Sir John Simon wrote to Eden and Baldwin that staff talks to be held with the French after the Rhineland remilitarization would lead the French to perceive that: In response to objections like Simon's, the British ended the staff talks with the French five days after they had begun; Anglo-French staff talks were not to occur again until February 1939 in the aftermath of the Dutch War Scare of January 1939. Besides opposition within the cabinet, the Anglo-French staff talks generated furious criticism from David Lloyd George and the Beaverbrook and Rothermere press who fumed, as the Daily Mail put it in a leader, over \\"military arrangements that will commit us to some war at the call of others\\".Emmerson, p. 217. Furthermore, Hitler's Extraordinary Ambassador-at- Large Joachim von Ribbentrop had warned Baldwin and Eden that Germany regarded the Anglo-French staff talks as a mortal threat, and any hope of a \\"general settlement\\" with Germany would end forever if the talks continued.Emmerson, pp. 215‚Äì216. However, the rather hazily phrased British statement linking British security to French s√©curit√© was not disallowed out of the fear that it would irreparably damage Anglo-French relations, which as the British historian A. J. P. Taylor observed, meant should France become involved in a war with Germany, there would be at a minimum a strong moral case because of the statement of March 19, 1936 for Britain to fight on the side of France.Taylor, A.J.P. The Origins of the Second World War, London: Penguin 1961, 1976 p. 148. Until the statement by Neville Chamberlain on March 31, 1939 offering the \\"guarantee\\" of Poland, there were no British security commitments in Eastern Europe beyond the Covenant of the League of Nations. However, because of the French alliance system in Eastern Europe, the so- called Cordon sanitaire, any German attack on France's Eastern European allies would cause a Franco-German war, and because of the statement of March 19, 1936 a Franco-German war would create strong pressure for British intervention on the side of France. This was all the more the case because unlike the Locarno, where Britain was committed to come to France's defence only in the event of a German attack, the British statement of March 19 as part of an effort to be as vague as possible only stated Britain considered French security to be a vital national need, and did not distinguish between a German attack on France vs. France going to war with Germany in the event of a German attack on a member of the cordon sanitarie. Thus, in this way, the British statement of March 1936 offered not only a direct British commitment to defend France (albeit phrased in exceedingly ambiguous language), but also indirectly to the Eastern European states of the cordon sanitaire. In this way, the British government found itself drawn into the Central European crisis of 1938 because the Franco-Czechoslovak alliance of 1924 meant any German-Czechoslovak war would automatically become a Franco-German war. It was because of this indirect security commitment that the British involved themselves in the Central European crisis of 1938, despite the widespread feeling that the German-Czechoslovak dispute did not concern Britain directly.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road To War, London: Macmillan, 1989 p. 86. During a House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee meeting on 12 March, Winston Churchill, a backbench Conservative MP, argued for Anglo-French co-ordination under the League of Nations to help France challenge the remilitarization of the Rhineland,Martin Gilbert, Churchill: A Life (Pimlico, 2000), p. 552. but this never happened. On 6 April Churchill said of the remilitarization, \\"The creation of a line of forts opposite to the French frontier will enable the German troops to be economized on that line and will enable the main forces to swing round through Belgium and Holland\\", accurately predicting the Battle of France. =Belgium= Belgium concluded an alliance with France in 1920 but after the remilitarization Belgium opted again for neutrality. On 14 October 1936 King Leopold III of Belgium said in a speech: Since the leaders of Germany knew well that neither Britain nor France would violate Belgian neutrality, the declaration of Belgian neutrality effectively meant that there was no more danger of an Allied offensive in the West should Germany start another war as the Germans were now busy building the Siegfried Line along their border with France.Weinberg (1970), pp. 283‚Äì284. By contrast, just as before 1914, Germany's leaders were all too willing to violate Belgian neutrality. Belgian neutrality meant there could be no staff talks between the Belgian military and those of other nations, which meant that when German forces invaded Belgium in 1940, there were no plans whatsoever for coordinating the movement of Belgian forces with those of France and Britain, which gave the Germans a head-start in their offensive. =Poland= Poland, announced that the Franco-Polish Military Alliance signed in 1921 would be honoured, although the treaty stipulated that Poland would aid France only if France was invaded.Weinberg (1970), p. 255. At the same time that Colonel Beck was assuring the French ambassador L√©on No√´l of his commitment to the Franco- Polish alliance and Poland's willingness to stand with France, he was also telling the German ambassador Count Hans-Adolf von Moltke that since Germany was not planning on invading France, the Franco-Polish alliance would not come into effect and Poland would do nothing if France acted. Beck made a point of stressing to Moltke that Poland had not been allowed to sign Locarno and would not go to war for Locarno, and that as one of the architects of the German- Polish nonaggression pact of 1934 that he was a friend of the Reich.Emmerson, p. 158. Beck told Moltke on 9 March that his promise to go to war with France was \\"in practice, without effect\\" because it only came into effect if German troops entered France.Emmerson, p. 159. Weinberg wrote that Beck's \\"duplicity\\" during the Rhineland crisis of telling the German and French ambassadors different things about what Poland would do \\"‚Ä¶ did nothing for Beck's personal reputation and involved enormous risks ‚Ä¶\\" for Poland.Weinberg (1970), p. 256. Poland did agree to mobilize its forces if France did first, however they abstained from voting against the remilitarization in the Council of the League of Nations. =United States= During the Rhineland crisis, the isolationist American government took a strict \\"hands off\\" policy of doing nothing.Offner, p. 415. During the crisis, President Franklin D. Roosevelt went off on a \\"diplomatically convenient\\" extended fishing trip to Florida to avoid having to answer questions from journalists about what his administration planned to do in response to the crisis in Europe. The general sentiment within the U.S. government was expressed by Truman Smith, the American military attach√© in Berlin who wrote that Hitler was seeking only to end French domination in Europe, and was not seeking to destroy France as a power. Smith's report concluded: \\"Versailles is dead. There may possibly be a German catastrophe and a new Versailles, but it will not be the Versailles which has hung like a dark cloud over Europe since 1920\\". =The Soviet Union= In public, the Soviet government took a strong line in denouncing the German coup as a threat to peace.Jiri Hochman, The Soviet Union and the Failure of Collective Security 1934-1938 (1984) p. 104. At the same time the Soviet Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov was giving speeches before the General Assembly of the League of Nations praising collective security and urging the world to oppose Hitler's coup, Soviet diplomats in Berlin were telling their counterparts at the Ausw√§rtiges Amt of their desire for better commercial relations, which in turn might lead to better political relations.Hochman, p. 122. Just after the remilitarization, the Soviet Premier Vyacheslav Molotov gave an interview with the Swiss newspaper Le Temps hinting that the Soviet Union wanted better relations with Germany. In April 1936, the Soviet Union signed a commercial treaty with Germany providing for expanded German-Soviet trade. A major problem for the Soviet Union to go to war with Germany was the lack of a common German-Soviet frontier, which would require both the Polish and Romanian governments to grant transit right to the Red Army.Hochman, p. 57. Despite their professed willingness to engage with the Wehrmacht, the Narkomindel tended to negotiate with the Poles and the Romanians over transit rights in the event of a war in such a manner to suggest that they wanted the talks to fail, suggesting that the Soviet hard line against Germany was just posturing.Hochman, p. 76. The Romanians and even more so the Poles expressed a great deal of fear that if the Red Army were allowed transit rights to enter their countries on the way to fight Germany that they would fail to leave once the war was over; the Narkomindel failed to provide convincing reassurances on that point. =League of Nations= When the Council of the League of Nations met in London, the only delegate in favour of sanctions against Germany was Maxim Litvinov, the representative of the Soviet Union. Though Germany was no longer a member of the League, Ribbentrop was allowed to give a speech before the League Assembly on 19 March where he tried to justify Germany's actions as something imposed on the Reich by the Franco-Soviet pact, and warned that there would be serious economic consequences for those states who voted to impose sanctions on Germany.Emmerson, pp. 170‚Äì171. By 1936, a number of Eastern European, Scandinavian and Latin American countries whose economies were hard-pressed by the Great Depression had become very dependent upon trade with Germany to keep their economies afloat, which meant for economic reasons alone none of those states wished to offend Germany.Emmerson, pp. 171‚Äì172. President Federico P√°ez of Ecuador gave a speech in which he declared the idea of sanctions against the Reich to be \\"nonsensical\\".Emmerson, p. 166. At the time, the British Foreign Office estimated that Britain, France, Romania, Belgium, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union were the only nations in the entire world willing to impose sanctions on Germany.Emmerson, p. 171. The Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Polish, Dutch, Greek, Swiss, Turkish, Chilean, Estonian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Finnish ambassadors to the League all let it be known that they regarded sanctions on Germany as \\"economic suicide\\" for their countries.Emmerson, p. 172. Mussolini, who was still angry with the League sanctions applied against Italy, made a speech in which he made it clear that he definitely would not be joining any sanctions against Germany for remilitarizing the Rhineland.Kallis, p. 144. In the fall of 1935, Britain had been able to have the League impose limited sanctions on Italy, but by the later winter of 1936, the idea of imposing sweeping sanctions on Germany‚Äîwhose economy was four times the size of Italy's, making Germany an \\"economic octopus\\" whose tentacles were everywhere around the world‚Äîwas unthinkable for rest of the world.Emmerson, pp. 171‚Äì171. Moreover, for the sanctions to work, the United States had to join in. In 1935, the American government had declared that as the U.S. was not a League member, it would not abide by the League sanctions on Italy, which was hardly a hopeful precedent for the idea that U.S. would join in with imposing sanctions on Germany. Argentina declared that it would vote for sanctions against Germany only if the United States promised to join in. The Council declared, though not unanimously, that the remilitarization constituted a breach of the Treaties of Versailles and Locarno. Hitler was invited to plan a new scheme for European security, and he responded by claiming he had \\"no territorial claims in Europe\\" and wanted a 25-year pact of non-aggression with Britain and France. However, when the British Government inquired further into this proposed pact, they did not receive a reply.Taylor, p. 133. Significance The remilitarization changed the balance of power decisively in favor of the Reich.Weinberg (1970), p. 262. French credibility in standing against German expansion or aggression was left in doubt. French military strategy was entirely defensive, and it had no intention whatsoever of invading Germany. Instead it planned to defend the Maginot Line. Its failure to send even a single unit into Rhineland signaled that strategy to all of Europe. Potential allies in Eastern Europe could no longer trust in an alliance with a France that could not be trusted to deter Germany through threat of an invasion. without such deterrence, the ally was militarily helpless. Belgium dropped its defensive alliance with France and relied on neutrality. Paris neglected to expand the Maginot line to cover the Belgian border, which is where Germany invaded in 1940. Mussolini had previously pushed back against German expansion, now he realized cooperation with France was unpromising, so he began instead to swing in favor of Berlin. All of France's friends were disappointed ‚Äì even the Pope told the French ambassador that, \\"Had you ordered the immediate advance of 200,000 men into the zone the Germans had occupied, you would have done everyone a very great favor.\\" With the Rhineland remilitarized, Germany started the construction of the Siegfried Line, which meant that if Germany attacked any of the states in the cordon sanitaire, the ability of France to threaten an invasion was henceforward limited.Weinberg (1970), p. 261. Such was the impact of the remilitarization on the balance of power that the Czechoslovak President Edvard Bene≈° seriously considered renouncing the alliance with France, and instead seeking a rapprochement with Germany, only abandoning that idea when it became clear that the price of a rapprochement with Hitler would be the effective loss of his country's independence. Likewise, King Carol II of Romania concluded that Romania might have to abandon its alliance with France, and instead accept that his country would have to move from being in the French sphere of influence to being in the German sphere of influence. When William C. Bullitt, the newly appointed American ambassador to France visited Germany in May 1936, he met with Baron von Neurath. On 18 May 1936, Bullitt reported to President Roosevelt that: > \\"Von Neurath said that it was the policy of the German government to do > nothing active in foreign affairs until \\"the Rhineland had been digested\\". > He explained that he meant that until the German fortifications had been > constructed on the French and Belgian borders, the German government would > do everything possible to prevent rather than encourage an outbreak by Nazis > in Austria and would pursue a quiet line with regard to Czechoslovakia. \\"As > soon as our fortifications are constructed and the countries of Central > Europe realize that France cannot enter German territory at will, all those > countries will begin to feel very differently about their foreign policies > and a new constellation will develop\\", he said\\".Shirer, p. 295. Between the 15‚Äì20 June 1936, the chiefs of staff of the Little Entente of Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia met to discuss the changed international situation. They decided to maintain their present plans for a war with Hungary, but concluded that, with the Rhineland now remilitarized, there was little hope of effective French action in the event of a war with Germany.Weinberg (1970), pp. 261‚Äì262. The meeting ended with the conclusion that there now were only two great powers in Eastern Europe, namely Germany and the Soviet Union, and the best that could be hoped for was to avoid another war that would almost certainly mean the loss of their nations' independence, regardless of who won. Weinberg wrote that attitude of the entire German elite and much of the German people, that any new war would only benefit Germany and that ending the Rhineland's demilitarized status could only be a good thing as it opened the door to starting a new war, was an extremely short-sighted, self-destructive and stupid attitude, even from a narrowly German viewpoint. Weinberg notes that Germany lost its independence in 1945 and lost far more territory under the Oder-Neisse line imposed in 1945 than it ever had under Versailles, together with millions of dead and the destruction of its cities. Thus, from the German viewpoint, the best thing to do would have been to accept Versailles rather than start a new war‚Äîone which ended with Germany being totally crushed, partitioned and occupied.

Steele was an innovator and leader in American Midwest painting and is one of the most famous of Indiana's Hoosier Group painters. In addition to painting, Steele contributed writings, public lectures, and hours of community service on art juries that selected entries for national and international exhibitions, most notably the Universal Exposition (1900) in Paris, France, and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (1904) in Saint Louis, Missouri. He was also involved in organizing pioneering art associations, such as the Society of Western Artists. Steele‚Äôs work has appeared in a number of prestigious exhibitions, including the World‚Äôs Columbian Exposition (1893) in Chicago, Illinois; the Five Hoosier Painters exhibition (1894) in Chicago; the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (1904) in Saint Louis; the International Exhibit of Fine Arts (1910) in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Santiago, Chile; and at the Panama- Pacific International Exposition (1915) in San Francisco, California. Steele‚Äôs work is widely collected by museums and individuals. His paintings in public collections include those of the Haan Mansion Museum of Indiana Art, Indiana State Museum, Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Indiana University Art Museum in Bloomington, Indiana, among others. Steele‚Äôs contributions were recognized with honorary degrees from Wabash College in 1900 and Indiana University in 1916. In addition, Steele was elected to an associate membership in New York‚Äôs National Academy of Design in 1913. Early life and education Steele was born near Gosport in Owen County, Indiana, on September 11, 1847, the eldest child of Samuel Hamilton and Harriett Newell Evans Steele.Perry, Paint and Canvas, p. 26. Steele‚Äôs father was a saddle maker and farmer.Steele, The House of the Singing Winds, p. 4. In 1852 the family moved to Waveland in Montgomery County, Indiana, where Steele developed an interest in art and learned to draw.Perry, Paint and Canvas, p. 28-30. The T.C. Steele Boyhood Home at Waveland was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Steele began formal art training as a boy at the Waveland Collegiate Institute (Waveland Academy).Newton and Weiss, p. 436. At sixteen, he continued his art training at Asbury College (now DePauw University) in Greencastle, Indiana. Steele also studied briefly in Chicago, Illinois, and Cincinnati, Ohio, before returning to Indiana to paint portraits on commission.Perry, Paint and Canvas, p. 33 and 36. Marriage and family In 1870 Steele married Mary Elizabeth (Libby) Lakin.Steele, The House of the Singing Winds, p. 8. The couple moved to Battle Creek, Michigan, where a son Rembrandt, or Brandt, was born in 1870; a daughter Margaret (Daisy) was born in 1872.Perry, Paint and Canvas, p. 38-40. Soon after Daisy‚Äôs birth the family moved to Indianapolis, Indiana. Although it was difficult, Steele managed to support his family by painting commissioned portraits and commercial signs.Steele, The House of the Singing Winds, p. 11. Another son, Shirley, was born in Indianapolis in 1879.Perry, Paint and Canvas, p. 44. Libby, who suffered from chronic rheumatoid arthritis and tuberculosis, died in 1899. Daisy Steele married Gustave Neubacher of Indianapolis in 1905. Steele married Selma Laura Neubacher, an Indianapolis art educator and Gustave's older sister, on August 9, 1907, in Indianapolis. The newlyweds immediately moved into a newly constructed, four-room home, which they named the House of the Singing Winds, on more than of hilltop land in Brown County, Indiana. In 1910 Steele purchased the adjoining 40 acre tract as an addition to his original 171-acre tract, bringing the total acreage to .Deed Record Book 26, page 355 T. C. and Selma, who was twenty-five years younger than Steele, had no children together. She died on August 28, 1945. Career Steele pictured to the far left in the painting \\"The Art Jury\\" by right =Munich, Germany= To help Steele obtain additional art training in Europe, his friend and art patron, Herman Lieber, arranged to provide financial support for the family so Steele could study at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich.Perry, Paint and Canvas, p. 46. In exchange for future paintings from Steele, thirteen patrons each pledged $100 to support Steele‚Äôs studies. In 1880 the Steele family sailed to Europe with fellow Hoosiers J. Ottis Adams, Carrie Wolf, August Metzner, and Samuel Richards. The group was joined two years later by Hoosier artist William Forsyth.Krause, p. 14. In addition to training at the Royal Academy under the instruction of artists Gyula Bencz√∫r and Ludwig L√∂fftz, Steele spent hours studying paintings of the Old Masters in Munich‚Äôs Alte Pinakothek galleries.Gerdts, et al., p. 12. He also painted in the countryside with his family and other artists, including Boston landscape painter J. Frank Currier.Steele, The House of the Singing Winds, p. 18. Steele enjoyed plein air, or outdoor painting, which is reflected in many of his landscapes. At Steele‚Äôs request, his sponsors extended their financial support so that he could continue studies in Munich for two more years.Perry, Paint and Canvas, p. 15. Steele also used funds earned from painting copies of Old Masters to pay for several additional months before the family returned to Indiana in 1885.Steele, The House of the Singing Winds, p. 31. =Central Indiana= Upon their return to Indianapolis, the Steele family rented the Tinker mansion (Talbott Place) at Sixteenth and Pennsylvania Streets. Steele kept a studio downtown, where he could paint and display his work while he earned a living primarily as a portrait painter and art teacher. Around 1886 Steele had a studio built on the Tinker property, and the home, already an Indianapolis landmark, became a hub for the local arts community.Perry, Paint and Canvas, p. 47 and 50. Steele‚Äôs paintings showed a notable change in style after his return from Munich. Steele‚Äôs Munich paintings sported dark, drab colors and high contrasts, but his work in Indiana gradually shifted toward a brighter, more vivid color palette. Steele was especially interested in capturing the beauty of nature through expressions of light and color.Steele Papers Collection Guide, \\"Biographical Sketch.\\" His paintings included both urban and rural scenes and depicted changes of season as well as weather conditions of snow, rain, and sunshine.Gerdts, p. 15. Steele's works show a \\"sympathic\\" and \\"technical grasp of his subjects\\" with a \\"comprehension of the majestic aspects of nature\\" with \\"much feeling for the influence of light and atmosphere.\\"Burnet, p. 216. In addition to local exhibitions, Steele‚Äôs art appeared outside of Indiana, including the Eighth Annual Exhibition of the prestigious Society of American Artists at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City in 1886.Steele, The House of the Singing Winds, p. 35. During the summer months, Steele took his family to the country, where he painted rural landscapes. The Muscatatuck River near Vernon, Indiana, was a favorite locale.Perry, Paint and Canvas, p. 50-51. Fellow landscape artist Forsyth frequently accompanied Steele on these expeditions. Steele also painted in Vermont and Tennessee, where he had taken his first wife, Libby, in hopes of improving her health.Steele, The House of the Singing Winds, p. 189. The 1890s were a turning point in Steele‚Äôs career. In 1890 Steele published The Steele Portfolio, which contained twenty-five photogravure prints of his paintings, including The Boatman, his prize-winning student work from Munich. In 1891 Forsyth joined Steele as an instructor at the Indiana Art School, which Steele established in 1889. Steele continued to teach there until 1895, before returning to painting on a full-time basis. In November 1894 the Art Association of Indianapolis sponsored the Exhibit of Summer Work by Steele, Forsyth, Richard B. Gruelle, and Otto Stark. The exhibition so impressed art critic and novelist Hamlin Garland that he arranged to have the exhibition shown in Chicago. Sponsored by the Central Art Association, the Indiana exhibit, called Five Hoosier Painters, expanded to include paintings by Adams. This Chicago exhibition is credited with launching the careers of the Hoosier Group of Indiana painters.Perry, Paint and Canvas, p. 53-55 and 59. Throughout the 1890s, Steele painted landscapes during the warm months and returned to a winter studio to paint portraits, still his primary source of income. In addition, Steele actively exhibited his work, delivered lectures, and helped organize the Society of Western Artists, whose annual exhibition attracted national attention. Steele later became the organization‚Äôs president.Perry, Paint and Canvas, p. 55, 61-62, and 69. Steele painted outdoors near Vernon, then moved on to Bloomington in Monroe County, Indiana, and Metamora in Franklin County, Indiana, where he did some of his best work.Perry, Paint and Canvas, p. 64. The area around Metamora was instrumental in the development of Hoosier landscape painting.Gerdts, p. 20. Fellow landscape painters Adams, Forsyth, Stark and others joined Steele as he painted outdoors. In 1898 Steele and Adams bought a home in Brookville, Indiana, eight miles east of Metamora, so they could be closer to the area‚Äôs scenic beauty. Named The Hermitage, the home was quiet, secluded, and provided a place where the artists could work without interruption.Perry, Paint and Canvas, p. 67-68. In 1899 Steele became a member of the jury that selected American paintings for inclusion in the Paris Universal Exposition in 1900, a world‚Äôs fair expected to attract millions of visitors. Sadly, Steele's wife, Libby, died at the age of forty- nine in November 1899.Krause, p. 188. The new century marked a number of changes in Steele‚Äôs life. In 1900 he received an honorary master of arts degree from Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana. That same year the Art Association of Indianapolis received a large donation from John Herron to establish a museum and art school in the city. The association selected the Tinker mansion, Steele‚Äôs home in Indianapolis, and purchased the property from his landlord.Krause, p. 226. Steele‚Äôs art studio became the first Herron School of Art.Burnet, p. 223. Steele leased another home on East Saint Clair Street in Indianapolis. Portrait commissions remained a major source of income for Steele and his subjects included poet James Whitcomb Riley, the official portraits of several Indiana governors, President Benjamin Harrison, and other prominent Hoosiers.Steele, The House of the Singing Winds, p. 150. In 1902 Steele and his daughter, Daisy, traveled to the West Coast to visit family in Oregon and Redlands, California. The cross-county trip inspired Steele to paint more than a dozen exceptional works of art. He entered several of his West Coast paintings in the Society of Western Artists‚Äô Sixth Annual Exhibition, which was well received by art critics. Steele and his daughter made another cross-country trip in 1903. A year later Steele was invited to be a juror on the selection committee of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, the 1904 world‚Äôs fair at Saint Louis. Four of Steele‚Äôs paintings were selected for the exposition and an additional five paintings were shown in the Indiana Building.Perry, Paint and Canvas, p. 76-79. At home in Indianapolis, Steele became actively involved in plans for the Art Association‚Äôs new museum, serving as chair of the acquisitions committee. The Tinker house was demolished in 1905 to make space for the Herron Art Institute.Krause, p. 227. In 1906 Steele sold his interest in The Hermitage at Brookville to Adams and returned to Indianapolis, where he remained active in the arts community.Perry, Paint and Canvas, p. 80-82. =Brown County, Indiana= T. C. Steele home and studio T. C. Steele home and studio As Steele explored new places to paint, he discovered an isolated area of Brown County, Indiana, where he built a hilltop studio-home on of land one and a half miles south of Belmont, between Bloomington and Nashville, Indiana. Steele moved into the new summer residence with his second wife, Selma, in August 1907. Inspired by the breezes blowing through the cottage‚Äôs screened porches, they named it the House of the Singing Winds.Perry, Paint and Canvas, pp. 85, 91-92. The land, while not suitable for agricultural purpose, provided Steele with \\"beautiful picturesque woods and hills and valleys.\\"Burnet, p. 212. Slowly, over time, the Steeles developed their Brown County property, acquiring additional acreage to increase it to a total of of land, and making further improvements to include an enlarged home and surround it with beautiful gardens, a barn-sized studio-gallery, and several other outbuildings. The couple made it their year-round residence in 1912.Perry, Paint and Canvas, p. 105.Perry, \\"Selma Neubacher Steele,\\" Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History, p. 12. Shortly before Selma's death in 1945, she donated the property on of land to the Indiana Department of Conservation (the present-day Indiana Department of Natural Resources) to establish a state historic site in memory of her husband. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 as the Theodore Clement Steele House and Studio. From: The Indiana Department of Natural Resources operated the T. C. Steele State Historic Site until the Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites took over site managementhttps://tcsteele.org/. The site is open to the public and offers guided tours of the home and studio. See also: Steele kept a studio in Indianapolis, but his home in rural Brown County increasingly attracted visitors and other artists to the area. Despite its remote location, visitors came out of curiosity to see the scenic beauty surrounding the painter's home. Steele's presence in Brown County, along with other full-time resident artists such as Will Vawter, Gustave Baumann, Dale Bessire, and others, helped attract newcomers to the growing Brown County Art Colony.Steele, The House of the Singing Winds, p. 106. Steele's reputation in the art world continued to rise. In 1913 he was elected as an associate artist to the National Academy of Design in New York, confirming Steele's standing as the most famous Hoosier artist of his time. Three of his paintings were accepted in the prestigious Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, California, in 1915.Perry, Paint and Canvas, pp. 107-108, 112. Later years In 1922 Steele accepted an appointment as Indiana University‚Äôs first artist in residence. Steele and his wife, Selma, rented a home in Bloomington, Indiana, during the winter months, but returned to their home in Brown County each summer. On campus Steele kept a studio on the top floor of IU's University Library (now Franklin Hall), where he and his wife greeted visitors and students could watch him paint.Perry, Paint and Canvas, p. 127.Perry, \\"Selma Neubacher Steele,\\" Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History, p. 13. Steele continued to exhibit his art, including a major exhibition called the Hoosier Salon, held in Chicago and organized by The Daughters of Indiana.Steele, The House of the Singing Winds, p. 163. He also maintained a busy lecture schedule.Perry, Paint and Canvas, p. 131-133. Death and legacy In December 1925, Steele suffered a heart attack. Although he recovered and continued to paint, he became ill the following June and died at home in Brown County on July 24, 1926.Steele, The House of the Singing Winds, p. 166. His ashes were buried on a hillside that was reserved for a family cemetery (the T. C. Steele Memorial Cemetery) on the Steeles' property near Belmont in Brown County, Indiana.In addition to Steele's ashes, the remains of Steele's wife, Selma, and members of her family are buried in a family cemetery.

Plot Eileen Tyler (Fonda), a 22-year-old music critic for the Albany Times Union, is suffering from her breakup with Russ (Robert Culp) from a rich Albany family. She comes to New York City to visit her brother Adam (Robertson), who is an airline pilot. Eileen confides to her brother that she thinks she may be the only 22-year-old virgin left in the world. Adam assures her that sex is not what all men look for and insists he hasn't slept around. Of course, Adam is lying and is in hot pursuit of a tryst with his occasional girlfriend Mona. However, Adam's date with Mona has a series of job-related interruptions. Meanwhile, Eileen decides to see if she can have some fun in New York, and seems to find the perfect candidate in Mike (Taylor), a man she meets on the bus. But things get complicated when Russ pops in with a proposal and a mistaken assumption. Mike later confesses to Eileen his feelings whereby she has a change of heart.

Jane Fonda was also offered the lead but she turned it down to make The Chapman Report which she felt was more challenging.Kiernan p 113 The lead roles went to Pat Stanley, Robert Redford and Conrad Janis. Redford had deliberately sought out to do a comedy on Broadway because he had been doing so much heavy drama on stage and TV. He lobbied for the role; producer David Merrick was reluctant but eventually agreed to audition him. Kanin later said he did not intend to cast Redford in the lead as \\"we already had a major New York actor signed and sealed and in the wings.\\"Callan p 88 Kanin auditioned Redford for a lesser part then the actor asked if he could read for the lead. The director agreed and said Redford gave \\"a subtle, funny, original performance\\" as Mike Mitchell. \\"He was canny. He'd been holding back on the first reading, which wasn't terrific, because he believed he was the lead.\\"Callan p 89 In order to do the play Redford pulled out of a three- picture deal he had signed with the Sanders brothers to make War Hunt which resulted in a law suit that kept him off screen until 1964.

It also contributed to George Roy Hill casting him in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid because it gave Hill confidence Redford could handle comedy.Spada p 112 Production The play was seen on Broadway by Eliot Hyman and Ray Stark of Seven Arts Productions who \\"thought it would make a good movie,\\" according to Stark.MOVIE PRODUCER DESCRIBES CREDO: Stark of 7 Arts Cites Quick Decisions and Investing Hold the Most Stock Disagree Occasionally By MURRAY SCHUMACH The New York Times.. 5 July 1962: 20.

Rod Taylor later said he and Fonda \\"got on like a couple of lovely kids\\"Freedland p 69 adding the film \\"seemed like a labor of love to her... [it] was a wonderful, frothy time.\\"Freeland p 70 Reception =Critical= In a review of the playwright's \\"frank screen version\\" of the play, Bosley Crowther characterized the film as another in a series of films that dwelled on a subject first brought to the screen ten years earlier in The Moon Is Blue: \\"There once was a time when the candor of Mr. Krasna's mildly popular Broadway play about an Albany girl who struggles bravely with the problem of her virtue during a rainy afternoon in New York might have caused the Production Code people a moment or two of anxious pause. They might then have thought it a bit too racy for youthful and innocent ears\\"; on the film itself, Crowther said \\"the extent of the film's disconcertion and delight for a viewer will depend upon how prone one may be to a juvenile quandary and to the nimble performing of a pleasant cast. The twists of the plot are downright hackneyed‚Äîthe confusions of opening the wrong doors, mistaking people and getting caught in dishabille. But the actors are all attractive, and so long as one can go along with them in their valiant attempts at pretending this is hot stuff, one may have a good time.\\" According to Time magazine, \\"Sunday in New York is another brightly salacious Hollywood comedy about the way of a man with a maid who just may. 'This motion picture,' leers an announcement flashed on the screen as a teaser, 'is dedicated to the proposition that every girl gets...sooner or later.' As usual, winking wickedness turns out to be mostly eyewash, but the plot--more to be pitied than censored--gets a buoyant lift from stars Jane Fonda, Cliff Robertson and Rod Taylor. All three abandon themselves to the film version of Norman Krasna's trite Broadway farce with disarming faith, as though one more glossy, glittering package of pseudo sex might save the world.\\" =Box Office= The film was a minor hit, earned $2 million in rentals in North America. In 2019 Jane Fonda reflected \\"I‚Äôm surprised how many people say they love Sunday in New York..

She was President of Professional Women Photographers (PWP) from 1979 until 1984. Niccolini's work has had multiple gallery showings and has been published in many magazines and over twenty anthologies. In November 2014, Emory University's Manuscript, Archives and Rare Book Library (MARBL) in Atlanta, Georgia acquired Niccolini's photographs, artwork, and papers.  Biography  Dianora Niccolini is considered to be one of the pioneering fine arts photographers of the male nude. Although Niccolini's specialty was in photographing the male nude, at the time his was a style relegated to homosexual circles and was considered taboo at the time. In 1975, however, the Third Eye Gallery in New York City gave Niccolini a solo exhibition. The exhibition was titled The Male Nude. This was the first gallery exhibit of male nudes by anyone, and is thought to have legitimized and de-stigmatized the male nude in the art community. Her body studies have been included in many photographic anthologies and were also widely exhibited in the mid-seventies and pre-dated Mapplethorpe's images of body builders by several years. Niccolini went on to be the first president Professional Women Photographers, serving from 1979 to 1984. Under her leadership, Professional Women Photographers became recognized as a leading professional organization for women photographers. In early 2005, Niccolini began working with Mega Muscle Productions, a publisher of images of male fitness models. In 2011, the Florida Museum of Photographic Arts in Tampa, Florida, mounted a solo exhibition of Niccolini's photography.

A noted photographer, he is also credited with creating India's first advertising films and quite possibly India's first political film. A fire in 1917 destroyed all of his films. Early life Hiralal Sen's native home was in Bagjuri, a village in Manikganj, approximately 80 km from Dhaka, the present-day capital of Bangladesh. Although he was the son of a successful lawyer of a Baidya zamindar family of that region, he grew up in Calcutta. In 1898, a film troupe en route to Paris screened a certain Professor Stevenson's short film along with the stage show, The Flower of Persia at the Star Theatre in Calcutta. Borrowing Stevenson's camera, Sen made his first film, \\"A Dancing Scene\\" from the opera The Flower of Persia. With assistance from his brother, Motilal Sen, he bought an Urban Bioscope from Charles Urban's Warwick Trading Company in London. In the following year, with his brother, he formed the Royal Bioscope company.  Creative years  In a creative career that extended up to 1913, Hiralal Sen made over forty short films. Most of the films he made depicted scenes from theatrical productions played at Amarendra Dutta's Classic Theatre in Calcutta. At that time raw film was imported into the country. Between 1901 and 1904, he produced many films for Classic Theatre including Bhramar, Hariraj, and Buddhadev. His longest film, produced in 1903 and titled Alibaba and the Forty Thieves, was also based on an original Classic Theatre performance. However, not much is known about this feature film since it was never screened. He also produced a number of advertising films and newsfilms taking commissions. Having made two films advertising Jabakusum Hair Oil and Edwards Tonic, he became the first Indian to use film for advertising purposes.  India's first political film  In 1905, Sen advertised a \\"genuine Swadeshi film of our own make\\". Documenting the \\"Anti-Partition Demonstration and Swadeshi movement at the Town Hall, Calcutta, on the 22nd September 1905\\", it is, according to critic Samik Bandyopadhyay, India's first political film.  Later years  Royal Bioscope made its last film in 1913. Hiralal Sen's later years were filled with disappointment and economic hardship. Jamshedji Framji Madan of the Elphinstone Bioscope Company had long surpassed him in terms of success. To compound his misery, he was also suffering from cancer. A few days before his death in 1917, a fire broke out destroying every film he ever made.

It is about 50 km long and 20 km across at its widest point. The Torilla Peninsula forms the eastern side of the bay; Shoalwater Bay is on the other side of the peninsula. History British explorer James Cook, in HMS Endeavour, sighted the bay in May 1770, naming it for its size. The next European navigator in the area was Matthew Flinders in HMS Investigator in 1802. The town of St Lawrence was established midway between Rockhampton and Mackay on St Lawrence Creek and developed as a port for the export of cattle from the hinterland, with a large meatworks built close by in 1893. The processing and export of meat and cattle continued until 1919 when rail links were built elsewhere, making the port redundant. By 2006 the population of St Lawrence had dropped to 125, out of a population in the Broad Sound area of 268. Description The bay has a low- lying coastline with wide mudflats exposed at low tide and backed by extensive areas of mangroves. The head of the bay has the greatest tidal range on Australia's east coast - around 9 m. The coastline is punctuated by the mangrove-lined estuaries of several rivers and creeks, including Herbert and St Lawrence Creeks and the Styx River. Behind the mangroves is a hinterland of low, rounded hills covered by a mix of grassland and low eucalypt woodland or forest. The climate is subtropical with a dry winter.Queensland by Degrees. Birds The extensive tracts of mangroves and mudflats, comprising some 1200 km2 in the southern part of the bay, have been classified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area. It supports globally important populations of the straw-necked ibis (with up to 15,000 individual birds), Australian bustard, Latham's snipe, sharp-tailed sandpiper and mangrove honeyeater.Birdata.

It is one of the first companies to pioneer the reality style videos of adult entertainment. The company was originally started by Seymore Butts' ex- girlfriend Shane, who lent her name to the business. Shane sold the company in 1999 after she decided to get married and leave the adult industry. History Shane's World movies revolve around taking porn stars out of their element on trips to exotic or interesting locations and filming everything that happens in a documentary style. The premise of the studio's movies can be summed up as \\"The Real World meets gonzo style pornography\\". Shane's World has given many stars their start, which helps to increase their fan base because of the intimate look fans are allowed into their personality. In 2003 Shane's World gained mainstream notoriety with the release of Shane's World 32: Campus Invasion. The media interest which followed that trip to Indiana University landed the company on Dateline NBC, The O'Reilly Factor, Inside Edition, USA Today, Time magazine and MTV News. Rolling Stone magazine gave Shane's World a four-page spread in their \\"100 Greatest Guitarists\\" issue. Shane's World also became the first adult company to be featured in an Abercrombie and Fitch catalog. The company has been criticized for exploiting drunken college students who will later regret their performance in a porn movie. Due to the success of Shane's World 32, Shane's World decided that college campuses were an untapped market and so the College Invasion series began. College Invasion titles bring porn stars to college campuses to party with the students, and starting with volume 3, the college students often participate and have sex with the porn stars. The studio claims it gets hundreds of invitation letters a month from students across the country who want them to come to their school. The series hit its 11th volume in March 2007. On August 29, 2007, Shane's World released its first College Invasion Male title, a series that sees male porn stars visit gay college parties. The company has won several awards within the Adult Entertainment industry, including Best Couples Sex video and Best Couples Sex series, as well as Most Sex-Positive Adult Company by the Sexuality.org awards. College Invasion won 'Best Gonzo Series' at the 2007 AVN Awards. Shane's World Studios also markets a line of adult novelties through Cal Exotics. In October 2008, Shane's World announced that it had launched a competition through its YouTube channel to find the college at which they would shoot the next episode of their College Invasion series. The announcement encouraged non-pornographic clips only of between 1 and 2 minutes in length shot by students on the grounds of their college.

At the peak of the Vietnam war upheaval in the United States in May 1968, Warner graduated from Yale University with a B.A. degree and intended to go to Yale medical school after leaving Yale undergraduate. Without a college deferment, Warner most likely would have been classified as 1-A, that is to say, classified as available immediately for military service. For example, President Bush was classified as 1-A on Bush's graduation from Yale in May 1968 and was accepted into the Texas Air National Guard at the height of the ongoing Vietnam War. With the Vietnam war and Yale medical school choices facing Warner, Warner looked to a third option based on advice from his father, an insurance man from Cincinnati, Ohio.

The song tells of the narrator's despair, upon hearing Christmas bells during the American Civil War, that \\"hate is strong and mocks the song of peace on earth, good will to men\\". The carol concludes with the bells carrying renewed hope for peace among men. Origin In 1861, two years before writing this poem, Longfellow's personal peace was shaken when his second wife of 18 years, to whom he was very devoted, was fatally burned in an accidental fire. Then in 1863, during the American Civil War, Longfellow's oldest son, Charles Appleton Longfellow, joined the Union Army without his father's blessing. Longfellow was informed by a letter dated March 14, 1863, after Charles had left. \\"I have tried hard to resist the temptation of going without your leave but I cannot any longer\\", he wrote. \\"I feel it to be my first duty to do what I can for my country and I would willingly lay down my life for it if it would be of any good.\\" Charles was soon appointed as a lieutenant but, in November, he was severely wounded in the Battle of Mine Run. Charles eventually recovered, but his time as a soldier was finished. Longfellow wrote the poem on Christmas Day in 1863. \\"Christmas Bells\\" was first published in February 1865, in Our Young Folks, a juvenile magazine published by Ticknor and Fields. References to the Civil War are prevalent in some of the verses that are not commonly sung. The refrain \\"peace on Earth, goodwill to men\\" is a reference to the King James Version of Luke 2:14. Lyrics The following are the original words of Longfellow's poem: I heard the bells on Christmas Day Their old, familiar carols play, :and wild and sweet :The words repeat Of peace on earth, good- will to men! And thought how, as the day had come, The belfries of all Christendom :Had rolled along :The unbroken song Of peace on earth, good-will to men! Till ringing, singing on its way, The world revolved from night to day, :A voice, a chime, :A chant sublime Of peace on earth, good-will to men! Then from each black, accursed mouth The cannon thundered in the South, :And with the sound :The carols drowned Of peace on earth, good-will to men! It was as if an earthquake rent The hearth-stones of a continent, :And made forlorn :The households born Of peace on earth, good-will to men! And in despair I bowed my head; \\"There is no peace on earth,\\" I said; :\\"For hate is strong, :And mocks the song Of peace on earth, good-will to men!\\" Then pealed the bells more loud and deep: \\"God is not dead, nor doth He sleep; :The Wrong shall fail, :The Right prevail, With peace on earth, good-will to men.\\"  Musical renditions  It was not until 1872 that the poem is known to have been set to music. The English organist, John Baptiste Calkin, used the poem in a processional accompanied with a melody \\"Waltham\\" that he previously used as early as 1848. The Calkin version of the carol was long the standard. Less commonly, the poem has also been set to Joseph Mainzer's 1845 composition \\"Mainzer\\". Since at least the middle of the 20th century, the poem has been set to other musical arrangements, most notably in 1956 by Johnny Marks. Bing Crosby recorded the song on October 3, 1956, using Marks's melody and verses 1, 2, 6, 7. It was released as a single and reached No. 55 in the Music Vendor survey. The record was praised by both Billboard and Variety. \\"Bing Crosby's workover of 'I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day' looks like a big one for the '56 Yule and a hit potential of enduring value.\\"Variety, November 7, 1956. \\"At deadline time, not many of this year's Christmas issues had shown much action. This new Crosby record, however, was off to a promising start. As fast as it is catching on early in the month, it is easy to project the impressive volume it will rack up the last half of December.\\"Billboard, December 15, 1956. Marks's tune has since received more than 60 commercial recordings, with total sales exceeding 5 million copies. In chapter five of his 1962 novel Something Wicked This Way Comes, Ray Bradbury describes this carol as \\"immensely moving, overwhelming, no matter what day or what month it was sung.\\" The carol provides an ironic contrast to the evil that Mr. Dark's carnival is about to bring to Green Town, Illinois. In the 1983 film adaptation of the novel, Mr. Dark (Jonathan Pryce) and Charles Halloway (Jason Robards) both quote passages from the carol when they meet in the town's library (though Dark ominously states that \\"it's a thousand years to Christmas\\"). In 2008, a contemporary Christian music group, Casting Crowns, scored their eighth No. 1 Christian hit with \\"I Heard the Bells\\", from their album Peace on Earth. The song is not an exact replica of the original poem or carol, but an interpolation of verses 1, 6, 7 and 3 (in that order), interposed with a new chorus.

Primarily a second baseman, Lintz stood tall and weighed . He was a switch-hitter who threw right-handed. In six Major League seasons, Lintz played in 350 games and had 137 runs, 140 hits, and 128 stolen bases. Career Lintz signed with the Expos after being selected out of San Jose State University in the sixth round of the 1971 Major League Baseball draft. He began his career with the Watertown Expos that year, finishing with a .280 batting average in 65 games. In 1972, he spent the season with the Quebec Carnavals. In 131 games, he recorded 96 stolen bases in 107 attempts, which was an Eastern League record. After spending part of 1973 with the Peninsula Whips, the Expos promoted him to the major league roster. Lintz made his debut on July 14, 1973, and played in 52 games. In the following season, he played in 113 games, finishing the year with a .238 batting average and 50 stolen bases, which was fifth in the National League. After 46 games with the Expos in 1975, he was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for Jim Dwyer, and finished the season with them; after the season ended he was traded to the Oakland Athletics for Charlie Chant. In 1976, Lintz was used almost exclusively by the Athletics as a pinch-runner, appearing in 68 games with only one at-bat; during that season he scored 21 runs and stole 31 bases in 42 attempts. After spending 1977 with the Athletics, Lintz signed with the Cleveland Indians. He played in three games to end his major league career, and spent most of the season with the minor league Portland Beavers. He played in three games for the Tacoma Tugs, the following season, then retired.

These theories cite environmental, personal, and behavioural characteristics as the major factors in behavioural determination. In recent years, there has been increased interest in the application of these theories in the areas of health, education, criminology, energy and international development with the hope that understanding behavioural change will improve the services offered in these areas. Some scholars have recently introduced a distinction between models of behavior and theories of change. Whereas models of behavior are more diagnostic and geared towards understanding the psychological factors that explain or predict a specific behavior, theories of change are more process- oriented and generally aimed at changing a given behavior. Thus, from this perspective, understanding and changing behavior are two separate but complementary lines of scientific investigation. General theories and models Each behavioural change theory or model focuses on different factors in attempting to explain behaviour change. Of the many that exist, the most prevalent are learning theories, social cognitive theory, theories of reasoned action and planned behaviour, transtheoretical model of behavior change, the health action process approach and the BJ Fogg model of behavior change. Research has also been conducted regarding specific elements of these theories, especially elements like self-efficacy that are common to several of the theories. =Self-efficacy= Self-efficacy is an individual's impression of their own ability to perform a demanding or challenging task such as facing an exam or undergoing surgery. This impression is based upon factors like the individual's prior success in the task or in related tasks, the individual's physiological state, and outside sources of persuasion. Self-efficacy is thought to be predictive of the amount of effort an individual will expend in initiating and maintaining a behavioural change, so although self-efficacy is not a behavioural change theory per se, it is an important element of many of the theories, including the health belief model, the theory of planned behaviour and the health action process approach. =Learning theories and behaviours analytic theories of changes= =Social learning and social cognitive theory= According to the social learning theory (more recently expanded as social cognitive theory), behavioural change is determined by environmental, personal, and behavioural elements. Each factor affects each of the others. For example, in congruence with the principles of self-efficacy, an individual's thoughts affect their behaviour and an individual's characteristics elicit certain responses from the social environment. Likewise, an individual's environment affects the development of personal characteristics as well as the person's behavior, and an individual's behaviour may change their environment as well as the way the individual thinks or feels. Social learning theory focuses on the reciprocal interactions between these factors, which are hypothesised to determine behavioral change. =Theory of reasoned action= The theory of reasoned action assumes that individuals consider a behaviour's consequences before performing the particular behaviour. As a result, intention is an important factor in determining behaviour and behavioural change. According to Icek Ajzen, intentions develop from an individual's perception of a behaviour as positive or negative together with the individual's impression of the way their society perceives the same behaviour. Thus, personal attitude and social pressure shape intention, which is essential to performance of a behaviour and consequently behavioural change. =Theory of planned behaviour= In 1985, Ajzen expanded upon the theory of reasoned action, formulating the theory of planned behaviour, which also emphasises the role of intention in behaviour performance but is intended to cover cases in which a person is not in control of all factors affecting the actual performance of a behaviour. As a result, the new theory states that the incidence of actual behaviour performance is proportional to the amount of control an individual possesses over the behaviour and the strength of the individual's intention in performing the behaviour. In his article, Further hypothesises that self-efficacy is important in determining the strength of the individual's intention to perform a behaviour. In 2010, Fishbein and Ajzen introduced the reasoned action approach, the successor of the theory of planned behaviour. =Transtheoretical or stages of change model= According to the transtheoretical model of behavior change, also known as the stages of change model, states that there are five stages towards behavior change. The five stages, between which individuals may transition before achieving complete change, are precontemplation, contemplation, preparation for action, action, and maintenance. At the precontemplation stage, an individual may or may not be aware of a problem but has no thought of changing their behavior. From precontemplation to contemplation, the individual begins thinking about changing a certain behavior. During preparation, the individual begins his plans for change, and during the action stage the individual begins to exhibit new behavior consistently. An individual finally enters the maintenance stage once they exhibit the new behavior consistently for over six months. A problem faced with the stages of change model is that it is very easy for a person to enter the maintenance stage and then fall back into earlier stages. Factors that contribute to this decline include external factors such as weather or seasonal changes, and/or personal issues a person is dealing with. =Health action process approach= The health action process approach (HAPA) is designed as a sequence of two continuous self-regulatory processes, a goal- setting phase (motivation) and a goal-pursuit phase (volition). The second phase is subdivided into a pre-action phase and an action phase. Motivational self-efficacy, outcome-expectancies and risk perceptions are assumed to be predictors of intentions. This is the motivational phase of the model. The predictive effect of motivational self-efficacy on behaviour is assumed to be mediated by recovery self-efficacy, and the effects of intentions are assumed to be mediated by planning. The latter processes refer to the volitional phase of the model. = Fogg Behavior Model = The BJ Fogg Behavior Model. The different levels of ability and motivation define whether triggers for behavior change will succeed or fail. As an example trying to trigger behavior change through something difficult to do (low ability) will only succeed with very high motivation. In contrast, trying to trigger behavior change through something easy to do (high ability) may succeed even with average motivation. The Fogg Behavior Model (FBM) is a design behavior change model introduced by BJ Fogg. This model posits that behavior is composed of three different factors: motivation, ability and triggers. Under the FBM, for any person (user) to succeed at behavior change needs to be motivated, have the ability to perform the behavior and needs a trigger to perform this behavior. The next are the definitions of each of the elements of the BFM:  Motivation  BJ Fogg does not provide a definition of motivation but instead defines different motivators: * Pleasure/Pain: These motivators produce a response immediately and although powerful these are not ideal. Boosting motivation could be achieved by embodying pain or pleasure. * Hope/fear: Both these motivators have a delayed response and are the anticipation of a future positive outcome (hope) or negative outcome (fear). As an example people joining a dating website hope to meet other people. * Social acceptance/rejection: People are motivated by behaviors that increase or preserve their social acceptance.  Ability  This factor refers to the self efficacy perception at performing a target behavior. Although low ability is undesirable it may be unavoidable: \\"We are fundamentally lazy\\" according to BJ Fogg. In such case behavior change is approached not through learning but instead by promoting target behaviors for which the user has a high ability. Additionally BJ Fogg list several elements or dimensions that characterize high ability or simplicity of performing a behavior: * Time: The user has the time to perform the target behavior or the time taken is very low. * Money: The user has enough financial resources for pursuing the behavior. In some cases money can buy time. * Physical effort: Target behaviors that require of physical effort may not be simple enough to be performed. * Brain cycles: Target behaviors that require of high cognitive resources may not be simple hence undesirable for behavior change. * Social deviance: These comprehend behaviors that make the user socially deviant. These kind of behaviors are not simple * Non-routine: Any behavior that incurs disrupting a routine is considered not simple. Simple behaviors are usually part of routines and hence easy to follow.  Triggers  Triggers are reminders that may be explicit or implicit about the performance of a behavior. Examples of triggers can be alarms, text messages or advertisement, triggers are usually perceptual in nature but may also be intrinsic. One of the most important aspects of a trigger is timing as only certain times are best for triggering certain behaviors. As an example if a person is trying to go to the gym everyday, but only remembers about packing clothing once out of the house it is less likely that this person will head back home and pack. In contrast if an alarm sounds right before leaving the house reminding about packing clothing, this will take considerably less effort. Although the original article does not have any references for the reasoning or theories behind the model, some of its elements can be traced to social psychology theories, e.g., the motivation and ability factors and its success or failure are related to Self-efficacy. =Education= Behavioural change theories can be used as guides in developing effective teaching methods. Since the goal of much education is behavioural change, the understanding of behaviour afforded by behavioural change theories provides insight into the formulation of effective teaching methods that tap into the mechanisms of behavioural change. In an era when education programs strive to reach large audiences with varying socioeconomic statuses, the designers of such programs increasingly strive to understand the reasons behind behavioural change in order to understand universal characteristics that may be crucial to program design. In fact, some of the theories, like the social learning theory and theory of planned behaviour, were developed as attempts to improve health education. Because these theories address the interaction between individuals and their environments, they can provide insight into the effectiveness of education programs given a specific set of predetermined conditions, like the social context in which a program will be initiated. Although health education is still the area in which behavioural change theories are most often applied, theories like the stages of change model have begun to be applied in other areas like employee training and developing systems of higher education. =Criminology= Empirical studies in criminology support behavioural change theories. At the same time, the general theories of behavioural change suggest possible explanations to criminal behaviour and methods of correcting deviant behaviour. Since deviant behaviour correction entails behavioural change, understanding of behavioural change can facilitate the adoption of effective correctional methods in policy-making. For example, the understanding that deviant behaviour like stealing may be learned behaviour resulting from reinforcers like hunger satisfaction that are unrelated to criminal behaviour can aid the development of social controls that address this underlying issue rather than merely the resultant behaviour. Specific theories that have been applied to criminology include the social learning and differential association theories. Social learning theory's element of interaction between an individual and their environment explains the development of deviant behaviour as a function of an individual's exposure to a certain behaviour and their acquaintances, who can reinforce either socially acceptable or socially unacceptable behaviour. Differential association theory, originally formulated by Edwin Sutherland, is a popular, related theoretical explanation of criminal behaviour that applies learning theory concepts and asserts that deviant behaviour is learned behaviour. =Energy= Recent years have seen an increased interest in energy consumption reduction based on behavioural change, be it for reasons of climate change mitigation or energy security. The application of behavioural change theories in the field of energy consumption behaviour yields interesting insights. For example, it supports criticism of a too narrow focus on individual behaviour and a broadening to include social interaction, lifestyles, norms and values as well as technologies and policies‚Äîall enabling or constraining behavioural change.  Communication  Besides the models and theories of behavior change there are methods for promoting behavior change. Among them one of the most widely used is Tailoring or personalization. = Tailoring = Tailoring refers to methods for personalizing communications intended to generate higher behavior change than non personalized ones. There are two main claims for why tailoring works: Tailoring may improve preconditions for message processing and tailoring may improve impact by altering starting behavioral determinants of goal outcomes. The different message processing mechanisms can be summarized into: Attention, Effortful processing, Emotional processing and self-reference. * Attention: Tailored messages are more likely to be read and remembered * Effortful processing: Tailored messages elicit careful consideration of persuasive arguments and more systematic utilization of the receivers own schemas and memories. This could also turn out damaging because this careful consideration does increase counterarguing, evaluations of credibility and other processes that lessens message effects. * Peripheral emotion/processing: tailoring could be used to create an emotional response such as fear, hope or anxiety. Since positive emotions tend to reduce effortful processing and negative emotions enhance it, emotion arousal could elicit varying cognitive processing. * Self-reference: This mechanism promotes the comparison between actual and ideal behaviors and reflection. Behavioral determinants of goal outcomes are the different psychological and social constructs that have a direct influence on behavior. The three most used mediators in tailoring are attitude, perception of performance and self efficacy. Although results are largely positive they are not consistent and more research on the elements that make tailoring work is necessary. Objections Behavioural change theories are not universally accepted. Criticisms include the theories' emphases on individual behaviour and a general disregard for the influence of environmental factors on behaviour. In addition, as some theories were formulated as guides to understanding behaviour while others were designed as frameworks for behavioural interventions, the theories' purposes are not consistent. Such criticism illuminates the strengths and weaknesses of the theories, showing that there is room for further research into behavioural change theories.

They are of interest in transcendental number theory, and are more special than G-functions. Definition A function f(x) is called of type E, or an E-function,Carl Ludwig Siegel, Transcendental Numbers, p.33, Princeton University Press, 1949. if the power series :f(x)=\\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} c_{n}\\\\frac{x^{n}}{n!} satisfies the following three conditions: * All the coefficients cn belong to the same algebraic number field, K, which has finite degree over the rational numbers; * For all Œµ > 0, :\\\\overline{\\\\leftc_{n}\\\\right}=O\\\\left(n^{n\\\\varepsilon}\\\\right), where the left hand side represents the maximum of the absolute values of all the algebraic conjugates of cn; * For all Œµ > 0 there is a sequence of natural numbers q0, q1, q2,... such that qnck is an algebraic integer in K for k=0, 1, 2,..., n, and n = 0, 1, 2,... and for which :q_{n}=O\\\\left(n^{n\\\\varepsilon}\\\\right). The second condition implies that f is an entire function of x. Uses E-functions were first studied by Siegel in 1929.C.L. Siegel, √úber einige Anwendungen diophantischer Approximationen, Abh. Preuss. Akad. Wiss. 1, 1929. He found a method to show that the values taken by certain E-functions were algebraically independent. This was a result which established the algebraic independence of classes of numbers rather than just linear independence.Alan Baker, Transcendental Number Theory, pp.109-112, Cambridge University Press, 1975. Since then these functions have proved somewhat useful in number theory and in particular they have application in transcendence proofs and differential equations.Serge Lang, Introduction to Transcendental Numbers, pp.76-77, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1966. The Siegel‚ÄìShidlovsky theorem Perhaps the main result connected to E-functions is the Siegel‚ÄìShidlovsky theorem (also known as the Shidlovsky and Shidlovskii theorem), named after Carl Ludwig Siegel and Andrei Borisovich Shidlovskii. Suppose that we are given n E-functions, E1(x),...,En(x), that satisfy a system of homogeneous linear differential equations :y^\\\\prime_i=\\\\sum_{j=1}^n f_{ij}(x)y_j\\\\quad(1\\\\leq i\\\\leq n) where the fij are rational functions of x, and the coefficients of each E and f are elements of an algebraic number field K.

It was developed by Malfador Machinations and published by Strategy First. The game retains many races and technologies from its predecessor, Space Empires IV (SEIV). Gameplay While Space Empires V retains much of its predecessor's gameplay, there are several key differences. It is the first Space Empires game to use three-dimensional graphics, and as such, the user interface has been heavily redesigned. New to the series is a 3D real-time combat engine, and the player can now control ground combat in addition to the usual space battles. The empire-building aspects of the game borrows as much from the third instalment as it does from the fourth, with research and intelligence being assigned as a percentage of available points as opposed to the queue system used for construction. Races Virtually all of the stock races (with the exception of the Sithrak) are updated versions of SEIV races. Custom race creation is basically the same as in the previous games, with two notable changes - you must now select a government type in addition to a social paradigm, and the game master may grant players a set number of research points to improve starting technology. As of now, there are comparatively few player-created shipsets, arguably a consequence of the switch to 3D graphics. Reception The game received mixed reviews. Several have complained that the game is over-complex and overloads the player with options, especially while setting up a new game, and that it may not be suitable for players who are new to 4X games.

Founded in 1970 by Donald and Esther Howard, ACE's website states it is used in over 6,000 schools in 145 countries. ACE has been criticized for its content, heavy reliance on the use of rote recall as a learning tool and for the educational outcomes of pupils on leaving the Accelerated Christian Education system both in the US and the United Kingdom. History Accelerated Christian Education was founded in 1970 by Drs. Donald and Esther Howard. They set about developing a biblically literalist educational curriculum with Donald Howard traveling to promote ACE schools around the world as a new form of \\"educational mission\\". The first school which used the ACE program opened in Garland, Texas, and started with 45 students. By 1980 there were over 3,000 Christian schools in the United States associated with ACE, reaching 8,000 during the 1980s. In 1992 ACE opened a three-story facility in Lewisville, Texas, to handle its growing operations. Esther Howard took over control of ACE the following year. She remains as ACE's President, and Duane Howard, one of the couple's sons, currently serves as Vice President. In 2007, ACE moved its corporate offices to Madison, Tennessee, eventually moving to Hendersonville, Tennessee in 2014. The Lewisville facility remains as ACE's distribution center. Curriculum approach According to the curriculum section on its website, ACE's \\"core curriculum is an individualized, Biblically-based, character-building curriculum package\\" and is based on a series of workbooks called PACEs (Packets of Accelerated Christian Education). ACE's educational approach uses phonics to teach reading. Children learn using materials based on their level of understanding, not based on their age or chronological grade level and do not progress until the content is learned. At the beginning of each PACE is an overview, a scripture to memorize, a character trait to strive toward, and information on what, if any, supplies the student will need. Each subject has 12 PACEs per grade level. The basic subjects of ACE are mathematics (yellow), English (red), Literature & Creative Writing (light red), Word Building/Etymology (purple), science (blue), social studies (green), and Old and New Testament (light yellow). Students in the Philippines (under School of Tomorrow Philippines) also study Araling Panlipunan (brown) and Filipino (pink). A new student is given a diagnostic test, and the test results place the student at appropriate levels by subject. Students are required to set daily goals for work completion, score PACE goals correctly and completely, and are generally expected to complete a PACE within two to three weeks (depending on the school). Students are given review activities at certain points in a PACE (called \\"Checkups\\") and a test at its culmination (Self Test). Supervisors do not answer PACE questions nor do they give the answer, but guide students and encourage them to find the answer on their own. Should material in some PACE subjects be challenging, supervisors may need to adjust the students' goals accordingly. The passing score for the PACE Test can be from 80% to 90%, also depending on the corresponding school. Students who fail (including those who have committed minor or major scoring violations) (for example, a 100% on all three Checkups, 100% on the Self Test, and a 42% on the PACE Test) are mandated to take what measures the school provides to pass the failed PACE subject (such as repeating the Self Test and PACE Test or the entire PACE). Distribution and promotion Schools using the curriculum are not allowed to describe themselves as \\"ACE schools\\" or use the ACE logo although schools are expected to sign an agreement and follow the ACE Procedures Manual and Administration Manual. The program can be used by homeschooling families and private establishments; ACE provides instruction and structure for operating a \\"Christian school\\". ACE's website advises that schools are not required to use the entire curriculum and may augment it with other resources although this incurs a financial penalty as the school loses its discount. The company also sells home schooling and distance learning curriculum materials through its Lighthouse Christian Academy (LCA). ACE provides annual one-day training sessions called Christian Educators' Conventions (CEC) for administrators, supervisors, and monitors. These are provided in locations around the United States. The sessions focus on understanding and properly implementing the ACE program. For Learning Center Supervisors a four-day workshop is provided annually. The workshop is organized like an ACE classroom, allowing the supervisor to experience the ACE system as a student and learn how to implement the system. =ACE student conventions= Schools that use the ACE curriculum may participate in the Regional Student Conventions and the top-placed participants are able to proceed to the International Student Convention. This convention is usually held at a university campus, such as Indiana University in Bloomington (1990), the University of North Texas in Denton (1991), Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff (1993), and Purdue University in Indiana (1994). International Student Conventions have been held at Western Kentucky University (2010) with about 2,500 students, James Madison University (2011) 3,000 attending, New Mexico State University (2015) 2,500 participants, and Indiana University of Pennsylvania (2017) 2,200 students.http://u92radio.com/kcac-hosting-christian- student-convention/ The All Africa Student Convention takes place in South Africa once a year at the University of the Free State in Bloemfontein, South Africa. The All Africa Student Convention is not organized or hosted by ACE United States but by Accelerated Christian Education South Africa, which is a separate organization providing the ACE curriculum to African schools. The conventions also offer \\"Events of the Heart\\", which allow students with mental and physical disabilities to participate. When the conventions first started, a parade in the hosting city would accompany a convention. In 1981, over 3,000 students and sponsors marched in New York City to celebrate the opening of the convention at Rutgers University. Student conventions offer speakers; past speakers have included David Gibbs from the Christian Law Association, Ben Jordan and William Murray. Criticism =Use of rote recall= The curriculum's emphasis on rote recall has been criticized by educational researchers. David Berliner described the teaching methods as \\"low-level cognitive tasks that emphasize simple association and recall activities, as is typical of instruction from workbooks... the materials make heavy use of behavioral objectives, programmed learning, and rewards.\\"Hunter, 1987, \\"Accelerated Christian Education Inc.: Marching to a different drummer.\\", cited in Speck and Prideaux (1993), \\"Fundamentalist Education and Creation Science\\", Australian Journal of Education, November 1993, vol. 37 no. 3 279‚Äì295 D. Flemming and T Hunt in a 1987 article in the education journal Phi Delta Kappa analyzed the ACE curriculum, concluding that \\"If parents want their children to obtain a very limited and sometimes inaccurate view of the world ‚Äî one that ignores thinking above the level of rote recall ‚Äî then the ACE materials do the job very well. The world of the ACE materials is quite a different one from that of scholarship and critical thinking.\\" =Race and apartheid= The ACE curriculum included controversial content in relation to race. Social Studies (World History) PACE 108 stated, > Although apartheid appears to allow the unfair treatment of blacks, the > system has worked well in South Africa .... Although white businessmen and > developers are guilty of some unfair treatment of blacks, they turned South > Africa into a modern industrialized nation, which the poor, uneducated > blacks couldn't have accomplished in several more decades. If more blacks > were suddenly given control of the nation, its economy and business, as > Mandela wished, they could have destroyed what they have waited and worked > so hard for. ACE Social studies PACE also attempts to play down the role of slavery in the American Civil War, stating that God created the war to punish people for religious apostasy. In addition, the curriculum has been criticized for its depiction of racially segregated churches and schools. =Content= Science is presented in the ACE curriculum through the framework of Young Earth Creationism (YEC). For example, in Biology 1099, the existence of the Loch Ness monster is presented as a fact (as a plesiosaur), and used as a so-called proof against the theory of evolution. Textbooks published in Europe removed the Loch Ness monster reference in July 2013, but children are still only taught creationism as an explanation for the origin of life on earth. Textbooks used in the curriculum assert that abortion is wrong, evolution is false, and homosexuality is a choice. They teach that wives must be subservient to their husbands, women's liberation leads to child neglect and that one can avoid AIDS by being abstinent until marriage. The ACE curriculum in \\"Science 1096\\" asserts that solar fusion is a myth, describing it as \\"an invention of evolution scientists.\\" As of January 2017, there are 26 schools using the ACE curriculum registered in the United Kingdom. In October 2016, ten schools graded by British parliamentary education inspectors OFSTED were revisited following concerns of mistreatment raised in British press, nine of which were subsequently re-graded as 'inadequate' or 'requires improvement' by the watchdog. In 2018, a further ACE school in London was rated 'inadequate' for failing to teach adequate science and for not teaching children to ‚Ä≥develop the skills to collect and evaluate scientific evidence.\\" =Educational outcomes= In 2017, research into the International Certificate of Christian Education, the school-leaving qualification provided by ACE in the UK, claimed that it failed to prepare students for university level education. Professor Michael Reiss of University of London stated \\"My particular problem with ACE is the awful nature of the curriculum they provide to their students.\\" The study by Scaramanga and Reiss states that the curriculum fails students as it is heavily based around memorizing information rather than analyzing and understanding it. Having researched comparative performance on the American College Test between public school students from one school and ACE students from another private school in the same geographic area, one college student wrote in her thesis in 2005 that \\"a significant difference was found between the public school graduates' scores and the ACE graduates' scores in all areas of the ACT (English, Math, Reading, and Composite Score), except the area of Science Reasoning. Overall, the ACT scores of the ACE graduates were consistently lower than those of the public school students.\\" The author also noted that \\"the current study did not account for variables such as socioeconomic status, ethnicity, gender, or parent's level of education. These variables may impact ACT scores and therefore need to be considered in future research,\\" nor was demographic information of the public school used for comparison.http://mds.marshall.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1093&context;=etd Furthermore, the sample size of graduates from ACE was disproportionately small in this analysis. As of 2019, applicants who completed their Grade 12 or equivalent at the ACE (Accelerated Christian Education) School of Tomorrow may no longer be accepted to study at the University of South Africa.

The younger Ross Grimsley was a 1969 graduate of Frayser High School in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was an outstanding basketball and baseball player. He attended Jackson State Community College in Jackson, Tennessee. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the first round (17th pick) of the 1969 amateur draft (January Secondary). Major league career He made his major league debut for the Reds at age 21 on May 16, 1971 in a 9-3 loss to the Expos at Riverfront Stadium. He started and took the loss, pitched 1.2 innings and gave up three earned runs. The first major league hitter he faced was Ron Hunt. In 26 starts that year, he posted a record of 10-7 with a 3.57 ERA. He followed up with an even better season in 1972, going 14-8 with a 3.05 ERA for the National League champion Reds. He also had a strong World Series, going 2-1 in four games (three in relief) with a 2.57 ERA as the Reds fell to the Oakland Athletics in seven games. In 1973 he was 13-10 with a 3.23 ERA as the Reds won the NL West division. The Reds were well known for conservative appearance rules for its players. Flouting the team rules with long hair, he ran afoul of manager Sparky Anderson who requested after the 1973 season that Grimsley be traded.

Hadley Memorial Bridge (left) and the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge (right) The Mount Baker Tunnel or Mount Baker Ridge Tunnel carries Interstate 90 under the Mount Baker neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. It is actually a group of three tunnels that carry eight lanes of freeway traffic, plus a separate path for bicycles and pedestrians. The two originals are twin tunnel bores completed in 1940 and rehabilitated in 1993. The newest tunnel was built north of the original tunnels and opened in June 1989. The tunnel has a double-decked roadway with the bicycle/pedestrian path above the traffic lanes. The tunnel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 (ID #82004243). The east portals of the tunnel, with murals titled ' designed by artist James FitzGerald, along with the Lacey V. Murrow Bridge, are an official City of Seattle landmark.Landmarks Alphabetical Listing for L , Individual Landmarks, Department of Neighborhoods, City of Seattle. Accessed December 28, 2007. The official length is , though the perceived length while driving is closer to because of a cut-and-cover \\"lid\\" between the western portal and the beginning of the actual tunnel under the Mount Baker ridge. The former west portal, now located well inside the tunnel, is no longer discernible and its two arch structures were removed during 1989‚Äì1993 modification work. The eastern end of the tunnel links to the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge and the Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge (collectively the I-90 floating bridge) on Lake Washington, to Mercer Island. At in diameter, it is the world's largest diameter soft earth tunnel, having been bored through clay. Configuration =Original= When completed in 1940, the twin tunnels connected the I-90 floating bridge on Lake Washington and Rainier Avenue South in Seattle. The bridge and tunnels were part of US Highway 10, which used surface streets between the tunnels and downtown Seattle. US 10 was a four-lane, undivided highway. Each tunnel held two traffic lanes. The north tunnel normally carried two westbound lanes. The south tunnel normally carried two eastbound lanes. In the 1960s, a lane-use signal system was added to improve peak commute traffic. During peak commute times, the signals were used to make the center two lanes reversible. In the mornings, three lanes flowed west and one lane flowed east. In the evenings, three lanes flowed east and one lane flowed west. During morning and evening commutes, one tunnel carried two lanes of traffic in the same direction while the other tunnel carried opposing traffic separated only by dashed yellow lines. The highway would later become part of Interstate 90, be expanded, and upgraded to a controlled-access freeway. The freeway expansion and upgrade was completed in 1993. =1983‚Äì1993 expansion= The expansion included construction of a new, parallel tunnel with a larger diameter, located north of the original tunnel. Construction began in 1983. When the overall I-90 project was completed in 1993, the twin 1940 tunnels would be connected to the southern I-90 floating bridge (the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge) and carry eastbound traffic only, while the 1989 tunnel would be connected to the northern floating bridge (the then-new Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge) and be westbound-only for general traffic. The original pair of tunnels were each in diameter, while the new tunnel was in diameter. The new tunnel was built to carry traffic on three levels: two lanes for buses and carpools on the bottom level, three lanes of general traffic on the middle level, and cyclists and pedestrians on the top level. Excavation was completed in 1986, and the new tunnel opened to traffic in June 1989. Although designed to carry only westbound traffic, the new tunnel and then-new Homer Hadley Memorial Bridge temporarily carried all traffic ‚Äì in both directions ‚Äì when opened in 1989, while work continued on modifying the old Mercer Island Bridge where it connected to the 1940 Murrow Bridge and on rehabilitation of the latter. The new tunnel opened to westbound traffic on June 4, 1989, and to eastbound traffic on June 23. On the latter date, the old tunnel and floating bridge closed to all traffic, for renovation that was originally expected to take three years. When a long section of the Murrow Bridge sank during a storm in 1990, the reopening was delayed by about one year, until 1993. The former west portal in 1982. This afternoon-rush-hour view shows the reversible lanes in use, with one westbound lane and three eastbound. With the reopening of the Murrow Bridge in 1993, the older Mount Baker Ridge tunnel also reopened, with all of its lanes now eastbound-only. Instead of carrying two traffic lanes in each tunnel, the reconfigured lanes in the twin 1940 tunnels comprised two lanes of eastbound traffic in the northern tunnel and one lane of eastbound traffic in the southern tunnel, and with pedestrians no longer permitted (because of the exclusive pedestrian and bicycle facilities now provided in the parallel new tunnel). A second eastbound lane was later reinstated in the northern tunnel. The reversible lanes in the older tunnels had been separated only by painted lines on the roadway surface, but the reversible lanes on the rebuilt and expanded freeway (which use only the newer, 1989 tunnel) are separated by concrete barriers, to improve safety. The I-90 expansion project also effectively more than doubled the length of the Mt. Baker Tunnel. The west portal of the twin 1940 tunnels, which had been located near 29th Avenue South, was removed, and a concrete \\"lid\\" was built over the freeway, covering the section between the old west portal and west end of the lid, just west of 23rd Avenue South. However, officially the lid is not considered to be part of the tunnel, and a 1993 Historic American Engineering Record survey stated that the lengths of the two 1940 tunnels remain each. Inside the older tunnels, which had been arch-shaped, the ceiling and walls were made square, matching the shape of the \\"lidded\\" section. Equipment to boost radio reception was added. =Current= Eastern portal of 1989 tunnel Cross section of 1989 tunnel. Top to bottom: pedestrian and bicycle trail, westbound motor vehicle traffic, buses and carpools (now being converted to carry Link light rail, exclusively). Upon completion of the Interstate 90 expansion program in the 1990s, the freeway capacity increased to three general-purpose lanes in each direction and two reversible HOV lanes. Eastbound traffic uses the original tunnels. Westbound traffic uses the upper deck of the northern new tunnel. A two-lane reversible roadway uses the lower deck. The reversible roadway served as express lanes for transit buses and carpools (2+ people) during peak commute periods until 2017. The express lanes flowed westbound on weekday mornings and eastbound on weekday afternoons and evenings. On weekends, the express lanes were open; traffic direction was variable depending on anticipated traffic volumes. When the express lanes were open to eastbound traffic, single-occupant vehicles headed to Mercer Island are allowed to use the lanes per an inter-local agreement signed in 1976. Above the westbound traffic is the I-90 Trail tunnel. At , it is the longest non-adapted trail tunnel in the world. On the western half, the trail emerges onto the lid and uses trails in Lid Park. In 2017, the Washington State Department of Transportation added a pair of high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes) to Interstate 90 from Seattle to Bellevue, replacing the reversible express lanes. The express lanes were closed in June 2017 for the construction of the East Link light rail project, which will extend Link light rail service from Seattle to Bellevue and Redmond in 2023. On Mercer Island, WSDOT and Sound Transit are building direct access ramps to allow buses and HOVs to exit and enter I-90 from the HOV lanes.

The highway bridge is a dual three-lane controlled- access highway. It connects Ngau Hom Shek (), Hong Kong, to Dongjiaotou, which is administratively located in Nanshan District of Shenzhen. The corridor also had other components, a border checkpoint Shenzhen Bay Port, built on reclaimed land, as well as roads that connect the corridor to the existing road network of Shenzhen. The highway bridge is part of Route 10 of the Hong Kong trunk road numbering system, the only other existing part being the Kong Sham Western Highway, formerly known as Deep Bay Link. The Shenzhen section of the Corridor, was also included as the extension of the S3 since circa 2010. History and operation Hong Kong‚ÄìShenzhen Western Corridor is a cross border transport infrastructure which connects Hong Kong and Shenzhen. It was opened on 1 July 2007, the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Hong Kong as a special administrative region of China. According to the People's Daily as well as the China News Service, the corridor consists of three parts: a highway bridge which span from Hong Kong and across the boundary of Hong Kong and Shenzhen, Shenzhen Bay Port as a border checkpoint, which entirely inside the administrative boundary of Shenzhen, and roads that connected the corridor to the road network, the S3 However, departments and agencies of Hong Kong Government defined the bridge and port as separate items, and called the bridge as Hong Kong‚ÄìShenzhen Western Corridor or Shenzhen Bay Bridge. Shenzhen Bay Bridge was the gazetted name of the bridge. The construction project was included in the Shenzhen municipal government's 10th Five Year Plan, which was announced in 2001. According to Shenzhen, the infrastructure was said to be planned since 1996. The cross border highway was also included in a feasibility study of the Hong Kong Government. The study was completed in 2001, and proposed to built the Hong Kong‚ÄìShenzhen Western Corridor and Deep Bay Link, as the fourth land boundary crossing. The other three land boundary crossings were Lok Ma Chau, Man Kam To and Sha Tau Kok respectively. In December 2002, the State Council (the Central Government) approved the plan of the route, which was submitted by Shenzhen. On 8 March 2002, the Finance Committee (FC) of the Hong Kong Legislative Council approved the funding of the design and site investigation for the Hong Kong section of the Corridor; the funding of the construction works of the Hong Kong section, which was estimated for HK$3.2 billion in money-of-the-day (MOD) price, was approved along with the funding of the Deep Day Link on 21 February 2003. The constriction cost of the latter was estimated for HK$4.6 billion in MOD price. The funding of the Hong Kong Port Area, which was estimated for HK$2.5 billion in MOD prices, was approved by the FC on 18 July 2003. The Shenzhen sections was mainly funded by the Shenzhen municipal government, despite the central government also endorsed RMB 0.2 billion. Construction of the project including the land reclamation, began on 28 August 2003 in Shenzhen, while the construction of the Shenzhen Bay Port building began in 2004. The main contractor of the construction of the Hong Kong section of the highway bridge, was a joint venture of Gammon, Skanska and China Railway Major Bridge Engineering Company (MBEC). Gammon Construction, at that time known as Gammon‚ÄìSkanska Limited (Skanska was a co-owner of Gammon at that time), also won the contract to build the related infrastructure, the northern section of Kong Sham Western Highway, which known at that time as Deep Bay Link. The southern section would be built by another venture led by China State Construction. Hong Kong government also entrusted Shenzhen‚ÄìHong Kong Western Corridor Project Office to build the facilities of the Shenzhen Bay Port Hong Kong Port Area in 2004. Shenzhen Bay Port was entirely within the boundary of Shenzhen. In 2001, Hong Kong Government agreed in principle of co-locating the boundary crossing facilities, thus the birth of Shenzhen Bay Port Hong Kong Port Area. Shenzhen‚ÄìHong Kong Western Corridor Project Office, a government agency, was responsible to build all the facilities within the Shenzhen boundary. Some of the construction was sub-contracted to other firms, such as Hsin Chong‚ÄìAster was responsible for the electrical and mechanical engineering of the Passenger Terminal Building (Hong Kong Side) of the Hong Kong Port Area. However, a scandal was exposed in 2015, which the facilities built by Shenzhen‚ÄìHong Kong Western Corridor Project Office (excluding Hong Kong Port Area) were over-budgeted from the original estimate RMB 2.4 billion, some items were purchased without open tender, as well as embezzle of public funds. Other controversies were exposed in 2005 on the approval of the project, which Shenzhen municipal government excluded the connection road of the corridor, as well as living quarter of the Shenzhen Port Area, from the submission to the State Council, despite departments of the government included them in the advertisements. As well as around the legitimacy of the approval in the sense of environmental protection law. According to the news report, the connection roads were not constructed by Shenzhen‚ÄìHong Kong Western Corridor Project Office, and the legal advisor of the municipal government denied any wrongdoing of the project in an interview. The bridge was constructed separately between Hong Kong and Shenzhen governments. It use the maritime border of the two cities as the point of separation. Upon its opening, along with the Shenzhen Bay Port Hong Kong Port Area, were leased to Hong Kong and made under Hong Kong's jurisdiction for an initial period until 30 June 2047. Hong Kong also responsible to the maintenance and day to day operation of the Shenzhen section of the bridge. As such, Hong Kong laws, including traffic laws, instead of the laws of Mainland China, apply on the whole bridge and within the Hong Kong Port Area. The , Hong Kong section was completed in 2005. The corridor was scheduled for completion in 2006 but owing to the delay in the construction of the Shenzhen section , it was officially opened on 1 July 2007 by then-President and Communist Party general secretary Hu Jintao of China and the then-Chief Executive of Hong Kong Donald Tsang. It can handle 58,600 vehicles and 60,000 cross-boundary tourists per day. The border crossing facilities in Dongjiaotou are separately managed by the Customs and Excise Department and Immigration Department of Hong Kong, and the China Customs. Mainland and Hong Kong Immigration co-location The Hong Kong Government has to pay rent to Shenzhen government for the use of the port area, amounting to RMB 6 million per year. The rental agreement lasts until 30 June 2047. Transport Four Hong Kong public bus routes run on this corridor. They are operated by the New Lantao Bus Company and Citybus. * B2 to and from Yuen Long * B2P to and from Tin Shui Wai * B3 and B3A to and from various location of Tuen Mun * B3X to and from Tuen Mun (express service) A green public light bus route, 618, also operates from Tin Shui Wai new town. Hong Kong taxis, minibuses and cross-border buses are allowed access to the corridor; private vehicles must have the correct permit to use the corridor.

Early life and ancestry  Frank McIntyre was born to Dennis and Mary Gaughan McIntyre in Montgomery, Alabama. He had three brothers, James, John, and Cornelius Patrick, and four sisters, Mary, Catherine, Ellen, and Nora. Dennis McIntyre came to America in the 1850s and was a railroad car inspector for the West Point and Alabama Railroad. He settled first in Georgia, where he met his wife, and the family had moved to Alabama by 1860, when they are listed in census records. Dennis is listed on the roster of the Montgomery County Home Guard, CSA, in 1864. His wife Mary was originally from Crossmolina, County Mayo, where many Gaughans reside. She moved to Georgia in the 1850s to join her brother, Patrick Gaughan. Patrick later moved to Camden, Arkansas. He enlisted in the 33rd Arkansas Infantry Regiment, CSA, in 1863. The surname McIntyre is a Scottish Highland name (also spelled MacIntyre) that means \\"son of the carpenter\\" or wright. The Gaelic original is Mac an-T Saoir. McIntyres were originally to be found in Lorne where they possessed the lands of Glenoe from the 13th century until the early 19th century. According to family tradition, the MacIntyres/McIntyres came originally from the Hebrides. In the 13th century, they sailed from their ancestral home carrying a white cow, and settled on the mainland at Glen Noe by Ben Cruachan. On the mainland the MacIntyres/McIntyres were hereditary foresters to the lords of Lorne. For many years, they paid the Campbells of Glenorchy a symbolic rent of a white calf and a snowball for their Glen Noe lands. During the 18th century, the rent was commuted to cash, then progressively raised. Donald, the 4th MacIntyre chief, could not pay so he emigrated to Canada. His brother and successor Captain Donald MacIntyre the fifth chief, tried but failed to make ends meet and the Glen Noe lands were lost two hundred years ago, in 1808. The present Clan Chief is Donald MacIntyre of Glenoe. Frank McIntyre was a grandson of James and Norah McIntyre of The Brockey, Killybegs, County Donegal, Ireland. His grandmother was Norah Cannon, the daughter of Dennis and Jane Cannon (n√©e McBraerty) of Killybegs, County Donegal. Her sister Mary Cannon married Thomas Murrin of Croaghlin (1804‚Äì1882) Banagh barony, Killybegs, County Donegal, their daughter Jane Murrin (1829‚Äì1903) married Charles Dawson Lea (1819‚Äì1883) in 1851. Their son John Edward Dawson Lea (1859‚Äì1929) married Hannora McIntyre his cousin, who died on 10 October 1938. John and Hannorah lived at Rathmines, Dublin, and Aileach House, Killybegs, County Donegal, where his cousin and sister-in-law Agnes McIntyre also lived and where she died on 5 February 1990, aged 92. Agnes and Hannorah McIntyre were first cousins of General Frank McIntyre and Judge Patrick McIntyre. On the distaff side their first cousin was S√©amus Hegarty, D.D. an Irish Roman Catholic prelate, who served as Bishop of Raphoe from 1982 to 1994, then as Bishop of Derry from 1994 to 2011. Agnes and Hannorah were the daughters of John and Mary McIntyre n√©e Carr, and like Frank the grandchildren of James and Nora McIntyre, Nora being a Cannon. The Cannons are descended from two of Ireland's most renowned Kings: Conn of the Hundred Battles and Niall of the Nine Hostages. The O'Cannons have been described as \\"Ancient Princes of Tir Connaill\\" and \\"Valiant Chiefs\\". However their 350-year dynasty in Tir Connaill ended in 1250. Their ancient territory would seem to have been Tir Aeda (now the barony of Tirhigh) after the deaths of Rory O' Canannain and his son Niall O'Canannain in 1250, the sept declined greatly in power. Brian O'Neill died ten years later in 1260, he had supported an O'Canannain claimant to Tir Conaill i.e. to the Kingdom of Tir Conaill (Tirconnell). The personal name Canannain is a diminutive of Cano meaning 'wolf cub'. Canannain was fifth in descent from Flaithbertach mac Loingsig (died 765), high-king of Ireland; they were the descendants of Neill of the Nine Hostages (Irish: Niall Noigiallach) who died c. 405 by his son, Conall Gulban who gave his name to Tir Conaill, the Land of Conall, now County Donegal. Ui Canannain was the ancestral name of the Cannons and Tir Connaill (all of County Donegal and part of County Londonderry) was the \\"Land of the Cannons\\". By the early 17th century the name Ui Canannain had been anglicised to O'Cannon. Further anglicisation took place during the Penal laws in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and the name in County Donegal became Cannon. In the early 1880s, there were just 200 families bearing the Cannon surname living in County Donegal, who were mainly tenant farmers. The Cannons/O'Canannains, were of the ancient sept of Cenell Conaill, a branch of the northern Ui Neill and descend from Ruaidri ua Canannain (died 30 November 950) King of Cenel Conaill, and grandson of Canannain, who flourished in the second half of the 9th century. One of Neill's most famous descendants was George Washington, the first President of the United States of America. The site of the ancient seat of the O'Canannains was near Letterkenny the largest town of County Donegal, which is said on good authority to represent the hillside of the O'Cannons (English translation). Education  Frank McIntyre was educated in public and private schools in Montgomery and at The University of Alabama from 1880 to 1882. While a student in Tuscaloosa, his professors noted his talents and recommended him for his home district's vacancy to West Point. McIntyre successfully passed a competitive examination and was enrolled at the United States Military Academy in the Fall of 1882. The son of Irish immigrants never forgot his roots. In a 1938 letter to his classmates at West Point, McIntyre reflected \\"I can never forget the unsolicited kindness of these professors at the University [of Alabama] to a young boy without influence and with not the slightest obligation on their part. Their action reflects one phase of the spirit of Alabama. How could I forget it?\\" McIntyre graduated from West Point in 1886, ranked tenth in his class. A classmate and roommate of McIntyre was General John J. Pershing. Military career  Major General McIntyre in early 1919 McIntyre entered the United States army as a second lieutenant in the 19th Infantry, serving in various ranks until he attained that of brigadier-general in 1912. He saw duty at different posts, chiefly on the Mexican border, until the war with Spain, in which he participated in the Puerto Rico Campaign in 1898. McIntyre served in the Philippines from 1899 to 1902, after which he served with the general staff. 1924 Philippine one peso note, approved by McIntyre. McIntyre was attached to the Bureau of Insular Affairs in 1905 and became its Chief in 1912, relieving General Clarence Ransom Edwards. During the War in Europe, he was assistant chief of staff with the rank of major- general. McIntyre served as long-time Chief of the Bureau of Insular Affairs and played a significant role in the governance of the Philippines and Puerto Rico throughout this period. With respect to Puerto Rico, McIntyre wavered on the wisdom of granting United States citizenship to Puerto Ricans but ultimately supported the Jones‚ÄìShafroth Act of 1917. At times, McIntyre had strained relations with other officials in Puerto Rico, such as U.S. District Judge and fellow Alabama nativePeter J. Hamilton during the 1910s and Governor E. Mont Reily during the 1920s. In his 2007 book Planting the American Flag: Twelve Men Who Expanded the United States Overseas, author Peter C. Stuart devoted an entire chapter to the career of Gen. McIntyre and his leadership of the Bureau of Insular Affairs. With respect to McIntyre's administration of the Philippines and Puerto Rico, Stuart noted \\" While others more assertive or egoistic imprinted on the protectorates their personal marks, McIntyre left no memorial....yet he wielded perhaps greater sway upon the United States' little empire than all his more visible imperial colleagues.\\" Stuart credits Gen. McIntyre's stewardship over the Bureau of Insular Affairs as having been critical to its survival, and noting that within a decade following his retirement the Bureau was turned over to the Department of the Interior and disbanded in 1939. Reflecting upon the Bureau's demise, Stuart noted \\"An era of American imperial administration--in many ways the McIntyre era--had ended.\\" McIntyre retired from the Army in 1929. In retirement  Following retirement Gen. McIntyre served for several years as the Philippine trade commissioner in Washington and lived on Massachusetts Avenue. In this role he lobbied on behalf of the islands' interests. He later purchased and maintained a home in Montgomery, Alabama on South Hull Street, from which he helped oversee the large plantation, cotton business, and real estate interests of his older brothers Jim and John McIntyre, who established McIntyre Brothers in 1878. The main plantation, named Killybegs after the ancestral hometown, is located in Ramer, Montgomery County, Alabama. Formerly 7600 acres, over 1500 acres remain in the McIntyre family as of 2019. Personal life He was married in 1892 in Dallas to the former Marie Dennett, a native of New Orleans who grew up primarily in Texas. Marie Dennett was the daughter of James Wilson Dennett (1831-1888) a native of Huntsville, Alabama and Marie Dufilho Dennett, who was from an old New Orleans Creole family. James Dennett was an assistant quartermaster for the Confederacy in New Orleans prior to the Federals taking the city in 1862. Marie's great grandfather Christoval Toledano (1790-1869) was a sugar merchant and the son of Don Manuel Toledano y Valenzuela (1763-1806), a Spanish military official who arrived in New Orleans in the 1790s. Christoval served in Plauche's Battalion in the War of 1812 and fought at the Battle of New Orleans. The McIntyres were the parents of six children, who grew up primarily in Washington, DC: Frank Jr. James, Edward, Margaret, Marie, and Nora. James continued the military tradition established by his father and retired as a major general in the United States Air Force. He served as the legislative liaison for the Air Force to Congress in the late 1940s, and is credited with helping establish the Air Force as an independent branch of the military through his efforts to help pass the National Security Act of 1947. McIntyre's descendants include great grandsons David and Tom Gardner, co-founders of The Motley Fool, and great granddaughter Georgena Terry,a bicycle designer who founded Terry Bicycles. Awards  McIntyre awards and decorations included the French Legion of Honour, and invested as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath from Great Britain, and the Army Distinguished Service Medal. Death and legacy  He died on February 16, 1944 at age 78, while on a vacation trip to Miami Beach, Florida. McIntyre was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

In October, after further specialized training, she commenced training sonar technicians. Employed primarily as a schoolship throughout 1965, she also tested new anti-submarine warfare (ASW) weapons systems for the Operational Test and Evaluation Force. During this period she enhanced her training and testing capabilities as well as her operational abilities by participating in joint United States-Canadian exercises in the spring and fall and in ASW exercises at the end of the year. In 1966 cruises saw her in the Bermuda area for NATO exercises (April); off the New England and Virginia coasts for convoy escort and ASW exercises (June, July, and August); and in the Caribbean for fleet tactical exercises (November‚ÄìDecember).

She got underway again in March and sailed south, the next month, for refresher training at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Returning to Newport in June, she departed again 8 July for another extended cruise. On 11 July she arrived at San Juan, Puerto Rico where she joined naval units of the United States, Brazil, and Colombia for UNITAS IX. On 15 July, they commenced a clockwise circumnavigation of South America which first involved ships and planes of eight nations in exercises in the Atlantic, then around the Horn to the Pacific for more of the same, and finally through the Panama Canal back into the Caribbean before the end of the year.

During this time frame, her Passive Anti-Submarine Towed Array Sonar Surveillance System (TASS) proved highly capable and successful in extensive tracking of submarines. McCloy returned to her home port in Norfolk, Virginia in June 1981 only to be sent to sea again on short notice to conduct additional Special ASW operations in the Bermuda \\"Box\\". McCloy departed Norfolk for another Mediterranean Deployment (MED 5‚Äì82) from July to December 1982. Using her primary weapon system, her TASS passive sonar system (a system of passive hydrophones towed behind the ship), she was immediately assigned to tracking of Soviet submarines in the Mediterranean. Additionally in September 1982, McCloy was stationed at the entrance to Beirut, Lebanon harbor where an active conflict was ongoing between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). She was assigned and completed the escort of nine ships used in the United Nations-arranged PLO evacuation from Beirut, escorting the ships to safe haven ports in the Mediterranean. McCloy received a Meritorious Unit Commendation (MUC) for unsurpassed ASW accomplishments from 8 June to 22 December 1982 during this deployment. She also received the Sixth Fleet \\"Hook Em\\" Award and was designated as the Best ASW Ship in the Atlantic Fleet during the period 1 October 1980 to 31 March 1982 by Commander Naval Surface Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet.

Operational history In mid-October 1967, Richard L. Page moved from Boston to her homeport of Naval Station Newport, Rhode Island, then sailed south for shakedown exercises in the Caribbean. On 21 December 1967, she returned to Newport and, after post-shakedown availability, began operations with Escort Squadron SIX (CORTRON 6). Into 1968, she operated in the western Atlantic and, in the fall, she deployed to the Mediterranean for duty with the 6th Fleet. On that duty until 10 February 1969, she returned to Newport on 18 February and in March 1969 resumed operations with the 2nd Fleet. On 1 July 1969, she relieved as flagship of Destroyer Division ONE TWO(DESRON 12), then conducted exercises in the Caribbean. Richard L. Page spent all of 1971 and the first eight months of 1972 in port at Newport and in operations along the east coast of the United States and in the Caribbean. In mid-August 1972, she steamed out of Newport, bound for an extended deployment with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. From 1973 to 1975, she was forward deployed to Athens, Greece, and on 30 June 1975 she was reclassified as a guided missile frigate with the new hull number of FFG-5. Returning from Europe, Richard L. Page underwent a year-long modernization overhaul, returning to the Atlantic Fleet and a new homeport of Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia in 1976. Over the next four years, she repeatedly deployed to the Mediterranean, Middle East, the eastern coast of Africa, and Northern Europe, interspersed with brief periods in her stateside homeport of Norfolk. During this same four year period, in 1979, Richard L. Page was the recipient of both the Battle Efficiency \\"E\\" that year from Commander, Naval Surface Force Atlantic, designating her as the best guided missile frigate among all guided missile frigates in the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, and the Battenberg Cup, designating her as the surface warship with the highest operational excellence of any warship in the entire U.S. Atlantic Fleet. In early 1980, she temporarily relocated to Philadelphia Naval Shipyard where she received various sonar and electronic warfare system upgrades before returning to the Fleet in August 1980. She then completed independent operations in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic, and following completion of Refresher Training (REFTRA) at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, returned to Norfolk to participate in Exercise SOLID SHIELD 81. During the rest of 1981, she operated as a unit of Standing NATO Maritime Group 1Standing Naval Force Atlantic . Deploying in late 1983, she joined the carrier battle group, deploying to both the Mediterranean, where she supported both the U.S. 6th Fleet and multinational peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, and to the North Atlantic and Norway as part of Cold War operations as a deterrent force to the Red Banner Northern Fleet of the Soviet Navy. Following her return to Norfolk in 1984, Richard L. Page underwent another yard period overhaul at Bath Iron Works in Maine before returning to the Fleet from 1986. In 1987, with the acquisition of the newer Oliver Hazard Perry class guided missile frigates nearly complete, a decision was made to retire the entire Brooke class of frigates from the U.S. Navy in 1988 and 1989 and earmark them for transfer to a foreign navy. Fate Richard L. Page remained in U.S. naval service until decommissioned on 30 September 1988. Earlier, in 1982, the Reagan administration approved a US$3.2 billion military and economic aid package to Pakistan. As part of that package, Pakistan acquired Richard L. Page on a five-year lease in 1989. On 31 March 1989, she was leased to Pakistan, recommissioned in the Pakistani Navy and renamed PNS Tabuk (D-163). However, as a result of the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 1989, President George H. W. Bush was advised a few months later to no longer certify that Pakistan was not involved in the development of nuclear weapons in accordance with the Pressler Amendment, which banned most economic and military assistance to Pakistan unless the President certified on an annual basis that \\"Pakistan does not possess a nuclear explosive device and that the proposed United States assistance program will reduce significantly the risk that Pakistan will possess a nuclear explosive device.\\" The Pressler Amendment was subsequently invoked on 1 October 1990. The lease of the ship expired in March 1994 and she was returned to United States control that same month. As a result, the ship was struck from the Navy Vessel Register on 12 January 1994 and transferred to the Maritime Administration (MARAD) for disposal on 28 March 1994. On 29 March 1994, the ex-Richard L. Page was returned to the U.S. Navy, acting as executive agent for the MARAD, at Singapore and sold to Trusha Investments Pte. Ltd. c/o Jacques Pierot, Jr. & Sons Inc., New York City, N.Y. for $626,850.00 for eventual scrapping. Awards During her service with the U.S. Navy, Richard L. Page was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation, the Meritorious Unit Commendation with 1 bronze star (2 awards), the Navy E Ribbon (2 awards), the Navy Expeditionary Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and the Navy Sea Service Deployment Ribbon.

Pain was best known for his time in Combat Zone Wrestling, as well as Xtreme Pro Wrestling and Pro Wrestling Unplugged. He held numerous titles in his CZW stint and was the real life brother of CZW wrestler and one-time tag team partner Nick Gage. Career Justice Pain was trained by John Zandig at the CZW Wrestling School. He began his career as one of the main wrestlers in the company along with other graduates from the school, such as Lobo and Nick Gage. Pain feuded with Lobo, and wrestled him at the first ever Cage of Death in the first ever Cage of Death match. Pain won the match and defeated Lobo for the CZW Iron Man Championship. Justice Pain would also compete against Lobo in the Cage of Death at Cage of Death II and defeated him for the CZW Heavyweight Championship. Justice Pain was well known for forming the original H8 Club with Wifebeater. While still holding the heavyweight championship, Justice Pain also won the tag team championship with Wifebeater. Around this time, a new H8 Club was formed with Nick Gage and Nate Hatred. This new team defeated Justice Pain and Wifebeater for the tag championship. After losing the titles, Justice Pain began teaming with The Backseat Boyz and started a feud with Wifebeater. The feud ended at Cage of Death III where Pain defeated Wifebeater in the Cage of Death. Justice Pain continued feuding with Nick Gage and Nate Hatred, but left CZW in 2003 to join Xtreme Pro Wrestling. During his tenure in Xtreme Pro Wrestling (XPW) he feuded with Chris Candido, defeating Candido twice with the final bout being on the last show in the history of XPW. When he returned in 2004, he reformed the H8 Club with Wifebeater. They teamed up to face Nick Gage and Nate Hatred at Cage of Death VI with the winners having the right to call themselves the H8 Club. At the end of the match, Nick Gage turned on Nate Hatred and allowed Justice Pain to pin Hatred. After this, Pain turned on Wifebeater and joined his real life brother as the new H8 Club. They won the tag team titles by defeating Team Cash in February 2005. At the end of 2005, Justice Pain once again competed in the Cage of Death match and came out on the winning side with partners Zandig and Nick Gage. That night, Lobo returned and joined them as well. During the next months, Pain teamed up with Nick Gage, Zandig, Lobo, and Dewey Donovan as The Forefathers of CZW. The Forefathers would later break up due to problems between Gage, Zandig, and Lobo. At Night of Infamy V, Justice Pain got a shot at Eddie Kingston for the world title, but did not win. Due to interference in the match, Pain was granted another shot at Cage of Death 8 in a triple threat elimination match which also included Chris Hero. Pain eliminated Kingston by submission after Kingston's ankle was severely injured early in the match. After hitting Hero with the Pain Thriller, Justice Pain pinned him to win the title for a fifth time. Pain retired in 2007 at the premature age of 29.

Techniques Major categories of jujutsu techniques include, but are not limited to: joint locks, chokeholds, strikes, grappling, throwing and takedowns. =Joint locks= Joint locks can be applied on anything that bends, such as fingers, wrists, elbows, shoulders or knees. Application of locks might include gaining purchase for throwing techniques, encouraging cooperation, submission, or restraining an aggressor. (Such techniques are taught to police forces.) Locks can also be utilised for interrogation/torture or controlling a prisoner prior to securing him using rope. In modern sporting contests, bouts are often concluded upon a submission resulting from a successful joint lock. =Chokeholds= Chokeholds including gi-chokes/strangulations (with the lapel), and no-gi. Used primarily to kill or knock unconscious. In combat, a choking technique might permanently dissociate the windpipe from the ligament supporting it, causing death by asphyxiation. Strangulation techniques may also be used for non-lethal subduing of an opponent. Fully blocking the bloodflow to the brain will knock an opponent unconscious in 3 to 7 seconds.Ohlenkamp, N (2019) Different Chokes for Different Folks (Blog) in: To kill by strangulation would take just over a minute before brain death occurs. In modern competition, chokes are normally banned (although they are permitted in judo competition). Strangulation is more popular in competition as they can be applied without fatal consequence, so full leverage can be applied to aid restraining of the competitor. In Jujutsu, there are many counters to choking or strangling attacks. This may have contributed to Jujutsu's popularity in self-defence applications. =Strikes= Strikes are generally taught, though the specific strike preferences vary by system. In Jujutsu, all known striking techniques are available as tools; nothing is excluded by doctrine. It is the application of those tools that distinguishes different systems of Jujutsu. Jujutsu emphasises the control of an opponent's balance, and therefore most systems of Jujutsu do not advocate any kicks targeted above the Celiac plexus. Atemi is the art of striking pressure points or physiological targets for kuzushi (breaking balance) or to incapacitate an opponent. Atemi is the art of striking the human body in order to cause specific physiological effect for various applications. The term \\"atemi\\" is sometimes applied to any technique whose primary purpose is to distract an opponent, setting the opponent up for another technique. =Grappling= Grappling techniques are also common. Simple grappling was incorporated into early Jujutsu systems for use in combat. More elaborate grappling techniques and strategies were likely developed for use in sporting contests in the ancient world. Such techniques have been re-introduced into the Japanese martial arts in post-reformation systems such as Judo and related Brazilian jiu-jitsu systems. In post- reformation Japan, Japanese martial arts were altered under the auspices of Kan≈ç Jigor≈ç and his contemporaries. The emphasis on Samurai combat skills was degraded in preference to systems that could be practiced by anyone of any age for healthy physical education, sport and self-defense. Because of this new emphasis, grappling skills have been adapted to safe sporting environments, where gouging, biting, and other unsporting techniques are banned. Only a few schools maintain the old samurai grappling techniques and training practices. The majority of schools utilise Judo training or a more combative form of grappling. =Throwing= =Takedowns= Takedown is a term for a technique that involves off-balancing an opponent and bringing him or her to the ground, typically with the combatant performing the takedown landing on top. Takedowns are usually distinguished from throws by the forward motion and target of advancement (typically the legs), although in some systems of terminology, throwing techniques are a type of takedown. Application There are differences in application of the same technique between styles of Jujutsu that range from the minor to the major. =Rolling= When performing a forward shoulder roll, some styles roll on the back of the lead-hand (i.e., palm up), and some roll palm-down. While performing a backward shoulder roll, land on your far side hip, palm down. =Wrist locks= Some styles perform wrist locks (or, \\"peels\\") with the bottom 3 fingers and don't use the index finger, and some use the top 3 fingers keep the pinky off. The intent of both approaches is the same: do not block the opponent's wrist during a peel. =Ankle Locks= =Arm bars= Some styles advocate using \\"live hand\\" (hand open) for an armbar takedown, whereas some advocate making a fist. Adherents of each approach claim \\"more power\\", though the closed-fist approach arguably offers the additional benefit of reducing the possibility of a finger getting accidentally snagged. =Knee Bars= =Throws= On a hip throw off the right hip (for example), the most common way this throw is taught is to grab the uke's right arm with the left hand. Some styles, however, teach \\"wrapping\\" the uke's right arm with the left instead of the grab. Biomechanically, the most effective method is to grab the right upper arm using a monkey style grip. Using this method, one grips the opponent's left arm using the 4 fingers and the thumb against the palm, (instead of gripping with the thumb against the 4 fingers). The reason for using this grip rather than a normal human gripping action is that the thumb gripping against the 4 fingers is weaker in strength than the grip applied by the 4 fingers and thumb against the palm (as monkeys do when gripping the branch of a tree to swing). Grabbing the upper arm rather than the wrist allows the body greater pulling torque. Likewise, on hip throws, some systems grab around the waist (or in ignorance, the belt), and some systems prefer to wrap tori‚Äôs right arm under the uke's left. One should never grip the opponent‚Äôs belt; modern attire may not include a belt. In fact, grabbing the belt is not necessary. Simply grabbing around the waist (so long as the grip is all the way around the waist) works better anyway. One should note that it feels easier to grab your opponent‚Äôs waist with your right arm than it does wrapping your right arm around their left arm. Biomechanically, grabbing the opponent higher up the back (such as at the shoulder) can allow the opponent to bend at the waist making the hip throw more difficult. The sequence of actions required for the hip throw is: block, parry or deflect the opponent's punch if necessary, effect kuzushi, bend the knees and turn whilst pulling the opponent over your hip. =Grappling= The biggest conceptual difference is when grappling is taught, whether a style views grappling as a sport, or grappling as a necessity of balanced self- defense training (or both). Both applications have merit, and the training will have a considerable amount of overlap, but will also have important differences. The latter approach will need to understand the fundamentals of the grappling positional hierarchy like the former, but the priority will be to get off the ground (and get away) as fast as possible. It is also a very good technique to use when near an opponent.

In 1929 and 1930, the South African Railways placed eight Garratt articulated steam locomotives with a 4-8-2+2-8-4 Double Mountain type wheel arrangement in service. Built at Beyer, Peacock and Company's Gorton Foundry, they were originally designed to work on the Durban to Cato Ridge section of the Natal mainline. The Class GL was eventually displaced to the route between Glencoe and Vryheid before spending their final working years operating on the line from Stanger to Empangeni.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1946). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VII - South African Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, February 1946. pp. 133-134.Soul of A Railway, System 6, Part 5: The New Main Line from Rossburgh to Pietermaritzburg compiled by Les Pivnic. Introduction, Captions 3-5. (Accessed on 26 August 2017) Origin The Class GL had its origin in the steady increase in loads experienced by the Natal mainline in the years prior to the First World War. The old Natal mainline had gradients of 1 in 30 (3‚Öì%) whilst the newer line, relocated to provide an easier route, still had of near-uninterrupted 1 in 66 (1¬Ω%) gradients. Moreover, the tight curvature of the line with curves of as little as radius precluded the use of large, long wheelbased, non-articulated locomotives and restricted them to a coupled wheelbase of . These factors combined with ever-increasing train weights ensured that the line rapidly became a bottleneck.Durrant, A.E. (1981). Garratt Locomotives of the World. David & Charles. pp. 126-127. . The decision to electrify the line from Glencoe Junction to Durban had been taken in 1914, coincidentally the year in which the South African Railways (SAR) ordered its first Cape gauge Garratt, the Class GA . Electrification was placed in abeyance along with the delivery of the Class GA until the end of the First World War. Despite this delay, the process of electrification began in earnest in 1922 and by 1926 full electrified haulage had been instituted between Glencoe and Pietermaritzburg, with lashups of three electric locomotives being used on the heaviest freights. These trains were then hauled onward to Durban by a pair of Class 14 4-8-2 steam locomotives. The success of the Class GA Garratt in proving the suitability of the Garratt design for South African conditions coupled with the economies in crew, fuel and water consumption it offered, provided an incentive for the SAR to consider a new Garratt class for use on the Natal mainline. The aim was to eliminate double-heading as a regular practice with such a locomotive to be equivalent to three of the Class 1E electric locomotives which were then in use, or two Class 14 steam locomotives. Manufacturer Colonel F.R. Collins DSO, the Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the SAR from 1922 to 1929, prepared the specifications and the contract for the design and construction of these locomotives, the Class GL, was awarded to Beyer, Peacock and Company (BP). The locomotive was to be approximately equal to two Class 14 locomotives in power output with a maximum permitted axle loading of owing to the use of rail on both sections of the mainline, and a maximum all-up weight of . Since these locomotives would be some 48% larger and more powerful than any locomotive previously employed on the SAR and up to twice the track gauge in width, the initial order was for two prototype locomotives only, with more to follow should they prove successful. They were delivered in September 1929 and were erected in the Durban shops, numbered 2350 and 2351, and placed in service in October. They proved to be so successful that the remaining six locomotives were quickly ordered for delivery in 1930. These six entered service in July 1930, numbered in the range from 2352 to 2357.South African Railways and Harbours Locomotive Diagram Book, 2'0\\" & 3'6\\" Gauge Steam Locomotives, 15 August 1941, as amended Trials At the time, they were the most powerful steam locomotives to be placed in service anywhere in the Southern Hemisphere and attained the objective of constructing a locomotive to approximately equal the power output of two Class 14 locomotives. Bishop, Natal Locomotive Superintendent, took part in the design process and successfully carried out the initial tests. On their first test run, despite the cut-off on these locomotives being limited to 65%, were hauled from Durban to Cato Ridge in 163 minutes, compared to in 184 minutes for a Class 14. Moreover, this was achieved on half throttle and with the cut-off set at 45%. This suggested that the Class GL had still more to give, which was confirmed on the following day's testing when a load of was hauled over the same stretch of track. As a result of these tests, the further six Class GL locomotives were ordered for delivery in 1930. Apart from demonstrating the Class GL's power and capacity for hauling heavy trains, these tests also showed that their running qualities were exceptional, being smooth and free-running machines. In many ways, the Class GL set a design standard which was followed later in the Class GM, Class GMA and Class GO. Characteristics The Class GL embodied comparatively few features of any particular novelty. Instead, they were designed to make the best possible use of existing technologies to produce a locomotive of great power, efficiency and reliability. Their all-up weight of coupled with their axle loading closely matched the limits laid down by the SAR and was considered by Lionel Wiener, author of Articulated Locomotives, to show \\"such mastery in general and detail design that we have pleasure on congratulating Messrs. Beyer, Peacock & Co. on this achievement.\\" Their tractive effort of at 75% of boiler pressure remained the highest of any locomotive on the SAR for the duration of the steam era.Wiener, L. (1970). Articulated Locomotives. Kalmbach. =Frame= The main frames were thick cut bar frames. On the SAR, the bar frame had previously only been employed on the German-built Class GCA 2-6-2+2-6-2 Garratt. =Valves and cylinders= The Class GL made use of Beyer, Peacock's standard lever-actuated Sterling-type steam-operated power reverser and a Pyle National Company turbo-generator. The piston valves were modern straight-ported types with long-lap, long-travel valves, used for the first time in a South African Garratt which made the Class GL very free- running and more efficient than its predecessors. The cylinders, of the same bore and stroke as those of the Class 14, drove the third coupled axles using long connecting rods which stabilised the locomotive by reducing vertical forces at the crosshead to a minimum. This method of design became the standard on most Beyer-Garratts thereafter. =Pivots= To allow for the tight curves, including radius bends with superelevation without any intermediate tangent and the steep, twisting nature of the line, the front engine unit's pivot bearing was spherical, with its alignment controlled by sprung rollers. The rear pivot was the usual Beyer, Peacock flat adjustable type. =Boiler and firebox= The boiler was of exceptional size with an inside diameter of , double the track gauge. It used a top feed and contained 263 small tubes of outside diameter and 50 large tubes of outside diameter, while the superheater elements were of diameter. The round-topped firebox with its grate area was fired by a duplex mechanical stoker, the only class on the SAR which had this feature. The firebox contained two Nicholson thermic syphons and two arch tubes. Clyde Superior soot blowers were fitted on each side of the firebox. Beyer, Peacock estimated the Class GL locomotive's economical coal consumption rate at per hour. Detail of the power reverser (left) and Pyle National Company turbo-generator (right) on no. 2352 The Class GL had a rocking grate and self-cleaning hopper ashpan with water and steam sprayers to dampen down the ash to prevent it from entering axle boxes, motion areas and other friction-sensitive places. They had self-cleaning type smokeboxes and their axle boxes were grease-lubricated. =Crew comfort= The locomotives were equipped with a Sturtevant powered fan blower to supply fresh air to the cab, sucked from ahead of the chimney and driven by a steam turbine in deference to the eleven tunnels on this section which totalled to almost , the longest being the Shongweni tunnel at . This proved less than satisfactory, as did the smoke deflecting cowls over the chimneys of the second batch of locomotives. These cowls were controlled by steam-operated cylinders and, when not required, could be withdrawn longitudinally from the position over the chimney orifice. Since Garratts are designed to be bi- directional, the problem was eventually solved by simply running them with the chimney trailing on the ascending legs of the tunneled routes. Service Owing to limitations in the length of sidings and crossing loops, the Class GL's allowed loads were originally from Durban to Cato Ridge and coastward, despite having shown themselves capable of greater loads. They were eventually marshalled to standard loads of between to correspond with the load which could be hauled by a lashup of three electric locomotives. x120px During April 1931, no. 2351 hauled a special train conveying the Governor-General of South Africa, His Excellency the Earl of Athlone and Princess Alice. The Governor- General and the Princess travelled on the footplate from Cato Ridge to Umlaas and expressed keen delight at the experience, which led to the Princess granting the SAR permission to name the locomotive on which she had travelled after her. The name plates were affixed to the cabsides above the number plates. In 1947, no. 2352 was the Garratt selected to haul the Royal Train between Glencoe and Piet Retief while sister engine no. 2355 hauled the pilot train over the same section.Soul of A Railway, System 6, Part 2: Greyville Loco, Greyville Station to Umgeni & Berea Road to Rossburgh. Introduction, Caption 13. (Accessed on 26 November 2016) Upon completion of the electrification project between Durban and Pietermaritzburg in 1938, the eight locomotives were transferred from the Durban section to the gruelling run between Glencoe and Vryheid with the latter's coal trains. This work entailed the regular haulage of up gradients of 1 in 50, taxing the Class GL even more heavily than the work for which it was designed. Despite this, they maintained an effective service along this line until its electrification in 1968. The Class GL was then transferred from Glencoe to work the line between Stanger and Empangeni in the late 1940s. However, since the loads on this route did not fully justify the use of the powerful Class GL while their great weight and high axle loading restricted them to mainlines laid with heavy rail, they were eventually replaced by less powerful, more modern and more economical Class GMA locomotives. Though briefly considered as hump shunters at Bloemfontein, the Class GL had outlasted its use and after some forty-two years of working the most difficult terrain on the SAR, they were withdrawn from service in 1972. Preservation Of the eight locomotives, the first two have survived into preservation. No. 2351 Princess Alice is preserved at the Outeniqua Transport Museum in George. No. 2352 was allocated to the National Collection of the South African Railway Museum. It was staged at Greyville Loco in Durban at the time and the Loco Foreman at Greyville was asked to prepare the engine for haulage up to Germiston Loco where it was intended to stage the engine. His response was that no engine would leave his Depot under haulage and that he would have it prepared to steam and travel up to Germiston under its own power, which it did in due course. The development of the planned new museum was shelved indefinitely and the condition of the locomotive gradually deteriorated where it stood at Germiston. Some eight years later, in 1983 the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester after failing to acquire the East African Railways 59 class, 5930 \\"Mount Shengena\\" because of high shipping costs, asked if they could acquire the engine for display in their institution - since it had been built in that city by Beyer- Peacock. This request was granted and with the help of shipping sponsors, it duly arrived back in Manchester. By the time it was shipped to England, it was shorn of around two hundred parts including its right-hand-side ashpan and much of its brick arch.

He stands out as one of the greatest Eastern Orthodox patristic writers of the nineteenth century. He was glorified (canonized) as a saint by the 1988 meeting of the Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church. His relics are preserved at the ancient Tolga Monastery on the Volga River near Yaroslavl.Maximovitch, St. John.

He was educated at Main Military Engineering School in St. Petersburg. Although successful in his studies, he was deeply dissatisfied with the lay life and turned to a life of prayer. In 1827 he fell seriously ill and left the army on this ground. He began pursuing a monastic vocation and in 1831 took monastic vows and received the monastic name of Ignatius. He was ordained a priest shortly afterwards. He rose rapidly to the rank of archimandrite and at the age of 26 was appointed superior of the Maritime Monastery of St. Sergius in St. Petersburg. In 1857, Ignatius was consecrated Bishop of the Caucasus and the Black Sea, but he retired only four years later to the Nikolo-Babayevsky Monastery on the Volga to devote himself to spiritual writing.The Arena, pp. vi-vii. He wrote a large amount of material, mostly about the spiritual life and prayer. Only a small portion of his writing has been translated into English. Although his writing was intended primarily for monks, his works are highly recommended for lay Christians by leading Orthodox figures such as Father Thomas Hopko.

The episode was written by Robert Carlock and was directed by Gail Mancuso. Guest stars in this episode include Katrina Bowden, Keith Powell, Maulik Pancholy, Tom Broecker, Jonathan Lutz, James Anderson and Sharon Wilkins. The episode focuses on the relationship between Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), head writer of TGS with Tracy Jordan, and Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), her boss; and the distractions the writers of TGS face when writing sketches. This becomes evident when Liz's assistant, Cerie (Katrina Bowden), wears sexually suggestive clothing; and when Jack decides to join the writers for observation. Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) learns that working for Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), the main star of TGS, is more than he expected. Plot The staff are preparing to write sketches for TGS with Tracy Jordan when Jack arrives and announces that he went through a program at General Electric (GE) called Six Sigma, which encourages bosses to interact with their staff. He tells Liz and the writers that he will be sitting in the writers' room every day as an observer. As days pass, Jack begins to interfere with the writers' work, and instead of just being an observer, he regularly gives the writers ideas for upcoming sketches. This causes a major frustration for the staff, so Liz tells Jack that the writers do not like his involvement. Jack says that although he enjoyed joining the writers every day, he tells Liz that he accepts their decision. Afterwards, Jack's secretary tells Liz that Jack wants her to apologize, but that she has to pretend that it was her idea. Liz goes to Jack's office and apologizes, and they forgive each other. While the staff eats their lunch, Jack introduces the staff to two of his guests. The writers mention to Liz that they would love to go outside to the same roof that is used for The Today Show, and Liz tells them that she can make it happen now that she and Jack are friends. Liz asks Jack, but he denies the request. He tells her that the two guests were his bosses from GE, and then criticizes Liz and her staff. He apologizes to Liz, but she says that their friendship is over. Having settled the situation with Jack, Liz tries to talk to her assistant Cerie about her attire, which seems to distract the writers. Liz attempts to convince her to wear something conservative, but Cerie tells Liz that she would look great in something sexy herself, and Liz is later seen walking down the hallway with a dress that reads \\"Dirty Diva\\". Kenneth, who is now working for Tracy, learns that working for Tracy is more than he expected. Tracy orders Kenneth to complete several tasks, including going to the Yankee Stadium for nachos, and picking up an important package, which turns out to be an illegal fish that Tracy wants to put in his aquarium. Tracy then tells Kenneth to buy something for his wife, Angie Jordan (Sharon Wilkins), and to take her to a fancy restaurant, where he gives her Tracy's gift. Production 30 Rock and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, both of which debuted on 2006‚Äì07 NBC lineup, revolved around the off-camera happenings on a sketch comedy series. Evidence of the overlapping subject matter between the shows, as well as the conflict between them, arose when Aaron Sorkin, the creator of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, asked Lorne Michaels to allow him to observe Saturday Night Live for a week, a request Michaels denied. Despite this, Sorkin sent Fey flowers after NBC announced it would pick up both series, and wished her luck with 30 Rock. Fey wound up \\"winning\\" over Sorkin when Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip was cancelled after one season and 30 Rock was renewed for a second and eventually went on to have seven seasons. Though 30 Rock's first season ratings proved lackluster and were lower than those of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, the latter was more expensive to produce. \\"Jack the Writer\\" contains a self-referencing walk and talk sequence, which is commonly used on Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and Sorkin's previous series. Star Wars is frequently referenced in 30 Rock, beginning with the pilot episode where Tracy Jordan is seen shouting that he is a Jedi. Liz Lemon admits to being a huge fan of Star Wars, saying that she had watched it many times with Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), and saying she dressed up as the Star Wars character Princess Leia for several Halloweens. Fey, a fan of Star Wars herself, said that the weekly Star Wars joke or reference \\"started happening organically\\" when the crew realized that they had a Star Wars reference \\"in almost every show\\". Fey said that from then on \\"it became a thing where [they] tried to keep it going\\", and that even though they could not include one in every episode, they still had a \\"pretty high batting average\\". Fey attributed most of the references to Robert Carlock, who she described as \\"the resident expert\\". In this episode, Liz repeatedly uses analogies from Star Wars for her situation with Jack, when she realizes that she \\"need[s] to get new DVDs\\". Reception According to the Nielsen ratings system, \\"Jack the Writer\\" was watched by approximately 4.61 million American viewers, ranking eighty-first in the weekly charts.ABC Medianet, (November 7, 2006) \\"Weekly Program Rankings \\". Retrieved on August 8, 2008. The episode received a rating of 1.7/5 in the key adults 18‚Äì49 demographic. The 1.7 refers to 1.7% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and the 5 refers to 5% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. In the United Kingdom, the episode attracted 500,000 viewers and a 4% share of the viewing audience at the time of the broadcast. Robert Canning of IGN felt that while the episode was \\"still an entertaining half-hour, there was nothing to it that was incredibly memorable.\\" He said that Tracy Jordan was \\"quickly becoming one of the more enjoyable aspects of the show\\". Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide felt that \\"this outing fell a bit flat for [him]\\". He thought that \\"the best moment this week, by far, had to be that big, fat wink to Aaron Sorkin's Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip (and West Wing, and Sports Night... ), where Liz and Pete, upon realizing that they had traveled in a small circle over the course of a banter exchange, shrugged and said, 'Nice walk-and-talk', and then bumped fists.

The total lost time is the sum of two separate elements: start-up lost time and clearance lost time. Start-up lost time happens when a traffic signal changes from red (stop) to green (go). Some amount of time elapses between the signal changing from red to green and the first queued vehicle moving through the intersection. There is then an additional amount of time for the next vehicle to begin moving and pass through the intersection, and so on. The total time taken for all waiting drivers to react and accelerate is the start-up lost time. Clearance lost time is the time lost to stopping a line of vehicles at the end of a green phase. Lost time is always measured in seconds. Start-up lost time can be calculated as the sum of the differences between the headways for the first cars in line and the average headway through the intersection at a theoretical maximum flow, the saturation flow rate. When no observations have been made, the start-up lost time is assumed to be 2.0 seconds as a default value. Since clearance lost time is often not observable since observation requires that some vehicles which were waiting at the start of a green phase still be waiting when the green phase ends, it is typically determined through the equation l_2 = y + ar - e, where \\\\mathit{l}_2 is the clearance lost time, y is the yellow time, ar is the all-red interval time during which the traffic signal is red for all directions, and e is the portion of the yellow and all- red times during which vehicles are illegally in the intersection and has a default value of 2.0 seconds in HCM. ALDOT's Traffic Signal Design Guide and Timing Manual, on the other hand, determines clearance lost time to be half of the yellow interval plus the entire all-red interval. In order to find out how clearance lost time can be calculated see and. In this study, clearance lost time was measured in the field and compared with the default values specified in HCM and ALDOT's manual. References * Roger P. Roess, Elena S. Prassas, and William R.

These include: All-men, All-women, Jazz, Concert, Advanced, and Chamber choirs. Clark's full orchestra (consisting of orchestra and band) performed at Carnegie Hall in New York in 2008 and 2012. In March 2015, Clark's chamber orchestra performed at an ASTA national competition at Abravanel Hall in Salt Lake City. They placed as national and grand champions.

It was based on the XC Hardtop (Coupe). History In 1978, Ford Australia unveiled plans for an all-new Falcon, dubbed the XD, that would be released in 1979. Unlike the current XC, the new model would be offered only as a four-door sedan or station wagon, meaning the two-door XC Hardtops of 1978 would be the last of that design. In December 1977 Ford built 13 special order XC Falcon GS Hardtops with VINs beginning JG65TE. These cars were specially modified in the P&A; (Parts and Accessories) workshop at Ford's Campbellfield factory. All vehicles were modified to accord with 'evolution' upgrades that had been approved by CAMS for homologation to Australian Group C touring car racing Falcons ... the changes were mostly designed to enhance race durability; these vehicles, often referred to as \\"Pre-Cobras\\", were intended to be raced by teams at Bathurst in 1977. The homologation modifications included rear wheel wells that were deepened inboard by 1 inch to accommodate larger racing wheels and tyres, a reverse bonnet scoop to allow the race car engines to draw cool air from the base of the windscreen, twin electric fans that were switchable from the dash (replacing the single engine- driven fan), a front shocker tower brace (\\"K brace\\") that stiffened the front end, an idler arm brace, and an aero package including a rear \\"blade\\" spoiler (similar to that used on the 2-door Holden Torana A9X) and a front air dam. The 13 cars were available in standard body and interior colours and retained the side trim strips, dummy rear brake scoops and unpainted chrome bumpers of the standard GS hardtops. The race cars did complete the 1977 Endurance Series in their new specification and then participated in the 1978 ATCC season. The modifications that featured in these 13 GS Hardtops formed the basis of the specification for the 30 specific Option 97 Cobra Hardtops built in 1978, although there were minor differences as the Option 97 cars also incorporated further evolution parts such as reinforced fan brackets and a deeper front spoiler. In addition the Option 97 cars received a black corduroy seat material and Scheel front seats to differentiate them from the Option 96 Cobras .http://cobra.jfpresentations.com/cobra.html When final production of the XC Hardtop at the Broadmeadows Assembly plant was ending in March 1978, more than 400 body shells were left unsold and Ford Australia faced a dilemma of how to shift them, rather than scrap them. When an original proposal to turn these cars into black and gold Playboy-themed cars (complete with \\"bunny\\" decals) was rejected as sending the wrong image for a family car company, Ford turned to Edsel Ford II, then the Deputy Managing Director of Ford Motor Company who was also M.D. of Ford Australia at that time (from 1978 to 1980). He and a local design team elected to capitalise on Allan Moffat and Colin Bond's crushing 1-2 finish at the 1977 Bathurst 1000 by creating a road car with a \\"Shelby Mustang\\" look that could be homologated for racing, while at the same time offering enthusiasts the opportunity to own a street-legal version of Moffat's race car. The first prototype Falcon Cobra was built in late April 1978 and production began that same July. The cars were painted Bold Blue with an overlay of Sno White, with Olympic Blue accent stripes separating the two colours ... \\"Cobra\\" emblem decals, a throwback to Carroll Shelby's Mustangs of the 1960s, were affixed to the front fenders, along with a name decal at the rear. Unusually, the bodyshells were painted blue first, the intended area of blue stripes and sills then masked and the white coat painted over the top. Each of the cars was given its own individual serial number and fitted with a sequentially numbered plaque (from 001 to 400) on the dash. The first 200 Cobras produced were given the 5.8L 351 Cleveland V8, while the other 200 received the 4.9L 302 Cleveland ... the only exceptions to this being build number 001 is a 302ci (4.9 litre) V8 and build number 351 is a 351ci (5.8 litre) V8. Cobras were available with either automatic or manual transmission. Standard equipment included four-wheel disc brakes, limited slip differential, 15-inch Bathurst Globe wheels, front & rear spoilers and dual exhaust. The interiors were uniformly black, with Cobra specific cloth seat inserts in black with blue stripes that match those on the outside body. Cars numbered from 002 to 0031 were known as Option 97 specification, the so-called \\"Bathurst Cobras\\", fitted with parts to allow homologation for racing, including twin radiator fans switchable from the dash, a gearbox oil cooler, suspension bracing and reworked rear wheel body housings. They were most easily identified from the other 370 Option 96 Cobras via their large (and functional) rear-opening bonnet bulge. Allan Moffat's \\"Moffat Ford Dealers\\" race cars of late 1978 shared the same body paint decoration as the road cars. Falcon Cobras have become increasingly revered by collectors across Australia and a mint example might be worth upwards of $100,000 ... with Option 97 cars (rarely offered up for sale) likely to fetch a further premium. 2007 FPV GT Cobra BF Falcon GT Cobra, XC Cobra Hardtop and BF Cobra ute. At the 2007 Bathurst 1000, Ford Performance Vehicles unveiled a new limited edition Cobra, celebrating 30 years since Moffat and Bond's 1-2 finish. Like the original, the new FPV GT Cobra sedan has a certified build of just 400 units. In addition, a Cobra Ute was created, of which just 100 were built. Both cars are powered by the 5.4-litre Boss 302 engine; the name is derived from the 302kW (405hp) power output.

Its original reverse of a kiwi was changed in 1990 when the image was moved onto the one-dollar coin. In 2006 its size was reduced and its edge altered to a Spanish flower as part of a revision of New Zealand's coins, which also saw its alloy become nickel-plated steel. Design = 1967 to 1990 = On 10 July 1967, New Zealand decimalised its currency, replacing the pound with the dollar at a rate of one pound to two dollars and one shilling to ten cents. The 20-cent coin directly replaced the one-florin coin, which had been worth two shillings. Like the florin, the new 20-cent coin was made of cupronickel, 28.58 mm in diameter, 11.31 grams in weight, and had 100% edge milling. The 20-cent coin retained the presence of a kiwi on the reverse of the florin, albeit in a different design. The original obverses of 20-cent coins depicted Arnold Machin's portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

Mintings of this coin from 1990 are rare. = 1990 to 2006 = In 1990, the new $1 and $2 coins were released to replace the $1 and $2 notes. As the $1 depicted a kiwi also, the 20-cent's reverse had to be redesigned.

The new 20-cent coin had the same reverse as the 1990 to 2006 minted coins and the same obverse as the 1999-onward coins, but the coins were reduced in size. The new 20-cent coins are made of steel, covered in a layer of nickel, copper, then nickel again. The new coins are 21.75 mm in diameter and 4 grams in weight. They have Spanish flower milling around the edge, splitting it into seven sections. For their introduction in 2006, 116 million were minted, with a total value of NZ$23.2 million. The only other year of issue was 2008, where 80 million coins and a total value of NZ$16 million were issued. The old 20-cent coins were demonetised on 1 November 2006.

It was written by co-executive producer Jack Burditt, and directed by Juan J. Campanella. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) in the United States on November 30, 2006. Guest stars in this episode include Michael Blackson, Katrina Bowden, Greta Cavazzoni, Teddy Coluca, Rachel Dratch, Annette Hunt, Keith Powell, Ali Reza, Lonny Ross, Brian Stack, and Dean Winters. In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) takes back her sleazy ex-boyfriend Dennis Duffy (Winters), while Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) takes it upon himself to convince her that she is headed for a life of mediocrity. Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is enraged when a magazine calls him \\"normal\\", and at the same time Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) becomes worried about her age when Jack asks her how old she is. Plot Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) and Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters) have gotten back together after Dennis was the only person who remembered her birthday. Disturbed by Liz's acceptance of mediocrity, her boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), tries to reform her into someone who enjoys the good life. He refers Liz to the fanciest restaurant in the city, Stone. Nevertheless, Liz declines Jack's offer to be her mentor. That night at Stone, Jack and his date walk by Liz and Dennis's table, with Jack very unimpressed by Dennis's manners. The following day, Jack introduces Liz to a former mentee of his, Howard Jorgensen (Brian Stack). At lunch the next day, Liz realizes she is frustrated with her relationship with Dennis, then she storms off to Jack's office to ask for help. Jack motivates Liz to end it with him. Liz comes home to break up with Dennis, only to find him distraught after a loss of his favorite hockey team, the New York Islanders. As a result, Dennis moves in with her. Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is upset after being identified in a magazine as an actor behaving normally, far from the insane persona he is trying to maintain. To re-establish his street cred, Tracy gets a dragon tattoo on his face, but is later identified as made of sharpie. At the same time, Josh Girard (Lonny Ross) is told that he is to receive a special gift from Liz Taylor (Rachel Dratch) as a response to an impression he did of the actress on TGS with Tracy Jordan. Liz Taylor sneaks into the 30 Rock studios and, upset over Josh's impersonation, brutally beats him with a fire extinguisher. At the same time, Jack, responding to audience research, starts cleaning out green clothes from the set. He asks Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), one of the stars of TGS, how old she is, and she tells him that she is 29. As a result of this exchange, Jenna gets botox and collagen injections that go terribly wrong. Later, during a sketch rehearsal‚Äîinvolving impersonations of Condoleezza Rice, Laura Bush, and John Kerry‚Äîthe various mishaps of Tracy, Jenna, and Josh prompt Liz and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) that it would be impossible for the three to perform on the show. The power in the NBC Studios goes out, canceling the show. Production Rachel Dratch made her third appearance in this episode. \\"Jack Meets Dennis\\" was written by co-executive producer Jack Burditt and directed by Juan J. Campanella. This was Burditt's first writing credit, and was Campanella's first directed episode. The episode originally aired on November 30, 2006 on NBC as the sixth episode of the show's first season and overall of the series. Actor Dean Winters made his 30 Rock debut in this episode as the character Dennis Duffy, a former ex-boyfriend of Tina Fey's character, Liz Lemon. Comedian actor Brian Stack made his first appearance as Howard Jorgensen, a GE executive and associate of Jack Donaghy's in the episode. Stack would guest star in the episodes \\"Succession\\" and \\"Larry King\\". Rachel Dratch, longtime comedy partner and fellow Saturday Night Live (SNL) alumna of Fey, the show's head writer from 1999 until 2006, was originally cast to portray Jenna Maroney. Dratch played the role in the show's original pilot, but in August 2006, actress Jane Krakowski was announced as Dratch's replacement. Executive producer Lorne Michaels announced that while Dratch would not be playing a series regular, she would appear in various episodes in a different role. In the pilot and \\"The C Word\\" episodes, Dratch played Greta Johansen, The Girlie Show's cat wrangler. In \\"The Aftermath\\", she played Maria the maid, who is found by Liz in a closet on a yacht. In this episode, Dratch played actress Liz Taylor. This was Dratch's third appearance on the show. Various other cast members of SNL have appeared on 30 Rock. These cast members include: Chris Parnell, Fred Armisen, Kristen Wiig, Will Forte, Jason Sudeikis and Molly Shannon. Fey and Tracy Morgan have both been part of the main cast of SNL. While contemplating how the crew may avoid having to air the episode with the cast in such visibly dire condition, Pete states that the show could be replaced by a live news broadcast of a breaking news event. He then asks \\"How's Gerald Ford's health?\\" President Gerald Ford would die on December 26, 2006, less than a month after the episode aired. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Jack Meets Dennis\\" was watched by an average of 5.97 million households, according to the Nielsen ratings system. It received a 2.1 rating among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. \\"Jack Meets Dennis\\" finished in 70th place in the weekly ratings for the week of November 27‚ÄìDecember 3, 2006. This was an increase from the previous episode, \\"Jack- Tor\\", which was watched by 5.2 million American viewers. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times said the series worked because it played \\"with the absurdities of the television business lightly\\". Stanley felt that 30 Rock was at its best when it revolved around the characters, and not the show itself. IGN contributor Robert Canning said that although Tracy and Jenna \\"had their moments in two rather weak storylines\\", the \\"unfunny and distracting 'Where's Waldo?' casting [regarding Rachel Dratch's different characters that she has played on the show]\\" disrupted the flow of the episode. He enjoyed the improvement of the show, and said that \\"though not every story this week was stellar, you didn't go long without a decent laugh.\\" Canning gave \\"Jack Meets Dennis\\" a 7.5 out of 10 rating. TV Guide's Matt Mitovich said the episode was \\"one of the stronger episodes thus far\\", citing that \\"[e]veryone got funny stuff to do, the Jack-Liz scenes were crackling and teaming with Liz-induced self-humiliation, and we even got a Rachel Dratch cameo (as that angry, angry Liz Taylor).\\" Mitovich who had not been a fan of the Jenna character, said that he enjoyed her in this episode. Alan Pergament for The Buffalo News wrote, \\"The extent that stars go to literally and figuratively maintain their images probably sounded funny on paper [in regards to Tracy and Jenna's storylines], but most of it falls flat and illustrates why 30 Rock has been sinking like a rock\\". Pergament gave this episode two out of four stars. Amy Amatangelo of the Boston Herald enjoyed Dean Winters' appearances on 30 Rock, noting that he did a \\"hilarious turn\\" as Dennis. Matt Roush for TV Guide reported that Alec Baldwin \\"stole the show\\" in this episode.

A trichocyst is an organelle found in certain ciliates and dinoflagellates. A trichocyst can be found in tetrahymena and along cila pathways of several metabolic systems. It is also a structure in the cortex of certain ciliate and flagellate protozoans consisting of a cavity and long, thin threads that can be ejected in response to certain stimuli. Trichocysts may be widely distributed over an organism or restricted to certain areas (e.g., tentacles, papillae, around the mouth). There are several types. Mucoid trichocysts are elongated inclusions that may be ejected as visible bodies after artificial stimulation. Filamentous trichocysts in Paramecium and other ciliates are discharged as filaments composed of a cross-striated shaft and a tip. Toxicysts (in Dileptus and certain other carnivorous protozoans) tend to be localized around the mouth. When discharged, a toxicyst expels a long, nonstriated filament with a rodlike tip, which paralyzes or kills other microorganisms; this filament is used to capture food and, presumably, in defense. The functional significance of other trichocysts is uncertain, although those of Paramecium apparently can be extruded for anchorage during feeding.

Education  Richards was born in Melton, Victoria and was educated at Box Hill Grammar, South Melbourne College and the University of Melbourne, obtaining a B.Sc. in 1906, M.Sc. in 1909 and D.Sc. in 1915.  Career  Richards worked on the geological survey of Victoria in 1906‚Äì07 while still an undergraduate student. He went to work for De Bavay and Company in Broken Hill, and then took up a position as a scholar and demonstrator at the University of Melbourne. In 1910, Richards took up a position teaching in the Chemistry, Geology and Mining Department of the Central Technical College (CTC), in the Government House Domain of George Street, Brisbane (forerunner of Queensland Institute of Technology). He successfully applied to be a lecturer at the newly formed University of Queensland in 1911. Both the CTC and University of Queensland geology classes would share some of the same buildings in George Street, Brisbane, until the University moved to the St Lucia campus in 1950. Richards was interested in the building stones of both Victoria, and later his adopted home of Queensland. He published two papers on the building stones of Brisbane, especially Helidon sandstone and was an advisor on the plans for the building work of the University of Queensland in 1930 to 1931 and again in 1938, among other projects. Richards would be a dynamic force for the Geology Department, the Faculty of Science and the University during its early years. In 1919, Richards became the University's first geology professor. He was Dean of the Faculty of Science, President of the Board of Faculties, President of the Staff Association, on the University Senate, Chairman of Public Exams Committee, Music Advisory Board and many others. In 1946, Richards was Professor of Geology, Deputy Chancellor of the university, Chairman of Trustees of the National Art Gallery, President of the Art Galleries and Museums Association of Australia and New Zealand, Chairman of the Great Barrier Reef Committee and many others. He led geology camps to Spicer's Gap and the Great Barrier Reef. His wife would be a chaperone for the female students, on many camps and dances held at the fledgling University. Dorothy Hill would become one of the students of the Geology Department in 1925, and found him to be a great mentor of the Science students. He encouraged her to apply for a Foundation Travelling Scholarship to the University of Cambridge in 1929, which she won. Richards also began the purchase of research materials to build a library at the University. In 1922 he founded, along with Queensland Governor Sir Matthew Nathan, the Great Barrier Reef Committee. This led to two deep boring projects through the Reef (in 1927 and 1937) to prove one of Charles Darwin's theories and to look for ways to exploit the economic potential of the Reef. The Committee's public relations ventures, in order to bring in more money for their research programmes, would also lead to a number of biological expeditions to the Reef, including the year long Low Isles Great Barrier Reef Expedition of 1928. This expedition brought in many biologists and geographers from around the world, and led to publication of research at the British Natural History Museum. The Committee's work would eventually lead to the establishment of the Heron Island Research Station, Australia's first coral reef marine biology research station. In 1929, Richards took leave from the University and was a member of the Royal Commission into Mining in Queensland. This enabled him to travel to the International Geology Conference in South Africa, as a representative of the Australian and Queensland governments. Being equally interested in art as he was in geology, Richards was a member of the Survey of Australian and New Zealand Museums and Art Galleries for the Carnegie Corporation of New York in 1932‚Äì33, and received a Carnegie Institute medal for his services to this survey in 1936. This enabled him to take an extended trip overseas to visit the Carnegie Institute in Washington, D.C. and the Seismology Laboratory in Pasadena, California (Caltech). This visit led to a Commonwealth Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) grant to obtain a second Milne-Shaw Seismograph for the University, following the 1935 earthquake in Gayndah, Queensland. The University established their first Seismology station in 1937, thanks to the work of Richards and his colleague W.H. Bryan. Richards would be appointed to the Board of Trustees of the Queensland Art Gallery in 1938, and become President of the same in 1945 until his death in 1947. Richards worked for the Queensland Department of Mines and was a member of Artesian Water Committee, in 1938, as well as being the President of the Royal Society of Queensland. He was awarded the Clarke Medal of the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1938, the fourth Queensland recipient to be so awarded. During World War Two, Richards assisted the war effort by helping to place scientists in appropriate positions in either the armed or civilian services. In 1941, he and Dorothy Hill worked on the project to analyse two bores of the Great Barrier Reef. University of Queensland, Richards Building (geology) named for H.C. Richards. It depicts a frieze designed by the Geology staff. Photo used with the permission of the University of Queensland Fryer Library Richards died in 1947 in Brisbane, survived by his wife Grace and two children. He was celebrated for his energy and industriousness, popularity with students and ability to foster cooperation between the University and the Queensland government.  Legacy  Following his death, the new Geology Department building, which he had toiled over to establish at the new campus of St Lucia, was named in his honour. It fronts the Great Court. W.H. Bryan would succeed him in the position of Professor. The H.C. Richards Memorial Prize was established in geology, in acknowledgement of his contribution to the University of Queensland. It was an annual prize in art from 1954‚Äì1972. A bas-relief was sculpted of him in the entrance stones of the Geology building, and an ammonite fossil, carved into the entrance to the building, was similarly named for him.

Born Sait≈ç Fuku (ÊñâËó§Á¶è), she was a daughter of Sait≈ç Toshimitsu (who was a retainer of Akechi Mitsuhide). She was the wet nurse of the third Tokugawa sh≈çgun Iemitsu. Lady Kasuga was one of the best politicians in the Edo period. She stood in front of negotiations with the Imperial Court and contributed to the stabilization of the Tokugawa Shogunate.  Life  Adachi Ginko (c.1880) Sait≈ç Fuku was from the Sait≈ç clan, a prominent samurai house that had served for generations as deputy military governors of Mino province. She was born in Kuroi Castle of Tanba province (comprising modern-day Hyogo and Kyoto Prefectures), which is where her father's territory was then located. Tanba Province was under the overlordship of Akechi Mitsuhide, and her father, Sait≈ç Toshimitsu, as his retaier, was enfeoffed on that territory by Mitsuhide. Her mother's father was Inaba Yoshimichi. Fuku's father joined Akechi Mitsuhide's rebellion to kill Oda Nobunaga during the Honn≈ç-ji Incident. After Nobunaga was assassinated by Mitsuhide, the Saito and Akechi clan were defeated by Hashiba Hideyoshi during the Battle of Yamazaki. Then Fuku's father, Toshimitsu, retired to his castle; later he was caught in Omi province, near Sakamoto Castle, and was executed. It is thought that his various brothers, having become defeated and hunted warriors, wandered from place to place trying to escape the enemy. Because Fuku was a woman, she was spared execution and was raised by her maternal relative, aristocrat Sanjonishi Kinkuni. After being adopted, she received the highest education as an aristocrat of the privileged class. She learned the arts considered essential for the nobles of the Imperial court, including the arts of calligraphy, waka poetry and mixing incense. She was later adopted by her uncle, Inaba Shigemichi, and became the wife of Inaba Masanari, a retainer of Kobayakawa Hidekai During the marriage she had three sons, including Inaba Masakatsu, and an adopted son, Hotta Masatoshi. In 1600, during the Sekigahara campaign, Fuku's husband, Inaba Masanari, served Hideaki in the Western army led by Ishida Mitsunari. Due to the tensions Hideaki had with Mitsunari and the progression of the war being favorable to the Eastern army led by Tokugawa Ieyasu, it is said that Fuku and Masanari achieved the great feat of making Hideaki change sides and join the Eastern army. After Hideaki joined Ieyasu, Mitsunari's army was defeated, as a result of which the Fuku family obtained a large amount of spoils of war. After that, she took the step of divorcing her husband Masanari to become a wet nurse in the shogunal family and, in 1604, was formally appointed as the wet nurse of Takechiyo (the childhood name of Tokugawa Iemitsu), the legitimate son and heir of the second shogun, Tokugawa Hidetada. She was recommended to Tokugawa Ieyasu by Itakura Katsushige for the position of wet nurse for Tokugawa Iemitsu, but there is a theory that Ieyasu chose her on his own. They say that Fuku's excellent pedigree, refined and aristocratic education and the military exploits of her ex-husband Masanari were all positive factors in her selection as a wet nurse. She was chosen for the job as a payment because she helped persuade Kobayakawa Hideaki to join the Eastern Army in the Battle of Sekigahara. She also established the ≈åoku, the women's quarters, at Edo Castle. In 1607 after Iemitsu became sh≈çgun, she became J≈çr≈ç Otoshiyori (‰∏äËáàÂæ°Âπ¥ÂØÑ) or the senior ladyship, recommended by the first Midaidokoro, Oeyo. J≈çr≈ç Otoshiyori influence was equivalent to a R≈çj≈´ in Edo Castle. In 1629, Ofuku traveled to the capital, where she had an audience with the Empress Meisho and Emperor Go-Mizunoo at the Imperial Court in Kyoto. She was promoted to the extraordinarily high Court rank of second class; and after this time, she was called Kasuga-no-Tsubone or Lady Kasuga. When Lady Kasuga and Empress consort Tokugawa Masako (Oeyo and Hidetada's daughter) broke a taboo by visiting the imperial court as a commoner, Emperor Go-Mizunoo abdicated, embarrassed, and Meisho became empress. The sh≈çgun, Iemitsu, was now the uncle of the sitting monarch. During her life time, she had a fortune equivalent to over 100,000 koku.Murdock, James.

Life and career Born Alvin Scott Beach, he appeared in numerous motion pictures, most notably as a German scientist patterned after Wernher von Braun in The Right Stuff. His deep voice was often heard in films. He once said that director George Lucas liked his voice and often used him in his films, beginning with THX 1138.Interview with Scott Beach Beach also appeared as Mr. Gordon in American Graffiti and provided an uncredited stormtrooper voice in Star Wars. Beach was an early and beloved performer at the original Renaissance Pleasure Faires in Agoura and Novato, California, where for many years he portrayed the Lord Mayor of the Shire and was a mentor and an inspiration to many aspiring actors. Along with his acting career, Beach was a natural for radio and was on the staff of KSFO in San Francisco, California. During a radio broadcast on January 28, 1973, he reported that the Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet Nam had been signed on the previous day in Paris, France. That agreement, also known as the Paris Peace Accords, ended direct U.S. military involvement in the Viet Nam War. Beach concluded his report about the peace agreement by stating, \\"I fear that the last U.S. soldier to die in Vietnam is still alive.\\" He was correct; the last American death in Viet Nam was not until April 29, 1975. See McMahon and Judge. Beach twice served as the narrator in performances of Arthur Honegger's King David with the Masterworks Chorale of San Mateo, California. He also narrated other performances of the oratorio in both the original French and the English translation used by the Masterworks Chorale. He was the host of the San Francisco Opera broadcasts over KKHI during the early 1970s.Eyewitness account by Robert E. Nylund, member of Masterworks Chorale, 1970-85. Beach also provided the voice of the comic strip cat Garfield in the character's first television appearance in the 1980 anthology special The Fantastic Funnies; he was later replaced in that role by Lorenzo Music.

Early life and career  Fernando Tarrida del M√°rmol was born in 1861 in Cuba. His family emigrated to Spain during the 1868 Glorious Revolution, and his father ran a shoe and boot manufacturing plant in the Catalonian town of Sitges. Tarrida received a degree in mathematics from the Pau lyc√©e, in southern France. His classmate and later French prime minister Louis Barthou converted him to republicanism. Tarrida moved to the University of Barcelona for a degree in civil engineering, and became a professor of mathematics at Barcelona's Polytechnic. Despite his family's wealth, he identified more closely with Barcelona's working class and visited their clubs to discuss politics and quality of life. The workers appreciated his charisma and sincerity. By the mid 1880s‚ÄîTarrida's twenties‚Äîhe was a collectivist anarchist who identified with the federalism of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Francesc Pi i Margall. Tarrida viewed anarchism beyond political philosophy as an all-encompassing philosophy, or the process by which humanity integrates and develops. He often referred to anarchism in mathematical formula as both the language to clarify his thoughts and to scientifically prove the philosophy's tenets. Tarrida gave public lectures and wrote about anarchism for libertarian journals, and developed a friendship with the Spanish anarchist Anselmo Lorenzo. Barcelona workers chose Tarrida as their delegate to the International Socialist Congress in Paris, 1889. Tarrida's tombstone Tarrida first proposed the idea of \\"anarchism without adjectives\\" during a public speech in November 1889. Anarchists often debated their ideal economic conditions, and \\"anarchism without adjectives\\" appealed anarchists to abandon these divisions, accommodate other factions, follow the basic principles of anarchism, and instead work together towards their unified cause. He argued that anarchists share opposition to dogma and should therefore let each other freely choose their choice of economic system. Put another way, anarchism was \\"the axiom\\" and their economic model was \\"secondary\\". Tarrida gave this speech at the Bellas Artes palace as a representative of an affinity group in commemoration of the Chicago Haymarket affair two years prior. Tarrida, himself, did not publicly engage in the factionism between collectivism and communism, though his earlier works adopted a collectivist position. In 1890, the French anarcho-communist journal Le R√©volt√© charged the Spanish anarchist movement as overly collectivist and prone to authoritarian organization. The journal challenged Tarrida to defend his position, and in an open letter, he affirmed their differences in tactics but agreement in ultimate goal. He defended the Spanish anarchist model of forming alliances between groups, and criticized the French anarchists' puritanical rigidity as ineffectual against the centralized bourgeoisie in the absence of coordinated action. Tarrida also noted the difference between the development of Spanish and French anarchism. While the French called the Spanish workers' associations authoritarian, Tarrida wrote that these organizations were responsible for building the anarchist tradition in Spain and contributed to their workers' natural rejection of communist worker models.

The railroad was incorporated on March 28, 1882 and construction was completed on April 15, 1885. The railroad was built as a common carrier with copper mining being its primary traffic. The track was built using 35/40 lb steel rails. On March 15, 1888 the San Joaquin & Sierra Nevada was consolidated into Southern Pacific Railroad's (SP) subsidiary, the Northern Railway Company. In 1897, the Northern Railway abandoned the track between Woodbridge and Brack's Landing and converted the rest of the line to . The following year, the Northern Railway was consolidated into the Southern Pacific. In 1925/1926, Southern Pacific extended the branch line 8 miles east into the Sierras to its ending point known as Kentucky House (or Kentucky Home). The last 4 miles of the branch at Kentucky House were sold to the Calaveras Cement Company on April 28, 1929. The Calaveras Cement Company closed the plant at Kentucky House in 1984. Prior to 1984, the SP was operating three freight trains per week between Lodi and Kentucky House. The branch was listed in Southern Pacific timetables as the Kentucky House Branch and interchanged at Lodi with the SP mainline that ran from Stockton - Sacramento. After the cement plant closed, the branch was used to store railroad freight cars. Eventually the tracks were removed. The line from Woodbridge to Lodi is known as the Woodbridge Branch and terminates near the General Mills plant in Lodi.

For thirty-four years he worked at Bell Laboratories, where he was instrumental in designing a long-lasting plastic to sheath telephone cables, enabling the introduction of telephone services to thousands of Americans, especially those in rural communities. In addition to his pioneering research, Hawkins is also known for his advocacy efforts for minority students. He also served as the chairman of Montclair State University in 1973. Amongst his many awards, Hawkins was the first African-American to be elected to the National Academy of Engineering (1975), and, shortly before his death in 1992, he was awarded the National Medal of Technology by then-U.S. president, George H. W. Bush.  Early years  W. Lincoln Hawkins was born on March 21, 1911, in Washington, D.C. His father was a lawyer for the U.S. Census Bureau and his mother was a science teacher in the District of Columbia school system. Hawkins also had a brother, David Brown, and a sister. He was the grandson of a slave and obtained his secondary school education in the segregated school system of the Jim Crow Era. When he was young, Hawkins was fascinated with how things worked. For example, it was not unusual for him to take apart one toy and reassemble it to make another one. He also made spring-driven toy boats to sail in the reflecting pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial. Hawkins and a fellow eleven-year-old once tried to build a perpetual motion machine, not realizing that it was an impossible task. He built a working radio so he could listen to Washington Senators baseball games. While at Washington's Dunbar High School, Hawkins noticed that his physics teacher drove an expensive new car every year. The teacher, Dr. James Cowen, who had invented a self-starter mechanism to replace automobile hand cranks, received a new car each year as partial payment from the company which had bought the mechanism. Hawkins was tremendously excited to discover that a person could make a living through mechanical tinkering. After graduating from high school he went to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, where he was one of only 2 Black students at the school. In 1932 he graduated with B.S., in chemical engineering. Unable to find a job during the Great Depression, he enrolled in graduate school at Howard University where, in 1934, he earned a master's degree in chemistry. Professor Howard Blatt, Hawkins‚Äô friend and mentor at Howard, informed him of a special scholarship at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. Hawkins enrolled at McGill, earned his Doctorate in Chemistry in 1938, with a focus in cellulose (lignin) chemistry. He stayed at McGill to teach for several more years. In 1940, Hawkins left McGill to continue his research at Columbia University when he received a fellowship from the National Research Council. Hawkins married his wife, Lilyan (n√©e Bobo), in 1938; they remained married until his death in 1992. They had two sons. = Bell Laboratories = In 1942, Hawkins became the first African- American to join the technical staff of Bell Laboratories. In 1963, he became Bell Labs' Supervisor of Applied Research, and in 1972, the head of his department. His earliest projects at Bell Labs were focused on producing cheap alternatives to rubber that could be made domestically during World War II. By controlling much of the Pacific theater in World War II, the Japanese had cut off much of America's rubber supply from Southeast Asia. Hawkins contributed to the development of a rubber substitute made from petroleum stock. After the war, Hawkins began work on new and improved insulation for telephone cables. Prior to this work, underground and underwater cables, which were laid over incredibly long distances, were covered with fiber wrapped in heavy, expensive lead sheathing. Scientists believed that new, cheap, lightweight plastics like polyethylene would be a good alternative, but common plastics could undergo chemical reactions that made them brittle and unsuitable for long-term use outdoors. Thus protective additives were required to stabilize these plastic materials. In 1956, Hawkins, in collaboration with Vincent Lanza, invented a plastic coating that could withstand extreme fluctuations in temperature, last up to seventy years, and was less expensive than lead. Upon validation of this technology, telephone lines were installed in rural areas, bringing affordable phone service to thousands of people and reducing the use of lead. In addition to his technical efforts developing the new polymer-based cable sheath, Hawkins gave considerable effort to developing appropriate testing methods to prove the materials would have long lifetimes and minimal plastic waste, and towards communicating the underlying chemistry to non-technical audiences interested in the expansion of telecommunications technology. In the 1970s, Hawkins shifted his research focus towards minimizing plastic waste. His work in the area of recycling plastics continued after Hawkins was promoted to assistant director of Bell Labs' Chemical Research Lab in 1974. The extremely durable nature of plastic becomes a huge problem when it must be discarded. Hawkins became an expert, not only in making plastics last longer, but in recycling these seemingly indestructible products. Over the course of his professional career, Hawkins contributed to 18 U.S. patents, 55 scientific research articles and 3 books. = Later years and advocacy efforts = Hawkins retired from Bell labs in 1976 after 34 years of contributions, and transitioned to working as the director of research of the Plastics Institute of America from 1976 to 1983. Throughout his career, Hawkins was involved with minority advocacy efforts. Whilst working at Bell Labs, he helped establish the Bell Laboratories Summer Research Program for Minorities and Women in 1974, which benefitted over 1,200 participants at the time of his death. Hawkins also helped establish and run the Bell Laboratories Cooperative Research Fellowship Program, which recruits and supports minorities and engineers interested in earning PhDs.. After retiring from Bell Labs, Hawkins continued to consult with the organization on diversity programming. After retirement, Hawkins began teaching and encouraging college students to study science and engineering. In 1981, he became the first chairman of Project SEED (Support of the Educationally & Economically Disadvantaged), an American Chemical Society program designed to promote science careers for minority students. He also served as chairman of the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council Committee on Minorities in Engineering. On August 20, 1992, Hawkins died in San Marcos, California due to heart failure. He was 81. Awards and legacy Hawkins was frequently honored as a polymer chemistry pioneer. He was the first Black American to be hired as part of the technical staff of Bell Labs and subsequently the first African-American to be elected to the National Academy of Engineering (1975). Hawkins also won the International Medal of the Society of Plastics, was inducted into the New Jersey Inventors Hall of Fame (1992), received the Burton C. Belden Award of the American Chemical Society, the Percy L. Julian Award of the National Organization of Black Chemists, the International Award of the Society of Plastics Engineers, the Honor Scroll of the American Institute of Chemists, and the Achievement Award of the Los Angeles Council of Black Professional Engineers. In a 1992 White House ceremony, he received the National Medal of Technology from President George H. W. Bush. Posthumously, Hawkins was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2010. For his research contributions, he received honorary doctorates from Montclair State College, Stevens Institute of Technology, Kean State College, and Howard University.

At one time this nickname was used in New Zealand itself, though its usage there is now seen as dated; it is still fairly widely used in Australia. The name derived from New Zealand's frequent seismic activity. The islands lie on the margin of two colliding tectonic plates, the Pacific and Indo-Australian Plates. Earthquakes are common, particularly in the southwest of the South Island and in the central North Island, and the North Island's scenery is marked by several active and dormant volcanic cones. The phrase is at worst only very mildly derogatory, and is usually only used humorously with no pejorative connotations. The country records more than 14,000 earthquakes a year ‚Äì but only about 150 are usually felt. Schoolchildren in the country regularly undertake earthquake drills. Significant recent earthquakes 4 September 2010: This 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck what was then New Zealand's second largest city, Christchurch. damaging many buildings, but with no loss of life. This was mainly due to New Zealand's building standards, the epicentre being approximately from the city, and the quake hitting at 4:35am. 22 February 2011: A 6.3 magnitude earthquake caused far more damage in Christchurch, including 181 deaths. This quake struck at about lunchtime and was centred closer at Lyttelton, and shallower than the prior quake, explaining the resultant destruction. 21 July 2013: A 6.5 magnitude earthquake struct in the Cook Strait near the town of Seddon and caused moderate damage in New Zealand's capital, Wellington. It was preceded by a strong M5.7 foreshock. 16 August 2013: A 6.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Lake Grassmere in South Islands Marlborough Region. It quake added substantial more damage to the town of Seddon after the 6.5 Seddon earthquake one month prior and both are considered to be an earthquake doublet. 2 September 2016: A 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck near Te Araroa off East Cape, North Island. Damage was localised to towns nearer to the epicentre of the earthquake, with 255 claims for damage compensation being lodged. 14 November 2016: A 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck near Culverden and Kaikoura in the North Canterbury area of the South Island. Two deaths have been reported. Moderate to significant damage occurred along the East Coast of central New Zealand, from Christchurch all the way through Wellington. The seabed near Kaikoura was raised 2.5 meters in some places.  Historical references  Usage of the term ‚ÄúShaky Isles‚Äù in the earlier half of the 20th century indicates a certain sensitivity on the subject among New Zealanders. ‚ÄúNew Zealand need not worry about the untruthful nickname ‚ÄòShaky Isles,‚Äô which appears occasionally in Australian papers, when a report of an earthquake is cabled across the Tasman Sea,‚Äù the New Zealand Railways Magazine assured its readers in 1929. In 1932 (the year after the Hawke‚Äôs Bay earthquake in New Zealand‚Äôs North Island killed 256 people) New Zealand‚Äôs Leader of the Opposition, Australian-born Harry Holland, warned New Zealand‚Äôs Parliament of ‚Äúthe serious damage that is being done to New Zealand by the grossly exaggerated and untruthful statements that are published overseas regarding earthquakes, riots, fires, and floods‚Ä¶‚Äù Holland told Parliament: ‚ÄúI visited Australia less than two years ago, and almost invariably when my name appeared in the newspapers I was described as a visitor from the land of shakes. My son was manager of the New Zealand hockey team which toured Australia. They visited Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales, and some of them went as far as South Australia. He brought back with him clippings from a number of newspapers, in which he and his team were described as the hockey team from the Shaky Isles. He says that when people got off the boat at Sydney they were looked upon as being very fortunate to have escaped from New Zealand, because of the continual shakes. I think the time has come when the Government would be well advised to impose a very much stricter censorship over the damaging cable messages that are sent out.‚Äù In popular culture The term \\"Shaky Isles\\" has been used multiple times in New Zealand popular culture as a reference to the country. Among the earliest uses of the term was by the Maori Troubadours in 1960, with their song Shakin' in the Shaky Isles. This was followed up in later decades by Mike Harding in 1989 and Dave Dobbyn in 1991. A New Zealand theatre company headed by Emma Deakin in London is called \\"The Shaky Isles Theatre Company\\". \\"Shaky Isles\\" is also the name of a cafe chain in Auckland.

It is a much sought- after residential and commercial address in the Klang Valley. Bangsar shown within the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur It lies about four kilometres southwest of the city centre and is a ten minutes drive by car from the city centre. It is given the postcode of 59000. The Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur is the local governing authority. It is represented by the Bangsar Park Residents' Association. Bangsar Park is also part of the Lembah Pantai constituency and its Member of Parliament is Nurul Izzah Anwar, for the past 2 terms.  History  Bangsar was initially a rubber estate. One suggestion is that it derives its name from Bunge, a Belgian, and Grisar, a Frenchman, said to be the founders of a European company that ran the estate, Bunge-Grisar. The name of this estate was soon localised to Bungsar, and finally Bangsar. It was the nearest to Kuala Lumpur. It was later developed into a residential area. Bangsar Park was the first area to be developed. Apparently it was the first planned housing estates in Kuala Lumpur. The first houses were built in 1969. Development in Bangsar started once Socfin estates sold the land to private developers. { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"margin:0 auto; background:none;\\"  style=\\"padding-right:1em;\\"  1.

Jalan Maarof (Ma'arof) is Bangsar's main thoroughfare. It also divides Bangsar into two main parts. On the east of this road lies Taman SA, Bangsar Park, Bukit Bangsar, Bangsar Utama and one-half of Bukit Bandaraya (postcode 59000). The other neighbourhoods (and other half of Bukit Bandaraya) lie on the west (postcode 59100). The Mobil service station along Jalan Maarof was sometimes used to identify the side of the road Bangsar Park is on, considering most of Bangsar was on the other side. This Mobil station was recently demolished. The secondary forests of Bukit Persekutuan and Bukit Damansara can be seen surrounding this part of Bangsar Park East of Bangsar Park lies Bukit Persekutuan, a low density neighbourhood developed in the colonial days and Bukit Damansara. Most of the vegetation from the forest has not been cleared, thus it would appears as if the eastern neighbourhoods of Bangsar were actually surrounded by a jungle. A few monsoon drains were constructed when Bangsar was developed. They have since been covered up, although they remain operational.  Demographics  Bangsar Park is a popular residential area among both Malaysians and expatriates. It is a melting pot today with a good balance of different races living here. However, it was never always that way. The initial residents of Bangsar Park were mainly Ceylonese from Brickfields, who were mostly government clerks and looking for a new, clean neighbourhood to move into. Bangsar Park does not have any commercial area. It is a purely residential area. The closest thing to a commercial area is the row of shophouses housing sundry shops, restaurants and a laundry shop. However, residents of Bangsar Park do not find this a problem. They love the peace and quiet and the homely feel of the area as a result of it being a purely residential area. Besides, the commercial areas of Bangsar Baru, Lucky Gardens and Bangsar Utama are all within walking distance. Bangsar Park has also a large population of Gujaratis. The Gujarati Association WP & Selangor building and Jain Mandir is also located at Lorong Maarof. Infrastructure Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Bangsar is a secondary school located within Bangsar Park. However, most parents prefer sending their children to Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Bukit Bandaraya, which is just three minutes drive away, as it has a better academic record. Pusat Kesihatan Umum Bangsar is a primary healthcare centre which is just walking distance from Bangsar Park. Universiti Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), a public hospital is situated within five minutes drive, although access is through Petaling Jaya. Transport Unlike the rest of Bangsar, Bangsar Park does not suffer from any traffic congestion at any time of the day. Bangsar Park is easily accessible from any part of Kuala Lumpur. It is just a ten-minute drive from the Kuala Lumpur city centre. It is also connected to the city of Petaling Jaya via the Federal Highway. Location of Bangsar LRT and bus connections The Bangsar LRT station (on Rapid KL's Kelana Jaya Line )is located along Jalan Bangsar. Abdullah Hukum, Kerinchi and Universiti LRT stations are also located nearby. Bangsar is a five-minute drive from KL Sentral, a major transportation hub in neighbouring Brickfields. Bangsar Park is also easily accessible using any of Rapid KL's bus services.

He is considered to be the father of Nichirenism, the fiercely ultranationalistic blend of Nichiren Buddhism and Japanese Nationalism espoused by such figures as Nissho Inoue, Kanji Ishiwara and Ikki Kita. Notably, however, the children's writer, poet, and rural activist Kenji Miyazawa also idolized Tanaka, and both Miyazawa and Ishiwara joined his flagship organization, the Kokuch≈´kai, in 1920. Early life Born Tada Tomonosuke in Tokyo (then called Edo), the third son of a noted physician and former devotee of Pure Land Buddhism who had converted to Nichiren Buddhism, Tanaka was placed under the care of the Rev. Kawase Nichiren following the death of his parents in 1870. Enrolled as a novice at Kawase's temple, he later entered the Nichiren Buddhist academy of Daikyo-in (the predecessor to Rissho University), during which time he adopted the sobriquet \\"Chigaku\\", meaning \\"Wisdom and Learning\\". However, during this time, Tanaka came to be disillusioned with the sect's leadership, who he considered too passive in their teachings, and in 1879 he abandoned the priesthood and set out to establish himself as a lay preacher of the \\"true\\" Nichiren Buddhism. Briefly employed at a German engineering company in Yokohama, he was quickly drawn to religious proselytizing, joining the lay organization Nichirenkai (Êó•ËìÆ‰ºö) as a preacher, in which capacity he honed his public speaking skills and developed his own distinct uncompromising Nichiren doctrine, which he came to refer to as \\"Nichirenism\\" (Êó•ËìÆ‰∏ªÁæ©, Nichirenshugi). Evolution of spiritual-political philosophy The 1890s saw Tanaka's spiritual philosophy evolve in an increasingly nationalistic manner, taking to concluding his works with the twin salutations of Namu My≈çh≈ç Renge Ky≈ç \\"Homage to the Lotus Sutra\\" and \\"Imperial Japan for Ever and Ever\\" (). The decade saw him carry out extensive lecturing tours throughout Japan and establish his Nichiren study group, Rissho Ankokukai (Á´ãÊ≠£ÂÆâÂõΩ‰ºö) from his new base in Kamakura. A noted anti-Christian and staunch opponent of Christian missionaries in Japan, he applauded Japan's triumph in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, stating that \\"The war with Russia is divinely inspired to make Japanese citizens aware of their heavenly task.\\"Lee, p. 28 In 1908, he moved his base to Miho, Shizuoka Prefecture, where he would write his most famous work, \\"The Doctrine of Saint Nichiren\\" () in 1911, in which he casts the radical 13th century priest Nichiren as the champion of the Japanese nation, and called for world unification through Nichirenism with the emperor as its core. \\"Japan's very purpose of existence,\\" he writes, \\"is the implementation of this plan, as a country conceived for building Nichiren Buddhism.\\"Hori, pp. 174‚Äì175 in 1914, Tanaka amalgamated all of his followers into a single organization, the ( based in Miho. He would maintain a busy lecture schedule until illness curtailed his activities in the late 1930s, traveling not only throughout Japan but also embarking on speaking tours of Japanese-occupied Korea and Manchukuo, where he supported and gave lectures to Puyi, who had been appointed Emperor of Manchukuo. His nationalist and imperialist convictions only hardened with age, believing that Japan's 1931 takeover of Manchuria was divinely ordained and part of a divine plan to spread the \\"true\\" Nichiren Buddhism throughout Asia. He even went as far as to compile diagrams of the states in which the \\"Nichirenization\\" of the world would take place. By the 1950s he foresaw a total of 19,900 students, 19,200 instructors and 23,033,250 followers spread across the Asia-Pacific region reaching as far as New Zealand.Lee, p. 27 While best known as a preacher and an orator, Tanaka was also a skilled poet and dramatist with a keen interest in the traditional theatrical arts of Japan. He wrote and performed numerous plays, all with a heavily moralistic undertone, and produced a volume of essays, songs and poems. Tanaka died in 1939 at the age of 79, and is entombed in the Myoshu Mausoleum in Tokyo. His son, Dr. Satomi Kishio, took over the reins of his organization, and remained a staunch defender of his father in the postwar era when numerous academics denounced him as a fascist for his ideology's links to such ultranationalist figures as Nissho and Kita.

Some sections of the original ride's man-made river were reused for the log flume and troughs from the float trip and Silver Dollar City left the rest for scenery. A large portion of the ride‚Äôs channel are no longer used, however they still exist and are used as theme in Wildfire‚Äôs overflow queue-line. After the boat leaves the station it approaches an ominous looking tunnel. Theme The American Plunge‚Äôs theme is centered on Ozark daredevilry. The trip is a race to the plunge. Along the way you encounter others trying to beat you to the summit. Your opponents are facing obstacles of their own, tumbling off cliffs, broken boat and a whirlpool. You yourself become the hero by defying the plunge and turn into a legend. The American Plunge‚Äôs boats are themed as tonic barrels and can carry a total of six passengers. Rider experience Four to six riders enter the tonic shaped flumes. You first travel through a long dark tunnel. At the end of the tunnel water sprayers threaten to get riders wet but are timed to shut off right before you go through them. After coming out of the tunnel you go by different scenes, including a man that appears to be drowning. After all of the scenes, you go through a second tunnel, up a lift-hill, and down a steep drop into water. Then you slowly float around the exit path back into the station.

The vote took place at 2 am without public review or commentary and Governor Ed Rendell signed the bill into law. The raise increased legislators' base pay from 16% to 34% depending on position. Provisions The pay raise included a provision allowing legislators to take their raises immediately in the form of \\"unvouchered expenses.\\" This provision was included due to the Pennsylvania Constitution's clause prohibiting legislators from taking salary increases in the same term as which they are passed. State courts have ruled similar legislation to be constitutional on three separate occasions. Reaction Outrage over the pay raise was picked up by several influential state blogs like Grassrootspa and PennPatriot Blog. Advocacy groups spawned several grass-roots movements, some geared toward voting out incumbentshttp://www.pacleansweep.com/ and some seeking support for a Constitutional Convention or a reduction in the size of the legislature.http://www.whp580.com/Durginstuff.html The legislature repealed the pay raise after four months by a 50-0 vote in the senate and 197-1 vote in the house.Rosenthal, Alan. \\"Rooted in Their Districts.\\" Engines of Democracy: Politics and Policymaking in State Legislatures. Washington, DC: CQ, 2009. 105. Print. Political aftermath Protestors from PACleanSweep in front of the Pennsylvania State Capitol in 2005. The first victim of the public uproar was Supreme Court Justice Russell M. Nigro who became the first Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice to be denied retention. Nigro asserted that he had not taken part in the pay raise. However, critics noted that Chief Justice Ralph Cappy helped draft the bill and that prior Court opinions upheld such practices. On November 16, 2005, Governor Rendell signed a repeal of the pay raise after a near unanimous vote for repeal; only House Minority Whip Mike Veon voted against the repeal.Brown, David M. Veon's focal point of the pay raise race, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, 2006-05-06. Accessed October 24, 2012. Despite the repeal, a total of 17 legislators were defeated in the 2006 primary elections including Senate President Pro Tempore Robert Jubelirer and Senate Majority Leader David J. Brightbill. They were the first top-ranking Pennsylvania legislative leaders to lose a primary election since 1964. The November 2006 General Election claimed several more members who supported the pay raise including Republican representatives Gene McGill, Matt Wright, Tom Gannon and Matthew Good and Democrat Veon. The defeats were widely attributed to anger over the pay raise. Frank LaGrotta, who was defeated in the 2006 primary election over the pay raise issue, was one of many legislators who were paying back their unvouchered expenses in installments. After pleading guilty to two counts of conflict of interest for hiring relatives as \\"ghost employees,\\" he stopped repayment and was even refunded the amount that he had previously returned. Legacy In November 2009, Barbara McIlvaine Smith announced that she would not run for re-election in 2010, saying that she was frustrated with the progress of the post-pay raise reform movement. However, she ultimately did run for re-election in 2010 and lost to Republican challenger Dan Truitt.

The word caid originally referred to the ball which was used. It was made out of animal skin, with a natural bladder inside. Caid is believed to have influenced the modern sport of Gaelic football the rules of which were officially published in 1887 and is now organised and governed by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) as an amateur sport. There is some evidence that caid was taken around the world by the Irish diaspora, and some historians argue that it may have also played some part in the origins of Australian rules football, although such a relationship is controversial and the subject of debate. History The first recorded mention of football in Ireland was in 1308, when John McCrocan, a spectator at a football game at Newcastle, County Down, was charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard. Football games are mentioned in the Statute of Galway, 1527, which allowed the playing of football and archery, but banned \\"'hokie' -- the hurling of a little ball with sticks or staves\\", as well as other sports. The Sunday Observance Act of 1695 imposed a fine of one shilling for anyone found playing. Despite this, the earliest recorded football match in Ireland was one between Louth and Meath, at Slane, in 1712. Caid was especially popular in rural areas, such as the Dingle Peninsula of KerryThesis ‚Äì ‚ÄúTraditional game of Caid‚Äù, Father W. Ferris of Glenflesk, Killarney, Ireland. and Eigeen in west Cork. One observer in the mid-19th century, Father W. Ferris, described two main forms of caid during this period: the \\"field game\\" in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like goals, formed from the boughs of two trees, and; the epic \\"cross-country game\\" which took up most of the daylight hours of a Sunday on which it was played, and was won by one team taking the ball across a parish boundary. Both of these were rough and tumble contact sports in which \\"wrestling\\", pushing and the holding of opposing players was allowed. It was usually played by teams of unlimited numbers, representing communities, until a clear result was achieved or the players became too exhausted to continue. These games appear to have been similar to the traditional Welsh game of cnapan, which was played by teams of up to 1,000 men from adjacent parishes. Cnapan, however, was played with a hard ball and thus involved no kicking; it was strictly a game in which the ball was passed or smuggled from one player to another, with the object of getting it to the opposing team's parish church porch or to some other agreed destination. An inter parish mob football game similar to cnapan called Hyrl√Æan (In English Hurling) is still played in Cornwall on dates that coincide with religious festivals such as Shrove Tuesday. By the late 19th century, caid was in steep decline and was threatened with extinction, spurring the formation of the GAA which published official rules for the game in 1887 also adopting aspects of the earlier codified sport - hurling.

Drummond, 'Agar, Wilfred Eade (1882-1951)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 7, MUP, 1979, pp. 16-17 Private life Agar was born in Wimbledon, England. He was educated at Sedbergh School, Yorkshire, and at King's College, Cambridge, where he read zoology. He served at Gallipoli in World War I. His father was a solicitor and businessman and he was the first to find a hockey game in its modern form. In 1908 Agar had married Elizabeth MacDonald in Glasgow. Together with his family Agar lived on the university campus until his retirement in 1948, then they moved to Kew. Being retired he continued to do researches and write but was extremely worried about his poor health. He had suffered from a coronary thrombosis in 1947 and on 14 July 1951 he died at Kew; survived by his wife, two sons and three daughters, he was cremated. Career In 1904 Agar was declared as a demonstrator in zoology at University of Glasgow, where he put down roots in teaching and research. His work on the embryology of the lungfish Lepidosiren and Protopterus caused a fellowship at King's College, Cambridge; this did not make an impact on his leaving Glasgow, for he had to continue academic and research work. The work on Lepidosiren was very precious for him. The cells of this fish, being unusually large, offer favourable material for the study of chromosomes and in 1907, aided by grants from the Royal Society and the Balfour Fund at Cambridge, Agar made an expedition to the almost unreachable Gran Chaco, Paraguay, to collect material for cytological study. His intensive study of spermatogenesis in Lepidosiren represented critical confirmation that the chromosome mechanism could provide a physical basis for Mendel's laws. Another meaningful contribution to Mendelian theory arrived at his work on inheritance in parthenogenetic crustacea. He found out that apart from rare mutations, the genetic constitution of these crustacea remained unchanged, generation after generation. This work provided the first direct evidence from animals that the segregation of genes is according to the segregation of homologous chromosomes at meiosis. In 1919, he accepted the chair of zoology at the University of Melbourne; his notable projects concerned marsupial chromosomes and inheritance in cattle. Doing it, he was afraid of giving up most of his ambitions; his anxiety seemed justified when he realized that he was to give all the lectures and conduct a big amount of the laboratory classes without help. He successfully challenged the Lamarckian findings of William McDougall relating to the inheritance of the effects of training in rats. Agar offered the newer disciplines of cytology and genetics and these remained his principal teaching interest. However, his courses were the first of such kind in Australian universities. He established the studies on marsupial chromosomes and his paper on inheritance in cattle is considered to be the earliest in Australia to introduce genetical techniques to animal-breeding. From student days, Agar had taken an interest in the problem of Lamarckian inheritance. Like a majority of biologists he turned down the theory that acquired characters are inherited, but it kept on receiving support. The most crucial of Agar's contributions to this dispute was his repetition of an experiment which the psychologist William McDougall proclaimed had demonstrated the inheritance of the effects of training in rats. It was the most significant evidence published in support of the Lamarckian theory and not many criticisms treated it seriously weakened McDougall's claim. However, the results of Agar's properly checked the experiment, continued over twenty years, completely rejected the Lamarckian interpretation of McDougall's experiment. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1921. In 1938 Agar was elected president of the Eugenics Society of Victoria. He said \\"it was a disastrous state of affairs that size of families was usually in inverse ratio to intelligence.\\"The Age, 27 April 1938 Although Agar was retired, he devoted himself to administrative work at the university. He was a council-member during a great deal of years, twice dean of the faculty of science, and chairman of the professorial board in 1931-34, regulating the cogitations that happened before the appointment of a full-time vice-chancellor. His services to science and to the university were recognized by an O.B.E. in 1939 and a C.B.E. in 1948. Interests In his early years in Melbourne, Agar got interested in animal psychology and implemented experiments on the capacity to learn by experience of a range of animals from amoeba to crayfish and snails. These studies during a long period were a source of great enjoyment for him. They gave few publications but created in return for a background for his increasing preoccupation with wide biological concepts and the philosophy of science which was represented in A Contribution to the Theory of the Living Organism (Melbourne, 1943; second edition, 1951). Agar devoted this book to undoubtedly his most important contribution to biological theory. The book was based on the system of Whitehead's philosophy of the organism and argued for a form panpsychism.A Contribution to the Theory of the Living Organism by W. E. Agar. (1953). A. R. Bios. Vol. 24, No. 1. pp. 63-64. Awards Agar was awarded the Clarke Medal by the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1944 and elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society Agar's scientific achievements were greatly recognized. His scholarship and balanced judgment gained him the respect and faith of his colleagues,students and acquaintances. His distinctive traits of character were kindness, determination and courtesy. Except of his scientific interests, he was deeply interested in philosophy, enjoyed poetry and drama and sometimes drew some water-colour sketching. Agar Street in the Canberra suburb of Bruce was dedicated in his name.

Karaikal (about 16 km north of Nagappattinam and 12 km south of Tarangambadi) is the regional headquarters. Karaikal district is made up of the Communes of Karaikal, Kottucherry, Nedungadu, Tirunallar, Neravy and Tirumalarajanpattinam. History ;Early History This Karaikal area formed an integral part of the Pallava kingdom in the eighth century(C 731-796). Poet Sekkizhar (992-1042) describes the town as \\"vanga malik kadar karaikal\\", the 'Karaikal of many vessels on the coast' in his Peria puranam. In that the poet relates the life story of one Punithavathiar who abandoned the pleasures of material life and devoted herself entirely to a life of prayer and penance to signify her devotion to Lord Siva. He called her 'Karaikal Ammayar', conveniently after the town which must have been famous already. ;Medieval History In 1738, Dumas, a shrewd calculative prudent man and a lover of peace and above all one who was anxious to extend the French territory in India by smooth means, negotiated with Sahuji of Thanjavur for possession of Karaikal, the fortress of Karakalcheri and 5 village for 40000 chakras. On 14.2.1739 the French took possession of Karaikal town, the fort of Karakalcheri and 8 dependent villages. The King of Thanjavur raised the price for the town of Karaikal and the fort of Karakalcheri to 50000 chakras. He also demanded a loan of 150000 chakras without interest repayable in 3 years against the hypothecation of Mayavaram lands and an annual rent of 4000 pagodas for 5 villages. 8The French agreed to all the terms except for the payment of 150000 chakras which was reduced to 10000 chakras while the annual rental was reduce to two or three thousand chakras. The villages so received were Kilaiyur, Melaiyur, Puduthurai, Kovilpathu and Tirumalairayanpattinam. Subsequently, 2 villages were ceded to the French. Pratap Singh who succeeded the throne renewed demand for a loan of 100000 chakra and on receipt of the first instalment of 4000 chakras he assigned 8 more villages to the French viz., Codague (Kondagai), Vanjiyur, Arimullimangalam, Niravi, Dharmapuram, Uzhiapathu, Mattakudi (probably Mathalangudi) and Polagam. Then on 12-2-1740 he sold for 60000 chakras these villages which he had assigned only the previous year for 40000 chakras. The same year he pledged Thirunallar Mahanam for 55350 chakras and also pledged 33 villages for 60000 chakras. By a treaty signed on 12.1.1750 Pratap Singh ceded to the French 81 villages around Karaikal and cancelled the annual rent of 2000 pagodas payable for the villages. This was all the territory the French possessed around Thanjavur when they surrendered to the British in 1761. The territory then passed twice to the British control before it was finally handed over to the French in 1816/1817 under the Treaty of Paris, 1814. 1920s map of Karaikal ;Modern History The formation of Karaikal national congress on 13.6.1947 and Students Congress on 31.1.1947 symbolised the first concrete expression of popular desire in Karaikal for freedom from French rule. The French ruled this district till 31 October 1954 on which date the French flag flying atop the government house at Karaikal was lowered with due military honors before a large gathering of officials and non-officials. Thus the de facto transfer of power took place on 1 November 1954 followed by de jure transfer on 16 August 1962.

Woods and Alexander McQueen, who established a ferry across the Mokelumne River. The ferry enabled a new road to be routed between Stockton and Sacramento. In 1858 they built a wooden bridge at the site of the ferry which became known as Woods' Bridge, from which the community drew its name. Woods hoped that the settlement would grow larger than Stockton, and even hoped to form a separate county, Mokelumne County, with Woodbridge as the seat. In 1867, however, the railroad chose to bypass Woodbridge and lay tracks through neighboring Lodi instead.\\"Woodbridge: Orphan of the Railroads\\". From Raymond W.

This technique is used to prepare the falcon to become an independent hunter. The sequence of the procedure includes captivity, releasing, flight, and either the falcon will be recaptured for falconry or released into the wild. This has also been adapted to other raptor species to preserve the population. Generally, falconers agree that hacked falcons are better and more preferred in the field. Hacking is beneficial , not only for the falconers, but for the bird itself and the species; however, there are some criticism and restrictions that come along with this method. Procedure =Captivity= Hacking sites are usually large tracts of land. These areas have to be similar to the natural surroundings of a wild nest. The young raptors are put in a ‚Äúhack box,‚Äù boxes that contain a nest inside that protect them from predators and are usually placed on a high site, e.g. cliffs, atop poles. Eggs are either captive bred or taken from wild nests and the chicks are placed in the boxes a couple of weeks before they reach their fledge age of six weeks.The Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group. \\"Peregrine Falcon Release Methods.\\" http://www2.ucsc.edu/scpbrg/hacksite.htm (8 February 2010). Until then, the birds are closely looked after and provided food without too much human contact. =Releasing= The box is open after they have been in there for about 5 to 10 days,Shenandoah. \\"Falcon Hacking.\\" http://www.nps.gov/shen/naturescience/falconhacking.htm (8 February 2010). which gives them the freedom to do what they want around the box. However, they are not ready to fly yet. At this point they can climb down from their box, flap their wings to get a feel for the wind and exercise their muscles. Just as they would in the wild, the young stay close to the safe area. =Flight= The time until the first flight is taken should take about 3 days after the hack box is open, which should be a distance around a few dozen feet.Blue Falcon - Mark Robb. \\"Hacking.\\" http://www.gyrfalcons.co.uk/hacking.htm (8 February 2010). Afterwards, the young start to fly further away for a longer span. Hacking has an indefinite time period because it depends on the weather conditions and the personality of the bird. At this flying stage, the raptors learn how to self-hunt but are still fed and watched over. Males are more likely to hunt independently before females do. =After hacking= Once the falcons are confident and independent they are either allowed to migrate into the wild, recaptured for falconry and trained further i.e. with a lure for sport, or released into the wild. If the purpose of the hack is to prepare the raptor to be in the wild then the reserve hopes that the falcons will come back in a few years to nest there. Benefits * It gives an enhanced experience for young to grow into strong and skilled hunters. * During hack, the falcons receive more stimuli because the site is set up to mentally condition them, especially since there are other falcons to play and interact with. * The chicks are secured with safety and food. * They are given food even when they are becoming independent. * Hack boxes protect the young from predators * The caretakers limit contact so that the falcons will not rely too much on human resources if they are released into the wild. * The use of hacking helps preserve the population of any species of raptors. Criticism and restrictions * According to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, a law in the UK, one cannot disturb wildlife nests, which includes taking any eggs.Joint Nature Conservation Committee. \\"The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.\\" http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-1377 (8 February 2010). * Hacking is considered time consuming and unpredictable. * There are limited places to have hacking sites because of weather conditions and large spaces in good conditions are scarce. * Illnesses spread easily when birds are being hacked together, e.g. if one gets West Nile then the rest of them are prone to catch it. Tuesday, May 16, 2017 History Falconry has been a hunting sport since 2000 BC originating in ancient China and Egypt and since then the technique of hacking has been used and evolved. The term \\"hacking,\\" however, was not coined until the Elizabethan era. During that period, falconers brought a ‚Äúhack,‚Äù an old English word for a type of wagon, to a hilltop and placed young falcons upon it when they still did not know how to fly yet. There were over three-hundred breeding pairs of peregrine falcons before World War II in eastern United States. In the late 1940s, a large, abrupt decline of prey birds came about.Chesapeake Bay Field Office. \\"Peregrine Falcon: A Success Story.\\" http://www.fws.gov/chesapeakebay/Peregr.htm (8 February 2010). On top of the pre-WWII causes of gradual decrease of population (e.g. shooting of birds, egg collecting, predators, etc.), the main component to the downfall was the popular use of an insecticide called DDT. The product would be carried in the prey and kill the birds off and DDE, the by-product, would accumulate in a female's body causing the eggs produced by her to become fragile.Ohio Division of Life. \\"Life History Notes: Peregrine Falcons.\\" https://www.dnr.state.oh.us/Portals/9/pdf/pub080.pdf (8 February 2010). Because of this disruption, Peregrine falcons were officially on the federal endangered species list in 1970. Four years later, a program to restore the bird's population started in which they were bred in captivity. Breeders adapted the hacking technique so that the falcons and other endangered raptors could become independent once released into the wild. Additional hacking could even be conducted in urban areas when old nests, or eyries, were found atop buildings.

It is housed in an historical building designed by William George Storm in Corktown, in downtown Toronto, Ontario. The school has, on average, one hundred students and six teachers. It is located in the oldest continually-operated school building of the Toronto District School Board. In 1994, Inglenook Community High School was named an exemplary school by the Canadian Education Association.Canadian Education Association. Secondary Schools in Canada: The National Report of the Exemplary Schools Project. Toronto: Canadian Education Association, 1995.Canadian Education Association. The National Report and the 21 Case Studies of CEA's Exemplary Schools Project. CEA product catalogue. Toronto: Canadian Education Association, 1995. History In 1985 archaeologists digging on the school grounds uncovered clues regarding Toronto's history as a terminus of the Underground Railroad. Between 1834 and 1890 this site was the home of Lucie and Thornton Blackburn, refugee former slaves from Kentucky who started Toronto's first taxicab company. Twin plaques have been erected at this site and one in Louisville, KY. Inglenook is located in the oldest continually- operated school building in the Toronto District School Board. Originally Sackville Street School, it was designed by William G. Storm. The first principal of Sackville Street School (which replaced Palace Street School at the corner of Front and Cherry Streets) was Georgina Stanley Riches, who served from 1887 to 1912. At one time the school enrolled 269 students. In 1974, Sackville Street School closed and the building became home to both Inglenook Community High School and an aboriginal learning centre, which soon moved out. The school is said to be haunted. Mission and Framework Inglenook gives more power to the student body than the average Toronto school. The Committee on Evaluations, Academic Standards and Admissions (CEASA) is the school's disciplinary body. If corrective measures are required, two students and teachers meet with the pupils involved and attempt to rectify the situation. There are no detentions and no letters home. Students are responsible for attendance and schoolwork, which are mandatory. Overview Inglenook offers a program called Outreach, typically shortened to \\"Reach,\\" which is completed on Wednesdays in lieu of traditional courses. The other four schooldays each have a double period to make up for Wednesday's lost time. In Outreach, the student is expected to volunteer in the community for three hours a week. They then relate this experience to one of their academic courses by doing a tie-in project which receives a mark included in the final course grade. After the first semester, students can also perform an equivalent of Outreach, known as Inreach. This is still affiliated with a specific course, and a tie-in project is still completed, but instead of performing volunteer work the student can pursue an interest such as learning to paint, acquiring a new language, or writing a play. Inglenook features an open-access kitchen, which is cleaned (along with dishes from the classrooms and student lounge) by two hoppers after classes each day. Hoppers are two students who are chosen for duty on any particular day, and as it is rotational, each student will only have to clean once per semester. The school features a public art space named the \\"Inglenook Gallery\\". There is also a student lounge with furniture and books, and most of the classrooms contain couches.

It is listed on the London Stock Exchange as a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index History Serviced office space at Regus's first location in Brussels. IWG plc was incorporated as \\"Regus\\" in 1989 by British businessman Mark Dixon. In 1994, the five-year old company began an international expansion into Latin America and Asia and by 2000, it completed an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange. In 2001 it acquired Stratis Business Centers, a U.S.-based network of franchised business centres, and expanded into the United States market. The company acquired HQ Global Workplaces, a global workplace provider based in the U.S. in 2004. It went on to acquire Laptop Lane, a chain of American airport business centres, later that year. In 2002, the company sold a 58% stake in the UK business to Alchemy Partners in an 11th-hour rescue deal to avoid bankruptcy; the company bought the stake back three years later. In 2003 it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for its U.S. business, which had been struggling in the wake of the dot-com bubble. Less than a year later it took its U.S. business out of Chapter 11 after restructuring, financed by its share of the profitable U.K. business. A Regus business lounge in Berlin. In June 2008 Businessworld memberships were introduced, a multi-level service which allows users flexible access to services in any Regus location worldwide, intended for clients who travel frequently.\\"Regus Responds to Growing Need for Privacy Amongst Business Travelers with the Launch of Businessworld Membership Card Program\\" , Press release, June 16, 2008. The company renegotiated some leasing agreements with property owners in the U.K. to save money, warning owners that the vehicles holding the leases could go into administration (bankruptcy); this angered the British property industry. In 2013 the company opened serviced office spaces in its 100th country, Nepal, its 1,500th centre in Pune, India, and took control of MWB BE, the UK's second largest serviced office provider. In 2014, the company partnered with Swiss automaker Rinspeed to develop the \\"XchangE\\" concept automobile based on the Tesla Model S to help people work on the road. Exhibited at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show, the self-driving car has front seats that swivel backwards allowing four business travelers to meet face-to-face without a driver.

Regus plc was created as a holding company for Regus Group plc, in order to establish the company's headquarters in Luxembourg and its registered office in Jersey.\\"Admission and Listing of New Regus Ordinary Shares\\" , General notice, October 14, 2008. In December 2016, under a scheme of arrangement, the company established a new holding company called IWG plc. Spaces in La D√©fense, Paris IWG plc acquired Dutch coworking brand Spaces in 2015, expanding to approximately 200 locations in over 40 countries. In 2017, IWG plc went onto acquire rights to Stockholm-based members club No18 under a franchise agreement with plans to expand globally. Late in the year, Canada- based Brookfield Asset Management and Onex approached the company with an informal takeover proposal, but talks collapsed in 2018, resulting in a 23% decrease in share price. In April 2019, IWG plc sold Regus Japan as part of a ¬£320m franchise deal to meeting room rental business TKP Corporation. In November 2019, the company sold its entire Swiss operation for ¬£94m to a joint entity owned by Safra Group and real estate investors P. Peress Group. Operations, services, and competition IWG plc's serviced offices and coworking locations as of November 2019. Interactive version with location names and addresses. The company provides serviced offices, virtual offices, meeting rooms, and videoconferencing to clients on a contract basis. In the third quarter of 2018, it operated 3,348 locations in over 1,000 towns and cities across more than 120 countries, employing over 10,000 people, and providing services to over 2.5 million individual clients making it the world's largest provider of flexible workspace. The United States is currently IWG‚Äôs largest market. As of July 2018, IWG's occupancy rate was 75%. IWG brands include Regus, Spaces, HQ, Signature by Regus, and No18. IWG‚Äôs business strategy is focused on providing flexible workspaces as a service. One of the company's principal advantages is that their global network allows customers to coordinate office services across distant locations. A Regus office building hosted Microsoft's Denmark headquarters in 2006. Integration services for corporations seating employees at IWG locations involve a diverse set of support operations, such as telecommunications, mail delivery, catering, meeting rooms, lockers, printers, photocopiers, and the like. Regus in Richmond Hill, Ontario IWG competes with WeWork in both the large serviced offices and rapidly expanding coworking sectors. WeWork has only a tenth of IWG's locations, but a steeper growth rate and an 82% occupancy rate, gained from attracting a greater number of large organizations as clientele by sustaining losses offset against large but dwindling venture capital investments. WeWork lost more than $4,300 per desk in 2017 while IWG earned a profit of about $500 per desk. WeWork's larger market capitalization valuation is based on its larger growth rate, but its expenses are projected to grow even faster ‚Äî forcing it to withdraw from an initial public offering it had planned for 2019 ‚Äî while IWG's solvency is seen by analysts as more certain, according to the Financial Times.

It was founded in 1999 by Kristy Venrick of The Azoic, after Oneiroid Psychosis asked her to release their next album. Though she did not have a record label at the time, Oneiroid Psychosis was impressed by Kristy's success at promoting her own band. After considering the proposal, a year later, Kristy agreed and decided to begin Nilaihah Records. Since then, the label has grown considerably, signing other notable acts spanning a variety of electronic music styles, such as Unheilig, The Azoic, and Frozen Plasma. The label formed a partnership with the German label Infacted, serving as the North American outlet for European bands like Ad Inferna, XP8, NamNamBulu, Conetik, Endanger, and Liquid Divine, signing them to distribution deals. The label had a successful joint venture with Infacted on Muscle and Hate, a tribute to Nitzer Ebb featuring members of XP8 and Icon of Coil.

Typically, integrated circuits are produced in large batches on a single wafer of electronic-grade silicon (EGS) or other semiconductor (such as GaAs) through processes such as photolithography. The wafer is cut (diced) into many pieces, each containing one copy of the circuit. Each of these pieces is called a die. There are three commonly used plural forms: \\"dice\\", \\"dies\\" and \\"die\\". To simplify handling and integration onto a printed circuit board, most dies are packaged in various forms.  Manufacturing process  Most dies are composed of silicon and used for integrated circuits. The process begins with the production of monocrystalline silicon ingots. These ingots are then sliced into disks with a diameter of up to 300mm. From Sand to Silicon ‚ÄúMaking of a Chip‚Äù Illustrations. (n.d.) These wafers are then polished to a mirror finish before going through photolithography. In many steps the transistors are manufactured and connected with metal interconnect layers. These prepared wafers then go through wafer testing to test their functionality. The wafers are then sliced and sorted to filter out the faulty dies. Functional dies are then packaged and the completed integrated circuit is ready to be shipped.  Uses  A die can host many types of circuits. One common use case of an integrated circuit die is in the form of a Central Processing Unit (CPU).

The N1-glycosidic bond to adenine is what distinguishes cADPR from ADP-ribose (ADPR), the non-cyclic analog. cADPR is produced from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) by ADP-ribosyl cyclases (EC 3.2.2.5) as part of a second messenger system. Function cADPR is a cellular messenger for calcium signaling. It stimulates calcium-induced calcium release at lower cytosolic concentrations of Ca2+. Primary target of cADPR is the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ uptake mechanism. Potentiation of Ca2+ release by cADPR is mediated by increased accumulation of Ca2+ in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Metabolism cADPR and ADPR are synthesized from NAD+ by the bifunctional ectoenzymes of the CD38 family (also includes the GPI-anchored CD157 and the specific, monofunctional ADP ribosyl cyclase of the mollusc Aplysia). The same enzymes are also capable of hydrolyzing cADPR to ADPR. Catalysis proceeds via a covalently bound intermediate. The hydrolysis reaction is inhibited by ATP, and cADPR may accumulate. Synthesis and degradation of cADPR by enzymes of the CD38 family involve, respectively, the formation and the hydrolysis of the N1-glycosidic bond. In 2009, the first enzyme able to hydrolyze the phosphoanhydride linkage of cADPR, i.e. the one between the two phosphate groups, was reported. The SARM1 enzyme also catalyzes the formation of cADPR from NAD+.

It is located in eastern Monroe and western Juneau counties, near the village of Camp Douglas. A unit of the Ice Age National Scientific Reserve, the park protects several prominent sandstone bluffs to high that formed as sea stacks 12,000 years ago in Glacial Lake Wisconsin. As a result, these bluffs are steep and angular, dissimilar to the rounded terrain more typical of the eastern half of the United States. The bluffs served as landmarks to both early pioneers and travelers today on Interstate 90/94, which passes through the park. Geography There are ten named bluffs in the park. Mill Bluff, high, is between the interstate and U.S. Route 12. The park office is at its foot, and the campground is just to the west. Bee Bluff, although smaller and only high, is the most visible bluff from the interstate, as it stands adjacent to the westbound lanes. To the north is Camels Bluff, two separate outcroppings that together resemble the humps of a camel. Nearby are Devil's Monument and a high pinnacle called Cleopatra's Needle. The other, less accessible bluffs are Round Bluff and Sugar Bowl Bluff to the south, Wildcat Bluff and Bear Bluff to the north, and Long Bluff to the northeast. Also in the northeast is Ragged Rock, an tall former bluff whose protective cap was worn away and is eroding into a conical mound. Natural history The bluffs in the park, and others nearby, are formed of Late Cambrian sandstone. Stratigraphically, the stone of the bluffs is part of the Galesville Member of the Dresbach Group. Sandstone from the Ironton Member of the Franconia Formation, which is more solidly concreted, tops each bluff. This capping layer helped protect the softer stone below it from erosion. Similar structures elsewhere in Wisconsin would have been bulldozed away by glaciers, but these bluffs lie in the Driftless Area; that part of the American Midwest which was never glaciated. The bluffs are all outliers of the Franconia Cuesta to the south. During the last ice age a tongue of ice dammed the Wisconsin River, causing the water to back up into Glacial Lake Wisconsin. It is estimated that the lake was about deep in this area, so the taller bluffs became islands while the shorter ones would have been entirely underwater. For the 3000 years of the lake's existence waves eroded the edges of the bluffs, giving them their distinctive steep sides. Thus in a geological sense the bluffs are sea stacks because they formed in a body of water. In practice the larger formations are described as mesas, the medium-sized ones as buttes, and the smallest as a pinnacle. The flat ground in the park consists of finely sorted sediments that settled to the bottom of Glacial Lake Wisconsin. Glacial erratics have been found on the former lakebed, which are explained as rocks which were embedded in icebergs that melted as they were floating in the lake. The park is mostly forested, with northern pin oak, jack pine, red pine, eastern white pine, and white oak dominant. Cultural history Stairs built by the Works Progress Administration up Mill Bluff Several of the bluffs bear 400-year-old petroglyphs shaped like bird tracks, contemporaneous with the Roche-a-Cri Petroglyphs in Roche-a-Cri State Park. The diaries and journals of west-bound settlers often mention these bluffs. A sawmill was operated in the vicinity, after which Mill Bluff was named. Mill Bluff and a small area at its foot was proclaimed a state park on August 13, 1936. Mill Bluff State Park was added to the Ice Age National Scientific Reserve in May 1971. The park's boundaries were expanded to include the other bluffs later. In 2002 a portion of the park containing all of the major bluffs received a further level of protection as Mill Bluff State Natural Area. Recreation Mill Bluff State Park's swimming pond Mill Bluff State Park is open from May to September. Small game hunting is permitted in sections of the park from November 1 to December 15, and deer hunting during a shorter period. The park's small campground has 21 sites, 6 with electrical hookups. Amenities are primitive, with pit toilets and no showers. Potable water is available from hand pumps. Swimming is available in a spring-fed lake south of the campground. Sand has been added to make a beach. A nature trail circles the base of Mill Bluff. 223 stone steps built by the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s lead to its top. north on County Road W (Funnel Road) is a pullout for the Camels Bluff loop trail, which passes between the two sections of Camels Bluff and leads past the base of Devils Monument and Cleopatra's Needle. Because the bluffs are formed of soft sandstone and geologically unique, all climbing is prohibited. References *Black, Robert F. Geology of the Ice Age National Scientific Reserve of Wisconsin.

A seismic source can be simple, such as dynamite, or it can use more sophisticated technology, such as a specialized air gun. Seismic sources can provide single pulses or continuous sweeps of energy, generating seismic waves, which travel through a medium such as water or layers of rocks. Some of the waves then reflect and refract and are recorded by receivers, such as geophones or hydrophones.R.E. Sheriff (2002) p160 & p 182 Seismic sources may be used to investigate shallow subsoil structure, for engineering site characterization, or to study deeper structures, either in the search for petroleum and mineral deposits, or to map subsurface faults or for other scientific investigations. The returning signals from the sources are detected by seismic sensors (geophones or hydrophones) in known locations relative to the position of the source. The recorded signals are then subjected to specialist processing and interpretation to yield comprehensible information about the subsurface.R.E. Sheriff (2002) p312 Source model A seismic source signal has the following characteristics: # Generates an impulse signal # Band-limited # The generated waves are time-varying The generalized equation that shows all above properties is: :s(t)=\\\\beta e^{-\\\\alpha t^2} \\\\sin(2 \\\\pi f_{max} t) where f_{max} is the maximum frequency component of the generated waveform.Seismic Wave Propagation Modeling and Inversion, Phil Bording Types of sources =Hammer= The most basic seismic source is a sledge hammer, either striking the ground directly, or more commonly striking a metal plate on the ground, known as hammer and plate. Useful for seismic refraction surveys down to about 20 m below surface. =Explosives= Explosives most widely used as seismic sources are known as gelatin dynamites. These dynamites are placed into three subcategories, straight gelatins in which nitroglycerin, also known as glyceryl trinitrate with the chemical formula C3H5(ONO2)3 is the active component, ammonia gelatins in which ammonia nitrite with chemical formula NH‚ÇÑNO‚ÇÉ as the active component, and semi gelatins in which the composition consists mostly of nitroglycerin. Upon detonation, explosives release large volumes of expanding gas very quickly, forcing great pressure to the surroundings in the form of seismic waves. Using explosives as seismic sources has been in practice for decades because of the reliability and energy efficiency they provide. Such sources are most commonly used on land and swampy environments because of high thickness in sediments. Typical charge sizes used in the field for reflection surveys are 0.25 kg to 100 kg for single hole sources, 0.25 kg to 250 kg or more for multiple hole sources, and may reach 2500 kg or more for refraction surveys. Though dynamites and other explosives are efficient seismic sources because of their reduced costs, ease of transport in difficult terrains, and lack of regular maintenance compared to other sources, the use of explosives is becoming restricted in certain areas, causing decline and increasing popularity for alternative seismic sources. For instance, hexanitrostilbene was the main explosive fill in the thumper mortar round canisters used as part of the Apollo Lunar Active Seismic Experiments.NASA reference publication Generally, the explosive charges are placed between below ground, in a hole that is drilled with dedicated drilling equipment for this purpose. This type of seismic drilling is often referred to as \\"Shot Hole Drilling\\". A common drill rig used for \\"Shot Hole Drilling\\" is the ARDCO C-1000 drill mounted on an ARDCO K 4X4 buggy. These drill rigs often use water or air to assist the drilling. =Air gun= An air gun is used for marine reflection and refraction surveys. It consists of one or more pneumatic chambers that are pressurized with compressed air at pressures from 14 to 21 MPa (2000 to 3000 lbf/in2). Air guns are submerged below the water surface, and towed behind a ship. When an air gun is fired, a solenoid is triggered, which releases air into a fire chamber which in turn causes a piston to move, thereby allowing the air to escape the main chamber and producing a pulse of acoustic energy.R.E. Sheriff (2002) p6-8 Air gun arrays may consist of up to 48 individual air guns with different size chambers, fired in concert, the aim being to create the optimum initial shock wave followed by the minimum reverberation of the air bubble(s). Air guns are made from the highest grades of corrosion resistant stainless steel. Large chambers (i.e., greater than 1 L or 70 cu in) tend to give low frequency signals, and the small chambers (less than 1 L) give higher frequency signals. =Plasma sound source= Plasma sound source fired in small swimming pool A plasma sound source (PSS), otherwise called a spark gap sound source, or simply a sparker, is a means of making a very low frequency sonar pulse underwater. For each firing, electric charge is stored in a large high-voltage bank of capacitors, and then released in an arc across electrodes in the water. The underwater spark discharge produces a high-pressure plasma and vapor bubble, which expands and collapses, making a loud sound.R.E. Sheriff (2002) p328 Most of the sound produced is between 20 and 200 Hz, useful for both seismic and sonar applications. There are also plans to use PSS as a non-lethal weapon against submerged divers. =Thumper truck= Thumper trucks, Noble Energy, northern Nevada 2012. In 1953, the weight dropping thumper technique was introduced as an alternative to dynamite sources. Vibroseis Vibroseis 2 A thumper truck (or weight-drop) truck is a vehicle-mounted ground impact system which can be used to provide a seismic source. A heavy weight is raised by a hoist at the back of the truck and dropped, generally about three meters, to impact (or \\"thump\\") the ground.R.E. Sheriff (2002) p357 To augment the signal, the weight may be dropped more than once at the same spot, the signal may also be increased by thumping at several nearby places in an array whose dimensions may be chosen to enhance the seismic signal by spatial filtering. More advanced thumpers use a technology called \\"Accelerated Weight Drop\\" (AWD), where a high pressure gas (min 7 MPa (1000 lbf/in2)) is used to accelerate a heavy weight hammer () to hit a base plate coupled to the ground from a distance of . Several thumps are stacked to enhance signal to noise ratio. AWD allows both more energy and more control of the source than gravitational weight-drop, providing better depth penetration, control of signal frequency content. Thumping may be less damaging to the environment than firing explosives in shot-holes, though a heavily thumped seismic line with transverse ridges every few meters might create long-lasting disturbance of the soil. An advantage of the thumper (later shared with Vibroseis), especially in politically unstable areas, is that no explosives are required. =Electromagnetic Pulse Energy Source (Non- Explosive)= EMP sources based on the electrodynamic and electromagnetic principles. =Seismic vibrator= A seismic vibrator propagates energy signals into the Earth over an extended period of time as opposed to the near instantaneous energy provided by impulsive sources. The data recorded in this way must be correlated to convert the extended source signal into an impulse. The source signal using this method was originally generated by a servo- controlled hydraulic vibrator or shaker unit mounted on a mobile base unit, but electro-mechanical versions have also been developed. The \\"Vibroseis\\" exploration technique was developed by the Continental Oil Company (Conoco) during the 1950s and was a trademark until the company's patent lapsed. =Boomer sources= Boomer sound sources are used for shallow water seismic surveys, mostly for engineering survey applications. Boomers are towed in a floating sled behind a survey vessel. Similar to the plasma source, a boomer source stores energy in capacitors, but it discharges through a flat spiral coil instead of generating a spark. A copper plate adjacent to the coil flexes away from the coil as the capacitors are discharged. This flexing is transmitted into the water as the seismic pulse.Sheriff R. E., 1991, Encyclopedic Dictionary of Exploration Geophysics, Society of Exploration Geophysicists, Tulsa, 376p Originally the storage capacitors were placed in a steel container (the bang box) on the survey vessel. The high voltages used, typically 3,000 V, required heavy cables and strong safety containers. Recently, low voltage boomers have become available.Jopling J. M., Forster P. D., Holland D. C. and Hale R. E., 2004, Low Voltage Seismic Sound Source, US Patent No 6771565 These use capacitors on the towed sled, allowing efficient energy recovery, lower voltage power supplies and lighter cables. The low voltage systems are generally easier to deploy and have fewer safety concerns. =Noise sources= Correlation-based processing techniques also enable seismologists to image the interior of the Earth at multiple scales using natural (e.g., the oceanic microseism) or artificial (e.g., urban) background noise as a seismic source.R.E. Sheriff (2002) p295 For example, under ideal conditions of uniform seismic illumination, the correlation of the noise signals between two seismographs provides an estimate of the bidirectional seismic impulse response.

Life cycle Eggs (infertile, collapsed) The first instar larva is orange, with a black band surrounding the middle segments, and with a black head capsule. At the first moult, the second instar larva is green with yellow/orange tubercles, a brown head capsule, and some black markings behind the head and upon the rear claspers and anal flap. At the third instar, the dark marks behind the head capsule diminish and larvae develop fine white dot patterning across their skin. Larvae rest in a position where the anterior end of the body is held free of the substrate, such as a leaf or a stem. Males finish development a few days earlier than females in larval and pupal stages because they are smaller. Pupae are dark brown with a transparent window area between compound eye covers. Cocoons are irregular in shape and have a papery texture. They are light brown with a glossy sheen, and have a pre-formed exit opening at the anterior end. Adults push out of their flimsy cocoons with ease. 45 minutes after emergence, wing expansion is complete. Once the forewings have completely expanded, tail expansion begins. Females fly after their wings have hardened. Females emit pheromones and mate after their first flight.Peigler, R. S. (1984). The life-history of Actias maenas (Saturniidae). Journal of the Lepidopterists' Society, 38(2), 114-123. Sexual dimorphism Adult Actias maenas exhibit striking sexual dimorphism. Adult males are bright yellow and have purplish-brown markings, while adult females are light green in color.Peigler, R. S. (1984). The life-history of Actias maenas (Saturniidae).

In the United States it was sold using the Quasar brand and marketed under the name \\"The Great Time Machine\\" to exhibit its time-shifting capabilities, since VX machines had a companion electro-mechanical clock timer for timed recording of television programs. In Japan, the VX-100 model was launched in 1975, with the VX-2000 following in 1976. The first and only model sold in North America was the Quasar VR-1000 (based on the Panasonic VX-2000), with the VT-100 timer. Design The VX cassette itself had both reels of magnetic tape stacked on top of each other in a coaxial fashion (much like the earlier Philips \\"VCR\\" and Cartrivision formats) in the bottom half of the tape, with a circular opening on the underside of the top half of the cassette, where the video head drum would enter. The tape in this opening was pre-formed in a loop to go around the head drum, eliminating the need for the tape to be pulled out of the cassette and threaded around the drum (as with later videocassette formats such as VHS and Betamax). The opening was protected by a cylindrical plastic plug to protect the tape, which was unscrewed from the opening when the tape was loaded in the machine (by means of moving a horizontal lever on the front of the machine), and inserted back into the tape when ejected (by moving the lever back). The video head drum itself of a VX machine also has the unique distinction of being completely removable and replaceable without any special tools or equipment. The drum has a knurled nut on top, which can be adjusted by hand, allowing the drum to be removed from the deck for cleaning or replacement. To this date, the VX machines have been the only VCR designed with this feature.

Life and work Although born in Felixstowe, Lewis was brought up in Birmingham and educated at King Edward's School. After studying at University College, Oxford, earning his BA in 1934, he went on to study at the London School of Economics. He began his career as an economist, but after serving as an editor on the journal, Statist, he became interested in journalism. He took a sabbatical in 1938 to travel to Australia and India. He married Christine Tew in 1939, after returning to England. They had two daughters. Beginning in July 1939 he collaborated with Randal Heymanson to produce a newsletter called Vital News that they distributed confidentially to British and American government policymakers and bankers until December 1941. From 1943 to 1946, he worked for the Peking Syndicate, a firm specialising in investments in China, but left to work as a journalist for the weekly, Scope. Hired by the Economist magazine, he served as its Washington, DC correspondent from 1952 to 1961. He settled full-time in England in 1961, where he became a feature writer for The Times, remaining with the newspaper until he retired in 1971. In 1957 he had set up the Keepsake Press, initially to hand print family ephemera. He soon began serious, though small-scale, production and by the time infirmity forced him to discontinue in 1990 he had brought out over a hundred titles. The majority of the books that Lewis wrote or edited, often jointly, were nonfiction and closely related to his journalism. However, he is best known for his 1960 novel The Evolution Man, which went through six editions under a number of titles. This comic novel purports to be a first- hand account by the son of the first man to discover fire. To prevent further 'advances', the family takes matters in hand, leading to a conclusion given away by the book's eventual subtitle, 'how I ate my father'. Continuing authorship into old age, Lewis published a second novel in 1990, the same year that a play of his on William Shakespeare was performed in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe,Palpi #29, London, December 1991, p. 3 followed by a novella in 1991 and a further novel in 1995. All three of these later fictions were provocative reinterpretations of Victorian times.

This suborder is paraphyletic in relation to the Pterodactyloidea, which arose from within the Rhamphorhynchoidea, not from a more distant common ancestor. Because it is not a completely natural grouping, Rhamphorhynchoidea is not used as a formal group in most scientific literature, though some pterosaur scientists continue to use it as an informal grouping in popular works, such as The Pterosaurs: From Deep Time by David Unwin, and in some formal studies. Rhamphorhynchoids were the first pterosaurs to have appeared, in the late Triassic Period (Norian age, about 210 million years agoButler, R.J., Barrett, P.M., and gower, D.J. (2009). \\"Postcranial skeletal pneumaticity and air-sacs in the earliest pterosaurs.\\" Biology Letters, 5(4): 557‚Äì560. ). Unlike their descendants the pterodactyloids, most rhamphorhynchoids had teeth and long tails, and most species lacked a bony crest, though several are known to have crests formed from soft tissue like keratin. They were generally small, with wingspans rarely exceeding 2.5 meters, though one species alluded to by Alexander Stoyanow might be among the largest pterosaurs of all time with a wingspan of 10 meters, comparable to the largest azhdarchids.Why the giant azhdarchid Arambourgiania philadelphiae needs a fanclub Nearly all had become extinct by the end of the Jurassic Period, though least one anurognathid genus, Dendrorhynchoides, persisted to the early Cretaceous.

It catalyzes the conversion of lysine molecules into highly reactive aldehydes that form cross-links in extracellular matrix proteins. Its inhibition can cause osteolathyrism, but, at the same time, its upregulation by tumor cells may promote metastasis of the existing tumor, causing it to become malignant and cancerous.  Structure  In the yeast strain Pichia pastoris, lysyl oxidase constitutes a homodimeric structure. Each monomer consists of an active site that includes a Cu(II) atom coordinated with three histidine residues as well as 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenalanine quinone (TPQ), a crucial cofactor. In humans, the LOX gene is located on chromosome 5 q23.3-31.2. The DNA sequence encodes a polypeptide of 417 amino acids, the first 21 residues of which constitute a signal peptide, with a weight of approximately 32 kDa. The carboxyterminus contains the active copper (II) ion, lysine, tyrosine, and cysteine residues that comprise the catalytically active site. The three-dimensional structure of human lysyl oxidase has not yet been resolved.  Mechanism  The mechanism of lysyl oxidase occurs via modification of the Œµ-amino group of a lysine side chain. The enzyme falls into the category of quinone-containing copper amine oxidases, and the reaction is highly dependent on the cofactor lysyl tyrosylquinone (LTQ). The LTQ cofactor is unique among quinones due to its ortho/benzoquinone structure and neutral charge under physiological pH. This can be contrasted with the similar ubiquitous quinocofactor TPQ, which exists as a negatively charged structure under physiological conditions and includes ortho/para-carbonyl resonance functionality. LTQ is crucial in LOX- catalyzed conversion of lysine residues to Œ±-aminoadipidic-Œ¥-semialdehydes, generally referred to as allysines. In the oxidation of lysine, the Œµ-amine is first converted to a Schiff base via reaction with LTQ. While LTQ is still bound to the substrate, rate-limiting removal of the Œµ-proton yields an imine intermediate. Subsequent hydrolysis of the imine leads to release of the aldehyde product, allysine. Molecular oxygen and the copper ion are utilized to reoxidize the cofactor and yield another imine, producing hydrogen peroxide as a side product. Additional hydrolysis releases ammonia and the original cofactor, completing the catalytic cycle.  Biological function  Lysyl oxidase is an extracellular copper-dependent enzyme that catalyzes formation of aldehydes from lysine residues in collagen and elastin precursors. These aldehydes are highly reactive, and undergo spontaneous chemical reactions with other lysyl oxidase-derived aldehyde residues, or with unmodified lysine residues. This results in cross-linking collagen and elastin, which is essential for stabilization of collagen fibrils and for the integrity and elasticity of mature elastin. Complex cross-links are formed in collagen (pyridinolines derived from three lysine residues) and in elastin (desmosines derived from four lysine residues) that differ in structure. The importance of lysyl oxidase-derived cross-linking was established from animal studies in which lysyl oxidase was inhibited either by nutritional copper-deficiency or by supplementation of diets with Œ≤-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), an inhibitor of lysyl oxidase. This resulted in lathyrism, characterized by poor bone formation and strength, hyperextensible skin, weak ligaments, and increased occurrence of aortic aneurysms. These abnormalities correlated well with decreased cross-linking of collagen and elastin. Developmentally, reduced lysyl oxidase levels have been implicated in Menkes disease and occipital horn syndrome, two X-linked recessive disorders characterized by a mutation in a gene for copper transportation. Thus, not only is LOX crucial to cardiovascular development, it is thought to play a major role in connective tissue development and may also be important in neurological function. Lysyl oxidase has also proven crucial to the development of the respiratory system and the skin, as collagen and elastin represent 50-60% of the composition of the lung, and 75% of the skin. In LOX double knockout models (Lox -/-), function of LOX was reduced by up to 80%, and the phenotype of the lungs resembles those of human patients with emphysema and dilated distal airways. Finally, lysyl oxidase plays a crucial role in the commitment step of adipocyte, or fat cell, formation from pluripotent stem cells during development. Its absence may lead to defects in the transforming growth factor beta superfamily of proteins, which control cell growth and differentiation.  Clinical significance  LOX expression is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), and, hence, LOX expression is often upregulated in hypoxic breast and head and neck tumors. Patients with high LOX-expressing tumors have poor overall survival. Furthermore, inhibition of LOX has been demonstrated to eliminate metastases in mice. Secreted LOX is responsible for the invasive properties of hypoxic cancer cells through focal adhesion kinase activity and cell-to-matrix adhesion. LOX may be required to create a niche permissive for metastatic growth and, thus, may be required for hypoxia-induced metastasis. In fact, recent research has shown overexpression of LOX as crucial to promoting tumor growth and metastasis in several cancers, including breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. LOX expression was also detected in megakaryocytes, or bone marrow cells responsible for the production of platelets. Data derived from a mouse model of myelofibrosis implicated LOX in bone marrow fibrosis. In a rodent model of breast cancer, a small-molecule or antibody inhibitors of LOX abolished metastasis. LOX secreted by hypoxic breast tumor cells crosslinks collagen in the basement membrane and is essential for CD11b+ myeloid cell recruitment. CD11b+ cells in turn adhere to crosslinked collagen and produce matrix metalloproteinase-2, which cleaves collagen, enhancing the invasion of metastasizing tumor cells. In contrast, LOX inhibition prevents CD11b+ cell recruitment and metastatic growth. In cells lacking TGF-Œ≤ receptors, a deficiency that is characteristic of lung cancer, lysyl oxidase is found in high concentrations. LOX immunostaining has revealed that high LOX expression is associated with high extent of carcinoma invasion in samples obtained from surgically removed lung adenocarcinomas. Additionally, LOX expression is an indicator of 5-year survival in patients, with a 71% chance of survival for patients with low LOX levels, compared to 43% for patients with high LOX levels. Thus, upregulation of lysyl oxidase is a predictor of poor prognosis in early-stage adenocarcinoma patients. Lysyl oxidase has been newly implicated in tumor angiogenesis, or blood vessel formation, both in vivo and in vitro. Subcutaneous tumor-derived LOX was shown to increase vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and secretion, which then promotes angiogenesis by phosphorylation of protein kinase B, or Akt, through platelet- derived growth factor receptor Œ≤ (PDGFRB). High levels of LOX were associated with high blood vessel density in patient samples. Clinically relevant LOX inhibitors may help slow cancer progression by downregulating crucial growth factors that promote solid tumor progression. Hence, inhibitors of the LOX enzyme may be useful in preventing angiogenesis, tumor progression, and metastasis as well as treating other fibrotic disease involving remodeling of the extracellular matrix, including neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases.

V-Cord (later referred to as V-Cord I) was released in 1974, and could record 60 minutes on a cassette. V-Cord II, released in 1976, could record 120 minutes on a V-Cord II cassette. The V-Cord II machines were the first consumer VCRs to offer two recording speeds. Appearance The original V-Cord cassette had a large hub and was wound with standard-thickness magnetic tape; V-Cord II used a small hub wound with thin tape, the same thickness later used for VHS-120 and Beta L-750. The cassettes were not rectangular, being tapered at one narrow end. Unlike subsequent formats VHS and Betamax, which loaded with the tape facing front on the long side of the cassette, the V-Cord cartridge was loaded sideways with the narrow side serving as the \\"front\\" and the tape coming out the \\"side\\". The tape was held in place in the machine by a notch halfway down the right side of the tape, similar to what holds an 8-track tape into its player. Operation The earliest machines recorded only in black and white and had no rewind mechanism, like the Cartrivision format of a few years earlier; an external rewinder was used after recording or playing a tape. External rewinders were later used with the VHS and Beta formats, although the machines could rewind tapes; external rewinders were considerably faster than the rewind function. Recording format The system had two recording modes: standard mode (STD), and a long- play mode (LP) which sacrificed recording quality for extra capacity. In STD mode both recording and playback heads are used, writing both fields of each interlaced video frame. In long-play mode only a single head is used to record a single field from each video frame, with each field being read twice on playback, in a \\"skip field\\" technique. The heads scanned the tape in a helical scan fashion Tape was moved forward at 2.91 inches per second in STD mode, and 1.45 inches per second in LP mode; this gave a recording time of one-hour in standard mode and two hours in long-play mode. Horizontal resolution in color was quoted as 250 lines in advertising materials, stretching to 300 lines in black-and-white, with a video signal-to-noise ratio of 45 dB. Audio response was specified as 80 to 10,000 Hz at -6 dB in STD mode, dropping to 80 to 8,000 Hz in LP mode. The tape was a half-inch cobalt doped tape with a 550 oersted coercivity. The cassette measured 4 \\" by 6 \\" by 1\\". Two cassette types were available, a V60 and a V120 whose names matched their recording capacity in LP mode. The cassettes are similar in appearance to eight-track cartridges. Conventional VHS and Beta formats recorded in a helical scan format, resulting in angled tracks running from the lower edge of the tape to the upper edge some distance down. Unlike these formats, the V-Cord format was closer to the 2-inch quadruplex videotape format used from the inception of video in the late 1950s until 2-inch helical IVC videotape format was introduced twenty years later, in that its tracks ran nearly perpendicular to tape travel. A portable four-head video recorder, the Sanyo VTC-7100, used a similar format of cassette, but produced incompatible recordings.

The Barnes family are competitors and sometimes enemies of the Ewing family. Cliff is the son of Willard \\"Digger\\" Barnes and Rebecca Barnes, the brother of Pamela Barnes Ewing, and half-brother of Katherine Wentworth. J.R. Ewing (played by Larry Hagman) was Cliff's personal nemesis, with Cliff and J.R. continuing on the bitter feud that started with their fathers, Digger Barnes and Jock Ewing, from their oil wildcatting days in the 1930s. Cliff and J.R. were the only two characters to appear throughout the entire run of the series. A running gag on the series is Cliff's fondness for Chinese take-out. History =Original series= During the show's original conception, the character of Cliff was modeled on the late Robert F. Kennedy. However, he evolved into a bumbling sad sack who was very much his own worst enemy. A lawyer and a bureaucrat, not an oil man, Cliff was out of his element when dealing in the cutthroat oil business and, despite repeated attempts, would always be outsmarted and outdone by J.R. Ewing (Larry Hagman), his lifelong rival. Thanks to Carter McKay (George Kennedy), Cliff finally beats J.R. in the final season, and takes over Ewing Oil. Cliff had a close relationship with his sister, Pamela (Victoria Principal) and hated that she married Bobby Ewing (Patrick Duffy), J.R.'s younger brother. When Dallas began, Cliff worked for the state of Texas, building an impressive recorded reputation as investigator of corruption within the independent oil companies. It was no coincidence that these investigations often cited or targeted Ewing Oil. During the second and third seasons, Cliff's career took an upward swing when he was appointed Chief of the Office of Land Management, a fictional enormously powerful state agency that coordinated and approved all ventures that affected the surface and geological texture of Texas land, including oil drilling permits. In an attempt to lure Barnes out of this powerful position, J.R. Ewing enlisted attorney Alan Beam (Randolph Powell) in a scheme to form an exploratory funding committee (funds solely provided by J.R. Ewing) promoting Barnes as a candidate for the U.S. Congress. The scheme worked as Barnes resigned from his position to run for Congress. After his resignation, the money flow to the campaign stopped and Barnes was forced to drop out of the race. Cliff had an affair with J.R.'s wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) during the second season of Dallas. When Sue Ellen became pregnant, it was believed Cliff was the father of her baby. After a dizzy spell sent Digger (Keenan Wynn) to the doctor, he was diagnosed as a carrier of neurofibromatosis, a genetic disorder which he'd passed on to Cliff. As neurofibromatosis poses a greater threat to infants than to adults, the doctor strongly advised them not to have children. Cliff was worried that John Ross III (Tyler Banks) might develop the potentially fatal disease, but Bobby and Pam convinced him to keep quiet. They all decided to monitor the baby's health until he passed a critical age. After Cliff was forced to drop out of the Congressional race, he quickly figured out that J.R. had been behind the plot and vowed revenge. When a newspaper reporter interviewed Digger about Cliff's resignation, he told her that Cliff was really the father of John Ross III. Cliff realized that the scandal would embarrass J.R. and sued for custody. In order to prove paternity, blood tests had to be performed on Sue Ellen and J.R. The first test proved inconclusive, but a second DNA test confirmed that J.R. was John Ross III's father after all. In a major step backwards, Barnes took a position as a Dallas assistant district attorney. Shortly after taking the position, Barnes promoted the prosecution of Jock Ewing (Jim Davis) for a 30-year-old murder, which was dismissed after, ironically, Digger Barnes confessed to the murder on his deathbed. In season four, Cliff Barnes began working with state senator Dave Culver (Tom Fuccello), believing that Culver (the son of Sam Culver (John McIntire), a Texas and national political icon) would be destined for powerful office. During this time, Cliff also formed a \\"personal\\" relationship with Donna Culver (Susan Howard), who was Dave's most trusted advisor and the widow of Sam. Relations between Donna and Cliff soured and quickly ended when Dave was appointed to the U.S. Senate and Donna's party committee chose Bobby Ewing (instead of Barnes) to run for his vacant state senate seat. After Bobby won the senate race, he asked Barnes to be his chief senate counsel - although mostly as a favour to Pam. Cliff accepted but after a short tenure, they had a falling out over Cliff's decision (without consulting Bobby) to start a senate investigation against J.R. for alleged organization of a counter-revolution in Southeast Asia. In the course of the fourth season, Cliff's mother, Rebecca Wentworth (Priscilla Pointer) made a dramatic reentry into his life. After much debating, Cliff forgave her for her desertion. It also delighted Cliff that his mother was an important lady who was wealthy and powerful in her own right. Rebecca eventually offered him the presidency of Wentworth Tool & Die, a small subsidiary of Wentworth Industries, which made parts for oil rigs. Cliff happily accepted and did extraordinarily well for a time. Eventually Cliff asked for, and received, complete autonomy at Wentworth Tool & Die - but his fortunes took a dramatic downturn when he wasted Wentworth funds on a phony deal engineered by J.R. Cliff's mother subsequently sacked him - this, coupled with Sue Ellen's decision to remarry J.R around the same time, drove Cliff to attempt suicide. Cliff recovered, and Rebecca subsequently bought out Wade Luce Oil, renaming it Barnes-Wentworth Oil. Rebecca asked Cliff to run the company for her and he accepted - blaming J.R. for Cliff's suicide attempt, Rebecca encouraged Cliff to use the company (and the place in the Cartel which came with it) to gain revenge. Armed with a new lease on life, and a new hatred for the Ewings, he became driven to succeed, and as a result, turned Barnes-Wentworth into a very successful company. That year, Cliff won the coveted \\"Oil Man Of the Year\\" award at the Oil Baron's Ball. However, instead of enjoying his success he embarrassed himself by verbally trashing Jock Ewing and Ewing Oil during his acceptance speech, resulting in a huge brawl. Rebecca died soon after from injuries sustained in a plane crash, and Cliff inherited Barnes-Wentworth Oil, as well as a third of Wentworth Industries (much to the disgust of his half sister Katherine (Morgan Brittany). During the fifth season, Cliff and Sue Ellen became romantically involved again and he proposed marriage, however she turned him down and eventually remarried J.R. Cliff did find happiness again with aspiring singer Afton Cooper (Audrey Landers), the sister of Lucy Ewing's (Charlene Tilton) husband Mitch Cooper (Leigh McCloskey). It would later transpire that Afton gave birth to a daughter, Pamela Rebecca, after the end of her relationship with Cliff. At the start of the penultimate season, it was revealed that Pamela was indeed Cliff's daughter, although Afton, disgusted by Cliff's lying to her, tricked him into believing otherwise. Cliff married Jamie Ewing (Jenilee Harrison), daughter of the late Jason Ewing and therefore a cousin of J.R. and Bobby, in 1985, but the union was unhappy as Cliff having married Jamie purely for the inheritance he always believed to be his birthright. During the 1985-86 season they realized how much they loved one another and became close. In April 1986, Jamie was seen trapped in a blazing car and presumed dead. But the entire 1985-86 season turned out to be the nightmare of Cliff's sister Pam - meaning Cliff and Jamie's happy marriage and her supposed death were just a dream, and thus Cliff and Jamie never found happiness. She left him in fall 1986 and the union was headed for a divorce when Jamie was killed due to a fall while on a mountain climbing holiday. Cliff eventually realizes his dream of taking over a share of Ewing Oil and for a time enjoys a good personal and business relationship with Bobby, whilst J.R. is temporarily sidelined from the business. It is notable that Cliff and Bobby appear to find mutual respect and liking only after Pamela has gone and their family ties are effectively severed. Cliff is also shown at this time to be a loving and attentive uncle to Christopher (Joshua Harris), who is suffering from the absence of his mother. Cliff enjoys a seemingly open welcome to Southfork during this time, something that would have been unheard of in earlier seasons. J.R. eventually returned to Ewing Oil and while they were briefly able to coexist, it didn't last. J.R.'s maneuvering and Cliff's inattention to the business due to his attempts to win back Afton (\\"the only woman I ever loved\\") soon had Cliff falling out of favor once again with the Ewings. By the end of the series, the feud that had characterized much of Dallas's run was firmly back on. A theme of Cliff Barnes' character was social class conflict with his nemesis J.R. Ewing. Cliff had grown up poor in contrast to J.R. after the partnership between Cliff's father Digger and Jock Ewing dissolved, due in large part to Digger's heavy drinking. Jock went on to found Ewing Oil. Digger blamed Jock for his subsequent bad luck and was jealous of Jock's wealth. Cliff inherited Digger's resentment of the Ewings, and as well as the tendency to sometimes drink heavily. As time went on his hatred for the Ewings (with the exception of J.R.) dissipated, as Cliff realized that his father was not blameless in regards to the Barnes-Ewing feud. Throughout the series Cliff had a reputation for being cheap and naive in contrast to J.R. Whereas J.R. always dined in fine restaurants, wore a stylish Stetson, lived on Southfork and lavished his mistresses with generosity; Cliff often preferred take-out Chinese cuisine, wore cheap suits, lived in a condominium and assumed his romantic interests would clean his home. While J.R. was smooth talking and charismatic, Cliff tended to speak before he thought and frequently stuck his foot in his mouth. Much of the drama of Dallas was centered around Cliff's attempts to revenge himself against J.R. politically, romantically and financially. Typically, Cliff's schemes failed because of J.R.'s under-handed cleverness. Cliff eventually got one over J.R. shortly before the TV series ended when he took over Ewing Oil. In the series finale \\"Conundrum\\" in 1991, Cliff appears in J.R's dream where, with J.R. having never born, he was never pulled into the Barnes-Ewing feud. He became a lawyer who was married to a woman who loved him for himself, not his money, and had two grown children. He turns out to have become Vice President of the United States and at a party, learns the President has suffered a stroke and he will be soon taking office. =Dallas: J.R. Returns= Cliff appeared in the 1996 film Dallas: J.R. Returns, wherein after 5 years at Ewing Oil, he decides he has had enough of the oil business, and looks to sell. Initially making a deal with West Star head Carter McKay, he eventually sells the company to Bobby and Sue Ellen, effectively ending the feud with J.R. when he decides that reuniting with his family (Afton and his long-lost daughter Pamela) is more important than beating J.R. =Dallas (2012 TV series)= Cliff reappeared in the 2012 continuation of the series, which picks up 20 years after the original series concluded and ignores the events of the two 1990s TV movies. As the series begins, Cliff is involved in a casino business. He returns to Dallas and has a meeting with Bobby at Southfork Ranch. Cliff wants to buy Southfork, which Bobby has put up for sale. J.R. walks in on their conversation and warns Cliff against trying to buy the Ewing family home. Cliff later invites his adoptive nephew, Christopher, and his new wife, Rebecca, to dinner and expresses an interest in investing in Christopher's energy project. Christopher declines, as he thinks that Cliff just wants to antagonize the Ewings again; however, Cliff warns him not to let the Ewings destroy him like they did his adoptive mother, Pamela. When J.R. arrives at Sue Ellen's office to give her Miss Ellie's pearls, a good luck charm for her Texas gubernatorial campaign, Cliff arrives to take Sue Ellen to lunch to discuss politics. When questioned about trying to buy Southfork, Cliff announces, \\"I will never stop fighting for what is rightfully mine.\\" In addition, sometime between the end of the original series and the 2012 continuation, Cliff Barnes started a new company, Barnes Global, which owns hundreds of subsidiaries in over fifty countries. His desire to spite the Ewing family persists and Cliff eventually directs the bombing of a methane-extracting rig belonging to Ewing Energies, which results in the deaths of Christopher and Rebecca's two unborn children. As an aside, no mention was ever made of the neurofibromatosis gene that Cliff carries. Years before, he'd vowed never to have children, because he feared they could die of the disease. As the gene is passed from the carrier to their offspring, the risk that Rebecca or her children could suffer is high. The ensuing events result, at the end of season two, in the Ewings taking control of Barnes Global and folding it into a larger company known as Ewing Global, with Cliff sitting in a Mexican jail, charged with murdering J.R. Ewing. However, he managed to reach out to Elena Ramos and reveal more of J.R.'s nefarious business tactics. In a surprising twist, he revealed to Elena her father had been fleeced out of the land J.R. managed to profit off of by having the deed to part of his family's land and her father's land switched so Elena's father got the piece of land that lacked any oil. As her father lost his life trying to find oil on it and her brother trafficked drugs to purchase the land back from the Ewings, his revelation seemed to sway her. He told Elena to make the Ewings pay for J.R.'s sins against her family and gave her proxy over the one- third share of Barnes Global he still owned in the company. It is revealed in the season one finale that Christopher's wife known to him as Rebecca Sutter is actually Cliff's daughter Pamela, known in the original series as Pamela Rebecca Cooper. Cliff is shown to be behind Rebecca's attempt to hustle Christopher. Although Pamela had discovered the Ewings had set up Cliff for the murder of J.R., she had chosen to leave Cliff in prison because he had blown up the rig and caused her to lose her unborn children. She had however given him the deed to the land that Digger had deserved, only at the expense of not being able to enjoy it. Cliff was then left in prison. Legacy A restaurant in Stockholm's Vasastan district has operated under the name of the television character for at least two decades. In the 1980s, a German punk rock band went by the name Cliff Barnes and the Fear of Winning.

Clinton's main foreign policy advisors were Secretaries of State Warren M. Christopher (1993‚Äì97) followed by Madeleine Albright (1997‚Äì2001) in his second term. The Cold War had ended and the Dissolution of the Soviet Union had taken place under his predecessor President George H. W. Bush, whom Clinton criticized for being too preoccupied with foreign affairs. The United States was the only remaining superpower, with a military strength far overshadowing the rest of the world. Absent the Cold War, Clinton's main priority was always domestic affairs, especially the domestic economy. Foreign-policy took a backseat, except to promote American trade, and during unexpected emergencies. His emergencies had to do with humanitarian crises which raised the issue of American or NATO or United Nations interventions to protect civilians, or armed humanitarian intervention, as the result of civil war, state collapse, or oppressive governments. President George H. W. Bush had sent American troops on a humanitarian mission to Somalia in December of 1992. 18 of them were killed and 80 wounded in a botched raid, ordered by President Clinton, in October 1993. Public opinion, and most elite opinion, swung heavily against foreign interventions that risked the lives of American soldiers when American national interests were not directly involved. That meant humanitarian missions were problematic. Clinton agreed, and sent ground troops only once, to Haiti, where none were hurt. He sent the Air Force to do massive bombing in the former Yugoslavia, but no American crewmen were lost. The major trouble spots during his two terms were in Africa (Somalia and Rwanda) and Eastern Europe (Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Kosovo in the former Yugoslavia). Clinton also tried to resolve long-running conflicts in Northern Ireland, and the Middle East, particularly the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. Leadership As a campaigner for election, Clinton promised to devote his main attention to domestic policy, in contrast to what he called the overemphasis on foreign policies by his opponent George H. W. Bush. On taking office he told his top advisers he could only spare one hour a week meeting with them.Charles-Philippe David, \\"'Foreign Policy is Not what I Came Here to Do': Dissecting Clinton's Foreign Policy-making\\" (Center for United States Studies, Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al, 2004) online. However, Clinton had attended graduate school in England, and increasingly took a personal interest in foreign affairs, especially in his second term. His main foreign policy advisors were Secretaries of State Warren M. Christopher and Madeleine Albright and National Security Advisors Anthony Lake and Sandy Berger. Other key advisors include Secretary of Defense Les Aspin, and Strobe Talbott who as Ambassador at large dealt with Russia and India. Political scientist Stephen Schlesinger argues that Warren Christopher was: :a cautious, discreet, and patient counselor who, reflecting his habits as a corporate lawyer, made few very bold moves without his client's [Clinton's] prior approval....Albright, is a more outspoken, even swashbuckling, character, who tends to grab hold of issues and run with them--even if this means stepping on the feet of others in the administration or foreign officials. The result has been a more activist regime in the second term.Stephen Schlesinger, \\"The end of idealism\\" World Policy Journal (Winter 1998/99) 15#2:36-40 quoting p. 39. International trade Bill Clinton and Ambassador Harry Schwarz, who negotiated lifting the remaining sanctions on South Africa Realizing that increasing international trade would support Clinton's highest priority of economic growth, Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown led delegations of entrepreneurs, businessmen and financiers to South Africa, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, Egypt, Russia, Brazil, Argentina and Chile, China and Hong Kong, Ireland India and Senegal. He was on a trade mission to war-torn Yugoslavia in 1996 when they all died in an accidental plane crash. A special prosecutor was appointed when it was alleged that contributions to the Democratic Party enabled one to join the trade party.Shirley Anne Warshaw, The Clinton Years (2009), pp. 49-50, 254. Over its eight years in office, the administration signed 300 trade agreements with other countries.Clinton on Foreign Policy at University of Nebraska =China= The Chinese communist regime had crushed the pro-democracy movement at Tiananmen Square in 1989. President Bush voiced American outrage, but quietly reassured the Chinese that trade would continue. In the 1992 election campaign, Clinton criticized Bush for not punishing China more. As a presidential candidate Clinton adopted the position of congressional Democrats, who strongly attack Bush for prioritizing profitable trade over the promotion of human rights.Yuwu Song, ed., Encyclopedia of Chinese-American Relations (McFarland, 2009) pp 74‚Äì75. However, as President Clinton continued the Bush trade policies. Clinton's highest priority was to maintain trade with China, boost American exports, expand investment in the huge Chinese market, and create more jobs at home.John W. Dietrich, \\"Interest groups and foreign policy: Clinton and the China MFN debates.\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly 29.2 (1999): 280-296. online By granting China temporary most favoured nation status in 1993, his administration minimized tariff levels in Chinese imports. Clinton initially conditioned extension of this status on Chinese human rights reforms, but ultimately decided to extend the status despite a lack of reform in the specified areas of free emigration, no exportation of goods made with prison labor, release of Prince peaceful protesters, treatment of prisoners in terms of international human rights, recognition of the distinct regional culture of type at, permitting international television and radio coverage, and observation of human rights specified by United Nations resolutions.Song, ed., Encyclopedia of Chinese- American Relations p 74. In 1998, Clinton paid a friendly nine-day visit to China. Albright defended the trip by saying, \\"Engagement does not mean endorsement.\\" In 1999 Clinton signed a landmark trade agreement with China. The agreement‚Äìthe result of more than a decade of negotiations‚Äìwould lower many trade barriers between the two countries, making it easier to export U.S. products such as automobiles, banking services, and motion pictures. The Chinese citizens ability to afford and purchase U.S. goods should have been taken into consideration. However, the agreement could only take effect if China was accepted into the WTO and was granted permanent \\"normal trade relations\\" status by the U.S. Congress. Under the pact, the United States would support China's membership in the WTO. Many Democrats as well as Republicans were reluctant to grant permanent status to China because they were concerned about human rights in the country and the impact of Chinese imports on U.S. industries and jobs. Congress, however, voted in 2000 to grant permanent normal trade relations with China. In 2000, Clinton signed a bill granting permanent normal trade relations to China, and American imports from China massively increased in the subsequent years. Clinton's last treasury secretary, Lawrence Summers, argued that Clinton's trade policies were technically \\"the largest tax cut in the history of the world\\" in that they reduced prices on consumer goods by lowering tariffs.Address by Lawrence H. Summers, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury =NAFTA= In 1993 Clinton worked with a bipartisan coalition in Congress to overcome objections by labor union and liberal Democrats. They passed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that Bush had negotiated with Canada and Mexico in 1992. It joined the American, Mexican and Canadian economies in a free trade pact. It removed many restrictions of trade in agriculture, textiles, and automobiles, provided new protections for intellectual property, set up dispute resolution mechanisms, and implemented new labor and environmental safeguards. NAFTA cost jobs at first, but in the long run it dramatically increased the trade among the three countries. It increased the number of jobs in the United States, but unions complained that it lowered wage rates for some workers. However, unions blocked his 1997 and 1998 proposals to provide the president with the power to quickly negotiate trade liberalization pacts with limited congressional comment.James Shoch, \\"Contesting globalization: Organized labor, NAFTA, and the 1997 and 1998 fast-track fights.\\" Politics & Society 28.1 (2000): 119-150. Clinton's advocacy of trade agreements sparked a backlash on the left among opponents of globalization. A 1999 World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle, Washington, was overshadowed by major protests that descended into violence.Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St Clair, Five days that shook the world: Seattle and beyond (2000). International organizations The end of superpower rivalry had freed the UN and NATO and regional security institutions from their previous Cold War mind-set, and created new opportunities for them to play a more active, collective role. Despite international norms of state sovereignty and non-intervention, the idea that the international community should intervene in a country for the good of its own people gained greater legitimacy. International organizations such as the UN and regional security such as NATO, the OAS, and the OAU would play a role in bestowing legitimacy on the operations and in organizing a collective response. Domestically however, these new developments at the international level became enmeshed with a long-standing struggle between Congress and the president over war powers,See also: War Powers Clause, and War Powers Resolution and differences in treaties between domestic and international understandings of the term.Frederic L. Kirgis, International Agreements and U.S. Law , in ASIL Insights, May 1997, American Society of International LawSee also: Treaty Clause Which branch of government was to control the deployment of American troops occupied these debates almost as much as the merits of the individual interventions. These debates were not new, with the struggle over war powers being a constant feature of American foreign policy, especially since WWII when it first gained superpower status, joined international organizations, and signed its first mutual defense treaty in more than 150 years. Clinton would utilize both the multi-national cast and the explicit blessing of international organizations for support in most of these involvements. These largely humanitarian operations during his term met much more congressional opposition, and enjoyed less frequent congressional authorization, than did operations during the Cold War. This involvement suggests that the president had found international organizations to be a useful ally in part to decrease and to overcome the resistance of the national legislature. Africa =Somalia= In December 1992, President George H. W. Bush sent troops to Somalia, a coastal nation on the Horn of Africa.https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/05/world/mission-to-somalia-bush- declares-goal-in-somalia-to-save-thousands.html This intervention, called Operation Restore Hope, saw U.S. forces assuming the unified command in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 794 with the intent to facilitate airlifted humanitarian supplies and prevent the items from falling into the hands of regional warlords. Following Clinton‚Äôs assumption of the Presidency, his administration shifted the objectives set out in Operation Restore Hope and began pursuing a policy of attempting to neutralize the Somali Warlords, in particular Mohamed Farrah Aidid, as part of the second phase of the United Nations‚Äô intervention in the country, known as UNOSOM II. It was during UNOSOM II the Battle of Mogadishu occurred, resulting in the death of 19 American Servicemen. Following these deaths, the mission quickly lost popularity with the American people. Fearing chaos resulting in the starvation of Somalia's civilians and to help U.S. Forces defend themselves,White House Press Briefing on Somalia, October 7, 1993 Clinton increased troop presence in the country. The mission remained unpopular, however. Following a national security policy review session held in the White House on 6 October 1993, U.S. President Bill Clinton directed the Acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral David E. Jeremiah, to stop all actions by U.S. forces against Aidid except those required in self-defense. He reappointed Ambassador Robert B. Oakley as special envoy to Somalia in an attempt to broker a peace settlement and then announced that all U.S. forces would withdraw from Somalia no later than 31 March 1994. On 15 December 1993, U.S. Secretary of Defense Les Aspin stepped down, taking much of the blame for his decision to refuse requests for tanks and armored vehicles in support of the mission. American opinion became strongly opposed to sending American ground troops on combat missions, and while Clinton seemingly agreed, he continued sending US forces abroad, intervening in places such as Haiti, Yugoslavia, Sudan, and Iraq.William C.

Blind Spot: The Secret History of American Counterterrorism. New York: Basic Books. , page 266 =Rwanda= In April 1994, genocide in Rwanda erupted due to a long-standing conflict between the majority Hutu and dominant Tutsi ethnic groups. In little more than 100 days, Hutu militia massacred about 800,000 Tutsi men, women and children. The small UN force on the scene was helpless. European nations flew in to remove their own nationals, then flew out. There was a strong consensus in the United States at both the elite and popular levels that the United States should not send in large-scale combat forces to stop the massacres. American officials avoided the word \\"genocide\\" because that would justify military intervention. Clinton later called his inaction his worst mistake.Patrick J. Maney, Bill Clinton: New Gilded Age President (2016) pp 127-33.Holly J. Burkhalter, \\"The question of genocide: The Clinton administration and Rwanda.\\" World Policy Journal 11.4 (1994): 44-54. online The Hutu militia were highly effective in killing Tutsi civilians, but they were ineffective when a large Tutsi armed force based in neighboring Uganda invaded in July and seized full control of the entire nation of Rwanda. By the end of July, 1994, nearly two million Hutus fled the country for safety, flooding into refugee camps in neighboring countries.Power, Samantha. \\"A Problem from Hell\\": America and the Age of Genocide (2002) pp 336-89. As many thousands of refugees died of disease and starvation, Clinton ordered airdrops of food and supplies for the Hutu refugees, including known genocidaires. In July, he sent 200 non-combatant troops to the Rwanda capital of Kigali to manage the airport and distribute relief supplies. These troops were withdrawn by October 1994. Clinton and the United Nations faced criticism for their non- response to the genocide. When Clinton traveled to Africa in 1998, he said that the international community, presumably including the US, must accept responsibility for the failure to respond to the massacres.Speech by President to Survivors Rwanda March 25, 1998 When speaking about the Rwanda Crisis, Clinton called it his worst failure, admitting \\"I blew it.\\" During his African trip, Clinton also referred to the concept of the \\"new generation of African leaders\\".Only realism can help Africa , Magazine for Development and Cooperation [editorial]. D+C 2003:10. =Osama bin Laden attacks in Africa= In August 1998, terrorists bombed the United States embassies in the capitals of two East African countries, Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. About 250 people were killed, including 12 Americans, and more than 5,500 were injured. After intelligence linked the bombings to Osama bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi Arabian living in Afghanistan who was suspected of terrorist activity, Clinton ordered missile attacks on sites in Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for the bombings at the U.S. embassies and to deter future terrorist attacks. The Clinton administration maintained that the sites‚Äîa pharmaceutical factory at Khartoum (the capital of Sudan) and several alleged terrorist camps in Afghanistan‚Äîwere involved in terrorist activities. Europe =The Balkans= Bill Clinton Boulevard in Pristina in 2003 Bosnia Much of Clinton's reluctant focus was the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a nation in southeastern Europe that had declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1992. The Bush administration decided with the Cold War over, Yugoslavia was no longer a high American priority. Trouble there could be left to Europe to handle. But Clinton was outraged by the humanitarian disaster, and decided to play a role.Klaus Larres, \\"'Bloody as Hell' Bush, Clinton and the Abdication of American Leadership in the Former Yugoslavia, 1990-1995.\\" Journal Of European Integration History 10 (2004): 179-202. online pp 179-202. This declaration was the catalyst of a war between Bosnian Serbs, who wanted Bosnia to remain in the Yugoslav federation, and Bosnian Muslims and Croats. The Bosnian Serbs, who were supported by Serbia, were better equipped than the Muslims and the Croats; as a result, they populated and controlled much of the countryside in ways including besieging cities, such as the capital of Sarajevo. This caused widespread suffering. In early 1993 the Clinton administration decided on aggressive action, ignoring both the United Nations and key European allies. The proposed policy was called lift and strike. The plan was to \\"lift\\" the arms embargo the UN had imposed on all sides, which left the Bosnian Muslims unarmed. The US would arm them so they could defend themselves. until they were fully prepared to fight for themselves, the US would hit the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes to keep them back. Christopher traveled to Europe to win support from Britain, France and Germany, but they were all staunchly opposed. By the time Christopher returned to Washington, support for the plan had evaporated, based on memories of Vietnam and fears of being plunged into a chaotic war with no end in sight.Warren Christopher, In the Stream of History (2001) pp 344-47 In 1994, Clinton opposed an effort by the Republicans in Congress to lift the arms embargo, as it were, because American allies were still resistant to that policy.\\"Senate votes to lift arms embargo against Bosnia\\". Google News Clinton continued to pressure western European countries throughout 1994 to take strong measures against the Serbs. But in November, as the Serbs seemed on the verge of defeating the Muslims and Croats in several strongholds, Clinton changed course and called for conciliation with the Serbs. After the 2nd Markale massacre, in which Bosnian Serb forces reportedly shelled a crowded market-place in Sarajevo, NATO, led by the United States launched Operation Deliberate Force with a series of airstrikes against Bosnian Serb targets. In July 1995, as the tide of war was turning against the Bosnian Serbs, local Bosnian forces under the command of General Ratko Mladiƒá forced the surrender of the Bosnian stronghold of Srebrenica, near the eastern border with Serbia. A small UN force was helpless and the defenders surrendered, with the promise that no civilians or soldiers would be harmed if they surrendered. Instead, Mladiƒá's forces massacred over 7000 Bosnians. It was the worst massacre in Europe In 40 years, and galvanized NATO Intervention.David Rhode, A safe area --Srebrenica: Europe's worst massacre since the Second World War (1997). The escalating air campaign, along with a counter-offensive by better-equipped Muslim and Croatian forces, succeeded in pressuring the Bosnian Serbs into participating in negotiations. In November 1995, The U.S. hosted peace talks between the warring parties in Dayton, Ohio Clinton put Richard Holbrooke in charge. The goal of the complex negotiations was an agreement to permanently end the three-way civil war and establish an internationally recognized, unified, democratic, multiethnic Bosnia.Derek Chollet and Samantha Power, eds., The Unquiet American: Richard Holbrooke in the World (2011), pp 197-237.. The parties reached a peace agreement known as the Dayton Agreement, making Bosnia as a single state made up of two separate entities together with a central government. Debate continues into the 21st century on how successful the project was.Marc Weller, and Stefan Wolff. \\"Bosnia and Herzegovina ten years after Dayton: Lessons for internationalized state building.\\" Ethnopolitics 5.1 (2006): 1-13.\\"Hanging together: Though Bosnia‚Äôs demise has long been predicted, it is surviving,\\" The Economist April 27, 2019, pp 45-46, online In 2011, Serbia was forced to turn over Mladiƒá to the United Nations, and in 2017 he was sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted of genocide. Derek Chollet and Samantha Power argue that: :Dayton was a turning point for the Clinton Administration's foreign policy specifically and America's role in the world generally....In less than six months during 1995, the U.S. had taken charge of the Transatlantic Alliance, pushed NATO to use overwhelming military force, risked American prestige on a bold diplomatic gamble, and deployed thousands of American troops to help implement the agreement. That the administration ran such risks successfully gave it confidence going forward. This success also reinforced the logic of the administration's core strategic objective in Europe ‚Äì to help create a continent \\"whole and free\\" by revitalizing and enlarging institutions like NATO. In the wake of Dayton, Clinton seem to be more confident foreign-policy president.Derek Chollet and Samantha Power, eds., The Unquiet American: Richard Holbrooke in the World (2011), p. 208. Enhanced roles of NATO and the United States According to historian David N. Gibbs:Gibbs, David N. Gibbs, (2015) \\"How the Srebrenica Massacre Redefined US Foreign Policy,\\" Class, Race and Corporate Power (2015) 3#2 Article 5. DOI: 10.25148/CRCP.3.2.16092102 online :In bolstering America‚Äôs hegemonic position, the significance of the Srebrenica massacre cannot be overstated: The massacre helped trigger a NATO bombing campaign that is widely credited with ending the Bosnian war, along with the associated atrocities, and this campaign gave NATO a new purpose for the post-Soviet era. Since that time, the Srebrenica precedent has been continuously invoked as a justification for military force. The perceived need to prevent massacres and oppression helped justify later interventions in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, as well as the ongoing fight against ISIS. The recent UN doctrine of Responsibility to Protect, which contains a strongly interventionist tone, was inspired in part by the memory of Srebrenica. Kosovo In the spring of 1998, ethnic tension in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia‚Äìthe state formed from the former Yugoslav republics of Serbia and Montenegro‚Äìheightened when the military forces responded in the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija. More than 90 percent of the residents of Kosovo were Muslim and ethnic Albanians, many of whom wanted independence from the country. Yugoslav forces were mobilized into province to quell Albanian rebels. Through attempting to impose the Rambouillet Agreement, Clinton, who strongly supported the Albanians, threatened the Yugoslav administration with military strikes. On 24 March 1999, NATO, led by the United States, launched the two-month bombardment of Yugoslavia. The strikes were not limited to military installations and NATO targets included civilian targets such as factories, oil refineries, television stations and various infrastructure. The intervention, which devastated Yugoslavia, was not approved by the UN General Assembly or the UN Security Council, and was strongly opposed by both Russia and China.15 years on: Looking back at NATO's 'humanitarian' bombing of Yugoslavia It was the first time in NATO's history that its forces had attacked a sovereign country, and the first time in which air power alone won a battle. In June 1999, NATO and Yugoslav military leaders approved an international peace plan for Kosovo, and attacks were suspended after Yugoslav forces withdrew from Kosovo. =Northern Ireland= Clinton also sought to end the conflict in Northern Ireland by arranging a peace agreement between the nationalist and unionist factions. In 1998 former Senator George Mitchell‚Äîwhom Clinton had appointed to assist in peace talks‚Äîsupported an accord that became known as the Good Friday Agreement. It called for the British Parliament to devolve legislative and executive authority of the province to a new Northern Ireland Assembly, whose Executive would include members of both communities. Years of stalemate have followed the agreement, mainly due to the refusal of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), a nationalist paramilitary group, to decommission its weapons for some years and after that the refusal of the Democratic Unionist Party to push the process forward. Mitchell returned to the region and arranged yet another blueprint for a further peace settlement that resulted in a December 1999 formation of the power-sharing government agreed the previous year, which was to be followed by steps toward the IRA's disarmament. That agreement eventually faltered as well, although Clinton continued peace talks to prevent the peace process from collapsing completely. In 2005 the IRA decommissioned all of its arms and, in 2007, Sinn F√©in expressed a willingness to support the reformed Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). Power was restored to the Assembly in May 2007, marking renewed promise for the fulfillment of the Good Friday Agreement.

Clinton was likewise deeply involved in the Middle East peace process to negotiate peace agreements between Israel and the Palestinians, as well as with the governments of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Secret negotiations mediated by Clinton between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Chairman Yasser Arafat led to a historic declaration of peace in September 1993, called the Oslo Accords. Clinton personally arranged for the peace accord to be signed at the White House on September 13, 1993. The agreement allowed a limited Palestinian self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Following up after Oslo, Secretary of State Christopher encouraged Jordan's King Hussein to make a peace treaty with Israel. Christopher offered Hussein $200 million in military equipment and $700 million in debt forgiveness to sweeten the deal. On October 27, 1994, Rabin and Jordanian Prime Minister Abdelsalam al-Majali signed the Israel‚ÄìJordan peace treaty. It was the second piece treaty for Israel after Egypt. Christopher sought to obtain a Third treaty between Rabin and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, but to no avail.Warren Christopher, Chances of a Lifetime. New York: Scribner Press, 2001. Page 214. The 1993 and 1995 peace agreements between Israel and Palestine, however, did not end the conflict in the Middle East. As the peace process came to a stall, Clinton invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to peace talks on the Wye River in October 1998. The two leaders signed yet another agreement, known as the Wye River Memorandum, which called for Israel to transfer more territory in the West Bank to the Palestinians. In return, the Palestinians agreed to take steps to curb terrorism. They also agreed to a timetable to negotiate a final resolution of the Palestinian fight for an independent state. After an abrupt outbreak of violence sparked by the agreement, however, Netanyahu refused to cede any more West Bank territory and placed new demands upon Palestine. His ceding of territory had shaken his own coalition, though, and together with other factors, this contributed to the downfall of the Netanyahu government in Israel. As a result, in May 1999 Israelis elected Ehud Barak, the leader of a political coalition that favored resuming the peace process, to replace Netanyahu as prime minister. Clinton continued to work passionatelyClinton, Bill. My Life. New York: Knopf Publishing Group, 2004. on negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Throughout his last year in office, Clinton came close to arranging a final peace settlement but failed, according to Clinton, as a result of Arafat's reluctance.President Clinton's Statement on Death of Yasser Arafat Clinton related a phone conversation he had with Arafat three days before he left office. \\"You are a great man,\\" Arafat said. Clinton replied, \\"The hell I am. I'm a colossal failure, and you made me one.\\"\\"The Right Ear\\", in Human Events, July 16, 2001, Vol. 57, Issue 26. =Iraq= Clinton was also confronted with problems in Iraq. In 1991, two years before Clinton became president, the United States under President George H. W. Bush participated in the Persian Gulf War to liberate Kuwait from the Iraqi occupation. In 1991, the warring parties signed a cease-fire agreement and the United Nations Security Council passed United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 requiring Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction and allow inspectors from the United Nations Special Commission (UNS-COM) to monitor the country's adherence to the agreement.Wright, Steven. The United States and Persian Gulf Security: The Foundations of the War on Terror, Ithaca Press, 2007 In addition to UN inspections, to ensure the Iraqi compliance of Resolution 688 which called for Iraq to end its oppression of Iraqi citizens, the no-fly zones over Iraq were established by the U.S. and its allies to protect the Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan and the Shiites in southern Iraq from aerial attacks by the Iraqi government. On June 26, 1993, Clinton ordered a cruise missile attack on the Iraqi Intelligence Service's (IIS) principal command and control complex in Baghdad, publicly announced as retaliation for the assassination attempt by the IIS on former President George H. W. Bush while he was visiting Kuwait in April of that year to commemorate a coalition victory over Iraq in the Gulf War. Fourteen cruise missiles were launched from and nine of them launched from . Sixteen hit the target, while three struck a residential area, killing nine civilians and wounding 12 others. Four missiles were unaccounted for. This strike was in violation of international law, although that point is contentious. In October 1994, Baghdad once again began mobilizing around 64,000 Iraqi troops near the Kuwaiti border because of their expressed frustrations of economic sanctions imposed on Iraq by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).Saddam Hussein & the invasion of KuwaitU.S., Iraq Move More Troops Toward Kuwait : Military: Baghdad mobilizes force of 64,000. Tension up as American ships, planes, 4,000 soldiers converge on Gulf In response, the U.S. begins to deploy troops in the Persian Gulf to deter Iraqi aggression against Kuwait. Code-named Operation Vigilant Warrior, 1st Brigade of the Fort Stewart, Georgia-based 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) deployed and drew pre-positioned equipment in Kuwait. The 23rd Wing's (Flying Tigers) 75th Fighter Squadron (Tigersharks) and its full complement of A-10s initially deployed from Pope AFB, North Carolina to Dhahran Air Base, Saudi Arabia, followed by the first forward deployment to Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base, Kuwait. This allowed better face-to-face coordination with tactical air control parties (TACP) assets further forward deployed at Camp Doha, Kuwait and points north. Iraq would later withdraw troops near the Kuwaiti border in response to a massive U.S. military buildup. This served to increase U.S. and Coalition resolve to contain Iraqi aggression against their neighbors in the Middle East. In September 1996, Clinton ordered Operation Desert Strike, and ships from the Battle Group, including , and , in conjunction with B-52 bombers escorted by F-14D Tomcats from USS Carl Vinson, launched 27 cruise missiles against Iraqi air defense targets in southern Iraq.Operation Desert Strike at globalsecurity.org A second wave of 17 was launched later that day. The missiles hit targets in and around Kut, Iskandariyah, Nasiriyah, and Tallil.U.S. launches missile strikes against Iraq ‚Äì CNN.com This was done in response to Saddam Hussein, an Iraqi dictator, attempting to launch an Iraqi military offensive campaign in the Kurdish town of Arbil in Iraqi Kurdistan. In his 1998 State of the Union Address, Clinton warned the U.S. Congress of Hussein's possible pursuit of nuclear weapons, saying: The UNS-COM team faced resistance from Iraq, which blocked inspections and hid deadly germ agents and warheads.Chronology of Iraq ‚Äì Royal United Services Institute Clinton then threatened military action several times when Hussein, who turned out to be Iraq's President, tried stalling the UNS-COM inspections.Remarks by President on UN Security Council Resolution on Iraq ‚Äì 1997-11-12 To weaken Hussein's grip of power, Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act into law on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of \\"regime change\\" against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not speak to the use of American military forces. Between December 16 and 19, 1998, Clinton ordered four-day period of concentrated air attacks against military installations in Iraq. This was in response to Saddam's refusal to cooperate with UN inspectors. After the bombing, Hussein blocked any further UN inspections and announced its attempt to shoot down Coalition aircraft in the no-fly zones over Iraq. For several years afterward, U.S. and Coalition aircraft routinely attacked hostile Iraqi defense installations in Iraq, in response to what the Clinton administration claimed were \\"provocations\\" by the Iraqi military, including antiaircraft fire and radar locks on U.S. and Coalition aircraft. The UN sanctions against Iraq that the United Nations Security Council imposed after the Gulf War remained in place during the Clinton administration. These sanctions were alleged to have contributed to increased child mortality there, although this was disputed. Albright later wrote \\"Saddam Hussein could have prevented any child from suffering simply by meeting his obligations. Recent research has shown that commonly cited data were fabricated by the Iraqi government and that \\"there was no major rise in child mortality in Iraq after 1990 and during the period of the sanctions.\\" =Iran= President Clinton's foreign policy team initially viewed Iran with suspicion and sought to contain Iranian ambitions as part of the dual containment strategy.Bruce O. Riedel, \\"The Clinton Administration.\\" The Iran Primer (2010): 139-141. Online On May 6, 1995, Clinton signed Executive Order 12957, which implemented tight oil and trade sanctions on Iran and made it illegal for American corporations or their foreign subsidiaries to participate in any contract \\"for the financing of the development of petroleum resources located in Iran.\\" On May 6, 1995, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12959, which banned almost all trade between U.S. businesses and the Iranian government with the exception of informational materials. A year before, the President declared that Iran was a \\"state sponsor of terrorism\\" and a \\"rogue state,\\" marking the first time that an American President used that term.The German Law Journal In 1996, Clinton signed the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act, that imposed economic sanctions on firms doing business with Iran and Libya. In 1996, the Clinton administration agreed to compensate the Iranian government for the deaths of 254 Iranians in a 1988 incident in which an Iranian commercial passenger plane was shot down by mistake by an American warship the USS Vincennes. In Clinton's second term as President, beginning in 1997, the administration began to take a softer approach towards Iran, particularly after the election of reformist Mohammad Khatami as President of Iran. In 1995 Albright and Clinton mandated what could be considered an apology to the Iranian people for the 1953 CIA-assisted coup that overthrew the Prime Minister, Mohammed Mossadegh, and replaced him with the Shah. Albright and Clinton also acknowledged that the U.S.-backed government of the Shah \\"oppressed political opponents.\\" In the months that followed, an Iranian professional wrestling team was allowed entry into the U.S. to face American teams, and a significant increase in cultural and academic overtures were made between the two countries. In 1998, Iran and the United States faced each other in a game at the FIFA World Cup that year (Iran beat the US by 2‚Äì1). Khatami also encouraged Americans to travel to Iran for vacational purposes, citing the city of Esfahan, a popular location for tourists where, according to CNN, several \\"well-preserved\\" sites often \\"surprise\\" tourists. In a well-publicized 1997 interview, Khatami refused to fully apologize for the '79 hostage crisis in which 52 American diplomats were held hostage for 444 days yet did offer to open up a dialogue with the American people. Clinton at one point offered to open up an official dialogue with the Iranian government and renew diplomatic relations with the country after 20 years of no such relations. However, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei refused to accept the offer for dialogue unless the U.S. formally withdrew its support for Israel, lifted the '95 sanctions imposed on the country, stopped accusing Tehran of attempting to develop nuclear weaponry, and officially ended its policy of considering Iran a \\"rogue state that sponsors terrorism.\\" Although Clinton did privately weigh the idea of revoking the executive orders he signed in the spring of 1995, the administration refused to comply with Iran's other demands. Eventually, President Clinton did ease restrictions on export of food and medical equipment to Iran. Albright announced in 2000 that the U.S. would begin to \\"enable Americans to purchase and import carpets and food products such as dried fruits, nuts, and caviar from Iran\\" and also was confident that Iran would provide cooperation with the United States in the battle against narcotics and international drug abuse. In 1995, the State Department warned U.S. citizens against traveling in Iran due to that government's rampant anti-Americanism yet five years later Albright decided to repeal this warning. By the time Clinton left office in January 2001, it was clear that relations between Iran and the United States had significantly cooled despite the fact that President Khatami and President Clinton failed to initiate an official diplomatic dialogue between the nations, something which has not existed since the 1979 hostage crisis. East Asia and South Asia =Vietnam= In 1994, the Clinton administration announced that it was lifting the trade embargo on Vietnam, citing progress on the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue regarding the search for American soldiers listed as missing in action and the remains of those killed in action, as well as the market reforms that Vietnam implemented from 1986. On July 10, 1995, Clinton announced that his administration was restoring full diplomatic relations with Vietnam, citing the continued progress in determining the whereabouts of MIA's and locating the remains of soldiers killed in the Vietnam War. Clinton nonetheless stressed that the search for Americans would continue, especially for the soldiers listed as \\"discrepancies;\\" namely 55 American soldiers believed to still be alive when they went missing. On November 16, 2000, Clinton arrived in Hanoi with his wife, Senator-elect Hillary Clinton and daughter Chelsea shortly before his second term in office ended. The next day Clinton spoke to the Vietnamese people publicly about both the conflict as well as the promise renewed relations meant. =China and Taiwan= Jiang Zemin and Bill Clinton In 1995, tense relations with China and the imprisonment of an innocent American in the Communist nation, led to pressure for the U.S. to boycott the 1995 United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing. The U.S. delegation, chaired by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Madeleine Albright, then the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, was assigned with the task of confronting China about its human rights abuses, but not so strongly as to damage sensitive relations. Hillary Rodham Clinton gave a successful speech before the entire Chinese leadership and the Conference where she, without bringing up China or any particular nation, attacked human rights abuses against humanity in general, and women and girls in particular. In 1995-96 the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis happened between Taiwan and China. Chinese concerns about the upcoming Taiwanese presidential election as well as the possibility of the declaration of Taiwanese independence led to a series of missile tests right off the coast of Taiwan that could have escalated out of control. The Clinton administration responded in March 1996 by staging the biggest display of American military might in Asia since the Vietnam War. Numerous aircraft carrier groups were stationed near Taiwan. and her group as well as sailed through the Taiwan Strait in a demonstration of support for Taiwan. Eventually a ceasefire was declared and China declared the 'missile tests' to be completed. =North Korea= Vice Marshal Jo Myong-rok meets Bill Clinton at the White House, October 2000. North Korea's feared aim to create nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles was a serious problem for the Clinton Administration. In 1994, North Korea, a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, refused to allow international inspectors to review two nuclear waste sites. The inspectors wanted to see if North Korea was in violation of the treaty since they were suspected of reprocessing spent fuel into plutonium, which could be used to manufacture nuclear weapons. Despite diplomatic pressure and repeated warnings by Clinton,Remarks by President on CNN Telecast of a Global Forum with Clinton, 1994-05-03 North Korea refused to allow the inspections and even raised the prospect of war with South Korea, an ally of the United States. In 1994, Clinton also considered a US military strike on bombing the Yongbyon nuclear reactor. He was advised that if war broke out, it could cost 52,000 US and 490,000 South Korean military casualties in the first three months, as well as a large number of civilian casualties. With private diplomacy by former president Jimmy Carter, the Clinton administration reached a breakthrough with North Korea in October 1994 when North Korea agreed to shut down the nuclear plants that could produce materials for weapons if the United States would help North Korea build plants that generated electricity with light-water nuclear reactors. These reactors would be more efficient and their waste could not easily be used for nuclear weaponry.Press Briefing by Ambassador Gallucci on Korea The United States also agreed to supply fuel oil for electricity until the new plants were built, and North Korea agreed to allow inspection of the old waste sites when construction began on the new plants. KEDO was established based on this agreement in 1995.kEDO. About Us: Our History. The Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization. This 1994 Agreed Framework, as it was known, kept the Yongbyon plutonium enrichment plant closed and under international inspection until 2002. However, economic supports by the agreement and KEDO gave an advantage to North Korea, and North Korea broke off from the treaty and restarted plutonium production. In October 2006, North Korea tested its first nuclear weapon. President Bush warned that he was not pleased by such actions as it is he invited the international community to take a stand. As a result, North Korea, the United States, Russia, China were involved in negotiations and North Korea agreed to close down their nuclear station temporarily. Latin America =Haiti= The 1991 Haitian coup d'√©tat, led by Lieutenant General Raoul C√©dras, had ousted the country's elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who barely escaped to the United States. Shortly thereafter tens of thousands of Haitians also tried to flee to the United States in leaky boats; in 1993 increased opposition to Aristide supporters would increase these numbers. Relatively few refugees would be allowed legal entry, with most being sent back to Haiti or Guantanamo by the United States Coast Guard. Clinton had previously criticized former President George H. W. Bush for doing much the same. American opinion generally favored Aristide but opposed military intervention., in Daniel Drezner, Ed. Locating the Proper Authorities: The Interaction of Domestic and International Institutions Clinton was highly sensitive to his black constituency, and the black leadership in Congress pushed for action. Vice President Gore and advisor Anthony Lake strongly agreed, while Sandy Berger, Strobe Talbott, Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary William Perry went along. Clinton agreed, but worried about going against the democratic will in his own country to enforce democracy in some other country. On September 15, 1994, Clinton tried to rally American public opinion with a forceful televised address from the Oval Office. He denounced the military junta as armed thugs engaged in \\"a reign of terror, executing children, raping women, killing priests.\\" Clinton demanded it leave immediately. As American warplanes were being readied for an invasion, suddenly former President Jimmy Carter proposed to negotiate a settlement. Clinton agreed that Carter, Colin Powell, and Senator Sam Nunn would fly to Haiti to convince the junta to leave. In a matter of 48 hours, Carter's group achieved the desired transfer of power without any violence. In Operation Uphold Democracy American forces landed after the departure of the junta. Anthony Lake attributed the success to a combination of power and diplomacy. Without Clinton's threat of force, the junta would never have left. Without Carter, there would have been fighting. Aristide returned to power, and Clinton's prestige was enhanced. Nevertheless, six years later conditions were still terrible in Haiti. Maney, Bill Clinton pp 131‚Äì34.

The Mexican peso began to fall sharply and threatened the collapse of the Mexican economy. Clinton feared that a collapse would have a negative impact on the United States because of their close economic ties. He proposed a plan to address the financial crisis in Mexico, but many in Congress, fearing that constituents would not favor aid money to Mexico, rejected the plan. In response, Clinton used executive authority to create a $20 billion loan package for Mexico to restore international confidence in the Mexican economy. The loan Went through and Mexico completed its loan payments to the United States in January 1997, three years ahead of schedule. However, issues such as drug smuggling and immigration continued to strain relations.Russell Dean Covey, \\"Adventures in the Zone of Twilight: Separation of Powers and National Economic Security in the Mexican Bailout.\\" Yale Law Journal 105 (1995): 1311-1345.

Clinton basically continue the policy especially regarding trade embargoes, but he faced a difficult problem on what to do with Cuban refugees trying to reach asylum in the United States.Walt Vanderbush and Patrick J. Haney. \\"Policy toward Cuba in the Clinton administration.\\" Political Science Quarterly 114.3 (1999): 387-408. Online After negotiations with representatives of the Cuban government, Clinton revealed in May 1995 a controversial policy reversing the decades-old policy of automatically granting asylum to Cuban refugees. Approximately 20,000 Cuban refugees detained at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba were to be admitted to the United States over a period of three months. In order to prevent a mass exodus of refugees to the United States, all future refugees would be returned to Cuba. The influx of refugees into Guantanamo Bay overwhelmed the facilities, necessitating Operations Safe Haven and Safe Passage involving Panama. Clinton also implemented the wet foot/dry foot policy for Cuban refugees. This policy meant that Cuban refugees caught at sea were returned to Cuba (wet foot), while Cuban refugees that made it to dry land (dry foot) were allowed to stay in the U.S. This changed the refugees' tactics from slow rafts to speed boats. Relations between the United States and Cuba deteriorated in February 1996 when Cuba shot down two American civilian planes. Cuba accused the planes of violating Cuban airspace. Clinton tightened sanctions against Cuba and suspended charter flights from the United States to Cuba, hoping this would cripple Cuba's tourism industry. In their response to the incident, the U.S. Congress passed the Helms‚ÄìBurton Act in March 1996. The bill strengthened an embargo against imports of Cuban products. Title III, however, made the bill controversial because it allowed American citizens whose property was seized during and after the 1959 Cuban Revolution to sue in American courts foreign companies that later invested in those properties. Title III sparked an immediate uproar from countries such as Mexico, Canada, and members of the European Union because they believed that they would be penalized for doing business with Cuba. In response, Clinton repeatedly suspended Title III of the legislation (the act gave the president the right to exercise this option every six months).William M. LeoGrande, \\"Enemies evermore: US policy towards Cuba after Helms-Burton.\\" Journal of Latin American Studies 29.1 (1997): 211-221. Online Clinton softened his Cuban policy in 1998 and 1999. In March 1998, at the urging of Pope John Paul II, Clinton lifted restrictions and allowed humanitarian charter flights to resume. He also took steps to increase educational, religious, and humanitarian contacts in Cuba. The U.S. government decided to allow Cuban citizens to receive more money from American friends and family members and to buy more American food and medicine. Counterterrorism and Osama bin Laden On February 26, 1993, thirty-six days after Clinton took office, terrorists who the CIA would later reveal were working under the direction of Osama bin Laden detonated a timed car bomb in the parking garage below Tower One of the World Trade Center in New York City (see the World Trade Center bombing). Clinton responded by ordering his National Security Council, under the direction of Anthony Lake, and the FBI to find and punish those responsible. The FBI was able to quickly identify the vehicle used in the bomb from a remnant found in the rubble: a Ryder rental van, which had been reported stolen in Jersey City, New Jersey the day before. The truck was rented by Mohammed Salameh, whom the FBI immediately detained. Similar evidence led to the arrests of other plotters behind the attack, including Nidal Ayyad, Mahmoud Abouhalima, Ahmad Ajaj, and Ramzi Yousef‚Äîwho was identified as the key player in the bombing. All men were tried and convicted for the bombing and other terrorists activities.National Commission on Terrorist Attacks. The 9/11 Commission Report. Washington: July 2004. In his 1995 State of the Union address, Clinton proposed \\"comprehensive legislation to strengthen our hand in combating terrorists, whether they strike at home or abroad.\\"President Clinton, \\"Address Before a Joint Session of Congress on the State of the Union,\\" January 24, 1995 He sent legislation to Congress to extend federal criminal jurisdiction, make it easier to deport terrorists, and act against terrorist fund-raising.President Clinton, \\"Message to Congress Transmitting Proposed Legislation to Combat Terrorism,\\" February 9, 1995 Following the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Clinton amended that legislation to increase wiretap and electronic surveillance authority for the FBI, require explosives to be equipped with traceable taggants, and appropriate more funds to the FBI, CIA, and local police.President Clinton, \\"Message to Congress Transmitting Proposed Legislation to Combat Terrorism,\\" May 3, 1995 In June 1995, Clinton issued Presidential Decision Directive 39, which stated that the United States \\"should deter, defeat and respond vigorously to all terrorist attacks on our territory and against our citizens.\\" Furthermore, it called terrorism both a \\"matter of national security\\" and a crime.Presidential Decision Directive/NSC-39, \\"US Policy on Counter-terrorism,\\" June 21, 1995. The implementation of his proposals led to a substantial increase in counter- terrorism funds for the FBI and CIA. In 1996, the CIA established a special unit of officers to analyze intelligence received about bin Laden and plan operations against him, coined the \\"Bin Laden Issue Station\\". It was this unit that first realized bin Laden was more than just a terrorist financier, but a leader of a global network with operations based in Afghanistan. Given these findings, the NSC encouraged the Department of State to \\"pay more attention\\" to Afghanistan and its governing unit, the Taliban, which had received funding from bin Laden. The State Department requested the Taliban to expel bin Laden from the country, noting that he was a sponsor of terrorism and publicly urged Muslims to kill Americans. The Taliban responded that they did not know his whereabouts and, even if they did, he was \\"not a threat to the United States.\\" The CIA's counter-terrorism division quickly began drafting plans to capture and remove bin Laden from the country. However, Marine General Anthony Zinni and some in the State Department protested the move, saying that the United States should focus instead on ending the Afghan civil war and the Taliban's human rights abuses.Clarke, Richard. Against All Enemies. September 2004. New York: The Free Press. In 1998, Clinton appointed Richard Clarke‚Äîwho until then served in a drugs and counter-terrorism division of the CIA‚Äîto lead an interagency comprehensive counter-terrorism operation, the Counter-terrorism Security Group (CSG). The goal of the CSG was to \\"detect, deter, and defend against\\" terrorist attacks. Additionally, Clinton appointed Clarke to sit on the cabinet-level Principals Committee when it met on terrorism issues. Clinton's Counter-terrorism Center began drafting a plan to ambush bin Laden's compound in Kandahar. The CIA mapped the compound and identified the houses of bin Laden's wives and the location where he most likely slept. The plan was relatively simple, at least on paper. Tribals would \\"subdue\\" the guards, enter the compound, take bin Laden to a desert outside Kandahar, and hand him over to another group of tribals. This second group would carry him to a desert landing strip‚Äîwhich had already been tested‚Äîwhere a CIA plane would take him to New York for arraignment. When they completed a draft plan, they ran through two rehearsals in the United States.Coll, Steve. Ghost Wars. January 2005. New York: Penguin Group. Confident that the plan would work, the Counter-terrorism Center of the CIA sought the approval of the White House. While they acknowledged that the plan was risky, they stated that there was \\"a risk in not acting\\" because \\"sooner or later, bin Laden will attack U.S. interests, perhaps using WMD.\\"CIA Memo, to Tenet, \\"Information Paper on Usama bin Ladin,\\" February 12, 1998. Clarke reviewed the plans for Sandy Berger, the National Security Director, and told him that it was in the \\"very early stages of development\\" and stressed the importance of only targeting bin Laden, not the entire compound. The NSC told the CIA to begin preparing the necessary legal documents to execute the raid.National Security Council note, Simon to Berger. February 27, 1998. Declassified by 9/11 Commission. The senior management of the CIA was skeptical of the plan, and despite objections, canceled the operation, fearing that the risk to their operatives and financial costs were too high. It is unclear whether or not Clinton was aware of the plan. As the Counter-terrorism Center continued to track bin Laden, they learned in 1998 that the Saudi government had bin Laden cells within the country that were planning attacks on U.S. forces. CIA Director George Tenet, encouraged by the Saudi's show of force against bin Laden, asked them to assist in the fight against bin Laden. Clinton named Tenet as his informal \\"personal representative\\" to work with Saudi Arabia on terrorism. The Saudis promised Tenet that they would do everything they could to convince the Taliban to release bin Laden for trial in America or elsewhere. The Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Turki bin Faisal, held various meetings with Taliban chief Mullah Omar and other leaders and received assurance that bin Laden would be removed. Omar, however, reneged on that promise. On August 7, 1998, Bin Laden struck again, this time with simultaneous bombings on the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. (see above) The CIA, having confirmed bin Laden was behind the attack, informed Clinton that terrorist leaders were planning to meet at a camp near Khowst, to plan future attacks. According to Tenet, \\"several hundred,\\" including bin Laden, would attend. On August 20, Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on Al-Qaeda terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum, Sudan, where bin Laden was suspected of manufacturing biological weapons. While the military hit their targets, bin Laden was not killed. The CIA estimated that they had missed bin Laden by \\"a few hours.\\" At the time of the attacks, Clinton was embroiled in the Lewinsky scandal (see below). This led many Republicans in Congress to accuse the president of \\"wagging the dog\\"‚Äîlaunching a military attack simply to distract the public from his personal problems. Clinton and his principals, however, insist that the decision was made solely on the basis of national security. After the attacks failed, Clinton moved his focus to diplomatic pressure. On the advice of the State Department, Clinton encouraged Pakistan, whose military intelligence agency was a patron of the Taliban, to pressure the Taliban to remove bin Laden. After numerous meetings with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani's would still not cooperate. Sharif eventually agreed to allow the United States to train Pakistani special forces to find bin Laden. When Sharif was ousted by Pervez Musharraf, the plan was abandoned.Department of State memo, Sheehan to Albright, \\"S/CT Update on Critical Issues.\\" July 9, 1999. After encouragement by Richard Clarke, Clinton issued an executive order in July 1999 declaring the Taliban regime as a state sponsor of terrorism.Executive Order 13129 on Transactions with the Taliban, July 6, 1999. This was followed in October 1999 by Resolution 1267 sponsored by the United States placing economic and travel sanctions on the Taliban.UN Security Council Resolution 1267, October 15, 1999. The Taliban, however, stood by bin Laden, and the United States, along with Russia, proposed yet another UN resolution (Resolution 1333), this time imposing an embargo an arms shipments to the Taliban.UN Security Council Resolution 1333, December 19, 2000. The move was meant to weaken the Taliban in their fight against the Northern Alliance in their civil strife. However, the resolution did little to limit the illegal flow of arms from Pakistan. In August 1999, Clinton signed a Memorandum of Notification ordering the CIA to develop another plan to capture bin Laden, and giving the CIA the authority to order bin Laden be killed. Near the end of 1999, the Clinton administration, working with the government of Jordan, detected and thwarted a planned terrorist attack to detonate bombs at various New Year millennium celebrations around the world. The CIA confirmed that bin Laden was behind the plot, which was disrupted just days before the New Year. While many credited Clinton's new CSG for playing a role in the foiling of these plots, critics claim it was \\"mostly luck.\\" The CIA informed Clinton that they feared the thwarted attacks were just part of a larger series of attacks planned for the new year. Clinton asked Clarke and the CSG to draft plans to \\"deter and disrupt\\" al Qaeda attacks. On October 12, 2000, terrorists bombed USS Cole in the harbor of the Yemeni port of Aden. The attack on , a U.S. Navy destroyer, killed 17 Navy sailors, and there was no clear indication during the last months of Clinton's term of who was responsible. The CIA reported that they had \\"no definitive answer on [the] crucial question of outside direction of the attack‚Äîhow and by whom. Clinton did not think it would be wise to launch an attack based on a \\"preliminary judgment,\\" stating that he would have taken further action had he received definitive intelligence. The CIA was eventually able to confirm bin Laden's involvement with certainty a week after the Bush administration took office. As Clinton's second term drew to a close, the CSG drafted a comprehensive policy paper entitled \\"Strategy for Eliminating the Threat from the Jihadist Networks of al Qida: Status and Prospects.\\"http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB147/clarke%20attachment.pdf The paper outlined a method to \\"roll back\\" al Qaeda over \\"a period of three to five years.\\" Clarke stated that while \\"continued anti-al Qida operations at the current level will prevent some attacks, [it] will not seriously attrit their ability to plan and conduct attacks.\\" This policy paper was forwarded to the incoming Bush administration. =Criticism of Bill Clinton's inaction towards Bin Laden= In the years since September 11, 2001, Clinton has been subject to criticism that he failed to capture Osama bin Laden as President. In a September 24, 2006, interview with Fox News' Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday, Clinton challenged his critics. According to Clinton, he faced criticism from various conservatives during his administration for being too obsessed with Bin Laden. Clinton also noted that his administration created the first comprehensive anti-terrorist operation, led by Richard Clarke‚Äîwhom Clinton accuses the Bush Administration of demoting. Clinton also said he worked hard to try to kill Bin Laden. Former international negotiator and current businessman, financier and media commentator Mansoor Ijaz claimed that from 1996‚Äì1998, he had opened up unofficial negotiations with Sudan to lift terrorism sanctions from that country in exchange for intelligence information about the terrorist groups Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah and Hamas. He claimed that Sudan was also prepared to offer custody of terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden, who had been living in the country and launching operations. According to Ijaz, neither Clinton nor National Security Advisor Sandy Berger responded to the situation.Manssor, Ijaz, \\"Clinton let Bin Laden Slip Away and Metastasize\\", Los Angeles Times, December 5, 2001 Bin Laden later left Sudan and established his operations in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban and, with his network, planned out terrorist attacks against American interests worldwide, including attacks on American embassies in Tunisia and Sudan as well as the bombing of USS Cole. The most infamous were the attacks of September 11, 2001 that occurred under Clinton's successor, George W. Bush nine months after Clinton left office. However, the 9/11 Commission Report later found no credible evidence to support the Sudan custody offer as the American Ambassador to the Sudan had no legal basis to ask for custody due to no indictment against Bin Laden: > Sudan's minister of defense, Fatih Erwa, has claimed that Sudan offered to > hand Bin Ladin over to the United States. The Commission has found no > credible evidence that this was so. Ambassador Carney had instructions only > to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Ladin. Ambassador Carney had no legal > basis to ask for more from the Sudanese since, at the time, there was no > indictment outstanding. Clinton acknowledged that, following the bombing on USS Cole, his administration prepared battle plans to execute a military operation in Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban and search for bin Laden. The plans were never implemented because, according to Clinton, the CIA and FBI refused to certify that bin Laden was responsible for the bombing until after he left office and the military was unable to receive basing rights in Uzbekistan. In relation to Afghanistan, Clinton criticized the Bush Administration when he said \\"We do have a government that thinks Afghanistan is one-seventh as important as Iraq\\". Clinton also said that his administration left the plans and a comprehensive anti-terror strategy with the new Bush Administration in January 2001. In 2014, a September 10, 2001, audio containing Clinton's conversation at a business center at Melbourne, Australia, 10 hours before the 9/11 attacks regarding the topic of terrorism was revealed. In this audio, Clinton stated that according to intelligence agencies, Bin Laden was located in Kandahar, Afghanistan, in December 1998, and thus, a missile strike was proposed. However, he decided not to kill Bin Laden because of conflicting reports of intelligence information to his true whereabouts as well as the potential risk for civilian casualties. He stated that, \\"I'm just saying, you know, if I were Osama bin Laden‚Äîhe's a very smart guy, I've spent a lot of time thinking about him‚Äîand I nearly got him once.\\" And then he said that, \\"I nearly got him. And I could have killed him, but I would have to destroy a little town called Kandahar in Afghanistan and kill 300 innocent women and children, and then I would have been no better than him. And so I didn't do it.\\"Bill Clinton: \\"I could have killed\\" Osama bin Laden Nuclear issues and nonproliferation In 1996 Clinton signed the United States onto the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), a landmark international agreement that prohibited all signatory nations from testing nuclear weapons. The following year, he sent the treaty to the Senate for ratification. Conservative Republicans took the lead in defeating the treaty in October 1999 by vote of 48 in favor and 51 against, far short of the two thirds it needed to pass. International reaction to the Senate's action was uniformly negative, and the rejection was a political setback for Clinton, who had lobbied actively for its approval. One scholar blames the failure on: :an accident of politics, an executive- legislative stalemate that resulted from clashing institutional interests, partisan struggle, intraparty factionalism, and personal vindictiveness. Certainly it was a story of zealotry, conspiracy and incompetence in which all the key players share responsibility for an outcome that only a minority really desired.Terry L. Deibel, \\"The Death of a Treaty.\\" Foreign Affairs 81 (2002): 142-61, quoting p. 143. Online Despite the rejection of the treaty, Clinton promised that the United States would continue to maintain a policy of not testing nuclear weapons, which had been in place since 1992.Joseph M. Siracusa and Aiden Warren. \\"The Nuclear Non- Proliferation Regime: An Historical Perspective.\\" Diplomacy & Statecraft 29.1 (2018): 3-28. Throughout the 1990s, the Congress refused to appropriate funds for the United States to pay its dues to the United Nations. By 1999 the United States owed the UN at least $1 billion in back dues. That same year Clinton reached a compromise with Republicans in Congress to submit more than $800 million in back dues. Republicans in the House of Representatives had insisted that UN debt repayments be accompanied by restrictions on U.S. funding for international groups that lobbied for abortion rights in foreign countries. Clinton had vetoed similar measures in the past, but he agreed to the restrictions when faced with the prospect that the United States would lose its vote in the UN General Assembly for nonpayment of dues.  Public response to the Clinton administration's foreign policy  During his first term, argues two political scientists: :He earned the nickname \\"William the Waffler\\" for his administration's supposed inconsistency in linking rhetoric with policy on human rights violations in China, refugee problems in Cuba and Haiti, and in haphazardly getting the United States involved in the long- running tragic conflict in Bosnia.Aubrey W. Jewett and Marc D. Turetzky, \\"Stability and Change in President Clinton's Foreign Policy Beliefs, 1993-96.\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly 28.3 (1998): 638-665, quoting p. 638. Public opinion in the United States about the role the country should have in the Bosnian genocide was negative. A series of Gallup polls through 1995-1997 showed that public disapproval of military intervention in Bosnia hovered around 52%, with the only outlier occurring in January 1997, where 58% of the population disapproved. The polls also found that public opposition was bipartisan, with 49% of Republicans and around 40% of Democrats and Independents disapproving. Americans were even less supportive of involvement in Kosovo. A Gallup poll in March 1999 showed that about half of the American public supported NATO air strikes in Yugoslavia. That was the weakest support for any American combat mission in the past decade. Fewer people were following the news about US involvement in Kosovo, falling from 43% to 32% in two months. The public and the media paid little attention to the Rwanda genocide. One reason why the United States did not enter Rwanda is because of the public reluctance to enter combat after the Vietnam War.

ART is also prescribed to lessen the effects or delay the onset of normal male aging. However, this is controversial and is the subject of ongoing clinical trials. As men enter middle age they may notice changes caused by a relative decline in testosterone: fewer erections, fatigue, thinning skin, declining muscle mass and strength, and/or more body fat. Dissatisfaction with these changes causes some middle age men to seek ART. Androgen deficiencies in women have also, as of 2001, been recognized as a medical disorder that can be treated with ART. As with men, symptoms associated with androgen deficiency are most prevalent with age, and androgen replacement therapy has been shown to help with symptoms of menopause. Medical uses =Men= Androgen replacement is the classic treatment of hypogonadism., It is also used in men who have lost the ability to produce androgens due to disease or its treatment. , Diabetes The risks of diabetes and of testosterone deficiency in men over 45 (i.e., hypogonadism, specifically hypoandrogenism) are strongly correlated. Testosterone replacement therapies have been shown to improve blood glucose management. Still, \\"it is prudent not to start testosterone therapy in men with diabetes solely for the purpose of improving metabolic control if they show no signs and symptoms of hypogonadism.\\" =Women= Androgen replacement is used in postmenopausal women: the indications are to increase sexual desire; and to prevent or treat osteoporosis. Other symptoms of androgen deficiency are similar in both sexes, such as muscle loss and physical fatigue. The androgens used for androgen replacement in women include testosterone (and esters), prasterone (dehydroepiandrosterone; DHEA) (and the ester prasterone enanthate), methyltestosterone, nandrolone decanoate, and tibolone, among others. Adverse effects The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stated in 2015 that neither the benefits nor the safety of testosterone have been established for low testosterone levels due to aging. The FDA has required that testosterone labels include warning information about the possibility of an increased risk of heart attacks and stroke. =Heart disease= On January 31, 2014, reports of strokes, heart attacks, and deaths in men taking testosterone-replacement led the FDA to announce that it would be investigating this issue. The FDA's action followed three peer-reviewed studies of increased cardiovascular events and deaths. Due to an increased rate of adverse cardiovascular events compared to a placebo group, a randomized trial stopped early. Also, in November 2013, a study reported an increase in deaths and heart attacks in older men. Even after a correction was published, the \\"Androgen Study Group\\", a group with many members who have relationships with drug companies in the testosterone market, requested JAMA to retract the article as misleading due to substantial residual errors. Concerns have been raised that testosterone was being widely marketed without the benefit of data on efficacy and safety from large randomized controlled trials. As a result of the \\"potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes\\", the FDA announced, in September 2014, a review of the appropriateness and safety of testosterone replacement therapy. Methods of administration There are several artificial androgens, many of which are manipulations of the testosterone molecule referred to as anabolic-androgenic steroids. Androgen replacement is administered by patch, tablet, capsule, cream or gel; or depot injections given into fat or muscle. =Other= Other significant adverse effects of testosterone supplementation include acceleration of pre-existing prostate cancer growth in individuals who have undergone androgen deprivation; increased hematocrit, which can require venipuncture in order to treat; and, exacerbation of sleep apnea. Adverse effects may also include minor side- effects such as acne and oily skin, as well as, significant hair loss and/or thinning of the hair, which may be prevented with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors ordinarily used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, such as finasteride. Exogenous testosterone may also cause suppression of spermatogenesis, leading to, in some cases, infertility. It is recommended that physicians screen for prostate cancer with a digital rectal exam and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level before starting therapy, and monitor PSA and hematocrit levels closely during therapy. Some studies argue that ART increases the risk of prostate cancer, although the results are not conclusive. Society and culture =Regulation= As of September 2014, testosterone replacement therapy has been under review for appropriateness and safety by the Food and Drug Administration due to the \\"potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes\\". =Frequency of use= In the United States usage increased from 0.5% in 2002 to 3.2% in 2013 and have since decreased to 1.7% in 2016. A UK study in 2013 showed that prescriptions for testosterone replacement, particularly transdermal products, almost doubled between 2000 and 2010.

The regatta is much longer than most head races, but shorter than the Boston Rowing Marathon. Normally, the races with the longest distance that competitive crews enter are called head races (for example the Head of the Charles) and are usually around long. The majority of crews do not even practice on bodies of water that allow them to row without stopping and turning around (usually due to lake size or the presence of a river dam or lock). The Marathon Rowing Championship did not take place in 2010 or 2011 due to low water during an extreme regional drought. The record time for this event is 2 hours, 31 minutes, 20 seconds set in 2008.

They appeared during the middle Jurassic Period, and differ from the basal (though paraphyletic) rhamphorhynchoids by their short tails and long wing metacarpals (hand bones). The most advanced forms also lack teeth, and by the late Cretaceous, all known pterodactyloids were toothless.Review of taxonomy, geographic distribution, and paleoenvironments of Azhdarchidae (Pterosauria) - ZooKeys Many species had well-developed crests on the skull, a form of display taken to extremes in giant-crested forms like Nyctosaurus and Tupandactylus. Pterodactyloids were the last surviving pterosaurs when the order became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous Period, together with the non-avian dinosaurs and most marine reptiles. \\"Pterodactyl\\" is also a common term for pterodactyloid pterosaurs, though it can also be used to refer to Pterodactylus specifically or (incorrectly) to pterosaurs in general. Well-known examples of pterodactyloids include Pterodactylus, Pteranodon, and Quetzalcoatlus. In 2014, fossils from the Shishugou Formation of China were classified as the most basal pterodactyloid yet found, Kryptodrakon. At a minimum age of about 161 my, it is about 5 million years older than the oldest previously known confirmed specimens. Previously, a fossil jaw recovered from the Middle Jurassic Stonesfield Slate formation in the United Kingdom, was considered the oldest known. This specimen supposedly represented a member of the family Ctenochasmatidae,Buffetaut, E. and Jeffrey, P. (2012). \\"A ctenochasmatid pterosaur from the Stonesfield Slate (Bathonian, Middle Jurassic) of Oxfordshire, England.\\" Geological Magazine, (advance online publication) though further examination suggested it belonged to a teleosaurid stem-crocodilian instead of a pterosaur. O'Sullivan and Martill (2018) described a partial synsacrum from the Stonesfield Slate identified as possibly pterodactyloid based on the number of incorporated sacrals although they commented that the morphology was perhaps closer to that of wukongopterids. If correctly identified, it would be the oldest pterodactyloid fossil known.Michael O‚ÄôSullivan; David M. Martill (2018). \\"Pterosauria of the Great Oolite Group (Bathonian, Middle Jurassic) of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire, England\\". Acta Palaeontologica Polonica. Online edition. doi:10.4202/app.00490.2018. Classification Pterodactyloidea is traditionally considered to be the group of short-tailed pterosaurs with long wrists (metacarpus), compared with the relatively long tails and short wrist bones of basal pterosaurs (\\"rhamphorhynchoids\\"). In 2004, Kevin Padian formally defined Pterodactyloidea as an apomorphy-based clade containing those species possessing a metacarpal at least 80% of the length of the humerus, homologous with that of Pterodactylus. A subgroup of pterodactyloids, called the Lophocratia, was named by David Unwin in 2003. Unwin defined the group as the most recent common ancestor of Pterodaustro guinazui and Quetzalcoatlus northropi, and all its descendants.Unwin, D. M., (2003). \\"On the phylogeny and evolutionary history of pterosaurs.\\" Pp. 139-190. in Buffetaut, E. & Mazin, J.-M., (eds.) (2003). Evolution and Palaeobiology of Pterosaurs. Geological Society of London, Special Publications 217, London, 1-347. This group was named for the presence of a head crest in most known species, though this feature has since been found in more primitive pterosaurs and was probably an ancestral feature for all pterodactyloids. There are competing theories of pterodactyloid phylogeny. Below is a cladogram showing the results of a phylogenetic analysis presented by Longrich, Martill, and Andres, 2018. This study found the two traditional groupings of ctenochasmatoids and kin as an early branching group, with all other pterodactyloids grouped into the Eupterodactyloidea.Longrich, N.R., Martill, D.M., and Andres, B. (2018). Late Maastrichtian pterosaurs from North Africa and mass extinction of Pterosauria at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. PLoS Biology, 16(3): e2001663. Some studies based on a different type of analysis have found that this basic division into primitive (archaeopterodactyloid) and advanced (eupterodactyloid) species may not be correct. Beginning in 2014, Steven Vidovic and David Martill constructed an analysis in which several pterosaurs traditionally thought of as archaeopterodactyloids closely related to the ctenochasmatoids may have been more closely related to ornithocheiroids, or in some cases, fall outside both groups. The results of their updated 2017 analysis are shown below.Vidovic, S.U. and Martill, D.M. (2017).

In 1883 he received his medical doctorate with a graduate thesis on Basedow‚Äôs disease, being promoted to m√©decin des h√¥pitaux several years later (1888). In 1907 he attained the chair of pathological anatomy at the Faculty of Medicine, and in 1917 was appointed to the chair of neurology, a position he held until 1925. In 1911 Marie became a member of the Acad√©mie de M√©decine. One of Marie's earlier contributions was a description of a disorder of the pituitary gland known as acromegaly. His analysis of the disease was an important contribution in the emerging field of endocrinology. Marie is also credited as the first to describe pulmonary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, cleidocranial dysostosis and rhizomelic spondylosis. In his extensive research of aphasia, his views concerning language disorders sharply contrasted the generally accepted views of Paul Broca (1824‚Äì1880). In 1907, he was the first person to describe the speech production disorder of foreign accent syndrome.Marie P. (1907).

As well as being known for traditional artistic forms, Castro Pacheco illustrated several children‚Äôs books and produced works in sculpture. He is more popularly known for his murals that invoke the spirit and history of the Mexican people. His works evoke a unique use of color and form.  Education and early career Born in M√©rida, Yucat√°n in Mexico, Castro Pacheco went on to become a well known international and local artist. Little has been published about the artist‚Äôs early life. While some scholars insist that he was a mostly self-taught artist, Castro Pacheco began his ‚Äúformal\\" training at the M√©rida School of Fine Arts at the age of 15.‚ÄùRodin, Carly. ‚ÄúCastro Pacheco Murals‚Äù, 2002, Yucatan Today, . While at the school, he honed his artistic skills in engraving and painting. During the time he spent at his school, he studied under the instruction of Italian artist Alfonso Cardone. It was at this school that he completed his first engravings in both wood and linoleum. Castro Pacheco spent six years at the school and produced many works during this early period in his artistic career. He also worked as an instructor and taught painting and drawing in the M√©rida area. Upon completion of his studies, Castro Pacheco is credited with co-founding La Escuela Libre de Las Artes Pl√°sticas de Yucat√°n in 1941. He also served as an instructor for the school. This school, like many others founded during this period, moved the art classroom and studio into an outdoor atmosphere, allowing the artist to more freely capture the beauty, color and realism of nature in art. The idea of outdoor schools of art was promoted by Alfredo Ramos Martin√©z. The idea centered on the promotion of more liberal methods for art instruction. In 1942, soon after the founding of the school, Castro Pacheco produced his first lithographs and displayed his painting and drawings in his first exhibit at the Galer√≠a de la Universidad de Yucat√°n. While in M√©rida, Castro Pacheco began work on several murals around the city. Between 1941 and 1942, he completed murals in the preschools (jardines de ni√±os) or playgrounds in M√©rida, as well as in several rural school buildings including the Escuela Campesina de Tocoh located in the rural henequen-producing area near M√©rida. He also completed al fresco murals with cultural and sport themes at the Biblioteca de la Union de Camioneros de Yucat√°n in M√©rida.  Career in Mexico City  In 1943 Castro Pacheco moved to Mexico City where his career and personal life took new directions. Castro Pacheco married during this time and fathered two children. Relating to his career in art, it was during his time in Mexico that he was first linked to the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular. The Taller was a group of artists and printmakers that formed in 1937 most likely from the dissolved Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios (League of revolutionary writers and artists) or LEAR which had been active in Mexico City prior to suffering from internal problems. The Taller is associated with popular political movements in Mexico during this time that included ‚Äúprogressive democratic‚Äù ideas and support for union workers and people of the lower classes. Castro Pacheco‚Äôs role at the Taller is debated.\\"Taller de Gr√°fica Popular.\\" La Estampa Mexicana. Ed. Hannes Meyer. Graphic Witness. http://www.graphicwitness.org/group/tgp.htm. According to some sources he was a somewhat important artist at the Taller, producing engravings and prints that exemplified the face of the poor and suffering in Mexico. According to other sources Castro Pacheco‚Äôs role at the Taller was brief and limited, only participating in one show with the group upon his arrival in Mexico City. It was through this first exhibit with the Taller however, that Castro Pacheco gained attention as a print maker and artist. A portfolio of his work was included at the exhibition which gained him attention in the Mexico City art scene and in the international scene as well. Castro Pacheco continued as a print maker until 1960. Working first with linoleum and then between 1945 and 1960 with predominantly wood cuts. His work was used to illustrate books, magazines and other publications. Notable examples include La flauta de ca√±a by Fernando Espejo and Los pozos sagrados by Miguel Alvarez Acosta. He also illustrated the essay La llanura aislada by Elmer Llanes Mar√≠n. Before returning to M√©rida in 1973, he also served at the director of the Escuela Nacional de Pintura y Escultura \\"La Esmeralda.\\"  First international exhibits  After his arrival and success in Mexico City, Castro Pacheco exhibited his works on an international level. In 1945 a selection of his paintings were exhibited the United States at a gallery in San Francisco, California. In 1947 his paintings were part of a collective exhibition in Havana, Cuba.  Later career and international study  Upon his return to Mexico City, in 1949 he was named a professor of the Escuela National de Artes Pl√°sticas. Castro Pacheco continued to produce works in various medium while in Mexico City. Moving away from tradition canvas, he is credited with producing the scenery for the ballet productions Guernica and La nube est√©ril at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City in 1953. Remaining a prominent and active artist, in 1963 Castro Pacheco earned a commission from the Instituci√≥n Nacional de Bellas Artes to travel to countries including Spain, Italy, France, England, the Netherlands and Belgium in order to study the artistic styles of these countries.  Return to M√©rida  After his travels abroad, Castro Pacheco returned to his native M√©rida in 1971 and continued to produce works. Well established as an artist, Castro Pacheco‚Äôs most well known works may be the murals that he completed between 1971 and 1979 for the states of Yucat√°n and Quer√©taro in Mexico. Between 1971 and 1979 Castro Pacheco completed 27 murals for the governor‚Äôs palace in M√©rida, Yucat√°n. These murals depict what some consider the realities of life in the Yucat√°n after the Spanish conquest as well as images and myths of native Maya tribes indigenous of the Yucat√°n region. The murals depict scenes of work and torture that the native peoples of the Yucat√°n endured under Spanish control. The reality of early henequen workers are seen in El henequen. A traditional creation myth of the native tribes is also depicted by Castro Pacheco in his work Hombres de maiz. The murals are oil paintings on large format canvas.  Non-traditional murals  Mural of Salvador Alvarado, former governor of Yucatan, displayed at the governor's palace, Merida (Yucatan), Mexico. Painted by Fernando Castro. The murals are on public display at the governor‚Äôs palace. Unlike traditional murals that are pained directly onto the wall, Castro Pacheco‚Äôs murals are unique, ‚Äútransportable murals.‚Äù Because the murals were not ‚Äúproduced and conceived on the walls, in relation to the architecture‚Äù his murals cannot be considered part of the traditional ‚ÄúMexican Renaissance‚Äù of which muralist such as Diego Rivera and Jesus Guerrero Galvan are a part. Because they are painted on large canvas and from a unique perspective, the murals appear as large format paintings, Castro Pacheco does not rely upon ‚Äúexaggerated foreshortening and perspectives‚Äù in these works the images are merely of large proportion.Conde,Teresa del.Castro Pacheco, Fernando and Franco Calvo,Enrique.Corona del Conde, Tessa, Fernando Castro Pacheco: colore imagen de Yucatan, 1st ed. (M√©rida, Yucat√°n, M√©xico: Universidad Aut√≥noma de Yucat√°n, Direcci√≥n General de Extensi√≥n, 1994), 230-50, .  Awards and prizes  To date Castro Pacheco remains a Mexican artist of note, especially in M√©rida where some of his most famous works are maintained. In M√©rida his works are well respected and on display in public areas. Through his lifetime Castro Pacheco earned several awards for his artistic accomplishments. In 1945 he earned his first award for his accomplishments in engraving in Mexico City. In 1954 his painting Salon de invierno earned a first place award from the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana in Mexico City. He went on to earn several other first place awards for his painting and engaging works from the Salon de Pl√°stica Mexicana. In 1964 he was awarded the Medalla Yucat√°n and in 1972 the Medalla Eligio Acorna from the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Yucat√°n and the Government of the State of the Yucat√°n. In 1993 the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Yucat√°n created a video to showcase the life work and talents of Castro Pacheco and in 1994 Castro Pacheco earned another honor when the Museo de Arte Contempor√°neo (MACAY)in M√©rida named a gallery in his honor. Collections of his work remain on display at the Galer√≠a de Arte Mexicano in Mexico City and at the Museo MACAY in M√©rida.  Artistic media and subjects  = Sketches and drawings = To his credit, Castro Pacheco has undertaken to produce works in various media. His earliest works are known for their graphic style. Sketches, pencil drawings and inked works on paper account for a majority of his early works. These works have in common Castro Pacheco‚Äôs attention to darkness. Studies in shade and chiaroscuro are captured in this period of his career. Using different shades of black and different degrees of darkness, his dark expressionist pieces are seen in his work Despertar, 1941. = Distemper and oils = Early distempers, oils and watercolors on the other hand created by Castro Pacheco use soft colors and pencil outlines to capture the beauty and fluidity of rural life in M√©rida. In his works from the period of the Escuela Libre the artist, captures landscapes in a subtle way. Drawing on the influences of the outdoor school, images of livestock are displayed using warm brown tones in his 1941 work El corral de la hacienda. Of his earliest works, Castro Pacheco‚Äôs attention to water-color techniques is also unique. A large amount of his concentration on landscapes, perspective and human form are seen in his water-color snap shots of people performing everyday activities. Examples include Pescadores, 1941. = Sculpture = As an artist, Castro Pacheco has given his two dimensional works form and substance through his works in sculpture. Mostly cast in bronze, it is estimated that the artist produced at least eight original works in this medium. He also produced about 35 enamels and 60 works in ceramic. = Woman as subject = One of the main subjects expressed in much of Castro Pacheco‚Äôs body of work is the female figure. Both nudes and robed models are frequently at the center of this works. Women that are the focal point of his work are of Mexican heritage. While the image of a woman alone is depicted more frequently by Castro Pacheco he also depicts women with male companions or with children.  Footnotes   References  *Carrillo AzpeÃ±itia, Rafael.

Loop 150 follows the route of old alignment of SH 71 through Bastrop. The route of SH 71 changed when the state built a bypass around Bastrop. Loop 150 leaves SH 71 on the west side of town and rejoins SH 71 on the east side, crossing the Colorado River. The historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is part of Loop 150.  History  Colorado River bridge used by Loop 150 until the 1990s The routing of the roadway had been proposed as early as 1919 as SH 3A. In 1924, the historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop was completed to provide access to both sides of the Colorado River. By 1926, the designation had been changed to SH 71. 50px The number was originally used for Spur 150 from SH 283 westward to Truscott. On May 23, 1951, this became part of the new FM 1756. On November 24, 1959, Loop 150 was designated to follow the old alignment of SH 71 in Bastrop following the completion of the new segment of SH 71 to the south. Loop 150 used the Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop until the completion of a new parallel bridge in 1993. The old bridge was closed to traffic and is still in use as a pedestrian bridge. The overpasses at the western terminus with SH 71 were completed over Loop 150 in 2005.

Route description  Looking west on Loop 150 from near its eastern terminus Loop 150 begins on the west side of Bastrop at a diamond interchange with SH 21 and SH 71. The loop heads northeast from the interchange to a crossing of the Colorado River. After the river crossing, the road heads east along Chestnut Street through Bastrop. Loop 150 continues to the east through the city to an intersection with SH 21 and 95. SH 21 enters the intersection from the south concurrent with SH 95 and begins to run concurrently with Loop 150 as the two head to the east. As the loop begins to curve back towards the southeast, SH 21 leaves the concurrency to the northeast. Access to nearby Bastrop State Park is provided by an intersection with Park Road 1 just east of the SH 21 intersection. Loop 150 continues to the southeast to its endpoint at a concurrent SH 71 and SH 95.

Like its mechanistic cousins, IP3 and cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose (Cyclic ADP- ribose), NAADP binds to and opens Ca2+ channels on intracellular organelles, thereby increasing the intracellular Ca2+ concentration which, in turn, modulates sundry cellular processes (see Calcium signalling). Structurally, it is a dinucleotide that only differs from the house-keeping enzyme cofactor, NADP by a hydroxyl group (replacing the nicotinamide amino group) and yet this minor modification converts it into the most potent Ca2+-mobilizing second messenger yet described. NAADP acts across phyla from plants to man. Discovery Cell stimuli select different Ca2+ stores by synthesising different second messengers. Shown for comparison are the ER-targeting messengers, IP3 and cADPR. In their landmark 1987 paper, Hon Cheung Lee and colleagues discovered not one but two Ca2+-mobilizing second messengers, cADPR and NAADP from the effects of nucleotides on Ca2+ release in sea urchin egg homogenates. It turns out that NAADP was a contaminant in commercial sources of NADP, but it was not until 1995 that its structure was solved. The first demonstration that NAADP could act in mammalian cells (pancreas) came four years later. Subsequently, NAADP has been detected in sources as diverse as human sperm, red and white blood cells, liver, and pancreas, to name but a few. Synthesis and degradation Speculative pathways for NAADP synthesis and degradation. ADP-ribosyl cyclase (ARC) family members (such as CD38) can synthesise NAADP via the base-exchange reaction (NicAcid, Nicotinic Acid; NiAm, nicotinamide). NAADP may be broken down to NAAD via a Ca2+-sensitive phosphatase, or to 2-phosphoadenosine diphosphoribose (ADPRP) by CD38 itself. For simplicity, enzyme topology has been ignored (see below). = Kinetics and transduction = The first demonstration that NAADP levels increase in response to an extracellular stimulus arose from studying sea urchin fertilization (NAADP changed in both the eggs and sperm upon contact). Subsequently, other cell types have followed suit, as exemplified by the pancreas (acinar and beta cells), T-cells, and smooth muscle. Levels increase very rapidly ‚Äî and possibly precede the increase in the other messengers IP3 and cADPR‚Äî but can be very transient (spiking and returning to basal levels within seconds). The transduction mechanisms that couple cell stimuli to such NAADP increases are ill-defined, with some suggestions of cyclic AMP or cytosolic Ca2+ itself stimulating synthesis. = Synthetic enzymes = Regardless of the details, an outstanding issue is that the physiological route of NAADP synthesis has still not been unequivocally identified ‚Äî neither the reaction(s) nor the enzyme(s). Clearly, it is theoretically possible there may be multiple routes of synthesis, but this would be unprecedented in the second messenger world. To date, the most favoured hypothesis is the so-called base-exchange reaction (nicotinic acid + NADP ‚Üí NAADP + nicotinamide; catalyzed by ADP-ribosyl cyclases) which are a family of enzymes that include CD38 and CD157 in mammals (and orthologs in sea urchin and Aplysia ovotestis). These were first discovered as the synthetic enzymes for cADPR but later revealed to be multifunctional, promiscuous enzymes that can also produce NAADP. Certainly NAADP production can occur in vitro but whether it occurs in vivo is another question (because genetic knockout or knock-down of ADP- ribosyl cyclases has no effect on NAADP production in some cell types), and there may be other routes which require different substrates and enzymes. The SARM1 enzyme also catalyzes the formation of NAADP from NAD+. The first chemical synthesis of NAADP was achieved in 2004 using a chemoenzymatic approach: a total chemical synthesis of NADP and then conversion of this to NAADP enzymatically. = Degradative enzymes = Like any second messenger system, the signal must be terminated and there must be routes for NAADP removal but again, little is known with any degree of certainty. A 2'-3'-phosphatase stimulated by Ca2+ has been proposed in brain and, possibly in pancreatic acinar cells, that catabolises NAADP to inactive NAAD. More recently, CD38 has also been proposed to breakdown NAADP (to ADPRP ‚Äî see inset). NAADP may also be reduced to NAADPH. = NAADP-selective physiology = Hardly surprisingly, the three major second messengers do not do the same thing and cannot always substitute for each other. The physiological consequences of Ca2+ release by each messenger may be different i.e. NAADP couples to downstream responses that cannot be mimicked by IP3 and cADPR. For example, NAADP selectively stimulates neuronal differentiation, or exocytosis in immune cells. Target organelle In contrast to IP3 and cyclic ADP-ribose which predominantly mobilize Ca2+ from the neutral and abundant endoplasmic reticulum (ER) store, NAADP selectively targets acidic Ca2+ stores ‚Äî usually less abundant than the ER but with a pivotal role that belies their size. This paradigm shift away from the ER derives from seminal studies, again in sea urchin egg, that showed NAADP-mediated Ca2+ release was sensitive to agents that target acidic organelles (e.g. bafilomycin A1) but was less sensitive to ones that interfere with ER Ca2+ storage (e.g. thapsigargin). = Acidic Ca2+ store = This is a blanket term that encompasses a spectrum of acidic vesicles that include endosomes, lysosomes, and lysosome-related organelles and secretory vesicles and acidocalcisomes. They are a highly dynamic continuum of vesicles with a rich variety of established biochemical roles in cells, to which Ca2+ storage can now be added. Their luminal pH is one characteristic that distinguishes a given vesicle class from another: where endosomes are weakly acidic (pH 6-6.5), lysosomes are typically the most acidic (pH 4.5-5.0) and secretory vesicles are typically pH 5.5. Ca2+ is seen to be increasingly important for endo-lysosomal function, e.g. trafficking and autophagy. Aberrations in Ca2+ signals can have pathophysiological consequences, including lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann Pick C and Mucolipidosis IV. When NAADP mobilizes Ca2+ from these stores, the pH of the stores concomitantly increases (becomes more alkaline), as testified by studies in sea urchin egg, mammalian heart and pancreas. Whether this has consequences for vesicle (or NAADP) function remains to be seen, but luminal pH is usually crucial for resident protein activity. = Ca2+ uptake = Simplified pathways regulating luminal Ca2+ (left) and pH (right) in acidic organelles. Ca2+ uptake can be mediated either by a Ca2+/H+ exchanger (CHX, that exploits the pH gradient) or a Ca2+ pump (powered by ATP hydrolysis). The low luminal pH is driven by the H+ pump, the V-ATPase, and aided by essential counterion movements, e.g. chloride uptake, that acts as a charge shunt essential for optimal proton uptake. In other Ca2+-storing organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi, stores are filled by calcium ATPase pumps, typified by the ubiquitous members of the SERCA or the SPCA (secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase) families respectively. Ca2+ uptake by acidic stores occurs via other proteins: in yeast and plants (the best understood systems) the acidic vacuoles host two uptake pathways: a high affinity Ca2+-ATPase and a low affinity Ca2+/H+ antiporter (or exchanger, generically denoted as CHX). The pumps are different from the SERCA family (and, importantly, are insensitive to their inhibitor, thapsigargin) whereas the exchanger exploit the H+ gradient to drive Ca2+ uptake against its concentration gradient. The genes encoding these proteins are well-defined. In higher organisms, the situation is less clear. Ca2+ uptake usually occurs via a thapsigargin-insensitive pathway (therefore precluding SERCA involvement) and appears to be dependent upon the H+ gradient; whether this occurs via a single (unknown) CHX or via exchangers in series (e.g. Na+/H+ exchanger coupled to a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger) is unproven. Acidic vesicles in some cell types may well take a leaf out of the yeasts'/plants' book and host two uptake pathways, but whether this is a widespread template is unclear. In the absence of selective Ca2+ uptake inhibitors (often because we do not even know the protein/route), it is common to indirectly inhibit Ca2+ uptake by collapsing the thermodynamic drive (the H+ gradient). The H+ gradient can be eliminated either with H+ ionophores (protonophores) such as nigericin or monensin or by inhibiting the V-ATPase that generates the H+ gradient with compounds such as bafilomycin A1 or concanamycin.  Target channel (TPCs)  Even from the early pioneering work in sea urchin egg, it was clear from the pharmacological profile that NAADP acted upon a different channel from the IP3 receptor and ryanodine receptor and this has recently been borne out by the molecular identification of the NAADP receptor as members of the TPC (two-pore channel) family. As structural intermediates between single domain TRP and four-domain Voltage-dependent calcium channel, the TPCs form oligomers (possibly dimers) to form the functional Ca2+ channel. Appropriately, these channels reside on acidic organelles (including different classes of endosomes and lysosomes) likely due to the presence of endolysomal targeting sequences. The effect of genetic manipulation of TPC levels (i.e. over-expression, knock-down or knock-out) is consistent with TPCs being the NAADP-gated channel. Moreover, TPCs recapitulate many of the characteristics of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release i.e. they promote Ca2+ release from acidic stores, correlate with NAADP-binding sites, exhibit a bell-shaped NAADP concentration-response curve, sensitivity to the NAADP antagonist, Ned-19, and provide trigger Ca2+ that is subsequently amplified by ER Ca2+ channels. = Isoforms = There are 3 genes that encode three isoforms of TPC1-3 that differ substantially from each other in their primary sequence (but these differences are preserved across species, such that human and sea urchin TPC1 are more closely related than are human TPC1 and human TPC2). Moreover, the TPC isoforms exhibit different organellar distributions, with TPC1 being found throughout the endo-lysosomal system whereas TPC2 shows a more restricted late-endosomal/lysosomal localization. = Controversy = In spite of a burgeoning literature supporting TPCs as the NAADP-regulated channel, this was challenged in 2012/13 by reports that TPCs are, instead, Na+ channels regulated by the endo-lysosomal lipid, Phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate, PI(3,5)P2 and also by metabolic state (via ATP and mTOR). As a result of this, several groups reinvestigated the permeability properties of TPCs and their role in NAADP-induced Ca2+ release. They agreed that TPCs are indeed permeable to Na+ but they could not necessarily recapitulate the Na+ selectivity shown in the 2012/13 studies. These groups therefore concluded that TPCs were cation channels that conducted both Ca2+ and Na+ (analogous to the NMDA receptor of the plasma membrane). As for activation by ligands, all groups agree that TPCs are modulated by PI(3,5)P2, though its role is considered by some to be more of a 'permissive' factor rather than an acute signal per se. As for NAADP itself, the conclusion in 2012 that TPCs are not involved in NAADP signalling was partly due to the fact that their transgenic mice (designed to knockout both TPC1 and TPC2; double-knockout, DKO) apparently retained sensitivity to NAADP. However, others have questioned whether these mice are true DKO when they are predicted to retain >90% of the TPC protein sequences (i.e. they express only mildly truncated TPCs which are functional ). In a different DKO mouse that is demonstrably TPC-null, NAADP responses are completely abolished. On balance, the controversy has been somewhat resolved and it is clear that TPCs are absolutely essential for NAADP. The permeability properties are more equivocal: why some groups observe a Na+ selectivity while others see a mixed Na+/Ca2+ permeability is currently unclear. The necessarily artificial experimental conditions for such as a demanding technique as single-lysosome patch clamp makes it harder to be dogmatic about which ions permeate under native, physiological conditions. It is likely (and the simpler model) that TPCs function as NAADP-gated Ca2+-permeable channels, but it cannot be formally excluded that TPCs, acting as Na+ channels, play a permissive role in a more complex ionic circuit that supports NAADP-induced Ca2+ release . Crystal structures of TPC1 from Arabidopsis thaliana reveal the dimeric nature of the molecule, but thus far do not explain the cation selectivity mechanism. = NAADP binding protein = IP3 binds directly to its cognate IP3 receptor which is therefore a true ligand-gated ion channel. In contrast, NAADP may not bind directly to TPCs but may require an intermediate unknown accessory protein. In sea urchin egg homogenate, the binding protein(s) may be smaller than TPCs themselves, judging by photoaffinity labelling with [32P]azido- NAADP. Therefore, the NAADP receptor is likely to be a multi-protein complex on acidic vesicles. = Regulatory factors =  Luminal ions  In addition to NAADP gating the channel, there is evidence that the luminal pH also affects TPC channel activity, either TPC1 or TPC2 . However, a clear consensus on the effect of pH has not been reached with some suggesting that acidic pH favours TPC1 or TPC2 opening, whereas others report that a more alkaline pH favours TPC2 opening. Furthermore, luminal Ca2+ also promotes TPC1 and TPC2 opening (in the latter case, luminal Ca2+ also sensitizes TPCs to NAADP (analogous to luminal Ca2+ regulation of IP3Rs and RyRs), but this demands wider study across isoforms and species. This is one way by which cross-talk can occur between acidic Ca2+ stores and the ER i.e. Ca2+ release from the ER can 'prime' acidic Ca2+ stores and promote further NAADP-dependent Ca2+ responses .  Cytosolic ions  To date, the majority of evidence is against the NAADP receptor being regulated by either cytosolic Ca2+ or pH. Pharmacology = NAADP inhibitors = Recently, a selective cell-permeant NAADP antagonist, trans-Ned-19 has been discovered which blocks Ca2+ signals and downstream Ca2+-dependent processes such as differentiation. Prior to that, only high concentrations of blockers of L-type Ca2+ channels (e.g. diltiazem, dihydropyridines) could be used (with obvious concerns over non- NAADP effects). Although not true antagonism, the NAADP 'receptor' can self- inactivate when bound to non-releasing concentrations of NAADP itself. Such inactivating pre-pulses of NAADP were the first strategy for implicating NAADP in subsequent physiological pathways. = NAADP activators = NAADP is charged and cannot cross cell membranes. Therefore, an inactive, lipophilic ester precursor (NAADP/AM) has been synthesised which crosses membranes and rapidly regenerates NAADP in the cytosol following the action of endogenous esterases. Caged NAADP is an inactive, membrane-impermeant analog of NAADP that can be introduced into cells by microinjection or a patch pipette. Flash photolysis with a UV light source rapidly converts this into NAADP, allowing the experimenter to precisely manipulate NAADP levels in time and space. = Ca2+ storage = An indirect means of inhibiting NAADP action is to deplete its target Ca2+ stores. As noted above, this usually entails collapsing the H+ gradient with either V-ATPase inhibitors (e.g. Bafilomycin A1) or protonophores (e.g. nigericin or monensin). In platelets it has been suggested that SERCA3 inhibition with tBHQ can also abrogate NAADP-dependent signals. Transport The two paralogous enzymes- transmembrane CD38 and GPI anchored CD157, that produce NAADP (and cADPR) in humans both have their active synthesis site in the ectodomain. Though this may involve vesicular synthesis but it has been shown that it is produced at the extracellular sites, and also can act when produced by a different cell or added artificially from outside. So the NAADP has to enter the cell either by diffusion or by transport. Considering the fact that the substrate of NAADP synthesis (NADP) itself is very sparse in the extracellular medium, a purse diffusion based mechanism has been suspected to be less likely than a transporter mediated path. This is compatible with recent data which indicate a carrier mediated transport partially blockable by dipyridamole and cold temperature. Lysosomal Ca2+-Signalling Modalities The ER and acidic Ca2+ stores have similarities as well as key differences. Both transport Ca2+ into their lumina where it is stored, and is subsequently released in response to stimuli by opening resident Ca2+ channels. Indeed, the free [Ca2+] of each is broadly similar (~0.5-1.0 mM). However, they differ in the cohort of transporters, their luminal pH and their total volume per cell. The total amount of Ca2+ that is stored in each is a product of the volume and concentration; since the [Ca2+] is the same for each, the total amount of releasable Ca2+ is directly proportional to the organellar volume and therefore lysosomes can release only a small amount Ca2+ of when compared to the ER. This is important because the maximal Ca2+ release from lysosomes is so small that it is frequently 'invisible' in global Ca2+ recordings e.g. using cytosolic fluorescent reporters. In contrast, ER-derived Ca2+ is globally substantial and the predominant intracellular signal visible in global recordings. If lysosomal Ca2+ release is so small, how then can it affect cellular physiology? The answer is that it can exert its effects in two different signalling modalities: local and global, as shall be described. =Solo & Local= Since the diffusion of Ca2+ in the cell is spatially restricted, Ca2+ released by a channel does not travel far from its source (the channel mouth) ‚Äî model estimates are in the 50 nm range. Therefore, the small total amount of Ca2+ released from lysosomal channels will form locally high [Ca2+] domains around the cytosolic face of lysosomal Ca2+ channels. By strategic placement of Ca2+-sensitive decoding proteins within these domains (e.g. in a complex with the channel), local Ca2+ signals can stimulate Ca2+-dependent events ‚Äî crucially, even in the absence of a global cytosolic Ca2+ signal. This is the modality when lysosomes are acting on their own. The NAADP/TPC axis has been reported to exhibit such signal compartmentation, such local Ca2+ signalling, in different physiological settings. In other words, this local modality can explain why some processes are driven uniquely by NAADP/TPCs rather than other Ca2+ signalling pathways. For example, NAADP/TPCs are unique drivers of cell killing by Cytotoxic_T_cells https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23177477/. Similarly, Phagocytosis via the Fc_receptor in the Macrophage is driven only by highly local Ca2+ domains generated by NAADP/TPCs (whereas the global ER Ca2+ signals play no role)https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32510172/. This unique dependence is not restricted to immune cells, but is also observed in neurons during Long-term_potentiation https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30482851/, and neuronal differentiation https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23776607/https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16595650/. Angiogenesis is another NAADP/TPC-dependent pathway https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25331892/. =Combined & Global= A different modality is when lysosomes do not just act alone, but in concert with the ER. In this scenario, lysosomes first supply a local, 'trigger' Ca2+ release that then secondarily recruits the IP3Rs or RyRs on the ER by Calcium- induced_calcium_release (the 'amplifier'). In this mode, lysosomes indirectly evoke a global cytosolic Ca2+ signal (which is actually mediated by the ER). In this way, lysosomal Ca2+ release is amplified, in what is referred to as the 'trigger hypothesis'.

History Prior to the development of K. Hovnanian's Town and Country Estates in 1998, the area included little more than a collection of 18th and 19th century farms and rural lanes. Its historic rural character may be seen in an estimate from 1882 which listed the Pleasant Plains population at 46.Brahms, p. 430. An icon in the area has been the early 19th century general store and blacksmith shop buildings known since the late 1800s as Laird's Brothers Hardware and Laird's Corner Store.Brahms, pp. 213, 430-431. Another area feature is the Pleasant Plains Cemetery on South Middlebush Road just south of Laird's Corner that has been in use from early settlement of the area until the present day.Brahms, p. 559. Since the early 19th century (and possibly even earlier), the area featured a one-room schoolhouse known as the Pleasant Plains School. Located on the north side of Suydam Road about a half mile west of Laird's Corner, it remained in use until about 1931 when the Township started decommissioning its one-room schoolhouses in favor of larger regional schools. Moved across the road on log rollers, it was converted into a residence and used until the late 20th century when it was threatened with demolition to make way for the Town and County development. Instead, it was moved to the Township's Municipal Complex on DeMott Lane where it awaits further rehabilitation.Brahms, pp. 355, 509. The Six Mile Run Historic District listed on the New Jersey and National Register of Historic Places includes a number of properties in the Pleasant Plains area. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, Pleasant Plains had a total area of 3.221 square miles (8.342 km2), including 3.215 square miles (8.328 km2) of land and 0.006 square miles (0.014 km2) of water (0.17%).

It is also sometimes called pre event time histogram or PETH. These histograms are used to visualize the rate and timing of neuronal spike discharges in relation to an external stimulus or event. The peristimulus time histogram is sometimes called perievent time histogram, and post-stimulus and peri-stimulus are often hyphenated. The prefix peri, for through, is typically used in the case of periodic stimuli, in which case the PSTH show neuron firing times wrapped to one cycle of the stimulus. The prefix post is used when the PSTH shows the timing of neuron firings in response to a stimulus event or onset. To make a PSTH, a spike train recorded from a single neuron is aligned with the onset, or a fixed phase point, of an identical stimulus repeatedly presented to an animal. The aligned sequences are superimposed in time, and then used to construct a histogram.  Construction procedure  # Align spike sequences with the onset of a stimulus that is repeated n times. For periodic stimuli, wrap the response sequence back to time zero after each time period T, and count n as the total number of periods of data. # Divide the stimulus period or observation period T into N bins of size \\\\Delta. # Count the number of spikes ki from all n sequences that fall in the bin i. # Draw a bar-graph histogram with the bar-height of bin i given by \\\\frac{k_i}{n \\\\Delta} in units of estimated spikes per second at time i\\\\ \\\\Delta.

Libraries across the country were damaged, and it is estimated that 1.2 million volumes of books and other reading materials were destroyed in the disaster. Out of the 950 public libraries in Sri Lanka, 55 libraries were affected and 28 were completely destroyed. Several libraries were used as refuge centres or hospitals in the aftermath of the tsunami, and surviving furniture and collections suffered as a result. One estimate of damage to school libraries in Sri Lanka indicates that of the 9,790 schools in the country, 182 schools were directly affected by the tsunami and an additional 282 schools were damaged because of their use as refugee camps after the tsunami. While not all of these schools had a full-fledged library, most had a book closet or other collection of materials. At least 165 school libraries were damaged by the tsunami.Premila Gamage and Maria Cotera. (2005). Rising from the rubble: The Sri Lanka Library Association rehabilitation project. Impact:50-52. Compounding the damage, many schools had large collection of textbooks on hand for distribution to students at the beginning of the school year in January. Damage reports range from furniture damage to lost collections to complete destruction of the physical building. Sri Lankan government departments lost public records to the tsunami. In the Southern province, all electoral registers were destroyed, along with 600,000 land deeds from the Department of the Surveyor General.Amarasiri, Upali. (2005).

At the end of the 2009 season, Parker quit most of his sponsors, reputedly to become a sushi chef, and dropped out of the snowboarding world. Ahead of the 2011 season, it was announced that Travis was once again riding for K2. Travis is known for his original riding style and approach to snowboarding, including vowing to ride switch for the entire 2009 season. Parker had a pro-model board for several years while on K2, the Parka, and helped Capita develop the Unorthodox (in subsequent seasons known as the Shapeshifter) board, notable for having a cutaway at both nose and tail. Parker featured in a number of Totally Board films. He was a central part of Robot Food, and featured in all three of their films (Afterbang, 2003, Lame, 2004, and Afterlame, 2005). Subsequently, he embarked on a series of films which differed greatly from traditional snowboard films. In BikeCar (Fountaincat, 2007), Parker, Louie Fountain and Scotty Witlake cycle through the Pacific Northwest in a homemade pedal-driven vehicle, riding at such locations as Mount Bachelor. In 2011's December webseries, he and Andrew Crawford travel through eastern Europe snowboarding mainly at small or obscure locations, including Zakopane in Poland. The film also features Marco Grilc. Parker also features in The Gap Session (BlankPaper, 2006) and DC Mountain Lab. His return to professional snowboarding was featured in the movie Respect Your Elders (Airblaster/K2 Snowboarding, 2010). In 2004 Travis founded Snowdays Foundation with educator Patrick Edwards. Snowdays Foundation is an all-volunteer organization dedicated to youth empowerment through snowboarding.

It is one of the important scientific and cultural centers in Kurdistan region. It was founded by Professor Dr.Mohammed Salih Beg in 1968 (Dr Salih's project which he submitted to the government in 1958 and agreed in 1968), and re reopened in 1992. The main campus is in Sulaimani city, and satellite campuses are in the towns of Khanaqin, Kalar, Halabja and Chamchamal. The university has a total yearly enrollment of more than 4000 undergraduate and postgraduate students. The university offers a variety of major programmes including medical, engineering, humanities, law, fine arts, physical education, political science, degree and in some specialties to postgraduate degrees such as High Diploma, MSc, MA and PhD. The university has a variety of other extracurricular activities, too. History The university was founded and secured by Professor Dr. Mohammed Mohammed Salih Beg in 1968 (Professor of Modern European History, History of England and Political Science). It was his primary aim in 1958 after gaining his PHD in 1957 from the University of Chicago -United States of America. The University was consisted of five faculties Medicine, Engineering, Science, Agriculture and faculty of Art, but during the years that followed, the number of faculties increased dramatically as a result of growing demands for higher education in the country. In 1981, Ba'ath Regime transferred this academic establishment to the city of Erbil (Hawler) because of political activities against the regime, changing the name to University of Salahaddin. In 1992 University of Sulaimani was re opened by tremendous efforts and enthusiasm of many Kurdish intellectuals and academics with the people of Sulaimani and was officially reopened on 14 November. This university is the mother of other universities in Kurdistan. It is the oldest University in Kurdistan proper, therefore, it has its own significance in the history of Kurdistan.  Faculties  thumbOld Campus Entrance Today University of Sulaimani includes (11) colleges, students obtain BSc and BA degrees in various fields of study. The colleges are: * Faculty of Agricultural Sciences * College of Commerce * College of Veterinary Medicine * Faculty of Engineering * Faculty of Administration * Faculty of Law and Politics * Faculty of Language & Humanities * Faculty of Medical Sciences * Faculty of Physical & Basic Education * Faculty of Science and Science Education * Faculty of Humanities Education (Saidsadiq) To provide the necessary teaching staff, the University also awards MA, MSc and PhD degrees in different fields of study. In 2009-2010 academic year, 24488 students attended classes as full-time students, there are (924) postgraduate students, there are ( 1357 ) teaching staff and ( 2329 ) administration staff too. The new campus New Campus Entrance Apart from the current campus which most of the colleges are located, the new campus of the university is located at the outskirts of Sulaymaniyah city and it is currently under construction, the entire project should be completed by 2012, the new campus is of world standards with to date technologies and modern design, if completed by time it would be the one of the largest campuses in the region, the budget for its construction is nearly 450 million US dollars, despite of the new campus the colleges of Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, and Nursing will remain in the old campus and there were rumors that these four colleges will be categorized as a whole different university under the name (Sulaimani Medical University) or any other name. Institutes Apart from this university, there are many technical, medical, and fine arts institutes in Sulaymaniyah.

The standard controlling its composition is maintained by The Aluminum Association. It has generally good mechanical properties and is heat treatable and weldable. It is similar to the British aluminium alloy HE9. 6063 is the most common alloy used for aluminium extrusion. It allows complex shapes to be formed with very smooth surfaces fit for anodizing and so is popular for visible architectural applications such as window frames, door frames, roofs, and sign frames. Applications requiring higher strength typically use 6061 or 6082 instead.

John Dube was also the first President of what became the ANC. The school was chosen by President Nelson Mandela as the place where he would cast his vote in the first racially inclusive election in South Africa in 1994.

Retrieved 31 July 3013 The school, also known as the Ohlange Native Industrial Institute, was the first educational institution in South Africa to be founded by a black person. The land for the school was donated by Chief Mqhawe of the AmaQadi. John had been in contact with Booker T. Washington and modeled the school after the Tuskegee University in America. As a result, the Zulu Christian Industrial Institute laid emphasis on developing self-reliance in its students. In 1901 the school was renamed the Ohlange Institute. The school was called \\"Ohlange\\" by Dube based on the word \\"uhlanga\\" which means the point of new growth in a plant or an ancestor for a descended family. Ohlange Shoemaking class John Dube on the right The school was so popular initially that students were sleeping without beds. The finances were difficult in the first few years. A solution to this came from an American committee that supported Dube's belief that Christian conversion could be achieved via industrial education. A leading member of the committee was the Illinois pastor Sidney Dix Strong who had visited South Africa and had included the Ohlange Institute to his itinerary. Strong's wife died on the journey back to Chicago and Strong decided to use the Ohlange cause to distract himself from his loss. Strong was able to arrange for the Dube's to meet Douglas and Emaroy June Smith who became rich due to patent medicines and in time from the Pepsodent toothpaste brand. They donated thousands of dollars to the school which enabled for more teachers to be employed. This was in addition to the money that Dube obtained from the family of Anson Phelps Stokes. Mrs Dube and her early years needlework class. By 1904 the finances needed further attention and Dube was unable to find any help in Natal. He had to return to America and he left John Mdima in charge of both the school and the newspaper. In Brooklyn he met the new chair of the committee S. Parkes Cadman who was pastor of the Central Congregational church in Brooklyn. Cadman reorganised the funding arranging for benefactors to sponsor students for ¬£30 a year and arranging for Dube's helpers and family including John Mdima to go to college. The Dubes spent fifteen months in the states with John speaking and his wife singing. June Emaroy Smith was particularly generous and funded the 1907 construction of a boy's building. Dube noted in his talks that the Afro American was largely Christian whereas the native African had only limited access to the Christian message. The 1917 Girls building at Ohlange In its early years the school taught not only basic education but also vocational skills such as journalism, shoe and dressmaking, carpentry, motor mechanics and agriculture. Dube contributed to the administration as well as teaching journalism. The academic side was not ignored and in 1915 the first Ohlange students went to study at the University College of the Cape of Good Hope. 1917 saw the construction of a girls dormitory. The purpose here was to establish a teacher training centre which was seen as a female career. Enoch Sontonga song which later became a South African national anthem became better known after Ohlange Institute's choir used it.

While his paintings are formulaic in nature, Phillips paintings were under constant construction, evolving as he added or discarded what he found successful, while taking care to add personal details that spoke to the identity of those who hired him. He is most famous for his portraits of children in red, although children only account for ten percent of his entire body of work. The most well known of this series, Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog, would be sold for one million dollars, a first for folk art. His paintings hung mostly unidentified, spare for some recognition in the collections like those of Edward Duff Balken, for decades until his oeuvre was reconstructed by Barbara Holdridge and Larry Holdridge, collectors and students of American folk art, with the support of the art historian Mary Black. Ammi Phillip's body of work was expanded upon their discovery that the mysterious paintings of a \\"Kent Limner\\" and \\"Border Limner\\" were indeed his.Black, Mary Ammi Phillips: Portrait Painter 1788-1865. Clarkson N. Potter, Inc., New York: 1981. preface.  Life  Henrietta Door, 1814, Princeton University Art Museum, an example of Ammi Phillips earlier work Phillips was born in Colebrook, Connecticut, on April 24, 1788, to Samuel Phillips (1760-1842), a farmer by trade and veteran of the Revolutionary war, and Millea Phillips (1763-1861), as one of eleven children, beginning a life that spanned the period of George Washington's presidency and ending with the American Civil War. Phillips moved out of his family home at some point before 1810, and married Laura Brockway in Nassau, New York on March 18th, 1813. Laura Brockway's family had roots in Sharon, Connecticut. It is in 1811 that the first signed portraits produced by Phillips are identified, meaning he was by then beginning his career as a portrait painter. Ammi Phillips and Lauren (Brockway) Phillips had four sons, Henry, George, William, and Russell Phillips, and one unknown daughter, although the order in which they had them is unclear, and one may not have survived. Laura Brockway died February 2nd, 1830 at the age of 38, and Phillips remarried Jane Ann Caulkins, twenty years his junior, five months later. Jane would have four more children, Anna, Jane, Samuel, and Sarah Phillips. Sarah Phillips would die at the age of four and a half. Ammi Phillips reported he and his family living in a different residence in every recorded census. In 1820, he reported living in Troy, New York. He sold this property in 1828, moving to a forty-five acre property in Rhinebeck, New York. This land would be sold in part to its original owner as well as his brother- in-law, as the family moved yet again inside New York to a one acre property in Amenia. In the 1850 census, Phillips is recorded for the first time under the profession of portrait painter, now living in North East, New York. In 1855 he was recorded as \\"artist\\", and was living in New Mariborough, Massachusetts. In 1860 and 1865 he was living in Curtisville (now Interlaken), Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Career While it is unknown is Ammi Phillip was entirely self taught, or had interacted or been taught by other artists in the Colebrook, Connecticut area, it is known that there were such painters work Phillips might have seen growing up. Rueben Moulthrop, Nathaniel Wales, Uriah Brown, and Samuel Broadbent are all artists traced by documents to the area, and stylistic elements of their work can be seen in Phillip's own early paintings. He enters the documentary record as an artist himself in 1809, at the age of 21, with advertisements in both The Berkshire ReporterHollander, Stacy C. (Spring 1994). \\"Revisiting Ammi Phillips\\". Folk Art. 42‚Äì45. Retrieved June 16, 2014. and a Pittsfield, Massachusetts, tavern proclaiming his talent for painting \\"correct likenesses,\\" distinguished by ‚Äúperfect shadows and elegantly dressed in the prevailing fashions of the day.‚Äù Although Phillips also advertised his talent for \\"fancy painting, silhouettes, sign and ornamental painting,\\" he soon specialized as a portraitist. Phillips was recorded in the diary of Dr. Samuel Barstow of Great Barrington, Massachusetts, dated October 6th, 1811, mentioning small portraits he had commissioned of himself and his wife. His work satisfied the local standard, and within two years Phillips was receiving regular portrait commissions from community leaders in this area of western Massachusetts. Phillips earliest recorded portraits are that of Rev. and Mrs. Ephraim Judson and Gideon Smith of Stockbridge, Massachusetts in 1811. Gideon Smith was an innkeeper, and displayed his portrait in his tavern, implying that instead of a struggling painter trying to make ends meet, Phillips may have been quite business savvy. Unlike Phillips' illustrious predecessors in American art, such as Benjamin West of Philadelphia and John Singleton Copley of Boston, Phillips lived and worked not in established city centers, but new territories opening up throughout New England and the Mid-Atlantic. Though he was able to successfully market his skills from a young age, it's likely that the relatively sparse demand for painted portraits, a luxury good, was the main factor necessitating an itinerant career that saw the artist move regularly, family perhaps in tow, between western Massachusetts, Connecticut, and the Hudson River Valley. The artist moved on as he exhausted the demand of the local community for painted \\"likenesses\\". This wandering lifestyle is archetypically Romantic, rather contrasting with the bourgeois domesticity of his portraits, which are almost always set within interiors. A letter from the American artist John Vanderlyn to his nephew, John Vanderlyn, Jr., from Kingston, New York, dated September 9, 1825, stated, \\"Were I to begin life again, I should not hesitate to follow this plan, that is, to paint portraits cheap and slight, for the mass of folks can't judge of the merits of a well finished picture, I am more and more persuaded of this. Indeed, moving about through the country as Phillips did and probably still does, must be an agreeable way of passing ones time. I saw four of his works at Jacobus Hardenburgh's the other day painted a year or two ago, which seemed to satisfy them.\\"Black and Holdridge 1969, p. 14. Such comments from a well established academic painter such as Vanderlyn positions Phillips not as a wandering peddler of art, but instead as an artist with social and economic importance. This is also visible in his clientele, which consisted of judges, doctors and business owners. This supercilious opinion of Phillips' artistic worth can be contrasted with the conclusion of the twentieth-century art critic Hilton Kramer, who wrote in The New York Times in 1970, \\"In the Plain and Fancy exhibition, for example, there are five portraits by the amazing Ammi Phillips (1788‚Äì1865), and at least two of them‚Äîthe portraits of Mrs. Isaac Cox and of Deacon Benjamin Benedict (both about 1836)‚Äîare of superb quality. To the modern eye, the portrait of Mrs. Cox particularly speaks with a clarity, precision, and sympathy that places it considerably nearer to our own standards of artistic probity than anything to be found in the common run of 'serious' painting at the time. If this is 'innocent' painting, it is innocent only of those flatulent academic pretensions which remained the curse of so much of our art in the 19th century.\\" Ammi Phillips lived into the era of the daguerreotype, and his last portraits show this influence. He died on July 15, 1865, age 72, in Curtisville, Massachusetts, just outside Stockbridge, where his death certificate is filed in the Town Hall. He was buried in Amenia, New York, where he had lived earlier in his life. Death Phillips died on July 11, 1865, at his home in Curtisville. He was seventy-eight years and three months old. His body was buried in Amenia, New York. His extensive, continuously evolving body of artwork over a period of five decades provided posterity with a vast archive of early American self-fashioning. Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog Ammi Phillips, Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog, 1830-1835Phillip's most famous work is Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog, which is in the collection of the American Folk Art Museum in New York. It was purchased for the museum at one million dollars, a first for folk art. The painting is one of a group of four portraits of children in vibrant red with a dog on the floor that Phillips produced while living in Dutchess County, New York, in the mid-1830s.folkartmuseum.org.

Nicholas B.A. Nicholson wrote a novel told from the perspective of the depicted girl.goodreads.com. Retrieved June 16, 2014. Ken Johnson, an art critic for The New York Times, has repeatedly praised the picture. In a review of the American Folk Art Museum's exhibition Self-Taught Genius, Johnson contends that Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog is \\"one of the most beautiful paintings made by any American artist ever.\\" Previously he described the work as \\"heartbreakingly lovely.\\" The novelist and art historian Teju Cole, in the third chapter of his debut novel Open City, describes a visit to the American Folk Art Museum. The narrator notices and evaluates Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog: \\"At the landing of the first flight of stairs, I saw an oil portrait of a young girl in a starchy red dress holding a white cat. A dog peeked out from under her chair. The details were saccharine, but they could not obscure the force and beauty of the painting.\\"Cole, Teju. Open City. New York: Random House Trade Paperbacks, 2012. P. 36. Rediscovery and Reconstruction of Work Phillips' modern rediscovery began in 1924, when a group of portraits of women, shown leaning forward in three-quarter view and wearing dark dresses, were displayed in an antique show in Kent, Connecticut. The anonymous painter of these strongly colored works, which dated from the 1830s, became known as the \\"Kent Limner\\", after the locality where they had come to light. Stylistically distinct from those of the \\"Kent Limner\\", a second group of early-19th-century paintings emerged after 1940 in the area near the Connecticut‚ÄìNew York border. Attributed at the time to an unknown \\"Border Limner\\", these works, dating from the period 1812‚Äì1819, were characterized by soft pastel hues and limited drawing skills, as seen in the portraits of Mrs. Russell Dorr and Baby, now in the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Collection, Williamsburg, Virginia, and of Harriet Leavens, now in the Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University.Mills, Sally. \\"Phillips, Ammi.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Retrieved June 2, 2014. It was not until 1958 that Ammi Phillips' identity as the painter of both groups of portraits was established by Barbara and Larry Holdridge, and endorsed by Mary Black, writing on May 21, 1959, to three fellow folk-art historians, \\"You are the ones who should be the first to know that I have joined the opposition [i.e., the Holdridges] and now believe that the Border Limner, Ammi Phillips, A. Phillips, and the Kent Limner are one and the same person.\\" Additional works were identified, showing the artist's transition from the delicate coloration of the Border period to the bold and dramatic works that followed. Some paintings that had previously been attributed to John Bradley were also identified as the work of Ammi Phillips. By 1976, there were approximately 400 paintings securely attributed to Phillips, who is now recognized as one of the most prolific American folk painters of his time.Black 1976. Scores more have been discovered since then. The art historian Mary Black said Phillips' early and late styles reveal the untrained artist's inventiveness in dealing with the difficulty of representing the figure: \\"In his Border period he made his limitations work for him and the lumpy coats, gangling limbs, huge hands, wooden arms‚Äîeven the tables tilted at crazy angles‚Äîwere all part of well-composed and beautiful portraits. Later he glossed over problems with anatomy by using flat dark-colored backgrounds and dark dresses and suits\\". Phillips' work influenced the style of his younger contemporary, Erastus Salisbury Field, who worked as an itinerant portrait painter in the region just east of Phillips. The Museum of American Folk Art showed its first major exhibition devoted to the work of a single folk portraitist to \\"Ammi Phillips, Portrait Painter 1788‚Äì1865,\\" on exhibit from October 16 to December 2, 1968. Phillips work was displayed alongside the American modernist painter Mark Rothko in a 2008 exhibition \\"Seduction of Light\\" at the American Folk Art Museum, drawing attention to parallels of style and technique in the work of two American masters.

He is one of the key pioneers of developmental psychology. Kagan has shown that an infant's \\"temperament\\" is quite stable over time, in that certain behaviors in infancy are predictive of certain other behavior patterns in adolescence. He did extensive work on temperament and gave insight on emotion. Kagan was listed as the 22nd most eminent psychologist of the 20th century, just above Carl Jung. Haggbloom et al. combined 3 quantitative variables: citations in professional journals, citations in textbooks, and nominations in a survey given to members of the Association for Psychological Science, with 3 qualitative variables (converted to quantitative scores): National Academy of Science (NAS) membership, American Psychological Association (APA) President and/or recipient of the APA Distinguished Scientific Contributions Award, and surname used as an eponym. Then the list was rank ordered.  Biography  Born in Newark, New Jersey to Joseph and Myrtle Kagan, Kagan grew up in Rahway, New Jersey. He chose to study psychology due to his attraction in being a scientist and to preserve his grandfather's interest in human nature. He was accepted at Yale University to study Psychology, where he earned his Ph.D. and he earned his master's degree from Harvard University. He earned a B.S. Degree from Rutgers University in 1950. While at Yale University, he assisted Frank Beach, a well respected researcher. After he graduated from Yale University, he accepted his first faculty position at Ohio State University. Six months later, in 1955 he was recruited to be a part of the research team at the U.S. Army Hospital during the Korean War. Once he had finished his time at the U.S. Army Hospital, the director of the Fels Research Institute contacted Kagan to ask him to direct a project that was funded by the National Institutes of Health, which he accepted. After that project was completed, he accepted the offer he received from Harvard University to be involved in creating the first Human Development program. Once he moved to Harvard, he remained there until retirement, with the exception of a leave to go and study children in San Marcos. He did this for a year, from 1971 to 1972, and then returned to Harvard as a professor. Kagan won the Hofheimer Prize of the American Psychiatric Association in 1963. In 1995, he won the G. Stanley Hall Award of the American Psychological Association (APA). Research While at Fels, Kagan did extensive research on personality traits beginning with infancy and continued through adulthood. He looked at whether or not early experiences affected the participants' future personalities, talents and characters. Kagan read up on all of the longitudinal information that was prepared, specifically, the responses to intelligence tests that were administered to them. When Kagan was reviewing the material collected in childhood and adulthood, he found that the first three years in childhood showed little relation to the data collected in adulthood. The results of the Fels study was discussed in Kagan's book, Birth to Maturity, in 1962. Kagan's next research was in San Marcos, Guatemala. During this time, Kagan discovered that biological factors play a huge role in development and an even larger part in child development. Specifically, he found that these children had slower Psychological development when in their homes due to their restricted experiences. Once the children were walking and could leave the home, Kagan found that the psychological delay in development was only temporary, and that cognitive growth is malleable. In 2010, Kagan was involved in a similar study that focused on specific parts of the brain involved in behavioral inhibition in infants. Schwartz et al. (2010) performed a longitudinal study involving 18-year-olds and used neuroimaging to detect whether or not the ventromedial or orbitofrontal cerebral cortex are associated with the high/low reactivity of their 4-month-old selves. After undergoing a battery of tests, the infants were later categorized into two groups: low-reactive and high-reactive temperament. Results showed that the adults who had low-reactive infant temperaments had greater thickness in the left orbitofrontal cortex than the high-reactive group. The adults categorized as high-reactive infants displayed greater thickness in the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex. While at Harvard University, Kagan studied infants up to two years and published his work in his book, The Second Year. Kagan's research found that there were major changes in Psychological functioning between 19 and 24 months, and that one-year-old children were sensitive to events that deviated from their normal experiences. Kagan also looked at the effects of infant daycare in response to Congress' proposal to fund federal day care centers for working mothers. Richard Kearsley, Philip Zelazo and Kagan created their own daycare in Boston's Chinatown, and compared these infants to infants who stayed at home with their mothers. This research revealed very little difference between the infants in day care and those whose mothers stayed at home with them with respect to cognitive functioning, language, attachment, separation protest, and play tempo =Emotion= Kagan proposed that emotion is a psychological phenomenon controlled by brain states and that specific emotions are products of context, the person's history, and biological make-up. Kagan also explained emotion as occurring in four distinct phases, including the brain state (created by an incentive), the detection of changes in bodily movement, the appraisal of a change in bodily feeling, and the observable changes in facial expression and muscle tension. These emotions vary in magnitude and usually differ across ages and when expressed in different contexts. Kagan questioned relying on individual's verbal statements of their feelings. He provided several reasons for this; he argued that the English language does not have enough words to describe all emotional states, the words to explain emotional states do not convey the differences in quality or severity, and translating emotion words from one language to another produces variations and inaccuracies. In addition, Kagan argued that research in emotion studies should be free of ambiguous and coded terms, and this emphasis on specificity remains a recurring theme in his current research on emotion. He called for a moratorium on the use of single words (e.g. fear) to write about emotional process, urging experts to instead use full sentences. =Temperament= According to Kagan, (conventionally): Temperament is perhaps what Kagan is best known for. He began his work on temperament after his research in Guatemala. Kagan primarily focused on children's fear and apprehension. He defined two types of temperament; inhibited and uninhibited. Inhibited refers to a shy, timid, and fearful profile of a child, whereas uninhibited refers to the appearance of bold, sociable and outgoing behaviours. Kagan found that at four months, inhibited infants tend to fuss and show heightened responses to novel objects (e.g. brightly colored toy) and display intense physiological arousal to situations that barely attract uninhibited infants. In Kagan's first published work on behaviourally inhibited children, he established the connection between his work on behavioural inhibition to the works of neuroscientists like Joseph LeDoux and Michael Davis. In 2008, Kagan and several other researchers conducted a study to examine if behavioral inhibition in adulthood can be predicted by certain behavioral characteristics in infants. The research hypothesized that the frequency of infant reactivity based on motor and crying dimensions is predictive of behavioral inhibition. As a result of his ground breaking work on temperament, we know that these characteristics have the ability to influence later behavior depending on how they interact with the environment. Kagan also believed that there is no guarantee of an indefinitely stable profile considering environmental factors are always changing and that both genes and environmental factors influence a child's temperament Publications He is the author of: *Personality and the learning Process (1965) *Reflection- Impulsivity and Reading Ability in Primary Grade Children (1965) *Personal Development (1971) *The growth of the child.

Lebowakgomo lies 45 km southeast of the Limpopo capital of Polokwane. The majority of Lebowakgomo's inhabitants speak SePedi.  History  The township was established in the early 1970s to become the capital of Lebowa, and was enlarged and developed in the 1980s. The name is derived from two Northern Sotho words Lebowa (\\"north\\") and Kgomo (\\"cow\\"). The land where Lebowakgomo is located was donated to the former Lebowa Government by Chief Mmutle Mphahlele of the Bakgaga ba gaMphahlele. The chief's palace lies 10 km southeast of the township in Seleteng village. Lebowakgomo was one of the eight townships in the former Bantustan, the seven others being Mahwelereng, Se≈°ego, Mankweng, Lenyenye, Namakgale, Praktiseer, Ma≈°i≈°ing and Senwabarwana.

Neighbouring Communities The township of Lebowakgomo is surrounded by small to medium- sized villages that in each with their own characteristics contribute the vast majority of day dwellers in its business district. These villages include, Makotse, Ga-Ledwaba home of the Traditional Authority of Ga-Ledwaba, Ga- Rakgoatha, Ga-Mphahlele, Sepanapudi, Ga Masemola and Zebediela home to the Zebediela Citrus Farm which in its prime prior to land redistribution exported citrus to international and local markets and its oranges were famous among locals.

S.p.A. factory of excavators in 1919 in Rome, Italy. He imported and distributed construction equipment. During the time of Fascism, restrictions banned import and Ing. Fiorentini started his manufacturing plant in Via Tiburtina near Stazione Tiburtina (San Lorenzo, in Roma) for the construction of excavators such as scrapers/draglines and cranes under the license of an American company named Bucyrus. The first excavators (models FB35 and FB38) were entirely built on site from 1930 to 1940. Around the 1930s, Fiorentini also opened a factory in Fabriano. Fiorentini machines assisted all major Italian public works from 1930s . New models were scheduled to be produced but were delayed by World War II. During the war, in 1943, 117 workers died in the factory attacked by bombs dropped by the American military (Grassi, 2012). Eng. Filippo Fiorentini and his wife died shortly after of broken heart. Their only son, Giuseppe, also an Engineer, had the courage to start a new business activity, and in 1951 he was so successful that he was ranked at the top of Rome tax payers. The Ing.F.Fiorentini & C. S.P.A. relocated further along the Tiburtina road, to a bigger plant, more modern and very effective. After World War II, the company produced FB50, 60, 100 and the massive FB200 that could hold 1000 tons. In the 1960s, there were some design changes. The company also produced bulldozers and hydraulic excavators. By studying Russian, Ing. Giuseppe travelled to the Soviet Union and sold two big contracts with their ministry Machino Import, of some 1000 cranes to be used in the enormous project of the Transiberian Pipeline. At that time the Company had won a technical and commercial battle against other companies from Germany much bigger ones than the Ing. F.Fiorentini & C. of Rome. As the sales were strong, both inside Italy for the reconstruction, and in Russia, the Company hired as many as 1000 employees, who were working in three plants (Rome, Fabriano, in Italy) and Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In 1956 Count Giuseppe Fiorentini bought a second castle after the San Gallo castle in Nettuno, from prince Barberini, the farm estate and castle of San fabiano. A hunting resort, San Fabiano was useful for its public relations, where he invited many of his clients, such as the Russian Ambassador Rijov, and Mac Cormick of International Harvester. In fact the Company was designing and manufacturing cranes, excavators and crushing plants and represented for Italy the industrial line of H.I. But in the sixties, things started to decline economically. After a major setback in his industry in Rome, he took advantage of a national reform, that abruptly stopped the centennial rules of MEZZADRIA, where the Landlord was the owner of everything and the contadini the farmers were living in the farmhouses with the cows, and they were not paying a rent, but the output of their work would be split 50/50 with the Landlord. In 1975, engineer Giuseppe Fiorentini, the son of the company's founder, filed for bankruptcy and the company was obtained at no cost by another Italian company named Gepi. Gepi then changed its name to Nuova Fiorentini, meaning \\"New Fiorentini\\". References Grassi, L. (2012). Bunker di Roma, Guida ai Rifugi Anti-aerei. Sotterranei di Roma, Roma, IT.

Governance  PDK is governed by an International Board, who are elected by professional PDK members. The association abides by the Constitution and Bylaws of PDK International.  History  Phi Delta Kappa began at Indiana University on January 24, 1906 in the formal creation of a chapter under the name Pi Kappa Mu. By 1910, the organization had a total of three chapters. On March 1, 1910, Pi Kappa Mu, Phi Delta Kappa (which had been organized at Columbia University on March 13, 1908) and Nu Rho Beta (which had been organized at University of Missouri on February 23, 1909) amalgamated under the name Phi Delta Kappa. Prior to amalgamation, Phi Delta Kappa had also branched out to include two other chapters. Phi Delta Kappa was limited to white males at the August 1915 convention. In 1940, Sigma chapter at Ohio State University initiated two non- whites (one Chinese, one Negro), and was suspended at the December 1941 convention with charter revocation to occur in May 1942 if the chapter did not remove membership for the two non-whites. A demand for a popular vote of the entire membership let to a membership poll being sent to all members and eventually the deletion of the \\"white clause\\" by the membership. On June 2, 1942 announcement was made to all of the chapters of the removal of the race restriction. Phi Delta Kappa joined the Professional Interfraternity Conference in 1928.

Teleserye is derived from two Filipino words: \\"tele\\", which is short for \\"telebisy√≥n\\" (television) and \\"s√©rye\\" (series). Teleseryes share some characteristics and have similar roots with classic soap operas and telenovelas, yet the teleserye has evolved into a genre with its own unique characteristics, often working as a social realist reflection of Filipino reality. Teleseryes are aired in prime-time, afternoon, five days a week. They attract a broad audience crossing age and gender lines, and command the highest advertising rates in the Philippine television industry. The series last anywhere from three months to a year, or even longer, depending on their rating. Other forms of Philippine dramas include \\"serials\\" and \\"anthologies\\", which are usually shown on a weekly basis. These dramas are also intended to air a finite number of episodes usually lasting one season depending on the ratings. History =1950s-1980s= Soap operas in the Philippines originated when Gulong ng Palad (Wheel of Fortune) was first heard on the radio in 1949. The genre then expanded into television in the early 1960s. The first Philippine TV soap opera was Hiwaga sa Bahay na Bato (Mystery at the Stone House) in 1963, and was produced by ABS-CBN. Larawan ng Pag-ibig (Picture of Love), Prinsipe Amante (Prince Amante), and many others soon followed.60 Years of Philippine Soap Operas Gulong ng Palad, co-written by revival writer Loida Virina, was the longest-running radio serial that spanned for two decades until the mid 80s. It was made into a television soap opera starring Marianne Dela Riva and Ronald Corveau, created stars out of many young actors like Romnick Sarmenta and starred veteran actress Caridad Sanchez whose popularity helped sustain the soap's lifetime. During the martial law period from 1972 to 1986, the government closed several networks, including ABS-CBN, leaving RPN-9 and GMA as the only two commercial television networks in the country, but the lack of multi-network media base also aided the emergence of nationwide satellite broadcasting, spurring a dramatic growth of afternoon and primetime sitcoms and serials as a result of the fierce competition between the two networks. During this time, Philippine TV schedules resemble those in the U.S., with networks scheduling different shows per timeblock daily, in contrast with the country's modern weekday setup among its teleseryes, and separate weekend programming. RPN-9 produced Flordeluna, starring award-winning actress Janice de Belen. The cast also included \\"Drama King\\" Dindo Fernando and award-winning actress and director Laurice Guillen. At the same time, GMA produced the hit tale Anna Liza starring child actress and FAMAS awardee Julie Vega. Prior to the formal introduction of TV ratings system in the Philippines in the 1990s, both shows epitomized one of the biggest rivalries in Philippine showbiz history between Vega and de Belen (despite being highlighted as bestfriends offscreen). However, Anna Liza was cancelled in 1985 due to Julie Vega's death and as a result, the series had an unfinished storyline and a two-hour special in 1986, which was supposedly its final year on air. Both series were controversial from the start due to the rivalry between the fanbases of the two lead young actresses. =1990s= Until the late 1980s, Philippine television dramas were broadcast in afternoon timeblocks. ABS-CBN resumed operations after the expulsion of the Marcos dictatorship in 1986 and regained its lead among rival networks in audience ratings by the end of the decade. In the early and around the mid-1990s, local sitcoms dominated Philippine television, with the rise of ABS-CBN's Palibhasa Lalake and political satire Abangan Ang Susunod Na Kabanata, and GMA Network's Bubble Gang. The same decade, however, saw a new wave of international television phenomenon sweeping the Philippines, starting with the 'telenovela craze' over imported Mexican dramas. The most popular were the Las Tres Marias Trilogy produced by the world-leading Televisa and starred by Thal√≠a (starting with Marimar and later, Maria la del Barrio, shown on RPN, both on primetime slots, and Maria Mercedes on ABS-CBN). By this time, major networks began to reschedule locally made telenovelas into primetime slots to encourage more Filipino audiences to watch at night and for advertisers to invest more on these shows. By the mid-1990s, teleseryes surpassed sitcoms (both in number of shows produced and in nationwide audience ratings) as the most dominant form of primetime television in the Philippines. One of the country's most well- known TV shows is ABS-CBN's pioneering network-grown drama Mara Clara, which run from 1992 to 1997, gaining nationwide popularity due to the intense rivalry between its two stars and characters - Judy Ann Santos as the protagonist Mara and Gladys Reyes as the evil antagonist Clara. The series still stands as the longest-running teleserye in the post-Martial Law era of Philippine television, experiencing frequent timeslot changes before settling into the standard 7:00 P.M.-8:00 P.M. primetime block by late 1995 head-to- head with the ongoing re-airing of Marimar on RPN-9. Mara Clara is also credited for being the country's first successful teleserye to spawn a similarly successful movie under the same name. Santos' career would peak between 1997 and 1999 with her ABS-CBN series Esperanza, which also had a separate film made after its finale. A 1997 Esperanza episode currently holds the record for the all-time highest rated single episode for any Philippine television series. In mid-1997, another ABS-CBN series, Mula sa Puso, marked the rise of Claudine Barretto as one of the country's most prominent actresses, where she played the heiress Via in the 2-year-long soap, together with the late Rico Yan and Diether Ocampo as her leading men, and Princess Punzalan as Selina, the most influential character of the series. The show also marked a shift in the Philippine television market by the late 1990s, as Mula Sa Puso became known for being the country's first middle-class primetime series - a huge break from the preceding Filipino telenovelas with mass- appealing protagonists from the lower socio-economic classes. Punzalan's antagonist performance is highly regarded among the best on Philippine television and is still widely touted as the basis for all of the succeeding teleserye villains, and the rivalry between her character and Jacklyn Jose's (as Via's mother Magda) became a standard for confrontation scenes of TV series in the succeeding decades on Philippine television. Simultaneously running with Esperanza, both programs pioneered crossover episodes among Philippine teleserye during the same period, and Mula sa Puso spawned another successful movie after its finale in 1999. Both shows also helped ABS-CBN dominate as the country's leading television network by the late 1990s for more than 10 straight years running, ranking competitively as Philippines' 2 most watched overall TV series in every year on air. Meanwhile, rival network's GMA retained and even popularized their afternoon serialized dramas form such as Villa Quintana with lead stars Donna Cruz as Lynette Quintana and Keempee de Leon as Isagani Samonte with Isabel Rivas as Stella Quintana which airs from 1995 to 1997. This was followed by Ikaw Na Sana with lead characters Angelu de Leon as Blanca Rosales Perez / Susan Saavedra and Bobby Andrews as Rafael Huico with Gladys Reyes as Angela Rosales which airs between 1997 and 1998, and a film was made after this show. At the peak of both these GMA afternoon shows' fame, they were moved to primetime slots by the end of the 1990s to compete with ABS-CBN's rise on national television with their primetime serials, a foreshadow of what would eventually be the touted primetime television series blocks for both rival networks. =2000s= Modern Philippine television dramas have begun to evolve to today's modern form called teleserye, a portmanteau of the Filipino words \\"telebisyon\\" (\\"television\\") and \\"serye\\" (\\"series\\"). The term originated from the ABS-CBN hit drama Pangako Sa 'Yo, airing from 2000 to 2002 and starring Jericho Rosales and Kristine Hermosa, and the iconic rivalry between actresses Eula Valdez as the original Amor de Jesus-Powers and Jean Garcia as the original Claudia Buenavista. The tandem of Valdez and Garcia in the original Pangako Sa'Yo is widely regarded as the most successful rivalry of main characters in all of Philippine television, setting the standards for future teleserye ensemble casts. Pangako Sa'Yo is dubbed as the country's first ever teleserye and was considered one of the most significant turning points in Philippine television history due to its pioneering cinematic production and modified fast-paced, multiple-arc story structure distinguishing it from previous Filipino telenovelas. It was broadcast internationally in many networks across the Americas, Africa and Asia, and remains the most successful Philippine television series internationally. At the end of its run in 2002, Pangako Sa 'Yo remains as the record-holder of the all-time highest rated series finale episode for any locally made program in Philippine television history, and firmly established the current primetime block of ABS-CBN. Pangako Sa 'Yo effectively became the highest rated teleserye by average, both domestically and internationally, in all of Philippine television history, and inspired ABS-CBN to produce (in mid-2002) its leadout teleserye, Kay Tagal Kang Hinintay. Already concluded in 2003, the show introduced the highly acclaimed tandem of John Lloyd Cruz and Bea Alonzo as one of the country's most successful long-established television and film loveteams until today. Also known for the iconic performance of Lorna Tolentino as the protagonist twins Lorrea and Lorrinda Guinto, it became the nation's first ever local television series to become a finalist to the Best Drama Series category of the International Emmy Awards in 2003, marking the rise of the Philippines on the world television programming stage. Rosales and Hermosa, along with Diether Ocampo and Angelika dela Cruz, would altogether star in another teleserye classic, Sana'y Wala Nang Wakas. Airing between 2003 and 2004, Sana'y Wala Nang Wakas became the world's first ever drama series allowing its viewers to choose the story's ending through text messaging. Another groundbreaking teleserye of ABS-CBN was Basta't Kasama Kita, airing around the same period as of Sana'y Wala Nang Wakas. Starring Judy Ann Santos and Robin Padilla, the show was notable for its depiction of the country's National Bureau of Investigation and for being the country's first ever local television series to broadcast a live series finale episode in 2004. This introduced the live format of series finales among fictional series on Philippine television - a feat only few teleseryes had accomplished until today. Both series followed Pangako Sa'Yo to be broadcast abroad, marking the rise of Philippines to international prominence in television drama production. ABS-CBN's fortunes would soon increase with its 1999‚Äì2001 series Saan Ka Man Naroroon starring Claudine Barretto on lead role as triplets Rosemarie, Rosenda and Rosario. The show was critically acclaimed and became one of the few groundbreaking shows of the 2000s in the Philippines starring a female lead character, as well as the country's first teleserye with at least two characters portrayed simultaneously by one actor. Barretto would consequently gain prominence for her lead role on Sa Dulo Ng Walang Hanggan a timeless love story of the undying love of Angeline Crisostomo/Angelina whose mistakes that appear in the present had also happened in the past; it uncovered the lies and the love of all around her which was actually reincarnated into the present. She was also the lead star of the popular teleserye Marina. Airing in 2004, the show popularized the fantasy theme throughout most of the incoming teleseryes in the Philippines, becoming the first original fantasy series made for television to score success on Philippine primetime television ratings. The Philippines began emerging as one of the world's largest television drama- producing nations in the mid-2000s. Several of its international hits include the 2006 remake of Gulong ng Palad on ABS-CBN, with its cast including Kristine Hermosa as Luisa, TJ Trinidad as Carding and Cherie Gil as Philiomena \\"Menang\\" Medel, the corrupt town mayor and also the main antagonist of the series. The role of Mimi was given to Andrea del Rosario and Rio Locsin as Caridad \\"Idad\\" Santos. The series was popular amongst international viewers, through TFC. In 2007, the remake of Maria Flordeluna, which previously aired on RPN-9 through most of the 1970s and 1980s, starred young actress Eliza Pineda as the titular character. It also starred Albert Martinez as Leo Alicante, Eula Valdez as Mary Jo Esperitu and John Estrada as Gary Alvarado. The series ran on ABS-CBN for 93 episodes and won the PMPC Star Awards Best Television Series in 2008, and popularized the trend of remaking classic child-starred Philippine telenovelas of the past. To pit against its rival network, GMA Network started producing their own set of primetime soap opera starting with the top-rating drama series, Ikaw Lang Ang Mamahalin starring drama actress Angelika dela Cruz which aired from 2001 to 2002 and Sana Ay Ikaw Na Nga starring Dingdong Dantes. It was successfully shown in Malaysia and other Asian countries. Another was the political drama, Kung Mawawala Ka also became one of the most loved powerful dramas which revolved on politics and even on issues of corruption. Starring Eddie Garcia as the show's main character (and lead antagonist), it also showed the dramatic abilities of actresses Hilda Koronel, Liza Lorena and Gloria Diaz as the powerful wives. The series ran between 2001 and 2002 and also won a PMPC Award from the Philippine Movie Press Club. It was also the most popular GMA-made drama (as well as the most successful single telenovela) pitted against the ongoing television drama Pangako Sa 'Yo which also reached its end in 2002. It was not until 2004, however, when GMA Network overtook ABS-CBN in the national ratings when the former introduced an all-fantaserye (a portmanteau of \\"fantasy\\" and teleserye, i.e. fantasy-themed teleseryes) primetime slate by 2005, through the successful broadcasts of female-lead shows such as Encantadia, which originally starred Iza Calzado, Karylle, Sunshine Dizon and Diana Zubiri, and Mulawin, starring the successful tandem of Angel Locsin and Richard Gutierrez. GMA earned ratings foothold against its main rival ABS-CBN during this time when it brought life to Darna, a role reprised by the most famous Darna of all time, Vilma Santos (in the late 1970s and early 1980s), and starring Angel Locsin in its first television remake, and ushered the era of film-turned-TV remakes on Philippine television. Prominent film-turned-TV remakes in the Philippines in the 2000s include Panday which starred Jericho Rosales and Heart Evangelista, and the remake of Mga Anghel na Walang Langit and Kampanerang Kuba which starred Anne Curtis, all made by ABS-CBN. The \\"sineserye\\" genre was introduced on Philippine television in this decade through Bituing Walang Ningning which starred Sarah Geronimo and Angelika de la Cruz, reprising the iconic roles of Sharon Cuneta and Cherie Gil won prominence and also produced a concert. It also came to be known as having \\"The Grand Finale\\" as this introduced the format of series finale stretched to 5 days on the final week on Philippine television. Bituing Walang Ningning remains the all-time highest rated regular musical television drama series in the Philippines. By the late 2000s, GMA-7 and ABS-CBN would soon embark on one of the country's most heated rivalries for the most watched television network. GMA aired its 2007 remake of the international telenovela MariMar which starred Marian Rivera and Dingdong Dantes (then remade in 2015 for a second time with the same title starring Megan Young and Tom Rodriguez). The remake, highlighted as one of the world's most successful international remakes of any former Latinovela, boosted GMA's short-term dominance as the most watched television network in the country during the year. Meanwhile, during the second half of the 2000s, three ABS-CBN-made TV series became popular: the remake of the 1977‚Äì1985 soap opera Gulong ng Palad, the teleserye Sa Piling Mo and the series Maging Sino Ka Man. The latter became the most popular teleserye internationally after Pangako Sa'Yo and boosted the careers of John Lloyd Cruz, Bea Alonzo, Sam Milby and Anne Curtis. On the year 2008, ABS-CBN produced its most expensive series Lobo, about two opposing groups in the story‚Äîthe Luna and the Waya. The show starred Piolo Pascual and Angel Locsin, in the latter's first major project on ABS-CBN after transferring from GMA Network in one of Philippine television's most controversial network switches by any actor to date. Locsin's performance was the first from any Filipino to be nominated to the International Emmys for a leading role. The members of the Luna organization have a grudge against the werewolves while the Waya are the protectors of the Lobo (the werewolves), and they want them to co-exist harmoniously with normal humans. The year 2008 also marked the international success of the Philippine remake of the world-hit Colombian original telenovela Yo soy Betty, la fea. Starring Bea Alonzo, it became the most successful Philippine remake of any Latinovela since the 2007 Marimar remake starring Marian Rivera on GMA Network. Alonzo's portrayal gained widespread prominence through most of Asia on her titular character, and was vital in ABS-CBN's defeat of GMA as the country's most watched television network at the end of the decade. =2010s= By the 2010s, ABS-CBN and GMA Network would rival in their claims as the most watched network in the Philippines. While GMA Network appeals to most of the viewers in Mega Manila (through their shows that are said to be Manila-centric in setting) beginning the mid-2000s, most primetime shows from ABS-CBN appeal widely to other regions in the country, particularly in the sought-after audiences of Visayas and Mindanao. Local media experts attribute this trend to ABS-CBN's return to original Filipino programming. ABS-CBN's ratings success since the late 2000s was initiated by the success of the 2009 teleserye May Bukas Pa. Starring Zaijian Jaranilla as the iconic Santino, the show became the first successful religious-themed series on Philippine television, as well as the most successful child-starred Philippine television series since the 1985 demise of the original Anna Liza of Julie Vega on GMA Network. May Bukas Pa also became the first Philippine primetime television series to have lasted at least one full year (since Sa Dulo ng Walang Hanggan in 2001-2003), ending in 2010 as the country's all-time most watched TV show since Philippine television switched to nationwide TV ratings system. 2010 featured some of Philippine television's strongest original teleseryes such as Dahil May Isang Ikaw, which became the comeback project of the tandem of Kristine Hermosa and Jericho Rosales, and revitalized the careers of veteran actors such as Lorna Tolentino, John Estrada, Chin Chin Gutierrez and Gabby Concepcion. The show, which aired on ABS-CBN, was the first primetime project of GMA Network transferees Karylle and Sid Lucero, the latter of whom remains the only Filipino male to be nominated at the International Emmy Awards for a leading role in any TV series. This was followed up by the fantaserye Agua Bendita, which was the first primetime show with titular characters starred by Xyriel Manabat and Andi Eigenmann in its earlier and latter stages, marking the trend for child-starred original Filipino programming. Manabat would soon star in ABS-CBN's critical hit 100 Days to Heaven, which also marked the primetime return of actresses Coney Reyes and Jodi Sta. Maria. Beginning 2011, however, the mass transfer of some actors and actresses between ABS-CBN and GMA became a common trend on Philippine television. Moreover, both networks' hold on primetime television programming in the country would soon be challenged by TV5 with its debut teleserye offering in Babaeng Hampaslupa, which starred with Alex Gonzaga, Alice Dixson and Susan Roces. To date, its most recent offering was the 2016 series Bakit Manipis ang Ulap? (produced by Viva Entertainment, based on the 1985 film of the same title created by Danny Zialcita) with Diether Ocampo, Claudine Barretto, Cesar Montano and Meg Imperial. 2010s also marked the start of broadcast of teleseryes induced with storylines known to have reflected some of the controversial issues facing the Philippines nowadays. For instance, Julia Montes and newcomer Coco Martin starred in the 2012 ABS-CBN hit Walang Hanggan. Known for tackling issues on adultery and infidelity among Filipino households, the romantic drama featured the primetime return of veteran actors Richard Gomez and Dawn Zulueta, and also gained wide popularity in most of Southeast Asia during its run, becoming the first Philippine television series to win in its ratings timeslot in all of its episodes. The show is also the country's second all-time highest-rated TV show since its final episode in 2012, and marked Martin's successful transition from the Filipino indie scene to become the foremost actor of the current era of Philippine television. Another popular ABS-CBN teleserye was the 2012‚Äì2013 series Ina, Kapatid, Anak. Known for the heated on-and-offscreen rivalry of both actresses Kim Chiu and Maja Salvador during its run, as well as the primetime comeback of veteran actresses Cherry Pie Picache and Janice de Belen, the show gained national prominence for its open discussion of mother surrogacy - a topic previously but highly prohibited on Philippine media - and using the University of the Philippines (the country's national university) as its main setting. Salvador would later team up with Angel Locsin in the highly acclaimed 2014 series The Legal Wife in the same network. The show, which also talked about infidelity and adultery, marked the Jericho Rosales's first work with Salvador and Locsin, and the first ABS-CBN primetime show by GMA Network transferee JC de Vera, was known for its controversial open-ended series finale among Locsin, Salvador and Rosales' characters, and for ranking to date as the country's most watched TV show nationwide for a late primetime slot. The family-oriented ABS-CBN daytime romantic drama Be Careful With My Heart (aired by ABS-CBN) introduced the highly successful tandem of Jodi Sta. Maria and Richard Yap, and became the first teleserye to exceed 2 years in its overall run (from July 9, 2012 until November 28, 2014 with a total of 622 episodes). The show has since become the most successful Philippine television series on daytime block in and out of the Philippines. 2013 also marked the television comeback of Judy Ann Santos through the ABS- CBN revenge thriller drama Huwag Ka Lang Mawawala, which also starred Sam Milby and KC Concepcion (in both of their debut antagonist roles). The short- lived series, however, was notable for its depiction of women's empowerment in the Philippine context, as well as infidelity, and would peak in the ratings after it was transferred to the late primetime slot, eventually emerging as the country's second highest-rated TV show of all time in that timeblock. The show marked one of the very few times a Filipino TV program was transferred to a much latter airing time and attract more viewers leading up to any series finale. GMA Network, however, scored a major milestone, with actress & Philippine Queen of Cinema Gloria Romero debut her network series Munting Heredera after leaving ABS-CBN. The series become the highest raiting views with the final episode scored a 27.7% rating. The series also launched a breakthrough debut careers of young stars Barbara Miguel, Kyle Ocampo & Mona Louise Rey. Rey will later join the series Luna Blanca with another child actress Jillian Ward, leads the series first multi-generation series where they join with teen actress Bea Binene & Barbie Forteza and actress Bianca King & Heart Evangelista. GMA also launched the country's most expensive and first historical drama series Amaya, starting Marian Rivera as a title role with Sid Lucero, who transfer to the network after leaving ABS-CBN and newcomer Mikael Daez. It becomes the most highest ratings of all time including the finale episode. It was also Rivera's breakthrough role since Marimar. Also that year, Rivera gained another fame through the Philippine adaptation of a popular Korean series, Temptation Of Wife alongside with Dennis Trillo, Glaiza de Castro & formerly ABS-CBN star Rafael Rosell. It becomes the most watching ratings of the series, with the Castro character Heidi, was universal acclaim praised by critics for her antagonist role and her character rival with Rivera's character. Trillo later appears on the first ever television network to air a gay-themed primetime series. In 2013, the short-lived but popular teleserye My Husband's Lover, starring newcomer Tom Rodriguez and Carla Abellana, emerged as a hot topic of national conversation due to their portrayal in the show, which discussed about homosexuality - a widespread but controversial topic given the country's longstanding Catholic values and teachings. It has also gained prominence for being a widely viewed show despite being pitted against the simultaneously running Ina, Kapatid, Anak that has also since become a hit in and out of the Philippines. GMA Network would soon gain its ratings momentum with its 2016-2017 remake of its iconic fantaserye (portmanteau for \\"fantasy-themed\\" teleserye) Encantadia, marking the continuity of the trend for revivals of 2000s teleseryes on Philippine television initially popularized by ABS-CBN. In 2009, the series remake of AnnaLiza was shelved which was to star Maja Salvador and Jason Abalos, but finally revived again in 2013 (with child star Andrea Brillantes in the title role). Together with the earlier success of the 2007 remake of Maria Flordeluna and the 2010 remake of Mara Clara, which introduced mainstream actresses Julia Montes and Kathryn Bernardo, ABS-CBN popularized the concept of revival of previously massive hit teenager-starred telenovelas of the previous decades on Philippine television. The 2010 remake of Mara Clara is regarded as the single most successful remake of any previous Filipino telenovela dating from the 20th century. This would be followed up by the 2015 remake of Pangako Sa'Yo (still under ABS-CBN), starring the trio of Jodi Sta. Maria, Angelica Panganiban and Ian Veneracion as the new-generation characters Amor de Jesus-Powers, Claudia Buenavista and Eduardo Buenavista, respectively. Also known as the first major drama project of the widely popular tandem of Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla as the leads Yna Macaspac and Angelo Buenavista, respectively, the show, which ended in 2016, garnered mixed reviews but wide commercial success, making it the most successful remake of any 2000s Philippine teleserye to date. However, Sta. Maria, who portrayed the role of Lia Buenavista in the original Pangako Sa'Yo (and of which was portrayed by Brillantes in the remake), garnered rave reviews for her new-generation portrayal of Amor de Jesus-Powers (previously acted by Eula Valdez), and remains the most recent Asian actress to be nominated at the International Emmy Awards for a leading role as of . More teleseryes earned renewed international popularity by 2016, courtesy of Bridges of Love (that ran from March 16 to August 7, 2015 on ABS-CBN), starring Rosales, Salvador and Paulo Avelino, under the title Puentes de Amor, the first Philippine drama aired in Latin America, which began on April 25, 2016 on Panamericana Televisi√≥n in Peru. The same year, Martin starred in the currently running 2015 series Ang Probinsyano, gaining national attention for its bold portrayal of the country's ongoing anti-illegal drugs campaign and the Philippine National Police despite renewed nationwide television censors by the MTRCB. ABS-CBN's recent announcement of the show's run extension until 2020 made Ang Probinsyano the longest-running overall teleserye to ever debut in the 21st century on Philippine television, which the show is slated to overtake the 1992-1997 original run of Mara Clara as the country's longest- running TV series since the People Power Revolution in 1986. The show is also the all-time most dominant show on Philippine television based on TV ratings, as it has occupied the top spot non-stop every year since its inception in 2015. Salvador would soon star in the hit 2017‚Äì2018 series Wildflower as the main characters Lily Cruz/Ivy Aguas. The show was notable for revitalizing the careers of veteran actors Tirso Cruz III, Aiko Melendez, Sunshine Cruz, Christian Vasquez and Wendell Ramos, for the primetime debuts of television newcomers Joseph Marco, Vin Abrenica, RK Bagatsing, Yen Santos and Roxanne Barcelo, and for being the first Philippine teleserye to portray controversial political topics such as nepotism and human rights abuses, as well as mental disorders like schizophrenia and paranoid on primetime. The show became one of Philippine television's most frequent social media-trending shows online, and became the highest-rated Filipino show for an early primetime television slot to date in the 21st century, becoming the first show to do so since the 1999 series finale of the original version of Mula Sa Puso. Despite its finale in 2018, Wildflower is still shown to over 40 countries across Africa and Asia to date, reaching an audience of nearly 300 million viewers in all. 2010s also marked the renewed popularity of long-term afternoon dramas on Philippine television after a temporary decline in the late 1990s. From 2014 to 2016, GMA broadcast The Half Sisters which starred teen actresses Barbie Forteza and Thea Tolentino. Also noted for the performances of veteran actors Jomari Yllana and Jean Garcia, the show became the network's most successful teleserye in and out of the Philippines since the 2013 final episode of My Husband's Lover. GMA would soon dominate the late afternoon timeslots between 2016 and 2018 with its adult, infidelity-themed teleserye Ika-6 na Utos, which marks the television comeback of Sunshine Dizon and Gabby Concepcion, and starred both Ryza Cenon and Angelika dela Cruz as sisters and antagonists of the show. To pit against GMA on daytime, Julia Montes topbilled the ABS-CBN hit afternoon teleserye Doble Kara, which ran between 2015 and 2017. The show was moved in early 2016 to the 3:20 PM time slot after its noontime show It's Showtime extended their time occupation then it competed the remake of Sinungaling Mong Puso in its rival GMA Network. Due to its continuous high ratings, it was extended and became the network's first teleserye to air for more than a year since the 2014 final episode of Be Careful With My Heart. Its leadout teleserye Tubig at Langis, airing in 2016, earned nationwide popularity because of the intense rivalry of lead actresses Cristine Reyes and Isabelle Daza as Irene and Clara, respectively. The network would soon overtake GMA in the afternoon timeslots with the rise of its 2018 series Kadenang Ginto. The show features the rivaling tandems of Dimples Romana and Beauty Gonzalez, and the up-and-coming teen duo Andrea Brillantes and Francine Diaz, and is the country's first TV drama with an all-female prime lead cast group. The show also marked the television comebacks of leading men Albert Martinez, Luis Alandy and Richard Yap. During the same decade, the live format for teleserye final episodes returned on Philippine television for the first time since the finale of GMA's 2007 Philippine remake of Marimar. ABS-CBN earned national attention in 2016 alone for concluding the runs of short-lived but otherwise popular teen-oriented primetime shows On the Wings of Love and Born for You. On the Wings of Love was the first primetime show starring newcomer tandem James Reid and Nadine Lustre, while Born for You became the first musical-themed teleserye on Philippine television since the end of ABS- CBN's 2006 television adaptation of Bituing Walang Ningning, and marked the primetime debut of Janella Salvador (after starring in Be Careful With My Heart) and network newcomer Elmo Magalona. The 2008 hit series Lobo produced 2 more sequels Imortal in 2010 and La Luna Sangre in 2017, with all three shows airing on ABS-CBN and starred by Angel Locsin. While Imortal previously starred John Lloyd Cruz, La Luna Sangre was the first primetime project of Daniel Padilla and Kathryn Bernardo since the 2016 series finale of the Pangako Sa'Yo remake, as well as the first major project on ABS-CBN by Richard Gutierrez after his tenure on GMA Network and TV5. It was also the first project of Locsin and Gutierrez as a tandem since their popularity on Mulawin on GMA in the mid-2000s. Also, 2018's Halik, also by ABS-CBN, marked the television comeback of Jericho Rosales and featured the rise to prominence of actresses Yen Santos and Yam Concepcion, with the show continuing the trend of controversial dramas on adultery and infidelity of married couples on primetime. The show was soon replaced in 2019 in the timeslot by The Killer Bride. The ongoing gothic romance-thriller show, which marked the first ever collaboration of real-life relatives Maja Salvador and Janella Salvador, is widely praised for its script having perceived commentaries on the country's contemporary issues in the current Duterte administration. Cenon would soon transfer to ABS-CBN to team up with Martinez in the 2019 military-themed TV drama The General's Daughter, which starred Angel Locsin as the show's titular character. The show also marked the television comebacks of Eula Valdez, Janice de Belen, Tirso Cruz III, Paulo Avelino and JC de Vera, and by mid-2019, firmly established the first ever all-adult-themed Philippine primetime television lineup (with Martin's police-themed Ang Probinsyano, The General's Daughter and Salvador's The Killer Bride), marking a huge shift from the once predominantly family-drama-driven primetime television network schedules in the country. =2020s= The year 2020 was defined by temporary suspension of teleserye productions due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, affecting long-running teleseryes such as Ang Probinsyano, which became the longest-running teleserye to span at least 2 separate decades in the 21st-century Philippine television. In terms of content, Philippine networks have also subscribed to the production of BL series due to the popularity of the Thai series 2Gether: The Series.https://www.filmgeekguy.com/2020/07/list-of-filipino-bl-series-boys- love.html Impact of teleseryes The range of popularity of Philippine drama since the early 2000s had spun overseas, becoming popular throughout Asia and Africa, and has appealed widely to overseas Filipino communities in North America as well. Teleseryes have since evolved distinctly from most of the world's telenovelas throughout decades and highlight the country's position among the world's most successful television drama producers. Several of the Philippine teleseryes had emerged as among the most watched television programs in even difficult and huge non-Anglophonic markets such as Indonesia, Malaysia and China. Considered one of the country's most vital economic and cultural exports, they are often dubbed into local languages, and sometimes has English and other foreign subtitles displayed when imported into those markets. ABS-CBN and GMA are among the pioneering television producers in Asia to have exported their classical dramas, several of which reflect the reality of Filipino (and other similar Asian) societies, and have a universal message. Pangako Sa 'Yo is Philippines' all-time most successful TV series globally. Prior to topping the national television ratings in China in the mid-2000s, the story gained wide popularity to more than 1 billion viewers alone in Southeast Asia and Africa. ABS-CBN also introduced a website called ABS-CBN International Sales, for easy access to their shows. Other ABS-CBN shows like Sana Maulit Muli (Taiwan), Lobo (dubbed as She-Wolf: The Last Sentinel), Tayong Dalawa, Dahil May Isang Ikaw, Kahit Isang Saglit, Katorse, the 2010 version of Mara Clara (remake), Magkaribal, Be Careful With My Heart (Vietnam) and Walang Hanggan were also exported. These were followed by simultaneous broadcasts of shows such as Ina, Kapatid, Anak, May Bukas Pa, Forevermore, Till I Met You, Wildflower and the currently airing television adaptation of Ang Probinsyano at around the same time in the Philippines and overseas by the mid-2010s as a result of their popularity in and out of the country. GMA Network still holds the record for the highest-rated pilot episodes with both Darna and Encantadia in 2005, and firmly established fantaserye as one of the most viable genres on Philippine primetime television. The network followed suit through the trend of Asianovelas this century with Boys Next Door, a teen melodrama, which was the first Philippine television series aired in South Korea (which is considered one of the top rival exporters of television series in Asia). The 2007 Philippine adaptation of MariMar became GMA's all-time most successful television series in and out of the Philippines, and was aired to wide popularity in Thailand, Malaysia, China, Singapore, Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya and Hawaii. Other GMA shows such as Habang Kapiling Ka, Kahit Kailan, Bakekang, Muli, Impostora, Mga Mata ni Anghelita, Dyesebel and Encantadia are still broadcast in some countries in Asia and Africa. In recent years, Philippine television drama has gained international recognition from international award-giving bodies, cementing the reputation of the Philippines among the world's most prolific television drama producers. Most of these nominated dramas were from ABS-CBN. It started with Lobo, winning the Best Telenovela category in the 30th BANFF World Television Festival. Several dramas were also nominated in the International Emmy for the telenovela category, including ABS-CBN's Kay Tagal Kang Hinintay, Dahil May Isang Ikaw, Kahit Isang Saglit, Bridges of Love and GMA's Magdusa Ka and My Husband's Lover. Be Careful With My Heart of ABS-CBN was recently nominated in the 2013 New York Festivals TV and Film Awards. Angel Locsin, Sid Lucero and Jodi Sta. Maria are, to date, the only Filipinos to be nominated at the International Emmys for Best Actor and Best Actress in a Drama Series for their respective leading TV program roles in the 2009 series Lobo, 2010 series Dahil May Isang Ikaw and the 2015-2016 remake of Pangako Sa 'Yo. The long- running action drama series Ang Probinsyano has had a wide-ranging effect on Philippine pop culture and society. Touted as the Pambansang Teleserye, the show has won and has been nominated for various awards given by award giving bodies in the Philippines and has also been given citations by various government agencies such as the Philippine National Police and its attached agency, the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group and the House of Representatives. The show is widely regarded for tackling timely issues, which has conversely landed it in hot water for its alleged negative portrayal of the government and its agencies. However, netizens, artists, politicians and others immediately came to the defense of the show citing that it is fictional and that the government should instead be cleaning its ranks. The show has also been considered a local kingmaker with its endorsement value being among the highest in the 2019 midterm elections. In relation to this, the show has also become a sought after platform for actors who want to run for public office to raise their profile and visibility among voters. A party-list bearing the show's name, which was endorsed by the series' leads Coco Martin and Yassi Pressman, finished fifth in the same election and secured for itself a seat at the House of Representatives. The show's lead character Cardo Dalisay has also been lauded for being \\"steadfast and incorruptible\\" and has become the object of jokes and memes for his supposed \\"immortality\\" and the show's longevity on the air. Ang Probinsyano is also a consistent ratings draw, and has been credited with reviving the long suffering action genre in both film and television. The show has also been picked up by Netflix which streams the show under its international title Brothers.

This is one of three banks used to load the generator to verify performance on load changes and for factory run-in. A load bank is a piece of electrical test equipment used to simulate an electrical load, to test an electric power source without connecting it to its normal operating load. During testing, adjustment, calibration, or verification procedures, a load bank is connected to the output of a power source, such as an electric generator, battery, servoamplifier or photovoltaic system, in place of its usual load. The load bank presents the source with electrical characteristics similar to its standard operating load, while dissipating the power output that would normally be consumed by it. The power is usually converted to heat by a heavy duty resistor or bank of resistive heating elements in the device, and the heat removed by a forced air or water cooling system. The device usually also includes instruments for metering, load control, and overload protection. Load banks can either be permanently installed at a facility to be connected to a power source when needed, or portable versions can be used for testing power sources such as standby generators and batteries. They are necessary adjuncts to replicate, prove, and verify the real-life demands on critical power systems. They are also used during operation of intermittent renewable power sources such as windmills to shed excess power that the electric power grid cannot absorb. Applications Load banks are used in a variety of applications, including: *Factory testing of turbines and engine diesel generator sets *Reduction of wet stacking problems in diesel engines run at light load *Periodic exercising of stand-by engine generator sets *Battery and UPS system testing *Ground power testing *Load optimization in prime power applications *Removal of carbon build-up on generator piston rings *Load rejection tests *Data center tests (electricity and air-conditioning) Load bank types The three most common types of load banks are resistive, inductive, and capacitive. Both inductive and capacitive loads create what is known as reactance in an AC circuit. Reactance is a circuit element's opposition to an alternating current, caused by the buildup of electric or magnetic fields in the element due to the current and is the \\"imaginary\\" component of impedance, or the resistance to AC signals at a certain frequency. Capacitive reactance is equal to 1/(2‚ãÖœÄ‚ãÖf‚ãÖC), and inductive reactance is equal to 2‚ãÖœÄ‚ãÖf‚ãÖL. The unit of reactance is the ohm. Inductive reactance resists the change to current, causing the circuit current to lag voltage. Capacitive reactance resists the change to voltage, causing the circuit current to lead voltage. 2 x ASCO 6MVA resistive/reactive containerised load banks testing diesel gen-sets on board a shipping vessel. =Resistive load bank= A resistive load bank, the most common type, provides equivalent loading for both generators and prime movers. That is, for each kilowatt (or horsepower) of load applied to the generator by the load bank, an equal amount of load is applied to the prime mover by the generator. A resistive load bank, therefore, removes energy from the complete system: load bank from generator‚Äîgenerator from prime mover‚Äîprime mover from fuel. Additional energy is removed as a consequence of resistive load bank operation: waste heat from coolant, exhaust and generator losses and energy consumed by accessory devices. A resistive load bank impacts upon all aspects of a generating system. The load of a resistive load bank is created by the conversion of electrical energy to heat via high-power resistors such as grid resistors. This heat must be dissipated from the load bank, either by air or by water, by forced means or convection. In a testing system, a resistive load simulates real-life resistive loads, such as incandescent lighting and heating loads as well as the resistive or unity power factor component of magnetic (motors, transformers) loads. The most common type uses wire resistance, usually with fan cooling, and this type is often portable and moved from generator to generator for test purposes. Sometimes a load of this type is built into a building, but this is unusual. Rarely a salt water rheostat is used. It can be readily improvised, which makes it useful in remote locations. For testing automotive batteries, a carbon pile load bank allows an adjustable load to be placed on the battery or charging system, allowing accurate simulation of the heavy load on the battery during cranking of the engine. Such devices are usually portable and may include metering to show voltage and current. Ken Pickerill, Today's Technician: Automotive Engine Performance Classroom Manual and Shop Manual ,Nelson Education, 2009, , page 51 =Inductive load bank= An inductive load includes inductive (lagging power factor) loads. An inductive load consists of an iron-core reactive element which, when used in conjunction with a resistive load bank, creates a lagging power factor load. Typically, the inductive load will be rated at a numeric value 75% that of the corresponding resistive load such that when applied together a resultant 0.8 power factor load is provided. That is to say, for each 100 kW of resistive load, 75 kVAr of inductive load is provided. Other ratios are possible to obtain other power factor ratings. An inductive load is used to simulate a real-life mixed commercial loads consisting of lighting, heating, motors, transformers, etc. With a resistive-inductive load bank, full power system testing is possible, because the provided impedance supplies currents out of phase with voltage and allows for performance evaluation of generators, voltage regulators, load tap changers, conductors, switchgear and other equipment. Capacitor bank. =Capacitive load bank= A capacitive load bank or capacitor bank is similar to an inductive load bank in rating and purpose, except leading power factor loads are created, so reactive power is supplied from these loads to the system, hence improves the power factor. These loads simulate certain electronic or non-linear loads typical of telecommunications, computer or UPS industries. = Resistive Reactive (Combined) load bank = A combined load bank usually consists of both resistive elements and inductors that can be used to provide load testing at non-unity PF (lagging) including the capability to test the generator set fully at 100% nameplate kVA rating. Combined load banks incorporate resistors and inductors all in a single construction which can be independently switched to allow resistive only, inductive only, or varying lagging power factor testing. Combined load banks are rated in kilovolt-amperes (kVA). It‚Äôs worth noting that combined load banks can consist of resistive, inductive, and capacitive (RLC) also. Typically, facilities require motor-driven devices, transformers and capacitors. If this is the case, then the load banks used for testing require reactive power compensation. The ideal solution is a combination of both resistive and reactive elements in one load bank package. Resistive/reactive loads are able to mimic motor loads and electromagnetic devices within a power system, as well as provide purely resistive loads. Many backup generators and turbines need to be commissioned at nameplate capacity using a combination of resistive and reactive load to fully qualify their operating capability. Using a resistive/reactive load bank enables comprehensive testing from a single unit. A range of resistive/reactive load banks are available to simulate these types of loads on a power source and the transformers, relays and switches which will distribute the power throughout the facility. Resistive/reactive load banks are great choices for testing turbines, switchgear, rotary UPS, generators and UPS systems. They can also be used for integrated system testing of utility substation protection systems, particularly for more complex relays like distance, directional overcurrent, power directional and others. A resistive/reactive inductive and/or capacitive load is often required to test solar inverters to ensure solar panels can be stopped from producing electricity in the event of a power outage. The resistive/reactive combination load banks are used to test the engine generator set at its rated power factor. In most cases this is 0.8 power factor. =Electronic load bank= An electronic load bank tends to be a fully programmable, air- or water-cooled design used to simulate a solid state load and to provide constant power and current loading on circuits for precision testing. Railways Where a diesel-electric locomotive is equipped for dynamic braking, the braking resistor may be used as a load bank for testing the engine-generator set.

I-80 enters Illinois from Iowa in the west, southwest of Rapids City and runs generally eastward through East Moline, LaSalle and Joliet, before entering Indiana in Lansing. The interstate runs for approximately through the state. In the 1920s, two state highways followed the general alignment that I-80 takes. In 1932 US 6 was extended through Illinois, paralleling the alignment that I-80 in Illinois. Construction started in 1957 and I-80 was completed in 1968. In the early 1990s Illinois wanted to reroute I-80 in the Quad Cities area. At the same time the section of I-80 that is concurrent with I-294 was reconstructed. The portion of I-80 that is concurrent with the Kingery Expressway was rebuilt in the mid-2000s. Route description Interstate 80 extends from west to east across the northern portion of the state through the population centers of Quad Cities and the south Chicago suburbs. The freeway is mostly maintained by Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), with Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (ISTHA) maintaining the section of I-80 that is concurrent with the Tri-State Tollway. The busiest section of the freeway is between the I-94 and IL 83 interchanges in Lansing. Approximately 181,200 vehicles used the freeway on average each day in 2011; in contrast the lowest traffic level was 16,400 vehicles between the IL 78 and IL 40 interchanges in Henry and Bureau Counties. I-80 contains between a minimum of four lanes and a maximum of ten lanes total. The majority of the highway runs through farmland and urban areas. =Iowa to Interstate 39= I-80 enters Illinois on the Fred Schwengel Memorial Bridge over the Mississippi River, southwest of Rapids City. After leaving the bridge the interstate has a folded diamond interchange with IL 84\\\\. The highway heads south, as a four-lane interstate, passing along the east side of the Quad Cities. Eastbound I-80 traffic has access to an Illinois Welcome Center. The road has a cloverleaf interchange with the western terminus of I-88. After the interchange with I-88, the highway crosses over Rock River. The interstate has a diamond interchange with U.S. Route 6 (US 6), before having an interchange with I-74 in East Moline. At this interchange, I-80 turns easterly paralleling US 6 and leaving the Quad Cities area. East of Quad Cities the interstate passes through rural farmland as a four-lane interstate. The road passes south of Geneseo, with the city having one interchange at IL 82. The road passes south of Atkinson, before passing over US 6 and a railroad track. After crossing over the railroad tracks the interstate has an interchange with IL 78, north of Annawan. The interstate continues towards the east having a folded diamond interchange with IL 40, before having rest areas on both sides of the roadway. The highway passes on the north side of Princeton, having an interchange with IL 26, near a commercial part of the city. I-80 passes over US 34, before leaving Princeton and having an interchange with the northern terminus of I-180. The interstate has a rural interchange with IL 89, before entering LaSalle. In LaSalle the highway, has a diamond interchange with 103 Road, just north of the Illinois Valley Regional Airport. The highway has an interchange with IL 251, with commercial properties around the interchange. I-80 has an interchange with IL 351, just south of the Mitchells Grove Nature Preserve, before having an interchange with I-39/US 51. =Interstate 39 to Indiana= Thornton Quarry with Interstate 80/Interstate 294/Tri-State Tollway above. After the interchange with I-39, I-80 leaves LaSalle, heading towards the east passing through rural farmland. Between 12th road and 14th Road the interstate passes the AASHO Road Test site, one of old test loops used for testing different types of road surfaces in the 1950s. The interstate enters Ottawa and has an interchange with IL 23, near many commercial businesses. After IL 23 the freeway leaves Ottawa and crosses over the Fox River, before having an interchange with IL 71\\\\. The road passes through rural farmland, having a few rural interchanges before entering Morris. In Morris the roadway curves toward the northeast, having an interchange with IL 47, near many commercial properties. The highway leaves Morris, passing through farmland, having a rural interchange with a county road. Both directions of I-80 have a rest area before entering Minooka. In Minooka the interstate curves the east, before turning back towards the northeast and leaving the village. The road enters Will County by curving towards the northeast. The interstate curves towards the east, before having an interchange with I-55. I-80 approaching the Des Plaines River Bridge After I-55, I-80 enters Joliet, passing near many warehouses. The road has an interchange with IL 7, before passing near residential. The road crosses over the Des Plaines River on the Des Plaines River Bridge. After the river the freeway has an interchange with US 52/IL 53\\\\. The interstate has an interchange with a city street, before crossing over a railroad tracks. After the railroad tracks the freeway has a diamond interchange with another city street. The road has a folded diamond interchange with US 30, before passing southeast of Potawatomi Woods County Forest Preserve. While passing through the preserve the roadway becomes a six- lane interstate. The interstate has an interchange with the southern terminus of the Veterans Memorial Tollway (I-355). The residential properties end and the highway passes through a more industrial area, before passing through the Yankee Woods (Cook County Forest Preserve). After the preserve the interstate has an interchange with I-57. I-80 joins the Tri-State Tollway (I-294) heading towards the east as a ten-lane tollway. The tollway passes over a rail yard, before having an interchange with IL 1\\\\. After IL 1 the roadway narrows to eight-lanes and passes through the Thornton Quarry. The interstate passes under the Chicago Southland Lincoln Oasis, before passing north of Wampum Lake. After passing the lake the tollway has an interchange with I-94. At this interchange with I-94 the Tri-State Tollway and I-294 both end, with I-94 running concurrent with I-80 towards the east. The concurrency between I-80 and I-94 travels on a freeway locally known as the Kingery Expressway. The interstate has a single-point urban interchange (SPUI) with IL 83 and the western end of US 6 concurrency. East of US 6 exit the freeway become a ten- lane interstate, passing near residential properties. The road enters Indiana and the freeway name becomes Borman Expressway. =Services= The IDOT operates 5 rest areas and ISHTA operates one Oasis in 163 miles of interstate highway. Along I-80, there are three locations that have facilities for each direction of traffic. Parking areas are divided so passenger automobiles are separated from semi trucks. Common among most of the rest stops are restrooms, payphones with TTY capabilities, weather information, picnic areas and vending machines. The eastbound rest area near Rapid City does not allow large trucks and doesn't have vending machines or TTY capabilities. The Oasis is the Chicago Southland Lincoln Oasis, located in South Holland. Like most of the other Oasis this location has several fast food restaurants, gas stations, convenience store, visitors center and free wireless internet. This Oasis is one of the few with an electric vehicle charging station. The Chicago Southland Lincoln Oasis was originally named Lincoln Oasis, the ISHTA added Chicago Southland to the name. The change was made to better represent the area around the Oasis. The Oasis' name was changed in February 2006 changing the name officially to the Chicago Southland Lincoln Oasis. History I-80 in Moline In 1917, there were many sections of named highways which made up the route that current I-80 takes through Illinois. The first was the Blue Line. It was routed between Rock Island and Princeton. The second section was named Sunset Trail and it traveled between Princeton and Ottawa, passing through LaSalle. Illinois Valley Trail went from Ottawa to Orland Park. From Orland Park to the Indiana state line no named highway was available. The first state highways along the I-80 corridor were numbered IL 7 from the Rock Island east to the Orland Park area and IL 53 from Orland Park east to Indiana state line in 1923. The United States Numbered Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926, and US 32 was routed between Rock Island and Princeton. East of Princeton US 32 followed a route closer to current US 34. US 6 was commissioned in Illinois in 1932 replacing US 32 west of Princeton, IL 7 between Princeton and Joliet, and IL 53 from Joliet to the Indiana state line. Construction of a test track for the Interstate Highway System between Utica and Ottawa began in 1952. The test track had six different segments of roadway, with different types of surfaces. One of the old test tracks can still be seen from I-80. The first section of I-80 to open was the section that is known as the Kingery Expressway, this section open in 1957, as US 6. In October 1958 the test track west of Ottawa opens to testing. The section of I-80 that is concurrent with the Tri-State Tollway was opened in 1958. November 1960 the testing at the test track is complete. The interstate opened between IL 71, near Ottawa, and I-55, near Joliet, in 1960. The segment of roadway between IL 23 and IL 71, near Ottawa, open in 1961. In 1962 the highway was extended west to IL 89, near LaSalle, replacing and paralleling the test track most of the way to Utica. Also in 1962, another section of road open between US 67 and IL 78. During 1964 and 1965 the gap between IL 78 and IL 89 was completed and opened to traffic. The north-south section of I-80 in Illinois was open in 1967. The last section of I-80 to open was the section between I-55 and the Tri-State Tollway, with it opening 1968. In 1990 and 1991, IDOT proposed rerouting I-80 onto present day I-280, with current I-80 becoming I-74. IDOT listed safety concerns and cost savings as reasons to reroute I-80. Iowa officials challenged the reroute of I-80 and the routes of I-74 and I-80 never changed. Between 1991 and 1992 the section of I-80 that is concurrent with the Tri-State Tollway was reconstructed and widened to eight- lanes. Between 2003 and 2007 construction to widen the Kingery Expressway, the project costed $460 Million. This was the first major project on the Kingey Expressway since it was opened in the 1950s. In early 2011, IDOT began construction to widen a section of freeway to six-lanes between US 30 and US 45\\\\. This project had an opening ceremony on October 24, 2012, with the project costing $26 million.

Established in 1956, it has been renamed several times before becoming Bentleigh Secondary College. Bentleigh Secondary College has recently been re-developed. In stage one of the building program, funded by the state government, a new performing arts centre, administration block, and sports stadium were built. The building that was previously the college library has been converted into a VCE centre. A new science block was also completed in late 2008, following the demolition of what was previously B-block and C-block. Campus The college is made up of eight main buildings: * D-Block is used primarily for art, IT and LOTE classes. It also contains year 10 lockers. * The Administration Block was built in stage one of the college's building program. It consists of offices, conference rooms, a staff room and a sick bay as well as a Food Tech room * The Performing Arts Centre was converted in 2006 from the Bertrand-Mitchell Hall (a theatre building). While the same structure was kept, the interior was completely refurbished. The centre was renamed in 2009 to the 'Peter Stevens Performing Arts Centre'. The centre currently boasts a main theatre area, foyer, dance room, drama room, two music classrooms and music practise rooms. Featuring retractable tiered seating, it is also attached to the canteen. * The Sports Stadium, informally known by students as \\"the barcode\\" due to its prominent design, boasts two sports courts and changerooms. Heavily utilised by sports and PE classes, the stadium is also rented to the community, and sports organisations such as basketball teams are based there. * The VCE Centre was converted from the former library. It has an open plan style with teachers' desks at the centre, several classrooms, and generous study space. It is used by students, particularly those in year 12, undertaking VCE studies. * The Science Block was completed under stage two of the college's building program, and incorporates the college library. Most of the Year 9 lockers are located beside this block as well as the Year 8's. Also known as L-Block * The J-Block is where Year 11 & 12 lockers are and main classrooms. There are 7 classrooms and all except 3 are joined. J-Block is named after former school principal Hugh Jones. The college grounds include a sustainable garden, a football oval and soccer pitches. LOTE Students learn Japanese and attend three periods of their elected language per week for Year 7 and 8. After Year 8, LOTE (Japanese) becomes an electives subject. Gifted and Talented Program The college has implemented a Gifted and Talented Program whereby students, based on the results of a standardised test undertaken before entering high school, of high potential to achieve are grouped into one class until the end of year nine. In this case, the class is 7.4, 8.4 and 9.4. 10.4 is renamed 10D which also contains the students from previous .4 classes and does Advanced English, Advanced Maths and Advanced Science. Performing arts Performing arts at Bentleigh Secondary College consists of music, drama and dance. With the option to study an instrument, there are several well-developed school bands. The Symphonic Wind Ensemble is the most senior of the bands made up of brass, woodwind and percussion players. This ensemble competed in the Advanced Concert Band section of the Melbourne School Bands festival for the first time in 2009. There is also a concert band, Intermediate Band and Year 7 Concert Band. There are Senior, Intermediate and Junior Jazz Bands, as well as senior rock band which perform at the annual \\"Big Band Boogie\\" and on concert nights. In addition to these bands there are a dozen or so small ensembles such as brass ensemble and clarinet ensemble. Also new this year is the college choir, which is open for all students to join. 'Chicago: A Musical Vaudeville' is the school's production for 2011. For each school production, the Music Department also organises a production band of students and staff to accompany the actors.

It opened in 1903. Serving exceptionally sparsely inhabited areas it was never commercially successful, but it rekindled hostilities between larger railways over a planned railway connection along the Great Glen reaching Inverness; however this scheme never materialised. Passenger train operation ceased in 1933 and the line closed completely in 1946.  Background  The Great Glen is a fault-controlled glacial valley that runs diagonally across the Highlands of Scotland from Fort William on Loch Linnhe in the south west to Inverness on the Moray Firth in the north east. It forms an easy communication route and as well as roads, the Caledonian Canal was constructed along it by linking natural lochs with canal sections. It opened to sea-going vessels in 1822 but the limited size of the canal sections proved inadequate for general merchant shipping.A D Cameron, The Caledonian Canal, Birlinn Ltd, 2005, In the railway age, Inverness was an important commercial centre, and from 1854 it was the focus of railway communication, and from a company amalgamation in 1865 the Highland Railway was dominant in that area. Agriculture and industry was active in the eastern side of the country and railway development there was more vigorous. By contrast the western side of the area was backward and depressed. The first railway to attempt to reach the west coast was the Dingwall and Skye Railway, authorised in 1865 to build from Dingwall, north of Inverness, to Kyle of Lochalsh, close to the Isle of Skye. In fact the line opened only as far as Stromeferry on Loch Carron, a more difficult anchorage than Kyle of Lochalsh, in 1870. (The Highland Railway later absorbed the Dingwall and Skye Railway, and in 1897 it extended the line to Kyle of Lochalsh.)H A Vallance, C R Clinker and Anthony J Lambert, The Highland Railway, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1985, An approach to the west coast further south was attempted by the Callander and Oban Railway, by extending from an existing branch line from Dunblane at Callander. Oban was already an important hub of communication with the islands and coastal towns. The construction of this line was also difficult, passing through rocky landscapes with a thin population density. There were serious money problems, but with the considerable support of the Caledonian Railway Oban was at last connected to the railway system in 1880.John Thomas, The Callander and Oban Railway, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1966 Widespread attention was given to the depressed economic conditions in the West Highlands, and in the 1883 Parliamentary session the Glasgow and North Western Railway was proposed. It was to leave the North British Railway at Maryhill (on the north west margin of Glasgow) and run by Loch Lomondside and Glencoe to Fort William and Inverness. This was an ambitious scheme, but the Highland Railway saw it as a threat to its supremacy in its area, and it opposed the scheme vigorously; the result was that the Glasgow and North Western Railway was rejected in Parliament.John McGregor, The West Highland Railway‚ÄîPlans Politics and People, John Donald, Edinburgh, 2005, It was a more modest proposal that actually provided the third link to the western coast: the West Highland Railway, which built a line from Craigendoran, opened in 1894 and extended to Banavie, on the Caledonian Canal, the following year. The West Highland Railway had intended to build their line to Roshven, in the Sound of Arisaig. Major difficulties had arisen with landowners' objections to the Roshven line, and the West Highland Railway contented itself with extending instead to Mallaig from Fort William, and that section opened in 1901. The West Highland Railway was sponsored by the North British Railway, and hostility flared up between the NBR and the Highland Railway. Both companies proposed lines along the Great Glen in 1893, before reviewing their intentions and withdrawing their schemes, and agreed not to promote further similar schemes for a period of ten years, the so-called \\"ten year truce\\". Planning The contractor and entrepreneur Charles Forman had been active in encouraging the various Great Glen schemes, and now he proposed the Invergarry and Fort Augustus Railway; it was to run to Fort Augustus from Spean Bridge on the West Highland Railway. In 1896 the board of the company comprised: *Sir Donald Matheson KCB (chairman) *Captain Edward Charles Ellice (deputy chairman) *James Scarlett, 1st Baron Abinger *Michael Bass, 1st Baron Burton *John Charles Cuninghame 17th Laird of Craigends and Upper Foyers *John Neilson of Glasgow, *George Malcolm of Invergarry The scheme attracted considerable local support and it obtained its authorising Act of Parliament on 14 August 1896.David Ross, The North British Railway‚ÄîA History, Stenlake Publishing, Catrine, 2014, David Ross, The Highland Railway, Tempus Publishing Limited, Stroud, 2005, The population of Fort Augustus was less than 500, and it was widely assumed that the line was a speculative bid to reach Inverness. Construction tunnel near Loch Oich Formans and McCall were appointed engineers of the railway, and James Young of Glasgow was the contractor. Construction started on 2 March 1897 when Mrs Margaret Ellice of Invergarry, wife of Captain Edward Ellice, deputy chairman of the company, cut the first turf. but the process was very slow, in part due to an exceptionally high standard of specification for the architectural and engineering assets. Elaborate stations with spacious goods yards were provided. Invergarry had four goods sidings and separate loading banks for cattle and goods.John Thomas, Forgotten Railways: Scotland, David and Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1976, In April 1900 the directors paid a visit of inspection and travelled over the whole length of the line, which was reported as practically completed. The line was 23 miles 13 chains in length to Fort Augustus station; the Pier extension was 73 chains. The first mile and last mile of the railway absorbed around one third of the capital expenditure. From the west end of Spean Bridge the line passed along the banks of the River Spean and through a gorge which required four lattice spans at a maximum height above the river of , one of , two of and one of . After a stretch through wooded countryside, it crossed the river Gloy on a three-span lattice girder bridge of two spans and one span. The line then climbed to the summit of at Letterfinlay. The descent to the Great Glen included the Oich tunnel, and a four-span Calder Burn viaduct to reach Aberchalder. The final stretch followed the shoreline of Loch Uanagan to Fort Augustus town station. From there it crossed the Caledonian Canal on a swing bridge to the pier station on Loch Ness. The line had a ruling gradient of 1 in 66 and was single throughout, although land had been acquired for double track. there were passing loops at all the stations, which were: * Spean Bridge (West Highland Railway station); * Gairlochy; * Invergloy; opened June 1904; * Letterfinlay; crossing place only; never brought into use an subsequently dismantled * Invergarry; * Aberchalder; * Fort Augustus; with three platform faces * Fort Augustus Pier; passenger service in summer only; closed 1 October 1906.M E Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England Scotland and Wales‚ÄîA Chronology, The Railway and Canal Historical Society, 2002 The line had cost ¬£344,000 () to construct, or around ¬£14,300 per mile. Michael Bass, 1st Baron Burton had provided ¬£163,000 of the capital required for construction. The line was ready for opening in 1901, but the company had run out of money and had none to purchase locomotives, coaches and wagons. The company approached the North British Railway to operate the line for them. The Highland Railway objected to this and the matter was investigated by Parliamentary authorities. This led to a lengthy delay in agreeing terms of operation. The North British Railway required 60% of the revenue with a minimum of ¬£3,000 each year (). The Highland Railway agreed to operate it at ¬£2,000 per half year. The Invergarry and Fort Augustus Railway company had to submit a private bill to parliament to confirm the working arrangement, and this was passed on 30 June 1903. Operations =Opening= On 14 July 1903 Colonel John Wallace Pringle inspected the railway on behalf of the Board of Trade and declared it open for traffic. The line opened to passengers on 22 July 1903.\\"Brunel Redivivus\\", New Railway in the Highlands: Opening of the Invergarry and Fort Augustus Railway, in Railway Magazine, September 1903 The formal ceremony was performed at Spean Bridge by Mrs Eliza Stewart Ellice, of Invergarry, who had cut the first turf in 1897. She was presented with a gold whistle. A large party of invited guests travelled by train to Fort Augustus where they were entertained by William Whitelaw, chairman of the Highland Railway Company, to luncheon at the Lovat Arms Hotel. The company appointed Hugh Fraser as stationmaster at Fort Augustus, James Morrison at Invergarry and Donald Macdonald to Gairlochy. The building of the line was the signal for a resumption of the fight for a railway along the Great Glen: the I&FAR; itself as well as the Highland Railway and the North British Railway proposed lines linking to Inverness, but the Highland gained the ascendency. However it was excluded in the Commons from running powers over the I&FAR;, and the Highland Bill was subsequently thrown out in the Lords. Remaining pier of the old railway bridge over the River Oich. By the 32nd section of its Act of Incorporation, the railway was, for the benefit of the owners of the Glengarry estate, required to construct, a permanent station at within 2 furlongs of the South-West end of Loch Oich, \\"to be called Invergarry Station, for passengers, animals and goods, with separate waiting-rooms for ladies and gentlemen and other usual and necessary accommodation therein\\" and to \\"stop all ordinary trains other than express or special or excursion trains at such station daily for the purpose of taking up and setting down traffic of any kind.\\" =Highland Railway = A 4-4-0 tank engine, no 52 was generally used as the motive power during the Highland Railway period. There were four trains each way daily. In September 1905, King Edward VII travelled over the line from Spean Bridge to Invergarry with George Cadogan, 5th Earl Cadogan and Countess Cadogan. A 1909 Railway Clearing House map showing the Invergarry and Fort Augustus Railway, with a portion of the West Highland RailwayThe Fort Augustus Pier station was on Loch Ness and tourist traffic was contemplated. However the dominant steamer operator on the loch, David MacBrayne Ltd, declined to use the railway pier and it saw very little use. The extension to the pier involved a hand-operated swing bridge over the Caledonian Canal and a viaduct over the River Oich. Passenger traffic on the pier extension was suspended from 1 October 1906,In Forgotten Railways page 202 Thomas says \\"On 30th September 1907 the I&FAR; closed its pier and station at Fort Augustus, and abandoned the expensive and little-used approach. In the following year the Highland withdrew its trains and the NB moved in to work the line...\\" The date 30 September 1906 is used by other authorities (Vallance, Clinker and Lambert; Quick) and in any case the NBR took over in 1907, not 1908. It was of course the Pier station, not Fort Augustus station that was closed to passengers. The approach line and Pier station remained in use for goods purposes for some years. although occasional goods trains ran until July 1924 when the extension was finally closed permanently. In March 1906 many areas of the western Highlands experienced exceptional rainfall and flooding. Describing the dislocation to railways in the Lochaber area the Scotsman reported > The most serious damage reported, however, occurred on the Invergarry and > Fort-Augustus Railway, in the neighbourhood of Letterfinlay, where two large > sections of the line have been washed away by the enormous rush of water > down the hillside.

The Highland Railway decided to cut its losses: confident that its supremacy at Inverness was no longer at risk. It withdrew its trains from 1 May 1907. > The abandonment of the Invergarry and Fort-Augustus Railway by the Highland > Railway Company will surprise no-one who knows the conditions under which > that line is at present worked.

The NBR operated two trains each way daily, but increased this to four in the summer. The North British Railway proposed to close the line down from 31 January 1911, but the wealthy sponsors of the I&FAR; persuaded them to persevere for one more summer, which they did. The financial situation did not improve and the NBR withdrew its trains from 31 October 1911.Ross has this in reverse in The North British Railway: he says that the Invergarry and Fort Augustus Railway \\"directors had proposed to close [their line] down from 31 January 1911, rather than share half the company's deficit with the North British, but the NBR persuaded them to hold off.\\" It is difficult to follow how that can be accurate. The line was now closed, and for the time being it avoided the operating costs that led to the huge losses, while the company contented itself with taking in small sums of non-railway income. A huge movement of public opinion now took place urging retention of the line, notwithstanding the extremely low usage of it when it was operating. A request for Government support was put forward, though without success, and for the time being the line remained closed. In 1912 the NBR offered to purchase the line for ¬£22,500 () but the I&FAR; company refused the sale. The company offered the railway for sale in December 1912, but were taken to the Court of Session by Lochaber District Committee, Aird District Committee, the trustee of Edward Ellice and Major Bailey of Invergarry on 5 February 1913 to prevent the assets being sold for scrap. This was referred to the First Division of the Court of Session in March 1913 who found in favour of the complainants and prevented the railway from being sold. In 1913 Inverness- shire County Council offered to contribute an additional ¬£5,000 and the sale was agreed at ¬£27,500; by an Act of 28 August 1914 the transfer was authorised by Parliament. The NBR resumed working the line on 1 August 1913, as contractors to the I&FAR; for the time being; formal transfer to the North British Railway took place on 30 August 1914. There were three trains daily in summer and two in winter. Through trains to and from Fort William were later operated. The railway suffered two landslides in 1916 which affected services badly. At the end of January, floods caused a landslide resulting in around 1,000 tons of debris blocking several hundred yards of line just east of Invergarry station. In October more heavy rain caused flooding which suspended traffic on the line. On 2 August 1924, another cloudburst caused a landslide a mile north of Invergarry and a train from Fort Augustus rain into the debris on the line and derailed. A writer for the Railway Magazine had a run on the line in 1940: > Passenger and parcels traffic on the Fort Augustus branch was suspended in > November, 1933, and there is now only one weekly coal and petrol train, > leaving Spean Bridge at 10.30 a.m. on Saturdays, all other traffic being > dealt with by L.N.E.R. motor lorries and David McBrayne‚Äôs buses and > steamers, the latter in summer only.

Weekly coal trains continued running until they were withdrawn and the line closed on 31 December 1946.The Story of the West Highland, published by the London and North Eastern Railway, 1944 (written anonymously by George Dow) The last train to run on the line was on 31 December 1946 with 18 wagons loaded with timber. After closure, Fort Augustus station was occupied by a company constructing a hydro electric power scheme, and on 30 October 1950, the station building was badly damaged by fire. Preservation Some of the line today has been built over by roads and holiday parks, although it mostly survives in a reasonably good, if overgrown, condition. The many bridges and single tunnel are in particularly good condition. Some of the line along Loch Oich has been incorporated into the Great Glen Way, and a further section is now part of National Cycle Route 78. A restoration project is (2016) under way at Invergarry Station, the last remaining station that is largely intact. The Invergarry Station Preservation Society plan to create a static museum, with a short length of track and several freight wagons. In March 2015 480 ft of track was laid in platform 1. Work then commenced in constructing the replica signal cabin on the platform. The project is now known as the Invergarry & Fort Augustus Railway Museum. The track has been extended a quarter of a mile to the west and in 2020 a spur will cross the cycle track giving access to the sidings.

Typically, the active metal precursor is dissolved in an aqueous or organic solution. Then the metal-containing solution is added to a catalyst support containing the same pore volume as the volume of the solution that was added. Capillary action draws the solution into the pores. Solution added in excess of the support pore volume causes the solution transport to change from a capillary action process to a diffusion process, which is much slower. The catalyst can then be dried and calcined to drive off the volatile components within the solution, depositing the metal on the catalyst surface. The maximum loading is limited by the solubility of the precursor in the solution. The concentration profile of the impregnated compound depends on the mass transfer conditions within the pores during impregnation and drying.

He discovered the rich deposit of alluvial diamonds at Alexander Bay in Namaqualand, vast platinum and chrome reefs at Lydenburg, Rustenburg and Potgietersrus, which led to some of the largest platinum mines in the world, phosphates and copper at Phalaborwa in the Transvaal lowveld, gold in the Free State and the world‚Äôs biggest chrome deposit at Jagdlust near Pietersburg. Life Hans Merensky was born on 16 March 1871 at Berlin Missionary Society station Botshabelo, near Middelburg in Transvaal, where his father, Alexander Merensky (1837‚Äì1918), a noted ethnographer and author, was the resident missionary. Keenly interested in minerals and enjoying outdoor living, he studied mining geology after finishing his schooling in Germany. He was awarded a doctorate in mining geology from the University of Charlottenburg in Berlin. He completed his practical training in coal mines in the Saarland and in Silesia and began work for the Department of Mines in East Prussia. In 1904 he came to South Africa to conduct some geological surveys in the Transvaal. He discovered tin near Pretoria and reported to the Premier Diamond Mine regarding possible mining prospects. He worked for several mining companies and Friedlaender & Co. sent him to Madagascar to investigate a reported discovery of gold, which turned out to be false. He resigned from his job in Germany and moved to Johannesburg where he became a successful consulting geologist. In 1909 he visited the diamond fields of South West Africa and controversially predicted that diamonds would be found along the West coast and south of the Orange River. In 1913 Merensky lost his entire fortune due to the Depression, and was interned at a camp near Pietermaritzburg. During these financially difficult years he enjoyed the support of Sir George Albu. In 1924 he followed up the discovery of alluvial platinum by A F Lombard on his farm in Lydenburg and discovered its source in the Bushveld Igneous Complex which set him on the road to financial recovery. This deposit came eventually to be known as the Merensky Reef, which contains 75 per cent of the world's known platinum resources. In 1926 diamonds were found at Alexander Bay and Merensky received ¬£1,250,000 for his prospector's share. He established the Phosphate Development Corporation Ltd. - FOSKOR - to manage the extraction of phosphates at Phalaborwa. In his final years he lived unostentatiously on his farm Westfalia near Duiwelskloof in Transvaal, where he received local celebrities and foreign dignitaries. He died on 21 October 1952.  Legacy  Merensky allotted the larger part of his fortune to the Hans Merensky Trust to ensure that his projects in agriculture, horticulture and forestry operations on the Westfalia Estate would be continued after his death. He established the Hans Merensky Library at the University of Pretoria. In 2004, Martin Enlen directed a German language movie called Platinum based on Hans Merensky‚Äôs life. Both overdubbed and subtitled English versions of this movie exist. The Hans Merensky Wilderness, a protected area in Limpopo, and Merensky High School, an agricultural and academic public school on a farm near Tzaneen, are named after him.

Its local government area is the Town of Victoria Park. Victoria Park is the eastern gateway to Perth's central business district (CBD), being the intersection of the three original eastern arterial roads: Albany Highway, Canning Highway, Great Eastern Highway, and the Causeway Bridge. The Causeway connects Victoria Park to the city, located to the northwest. History The suburb of Victoria Park derives its name from \\"Victoria Park Estate\\", a development that took place there in the 1890s. It is believed the name was given to the estate because Queen Victoria was still on the throne, although it may be connected with Victoria Park in Melbourne. The area was originally the largest portion of a grant of to John Butler in 1831. Progress and development was initially very slow, but a few houses were built around coach stops on the Albany Road, initially constructed from hand-sawn wooden logs. The road was rebuilt in the early 1860s by convicts. At this time the entire area from Canning Bridge to Belmont was simply known as \\"Canning\\". In 1886, a settlement started at \\"2 Mile Spring\\", opposite the present location of the Broken Hill Hotel, and a year later, subdivision commenced. The building of the railway to Pinjarra in 1893 had a huge effect on the area - within a few years, a state school was built on Cargill Street and by 1898, the population had reached 1,197. The following year, Broken Hill Hotel and the Town Hall were constructed, serving as both a community centre and as the council office for the Municipality of Victoria Park (until amalgamation with the City of Perth in 1917). The Town Hall was later demolished, while the Broken Hill Hotel is listed by the National Trust. A tram service commenced in 1905, and by 1917 the population had reached 5,000, and had at their disposal electric lighting, a public library (1903), police station (1906), Victoria Park Post Office (1912), bowling club (1913) and two hotels, as well as several banks and numerous commercial enterprises and factories. After World War I, Albany Highway was bitumenised, and the commercial centre on either side of the road grew to rival centres in more established areas.Dr Geoff Gallop. \\"From The Swan To The Canning - Historical Notes on Victoria Park and Surrounding Districts\\", December 1989. Originally published in Southern Gazette, 21 November 1989, p.6. Accessed at Battye Library, Perth. While by 1937 considered a \\"working man's district\\", by the mid-1970s the area had a higher- than-average elderly population according to ABS statistics, and the development of townhouses in place of some of the original dwellings saw increasing gentrification as city workers settled in areas closer to the Perth central business district. In 1993, Burswood was approved as a name for the northeastern part of Victoria Park, and split away from it. =The Causeway Bridge= The Causeway Bridge was the first major bridge engineering project in or about Perth, and involved augmenting the Heirisson mudflats into a proper island. The mudflats were at that time an important resource for the Noongar peoples. The current bridge is the third in that location. It was originally opened in 1843, then largely rebuilt after disastrous floods in 1862, and reopened in 1867. It was improved several times in 1899, 1903, 1933 and 1943, then completely rebuilt from 1947 and reopened in 1952. Geography Victoria Park is bounded by the Swan River to the northwest, Shepperton Road, Harper Street and the Armadale railway line to the northeast, Miller and Kent Streets to the southeast and a line southwest of Berwick Street to the southwest. The suburb is mostly residential, although Albany Highway is a commercial \\"high street\\" and a number of parks can be found - most notably McCallum Park on the river, Raphael Park and the smaller Read Park and Hawthorne Park. Demographics At the 2001 Australian census, Victoria Park had a population of 6,980 people living in 3,998 dwellings. Over a quarter of Victoria Park's residents live in unit or apartment blocks. The ABS identified property and business services and retail as the primary occupations, followed by health, manufacturing, hospitality and education. 15.2% of those surveyed were from East or South-East Asia, while sizable Italian and South Asian minorities were reported. Transport Victoria Park is a major transit route, being the intersection point of Canning Highway to South Perth, Applecross and Fremantle; Great Eastern Highway to Belmont and Perth Airport; Albany Highway to Cannington and Armadale; and The Causeway to Perth's CBD. Albany Highway runs through the suburb as a main shopping street. Victoria Park is served by the Victoria Park train station on its northeastern corner, and by the Victoria Park bus station on the eastern end of The Causeway. All services are operated by the Public Transport Authority.

He was as a dominant faceoff man and a very physical player. Amateur career Growing up, Snider played for the Calgary Hornets in the Calgary District Lacrosse Association. His junior lacrosse career began with the Burnaby Lakers of the British Columbia Junior A Lacrosse League. In 1998, 2000 and 2002, he helped the Lakers win the Minto Cup as Canada's champion junior men's lacrosse team. He continued to play with the Senior \\"A\\" Coquitlam Adanacs in the Western Lacrosse Association, leading them to win the 2007 WLA championship. Snider honed his physical game in the summer box lacrosse seasons and in junior hockey. With the junior ice hockey Calgary Canucks, of the Alberta Junior Hockey League, Snider racked up 415 penalty minutes during the 2001‚Äì02 season. In lacrosse he has developed a reputation as being one of lacrosse's top fighters. Fighting in box lacrosse is viewed similar to fighting in ice hockey, and is typically disciplined with a major penalty. Collegiate career Snider attended the University of Denver. In 2006, with the Pioneers he was named a third-team All-American. His 194 recorded groundballs as a senior holds the record for a single season groundballs in NCAA lacrosse. In addition he holds the standard for highest average groundballs per game in a season with 11.41. Professional career =NLL career= Snider was drafted by the Philadelphia Wings of the National Lacrosse League in the first round (fourth overall) of the 2006 NLL Entry Draft. Snider made an immediate impact on the league and was named the NLL's January Rookie of the Month. Snider scored 13 points (6G, 7A), collected 53 loose balls and won 53 of 79 face-off attempts in five games during his first month of action in the league. He was also the only rookie voted onto the 2007 All-Star team, and won the Accuracy challenge in the All-Star game Skills Competition. After the season, Snider was named to the 2007 All-Rookie team. On 26 January 2008, Snider put his name in the record books again when he won the opening face-off in a game against the Buffalo Bandits and scored :05 seconds into the game. This goal is the league record for fastest goal to start a game. In the 2008 season, Snider was named to the All-Star team, and was named game MVP after scoring three goals, recording 28 loose balls, and winning 31 out of 38 face-offs. He set league records in loose balls (244), faceoffs won (318), and penalty minutes (103), and fell just short of tying his own faceoff winning percentage record of 75%, winning 73.8% of his faceoffs. During the 2009 NLL season, he was named a starter to the All-Star Game but was unable to play due to injury when he suffered a tracheal fracture (windpipe) in a game against the Edmonton Rush. Snider was also named to the 2012 All-Star game and scored 4 goals, added 2 assists, and won 22 of 26 faceoffs. Snider was named game MVP. =MLL= Snider was drafted by the Denver Outlaws of Major League Lacrosse in the second round of the MLL Collegiate Draft.

He complained in his twenty-seventh year that he had to work hard to support himself and his family (see end of Tola'at Ya'a·∏≥ob). He was an enthusiastic cabalist, noted for thorough mastery of the whole cabalistic lore, the most important points of which he, as far as can be judged now, was the first of his generation to treat systematically. He must be regarded, therefore, as the precursor of Moshe Cordovero and Isaac Luria. His first work, completed in 1507 and held in high regard, was Tola'at Ya'a·∏≥ob, a cabalistic exposition of the prayer ritual. His chief work, which he finished December 22, 1531, after having spent eight years on it, was Avodat Hakodesh, in which he expounds in detail his cabalistic system, making a close study of Maimonides in order the better to refute him. In 1539 he wrote an exposition and defense of the Sefirot under the title Derek Emunah, in answer to his pupil Joseph ha-Levi, who had questioned him in regard to his doctrine of the Sefirot, Gabbai basing his work on Azriel of Gerona's Perush 'Eser Sefirot. Gabbai regarded the Zohar as the canonical book of the Kabbala. His system is tinged with panentheism. God Himself, as the first cause of all causes, can neither be conceived nor cognized, and can not even be mentioned; the name \\"En Sof\\" (Infinite) is a mere makeshift. Even the Keter Elyon, the first Sefirah, can not be conceived or imagined; it is coeternal with the En Sof, although only its effect; it is what is called in Scripture \\"His Name.\\" By means of it the other sefirot emanated from God, being the various manifestations through which the Godhead makes Himself cognizable. To them the prayers are addressed, and they are intended in the different designations of God, whose relation to them is the same as that of the soul to the body. The other emanations are the seven \\"hekalot,\\" which proceed from the sefirot, and represent in a way the feminine world as contrasted with the masculine world of the sefirot; they are the real vessels of the further development of the world. This emanation of the world from God constitutes the \\"glory of God.\\" The consciousness of dependence on God, with the striving toward Him in order to be united and become one with Him, and thereby to acknowledge His unity and effect its realization, is the \\"yi·∏•ud,\\" \\"the conscious union with God,\\" which is the final aim of the world. Man, a reflection of the highest \\"hekal,\\" unites in his soul the rays of all the sefirot, and in himself in general as microcosm all the basic elements of being. His soul therefore is in connection with the upper world, which it is able to influence and stimulate by its actions and aspirations; for everything that happens in this world reaches in wave-like circles to the uppermost regions. By recognizing and fulfilling the religious and moral precepts man advances the harmony and union of the various grades of creatures, and succeeds in performing his task in life‚Äîthe bringing about of the \\"yi·∏•ud.\\" Gabbai's son ·∏§ayyim was also a cabalist: and his son-in- law Senior ben Judah Falcon published Gabbai's first two books after his death, the Tola'at Ya'a·∏≥ob with the aid of Abraham Reyna at Constantinople in 1560, and Avodat Hakodesh at Venice in 1567.

Published in 1804. Claude-Nicolas Ledoux (21 March 1736 ‚Äì 18 November 1806) was one of the earliest exponents of French Neoclassical architecture. He used his knowledge of architectural theory to design not only domestic architecture but also town planning; as a consequence of his visionary plan for the Ideal City of Chaux, he became known as a utopian.Vidler 2006, p. 10. His greatest works were funded by the French monarchy and came to be perceived as symbols of the Ancien R√©gime rather than Utopia. The French Revolution hampered his career; much of his work was destroyed in the nineteenth century. In 1804, he published a collection of his designs under the title L'Architecture consid√©r√©e sous le rapport de l'art, des m≈ìurs et de la l√©gislation (Architecture considered in relation to art, morals, and legislation).Digital copy of L'Architecture consid√©r√©e at Gallica. In this book he took the opportunity of revising his earlier designs, making them more rigorously neoclassical and up to date. This revision has distorted an accurate assessment of his role in the evolution of Neoclassical architecture.Eriksen 1974, p. 66. His most ambitious work was the uncompleted Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans, an idealistic and visionary town showing many examples of architecture parlante.Mallgrave 2005, p. 191. Conversely his works and commissions also included the more mundane and everyday architecture such as approximately sixty elaborate tollgates around Paris in the Wall of the General Tax Farm. Biography Ledoux was born in 1736 in Dormans-sur- Marne, the son of a modest merchant from Champagne. At an early age his mother, Francoise Domino, and godmother, Francoise Piloy, encouraged him to develop his drawing skills. Later the Abbey of Sassenage funded his studies in Paris (1749‚Äì1753) at the Coll√®ge de Beauvais, where he followed a course in Classics. On leaving the Coll√®ge, age 17, he took employment as an engraver but four years later he began to study architecture under the tutelage of Jacques-Fran√ßois Blondel, for whom he maintained a lifelong respect. He then trained under Pierre Contant d'Ivry, and also made the acquaintance of Jean- Michel Chevotet. These two eminent Parisian architects designed in both the restrained French Rococo manner, known as the \\"Louis XV style\\" and in the \\"Go√ªt grec\\" (literally \\"Greek taste\\") phase of early Neoclassicism. However, under the tutelage of Contant d'Ivry and Chevotet, Ledoux was also introduced to Classical architecture, in particular the temples of Paestum, which, along with the works of Palladio, were to influence him greatly. The two master architects introduced Ledoux to their affluent clientele. One of Ledoux's first patrons was the Baron Crozat de Thiers, an immensely wealthy connoisseur who commissioned him to remodel part of his palatial town house in the Place Vend√¥me. Another client obtained through the auspices of his teachers was Pr√©sident Hocquart de Montfermeil Pr√©sident Antoine-Louis Hyacinthe Hocquart de Montfermeil (1739-1794), president of the Court of Assistance of the Paris Parliament (1770), general prosecutor (1778), President and first president (1789); after he was executed during the Reign of Terror, his collection of paintings were declared nationals treasures and dispersed among provincial museums. and his sister, Mme de Montesquiou. =Early work (1762‚Äì1770)= Ch√¢teau de Mauperthuis, 1763 (demolished) In 1762, the young Ledoux was commissioned to redecorate the Caf√© Godeau, in the rue Saint-Honor√©. The result was an interior of trompe l'oeil and mirrors. Pilasters painted on the walls were interspersed with alternating Pier glasses and panels painted with trophies of helmets and weaponry, all executed in bold detail. In 1969 this interior was moved to the Mus√©e Carnavalet. The following year the Marquis de Montesquiou-F√©zensac commissioned Ledoux to redesign the old hilltop ch√¢teau on his estate at Mauperthuis. Ledoux rebuilt the ch√¢teau and created new gardens, replete with fountains supplied by an aqueduct. In addition in the gardens and park he built an orangery, a pheasantry and vast d√©pendances of which little remains today. In 1764, he designed for Pr√©sident Hocquart, a Palladian house on the Chauss√©e d'Antin using the colossal order. Ledoux would frequently employ this motif that was condemned by the strict French tradition, which embraced the principle of superimposing the classic column motifs on each floor, rising from simplest to the most complex: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, etc. H√¥tel d'Hallwyll, Paris, 1766. Elevation of the facade on the rue Michel-le-Comte. On 26 July 1764, in the Saint-Eustache Church, Paris, Ledoux married Marie Bureau, the daughter of a court musician. A friend from Champagne, Joseph Marin Masson de Courcelles, found him a position as the architect for the Water and Forestry Department. Here between 1764 and 1770 he worked on the renovation and designs of churches, bridges, wells, fountains and schools, in Tonnerrois, S√©nonais and Bassigny. Among the still extant works from this period are the bridge of Marac, the Pr√©gibert bridge in Rolampont, the churches of Fouvent-le-Haut, Roche-et-Raucourt, Rolampont, the nave and portal of Cruzy-le-Ch√¢tel, and the quire of Saint-Etienne d'Auxerre. In 1766 Ledoux began designing the H√¥tel d'Hallwyll (Le Marais, Paris), a building that, according to the Dijon architect Jacques Cellerier, received widespread praise and attracted new patrons to the architect.Braham 1980, p. 161. The owner Franz-Joseph d'Hallwyll (a Swiss colonel) and his wife, Marie- Th√©r√®se Demidorge, were anxious to ensure work was executed economically. Therefore, Ledoux had to reuse portions of the existing buildings, the former H√¥tel de Bouligneux. He had envisaged two colonnades in the Doric order leading to a nymphaeum decorated with urns at the foot of the garden. However, the limitations of the site made this impossible, so Ledoux resorted to trompe l'oeil painting a colonnade on the blind wall of the neighboring convent, thus extending the perspective. The recognition given to the relatively modest H√¥tel d'Hallwyll led in 1767 to a more prestigious commission, the H√¥tel d'Uz√®s, for Fran√ßois Emmanuel de Crussol on the rue Montmartre. There too, Ledoux preserved the structure of an earlier building. Today the panelling from the salon, an early example of the neoclassical style, largely carved by Joseph M√©tivier and Jean-Baptist Boiston to the designs of Ledoux, is preserved in the Carnavalet Museum, Paris.Braham 1980, p. 167 (figure 215). Pavilion of Mme du Barry, Louveciennes, 1770-1771 Ledoux designed the Ch√¢teau de B√©nouville in Calvados (1768‚Äì1769) for the Marquis de Livry. With its simple, almost severe, facade of four stories, broken by a prostyle portico, the Ch√¢teau de B√©nouville, while not one of Ledoux's most inventive plans, is notable for the unusual placement of the main staircase at the center of the garden facade, a position normally taken by the main salon.Braham 1980, p. 169. Ledoux travelled to England in the years 1769-1771. There he became familiar with the Palladian style of architecture. Palladio, an influential Renaissance architect, was famous for his Italian villas (e.g., the Villa Rotunda). From this point Ledoux worked often in the Palladian style, usually employing a cubic design broken by a prostyle portico which gave an air of importance even to a small structure. In this genre, he built, in 1770, a house for Marie Madeleine Guimard in the Chauss√©e d'Antin; and following that commission the house of Mlle Saint-Germain, in the Rue Saint-Lazare, the house of Attilly in the suburb of Poissonni√®re, a house for the poet Jean Fran√ßois de Saint-Lambert in Eaubonne, and most notably the Music Pavilion constructed between 1770 and 1771 at the Ch√¢teau de Louveciennes for the King's mistress Madame du Barry, whose patronage and influence were to be of use to Ledoux in later years.Palmer 2011, p. 138. Later works Madame du Barry, for whom Ledoux designed a Music Pavilion at her Ch√¢teau de Louveciennes, was to use her influence to advance his career His reputation established, Ledoux commenced a period of yet more ambitious designs. The H√¥tel de Montmorency on the Chauss√©e d'Antin dates from this period. It has a principal fa√ßade in the Ionic order above a rustic ground floor. Statues of illustrious members of the Montmorency family decorate the roof. However, the depletion of the Montmorency fortune meant that Ledoux was required to execute the project with some parsimony. Ledoux was interested in the work of the Royal Administrations Department and at times considered working for them, even though the positions they offered were often on the borderline between architect and engineer. Through this interest in civic and municipal architecture and due, in no small part, to the notorious influence of Madame du Barry, Ledoux was commissioned with the modernization of the Salines de l'Est (Eastern Saltworks). The modernization was initiated following the construction of the Burgundy Canal. In 1771 Ledoux was promoted to Inspector of the saltworks in Franche-Comt√©, a title he held until 1790, with the position yielding him an annual salary of 6000 livres. =The Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans (1775‚Äì1778)= Plan view of the facilities In the 18th century salt was an essential and valuable commodity. The unpopular salt tax, known as the gabelle, was collected by the Ferme G√©n√©rale. Salt served as a valuable source of income for the French king. In Franche-Comt√©, due to subterranean seams of halite, salt was extracted from saline wells by vaporizing in wood-fuelled furnaces. In Salins- les-Bains or in Montmorot, the saltworks' boilers were built close to the wells, and the wood was brought from the adjacent forests. Contrary to what the French government wanted, Ledoux placed the saltworks near the woods as opposed to the source of the salt water. He logically reasoned that it would be easier to transport water than wood. Close to the first of these sites, the Fermiers G√©n√©raux decided to explore a more mechanized and efficient method of extraction, by constructing a purpose-built factory near the forest of Chaux, in the Val d'Amour. The saline water was to be brought to the factory by a newly constructed canal. The design, which received royal approval, of the Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans, or Salines de Chaux, is considered Ledoux's masterpiece. The initial building work was conceived as the first phase of a large and grandiose scheme for a new ideal city. The first (and, as things were to turn out, only) stage of building was constructed between 1775 and 1778. Entrance is through a massive Doric portico, inspired by the temples at Paestum.Ledoux is not known to have travelled to Italy; Giambattista Piranesi had recently published engravings of the temples at Paestum, which effectively brought them into the European architectural repertory. The alliance of the columns is an archetypal motif of neoclassicism. Inside, a cavernous hall gives the impression of entering an actual salt mine, decorated with concrete ornamentation representing the elementary forces of nature and the organizing genius of Man, a reflection of the views of the relationship between civilization and nature endorsed by such eighteenth-century philosophers as Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans: House of the director The entrance building opens into a vast semicircular open air space that is surrounded by ten buildings, which are arranged on the arc of a semicircle. On the arc is the cooper's forge, the forging mill and two bothies for the workers. On the straight diameter are the workshops for the extraction of salt alternating with administrative buildings. At the centre is the house of the director (illustrated), which originally also contained a chapel. The significance of this plan is twofold: the circle, a perfect figure, evokes the harmony of the ideal city and theoretically encloses a place of harmony for common work, but it recalls also contemporary theories of organization and of official surveillance, particularly the Panopticon of Jeremy Bentham. The saltworks entered a painful phase of industrial production and marginal profit, because of competition with the salt-water marshes. After some not very profitable trials, it closed indefinitely in 1790 during the national instability caused by the French Revolution. Thus the dream of success for a factory, conceived at the same time as a royal residence and a new city, ended. For a brief period in the 1920s the salt works were reused but eventually closed due to competition. For the following decades, the salt works lay in decay until they were named a UNESCO world heritage site and refurbished as a local cultural center. =The theatre of Besan√ßon= Th√©√¢tre de Besan√ßon, 1784 In 1784 Ledoux was the architect selected to design a theatre at Besan√ßon, Franche-Comt√©. The exterior of the building was designed as a severe Palladian cube, adorned only by an almost Grecian neoclassical portico of six Ionic columns. However, if the neoclassical hints to the exterior was regarded as modern then the interior was a revolution ‚Äì venues for public entertainment were rare in the French provinces, and where they did exist it was traditional that only the nobles had seating, while those of less exulted rank had stood. Ledoux, realizing this was not only inconvenient but elitist planned the theatre at Besan√ßon on more egalitarian lines with seating for all but in some quarters such a plan was seen as radical if not revolutionary, the aristocracy had no wish to be seated alongside commoners. However Ledoux found an ally in the Intendant of Franche-Comt√©, Charles Andr√© de la Cor√©, an enlightened man, he consented to follow this reforming plan. Even so, it was decided that the social classes would still be segregated thus while the theatre of was the first to have a ground floor amphitheatre furnished with seats for the ordinary paying public. Above them was a raised terrace or balcony for state employers. Directly above was the first tier of boxes reserved for the aristocracy, and above this a tier of smaller boxes occupied by the middle-class the second. Thus Ledoux achieved his ambition that the theatre could at the same time be a place of social communion and shared entertainment while still maintaining a strict hierarchy of the classes. The seating was not the only innovation at the theatre. With the aid of the machinist Dart de Bosco a student of Giovanni Niccol√≤ Servandoni Ledoux expanded the wings and back stage scenery apparatus, giving it greater depth than was customary, and many other modern improvements. Besan√ßon was the first theatre to screen the musicians in an orchestra pit. The building was widely acclaimed on its opening in 1784 but when Ledoux submitted plans for the proposed new theatre in Marseilles but they were not accepted. In 1784, Ledoux was chosen over Pierre-Adrien P√¢ris for the construction of the new town hall in Neufch√¢tel. This was followed by the spectacular project that he conceived for the Palais de Justice and the prison of Aix-en-Provence. This project, however, was to be beset by many difficulties. Trouble began in 1789 when construction was interrupted by the French Revolution, when only the ground floor walls had been completed The current Palais de Justice was built under the Bourbon Restoration by the architect Penchaud on the substructures of the building by Ledoux. =Domestic and commercial architecture= Ledoux was a FreemasonIt is thought that he belonged to the Rosicrucian Order, either in Philal√®thes or √âveill√©s. Ledoux took part, with his friend William Beckford, in various masonic ceremonies at the Loge F√©minine de la Candeur which met in the town house he had built for Mme d'Espinchal, on the Rue des Petites- √âcuries. He was well acquitted with the world of finance and those who inhabited it. He designed a large house and park for Praudeau de Chemilly, the treasurer of the Mar√©chauss√©es, at Bourneville near Fert√©-Milon. One of his more notable town houses was for the widow of the Genevan banker Th√©lusson.a former associate of Jacques Necker This classical mansion, a venue for Parisian high society, was situated at the heart of a large landscaped garden accessed from the Rue de Provence. The house had an immense porte-cochere in the form of a pillared triumphal arch. The circular central salon, had at its centre a colonnade which supported the ceiling. On the Rue Saint-Georges, for the creole Hosten, Ledoux designed an ensemble of tenements for rental, designed in such a way they could in future be extended ad infinitum. In the Rue Saint-Lazare, around a commercial warehouse, he designed the gardens of Zephyr and Flora, which were illustrated by Hubert Robert. =Architecture for the ferme g√©n√©rale= Rotonde de la Villette at Place de Stalingrad, old station of the Wall of the Farmers-General Rotonde de Chartres (today: entrance to the Monceau park) In the process of his work in Franche-Comt√©, Ledoux had become an architect for the ferme g√©n√©rale, for whom he built a salt storehouse in Compi√®gne and undertook to plan their vast headquarters on the rue du Bouloi in Paris. Charles Alexandre de Calonne, the Controller- General of Finances, obtained on an idea from the chemist and fermier g√©n√©ral Antoine Lavoisier, of drawing a barrier around Paris to limit contraband and evasion of the octrois, or internal customs duties: this notorious Wall of the Farmers-General was to have six towers (one every 4 kilometers) and to comprise sixty tax-collecting offices. Ledoux was charged to design these buildings, which he baptized pompously \\"les Propyl√©es de Paris\\"From the Greek propylaeum, a monumental gateway to a sacred enclosure and to which he wanted to give a character of solemnity and magnificence while putting into practice his ideas on the necessary links between form and function. To cut short the protests of the Parisian population, the operation was carried out rapidly: fifty barriers to access were built between 1785 and 1788. Most were destroyed in the nineteenth century and very few remain today,Place Denfert-Rochereau, Place de la Nation, Parc Monceau and at the edge of the basin of La Villette. of which those of La Villette and Place Denfert-Rochereau are the only ones that haven't been altered beyond recognition. In certain cases, the entry was framed with two identical buildings; in others, it consisted of a single building. The forms were archetypal: the rotunda (Heap, Reuilly); the rotunda surmounting a Greek cross (La Villette, Rap√©e); the cube with peristyle (Picpus); the Greek temple (Gentilly, Courcelles); the column (le Tr√¥ne). At Place de l'√âtoile, the buildings, flanked with columns alternating with cubic and cylindrical elements, evoked the House of the director at Arc-and-Senans; at the Bureau des Bonshommes, an apse opened by a peristyle recalled the pavilion of Madame du Barry and the H√¥tel de la Guimard. The order employed was generally Doric Greek. Ledoux also used multiple rustic embossings. This audacious construction met with political criticism,Pierre Beaumarchais, who saw it as one of the causes of the Revolution, responded with his famous alexandrine \\"Le mur murant Paris, rend Paris murmurant\\" (\\"The wall walling Paris renders Paris grumbling.\\") as well as aesthetic criticism of the architect, accused by commentators such as Dulaure and Quatrem√®re de Quincy of taking excessive freedoms with the ancient canons. Bachaumont denounced a \\"monument d'esclavage et de despotisme\\" (a \\"monument to enslavement and despotism\\").M√©moires secrets, October 1785. In his Tableau de Paris (1783), Louis-S√©bastien Mercier stigmatised \\"les antres du fisc m√©tamorphos√©s en palais √† colonnes\\" (\\"the bastions of taxation metamorphosed into columned palaces\\"), and exclamed, \\"Ah! Monsieur Ledoux, vous √™tes un terrible architecte!\\"(Ah! Monsieur Ledoux, you are a terrible architect).Louis- S√©bastien Mercier (1783). Tableau de Paris, nouvelle √©dition, vol. 9, p. 361. Ledoux, rendered the object of scandal by these opinions, was relieved of his official functions in 1787 while Jacques Necker, succeeding Calonne, disavowed the entire enterprise. =Difficult times= Portrait of Ledoux with his daughter. 1782 - Mus√©e Carnavalet. At the same time, work on the law courts of Aix-en-Provence was suspended, and Ledoux was accused of embroiling the Treasury in ill-considered expenditure. When the Revolution broke out, his rich clientele emigrated or perished under the guillotine. He saw his career and his projects stopped while at the same time the first blows of the pickaxe began to ring on the already obsolete wall of the fermiers g√©n√©raux. As of June 1790, the Ferme g√©n√©rale had been able to install its employees in the buildings by Ledoux, but the octroi (granting) was abolished in May 1791, which rendered the facilities useless. A symbol of fiscal oppression, Ledoux, who had amassed a handsome fortune, was arrested and thrown in La Force Prison. He still made a project for a school of agriculture for the duc de Duras, his companion in captivity. Perhaps the intervention of the painter Jacques-Louis David, son-in-law of the entrepreneur P√©coul, and considerably enriched in the collection of the octrois, helped him avoid the guillotine. But he lost his favourite daughter whilst the other brought a lawsuit against him. Ledoux, who was eventually released, ceased building and attempted to prepare the publication of his complete ≈ìuvre. Since 1773, he had started to engrave his constructions and his projects but, because of the evolution of his style, he did not cease retouching his drawings, and the engravers constantly had to redo their boards. Ledoux evolved towards an architecture always more detailed and colossal, with vast walls that were increasingly smooth, and with increasingly rare openings. The differences between a drawing of the Pavillon de Louveciennes as it first was, made by the British architect Sir William Chambers and the engraving that was published in 1804 illustrate this process. During his imprisonment, Ledoux had started to write a text to accompany the engravings. Only the first volume appeared during his lifetime, in 1804, under the title L'Architecture consid√©r√©e sous le rapport de l'art, des m≈ìurs et de la l√©gislation(Architecture considered under the relation of art and legislation). It presented the theatre of Besan√ßon, the saltworks of Arc-and-Senans and the town of Chaux. He died in Paris in 1806. =Utopianism= Around the time of the royal saltworks, Ledoux formalized his innovative design ideas for an urbanism and an architecture intended to improve society, of a Cit√© id√©ale charged with symbols and meanings. Along with √âtienne-Louis Boull√©e and his project for the Cenotaph of Newton, he is considered a precursor to the utopians who would follow.Some examples of this continuation into the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries: the Phalanst√®re of Charles Fourier, and the Familist√®re de Guise of Jean- Baptiste Andr√© Godin. Boull√©e and Ledoux were a specific influence on subsequent Greek Revival architects and especially Benjamin Henry Latrobe who carried through the style in the United States for public architecture with the intention that the spirit of the ancient Athenian democracy would be echoed by buildings serving the new democracy of the United States of America. After 1775 he presented Turgot with the first sketches of the town of Chaux, centered on the royal saltworks. The project, constantly perfected but never executed, was engraved beginning in 1780.Gallet 1982, pp. 652‚Äì653. The engravings, announced in 1784 and probably all designed by 1799, were finally published in 1804, as part of the first edition of his L'Architecture consider√©e.Vidler 1996, p. 57. As a radical utopian of architecture, teaching at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, he created a singular architectonic order, a new column formed of alternating cylindrical and cubic stones superimposed for their plastic effect. In this period, taste was returning to the antique, to the distinction and the examination, of the taste for the \\"rustic\\" style.

Retrieved November 2, 2006. At the time, Seattle was a settlement in the Washington Territory that had recently named itself after Chief Seattle (Sealth), a leader of the Suquamish and Duwamish peoples of central Puget Sound.T. S. Phelps: Reminiscences of Seattle: Washington Territory and the U. S. Sloop-of-War Decatur During the Indian War of 1855-56. Originally published by The Alice Harriman Company, Seattle, 1908. Accessed online November 2, 2006 on the site of the U.S. Department of the Navy. European-American settlers were backed by artillery fire and supported by Marines from the United States Navy sloop-of-war Decatur, anchored in Elliott Bay (Seattle's harbor, then called Duwam-sh Bay). They suffered two fatalities. It is not known if any of the Native American raiders died. The contemporary historian T. S. Phelps wrote that they later \\"would admit\\" to 28 dead and 80 wounded. The battle, part of the multi-year Puget Sound War or Yakima Wars (1855-1858), lasted a single day. Terrain Memorial plaque for the blockhouse fort formerly located at Cherry Street The Seattle settlement of the time was located roughly in the area of Seattle's Pioneer Square and its neighborhood. T. S. Phelps's memoir of the time described the settlement as: > ‚Ä¶on a point, or rather a small peninsula, projecting from the eastern shore, > and about two miles (3 km) from the mouth of Duwam-sh River, debouching at > the head of the bay. The northern part of this peninsula is connected with > the mainland by a low neck of marshy ground, and about one-sixteenth of a > mile from its southeastern extremity a firm, hard sand-pit nearly joined it > to the adjacent shore, severed only by a narrow channel through which the > surplus waters of an inclosed swamp escaped into the bay. The south and west > sides rose abruptly from the beach, forming an embankment from three to > fifteen feet high; and proceeding thence northerly, the ground undulated for > an eighth of a mile, when it gradually sloped towards the swamp and neck. > At the intersection of the latter with the main, and overlooking the water, > rose a mound about thirty feet above the level of the bay; and to the > eastward through a depression in the hills, and passing the head of the > swamp, was a broad Indian trail leading to Lake Duwam-sh [now Lake > Washington], distant two and a half miles. Phelps remarks that the tailings from Henry Yesler's recently erected mill were steadily filling in the marshy land at the north of the head or peninsula where the settlement was located. He described the arrangement of the troops arrayed in defense on the nights before the battle: > The divisions‚Ä¶ nightly occupied the shore, vigilantly guarding the people as > they slept, and resting only when the morning light released them from the > apprehended attack. ‚Ä¶ [They] were distributed along the line of defense in > the following order: The fourth, under Lieutenant Dallas, commencing at > Southeast Point, extended along the bay shore to the sand-bar, where, > meeting with the right of the first division, Lieutenant Drake, the latter > continued the line facing the swamp to a point half-way from the bar to a > hotel situated midway between the bar and Yesler's place, and there joined > the second, under Lieutenant Hughes, whose left, resting on the hotel (see > Mother Damnable), completed an unbroken line between the latter and > Southeast Point, while the howitzer's crew, Lieutenant Morris, was stationed > near Plummer's house, to sweep the bar and to operate wherever circumstances > demanded. The third division, Lieutenant Phelps, occupied that portion of > the neck lying between the swamp and mound east of Yesler's place, to secure > the approaches leading from the lake, and the marines, under Sergeant > Carbine, garrisoned the block-house. > The divisions, thus stationed, left a gap between the second and third, > which the width and impassable nature of the swamp at this place rendered > unnecessary to close, thereby enabling a portion of the town to be > encompassed which otherwise would have been exposed. > The distance between the block-house and Southeast Point, following the > sinuosities of the bay and swamp shores, was three-quarters of a mile, to be > defended by ninety-six men, eighteen marines, and five officers, leaving > Gunner Stocking, Carpenter Miller, Clerks Francis and Ferguson, and fifteen > men with Lieutenant Middleton, to guard the ship. Prelude Washington Territory Governor Isaac Ingalls Stevens' ambitious treaty-making during 1854 and 1855 has been held to be the cause of the Puget Sound War. The battle was part of a Native American uprising in resistance to the pressure to cede land for reservations determined by territorial officials. There had been a series of skirmishes in the region over the previous several months, beginning October 28, 1855. There had been fighting between federal troops and natives in southern King, Thurston and Pierce counties. Five days before the attack on Seattle, Governor Stevens had declared a \\"war of extermination\\" upon the Indians. The sloop Decatur had been called to Puget Sound both because of the trouble with local natives and to deter frequent raids by an alliance of the northern Haida from the Queen Charlotte Islands and the Tongass group of the Tlingit, from what was then Russian America. Captained by Isaac L. Sterret, the vessel struck an uncharted reef near Bainbridge Island on December 7, 1855, and was heavily damaged. (According to naval custom, the reef was named Decatur Reef.) They limped into Seattle for repairs, which lasted until January 19. Sterret was temporarily taken off active duty December 10, although later returned to active duty. However, on the day of the battle, Decatur was commanded by Guert Gansevoort. Decatur lay at anchor in deep water, in a position from which it had total command of the settlement with 16 shipborne 32-pounders firing fuzed shells. To the defense on land, the ship contributed two nine-pounder cannon and 18 stands of arms. About this time, the raiders were attacking the White River settlers to the southeast. Survivors fled to Seattle. There they joined the fifty or so Seattle settlers. Assisted by marines from the Decatur, they had constructed a blockhouse from lumber originally intended for shipment to San Francisco. Days before the battle (January 21), Territorial Governor Stevens arrived in Seattle aboard U.S.S. Active, and discounted rumors of war. Almost immediately upon his departure, reports from friendly natives warned that the governor had been completely mistaken and that an attack was imminent. These reports have been variously credited to Chief Seattle, his daughter Princess Angeline, or another chief, Sucquardle (known also as \\"Curley\\" or \\"Curly Jim\\"). David Swinson \\"Doc\\" Maynard, reputed to have had far more than the usual concern for the natives' rights and well-being, evacuated 434 friendly natives to the west side of Puget Sound (at his own expense and with the assistance of his wife).For Maynard's reputation, see Bill Speidel, Doc Maynard, The Man Who Invented Seattle (Seattle: Nettle Creek Publishing Co., 1978) (), a biography of Maynard. To some extent, the settlers had organized for their defense as volunteers under a Captain Hewett. However, this company of volunteers had disbanded and re-formed several times over the months leading up to the battle. On the evening of January 22, with Decatur having taken a commanding position, the militia leaders declared that \\"they would not serve longer while there was a ship in port to protect them\\". Phelps writes that \\"a more reckless, undisciplined set of men has seldom been let loose to prey upon any community than these eighty embryo soldiers upon Seattle‚Ä¶ after much rough argument about thirty of their number became partially convinced that their individual safety depended upon unity of action under a competent leader, and they finally consented to form a company, provided Mr. Peixotto would consent to serve as captain. That gentleman accepted the honor‚Ä¶\\" Emily Denny mentions the company as being captained by Hewitt and including William Gilliam as 1st Lieutenant, D.T. Denny as Corporal, and Robert Olliver as Sergeant. Phelps names both Hewitt and Peixotto as captains. Phelps lists the hostile natives as including the \\"Kliktat\\" (Klickitat and Spokane), \\"Palouse\\" (Palus), Walla-Walla, \\"Yakami\\" (Yakama), Kamialk, Nisqually, Puyallup, \\"Lake\\" (Duwamish-related, living near Lake Washington), \\"and other tribes, estimated at six thousand warriors, marshaled under the three generals-in-chief Coquilton, Owhi, and Lushi, assisted by many subordinate chiefs.\\" They had failed to recruit warriors from any of the several tribes or nations from the Olympic Peninsula, nor did they succeed in winning the Snoqualmie over to their cause. Although the Snoqualmie chief PatkanimPhelps refers to him as \\"Pat Kanim\\". was strongly opposed to the European-American settlers, he allied with them in this war. Portrait of Chief Leschi Portrait of Chief Owhi Two hostile chiefs‚ÄîPhelps says Owhi and Lushi (presumably, Leschi), other sources say Owhi and Coquilton‚Äîdisguised themselves as friendly Indians and reconnoitered the situation the night before the battle. Phelps describes this in some detail: he was the sentry whom they tricked with a plausible story. According to Phelps' account, at least two native chiefs were playing a double game. Curley Jim had been considered friendly enough by the settlers to be allowed to remain within their encampment; conversely, his nephew Yark-eke-e- man had been considered one of the hostile force. According to Phelps, the nephew intended to betray the native attack. Curley Jim left the settlement in the company of his visitors, and they parleyed around midnight at the lodge of a chief named Tecumseh; Yark-eke-e-man and several \\"chiefs of lesser note\\" were also present. They set out a plan to kill all of the settlers and U.S. military; Curley requested that his friend Henry Yesler be allowed to live, but accepted being overruled in the matter. They resolved to attack in a few hours, around 2 a.m.; Phelps wrote that that plan would have succeeded, since no defender was planning for a pre-dawn assault. But Yark-eke-e-man convinced the raiders to try a mid-morning attack, using a small decoy force to draw the Decatur's men out of the well-defended areas to do battle on First Hill. There are no reliable estimates of the size of the attacking force. Isaac Stevens (who was not present), wrote to Washington that settlers estimated that 200 to 500 Indians had taken the field against them. Phelps put the number of enemy at 2,000, but (write Crowley and Wilma) \\"frontier military officers often inflated the number of opposing forces to reinforce their accomplishments (or to minimize their failures).\\" Community college historian Murray Morgan writes that early \\"reports seem to have multiplied by ten the actual numbers. There could not have been more than one hundred and fifty.\\" Many settlers resided on scattered claims divided by thick forest, because to establish a land claim, settlers had to live on it.* Some settlers doubted that the Indians would attack, and had to run for the blockhouse on the morning of the battle. The first fatality of the engagement was Jack Drew, a deserter from Decatur killed in friendly fire. When he attempted to enter a cabin through a window, he was shot dead by fifteen-year-old Milton Holgate. Battle \\"Battle of Seattle\\", Emily Inez Denny Because the natives' only common language was Chinook jargon, a trade language that many of the white settlers also spoke, the settlers were able to hear and understand the attackers' shouted orders \\"and revealed many incidents of the battle they were anxious to conceal.\\" An Indian known as \\"Jim\\", a relative of Curley's who died a few months later in a hunting accident, evaded Curley's vigilance and warned Dr. Williamson of the impending attack. Williamson sent a messenger to Yesler, who informed Gansevoort, and Decatur's troops abandoned their breakfast and returned to the positions they had held by night. 52 women and children found refuge on board Decatur, and others on board the barque Brontes. The non-combatants of the friendly tribes took to their canoes to get out of the way. Curley's sister (and Yark-eke-e- man's mother) Li-cu-mu-low (\\"Nancy\\"), whom Phelps describes as \\"short, stout, and incapable of running,\\" warned as she headed for her canoe that the Kliktat were gathered around Tom Pepper's house, which was in the forest, near the crest of First Hill. Decatur fired off a howitzer shell in that direction, the first shot of the battle. Phelps and a few others had been trying unsuccessfully to rouse the volunteers from their torpor. At the sound of the howitzer shell, they rushed as one for the blockhouse. There \\"Sergeant Carbine several times charged them out of one door, to return as often by the other, till, wearying of the trouble, he left them to cower behind the wooden bulwarks, protected from the bullets of the foe.\\" The third division, contrary to orders, charged up the trail that led towards the lake. This charge met with success, as they pushed the attackers back without taking any casualties themselves. Klakum held a position behind a tree, and shot at Peixotto standing on the block-house steps, but missed and killed a boy, Milton G. Holgate, who was standing a few steps higher. It was the second death of a European American caused by another white. On the south end, settlers on the peninsula faced off against natives on the mainland with a slough dividing them. Phelps describes \\"the incessant rattle of small-arms, and an uninterrupted whistling of bullets, mingled with the furious yells of the Indians,\\" but there were few casualties. A settler was killed when he ducked from behind a stump to get some drinking water; Clarence Bagley, quoting William Bell two days after the event, says the casualty was Christian White; Phelps, writing 17 years later, says it was Robert Wilson. Hans Carl, an invalided sailor on Decatur, died shortly thereafter, but for reasons unrelated to the battle. Aftermath Blockhouse fort survivors Ira Woodin, Carson D. Boren, and Walter Graham (for whom the Graham Hill area is named) in a 1905 photograph by Theodore E. Peiser Unveiling on November 13, 1905 of a memorial tablet at the site of the former blockhouse fort on 1st Avenue and Cherry Street News of the attack spread rapidly. By 4 p.m. it was known in Bellingham. At noon the day after the battle, Active steamed into Elliott Bay, Governor Stevens aboard. Stevens was, in Phelps's words, \\"at last compelled to acknowledge the presence of hostile Indians in the Territory.\\" Active headed south in the direction of Steilacoom, which seemed the most likely next target of an attack, dropping the governor at Olympia, the capital, on the way. Yark- eke-e-man reported that the hostile chiefs were ill-provisioned. Confident of victory, they expected to provision themselves from the settlers' supplies. They spent the next several weeks scouring the land for food. Two days after the battle, Coquilton threatened, through a messenger, \\"that within one moon he would return with twenty thousand warriors, and, attacking by land and water, destroy the place in spite of all the war-ship could do to prevent.\\" The threat was taken seriously, and leaders decided to improve Seattle's defenses. Henry Yesler volunteered ship's cargo of house lumber, and on February 1 Decatur's divisions began a two-week project to erect a defensive palisade: two fences five feet high, placed eighteen inches apart, and filled in with well-tamped earth, long, and enclosing a large portion of the town. A second block-house was also erected, and an old ship's cannon, plus a 6-pounder field-piece borrowed from Active, were to serve as its artillery. Trees and undergrowth were removed (variously attacked with levers, axes, and shovels, or burned in place) to provide an esplanade and enable Decatur's howitzer to sweep the shores. Much brush was also cleared from the town's inland edges, to reduce the cover for future attacks. On February 24, USS Massachusetts arrived and on March 28 USS John Hancock. The fortified town did not have to face a second battle. Defeat in the Battle of Seattle had discouraged the hostile natives, and they did not again amass a comparable force. Furthermore, Governor Stevens had convinced Patkanim and his men to take on the role of bounty hunters, paying them handsomely for collecting the scalps of leaders of the hostile tribes. Morgan does not describe the battle as a victory for the Americans. Rather, he writes that \\"both sides were dismayed, the whites by the realization that the enemy really would attack a town, the Indians by their first experience with exploding shells rather than cannonballs.\\" Also by Stevens's order, a court-martial was convened at Seattle on May 15 for the trial of Klakum and twenty other Indians. The military officers acquitted them, deeming their actions as having been legitimate warfare against recognized combatants, not criminal acts. They were released after a declaration of peace. It was certainly not the end of violence between settlers and natives in the region, but it was the end of outright war. Nine days after the battle, Chief Leschi and Chief Kitsap, along with a group of 17 Indians, appeared at the home of John McLeod near the Nisqually River. McLeod was a former employee of the Hudson's Bay Company, had a Nisqually wife, and was trusted by the hostile Indians. Leschi said that neither he nor his band had taken part in the attack on Seattle, and he thought the attack had been foolish. Leschi asked for John Swan, another trusted white man, to visit Leschi's camp on the Green River for a peace conference. When Swan did visit Leschi's camp a few days later, he counted about 150 warriors, or men of fighting age. Nearly all were from west of the Cascades, with only 10‚Äì20 from the east. Casualties Jack Drew, a deserter from the Decatur, was shot and killed by young Milton Holgate, a settler's son, when he tried to enter the latter's cabin. Holgate was killed by friendly fire, and another settler died in the battle: Christian White or Robert Wilson (see above). One sailor, Hans Carl, died later of causes unrelated to the battle. Phelps characterizes the low casualties as \\"incredible\\" and \\"miraculous\\", given that \\"one hundred and sixty men were for seven hours exposed to an almost uninterrupted storm of bullets\\". The casualties on the native side are unknown. Phelps claimed personally to have seen ten men die from one shell. He said that the natives later admitted to 28 dead and 80 wounded, but said that the native women \\"secret[ed] the dead beyond all chance of discovery.\\" No Indian bodies were found on the battlefield. According to Seattle lore, decades after the battle, Seattle's future fire chief Gardner Kellogg was excavating his house and found a shell from Decatur that had buried itself without exploding. He stuck it under a stump that he was trying to burn out and went off to lunch. Dexter Horton stopped by to warm the seat of his pants at the fire, and as it exploded, nearly became the last casualty of the battle of Seattle.

It is one of the oldest schools in South Africa. Historical perspective =School history= With the Transvaal under British control, Lord Milner, the Colonial Secretary at the time created educational facilities (known as the Milner Schools) for English-speaking pupils. The site for the school had been an infamous concentration camp during the 2nd South African War. The first school on the land was for the children interned in the camp. On 31 January 1905, accompanied by the band of the Border Regiment, Sir Richard Solomon, Lt-Governor of Transvaal opened Potchefstroom College upon instruction from the then Education Department, the school was renamed Potchefstroom High School for Boys. \\"College\\" is a boarding school based on the English boarding schools system. Founded by C.D. Hope (who was also the first principal of Pretoria Boys High School as well as Jeppe High School for Boys), the original structure had been built long before and had to close during the Anglo-Boer war. The school-building itself was designed in Cape Dutch architecture design as was prominent in style during those times which has since been declared a local heritage site. There are 3 boarding houses: Granton (Oxford Blue) (1909), Milton (Cambridge Blue) (1910) and Buxton (British Racing Green), which was constructed much later. The fourth house, Barnard (Royal Red) is the 'Day-Boy' house. These later buildings did not follow the traditional Cape Dutch styles and were built more suited to the period they were built in. The school's motto, Iustorum Semita Lux Splendens (Latin), was adapted by the founder C.D. Hope, from Proverbs 4:18, and means \\"The path of righteousness (alternately: the just) is (as) a shining light.\\" During the 1905 hunting season, just before the first Springbok team went on their rugby tour, the headmaster C.D. Hope was given the horns of a springbok by his brother-in-law. These horns, mounted, are in the school‚Äôs museum and a springbok head forms part of the school‚Äôs badge. =Past headmasters=   * Schooling =Academics= =Sports= The school has a reputation for being very sports-orientated as every student is required to participate in at least one sport during each sport's season. Since the schools inception \\"Boys High\\" has produced many internationally recognized sportsmen. A wide variety of sports are offered at the school of which the more popular ones include: rugby, hockey, cricket, tennis and swimming. Beyond this, each student is then required to do athletics at inter-house level. Apart from the local schools Potchefstroom Boys' traditional sporting rivals include Pretoria Boys‚Äô High, King Edwards, Jeppe Boys, Parktown Boys and St Stithians each year. =Cultural= The school's cultural activities are run with the school's teaching staff in collaboration with the students, activities such as plays and public speaking occur regularly. Alumni =Old Boys Society= The school's alumni is formed of old school members who join the school's Old Boys Society.Potchefstroom College Old Boys Society This is often referred to as Old Mooi because of the schools close proximity to the Mooi River which bisects the town of Potchefstroom. Among other tasks, the society is responsible for the over-seeing of the school and helps with the SGB (Student Governing Body). The society is also responsible for meetings and student reunions. =Notable alumni= * Paul Sinton-Hewitt CBE, Parkrun founder * Keagan Dolly, South African International Footballer * Hezeki√©l Sepeng,Olympic athlete * Sean Santana, South African Commonwealth boxer * Warren Carne, Zimbabwe cyclist * Sifiso Nhlapo, Beijing Olympic BMX cyclist * William Diering, Beijing Olympic swimmer * Edward Baker-Duly, West End & Downton Abbey actor * Douglas Gibson, Democratic Alliance former chief whip and South African Ambassador to Thailand * Vivian Neser, South Africa & Oxford University cricketer Vivian Neser * Gary Outram, Vusumuzi Mazibuko, Johannes Diseko, Keith Storey: First Class CricketRichard Stroh * Eddie Leie, South African T20I Cricketer * Gavin Ewing, Zimbabwe cricketer * Nathan Kirsh, Philanthropist and Forbes Billionaire * Robby De Sa, musician * Edward McGill Alexander, Brigadier General SANDF (Rtd) * Katlego Moswane Maboe, South African TV presenter, singer-songwriter and accountant.

Description At around 55 million years old, remains of Kambara are among the oldest Tertiary fossils found in Australia (although there are some recent Cretaceous fossils that are twice that age). Kambara is the oldest known mekosuchine. The genus name comes from an Aboriginal term meaning \\"crocodile\\". There are currently four species of Kambara described: the type species K. murgonensis (Willis & Molnar, 1993), K. implexidens (Salisbury & Willis, 1996), K. molnari (Holt et al., 2005), and K. taraina (Buchanan, 2009). All four species have a generalised crocodylian body plan, growing to sizes similar to the modern Saltwater Crocodile, Crocodylus porosus. Kambara shows an interesting characteristic of having multiple bite patterns within the same genus. Kambara murgonensis has a near complete overbite, K. implexidens a more interlocking dentition and K. molnarai an intermediate condition. While initially thought to be the most primitive member of an Australasian radiation of mekosuchine crocodylians, recent studies (Holt, et al., 2007) have suggested that this may not be the case, and that there are at least two separate lineages in Australia. Kambara and other mekosuchines are often thought to have been better adapted to movement on land than are living crocodilians. The degree of twisting or torsion in the humerus of Kambara is less than that of living crocodilians, and the shoulder joint of Kambara is stronger and allows for greater motion than those of modern species. However, Kambara is still thought to have been at least partially aquatic because its head is flattened like that of typical aquatic crocodilians. Fossils have been found at the Murgon fossil site in south- eastern Queensland. References * Buchanan, L.A. 2009. \\"Kambara taraina sp. nov.
