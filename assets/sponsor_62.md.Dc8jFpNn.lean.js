Founding The Luganda Society was established in 1950 through the efforts of Michael B. Nsimbi, known as ‚ÄúThe Father of Ganda literature.‚Äù Observing the detrimental effects of colonialism on Uganda society and culture, and the neglect and loss of local customs, language and culture, Nsimbi joined with other likeminded nationals to form the society, with the key goals of preserving, popularising and promoting the use of Luganda to both Baganda and non-Baganda. Society Aims Since its establishment the specific aims of the Society have been: * To promote proper use of the Luganda language and popularize Luganda literature * To promote proper Luganda orthography among both Baganda and non- Baganda * To promote research about Luganda words and idioms * To encourage translation of foreign language literature into Luganda * To organize Luganda language courses and competitions in schools * To organize festivals highlighting the local language and culture through music and drama Achievements The Luganda Society became a catalyst for inspiring and resourcing a number of writers in the Luganda language, including Solomon Mpalanyi, Phoebe Mukasa, Hugo Ssematimba, C. Kalinda, Dr. Livingstone Walusimbi and Michael B. Nsimbi himself. In 1958 the society began a regular program on Radio Uganda to promote teaching and learning of Luganda and various aspects of Buganda's culture, and organise on-air Luganda language competitions. In 1959 the society began organising competitions in schools, and in 1965 began offering scholarships to the best students in Luganda, known today as the Dr. Nsimbi Scholarship Scheme. In 1963 the society organized the first Pageant of Uganda, a cultural festival held at Uganda's National Theater in Kampala, highlighting Uganda's many cultures. The Society eventually gained government recognition for their cause, and from the 1970s worked together to produce a Luganda language curriculum at Makerere University, the country‚Äôs only university at the time, in 1976. Nsimbi and fellow Society member Dr. Livingstone Walusimbi were instrumental in this process, which also saw the creation of a high school curriculum in 1979, and a curriculum for the National Teachers' Colleges in 1984. The Society also worked to establish the Luganda Teachers Association in 1988, and a curriculum for Teacher Training Colleges in 1994.

Illusions of a Borderless World is a 2006 book by Jack Goldsmith and Tim Wu that offers an assessment of the struggle to control the Internet.Who Controls the Internet? Illusions of a Borderless World, Jack Goldsmith and Tim Wu, Oxford University Press, 17 March 2006, 238 pp., Starting with a discussion of the early vision of a borderless global community, the authors present some of the most prominent individuals, ideas and movements that have played key roles in developing the Internet. As law professors at Harvard and Columbia, respectively, Goldsmith and Wu assert the important role of government in maintaining Internet law and order while debunking the claims of techno-utopianism that have been espoused by theorists such as Thomas Friedman. Goldsmith and Wu conclude that the importance of governmental coercion on the Internet has been seriously underestimated, writing that \\"the failure to understand the many faces and facets of territorial governmental coercion is fatal to globalization theory as understood today, and central to understanding the future of the Internet\\" (184). Overview The book has three parts. =Part One: The Internet Revolution= The authors discuss the early days of the Internet through the 1990s, when Julian Dibbell and John Perry Barlow articulated a vision of free Internet that gained wide currency in the public imagination. The Electronic Frontier Foundation worked to protect the Internet from regulation in the belief that a free online community might unite people and eliminate the need for government. Jon Postel was the ultimate authority over Internet domain names. Jon Postel Goldsmith and Wu describe key changes in control over the Internet that occurred in the 1990s, beginning with consolidation of power by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) in the 1990s. A DoD subcontractor called Network Solutions, Inc., became the ultimate authority over Internet naming conventions in 1991. Although Postel remained functionally in control for a few more years, \\"the transfer of partial authority to Network Solutions was a crucial turning point in Internet history. For the first time, administration of part of the Internet's naming system would be in the hands of a for-profit company\\" (35). In 1995, Network Solutions began charging individuals to register domain names. This brought the company, which had a monopoly on issuing domain names, large profits. When the International Ad Hoc Committee, set up by the Internet Society, released an \\"Internet Constitution\\" in 1997, they met with hostility from the U.S. government and were ultimately thwarted (41‚Äì43). Jon Postel met an even more direct response when he attempted to retake control over the root naming and numbering system in 1998. Hours after Postel asked eight regional operators for root control over the Internet, he received threats of legal and economic repercussions from federal agent Ira Magaziner. Network Solutions has retained final authority over Internet domain names ever since (44‚Äì46). =Part Two: Government Strikes Back= No longer an international phenomenon, the Internet has become quite different for its users in different countries. One reason for differentiation across nations is that users want information presented in their local language and context. Advertisers likewise to present information to interested audiences, which tend to be geographically specific (58‚Äì63). Internet users in China are unable to access many outside websites Goldsmith and Wu also describe how governments began to pressure or control local intermediaries in order to restrict Internet content. Examples include: * Yahoo's forced restrictions on the sale of Nazi paraphernalia in France (1‚Äì8) * Google de-listing Operation Clambake in response to a DMCA filing by the Church of Scientology (75) * Google de- listing websites devoted to hate speech and Nazi materials in France and Germany (75) * Saudi Arabia's direct filters, imposed on its ISPs, of websites containing pornography, gambling, interfaith dialogue, and discussions about how to circumvent filtering (74) * Elimination of online cigarette sales in the U.S. by threatening credit card companies that facilitated it (76) * Neutralization of websites through the seizure of domain names in the U.S. (78) * Direct arrest of individuals involved, e.g., in the case of child pornography in the U.S., U.K., and Canada; and in the case of antisemitism in Norway (79‚Äì80) * The neutralization of HavenCo due to pressure from government on businesses not to cooperate (84-85) HavenCo's growth was limited by economic sanctions from outside * Chinese censorship, including complete blocks on many websites from outside China (92‚Äì95), targeted and sometimes automated censorship of internal dissent (95‚Äì104), and direct arrests of dissidents who contribute to the Internet (87‚Äì92). The authors also describe the U.S. battle between the RIAA and file-sharing services such as Napster and Kazaa. They note the ironies of Kazaa's position: partly in defiance of U.S. law, but partly reliant on it to maintain order internally (117‚Äì118). Goldsmith and Wu describe the emergence of Apple's iTunes Store as a legal alternative, made preferable by government enforcement of laws against peer- to-peer file-sharing (118‚Äì121). They compare the small number of persistent underground file-sharers to groups of Chinese dissidents talking in obscure code, arguing that these groups do not pose a major threat to the interests of business and government: \\"Ironically, then the most rebellious filesharing programmers can become handmaidens of the government's will. What secretive darknets do is zone the music world, dividing music consumers on the basis of free time and computer ability\\" (123). =Part Three: Vice, Virtues, the Future= The authors present eBay as a case study in the usefulness of governments in protecting commerce. They describe how the eBay community, during its small beginning phase, relied on goodwill, public ratings, and mediation to navigate disputes among customers (130‚Äì132). As the site grew larger, so did the number of malicious users (132‚Äì136). Eventually the site was forced to turn to governments for real law enforcement (136‚Äì139). Now, eBay works closely with law enforcements systems in the countries where it operates (143‚Äì145). According to the authors, eBay, the case of an Australian libel lawsuit against a U.S. publisher (147‚Äì148), and Microsoft's acquiescence to European Union (EU) regulation of its Passport service (173‚Äì177) are examples of how the bordered Internet seeks to protect citizens from harm. They argue that as a communications medium, the Internet is not unlike other technologies that have come before and therefore the Internet is not likely to displace territorial government. Rather, it is more likely, the authors speculate, that cultural and political differences may be leading us into a technological Cold War where the U.S., EU and China develop their own competitive Internet platforms. Reviews * This is a book that needed to be written. I like what it contributes to the debate on internet governance. But I do not like what is likely to be its political impact on that debate. ‚Ä¶ The triumphalism of this book is premature. ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄìIn The New Cyber-Conservatism: A review of Goldsmith and Wu's 'Who Controls the Internet?, by Milton Mueller, Syracuse University \\"The New Cyber-Conservatism: Goldsmith/Wu and the Premature Triumphalism of the Territorial Nation-State: A review of Goldsmith and Wu's 'Who Controls the Internet? Illusions of a Borderless World'\\", Milton L. Mueller, June 2006, Internet Governance Project paper IGP06-003 * In the 1990s the Internet was greeted as the New New Thing: It would erase national borders, give rise to communal societies that invented their own rules, undermine the power of governments. In this splendidly argued book, Jack Goldsmith and Tim Wu explain why these early assumptions were mostly wrong: The Internet turns out to illustrate the enduring importance of Old Old Things, such as law and national power and business logic. By turns provocative and colorful, this is an essential read for anyone who cares about the relationship between technology and globalization. ‚ÄìSebastian Mallaby, Editorial Writer and Columnist, The Washington PostReviews of Who Controls the Internet?

STIM1 has a single transmembrane domain, and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, and to a lesser extent to the plasma membrane. Even though the protein has been identified earlier, its function was unknown until recently. In 2005, it was discovered that STIM1 functions as a calcium sensor in the endoplasmic reticulum. Upon activation of the IP3 receptor, the calcium concentration in the endoplasmic reticulum decreases, which is sensed by STIM1, via its EF hand domain. STIM1 activates the \\"store-operated\\" ORAI1 calcium ion channels in the plasma membrane, via intracellular STIM1 movement, clustering under plasma membrane and protein interaction with ORAI isoforms. STIM1-mediated calcium entry is required for thrombin-induced disassembly of VE-cadherin adherens junctions. 2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) and 4-chloro-3-ethylphenol (4-CEP) cause STIM1 clustering in a cell and prevent STIM1 moving toward plasma membrane.

The Hanging Judge Ponsor's debut novel, The Hanging Judge, was released in December 2013 by Open Road Integrated Media. Based on his own experience presiding over a 2000 Massachusetts capital case, the first in the state in more than fifty years, this legal thriller offers an unprecedented inside view of a federal death penalty trial. Plot: When a drive-by shooting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, claims the lives of a Puerto Rican drug dealer and a hockey mom volunteering at an inner-city clinic, the police arrest a rival gang member. With no death penalty in Massachusetts, the US attorney shifts the double homicide out of state jurisdiction into federal court so he can seek a death sentence. The Honorable David S. Norcross, a federal judge with only two years on the bench, now presides over the first death penalty case in the state in decades. He must referee the clash of an ambitious female prosecutor and a brilliant veteran defense attorney in a high-stress environment of community outrage, media pressure, vengeful gang members, and a romantic entanglement that threatens to capsize his trial‚Äînot to mention the most dangerous force of all: the unexpected. The One-Eyed Judge Ponsor's second novel, The One-Eyed Judge was released in June 2017, and is the second book in the Judge Norcross Novels. Plot: When FBI agents barge into Sidney Cranmer‚Äôs home accusing him of a heinous crime, the respected literature professor‚Äôs life becomes a nightmare. Cranmer insists the illicit material found by the agents isn‚Äôt his, but the charge against him appears airtight, and his academic specialty‚Äîthe life and work of controversial author Lewis Carroll, creator of Alice‚Äôs Adventures in Wonderland‚Äîconvinces investigators he‚Äôs lying. Presiding over the case against Professor Cranmer, U.S. District Judge David Norcross fears his daily confrontation with evil has made him too jaded to become a husband and father. His girlfriend, Claire Lindemann, teaches in the same department as the defendant and is convinced of his innocence. Soon, she will take matters into her own hands. Meanwhile‚Äîwith his love life in turmoil and his plans for the future on hold‚Äîa personal tragedy leaves Norcross responsible for his two young nieces.

She was the eldest of three children of Talbot Nelson Bryan and Mary Spiers Bryan, both descended from slaveholding families. Her mother was related to the Stocktons, Simpsons, and other early Kentucky settlers. Her paternal grandfather, Morgan Bryan, was one of the pioneer settlers of that state and the early settlement Bryan's Station, as well as a relation by marriage of Daniel Boone, whom the Bryans accompanied from North Carolina into Kentucky. When she was three, the family moved near Versailles, Kentucky.Michaels 1999, p. 9-10. When Piatt was eight, her mother died. The loss had a profound impact on her life and outlook, as evident in her poetry. After her mother's death, Piatt lived on various Kentucky plantations with relatives, accompanied by her mother's nurse, an enslaved African-American woman. For a time, she lived with her grandmother, and then later went to live with her father at the home of his new wife. Eventually, her father placed her and a younger sister in the care of their aunt, Mrs. Annie Boone, who lived in New Castle, Kentucky. In New Castle, Piatt attended Henry Female College, graduating in 1854.Bennett, Introduction, 2001, p. xxiii She became an avid reader, and was especially fond of Percy Bysshe Shelley, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Lord Byron, Thomas Moore, Walter Scott, Felicia Hemans, and Robert Browning. While a student, she began publishing her poetry in the local newspaper. During the early part of her career, she published under her maiden name, Sarah (or Sallie) M. Bryan, or her initials, S.M.B.The Sarah Morgan Bryan Piatt Recovery Project, The Ohio State University Knowledge Bank, https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/87056, accessed 9 June 2020 Career When George D. Prentice, writer, poet, and editor of the Louisville Journal, encountered her poetry, he immediately recognized her talent and skill. In 1855 he wrote to her: \\"I now say emphatically to you again . . . that, if you are entirely true to yourself, and if your life be spared, you will, in the maturity of your powers, be the first poet of your sex in the United States. I say this not as what I think, but what I know.\\" Prentice became Piatt's mentor and advocate, publishing many of her poems in his newspaper. She also began sending her work to The New York Ledger, a popular and important periodical with a national circulation.\\"The Early Poems of Sarah Morgan Bryan (Piatt) in the New York Ledger, 1857-1860,\\" Elizabeth Renker, The Sarah Morgan Byran Piatt Recovery Project, The Ohio State University Knowledge Bank, https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/87056, accessed 27 March 2020 On June 18, 1861, she married aspiring poet John James Piatt (also known as \\"J.J.\\"), who at the time was working as a secretary for Prentice. The couple relocated to Washington, D.C. where J.J. had accepted a clerk position in the U.S. Treasury. During this period they published a collection featuring a section of poems by each of them, The Nests at Washington (1864). The work was J.J.'s second book (following the 1861 Poems of Two Friends with William Dean Howells) and Sarah's first. Throughout their relationship, J.J. managed Sarah's career, including submitting her poems to periodicals and arranging for the publication of her work in book form.Bennett, Palace-Burner, xxvi-xxvii In July 1867, they moved to Ohio, where J.J. worked for Cincinnati newspapers. They made their home on a part of the old estate of William Henry Harrison in North Bend, Ohio, a few miles south of Cincinnati, on the Ohio River. The family shuttled back and forth to Washington D.C. on a few occasions, such as when J.J. worked for the postal service. From 1870 to 1876, Sarah and the children joined J.J. in Washington D.C. in the winters where he was serving as librarian of the United States House of Representatives. During this time, Sarah's poems appeared in the Washington, D.C. weekly newspaper The Capital, founded by Donn Piatt, her cousin by marriage.The Capital, 1871-1880, The Sarah Morgan Bryan Piatt Recovery Project, The Ohio State University Knowledge Bank, https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/90925, accessed 27 March 2020 Her first independent collection of poetry, A Woman's Poems, appeared anonymously in 1871. This came to be her best known work, made famous by Bayard Taylor's book, The Echo Club. The volume was followed by several more, including A Voyage to the Fortunate Isles (Boston, 1874), That New World (Boston, 1876), Poems in Company with Children (Boston, 1877), and Dramatic Persons and Moods (Boston, 1878). During this period, she also contributed to many prominent American magazines, such as The Atlantic Monthly, Scribner's Monthly, The Century Magazine, Harper's Magazine, and St. Nicholas Magazine. In 1882, the Piatts moved to Queenstown (now Cobh) Ireland, as J.J. had accepted the position of Consul of the U.S. to Cork, a job he held for eleven years. While abroad, Sarah wrote many poems inspired by her time in Ireland. She continued publishing poetry collections, including An Irish Garland (Edinburgh, 1884), Selected Poems (London, 1885), In Primrose Time: a New Irish Garland (London, 1886), The Witch in the Glass, and Other Poems (London, 1889), and An Irish Wild-Flower (London, 1891), all of which were issued simultaneously in the U.S. Sarah and J.J. also published another volume featuring both of their work, The Children Out-of-Doors: a Book of Verses (Edinburgh, 1884). Personal life Piatt was the mother of Marian (b 1862); Victor (1864); Donn (1867); Fred (1869); Guy (1871); Louis (1875); and Cecil (1878) as well as at least one infant child and possibly others who died in infancy. Victor died in a tragic fireworks accident in 1874, and Louis drowned in a boating accident in 1884 while the Piatts were living in Ireland. After J.J.'s death in 1917, Piatt lived with her son Cecil in Caldwell, New Jersey. She died of pneumonia on December 22, 1919. Sarah and J.J. are buried at Spring Grove Cemetery, Cincinnati, Ohio. Themes and reception According to scholar Paula Bennett, ‚Äúthe bulk of Sarah Piatt‚Äôs poetry can be divided into five thematic categories: poems on the Civil War and its aftermath, North and South; poems of gender (romance and marriage); poems about motherhood and to/on children; poems inspired by the Piatt‚Äôs stay in Ireland (1882-1893) and travels on the continent; and poems on set cultural themes: religion, dead heroes, moral or political allegories, art and artists.‚Äù Bennett has suggested that Piatt's writing on motherhood and children was so prolific that she produced ‚Äúwhat is probably the largest single body of poetry [on the topic] in the English language.‚Äù More recently, Piatt scholar Elizabeth Renker has identified her as a major poet of Reconstruction sociopolitics. During Sarah Piatt's lifetime, her work was mostly praised by critics. According to Emerson Venable's The Poets of Ohio (1909): ‚ÄúMrs. Piatt is a woman of original and exceptional genius‚Äîa poet whose name shines in American literature.‚Äù Yet some found her poetry too subtle. In the 1889 Encyclopedia Britannica entry about the poet, J.M. Stoddart observed that ‚Äúher poems are thoughtful and deep in sentiment, but sometimes obscure.‚Äù Literary scholar Karen L. Kilcup has tracked how critics typically praised ‚Äúher womanliness while critiquing her obscurity and difficulty,‚Äù often remaining ‚Äúoblivious to her depth.‚Äù Despite the popularity Piatt enjoyed during her career, her work fell into obscurity after her death in 1919. The new aesthetics ushered in and prized by modernist poets devalued popular poets of prior generations, including many women poets.\\"Recovering Canon: Renker Launches Sarah Morgan Bryan Piatt Digital Initiative.‚Äù The Ohio State University, Department of English, https://english.osu.edu/news/recovering-canon-renker-launches-sarah-morgan- bryan-piatt-digital-initiative, accessed 4 June 2020 Scholars began to rediscover Piatt's work in the mid-1990s, and two selected editions of her poems appeared in 1999 and 2001.\\"Recovering Canon: Renker Launches Sarah Morgan Bryan Piatt Digital Initiative.‚Äù The Ohio State University, Department of English, https://english.osu.edu/news/recovering-canon-renker-launches- sarah-morgan-bryan-piatt-digital-initiative, accessed 4 June 2020 Over the past twenty years, a growing body of scholarship has brought her to wider public attention as a contender for entry in the literary canon.The Sarah Morgan Bryan Piatt Recovery Project, The Ohio State University Knowledge Bank, https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/87056, accessed 4 June 2020 Selected works * A Woman's Poems. 1871 * A Voyage to the Fortunate Isles. 1874 * That New World, & Other Poems. 1877 * Poems in Company with Children. 1877 * Dramatic Persons and Moods: with Other New Poems. 1880 * A Book about Baby and Other Poems in Company with Children. 1882 * An Irish Garland. 1885 * In Primrose Time: a New Irish Garland. 1886 * Mrs. Piatt's Select Poems: a Voyage to the Fortunate Isles and Other Poems. 1886 * Child's-World Ballads: Three Little Emigrants, a Romance of Cork Harbour, 1884, etc. 1887 * The Witch in the Glass, etc. 1888 * An Irish Wild-Flower, etc. 1891 * An Enchanted Castle, and Other Poems: Pictures, Portraits and People in Ireland. 1893 * Poems. 1894 * Complete Poems. 1894 * That New World: The Selected Poems of Sarah Piatt (1861-1911).

It was the predecessor state to what would eventually become the Eastern Slavic nations of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. During this time, Eastern Orthodoxy, a defining feature of Ukrainian nationalism, was incorporated into everyday life.  Pre-history  =Nomads= During the Iron Age, numerous tribes settled on the modern-day territory of Ukraine. In the first millennium BC, a tribe of people who called themselves Cimmerians made their way from Thrace and occupied the land around the Dnieper. On the Black Sea coast, the Greeks founded numerous colonies, such as Yalta. Around 700 BC, another group of people settled on the Ukrainian steppes: the Scythians, a semi-nomadic people from Persia. At the turn of the 4th century BC, a series of Nomadic tribes succeeded each other as the dominant force on the steppes, many of whom were Persian in origin. First were the Sarmatians, expert warriors and herders who were known to fight on horseback. They were succeeded by the Alans. The next barbarian migration came in the 3rd century AD that was dominated by the Goths, a Germanic people who settled between the Carpathians and Black Sea. They would eventually go on to attack the Roman Empire, expelling the legions from Dacia, the Roman province on the lower Danube. The Goths were forced from their settlements around AD 370 by the Huns, who pushed them beyond the Danube. The next two nomadic hordes to traverse Ukraine were the Bulgars, who were of Turkic origin, and the Avars living in the Carpathian Basin. The Bulgarians went on to settle north of the Byzantine Empire, in present-day Bulgaria, while the Avars would settle in present-day Hungary, along with the Huns. =Slavs= Slavs are believed to have originated in the region(s) of modern-day Poland, Slovakia or western Ukraine. During the 5th and 6th centuries, the Hunnic and Gothic kingdoms had fallen, and Slavs began to migrate in all directions, settling as far south as the Balkans, the Oder River, and the Arctic. Numerous tribes settled on either side of the Dnieper, the river that has been a symbol of Ukraine. Originally, the early Slavs divided themselves by tribe ‚Äì large communal families that practiced a sort of ‚Äúprimitive communism.‚ÄùVoweles, Ukraine and its People, 36 The application of technological advances to agriculture ‚Äúincreased productivity and rendered the collective labour of large groups no longer necessary. The clans split into smaller families; and, on the more fertile soil at least, it became possible for the small family to meet the needs of its members by restricting operations to a limited holding of land. Such land became in course of time private property.‚ÄùVowles, Ukraine and its People, 37. Before the rise of Rus, the first East Slavic state, a Turkic people who adopted Judaism established an empire on the Caspian Sea that included the Caucuses, Azerbaijan, southern Russia, and eastern Ukraine. The Khazars provided a buffer for the developing Slavic tribes to develop themselves internally and migrate from their marsh birthplace.Doroshenko 27 Trade between the Khazars and Swedes increased during this time, requiring the Varangians, or as they styled themselves, Rus, to follow the River Dnieper south across Eastern Europe. This is similar to what other Scandinavians did in Western Europe, specifically Normandy and England: they conquered the people and established their dynasties, becoming culturally part of the conquered population. This is the beginning of contact between future rulers and subjects. As the Khazar Empire began to crumble, two Mongolian tribes, the Pechenegs and Polovtsi pushed the Eastern Slavic tribes from the Don and lower Dnieper.Doroshenko 30 Meanwhile, the Varangians had been exploring along the many rivers of Eastern Europe, trading with the various Slavic tribes that settled there. Their tribal name was, Russ, was given to the state that Oleg of Novgorod would establish when he conquered Kyiv and deposed Askold and Dir.Doroshenko 29 This new political entity, called Kyivan Rus, was ruled by the Varangian dynasty founded by its first prince, Rurik. This dynasty would rule Kyivan Rus and its numerous principalities years after its downfall and was only replaced in Muscovy by the Romanovs in the 17th century. The area of early Slavdom, which roughly coincides with the territory of Ukraine, was at an important crossroad, namely, barbarian migrations from the north, south, and west. Due to a lack of natural barriers and its position at an important geographic migratory route, a multitude of tribes, peoples, and cultures contributed to the development of Ukrainian identity that is unique: neither wholly Western nor Eastern, neither wholly Asian or European.  Rus  =Kyivan= Circa AD 800, the Varangians Askold and Dir organised an army and travelled down the Dnieper to Kyiv in order to save the cities inhabitants from a besieging tribe. In doing so, they paved the way for the ascension of the Rurik dynasty over not just Kyiv and Novgorod, but all the tribes that make up the East Slavs. The Varangians brought these Slavic tribes political cohesion by building one of the most powerful medieval kingdoms, and undoubtedly a sense of cultural cohesion with the conversion of Rus to Christianity in AD 988. As Rus was one of the largest medieval empires, it is only natural that it would cover a variety of geographic zones. The northern reaches of Rus covered a heavily forested area called zalizya (land behind the forest) that was sparsely settled. There was not much industry or agriculture, with trade being the main economic activity. Vladimir, a city in this region, did not significantly increase its power until well into the decline of Kyivan Rus. The south of Rus was the centre of government, culture, and trade. It was much more heavily populated and prosperous, with trade and agriculture being well established and many links to western empires, such as the Byzantine Empire. The unity of Rus was evident in the characteristics of this Medieval Slavic state. The name Rus, which is derived from the name Varangians had for themselves, is the ‚Äúcommon name for previously separate and individually named East Slavic tribes.‚ÄùWilson The people of Rus fought common external enemies, making a distinction between ‚Äúus‚Äù and ‚Äúthem.‚Äù There was a lack of natural internal borders that facilitated easy travel of people, goods, and communication: the Dnieper united Eastern Europe through trade. Christianity was an \\"ideology that helped to underpin princely authority. After the adoption of Byzantine Christianity, architecture throughout Rus became more uniform, especially when it came to churches. The adoption of local saints, such as Volodymyr the Great, strengthened local unity. There was also the fact that the elites and boyars were united by common language: Church Slavonic, which is demonstrated by the lack of translators in the courts of various princes from all parts of Kyivan Rus. Books were widely distributed as well. Lastly, the introduction of a codified set of laws, the first of its kind in Eastern Europe, by Yaroslav the Wise, called the Russka Pravda. It must have been widely used because of the many copies found. In spite of its many unifying factors, there was a divergence between the northern and southern principalities. In 1169, Prince Andrei Bogoliubskii of Vladimir sacked Kyiv, which exemplifies the princely rivalry that undermined central dynastic authority. The modern Russian language also began to form in the 11th century, due to the late consolidation of the northern Slavic tribes under Rus. More so, the conquerors and local peoples mixed their languages, mixing Finno-Ugric with Old East Slavic. While the internal linguistic divisions of Rus were geographically defined as a North-South split within the confederation of East Slavic tribes, there was a widening gulf between the Rus elites and commoners. As previously mentioned, after the death of Grand Prince Ihor, the Rus language began to develop dialectal forms, corresponding with the conquering of the northern Slavic towns such as Suzdal and Vladimir and the future nation-states of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. The landed elites of Rus, the boyars, spoke Church Slavonic after the conversion of the land to Christianity in AD 988 by Volodymyr the Great, negating the need for interpreters among the various princely courts of Kyivan Rus. The Rurikid dynasty was ethnically Varangian, not Slavic. Though this did not lead to drastic estrangement between the monarch and commoners, it provided friction between the boyars and the centralised authority, much like the conflicts being played out in the Kingdoms of France and England at the same time. The tension between these two classes contributed to the fall of Kyivan Rus in the face of the invasion of the Golden Horde, and eventually Rus‚Äô western-successor, Halych-Volhynia. Thus, the cultural legacy and common identity of Rus was immortalised in the language, religion, and oral traditions of the Rus peasant. This new state was formulated on the basis of the ancient clan constitution with a new organisation for royal power overlaid. ‚ÄúAll the power of government rested originally in the hands of the general assembly of all freemen, whose decrees were executed by elected officials, consisting in part of the war-chieftains,‚Äù who became subservient to the princes of the Rurik dynasty.Rudnitsky, Ukraine, 178 There was also the boyar nobility, or all of those who owned property. They served as a foil to centralised royal power and would contribute to Kyivan Rus dissolution and fragmentation before the Mongol onslaught. The royalty of Kyiv rested their power on military control and over time developed a tradition of central government: the boyars in this respect had the advantage, since their institution of ‚Äúnoble democracy‚Äù was well established, even during the tribal era. These limitations on monarchic power led to the ruin of Kyivan Rus.Rudnitsky, Ukraine, 179 The adoption of Orthodox Christianity by Volodymyr the Great further strengthened the cultural links between the East Slavic tribes. This was needed to redefine the relations between the autocrat and the up-and-coming landowners, or boyars. By adopting a nation-wide religion, he would be able to give the nobility a license for its special behaviours and legitimize his rule and servitude of those below him. ‚ÄúHe realised that if all the lands under his rule had a common religion, this in itself would be a powerful factor making for State consolidation and stability.‚ÄùVowles Ukraine and its People, 44 From its inception, Rus was a fragile entity as it represented a conglomeration of Slavic tribes that were united by trade, religion, rivers, and similar tongues. Yet the most divisive line in Rusyn society was that between the peasants and the Rurik dynasty. The descendants of Rurik spoke Church Slavonic, whose use was limited to this class. On the other hand, the peasants and commoners were speaking Old East Slavic. This language would begin to splinter into dialects and eventually separate languages as the kingdom of Rus fell apart. =Halych-Volhynia= Halych-Volhynia (or Galicia-Volhynya) was the spiritual and cultural successor to Kyivan Rus. It was a distinctly \\"Ukrainian\\" state, in the sense that it was not a conglomerate of diverse peoples and principalities. It was situated in the westernmost part of modern Ukraine, and at its height extended to the Black Sea. It was centred in the cities of Halych and Volhynia, and exhibited European features in government and social structure; specifically, feudal social order and mutual self-defence leagues with other Eastern European countries. The military alliances were formed with Poland, Hungary, and Romania, against the Mongol \\"Golden Horde\\", which had conquered the northern Rus principalities and the old centre of Rusyn culture, Kyiv. During the era of Golden Horde hegemony over parts of the Eastern Slavic tribes, a frontier that was lawless and sparsely populated formed on the edge of Kyivan Rus and Halych-Volhynia domains, to the south and west of these political entities. It was a no-man's land until the Ruthenian (not to be confused with Rusyn) peasants, merchants, and nobles began to flee there and settle it, calling the new frontier Zaporizhia, or ‚Äúpast the rapids.‚Äù The extent of Rus control in the south was set at the first rapids on the River Dnieper. The main reason for its colonisation was the religious persecution of Orthodox Christians under Polish rule. For two hundred years, Halych-Volhynia forged stronger links with the West, increasing the amount of Latin influence. For example, the first King of Rus, Danylo, was given his crown by the Pope as a way to increase papal influence in Eastern Orthodox lands. The perpetual struggle between Latin and Byzantine religious influence is reflected in Ukrainian culture to the modern era, and is one of the defining characteristics of Ukraine: neither wholly European, nor wholly Asian.  Kyivan Rus between Poland and Muscovy  After the fall of Kyivan Rus, there were several independent Ukrainian states, notably the Kingdom of Halych, the Cossack Hetmanate and the Ukrainian National Republic after the First World War. Overall, though, there has been no modern Ukrainian tradition of statehood, making it even more difficult to place the Ukrainian identity firmly in the European or Asian camps. For that matter, in the 14th to 18th centuries, scholars could not agree as to whether Ruthenians (medieval Latin term for Ukrainians) should be grouped with Poland or Muscovy (proto-Russia). Even at such an early time, the Ukrainian question mystified scholars. Ruthenians were Orthodox and spoke dialects that would evolve into middle-Ukrainian and Belarusian. During this era, Poland and Muscovy are playing a game of tug-of- war to control and influence the territory of Ukraine, which meant increased European influences during critical stages of the Reformation, Renaissance, and Enlightenment, while historically conservative forces such as Orthodoxy and mythical-lore and literature were also prominent in shaping Ukrainian identity. The links between Ukraine, its neighbours, the East and West have been anything but equidistant. There have been periods of increased cultural influence from countries like Poland, Muscovy, and Austria. This pressure has never been geographically equal. For example, Galicia had been under Polish and Austrian rule until the end of Second World War, while Right-bank Ukraine had been under nominal Tsarist rule since the Treaty of Pereyaslav. What can be deduced is that Ukrainian lands had ties to the West for a longer period of time and at crucial moments in the formation of the Ukrainian identity that made it distinct from Russian culture, which did not materialise until the last years of Tsarist rule. As far back as Kyivan Rus, Rurikid dynasty members were married to Western and Central European royalty, such as the ruling houses of England and France. During the period of Polish dominance, many artistic and literary movements that originated in Europe made their way to Ukraine and Poland but not the Tsarist lands, as the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth forcefully isolated them. During the period of increased European cultural influence, the Ruthenian identity appears among ethnic Belarusians and Ukrainians, whose lands had been transferred to the administration of Lithuania and Poland, respectively. Ruthenian and Polish nobles often spoke Polish, Latin, and Church Slavonic in court, which added to the feeling that the Ruthenian language was the lingua franca of the peasants. The defining mark of a Ruthenian under Poland was therefore religion, as Poles are traditionally Catholic. The Rus or Rusyn identity was left to Muscovy and the Tsars as the divide between Rus and Ruthenia widened in correlation to greater Polish influence. The final straw in severing the link of association between Rusyn and Ruthenian was the Orthodox split between the Metropolitans of Moscow and Kyiv. By the 17th century, Ruthenian identity and culture have grown independent of their previous associations, and is called the Ruthenian Revival. Although many aspects of modern Ukrainian society are still being formed or would be greatly influenced by the forthcoming Cossack Revolts, Ukrainian identity had distinctly defined itself a niche in the society of the day. Vernacular Ukrainian was being used in Church services and the founding of the Rezszpospolita by the Union of Lublin created a divergence in the Ruthenian identity between ethnic Belarusian and Ukrainians. Petro Mohyla, Orthodox Metropolitan of Kyiv and founder of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy started a reform movement with the goal of reviving the traditions of the local Orthodox Church for Ukrainians. This meant restored teachings of traditional Greek and Latin, which many saw as a reinforcement of the cultural continuum that links Rus to Ruthenia. In conjunction with the formation of distinct Cossack society, Ukrainian identity would forever take a path of its own choosing. = Cossacks = Who and what were the Cossacks are questions of great historical significance for Ukraine. In military terms, Cossacks were fast mounted infantry. They were quick and manoeuvrable like Turkish cavalry but lacked the firepower of their European counterparts. In cultural terms, they are described as possessing a ‚Äúmartial spirit‚Äù and esprit du corps and known for their independent attitudes and democratic practices. Their origins lie in the establishment of small communities on the outskirts of Polish and Tsarist control, to the south and west of traditional centres of Ukrainian power and culture. They banded together for self-defence against raiders from all nations and took in people from all walks of life. Initially, Cossack bands acted much like pirates, raiding rich and lucrative cities all over the Black Sea and the Hellespont. The name Cossack is derived from the Turkish word meaning ‚Äúfree man‚Äù, and this is exactly how Cossacks viewed themselves: free and independent from outside influence. Ruthenian nobles, merchants, and serfs made up the majority of their ranks, but there were many Turks, Poles, and Russians as well. Thus, the ‚ÄúCossack nation‚Äù did not correspond geographically, socially, or ethnically to Ruthenia, but they were intrinsically linked by language, religion, and cultural legacy. Over time, Cossacks took up the mantle of defenders of the Ukrainian Orthodox faith, which legitimised their rule. As previously mentioned, the initial motivation for forming Cossack troops was defence from raids and the lawlessness of the frontier. Over time, Cossacks began to hire themselves out as mercenaries to various armies and kingdoms. In Poland, for example, there existed a registry of Cossacks who mobilised and fought for the Polish crown. Many different types of Cossack communities formed over time, including the Don, Zaporizhia, Terek, and Ural hosts. They were immune from imperial authority because of their remoteness, which gave these free communities time to grow and organise their military potential. During the Cossack Period of Ukrainian history, there is a great national ‚Äúawakening.‚Äù Previously, Ukrainian‚Äôs had been united by language, custom, and religion: now those distinctions were not so fine. Muscovy had a similar religion and claimed Ukrainian was a mere dialect, an offshoot of its own language. What clearly defines the boundaries of being Ukrainian is class identity: this leads all the way up to the Bolshevik Revolution. Ukrainian‚Äôs were by far peasants, except for the few nobles who were and assimilated by the Poles and Russians. Therefore, as more and more people fled the advance of the Huns, the repressions of Poland, the ‚Äúborderland‚Äù that would become the Ukrainian heartland, between Turkey, Poland, and Muscovy, became settled by Ukrainian serfs fleeing serfdom under Poland of Russia, or ‚Äútrue‚Äù slavery under the Turks. As these peasants fled, they came together and established Cossack brigades with attached territorial divisions for safekeeping against raids. These Cossacks, who stood up to Polish, Turkish, and Russian imperial authority, were the true national heroes of Ukraine during this time, and defined what it was to be Ukrainian for generations to come. The subsequent revival of Ukrainian culture and nationalism during the 19th century in Kharkiv was hugely influenced by Cossack exploits in state-building and keeping the rival imperial powers at bay. They did so by ‚Äútak[ing] upon themselves the task of being the main support of both the Orthodox Church and Ukrainian nationality.‚ÄùDoroshenko, History of the Ukraine, 192 With the Cossacks by their side, the Orthodox clergy realised that they could safely practice in Kyiv, and once more, the centre of Ukrainian culture and religion moved to Kyiv. The Kyivan brotherhood is founded, which eventually becomes a university and, finally, an academy: it would become the Kyivska-Mohylanska Akademia. Hetman Sahaidachny and all the Brotherhood of the Zaporijian Cossacks joined the brotherhood. Thus, Cossackhood is intrinsically tied with Ukrainian religion and culture. At the same time, Ukrainian nobles were conscious of the historical legacy that they were continuing, which extends all the way back to Kyivan Rus.Doroshenko, History of the Ukraine, 196 ‚Äú[Sahaidachny] returned to the Ukrainian population the use of their traditional electoral principle in ecclesiastical as well as in secular affairs, a principle very deeply embodied in the instincts of Ukrainians‚Ä¶in doing so, Sahaidachny provided Ukrainians with a method and with strength for their future struggles for national existence.‚ÄùDoroshenko, History of the Ukraine, 201 This Cossack liberalism can be seen in the democratic nature of the Zaporizhian Sich, the nucleus of the proto-Cossack state (the Hetmanate), and is regarded by contemporary Ukrainians as unique foil to the authoritarian and expansionist character of ‚Äúimperial‚Äù Russia. = Zaporiz'ka Sich = Zaporiz'ka Sich, or ‚ÄúFortress beyond the rapids‚Äù was the centre of the Ukrainian Cossacks. From there, they organised raids and developed unique institutions of government and culture. There was immense diversity among the regiments, which led to the tradition of equality among all Cossacks. What made the Ukrainian Cossacks unique from the other Hosts was the democratic nature of their government: each district was garrisoned by a regiment, which in turn elected a leader, called an ataman; the starshyna, high-ranking Cossack officers, would elect a leader to oversee all the districts and regiments, called a hetman. From 1600 to 1648, Cossack raids became a thorn in the side of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as they took up the defence of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. Petro Mohyla cemented this relationship in the wake of Orthodox Church reforms. = Khmelnytsky Uprising = In 1648, the Zaporizhia Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky began a campaign against the Rzeczpospolita. Contrary to the label most historians assign this uprising, it was not ‚Äúa war of national liberation.‚Äù In the course of the struggle, the Cossacks liberated the palatinates of Kyiv, Chernihiv, and Bratslav, which would form the territorial basis for the Cossack state, the Hetmanate. Red Ruthenia, or Galicia, remained a part of Poland until the Partitions of Poland, at which point it was transferred to the Habsburg Empire. This signified a fundamental shift in the goal and tactics of the Cossacks: rather than being a band of mercenaries and outlaws, they were now the protectors of the Ukrainian state, culture, and faith. After 1648, three territorial entities constituted the new Cossack state: Slobidska Ukraine, the Hetmanate, and Zaporizhia Sich. = Mythology = Some writers have speculated that the Cossacks were related to the Roxolonian Sarmatians, Iron Age inhabitants of the Ukrainian steppes. This is very similar to the justification for power used by the Polish szlachta, and gave the Cossacks a geographic and historical element to their identity, in addition to the honour of defending ‚ÄúSlavia Orthodoxa.‚Äù = Hetmanate = The first Hetman of the legitimate political entity called the Hetmanate was Bohdan Khmelnytsky, the leader of the Cossack Uprising. This state existed from 1649 until 1775, the year in which Zaporizhia Sich was destroyed. During this period, the state was weakened by bickering and internal division, allowing both Poland and Muscovy to expand their influence over Cossack affairs. Russia particularly wished to tighten its hold over Ukraine because of the belief that they were the spiritual successors to the legacies of Rus and Rome, an idea which gained credibility as they were the only state descended from Rus to not be dominated by a foreign power. The Treaty of Pereyaslav of 1654 between the Hetmanate and Muscovy guaranteed Cossack protection by the Tsar. Furthermore, it established the Cossack Hetmanate in Left-bank Ukraine, which was possible due to the declining fortunes of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Cossacks also felt more affiliation with Muscovy because it was an Orthodox state, and religion was more important than language at this time. Cossack autonomy came to an end with the rule of the last Hetman, Ivan Mazepa. Hetman Mazepa initiated an uprising in 1709, which was the last gasp of Cossack separatism. The Tsar considered this to be treason, claiming it violated the terms of the Treaty of Pereyaslav, and brutally crushed this uprising. This paved the way for Russian imperialism over Eastern Europe and its prominent position in Ukrainian history until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The new Cossack state was engaged in a three-way diplomatic and military conflict with the Ottoman Empire, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the Russian Empire. The Khmelnytsky Uprising shook the Commonwealth to its foundation, leading to the division of Poland and Lithuania. After the uprising and the bitter military clashes that followed, Poland was estranged from the Ukrainian- Cossack state and more concerned with keeping the crumbling Commonwealth together. In order to consolidate the gains made during the rebellion, Khmelnytsky signed the Treaty of Pereyaslav with Russia that ensured the protection of the Cossack state by the armies of the Tsar. This decision would have lasting repercussions for the next two centuries of Ukrainian history. Ivan Mazepa‚Äôs rebellion resulted in tragedy for the Ukrainian people. With his failed attempt at ensuring Ukrainian autonomy, Mazepa only succeeded in creating lasting mistrust amongst the Cossacks. This led to the absorption of Slobiska Ukraine (1772), Zaporizhian Sich (1775), and the Hetmanate (1785) into Tsarist Russia. In addition, the Partitions of Poland (1772, 1793, and 1795) handed Russia central Ukraine and Volhynia, while Galicia and Bukovyna fell to the Habsburg Empire. Despite these setbacks to Ukrainian statehood, the 17th century propelled the formation of a distinct and modern Ukrainian identity. Whereas beforehand Ruthenians were nothing more than southern Rusyn, sharing common association with Belarusians, this relationship was irreversibly changed by the creation of the a Cossack state and the internal fusion of the Mohyla‚Äôs reformed Orthodoxy with the ideals of Cossack society. With the mix of academic church culture and Cossack liberty stood in contrast to the authoritarian and traditionalist nature of Russian Tsardom. To add to the growing divide between these neighbouring people, Ruthenia was politically and geographically closer to the European centre than Muscovy, which was culturally ‚Äúbackards‚Äù and had been previously isolated by Poland.Wilson 66 Galicia historically would serve as the centre of diffusion for Western and Renaissance European influences throughout ‚ÄúUkrainian‚Äù territory, having considerable impact. Such cultural influence was obvious by the time Mazepa was elected Hetman because the number of churches that had or were being built was very high. In essence, the Cossack period of Ukrainian national history was when a unique local culture appeared that would be looked back upon by modern Ukrainians as another chapter in tale of the evolution of national identity.  Khmelnytsky's hetmanate between Austria and Russia  = Russia = With the liquidation of the Cossack state, Ukrainians became another ethnic group within the Russian Empire. Though the Treaty of Pereyaslav supposedly guaranteed the autonomy and sovereignty of the Hetmanate, the Tsar and his successors ignored this stipulation. At the same time, the Romanov dynasty pushed ahead with the construction of a distinct national identity for Russians, or an \\"imagined community\\". During this period, Ukrainian and Russian culture were similar, and it would have seemed much easier to integrate and assimilate Ukrainians into the emerging Russian consciousness.Wilson 77 To that effect, the Tsarist government adopted the policy of Russification, which would continue to play a major role in domestic politics within the Russian Empire and Soviet Union until the independence of Eastern European nations behind the Iron Curtain. At the start of the 18th century, Russian national identity was in its infancy and not distinct from the state.Wilson 76 After 1785 the Romanov dynasty made a conscious effort to assimilate the Ruthenian and Cossack elites by granting them noble status within the Russian Empire. Having become part of the nobility, Ukrainians could now rise to the highest ranks of the service bureaucracy. This was only possible by being politically loyal to the Tsar and to the Romanov dynasty and by not emphasizing ethnic differences. The only bastion of Ukrainian identity lay with the peasants in the countryside, who passed on this unique identity through folk traditions, such as oral stories.Wilson 78 This precarious hold on the past could have been eliminated had there been universal primary education including Russian language courses and history lessons that legitimised the rule of the Romanovs.Wilson 79 Simultaneously, the colonisation of Nova Rossiya (New Russia), or the southern and western peripheries of Ukraine, attracted a wide array of people from all over the Russian empire. This new urban and industrial area became culturally Russian. The most serious attempt to Russify the subjects of the Romanovs occurred in the reigns of the last two Tsars, Alexander III (1881-1894) and Nicholas II (1894-1917), during the last forty years of their dynasty's rule. Because serious application of the policy of Russification did not take place until so late in the attempt to create a Russian national identity, fully formed nationalities, such as the Poles, were already part of the Russian Empire. At every turn, Polish nationalism fuelled the fires of rebelliousness, which helped ignite the nationalism of other people ‚Äì Lithuanians, Ukrainians, and Jews. The options of Ukrainian-Russian synthesis were drifting towards the extremes: either assimilation or resistance.Wilson 81 Several other reasons account for why Russification never completely eliminated Ukrainian identity: * Russians and Ukrainians were developing in separate directions, forming the proto-national identities that would develop into modern nation-states * Romanov Tsars attempted to create an artificial identity that traced its roots all the way back to Rus' while the Russian and Ukrainian commoners were becoming more culturally and linguistically divergent * Imperial Russia did not have the \\"repressive capacity\\", in terms of resources, infrastructure, or government organisation, that future leaders like Lenin and Stalin had at their disposal * the implementation of repressive policies chronologically coincided with the growing momentum of the Ukrainian movement in Galicia, under the Habsburg Empire, which helped inspire and introduce ideas that would keep Ukrainian nationalism under the Romanovs alive Due to the critical link between Russian-occupied Ukraine and the rest of Europe that Galicia provided, and because of the banning of overtly political expressions of ethnic identity, the Ukrainian national movement transformed itself into an artistic and literary movement. During the late 18th century, many nationalities within the large empires of Europe experienced ‚Äúnational awakenings‚Äù, which inevitably contributed to the increasing momentum that Ukrainian nationalism gained in Galicia and in the Bukovyna, which was part of the Austrian Empire, making the dissemination of nationalistic ideas much easier.Doroshenko 534 The legacy of Ukrainian literature goes back a millennium, which correlates to the establishment of Kyivan Rus. Examples of early Ukrainian literature are the Primary Chronicle and the Halychuna-Volhynian Chronicle. Though both of these works were written in Church Slavonic dialect, they nonetheless show a departure from Russian and Polish works of the same era (circa 11th century AD). The influence of Ukraine's literature is so powerful that, in the 18th century, \\"when the end of the Ukrainian nation seemed inevitable, literature had reached such a high state of development that it awoke the educated classes of the nation\\".Rudnitsky, Ukraine, 174 Kotlarevsky (1769-1838) introduced pure vernacular literature at the turn of the 18th century. The most well-known Ukrainian artist and national hero, Taras Shevchenko (1814-1861), has a reputation as the author of poetry such as Haidamaky (1841) and Kobzar (1840). The rise of common language to such heights in literature is further proof of the distinction between Ukrainians and their neighbours. Notable bards, such as the national heroes Ivan Franko (1856-1916) and Taras Shevchenko, constructed the modern Ukrainian language while they linked the glory of Cossackdom to the cultural continuum of Ukrainian identity. Whereas previous poets and writers had viewed Polish and Russian identities as similar, or at least related, the poet Taras Shevchenko viewed ‚ÄúUkrainian, Russian, and Polish identities as mutually exclusive and fundamentally hostile‚Äù.Wilson 90 Basically, Shevchenko deconstructed the idea of Ukrainian- Russian empire in the minds of the Ukrainian people. = Austria = In 1772, after the three partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the regions of Galicia (Haluchuna) and Bukovyna became part of the Habsburg Empire. Unlike their brethren under the domination of the Romanov Tsars, Ukrainians living within the Austrian state were not culturally repressed. In fact, The Austrian government took steps to improve the educational level of the general population and the material conditions of the Ukrainian clergy. Polish, German, and Ukrainian were taught concurrently in schools. With the ascension of Joseph II, the enlightened despot, the Austrian monarch ‚Äúwas inspired by an enthusiastic wish to do his best for his subjects‚Äù (Doroshenkok 571). During his reign and that of his successors, the Ukrainian-speaking clergy were able to study and worship in their own tongue. As most elites throughout Ukrainian history had either been assimilated or liquidated, the emergence of an educated and nationalistic clergy that stood up for the rights of the Ukrainian people signalled the emergence of a ‚Äúnational renaissance.‚Äù Following the rule of Joseph II until the Revolutions of 1848, the Ukrainian clergy was enthusiastic about the ideas of a Ukrainian nation and developed it even further (Doroshenko 574). After the turbulent revolutions of 1848 that shook the empires of Europe to their core, concessions were made to Ukrainians in Galicia. In the same year, serfdom was abolished. By 1849, the General Ruthenian Council had laid out a programme of Ukrainian aspirations which included the codification of uniform Ukrainian spelling and the division of East Slavic linguistic group into three branches: Ukrainian, Belarusian and Russian (Doroshenko 578). During the course of these events, the Ruthenian Council made a historic declaration: ‚Äú[we] are part of a great Ruthenian people that speaks the same language and numbers 15 millions, of whom two and half million live in Galicia‚Äù (Wilson 106). This represents the beginning of the acceptance that the Ruthenians who live in both Russia and Austria share the same culture and identity. Unlike Russia, Austria never attempted to create a conglomerate identity or nationalism for its state. Similarly, Ukrainians in Galicia established a distinct identity for themselves that ‚ÄúRuthenians‚Äù on both sides of the political boundary separating them could claim as their own, while in Russia, Ukrainian nationalists concentrated their energy on destroying the idea of a common ‚ÄúRuski‚Äù identity for Greater and Little Russia (Wilson 109). In this sense, Galicia has many parallels with Piedmont, an Italian territory that was the base for national unification.  Great War and its consequences  As previously mentioned, Ukrainians were politically divided between the Austrian-Hungarian Empire and the Russian Empire. When war broke out, Ukrainians were conscripted into the armies of both nations: 3.5 million fought as part of the Russian army, while a quarter- million took up arms for the Austrian throneSubtelny, Orest (2000). Ukraine: A History. University of Toronto Press, 343. Areas of Galicia were occupied by the Russian army and many civilians were executed for supposedly ‚Äúcollaborating with the enemy.‚Äù One and a half million people lost their lives during the Great WarReid, Anna (1999). Borderland: A Journey Through The History of Ukraine. Colorado: Westview Press, 130. = Revolutions of 1917 = The First World War (1914‚Äì1918) reshaped the political divisions of Europe fundamentally. Out of the four major land Empires (Austria-Hungary, Germany, Ottoman, and Russia), only one remained imperialistically intact: Russia. In the wake of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, Russia transformed from a dynastic entity into a socialist state. The multitude of ethnicities that were part of Russia began to demand sovereignty as early as the February Revolution, which deposed the Tsar. In March 1917, the Ukrainian People's Republic was declared. This was an extremely complicated conflict because it included a multi-sided conflict with nationalistic and ideological aspirations clashing, and served as a catalyst to the disintegration of the Russian and Austrian empires. = Ukrainian People's Republic = The Tsentralna Rada, or the Central Council initially governed the newly independent Ukrainian state, elected nationalist historian Mykhailo Hrushevsky as its President. At this point, the Russian provisional Government and the Bolsheviks were clamouring for control of Ukraine; the UPR threw its support behind the communists. The provisional government was defeated, and a Soviet Ukrainian Republic was declared in Kharkiv, a city on the right-bank of the Dnieper. To support the new communist government, the Bolsheviks sent in the Red Army. Since it lacked a sufficient armed and organised military, the Tsentralna Rada was forced to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in order to receive military aid and intervention from the German government. This was too little, too late: the Tsentralna Rada was overthrown in a coup that brought ‚ÄúHetman‚Äù Pavlo Skoropadky to power. = Ukrainian State = With the Hetman coup, the name of the government changed to the Ukrainian State. Skoropadky‚Äôs conservative German-backed administration, called the Hetmanate, made major strides and inroads where the Tsentralna Rada had failed. It established a competent bureaucracy and established diplomatic ties with neighbouring countries. When the Central Powers (Germany, Austria, Ottoman, and Bulgaria) lost the war and agreed to an armistice in November 1918, all German armies within Ukraine were recalled and another socialist government, the Directorate, overthrew the conservative monarchy of Skoropadsky. = Directorate = By the end of 1918, the situation for the Ukrainian National Republic was dire. As soon as the Central Powers capitulated, Lenin annulled the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and commenced an invasion of Eastern and Central Europe. The Directorate overthrew the Hetmanate by force through the cooperation of the Sich Rifles, who had been established with the purpose of providing the Ukrainian National Republic a military defence in the volatile climate of Eastern Europe. In January 1919, the Ukrainian National Republic and the Western Ukrainian National Republic joined forces to fight the White Army, the Red Army, Polish and Romanian forces. By the time the Paris Peace Conference had finished, Galicia was once again a part of Poland and would remain so until the start of World War 2. The Directorate signed peace treaties with Poland and Romania, allowing it to focus its efforts on defeating the anti-Bolshevik and Bolshevik forces that threatened Ukraine‚Äôs newfound autonomy. In 1920, the Bolsheviks launched an offensive against Poland with the intention of spreading the socialist revolution to the heartland of Europe. The Red Army was defeated bear Warsaw, forcing Lenin to sign a peace treaty with Poland. =Partition= Meanwhile, the Red Army conquered most of the Ukrainian National Republic by the end of 1920. With the signing of the Treaty of Riga, the Bolsheviks recognised the Polish claim to Galicia and other parts of western Ukraine, while the Poles recognised Soviet claims to the rest of Ukraine. Until the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, Ukraine would remain divided between Poland the newly formed Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.  Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Ukrainian SSR  Though the Soviet Union was made up of a plethora of ethnicities, there was only one type of citizenship. Though passports and other official documents of identification would have the ‚Äúnationality‚Äù of an individual stated, it made little to no difference. Most schooling in the USSR was done in Russian and nationalistic aspirations were rejected and crushed brutally. = Ukrainization = Initially, there was a relaxation of the ‚Äúone nation, one identity‚Äù policy that had been the standard after the 18th century in Russia. With the conclusion of hostilities in Eastern Europe, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was incorporated into the larger communist federal entity, the USSR. With the utter devastation that Eastern Europe had suffered as a result of the Russian Civil War, the Soviet government encouraged the renewal of Ukrainian culture and language as a means of bringing back Ukrainian nationals and intelligentsia to help rebuild the country economically and culturally (Doroshenko 647). Ukrainian language was used in publications, schooling, and many ethnic Ukrainians were made literate. Many ethnic Ukrainians also moved to the cities, which, in the south and west, had previously been Russian in culture. This led to a renewal of the Ukrainian national identity that expanded to most of Soviet Ukraine. With the ascension of Stalin as Secretary General of the Soviet Union, Soviet policies of multi-culturalism were abandoned, religious institutions and churches were systematically destroyed, and bourgeois nationalism was repressed with special brutality and horror. = Great Famine = The Holodomor of 1932-33 (Holod = ‚Äúhunger‚Äù, mor = ‚Äúdeath‚Äù) was an artificial and organised famine that resulted in dramatic changes to the way of life and economic activity. Among them were: *Exportation of grain to Western markets in order to provide money for industrialisation policies under the Five-Year Plans *Subdue Ukrainian nationalism by initially targeting the intelligentsia, the leaders of the nationalist movement, and then the peasants, the base of support for Ukrainian nationalism *Ensure the implementation of collectivised farming (unlike their Russian counterparts, Ukrainian peasants had no experience with this method of farming) To exacerbate the situation, there was little modern farming equipment available and the steppes were experiencing a drought. Due to insufficient statistical records, estimates for the loss of life range from the low millions to as high as 10 million. With the intelligentsia liquidated prior to the famine, there was no direction for the further development of Ukrainian ‚Äúhigh culture‚Äù and the starvation of the peasantry meant that Ukrainian nationalism would mostly stay alive in the minds of the rural peasants and the Ukrainian Diaspora community until the Khrushchev thaw and Gorbachev‚Äôs policies of perestroika and glasnost. = World War II = With the disintegration of the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact, Eastern Europe was once again fully embroiled in war. During the German occupation of Ukraine, many nationalists became disillusioned with the Nazis and Soviets because of the retention of collectivised agricultural policies and deportation of Ukrainians to forced-labour in Germany. This led to the establishment of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, a centralised partisan movement intent upon carving out a Ukrainian state between the Axis and Soviet armies. Although it ultimately failed, it showed that the idea of an independent Ukrainian state had still not perished. In fact, most of the Ukrainians who fled to the West during and after the war kept the idea of culturally and politically united Ukraine alive. = Post-War/pre-independence Ukrainian SSR = After the end of World War II, Ukraine became a prosperous Soviet republic, with high-tech industries and an educated class of elites. However, since Ukraine sported many crucial economic sectors, such as agriculture, weapons and rocket manufacturing, it was heavily garrisoned by the Soviet armed forces and attempts were made to ‚ÄúRussify‚Äù the population. These policies had an enormous impact on Ukrainian elites, many of whom became high-ranking members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, such as Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev. Religion was still persecuted, with many churches being destroyed or converted into anti-religion museums, though the Uniate church survived in Western Ukraine by going underground. In 1988, Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev began to implement his policy of glasnost, or ‚Äúopenness‚Äù. It gave Soviet citizens the freedom of speech with the specific intent of criticising corrupt Soviet officials. Political prisoners and dissidents were released while the media became less censored and controlled. Taking the cue from the Baltic nations, many other national groups within the USSR, including Ukrainians, began to demand independence from Moscow. The Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident in northern Ukraine spurred the creation of nationalist and pro-democracy groups, notably among them Rukh, or the People‚Äôs Movement of Ukraine. These groups formed the core of resurgent Ukrainian nationalism during the dying days of the Soviet Union. Though it is unknown how large of an impact these groups had in relation to the dissolution of the USSR, such nationalist groups helped shape the modern Ukrainian identity, emphasizing links to the Cossack heritage of democracy, liberalism, and religion. Independent Ukraine = Independence = The first cracks in the Soviet system began with the declaration of independence of the Baltic republics: Lithuanian, Estonia, and Latvia. On August 24, 1991, the Ukrainian SSR declared independence from the USSR and renamed itself \\"Ukraine\\". On Christmas Eve, 1991, the Soviet Union formally ceased to exist. Ukrainians domestic and abroad now found themselves in a period of flux. Under the Soviets, ethnic Russians had been sent to the national republics of the USSR: for example, in Ukraine they make up nearly a quarter of the population. This has made the creation of a modern Ukrainian identity difficult because of the lasting imprints of Russian occupation in language, government, and values. Though a universal Ukrainian identity that includes the large Russian minority is still developing, many young adults now consciously identify themselves as Ukrainian. = Citizenship laws = Besides various special status‚Äô given by successive occupying powers, Ukrainians have never had their own citizenship. Though they were recognised as a distinct ethnic and national group within the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, this served no practical purpose. With independence, Ukrainian citizenship was given out on a territorial basis, rather than on ethnicity. This civic citizenship policy was a result of conflicting ideas over Ukrainian identity advocated by the Soviet elites, the political left and right. Many left-wing parties advocated an identity that would bind all Eastern Slavs to a common political destiny, citing similar language and religion and common descent from Rus. On the political right, many saw Ukraine as possessing an ‚Äúethnic core‚Äù with which to constitute future expansion of citizenship. These ideas came together, and a legal definition of the nation was created through citizenship laws in 1991, 1997, and most recently in 2001. *1991 Citizenship Law: Those who were born on the territory of Ukraine, or at least one of whose parents or grandparents was born in Ukraine *1997 Amendment: Those who were born on or permanently resided on the territory of Ukraine, and their descendants (children, grandchildren) *2001 Citizenship Law: Those who were born or permanently resided on the territory of Ukraine, or at least one of whose parents, grandparents, a full- blood brother or sister, was born or permanently resided on the territory of Ukraine Bruaker‚Äôs theory of nationalism, which argues that every modern nation has one historically defined identity, is incompatible with the Ukrainian example. Due to the presence of a large non-Ukrainian ethnic community, a more encompassing and possibly dual definition of national identity is required. = Conclusion = A major theme in Ukrainian history is the dichotomy between the feeling of being Ukrainian and the political groups and organisations that propel the establishment of a Ukrainian nation. Though the people of Ukraine felt Ukrainian, spoke Ukrainian, worshipped and acted like Ukrainians, they were not legally Ukrainians.Armstrong, Ukrainian Nationalism, 1 What helped Ukrainian peasants and nobles feel that they were Ukrainian were their distinct religion, customs, and way of living.Armstrong, Ukrainian Nationalism, 2 What is even more influential though, is the common historical tradition that Ukrainians feel: the rise of Kyivan Rus, its fall and eventual loss of independent statehood for all Ukrainians until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.Armstrong, Ukrainian Nationalism, 4 The leaders of the Ukrainian nationalist movement in the 19th century were none other than writers, poets, and historians: the intelligentsia. Among them were Taras Shevchenko, Ivan Franko, and Muxaulo Hrushevsky. Despite the fact that the leaders of Ukrainian culture were educated, one factor helped to unify the Ukrainian mindset: socio-economic status. By and large, most Ukrainians were peasants. By default, the Ukrainian nationalist movement became a class movement as well,Armstrong, Ukrainian Nationality, 6 which is arguably one of the reasons for the lengthy existence and evolution of the Ukrainian identity in the face of foreign occupation and policies of assimilation since the fall of Kyivan Rus.

Haiti declared its independence from France in the aftermath of the first successful slave revolution in the Americas in 1804, and their identification as conquerors of a racially repressed society is a theme echoed throughout Haiti's history. Nationality prior to 1803 Haiti has a unique history of racial ideology. During its colonial period, class structure shifted from one based on wealth, to divisions distinguished by race. Once accepted as elite, families of African descent were rejected because of racist stereotypes. This regression shaped the evolution of the Haitian Revolution as peoples of African descent rose up against the white colonial planters. Haitians are primarily of African descent but a lot of Haitians are also of the indigenous Taino descent (Arawak native Indians) which inhabited the island prior to Christopher Columbus's arrival. The Taino were nearly wiped out due to diseases the Europeans brought with them and because of cruel practices including slavery. The Tainos fled to the mountains just before the Africans arrived on the island. Mixing between the remaining Tainos and some of the Africans occurred and it is believed a lot of Haitians in present-day have some ancestral links to the indigenous Tainos. =Nationality in Saint- Domingue before 1763= As part of the French Empire, nationality in Saint- Domingue, now the Republic of Haiti, was based on a mixture of economics and race, combining white planter elite, black slaves, and free black planters.Charles Mackenzie, Notes on Haiti: Made During a Residence in That Republic.

Before Haiti: Race and Citizenship in French Saint-Domingue., 3 Unlike most colonial slave societies, status was based on economics rather than race, creating a unified master class of both races. \\"Whereas the freedmen in all other slave societies entered at the lowest ranks of free society, in the French West Indies they were often permitted to enter the class of plantation owners from the beginning.\\" Herbert Klein in Garrigus, 2 Officially, imperial policy and the inequality of slavery's distribution of freedom and wealth excluded all blacks from the civil, public sphere of society. However, those with little or no official power were able to use public law to fight for their security in liberty and justice.Garrigus, 12 For example, many slaves were able to use the French Code Noir marriage provision and claim independence. There was no fine line between the races as interracial relationships were not uncommon; colonists often had sexual relations with their slaves, generally recognizing the paternity of their children and freeing them from slavery.Garrigus, 6 Men and women who escaped slavery were able to assert themselves in civil society; the opportunity to advance economically was not reserved for white Europeans. =Code Noir= Also known as \\"The Black Code\\", this set of laws was written in 1685 concerning the governance of the French American Islands. It determined and regulated the status of different social classes.Kenneth R. Redden, (ed.), \\"The Legal System of Haiti.\\" Modern Legal Systems Cyclopedia. (Buffalo, New York: William S. Hein & Co., Law Publisher, 1989), (7.210.12). King Louis XIV composed these laws to assert French presence in his Caribbean territories, and to assert Christianity and control over the free black population. Its purpose was to regulate hours of work and food distribution, limitations of punishments, and formally limit slave-owners' otherwise arbitrary power.Gordon S. Brown Toussaint's Clause: The Founding Fathers and the Haitian Revolution (Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 1936), 35. The Code expelled all Jews, forced all slaves to be baptized, and made provisions concerning the citizenship status of freed blacks. According to Article 59, emancipated blacks were to be granted the same privileges as native-born French subjects. Yet freed blacks generally suffered worse conditions than those enslaved. All blacks were considered public property, so although they were not tied to a single master, all blacks suffered under racial laws.Mackenzie, 9 *for three years all had to serve in the \\"mar√©chaussee\\" militia to catch fugitive slaves *had to serve in the general militia *obliged to a corv√©e to maintain the roadways *could not be employed publicly or in a liberal profession (for example, schoolteachers) *those of mixed races could not use the name of their white parent =Nationality after the Seven Year War= When the Seven Years' War ended in 1763, a shift in French colonists' self-identity due to the ensuing political conflicts redefined a line between the races. In an effort to reaffirm their French identity politically and culturally, white colonists defined their bond with the metropole through race. Colonists and imperial administrators created a new public sphere in by which people were unfit for civil life based on their constructed racial sexual stereotypes; those that were unfit were not allowed to practice their citizenship rights.Garrigus, 8 Resentful of black success, the colonial elite segregated themselves from their counterparts, the wealthy Creole and ex-slave families, by using race instead of wealth to classify their high level of society.Garrigus, 4 For example, everyone, regardless of wealth, who had one African grandparent had to identify themselves as \\"quarteron,\\" a person of color.Garrigus, 1 Colonial administration used racism as a tool in developing a Saint-Domingue identity. The French law of colonial citizenship being fully \\"white\\" was influenced by the enlightenment's emphasis on the purity of ‚Äòwhiteness.\\" Garrigus, 149 The French Constitution of 1791 specifically left out French territories: By excluding Haiti in this Constitution, which contained the Declaration of the Rights of Man, Haiti was denied the same rights as other French subjects. As a new definition French Citizenship was developing with the progression of the French Revolution, elite men of color began to fight for their rights as citizens. =Haitian Revolution= The development of Haitian nationality is marked by its declaration of independence on January 1, 1804. The Caribbean island won its independence from France after a period of harsh colonial rule in the first successful slave rebellion, making Haiti the second independent country in North America after the United States. As ideas of the French Revolution spread, a movement against the oppressive Black Code developed. The Free Colored Narrative In the first century after independence, descendants of the wealthy black planter elite ruled Haiti. These \\"mulatrist\\" historians supported a narrative of the Haitian Revolution that focused on the free colored revolutionaries. As their ancestors had been leaders of the revolution, it followed naturally that the superior elite planters of mixed race should lead the new Haiti. \\"Mulatrists\\" went so far as to claim they could not be guilty of racism towards the darker skinned constituency because they had suffered under French racism.Garrigus, p.13 In 1788, the Society of the Friends of the Blacks, an abolitionist group, formed in Paris to reform the harsh racial laws in Saint-Domingue. With support from wealthy free black planters such as Julien Raimond, the Society of the Friends of the Blacks took the issue to trial. Instead of outright arguing against the slave trade, Raimond and the Society campaigned for the recognition of citizenship for mixed-race colonists.Garrigus, 17 In 1791, the same Paris legislation who voted on the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen ruled in favor of the society, granting voting rights to free blacks, albeit limited voting rights. Unable to tolerate this decision as it would destabilize the slave regime, white colonialists reacted in violence, only to start a civil war with the free and enslaved black people of Haiti.Garrigus, 2 It was this \\"mulatto\\" oligarchy that led Haitians through their Revolution from France. The \\"Black\\" Revolutionary Narrative By the twentieth century, this view had shifted to focus on the slave rebellion and its ex-slave leaders like Louverture and Dessalines. This \\"black\\" Revolutionary narrative served to promote Haitian national identity, focusing on the strength of a colonial repressed society rather than its leaders. Haiti even adopted a new national anthem \\"La Dessalinienne\\", promoting the culture of the rural majority. When England and Spain invaded in 1793, they were defeated by ex-slave Toussaint Louverture, leader of the French and native army. As the white and black populations mobilized against one another, Louverture led the oppressed slaves in the Haitian Revolution, naming himself Governor-General for Life in the 1801 Constitution. Fighting between blacks and whites would continue, as Napoleon sent General Charles Lecerc to arrest Louverture and re-instate slavery. In 1803, another rebellion against the French colonists was led by Jean-Jacques Dessalines. The successful rebellion ended the civil war in 1804 with the Declaration of Haitian Independence and Dessalines was proclaimed Emperor of Haiti in 1804.Redden, (7.210.6) Foreign recognition of Haiti as a nation Recognizing Haiti as a nation was difficult for those countries that did not want to be associated with a free slave society. In dealing with foreign policy, Haiti wanted to be seen as an equal nation. Haiti granted automatic citizenship to anyone of African or Amerindian origin, and even went so far as to invite these oppressed peoples to settle in Haiti.Brenda G. Plummer, Haiti and the Great Powers, 1902-1915 (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State UP, 1988), 16. Their fight to be recognized reflects the Haitian desire to be equal, and thus free. =France= France recognized Haitian independence in 1825. This recognition was indirect, \\"masked by a degree of doublespeak that would have made Talleyrand proud\\", and only transpired after a Haiti paid huge reparations.Brown, p.294 However, Haiti was able to open normal relations with their former colonizers. =United States of America= Prior to the Haitian Revolution, Haiti had been the United States' second largest trading partner, second only to Great Britain.Brown, 293 However, in the early nineteenth century America was very much a slave society, and balked at the idea of supporting a slave revolt that took over a nation. The United States was divided; merchants wanted to continue trade while southern slave owners wanted to isolate or even repress the new Haitians.Brown, 7 Until Jean-Pierre Boyer unified Haiti in 1820, commercial relations were limited.Brown, 292 As the American Civil War progressed and the United States' stance on black liberation began to shift, so did their views of Haiti and Liberia (another free black country). As an imperialistic nation, the US had trouble with a nation that granted civil status to whom they deemed unworthy; while they had slavery, the US could not recognize Haiti.Plummer, 17 In 1863, Abraham Lincoln officially recognized Haiti and Liberia as independent and sovereign, and signed a treaty of amity and commerce in 1865. The subsequent black Haitian ambassador in Washington, D.C. was recognized as an equal in American politics.Brown, 295 Enfranchisement of Haitian peoples through law =History of the legal system= Prior to Haitian independence, Saint- Domingue was a colony under French rule, but laws were made specifically for Saint-Domingue as a colony. For example: *The Constitution of 1765 separated the military from the civil government *The Edict of August, 1765 established a judicial system However, after the 1789 Revolution, all developments in French law also pertained to Saint-Domingue as a colony came under a more direct empirical ruling. The important developments of this time period are: *The decree of April 4, 1792, which granted political equality to emancipated slaves *The decree of February 4, 1794, which abolished slavery Redden, (7.210.12) Constitutions of 1801 and 1805 Louverture's 1801 Constitution freed all slaves, but required their presence on the island as workers.Redden, (7.210.8) Similarly, Dessaline's 1805 constitution held racial laws: Haitians (all considered black) could not marry white foreigners.Redden, (7.210.7) Constitution of 1806 This ended the authoritative regime of Dessalines, creating three separate branches of government. This changed the relationship between the citizen and the state, empowering the citizen. However, the legislative branch represented by the Senate remained the most powerful. Constitution of 1816 Lasting until 1843, this constitution leveled the power of the three branches and brought in civil ideas from the French declaration in 1789 of fundamental rights.Redden, (7.210.9) Haitian Civil Code of 1825 In 1825, Haiti established the first Haitian Civil Code, adopted mainly in part from the Napoleonic Code. Two years later the Code of Civil Procedure, the Rural Code, and the Commercial Code were established; these are the foundations of Haiti's legal system today. When Riviere Harard unified Haiti, he abolished the law criminalizing Haitian and white foreign marriage. Constitution of 1918 Adopted during US occupation, this Constitution focused on property rights of foreigners. Previously, to ensure against foreign white domination, no white foreigner was permitted to own real estate. Contrastingly, all black foreigners could easily acquire Haitian nationality. In 1918, foreigners, regardless of race, could own land for business or residency purposes, losing those rights five years after that purpose ended. Constitution of 1950 Article 88 gave power directly to the citizen constituency, as the President of the Republic would now be directly voted upon by citizens. =Duvalierist constitution of 1983= Citizenship media The follow is found in Article 21: Citizenship. =Duvalierist descent= *born in Haiti to a Haitian mother or father *born in a foreign country to Haitian parents *born in Haiti to a foreign father; if not recognized by father, it is acceptable to be recognized by a foreign mother only if the subject is of black descent =Duvalierist naturalization= *after five years of residency, one may apply for naturalization, yet may not practice political rights until ten years after the date of naturalization. these political rights include: **right to participate in the election of the President of the Republic **right to defend and serve the country **right to be elected or appointed to public office Note: citizens over the age of 18 are entitled to civil and political rights; not all Haitians are citizens.Redden, (7.210.14) Article 22: Democratic Principles This article is concerned with the principle of equality for all Haitians, including but not limited to freedom of speech (except during wartime), worship and peaceful assembly (excluding public assembly which must be authorized); with an overall umbrella of individual freedoms guaranteed by the state (for example, extradition for political reasons is prohibited).Redden, (7.210.15) Haitian society Haitian society has been sharply divided since its independence in 1804. The rural agricultural sector, composing as much as 95% of the population, makes up the base of this society.Sidney W. Mintz, \\"Introduction\\" The Haitian People. By James G. Leyburn. (New Haven: Yale UP, 1966. v-xlviii), viii The elite are then left to dominate national institutions and the governmental apparatus. These two sections are kept separate by income, source of income, language, education, religion, etc. Militarism and republican nationalism formed the basis by which Haitian society was aligned, granting the elite class legitimate power.Plummer, 16 =Yeomanry= They live in rural areas, are poor, and work the land for a living. They believe in Vodou so practice common law marriage, sometimes even polygamy, and generally speak only Creole. Isolated from the outside world, these poor farmers are illiterate and uneducated. Most noticeably, they are (for the most part) darker in skin tone than the elite.Mintz, viii =Middle class= The Haitian middle class is better off financially than the yeomanry and own their own businesses and attend private educational institutions and are more literate then the yeomanry. =Elite= This merchant and professional class dominates urban society. They speak French as well as Creole (the national language) and are sent to institutions of higher learning abroad. Catholicism is the principal religion, so most marriages are religiously affiliated, thus \\"western\\" and \\"modern.\\" This elite, some dark skinned but most being lighter-skinned, view themselves as aristocracy. United States occupation Until 1915, Haiti followed an isolationist policy. However, in 1915 the United States invaded Haiti and kept occupation until 1934. During this time, interest in Haitian nationality broadened to embrace the rural majority's \\"black\\" culture. A Haitian historical society was founded in 1924, with a focus on their history through the \\"Black Slave Rebellion\\" narrative of the Haitian Revolution.Garrigus, 13 Louverture and Dessalines became \\"great slave revolutionaries\\", showing the world the power of colonized peoples. \\"By the 1970s‚Ä¶had begun to think of their homeland in terms that transcended mere nostalgic attachment to a particular outpost of empire. The new‚Ä¶ nationalism precipitates strong tensions between conservative and radical elements within local intelligentsias. Here too, the Haitian experience of the early 1900s, with its armed conflict‚Ä¶Finally, the accelerated urbanization and migration experienced in Haiti, which resulted from the centralizing tendencies of the state, import-dependency, and the extreme exploitation of labor, ‚Ä¶trends in the global economy created the impetus for a massive population exodus after World War II.\\" Plummer, 246 Since the US occupation, Haiti has been unable to establish an independent civilian police force as an entity separate from the army. Every attempt to do so has resulted in a military overthrow of the presidency.Michel S. Laguerre, The Military and Society in Haiti (Knoxville: The University of Tennessee Press, 1993), 6. Haitian Civil-Military Relations: *Military control for the protection of the state against foreign invaders *Military control for the management of a crisis *Civilian control through the demilitarization of the nation *Civilian control through the professionalization of the army *Civilian control through the co-optation of the arm *Civilian control through the democratization of the army Laguerre, The Military and Society in Haiti, 195-198. Present-day citizenship All citizenship laws in effect today are from the Constitution of Haiti ratified in 1987.The Republic of Haiti. National Legislative Bodies. Constituent National Assembly. Constitution of the Republic of Haiti. 10 Mar. 1987. . =Haitian citizenship media= Standing descent A person born in Haiti does not automatically receive citizenship. A child, regardless of where they are born, is considered Haitian if either their mother or father is a native-born citizen of Haiti. Standing naturalization Naturalization is possible, yet can only be obtained after a continuous period of Haitian residence for five years. A naturalized citizen has the right to vote, but is not eligible to hold public office until five years after their date of naturalization, excluding those offices reserved for native-born Haitians by Constitutional law. =Dual citizenship= In recent years, there has been discussion about a constitutional amendment to change Haiti's stance against dual nationality; yet while feelings have begun to lean towards acceptance of dual citizenship, policy has yet to change. Legally, the 1987 constitution still stands, which states, \\"Dual Haitian and foreign nationality is in no case permitted.\\" Constitution of the Republic of Haiti., Article 15 The constitution also automatically negates Haitian citizenship with the acquisition of foreign citizenship, which strongly affects today's Haitian diaspora. However, there is an exception.Canada. Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. Country of Origin Research. 26 Mar. 2006. . A child with Haitian parents born outside of Haiti may dually acquire the citizenship of their birth country. At the age of eighteen, the child must renounce one of their nationalities. Haiti's national gazette, Le Moniteur, indicates that dual citizenship was legalized in Haiti in June 2012, when the 1987 constitution was amended to remove the prohibition against the holding of foreign citizenship by Haitians (19 June 2012, 7). Prior to this amendment, conditions for losing citizenship included naturalization in another country or working in a political position in the service of a foreign government (Haiti 1987, Art. 13). The constitutional amendments were originally approved by legislators in May 2011 and some media sources suggested at the time that dual citizenship had been immediately legalized (TVA nouvelles 9 May 2011; Haiti libre 9 May 2011). However, the amendments did not become law until they were published in the national gazette on 19 June 2012 (JURIST 20 June 2012; The Huffington Post 19 June 2012). =Grounds for withdrawing Haitian citizenship= Article 13 of the 1987 constitution explains how Haitian citizenship can be lost. *Acquiring citizenship of a foreign country through naturalization *Serving a foreign government in office *If not a native Haitian but naturalized, residing abroad for three years without authorization. This loss is permanent Voluntarily withdrawing citizenship must take place before the Justice Department, Port-au-Prince, in Haiti. It is not possible to reclaim citizenship lost involuntarily. Haitian diaspora Transnationalism defies the common view of a state's populations remaining within its territorial boundaries. Similarly, cultural nationality is determined by a shared language, culture, believed ethnicity, etc., transcending mere residence of a geographic locality.Georges E. Fouron and Nina G. Schiller, (1999) 'Terrains of Blood and Nation: Haitian Transnational Social Fields', Ethnic and Racial Studies, (22:2, 340 ‚Äì 366), 342. The growth of transnationalism with the development of globalization has re-framed, not destroyed, the state; institutional practices and national identities are changing to adapt to the globalization of their people. Since the 1950s, there has been an increase in Haitian migration to places such as the United States to escape the political and economic repression of the Duvalier presidencies under Fran√ßois Duvalier, \\"Papa Doc,\\" (1957‚Äì71) and Jean-Claude Duvalier, \\"Baby Doc,\\" (1971‚Äì86). This migration phenomenon known as \\"the Haitian Diaspora\\" has developed to describe the thousands of Haitian nationals living outside of their territory. Generally losing their Haitian citizenship, these long distance nationals have come to act like \\"transborder citizens,\\" members to some degree of both states.Georges E. Fouron and Nina G. Schiller, Georges Woke Up Laughing: Long Distance Nationalism and the Search for Home (Durham: Duke UP, 2001), 24-27. There are legal, political, and social repercussions to this \\"transnationalism.\\" Dual citizenship is out of the question; Haitians living in a foreign country cannot get involved lest their \\"Haitianism\\" is questioned, yet by remaining faithful to their homeland, they cannot fully enjoy the citizenry benefits of the country of their sojourn. Haitian Americans have different status positions in American society based on their citizenship status: refugee, student (student visa), citizen, immigrant, visitor, and the undocumented person. These legal statuses have their own boundaries, but are not subject to influence by income or race status.Laguerre, Disaporic Citizenship, 11 =Diaspora citizenship= Citizenship practices by Haitian immigrants in the Diaspora: *those processes linking the Diaspora to the homeland are transnational in that they move beyond the boundaries of the nation-state *individual migrants hold membership in more than one country and continue to be active in homeland affairs *the ‚Äòpolitics of simultaneity,‚Äô in which citizens participate in the affairs of two or more countries at the same time, replaces the ‚Äòpolitics of secession‚Äô prevalent in the dual citizenship context *these individuals claim or appropriate civil, political, social, and cultural rights in both countries *they develop bi-polar or multiple identities that reflect the border-crossing process they experience in their everyday life.\\" Laguerre, Disaporic Citizenship, 177 =Immigration and citizenship institutions= Although these institutions may have good intentions, the political and financial instability of Haiti have restricted the potential effectiveness these programs are designed to have abroad.Peggy Levitt and Rafael de la Dehesa, Transnational migration and the redefinition of the state: Variations and explanations. Ethnic and Racial Studies ( 26(4):587-611, 2003), 601. * The Office of Diasporic Affairs: created in 1980 under Henry Namphy; moved to Office of President in 1991 under Jean-Bertrand Aristide * 10th Department Organization: elected a central committee to oversee regional Committees in cities with large Haitian immigration populations; independent yet strongly tied to Aristide's government * Ministry for Haitians Living Abroad: established in 1994 with Aristides return to regulate the relationship between Haitians living abroad and the stateLevitt, 591 The Ministry for Haitian Communities Abroad created a database in 2000 recording the technical skills of those Haitians residing abroad. The idea is that Haitians' loyalty and sense of belonging to the state ‚Äî even as emigrants ‚Äî will impel them to contribute to Haiti's national development.Levitt, 594 The emigration of these potentially productive citizens emphasized Haiti's ambivalent attitude toward the diaspora. However, money from Haitians living abroad can be hugely beneficial; in the 1990s, Haitian remittances were equal to 39 percent of Haiti's national budget.Levitt, 592 =Noteworthy cases= Lionel Jean-Baptiste, a Haitian immigrant, was stripped of his U.S. citizenship and then denied entrance to Haiti, his homeland. After being held in a detention center for a drug-related crime in 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that foreigners who could not be deported could not be held indefinitely, forcing the release of Baptiste. Baptiste was not issued a Haitian passport because by becoming a naturalized American, he had renounced his Haitian citizenship and thus was no longer considered Haitian.Immigration Korner: Haitian immigrant released after attempts to deport him.

Sparrow Hawk was the dam of only two foals, of which only The Hawk was named and raced. The Hawk was purchased as a yearling for 350 guineas by W.J.

Its content consists of some combination of text, graphics, multimedia, and executable programs, and it is normally specific to one particular computer platform or operating system. The successor to the cassette magazine was the disk magazine. Early home and hobby users of personal computers in the late 1970s and early 1980s sometimes typed in programs, usually in the BASIC language, which were published in the computer magazines of the time. This was a lot of work, and prone to error, so the idea of publishing a magazine directly on a computer- readable medium so that the programs could be run directly without typing came independently to several people. Some ideas of putting bar codes into paper magazines, which could be read into a computer with the appropriate peripheral, were floated at the time, but never caught on. Since the common data storage medium of the earliest home computers was the audio cassette, the first magazine published on a physical computer medium was cassette magazine; CLOAD magazine, for the Radio Shack TRS-80 computer, began publication in 1978, named after the command to load a program from cassette on that computer system. Shortly afterwards, in July 1978, the first issue of CURSOR magazine was released for the Commodore PET. CLOAD was not the first electronic periodical, however, because various ARPANET digests had been published as text files sent around the network since the early 1970s. These, however, were pure ASCII text and hence were not cassette magazines or disk magazines by the current definition. Also, at the time, few people outside of academic institutions had access to this forerunner of the Internet.

Most of the material in the accretionary wedge consists of marine sediments scraped off from the downgoing slab of oceanic crust, but in some cases the wedge includes the erosional products of volcanic island arcs formed on the overriding plate. An accretionary complex is a current (in modern use) or former accretionary wedge. Accretionary complexes are typically made up of a mix of turbidites of terrestrial material, basalts from the ocean floor, and pelagic and hemipelagic sediments. For example, most of the geological basement of Japan is made up of accretionary complexes. Materials within an accretionary wedge Accretionary wedges and accreted terranes are not equivalent to tectonic plates, but rather are associated with tectonic plates and accrete as a result of tectonic collision. Materials incorporated in accretionary wedges include: *Ocean-floor basalts ‚Äì typically seamounts scraped off the subducting plate *Pelagic sediments ‚Äì typically immediately overlying oceanic crust of the subducting plate *Trench sediments ‚Äì typically turbidites that may be derived from: *Oceanic, volcanic island arc *Continental volcanic arc and cordilleran orogen *Adjacent continental masses located along strike (such as Barbados). *Material transported into the trench by gravity sliding and debris flow from the forearc ridge *:olistostrome) *Piggy-back basins, which are small basins located in surface depression on the accretionary prism. *Material exposed in the forearc ridge may include fragments of oceanic crust or high pressure *:metamorphic rocks thrust from deeper in the subduction zone. Elevated regions within the ocean basins such as linear island chains, ocean ridges, and small crustal fragments (such as Madagascar or Japan), known as terranes, are transported toward the subduction zone and accreted to the continental margin. Since the Late Devonian and Early Carboniferous periods, some 360 million years ago, subduction beneath the western margin of North America has resulted in several collisions with terranes, each producing a mountain-building event. The piecemeal addition of these accreted terranes has added an average of in width along the western margin of the North American continent. Geometry The topographic expression of the accretionary wedge forms a lip, which may dam basins of accumulated materials that, otherwise, would be transported into the trench from the overriding plate. Accretionary wedges are the home of m√©lange, intensely deformed packages of rocks that lack coherent internal layering and coherent internal order.Davis, George H. Structural Geology of Rocks and Regions. (1996). pp583. The internal structure of an accretionary wedge is similar to that found in a thin-skinned foreland thrust belt. A series of thrusts verging towards the trench are formed with the youngest most outboard structures progressively uplifting the older more inboard thrusts. The shape of the wedge is determined by how readily the wedge will fail along its basal decollement and in its interior; this is highly sensitive to pore fluid pressure. This failure will result in a mature wedge that has an equilibrium triangular cross-sectional shape of a critical taper. Once the wedge reaches a critical taper, it will maintain that geometry and grow only into a larger similar triangle. Impacts of accretionary wedges USGS Visual Glossary) The small sections of oceanic crust that are thrust over the overriding plate are said to be obducted. Where this occurs, rare slices of ocean crust, known as ophiolites, are preserved on land. They provide a valuable natural laboratory for studying the composition and character of the oceanic crust and the mechanisms of their emplacement and preservation on land. A classic example is the Coast Range ophiolite of California, which is one of the most extensive ophiolite terranes in North America. This oceanic crust likely formed during the middle Jurassic Period, roughly 170 million years ago, in an extensional regime within either a back- arc or a forearc basin. It was later accreted to the continental margin of Laurasia. Longitudinal sedimentary tapering of pre-orogenic sediments correlates strongly with curvature of the submarine frontal accretionary belt in the South China Sea margin, suggesting that pre-orogenic sediment thickness is the major control on the geometry of frontal structures. The preexisting South China Sea slope that lies obliquely in front of the advancing accretionary wedge has impeded the advancing of frontal folds resulting in a successive termination of folds against and along strike of the South China Sea slope. The existence of the South China Sea slope also leads the strike of impinging folds with NNW-trend to turn more sharply to a NE-strike, parallel to strike of the South China Sea slope. Analysis shows that the pre-orogenic mechanical/crustal heterogeneities and seafloor morphology exert strong controls on the thrust-belt development in the incipient Taiwan arc-continent collision zone.Lin, Andrew T. et al. Tectonic Features Associated with the Overriding of an Accretionary Wedge on top of a Rifted Continental Margin: An Example from Taiwan.Marine Geology. Volume 255, Issues 3‚Äì4, December 5, 2008, Pages 186‚Äì203 In accretionary wedges, seismicity activating superimposed thrusts may drive methane and oil upraising from the upper crust.Calderoni, Giovanna et al. Earth and Planetary Science Letters. A Seismic Sequence from Northern Apennines (Italy) Provides New Insight on the Role of Fluids in the Active Tectonics of Accretionary Wedges. Volume 281, Issues 1-2, April 30, 2009, pages 99‚Äì109. Mechanical models that treat accretionary complexes as critically tapered wedges of sediment demonstrate that pore pressure controls their taper angle by modifying basal and internal shear strength. Results from some studies show that pore pressure in accretionary wedges can be viewed as a dynamically maintained response to factors which drive pore pressure (source terms) and those that limit flow (permeability and drainage path length). Sediment permeability and incoming sediment thickness are the most important factors, whereas fault permeability and the partitioning of sediment have a small effect. In one such study, it was found that as sediment permeability is increased, pore pressure decreases from near-lithostatic to hydrostatic values and allows stable taper angles to increase from ‚àº2.5¬∞ to 8¬∞‚Äì12.5¬∞. With increased sediment thickness (from ), increased pore pressure drives a decrease in stable taper angle from 8.4¬∞‚Äì12.5¬∞ to <2.5‚Äì5¬∞. In general, low- permeability and thick incoming sediment sustain high pore pressures consistent with shallowly tapered geometry, whereas high-permeability and thin incoming sediment should result in steep geometry. Active margins characterized by a significant proportion of fine-grained sediment within the incoming section, such as northern Antilles and eastern Nankai, exhibit thin taper angles, whereas those characterized by a higher proportion of sandy turbidites, such as Cascadia, Chile, and Mexico, have steep taper angles. Observations from active margins also indicate a strong trend of decreasing taper angle (from >15¬∞ to <4¬∞) with increased sediment thickness (from <1 to 7 km).Saffer, D. M., and B. A. Bekins (2006), An evaluation of factors influencing pore pressure in accretionary complexes: Implications for taper angle and wedge mechanics, J. Geophys. Res., 111, B04101, . Rapid tectonic loading of wet sediment in accretionary wedges is likely to cause the fluid pressure to rise until it is sufficient to cause dilatant fracturing. Dewatering of sediment that has been underthrust and accreted beneath the wedge can produce a large steady supply of such highly overpressured fluid. Dilatant fracturing will create escape routes, so the fluid pressure is likely to be buffered at the value required for the transition between shear and oblique tensile (dilatant) fracture, which is slightly in excess of the load pressure if the maximum compression is nearly horizontal. This in turn buffers the strength of the wedge at the cohesive strength, which is not pressure‚Äêdependent, and will not vary greatly throughout the wedge. Near the wedge front the strength is likely to be that of the cohesion on existing thrust faults in the wedge. The shear resistance on the base of the wedge will also be fairly constant and related to the cohesive strength of the weak sediment layer that acts as the basal detachment. These assumptions allow the application of a simple plastic continuum model, which successfully predicts the observed gently convex taper of accretionary wedges.Platt, J. (1990), Thrust Mechanics in Highly Overpressured Accretionary Wedges, J. Geophys. Res., 95(B6), 9025‚Äì9034. Pelayo and Weins have postulated that some tsunami events have resulted from rupture through the sedimentary rock along the basal decollement of an accretionary wedge.Pelayo, A., and D. Wiens (1992), Tsunami Earthquakes: Slow Thrust‚ÄêFaulting Events in the Accretionary Wedge, J. Geophys. Res., 97(B11), 15321‚Äì15337. Backthrusting of the rear of the accretionary wedge, arcward over the rocks of the forearc basin, is a common aspect of accretionary tectonics. An older assumption that backstops of accretionary wedges dip back toward the arc, and that accreted material is emplaced below such backstops, is contradicted by observations from many active forearcs that indicate (1) backthrusting is common, (2) forearc basins are nearly ubiquitous associates of accretionary wedges, and (3) forearc basement, where imaged, appears to diverge from the sedimentary package, dipping under the wedge while the overlying sediments are often lifted up against it. Backthrusting may be favored where relief is high between the crest of the wedge and the surface of the forearc basin because the relief must be supported by shear stress along the backthrust.Silver, E., and D. Reed (1988), Backthrusting in Accretionary Wedges, J. Geophys. Res., 93(B4), 3116‚Äì3126. Examples =Currently active wedges= * Mediterranean Ridge - part of the active collision zone between the African and Eurasian plates * Barbados Ridge - the South American Plate is subducting beneath Caribbean Plate * Nankai accretionary complex - the Philippine Sea Plate is subducting beneath the Amur Plate. In recent years, this is the site of attention for studying the temperature of subseafloor life and underground hot fluids in subducting zones. =Exhumed ancient wedges= *Chilean Coast Range between 38¬∞S and 43¬∞S (Bah√≠a Mansa Metamorphic Complex). *Calabrian Accretionary Wedge in the Central Mediterranean ‚Äì The Neogene tectonics of the central Mediterranean are related to the subduction and trench rollback of the Ionian basin under Eurasia, causing the opening of the Liguro‚ÄêProven√ßal and Tyrrhenian back‚Äêarc basins and the formation of the Calabrian accretionary wedge. The Calabrian accretionary wedge is a partially submerged accretionary complex located in the Ionian offshore and laterally bounded by the Apulia and Malta escarpments.Minelli, L. and C.

The mountains began to form about 35 million years ago when the Juan de Fuca Plate collided with and was forced (subducted) under the North American Plate. *Kodiak Shelf in the Gulf of Alaska ‚Äì The geology of the Chugach National Forest is dominated by two major lithologic units, the Valdez Group (Late Cretaceous) and the Orca Group (Paleocene and Eocene).Schrader, F.C., 1900, A reconnaissance of a part of Prince William Sound and the Copper River District, Alaska, in 1898: U.S. Geological 20th Anniversary Report, pt. 7, p. 341‚Äì423. The Valdez Group is part of a 2,200-km-long by 100-km-wide belt of Mesozoic accretionary complex rocks called the Chugach terrane.Jones, D.L., Siberling, N.J., Coney, P.J., and Monger, J.W.H., 1987, Lithotectonic terrane map of Alaska (west of the 141st meridian): U.S. Geological Survey Miscellaneous Field Studies Map MF 1847-A. This terrane extends along the Alaska coastal margin from Baranof Island in southeastern Alaska to Sanak Island in southwestern Alaska. The Orca Group is part of an accretionary complex of Paleogene age called the Prince William terrane that extends across Prince William Sound westward through the Kodiak Island area, underlying much of the continental shelf to the west Plafker, George, and Campbell R.B., 1979, The Border Ranges fault in the Saint Elias Mountains in Johnson, K.M., and Williams, J.L., eds., Geologic Studies in Alaska by the U.S. Geological Survey, 1978: U.S. Geological Survey Circular 804-B, p. 102‚Äì104. *Neogene accretionary wedge off Kenai Peninsula, Alaska ‚Äì Subduction accretion and repeated terrane collision shaped the Alaskan convergent margin. The Yakutat Terrane is currently colliding with the continental margin below the central Gulf of Alaska. During the Neogene the terrane's western part was subducted after which a sediment wedge accreted along the northeast Aleutian Trench. This wedge incorporates sediment eroded from the continental margin and marine sediments carried into the subduction zone on the Pacific plate.Fruehn, J., R. von Huene, and M. Fisher (1999), Accretion in the wake of terrane collision: The Neogene accretionary wedge off Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, Tectonics, 18(2), 263‚Äì277. *The Franciscan Formation of California ‚Äì Franciscan rocks in the Bay Area range in age from about 200 million to 80 million years old. The Franciscan Complex is composed of a complex amalgamation of semi-coherent blocks, called tectonostratigraphic terranes, that were episodically scraped from the subducting oceanic plate, thrust eastward, and shingled against the western margin of North America. This process formed a stacking sequence in which the structurally highest rocks (on the east) are the oldest, and in which each major thrust wedge to the west becomes younger. Within each of the terrane blocks, however, the rocks become younger upsection, but the sequence may be repeated multiple times by thrust faults. *The Apennines in Italy are largely an accretionary wedge formed as a consequence of subduction. This region is tectonically and geologically complex, involving both subduction of the Adria micro-plate beneath the Apennines from east to west, continental collision between the Eurasia and Africa plates building the Alpine mountain belt further to the north and the opening of the Tyrrhenian basin to the west. * Carpathian Flysch Belt in Bohemia, Slovakia, Poland, Ukraine and Romania represent Cretaceous to Neogene thin-skinned zone of Carpathian thrustbelt, which is thrusted over the Bohemian Massif and East European Platform.Nemcok, M., Coward, M.

Gameplay This screenshot is showing a sample game where a player-character named Nora must track down UFOs as a part of her life story. The object is to explore a city full of stores, places of employment, and learning places. Starting from home, the player must earn money and statistics in order to unlock the better features of the game. Unlike most games based on the Jinsei Game series, RPG Jinsei Game doesn't use a spinner system. Instead, the controller pad is used for movement and random encounters are featured like in Dragon Quest. The player can also talk to strangers who might either give him/her advice or do something malevolent to him/her. As in the actual Game of Life board game, the player has to choose from a series of careers ranging from a musician to a photographer and even a professional wrestler. Most of these tasks are mundane while one of the quests directly involves chasing down unidentified flying objects. Buildings that are crucial to the quest (other than shops and learning places) can be fully explored; otherwise the player simply talks to the resident. Fights can occur like in a real role-playing game. However, the players stats are used instead of hit points and magic points.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 1998 to 2001, representing the electorate of Tablelands. He was elected as one of 11 MPs of the One Nation Party at the 1998 state election, before resigning from the party to sit as an independent in February 1999. He served out the remainder of his term before being defeated by One Nation candidate Rosa Lee Long at the 2001 election. He currently serves as a Maritime Warfare Officer in the Royal Australian Navy. Early career Nelson was raised in South East, Western and Northern Queensland and joined the military at a young age, serving in the Australian Army as an operational signalman.Kingston, Margo. \\"Fans carry heroine over threshold\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 12 June 1998.\\"Hanson's revolution\\". The Australian, 15 June 1998. He initially joined the Liberal Party of Australia, but first became involved in organised politics when, at the age of 24, he was one of the founders of the Australian Capital Territory branch of the One Nation Party.Peake, Ross. \\"Hanson party plans for Canberra\\". Canberra Times, 22 May 1997. The launch of a branch by the right-wing party in liberal Canberra caused controversy, with Nelson claiming of being denied meeting venues before organising its first meetings amid public protests in July.Contractor, Aban. \\"One Nation misses out on venues\\". Canberra Times, 24 June 1997.\\"Boos and arrests at Hanson rally\\". Daily Telegraph, 9 July 1997. He was subsequently appointed as the inaugural president of the party's ACT branch.Peake, Ross. \\"ACT branch convener 'ecstatic' at roll-up\\". Canberra Times, 9 July 1997. Nelson was behind a move to have the party contest the 1998 territory election that was subsequently vetoed by national party president Pauline Hanson.Peake, Ross. \\"Hanson sits on the Canberrans who just want to stand for her\\". Canberra Times, 30 August 1997. He later resigned as branch president in December 1997, citing personal reasons, later revealed to be a marriage breakdown.Contractor, Aban. \\"One Nation looks for 'practical solution' on native title\\". Canberra Times, 30 December 1997.Contractor, Aban. \\"Former ACT One Nation boss shares in the party's spoils\\". Canberra Times, 16 June 1998. Nelson returned to Queensland after the collapse of his marriage, and was preselected as the One Nation candidate for the seat of Tablelands for the 1998 election, challenging incumbent Mines and Energy Minister Tom Gilmore. Tablelands was considered a safe seat for the rural conservative National Party, held by a margin of more than twenty percent, and Nelson was not generally considered likely to pose a serious threat to Gilmore.O'Malley, Brendan. \\"Families Minister faces fight to stay in the fold\\". The Courier- Mail, 3 June 1998. Despite having only had three months to campaign, he polled more than 42% of the vote on election day, defeating Gilmore on preferences and becoming Queensland's youngest member of parliament.Contractor, Aban. \\"Former ACT One Nation boss shares in the party's spoils\\". Canberra Times, 16 June 1998.\\"A king tide no PM could stem\\". The Australian, 15 June 1998. He declared his priorities upon his election as being the abolition of mining lease fees, the reintroduction of the death penalty, opposition to Aboriginal native title and resisting the deregulation of the dairy industry.Roberts, Greg. \\"Hanson's heroes: grab-bag politics enter parliament\\". Sydney Morning Herald, 16 June 1998.Rintoul, Stuart and Kennedy, Fiona. \\"'Little people' find their mouthpiece\\". The Australian, 17 June 1998. One Nation MP Nelson was one of four candidates for the state leadership of One Nation after the election, but lost out to Bill Feldman.Gordon, Collie. \\"One Nation elects first state executive\\". The Courier-Mail, 29 June 1998. He caused some early controversy by calling for the legalisation of prostitution in Queensland, echoing the pro-sex industry position he had taken while president of the ACT branch, in sharp opposition to the stance of new party leader Feldman.Koch, Tony. \\"One Nation MP backs legal brothels\\". The Courier-Mail, 17 July 1998.Hart, Matthew. \\"Red means stop for boutique brothels\\". The Courier-Mail, 20 July 1998. He was again the cause of some controversy later that month, when he declared on television that students protesting against One Nation were \\"being used by communists and socialists in their agenda to destroy the unity of Australia\\".\\"Qld: Student minds infected by communist poison ‚Äì One Nation\\". The Australian, 24 July 1998. Nelson was the party's nominee for speaker in the new parliament, but lost to Labor candidate Ray Hollis.\\"New MPs take seats to cries of 'ageism'\\". The Age, 29 July 1998. Along with several other One Nation MPs, he used his inaugural speech to parliament on 30 July to declare his intent to pursue further investigation of the Heiner affair, the alleged 1990 shredding of documents relating to a child abuse inquiry during the Goss Labor government.Madigan, Michael. \\"Beattie finds it's a new world without order\\". The Courier-Mail, 1 August 1998. Nelson continued to spark some controversy throughout his first months in parliament.

The Courier-Mail, 6 August 1998. He also twice made inadvertent breaches of parliamentary privileges, using the parliamentary crest on letters advertising a One Nation function and referring to himself with the \\"honourable\\" title, which as a backbencher he had not been granted.Roberts, Greg. \\"MPs under scrutiny as poll draws near\\". The Courier- Mail, 5 September 1998. He was repeatedly critical of the anti-immigrant party being labelled as racist, but was himself accused of racism after claiming that there were \\"Aboriginal children lying drunk in the gutter\\" in the north Queensland town of Mareeba.Retschlag, Christine. \\"Nelson rejects 'racist' label\\". The Courier-Mail, 17 September 1998.Day, Selina. \\"Qld: One Nation indulges in 'racist fantasies' ‚Äì minister\\". Australian Associated Press, 18 September 1998.

Australian Associated Press, 12 November 1998. He was an ardent supporter of an unsuccessful attempt by independent MP Peter Wellington to initiate citizen initiated referendums in Queensland in November 1998. Nelson was staunchly critical of the media's role in the demise of his One Nation colleague Charles Rappolt, who resigned from parliament in November 1998 before committing suicide.Day, Selina. \\"Qld: Media pushed Rappolt to the brink ‚Äì Nelson\\". Australian Associated Press, 4 November 1998. Nelson remained known for his socially conservative views, and was labelled as engaging in gay scare tactics by The Australian after claiming during the 1998 Mulgrave by- election campaign that the Beattie government would legalise same-sex marriage and allow homosexual couples to adopt children if it won the by-election, and thus majority government.McGregor, Adrian and Meade, Kevin. \\"One Nation fights poll with gay scare tactics\\". The Australian, 4 December 1998. Resignation to sit as independent Media reports of internal tensions within the party had persisted throughout late 1998 and early 1999, as the state caucus grew increasingly frustrated with a party hierarchy that saw most of the power concentrated in the hands of federal MP and party founder Pauline Hanson and her advisors David Oldfield and David Ettridge.Emerson, Scott and Saunders, Megan. \\"Sacked staffer spills beans on One Nation \`rabble'/One Nation 'on the verge of implosion'\\". The Australian, 2 September 1998. The tensions came to a head in early February 1999, when Hanson, Oldfield and Ettridge attempted to institute a national constitution locking them into absolute control of the state branches and giving them control of the party's finances. In return, the entire Queensland parliamentary party threatened to resign unless a 10-point list of demands for greater internal democracy were met. It was followed only days later by the resignations of three of the party's 10 remaining MPs ‚Äì Nelson, deputy leader Dorothy Pratt, and Ken Turner. All three announced that they would serve out the remainder of their terms as independents.Murphy, Damien, Doherty, Linda and Lagan, Bernard. \\"Hanson rocked as three MPs quit\\".

The Courier-Mail, 8 February 1999.\\"Nats 'no' to MP rebels\\". The Sunday Mail, 21 February 1999.

The Australian, 12 March 1999. Several weeks later, he had his office shifted away from his former colleagues, complaining of heightened tensions and threats being made against him.\\"MP moves to avoid brawl\\". The Australian, 14 April 1999. He was a vocal opponent of the Beattie government's decision to apologise to the victims of the Stolen Generation in May 1999, and repeatedly interjected during the reading of the apology motion into the parliamentary record, defying the speaker's orders to resume his seat.Strutt, Sam. \\"QLD ‚Äì \\"Sorry\\" move a cunning stunt, says Borbidge\\". Australian Associated Press, 25 May 1999. Despite his generally socially conservative views, he was behind an unsuccessful attempt to pass a Private Member's Bill legalising voluntary euthanasia in Queensland.Meade, Kevin and Nason, David. \\"MPs to debate euthanasia\\". The Australian, 15 June 1999.

The Australian, 21 July 1999. Nelson continued to maintain a reputation as a conservative maverick as an independent MP, and in September 1999, called for the introduction of conscription for the long-term unemployed to supplement Australia's then-peacekeeping operation in East Timor.\\"Unemployed should be conscripted for Timor force: Australian MP \\". Agence France-Presse, 24 September 1999. Although he had earlier supported proposals to legalise prostitution in the state, he voted against such moves by the Beattie government in December 1999, arguing that the laws would be impossible to enforce.Balogh, Stefanie. \\"No store set by boutique brothels\\". The Courier- Mail, 3 December 1999. He caused some controversy in May 2000 when, along with Dorothy Pratt, he was suspended from parliament for 28 days and threatened with expulsion for pouring a milk churn down the stairs of parliament during a protest against the deregulation of the dairy industry. This meant that Nelson had spent more days suspended from the house than any other MP in more than 25 years.Balogh, Stefanie. \\"MP in danger of losing her seat\\". The Courier-Mail, 1 June 2000.Morley, Peter. \\"Out! Milkman Nelson heads Wild Bunch\\". The Sunday Mail, 4 June 2000. Nelson recontested his seat as an independent at the 2001 state election, and faced a three-way battle with National Party candidate and local councillor Joe Moro and endorsed One Nation candidate Rosa Lee Long, the president of the party's Tablelands branch and a former Nelson campaign worker.Low, Marie, Blakesley, Lea and Paterson, Duncan. \\"Poll line-Up\\". The Cairns Post, 31 January 2001.

The Cairns Post, 8 February 2001.Low, Marie. \\"The battle for Tablelands\\". Cairns Post, 14 February 2001. He subsequently won only 15 percent of the vote, finishing fourth overall behind the One Nation, Labor and National candidates, with One Nation candidate Long the victor.

Paolo Antonio Barbieri (1603‚Äì1649) was an Italian painter who was the brother of Guercino. He was born at Cento, a village near Bologna. The subjects of his pictures are flowers, fruit, and game, but he particularly excelled in painting fish, which he represented with astonishing fidelity.  Biography  He was born in Cento, near Bologna, in 1603. He devoted himself to painting under the guidance of his brother, who sometimes added figures to his paintings, such as the figure of the fisherman in a still life of fish, or that of the gardener in a fruit composition. From the school of Guercino he learnt to use chiaroscuro and the vivacity of color, but - following a natural inclination - he dedicated himself to the \\"minor\\" genre of naturalistic painting, portraying landscapes, objects of common life, animals, flowers, fruit and still lifes, with a marked taste of composition and color. The delicate trait and the striking vividness of his paintings brought him considerable fame. Guercino mourned his premature death, which took place in Bologna in 1649. According to his diary, more than forty works belonged to him: some in the Galleria Costabili in Ferrara (two paintings of hunting with live and dead animals, and three of fruit and game), others in Cento (Tiazzi house, Municipal Art Gallery), in Modena (Galleria Campori and Galleria Coccapani), in Bologna (Pinacoteca, Gualandi collection) and in Rome (a painting in the Galleria Corsini).

The ship served as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. After the war she was discarded and broken up. The ship was named for Windsor, Ontario but due to conflicts with other ships with that name, the actual name of the ship was chosen to commemorate the city, instead of naming it directly. Border Cities was ordered 12 December 1941. The vessel was laid down on 26 August 1942 by Port Arthur Shipbuilding Company Ltd. at Port Arthur, Ontario and launched 3 May 1943. The ship was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 18 May 1944 at Port Arthur. Background The class to which she belonged had been designed to overcome certain weaknesses which had been revealed in actual operation in the earlier . The relatively limited steaming radius of the Bangor class lessened its usefulness as the war progressed.It was pointed out at the 57th Meeting of the Naval Staff, 25 September 1941, that \\"the steaming radius of the Bangor Class Minesweeper was most disappointing (being only 2300 miles at 11 knots).\\" (Naval Staff Minutes, 57th Meeting, 25 September 1941 (Held by VCNS.) Quoted NHS 8000: Minesweepers (Bangor) General.) With the laying of mines in ever-deeper waters, swept areas had to be extended and, for this, a ship with greater endurance was desirable. This class of ship, too, lacked the space to conveniently accommodate the new types of equipment which were being added. It was for these reasons that, in 1941, the Admiralty began to develop a ship which eventually supplanted the earlier minesweepers in the construction programmes and was known as the Algerine minesweeper first and, later, coastal escort.Tucker, p.67 Like the Bangor class, the Algerine was prepared to function either as an anti- submarine escort or a minesweeper. However, when it became apparent that the submarine posed a greater danger than the mine in the areas for which the Royal Canadian Navy was responsible, a greater emphasis came to be laid on the former.Tucker, p. 77 Again, compared to the Bangors, the Algerines were a longer ship by 45 feet and it had over 1,500 miles greater endurance at 12 knots. It could therefore carry more men and equipment and had a longer range. In October 1941, the Naval Service decreed that from thenceforth the Algerine class should be ordered for construction. Approval was given at the same time for the building of thirty frigates and ten of the Algerine class. Among the latter was Border Cities. The entire Canadian contingent of the Algerine class was to be built by the Port Arthur Shipbuilding Co of Port Arthur, Ontario.Tucker, p. 509 Service history =Commissioning= On 24 March 1943, the shipbuilding firm stated that the ship, CN-366, was ready for launching but that it would be necessary, because of ice conditions, to postpone it until at least 15 or 20 April. It was desirable that certain guests should be invited for the accompanying ceremony, particularly dignitaries from the sponsoring city of Windsor. Unfortunately, this was not done, as the launching of a ship had been required as a part of a Victory Loan ceremony held on 3 May 1943 and the shipyard picked Border Cities for the performance.NS 4052-374/1 The ship had been named for Windsor, Ontario, or, more strictly, for the adjoining \\"Border Cities\\" of East Windsor, Walkerville, Windsor and Sandwich, which had been amalgamated into one city, Windsor, by the Amalgamation Act of 1935. Since the name Windsor was already borne by a British destroyer, the Board of Trade of the City had suggested the use of Border Cities and the name had been submitted by Mayor Reaume. The City's Rotary Club stated that if the suggestion were accepted, the club would be prepared to adopt the ship and provide comforts to the ship's company by way of extra equipment not supplied by the Naval Service, to the extent of $500 initial expenditure and $250 annually for the duration of the war. Once the name had been accepted, prominent citizens of Windsor pointed out that it would be a happy event if the ship could be commissioned in their city. The distillery firm of Hiram Walker and Sons, Ltd, had excellent docking facilities in Walkerville and arrangements could be made with them if the Department were agreeable to use them for the ceremony. Attached to the docks were lawns which were quite spacious and lovely, with a balcony which would lend itself nicely for the occasion. As a precedent, it was maintained that the Bangor-class minesweeper, , which had been built by the Dufferin Shipbuilding Co of Toronto, had been commissioned at Westmount, Quebec. It was pointed out to these enthusiastic citizens, however, that Westmount had been commissioned in Toronto and had later paid a visit to Westmount. It was further pointed out that she could not have been sailed by the navy if she had not been commissioned first. For the same reason, Border Cities would have to be commissioned in Port Arthur. Presumably, though, the ship could visit Windsor for a similar dedication ceremony while passing through the lakes.NS 1057-1-21 So the ship was commissioned on 18 May 1944 at Port Arthur. Before this date she had carried out full power, endurance, steering, anchor and going astern trials. All these had proved to be satisfactory.Director Naval Plans and Operations (DNPO) Cards. =Battle of the Atlantic ‚Äì 1944= Two days following the commissioning, the ship left Port Arthur, steaming through Lakes Superior and Huron to Sarnia, where she arrived on the 22nd. Held up by fog, she did not leave this port until 0600, the 23rd. She then went on to Windsor where she found all preparations made to receive her. At the Hiram Walker dock in Walkerville, a presentation of gifts was made to her. These gifts had been stored in a warehouse on the dock and among them were such articles as a washing machine, electric irons, radios, phonographs, musical instruments, ash trays, games, toilet articles, kitchen utensils, writing materials and magazines. That she might be seen and inspected by the citizenry, the ship, following the presentation, proceeded to the Government Dock in Windsor. In the evening, officers and men were feted at the Prince Edward Hotel. The following day, the ship was open to the public and she departed in the early evening.NS 8000-374/1. ‚Äì NS 4052-374/1. Steaming on her way, she passed through Lake Erie into Lake Ontario to Toronto, which she reached on the 20th. Off the Queen City she carried out gun and depth charge trials. They were satisfactory although one of her depth charges failed to explode. The failure was promptly reported to authorities. When she left Toronto on the 30th, trials were carried out with the hedgehog, the bomb- throwing mortar which was used as an extra anti-submarine battery along with the depth charge throwers. Montreal was raised on 1 June 1944 and the ship remained in the port until the 6th when she went to Quebec City to embark ammunition and carry out further trials. From Quebec on 14th, she proceeded down river to the Gulf. The Straits of Canso between Cape Breton and the mainland of Nova Scotia were negotiated, the town of Mulgrave being passed on the 16th. The day following this, the ship reached Halifax, her operational base, where she prepared herself to take her part in the great international struggle to maintain the country's freedom. The day following arrival, she commenced a refit. One of the chief undertakings included in it was the fitting in her of H/F D/F equipment.The H/F D/F or High-Frequency Direction- Finding equipment. It was pronounced \\"Huff-Duff\\" and could pick up from land or ship the radio transmissions of U-boats at sea. \\"Radar furnished the convoys with a cat's eye, sonar with its ears, while the high-frequency direction finders‚Ä¶acted as a highly sensitive and elongated cat's whiskers.\\" A generator, being defective, also required attention. Border Cities passed the month of July 1944 in Bermudan waters, engaged in working-up exercises. She left Halifax on the 8th and did not return until 3 August. Two days before her return, she had been allocated to the Western Escort Force for duty with the escort group, W-2.There were 7 \\"W\\" groups on October 1944. In December of the same year, the number was increased to 8 and, on 27 April 1945, to 9. (NHS 8440-130). The Western Escort Force was based in Halifax and was employed in escorting eastbound convoys as far as WESTOMP, the western ocean meeting- point. This was on or about Longitude 52o West, thus east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Here, the escorts of the Force were relieved by ships of the Mid-Ocean Escort Force. Turning around, they picked up a westbound convoy and returned with it to Halifax or New York.NHS 8440-130. See also pertinent notes in Samuel E Morison: Op. Cit. On 12 August 1944, Border Cities steamed to St. Margaret's Bay, near Halifax, to be taken in hand for H/F D/F calibration. On the 19th, she left Halifax and, after some exercising with other ships, proceeded to New York where she, in company with her group, picked up her first convoy, HXF-305.An HX convoy ran from New York to the United Kingdom. Earlier, its starting point had been Halifax, which accounts for the \\"H\\" in its designation. The \\"F\\" qualifies it as a fast, while an \\"S\\" indicates that it was a slow convoy. An extra \\"H\\" before the designation refers to the Halifax section of the main HX convoy. It was accompanied to HOMP, a position fixed according to the individual convoy, where Western Escort groups from the south were relieved by others from the north or vice versa. On this occasion, W-2 was relieved by W-3 and then returned to Halifax. HXF-305 was later turned over to the mid-ocean group, C-5, . On 8 September, it was attacked by U-boats, which sank, with heavy loss of life, a large British tanker, SS Empire Heritage, and, a half hour later, a rescue ship, HMS Pinto, who had been engaged in picking up survivors.NHS 8280: HXF-305; RCN-RCAF Monthly Operational Review for September 1944, p 7; Convoy Books (NHS). Border Cities had joined W-2 as Senior Officer of the group. When, on 2 September 1944, she left Halifax with Convoy HHXS-306, she had as fellow members, the corvettes, , , and . The mid-ocean escort C-1, sailed out from St. John's and emerged on the 12th, to meet ONS-251.The ON convoys reversed the direction taken by the HX convoys, making the passage from the British Isles to North America. As with the HX convoys, the added \\"F\\" and \\"S\\" refer to fast and slow convoys. Orillia detached with ships for Halifax and the rest went on to New York. One of Orillias charges was a rescue ship laden with survivors. The convoy had been shepherded across the ocean by Escort Group, C-4. Soon after nightfall on the 2nd, about 90 miles north-west of Londonderry, what appeared to be a lone U-boat sank the Norwegian steamship Fjordheim. Thirty-five of the crew of thirty-eight were picked up, thirty-three by and the other two by a merchant ship, Empire Mallory. They were later transferred to a rescue ship, SS Fastnet, and so taken to Halifax.NHS 8440: C-4. vol 2; RCN-RCAF Monthly Operational Review for September 1944, p 21 After leaving ONS-251 at New York, W-2 turned around and went northward with HXF-310. Relieved by W-3, the ships entered Halifax on the 25th. Another convoy escorted during September 1944 was HHX-311. Convoys ON-256, HX-315 and HHX-316 received the close support of the Group during October. Border Cities and her group escorted ON-261 and HX-320 during the first part of November 1944. From the 22nd to 26th, the ship was in Shelburne, Nova Scotia, having defects attended to. Sailing independently, she rejoined the others, assuming as before the duties of Senior Officer. They were escorting ONS-36 at the time. The accompanying of XB-136XB convoys ran from Halifax to Boston and BX convoys in the reverse direction. Bay of Fundy ports might be included in these runs. took the ship, with Orillia and Midland, to Boston in December. They came away from the port with convoy BX-136. Other convoys escorted during the month were HHX-320 and ON-272. The latter was badly scattered on the 28th and 29th, when it was necessary to heave to in heavy weather. One ship, Jamaica Planter, was lost from HX-320 but this was by collision. W-2 formed the convoy's Local Northern Escort. There were also a Local Southern, a Support Group and a Mid-Ocean escort. On the 17th, , a member of the support groupWhile the duty of the close escort was to remain with the convoy in a defensive role, the ships of the support groups gave added defence only, and were free to range far and wide in offensive action against U-boats in the vicinity. for HX-320, picked up an H/F D/F bearing on an enemy submarine. Border Cities did likewise the following day, as well as and of the support group. It was estimated that the transmissions originated with a U-boat some thirty miles away. A few days later-the 26th and 30th- when with ON-272, Border Cities reported more recordings of U-boat transmissions, and again on 6 January 1945, when with HX-330.NSS 8910-9 =Battle of the Atlantic ‚Äì 1945= W-2 joined HX-330 on 3 January 1945 at New York after leaving ON-272 in that port. With Border Cities were Orillia, Midland, , and . On the 4th, hedgehog and depth charge attacks made by Midland on a contact, brought up oil which took fire. Border Cities, the Senior Officer's Ship, considered that the contact had been bounced off a wreck, although she admitted that the existence of one in the position was not confirmed by chart. Midland remained with her contact until daylight the next morning. On the 14th, Border Cities joined other ships to search for a killer U-boat in the Halifax approaches. The 20-ship convoy BX-141, while under escort of Westmount and , and support group, EG-27 ‚Äì was attacked just off Chebucto Head while the convoy was entering harbour in single line ahead. The tanker, British Freedom, was hit on the port side of the engine room. She began to settle at once and had to be abandoned. A US liberty ship, SS Martin Van Buren, was then torpedoed aft, and a British tanker, Athelviking, received a similar wound. Both tankers eventually sank, while the liberty ship drifted ashore in the vicinity of Ketch Harbour. and carried out attacks on contacts without visible results.NS 1926-102/1, vol. 1 A search was instituted, with aircraft assisting the ships. From Halifax, Border Cities steamed out with instructions to take several ships under her orders. The search was an unsuccessful one. It continued until the 23rd, but Border Cities was engaged with it only for the day. She then went to join her group to escort from Halifax Convoy HHX-332. At HOMP, the main body of the convoy was met and W-2 remained with it until relieved the next day by Escort Group C-7. W-2 proceeded to St. John's, while the convoy sailed out across the ocean. On the 27th, it was attacked and the Norwegian tanker, Solor, and the US steamship, Ruben Dario, were torpedoed. The damaged ships were able, however, to reach harbour.NHS 8280: HHX-332 ONS-40 was met on the 25th. This convoy was badly scattered by strong winds, but was able to reform with improving weather. XB-144 was escorted to Boston and, in February 1945, BX-144. On 14 February 1945, W-2 left Halifax with HHX-338. The subsequent voyage was a routine one, although Border Cities obtained a bearing on a doubtful submarine on the 16th. The group was met on the 17th by the mid-ocean group C-5. Since the ship had to pass over convoy papers to the frigate, she approached her and attempted to maintain a position sufficiently close to her to fire the papers across to her by gun. The attempt was unsuccessful, due to heavy following seas and violent squalls. Because of a wind which was dead astern, Border Cities could not steer well. The ships then went out clear of the convoy and both headed into the wind. being a better steerer under such conditions, approached the minesweeper from the starboard quarter and succeeded in putting a line aboard her quarterdeck. Here, a canister containing the secret documents was attached to the line. Suddenly a violent snow and wind squall struck. Border Cities appeared to be lifted bodily backwards and to starboard on the crest of a great wave. The ships were then about fifty yards apart. Runnymedes helm was put to starboard 30 and speed increased to 13 knots in order to sheer off. The next wave carried Border Cities closer. When it became evident that the ship could not control her steering and was being carried toward the frigate, the latter stopped her engines, as the speed was causing violent pitching and a smother of breaking seas, blotting everything from view. Before the frigate could drop sufficiently behind, however, Border Citiess transom corner struck the other's port bow at the forecastle deck edge, causing damage to plating and leaving a hole at the edge of the deck. Border Cities herself was undamaged. A damage control party in Runnymede plugged the hole. But the attempt to transfer the documents had to be abandoned. Runnymede received them finally from the Commodore of the convoy the next day when the weather had moderated. The frigate crossed the ocean with the convoy and, when she reached Londonderry, had temporary repairs carried out on her bow in Harland and Wolf's shipyard in the North Irish city.NSC 8180-381/45 A convoy escorted in March 1945 was HHX-344.Other convoys escorted during March 1945 were HX-342, ONS-44, XB-154 and BX-154. This was a 20 ship section of a convoy which, when complete, had 74 ships. The British ship, Fort Gaspereau, who had started out from Halifax, was unable to maintain speed with the others due to poor fuel stored in her bunkers, and had to detach on the 17th. Napanee escorted her back to Halifax. Border Cities and her group continued with their escorting duties through April and May 1945. Because of the decelerated pace of the war, culminating on 8 May 1945 with orders broadcast from German High Command for all U-boats at sea to surrender, they were of a routine nature. Convoy ON-301, picked up out of St. John's on 16 May, was Border Citiess last. After she and her group sailed with it to New York, they remained for a week in the port and then sailed on the 29th without convoy for Halifax. =Postwar service= Back to base, Border Cities prepared herself for a short refit, which began on 1 June 1945 and lasted until the 14th. She had several defects which urgently required attention. For several months, in fact, a full scale refit had been proposed for her, first plans having named Liverpool, Nova Scotia for the site, and later ones Saint John, New Brunswick. The end of hostilities and probable early disposal of the ship put an end to these plans. On 8 June 1945, the ship was formally transferred from the Western Escort Force and Escort Group W-2 to the Halifax Force. Following her refit, she was sailed to the Halifax approaches to search for a wreck. This was the wreck of . The Royal Canadian Navy's last victim of the submarine, the Bangor class vessel had been torpedoed off Halifax on 16 April 1945 with the loss of 39 men. The wreck had never been found and, on 16‚Äì17 June 1945 and again on the 19th, in the latter case being assisted by , Border Cities carried out an intensive search. Each day of the search, an ASDIC expert, Lieutenant R A Nairn (a/s), RCNVR, was embarked. The searchers were fortunate in that weather and water conditions were favourable on all occasions. Every effort was made to use any information, such as survivors' reports, which might be helpful toward the end of locating the wreck. The Halifax East Light Vessel No 6, which had been accurately fixed and used as a datum point for the search, was closed and inquiries made from the Captain where he estimated the sinking had taken place. Many ASDIC echoes were investigated. Echo sounder traces had been made off boulders on the bottom, and some looked promising; when crossed, however, on a course at right angles to the initial run-over, all proved to be false. The search was successful in so far as it was thorough and left no doubt that detection by any future search would be purely a matter of chance.Reports of Proceedings of BORDER CITIES in NS 1156-442/18. At the close of June 1945, Border Cities made a voyage to Bermuda. After embarking service personnel for passage, she left Halifax in the early hours of the 30th. After passing two days in the islands she left on 4 July to return to Halifax. Later in the month, on the 12th, Border Cities made a short cruise with Winnipeg. They left Halifax for Liverpool, Nova Scotia with the intention of visiting St. Andrew's, New Brunswick. and Yarmouth and Chester in Nova Scotia. The unfavourable weather, however, induced a change of plan and the last-named place alone was visited. The end, however, seemed to be looming larger and, in fact, the ship received orders to sail to Sydney on the 22nd. There she was to come under the Naval Officer in Charge in that port, the transfer to his administration being effected on the same date. The following day, 23 July 1945, she being then in the Cape Breton port, the ship was paid off into maintenance reserve, and Lieutenant-Commander Young relinquished command. She was not permitted to rust away in Sydney. On 7 September 1945, it was announced that she would sail to the west coast in the company of several other Algerine minesweepers. Pursuant to this decision, sufficient ratings to enable the ship to be steamed to Esquimalt, were drafted from Halifax to Sydney, and the ship was recommissioned with Lieutenant J. Butterfield, RCNR, in command, on 24 October 1945. The next day, she departed from Sydney in company with four other Algerines. Their immediate destination was Halifax. Here they completed storing for the long passage to Esquimalt. Border Cities required some repairs as well. The group proceeded to Shelburne in November 1945, to complete ammunitioning. Border Cities took this route on the 6th, the day following that on which the final touch was given to her repairs. In company with she arrived in Shelburne on the 8th. The same day, she was transferred from the administration of the Naval Officer in Charge, Sydney, to that of the Commanding Officer Pacific Coast, with her accounting base changed from to . On 10 November 1945, the minesweepers steamed out of Shelburne, their bows pointed toward southern waters. There were five of them in the group. After seven days, they arrived at Kingston, Jamaica, where they remained until the 20th. Cristobal, in the Canal Zone, was the next port visited. From here, on the 26th, they entered the Canal. Border Cities at this time was having trouble with her evaporator and, one day, Rockcliffe had to transfer 19 tons of fresh water to her. At Balboa on the 27th, the ships turned their bows northward in the Pacific. , however, was held up in the port for nineteen hours due to minor damage sustained during the transit of the Canal. She rejoined on the 30th. The voyaging ships called at Salina Cruz on 4 December 1945, and stopped in San Pedro, California, from the 11th to 17th. Finally, all five arrived at Esquimalt at 0015, 21 December 1945. In Esquimalt on 15 January 1946, Border Cities was paid off into maintenance reserve, becoming a tender to the depot ship, . On 1 February, she was allocated to the Reserve Fleet.NSS 8355-374/1. In March, it was decided to fit minesweeping gear in two of the Algerines. The two ships chosen for the purpose were Border Cities and Sault Ste. Marie. Several of the Algerine class minesweepers were docked in early 1947. Of these, it was stated that Border Cities was in the worst condition. She had already been tentatively selected for disposal, but it was noted that she was one of the two ships fitted with minesweeping gear, and this seems to have caused some hesitation. In the end it was decided to transfer the gear to another of the class, and, in March 1947, she was declared surplus to requirements. On the 3rd, she ceased to be a tender to Givenchy, her pay, victualing and store accounts being transferred from the depot ship to Rockcliffe. On 26 May 1947, the Naval Staff approved the policy of retaining two Algerine-class minesweepers on each coast fitted with Oropesa minesweeping gear.Minutes of 375th Naval Staff Meeting: NS 8000-374/1. had been picked to be one of these ships and preparations were begun to transfer Border Citiess equipment to her. Nor was this all that was removed from Border Cities, orders having already been issued that all armament and other stores were to be taken off ships, which had been declared surplus, before they were turned over to the Government disposal agency, the War Assets Corporation.NS 8000-374/1/. On 18 April 1947, the ship was recommended for disposal by the Naval Surplus Disposal Committee at Esquimalt. Once she had been accepted by War Assets Corporation, she was towed to Bedwell Bay in Vancouver Harbour, where she, along with another ship picked for disposal, , was secured to trots. She was bought by a Victoria firm, Wagner, Stein and Greene Co. The sale was effected in January 1948. The last report of the ship stated that on this date the ship was still in port pending disposal.NS 8000-30, Vol.4 Commanding officers * Lieutenant B.P.

He was the son of Robert Taft Sr., the first American Taft, of the famous Taft family, and Sarah Simpson. Reports differ as to whether he was born in Ireland or Braintree. Early life and marriage Robert lived the earliest part of his life at Braintree until he was age 6, when his father moved back to the western part of Mendon, Massachusetts, following King Philip's War. This part of town later became the town of Uxbridge. Robert Taft Jr. married Elizabeth Woodard of Braintree, Norfolk County. Robert and Elizabeth had 11 children together: Elizabeth (b. 1695), Robert III (b. 1697), Israel (b. 1699), Mary (b. 1700), Jemimah (b. 1702), Elizabeth (b. 1704), Alice (b. 1707), Eunice (b. 1709), John (b. 1710), Jane (b. 1712), Jemima (b. 1713), Gideon (b. 1715), and Rebecca (b. 1717). At the first March meeting of Uxbridge in 1727, Robert was chosen first selectman. He continued to figure in the town affairs, having undoubted weight and influence for a few years, when he gave up that kind of ambition to his son Captain John.

Israel Taft, of Upton, Robert's second-born son, had nineteen children, one of whom was Samuel Taft. In 1789, Samuel was the proprietor of a tavern in Uxbridge. This tavern is now known as Samuel Taft House. The newly elected President of the United States, George Washington, stayed one evening with Samuel Taft and his family. Significance in history Robert Taft Jr. was a founder and founding Selectman on the first Board of Selectmen, of the colonial town of Uxbridge, in Worcester County, Massachusetts. The town of Uxbridge was incorporated as a separate town from Mendon in 1727. Robert Taft Jr. was the first known elected political figure in the famous Taft family, a dynasty in American politics. A prominent citizen of Mendon and Uxbridge, Robert Taft Jr. died in Uxbridge, Worcester County, in 1748. His descendants number among well-known Americans and political figures, especially among the Taft family in Ohio.

Assigned as a mine-layer boat for the North Atlantic Blockade  Equipped as a torpedo boat, on 20 July Martin was assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron for picket guard duty. On 27 July she was taken in tow along with sister tug Hoyt by screw steamer Monticello for convoy from Hampton Roads, Virginia at Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina, arriving 2 days later.  Operations in the North Carolina waterways  Martin operated in the sounds of North Carolina, through 1864. On 29 September she accompanied gunboat Valley City up the Scuppernong River to head off a group of Confederate conscriptors being chased by two Union Army steamers from the vicinity of the Alligator River. With Martin‚Äôs assistance as a tug, Valley City was able to position her guns on the stragglers with telling results. Martin later joined in the operations which led to the capture of Plymouth, North Carolina, between 29 October and 1 November.  End-of-war operations and decommissioning and sale  After overhaul at Norfolk Navy Yard in early 1865, Martin returned to the sounds of North Carolina, in late February. She continued tug and picket duties through May before sailing north in June, to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for decommissioning. Martin was sold there 10 August.

The vessel was discarded in 1974 and broken up for scrap. Design and description The reciprocating group displaced at standard load and at deep load The ships measured long overall with a beam of . They had a draught of . The ships' complement consisted of 85 officers and ratings.Lenton, p. 261 The reciprocating ships had two vertical triple- expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . They carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave them a range of at . The Algerine class was armed with a QF Mk V anti-aircraft gunChesneau, p. 65 and four twin-gun mounts for Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. The latter guns were in short supply when the first ships were being completed and they often got a proportion of single mounts. By 1944, single-barrel Bofors 40 mm mounts began replacing the twin 20 mm mounts on a one for one basis. All of the ships were fitted for four throwers and two rails for depth charges. Many Canadian ships omitted their sweeping gear in exchange for a 24-barrel Hedgehog spigot mortar and a stowage capacity for 90+ depth charges. Construction and career Fort Frances was ordered on 25 November 1942 as part of the 1943 building program. The minesweeper was laid down on 11 May 1943 by Port Arthur Shipbuilding Company Ltd. at Port Arthur, Ontario and launched on 30 October. The ship was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 28 October 1944 at Port Arthur.Macpherson & Barrie, p. 195 After working up in Bermuda in January 1945, Fort Frances returned to Halifax, Nova Scotia and joined the Western Escort Force convoy escort groups W-8 and W-9 for short periods before the end of the war in Europe. The minesweeper was paid off into maintenance reserve on 3 August 1945. The ship was recommissioned on 23 October 1945 and this deployment lasted until 5 April 1946, when Fort Frances was paid off for the final time. In 1948, Fort Frances was transferred to the Department of Mines and Technical Surveys for use as a hydrographic ship. In 1958 she was converted into an oceanographic survey ship. Three laboratories were installed along with the ability to carry up to eight scientists, her main purpose being underwater acoustic research. Fort Frances served in this duty until she was sold in 1974 for scrap and broken up. In 2009, Fort Frances was presented with a framed history of the ship in commemoration of the Canadian Naval Centennial.

In 1870 Hierholzer wrote his habilitation about conic sections (title: Ueber Kegelschnitte im Raum) in Karlsruhe, where he later became a Privatdozent. Hierholzer proved that a connected graph has an Eulerian trail if and only if exactly zero or two of its vertices have an odd degree. This result had been given, with no proof of the 'if' part, by Leonhard Euler in 1736. Hierholzer apparently presented his work to a circle of fellow mathematicians not long before his premature death in 1871. A colleague then arranged for its posthumous publication in a paper that appeared in 1873.  References  * C. Hierholzer: Ueber Kegelschnitte im Raume. (Habilitation in Karlsruhe.)

It took place near the village of Osuchy in the Solska Forest (Puszcza Solska) on 25‚Äì26 June 1944 during the German anti-partisan Operation Sturmwind II (Operation Hurricane II). The battle ended with the defeat of the local resistance forces that suffered heavy casualties.Martin Gilbert, Second World War A Complete History, Holt Paperbacks, 2004, , Google Print, p.542 Background The Nazi terror since 1942 - part of the Generalplan Ost - in the Zamo≈õƒá region in occupied Poland had led to the creation of many active resistance units. Polish partisans (from Armia Krajowa, Bataliony Ch≈Çopskie and Armia Ludowa) - with the aid of some Soviet partisans - made the region almost ungovernable to the Germans. The German garrison in the key city of Bi≈Çgoraj was mostly cut off from land communication with other forces; the town of J√≥zef√≥w was under resistance control, as were many villages and wilderness regions. Vital German communication lines with the units at the Eastern Front were in peril, and many troops were diverted from the front to deal with the partisans. The Germans carried out a major security operation in early June, Operation Sturmwind I (German for 'Storm-Wind'). This operation, however, failed to defeat the partisans, who broke out of an encirclement in the Jan√≥w Forests (Lasy Janowskie) (according to some estimates, Germans suffered higher casualties than the resistance in Sturmwind I). Some partisan units moved to the Solska Forest and the Germans decided to start another operation - Operation Sturmwind II - to eliminate them. By 15 June most of the Forest was surrounded; the partisan leaders assumed that the Germans would not enter it, but were proven wrong when on 21 June, after artillery and air bombardment, German forces started to advance. On the 22 June the Armia Ludowa unit, numbering about 700, broke through the German lines in the area of G√≥recko Ko≈õcielne village, suffering heavy casualties. Soviet partisans under Lt. Col. Nikolai Prokopiuk - about 1900 people - tried to break free on the night of 22 to 23 June around Hamernia village; they failed, but succeeded the following night in the area near the Borowiec and Huta R√≥≈ºaniecka villages. Although Polish and Soviet commanders met, they were unable to agree on a common plan (various sources blame different sides). By then only the combined Armia Krajowa and Bataliony Ch≈Çopskie units under Major Edward Markiewicz \\"Kalina\\" - about 550 people - remained within the closing circle. The partisans were exhausted, pushed into a swampy area, 6 by 4 km, between the Tanew and Sopot rivers. The commander of the remaining partisans, Mjr. Markiewicz, suffered a nervous breakdown, transferred his command to Rotmistrz Mieczys≈Çaw Rakoczy \\"Miecz\\", and committed suicide. Rakoczy in turn transferred the command to Lt. Konrad Bartoszewski \\"Wir\\" who decided that the partisans' only hope was to break through along the Sopot river toward Bi≈Çgoraj. German losses in Sturmwind operations amounted to about 1,300 fatalities and similar amount of wounded; partisan losses were similar.

Jan Kryk \\"Topola\\" (AK) and Lt. Jozef Mazur \\"Skrzypik\\" (BCh) attempted to break through the road near the villages Fryszarka and Borowiec, but were stopped by the German forces and dispersed; both commanders died. In the meantime, the main partisan forces reached the village of Osuchy near the Sopot river. On the dawn of 25 June, they launched an assault on the German line. The Germans, however, had fortified their position; the partisans of Mjr. Stanis≈Çaw Basaj \\"Ry≈õ\\" encountered a minefield, and found themselves under German machine gun fire. Soon, the Germans received artillery support. Finding themselves outgunned, the partisans retreated, suffering heavy casualties. The partisan unit under Lt. Jan Kƒôdra \\"B≈Çyskawica\\" and Lt. Antoni Wr√≥bel \\"Burza\\" managed to break through the first German line, only to encounter a second one 300m beyond it. The most elite of the Polish units - the company of Lt. Adam Haniewicz \\"Woyna\\" - broke through the second line, but was stopped at a third line. Running out of manpower and supplies, the partisans were forced to retreat, and were further pushed back by a German counterattack. The unit of Lt. J√≥zef Stegli≈Ñski \\"Cord\\" broke through all three lines but was then engaged and destroyed by German reinforcements. The unit of Lt. Konrad Bartoszewski \\"Wir\\", fighting nearby, did however manage to break cleanly out of the German encirclement in the confusion of the battle. The remaining Polish units were forced back into the encirclement; eventually, all these partisans surrendered or were killed. Aftermath It is estimated that about 400 out of the 1,200-strong partisan forces that engaged the Germans on 24‚Äì25 June were killed (approximately half of the Polish losses during the Sturmwind II). Most of the rest surrendered; some were executed on the spot, and many were tortured for additional information about the resistance; survivors were sent to Nazi concentration camps. Nonetheless, while the Germans had weakened the partisans, they had failed to eliminate them. In July the Polish resistance carried out the country-wide Operation Tempest, and in the Zamo≈õƒá region the town of Szczebrzeszyn and Zamo≈õƒá itself were freed by the partisans. Soon afterward, the Soviet Lublin-Brest Offensive cleared out the Germans from most of the region. Currently in Osuchy there is a military cemetery dedicated to the partisans who fell in the battle.

Zoroastrian divinity, whose name literally means \\"with solid horses\\" and which she is then nominally the hypostasis of. The word drvaspa is grammatically feminine. Proceeding from an observation in James Darmesteter's Avesta (1875), \\"it has been customary to compare her to the Celtic Epona.\\" In scripture Despite the meaning of her name \\"with solid horses,\\" Drvaspa does not appear in any context referring to horses, and is instead invoked in the company of Geush Tashan and Geush Urvan, respectively representing the body and soul of cattle. This association occurs in the Siroza, the 30 verses of the 30 days of the Zoroastrian calendar month: the 14th day of the month is dedicated to Geush Urvan (\\"soul of the kine\\"), but in the Siroza verse recited on that day, the three divinities are invoked together and they are together described as patrons of the animal world. The 33 verses of Yasht 9, the hymn to Drvaspa, are--appropriately adjusted--copies of verses 27-52 of Yasht 17, which is dedicated to Ashi. This has in turn prompted a suggestion that Drvaspa was once an epithet of Ashi, and as is common in Indo-Iranian religious tradition, the epithet developed into a name of an independent divinity.. Because the hymn to Drvaspa is a copy of a section of the hymn to Ashi, and a part of this section also appears in the hymn to Aredvi Sura Anahita, these three divinities share several characteristics.cf. . For example, in Yasht 17.45-47, 9.25-27 and 5.106-108, Ashi, Drvaspa and Aredvi Sura are respectively invoked by Zoroaster for a boon so that the prophet might succeed in convincing the same figure to follow him. The wish is granted each time, and Zoroaster succeeds in his mission. In tradition Drvaspa only appears once in the medieval texts of Zoroastrian tradition. In this instance, in (Greater) Bundahishn XXVI.65, the steeds of Drvaspa are compared to those of Hvare-khshaeta.. The Middle Persian name given to the Avestan hymn to Drvaspa (Yasht 9, see above) was Gosh Yasht, that is, \\"hymn to the kine.\\" This discrepancy has prompted a suggestion that Drvaspa was functionally a cattle guardian of horses.. In iconography Drvaspa appears on Kushan coins as 'Drooaspo' (ŒõŒ°ŒüŒüŒëŒ£Œ†Œü), which is however a masculine form of the name, and Drvaspa is depicted as a male figure. \\"This form is to be identified with the Middle Persian name Lwhl'sp/LohrƒÅsp of the father of Vi≈°tƒÅspa, though the identification is somewhat problematic as, in the Avestan tradition, the latter is called Auruuataspa- 'of the rapid horses'.\\".

It was produced at the suggestion of producer Kenji Arai, and the soundtrack was produced by Jun Senoue. The game is based on NASCAR, and carries an official license with permission from Electronic Arts, which permitted Sega to develop the game as a coin-op only title. The game was released in both standard and deluxe arcade cabinets, and up to eight cabinets can be linked for multiplayer. Players have to race against competition at one of four tracks while also racing against a timer. Previews and reviews of the game praised the realistic graphics and smoothness, but had criticisms of the game's gear shifter and comparison to other Sega games. Gameplay The player, playing as alt= NASCAR Arcade is a racing game based on the 1999 NASCAR Winston Cup Series. Four tracks are available to select from: Talladega Superspeedway, Richmond International Raceway, and Watkins Glen International, as well as a \\"Team SEGA\\" secret track. Each track represents a different level of difficulty. The goal of the game is to advance through the field of rival race cars, while racing against a timer. Reaching a goal before the timer reaches zero resets the timer and extends the play. There are Race and Time Attack modes in single-player, as well as a multiplayer mode where up to eight arcade cabinets can be linked. The game's arcade cabinet seat will move when hitting an opponent or being hit, and the game's deluxe cabinet includes a tubular roll cage. Secret codes via gear shifter and by highlighting a particular car and holding down the brake pedal would allow access to drivers such as Richard Petty, Adam Petty (who passed away prior to the game's release), and Dale Earnhardt Jr. Development NASCAR Arcade was developed by Sega Rosso, formerly Sega's R&D; #5 division. Production of a NASCAR-based game was suggested by the game's producer, Kenji Arai, despite concerns that NASCAR was not well known in Japan (although NASCAR had previously hosted exhibition races at Suzuka Circuit and Twin Ring Motegi). At the time of its development, the license to create console games based on NASCAR belonged to Electronic Arts (EA), who were not releasing games on Sega's home console system, the Dreamcast. EA granted permission to Sega to develop NASCAR Arcade as a coin-op only game. The game runs on the Sega Hikaru arcade system board. According to Anoop Gantayat of IGN, he felt the game's original name of NASCAR Rubbin' Racing would sound odd to native English speakers and needed to change when the game came to North America. Official Dreamcast Magazine called the game's original title \\"very, very strange\\". The game was released as NASCAR Arcade in Japan. NASCAR Arcade's soundtrack was created by Jun Senoue and recorded by Sons of Angels (later known as Crush 40), with Senoue on guitar and Johnny Gioeli singing the vocals. Senoue had previously worked on a racing game soundtrack before with Eric Martin of Mr. Big on the title track for Daytona USA: Championship Circuit Edition, also called \\"Sons of Angels\\". Senoue and Gioeli later released the soundtrack as the album Thrill of the Feel on March 23, 2000 in Japan under the Sons of Angels name. It was released by Victor Entertainment.  Release and reception  In a preview of the game from testing in Shinjuku, Chris Johnston of GameSpot called NASCAR Arcade \\"one to watch out for\\". He noted the smooth textures of the graphics and the game's ability to run at 60 frames per second without any slowdown. The game was also demonstrated at the JAMMA 2000 show in Tokyo, with Anoop Gantayat of IGN stating the graphics and shadow effects appeared very realistic and that the steering wheel controls felt very realistic with the addition of resistance, along with good quality sound including deep, roaring engine sounds. In Japan, Game Machine listed NASCAR Arcade on their November 15, 2000 issue as being the eighteenth most-successful dedicated arcade game of the year. Edge stated that unlike Daytona USA, NASCAR Arcade shows a focus on realism. The reviewer called the game \\"technically accomplished, with cars and background well rendered\\", but criticized the gear shifter and negatively compared the game's graphics to Sega Rally 2. In 2011, Tim Daniels of Bleacher Report rated the game 16th in a list of the top 25 NASCAR video games, praising the game's realism.

The invasion never materialized and Hunt resigned his commission. The next year, President Sam Houston appointed Hunt as Texas's agent in the United States to assist the diplomat William H. Wharton in securing the United States' recognition of Texas. In March 1837, after successfully concluding that mission, Hunt became Texan Minister in Washington. His proposal for the annexation of Texas in 1837 was rejected by the United States, but he succeeded in negotiating a boundary convention in 1838. Under Texas's second President, Mirabeau B. Lamar, Hunt was Texas Secretary of the Navy from December 1838 to May 1839, when he became the Texas's representative on the joint United States-Texas boundary commission. In 1841, he was an unsuccessful candidate for Vice President running as David G. Burnet's running mate against Sam Houston. After statehood and final years Hunt volunteered to serve in the Mexican War in 1846 on General J. Pinckney Henderson's staff. Hunt married Anne Taliaferro Howard of Galveston on Feb. 14, 1850, in Galveston, Galveston Co., TX.Texas Marriages, 1837-1973, LDS Family Search Index After Texas's annexation by the United States, Hunt was elected for one term to the legislature, in 1852, and in 1853 he was appointed United States commissioner to adjust the southwestern boundary with Mexico. He spent his last years trying to recoup his fortune, which he had sacrificed in the cause of Texas. The legislature granted him full compensation in land. To develop his holdings he promoted a railroad from Galveston Bay to the Red River. While he was thus engaged, his health failed, and he died at his brother's home in Tipton County, Tennessee, on June 5, 1856. Mrs. Hunt died in 1916 and is buried in the Montgomery New Cemetery located in Montgomery, Montgomery Co., TX. On 28 July 1859, in Galveston Co., TX, Anne married to Abner S. Lipscomb who died in 1873. On 18 June 1874, in Montgomery Co., TX, Anne married Abner Womack who died in 1875. On 20 Nov 1880, in Montgomery Co., TX, Anne married Emmett Jones who died in 1894.

He emigrated from Germany to New York City with his widowed mother in 1892. After a severe injury, he passed the time in convalescence by sketching. In 1902 he joined the Art Students League of New York on a scholarship, where he was taught by Kenyon Cox. At the League's summer school in Woodstock, New York, he studied landscapes under L. Birge Harrison. In 1909 Dasburg visited Paris and joined the modernist circle of artists living there, including Morgan Russell, Jo Davidson, and Arthur Lee. During a trip to London that same year he married sculptor Grace Mott Johnson. Johnson returned to the United States early the next year, but Dasburg stayed in Paris where he met Henri Matisse, Gertrude Stein and Leo Stein, and became influenced by the paintings of C√©zanne and Cubism.Corley, Erin, A Finding Aid to the Andrew Dasburg and Grace Mott Johnson Papers, 1833-1980 (bulk 1900-1980), Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. He soon became an ardent promoter of the Cubist style. Dasburg returned to Woodstock, New York, in August and he and Johnson became active members of the artist community. In 1911 their son Alfred was born, the same year as Dasburg's first exhibition.

Biography According to Houbraken he lived from 1624 to 1694, but this has since been proven to be incorrect.Entry on Dirck Helmbreeker in RKD Theodoor Helmbreker biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature He was born in Haarlem and became a pupil of Pieter de Grebber. He traveled to Rome at a young age, where he remained until his death. His paintings belong to the group of artists known as the Bamboccianti, or, as Houbraken writes, Bamboots, which is a specialization by Northern artists in small-scale genre scenes in the manner of Pieter van Laer while in Rome.Slive, pp. 233‚Äì237. Helmbreker arrived in Italy in 1654, eventually settling in Rome by the end of the decade. At the end of the 1670s he and the Flemish painter Willem Reuter were members of a group known as the 'Congregazione dei Virtuosi al Pantheon'.Biographical details of Willem Reuter at the National Gallery of Art The Congregazione counted among its members many important artists who left their mark in Rome.

His genre scenes, which were among the last generation of the Bamboccianti, tended to be more classical in inspiration than many their earlier low-life scenes.Laureati Ultimately, these works found great success with Italian collectors. In 1695 he was commissioned to paint the main altar piece of the Church of St. Julian of the Flemings in Rome. Houbraken described a painting from 1681 in the possession of Pieter Klok showing an Italian monastery with a group of poor people in the foreground with various handicaps being given soup from a large kettle ladled by a Franciscan friar. Helmbreker was very religious and donated often to the poor of Rome.

Members  Around 7,000 members belong to about 500 Kinsmen, Kinette and Kin clubs from coast to coast. Kinsmen clubs are predominantly male-only while Kinette clubs are predominantly female-only. Kin clubs have a mixed membership of men and women. The Association was founded in Canada and there are no clubs outside of Canada.  History  Kinsmen Boys' Club of Rosemont in Montreal, Quebec, in 1942 In 1920, Harold A. Rogers, known in Kin Canada circles as \\"Founder Hal\\", founded the first Kinsmen club in Hamilton, Ontario. Rogers, a 21-year-old, had just returned from World War I and his father, a well-known Rotarian, encouraged him to join the Rotary Club. Rogers was rejected because the Rotary Club would not allow two members from the same business establishment. Not a person to be outdone, Rogers decided to create a new club. As a result of his initiative, a small group of like-minded men gathered for a dinner meeting on February 20, 1920 and formed what became known as the Kinsmen Club of Hamilton - Canada's first Kinsmen Club.

Projects Clubs independently determine what needs in their community they would like to assist with and often partner with municipalities and/or local non-profit organizations to meet those needs. The projects vary from clubs to club, but some examples include: * Providing funds to hospitals and local organizations * Supplying resources or services to local schools * Assisting with the building of community housing * Building play structures, splash pads and recreation facilities eg. The Kinsmen Field House, a sports venue in Edmonton * Organizing Christmas parades * Holding toy and food drives * Hosting community carnivals, festivals or events Since the Association's founding, clubs have raised over $1 billion for Canadian communities. Together, the clubs raised CAD $20 million and volunteered over 500,000 hours in the 2018‚Äì2019 Kin year. = Cystic fibrosis = Since 1964, Kin Canada has supported Cystic Fibrosis Canada, often raising over CAD $1 million a year for cystic fibrosis (CF) research and treatment.

Main Anchor  Kent Ninomiya became the primary news anchor for KSTP-TV in Minneapolis-St Paul in 2003. His co-anchor, Harris Faulkner, is an African American female. The all minority main anchor team working in a television market with very few minority viewers was heralded as a bold step forward by journalism organizations across the country.Kent Ninomiya University of Maryland report Ninomiya was also primary news anchor and managing editor at WICD in Champaign in 2006 and 2007.  Other Anchoring  Ninomiya first became a full-time news anchor in 1999 when he was named the weekday 5am - 7am morning news anchor for KGO-TV, the ABC owned and operated television station in San Francisco.Kent Ninomiya Broadcast pioneers article At KGO his co-anchors included Beth Spicuza, Carolyn Johnson and Elizabeth Bermudez.

He worked with several prominent co- anchors there including Gina Silva, Jennifer Gould, Maria Quiban and Lauren S√°nchez. During Ninomiya's time at KCOP, the news operation was merged with KTTV, the Fox station in Los Angeles, as part of a duopoly. Ninomiya appeared on the air for both Los Angeles television stations.  Reporter/Anchor  Prior to working in Los Angeles, Ninomiya was a reporter and fill in anchor. From 1993 to 1998 he worked for WLS-TV, the ABC owned and operated television station in Chicago.

Rickrolling, alternatively rick- rolling, is a prank and an Internet meme involving an unexpected appearance of the music video for the 1987 Rick Astley song \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\". The meme is a type of bait and switch using a disguised hyperlink that leads to the music video. When victims click on a seemingly unrelated link, the site with the music video loads instead of what was expected, and in doing so they are said to have been \\"rickrolled\\". The meme has also extended to using the song's lyrics in unexpected places. The meme grew out from a similar bait-and- switch trick called \\"duckrolling\\" that was popular on the 4chan website in 2006. The video bait-and-switch trick grew popular on 4chan by the 2007 April Fools' Day, and spread to other Internet sites later that year. The meme gained mainstream attention in 2008 through several publicized events, particularly when YouTube used it on its 2008 April Fools' Day event. Initially, Astley, who had only recently returned to performing after a ten- year hiatus, was hesitant about using his newfound popularity from the meme to further his career, but accepted the fame when he rickrolled the 2008 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade with a surprise performance of the song. Since then, Astley has seen his performance career revitalized by the meme's popularity. History =Origin= \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" appeared on Astley's 1987 debut album Whenever You Need Somebody. The song, his solo debut single, was a number-one hit on several international charts, including the Billboard Hot 100, Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks, and the UK Singles Chart. The accompanying music video, Astley's first, features him performing the song while dancing. It since had become a popular song on the Internet, particularly after it was featured in the 2005 \\"Charlie Has Cancer\\" episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. The use of the song for rickrolling dates to 2006, originating from the 4chan imageboard from an early meme known as \\"duckrolling\\". Sometime in 2006, the site moderator, Christopher \\"m00t\\" Poole implemented a word filter replacing the word \\"egg\\" with \\"duck\\" as a gag. On one thread, where \\"eggroll\\" had become \\"duckroll\\", an anonymous user posted an edited image of a duck with wheels, calling it a \\"duckroll\\". The image caught on across 4chan; the image would be the target of a hyperlink with an otherwise interesting title, with a user clicking through having been said to be \\"duckrolled\\". In March 2007, the first trailer for the highly-anticipated Grand Theft Auto IV was released onto Rockstar Games website. Viewership was so high that it crashed Rockstar's site. Several users helped to post mirrors of the video on different sites, but one user on 4chan had linked to the \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" video claiming to be the trailer, tricking numerous readers into the bait- and-switch. This practice quickly replaced duckrolling for other alluring links, all generally pointing to Astley's video, and thus creating the practice of \\"rickrolling\\". The bait-and-switch to the \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" greatly expanded on 4chan on April Fools' Day in 2007, and led to the trick expanding to other sites like Fark and Digg later that year, quickly gaining the name \\"rickrolling\\" based on the prior \\"duckrolling\\". An initial use of \\"rickrolling\\" was confirmed by the editors of Know Your Meme, where rural Michigan resident Erik Helwig had called into a local radio sports-talk show in 2006 and instead of conversing with the DJs, simply played \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\", leaving the DJs speechless. While this occurred before the 4chan use, Know Your Meme editor-in-chief Don Caldwell said there was no direct confirmation if it had inspired the 4chan use of the video. =Growth in 2008= A Rick Astley impersonator during one of the March 2008 rickrolls at a collegiate basketball game Rickrolling started to appear in more mainstream sources during 2008, with a SurveyUSA April 2008 poll estimating that at least 18 million American adults had been rickrolled. One of the first public events involved the Church of Scientology which had been aggressively trying to censor videos critical of the church. The Internet group Anonymous as part of their Project Chanology to challenge this censoring, protested at the Church's various headquarters across the globe by chanting the song, among other activities. A number of collegiate basketball games in March 2008 had people dressing up as Astley from the video and lip-syncing to the music as a prank before the start of the game. YouTube's 2008 April Fools joke made featured video hyperlinks on the site's home page end up on the music video. In April 2008, the New York Mets baseball team asked fans on the internet what song they should use for their eighth-inning rally song. \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" received a massive number of votes, driven by websites like 4chan. At the 2008 MTV Europe Music Awards, an online campaign led to Astley being named the \\"Best Act Ever\\" despite not being on the original shortlist of nominees, effectively rickrolling the awards. Astley performing the song during the 2008 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade By November 2008, the \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" video on YouTube had more than 20 million views and was considered a viral video, however Astley initially appeared indifferent to the newfound fame. When Astley was asked about the trend of rickrolling during an interview in March 2008, he stated, \\"it's weird,\\" since he had not performed much lately, but he found the interest funny. However, at the 2008 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Astley made a surprise appearance on a float for Cartoon Network to lip-sync the song to the crowd and television audiences, making that performance the largest rickroll to date. According to Astley, Cartoon Network had urged him to perform for the parade along with a large performance payment, and although he had been wary of trying to promote himself using the popularity of the meme, decided to go for it. =Ongoing usage= In September 2009, Wired magazine published a guide to modern hoaxes which listed rickrolling as one of the better known beginner-level hoaxes, alongside the fake e-mail chain letter. The term has been extended to simple hidden use of the song's lyrics. Cover versions of \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" have also been used as part of rickrolling; in April 2018, the creators of TV's Westworld released a video that purported to be a spoiler guide for the entire second season in advance, but instead featured lead actress Evan Rachel Wood singing the song while accompanied by another main actress, Angela Sarafyan, playing the piano. The most popular upload of the music video on YouTube from 2007 used for rickrolling, titled \\"RickRoll'D\\", was removed for terms-of-use violations in February 2010Silverman, Dwight. \\"Rickroll'd no more: Internet meme takedown!\\" Houston Chronicle. 24 February 2010. Retrieved on 24 February 2010. but the takedown was revoked within a day. It was taken down again on 18 July 2014. It has since been unblocked again and has gained over 81 million views . The Official Rick Astley channel uploaded another version on 24 October 2009, which has over 760 million views . Its meme status led to the song's usage in the post-credits scene for Walt Disney Animation Studios's 2018 film Ralph Breaks the Internet, the sequel to 2012's Wreck-It Ralph. The song also appears in the film Bumblebee, and was featured at the end of its initial teaser trailer. On 5 January 2018, Paul Fenwick announced that he had started several Rick Astley hotlines, which when called, would play \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" along with several other artist's adaptations of it. Paul Fenwick advertised it as \\"You are encouraged to use them for paperwork, loyalty schemes, and general joy.\\" By 2019, the popularity of rickrolling had diminished, however on 25 August, a notable large-scale occurrence happened at Petco Park in San Diego during a Major League Baseball game between the Boston Red Sox and the San Diego Padres‚Äîthe first game that the Red Sox played at Petco Park in six years. During a mid-inning break, the Padres' scoreboard began to play \\"Sweet Caroline\\"‚Äîa tradition at Red Sox home games in Fenway Park‚Äîbut the Red Sox were the opposition in San Diego. As the Neil Diamond song was about to reach the chorus, however, the video-board suddenly switched to \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\", much to the amusement of the crowd. On 13 October 2019, the Sunday night NFL game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Los Angeles Chargers at Dignity Health Sports Park featured a case of rickrolling when the PA announcers, after a Chargers touchdown brought the score to 24-10 Pittsburgh, decided to troll the partisan crowd by playing the beginning of the Styx song \\"Renegade\\" (which had been played at the Steelers home Heinz Field since 2001) only to transition into \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\". The stunt caught fans and players from both teams by surprise (even being acknowledged by the Steelers official social media accounts), and some Chargers players were not happy about the Steelers anthem being played in their own home stadium. The Steelers won the game 24‚Äì17. Reaction Astley performing in 2017 In an interview in March 2008, Astley said that he found the rickrolling of Scientology to be \\"hilarious\\"; he also said that he will not try to capitalise on the rickroll phenomenon with a new recording or remix of his own, but that he would be happy to have other artists remix it. Overall, Astley is not troubled by the phenomenon, stating that he finds it \\"bizarre and funny\\" and that his only concern is that his \\"daughter doesn't get embarrassed about it.\\" A spokesperson for Astley's record label released a comment which showed that Astley's interest with the phenomenon had faded, as they stated, \\"I'm sorry, but he's done talking about Rickrolling\\". In November 2008, Astley was nominated for \\"Best Act Ever\\" at the MTV Europe Music Awards after the online nomination form was flooded with votes. The push to make Astley the winner of the award, as well as efforts to encourage MTV to personally invite Astley to the awards ceremony, continued after the announcement. On 10 October, Astley's website confirmed that an invitation to the awards had been received. On 6 November 2008, just hours before the ceremony was due to air, it was reported that MTV Europe did not want to give Astley the award at the ceremony, instead wanting to present it at a later date. Many fans who voted for Astley felt the awards ceremony failed to acknowledge him as a legitimate artist. Astley stated in an interview that he felt the award was \\"daft\\", but noted that he thought that \\"MTV were thoroughly rickrolled\\", and went on to thank everyone who voted for him. In 2009, Astley wrote about 4chan founder moot for Time magazine's annual Time 100 issue, and thanked moot for the rickrolling phenomenon. According to The Register, , Astley had only directly received $12 in performance royalties from YouTube. Although by that time the song had been played 39 million times, Astley did not compose the song and received only a performer's share of the sound recording copyright. However, Astley denied those reports in 2016. Astley himself has been rickrolled a few times. In an interview with Larry King, Astley states that the first time he has fallen for the prank was through an email his friend sent him during the early 2000s. More recently, on a Reddit post in June 2020. A user claimed to have met Rick Astley backstage when they were 12 years old, but posted a link to the song instead of a picture verifying the encounter. Astley later confirmed he had been tricked into clicking the link.

Finding the Spanish army in the midst of crossing the Tormes River, Kellermann did not wait for his infantry under Jean Gabriel Marchand to arrive, but led the French cavalry in a series of charges that routed the Spanish units on the near bank with heavy losses. Del Parque's army was forced to take refuge in the mountains that winter. Alba de Tormes is southeast of Salamanca, Spain. The action occurred during the Peninsular War, part of the Napoleonic Wars. The Spanish Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom planned to launch a two-pronged attack on Madrid in the fall of 1809. In the west, Del Parque's Army of the Left enjoyed some success against Marchand's weak VI Corps. When the Spanish general learned that the other offensive prong had been crushed at Oca√±a, he turned around and began retreating rapidly to the south. At the same time, Marchand was reinforced by a dragoon division under Kellermann. Taking command, Kellermann raced in pursuit of the Army of the Left, catching up with it at Alba de Tormes. Not waiting for their own foot soldiers, the French dragoons and light cavalry fell upon the Spanish infantry and defeated it. Marchand's infantry arrived in time to mop up, but the cavalry had done most of the fighting. Del Parque's men retreated into the mountains where they spent a miserable few months. Background By the summer of 1809, the Spanish Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom was coming under harsh criticism over its handling of the war effort. The Spanish people demanded that the ancient Cortes be summoned and the Junta reluctantly agreed. But it was difficult to restore the old assembly and bring it into session. Ultimately, the Cortes of C√°diz would be set up, but until that day arrived the Junta exercised power. Anxious to justify its continued existence, the Junta came up with what it hoped would be a war-winning strategy.. Undeterred by the fact that Arthur Wellesley, Viscount Wellington refused to contribute any British soldiers, the Junta planned to launch a two-pronged offensive aimed at recapturing Madrid. They replaced Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana with Diego de Ca√±as y Portocarrero, Duke del Parque as commander of the troops in Galicia and Asturias. Del Parque soon massed 30,000 troops at Ciudad Rodrigo with more on the way. South of Madrid, Juan Carlos de Ar√©izaga assembled over 50,000 well-equipped men in the Army of La Mancha. The main efforts of Del Parque and Ar√©izaga would be aided by a third force that operated near Talavera de la Reina under Jos√© Miguel de la Cueva y de la Cerda, Duke of Albuquerque. The 10,000-man Talavera force was designed to hold some French units in place while the main armies thrust at Madrid.. In the fall of 1809, Del Parque's Army of the Left numbered 52,192 men in one cavalry and six infantry divisions. Martin de la Carrera's Vanguard Division counted 7,413 soldiers, Francisco Xavier Losada's 1st Division had 8,336 troops, Conde de Belveder's 2nd Division was made up of 6,759 men, Francisco Ballesteros's 3rd Division numbered 9,991 soldiers, Nicol√°s de Mahy's 4th Division comprised 7,100 troops, and Conde de Castrofuerte's 5th Division counted 6,157 men. All infantry divisions included 14 battalions except the 3rd with 15 and the 5th with seven. The Prince of Anglona's Cavalry Division included 1,682 horsemen in six regiments. Ciudad Rodrigo was provided with a garrison of 3,817 troops and there was an unattached 937-man battalion.. Jean Gabriel Marchand was drubbed at Tamames. With Marshal Michel Ney on leave, Jean Gabriel Marchand assumed command of the VI Corps, based at Salamanca. The corps had been forced to quit Galicia earlier in 1809 and had been involved in the operations in the aftermath of the Battle of Talavera in July. After hard campaigning and a lack of reinforcements, VI Corps was not in a good condition to fight. Furthermore, Marchand's talents were not equal to those of his absent chief. Del Parque advanced from Ciudad Rodrigo in late September. with the divisions of La Carrera, Losada, Belveder, and Anglona. Filled with scorn for his Spanish adversaries, an overconfident Marchand advanced on the village of Tamames, southwest of Salamanca. In the Battle of Tamames on 18 October 1809, the French suffered an embarrassing defeat.. This source also listed Ballesteros' division in the Spanish order of battle. The French lost 1,400 killed and wounded out of 14,000 soldiers and 14 guns. Spanish casualties were only 700 out of 21,500 men and 18 cannons. After the battle, Del Parque was joined by Ballesteros' division, giving him 30,000 troops. As the Spanish advanced, Marchand abandoned Salamanca and Del Parque's men occupied the city on 25 October.. Marchand retreated north to the town of Toro on the Duero River. Here he was joined by Fran√ßois √âtienne de Kellermann with 1,500 infantry in three battalions and a 3,000-trooper dragoon division. Kellermann took command of the French force and marched upstream, crossing to the south bank at Tordesillas. Reinforced by General of Brigade Nicolas Godinot's force, Kellermann challenged Del Parque by marching directly on Salamanca. The Spaniard backpedaled, giving up Salamanca and retreating to the south. In the meantime, the guerillas in Province of Le√≥n became very active. Kellermann left the VI Corps holding Salamanca and raced back to Le√≥n to stamp out the uprising.. Albuquerque managed to pin down some French troops near Talavera as planned, but when he found out that Ar√©izaga's army had been cut to pieces at the Battle of Oca√±a on 19 November, he wisely withdrew out of reach of the French. Meanwhile, Del Parque heard of the march of Godinot's and General of Brigade Pierre-Louis Binet de Marcognet's brigades toward Madrid. Though he had been instructed to join Albuquerque, he instead moved on Salamanca again, hustling one of the VI Corps brigades out of Alba de Tormes.. Del Parque occupied Salamanca on 20 November.. The French general withdrew behind the Duero and again rendezvoused with Kellermann. Hoping to get between Kellermann and Madrid, Del Parque thrust toward Medina del Campo. On 23 November at that town, Marcognet's brigade returned from Segovia while General of Brigade Mathieu Delabass√©e's brigade arrived from Tordesillas. At this moment, Del Parque's columns hove into view and there was a skirmish at El Carpio. The French horsemen initially drove back the Spanish cavalry but were repulsed by Ballesteros' steady foot soldiers fighting in squares. This event prompted Marcognet and Delabass√©e to retreat.. On 24 November, Kellermann massed 16,000 French troops on the Duero near Valdestillas. Badly outnumbered, the French prepared to defend themselves. But on this day the Army of the Left received news of the Oca√±a disaster.. Understanding that this dire event meant that the French could spare plenty of soldiers to track down his army, Del Parque bolted to the south, intending to shelter in the mountains of central Spain.. On 25 November, Del Parque slipped away so suddenly that Kellermann did not even begin his pursuit until the next day. For two days, the French were unable to catch up with their adversaries. But on the afternoon of 28 November, their light cavalry found the Army of the Left camped at Alba de Tormes. Battle Fran√ßois de Kellermann Believing that he was out of Kellermann's reach, Del Parque grew careless. He allowed his army to camp in a bad position astride the Tormes River. The divisions of Ballesteros and Castrofuerte bivouacked on the east bank while the divisions of Anglona, La Carrera, Losada, and Belveder were in the town and on the west bank. Since the cavalry pickets were posted too close the camp, they did not give adequate warning of the arrival of the French. Riding with his light cavalry advance guard, Kellermann determined to attack at once. He feared that if he waited for Marchand's infantry, the Spanish would have time to establish a defensive line behind the Tormes. The decision meant that unsupported French cavalry would be attacking a much larger force of Spanish cavalry, infantry, and artillery. The reinforced VI Corps included Marchand's 1st Division, General of Division Maurice Mathieu's 2nd Division, General of Brigade Jean Baptiste Lorcet's light cavalry brigade, and Kellermann's dragoon division. The 1st Division included three battalions each of 6th Light Infantry Regiment, and the 39th, 69th and 76th Line Infantry Regiments. The 2nd Division counted three battalions each of 25th Light, 27th Line, and 59th Line, plus one battalion of the 50th Line. Lorcet's corps cavalry comprised four squadrons each of the 3rd Hussar and 15th Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiments. The dragoon division was made up of the 3rd, 6th, 10th, 11th, 15th, and 25th Dragoon Regiments. Kellerman had no more than 3,000 cavalry and 12 guns immediately available.. This authority omitted the 6th and 11th Dragoons, listed Lorcet as leading only the 3rd Hussars and 15th Chasseurs, and stated that the other four dragoon regiments were part of Kellermann's division.. This source listed Kellermann's division as consisting of the 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 11th Dragoons, and the 15th and 25th Dragoons as part of Lorcet's command. Princesa Line Infantry Regiment (left) and Catalonia Light Infantry Regiment (right) La Carrera's division consisted of three battalions each of the Principe and Zaragosa Line Infantry Regiments, one battalion each of the Barbastro, 1st Catalonia, 2nd Catalonia, and Gerona Light Infantry Regiments, one battalion each of the Vitoria, Escolares de Leon, Monforte de Lemos, and Muerte Volunteer Regiments, and one foot artillery battery. Losada's division included two battalions each of the Leon and Voluntarios de Corona Line Infantry and Galicia Provincial Grenadier Militia, one battalion each of the 1st Aragon and 2nd Aragon Light Infantry, two battalions of the Betanzos Volunteer Regiment, one battalion each of the Del General, 1st La Union, 2nd La Union, and Orense Volunteer Regiments, one company of National Guards, and one foot artillery battery... This source identified which regular units were line or light infantry, or heavy cavalry or dragoons. Belveder's division comprised the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the Rey, Seville, Toledo, and Zamora Line Infantry, two battalions each of the foreign Hibernia Line and Lovera Volunteer Regiments, one battalion each of the Voluntaros de Navarre Light Infantry, and Santiago Volunteer Regiments, and one foot artillery battery. Anglona's division had the regular 2nd Reyna (Cavalry or Dragoon), 5th Borbon Cavalry, 6th Sagunto Dragoon, and Provisional Regiments, the volunteer Llerena Horse Grenadiers and Ciudad Rodrigo Cazadores, and one horse artillery battery. Ballesteros' division consisted of three battalions of the Navarra Line Infantry and two battalions of the Princesa Line Infantry Regiments, one battalion each of the Oviedo Militia and the Candas y Luanco, Cangas de Tineo, Castropol, Covadonga, Grado, Infiesto, Lena, Pravia, and Villaviciosa Volunteer Regiments, and one foot artillery battery. Castrofuertes' division was made up of one battalion each of the Tiradores de Ciudad Rodrigo, 2nd Ciudad Rodrigo, and Ferdinand VII Volunteer Regiments, and Leon, Lagro√±o, Toro, and Valladolid Militia, and one artillery battery. One battalion formed Del Parque's headquarters guard. Mahy's 4th Division was detached from the army at the time of the battle. The Spanish divisions on the east bank hastily formed front against the French, with La Carrera's division holding the left flank, Belveder's the center, and Losada's the right flank. The 1,200 sabers belonging to the Prince of Anglona covered the entire front. To face the threat, Del Parque put as few as 18,000 men. or as many as 21,300 infantry, 1,500 cavalry and 18 artillery pieces in line. Kellermann quickly formed his eight regiments in four lines, with Lorcet's two light cavalry regiments in the first line and the six dragoon regiments in the three supporting lines. Storming forward, the 3,000 horsemen burst through Anglona's cavalry and crashed into the Spanish right-center. The attack broke up all of Losada's and part of Belveder's formations. About 2,000 Spaniards threw down their muskets and surrendered, the rest fled across the bridge. The French also seized a battery of artillery. Del Parque was unable to bring up his other two divisions because the span was packed with panicked soldiers. Instead, he deployed them along the river to cover the retreat of the others. During the crisis, the men in La Carrera's and part of Belveder's divisions were able to form into brigade squares. Kellermann organized a second attack against the unbroken squares but the Spanish soldiers held steady and repelled the French cavalry. Since his infantry were still far in the rear, Kellermann tried to fix the enemy squares in place by launching partial charges. For two and a half hours, this tactic succeeded in pinning down the Spanish soldiers on the west bank. Marchand's infantry and artillery finally appeared on the horizon. Realizing that his men would be annihilated by a combined arms attack, La Carrera ordered an immediate retreat. The French cavalry rushed forward and inflicted further losses, but most of the Spanish troops got away over the bridge in the fading light. Marchand's leading brigade cleared some of Losada's rallied men out of the town of Alba and captured two more artillery pieces. Results Del Parque ordered his army to retreat under cover of darkness. During the operation, a group of panicky horsemen caused a stampede in the marching columns and the three divisions that fought were badly scattered while other soldiers deserted.. The Spanish suffered 3,000 killed, wounded, and captured, plus nine cannon, five colors, and most of their baggage train. The French suffered between 300 and 600 killed or wounded in the action, including General of Brigade Jean-Auguste Carri√© de Boissy wounded. Del Parque established his winter headquarters at San Mart√≠n de Trevejo in the Sierra de Gata and began reassembling his troops. He had led 32,000 men at Alba de Tormes, but a month later could only gather 26,000 soldiers. This suggests that 3,000 men deserted the colors after the battle. Worse was to follow. In the desolate district where the army was quartered, the starving troops were sometimes forced to subsist on acorns. By mid- January, 9,000 died or were rendered unfit by hunger and illness. The Arthur Wellesley, Marquess of Wellington wrote in disgust, The repercussions of the Oca√±a and Alba de Tormes defeats were disastrous for the Spanish cause. With the Spanish armies severely weakened, Andalusia was exposed to French invasion. Wellington, who as late as 14 November was optimistic, now became anxious that the French might invade Portugal..

After Data East became defunct due to their bankruptcy back in 2003, G-Mode bought the intellectual rights to the arcade game as well as most other Data East games and licenses globally. Description =Plot= The plot resembles some movies and novels of the James Bond series and takes place in the U.S. in an unspecified time period described ingame as \\"199X\\". During the introduction sequence, the president and his wife are waving at the crowd next to a limousine at the White House in Washington D.C., when terrorists (some flying in using jetpacks) approach the president and his wife armed and dangerous, and, as soon as the screen goes red and gun sounds are heard, they seem to shoot not only the crowd, but also the president and the first lady, who are both presumed dead. Later, a secret agent working for the American secret service, and known only by the name of Sly, is informed that the terrorists who struck at the presidential ceremony were located, identified, and confirmed to be CWD (Council for World Domination) members. CWD is a secret underground criminal organization with terrorist foundations, involved in drugs and arms dealing, government corruption and their ultimate goal - WORLD CONQUEST. Sly is assigned by the secret service to eliminate these thugs. Listening to the world's desperate plea for freedom and hoping to protect those he loves most, Sly jumps from a plane towards Washington D.C., and begins his campaign to prevent the terrorists from infiltrating not only the city, but several spots in the U.S., and must also prevent a nuclear missile from launching and striking the Earth. =The final challenge= The player should reach the end of the game, after facing off several previous bosses, he/she will fight the leader of C.W.D., whose identity is never given outside of that title. A spiked ceiling slowly descends from above and the boss is protected by a force field. Sly must shoot or kick it to deal enough damage and dent the field. Sly then shoots the C.W.D.'s leader, finishing him for good before fleeing the base with hardly a scratch. In the beginning of the ending sequence, Sly receives a final transmission from the president himself, who somehow escaped the attack at the early moments of the game and is miraculously alive. The president congratulates Sly for saving the planet, but then tells him that he \\"missed a couple of things and may come back to pick them up\\". Unaware of what's actually going on, he goes to the White House, only to arrive at the entrance and quickly find roaring applause from the crowd as well as what seems the president's daughters ‚Äì who were enchanted with Sly's heroic deeds ‚Äì posing and smiling alongside him for a photo, who gave him several kisses, as a \\"thank you\\". Then, he and his girls return home in a fashionable Ferrari F40, speeding all the way over the road, going together to enjoy their well-deserved honeymoon. as the car drives out of the screen, \\"THE END\\" is shown, giving the game a definite end. =Gameplay= Arcade screenshot Players control the secret agent name Sly Spy through eight different stages. Some stages have their own gameplay. In the first part of the first stage, players shoot enemies horizontally while sky-diving. The second half of the first, third, fifth, sixth and eighth stages are played in a run and gun format similar to Namco's Rolling Thunder and its sequels, but it lacks the ability to jump between the top and bottom floors while grabbing rails. Also, when out of ammo or attacked by a boss with one hit, Sly Spy drops his firearm while the game becomes a beat'em up in 2D platform manner, much like Shinobi. Players can make Sly Spy do three different kicks: high kicks, low kicks and jump kicks. The second stage shows Sly Spy riding on his motorcycle with a built-in machine gun, which makes this stage a combination of run-and-gun and vehicular combat game formats, much like Moon Patrol. The fourth and seventh stages are in marine-based, side-scrolling shooter format. Minor enemies will drop several different items when defeated, such as extra ammo, cans of Coca-Cola-esque soda and machine guns. Sometimes, enemies will drop a jetpack on land or a DPV while underwater to make transportation easier. =James Bond references= Enemies also drop parts of the ultimate weapon in the game called the Golden Gun, which is based on the weapon of the same name from the novel/film titled The Man with the Golden Gun; however, instead of shooting Golden Bullets like in the James Bond series, Sly Spy's version functions nearly the same way as the Cobra Gun in Data East's 1988 RoboCop arcade game and the Heavy Barrel energy cannon from the arcade game of the same name. It is also shaped like a rifle instead of a pistol; however, when the Golden Gun is equipped along with either the motorcycle or a DPV, their built-in firearms will shoot the same energy bolts shot from the Golden Gun itself. Besides the protagonist and the Golden Gun being references of the James Bond series, several bosses and stages in the game are based on villains and settings in the James Bond series. The second boss is based on Jaws from the films titled The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker, the third boss is based on Oddjob from the film titled Goldfinger, and the ninth and final stage is based on the launch base seen in the Moonraker film. Ports The game was ported to several home systems for personal use. Ocean Software ported it to the Amiga (with completely different background music composed by Tim Follin), Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Atari ST and ZX Spectrum in 1990 exclusively in Europe, while Data East released Ocean's Commodore 64 version in North America in 1990.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Sly Spy on their August 15, 1989 issue as being the fifth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Legacy Several references from Data East's other arcade games made cameo appearances in Sly Spy. A poster showing Chelnov (a.k.a. Atomic Runner) can be seen at the beginning of Stage 3, the logo for the aforementioned Bad Dudes can be seen at the end of Stage 3, and a poster showing Karnov can be seen at the beginning of Stage 5. In the 1990 movie RoboCop 2, officer Duffy gets pushed by RoboCop into a Bad Dudes arcade cabinet, but with Sly Spy built into it. Along with a few other Data East arcade games, they appeared in the film due to licensing and advertising agreements between Orion Pictures, Data East and Ocean Software after the release of two video games based on the RoboCop property. In 2010, G-Mode and G1M2 added the arcade game to Data East Arcade Classics as Secret Agent. In 2018 it was released on Nintendo Switch.

Innes, Innes Publishing Co, Philadelphia, 1935 commonly known as the three-lined or three-stripe pencilfish, is a freshwater species of fish belonging to the characin family Lebiasinidae. They are popular in the aquarium trade due to their small size, beautiful color pattern, and relative hardiness. Taxonomy Steindachner first described the species in 1876, making it one of the first four species in the genus to be described. As a result of the broad distribution of N. trifasciatus, the species is polymorphic and, over the years, some of these color morphs have been erroneously described as separate species. Poecilobrycon erythrurus and Poecilobrycon vittatus, two such examples, are now known to be junior synonyms. Distribution and habitat N. trifasciatus inhabits slow-moving, slightly acidic waters. Within these conditions, it is found in several different habitat types. It has a broad distribution throughout the Amazon basin, Colombia, Peru, northern Bolivia, and the Guianas. In the Rio Negro, it inhabits the large swamps that form where tributaries meet the main branch of the river. When the river floods, it moves into the inundated rainforest. During the low-water season, it often becomes trapped in small lakes that are left behind, or stays close to the wooded edges of the forest. N. trifasciatus rests near the water surface at night and during the day inhabits the middle to upper water layers. Description The three-lined pencilfish is a small fish, with adults not reaching more than 6 cm in length. It has a small terminal mouth, and an adipose fin may or may not be present. Most pencilfish possess distinct daytime and nighttime color patterns, and N. trifasciatus is no exception. During the day, it has three black longitudinal stripes that run the length of the body. At night, three large dark spots materialize on the sides of the fish, extending from its back to its belly. Research has shown that this change in coloration is due to the differential action of the pineal hormone melatonin on pigment cells in different regions of the integument. The daytime color pattern may serve an aposematic or recognition function for individuals of the same species, and the nighttime pattern may help hide the fish from nocturnal predators. In between the variable, darkly pigmented regions, N. trifasciatus is greenish-gold in color on its back and sides and silver underneath. The gill cover and dorsal, pelvic, anal, and caudal fins possess red blotches, varying in size depending on the population. N. trifasciatus has often been confused in aquarium literature with N. marginatus which is also a three-striped pencilfish; however, the latter species can be distinguished by its smaller size and blockier profile. =Sexual dimorphism= Sexual dimorphism in this species is the least evident of the many species in the genus Nannostomus. The anal fin of males, which is often modified in shape or is more colorful in many Nannostomus species, is not modified or more colorful in N. trifasciatus. Males of the species may have an additional row of red spots in the gold area between the middle and uppermost stripes, but this is extremely variable even within populations. Males are sometimes slimmer and more colorful than females, but once again, this is variable. Diet N. trifasciatus is omnivorous and spends much of its time near the water surface, where it feeds primarily on insects. It is also an avid biofilm grazer, ingesting microorganisms, as well as algae. In the aquarium A trio of N. trifasciatus N. trifasciatus is a popular and appropriate community aquarium species, if tankmates are of similar size and demeanor, and will thrive if kept in soft, mildly acidic water at temperatures between 72 and 82 ¬∞F. Baby brine shrimp and other small-sized foods are indicated. Males establish and defend small territories. The species spawns during the daytime among plant leaves. The eggs are adhesive and are most often placed on plants. Fertilization takes place externally, and 30-100 eggs are produced at a time. The eggs hatch in 24‚Äì72 hours, depending on the water temperature. If well-fed, and if sufficient plant cover is provided, breeders will not eat eggs and fry will be found among floating plants. This species is seldom spawned in captivity and has never been commercially raised in fisheries. The aquarium trade relies exclusively on wild-caught specimens.

Following the war, the ship saw service first as a training ship and then later, as an oceanographic research vessel. She remained in service until 1969. Design and description The reciprocating group displaced at standard load and at deep load The ships measured long overall with a beam of . They had a draught of . The ships' complement consisted of 85 officers and ratings.Lenton, p. 261 The reciprocating ships had two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . They carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave them a range of at . The Algerine class was armed with a QF Mk V anti-aircraft gunChesneau, p. 65 and four twin-gun mounts for Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. The latter guns were in short supply when the first ships were being completed and they often got a proportion of single mounts. By 1944, single-barrel Bofors 40 mm mounts began replacing the twin 20 mm mounts on a one for one basis. All of the ships were fitted for four throwers and two rails for depth charges. Many Canadian ships omitted their sweeping gear in exchange for a 24-barrel Hedgehog spigot mortar and a stowage capacity for 90+ depth charges. Construction and career New Liskeard, named for New Liskeard, Ontario, was laid down on 8 July 1943 by Port Arthur Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. at Port Arthur, Ontario. The ship was launched on 14 January 1944 and was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 21 November 1944 at Port Arthur.Macpherson & Barrie, p. 197 Following her commissioning, New Liskeard sailed down the St. Lawrence River to Halifax, Nova Scotia. The minesweeper was then dispatched to Bermuda for workups before returning to Halifax. Once there the vessel joined the Western Escort Force in April 1945 for convoy escort duties in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was assigned to escort group W-8 and remained with them until the group's disbandment in June 1945. New Liskeard was then assigned to as a training ship in July. This position lasted until September when the minesweeper was placed in reserve at Sydney, Nova Scotia. The ship was then taken to Halifax, where she remained in reserve until the end of 1945. After refitting at Halifax, the ship was recommissioned on 9 April 1946 as a training vessel. On 21 October 1947, New Liskeard helped sink the surrendered off the coast of Nova Scotia in a training exercise.Skaarup, p. 393 In 1948, the minesweeper was used for oceanographic duties. New Liskeard was paid off on 22 April 1958. New Liskeard was fully converted into an oceanographic research vessel. The ship was outfitted with two oceanographic and acoustic laboratories. The ship performed this role until 1 May 1969. That same year, she was taken to Dartmouth Cove, Nova Scotia and broken up.

The design of the is similar to the two high-speed ferries operated by Hawaii Superferry, both built by Austal USA. Vessel HST-2 was built as Alakai, which means \\"sea path\\" in the Hawaiian language. The vessel is a long high-speed roll-on/roll-off (Ro/Ro) passenger and vehicle ferry. She used to operate a daily service operated by Hawaii Superferry at a speed of between the islands of Oahu and Maui. HST-2 has a capacity of 866 passengers and up to 282 subcompact cars. Alternately, its vehicle decks can be reconfigured in five minutes to carry up to 20 large trucks and 90 cars. Like her sister ship (formerly Huakai), the vessel features environmentally friendly technologies including non-toxic bottom paint, zero wastewater discharge and clean diesel engines.Hawaii Superferry - Eco-friendly Features Hawaii Superferry's vessels were designed and built by Austal USA, a subsidiary of Austal, an Australian company that is the world's largest builder of fast ferries. Construction on HST-2 began in June 2004 in Mobile, Alabama. The ship was launched in January 2007, christened in April 2007 and sea trials went smoothly. Starting service Alakai during sea trials in 2007 The vessel arrived as Alakai in Honolulu, Hawaii on June 30, 2007 with a celebration, after a smooth 17-day delivery voyage. The ship's maiden voyage was on August 26, 2007 and the trip to Maui was smooth. The voyage to Kauai was rougher and Alakai was met by about a dozen protestors on surfboards blockading the entrance to Nawiliwili Harbor. The protestors were peacefully cleared by the United States Coast Guard. 2008 dry dock On February 13, 2008, Alakai went into dry dock to make repairs to her auxiliary rudders that were damaged in late January. The dry docking was extended due to hull damage caused when a tugboat moving Alakai into dry dock lost power and collided heavily with the catamaran. Alakai returned to service in early April 2008 shortly after Aloha Airlines ended service. Before resuming service the ship went through sea trials and was re-certified by the Coast Guard. 2009 shut down On March 17, 2009 after about 11 months in service, the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled that the legislation permitting Alakai to operate without an environmental review was unconstitutional. Hawaii Superferry made one last round trip to allow an orderly return of passengers who were not on their home island. They canceled existing reservations and did not take new reservations. The Superferry company intended to look for other work for Alakai; it had also left open the possibility of bringing the ferry back into service if and when Hawaii completed an environmental review, but the company decided to abandon the vessel ending all possibilities of returning to Hawaii. In January 2010, the United States Maritime Administration announced that Huakai and Alakai would be used to assist with relief in the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Maritime Administration Prepares Five Ships For Duty, U.S. Department of Transportation, January 18, 2010 Navy acquisition and name change On September 13, 2010, Huakai and Alakai were auctioned off, for $25 million each, by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. They were purchased by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration. On January 27, 2012, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration transferred two high speed vessels, Huakai and Alakai, to the U.S. Navy under the Defense Authorization Act of 2012. The Navy had planned to use the vessels to transport troops and equipment to training areas from Okinawa and other locations, helping the Navy meet the unique operational requirements without the need to build new vessels. In May 2012, the Navy announced that both Alakai and Huakai had been renamed. Alakai was to be named USNS Puerto Rico and Huakai was to be named . Guam was modified to replace the chartered * in Okinawa in March 2013, and Puerto Rico remained laid up until 2016. On August 19, 2012, HST-2 (then USNS Puerto Rico) was towed from Norfolk, Virginia to Philadelphia, to keep it safe from hurricanes while future uses for the vessel were being evaluated. On February 5, 2016, the U.S. Secretary of the Navy removed the name Puerto Rico from the vessel. The name Puerto Rico was subsequently reassigned to on December 14, 2016. Gulf of Maine ferry service On March 24, 2016, Bay Ferries Limited announced that it had reached an agreement with the U.S. Maritime Administration and the U.S. Navy for a multi-year charter of HST-2. The vessel would be operated for a passenger/vehicle ferry service in the Gulf of Maine between Portland, Maine and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia and retain the name HST-2, but the service and vessel would be branded as The CAT to align with previous branding used when Bay Ferries operated a high-speed passenger/vehicle ferry on the same route six years prior. The vessel underwent a refit at a shipyard in South Carolina and the service started on June 15, 2016.

Suburban and interurban passenger services in Brisbane and South East Queensland are operated by the Queensland Rail City network, a branch of Queensland Rail, which operates long-distance trains across the state. Aurizon and Pacific National operate freight services. History =Construction= Ipswich to Grandchester, 1865 The first railway in Queensland did not actually run to Brisbane, but ran from Ipswich to Grandchester. Opened in July 1865, the line into Brisbane was not completed until the opening of the Albert Bridge in July 1875. Branch lines in the city itself did not start until the next decade, with the branch line to Sandgate opened in May 1882, and the branch from Eagle Junction to Racecourse in September the same year. Lines were opened from Brisbane to Sandgate and Ascot in 1882. The first section of the North Coast line opened to Petrie in 1888. In 1891 this line was connected to the Maryborough line at Gympie, creating a through line to Mount Perry. A branch line was built from Caboolture to Woodford in 1909 and Kilcoy in 1913, now closed. A branch line was opened from Monkland (south of Gympie) to Brooloo in 1915. A line was opened from the first South Brisbane station at Stanley Street, Woolloongabba to Beenleigh in 1885, and extended to Southport in 1889 and Tweed Heads, New South Wales in 1903. This line was closed beyond Beenleigh in 1964.The Old South Coast Line Revisited Marggraf, E.W. Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin November 2003 pp422-427 A branch line was completed between Park Road station and Cleveland in 1889, although the section beyond Lota station was closed and since reconstructed. A new South Brisbane station was built on Melbourne Street in 1891. This became the terminus of the standard gauge line from Grafton in 1930 and Sydney in 1932. A dual gauge line was built from South Brisbane over the Brisbane River to Roma Street in 1978. A line was opened in 1980 from a junction near Lindum station on the Cleveland line to the Port of Brisbane at Fisherman's Island. This was converted to dual 1435/1067 mm gauge and extended in parallel with the duplicated passenger line to Dutton Park in about 1995 under the Keating Government's One Nation program. The Beaudesert line was opened between Bethania and Beaudesert in 1888, and closed in 1996. The Canungra line was completed to Canungra in 1915, now closed. The line from extended from Roma Street to Central stations in 1889, and to Brunswick Street station in 1890. The Ferny Grove line was opened from a junction at Mayne to Enoggera in 1899. The short Laidley Valley railway lines opened on 19 April 1911 but was never profitable. =Electrification= =Duplication= Oxley station's new platform and track (left) To increase the capacity on a number of lines, the rail network in Brisbane has required some tracks to be duplicated. In June 2004, Queensland Government announced rail duplication of the Gold Coast line between Ormeau and Coomera stations. Between 2008 and 2010, work was carried out to duplicate the tracks between Darra and Corinda stations. Work included a link to the Springfield line and upgrades to Oxley and Darra stations. In 2010, funding was allocated for the duplication of the rail line between Keperra to Ferny Grove. =Recent Extensions= Queensland Rail IMU109 at International Terminal station The Airport rail line opened to passengers in May 2001. Under a BOOT scheme ‚Äì build, own, operate and transfer ‚Äì the Queensland Government licensed Airtrain Citylink to build the rail line, to own and operate it, and hand the entire infrastructure over to the Queensland Government after 35 years when the company will then cease to exist. Airtrain Citylink contracted Transfield Services to build, operate and maintain the line and finally Airtrain Citylink contracted Queensland Rail to provide rolling stock for the rail line. Varsity Lakes station In July 2007, Queensland Government announced the rail extension for the Gold Coast line. The first stage was completed in 2009 which took the line to Varsity Lakes. It was later proposed to take the line to Tallebudgera but it didn't happen. A light rail line, G:link, on the Gold Coast opened in July 2014. The Redcliffe Peninsula line between Petrie and Kippa-Ring opened on 3 October 2016. =Proposed railways= The Maroochydore railway line is proposed to branch off the North Coast line at Beerwah and operate via Caloundra to Maroochydore. In 2011, the Queensland Government released a major transport plan Connecting SEQ 2031, which aimed to double public transport usage in South East Queensland. It proposed a number of service upgrades and rail extensions, including Cross River Rail, the Gold Coast light rail, a new high frequency Brisbane subway in the central city from Toowong to Bowen Hills, and a new North-west rail line branching from Cross River Rail at Alderley to Strathpine. = Cross River Rail = In 2017, work began on a second rail river crossing for Brisbane as the Merivale Bridge nears capacity. The project includes just under six kilometres of new underground rail, three new underground stations at Boggo Road, Woolloongabba and Albert Street, new underground platforms at Roma Street station, and an upgrade to the existing Exhibition station. The new inner-city route will be used by the New Generation Rollingstock. Operators =Passenger= Ipswich line between Taringa and Toowong Suburban and interurban passenger services are operated under the Citytrain brand of Queensland Rail, and are co-ordinated by TransLink. Long distance passenger services operate from Roma Street around the state under the Traveltrain brand, while an interstate service to Sydney is operated by New South Wales operator NSW TrainLink using its XPT fleet. In a city with a population of 2 million, passenger traffic on the suburban network doubled in the 10 years from 1979 to 1989 to reach 50 million journeys a year in 1989, and by 1992 it had increased by another 10%. =Freight= 2300 class on a freight service at Redbank station Aurizon operates the majority of freight services on both the standard and narrow gauges, with Pacific National on the standard gauge and their narrow gauge Pacific National Queensland division also operating services. The main rail freight terminal is in the southern Brisbane suburb of Acacia Ridge, located off the Beenleigh suburban line at the northern end of the line from New South Wales. A freight line was opened from Acacia Ridge to Fishermans Island and the Port of Brisbane in 1980, running alongside the Beenleigh line from Salisbury to Dutton Park, then follows the Cleveland line to Lindum. Dual gauge access on the line was promised by the Federal Fraser Government in 1983, but it was not until 1997 that the work was carried out, eliminating the break-of-gauge and enabling trains to run direct from the port across the New South Wales border. Approximately four million tonnes of freight is moved from outside South East Queensland to points within it; 1.1 million tonnes was to interstate destinations. One of the largest internal traffic flows is the movement of coal along the Western Line to the Swanbank Power Station and the Port of Brisbane. The Fisherman Islands intermodal terminal was opened in 1994. Other rail freight terminals have been located at South Brisbane, Park Road, Yeerongpilly, Clapham, and Salisbury.

It was released as a single, and the B-side contained an instrumental track titled \\"Amen, Brother\\". \\"Amen, Brother\\" contains what has now become one of the most heavily sampled drum breaks in the history of electronic music, especially jungle and breakbeat hardcore. This break has become known as the Amen Break. \\"Color Him Father\\" is an unabashedly sentimental song in which a boy expresses his love for his stepfather, a hardworking and generous man who married his widowed mother, who had seven children, and embraced them as his own after her first husband was \\"killed in the war\\". (\\"She said she thought that she could never love again/And then there he stood with that big, wide grin.\\") The song's lyrics resonated strongly with the public in 1969, the height of the Vietnam War. The word \\"color\\", in the song, means \\"label\\" or \\"call\\" and follows the 'color' motif set in Barbra Streisand's 1963 release of \\"My Coloring Book.\\" The song served as a major musical inspiration for the 2016 track \\"Celebrate\\" by Anderson .Paak.  Amen break  The \\"Color Him Father\\" B-side is \\"Amen, Brother\\", an instrumental interpretation of the gospel standard \\"Amen\\". The Winstons recorded it in early 1969 in Atlanta, Georgia. With the rise of hip hop in the 1980s, the break was widely sampled and became a staple of drum and bass and jungle music.

Keyes. This volume examined the ways in which tourism intersects with the (re-)formation and revision of various forms of identity, particularly ethnic and cultural identities. Since that time, various scholars have examined the intersection between dimensions of identity and tourism. The term \\"identity tourism\\" is sometimes taken to mean the act of assuming a racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, sexual or gender identity for recreational purposes. It may also refer to the tourism industry's representation and/or construction of ethnic identities and historical or cultural heritage.  History  An important early contribution to the study of identity tourism was Lanfant, Allcock and Bruner's 1995 edited volume International Tourism, Identity and Change.\\"International Tourism, Identity and Change\\". Retrieved on February 18, 2014. As with the Keyes and van den Berghe special issue of Annals of Tourism Research, this volume moved the field away from studying the impact of tourism on identity to investigating the intersection of tourism and identity in more dynamic ways, among other things looking at how \\"local\\" and \\"tourist\\" identities are mutually-constructed. Likewise, Michel Picard and Robert Wood's edited volume Tourism, Ethnicity and the State in Asian and Pacific Societies (1997, University of Hawaii Press), examined the ways in which tourism intersections with ethnic, cultural, regional and national identities, as well as with the political agendas of Pacific island and Southeast Asian states.\\"Tourism, Ethnicity, and the State in Asian and Pacific Societies\\". Retrieved on February 18, 2014. Abrams, Waldren and Mcleod's 1997 volume Tourists and Tourism: Identifying with People and Places also offered case studies examining issues surrounding the construction of identity in the context of tourism. Among other things the chapters in their volume investigated tourists' views of themselves and others in the course of their travels, the relationship of travelers to resident populations, and the ways in which tourists' quests for authenticity are entangled with their own sensibilities about their own identities. Case studies of tourism and identity include Edward Bruner's 2001 article \\"The Masai and the Lion King: Authenticity, Nationalism and Globalization in African Tourism\\", which examines how various Kenyan tourist sites entail displays of particular identities (\\"Masai\\" \\"Colonialist\\" etc.) and how tourists' engagements with these identity displays are varied, nuanced and complex, articulating with their own narratives, sensibilities about African heritage and quests. Kathleen M. Adams' 2006 work on tourism, identity and the arts in Toraja, Indonesia illustrates how tourism is drawn upon by different members of the community to elaborate different dimensions of identity. In \\"Art as Politics: Re-crafting tourism, identities and power in Tana Toraja, Indonesia\\",\\"Art as Politics: Re-crafting tourism, identities and power in Tana Toraja, Indonesia\\". Retrieved on February 18, 2014. Adams documents how tourism challenges older elite identities in the community, reconfiguring artistic and ritual symbols once associated with elites as broader symbols of Toraja ethnic group identity. Amanda Stronza's 2008 work on tourism and identity in the Amazon has illustrated how tourism appears to be causing new differentiation of identities within the community she researched (see \\"Through a New Mirror: Reflections on Tourism and Identity in the Amazon\\"). A 2011 edited volume by Burns and Novelli also offers a number of case studies on the topic of tourism and social identities.  Cyberspace  The emergence of the internet as a venue of identity expression is also relevant to the theme of tourism and identity; a 2011 edited volume on Tourism Social Media: Transformations in Identity, Community and Culture by hospitality and business school scholars spotlights some of these issues. Moreover, there are various programs and applications, such as chat rooms, forums, MUDs, MOOs, MMORPGs, and others in which a user is allowed to establish an identity in that particular space. This online identity could be different from a user's physical identity in race, gender, height, weight or even species. In chat rooms and forums, a user creates their identity through text and the way they interact with others. In MMORPGs, users create a visual representation of their identity, an avatar. This allows users to easily tour more than just ethnic and cultural identities. With the development of the internet and virtual reality, identity tourism can become more salient than previously thought. With virtual reality, for example, transgender individuals can control their own gender presentation in an MMORPG or forum. Lisa NakamuraNakamura, L. (2000).

Commissioned in the next day or so, the tug headed south on June 8 to join the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron.  Civil War  The Norfolk Navy Yard refitted Belle to serve as a torpedo boat so that she might help defend larger Union warships in the North Carolina Sounds against attacks by the Confederate ironclad ram CSS Albemarle that, the previous spring, had emerged from the Roanoke River and defeated a Union flotilla. Ready by late July, Belle and three other tugs were towed to Hatteras Inlet by the sidewheel steamer , entered the sounds, and proceeded under their own power to the mouth of the Roanoke River. There, Belle performed picket duty, ready to sound the alarm should Albemarle reappear and then to attempt to torpedo the Southern ram. She continued this duty until Lt. William B. Cushing sank Albemarle in a daring attack on the night of October 27‚Äì28, 1864. This victory cleared the way for a Union effort to retake Plymouth, North Carolina, on the last day of October 1864.

Green, took part in the operation lashed to the port and unengaged side of so that she might keep her partner in motion should that double-ender‚Äôs engines be disabled. The Northern warships entered the Roanoke River from Middle River above Plymouth and headed downstream toward the Confederate defensive works. About half an hour before noon, they opened fire; and, after almost an hour of bitter fighting, the Southern troops withdrew, leaving the Union forces in control of the area. Following that action, Belle remained in the sounds until after the collapse of the Confederacy the following spring. On April 10, 1865, the day after General Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox, Virginia, she had the satisfaction of accompanying the raised Albemarle to Hatteras Inlet, as her former foe began her voyage to Norfolk, Virginia.  Post-war sale and civilian career  Late in May 1865, Belle left North Carolina waters and headed for New York City where she was sold at auction on July 12, 1865 to Cozzens and Co.

The School is located in Saint-Lambert, Quebec, Canada and is the only English-language elementary school that serves the city of Saint-Lambert. The school is composed of three main floors. There are four classes in each level, two in the French immersion program and two in the English program. History Saint-Lambert Elementary began in 1875 as a one- room school building that was created in Saint-Lambert as a model school. Size increases due to enrollement and changes in the laws concerning education in the province of Quebec changed the school several times over its lifetime. In 1896, the current building was built at the cost of 3000 dollars. At this point the name of the school was changed from \\"Model School\\" to Saint-Lambert Academy. The building was once again extended in 1921 at the cost of 225 thousand dollars, and included two new wings to the original building, along with a gym and 10 classrooms. At this point the School's name was changed from Saint-Lambert Academy to Saint-Lambert High School. The school's name underwent another change in 1954, when the elementary and high school levels were split into different buildings, and Chambly County High School was created, at which point Saint-Lambert Elementary became the official and current name of the building. Different services have been offered at the school from time to time, one of which is the after school daycare service that is offered. Providing supersvision for children before and after the school day, the Daycare was started in 1985. Prior to 1998, St. Lambert Elementary was predominantly a French-language school. Four local English- language elementary schools were closed, and merged into St. Lambert Elementary. After the 1999-2000 school year, all of its francophone sector elementary school students were transferred to other Commission Scolaire Marie-Victorin French-language schools. =Margaret Pendlebury= In 1998-1999, Margaret Pendlebury Elementary School which was also located in St. Lambert closed and all of its 250 students were moved to St. Lambert Elementary. When a group of parents wanted their kids to be bilingual in 1965, Margaret Pendlebury Elementary became the first school to offer French immersion in Canada. By the mid 1970s French immersion ended at Margaret Pendlebury but St. Lambert Elementary School offered it. French immersion exists in every Canadian province and territory except Nunavut. =St. Francis of Assisi= In 1999-2000, St. Francis of Assisi Elementary School closed, another St. Lambert school, and most of its 150 students were transferred to St. Lambert Elementary. =Preville Elementary= Also in 1999-2000, Preville Elementary of St. Lambert's Preville district became a French-only school, meaning its Anglophone students were sent to St. Lambert Elementary or Harold Napper Elementary School in nearby Brossard. =St. Lawrence Elementary= In the 2000-2001 school year, St. Lawrence Elementary school in nearby Brossard closed, and most students and staff were relocated to St. Lambert Elementary.

He and his brothers James and Michael are considered the founders of industrial San Francisco. Born in Glasgow, Scotland of Northern Irish parents, his family moved to Paterson, New Jersey when he and his brothers were young. It was there that they learned the trade of machinists.Richard H. Dillon, Iron Men: California's Industrial Pioneers: Peter, James and Michael Donahue (Candela Press, 1984), pp. 9-26. In December 1847, Donahue helped deliver a gunboat, the Rimac (which he had helped construct at the Brown and Bell foundry) to the Peruvian government, arriving in Callao in July 1848. It was during his time in Peru that he heard of gold being discovered in California, and booked passage on the Pacific Mail steamship Oregon, bound for San Francisco.Richard H. Dillon, Iron Men: California's Industrial Pioneers: Peter, James and Michael Donahue (Candela Press, 1984), pp. 27-29. In 1849, after several unproductive months in the gold fields, and after hearing rumors that his younger brother James was in California, Peter returned to San Francisco, where he found his brother James running a modest blacksmith's shop at First and Mission Streets. Together with their brother Michael (who arrived some months later), they gradually expanded their forge into a foundry (which became known as the Union Iron Works). In 1852, with supplies and financial backing from his contacts in Paterson, New Jersey, and with the approval of city authorities, Donahue founded the San Francisco Gas Company, a forerunner of Pacific Gas and Electric Company. In 1860 Donahue founded the Omnibus Railroad, the first crosstown streetcar service in San Francisco. Using horse-drawn cars, he ran a line from Third Street and Townsend to Union and Powell, as well as one running from Montgomery and Washington to Howard and Mission Dolores. The Omnibus Railroad was later purchased by the Market Street Railway Company, which would subsequently become the Municipal Railway (Muni).Richard H. Dillon, Iron Men: California's Industrial Pioneers: Peter, James and Michael Donahue (Candela Press, 1984), pp. 135-137. In 1860, Donahue also organized the San Francisco and San Jose Railroad (which continues in operation today as the publicly administered commuter service Caltrain, while Union Pacific Railroad continues to provide freight service over this same route). In 1869, after failed efforts by Asbury Harpending to organize a northern line, Donahue acquired the rights to the San Francisco and North Pacific Railroad and constructed a line that went North from a landing on Petaluma Creek, that became known as Donahue, to Cazadero. He later decided to place the railhead farther south at Point Tiburon, building the railroad ferries that connected San Francisco to the Northern Counties.Richard H. Dillon, Iron Men: California's Industrial Pioneers: Peter, James and Michael Donahue (Candela Press, 1984), pp. 258-289. Donahue thus built the first railroad to serve Santa Rosa, California. Donahue's Union Iron Works constructed many of the graceful double-ended railroad ferries that plied the waters of the San Francisco Bay well into the 20th century. (The Eureka, built in his Tiburon yard five years after his death, can still be seen today at San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park on the Hyde Street Pier).

The film stars Charlize Theron, Jennifer Lawrence, Kim Basinger and Joaquim de Almeida. In Arriaga's directorial debut, he films a story that has multipart story strands woven together as in his previous screenplays. Filming of The Burning Plain began in New Mexico in November 2007, and the film was released in late 2008 in various festivals, before a limited theatrical release in 2009. The film was a critical and commercial failure. Plot Typical of Arriaga's works, this film is told in a nonlinear narrative, where events are revealed out of sequence. The following plot summary is in chronological order, thus does not reflect the exact sequence of the events as seen on screen. The story starts some time during the mid-1990s in a small town near Las Cruces, New Mexico (close to the border with Mexico), where Gina (Kim Basinger), a wife and mother to four children, is introduced. Gina is having an affair with a local man named Nick Martinez (Joaquim de Almeida), who also has a family of his own, but unbeknownst to the two, Gina's teenaged daughter Mariana (Jennifer Lawrence) finds out about their love affair. Mariana follows her mother to Nick's trailer. Knowing the two are inside, and in an effort to make them end their affair, she disconnects the gas pipe leading into the trailer and sets it on fire. The flames eventually reach a gas tank, which explodes, consuming the entire trailer and claiming Nick and Gina's lives, although Mariana had no intention of killing either of them. After Gina and Nick's funeral, Mariana and Santiago (Nick's son) (JD Pardo), slowly begin to develop a relationship of their own. Mariana soon becomes aware that she is pregnant with Santiago's daughter. The two flee to Mexico amid disapproval from their families and decide to have the baby there; after she gives birth to their daughter, Mariana abandons her family and changes her name to Sylvia. More than a decade later, Sylvia (now played by Charlize Theron) is working at a high-end restaurant in Oregon. Despite her success, she resorts to promiscuity and has persistent thoughts of suicide. Here, a mysterious man follows her around. It is Carlos (Jose Maria Yazpik), a close friend and business-partner of Santiago. After an accident involving their crop-dusting plane, the hospitalized Santiago urges Carlos to look for Sylvia, for whom Santiago has been searching since she abandoned him and their two- day-old daughter. Because Carlos does not speak English and Sylvia does not speak Spanish, he has trouble explaining to her the purpose of his visit. Instead, he surprises Sylvia with her now 12-year-old daughter, Maria (Tessa Ia). Maria, who was already reluctant to meet her estranged mother, is heartbroken when Sylvia hastily departs without speaking to either when she sees Maria and Carlos waiting for her outside her home. After realizing her mistake, Sylvia enlists the help of her friend Laura (Robin Tunney) to find Carlos and Maria. After reuniting, Sylvia, Maria, and Carlos go to Mexico, where Sylvia apologizes to Maria for the years she has been absent from her life. They visit Santiago, who is sedated due to the extent of his injuries. Sylvia confesses her past sins by his bedside, unsure if he will ever wake up again. The doctor reassures them that he will be fine, and the story concludes on a hopeful note.

Arriaga said that he wanted to write a script for himself to direct after 11 years of scriptwriting. The writer-director described the premise, \\"There are very intense love stories here that take place in different places and times, with characters trying to find the healing powers of love, forgiveness and redemption.\\" Arriaga wrote the story of The Burning Plain to weave together multipart story strands. The film was financed by 2929 Productions, and Constantini Films and The Weinstein Company purchased the rights to distribute The Burning Plain in Latin America. The film will have a budget of under $20 million. The Burning Plain began filming in New Mexico on November 5, 2007. Other filming took place in Portland and Depoe Bay in Oregon. Release The Burning Plain was screened at TIFF, the Toronto International Film Festival, in September 2008, before being screened at the Savannah Film Festival, which was held from October 25 to November 1, 2008. It was an entrant of the international competition of the 65th Venice International Film Festival. The Burning Plain was released in theaters on September 18, 2009. Reception =Critical reception= The Burning Plain has received generally poor reviews from critics. , it holds a 38% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 79 reviews with an average rating of 4.93/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"This heavily symbolic, melodramatic multi-narrative drama lacks emotional resonance.\\" Metacritic assigns a score of 45 (out of 100) based on 18 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Of the most positive reviews, David Gritten writing for The Daily Telegraph decided that it \\"has all the right credentials: it is serious- minded and dramatic, with universal themes and a clutch of fine acting performances.\\"Venice Film Festival review: The Burning Plain The Daily Telegraph, August 29, 2008.

Opening in late 1963, it is double tracked with staggered side platforms; the up platform (north, towards Waikanae) is on the north side of the Tawa Street level crossing, the down platform (towards Wellington) on the south. The station serves the suburb of Redwood.  Services  Redwood is served by Kapiti Line commuter trains operated by Transdev Wellington under the Metlink brand operating between Wellington and Porirua or Waikanae. Services are operated by electric multiple units of the FT/FP class (Matangi). Two diesel-hauled carriage trains, the Capital Connection and the Northern Explorer, pass through the station but do not stop. Off-peak trains stop at all stations between Wellington and Waikanae. During peak periods, trains from Wellington that stop at all stations may terminate at Porirua or Plimmerton and return to Wellington while a number of peak services run express between Wellington and Porirua and thus do not stop at Redwood.metlink, Paraparaumu Line timetable , accessed 30 October 2007. Travel times by train are fourteen minutes to Wellington, seven minutes to Porirua, and forty-six minutes to Waikanae. Trains run every twenty minutes during daytime off-peak hours, more frequently during peak periods, and less frequently at night. Before July 2018, off-peak passenger train services between Wellington and Waikanae stopping at Redwood ran every thirty minutesmetlink Kapity Train Line timetable effective from 20 January 2016 but were increased to one every twenty minutes from 15 July 2018. = Temporary closure = The station was closed for about four months, from 8 February to 3 May 2010, and renovated at a cost in excess of $1 million. New passenger shelters were constructed, and both platforms were demolished and completely rebuilt as higher, 170 metre long, platforms.Murray and Parsons, p. 226  History  Redwood is one of only two stations on the Paraparaumu Line not on track built by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company (WMR); the other is Takapu Road to the south. The WMR built the original route of the NIMT between Wellington and Longburn and it was purchased by the New Zealand Railways Department in December 1908. The original route between Wellington and Porirua via Johnsonville, now truncated to the Johnsonville Line, was bypassed in the 1930s by the Tawa Flat deviation. Redwood is on the northern section of this deviation. The deviation opened for freight on 24 July 1935, for passengers on 19 June 1937, and was electrified in June 1940, but Redwood did not open until 15 December 1963. The northbound Redwood platform is close to the location of the first Tawa railway station which was located on what is now Duncan Street north of the junction of Tawa and Duncan Streets, from 1885 to 1937. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, with housing development on Taylor Terrace south of Tawa Street and in the new Redwood subdivision to the southwest, there was a need for an additional railway station between Takapu Road and Tawa. The Tawa Street location was chosen as it had street access and there was room to provide car parks. The platforms were staggered north and south of Tawa Street to avoid the excessive operation of the flashing lights and bells and barrier arms at the Tawa Street Level Crossing (so that the train would not keep the warnings operating when stopped at the station). The crossing has vehicle half-arm barriers, but pedestrians and cyclists tended to ignore the warnings and could cross into the path of a second train. In 2018 the installation of four gates which automatically locked when the alarms were actuated was approved, at a cost of $900,000 (see CCTV photo of child cyclist ignoring warnings). The automatic pedestrian gates were opened in October 2018.

Cancer immunosurveillance and immunoediting are based on protection against development of tumors in animal systems and (ii) identification of targets for immune recognition of human cancer. Definition Cancer immunology is an interdisciplinary branch of biology concerned with the role of the immune system in the progression and development of cancer; the most well known application is cancer immunotherapy, where the immune system is used to treat cancer. Cancer immunosurveillance is a theory formulated in 1957 by Burnet and Thomas, who proposed that lymphocytes act as sentinels in recognizing and eliminating continuously arising, nascent transformed cells. Cancer immunosurveillance appears to be an important host protection process that decreases cancer rates through inhibition of carcinogenesis and maintaining of regular cellular homeostasis. It has also been suggested that immunosurveillance primarily functions as a component of a more general process of cancer immunoediting. Tumor antigens Tumors may express tumor antigens that are recognized by the immune system and may induce an immune response. These tumor antigens are either TSA (Tumor-specific antigen) or TAA (Tumor-associated antigen). = Tumor-specific = Tumor-specific antigens (TSA) are antigens that only occur in tumor cells. TSAs can be products of oncoviruses like E6 and E7 proteins of Human papillomavirus, occurring in cervical carcinoma, or EBNA-1 protein of EBV, occurring in Burkitt‚Äôs lymphoma cells. Another example of TSAs are abnormal products of mutated oncogenes (e.g. Ras protein) and anti-oncogenes (e.g. p53). = Tumor-associated antigens = Tumor-associated antigens (TAA) are present in healthy cells, but for some reason they also occur in tumor cells. However, they differ in quantity, place or time period of expression. Oncofetal antigens are tumor- associated antigens expressed by embryonic cells and by tumors. Examples of oncofetal antigens are AFP (Œ±-fetoprotein), produced by hepatocellular carcinoma, or CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen), occurring in ovarian and colon cancer. More tumor-associated antigens are HER2/neu, EGFR or MAGE-1.  Immunoediting  Cancer immunoediting is a process in which immune system interacts with tumor cells. It consists of three phases: elimination, equilibrium and escape. These phases are often referred to as \\"the three Es\\" of cancer immunoediting. Both, adaptive and innate immune system participate in immunoediting. In the elimination phase, the immune response leads to destruction of tumor cells and therefore to tumor suppression. However, some tumor cells may gain more mutations, change their characteristics and evade the immune system. These cells might enter the equilibrium phase, in which the immune system doesn‚Äôt recognise all tumor cells, but at the same time the tumor doesn‚Äôt grow. This condition may lead to the phase of escape, in which the tumor gains dominance over immune system, starts growing and establishes immunosuppressive environment. As a consequence of immunoediting, tumor cell clones less responsive to the immune system gain dominance in the tumor through time, as the recognized cells are eliminated. This process may be considered akin to Darwinian evolution, where cells containing pro-oncogenic or immunosuppressive mutations survive to pass on their mutations to daughter cells, which may themselves mutate and undergo further selective pressure. This results in the tumor consisting of cells with decreased immunogenicity and can hardly be eliminated. This phenomenon was proven to happen as a result of immunotherapies of cancer patients.  Tumor evasion mechanisms  Multiple factors determine whether tumor cells will be eliminated by the immune system or will escape detection. During the elimination phase immune effector cells such as CTL‚Äôs and NK cells with the help of dendritic and CD4+ T-cells are able to recognize and eliminate tumor cells. *CD8+ cytotoxic T cells are a fundamental element of anti-tumor immunity. Their TCR receptors recognise antigens presented by MHC class I and when bound, the Tc cell triggers its cytotoxic activity. MHC I are present on the surface of all nucleated cells. However, some cancer cells lower their MHC I expression and avoid being detected by the cytotoxic T cells. This can be done by mutation of MHC I gene or by lowering the sensitivity to IFN-Œ≥ (which influences the surface expression of MHC I). Tumor cells also have defects in antigen presentation pathway, what leads into down-regulation of tumor antigen presentations. Defects are for example in Transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) or Tapasin. On the other hand, a complete loss of MHC I is a trigger for NK cells. Tumor cells therefore maintain a low expression of MHC I. * Another way to escape cytotoxic T cells is to stop expressing molecules essential for co-stimulation of cytotoxic T cells, such as CD80 or CD86. *Tumor cells express molecules to induce apoptosis or to inhibit T lymphocytes: ** Expression of FasL on its surface, tumor cells may induce apoptosis of T lymphocytes by FasL-Fas interaction. ** Expression of PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cells leads to suppression of T lymphocytes by PD1-PD-L1 interaction. * Tumor cells have gained resistance to effector mechanisms of NK and Cytotoxic CD8+ T cell: ** by loss of gene expression or inhibiton of apoptotic signal pathway molecules: APAF1, Caspase 8, Bcl-2-associated X protein (bax) and Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer (bak). ** by induction of expression or overexpression of antiapoptotic molecules: Bcl-2, IAP or XIAP. = Tumor microenvironment = Immune checkpoints of immunosuppressive actions associated with breast cancer * Production of TGF-Œ≤ by tumor cells and other cells (such as Myeloid-derived suppressor cell) leads to conversion of CD4+ T cell into suppressive regulatory T cell (Treg) by a contact dependent or independent stimulation. In a healthy tissue, functioning Tregs are essential to maintain self-tolerance. In a tumor, however, Tregs form an immunosupresive microenviroment. * Tumor cells produce special cytokines (such as Colony- stimulating factor) to produce Myeloid-derived suppressor cell. These cells are heterogenous collection of cell types including precursors of Dendritic cell, Monocyte and Neutrophil. MDSC have suppressive effects on T-lymphocytes, Dendritic cells and Macrophages. They produce immunosuppressive TGF-Œ≤ and IL-10. *Another producer of suppressive TGF-Œ≤ and IL-10 are Tumor-associated macrophages, these macrophages have mostly phenotype of alternatively activated M2 macrophages. Their activation is promoted by TH type 2 cytokines (such as IL-4 and IL-13). Their main effects are immunosuppression, promotion of tumor growth and angiogenesis. *Tumor cells have non-classical MHC class I on their surface, for example HLA-G. HLA-G is inducer of Treg, MDSC, polarise macrophages into alternatively activated M2 and has other immunosuppresive effects on immune cells.  Immunomodulation methods  Immune system is the key player in fighting cancer. As described above in mechanisms of tumor evasion, the tumor cells are modulating the immune response in their profit. It is possible to improve the immune response in order to boost the immunity against tumor cells. *monoclonal anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies are called immune checkpoint inhibitors: **CTLA-4 is a receptor upregulated on the membrane of activated T lymphocytes, CTLA-4 CD80/86 interaction leads to switch off of T lymphocytes. By blocking this interaction with monoclonal anti CTLA-4 antibody we can increase the immune response. An example of approved drug is ipilimumab. **PD-1 is also an upregulated receptor on the surface of T lymphocytes after activation. Interaction PD-1 with PD-L1 leads to switching off or apoptosis. PD-L1 are molecules which can be produced by tumor cells. The monoclonal anti-PD-1 antibody is blocking this interaction thus leading to improvement of immune response in CD8+ T lymphocytes. An example of approved cancer drug is nivolumab. **Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cell ***This CAR receptors are genetically engineered receptors with extracellular tumor specific binding sites and intracelullar signalling domain that enables the T lymphocyte activation. **Cancer vaccine ***Vaccine can be composed of killed tumor cells, recombinant tumor antigens, or dendritic cells incubated with tumor antigens (dendritic cell-based cancer vaccine)  Relationship to chemotherapy  Obeid et al. investigated how inducing immunogenic cancer cell death ought to become a priority of cancer chemotherapy. He reasoned, the immune system would be able to play a factor via a ‚Äòbystander effect‚Äô in eradicating chemotherapy-resistant cancer cells. However, extensive research is still needed on how the immune response is triggered against dying tumour cells. Professionals in the field have hypothesized that ‚Äòapoptotic cell death is poorly immunogenic whereas necrotic cell death is truly immunogenic‚Äô. This is perhaps because cancer cells being eradicated via a necrotic cell death pathway induce an immune response by triggering dendritic cells to mature, due to inflammatory response stimulation. On the other hand, apoptosis is connected to slight alterations within the plasma membrane causing the dying cells to be attractive to phagocytic cells. However, numerous animal studies have shown the superiority of vaccination with apoptotic cells, compared to necrotic cells, in eliciting anti-tumor immune responses. Thus Obeid et al. propose that the way in which cancer cells die during chemotherapy is vital. Anthracyclins produce a beneficial immunogenic environment. The researchers report that when killing cancer cells with this agent uptake and presentation by antigen presenting dendritic cells is encouraged, thus allowing a T-cell response which can shrink tumours. Therefore, activating tumour-killing T-cells is crucial for immunotherapy success. However, advanced cancer patients with immunosuppression have left researchers in a dilemma as to how to activate their T-cells. The way the host dendritic cells react and uptake tumour antigens to present to CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells is the key to success of the treatment.

Like many opera ventures in Chicago, both succumbed to financial difficulties within a few years, and it wasn't until 1954 that a lasting company was formed in the city. First company, 1910‚Äì14 The first Chicago Grand Opera Company produced four seasons of opera in Chicago's Auditorium Theater from the fall of 1910 through January 1914. It was the first resident Chicago opera company, and was formed mostly from an arrangement by the directors of the New York Metropolitan Opera Company (at \\"the Old Met\\" on 39th Street) to acquire the assets of Oscar Hammerstein's dissolved Manhattan Opera Company. =Background= Hammerstein had been producing opera in competition with the Met for a number of years. His opposition, and difficulties arising from its own management disagreements cost the Metropolitan a deficit of close to $300,000 for the 1908‚Äì9 season; whereas Hammerstein made a profit of $229,000. He had opera stars such as Luisa Tetrazzini, Mary Garden, John McCormack and Mario Sammarco at his service. However, he had considerably less success at his Philadelphia Opera House the following season, and on January 1, 1910 he confided to the press : \\"The operatic war is suicide.\\" Otto Kahn and his associates at the New York Met offered to buy Hammerstein out, and on April 26, 1910 he accepted $1,200,000 for his Manhattan and Philadelphia opera houses, plus an agreement that he and his son Arthur Hammerstein would not produce any opera for ten years in New York, Philadelphia, Boston or Chicago. =History= The Chicago company was capitalized at a half million dollars subscribed by fourteen men, including: J. Ogden Armour, Martin A. Ryerson, John G. Shedd, J. C. Shaffer (in the elevator and grain business, part-controlled the Chicago Board of Trade), Samuel Insull, Charles G. Dawes, Julius Rosenwald, Charles L. Hutchinson, A. G. Becker, all of Chicago ; and William K. Vanderbilt, Otto Kahn, and Clarence Mackay. The latter three, all directors of the Metropolitan Opera Company, were represented in the affairs of the Chicago group by Andreas Dippel, previously second in charge at the Met under Giulio Gatti-Casazza, and who became General Manager in at the Chicago opera with Cleofonte Campanini as musical director. The company also spent several months each year performing in the city of Philadelphia where it performed at the renamed Philadelphia Metropolitan Opera House (previously owned by Hammerstein) under the name the Philadelphia-Chicago Grand Opera Company in order to \\"satisfy the civic pride\\" of that city.Special to the New York Times, The New York Times, March 8, 1911 The company notably presented the world premieres of Victor Herbert's Natoma (1911) and Attilio Parelli's I dispettosi amanti (1912). The company also mounted the United States premieres of Jean Nougu√®s's Quo vadis (1911), Karl Goldmark's Das Heimchen am Herd (1912), and Alberto Franchetti's Cristoforo Colombo (1913). Notable performers who sang with the company included (in alphabetical order) Paul Althouse, Marguerite B√©riza, Alfredo Costa, Armand Crabb√©, Charles Dalmor√®s, Dora de Phillippe, Enrica Clay Dillon, Jenny Dufau, Hector Dufranne, Minnie Egener, Amy Evans, Mary Garden, Jeanne Gerville- R√©ache, Orville Harrold, Gustave Huberdeau, Frances Ingram, Lydia Lipkowska, Vanni Marcoux, Carmen Melis, Lucien Muratore, Giovanni Polese, Albert Reiss, Myrna Sharlow, Tarquinia Tarquini, Luisa Tetrazzini, Alice Zeppilli, and Nicola Zerola among others. After a season with no performances, the company was re-formed as the Chicago Opera Association, which ran from 1915‚Äì1921, and was re-constituted as the Chicago Civic Opera, which ran from 1921‚Äì1932. Second company, 1933‚Äì35 The second Chicago Grand Opera Company was an attempt to keep opera going in Chicago after the collapse of the Chicago Civic Opera in 1932. It produced three seasons of opera at the Civic Opera House from 1933 to 1935 before it too succumbed to financial difficulties. It was succeeded by the Chicago City Opera Company, 1936‚Äì1939, and then the Chicago Opera Company, 1940‚Äì1946. There was no resident opera company after that until 1954, when the Lyric Theatre of Chicago was established, and re-named Lyric Opera of Chicago two years later.

Life  Villalpando was born in C√≥rdoba, Spain, in 1552. He joined the Society of Jesus in 1575 and for the Society he designed several buildings including the Cathedral in Baeza and San Hermenegildo Church in Seville. He studied geometry and architecture with Juan de Herrera, the architect of Philip II of Spain. After ordination, he specialised in the exegesis of the Old Testament. He published his Ezechielem Explanationes, or Commentary on Ezekiel, with Jer√≥nimo del Prado in 1596. He was accused of heresy, but a review of his beliefs and writings by the Spanish Inquisition found him innocent. That same year he travelled to Rome where he published additional volumes in 1604. He died there on 22 May 1608.  Work  A detail of one of Villalpando's representations of Solomon's Temple, cropped from a larger map of Jerusalem, note that he made other more intricate renderings focusing solely on the temple Villalpando's major work as a scholar was a commentary on the prophet Ezekiel, published with the support of King Philip II. This text included imaginative reconstructions of Solomon's Temple and depictions of Jerusalem, which were renowned and influential. He based them on the vision of the prophet Ezekiel and published them in his Ezechielem Explanationes. They inspired many European illustrators and were circulated among the master builders of the 17th century. His drawings were based on the assumption that the buildings of Jerusalem were designed using the laws of geometry, and they were drawn in parallel or orthographic projection, which is a form of image Villalpando likened to God's vision. Contradicting the theory developed by Vitruvius in De architectura, which sought to establish that the origins of the orders lay in the Architecture of ancient Greece, Villalpando argued that there was an original link between the classical orders and Solomon's Temple and that the classical orders had their origin in specifications detailed by God. The Inquisition's interest in Villalpando centered on his illustrations as possible misinterpretations of scripture. In the opinion of some art historians, Villalpando's illustrations of Solomon's temple influenced numerous monastery constructions of the baroque era, as well as on the grids schemes of urban planners. Villalpando's imagery was used in the design of Protestant churches and synagogues in the 17th century. Villalpando was a disciple of Juan de Herrera, architect of El Escorial, whose designs for that complex included quadratic inner courtyards and risalits. Some criticisms of Villalpando's work on Solomon's Temple bring up points with relevance to both architecture and philosophy. Criticisms of Villalpando reconstruction of the Temple include: that the sub-structure of the Temple in his designs is exaggerated, that his work lacks any archaeological basis or grounding in realism, that he failed to use Jewish sources apart from the Hebrew Bible such as the writings of Josephus, the Talmud, and the writings of Maimonides. Villalpando also wrote theoretical tracts on gravity, geometry and architecture, occupying himself above all with conveying the geometrical principles of constructions. Isaac Newton made use of Villalpando's works in his studies of architecture. Solomon's Temple Notes  References  Further reading * Hanno-Walter Kruft.

It uses a Stirling power conversion technology to convert radioactive-decay heat into electricity for use on spacecraft. The energy conversion process used by an ASRG is about four times more efficient than in previous radioisotope systems to produce a similar amount of power, and allows it to use about one quarter of the plutonium-238 as other similar generators. Despite termination of the ASRG flight development contract in 2013, NASA continues a small investment testing by private companies. Flight-ready Stirling-based units are expected by 2028. Development Development was undertaken in 2000 under joint sponsorship by the United States Department of Energy (DoE), Lockheed Martin Space Systems, and the Stirling Research Laboratory at NASA's Glenn Research Center (GRC) for potential future space missions. In 2012, NASA chose a solar-powered mission (InSight) for the Discovery 12 interplanetary mission, which would have otherwise needed a radioisotope power system for the planned 2016 launch (which, as it happens, was subsequently delayed until 2018).

VARI was named to The Scientist's Best Places to Work for Postdocs in 2009 and 2011 and to The Scientist's Best Places to Work in Academia in 2010. = Center for Epigenetics = The Center for Epigenetics was established in 2014 and is led by Chief Scientific Officer Peter Jones, Ph.D., D.Sc. (hon) whose early work helped establish the field of epigenetics. Scientists in the Center focus on identifying epigenetic mechanisms in health and disease states, and translating their findings into new treatments for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. = Center for Neurodegenerative Science = The Center for Neurodegenerative Science was established in 2012 and is led by Patrik Brundin, M.D., Ph.D, one of the top- cited Parkinson's disease scientists in the world. The center primarily investigates the underlying causes of Parkinson's disease and has several lines of research aimed at finding disease-modifying therapies, a current unmet need in the treatment of Parkinson's. Other diseases of interest include Alzheimer's disease and prion diseases. = Center for Cancer and Cell Biology = The Center for Cancer and Cell Biology is led by Bart Williams, Ph.D., an MIT-trained bone disease expert who was among the Institute's first scientists. It is the largest Center at the Institute and includes investigators studying the mechanisms underlying several cancers, including breast, pancreatic, sarcoma and prostate, and other diseases such as neurofibromatosis type I, diabetes and osteoarthritis. = Core Technologies and Services = The Institute's laboratories are supported by a Core Technologies and Services group that comprises eight shared scientific services: * Bioinformatics and biostatistics * Confocal microscopy and quantitative imaging * Cryo-electron microscopy * Flow cytometry * Genomics * Imaging * Pathology and biorepository * Transgenics and vivarium In 2017, the Institute established the David Van Andel Advanced Cryo-Electron Microscopy Suite as part of an expansion of its structural biology program. The $10 million investment included the installation of an FEI Titan Krios cryo- electron microscope, a Talos Arctica cryo-electron microscope and a Tecnai Spirit G2 BioTWIN screening microscope. The Institute also houses a College of American Pathologists-accredited Biorepository that contains more than one million formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks. = Large-Scale Collaborations = In September 2014, the Institute partnered with The Cure Parkinson's Trust on its Linked Clinical Trials initiative, which investigates repurposed drugs for use as disease-modifying treatments for Parkinson's. LCT has supported trials in ambroxol, exenatide, simvastatin, liraglutide and others. A month later, in October, the Institute announced a partnership with Stand Up To Cancer to form the VARI‚ÄìSU2C Epigenetics Dream Team, a multi- institutional collaboration to translate potential epigenetic treatments for cancer into clinical trials. The team is led by Jones and Stephen Baylin, M.D., co-head of the Cancer Biology Program at Johns Hopkins University's Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center. It has launched six clinical trials in cancers including metastatic colorectal cancer, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, non-small cell lung cancer and bladder cancer. = Research Leadership = In 1999, George Vande Woude, Ph.D., joined VARI as its founding research director. He previously served as Director of the Basic Research Program at the Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center as well as the Director for the Division of Basic Sciences at the National Cancer Institute. In the early 1980s, Vande Woude's laboratory discovered the human MET oncogene, which is now an important target in the development of anti- cancer drugs. He stepped down from his post as research director in 2009 to devote more time to his research. He is a Distinguished Scientific Fellow at VARI and is a fellow of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Vande Woude was succeeded by Jeffrey Trent, Ph.D., who served a dual role as research director at VARI and at Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen) in Phoenix, Arizona. Trent founded TGen in 2002 after 10 years at the National Human Genome Research Institute, a part of the National Institutes of Health. He left VARI in 2012 to lead TGen full-time. In 2013, Peter Jones, Ph.D., D.Sc., was named as the Institute's chief scientific officer after 37 years at the University of Southern California, where he most recently served as director of USC's Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center from 1993 to 2011. Jones's work helped established the field of epigenetics, particularly his seminal 1980 discovery that DNA methylation impacts gene expression and cellular differentiation. He is past president of the American Association for Cancer Research and is an elected fellow of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Association for Cancer Research Academy. Jones also serves as director of the Institute's Center for Epigenetics. Education Van Andel Education Institute (VAEI), founded in 1996, provides kindergarten to 12th grade inquiry-based science education programs for students, and sustained professional development programs and instructional tools for educators. = Leadership = Gordon Van Wylen, Ph.D., was appointed director of VAEI in 1996. Before serving as director of VAEI, Van Wylen was elected dean of the Engineering Department at the University of Michigan in 1965 and later served as president of Hope College in Holland, Michigan, from 1972 to 1987. Gordon Van Harn, Ph.D., was appointed director of VAEI in 2001 and served in this capacity until 2009. Van Harn was also an Emeritus Provost and Professor of Biology at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Marcia Bishop was appointed associate director of VAEI in 2004. She served in this role until 2011 when Jim Nicolette was appointed to the position of associate director. Steven J. Triezenberg, Ph.D., served as director of VAEI between 2009 and 2015. Triezenberg previously served as a faculty member of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Michigan State University for more than 18 years. Terra Tarango was appointed director of VAEI in 2016. Tarango previously held the position of president of Staff Development for Educators (SDE), a professional development company in New Hampshire, from 2012 to 2016. Tarango also designed print and digital curriculum for kindergarten through 12th-grade students at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. = Student programs = VAEI's student programs for kindergarten through 12th grade students include: * Summer Camps * Field Experience * High School Journal Club * Out of-School Time Cohort * Science on Saturday = Teacher professional development = VAEI designs and provides professional development workshops and instructional tools for kindergarten through twelfth grade teachers. Materials include downloadable lesson plans, interactive student journals, and classroom resources. = Science education tools = In 2015, VAEI launched NexGen Inquiry, a web-based instructional tool designed to help students and teachers meet Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) as well as other state benchmarks, and provides teachers with the tools they need to incorporate inquiry-based learning in their classrooms. = Van Andel Institute Graduate School = Van Andel Institute Graduate School (VAIGS) offers an accredited Ph.D. program in cell and molecular genetics that is designed to foster problem-based thinking and research leadership. VAIGS also offers an M.D./Ph.D. program in partnership with Michigan State University College of Human Medicine and Western Michigan University Homer Stryker M.D. Medical School. VAIGS was founded in 2005 under the leadership of then-VAEI director Gordon Van Harn, Ph.D. The first graduating class was in 2012. VAIGS was accredited by the HLC on November 12, 2013. Steven J. Triezenberg, Ph.D., was named the founding dean in 2006.  Purple Community  Purple Community, founded in 2009, is Van Andel Institute's grassroots community awareness and fundraising program. Purple Community helps individuals and organizations create fundraising events to support biomedical research and science education at Van Andel Institute. Architecture Van Andel Institute is located on the Grand Rapids Medical Mile. Its 400,000 square foot building was designed by architect Rafael Vi√±oly and was constructed in two phases; the first phase was completed in 2000 and second phase opened in December 2009. It includes 27,500 square feet of laboratory space, 71,000 square feet of laboratory support space, a demonstration lab, an auditorium and on-site cafeteria. The Institute's Phase II was awarded Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum status by the United States Green Building Council in 2011. The lobby features a 14-foot tall glass sculpture called \\"Life\\" created by Dale Chihuly designed to be an artistic representation of a DNA double helix.

Artistic directors included Carlo Peroni (1941-1942) and Fausto Cleva (1944-1946), and until 1945 Fortune Gallo was general manager. After the war, when consumer goods became more abundant and people spent less money on entertainment, interest in opera collapsed and the company went bankrupt. Rather than try to re-organize, the remaining assets were given to the largest creditor, the landlord of the Civic Opera House, Household Finance, who then paid off the other remaining creditors. After the final collapse of an opera company that had been re-organized five times, there was no resident Chicago opera company until the founding of the Lyric Opera in 1954.

The station plays Contemporary Christian music. The station transmits from Mullinax Mountain, between Euharlee and Wax, Georgia, due west of Cartersville and southeast of Rome (which is slightly closer), the same location for which WTSH-FM 107.1 applied to move to in early May 2012. Although very close to WCLK FM 91.9 in Atlanta, it can still be heard in parts of northwest and south metro Atlanta via broadcast translators. WCCV is also simulcast on sister station WJCK 88.3, licensed to Piedmont, Alabama. That station had no translators assigned to it until 2010, when W257CM FM 99.3 was licensed to the northeast of Talladega, Alabama. That translator is now assigned to WRYD FM 97.7 in the Birmingham, Alabama area. In March 2019, the station and network re-launched as The Message For You, www.themessage.fm with a larger focus on Contemporary Christian music programming. Translators In addition to the suburban stations in Woodstock and Morrow, Canton is also considered part of exurban metro Atlanta, though \\"North Canton\\" is not an official placename. The others are in northwest Georgia, or just beyond. Rossville is a suburb of Chattanooga, their city limits touching at the state line. In September 2011, the FCC changed the callsign of W265BD back to its original callsign of W265AV, which it had before a change to 100.3 in 1997. In 2002, it was forced to change back to 100.9 when full-power 100.5 was moved in from Alabama. This change apparently occurred when the station received its broadcast license to cover a power increase to 250 watts, which now sends the station as far as Canton, Acworth, Vinings, Alpharetta, and Dunwoody according to official FCC data plotted on Google Maps. W265AV 100.9 in Woodstock is still on Sweat Mountain, but had been assigned to retransmit WSB-FM 98.5, and in November 2010 was granted a construction permit to go from 7 to 250 watts at the same location and slightly lower height. This indicated it might be used to circumvent FCC caps on excessive concentration of media ownership by Cox Radio in the Atlanta media market, ostensibly rebroadcasting a digital-only channel from B98.5 FM. (The same occurred with unrelated W229AG 93.7, also non-commercial and on Sweat Mountain, and sold to a commercial radio company; other local \\"translators\\" have done the same.) however, it is still broadcasting WCCV, and is now officially assigned to retransmit WUBL. WUBL is also listed as the primary station for W221CG 92.1 \\"Kennesaw\\" (actually near Hiram/Dallas), which is also owned by Immanuel, and had a permit to move to north of Lithia Springs (its new city of license) at a power of 120 watts on 92.5, which caused its callsign to change to W223BP once licensed in March 2012. Also recently, Immanuel's W222AF 92.3 in Marietta was assigned to WGST AM 640, with a permit granted in April 2011 to go from 10 to 15 watts, and move from the Cobb EMC radio tower in Elizabeth southeastward to between Marietta and Smyrna, in the Laurel Valley apartments along Interstate 75 south of Delk Road. On the weekend of June 19, the station actually made the programming change from WCCV to WGST. Prior to this, an hourly on-air announcement stated that the station would be taken off-air permanently, and that the Woodstock station's power would be raised as a replacement. W222AF was then off the air, and it had a permit to move to the North Druid Hills tower site. It began rebroadcasting WGST AM 640 via WUBL's HD-R channel 3 (now 24/7 Comedy), but is still owned by IBN. It received a license to cover in early December 2011 after going on at reduced power the previous month, but often still gets heavy RF interference (or is even completely overtaken at night) to the north and west of the city from WDEF-FM 92.3 Chattanooga. This includes Marietta, which remains its city of license.

It forms part of a larger group of wares from the coastal region known collectively as \\"Canton stonewares\\".Valenstein, 273 The hilly, wooded, area provided slopes for dragon kilns to run up, and fuel for them,British Museum, meiping PDF,A.75(expand comments) and was near major ports. The area has been producing pottery since the Neolithic, and over 100 kiln-sites have now been excavated, but large- scale production of a variety of wares began under the late Ming dynasty, and continues to the present.Grove The Nanfeng Kiln has been in operation for some 500 years, and is now a popular tourist attraction.\\"A Visit to Fushan in 2006: The old Shiwan (Shekwan) kilns near Guangzhou (Canton)\\", by Jan-Erik Nilsson, gotheborg.com Shiwan wares have been in a variety of styles, many for utilitarian purposes. Mostly they are (in Western terms) stoneware. Three types of wares especially associated with Shiwan are roof tiles and architectural ornaments, and from the Qing dynasty onwards, imitations of Jun ware and popular polychrome figurines. Wares Glazed tiles and reliefs on a memorial archway in Hong Kong, 1920s Earlier wares were mostly thick, heavily glazed and designed for practical purposes, and later decorative wares were still relatively rough by contemporary Chinese standards. The kilns were large producers of roof tiles, including the ornamented or fully sculptural elements used for larger buildings. They also produced large but elegant storage jars called martabans, which were perhaps sometimes distributed containing food products, and sometimes as empty vessels. Both tiles and martabans were widely exported to the rest of China and East Asia. Production of these seems to have begun in the late Ming Dynasty, or perhaps the early Qing dynasty.Vainker, 146-147, 173 At the same time the Shiwan kilns began to produce more decorative wares, using a range of coloured glazes that imitated famous wares of the classic Song dynasty. In particular the blue-to-purple glaze of Jun ware was imitated, on a variety of vessel shapes, and small figures. Such figures were, and remain, a third speciality of Shiwan, made for an essentially popular market. Initially they featured the same Buddhist figures as blanc de Chine from Dehua, but by the 19th century models of folk heroes and some satirical figures were produced; Shiwan was the major producer of such secular figurines. Bird and animal figures were also produced, all mostly using coloured glazes.Vainker, 173 Shiwan figures functioned as the Chinese equivalent of English Staffordshire figurines. The human figures sometimes contrast flesh areas left in unglazed biscuit with glazed clothes and hair. Gestures and facial expressions are often dramatic.Grove The expansion of Shiwan's range may have been related to movements to the area of potters from Dehua and Jingdezhen. Unlike other kiln centres like Jingdezhen, potter's marks were often used, allowing some to build up reputations among collectors, and giving some information about the structure of the industry, and lineages of potting families.Vainker, 173 Helped by its proximity to Hong Kong, Shiwan continues to be a leader in contemporary Chinese ceramics design.Grove Shiwan wares provide a contrast with more conservatively rendered Dehua efforts. Clay for the ware was provided not only from the local area, but also from distant locations that could be mixed to provide a variety of textures and desired ceramic outcomes. The range could extend from a porcelain, rivalling Dehua in purity, to a rough stoneware. Shiwan ware was widely exported. Its glazing techniques directly influenced Japanese Shiga wares and others.

It is double tracked with an island platform, and is from Wellington railway station, the southern terminus of the NIMT. The station serves the suburb of Tawa.  Services  Tawa is served by Kapiti Line commuter trains operated by Transdev Wellington under the Metlink brand operating between Wellington and Porirua or Waikanae. Services are operated by electric multiple units of the FT/FP class (Matangi). Two diesel-hauled carriage trains, the Capital Connection and the Northern Explorer, pass through the station but do not stop. Off-peak trains stop at all stations between Wellington and Waikanae. During peak periods, trains from Wellington that stop at all stations may terminate at Porirua or Plimmerton and return to Wellington while a number of peak services run express between Wellington and Porirua and thus do not stop at Tawa.metlink, Paraparaumu Line timetable , accessed 30 October 2007. Travel times by train are fifteen minutes to Wellington, six minutes to Porirua, and forty-five minutes to Waikanae. Trains run every twenty minutes during daytime off-peak hours, more frequently during peak periods, and less frequently at night. Before July 2018, off-peak passenger train services between Wellington and Waikanae stopping at Tawa ran every thirty minutesmetlink Kapiti Train Line timetable effective from 20 January 2016 but were increased to one every twenty minutes from 15 July 2018.  History  Tawa Flat railway station was renamed Tawa railway station on the 23rd of February 1959 in conjunction with the change of name of the Borough of Tawa Flat to the Borough of Tawa. The area that had previously been known as Tawa Flat then became known as Tawa.Tawa Heritage, Wellington City Libraries. Retrieved 22 August 2016A little about the Tawa Borough Council, tawalink.com. Retrieved 22 August 2016 The original line through Tawa was built by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company (WMR) and the station opened on the 24 September 1885. At this time, the railway followed a circuitous route via Johnsonville to reach Wellington and Tawa was 16.48 km from the terminus. The original station was a flag stop at which trains would only stop if signalled to do so by passengers wishing to board or alight. It was located on what is now Duncan Street north of the junction of Duncan Street and Tawa Street and close to and above the present northbound Redwood railway station.Hoy, D.G.

When he was a ticket clerk on the mail train coming south on a wild night with a ‚Äúsoutherly‚Äù he was instructed at Paekakariki to cross with a special train at Tawa. The Tawa Flat station had only one ‚Äúdead end‚Äù siding which was too short for either train. So the south-bound train was split into A and C, the front and rear halves. The north-bound train was designated B and the following shunts were required: *A goes forward and reverses into siding *B proceeds forward along main line clear of points to C *A proceeds onto main line clear of the points by the length of B plus C *B places C into siding, then backs to main line and proceeds on its way *A backs into siding, couples onto C, and then proceeds on its way = Incorporation into NZR = The WMR was purchased and incorporated into the network of the New Zealand Railways Department in December 1908.

This deviation offered a quicker route to Wellington; it was 3 km shorter, avoided the steep grades and sharp curvature of the Johnsonville route, and rejoined the original route north of the new Tawa station. The new deviation was built on the floor of the valley below the level of the old railway requiring the construction of a new railway yard, island station platform, and a new station building at Tawa. The old station building was used as an addition to a local church.Hoy, D.G. Rails out of the Capital (NZRLS, 1970] p. 75 Freight services began using the deviation from the 24 July 1935 and passenger services on the 19 June 1937. On the latter date, the connection between Tawa and Johnsonville was severed and the double track deviation and the new station entered service allowing shorter journey times and a more intensive timetable. The line through Tawa was electrified in June 1940, and on the 15 December 1957, the single track north of Tawa was duplicated as far as Porirua.John Yonge (editor), New Zealand Railway and Tramway Atlas, fourth edition (Exeter: Quail Map Company, 1993), 16  Replacement of station building In 2012 the station building was found to have a 10 cm lean, and to be in poor condition due to major roof leaks affecting the structure. The building was closed after an inspection in January while the work needed to repair or replace the building was assessed.Murray and Parsons, pp. 226‚Äì227 The Greater Wellington Regional Council decided to replace the station building in June 2012; at an estimated cost for an erecting a new shelter in three months of about $600,000. The existing building would require earthquake strengthening and replacement of 80% of the structure, costing possibly $2 million and taking 18 months.

It was founded by and . This simplification of homotopy theory makes calculations much easier. Rational homotopy types of simply connected spaces can be identified with (isomorphism classes of) certain algebraic objects called Sullivan minimal models, which are commutative differential graded algebras over the rational numbers satisfying certain conditions. A geometric application was the theorem of Sullivan and Micheline Vigu√©-Poirrier (1976): every simply connected closed Riemannian manifold X whose rational cohomology ring is not generated by one element has infinitely many geometrically distinct closed geodesics.F√©lix, Oprea & Tanr√© (2008), Theorem 5.13. The proof used rational homotopy theory to show that the Betti numbers of the free loop space of X are unbounded. The theorem then follows from a 1969 result of Detlef Gromoll and Wolfgang Meyer. Rational spaces A continuous map f\\\\colon X \\\\to Y of simply connected topological spaces is called a rational homotopy equivalence if it induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups tensored with the rational numbers \\\\Q. Equivalently: f is a rational homotopy equivalence if and only if it induces an isomorphism on singular homology groups with rational coefficients.F√©lix, Halperin & Thomas (2001), Theorem 8.6. The rational homotopy category (of simply connected spaces) is defined to be the localization of the category of simply connected spaces with respect to rational homotopy equivalences. The goal of rational homotopy theory is to understand this category. That is, if one declares all rational homotopy equivalences to be isomorphisms, how much information is left? One basic result is that the rational homotopy category is equivalent to a full subcategory of the homotopy category of topological spaces, the subcategory of rational spaces. By definition, a rational space is a simply connected CW complex all of whose homotopy groups are vector spaces over the rational numbers. For any simply connected CW complex X, there is a rational space X_{\\\\Q}, unique up to homotopy equivalence, with a map X \\\\to X_{\\\\Q} that induces an isomorphism on homotopy groups tensored with the rational numbers.F√©lix, Halperin & Thomas (2001), Theorem 9.7. The space X_{\\\\Q} is called the rationalization of X. This is a special case of Sullivan's construction of the localization of a space at a given set of prime numbers. One gets equivalent definitions using homology rather than homotopy groups. Namely, a simply connected CW complex X is a rational space if and only if its homology groups H_i(X,\\\\Z) are rational vector spaces for all i > 0.F√©lix, Halperin & Thomas (2001), Theorem 9.3. The rationalization of a simply connected CW complex X is the unique rational space X \\\\to X_{\\\\Q} (up to homotopy equivalence) with a map X \\\\to X_{\\\\Q} that induces an isomorphism on rational homology. Thus one has :\\\\pi_i(X_{\\\\Q})\\\\cong \\\\pi_i(X)\\\\otimes {\\\\Q} and :H_i(X_{\\\\Q},{\\\\Z})\\\\cong H_i(X,{\\\\Z})\\\\otimes {\\\\Q}\\\\cong H_i(X,{\\\\Q}) for all i>0. These results for simply connected spaces extend with little change to nilpotent spaces (spaces whose fundamental group is nilpotent and acts nilpotently on the higher homotopy groups). Computing the homotopy groups of spheres is a central open problem in homotopy theory. However, the rational homotopy groups of spheres were computed by Jean-Pierre Serre in 1951: :\\\\pi_i(S^{2a-1})\\\\otimes \\\\Q\\\\cong \\\\begin{cases} \\\\Q &\\\\text{if }i=2a-1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 &\\\\text{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} and :\\\\pi_i(S^{2a})\\\\otimes \\\\Q\\\\cong \\\\begin{cases} \\\\Q &\\\\text{if }i=2a\\\\text{ or }i=4a-1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 &\\\\text{otherwise.} \\\\end{cases} This suggests the possibility of describing the whole rational homotopy category in a practically computable way. Rational homotopy theory has realized much of that goal. In homotopy theory, spheres and Eilenberg‚ÄìMacLane spaces are two very different types of basic spaces from which all spaces can be built. In rational homotopy theory, these two types of spaces become much closer. In particular, Serre's calculation implies that S^{2a-1}_{\\\\Q} is the Eilenberg‚ÄìMacLane space K(\\\\Q,2a-1). More generally, let X be any space whose rational cohomology ring is a free graded-commutative algebra (a tensor product of a polynomial ring on generators of even degree and an exterior algebra on generators of odd degree). Then the rationalization X_{\\\\Q} is a product of Eilenberg‚ÄìMacLane spaces. The hypothesis on the cohomology ring applies to any compact Lie group (or more generally, any loop space).F√©lix, Halperin & Thomas (2001), Corollary to Proposition 16.7. For example, for the unitary group SU(n), :\\\\operatorname{SU}(n)_{\\\\Q} \\\\simeq S^3_{\\\\Q}\\\\times S^5_{\\\\Q}\\\\times\\\\cdots\\\\times S^{2n-1}_{\\\\Q}. Cohomology ring and homotopy Lie algebra There are two basic invariants of a space X in the rational homotopy category: the rational cohomology ring H^*(X,\\\\Q) and the homotopy Lie algebra \\\\pi_*(X)\\\\otimes \\\\Q. The rational cohomology is a graded-commutative algebra over \\\\Q, and the homotopy groups form a graded Lie algebra via the Whitehead product. (More precisely, writing \\\\Omega X for the loop space of X, we have that \\\\pi_*(\\\\Omega X)\\\\otimes \\\\Q is a graded Lie algebra over \\\\Q. In view of the isomorphism \\\\pi_i(X) \\\\cong \\\\pi_{i-1}(\\\\Omega X), this just amounts to a shift of the grading by 1.) For example, Serre's theorem above says that \\\\pi_{*}(\\\\Omega S^n) \\\\otimes \\\\Q is the free graded Lie algebra on one generator of degree n-1. Another way to think of the homotopy Lie algebra is that the homology of the loop space of X is the universal enveloping algebra of the homotopy Lie algebra:F√©lix, Halperin & Thomas (2001), Theorem 21.5(i). :H_*(\\\\Omega X,{\\\\Q})\\\\cong U(\\\\pi_*(\\\\Omega X)\\\\otimes \\\\Q). Conversely, one can reconstruct the rational homotopy Lie algebra from the homology of the loop space as the subspace of primitive elements in the Hopf algebra H_{*}(\\\\Omega S^n) \\\\otimes \\\\Q.F√©lix, Halperin & Thomas (2001), Theorem 21.5(iii). A central result of the theory is that the rational homotopy category can be described in a purely algebraic way; in fact, in two different algebraic ways. First, Quillen showed that the rational homotopy category is equivalent to the homotopy category of connected differential graded Lie algebras. (The associated graded Lie algebra \\\\ker(d)/\\\\operatorname{im}(d) is the homotopy Lie algebra.) Second, Quillen showed that the rational homotopy category is equivalent to the homotopy category of 1-connected differential graded cocommutative coalgebras.Quillen (1969), Corollary II.6.2. (The associated coalgebra is the rational homology of X as a coalgebra; the dual vector space is the rational cohomology ring.) These equivalences were among the first applications of Quillen's theory of model categories. In particular, the second description implies that for any graded-commutative \\\\Q-algebra A of the form :A=\\\\Q \\\\oplus A^2\\\\oplus A^3 \\\\oplus\\\\cdots, with each vector space A^i of finite dimension, there is a simply connected space X whose rational cohomology ring is isomorphic to A. (By contrast, there are many restrictions, not completely understood, on the integral or mod p cohomology rings of topological spaces, for prime numbers p.) In the same spirit, Sullivan showed that any graded-commutative \\\\Q-algebra with A^1=0 that satisfies Poincar√© duality is the cohomology ring of some simply connected smooth closed manifold, except in dimension 4a; in that case, one also needs to assume that the intersection pairing on A^{2a} is of the form \\\\sum \\\\pm x^2_i over \\\\Q.Sullivan (1977), Theorem 13.2. One may ask how to pass between the two algebraic descriptions of the rational homotopy category. In short, a Lie algebra determines a graded-commutative algebra by Lie algebra cohomology, and an augmented commutative algebra determines a graded Lie algebra by reduced Andr√©‚ÄìQuillen cohomology. More generally, there are versions of these constructions for differential graded algebras. This duality between commutative algebras and Lie algebras is a version of Koszul duality. Sullivan algebras For spaces whose rational homology in each degree has finite dimension, Sullivan classified all rational homotopy types in terms of simpler algebraic objects, Sullivan algebras. By definition, a Sullivan algebra is a commutative differential graded algebra over the rationals \\\\Q, whose underlying algebra is the free commutative graded algebra \\\\bigwedge(V) on a graded vector space :V=\\\\bigoplus_{n>0}V^n, satisfying the following \\"nilpotence condition\\" on its differential d: the space V is the union of an increasing series of graded subspaces, V(0)\\\\subseteq V(1) \\\\subseteq \\\\cdots, where d=0 on V(0) and d(V(k)) is contained in \\\\bigwedge(V(k-1)). In the context of differential graded algebras A, \\"commutative\\" is used to mean graded-commutative; that is, :ab=(-1)^{ij}ba for a in A^i and b in A^j. The Sullivan algebra is called minimal if the image of d is contained in \\\\bigwedge^{+}(V)^2, where \\\\bigwedge^{+}(V) is the direct sum of the positive- degree subspaces of \\\\bigwedge (V). A Sullivan model for a commutative differential graded algebra A is a Sullivan algebra \\\\bigwedge (V) with a homomorphism \\\\bigwedge (V)\\\\to A which induces an isomorphism on cohomology. If A^0=\\\\Q, then A has a minimal Sullivan model which is unique up to isomorphism. (Warning: a minimal Sullivan algebra with the same cohomology algebra as A need not be a minimal Sullivan model for A: it is also necessary that the isomorphism of cohomology be induced by a homomorphism of differential graded algebras. There are examples of non-isomorphic minimal Sullivan models with isomorphic cohomology algebras.) The Sullivan minimal model of a topological space For any topological space X, Sullivan defined a commutative differential graded algebra A_{PL}(X), called the algebra of polynomial differential forms on X with rational coefficients. An element of this algebra consists of (roughly) a polynomial form on each singular simplex of X, compatible with face and degeneracy maps. This algebra is usually very large (uncountable dimension) but can be replaced by a much smaller algebra. More precisely, any differential graded algebra with the same Sullivan minimal model as A_{PL}(X) is called a model for the space X. When X is simply connected, such a model determines the rational homotopy type of X. To any simply connected CW complex X with all rational homology groups of finite dimension, there is a minimal Sullivan model \\\\bigwedge V for A_{PL}(X), which has the property that V^1=0 and all the V^k have finite dimension. This is called the Sullivan minimal model of X; it is unique up to isomorphism.F√©lix, Halperin & Thomas (2001), Proposition 12.10. This gives an equivalence between rational homotopy types of such spaces and such algebras, with the properties: *The rational cohomology of the space is the cohomology of its Sullivan minimal model. *The spaces of indecomposables in V are the duals of the rational homotopy groups of the space X. *The Whitehead product on rational homotopy is the dual of the \\"quadratic part\\" of the differential d. *Two spaces have the same rational homotopy type if and only if their minimal Sullivan algebras are isomorphic. *There is a simply connected space X corresponding to each possible Sullivan algebra with V^1=0 and all the V^k of finite dimension. When X is a smooth manifold, the differential algebra of smooth differential forms on X (the de Rham complex) is almost a model for X; more precisely it is the tensor product of a model for X with the reals and therefore determines the real homotopy type. One can go further and define the p-completed homotopy type of X for a prime number p. Sullivan's \\"arithmetic square\\" reduces many problems in homotopy theory to the combination of rational and p-completed homotopy theory, for all primes p.May & Ponto (2012), section 13.1. The construction of Sullivan minimal models for simply connected spaces extends to nilpotent spaces. For more general fundamental groups, things get more complicated; for example, the rational homotopy groups of a finite CW complex (such as the wedge S^1 \\\\vee S^2) can be infinite-dimensional vector spaces. Formal spaces A commutative differential graded algebra A, again with A^0=\\\\Q, is called formal if A has a model with vanishing differential. This is equivalent to requiring that the cohomology algebra of A (viewed as a differential algebra with trivial differential) is a model for A (though it does not have to be the minimal model). Thus the rational homotopy type of a formal space is completely determined by its cohomology ring. Examples of formal spaces include spheres, H-spaces, symmetric spaces, and compact K√§hler manifolds.F√©lix, Oprea & Tanr√© (2008), Theorem 4.43. Formality is preserved under products and wedge sums. For manifolds, formality is preserved by connected sums. On the other hand, closed nilmanifolds are almost never formal: if M is a formal nilmanifold, then M must be the torus of some dimension.F√©lix, Oprea & Tanr√© (2008), Remark 3.21. The simplest example of a non-formal nilmanifold is the Heisenberg manifold, the quotient of the Heisenberg group of real 3√ó3 upper triangular matrices with 1's on the diagonal by its subgroup of matrices with integral coefficients. Closed symplectic manifolds need not be formal: the simplest example is the Kodaira‚ÄìThurston manifold (the product of the Heisenberg manifold with a circle). There are also examples of non-formal, simply connected symplectic closed manifolds.F√©lix, Oprea & Tanr√© (2008), Theorem 8.29. Non-formality can often be detected by Massey products. Indeed, if a differential graded algebra A is formal, then all (higher order) Massey products must vanish. The converse is not true: formality means, roughly speaking, the \\"uniform\\" vanishing of all Massey products. The complement of the Borromean rings is a non-formal space: it supports a nontrivial triple Massey product. Examples *If X is a sphere of odd dimension 2n+1 > 1, its minimal Sullivan model has one generator a of degree 2n+1 with da = 0, and a basis of elements 1, a. *If X is a sphere of even dimension 2n > 0, its minimal Sullivan model has two generators a and b of degrees 2n and 4n+1, with db = a^2, da = 0, and a basis of elements 1, a, b\\\\to a^2, ab\\\\to a^3, a^2b \\\\to a^4, \\\\ldots, where the arrow indicates the action of d. *If X is the complex projective space \\\\mathbb{CP}^n with n > 0, its minimal Sullivan model has two generators u and x of degrees 2 and 2n+1, with du = 0 and dx = u^{n+1}. It has a basis of elements 1, u, u^2, \\\\ldots ,u^n, x \\\\to u^{n+1}, xu \\\\to u^{n+2}, \\\\ldots. *Suppose that V has 4 elements a, b, x, y of degrees 2, 3, 3 and 4 with differentials da = 0, db = 0, dx = a^2, dy = ab. Then this algebra is a minimal Sullivan algebra that is not formal. The cohomology algebra has nontrivial components only in dimension 2, 3, 6, generated respectively by a, b, and xb-ay. Any homomorphism from V to its cohomology algebra would map y to 0 and x to a multiple of b; so it would map xb-ay to 0. So V cannot be a model for its cohomology algebra. The corresponding topological spaces are two spaces with isomorphic rational cohomology rings but different rational homotopy types. Notice that xb-ay is in the Massey product \\\\langle [a], [a], [b] \\\\rangle . Elliptic and hyperbolic spaces Rational homotopy theory revealed an unexpected dichotomy among finite CW complexes: either the rational homotopy groups are zero in sufficiently high degrees, or they grow exponentially. Namely, let X be a simply connected space such that H_*(X,\\\\Q) is a finite-dimensional \\\\Q-vector space (for example, a finite CW complex has this property). Define X to be rationally elliptic if \\\\pi_*(X) \\\\otimes \\\\Q is also a finite-dimensional \\\\Q-vector space, and otherwise rationally hyperbolic. Then F√©lix and Halperin showed: if X is rationally hyperbolic, then there is a real number C > 1 and an integer N such that : \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\dim_{\\\\Q}\\\\pi_i(X)\\\\otimes {\\\\Q} \\\\geq C^n for all n \\\\ge N.F√©lix, Halperin & Thomas (2001), Theorem 33.2. For example, spheres, complex projective spaces, and homogeneous spaces for compact Lie groups are elliptic. On the other hand, \\"most\\" finite complexes are hyperbolic. For example: *The rational cohomology ring of an elliptic space satisfies Poincar√© duality.F√©lix, Halperin & Thomas (2001), Proposition 38.3. *If X is an elliptic space whose top nonzero rational cohomology group is in degree n, then each Betti number b_i(X) is at most the binomial coefficient \\\\binom{n}{i} (with equality for the n-dimensional torus).Pavlov (2002), Theorem 1. *The Euler characteristic of an elliptic space X is nonnegative. If the Euler characteristic is positive, then all odd Betti numbers b_{2i+1}(X) are zero, and the rational cohomology ring of X is a complete intersection ring.F√©lix, Halperin & Thomas (2001), Proposition 32.10. There are many other restrictions on the rational cohomology ring of an elliptic space.F√©lix, Halperin & Thomas (2001), section 32. Bott's conjecture predicts that every simply connected closed Riemannian manifold with nonnegative sectional curvature should be rationally elliptic. Very little is known about the conjecture, although it holds for all known examples of such manifolds.F√©lix, Oprea & Tanr√© (2008), Conjecture 6.43. Halperin's conjecture asserts that the rational Serre spectral sequence of a fiber sequence of simply-connected spaces with rationally elliptic fiber of non-zero Euler characteristic vanishes at the second page. A simply connected finite complex X is rationally elliptic if and only if the rational homology of the loop space \\\\Omega X grows at most polynomially. More generally, X is called integrally elliptic if the mod p homology of \\\\Omega X grows at most polynomially, for every prime number p. All known Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative sectional curvature are in fact integrally elliptic.F√©lix, Halperin & Thomas (1993), section 3.

The leftover of the refining process, called tailing, ends up in the fields of these villagers, hurting their crops and cattle. At present besides the open-pit mine and concentrator plant the project has also been provided with auxiliary facilities such as Tailings Disposal and Water Reclamation System, repair shops, Maintenance Garage, Water Treatment Plant, Warehouses, Fuelling Stations, 132 kV power sub-station, Waste Treatment Facilities and township with modern amenities.

Background  Ashina Hubo was said to be from minor branch of the Turkic imperial clan of Ashina, and his ancestors was said to have served for generations as subordinate khans to the great khans of Eastern Turkic Khaganate. His seat was near Altai mountains. In 630, after Eastern Turkic Khaganate collapsed and the Illig Qaghan Ashina Duobi were captured by Tang Dynasty forces commanded by Li Jing, Xueyantuo, formerly an Eastern Turkic vassal, took over most of Eastern Turkic Khaganate's former lands. Some Eastern Turkic Khaganate remnants wanted to declare Ashina Hubo the khan of Eastern Turkic Khaganate, but due to Xueyantuo's strength, Ashina Hubo did not dare to declare himself khan but instead surrendered to Xueyantuo. However, because Ashina Hubo was considered intelligent and capable, Xueyantuo was apprehensive of Ashina Hubo and wanted to kill him. When Ashina Hubo heard this, he fled north and gathered his people, declaring himself the Yizhuchebi Khan (or Chebi Khan in short). He made periodic pillaging attacks against Xueyantuo and gradually grew stronger.  Reign  In 646, Tang and Huige forces destroyed Xueyantuo and Ashina Hubo grew stronger, submitting Yenisei Kyrgyz and Karluks. In 647, he sent his son Ashina Shaboluo (ÈòøÂè≤ÈÇ£Ê≤ôÈâ¢ÁæÖ) to China to greet Emperor Taizong of Tang and offering to visit Emperor Taizong himself. Emperor Taizong sent the generals An Diaozhe (ÂÆâË™øÈÅÆ) and Han Hua (ÈüìËèØ) to escort Ashina Hubo, but once they arrived at Ashina Hubo's headquarters, they realized that Ashina Hubo had no intention of visiting Chang'an, despite strong advocacy by Ashina Hubo's son Ashina Jieman (ÈòøÂè≤ÈÇ£ÁæØÊº´). Han conspired with Ashina Hubo's vassal tribe Karluk (ËëõÈÇèÁ•ø) and their chief Nishu K√ºl Elteber to seize Ashina Hubo and take him back to Tang. When Ashina Hubo discovered this, Ashina Hubo's son Ashina Zhebi (ÈòøÂè≤ÈÇ£ÈôüËãæ) killed Han in combat, and An was also killed. Ashina Jieman, who had command of a substantial portion of Ashian Hubo's people, instead sent his own son Ashina Anshuo (ÈòøÂè≤ÈÇ£Ëè¥Èë†) to Tang to show submission.  Capture  In anger, in 649 Emperor Taizong sent the general Gao Kan, supplemented by forces from Uighur (Ch. Huige) and Pugu (ÂÉïÈ™®) tribes, made a surprise attack on Ashina Hubo. Once Gao's forces entered Eastern Turkic territory, Eastern Turkic vassals began to surrender, as did Ashina Jieman. In 650, Gao approached Ashina Hubo's headquarters, and Ashina Hubo tried to summon the vassal tribes for aid, but drew no response. He tried to flee with his favorite concubine, but was captured by Gao. Gao took him back to Chang'an, where he was spared by Emperor Taizong's son and successor Emperor Gaozong and given a general title. His territory was divided under three Tang commandants and 24 prefectures, with various tribal chiefs as commandants and prefects. There were no further historical records about Ashina Hubo, including when he died.

Greek Wine Cellars, formerly known as Kourtaki Wines, is a large Greek wine producer. Its brands include Kourtaki, Apelia, Calliga, and Kouros. , it sold 3.2 million cases of wine per year, about half in Greece and half abroad. The company was founded in 1895 by Vassilis Kourtakis, one of the first Greeks to formally study oenology. For the first part of its history it focused on retsina shipped in bulk to tavernas around the country. At Vassilis's retirement, the company was taken over by his son, Dimitris Kourtakis, who had studied oenology in Dijon, France. Dimitris introduced a line of bottled Kourtaki retsina, initially in 500-mL bottle-cap-topped bottles, and later also in 750-mL cork-topped bottles. This became very popular during the 1960s and 1970s; at its peak it was selling 60 million bottles per year, and propelled the company to market dominance. Dimitri's son, Vassilis Kourtakis, took over on his father's retirement, and began diversifying the company into styles other than retsina, partly as a result of the downturn in retsina's popularity. As part of this process, he introduced a number of new brands alongside the Kourtaki brand. Apelia was introduced as a line of low-cost table wines, while Kouros was introduced as a high-end brand (it became the first Greek wine featured on a non-Greek airline's wine list when Lufthansa added it). The company also purchased several other wine producers during this period, including Calliga of Kefalonia. To emphasize that the company had a wider set of offerings than the Kourtaki brand, Vassilis changed its name in the early 1990s from Kourtaki Wines to Greek Wine Cellars.

In this method, deletions are done by marking an element as deleted, rather than erasing it entirely. Deleted locations are treated as empty when inserting and as occupied during a search. The problem with this scheme is that as the number of delete/insert operations increases, the cost of a successful search increases. To improve this, when an element is searched and found in the table, the element is relocated to the first location marked for deletion that was probed during the search. Instead of finding an element to relocate when the deletion occurs, the relocation occurs lazily during the next search.

Urbanice  It is a small village in the Czech Republic which is located approximately seven kilometres southwest of Hradec Kr√°lov√©. It is in Eastern Bohemia. The village has got ninety-two houses which are registered. The neighbouring villages are Praskaƒçka and Libƒçany. A very interesting thing in this village is that about four or five families have got twins. = HISTORY = The first mention of the village Urbanice dates back to 1549. When Mr Henry V ( knight of the Vysok√°) bought Libƒçany. In 1561 he bought Praskaƒçka, Sedlice, Chr√°stnice (nowadays Kr√°snice) and Drbanice (today Urbanice) which then became a part of Libƒçany. After his death, his wife Anna was the owner until 1574 . It is not known who bought the village from the Royal Chamber. Many years later the estate fell into hands of Count Jan Straka (lord of Nedabilice). Is the legend about Straka which saying that his subject was very bad. Earl Straka died in 1720. The estate became the property of the Royal Chamber again. The name of Count Straka was engraved on one bell in the church Praskaƒçka. It was built at that time and belonged under the auspices of Libƒçansk√Ω. His name was on the bell until 1917. In this year the bells, as well as many other old Austrian bells were commandeered by Government for military purpose. They were taken to Vienna and spillaged. Only in 1872 the village was bought by Count Jan Harrach. At a time when the greater part of the village lands belonged to the Royal Chamber. The greater part of this land was bought by some citizens of Urbanice. At a time when the estate passed to Mr. Count Harrach, nothing left of our village under Libƒçansk√Ω estate. In house no.1, which was the first to have been built, which stood on the site today obviously Urbanice, was established coach pub.

The packet injection process allows an unknown third party to disrupt or intercept packets from the consenting parties that are communicating, which can lead to degradation or blockage of users' ability to utilize certain network services or protocols. Packet injection is commonly used in man-in-the-middle attacks and denial-of-service attacks.  Capabilities  By utilizing raw sockets, NDIS function calls, or direct access to a network adapter kernel mode driver, arbitrary packets can be constructed and injected into a computer network. These arbitrary packets can be constructed from any type of packet protocol (ICMP, TCP, UDP, and others) since there is full control over the packet header while the packet is being assembled.  General procedure  * Create a raw socket * Create an Ethernet header in memory * Create an IP header in memory * Create a TCP header or UDP header in memory * Create the injected data in memory * Assemble (concatenate) the headers and data together to form an injection packet * Compute the correct IP and TCP or UDP packet checksums * Send the packet to the raw socket  Uses  Packet injection has been used for: * Disrupting certain services (file sharing or HTTP) by Internet service providers and wireless access pointshttp://s2.ist.psu.edu/paper/cross- TR.pdfhttps://www.eff.org/ja/wp/packet-forgery-isps-report-comcast-affair * Compromising wireless access points and circumventing their security * Exploiting certain functionality in online games * Determining the presence of internet censorship * Allows for custom packet designers to test their custom packets by directly placing them onto a computer network * Simulation of specific network traffic and scenarios * Testing of network firewalls and intrusion detection systems * Computer network auditing and troubleshooting computer network related issues  Detecting packet injection  Through the process of running a packet analyzer or packet sniffer on both network service access points trying to establish communication, the results can be compared. If point A has no record of sending certain packets that show up in the log at point B, and vice versa, then the packet log inconsistencies show that those packets have been forged and injected by an intermediary access point. Usually TCP resets are sent to both access points to disrupt communication.https://www.eff.org/wp/detecting-packet- injectionhttp://www.icir.org/vern/papers/reset-injection.ndss09.pdf  Software  * lorcon, part of Airpwn * KisMAC * pcap * Winsock * CommView for WiFi Packet Generator * Scapy * Preinstalled software on Kali Linux (BackTrack was the predecessor) * NetHunter (Kali Linux for Android)  See also  * Packet capture * Packet generation model * Raw socket * Packet crafting * Packet sniffer  External links  * Packet Injection using raw sockets  References  Category:Packets (information technology) ","title":"Packet injection"},{"id":"13999275","text":"Roudnice is a village in the Hradec Kr√°lov√© region in eastern Bohemia, the Czech Republic. It was the birthplace of Franti≈°ek Xavier Matƒõjka (1793 - 1860), the father of the famous Polish painter Jan Matejko. The village is home to Roudnice Castle, the fourth largest castle in the Czech Republic. The first structure on the site of the castle was a fortress built in the 12th century, a popular summer retreat for Prague's archbishops and supposedly where Jan Hus was ordained as a priest. In the 14th and 15th centuries the original Romanesque building gained Gothic additions as it moved from religious to secular ownership. The fortress passed into the hands of the Lobkowicz family in 1603, when Zdenƒõk Vojtƒõch, 1st Prince Lobkowicz (1568-1628), married the castle's owner, Polyxena Pern≈°tejn (1566-1642). Their son V√°clav Eusebius, 2nd Prince Lobkowicz (1609-1677) undertook major renovations to the structure, commissioning two Italian architects to demolish most of the original fortress and construct a 200-room baroque residence. The new building included a theater, a clock tower, and a chapel decorated with magnificent frescoes, while riding stables and large formal gardens were developed in the grounds. Although most of the original fortress was demolished in the renovations, one vaulted room still contains the base of a 12th-century column. Roudnice became a repository for objects from the Lobkowicz family's collections, including works of art, religious objects, musical instruments, and books and manuscripts. During World War II, the castle and its collections were confiscated by the Nazi regime, and the building was used as an SS youth training camp. The library was gutted by the occupying forces and the castle's west wing was damaged by bombs in the last days of the war. When Maximilian Lobkowicz returned Roudnice after the end of the war, he began repairs to the damaged castle, which was confiscated again in 1948 when the Communist government came to power. Under Communist rule, Roudnice became a military music school as well as administrative offices, and housed the Central Bohemian Gallery of Modern Art, which still remains in the castle's riding hall. The castle was restituted to the Lobkowicz family in the 1990s, and they continued to rent Roudnice to the military music school, which eventually closed in 2008 after a loss of government funding.

In various urban activities, a vault is any type of movement that involves overcoming an obstacle by jumping, leaping, climbing or diving over an obstacle while using their feet, hands or not touching it at all. Although Parkour doesn't involve the idea of set movements, traceurs use similar ways of moving to quickly and efficiently pass over obstacles. Basic vaults *Safety vault/Step Vault: Similar to a side vault, except that the outside foot is placed on the obstacle and the inside arm is then released, while the outside foot pushes the traceur off the obstacle. *Speed vault: Like a step/safety vault, the outside hand is placed on the obstacle to act as a support, although, the inner leg launches the performer upwards and kicks over the obstacle and the outside foot is forced backwards to force the performer further. The performer lands upon the inner foot and continues running. Or, both legs kick up and over the obstacle like a side vault. *Two- handed/Simple/Side vault: Both hands are placed on the obstacle and the body goes alongside the arms, with the legs parallel to the obstacle. *Lazy vault: Approach the object from a parallel or diagonal direction. The inside hand goes on the object and you swing the inside then the outside leg over the object in one fluid motion. The other hand is then placed on the object to stabilize and help propel them over the object. Gif of a Lazy Vault *Thief vault: Similar to the lazy vault, except the inside hand touches the obstacle and the outside leg goes over first. This is usually used to change directions fairly quickly. *Monkey vault/Kong vault: Both hands are placed on the obstacle and are used to push the traceur over the obstacle while both legs are pulled up into a squat position with the hips raised to pass over the object. Can also be done in a diving motion over the obstacle. *Double Kong vault: A diving Kong vault with a monkey vault going into the move so that the hands are placed twice on the object. *Dash vault: A jump is performed over an object feet first while the hands are then placed down to carry oneself over. The result will be a sitting position halfway through the vault with the arms used to push off the obstacle. *Kash vault: A combination of the Kong/Monkey and a dash vault. The execution is similar to a monkey vault, except at the end of the vault, the traceur pushes them-self up in order to give some space for the legs to exit as a dash vault. *Turn vault: Similar to a side vault but with a 180 degree turn. One hand is usually placed in the underhand position while the other is placed on it normally and a 180 degree turn us performed typically landing in a cat grab. *Lazy turn: A lazy vault, but with a turn to land in a cat position. *Pop vault: The traceur will run at a wall and pop off the wall and propel them-self upward to overcome the obstacle and vault over it. *Gate vault: One hand is placed on top of an obstacle's surface while the other hand is placed on the side of the object and the traceur flips over the object. This move is typically done on gates or walls. *Reverse vault: Performing a backspin over an object while placing either one or both hands on the object to control the motion and to push off. *Reverse kong: A jump similar to a dash vault is performed, but a 180 degree turn is performed before the hands are placed down as in a kong vault and the traceur pushes off the object and turns back around to face forward. *Dive roll: A dive over an obstacle with a roll to withstand the shock at the end. *Drop vault: Any vault followed by a drop. *Wall run: An upward run up a wall. Can also be a run along the wall in a parallel motion to the ground. *Cat grab: Clinging to an obstacle in a squat position. *Cat leap: To jump for distance and go into a cat grab. Freerunning Vaults Many vaults are used for style rather than speed and efficiency as in Parkour *360 vault: Like a side vault, but with a 360-degree turn over the object. *Triple Kong: A kong with three taps. *Screwdriver: A kong with a 360 performed after the hands are placed. *Stinger vault: A kong with a 360 dive before the hands are placed. *360 Underbar: An underbar performed with a 360 rotation during the move *Sky vault: A one- handed cartwheel over an obstacle. *Vert vault: Hands are placed in a regular vault fashion but one leg is kicked up over one's head. *Rocket vault: Done in a lazy fashion, both legs go together and are perfectly straight, and the feet are grabbed by the traceur's hand. *Star vault: A cartwheel over an obstacle. *Sky vault: A one-handed cartwheel over an object. *Shoulder vault: To roll over an obstacle as efficiently as possible. *Barrel vault: A double legged reverse vault over the obstacle with one hand placed on it for balance and control. *Thief 360: A thief vault but with a 360-degree twist. It is usually immediately followed by a roll. *Palm spin: A spin on an object landing on the same side as in the takeoff. *Inside monkey: A monkey vault but the legs are outside the arms; the legs are still bent monkey-style. *Inside dash: A dash vault but the legs are outside the arms. *Dash 360: A dash with a 360-degree twist performed either before or after the dash. *Weave: Practitioner goes through an opening (for example, between two bars) and quickly comes out the other side. *Monkey roll: A monkey vault followed by a roll, without landing on your feet before the roll. *Butterfly vault: A side vault with a butterfly kick performed over the object. *Straddle vault: Performing a split in a mid air vault. *Split One: A lazy vault with a split performed after the traceur is over the object. *Leopard vault: Leaping from a higher object to a lower one placing slapping hands on lower wall and pushing off. *Scissor Vault: In a lazy motion, but the legs move side by side in a scissor like cutting motion. *Gate flare: Like a gate vault, but with the legs perfectly straight. *Rail flip: Two hands are placed on top of the obstacle and a front handspring is executed. *Cast bomb: A reverse Kong to a cast away. *Monkey gainer: A monkey vault, but with a gainer performed before the feet touch the ground. *Kong gainer: Similar to a monkey gainer, but with a Kong performed *Dash bomb: A dash vault, but with a front flip performed while still in midair. *Dash barani: A dash bomb with a barani, or 180 front flip, instead of a regular front flip. *Dash gainer: A dash vault performed with a gainer while still in midair. This move has yet to be landed. Combination of vaults *Magic vault: A side vault to a speed vault to lazy vault. *Kong to cat *Kong to precision *Kong to handstand *Screwdriver to kong *Double kong to cat References External links *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZhgIn4iVzg Over 103 vaults Category:Parkour techniques Category:Acrobatic sports Category:Outdoor recreation Category:Jumping sports ","title":"Vault (urban movement)"},{"id":"13999337","text":"Kunƒçice is a village in the Czech Republic.

Career In 1967, Seelbach played collegiate summer baseball with the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and tossed a no-hitter against a Chatham team that included Thurman Munson. He played baseball at Dartmouth College from 1968 to 1970 and still ranks among Dartmouth's all-time leaders in winning percentage (.688), strikeouts (162), and shutouts (3). Drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 1st round (12th pick) of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft, Seelbach pitched four innings for the Tigers in and became the Tigers' closer in , helping them win the American League East Championship. In 1972, Seelbach had a 9‚Äì8 record with a 2.89 ERA and was among the American League leaders with 61 games (7th in the AL), 14 saves (7th in the AL), and 34 games finished (9th in the AL). On April 20, 1972, Seelbach combined with Tom Timmermann for a two-hitter but lost to the Baltimore Orioles, 1‚Äì0, on a home run by Paul Blair.

Seelbach set down the Boston Red Sox 1-2-3 in the 9th inning to clinch the AL East title, as the game ended on a Ben Oglivie fly ball caught by Al Kaline in right field. Seelbach pitched in two games of the 1972 American League Championship Series, allowing four hits and two runs for an 18.00 post-season earned run average. A shoulder injury the next year ended his appearance in the league. He pitched in only 7 innings in and 7-2/3 innings in .

M. Phipson, businessman, naturalist, and longtime editor of the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society. Herbert Musgrave Phipson (1850 ‚Äì 7 August 1936), was a British wine merchant and naturalist who lived in Bombay (now Mumbai), India, from 1878 to 1905. As the honorary secretary of the Bombay Natural History Society, editor of its Journal, and manager of the Society's business and outreach activities, he played an important role in establishing the journal's reputation as the foremost natural history journal in Asia; he also influenced public science policy in the Bombay Presidency. His efforts saw fruition in the establishment of the Natural Sciences section of the Prince of Wales Museum of Western India. Phipson, who was married to the pioneering physician Edith Pechey-Phipson, co-founded, with his wife, the Pechey Phipson Sanitarium for Women and Children in Nasik, India. Biography Phipson was born in London in 1850 and educated at Clifton College.\\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. p77: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 He went out to India in 1878 as a partner in the firm of J. A. Forbes & Co., Bombay. Five years later, he established his own company, Phipson & Co. Wine Merchants. He joined the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) in 1884 and in 1886 became both the Society's honorary secretary and the editor of its journal. He married Edith Pechey, head physician at the Cama Hospital for Women and Children, Bombay in 1889. In 1906, he and his wife returned to England, on account of her ill- health, to which, however, she succumbed two years later. Bombay Natural History Society Gerard's water snake. Phipson was visiting England when the Bombay Natural History Society was founded on 15 September 1883. Upon his return to Bombay, he immediately joined BNHS and in January 1884 offered office space belonging to his business as a permanent home for the Society. Two years later, when the need was felt for BNHS to expand, he again offered the Society part of the larger premises he had acquired for his business at 6 Apollo Street, Bombay. This was to be BNHS's home for the next fifty years. From March 1886, when he succeeded E. H. Aitken as honorary secretary, to April 1906 when he returned to England, Phipson was the driving force behind the Society. He served as the editor of the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society for twenty years ‚Äì as the sole editor for fifteen years and then joint editor with W. S. Millard who succeeded him as honorary secretary. His main area of scholarly interest was snakes and, in spite of being tied down by his business and BNHS work, he found time to write the occasional note., See, for example, the humorous short note displayed in Figure 1, which lays claim for the familiar shores of Bombay to be included among the authenticated habitats of Gerard's water snake, which until then had been recorded only in Pegu, Burma. Academic and Public Science Phipson spent most of his BNHS-related work in three activities: on increasing the Society's reputation in the natural sciences by the publication of high-quality articles in its journal; on increasing the Society's importance to zoologists by building up its collections of both live animals and specimens; and on stepping up the society's public service efforts though its meetings and displays. During his tenure as editor, the journal became the best known natural history journal in Asia. The BNHS's ever increasing collection of live animals gave Phipson the idea of establishing a Society-managed zoological gardens in Bombay; this effort, however, failed, as the Bombay Municipality did not agree to the site selected by Phipson for the proposed zoo. A few years later Phipson was appointed to a committee charged with determining the feasibility of a public museum and library for Bombay. At one of the committee meetings, he proposed that three separate buildings be established, one each for an arts and archaeology museum, a public library, and a natural history museum. Phipson's proposal, including the site selected by him and the proposal for a separate building for natural history, was incorporated into the committee's final report presented in 1904; it found concrete expression in the inauguration in 1922 of the Prince of Wales Museum of Western India, many of whose natural history collections were both donated and managed by BNHS.

The Galeod solifuge Rhagodes phipsoni shown at the bottom right (3) Phipson's enthusiasm and drive for natural history and his readiness in making available to zoologists the collections of BNHS, resulted in a number of newly discovered species (many from BNHS's collections) being named after him. Among them was a new sea snake Hydrophis phipsoni (Distira cyrocincta) described by (see Figure 2); a new burrowing snake found in the Western Ghats, \\"Phipson's Shieldtail\\" (Uropeltis phipsonii)Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

Social Concerns In the early 1880s, George A. Kittredge, an American businessman in Bombay, had inaugurated the \\"Medical Women for India Fund.\\" The goal of the fund was to bring women physicians from England to work at a proposed medical institution for women and children in Bombay, which was to be staffed entirely by women, and to simultaneously lobby the University of Bombay, and its medical college to admit Indian women for medical education. Phipson joined the Fund, and soon became its secretary. It was through his activities at the Fund that Phipson met his future wife, Edith Pechey, who had just arrived in Bombay as Senior Physician at the Cama Hospital for Women and Children. He and Edith were married in March 1889. The Whip scorpion, Phyrynichus phipsoni described by Two years later, Phipson and Edith founded the Pechey-Phipson Sanatorium for Women and Children on the premises of their summer estate in Nasik, approximately north of Bombay, where they found the climate more hospitable. Here they constructed a convalescent community ‚Äì with almost two dozen cottages, a working-girls' hostel, and a library ‚Äì to which families or individuals that lacked the means to escape the \\"heat of the Bombay summer were invited to come for a month's stay; convalescent women and children especially were encouraged to take advantage of a health-renewing sojourn\\" at no rent and at nominal cost. Newspapers in Bombay advertised these accommodations and interested readers were asked to apply to Phipson and Co. for further arrangements. Return to England By 1905, Edith's health had begun to fail and both Phipson and Edith made a decision to retire and return to England. The following year, they sailed from Bombay to London with stops in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. In August 1906, soon after their return to England, Edith joined the Women's Suffrage Association of Leeds, and they both attended the conference of the International Women's Suffrage Alliance in Copenhagen. They also participated in the Mud March organised by the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies in February 1907. By this time Edith was seriously ill with breast cancer and diabetes and underwent surgery for the cancer. Although successful for the cancer, the surgery could not save Edith's life, and she died in a diabetic coma on 14 April 1908 at their home in Folkestone, Kent. In 1910, two years after Edith's death, Phipson established a scholarship in her name at the London School of Medicine for Women. The scholarship, initially valued at ¬£40 per year, and increased in 1919 to ¬£100 per year, was awarded annually to a medical student, \\"preferably to one coming from India or going to work in India.\\" The \\"Edith Pechey Phipson scholarship register\\" was to remain in place from 1912 to 1948. The \\"Pechey-Phipson Sanatorium for Women and Children\\" in Nasik, which Phipson had founded with Edith in 1891, continued to function until 1964. In 1916, during BNHS's \\"Mammal Survey of India, Burma and Ceylon,\\" the Indian race of the flying squirrel Petinomys vordermanni was named Petinomys phipsoni by Oldfield Thomas, who in the introduction to his paper said, \\"I have named this beautiful little animal in honour of Mr. H. M. Phipson, the former secretary of the Society, to whose initiative and enthusiasm the Society owes so much of its prosperity and to whose ready help most Indian Zoologists have at various times been greatly indebted.\\", H. M. Phipson died in London on 7 August 1936 at the age of 86.

These two albums were initially released on the now defunct Barnaby Records label which Buffett left prior to signing with Dunhill, a major label, and attaining mass popularity. Due to their limited initial appeal, long periods out of general release, and stylistic differences with the rest of Buffett's work, these albums were often not considered part of the chronology of Buffett albums by fans or even Buffett himself. However, especially from the late 1990s, they have been licensed to a number of minor record companies for re-release and there has been a proliferation of compilations including some or all of the songs from the albums.

Due to optimized code and memory allocation, Blue Board boasted very fast performance for a BBS on that hardware platform. In fact, Blue Board was faster than most if not all BBSs run on 8-bit computers. This speed combined with its use of the ASCII character set and XModem file transfer protocol rather than PETSCII and the Commodore-specific Punter protocol sometimes led users to believe that they were calling a BBS running on a much larger and faster computer. Developer Sikes originally created Blue Board for his own BBS, called Blue Hell, which he ran from his home under the pseudonym \\"Beelzebub.\\" He later went on to an Electrical Engineering degree from the University of British Columbia, then a long career in the video game industry, including as co-founder of Black Box Games (now part of Electronic Arts, where he worked as a programmer on the Need for Speed series of racing games, among others), before his sudden death while sleeping on December 24, 2007 at age 39.  Technical innovations  Among BBS software available in its day, Blue Board was notable in that it made creative use of the computer's limited RAM space, including the shadow RAM behind its ROMs, to store frequently-referenced data such as usernames, passwords, and message headers. This allowed the BBS to bypass the C-64's notoriously slow floppy disk system for many functions. The text of the message bases was kept on floppy disk in RWTS (Read/Write/Track/Sector) mode, bypassing the performance limitations of the 1541 floppy disk drive's file system. In addition, the entire BBS program was written in 6510 assembly code, further improving both speed and memory efficiency. Another extremely clever innovation was the use of a trick of perception to make the board seem even faster. Sikes was unable to eliminate a slight, but noticeable pause before displaying the main prompt, as the software had to do some serious cpu crunching before it was ready for user input. So he split up the processes into groups and executed each group of routines in between displaying a single character on a line, followed by a carriage return, after which it would perform another processing group, before displaying two characters and a carriage return, more processing, and finally displaying three characters, a carriage return and then the main prompt. The default character was an asterisk (*), but could be changed to any character by the sysop. Because the software was displaying these series of characters and carriage returns in between processes, the delay before displaying the main prompt was rendered imperceptible. Blue Board was one of the first BBSes, and probably the first Commodore 64 BBS, to support features such as voting and one-liners which they called \\"scribbles.\\" Additionally, it reserved a small block of the C-64's memory space for external programs that could include additional file transfer capability, or rudimentary games that presaged the door games that would become enormously popular on later BBSes.  Limitations  Because all user accounts and message headers are stored in the 64's limited RAM, which had to be shared with the program itself, the program only supported up to nine message areas and nine download file areas. Further limitations include a maximum of 239 user accounts, and a four- character password length. Each time the BBS was started, the sysop would have to enter the time of day, because the Commodore 64 has no real-time clock hardware. In addition, starting up the program was cumbersome. First, the program itself had to be loaded and run, then the RAM-resident user and message data had to be loaded, and then the disk had to be replaced with the message text disk. The whole process took several minutes.  Supported hardware  * Commodore 64 or 128 * Commodore 1541, 1571, 1581 disk drives : If the primary drive was the double-sided 1571, Blue Board could use both sides of the disk, one for the message text and one for download files. * Hard drives that interfaced as floppy disks, with a device number and CBM-DOS compatible command set. * Epyx Fast Load Cartridge * 1650, 1670 and compatible modems  Decline in popularity  At the peak of Blue Board's popularity (the latter half of the 1980s), many Blue Boards were in operation, and the software was widely pirated. As 8-bit computing fell into decline, so did Blue Board. The availability of more powerful hardware such as the Amiga, Macintosh, and entry-level PCs made feasible the development of more powerful BBS software in high level languages without the need for the kind of extensive optimization employed by Blue Board. However, Blue Board was instrumental in the social development of online culture in Vancouver which relied on text messages and email rather than file downloading, so it remained perfectly suited for that purpose long after the C64 platform became obsolete. It was not unusual in the early 1990s to find Blue Boards still thriving while BBSes run on far more powerful computers languished or were relegated to shareware file depositories. The real death-knell to Blue Board was the rise of multi-line chat systems, starting with DDial and progressing to STS and MajorBBS. It is not known whether any Blue Boards are still operational today.

The Larumna of Pomponius Mela and the Lorimna of the Tabula Peutingeriana perhaps refer to Loryma, although it is also possible that they may be identical with a place called Larymna mentioned by Pliny in the same district.  Location  Loryma was a small fortified town and harbour on the coast of Caria, not far from Cape Cynossema, at the western extremity of the peninsula known as Rhodian Chersonesus, opposite to and twenty Roman miles from Rhodes island.Sophrone P√©trid√®s, \\"Loryma\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1910) It was a fortified and was belonging to the Rhodians. Its ruins, west of Port Aplothiki, with towers, tombs and ramparts are described by William Martin Leake (Asia Minor, 223).William Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854) Above the bay of Loryma (modern Bozuk B√ºk√º) lie the ruins of a curtain wall surrounding the top of the hill. Constructed from large blocks of stone shaped in-situ, the remaining walls (up to several metres high on the outside) retain very precise corners and sheer faces.  Ecclesiastical history  Up to the 12th and 13th centuries, the Notiti√¶ episcopatuum mention Loryma as one of the suffragan sees of the Stauropolis, the metropolitan see of Caria. Le Quien names three bishops of Loryma: *George, present at the Council of Constantinople in 680 *Anthimus at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787 *Joseph at the Council of Constantinople in 879.

The diocese comprises the Department of Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques, in the Region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine. Historically, at one time or another, the diocese belonged to the Dukes of Aquitaine, the Kings of England, the Kings of Navarre, and the Kings of Spain. The people are Basques, and the Basque language flourishes. Its cathedral, the Cath√©drale Notre-Dame in Bayonne is a World Heritage Site. Elsewhere in Aquitaine, the diocese contains two former cathedrals: the Ancienne cath√©drale Notre-Dame de l‚ÄôAssomption, in Lescar; and the Ancienne cath√©drale Sainte-Marie , in Oloron-Sainte-Marie. Diocesan borders The southern boundary of the see, from the Carolingian period, was marked by a series of crosses high in the Pyrenees, of which the southernmost and most famous was Charles's Cross at Roncesvalles. Compare the discussion of the crux Caroli in Dubarat, Missel, p.xxxv-xxxvi. That a monument had a particular name does not inevitably mean that the monument was erected by the person named. The diocese of Bayonne gained much Spanish territory in 1030 from the Diocese of Pamplona: the four Archpresbyteries of Baztan, Lerin, Bortziria in Navarre and Hondarribia in Guipuzcoa,Cf. a remnant of Charlemagne's conquests beyond the Pyrenees.Cf. Dubarat, Missel, p.xxxii-xxxiv. The list is based on a bull of Pope Paschal II, allegedly of 1106, which has been identified as a forgery. In 1566, King Philip II of Spain, shocked and angry at the behavior of the Calvinist ruling family of Navarre, petitioned the Pope to save the Catholics on the south side of the Pyrenees by placing them for a time under the government of the Bishop of Pamplona. The diocese of Bayonne, therefore, lost territory to the Diocese of Pamplona, by virtue of a papal bull of Pope Pius V of 30 April 1566.J. F. Blad√©, \\"M√©moire...\\", pp. 445-447. Dubarat, Missel, p.xxxvii-xxxviii, who prints the text of the bull at pp. xxxix-xl. On 29 November 1801, the Bull Qui Christi Domini, of Pope Pius VII abolished all the dioceses of France and then restored most of them along the lines of the pre- Revolutionary system, but with the boundaries established by the Constitutional Church, which approximated the boundaries of the new French civil departments. The diocese of Bayonne gained territories from the suppressed Diocese of Aire, Diocese of Dax, Diocese of Lescar, Diocese of Lombez, Diocese of Oloron, the Diocese of Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges, and Diocese of Tarbes, which Pope Pius chose not to revive. Bayonne was a suffragan to the Archdiocese of Toulouse from 1802 to 1822. After two decades, it was realized that the territory assigned to Bayonne in 1801 was too large for efficient administration by one bishop, and since Catholicism was making progress in Gascony against Protestantism, the diocese of Bayonne was subdivided on 6 October 1822, and it lost territory to the reestablished Diocese of Tarbes. Bayonne was suffragan to the Archdiocese of Auch from 1822 until 2002 On 22 June 1909 the diocese was assigned the titles of the Diocese of Lescar and the Diocese of Oloron, which had been suppressed in 1801. The change was purely honorific and antiquarian. In the reorganization of the ecclesiastical structure of the Church in France, necessitated by accelerated urbanization and other changes in population, Pope John Paul II, on 8 December 2002, made Bayonne suffragan of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Bordeaux.David M. Cheney, Catholic-Hierarchy, Diocese of Bayonne (-Lescar e Oloron). Retrieved: 2016-09-28  History  Local tradition maintains that , the martyr, with whose memory is associated a miraculous fountain, was the first Bishop of Bayonne; but Leo was a priest of the third quarter of the ninth century, and his hagiographies insist that he had been Archbishop of Rouen before being sent to Bayonne by Pope Gregory (IV) or a Pope Stephen to evangelize the territory. As Honor√© Fisquet puts it succinctly, these lives have nothing really authentic in them.Leo's name does not appear in the list of Archbishops of Rouen in Gallia christiana XI (Paris 1759), pp. 19-26. And cf. : ... il faut avouer que, √† part de ces vies qui n'ont rien de fort authentique, aucune catalogue, aucune des anciennes chroniques de Normandie ne justifient qu'il ait occup√© le si√©ge m√©tropolitain de Rouen.\\" No bishop is historically known prior to the eleventh century. Some scholars think, however, that the fact that the town of Lapurdum (which later came to be called Bayonne), was designated as civitas (Roman municipality) in the Treaty of Andelot (587), indicates that the civitas must have had a bishop at that time.J. de Jaurgain, \\"ƒñtude historique et critique sur les origines du royaume de Navarre,\\" Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© des sciences, lettres, et artes de Pau (1896), p. 360. Duvarat, Missel, p. xxv-xxvi. That is just a conjecture. Others associate the foundation of the See of Bayonne with the establishment of the Kingdom of Aquitaine (778).J. F. Blad√©, \\"M√©moire sur l'√©v√™ch√© de Bayonne,\\" That too is a conjecture. Louis Duchesne concludes that, in the present (1910) state of the documentary evidence, no solution presents itself.Duchesne, Fastes II, p. 80 note 3. Bishop Raymond III de Martres (1122‚Äì1125) was given half of the city of Bayonne by William IX, Duke of Aquitaine.David Walker, \\"Crown and Episcopacy under the Normans and Angevins,\\" From 1152 to 1451 Bayonne was ruled by Eleanor of Aquitaine and her descendants, the kings of England. The royal coat of arms is to be found on one of the bosses in the vaulting of the choir of the Cathedral. In 1177, Richard, the son of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine, made war in Gascony, besieged Dax and its Count, Pierre de Bigorre, and then besieged Bayonne and its Vicomte Arnaud for ten days, and then marched south as far as Port du Cize (Port d'Espagne).J. F. Blad√©, \\"M√©moire...\\", p. 434. In April 1344, Bishop Pierre de Saint-Johan, O.P. was appointed by King Edward III of England to head an embassy to arrange a peace between subjects of the King and men under the control of King Alfonso XI of Castile and the Count of Biscay. Sainte-Marthe, Gallia christiana I, p. 1316. On 2 January 1345 he was appointed to head the Commission which was to engage in the late-state negotiations for the treaty of marriage of the King's son John with a daughter of King Alfonso.Rymer, p.170. On 14 February 1348 Bishop de Saint-Johan was named one of the arbitrators on claims and complaints between English and Castilian subjects. Also given powers as arbitrators were the Sacristan, the Major Chaplain, and another of the Canons of the Cathedral, and others. =Cathedral and Chapter= The replacement for the old Romanesque cathedral, whose history is lost, was begun under Arnaud Loup de Bessabat, ca. 1140-1141. In 1199 and again in 1224, fires damaged the fabric, and in 1258 another fire destroyed half of the city of Bayonne and much of the choir of the Cathedral. Reconstruction began almost immediately in the Gothic style. In 1310 yet another fire destroyed most of what still remained of the Romanesque building; the more recent Gothic work remained untouched.Dubarat, Missel, p. cix. Saint- Vanne, pp. 15-16. The original main altar of the Gothic cathedral had on its sides the arms of Cardinal Guillaume Pierre Godin, who died in 1335.Dubarat, Missel, p. cxvii. The new altar, sanctuary and choir were the work of Bishop Ren√©-Fran√ßois de Beauvau du Rivau (1701‚Äì1707).Dubarat, Missel, p. cvi. The Canons of the Cathedral Chapter of Bayonne are attested as early as the 12th century, living perhaps under the Rule of the Canons of Saint Augustine.Dubarat, Missel, p. cxliii. During the Great Schism (1378‚Äì1416), the number of Canons increased to a total of eighteen: eight of them supporting one side resided in Bayonne, eight others who supported the other pope resided in Basse-Navarre at St-Jean-Pied-de-Porte. The Council of Constance took cognizance of the situation in its 31st Session, and ordered that the number be reduced to the traditional twelve.Dubarat, Missel, p. clxv. In the 17th and 18th centuries there were only the twelve Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, V, p. 112 note 1; VI, p. 113, note 1. The Chapter of Bayonne had a set of Statutes as early as 1322, which are known to have regulated the distributions which came to the Canons by virtue of their office.Dubarat, Missel, p. ccxxiii. In 1533 Bishop √âtienne de Poncher (1532‚Äì1551) published Statutes of the Synod, which included legislation on the practices of the choir, which the Canons discussed and accepted, but which had become a dead letter by 1570, due no doubt to the protestantization of the Gascon part of the diocese, and the partition ordered by Pope Pius V in 1566.Dubarat, Missel, p. ccxxi. On 15 August 1676, Bishop Jean d'Olce issued new Statutes for the Cathedral Chapter on the recommendation of the Promoter of the Diocese, in order to address various abuses in the carrying out of sacred ceremonies. This enactment lasted well into the 18th century.Dubarat, Missel, p. ccxxii. The Cathedral Chapter was dissolved in 1790, along with all the other chapters in France.Philippe Bourdin, \\"Coll√©giales et chapitres cath√©draux au crible de l'opinion et de la R√©volution,\\" Annales historiques de la R√©volution fran√ßaise no. 331 (janvier/mars 2003), 29-55, at 29-30, 52-53. By the 12th or 13th century, the diocese north of the Pyrenees had three Archdeacons: Labourde, Cize, and Arberoue. South of the Pyrenees was the Archdeaconry of Baztan. All seem to have disappeared by the beginning of the 16th century.Dubarat, Missel, p. xxxvii, cxliii. The diocese also contained two monasteries, both of Premonstratensians: Leuntium (La Honce), a few miles east of Bayonne; and Urdacium (Ourdace), in Navarre.Sainte-Marthe, Gallia christiana I, pp. 1323-1326. Jean, p. 77. Both were dissolved by the National Assembly in 1790, and their property sold for the benefit of the people. At the beginning of the 18th century there were seven houses of religious in Bayonne, the Dominicans, the Franciscans, the Carmelites, the Augustinians, the Capuchins, the Clarisses, and the Recollects.Sainte-Marthe, Gallia christiana I, pp. 1309-1310. The first five named were for men, the last two were convents for women. In 1745 there were also five houses of religious men.Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 113 note 1. =Revolution and Concordat= During the French Revolution the diocese of Bayonne was suppressed by the Legislative Assembly, under the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790). Its territory was subsumed into the new diocese, called 'Basses-Pyrenees', which was coterminous with the new civil department of the same name. The dioceses of Oloron and Lescar were also suppressed and their bishops dismissed, and their territories were joined to the former diocese of Oleron, with the seat of the Constitutuonal Diocese at Oloron. Basses-Pyrenees was made part of the Metropolitanate called the 'M√©tropole du Sud'. A Constitutional Bishop was elected, Barth√©l√©my-Jean- Baptiste Sanadon. Sanadon was principal of the Coll√®ge de Pau, when he was called on to take the oath to the Civil Constitution. On 1 March 1791 he was elected Constitutional Bishop of Hautes-Pyren√©es by a vote of 174 to 96. He was consecrated a bishop in Paris on 26 April by Constitutional Bishop Jean- Baptiste Gobel. The consecration was valid but illicit and uncanonical. Sanadon and Gobel and all the other Constitutional bishops were schismatic. On Sanadon's return to Pau, the Vicar General of the legitimate bishop of Oloron excommunicated him. He was a member of the Convention which voted on the execution of King Louis XVI, which he opposed. His opposition brought him under suspicion of the Jacobins, and he was arrested and imprisoned in Bayonne. He was released, but died on 9 January 1796.Dubarat, Missel, p. cvii. The Cathedral Chapter and the Archdeaconries were reestablished by a decree of Bishop Paul d'Astros on 18 September 1821, though only two archdeaconries were created, Bayonne and Pau, and the two Archdeacons also bore the title of Vicar General. The decree also reorganized the diocese into five districts, each headed by an Archpriest, who supervised 40 Deans and 440 parishes.Dubarat, Missel, p. cxliii. In World War I, 560 priests and seminarians were mobilized from the diocese of Bayonne, 50 of whom died. In 1921 there were 40 Deaneries and 507 parishes.Anonymous, \\"Bayonne,\\" Catholic Encyclopedia Volume XVII Supplement 1 (New York 1922), p. 88. In 2009 Bishop Marc Aillet reestablished the Major Seminary for the diocese of Bayonne. A new seminary building, Le S√©minaire des Saints C≈ìurs de J√©sus et de Marie et de la prop√©deutique Sainte- Croix, opened on 1 October 2016. There is also the Grand S√©minaire Saint- Joseph in Bordeaux. In 2017 there were 234 priests incardinated (licensed by the bishop to function) in the Diocese of Bayonne, of whom 168 were on active service.

Jaurgain, pp. 573‚Äì590. : [L√©on I (c. 900?)]Sainte-Marthe, in Gallia christiana I, p. 1309, emphatically states that Leo should be deleted from the episcopal list, nam quae de eo narrantur, omnia fabulam redolent, nec ulla umbra veritatis vel verisimilitudinis eius episcopatus potest stabiliri. (What is said of him all reeks of fable, nor can a ghost of truth or plausibility be established about his episcopacy). All of the stories concerning Leo are collected and analysed by Dubarat, Missel, pp. xxxviii‚Äìlxxxviii. The material is mostly derived from prayer books (breviaria). : [Arsius (c. 980)]Sainte-Marthe, in Gallia christiana I, p. 1310, states, Porro hic Arsias videtur idem esse ac Arsias Racha, de quo in episcopis Olorensibus et aliis iam actum. (Arsius seems to be the same person as Arsias Racha, bishop of Oloron). There are five documents referring to Arsius. All five are forgeries: J. F.

It is within the traditional tribal lands of NgƒÅti Maru iwi. Today, NgƒÅti Maru's headquarters are at Tarata. The Marae is called Te Upoko o te Whenua.  History  =Bell at Purangi= The locality of Purangi, includes the sites of three Maori kainga; Pukemahoe, Purangi and Te Pokuru Pa. The first two were on the banks of the Waitara River, about a mile and a half apart. Te Pokuru Pa was six or seven miles from Pukemahoe. The story of the bell begins with Rev. Richard Taylor, Missionary of the Whanganui district. He placed the charge of the bell with Himiona Te Kapiti, a Maori layreader. At the time, Himiona lived on the upper reaches of the Whanganui river and was mainly responsible for the extension of Christianity in those districts. From Himiona the bell passed into the hands of Te Manihera Te Ikahaehae, also a layreader, of the NgƒÅti Maru. The bell was first used at Te Pokuru Pa, but the Pa was later deserted. During the 1850s, Ngati Maru erected an Anglican church at Pukemahoe, and so the bell was carried there. Once the bell was fixed in its place, Ngati Maru brought Archdeacon Govett (1819-1903) to open the church. There was much festivities on his arrival, for at the time he was the first white missionary who had ever gone into that part of the country. The chief of Purangi was Tutanuku Tume, elder brother of Te Manihera Tume. Both men were the nephews of Te Manihera Te Ikahaehae referred to above. When the New Zealand Wars broke out in 1860, the newspaper of the day states that Titokowaru (a Hauhau chief and freedom fighter against the Pakeha) desecrated the church. He tore up the floor and converted the church into a Wharenui (Maori meeting house). If this was the case, this did not happen until 1869, when Titokowaru arrived in the Ngati Maru rohe. Te Haina'Uira'Wehikore, Manihera's sister, took charge of the bell, and kept it in her care. In 1888, she met with WH Skinner at Purangi and asked him to accept the bell back. She had two bells, a large one from the Anglican Church, and a smaller one from the Roman Catholic Mission at Ngakorako. Skinner accepted both bells, and returned the Roman Catholic bell to the priest in charge of New Plymouth and the Anglican bell to St Mary's parish. This bell was attached to St Marys Schoolroom, and it was still there at the turn of the 20th century. =Purangi Landless Natives Act 1907= Large areas of land were confiscated in Taranaki under the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863 and its subsequent amendments. This rendered many Maori landless. In 1907, the Crown passed legislation that allowed for the landless Maori at Purangi to be provided with enough land each to support themselves. This legislation was called the Purangi Landless Natives Act 1907. The First Schedule of the Act, listed the Maori who were entitled to receive land under this legislation. They were Tutanuku Tume, Te Ika Haehae, Kapohanga Wehikore, Uira Wehikore and 15 others. Te Ikahaehae in this schedule was also known as Te Manihera Te Ikahaehae.

Founded in 1852, the club is the second oldest social club in New York.Elite Membership Clubs Get A Makeover It is located at 4 East 60th Street, in a building designed by Stanford White. History Originally named the Gesellschaft Harmonie, the club was founded on October 16, 1852 by N. Gutman, M. Werner, H. Beer, Herman Cohn, Charles Werner, and Sigmund Werner. Although prominent German Jews, the group was reportedly denied admission to the Union Club, which had a tacit policy of discrimination. The club's original charter provided that it was created to provide \\"mutually beneficial entertainment, occasional singing entertainments, lectures, etc\\" for recent German immigrants. The first meeting of the club was held November 8, 1852 in a rented room on Broome Street with thirty-nine members in attendance. Between 1852 and 1867, the burgeoning club was regularly moved as the membership outgrew each rented space. After this nomadic period the club purchased land at 45 West Forty-Second Street to erect a permanent location and raised enough funds to have architect Henry Fernbach design the building. Later, this building was refurbished and had an annex added, both of which were designed by Herts and Tallant, architects of the Brooklyn Academy of Music and Coram Library at Bates College. The growth of the club was supported through dues and the creation of a nomination process to accept new members. To govern the organization, the club held monthly meetings run by elected officers. During the first ten years of existence the group held balls, lectures, and other social events throughout New York City. The tenth anniversary was celebrated on October 18, 1863 with a banquet and ball attended by over one hundred and fifty members. Two years later the club was incorporated as, \\"The Harmonie Social Club of the City of New York\\", with two re-incorporations in 1867 and 1894. The first re-incorporation altered the provisions to allow the club to own property and the building on Forty-Second Street. The latter reincorporation was to change the name to \\"The Harmonie Club.\\" Members, however, continued to use the former name, Gesellschaft Harmonie, until 1893 when the club adopted English as its official language in place of German. The club was so successful, that by 1884 the New York Times reported that \\"many of New-York's leading German citizens are connected\\" with it. The large building erected on West Forty-Second allowed the Harmonie Club to host in-house events, and for the next forty years the club regularly scheduled events such as dances, lectures, concerts, theatrical performances, billiards, cards, and bowling. In 1891, the Admission Committee was created, removing the task of approving and voting on new members from the general monthly meetings. The turn of the century brought several changes to the club. These changes included the first events for non-married members, a declining interest in large social gatherings such as dances, and increasing property taxes along Forty-Second Street. 42nd Street Location In response to these pressures, a decision was made to relocate to a more suitable building. The club solicited donations from its members to build a new clubhouse on property acquired on the Upper East Side. In December 1905, the club moved into new premises at Four East 60th Street, in a building designed by renowned Beaux Arts architect, Stanford White of McKim, Meade & White. Lighting for the building was provided by Edward F. Caldwell & Co. Later alterations, inside and out, were designed by Benjamin Wistar Morris.White, Norval & Willensky, Elliot. AIA Guide to New York City (Fourth Edition). New York:Three Rivers Press, 2000. A banquet to celebrate the opening was attended by over four hundred members. Current Location A Stanford White drawing of the facade In 1914, to meet the changing interests of its members, the Harmonie Club purchased the North Shore Country Club on Long Island. According to an April 1914 President's Report: \\"The trend of time is toward the country club and healthy outdoor activity. With the increasing tendency to spread the weekends in suburban surrounding, with the increased use of the automobile, and with the increased desire for outdoor exercise, especially on the part of the younger generation.\\" After several years of renovation the country club opened for Harmonie Club members only. This arrangement was designed to both serve and increase interest in the parent organization. Over the years, the North Shore Country Club has hosted several tournaments. Although no longer affiliated with the club, North Shore still operates today as a private course. The growth of the Harmonie Club was slowed by the outbreak of World War I and related anti-German sentiment, as well as, the wartime service of current and potential members. The club supported the United States' campaign through hosting events for enlisted men and their families. In addition, fifty of the club's members served in the war effort. Following the war, the club prospered reaching a record high of eight hundred and fifty members in 1929. This number was cut in half by 1934 with the onset of the Great Depression. The Board of Governors began a large scale renovation of the building on Sixtieth Street under the expertise of architect Benjamin Morris in the late 1930s. The new facilities along with a series of changes in the club's bylaws were designed to modernize the organization and attracted a large number of new and young members. With its origins as a Jewish club, for several years it served as the meeting location for the American Jewish Committee, especially in the tumultuous 1930s. The committee took a leading role in resettling refugees from the Nazis and in ensuring their contribution to the Allied war effort. Albert Einstein and other prominent Anti-Nazi figures of the day sponsored events at the club to raise awareness of the Nazis' persecution of the Jews. The growth of the Club was halted in 1941 with the American entry into World War II. The club continued to operate throughout the war and resumed its philanthropic programs from World War I, such as hosting functions for enlisted men. Following the war, the Club's membership returned to pre- Depression numbers. =Recent events= Over the years its political role in the community appeared to have moderated, and it became more of a social center, as well as extending its membership to include non-German Jews and others. In 1987, it was the location of the world's 'most charitable' bridge game, which raised $62,000. Historically known as a Jewish club, the club has indicated a willingness to broaden its membership. Nonetheless, a perceived lack of diversity caused member Michael Bloomberg to resign in 2001, in anticipation of his initial mayoral run. As a New York cultural institution, the Harmonie Club has been host to numerous political and cultural luminaries in recent years, including a visit and address from former U.S. President Bill Clinton in 2007, presentations or panel discussions with Senators Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Representative Charles Rangel, every New York mayor and governor since Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr., and Governor Herbert H. Lehman. In October 2018 the Harmonie Club of NYC named Davina Weinstein the first female general manager in the 166 year history of the club. Ms. Weinstein is also one of the first female general managers in New York City club history overall. Further reading H.

Thousands of people gathered to disrupt the World Trade Organisation conference by preventing delegates from entering the conference venue.Jordan T & Taylor P Hactivism and Cyber War, Rebel with a Cause? Routledge, New York 2004 Simultaneously, an online direct protest was run by The Electrohippies Collective with what is now a familiar aspect of cyber space: a denial-of- service (DOS) action. This tactic blocked the computer network servicing the WTO meeting by flooding it with requests. The Ehippies claimed success for the action, saying 450,000 people participated over 5 days, resulting in the WTO conference network being constantly slowed and periodically brought to a halt. Their claim was disputed by staff of Conxion, the ISP hosting the conference website, who deployed a URL rewriting rule to redirect attack traffic to the attack page itself. It was claimed that this counter-attack \\"crashed\\" the Ehippies' server within seconds, forcing them to move to another ISP. The majority of hits to the Ehippies' site were thus their own attack page attacking itself. Conxion claimed to have logged fewer than 10,000 unique- source IP addresses. The attack page consisted of nine frames, three attacking the San Jose conference server, three against the Virginia server and three against the main WTO server. The Chicago conference server was not attacked and remained entirely unaffected. However, the WTO main website server, hosted by another provider, did not benefit from the rewrite-engine fix and did suffer significantly from the DOS attack.Radcliff D Hack Back 29 May 2000 The Ehippies justified their campaign tactic as enabling tens of thousands of remote computer users to join the Seattle protest action. They pointed out that the action could not have worked without the support of sufficient people‚Äîpurporting to demonstrate that there was significant support for their action. =Against the IMF/WB, 2000= As a follow-up to their WTO action, the Ehippies and volunteers tried to shut down the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank websites by a \\"virtual sit-in\\" in conjunction with 'real world' protests in Washington, D.C. in April 2000. Some 5000 online participants were able to cause only intermittent slowdowns on those sites. =Response to 'anti-terror' laws= The collective was forced to subside temporarily into inaction by the British government's The Terrorism Act 2000 and The Regulation of Investigatory Power Act 2000, perceived as significantly changing the right of British citizens to freely use the internet for political and protest action.

It is the highest point in the city. Etymology Ajusco is a N√°huatl word variously translated as \\"source of waters\\" or \\"watered grove\\", and the Lerma River and Balsas River draw some of their source waters from this area. Also, the flow from all of the remaining strong springs in the area adjacent to the peak are captured to augment Mexico City's water supply. Geology Ajusco is a lava dome complex of Pliocene- Pleistocene age, surrounded by block and ash flow deposits. Ajusco is part of the mountain chain of volcanic origin known as Sierra de Ajusco- Chichinauhtzin, among which Xitle (), Tl√°loc (), Pelado (), Cuautzin () and Chichinautzin () stand out. This range is part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt which crosses central Mexico and contains the country's highest peaks. Ecology Parts of this range account for about half of the area of the Mexican Federal District, the rest of which is occupied by Mexico City. The area is important for conservation of local ecosystems. In its oak, pine and fir forests there are unique endemic species like the teporingo rabbit and the volcano mouse.

Margaret was born at Haddington, East Lothian, the first child of William I of Scotland and his wife Ermengarde de Beaumont. She was an older sister of Alexander II of Scotland. Her father had fought Henry II of England as well as his younger son John of England. As a result, in 1209, William was forced to send Margaret and her younger sister Isabella as hostages; they were imprisoned at Corfe Castle along with Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany, who had been under house arrest to prevent her claim on England. In June 1213, John sent green robes, lambskin-trimmed cloaks, and summer slippers to the three noble ladies.Eleanor of Brittany in captivity The ladies were sometimes allowed to ride out under the strictest guard. On 19 June 1221, Margaret married Hubert de Burgh. At the time of their marriage Hubert was effectively the Regent of the Kingdom of England since Henry III was too young to carry out the duties of King. Henry III finally came of age in 1227 and Hubert retired from his duties as Regent. He was awarded the title of Earl of Kent and remained one of the most influential people at court. They had only one known daughter: *Margaret de Burgh (c. 1222‚Äì1237). Also known as \\"Megotta\\", she married Richard de Clare, 5th Earl of Hertford, but left no issue. Margaret of Scotland's line thus became extinct in 1237. She survived her husband by sixteen years and died in 1259. She was buried at the Church of the Black Friars of London. From her birth to her death was Margaret was arguably either first or second heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Scotland as one of the few living, legitimate descendants of William I.

(), was a French priest, who served as a missionary in China, where he became a martyr. He was canonized in 1996 by Pope John Paul II. Life =Early life= Perboyre was born in 1802 at Le Puech (now in the commune of Montgesty), Lot, France, one of eight children born to Pierre Perboyre and Marie Rigal, who ran a farm. (Five of them would enter either the Vincentian Fathers or the Daughters of Charity.) He led a routine childhood and youth, displaying no particular religious fervor. This changed in 1816, however, after his younger brother, Louis, was accepted into the Vincentian seminary recently founded in Montauban by their uncle, Jacques Perboyre, C.M. John Gabriel was asked by their parents to accompany his brother until he had adapted to his new environment. To his surprise, John Gabriel felt drawn to follow this life himself. When the teachers at the minor seminary saw Perboyre's intelligence and piety, they suggested that he enroll formally in the seminary. He wrote to his father, offering to return to help on the farm should his father wish, but indicating that he felt that he was called to serve as a priest. His parents gave him their blessing and full support in this. =Vincentian priest= Perboyre entered the novitiate of the Congregation at the minor seminary of Montauban in December 1818. On the feast of the Holy Innocents 1820, he made the four promises of the Congregation, hoping to serve in its overseas missions. He was ordained to the priesthood on 23 September 1825, in the chapel of the Daughters of Charity, by Louis Dubourg, S.S., newly installed as the Bishop of Montauban, and on the following day he presided for the first time at Mass. In 1832 he was assigned by the superiors of the Congregation to supervise the novitiate in Paris. Perboyre had been held back from his longing to serve in China by his poor health. His brother Louis, on the other hand was sent to China. Unfortunately he died in the course of the journey there. This prompted John Gabriel to volunteer to replace his brother. He was approved for this, with the hope that the sea voyage would improve his health. =Missionary= Perboyre arrived in Macau in August 1835, where he began the study of the Chinese language. On 21 December 1835, he began his journey to Ho-Nan in China, the mission assigned him, in a junk ship. The journey took him five months, which required months of recovery. He then proceeded to spend the rest of his time of service serving the poverty-stricken people of the region. In January 1838, he was transferred to the mission of Hubei. In September 1839, persecutions against Christians broke out in Hubei, and Perboyre was one of the first victims. In 1839 the viceroy of the province began a persecution and used the local mandarins to obtain the names of priests and catechists in their areas. In September 1839, the Mandarin of Hubei, where there was a Vincentian mission center, sent soldiers to arrest the missionaries. Perboyre was meeting informally with some other priests of the region when the soldiers arrived to seize them. The priests scattered and hid, but one catechist, under torture, gave away where Perboyre was hiding. He was stripped of his garments and clothed with rags, bound, and, over the course of time, was dragged from tribunal to tribunal. At each trial, he was treated inhumanly. Finally, he was taken to Wuchang, and after torture, was condemned to death. The sentence was confirmed by an imperial edict in 1840, and on 11 September of that year, Perboyre was led to death with seven criminals. He was strangled to death on a cross at Wuchang. His body was retrieved and buried in the mission cemetery by a catechist. Veneration After the then-obligatory waiting period of 5 years after death for seeking a person's canonization had expired, a cause for him was introduced to the Holy See. He was beatified by Pope Leo XIII in 1889, and later canonized by Pope John Paul II in 1996 on 2 June. In the meantime, his remains were returned from China to France, where they were entombed for veneration in the chapel of the Vincentian Motherhouse in Paris, Saint Vincent de Paul Chapel.

He was educated at the University of La Sapienza, gaining degrees in both canon and civil law. He was ordained on 23 October 1740. Zelada was appointed titular Archbishop of Petra on 23 December 1766, and cardinal priest in the consistory of 19 April 1773. Appointed by means of a papal brief of Pope Clement XIV, he was the principal negotiator for the Holy See and composer of the brief Dominus ac Redemptor of 8 June 1773, that suppressed the Society of Jesus. On 2 October, the Diario di Roma reported he had been given a Meissen group representing the death of St. Francis Xavier, confiscated from the Jesuits.R√∂ttgen 1970. Already Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals (1783‚Äì84), his career culminated in his appointment by Pope Pius VI as Cardinal Secretary of State, 1789‚Äì1796, in which post he was entrusted with difficult negotiations with the French Revolutionary state, which included his conclusion of peace in 1793.Pastor, 16.3, pp 510ff. With the French occupation of Rome, Cardinal Zelada retired to Tuscany. Following Pius' death, Zelada participated in the Papal conclave of 1800 that elected Pope Pius VII. Librarian of the Holy Roman Church from 15 December 1779 until his death, Cardinal Zelada was not known for his religious fervor.A contemporary satiric verse asserts that Zelada is seen to \\"portar la croce sol per ornamento\\", wear the cross only as an ornament\\". (quoted in Nello). Rather he was a great collector of books, of coins and medals and other works of art, and of scientific machines. He had a telescope installed in his house near Il Ges√π, and transferred it to his residence as Cardinal-Librarian. He installed an observatory at the Collegio Romano. After his death his printed books went to the Vatican Library, while his manuscripts - already sent to Spain for safe keeping - went to the capitular library of Toledo.R√∂ttgen 1970:65, quoting Vian Nello, \\"un piccolo fondo sulla rivoluzione francese\\", Studium\\", (July ‚Äì August 1965:7f). His collection of anatomical models he bequeathed to the Ospedale di Santo Spirito. He is buried in the church of San Martino ai Monti, Rome.

He was a professed member of the Canons Regular of Saint Augustine of Chancelade in P√©rigueux - that order is now extinct. He was also a member of the Compagnie du Saint-Sacrement. He was also acquainted with Vincent de Paul and Francis de Sales. He was declared a Servant of God after Pope Pius VI opened his cause for sainthood on 6 August 1783 and Pope Pius XI declared him to be Venerable on 19 June 1927. Pope John Paul II beatified him on 4 October 1981. Life Alain de Solminihac was born on 25 November 1593 in the Kingdom of France to Jean and Margaret de Solminihac. He wanted to become a member of the Knights of Malta in order to serve God but felt a strong call to the priesthood and to the religious life so joined the Canons Regular of Saint Augustine of Chancelade in 1613 as a postulant. His period of novitiate commenced in 1615 and concluded on 28 July 1618. The completion of his theological studies soon saw him ordained to the priesthood on 22 September 1618. He was made the superior of his convent in 1623. Pope Urban VIII appointed him as the Bishop of Cahors on 22 September 1636 (King Louis XIII approved this after meeting him) and he received his episcopal consecration on 27 September 1637 in the French capital of Paris. The bishop visited each of his 800 parishes at least nine times during the course of his episcopate and he held an episcopal consecration on one occasion. He also prompted adoration to the Eucharist and restored a range of local devotions. He attended the Council of Trent and followed the lead of Charles Borromeo in enforcing its decrees in his diocese. He met Francis de Sales for the first time during Lent in 1619 and the two had more meetings following this; he also became a friend of Vincent de Paul. He died on 31 December 1659. Beatification The beatification process commenced under Pope Pius VI after he was titled as a Servant of God on 6 August 1783 and the confirmation of his heroic virtue allowed for Pope Pius XI to name him as Venerable on 19 June 1927. The process for a miracle attributed to his intercession saw two independent processes run with the informative one spanning from 1769 until 1775. The Congregation for Rites validated the informative miracle process on 12 April 1905 while the Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the apostolic one on 14 April 1978. The medical board approved the miracle on 25 June 1975 while the C.C.S. officials and their consultants also approved it on 10 April 1979; the C.C.S. themselves issued their own approval to it on 29 May 1979 and passed it to Pope John Paul II who granted the final approval needed on 13 July 1979 in which the pope also confirmed the beatification. John Paul II beatified him on 4 October 1981. The miracle involved the cure of Marie Ledoux on 29 June 1661 in France. References Bibliography * P.

House of Fury features a collaboration between Anthony Wong and Michael Wong, reuniting them for the first time since 1998's Beast Cops. Plot Terry Yue Siu-bo, a single father who single-handedly raises his two children, Natalie and Nicky, to young adulthood after his wife's death. Nicky works as a dolphin trainer at Ocean Park and Natalie goes to school with Ella, Nicky's girlfriend. Natalie's boyfriend, Jason, is a musician who does not speak Cantonese very well, and in his first scene, gives Natalie a pet pig. Siu-bo works as a Chinese traditional bonesetter and has kung fu skills, which he has passed on to his children, who display prowess while fighting each other in sibling disputes. Siu-bo tells exaggerated stories to his children and their friends, but they think they don't believe them to be true thus causing a lot of embarrassment to Nicky and Natalie. Rocco, an ex-CIA Agent out for revenge, kidnaps Siu-bo and demands information about a former spy whom Siu-bo knew. Siu-bo refuses to tell him, and Rocco threatens to harm his children if he does not give in. During this time, Uncle Chiu discovers Siu-bo's shop trashed and calls up Nicky to tell him of his father's disappearance. Finding a secret room at the back of his shop, Nicky finds out of his great past as a G4 agent assigned to protect former spies. Seeking more information, Siu-bo is injected with a truth serum by Rocco's men, and in his degraded mental state he reveals that he hid memory cards of his past activity in the lucky charms of his children. Rocco sends agents to Natalie, who is acting in a play, but Nicky manages to get to her and escape with some help from Ella and Jason. As they hide out in Jason's house, Natalie finds out about the memory card in her charm and has Jason try to open it. They then find out that the card needs the other memory card to function, but Nicky in his haste to get to the shop left it in his locker at the park. Nicky and Natalie then attempt to get it during the dead of night, but are intercepted by two of Rocco's minions. After defeating the minions, a phone rings, and they get into direct contact with Rocco, who threatens their father's death if they do not help him in his quest for revenge. He gives them one day to find the agent, and then cuts the conversation. Nicky and Natalie get back to Jason's house and find out that they require voice authentication from their father to access the file. Jason works through the night to create a file that would match Siu-bo's voice. During this time Siu-bo attempts to escape, but is foiled by Rocco's son, who is extremely adept with a bo staff. Jason finishes the file, and is finally able to access the database. They find out that Rocco's target is actually Uncle Chiu, who turns out to be the same agent that left Rocco paralyzed and captured him. Nicky and Natalie try to leave to recover their father and find Uncle Chiu, but Jason traps them in his studio, and reveals that he is Siu- bo's co-agent and does not want them to get hurt. He also reveals that his romantic intentions with Natalie are real, and not just a cover story. Jason makes his way to Uncle Chiu to warn him to escape, and the old Uncle initially accepts, asking for a final moment to spend with his granddaughter. An ambulance creates a distraction from Jason to reveal Uncle Chiu attempting to escape by climbing and running across rooftops. The siblings, initially thinking they were left trapped in Jason's home, find an air vent to escape in, and follow Jason to Uncle Chiu's restaurant. Jason chases Uncle Chiu, but injures his ankle on attempting to jump between buildings and is saved by a fire hose thrown out by Uncle Chiu. Nicky and Natalie catch up to him, and ask him for help in saving their father. He relents, and Jason calls Nicky to throw him his car's keys, so they could get Uncle Chiu to Rocco in time. Nicky and Natalie take a boat to Rocco's lair, and demand to see their father. Rocco reveals him to be trapped in a tank rapidly emptying of air, and rebuffs them without the agent he is looking for. Uncle Chiu shows up, and Rocco calls in his men to kill them. They fight their way through everyone, with Natalie breaking out Siu-bo by applying a kung fu technique he taught her in her youth, Nicky saving Uncle Chiu from a killing blow and defeating Rocco's son. Nicky leaves Rocco unharmed after he makes him fall off his wheelchair, and everyone manages to leave Rocco's lair alive. In the ending scene, Jason comes to Siu-bo's home to apologize to Natalie, which she accepts. Nicky finally gets the courage to have a French kiss with Ella, and Siu-bo and Uncle Chiu play a game of chess, with Chiu's granddaughter watching.

It was released in 1986 by MCA Entertainment. The 87-minute film was recorded from back to back concerts in Miami, Florida on August 16 and 17, 1985, at Miami Marine Stadium and is the first concert video released by Buffett. Miami Vice star Don Johnson introduced Buffett to the crowd. A brief rain shower during the middle of the Friday night show prompted Buffett to retreat to his sailboat (docked by the stage) and caused a majority of the final video release to feature the Saturday night show. After the rain cleared on Friday, the band played Little Feat's \\"Dixie Chicken\\" to demonstrate the equipment still functioned before Buffett returned to the stage. The stadium was originally built for powerboat racing. It used a floating stage in front of the grandstand that allowed additional concertgoers to listen from their boats in the water behind the stage, as seen in video. The video introduction includes extended footage of \\"parrothead\\" fans on boats and in the water with \\"Gypsies in the Palace\\" playing in the background. Buffett returned to Miami Marine Stadium in 1987 for a concert with the Desperadoes Steel Orchestra, but the stadium was ultimately was condemned after Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and remains an abandoned hulk . In 2009, Buffett recorded a short video supporting efforts to restore the stadium. Released on March 1, 1986, Live by the Bay was directed by Jack Cole, produced by Tammara Wells, and recorded and mixed by Elliot Scheiner. The film was released on VHS and LaserDisc. , the video is out of print and has not been released on DVD.

The word \\"keyhole\\" contrasts the large uncertainty of trajectory calculations (between the time of the observations of the asteroid and the first encounter with the planet) with the relatively narrow bundle(s) of critical trajectories. The term was coined by P. W. Chodas in 1999. It gained some public interest when it became clear, in January 2005, that the Asteroid 99942 Apophis would miss the Earth in 2029 but may go through one or another keyhole leading to impacts in 2036 or 2037. Further research has since been done, however, which revealed the probability of Apophis passing through the keyhole was extremely insignificant. Keyholes for the nearer or further future are named by the numbers of orbital periods of the planet and the asteroid, respectively, between the two encounters (for example ‚Äú7:6 resonance keyhole‚Äù). There are even more but smaller secondary keyholes, with trajectories including a less close intermediate encounter (\\"bank shots\\"). Secondary gravitational keyholes are searched for by importance sampling: virtual asteroid trajectories (or rather their ‚Äòinitial‚Äô values at the time of the first encounter) are sampled according to their likelihood given the observations of the asteroid. Very few of these virtual asteroids are virtual impactors. Background Due to observational inaccuracies, inaccuracies in the frame of reference stars, bias in the weighting of major observatories over smaller ones, and largely unknown non-gravitational forces on the asteroid, mainly the Yarkovsky effect, its position at the predicted time of encounter is uncertain in three dimensions. Typically, the region of probable positions is formed like a hair, thin and elongated, because visual observations yield 2-dimensional positions in the sky but no distances. If the region is not too extended, less than about one percent of the orbital radius, it may be represented as a 3-dimensional uncertainty ellipsoid and the orbits (ignoring the interaction) approximated as straight lines. Now imagine a plane comoving with the planet and perpendicular to the incoming velocity of the asteroid (unperturbed by the interaction). This target plane is named b-plane after the collision parameter b, which is the distance of a point in the plane to the planet at its coordinate origin. Depending on a trajectory's position in the b-plane its post-encounter direction and kinetic energy is affected. The orbital energy is directly related to the length of the semi-major axis and also to the orbital period. If the post-encounter orbital period of the asteroid is a fractional multiple of the orbital period of the planet, there will be a close encounter at the same orbital position after the given numbers of orbits. According to Ernst √ñpik's theory of close encounters, the set of points in the b-plane leading to a given resonance ratio forms a circle. Lying on this circle are the planet and two gravitational keyholes, which are images of the planet in the b-plane of the future encounter (or rather of the slightly larger catchment area due to gravitational focusing). The form of the keyholes is a small circle elongated and bent along the circle for the given resonance ratio. The keyhole closest to the planet is smaller than the other, because the variation of deflection becomes steeper with decreasing collision parameter b.  High uncertainty affects calculation  Relevant keyholes are those close to the uncertainty ellipsoid projected onto the b-plane, where it becomes an elongated ellipse. The ellipse shrinks and jitters as new observations of the asteroid are added to the evaluation. If the probable path of the asteroid keeps close to a keyhole, the precise position of the keyhole itself would matter. It varies with the incoming direction and velocity of the asteroid and with the non-gravitational forces acting on it between the two encounters. Thus, ‚Äúa miss is as good as a mile‚Äù does not apply to a keyhole of several hundred meters width. However, changing the path of an asteroid by a mile can be done with a relatively small impulse if the first encounter is still years away. Deflecting the asteroid after the fly-by would need a much stronger impulse. For a rapidly rotating planet such as the Earth, calculation of trajectories passing close to it, less than a dozen radii, should include the oblateness of the planet‚Äîits gravitational field is not spherically symmetric. For even closer trajectories, gravity anomalies may be important. For a large asteroid (or comet) passing close to the Roche limit, its size, which is inferred from its magnitude, affects not only the Roche limit but also the trajectory because the center of gravitational force on the body deviates from its center of mass resulting in a higher-order tidal force shifting the keyhole.

He earned his doctorate from the University of Abo and was instrumental in the operation of the Russian Bible Society for several years eventually being pensioned by Czar Nicholas I. He returned to Edinburgh, where he served as secretary for Scotland of the London Missionary Society. Life Paterson, third child of George Paterson of Duntocher in the parish of Old Kilpatrick, near Glasgow, was born at Duntocher on 26 February 1776, and became a student at the University of Glasgow in 1798. He was attracted by the religious revival which sprang out of the preaching of James Alexander Haldane, and applied for admission into a class formed by the Congregationalists to train young men for the ministry. He was sent to Dundee, and spent the greater part of 1800 there, under the care of W. Innes. Removing to Glasgow, he on 5 July 1803 became the minister of a church which he had formed at Cambuslang, but he relinquished it on 17 June 1804, with the intention of going out as a missionary to India. Accordingly, on 27 August, accompanied by his friend, Ebenezer Henderson, he sailed for Denmark, with the intention of going thence to India; but finding it impossible to carry out this intention, he remained in Northern Europe, and became a zealous and useful missionary there. Gradually his connection with the churches in Edinburgh was dissolved, and he was left to his own resources. He remained in Denmark until after the bombardment of Copenhagen in 1807, when he removed and settled in Stockholm. Here during the next five years he continued his labours among the natives of Scandinavia. The British and Foreign Bible Society afforded him aid in carrying out his plans (though he was at no time the society's salaried agent). After having helped to Finnish Lutheran Archbishop Jacob Tengstrom to establish the Finnish Bible Society in 1812, he removed to St. Petersburg, and on 1 November 1817 he received the degree of doctor of theology from the University of √Öbo in Finland. In 1822 he withdrew from the British and Foreign Bible Society, and Prince Galitzin and other friends in St. Petersburg requested him to conduct the affairs of the Russian Bible Society. Emperor Alexander I of Russia granted him an annual salary of six thousand roubles. On the death of the emperor the party in power raised objections to the circulation of the scriptures. Ultimately, in 1825, the Emperor Nicholas issued ukases suspending the operations of the Bible Society, and placing the society under the control of the Greek church. Thereupon Paterson left Russia; but the emperor treated him with great kindness, and continued to him his pension for life. During his residence in Northern Europe he was connected with the work of translating and printing portions of the scriptures into Finnish, Georgian, Icelandic, Lapponese, Lettish, Moldavian, Russ, Samogitian, and Swedish. On returning home he settled in Edinburgh, and served for many years as secretary for Scotland of the London Missionary Society, also acting as chairman of the committee of the Congregational Union. In Edinburgh he lived at 11 Salisbury Place in the South Side.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1845 In 1850 he removed to Dundee, where he occasionally preached. Family The grave of John Paterson, Western Cemetery, Dundee He married, first, at Stockholm, on 31 August 1809, Katrine Margarete Hollinder, who died 7 March 1813, leaving two children, one of whom, Dr. George, born 18 March 1811, became congregational minister at Tiverton. Paterson married, secondly, on 19 April 1817, Jane, daughter of Admiral Samuel Greig, of the Russian navy; she was born in Russia on 26 October 1783, and, from her knowledge of Russian dialects, was of much help to her husband in his work at St. Petersburg. She died on 19 January 1820, leaving a daughter, who became the wife of Edward Baxter of Kincaldrum. He died during a visit to his daughter at Kincaldrum, Forfarshire, on 6 July 1855. He is buried in the Western Cemetery, Dundee. The grave lies against the first upper terrace, towards its east end. Publications Paterson was the author of: * ‚ÄòA Letter to H. H.

Carried out between 1867 and 1871, it is one of the defining events in the history of Brussels. The Senne/Zenne (French/Dutch) was historically the main waterway of Brussels, but it became more polluted and less navigable as the city grew. By the second half of the 19th century, it had become a serious health hazard and was filled with pollution, garbage and decaying organic matter. It flooded frequently, inundating the lower town and the working class neighbourhoods which surrounded it. Numerous proposals were made to remedy this problem, and in 1865, the then-mayor of the City of Brussels, Jules Anspach (1829‚Äì1879), selected a design by architect L√©on Suys to cover the river and build a series of grand boulevards and public buildings. The project faced fierce opposition and controversy, mostly due to its cost and the need for expropriation and demolition of working-class neighbourhoods. The construction was contracted to a British company, but control was returned to the government following an embezzlement scandal. This delayed the project, but it was still completed in 1871. Its completion allowed the construction of the modern buildings and boulevards which are central to downtown Brussels today. In the 1930s, plans were made to cover the Senne along its entire course within the greater Brussels area, which had grown significantly since the covering of the 19th century. By 1955 the course of the Senne was changed to the downtown's peripheral boulevards. In 1976, the disused tunnels were converted into the North‚ÄìSouth Axis of Brussels' underground tram system, the premetro. Actual purification of the waste water from the Brussels-Capital Region was not completed until March 2007, when two treatment stations were built, thus finally cleansing the Senne after centuries of problems. The Senne in Brussels Map of Brussels in 1837; north is roughly to the right At the beginning of the 19th century, Brussels was still in many ways a medieval city. The royal quarter in the upper town, inhabited mainly by the nobility and the richer members of the bourgeoisie, was upscale and modern. The rest of the city, however, in particular the lower town, located in the western half of the Pentagon, was densely populated and industrial, characterised by an illogical street layout, back alleys, narrow streets, and numerous dead ends. The Senne river split into two branches at Anderlecht, penetrating the Pentagon, the former site of the second city walls, in two places. The main and more southern arm entered through the Greater Sluice Gate, near today's Brussels-South railway station. The smaller northerly arm entered through the Lesser Sluice Gate, near today's Ninove Gate. The courses of the two traced a meandering path through the city centre, forming several islands, the largest of which was known as Saint Gaugericus Island. The two branches met up on the north side of Saint Gaugericus Island, exiting the Pentagon one block east of Antwerp Gate. A man-made arm, called the \\"Lesser Senne\\" (, ) continued on the borders of the Pentagon in the former moat, outside the sluice gates. It followed the Charleroi Canal before rejoining the main part of the Senne north of the city. Many unsanitary and unsafe wooden add-ons projected over the river in the lower town. The Senne had long since lost its usefulness as a navigable waterway, being replaced by canals, including the Charleroi Canal. The Senne had always been a river with an inconsistent flow, often overflowing its banks. In times of heavy rainfall, even the sluice gates were unable to regulate the flow of the river which was often swollen by numerous creeks flowing down from higher ground. Making matters worse, within the city, the river's bed was narrowed by encroaching construction due to demographic pressure. The supports of numerous unregulated bridges impeded water flow and caused water levels to rise even further, exacerbated by a riverbed of accumulated waste. During dry periods, however, much of the Senne's water was diverted for the needs of the populace of the city, as well as to maintain the water level in the Charleroi Canal. This left a flow too feeble to evacuate the filthy water, leaving the sewage, garbage, detritus and industrial waste that had been dumped into the river to accumulate in the stagnant water. The Senne, which a witness in 1853 described as \\"the most nauseous little river in the world\\", had become an open-air sewer spreading pestilential odours throughout the city. Early in the second half of the 19th century, Brussels saw numerous dry periods, floods and a cholera epidemic, caused as much by the river itself as by the poverty and the lack of hygiene and potable water in the lower city. This forced the governments of the Province of Brabant and the City of Brussels to act. Attempts at purification The 1837 course of the Senne superimposed on the modern city The first studies and propositions to clean up the river date back to 1859, and during the following years, many different commissions of engineers were assigned to examine possible solutions. Dozens of different ideas were submitted, many of which were completely unfeasible. Several of them proposed diverting large amounts of cleaner water from other rivers upstream to dilute the Senne, while greatly improving the drainage system in the city. Other proposals involved diverting the main course of the Senne completely to the Lesser Senne, which would then be enlarged and thus more useful for boat traffic and mills. Others considered any sort of sanitisation impossible, and proposed covering the Senne without greatly changing its course. Among these was a proposal to double the size of the underground drainage tunnels, creating space for a subterranean railroad tunnel. The idea was ahead of its time, but would be implemented a century later with the North‚ÄìSouth connection. The municipal council chose the proposal by architect L√©on Suys, submitted in 1865, which had the backing of then-mayor of the City of Brussels, Jules Anspach (1829‚Äì1879). The plan involved suppressing the secondary arm of the Senne by closing the Lesser Sluice Gate. The main branch would be channeled into tunnels, to be placed directly beneath a long, straight boulevard, stretching from the Greater Sluice Gate to the Temple of the Augustinians (now De Brouck√®re Square) before splitting into two. One branch was to head towards Brussels-North railway station and present day Charles Rogier Square, the other towards Antwerp Gate, thus forming a long, narrow \\"Y\\" shape.Map of Suys' Proposal. City Archives of Brussels: P.P. 1.169 Anspach's backing of Suys' proposal was a calculated decision, as he had radical plans to transform the city. Anspach saw the proposal as an unexpected boon, as it allowed him to accomplish several of his goals at once. It had long been his ambition to transform the impoverished lower city into a centre of business and commerce, suitable for a modern capital (Belgium had declared its independence in 1830, with Brussels its capital). He wanted to attract the middle class, most of whom had left the dingy downtown for the cleaner suburbs, including the Leopold Quarter (now often called the European Quarter) and Avenue Louise/Louizalaan, causing a large loss in tax revenue for the city. The elimination of the numerous alleys and dead-ends in the lower town in favour of a large, straight, wide, open-air boulevard, linking the two rapidly growing train stations, seemed both a necessity and an opportunity to beautify the city and improve both traffic circulation and hygiene. Controversy and opposition Jules Anspach and the Senne, editorial cartoon from 1868 The Belgian Parliament had recently passed a law allowing the expropriation of privately owned land by the government when the land was to be used for the \\"greater good.\\" This could be done even if the project was still speculative in nature, and allowed for more land to be taken beyond what was strictly necessary for a project. The city expropriated large swathes of the lower town, counting on reselling the land for a profit, which, after the project was complete, would be on a grandiose modern boulevard in an upper-class neighbourhood. The selling of land after the completion of the project was seen as a way of financing the project itself. That the poorer residents of the lower town were forced away into other already overcrowded districts or into the surrounding suburbs did not trouble the upper classes very much, as the displaced residents did not pay taxes or have the right to vote. Even after Suys' proposal was officially adopted, Anspach faced strong opposition to the project. This opposition came first from engineers who felt that the covering was incompatible with Brussels's geology, would accumulate potentially dangerous gases and would not be able to handle enough water to prevent floods. Others opposed to the project complained about the high taxes resulting from its high cost, poor compensation for seized property and the lack of public input into the project. The press accused Anspach of being responsible for demolishing Brussels' old town, and published numerous caricatures mocking him. A liberal, Anspach feared the weakness and rigidity of the government and therefore gave the work of covering the river to a private British company, the Belgian Public Works Company (the English name was used), which was created for the task. However, partway through construction, it was forced to relinquish control to the city of Brussels after an embezzlement scandal in which a company director allegedly attempted to steal 2.5 million francs from the company. Anspach only barely kept his office in the 1869 by-elections. Construction The beginning of construction in 1867 Excluding the important sewers built upriver and downriver in the adjacent suburbs, the covered section itself was to be in length. Constructed from bricks, the covering was to consist of two parallel tunnels, and a set of two lateral drainage pipes, each taking in waste water from its respective side of the street. The contract was signed on 15 June 1866, and the expropriation of the first 1,100 houses was completed in a few months. The work began on 13 February 1867. There were several technical difficulties that delayed the covering, many of which were due to the geology of Brussels, though they were not as bad as some engineers had forecast. The embezzlement scandal also caused a significant delay in construction, largely due to the change in control. The project was completed in 1871, with the municipal council ceremonially opening the reconstructed sluice gates on 30 November. The new central boulevards The series of boulevards created by the project‚ÄîHainaut Boulevard (now Maurice Lemonnier Boulevard), Central Boulevard (now Anspach Boulevard), North Boulevard (now Adolphe Max Boulevard), and Senne Boulevard (now √âmile Jacqmain Boulevard)‚Äîwere progressively opened to traffic from 1871 to 1873. The House of Cats by Henri Beyaert, which won first prize in the 1876 contest The opening of these new routes offered a more efficient way to get into the lower town than the cramped streets of /, / and Rue Neuve/Nieuwstraat and helped revitalise the lower quarters of the town. In order to accomplish this revitalisation and attract investment, public buildings were constructed as part of L√©on Suys' project, including the Brussels Stock Exchange. The vast Central Halls (, ), a good example of metallic architecture, replaced unhygienic open-air markets, though it was torn down in 1958. The monumental fountain, which was to break the monotony of the boulevards at Fontainas Square, was abandoned for budgetary reasons. The construction of private buildings on the boulevards and surrounding areas took place later. The middle class continued to prefer living in new suburbs rather than the cramped areas of the city centre. The high prices of the land (expected to finance part of the construction costs) and the high rents were not within the means of the lower classes. Life in apartments was no longer desirable for residents of Brussels, who preferred to live in single family homes. The buildings constructed by private citizens had difficulty finding buyers. To give builders an incentive to create elaborate and appealing facades on their works, an architecture competition was arranged in which twenty buildings built before 1 January 1876 would win prizes. The first prize of 20,000 francs was awarded to Henri Beyaert who designed the or (loosely, \\"House of Cats\\") on North Boulevard. Nonetheless, it took another 20 years, until 1895, for buildings to solidly line the boulevards. The Temple of the Augustinians, built at the beginning of the 17th century in the Baroque style after designs by Jacob Franquart, was the only remaining part of a convent destroyed in 1796 by French revolutionaries. After having been used as a Protestant church from 1815 to 1830, it subsequently saw use as a concert hall, a commercial exchange, and a post office. At the centre of De Brouck√®re Square, the church's facade was intended by L√©on Suys to be one of the focal points of the new boulevards. The work to cover the river, which nearly surrounded the church, preserved the integrity of the building at great trouble and expense, but the church was finally demolished in 1893, its style no longer popular with the people and its presence unsuitable for the area. The church was replaced by a fountain dedicated to the memory of Jules Anspach. Its facade, however, was preserved, being disassembled and moved to serve as the facade for the Church of the Holy Trinity in the municipality of Ixelles. Diversion and treatment The Senne leaving its northern treatment plant Although the original covering of the Senne resolved sanitary problems and flooding in Brussels‚Äô old city, this was not the case in peripheral areas. The Senne was still very polluted, despite work done to the sewers and spillways in the canal. The drainage into the canal was not able to completely stop the floods that regularly affected certain outer areas of the city. In 1930, a group was created whose objective was to channel the Senne into tunnels for nearly its entire course through the Brussels metropolitan area. This was done in order to expand the benefits that the covering achieved in the old city. In the centre, the course of the river was to be changed (using a diversion) from the central boulevards to the peripheral boulevards of the small ring. The project, delayed by war and the work being done on the North‚ÄìSouth connection, was only finished in 1955. The disused channels of the central boulevards later facilitated the construction of the north-south line of the premetro, which opened in 1976. The conversion of the existing tunnels to metro tunnels ensured that there was minimal disruption on the surface. Some of the former pipes also served as storm drains. The Anspach Fountain was reinstalled in May 1981 in a basin that occupies the space between the / and the / in the / neighbourhood. Actual purification of the waste water from the Brussels- Capital Region was not completed until the 21st century, when two purification stations were built. The south station treats refuse water from 360,000 inhabitants, which is about one third of the polluted water, and lies on the border of Anderlecht and Forest. The north station, completed in March 2007, is located near the border of the Brussels-Capital Region, between the Senne and the Charleroi-Willebroek Canal, near Buda Bridge. A portion of the cost was footed by the Flemish Government, as 7 of the adjacent municipalities lie within the Flemish Region. This station is capable of treating the water of 1,100,000 inhabitants and should finally be capable of fully purifying the Senne, which had long caused much of the pollution of the Scheldt river.

C. Burnand, Oliver's greatest success Martha Cranmer Oliver (1834 ‚Äì 20 December 1880), also known as Pattie Oliver or M. Oliver, was an English actress and theatre manager. Beginning as a child actor near her home in Salisbury, Oliver was performing in London by age 13. She played in major theatre companies in the West End, including those of Madame Vestris and J. B. Buckstone. She was the leading comic actress at the Strand Theatre for several seasons in the late 1850s. She also played Mary Meredith in the hit play Our American Cousin at the Haymarket Theatre, among other engagements. In March 1866, Oliver became manager of the New Royalty Theatre, often taking leading roles. In November 1866, she produced F. C. Burnand's burlesque on Black-eyed Susan. The piece was an enormous hit, playing for nearly 500 nights at the theatre, with Oliver starring in the title role. She was also known for helping members of her profession. She gave up management in 1870, acting in New York for a time with Lydia Thompson's troupe, but soon retired from the stage. Early life and career Oliver was born at Salisbury, the daughter of Ann Oliver and John Cranmer Penson, an actor manager in Salisbury. Her sister was Frances Cranmer Oliver who married the actor Frederick Hastings Bullen. She first appeared on stage in Salisbury when only six years old. Here and at Southampton her performances of children's parts attracted attention, until in 1847 she made her London d√©but at the Marylebone Theatre.Obituary, The Era, 1 January 1881, p. 8 Her early success gained her an engagement with Madame Vestris at the Lyceum Theatre, London, which lasted from 1849 to 1855. In 1855 she went to Drury Lane, where she soon played Matilda in Married for Money, and, in 1856, Celia in As You Like It. In the same year, her performance of Helen in the Hunchback won such praise from the critics that J. B. Buckstone offered her an engagement at the Haymarket Theatre. There she was seen in Francis Talfourd's burlesque of Atalanta in 1857. Accepting an offer from Miss Swanborough, she became the leading actress in comedy and burlesque at the Strand Theatre for several seasons. in 1858 she acted Amy Robsart in the burlesque of Ye Queen, ye Earl, and ye Maiden; in 1859 she was Pauline in H. J. Byron's burlesque, the Lady of Lyons and Lisetta in Talfourd's burlesque Tell and the Strike of the Cantons; and in 1860, she played the Prince in Byron's burlesque of Cinderella. At the Haymarket, in 1861, she was Mary Meredith in Our American Cousin, on Edward Askew Sothern's first appearance as Lord Dundreary in London. In 1863 she was at the Princess's Theatre, where she took the title r√¥le in Byron's burlesque, Beautiful Haidee. Royalty Theatre and later years On 31 March 1866, she became manager of the New Royalty Theatre and opened with a revival of The Ticket-of-Leave Man, and Robert Reece's burlesque, Ulf the Minstrel. In a clever and successful piece by H. T. Craven, entitled Meg's Diversion, later that year, she acted the title part, the author played Jasper Pidgeon, and F. Dewar played Roland. On 29 November 1866 she put on the stage F. C. Burnand's burlesque, The Latest Edition of Black-eyed Susan, or, the Little Bill that was taken up. The piece, although it failed to please the critics, had an unprecedented run, and on its performance at the Royalty on 23 September 1868, it was said that Miss Oliver had repeated the song Pretty See-usan, don't say no, no less than 1775 times. During the run of this burlesque she produced as a first piece Andrew Halliday's drama, Daddy Gray, February 1868, and, later that year, a serio-comic drama by the same author, entitled The Loving Cup. Among other pieces, W. S. Gilbert's one-act farce, Highly Improbable played in 1867, and his burlesque, The Merry Zingara, played in 1869. The last night of Miss Oliver's lesseeship was 30 April 1870, when a revival of Black-eyed Susan was given for the 490th time. The Era reported that, soon thereafter, Oliver was in New York with Lydia Thompson's troupe, along with Marie Wilton.The Era, 5 June 1870, p. 6 After this period, however, she was seldom seen on the stage. She was a very pleasing actress and singer, and a general favourite with the public. The Era described the \\"refined vivacity and sparkling brightness\\" of her portrayals, her kindness, and her popularity among members of the theatrical profession. She generously advised young, and supported aged and unfortunate, actors. Oliver married, by license at the registry office, Marylebone, on 26 December 1876, William Charles Phillips, auctioneer, aged 31, son of William Phillips, auctioneer, of Bond Street, London. Death Oliver died of cancer at St. John's Wood, London, in 1880, aged 46.

General A cleared cheque from 1877 The Bank was founded in 1839, with an initial capital of ¬£656,250 (about ¬£46m at 2005 prices). It aimed to cater particularly for small investors, with its branches opening in the evenings to receive deposits; its name is said to have been designed to allude to that of the City Bank of New York. The principal office was established in Virginia Street, Glasgow in 1842, and moved to Glassford Street in 1851. During a banking crisis in 1857 the City of Glasgow Bank had to suspend operation but was then able to reopen and continue trading. For a long time before closure dividends were paid at 9%-12%. The collapse On discovery of a ¬£7,000 deficit (= ¬£¬Ω million at 2005 prices) the Bank's operations were suspended in November and December 1877, until by agreement with the other Scottish banks the New York agency was closed. All seemed well, and in June 1878 the bank announced that there were now 133 branches and deposits of ¬£8m (= ¬£600 million at 2005 prices), and declared a 12% dividend. On 2 October, however, the directors announced the bank's closure. An examination after the closure showed net liabilities of over ¬£6m (= ¬£500 million at 2005 prices), together with extensive loans on poor security, and speculative investments in Australasian farming, mining stocks and American railway shares. In addition, false reports of gold holdings were made to the authorities, balance sheets and profit and loss statements falsified, and the share price held up by secret purchases of the Bank's own stock. So successful was the deception that on the Bank's last business day its ¬£100 shares were selling at ¬£236. The directors were arrested and tried at the High Court in Edinburgh in January 1879. All were found guilty and sentenced to terms of imprisonment of between eight and eighteen months. Scores of Glasgow businesses failed as a result of the bankruptcy and shareholders were called to make good the bank's losses. The case of one shareholder who sought to mitigate the consequence by arguing that he had become a shareholder through the fraud of the bank's agents was appealed unsuccessfully to the House of Lords (\\"Houldsworth's case\\", 1880, 7 R. (H.L.) 53). Wider effects of the collapse have been seen in the growth of limited liability and a temporary banking liquidity problem, and a longer-term reduced trend in bank deposits across the UK. The legalities of the collapse and liquidation were overseen by Alexander Bennett McGrigor.http://www.theglasgowstory.com/image/?inum=TGSA00218 Archives The Bank's archives are now held by the University of Glasgowhttps://www.nytimes.com/1878/10/04/archives/recent-heavy-failures-the- breaking-of-the-city-of-glasgow-bank-its.html Scotland‚Äôs ghost of banking meltdown pastwww.sundayherald.com, retrieved 2008-12-23 In literature The Bank's collapse was vividly represented in the 1948 trilogy The Wax Fruit by Guy McCrone (dramatised by BBC Radio 4 in 2010).

His father, George Osborn (1764‚Äì1836), was a window draper in Rochester, a class-leader among the Wesleyan Methodists for twenty-one years, and a steward of the Rochester circuit.Wesleyan Methodist Magazine, October 1839, pp. 785‚Äì803 George was educated at Dr. Hulett's school at Brompton, and, entering the Wesleyan ministry in 1828, was in the following year appointed to the Brighton circuit, where he laboured successfully for two years. He was conspicuous as a debater very early in life, and rose rapidly in the estimation of his co-religionists. London in 1836‚Äì42 and 1851‚Äì68, Manchester in 1842‚Äì5 and 1848‚Äì51, and Liverpool in 1845‚Äì48 had the benefit of his ministerial services. Although an enthusiastic Methodist, he was catholic in his sentiments, was friendly with the ministers of all evangelical denominations, and in 1845 was one of the founders of the evangelical alliance. In 1851 he was appointed one of the Wesleyan foreign missionary secretaries, and retained that office for seventeen years. The jubilee of the foreign missions took place in 1863. In the same year Osborn was elected president of the conference, and rendered great service to the missions by his advocacy of their claims in the large towns in England. On the retirement of the Rev. Thomas Jackson in 1868, he was elected professor of divinity at Richmond College, and continued to reside there till 1885. Richmond Cemetery He was an able expository preacher, and was one of the most noted orators of his church. Originally he was strongly opposed to the admission of lay representatives to the conference, but when the matter had been carried against him, he at once acquiesced in the decision. In 1881 he was for the second time elected to the chair of the conference. From 1885 he was a supernumerary minister, and died at 24 Cambrian Road, Richmond, Surrey, on 19 April 1891. He was buried in Richmond Cemetery. Works In 1868 Osborn brought out The Poetical Works of J. and C. Wesley, collected and arranged, an edition in thirteen volumes. His second major work was Outlines of Wesleyan Bibliography; or a Record of Methodist Literature from the beginning, 1869. He also printed a sermons and addresses, and furnished prefaces to many books. Family Rev Osborn had 7 daughters with his wife Elizabeth and 4 of them would go on to marry Wesleyan ministers. Most notable was his daughter Katherine who married Rev. Edward Strutt of Mansfield Woodhouse.

The album was Jimmy's first album recorded at his new studio in Key West, Florida called Shrimpboat Sound.http://www.margaritaville.com/about-jimmy The LP continues Buffett's use of a wide variety of musical instruments than was typical for Buffett's earlier works, notably horns and percussion. Buffett shaved off his trademark mustache for the album. Songs All but two of the album's songs were written or co-written by Buffett. The other two songs are cover songs: \\"Great Heart\\" originally by South African Johnny Clegg and Savuka and \\"L'Air de la Louisiane\\" by Jesse Winchester, one of several Buffett covers of Winchester songs recorded throughout his career. \\"L'Air de la Louisiane\\" An admitted francophile, Buffett has sung several songs in French.

The village lies on Combwich Reach as the River Parrett flows to the sea and was the site of an ancient ferry crossing. In the Domesday book it was known as Comiz which means 'The settlement at the short, broad, open valley' (from Old English cumb). This is clearly a reference to the valley of exactly this topographical description, immediately to the south of the village, and through which the South Moor Brook flows westwards into the River Parrett. One derivation of -wich is thought to be from Latin 'vicus', and there are archaeological indications that there was a settlement at Combwich in the Romano-British period, based around a ferry across the Parrett at this point. The exact meaning of the second element here is, though, uncertain at present, as Old English -wic can have a variety of meanings attributed to it It served as a port for the export of local produce and the import of timber from the 15th century. It also served the local brick and coal yard until the creek silted up in the 1930s. Brick and tile making was first recorded in the village in 1842. As of 2019, Combwich wharf is being used for the delivery of large equipment for the building of Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. The Steart Peninsula has flooded many times during the last millennium. The most severe recent floods occurred in 1981. By 1997, a combination of coastal erosion, sea level rise and wave action had made some of the defences distinctly fragile and at risk from failure.

Biography =Early career= Parry, the only son of Welsh musician John Parry (known as Bardd Alaw), was born in London and, at an early age, was taught by his father to sing and to play the harp and the piano. He also studied the harp under Robert Bochsa. As Master Parry, in May 1825, he appeared as a performer on the harp. As a baritone vocalist he made his d√©but on 7 May 1830 at the Hanover Square Rooms, in London, on the occasion of Franz Cramer's concert, when he sang Handel's Arm, arm, ye brave! with much success. Humorous manual written and illustrated by Parry Parry was also an illustrator and artist.Profile of Parry After receiving lessons from Sir George Smart in sacred and classical music, he was in demand as a singer at the Antient and Philharmonic concerts, and also at musical festivals in town and country. For him Sigismund Neukomm composed Napoleon's Midnight Review, and several other songs, but his best efforts were in simple ballads. In 1833 he visited Italy, and received instruction from Luigi Lablache at Naples, where he resided some time. At Posilippo he gave a concert in a theatre belonging to impresario Domenico Barbaja, the second part of which comprised a burlesque on Othello, Lablache taking the part of Brabantio; Calvarola, the Liston of Naples, playing the Moor; and Parry as Desdemona, dressed √† la Madame Vestris, and singing Cherry Ripe. He also appeared before the king and queen of the Two Sicilies, and gave imitations of Lablache, Rubini, and Malibran in a mock Italian trio. Portrait of Parry, c. 1840 He returned to England in 1834, after perfecting his command of the Italian language. On 28 May 1835 he performed in a state room at St James's Palace for King William IV, Queen Adelaide and other members of the royal family. He accompanied himself on the harp in Lord Burghersh's air \\"Bendermeer's Stream\\" and sang a duet with Adelaide Kemble.\\"Mirror of Fashion (from the Court Circular)\\", The Morning Chronicle, 30 May 1835, p. 3, via British Newspaper Archive He married, on 30 June 1835, Anne Combe, the daughter of Henry Combe, a surgeon. They had a daughter, Maria. In July 1836 he gave his first benefit concert at the Hanover Square Rooms, when Malibran sang for him, and he joined her in Mazzinghi's duet When a little farm we keep. Persuaded to try the stage, he came out at the St. James's Theatre, just then built by his father's old friend, John Braham, on 29 September 1836, in a burletta called The Sham Prince, written and composed by his father. He was well received, and on 6 December in the same year he appeared in John Poole's Delicate Attentions, and in a burletta, The Village Coquettes, written by Charles Dickens, with music by John Hullah. Subsequently he was for a brief season at the Olympic Theatre. By 1839, Parry was becoming known as a comic singer, and in 1840 he composed a comic opera called Wanted, a Governess. =Concert room and German Reed entertainments= In 1842 he forsook the stage for the concert-room, and was singing, with Anna Thillon and Josef Staudigl, in pieces written expressly for him by Albert Smith.Athen√¶um, 10 June 1843, p. 556 Parry afterwards accompanied Camillo Sivori, Franz Liszt, Sigismund Thalberg, and others in a concert tour through the United Kingdom, and his powers as a pianist and his originality as a buffo vocalist were widely recognised. In 1849 Albert Smith wrote an entertainment entitled Notes Vocal and Instrumental, which Parry produced on 25 June 1850 at the Store Street Music Hall, Bedford Square, London, and illustrated with large water-colour paintings executed by himself. In it he indulged in monologue, sang in different voices, played the piano, and made rapid changes of his dress. The entertainment proved more acceptable to the audience than any single-handed performance since the time of Charles Mathews the elder. He was afterwards seen at Crosby Hall, Bishopsgate Street, at Willis's Rooms, King Street, St. James's, and in the provinces. On 17 August 1852 he brought out a new solo entertainment at Store Street, called The Portfolio for Children of all Ages,Sunday Times, 23 May 1852, p. 3 which he continued with much success until August 1853.Athen√¶um, 13 August 1853, p. 970 The strain of this engagement, however, proved excessive, and for a time he suffered from mental derangement. When somewhat recovered, he became organist at St. Jude's Church, Southsea, and gave lessons in singing. On 4 June 1860, he joined Thomas German Reed and his wife at the Gallery of Illustration, Regent Street, London. Here he performed for nearly nine years, presenting a series of droll impersonations and musical monologues that inspired other comedians, including George Grossmith. He built comic sketches with musical illustrations around his own comic songs. He wrote these entertainments, composed his own music, and played his own accompaniments. =Retirement= On 15 July 1869 a complimentary benefit was given him by a distinguished party of amateurs at the Lyceum Theatre, and on 7 February 1877 he took a farewell benefit at the Gaiety Theatre, which realised ¬£1,300. His later years were embittered by the loss in 1877, through the defalcations of his solicitor, of the greater part of his forty years' savings. He died at the residence of his daughter, Pembroke Lodge, East Molesey, Surrey, at the age of 69, and was buried in East Molesey cemetery. A miniature portrait of Parry by Maclise is in the possession of Horace N. Pym, Esq. Works Parry watercolour, 1835Parry was the composer of numerous songs and ballads, all of which he sang in his own entertainments. The following were printed: Wanted, a Governess (1840), Fair Daphne (1840), Anticipations of Switzerland (1842), The Accomplished Young Lady (1843), My d√©jeuner √† la Fourchette (1844), The Polka explained (1844), Fayre Rosamond (1844), Matrimony (1845), Young England (1845), Miss Harriet and her Governess (1847), The Flying Dutchman (1848), Coralie (1853), Charming Chloe Cole (1854), Oh, send me not away from home (1854), Little Mary of the Dee (1855), In lonely bow'r bemoans the turtle dove (1855), The Tyrolese Fortune-teller (1867), Bridal Bells (1868), Cupid's Flight (1868), Don't be too particular (1868), Take a bumper and try (1874), and The Musical Wife (1878). Duets: Fond Memory (1855), A B C (1863), Tell me, gentle stranger (1863), We are two roving minstrels (1864), and Flow, gentle Deva (1872). He also wrote the glees, Come, fairies, trip it on the grass (prior to 1851) and Oh! it is that her lov'd one's away (1853), and Parables set to Music, three numbers (1859), besides much music for the piano, including many polkas. The Melodists' Club awarded to Parry prizes for the following songs: The Inchcape Bell, The Flying Dutchman, A Heart to let, Sweet Mary mine, The Gipsy's Tambourine Song, Nant Gwynnant, You know, Constancy, Fair Daphne, and The Days of Yore. Some of his songs were arranged as quadrilles by L. Negri in 1842, and L. G. Jullien's Buffa Quadrilles in 1844 were also composed from the tunes of his vocal melodies.

Located in the southern part of the city near the industrial area, the barracks had numerous facilities. The barracks included a firing range for personal weapons qualification, an Urban warfare training site, vehicle maintenance facilities and various recreation facilities. After World War II the barracks were named after First Lieutenant Bernard J. Ray, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Hurtgen Forest. Ray sacrificed himself to destroy a wire obstacle that was blocking his unit's path. The base was closed in August 2007. History = Before 1945 = Friedberg's history as a garrison town dates back to 1645 when a company was formed there to guard the castle. The barracks was originally built in 1900, known as Wartturm Kaserne, and used during World War I and World War II. Early in 1913 the construction of the kaserne started and by October of the same year the 2nd Battalion of the Hessian 168th Infantry Regiment were stationed there. In the fall of 1914 the entire kaserne was completed. During World War I the kaserne was used to confine Russian, French and British officers. After the war the police took possession of the kaserne until 1933 when Austrian sympathizers of the Nazi regime lived there. At the request of city officials, soldiers were stationed at the kaserne in 1938; specifically, the Wehrmacht's 3rd Battalion of the 36th Infantry Regiment. Additional buildings were constructed on the kaserne to make room for more soldiers. Most of these soldiers were eventually deployed to Eastern Front. = After World War II = An aerial view of the barracks in 1950 After 1945 various American units were stationed at Ray Barracks, most recently 3rd Armored Division and 1st Armored Division components. The first American units occupied the kaserne in 1945. There were both infantry and armored units housed at the kaserne. In 1948 the kaserne was occupied by units later to be designated the 16th Infantry Regiment of the 1st Infantry Division. One of the infantry units was the Headquarters Battalion of the 8th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division. The 4th Division Headquarters were in Frankfurt. Various other commands also used the barracks until Combat Command C of the 3rd Armored Division moved in about 15 April 1956. The barracks were named in honor of First Lieutenant Bernard J. Ray, Company F, 8th Infantry Regiment, who was awarded the Medal of Honor after his death. Elvis Presley-Monument at former Ray Barracks, 2017After being drafted in 1958 Elvis Presley joined the Scout Platoon of the 3rd Armored Division's 1st Medium Tank Battalion, 32nd Armor who were stationed at Ray Barracks. He choose to not receive any special treatment and was respected for not joining Special Services, which would have allowed him to avoid certain duties and maintain his public profile. He did not live on base at Ray Barracks, but was able to live in the nearby resort city of Bad Nauheim. Presley's battalion, redesignated the 4th Battalion, 67th Armor, nicknamed the \\"Bandits,\\" would be later commanded back-to-back by West Point classmates and future Army Generals Albert Bryant, Jr. and Martin Dempsey (later Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff), who maintained their office above the \\"Elvis Aaron Presley Mess Hall,\\" partially funded by Presley. Notably, former U.S. Secretary of State and retired General Colin Powell began his Army career as a Second Lieutenant in 1958 at Ray Barracks in the 3rd Armored Division. The 3rd Armored Division used Ray Barracks until its retirement of colors in 1996 at which time the 1st Armored Division (Forward) occupied the installation until 2007 when the forces stationed there were returned to the United States. At the time of the installation closing in 2007 (along with nearby Giessen Depot) both bases were the home of the 1st Brigade Combat Team \\"Ready First\\", 1st Armored Division which had participated in 2 deployments to Iraq(03-04, 06-07) in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The closing ceremony for United States Army Garrison Giessen was held on 28 September, and on 10 January 2008 Ray Barracks was officially closed. It was last occupied by a 102nd Signal Battalion telephone switch for the Friedburg and Giessen United States Army garrisons, originally installed in 1986. The installation was then returned to the German government.

This indicates the deep roots of the village in the field of vine-growing and wine-making. The village is well known for the high quality of its grapes and wines. Legend At the time Henry I was King of France, the country‚Äôs vineyards from which champagne was produced were destroyed by disease. The King went in search of healthy plants, which he found in the house of Rousos of Laneia. The healthy vines were loaded on a ship, transported to France and used to replant the Champagne vineyards. Today The inhabitants of the village are occupied with-growing and the production of wine-related products including Zivania, Commandaria and Soutzoukos. Amongst the flower-lined streets and traditional architecture lies the village church, dedicated to St. Mary.

History It was recorded in the Domesday book as Stocheland meaning 'A stockade with land' from the Old English stoc and land. The name Bristol was added later from its medieval owner, Bristol Corporation. Stockland Bristol was part of the hundred of Cannington. In the early 13th century the manor of Stockland was held by Maurice de Gaunt (d.1230), who left it in his will to St Mark's Hospital, Bristol, later known as Gaunts Hospital. In 1541 the manor was granted to Bristol Corporation, which held it until 1839. The village lies on Combwich Reach as the River Parrett flows to the sea. The Steart peninsula has flooded many times during the last millennium. The most severe recent floods occurred in 1981. By 1997, a combination of coastal erosion, sea level rise and wave action had made some of the defences distinctly fragile and at risk from failure. As a result, in 2002 the Environment Agency produced the Stolford to Combwich Coastal Defence Strategy Study to examine options for the future. In the early part of World War II Stockland Bristol was chosen by the Radio Security Service (RSS) as the site for two wireless Direction Finding (D/F) stations known as Y-stations. They were located in the fields alongside Steart Road. These installations would have been used to locate the source of enemy radio transmissions. They were demolished after 1945. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Bridgwater Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Bridgwater and West Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

He was a competent actor, comedian and playwright, could paint scenery, cut out dresses, and do stage-carpentering. He was also an innovator, successful theatre manager, speculator and builder of theatres. In his early days he travelled widely and by the age of 23 had performed in England, America, Australia and South Africa. In June 1855, he visited Cape Town, ostensibly for a stopover on the way home to England from Australia. He stayed two months, constructed his first theatre and presented a number of performances. He returned several times to Cape Town and between 1857 and 1863 built two theatres, established the first professional theatre company and introduced the first seasonal pantomime. Parry is recognised as playing an important role in the development of English professional theatre in South Africa. Returning to England, he set up home in Greenwich, built a theatre there in 1864 and, over the next twenty years, built three more in London and two in the provinces.  Early Days  Sefton Parry, born in London in 1832, was the youngest child of John and Martha Parry, a theatrical family.1871, 1881 England, Wales & Scotland Census, Sefton Parry, Elizabeth, Emily, Mabel, Greenwich In his earliest travels.he had been described as one of the leading attractions at Barnum's Museum in New York.The Monitor cited in Bosman, 1928 p. 429 Parry's wife, Elizabeth, an actress, was born in Philadelphia. In 1854 Parry briefly visited Cape Town on his way to Australia where he performed at Geelong and Melbourne. He was lionised by the Australian theatre-goers and well rewarded. Despite his English birth, he was described by the Australian correspondent of The Era as an American comedian.The Era, 23 July 1854 p.11, Australasian Theatricals  Drawing Room Theatre, Cape Town 1855  In 1855, returning to England from Australia, and accompanied by his wife Elizabeth, Parry arranged to stop over a little while longer in Cape Town.The Era 9 December 1860 p.10 Deciding the local Garrison Theatre was unsuitable for his use, he quickly constructed what he named the Drawing Room Theatre inside a large room in the Commercial Exchange building. It had 350 seats and was fitted up on the same model as the Reuben's Room in Windsor Castle. The first official performance was on Wednesday, June 13 when he put on Dion Boucicault's comedy, Used Up, or The Peer and the Ploughboy and the farce Family Jars by Joseph Lunn. He and his wife played the leads, helped by members of the Garrison Amateur Company. Parry received a rapturous welcome, and this persuaded him to stay longer. The Garrison Amateur Company, otherwise known as the Gentleman Amateurs, was a military group of long standing formed during the first occupation of the Cape by the British in 1799. The outbreak of the border wars between 1850 and 1853 naturally curtailed the Garrison's theatrical activities. The arrival of Sefton Parry, together with the establishment of a permanent professional theatre, caused them to finally disband. Parry postponed his return to England a number of times, giving more performances and working with local amateur groups, notably the Cape Town Dramatic Club. J.R. Taylor acted as his impresario and had been promised a benefit, but this was replaced by a benefit for Patriotic Fund. The Music Corps of Mr Holt assisted in some of the performances. Their farewell performance was held on Thursday, July 26, consisting of A Phenomenon in a Smock Frock (Brough), The Lottery Ticket (Beazley) and Buried Alive, or The Visit to Japan (M'Pherson). Finally, after two months he left and, returning to London in the winter of 1855, was engaged by the Strand Theatre, where, with another change of persona, he was publicised as an Australian comedian and as making his first appearance in England.The Era, 25 November 1858 p.1  Further Cape Town visits 1857 - 1863  = Harrington Street Theatre 1857 - 1859 = Parry returned to Cape Town in 1857, this time with a professional British theatre-company, and built a wooden theatre in Harrington Street. He is said to have introduced the tradition of a seasonal pantomime with his production of Beauty and the Beast in 1857. Despite that, he claimed the record again the following year and billed Babes in the Wood as \\"The First Christmas Pantomime in South Africa\\". It was performed on 27 and 28 December in the Cape Town Theatre with an additional performance at the request of the Governor. Also in 1858 Parry launched the first recorded professional performance of the full play of Hamlet in his season of Shakespeare plays. During the season, James Lycett, a Shakespeare-loving English businessman who had organised amateur dramatics in Cape Town for many years, was accidentally wounded on stage while playing Macduff to Parry's Macbeth. Competition came early in 1858 from J. E. H. English, self-styled 'celebrated comic vocalist' at the Theatre Royal, Sheffield, who had arrived in Cape Town with other members of the Sefton Parry Company. After just two months English broke away and set up a rival company called \\"The Gentlemen Amateurs\\" in The New Music Hall, Buitekant Street which he had fitted for himself. English's success was considerable, leading Parry to quit the Cape. Parry sold his theatre to W Glyn, a Cape Town businessman who built and let theatres to some profit. Glyn then let the Harrington Street Theatre to Mr English. However, by November, English had disappeared from the scene and the following year, 1859, Parry returned and bought back his theatre. The same year, during his travels, Parry, his wife and fellow professional comedian George Spencer successfully entertained in Gibraltar for several months along with some amateurs from the garrison. The three then sailed on the P&O; steamer Ceylon to Malta to entertain there.Morning Post, 22 April 1859 - Malta = Theatre Royal 1860 = Parry then commissioned Glyn to build a brick theatre at the corner of Caledon and Harrington street. Much of the planning was Parry's and that of his associate William Groom. It was so constructed that it could be turned into cottages in an emergency. Parry named it the Theatre Royal. It opened on 9 August 1860. (The Theatre Royal was also briefly referred to as the Cape Town Theatre.) Parry broke away from the Cape Town Dramatic Club to form the Alfred Dramatic Club and in so doing effectively established the first regular professional theatre company in South Africa. It had almost 40 members with Parry as manager and G.H. Galt as secretary. After the success of The Irish Tutor on 15 September, Prince Alfred, who was visiting, bestowed his name upon them, and they became known as the Royal Alfred Dramatic Club. Parry returned to London in November 1860 on the Royal Mail steamer Dane via St Helena and Ascension.Morning Chronicle, Friday 30 November 1860 - Cape of Good Hope He advertised in The Era that he was 'now prepared to negotiate engagements with Dramatic artists for the Theatre Royal, Cape Town'.The Era, 02 December 1860 p.12 His London agent was Henry Butler, 21, Bow- street, also associated with Henry Jameson Turner.The Era 25 July 1858; 1865 A brief journalistic battled took place. A Cape Town correspondent of The Era, probably in the minority, was less than complimentary about Mr Parry's performances though he favoured those of Mrs Parry. On the same page Harry Fraser, one of Parry's actors, challenged his plans to recruit professional players from England saying that the heat in summer was oppressive, the money was poor and opportunities were limited.The Era, 2 December 1860 p.12 (from the Cape of Good Hope Mail & Advertiser) Parry defended his reputation in the following week's edition. He referred to his previous three year commitment to South Africa, to the quality of the theatre he had built and to his investment in the English actors whose fares he paid to come to South Africa. = 1861 - 1863 = On 19 February 1861, several of Parry's players, Mrs Clara Tellett, Mr & Mrs W. Bland & Louisa Bland, Thomas Brazier, James Leffier and John Howard, set sail from Bristol with Captain Ferguson on the barque \\"Chevy Chase\\" bound for Cape Town. After 6,000 tedious miles and nearly three months, they arrived safe and well on May 7. The following week the theatre opened.The Era, 30 June 1861; Letter from Cape Town dated 22 May 1861 From 1861 until 1863 Parry and his first professional company, the Royal Alfred Dramatic Club, now reunited with the Cape Town Dramatic Club, utilized the Theatre Royal's stage. The Era's correspondent reported that \\"the success of Mr. Sefton Parry's Company at the Theatre Royal here has been considerable, and we should think, judging from the crowded houses, that Mr. P. must be well satisfied with the financial prospects of his undertaking. Mr. Parry's Low Comedy is exceedingly good and his characters are invariably hits. The Theatre is really a blessing to us, for Cape Town is awfully dull, and we are glad to think that Mr. Parry's enterprise is meeting with the reward he so well deserves. The Drama at the Cape of Good Hope has never before been so well represented in Africa as it has been during the last three or four months\\". Mrs Clarissa Tellett was a great favourite with the audiences, and even more so with Captain Ferguson whom she married.The Era, 4 August 1861, p.10 THEATRICAL NEWS. from the Cape of Good Hope. (from our own correspondent.) Cape Town, 21 June 1861 Shuter Bland, a well known British stage manager, was part of the Sefton Parry company from 1861 to 1862 and participated in 50 productions between May and November. He possibly accompanied the three-month tour to Port Elizabeth in 1862 where Parry took on the lease of the White's Road Theatre. Parry opened with Planche's Grist to the Mill on 2 June. The rest of the Bland family were still in the company.(Bosman, 1981, Fletcher, 1994) The following year, 1863, Parry wound up his Cape Town activities and then went on to Natal to close down the Port Elizabeth theatre. After Parry left Cape Town, Mrs Tellett took over the management of the Theatre Royal, but was not successful. Cape playgoers favoured talent from England and she was hampered by a serious shortage of professional actors. It closed before the end of the year.The Era 3 May 1863 p.14, Cape Town (from our own correspondent) 21 March 1863The Era 3 January 1864 p.10 The Encyclopaedia of South African Theatre, Film, Media and Performance (ESAT) describes Sefton Parry as the first of several strong personalities from England and Australia who helped establish professional theatre in South Africa.  Greenwich Theatre 1864  Parry returned to England and in September 1863, as 'an actor from the Cape of Good Hope', appeared at the Princess's Theatre London as Cousin Joe in the farce of The Rough Diamond, and \\"displayed so much broad comic humour as to gain the hearty applause of his audience and the good will of the press.\\"Leeds Intelligencer, 19 September 1863 p.3 In November, Parry reopened His Majesty's Theatre in Richmond, Surrey.The Era, 29 November 1863 p.11 Both he and his wife performed. Parry's return to England marked the construction of several new theatres. Parry's first theatre, the Greenwich Theatre, was built on a vacant site on London Street at Greenwich, which he opened in May 1864 with seating for a thousand people.The Era, 29th May 1864 p.10 He promised that the style of performance would be similar to that of the old Adelphi, but with improvements that would suit contemporary taste; his enterprise would also draw on the latest skills and theatrical inventions. As actor- manager he gathered round him a small company, comprised initially of Bessie Foote (from Theatre Royal, Edinburgh), Eliza Hamilton (from Theatre Royal, Sadler's Wells), Sallie Turner (comedian and eldest daughter of Henry Jameson Turner of the Royal Strand), Josephine Ruth (from Theatre Royal, Portsmouth), and Marion Foote; and Messrs. Frank Barsby (from Theatre Royal, Brighton), W. Foote (Theatre Royal, Edinburgh), E. Danvers (Royal Strand Theatre), and Mr Westland. The theatre was initially known as the New Greenwich Theatre. Although it subsequently acquired several names including Theatre Royal, Morton's Theatre, Prince of Wales Theatre and Carlton Theatre, it was always known as the Greenwich Theatre. It was put up for auction in 1909 and soon after became a cinema.  Five More Theatres  Parry made his home in Greenwich near the theatre with his wife Elizabeth and daughter Emily. His second daughter, Mabel, was born there. He prepared plans and undertook the preliminary management for more theatres in London and the provinces.\\"Parry, Sefton Henry\\". Dictionary of National Biography. London: Smith, Elder & Co. 1885‚Äì1900 = Theatre Royal, Holborn 1866 = Despite the passing of the Theatres Act 1843 over twenty years earlier that broke the monopoly of the patent theatres, no new theatre had been added to the places of entertainment in central London until Parry built, upon the site of an old coach-house and stables, the first of his central London theatres, called, after the thoroughfare in which it was situated, the Holborn Theatre. It opened on 6 October 1866 with Dion Boucicault's drama, specially written for the occasion, The Flying Scud, with a real horse and George Belmore as Nat Gosling the old jockey, was a great success. Parry remained lessee of the house until 1872. It burnt down on 4 July 1880, and the First Avenue Hotel later stood on the site. = Globe Theatre 1868 = In 1868 he built on a portion of the ground of Old Lyon's Inn in Newcastle Street, Strand, a house which he christened the Globe Theatre with seating for about 1500. It opened on 28 November 1868 with H. J. Byron's comedy, Cyril's Success. No other piece of much mark was produced during Parry's management there, which lasted until 1871. = New Theatre Royal, Hull 1871 = Parry also built the New Theatre Royal, Hull which he opened on November 27, 1871 with a production by his own company of the Post Boy by H. T. Craven and Tom Taylor, The Ticket of Leave Man. Parry played the lead in both plays. = The Royal Avenue Theatre 1882 = In early 1880, Parry, recovering from a severe attack of paralysis, started planning his next theatre, to be called The Royal Avenue, at the corner of Craven Street and Northumberland Avenue, facing the Thames.London and Provincial Entr'acte, 27 March 1880 p. 4 This opened on 11 March 1882, with Jacques Offenbach's opera Madame Favart, in which Florence St. John took the title r√¥le. The lessee was Mr. Edmund Burke and the manager, M. Marius. The seating capacity was about 1300. = Prince of Wales Theatre, Southampton 1883 = His final construction was the Prince of Wales Theatre in Southampton which he opened in June 1883. The plan of the building was similar to that of his Globe Theatre in London and the Theatre Royal in Hull. Parry described it as the best and most convenient he had ever erected.The Era, 2 June 1883  Final Years  Parry wrote The Bright Future, a drama produced at the opening of the Grand Theatre, Islington, on 4 August 1883. Parry died, after much suffering from a paralytic attack, at Cricklewood Lodge, Middlesex, in 1887, aged fifty-five, and was buried in Old Willesden churchyard. After his death his theatres were managed by the Sefton Parry Trust; the Trust continued into the 20th century.The Era, 21 July 1888, Mr Sefton Parry's Will William Morton, noted for his management of the illusionists Maskelyne and Cooke, had, at Parry's request, taken on the management of the then ailing Greenwich Theatre in 1885. Morton turned this around and later bought it outright from the Trustees. Morton was also appointed a representative of the Trust, overseeing all their properties. In 1895, the Trust persuaded Morton to take on the management of the Theatre Royal Hull.Morton, William (1932). I Remember. (A Feat of Memory.) p. 95 Market-place. Hull: Goddard. Walker and Brown.

The civil parish includes the larger village of Combwich and the small village of Steart. History It was recorded in the Domesday book as Utramestone meaning 'The outermost enclosure' from the Old English ultramest and tun. An alternative derivation is from the Saxon, meaning \\"place of Ottrane\\" the original Saxon thane. Otterhampton was part of the hundred of Cannington. The Steart peninsula has flooded many times during the last millennium. The most severe recent floods occurred in 1981. By 1997, a combination of coastal erosion, sea level rise and wave action had made some of the defences distinctly fragile and at risk from failure. As a result, in 2002 the Environment Agency produced the Stolford to Combwich Coastal Defence Strategy Study to examine options for the future. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Bridgwater Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Bridgwater and West Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Religious sites The Church of St Peter was built in 1870 by J. Knowles for Susanna Lewes Jeffery, and has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building. All Saints church, dates from the 14th century, and is now a Grade II* listed building. It overlooks the River Parrett. A church was established on the site in the 12th century, was valued at ¬£5 in 1291,'Otterhampton: Church', A History of the County of Somerset: Volume 6: Andersfield, Cannington, and North Petherton Hundreds (Bridgwater and neighbouring parishes) (1992), pp. 108‚Äì109. URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18584 Date accessed: 25 July 2010 although the current building largely dates from the 14th. The perpendicular west tower was added later and has an Elizabethan bell-frame with 4 bells, one of which dates from the 16th century and two others are dated 1617 and 1737. The original dedication was to St Peter, however it was later renamed All Saints. The interior includes a Norman font with a Jacobean cover, a screen from the 16th century and 17th century communion rails. It is now in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.

Parsons, youngest son of Thomas Parsons of Newport, Shropshire, was born at Newport, and educated by the Rev. Richard Thurstfield of Pattingham, then by the Rev. Francis Blick of Tamworth, and afterwards privately at Oxford; but hard reading brought on inflammation of the eyes, which obliged him to give up all study. He then settled in the city of London, and became a member of the Stock Exchange. Early in his London career he took an interest in railways, was elected an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers on 5 Feb. 1839, and on 9 Feb. 1843 became a director of the London and Brighton Railway Company, of which he was appointed chairman on 19 June 1843. In this office he was succeeded by Pascoe Grenfell on 11 April 1844, and ceased to be a director on 21 Aug. 1848. He was also a director of the Shropshire Union Railway from 1845 to 1849. For many years he resided at 6 Raymond Buildings, Gray's Inn, and spent much of his time in collecting pictures and works of art. He had amassed at the time of his death a valuable gallery of pictures, principally of the German and Dutch schools, and of water-colour drawings by English artists. By his will he left to the trustees of the National Gallery, London, such of his oil paintings, not exceeding one hundred, as they might choose to select, and in case of their declining to accept the gift wholly or in part, then the same right of selection to the department of science and art at South Kensington. He also bequeathed to South Kensington any of his water-colours, sepia or charcoal drawings which they might be pleased to select, not exceeding one hundred. The trustees of the National Gallery selected only three, ‚ÄòFishing Boats in a Breeze off the West,‚Äô by J. M. W. Turner, and two paintings by P. J. Clays of Brussels. The department of science and art in June 1870 selected ninety-two oil and forty-seven water-colour paintings. A number of fine engravings were also left to the British Museum. Parsons removed from 6 Raymond Buildings in November 1869 to 45 Russell Square, Bloomsbury, and died there. He married a daughter of John Mayhew, but was soon left a widower with one daughter, Ellen, who, on 16 May 1860, married Sir Charles William Atholl Oakeley, bart., of Frittenden House, Staplehurst, Kent.

Life Ogilvie, son of John Ogilvie of Whitehaven, Cumberland, who died at Duloe, Cornwall, 25 April 1839, by his wife Catharine Curwen of the Isle of Man, was born at Whitehaven 20 Nov. 1793, and matriculated from Balliol College, Oxford, on 27 November 1811. After taking a first class in 1815, he won the chancellor's prize for the English essay in 1817. He graduated B.A. 1815, M.A. 1818, B.D. and D.D. 1842. In 1816 he was elected a fellow of his college, and took holy orders. He was tutor 1819‚Äì30, bursar 1822, and senior dean 1842. He was appointed a university examiner in 1823 and 1824, and examiner in the classical school in 1825. He greatly assisted Richard Jenkyns, the master of Balliol, in improving the tone and discipline of the college, and contributed largely to giving it a foremost place in the university. About 1829 he was looked on as a leader of the high-church party in Oxford, but he gave little active support to the Oxford movement. He was a select preacher before the university in 1825, 1832, and 1844, and was made Bampton lecturer in 1836. Ogilvie held some clerical preferment while still fellow and tutor of Balliol. He was rector of Wickford, Essex, from 4 January 1822 to 1833; rector of Abbotsley, Huntingdonshire, from 30 Aug. 1822 to 1839; and vicar of Duloe from 20 October 1833 to 1840. The rectory and vicarage of Ross, Herefordshire, conferred on him 6 Dec. 1839, he held till his death. For a time he acted as domestic and examining chaplain to Archbishop Howley. He resigned his fellowship in 1834. Ogilvie became the first Regius Professor of Pastoral Theology on 23 April 1842, and as professor he succeeded in 1849 to a canonry at Christ Church, under the provisions of the Act 3 and 4 Vict. c. 113. Through life he maintained a close friendship with Martin Joseph Routh, president of Magdalen College, with whom he corresponded on literary subjects from 1847 to 1854. He was also very intimate with Joseph Blanco White. While lecturing on 15 Feb. 1873 he was seized with paralysis, and died in his house at Christ Church, Oxford, two days later. He was buried in the Latin Chapel in Christ Church Cathedral. By his marriage, on 18 April 1838, to Mary Ann Gurnell, daughter of Major Armstrong (who died 2 Oct. 1875), he had two daughters.

It was introduced in 1991, as part of the Action 52 multi-game cartridge for the NES. The Cheetahmen also appear in an unpublished sequel for the NES (Cheetahmen II), and an obscure Sega Genesis title that was simply called \\"The Cheetahmen.\\" Plot A boy called the \\"Action Gamemaster\\" is depicted in the first Cheetahmen game's intro sequence, which serves as a framing device. The boy is shown playing a video game when he is abruptly pulled into his television by a robotic arm and meets the Cheetahmen. He is never referred to again during the game or in subsequent Cheetahmen titles, although the manual implies that he transforms into the characters, one after another. A backstory is provided in a comic book that was included with the Action 52 NES cartridge. A mad scientist named Dr. Morbis kills a mother cheetah while on a safari in Africa and takes its three cubs to his laboratory. Subjected to genetic experimentation, the cubs transform into human-cheetah hybrids who eventually turn on Dr. Morbis after gaining awareness of his true nature and future plans. Dr. Morbis responds by creating an army of various human-animal hybrids (known as \\"Sub-Humans\\") to counter the threat posed by the self-aware Cheetahmen. Dr. Morbis does not appear during gameplay, though other villains from the comic book do appear. The Genesis game provides a slightly different premise where the Cheetamen must rescue cheetah cubs from Dr. Morbis. Characters Opening cutscene The playable characters included: *Apollo ‚Äì an anthropomorphic cheetah named for Apollo, an ancient Greek god. As his name may suggest, this character is an archer and a scholar versed in many academic fields. He uses a crossbow in combat. As the leader of the Cheetahmen, he was the first to question Dr. Morbis' intentions. *Hercules ‚Äì an anthropomorphic cheetah named for Hercules, an ancient Greek demigod. This character fights with his bare hands, as his mythological namesake did not use a weapon. *Aries ‚Äì an anthropomorphic cheetah named for Ares, the ancient Greek god of war. This character acquired the expertise for fighting with dual wooden clubs by watching movies shown to him by Dr. Morbis. The enemies included: * Dr. Morbis ‚Äì a malevolent scientific expert in the field of genetic engineering. His ultimate goals are never made clear. * Cygore ‚Äì a cyborg with a robotic arm. In marketing materials, he was depicted with a number of weapon attachments that were never used in the games, including a hammer and buzzsaw. * White Rhino ‚Äì an anthropomorphic rhinoceros, one of the \\"Sub-Humans\\" created by Dr. Morbis. * Scavenger ‚Äì an anthropomorphic vulture, one of the \\"Sub-Humans\\" created by Dr. Morbis. * Hyena ‚Äì an anthropomorphic hyena, one of the \\"Sub-Humans\\" created by Dr. Morbis. * Ape-Man ‚Äì a chimpanzee-human hybrid, allegedly the most powerful of Dr. Morbis' \\"Sub-Humans\\". Cheetahmen The initial game of this franchise was included on the Action 52 multi-game cartridge for the NES. It was inconsistently titled \\"Cheetah Men\\", \\"Cheetahmen\\", \\"Cheetamen\\", and \\"The Cheetahmen\\" within the game selection screen, title screen, and marketing materials. Gameplay consists of six levels, two for each of the three Cheetahmen. The second level includes a boss battle. Most of in-game enemies are characters from the other games of the Action 52 cartridge, including Saddam Hussein parody Sat√°n Hossain from Storm over the Desert. Cheetahmen II There were plans for a sequel, Cheetahmen II, but it was not completed (6 of 10 proposed levels were made) and was never officially released. In 1996, however, 1,500 copies of the game were found located in a warehouse in Florida and eventually put on sale on the secondary market. All copies of the game were reused Action 52 cartridges, some with a small gold sticker reading \\"\\". This cartridge is now very rare and hard to find. In Cheetahmen II the player again assumes the role of one of the three Cheetahmen (Aries, Apollo and Hercules); after defeating a boss at the end of the second level, they switch to the next Cheetahman for the following two levels, as in the Action 52 version. Due to a bug, it is impossible to get to the levels in which one plays Cheetahman Aries without altering the ROM image or experiencing a glitch that very rarely starts the game on these two levels. A patch fixing all the game-breaking bugs was made freely available by romhacking.net member PacoChan in July 2011. Subsequently, a \\"fixed\\" version of the game titled Cheetahmen II: The Lost Levels was developed by Greg Pabich. The new version of the game was released on an actual NES cartridge and was intended to fix the 4th level end glitch found in the original game. To fund the game, Pabich started a Kickstarter program in which donors would be given rewards depending on the amount of money pledged. The program started on August 6, 2012, and lasted until September 6, 2012. To tie in with the project, a short video was shot with the Angry Video Game Nerd, Pat the NES Punk, The Game Chasers, and Pabich himself advertising the game.

Biography Noad, born at Shawford, near Frome, Somerset, 22 June 1815, was son of Humphrey Noad, by Maria Hunn, a half-sister of the Rt. Hon. George Canning. He was educated at Frome grammar school, and was intended for the civil service in India, but the death of his patron, William Huskisson, caused a change in his career, and he commenced the study of chemistry and electricity. About 1836 he delivered lectures on these subjects at the literary and scientific institutions of Bath and Bristol. He next examined the peculiar voltaic conditions of iron and bismuth,Philosophical Mag. 1838, xii. 48‚Äì52 described some properties of the water battery, and elucidated that curious phenomenon the passive state of iron. In 1845 he came to London, and studied chemistry under August Wilhelm Hofmann, in the newly founded Royal College of Chemistry. While with Hofmann he made researches on the oxidation of cymol or cymene, the hydro-carbon which Gerhardt and Cahours discovered in 1840 in the volatile oil of Roman cumin. The results were in part communicated to the Chemical SocietyMemoirs, 1845‚Äì8, iii. 421‚Äì40 at the time, and more fully afterwards to the Philosophical Magazine, 1848, xxxii. 15‚Äì35. Among other organic products, legumine and vitelline also formed materials for his investigations. In 1847 he was appointed to the chair of chemistry in the medical school of St George's Hospital, which he held till his death. About 1849 he obtained the degree of doctor of physics from the university of Giessen, and in 1850‚Äì1 conducted, conjointly with Henry Gray, an inquiry into the composition and functions of the spleen. The essay resulting from this investigation gained the Astley Cooper prize of 1852. He next experimented on the chemistry of iron, and in 1860 contributed the article ‚ÄòIron‚Äô to Robert Hunt's edition of ‚ÄòUre's Dictionary.‚Äô This led to his appointment as consulting chemist to the Ebbw Vale Iron Company, the Cwm Celyn and Blaina, the Aberdare and Plymouth, and other ironworks in South Wales. In 1866 he became examiner of malt liquors to the India office, and in 1872 an examiner in chemistry and physics at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. When the Panopticon of Science and Arts in Leicester Square was opened in 1854, he was appointed instructor in chemistry there. On 5 June 1856 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. Noad was a member of the London Electrical Society. In 1839 he published A Course of Eight Lectures on Electricity, Galvanism, Magnetism, and Electro-Magnetism, which became a recognised textbook, passing through four editions; in 1857 it gave place to A Manual of Electricity in two volumes, which was long a standard book. In 1848 he wrote a valuable treatise on Chemical Manipulation and Analysis, Qualitative and Quantitative, for the Library of Useful Knowledge, and re-wrote in 1875 A Normandy's Commercial Handbook of Chemical Analysis, a volume which meets the wants of the analyst while discharging his duties under the Adulteration Act. He died at his son's residence in High Street, Lower Norwood, Surrey, on 23 July 1877. Charlotte Jane, his widow, died on 25 March 1882, aged 67. He was buried at West Norwood Cemetery.

In 2010, a DVD was released in the Czech Republic and also in Slovakia (with original Slovak dubbing for both countries). Plot summary Sir Charles Pemberton travelled to New Zealand from the United Kingdom on the advice of his doctor. Once there, he forms an idea to build a health spa on Maori land. The story took place in New Zealand in 1900 and portrays the conflict between the world of the Maori and the white settlers. A sub plot is the friendship between Tom (the son of the hotel owner where Sir Charles stays) and Sarah Jane (the granddaughter of Sir Charles). While it initially gets off to a rocky start, with Tom getting into a lot of trouble with his friends for being rude to their English guests, it leads to a friendship through which Sir Charles is shown the error of his ways in trying to push through his plans. Eventually, they come to nought as a volcano erupts on the land showing the danger of interfering with Maori land. Doomey Dwyer had an illicit still, which he used to supply his 'grog'.

The country was a Spanish colony from approximately 1511 until 1898. The United States governed the nation from 1898‚Äì1902, and would intervene in national affairs until the abolishment of the Platt Amendment in 1935. The struggle for independence and a national identity was a complex and prolonged affair that began in earnest during the late 18th century and lasted well into the 20th century. Spanish colonial period From the island's discovery in 1492 to 1750, Spain ruled Cuba from afar, with a Crown-appointed Governor overseeing the colony under the military title of Captain General. Laws approved by the Governor crossed the Atlantic and were then filtered between countless levels of colonial bureaucracy. The administrators tended to compromise with local elites, who were often granted permission to administer justice themselves. In the 1630s, Americans were permitted to hold office in Cuba; by 1678, they were allowed to hold judgeships. These positions were quickly filled by wealthy criollo, who often purchased the privilege directly, and operated with reduced Spanish supervision. This led to increased corruption, and drove a wedge between the wealthy and the working-class. In the 1750s, when Spain sought to reassert control in the Americas, these elite positions were greatly weakened, much to the anger of those who had enjoyed the collateral benefits of authority. In the early 19th century, Cuban nationalist movement lagged behind its counterparts in the rest of Latin America. Maintaining good relations with Spain was essential for the health of Cuba's primarily agrarian economy, as the island nation was heavily dependent at the time upon exporting its sugar to European markets. Cuba, as one of the last outposts of slavery, also relied on Spain for protection against any potential slave uprisings. As compared to most other Latin American countries at the time, a very large percentage of the Cuban population were Spaniards or their descendants; the native Ta√≠no and Ciboney peoples had mostly disappeared in Cuba early in the colonial period. Nonetheless, during the 19th century, vocal nationalists like Jose Marti inspired Cubans to rebel against their colonizers. Many nationalists saw Spain as incapable of supporting a booming Cuban economy. Cuba made use of new industrial technologies, such as steam engines, well before their large-scale introduction in Spain. Nationalists thus concluded that Cuba was entering a new stage of modernity, while Spain was becoming more and more obsolete, and holding Cuba back from economic and political success. The dissatisfaction with Spain's inept administration, their lack of representation in the government, and high taxes sparked the beginning of the 10 years war in which over 200,000 lives were lost. Being crushed by the Spanish army only fueled their nationalism even more. It caused a uniting of all the Cuban people, with an emphasis on former slaves, who were freed shortly after the war. However, when the Cubans rose up again, Spain implemented their policy of Reconcentration. This forced hundreds of thousands of Cubans into labor camps, where they worked and were starved. This furthered their nationalism even more because they couldn't take what was being done to their own people. The stories of the rebels' bravery and nationalism eventually reached the United States, who sent aid which soon became the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. However, the Spanish control of Cuba soon became replaced with a large American influence in Cuba's affairs. Once again Cuban nationalism was an at an all-time high since they had just fought for their own independence, and now they had another country in their affairs.  Integration of former slaves  Between 1780 and 1867, over 780 000 slaves were brought to Cuba. This was more than all the rest of Spanish America combined. Slavery was leaned upon heavily by the owners of the highly profitable sugar plantations. By 1886, people of colour ‚Äì the majority being ex-slaves ‚Äì made up 1/3 of the population of Cuba. The issue of integration was a complex and highly contentious issue. Rights were hard to come by for many former slaves and also for those who lived and worked in rural communities. Emancipation was a slow process that started in 1868 and continued until 1886. As a preliminary step, the Moret Law of 1870 granted freedom to children and those over the age of sixty but offered little else. As the skirmishes continued and losses compounded during the 10 Years‚Äô War, the anti-colonial forces spoke more openly about the idea of a free Cuban citizen. Even though there was still a strong racial divide, many slaves joined up with the revolutionaries. Although this initial rebellion did not force any significant changes, the participation of slaves did not go unnoticed. By the early 1890s, Spain was willing to offer fairly considerable civil rights and voting rights to many former slaves in a vain attempt to weaken another attempt at rebellion. Prior to the 1890s, suffrage had been granted uniquely to taxpayers (it was further expanded in 1895 and again in 1898 when all links between property and suffrage were severed). This back- fired, however, as it only provoked white elites who intensified their criticism directed at colonial policies. While white Cuban elites and their colonial administrators debated civil rights and public policy, black Cubans had already been showing initiative. The first step toward property rights came when farm owners allowed their slaves to own a pig. A pig could grow, accrue value, be sold for profit or consumed. Many people quickly seized upon the potential of this and began raising as many pigs as possible, even feeding them from their own rations to keep them growing. The pigs would then be sold to either the plantation owner or someone else, and a profit would be made. These profits would sometimes parlay into the ownership of a horse, which implied a certain degree of freedom and mobility. Worker mobility was also important in spreading information (concerning revolution, property rights, etc.) to other interested communities. After slavery was phased out by 1888, many former slaves had little choice but to stay on the farms on which they had been prisoners for years. The plantation owners adapted to the situation by incorporating wage labour, tenantry and contract farming. After gaining their freedom, some more fortunate ex-slaves were sold small plots of land where they could build a house and plant crops for their own consumption and for sale at market. According to the Spanish Civil Code, rights of possession were paramount, making a signed and verified agreement very important. In 1890, however, a new civil code (which had been introduced in Spain the year before) came into effect which acknowledged the rights of prescription (squatter's rights). Granted, these rights were minimally recognized, but still they motivated many landless workers to occupy and cultivate previously unused land.  Struggles for freedom  * Ten Years' War (1868‚Äì1878) * The Little War (1879‚Äì1880) * Cuban War of Independence (1895‚Äì1898) US occupation There was no mass departure of the Spanish middle-class in the years immediately after the end of Spanish rule. They were allowed to maintain their Spanish citizenship and also to hold onto the majority of the elite posts available in business and in the Church. A misguided education system had ill-prepared Cubans from filling positions in expanding industries which were primarily driven by US interests. When the occupation officially ended on May 20, 1902, nationalists could, for the first time, look upon an independent Cuba. Although it was a time of celebration, it would prove to be a difficult transition to complete autonomy and self-definition. The island-nation had always had her national identity threatened and had been under repressive foreign control for centuries. With no real pre-Spanish nationalist mythology to speak of, Cubans would have to quickly try and identify themselves in the modern world. Even with a crisp demarcation of borders and territory, it would not be immediately clear what it meant to be Cuban.

In his leisure he frequented the cathedral and other churches in the city and its neighbourhood, and grew interested in ecclesiastical art. At his request his master taught him carving, and he rapidly showed unusual skill and ability. In 1842 he left Norwich and commenced business as a wood-carver in Sidney Street, Cambridge. He founded a limited company in 1843 and was joined by George Kett to form Rattee and Kett in 1848. The Cambridge Camden Society soon discovered Rattee's talent, and took him into their service. From Thomas Thorp, William Hodge Mill, F. A. Paley, and other members of the society, he received assistance and patronage. Rattee erected extensive workshops, plant, and steam power, on Hills Road, Cambridge. He was associated with Augustus Welby Pugin in restoring the choir of Jesus College chapel; the designs were made principally by Rattee, and submitted to Pugin before execution. In the choir of Ely Cathedral he carried out the designs of George Gilbert Scott, and the oak screen, stalls, organ- case, and restored tomb of Bishop William de Luda or Louth (d. 1298) were exquisitely wrought.

In the same year he delivered the first systematic course of lectures on the principles of decorative art, illustrated with drawings on the blackboard.

One of the biggest is held in the city of Geelong, Victoria, Australia. The festival raises money for the Geelong Hospital, and was known for the street parade through central Geelong which featured local community groups, amusement rides in the main street, a sideshow alley, and showbag stalls. History The first Gala Day was held on Friday, 3 November 1916, at the height of World War I, to raise money for the Red Cross Society. Described by the Geelong Advertiser as \\"the biggest fete the city had ever seen, the most perfectly planned function, the gayest spectacle, and the highest in patriotic purpose\\", the first parade raised 5500 pounds - a staggering amount for the day. After the success of the first festival, Gala Day was adopted as an annual event, the second festival being held on 2 November 1917. It was not until 1927 that the Geelong Hospital took over responsibility for running the festival. The festival was traditionally held on a Friday, and students at local schools were given a holiday. From 2006, the festival was changed, being renamed the Gala Appeal \\"Family Fun Day\\" and moved to the first week of December. The festival is now held in Johnstone Park, and has been accused of being \\"watered down\\" from the old event by some. In 2008, the event was again changed, with the Gala Day Parade and Family Fun Day moved to a Saturday. Schools, community groups and corporate groups can enter a float in the parade. The Family Fun Day returned to the city's spectacular waterfront at Steampacket Gardens, featuring market and food stalls, rides, show bags and roving performances from local artists, including renowned interpretive dance duo Barnes and Tommy, who received the 2015 GMHBA Encouragement Award for a spirited routine to John Farnham's \\"Two Strong Hearts.\\" Many cities that observe Gala Day in 2020 will go virtual on grounds of COVID-19 pandemic.

He was a \\"world expert on wild flowers with an orchid named after him\\". His sister was Pauline Vogelpoel. Louis graduated from the University of Cape Town in 1945 with first class honours and a prize for the best student of that year. He was awarded the C J Adams and Nuffield dominion fellowships, which allowed him to spend two years at the National Heart Hospital in London] in the early fifties, where he developed his lifelong interest and expertise in cardiology. He married in 1951. He trained under Paul Wood. He returned to Cape Town in 1953 and was appointed as a part-time physician and lecturer in the department of medicine and cardiac clinic at the University of Cape Town and Groote Schuur Hospital. He was one of the founding members of the Cardiac Clinic at Groote Schuur Hospital and University of Cape Town. His clinical research activities resulted in the award of an MD with first class honours in 1959 and the publication of many papers, some of which are still quoted. Many of his earlier contributions reflected truly original observations when modern cardiology was in its infancy. Some of these have stood the test of time and have been 'rediscovered' years later with the development of more sophisticated techniques. He was well-recognised as a horticultural scholar and researcher. His interest was mainly indigenous South African flora and he was generally regarded as an expert on ericas and South African orchids, particularly the genus Disa. He had a vast knowledge of the natural habitat and spent many hours in the veld. His studies and research on the biorhythms of the disa orchid species allowed the successful cultivation of these beautiful orchids in nurseries. These contributions were recorded in excellent articles and chapters in the orchid literature. Following his first publication on disa uniflora in 1980 more than 45 publications followed on various aspects of orchids. His writings showed clear thought and meticulous attention to detail, while he was also an expert photographer of orchids and other flowers and published on that subject. He was a long-time member of the Cape Orchid Society and was a founder member of the Disa Orchid Society of South Africa in 1982. He was the director of the SA Orchid Council from 1989-1993 and its Gold Medal recipient in 2002. The orchid disa vogelpoelii was named after him. The Louis Vogelpoel Travelling Scholarship is awarded in his honour annually which offers an amount of up to R15 000 towards the travel and accommodation costs of a local or international congress by the Cape Western branch of the South African Heart Association in memory of one of South Africa‚Äôs outstanding cardiologists, Dr Louis Vogelpoel.

He led the prosecution of Penguin Books in the obscenity trial in 1960 following the publication of D. H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover. His much quoted remark in his opening statement as to whether the novel was something \\"you would even wish your wife or servants to read\\" is often cited as representing the extent to which the British establishment had fallen out of touch with popular opinion at the time.The Trial of Lady Chatterley, C. H. Rolph, He failed to convince the jury at the Chatterley trial, and the publishers were acquitted. Early life Griffith-Jones was born in Hampstead, London.Births England and Wales 1837-1915 His father, John Stanley Phillips Griffith-Jones (1877/8‚Äì1949), was also a barrister. He was educated at Eton College and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and was called to the Bar at Middle Temple in 1932, specialising in criminal law. He served with the Coldstream Guards during the Second World War, and was awarded the Military Cross in 1943. After the war, he was one of the British prosecuting counsel at the Nuremberg Trials (as Junior Counsel). Post-war legal career He returned to the bar when he left the Army in October 1946 and became a specialist prosecuting counsel. He was counsel for the Crown at the north London quarter sessions from 1946 to 1950, and then at the Central Criminal Court at the Old Bailey from 1950 to 1964. He became senior Treasury counsel in 1959, and became a founder member of the Criminal Law Revision Committee that year. In 1955, he was junior counsel to Christmas Humphreys for the prosecution of Ruth Ellis,Jakubait, Muriel Weller, Monica (2005) \\"Ruth Ellis My Sister's Secret Life,\\" p.206 Constable and Robinson Ltd., London the last woman to be hanged in the UK. He was known for prosecuting obscenity cases. At the 1954 trial of Walter Baxter and Heinemann for publishing Baxter's 1953 novel The Image and the Search, he asked jurors whether they would give the novel as a Christmas present \\"to the girls in the office; and if not, why not?\\", prefiguring the fateful question he posed at the opening of the Chatterley trial in 1960. Baxter and his publisher were acquitted. He led the prosecution of Penguin Books for publishing Lady Chatterley's Lover in paperback format in the obscenity trial held at the Old Bailey from 20 October to 2 November 1960. The book was prosecuted under the Obscene Publications Act 1959, a private members bill introduced by Roy Jenkins, under which a work was considered in its entirety, and had a defence if it was justified by the public good. He asked jurors not to approach the novel \\"in any priggish, high-minded, super-correct mid-Victorian manner\\", but alleged that the novel induced \\"lustful thoughts in the minds of those who read it\\", and then asked, \\"...when you have read it through, would you approve of your young sons, young daughters ‚Äì because girls can read as well as boys ‚Äì reading this book? Is it a book that you would have lying around in your own house? Is it a book that you would even wish your wife or your servants to read?\\" The jury reportedly found this question amusing, and it has been described as the \\"first nail in the prosecution's coffin\\". A procession of eminent defence witnesses attested to the worth of the novel, and Penguin Books was acquitted of obscenity on 2 November.

Tivadar Nach√©z was born in Budapest, where he studied under Sabathiel, the leader of the orchestra of the Budapest Opera. Franz Liszt heard him and gave his approval. Then he studied under Joseph Joachim in Berlin, and afterwards with Hubert L√©onard in Paris. He performed at the foundation of the Bayreuth Festspielhaus. He made a debut in Hamburg in 1881. His first appearance in England was at the Crystal Palace on 9 April 1881, and after that he gave continuous concerts and made tours in England and elsewhere. He performed twice at a private royal smoking concert held at the Queen's Hall before its official opening in 1893. He performed his own 2nd Violin Concerto with the London Philharmonic Orchestra on 17 April 1907, and repeated it with the New Symphony Orchestra under Landon Ronald on 27 January 1910. George Bernard Shaw, writing as an arts critic under the pseudonym Corno di Bassetto, saw him at Her Majesty's Theatre in September 1889: > 'he plays some easy affair like Raff's Cavatina with the air of a man who is > making a masterly conquest of untold difficulties... An encore follows, and > he thereupon plays a bravura piece as fast as he can bow it. He has, of > course, very little time to spend in aiming at the exact pitch of the notes; > but he seems well satisfied when he gets within half a semitone of the > bull's eye. But in my opinion a miss is as good as a mile in this sort of > work...' In July 1890, Shaw heard him play Max Bruch's first concerto and remarked, 'Nachez is one of the most musically intelligent violinists we have, but his technique fails him in rapid and difficult movements.' In June and July 1893, Nach√©z was playing Beethoven and smaller works in St James's Hall. His compositions include: Zigeunert√§nze; Polonaise, Op. 26; Violin concerto in E minor, Op 30; and Passacaglia on a Theme of Sammartini.Naxos He produced new editions of two Vivaldi violin concerti (in A minor and G minor) that are found in the Suzuki violin repertoire.

He was the son of Thierry de Lenoncourt, Seigneur de Vignory, Councillor and Chamberlain of the King, and Jeanne de Ville. He had a brother, Henry, Sire de Lenoncourt and Baron of Vignory, a sister named Jacquette, who married Jean d'Aguerre, son of the Governor of Mouzon (January 1509), and a sister named Nicole, who married √ârard du Ch√¢telet.J.-B.-E. de Jaurgain, \\"Profils Basques: Jean et Claude d'Aguerre,\\" Robert's paternal uncle, also called Robert de Lenoncourt, was Archbishop of Reims. Biography From 1515 to 1536 Robert de Lenoncourt was Prior of the monastery of S. Portianus (Pour√ßain) in the diocese of Clermont.Sainte-Marthe Gallia christiana 2, p. 374. His homonymous uncle had been Prior Commendatory from 1503-1509. In 1523 he was named Abbot of the Abbey of S. R√©mi in Reims. In 1537 he restored the tomb of Saint R√©mi. In 1530 he was named Abbot of the royal abbey of Tournus, making his formal entry on 4 June 1531.Sainte-Marthe, Gallia christiana 9, p. 896. He was also a Protonotary Apostolic and Almoner to the King and Queen of Navarre, Henry II and Marguerite of Angoul√™me, the sister of King Francis I of France. Lenoncourt was Treasurer of the Church of Reims, and held a license in utroque iure (both Civil Law and Canon Law).Gulik and Eubel, p. 158 and note 3. Lenoncourt was apparently Vicar-General of the diocese of Reims, during the episcopacy of Cardinal Jean de Guise-Lorraine (1532-1538). Evenett may not be trustworthy, however. He makes Robert de Lenoncourt to be Bishop of Chalons- sur-Sa√¥ne, when he was actually Bishop of Chalons-sur-Marne, and he gives the date of Robert's accession as 1542, when it was actually 1535. He makes Philippe de Lenoncourt Canon and Treasurer of Reims at this time, while papal documents make it clear that it was Robert de Lenoncourt who was Treasurer of Reims at the time of his elevation to the episcopacy in 1535. =Chalons= Lenoncourt was appointed Bishop of Ch√¢lons by Francis I of France in 1535, an appointment confirmed by Pope Paul III (Farnese) on 10 May 1535.Sainte-Marthe, Gallia christiana 9, pp. 896-897. He resigned the diocese in 1550, in favor of his nephew Philippe, though he continued to be Administrator of the Diocese of Ch√¢lons until Philippe's consecration; as part of the arrangement he retained the use of the house of the Bishops of Ch√¢lons in Paris.Gulik and Eubel, p. 158-159, with n. 4. As Bishop of Ch√¢lons he was present among the Peers of France in the Lit de Justice of 15 January 1536 [1537], against the Emperor Charles V.Ribier, I, p. 3. Sainte-Marthe, Gallia christiana 9, pp. 896. Bishop de Lenoncourt was sent as Ambassador to the Emperor by Francis I, in the matter of the Duchy of Guelders which was a fief of the Holy Roman Empire, but which was in alliance with the French, thanks to a secret treaty of October 1534. The Duke of Guelders (1538-1543), William, Duke of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg, married King Francis' niece, Jeanne d'Albret, in 1541. =Cardinal= Lenoncourt was created a Cardinal Priest in the Consistory of 20 December 1538 by Pope Paul III. He was admitted to Consistory and given his red hat on 19 March 1540, and on 7 October 1540 he was assigned the titulus of Santa Anastasia.Gulik and Eubel, p. 59. On 10 October 1547 he was translated to the titulus of Sant'Apollinare, and on 11 December 1555 to Santa Cecilia in Trastevere. In 1538, Robert de Lenoncourt was named Prior of the Prieur√© de la Charit√©-sur-Loire, which he held until his death. The priory was burned during the Third War of Religion, and the inhabitants scattered. After some disorder, Cardinal Robert was succeeded by his nephew Philippe in 1564. Cardinal de Lenoncourt was granted the Abbey of Saint-Martin de Laon in 1545 and held it until 1548, when he was succeeded by Cardinal Charles de Lorraine. =Metz= Cardinal de Lenoncourt was granted the diocese of Metz on 22 April 1551 by Pope Julius III, in succession to Cardinal Charles de Guise-Lorraine, which he held until December 1555.Gulik and Eubel, p. 242. He was the first bishop of Metz in sixty-seven years to personally take up his charge. With the Treaty of Chambord in 1552, Metz became a part of France and remained so until 1871. King Henri II himself spent three days in Metz, receiving the fealty of his subjects, and then left the Duke de Guise, Fran√ßois de Guise-Lorraine, as his Lieutenant-General.Meurisse, p. 622. In January 1552 Cardinal de Lenoncourt convoked a meeting of the Estates-General of Metz, but his actions appeared to the citizens to be an effort to concentrate all the power in the city in his own hands. Their strong reaction compelled the Cardinal to withdraw the Estates to the town of Vic, just east of Nancy. On 10 April he helped to introduce a French army into Metz.Fisquet, p. 668. He was instrumental in overthrowing the republic which had existed under Charles V in favor of the French, manipulating the elections for the Council by naming candidates and choosing the Ma√Ætre-√âchevin (President) himself. Cardinal de Lenoncourt resumed the coinage of money in Metz, in his own name, in 1553.Meurisse, pp. 624-625. He then sent a memorandum to the King, in which he requested military assistance. The King sent Marshal de Vieilleville to garrison Metz and Vic, and the Marshal quickly took the entire territory under his control. Cardinal Robert lost everything for which he had been working, and went so far as to seek the aid of the Emperor in trying to eject the French garrison from Metz. In 1556 the citizens of Metz petitioned the King of France for relief from their bishop, but Lenoncourt, who had been in Rome for the second Conclave of 1555,He arrived in Rome in the evening of 22 May 1555, too late for the Conclave of April, which had elected Marcello Cervino as Pope Marcellus II. Marcellus II died during the night of April 30/May 1. Lenoncourt did cast his vote in the election of Gian Pietro Carafa, who became Pope Paul IV. See J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante of May 1-May 23 1555. Retrieved: 2016-05-05. had already been transferred to Embrun. It was perhaps the easiest way to solve the political and military problems created by an overzealous supporter of French interests and his own advantage. =Embrun, Auxerre= Lenoncourt was named Archbishop of Embrun by King Henri II of France, the appointment being approved by Pope Paul IV (Carafa) in Consistory on 23 March 1556. He held the post until the King appointed him to the diocese of Auxerre.Gulik and Eubel, p. 190 and 125. Cardinal de Lenoncourt was approved by Pope Paul IV as bishop of Auxerre on 4 October 1556. Possession of the See was carried out by a procurator on 30 October 1556, and he never visited his diocese personally. One of his vicars was his nephew Philippe de Lenoncourt.Gallia christiana 12 (Paris 1770), p. 336. His spiritual functions were carried out by Fr. Philippe Munier, Titular Bishop of Philadelphia In 1557 the Cardinal appointed his nephew, Jean de Lenoncourt, Abbot of Ess√¥mes, to represent him at a meeting of the Estates of Burgundy.Gallia christiana 9, p. 463. Fisquet, p. 669. He was succeeded by his nephew Philippe, who made his solemn entry into Auxerre on 8 December 1560, the splendid details of which were recorded and witnessed by a notary.Gallia christiana 12, Instrumenta, p. 223-225. Philippe was accompanied by his brother Jean, Baron de Vignory. On the nomination of the King, Cardinal de Lenoncourt became Prince and Archbishop of Arles in 1560.Gulik and Eubel, p. 116. His spiritual functions as Archbishop were carried out by his Suffragan and Perpetual Vicar, Pierre de Bisqueriis, Titular Bishop of Nicopolis. He was succeeded by Antoine d'Albon (1561-1562), and then by Cardinal Ippolito d'Este in 1564.Alban√®s and Chevalier, p. 915. On 3 July 1560, the Archbishop, bishop, Provost, Canons and other clergy of the diocese of Arles were accused by the citizens of Arles in the Parliament of Provence of failing, despite more than sufficient revenues assigned for the purpose, to provide preachers for the churches in the diocese on Sundays, Feast Days, Advent and Lent and other major occasions.Gallia christiana novissima: Arles, pp. 913-915. While the new Archbishop had only received his bulls in February, he and his clergy were put on notice that the people were unhappy with the quality of service being provided. Cardinal Robert de Lenoncourt participated in the Conclave of 5 September‚Äì25 December 1559 which resulted in the election of Cardinal Giovanni Angelo de' Medici, who took the throne name of Pope Pius IV. The French candidates, chosen by King Henri and Queen Catherine, were Cardinal Ippolito d'Este, Cardinal Fran√ßois de Tournon, and Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga of Mantua, none of whom was actually papabile.J.

The film is about a college American football star and his woes. The film stars Fred MacMurray, Maureen O'Hara, Natalie Wood, and Betty Lynn. Plot summary State College football coach George Cooper (Fred MacMurray) has more than enough problems on the job without his teenage daughter Connie (Betty Lynn) complicating his life at home. She has written a story but no one has agreed to publish it yet. Furthermore she is convinced that she is unattractive to the opposite sex and wallows in frustrated self-pity. Resigning herself to a loveless existence, she decides to make literature her life. When she gets a check for $180 for a fictional article she pens about a teenage bubble dancer that recently appeared in a confessions magazine, the boys come calling. The young author dates a high school football star from across town who chooses to attend State College (rather than Notre Dame University) to be near his newfound sweetheart. She is the first girl he likes more than football. George's football and domestic problems seem to be solved. His wife Elizabeth (Maureen O'Hara) and housekeeper Geraldine (Thelma Ritter) support the family members in distress, while the younger sister Ellen (Natalie Wood) helps Connie and her father out during this difficult time. In the end she feels much like her sister did in the beginning.

Wine writers differentiate wine tasters from casual enthusiasts; tasters attempt to give an objective description of the wine's taste (often taking a systematic approach to tasting), casual enthusiasts appreciate wine but pause their examination sooner than tasters. The primary source of a person's ability to taste wine is derived from their olfactory senses. A taster's own personal experiences play a significant role in conceptualizing what they are tasting and attaching a description to that perception. The individual nature of tasting means that descriptors may be perceived differently among various tasters.

The geographical area of Mellor Brook is quite small, covering an area of approximately . There is a bakery located in the heart of Mellor Brook. The bakery is well known and successful and started in the village, eventually moving its main operation to nearby Ramsgreave, but still retaining its original village shop. The shop's pies are a favourite of the English fashion designer, Wayne Hemingway. In recent years, both the village's newsagent and post office have closed. In 1808/9, the road (A59) from Mellor Brook to Clitheroe was opened as a toll road hence the position of the toll house at the top of Higher Commons Lane. Preston New Road (A677) between Blackburn and Preston, followed in 1824 and hence Branch Road, getting its name because it joined the two turnpike roads, opened at the same time. The village also has a thriving community centre; it is thought the building came into existence in June 1823, when a plot of land was assigned to a group of gentlemen on which they could build an independent place of worship. The building was purchased by the Church of England in 1833 and it was proposed that it be used during the week as a schoolhouse. The premises became known as St Saviours Chapel, Mellor Brook. The building was used as a primary school right until 1962, after which time the Church allowed it to be sold to the parish councils of the area. In 1966, Mellor Brook Community Centre came into existence, and has been such ever since. The village is adjacent to the former Samlesbury Aerodrome, now under the tenure of BAe. BAe have successfully developed commercial units on the site close the village. A village meeting was held in 2008, with over one hundred attendees, including the sitting MP for the Ribble Valley, Nigel Evans. Evans agreed to return to further address the concerns of the villagers raised following his subsequent meetings with BAe. As of , Evans has failed to return.

She is part of the new diagnostic team assembled by Dr. Gregory House after the disbanding of his previous team in the third-season finale. The character's nickname derives from the episode \\"The Right Stuff\\", when she is assigned the number during a competition for her position at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital. The show depicts Thirteen as a secretive character who does not divulge personal information; her surname was not used on the show until the fourth season's penultimate episode \\"House's Head\\", nor her given name until the fifth-season episode \\"Emancipation\\". Instead, several of the character's traits are implied before they are depicted as true. In the season four episode \\"You Don't Want to Know\\", Thirteen tells House that her mother died from Huntington's disease; a test she performs several episodes later confirms she carries the gene. After hints were given regarding her character's sexuality, actress Olivia Wilde confirmed that her character is indeed bisexual. This is confirmed by Eric Foreman in the episode \\"Don't Ever Change\\". Thirteen was included in AfterEllen.com's Top 50 Lesbian and Bisexual Characters. The character was also listed in Wetpaint's \\"10 Hottest Female Doctors on TV\\" and in BuzzFeed's \\"16 Hottest Doctors On Television\\".  Characterization  Thirteen is reluctant to reveal information about herself and is extremely secretive. During House's new team member election process in the fourth season, she simply lets her fellow applicants refer to her as \\"Thirteen\\" rather than her real name, and constantly deflects curious prodding from both House and Amber Volakis about her personal life and past. Amber admits to feeling threatened by how Thirteen's unusually secretive nature is fascinating to the prying House, who in season seven tells Thirteen she has the best \\"game face\\" he has ever seen. In the episode \\"Lockdown\\" Thirteen spends the episode engaged in a game of truth or dare with James Wilson, but at the end it is implied that everything she has said has been a lie. Although his meddling with her personal affairs and insatiable curiosity frustrates Thirteen, House comes to respect her as a talented doctor and the two build a relationship of mutual trust and understanding of each other's personalities (and, occasionally, shared cynicism and/or sarcasm). Wilson later states that House is better with her on his team, saying \\"He needs someone who doesn't need him. You're the only one he's never really been able to suck into his crazy House vortex. Keeps him grounded, his ego in check.\\" Both Thirteen and House are equally critical and understanding of each other's self-pity and fatalism in the face of miserable circumstances. Although she believes in the importance of hope, Thirteen says in \\"Changes\\" that she believes that people are intrinsically happy or miserable, and that this cannot be changed. House states that this is her defense mechanism, because if she can convince herself that she would have been miserable either way, she does not need to resent the fact that her life is full of misfortune rather than fortune. Thirteen retorts that House's life is similarly miserable and that \\"lotteries are stupid\\". = Huntington's = Thirteen has a 50/50 chance of having inherited Huntington's disease from her mother, but she initially refuses to be tested for it as not knowing allows her to live with hope. It is revealed in the season-four finale that she has the mutation for Huntington's. In the fourth-season finale, Thirteen takes the test and is diagnosed as having the mutated Huntington gene. Shortly after this, she begins to display reckless behavior, having casual sex with random women, using drugs, partying late and showing up at the clinic hungover. In \\"Lucky Thirteen\\", Thirteen says that her Huntington's is more aggressive, greatly decreasing her life expectancy and hastening the onset of symptoms. Initially after being diagnosed, she exhibits sensation seeking: staying out all night, using recreational drugs and having repeated one-night stands with women. She later ceases to behave self-destructively after a near-death experience in the episode \\"Last Resort\\", wherein she realizes her conviction to live, agreeing to participate in a Huntington's disease drug trial and becoming more active in her attempts to prolong her life. Her behavior brings her colleagues to consider her someone who avoids or ignores her own personal problems and pretends that nothing is wrong. She is also shown to hide deep- seated fear; in the episode \\"Mirror Mirror\\", a patient who mimics the personality of whomever he is talking to tells her that he is scared ‚Äì when she assures him that it will be okay, he fearfully tells her that it won't be. = Sexuality = In the episode \\"Don't Ever Change\\", Thirteen's contempt at the idea of being categorized or oversimplified leads to both House and Foreman to assume that she is bisexual, although she is surprised and does not respond to either of their comments. Her sexuality, often the butt of House's jokes and sexual innuendos, remains unclear until the episode \\"Lucky Thirteen\\". She becomes more open and blatant about her sexuality as the series progresses and her relationship with her colleagues grows, going as far to propose the idea that she might drunkenly make out with a stripper in order to gain an invite to Chase's bachelor party. In her game of truth or dare with Wilson, she initially states that her father is supportive of her sexuality, although she later corrects this, saying he is in fact unaware and she never came out to him. She also tells Wilson that she has never been in a threesome. Wilson seems astonished, given Thirteen's promiscuity, and former thrill- seeking behavior. She later states that she may have participated in a foursome, thereby allowing her to truthfully answer \\"no\\", to the question about a threesome. However, at the end of the game, it is implied that nothing she had told him has been truthful, leaving her status with her father a mystery.  Character history  In \\"Lockdown\\", Thirteen says she went to Newton North High School. In \\"Epic Fail\\", Thirteen reveals she attended Sarah Lawrence College. The episode \\"Let Them Eat Cake\\" shows that as a child she resented her mother who was dying from Huntington's and she tells Chase that she knew her father was having an affair; other than this, very little is shown about her past. She appears to be very street smart; she can easily identify a drug dealer and is also able to differentiate between high-purity and low-purity cocaine by the strength of the numbing effect on her gums, as well as identify typical street level drug dealer tactics employed to ensure repeat customers. At the end of the fellowship competition, Lisa Cuddy tells House that, since he already has Eric Foreman on his team, he may only hire two additional people, so House fires Thirteen and Amber, claiming fellow applicants Chris Taub and Lawrence Kutner outperformed her, and that if he could keep Thirteen, he would. Cuddy overrules House's decision, forcing him to accept a woman, realizing only a minute later that this had been House's plan from the start. Several episodes later, Foreman and Thirteen embark on a relationship, which affects Foreman's professional judgment to the extent that he fixes the drug trial, which causes serious side-effects in Thirteen. Foreman almost loses his medical license, resulting in House ordering the couple to either break up or quit. The couple fake a split and continue their relationship in secret, but come public after House discovers they are still seeing each other. Initial relationship strains develop during the episode \\"Simple Explanation (5.20)\\" when Foreman tells Thirteen he needs alone time to grieve and process Kutner's suicide. The conflict is resolved during the funeral when Foreman reaches out for Thirteen's hand, and Thirteen, surprised by the gesture, accepts. When Foreman takes House's position in the sixth season, their relationship becomes strained due to their difficulties balancing their romantic relationship and their new employer-employee status at work. He fires Thirteen in \\"Epic Fail\\" in an attempt to save their relationship, which fails. Thirteen initially breaks up with Foreman, but later decides to try to work things out by agreeing to a dinner with him; when, at dinner, she asks if he would have ever considered stepping down from head of the diagnostics department rather than sacrifice either her career or their relationship and Foreman replies no, she leaves him for good. In the sixth-season episode \\"Instant Karma\\", Thirteen attempts to book a one-way flight to Bangkok, Thailand, citing a need for a vacation. However the tickets are mysteriously cancelled and Thirteen confronts House, Cuddy and Wilson to find out who did it. Wilson confesses to hacking Thirteen's e-mail account but it is later shown that it was really House; he is evasive about whether he did it for his own benefit, Foreman's or Thirteen's, but Wilson surmises that is it simply because he likes having her around and he needs her. Despite his attempts to stop her from leaving, Thirteen is seen eventually boarding a plane. In the episode \\"Teamwork\\", Thirteen has returned from Thailand and House manages to convince her to return to his team along with Chase, Taub, and Foreman. During the season-six finale, \\"Help Me\\", Thirteen shows up late at a differential, obviously hiding something. She leaves a letter on House's desk asking for leave, citing personal reasons; when Taub asks her if everything is okay, she replies \\"obviously not\\". In the season-seven premiere \\"Now What\\", Foreman reads her letter and goes through her locker, finding flight tickets as well as information on an experimental treatment for Huntington's in Rome. With her teammates believing she will be leaving for Rome the following day, Thirteen affirms her friendship with Foreman and Taub tells her he approves of her seeking any chance of getting better. Chase offers her a sexual proposition (in the same way he once did Cameron), but she turns him down and surprises him with a long embrace. The team organize to meet up and have cake to send her off, but Thirteen disappears without saying goodbye. Foreman then discovers that the clues about Rome were purposely planted by Thirteen as a red herring. The team later find that all her phone lines have been disconnected and her apartment has been vacated. Following this, Thirteen remains missing for a year without anyone knowing of her whereabouts. Her vacancy in the team is eventually filled by Dr. Martha Masters. Thirteen returns in the show's 150th episode, \\"The Dig\\", where House meets her upon release from a prison where she has been incarcerated for the last six months for over-prescribing drugs. She has House drive her to a seemingly random house where she rings the bell, then assaults the man who answers the door. The two then spend a few days on the road preparing for a spud-shooting contest while he tries to figure out the real reason she was in prison, eventually deducing that Thirteen helped kill her brother who was suffering from advanced stages of Huntington's. Thirteen eventually admits to House that she did what she had to when her brother's time had come, and that now she is alone and will have nobody there for her when her time comes. House later tells her that he is willing to euthanise her when she needs him to and rehires her onto his team. The rest of the team are excited to see Thirteen again and are curious about where she has been; to her chagrin, House tells the team that she has been in rehab for a substance abuse problem. She later tells Masters, \\"the real reason I was gone is not something I want to share.\\" Upon her return to work, House notices a change in her personality, as she has become more cynical and fatalistic, appearing resigned to misery. He eventually concludes that if she can convince herself that she is naturally miserable as a person, then she does not have to hate the universe for making her miserable. Thirteen then turns around, pointing out that House's life is also miserable, and that \\"We are who we are. Lotteries are stupid.\\" In \\"After Hours\\", a then unknown woman arrives at Thirteen's apartment, with a serious wound in her abdomen. She is revealed to be a cell mate of Thirteen's from prison and makes Thirteen promise that she will not take her to a hospital, as she will be arrested and taken back to prison. Thirteen phones Chase requesting help on false pretenses, bartering on their relationship to convince Chase to bring her medical supplies without explanation. Chase convinces her to let him help, and Thirteen admits to him that she was in prison for killing her brother. After it becomes clear the woman will die without a hospital, Chase engages in a physical confrontation with Thirteen to get the patient to the hospital. He also deduces that her conviction to always keep promises is so that she can blame her brother's death on her promise to him, rather than blame herself. After the two drive the woman to the hospital, she awakes alive but in custody. Thirteen apologizes, but her friend lashes out, claiming she only used Thirteen because she needed someone to talk to in prison. Thirteen later confides in Chase that his theory is right, and that she is afraid she will be consumed by guilt. In \\"Charity Case\\", Thirteen is called in once more by House to help solve a case. Thirteen then decides to join the team once more. In the end, House saw that Thirteen was happy with her girlfriend and fired her once and for all so she can live out her last days being happy. She made her final appearance as one of the speakers at House's funeral in the series finale \\"Everybody Dies\\".  Concept and creation  Along with fellow actors Peter Jacobson (Taub), Kal Penn (Kutner), and Anne Dudek (Amber Volakis), Wilde did not know which character would be cut until the actors were given the scripts. Producers watched to see how the actors developed their characters and interacted. Wilde thought this technique improved the acting during the \\"Games\\" story arc. However, the story arc inspired a spirit of camaraderie between the actors instead of competition, due to the high-profile roles. While Thirteen's name was originally intended to be revealed during the story arc, the production team decided against doing so. Thirteen's actual name was replaced on all documents, including the call sheets, with the word \\"Thirteen\\" to further the in-joke in the show's narrative. Wilde describes her character as a \\"big bowl of secrets\\" in stark comparison to her own openness. Thirteen's sexuality was initially written ambiguously: Foreman and House suggested she is bisexual. In response to the ambiguity, Wilde confirmed in July 2008 that her character is bisexual, the second time she has played a bisexual character (the first being on The O.C. as Alex Kelly). Thirteen has been compared often with Allison Cameron, the previous female diagnostician. Wilde described Thirteen as \\"almost the opposite\\" of Cameron, who is \\"compassionate and emotional\\", and attributed the comparisons to the similarity in the tasks that House delegates to both characters, and that \\"with two girls on a show, people are always going to compare them. Thirteen resists handing her trust to people, and has proven herself to be a rather difficult person.\\" = \\"Thirteen\\" = The name \\"Thirteen\\" comes from the character's introduction: while searching for new team members House assigned all the applicants numbers rather than memorise all their names and persistently used it in reference to her. She did not correct him or offer her real name when prompted by fellow applicants, and the nickname stuck. Although the producers gave the character a full name, and told Wilde what it was, they chose to keep it a secret from the viewers as part of the ongoing relationship between the character and House. Before the character's name was revealed, none of the actors, apart from Wilde herself, knew it. In episode 15 of season four (\\"House's Head\\"), Cuddy refers to her as \\"Dr. Hadley\\". This is the first mention of her actual name. In episode 8 of season five (\\"Emancipation\\"), she reveals she is called Remy. In later season five episodes, the character is occasionally referred to as \\"Dr. Hadley\\" although she is still predominantly called \\"Thirteen\\" by her colleagues. In an interview with The Star-Ledger, producer David Shore commented that he would not be using Thirteen's real name too often, because \\"she will always be Thirteen\\". In the Season 6 episode \\"The Down Low\\", a fake pay stub shows Thirteen's middle name to be \\"Beauregard\\", though it is uncertain if that is actually her middle name.  Actor  Olivia Wilde left the show on October 13, 2011, in order to act in other television shows and films.

It links the Eiffel Tower on the Left Bank to the district of Trocad√©ro on the Right Bank. History In 1807, Napoleon I ordered, by an imperial decree issued in Warsaw, the construction of a bridge overlooking the Military School, and named the bridge after his victory in 1806 at the Battle of Jena, disregarding names considered previously: pont du Champ-de-Mars and pont de l'√âcole militaire. Prussian General Bl√ºcher wanted to destroy the bridge before the Battle of Paris in 1814, as Bl√ºcher had been present for the Prussians' humiliating defeat at Jena, where approximately 28,000 Prussians were killed to France's 2,480, after which Prussia was occupied by France. The Prefect of Paris tried everything to change the mind of Bl√ºcher - without success - and finally went to the wily diplomat Talleyrand, asking him whether he could write a letter to the General asking him not to destroy the bridge. Talleyrand instead approached Tsar Alexander, who was staying with him in Paris. The Tsar was asked to grant to the people of Paris the favour of personally dedicating the bridge under a new name (Pont de l'√âcole militaire). The Tsar accepted, and Bl√ºcher could not then destroy a bridge dedicated by an Ally, and renamed. Later, after the Waterloo Campaign in 1815, the allied armies of Prussia and Great Britain occupied Paris, and the Prussians, again, attempted to destroy the bridge on 9 July 1815. According to Lady Frances Shelley, the Duke of Wellington, who believed that destroying a useful structure such as a bridge, for purely symbolic reasons, was ridiculous, prevented the demolition by posting an English soldier on the bridge, with strict orders not to leave his post. Wellington went in a fury when he discovered that the Prussians continued to place gunpowder under the bridge anyway, even in the presence of English sentries. Fortunately, the Prussian soldiers were not very experienced demolition workers. Wellington snorted afterwards: \\"The Prussians did not know how to handle gunpowder. We, having blown up so many bridges in Spain, would have finished the job in five minutes\\". Instead, the Prussians blew a hole in one of the pillars, but the blast was directed outwards and not inwards, which wounded some of the Prussian soldiers and threw one into the Seine. The demolition work continued until the Prussian king Friedrich Wilhelm III arrived in Paris. He immediately agreed with Wellington that the demolition should be stopped at once, but even that did not deter Bl√ºcher. Het told his king that \\"we need to do this to defend Prussian honour and avenge the desecration of the tomb of Friedrich II by Napoleon's armies.\\" It was not until Czar Alexander intervened on the evening of 10 July 1815 that Bl√ºcher finally backed down. The Napoleonic eagles on the sides of the bridge were not removed and the city council repaired the superficial damage on the bridge quickly at a cost of 12.000 Francs. After the incident, the wronged Prussian general refused to stay in the city and moved his headquarters to Saint-Cloud. There, \\"poor old Bl√ºcher\\" (in the words of Wellington) fell off his horse when he tried to impress a couple of ladies with equitation prowess and lost his mind.Beatrice de Graaf, Tegen de terreur. Hoe Europa veilig werd na Napoleon. Amsterdam, Prometeus (2018), 127-130 Talleyrand later had the bridge reverted to its original name under Louis-Philippe. The Pont d'I√©na at night. The structure was designed with five arches, each with an arc length of 28 m, and four intermediate piers. The initial construction, the cost of which was enormous at the time, was fully financed by the State and spanned six years from 1808 to 1814. The tympana along the sides of the bridge had been originally decorated with imperial eagles conceptualized by Fran√ßois-Fr√©d√©ric Lemot and sculpted by Jean-Fran√ßois Mouret. The eagles were replaced with the royal letter \\"L\\" soon after the fall of the First Empire in 1815 but in 1852, when Napol√©on III ascended the throne of the Second Empire, new imperial eagles, this time by the chisel of Antoine-Louis Barye, replaced the royal \\"L\\". Put in place in 1853, on the two ends of the bridge, are four sculptures sitting on top of four corresponding pylons: a Gallic warrior by Antoine-Augustin Pr√©ault and a Roman warrior by Louis-Joseph Daumas by the Right Bank; an Arab warrior by Jean-Jacques Feuch√®re and a Greek warrior by Fran√ßois Devault by the Left Bank. Towards the second half of the 19th century, the inadequacy of the bridge's carrying capacity started to become a pronounced problem. With the increasing traffic resulting from the expansion of the districts of Trocad√©ro, Auteuil and Passy, the necessity to enlarge the structure (the width of which was no more than 14 m, including the pavements) in a durable fashion grew as time went on. Not until 1937, with the prospect of the upcoming World Fair drawing closer, did the French government decide to execute the project, which was all the more necessary as the structure was starting to show sure signs of deterioration. As well as the widening operation, reduced to just 35 meters from the planned 40 meters, the project also transformed the bridge with two additional concrete elements placed at either end, joining to the existing bridge with metal girders. Stone facings were used to protect the concrete tympana, the imperial eagles put back in place and the four statues repositioned accordingly during the bridge expansion. This bridge has been part of the supplementary registry of historic monuments since 1975. The steps leading off the bridge are popularly known among film fans as the \\"Renault stairs\\", as they featured in a scene in A View to a Kill where James Bond (played by Roger Moore) drove a hijacked Renault 11 taxi down the steps in pursuit of an assassin later revealed to be May Day (Grace Jones).

The official announcement did not state the terms of this deal: various unsourced media reports speculated that he paid anything between 20 pence and 100 pence in the pound, without giving sources.Norwich Union severs Ipswich Town links, eveningnews24.co.uk, 1 November 2007. He injected ¬£12 million into the club in exchange for an issue of new shares, which gave him an 87.5% stake, and reduced the existing shareholders stake to 12.5%. The deal was finalised following an EGM on 17 December 2007, at which the proposal was backed by shareholders speaking for 98.9% of the stock. When owner Marcus Evans took over the club in 2007, the club were ¬£32m in debt ‚Äìunder Evan‚Äôs ownership, this figure has more than doubled (and looks set to increase further in the next accounts). Ipswich Town pays Marcus Evans around 5.4% interest on the debt. Club accounts in 2012 showed that ¬£67m debt is owed to Evans and he has not converted any of it to equity. After 11 years of Marcus Evans ownership the club finished bottom of the Championship in 2019 and were relegated to League One, the third tier of English football for the first time since 1957. Following relegation the club's debt, which is owed exclusively to Evans, rose from ¬£95.5m to ¬£96.3m. https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47835896 https://www.eadt.co.uk/sport/itfc-reveal-2018-19-accounts-1-6428196 Marcus Evans Group Marcus Evans Group was founded in 1983, employs over 3000 staff and has around 56 offices globally.

Career Schlattman started his career in photography, shooting black-and-white photographs and printing mural size prints, and large-scale color photographs of particular beauty with an interest in experimentation and movement. After exhibiting in numerous group and one-person shows, he was picked up by the Susan Spiritus Gallery in Newport, California with a body of work depicting pseudoscientific experiments full of humor, intelligence, and a sort of political whimsy. Throughout his still photo career, Schlattman was producing [avant-garde], experimental films that were earning him a reputation in the art film world. The short subjects Slap and Bag, both funny, brutal, and formalist in context, won Directors Awards at the Sinking Creek Film Festival (now known as the Nashville Independent Film Festival), and traveled all over the world in many film programs and festivals, including a traveling show with Stan Brakhage, and Michael Snow, and screenings at the Museum of Modern Art. Schlattman called Submitting (produced by Rutger Hauer) \\"the worst film I've ever made\\", but it nonetheless went on to win a Silver award at the WorldFest-Houston International Film Festiva, a Bronze Award at the Athens International Film Festival, and a Certificate of Merit from the Chicago International Film Festival, which were the only festivals entered. Heroic and Furious, two hard to get documentaries about filmmaking behind the scenes of big Hollywood productions, have been shown at the Ann Arbor and Wiesbaden Film Festivals, and have the reputation of being very unconventional films in cin√©ma v√©rit√© or direct cinema style, which is not what the studios would like to have seen about their films, hence the problem in showing and purchasing them. Very much a part of the resurgence of independent filmmaking in the early 1990s, Schlattman said that he waited a couple of years with a feature script he wanted to shoot before running into two actors he thought perfect for the part; Thomas Jane, and Aysha Hauer. Schlattman met them through a mutual acquaintance shooting something for a new director and thought they were perfect for the parts of Thomas Pennington and Aysha Almouth in his first feature, At Ground Zero. He picked for his subject marginal characters tied together by love and drugs in an extended traveling family on the road. At Ground Zero premiered at the Rotterdam International Film Festival to enthusiastic, full houses, and went on an extensive festival run in the US and Europe. > \\"An impressive debut. With dark, dead-pan humor, experimental visual > techniques and solid performances, At Ground Zero is a promising first > feature.\\" > Jamie Painter - Film Threat. > > \\"Powerful and distinctive.

I loved working with them and I'm sure they will go on to great things.\\" After making the festival circuit, At Ground Zero had a small theatrical release and Schlattman started his second feature, The Seller. A difficult story about marginal characters, The Seller opened at The Chicago Underground Film Festival to reviews of; > \\"An astonishing fusion of stark landscape cinematography and wildly > compelling close-ups, especially of Brophy as he delivers hypnotic > monologues that seem to be about everything and nothing at once and that lay > bare his character's internal processes without demystifying them. > Schlattman rarefied emotion instead of breaking it down - his characters are > indelible because they retain their mystery even as they let you inside.\\" > Lisa Alspector - Chicago Reader. > and: > \\"The festival's most gratifying find could be The Seller which deserves a > much larger audience.

He said \\"I couldn't get past an agent on the freeway with my scripts - no big stunts, no nudity, just difficult compelling characters. Fat chance you get financing without Nick Cage signed on.\\" He then went on to make Asymmetry, an extremely difficult film praised by those that have seen it, but ignored by the distributors. Before illness occupied his time, Schlattman was seeking financing for a new film about family tragedy and insanity. He was a 2008 recipient of the prestigious Bush Fellowship and was in pre-production on 2 new feature films at the time of his death. Other work Schlattman taught classes on filmmaking to college students for several years.

While the stories told in each book are generally comparable, there are also some notable differences. Knowing that versions written in the Hebrew Bible and the Christian New Testament predate the Quran's versions, Christians reason the Quran's versions as being derived directly or indirectly from the earlier materials. Muslims understand the Quran's versions to be knowledge from an omnipotent God. As such, Muslims generally hold that the earlier versions are distorted through flawed processes of transmission and interpretation over time, and consider the Quran's version to be more accurate. Often, stories related in the Quran tend to concentrate on the moral or spiritual significance of events rather than the details.e.g. Gerald Hawting, interviewed for The Religion Report, Radio National (Australia), 26 June 2002. Biblical stories come from diverse sources and authors, so their attention to detail varies individually. Torah narratives =Adam and Eve= The Quran usually mentions God creating Adam from \\"earth\\" or \\"clay\\" (, although one verse suggests \\"dust\\" or \\"dirt\\" (). God is said to breath his spirit into Adam as in the Genesis creation narrative, and also to have created him simply by saying \\"Be\\". The Quran then depicts the angels as doubting the creation of Adam, a detail not found in the Genesis accounts: > When your Lord said to the angels, \\"I am indeed going to set a viceroy on > the earth,\\" they said, \\"Will You set in it someone who will cause corruption > in it and shed blood, while we celebrate Your praise and proclaim Your > sanctity?\\" He said, \\"Indeed, I know what you do not know.\\" While not found in Genesis, the Quranic account is linked to a Jewish exegesis of Psalm 8, which wonders why God cares for human beings despite their cosmic insignificance. Some Jewish interpreters have understood the question as one being asked by the angels when God created Adam. This led to a tradition in the Babylonian Talmud in which the angels object to the evils that humans will commit in the future, which may be the source of the Quranic narrative. The Quranic narrative continues that God \\"taught Adam the Names, all of them,\\" and that Adam presented the names to the angels, whereas Genesis has Adam himself naming the animals. The difference highlights the Quranic emphasis on both God's absolute knowledge, and the superiority of humanity to the angels implied earlier. God then commands the angels to bow down to Adam, but Iblis refuses, saying that he is better than Adam because he was created from fire and Adam from clay. The submission of the angels to Adam is another detail not mentioned in Genesis but important in Syriac Christian texts such as the Cave of Treasures, where it reflects a Christian notion of Adam as being a primordial analogue of Jesus. Satan's refusal to bow is another popular extra- Biblical Christian tradition of Late Antiquity which was integrated into the Quran. Indeed, in the Cave of Treasures, Satan refuses God's order to bow before Adam \\"since I am fire and spirit, not that I worship something that is made of dirt\\", using almost the same words as in the Quran. The creation of Eve is not specified in the Quran, but several verses imply the traditional Genesis account by stating that God \\"created you [humanity] from a single soul, and created its mate from it\\". In the Quran, God then tells Adam and his unnamed wife to live in paradise but not to approach a certain tree, which Satan calls the \\"tree of immortality\\", whereas Genesis refers to two trees, a tree of the knowledge of good and evil which Adam and Eve must not eat from, and another tree of life. This appears to reflect Syrian Christian exegesis, in which the two trees were considered identical. The Quran continues with Satan himself tricking Adam and Eve into approaching the tree, a progression of the Christian notion in which the Serpent becomes an incarnation of Satan, a link not traditionally made in Judaism. Satan tells Adam and Eve that they will become immortal by approaching the tree, but when they do, \\"their nakedness [becomes] apparent to them.\\" All three are then expelled from Paradise. There is no mention in the Quran of Eve tempting Adam. While Genesis states that Adam and Eve \\"realized\\"Genesis that they were naked, the Quran is more ambiguous, referring to Satan's desire to \\"expose to them what was hidden from them of their nakedness\\". This may reflect Syriac Christian traditions in which Adam and Eve were thought to be clothed with \\"glory\\" before eating from the tree, at which point they became naked instead of merely realizing their prior nakedness. According to the Quranic narrative, Adam is then forgiven by God after \\"receiving certain words from his Lord\\". While this is another detail not explicitly mentioned in Genesis, the Quranic episode again has a parallel in the Cave of Treasures, in which God comforts Adam and says that he has \\"preserved him from the curse\\" of the land, and from the pre-Islamic apocrypha Life of Adam and Eve, in which God promises Adam that he will eventually return to paradise. =Sons of Adam= A depiction of Cain burying Abel from an illuminated manuscript version of Stories of the Prophets In the Bible, Adam and Eve have two sons: the elder Cain, who is a farmer, and the younger Abel, a shepherd. When both make sacrifices to God, God only accepts Abel's offerings. Angered, Cain kills his brother despite God's warning. He is condemned to a lifetime of wandering and fruitless toil. The Qur'an narrates a similar story relating to the sons of Adam, although the brothers are not named. However, a significant difference between the two versions is that while God speaks to Cain in the Bible, the brother who is accepted by God speaks to the rejected one in the Quran, saying: > God accepts only from the God-wary. Even if you extend your hand toward me > to kill me, I will not extend my hand toward you to kill you. Indeed, I fear > God, the Lord of all the worlds. I desire that you earn [the burden of] my > sin and your sin, to become one of the inmates of the Fire, and such is the > requital of the wrongdoers. A conversation between Cain and Abel is attested in one Syriac source, although this version differs significantly from the Quran in that Abel begs his brother not to kill him. A conversation between the brothers before the murder is also found in the Targum Neofiti, an Aramaic-language Jewish annotation of the Torah. The rejected brother then kills the younger brother, as Cain does to Abel. In the Quran, God then sends a crow to dig the earth in which to bury the murdered brother, and the murderer regrets his deed as he looks upon the crow. While a bird digging the earth for Abel is a motif that appears in certain late extra-biblical Christian and Jewish sources, such as the Tanhuma, the Quran is the earliest known version of the episode and may be the source of the other attestations. The Quran then draws a lesson from the murder, not found in the text of the Torah: > That is why We decreed for the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul, > without [its being guilty of] manslaughter or corruption on the earth, is as > though he had killed all mankind, and whoever saves a life is as though he > had saved all mankind. This verse is nearly identical to a passage in the Mishnah Sanhedrin tractate, part of the Jewish Oral Torah, which also concludes that the lesson of the murder of Abel is that \\"whosoever destroys a single soul is regarded as though he destroyed a complete world, and whosoever saves a single soul is regarded as though he saved a complete world\\". =Noah (N≈´·∏•)= In both the Bible and the Quran, Noah is described as a righteous man who lived among a sinful people, who God destroyed with a flood while saving Noah, his family, and the animals by commanding him to build an Ark and store the animals in them. In both sacred books, he is said to have lived for 950 years. But unlike in Genesis, which records not a single word from Noah before he leaves the Ark, the Quranic story of the prophet focuses less on the details of the flood and more on Noah's unsuccessful attempts to warn his people, directly quoting his attempts to persuade his wicked countrymen to turn to righteousness. This emphasis on Noah as a preacher vainly attempting to save others, while not found in the Torah itself, appears in Christian sources as early as the Second Epistle of Peter and was present in Jewish and Christian sources of Late Antiquity, including the Talmud. In the context of the Quran, it emphasizes the crucial notion that Noah and other Biblical figures were prototypes of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, all preaching righteousness to save their people from doom. Unlike the Bible, one Quranic verse implies that Noah's people rejected not only Noah but multiple prophets who warned them. The Bible and the Quran also diverge on the fate of Noah's family. In the Bible, all of Noah's immediate family is saved, including his three sons. But the Quran mentions a son of Noah who rejects the Ark, instead choosing to take refuge on a mountain where he is drowned. Noah asks God to save his son, but God refuses. This buttresses the recurrent Quranic emphasis on the importance of faith and righteous conduct over ties of family. The episode may also be connected to a passage in the Book of Ezekiel, which similarly stresses righteousness over blood ties by stating that \\"even if Noah and Daniel and Job were living there [in a sinful country]... they would be able to save neither son nor daughter, only themselves by their uprightness\\".Ezekiel But while the son of Noah who would not be saved is only hypothetical in Ezekiel, he is a real son in the Quran, traditionally identified (though not by the Quran itself) with the Biblical figure of Canaan. The Quran also cites Noah's wife as \\"an example of the faithless\\" who was doomed to hellfire without further elaboration, although some Islamic exegetical traditions hold that she would call Noah a madman and was subsequently drowned in the flood. No similar reference exists in the Bible, although certain Gnostic legends entailed a hostile portrayal of Noah's wife. In the Quran, the Ark is said to rest on the hills of Mount Judi (Hud ); in the Bible, it is said to rest on the mountains of Ararat (Gen. ) The Al-Djoudi (Judi) is apparently a mountain in the biblical mountain range of Ararat. The Quran cites a particular mount in the Ararat Range, whereas the Bible just mentions the Ararat Range by name. There is a Mount Al-Djoudi in the present-day Ararat mountain range in Turkey. =Abraham (IbrƒÅhƒ´m)= Promised a son See Genesis , and Hud , Al-Hijr , As-Saaffat , and Adh-Dhariyat . Several messengers come to Abraham on their way to destroy the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham welcomes them into his tent and provides them with food. They then promise their host that Isaac ( æIs·∏•ƒÅq ÿ•ÿ≥ÿ≠Ÿ∞ŸÇ) will soon be born to Abraham's wife, Sarah (SƒÅrah ÿ≥ÿßÿ±ÿ©). Sarah laughs at the idea because she is far too old to bear children. The Hebrew name ◊ô◊¶◊ó◊ß means 'he laughs\\" and is one of the literary tropes in the biblical story. These literary connections are typically lost in Quranic versions of biblical stories. :Genesis \\"After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?\\" :Hud The angels rebuke her, telling her that by God's will she can bear a son. A conversation ensues in which Abraham admits that he wished God to have mercy on the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. Sacrifices his son In another narrative, Abraham receives a command (in his dream) from God to sacrifice his son. Abraham agrees to this and prepares to carry out the sacrifice. Before he can do so, however, God tells him to stop and gives him a replacement sacrifice. Abraham is subsequently honoured for his faithfulness to God. (As-Saaffat ; Genesis ) However, there are several differences between the biblical and Quranic accounts: *In Genesis, the sacrificial son is Isaac, whereas in the Quran name of the son is Ishmael (Arabic: ÿßÿ≥ŸÖÿßÿπŸäŸÑ) . *While God seems to speak directly to Abraham in Genesis, He speaks through a vision in the Quran. =Abraham's Journeys in the Bible and Quran= The Bible describes Abraham as in Iraq-Syria, then in Canaan, Paran, and Egypt, with his final days in Canaan and Hebron. Both Isaac and Ishmael attend Abraham's funeral. The Quran mentions that Abraham left his wife and Ishmael (as an infant) in the land where present-day Mecca is, while he left to what was apparently Palestine. =Lot and Sodom and Gomorrah (L≈´·π≠ and \\"The People of Lot\\")= According to the Bible in the Book of Genesis, after visiting Abraham, two angels go to the city of Sodom in which Abraham's nephew Lot is a foreigner. They tell him God will soon destroy the city because of the wickedness of the people. The men of the city, upon hearing that Lot is entertaining male visitors, converge upon his house and demand that the men be brought out so that they can have sex with them. Lot offers his daughters in their place, but the men insist upon raping the angels instead. After blinding the city's inhabitants, the angels tell Lot and his family to flee by night and to not look back. The following morning, God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah with a shower of fiery stones from the sky. Lot's wife looked back to see the burning city and was turned into a pillar of salt. The story continues further after the destruction of the twin cities, with Lot leaving Zoar (where he had fled for refuge) with his two daughters to live in a cave. Fearing that all the men were dead, the daughters decided that in order to 'preserve the seed of their father' and procreate, they must have sexual intercourse with him; they decide to get him into a drunken stupor so as to be able to 'lie with him' and obtain his seed. And so they each sleep with their father (one each on successive nights), having intoxicated him to a point wherein he could 'perceive not', and thus get impregnated by him. The Bible then continues \\"And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day. And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day\\". The biblical story of Lot ends here. According to the Quran, Lot (or Lut, as he is called in the Quran) was a Prophet. He was also a nephew of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham). A group of angels visited Ibrahim as guests and gave him glad tidings of a son \\"endowed with wisdom\\"; they told him that they had been sent by God to the \\"guilty people\\" of Sodom, to destroy them with \\"a shower of stones of clay (brimstone)\\" and deliver Lot and those who believed in him. However, Lot's wife was specifically excluded, with the angels saying \\"she is of those who lag behind\\". The Quran draws upon Lot's wife as an \\"example for the unbelievers\\", as she was married to a righteous man but refused to believe in his words; hence, she was condemned to the Hellfire; otherwise, the story of them leaving the city proceeds much as in the Bible. The story of Lot in the Quran ends after describing the destruction of the city. There are several differences between the Quran and the Bible: *In the Quran, Lot is described as a prophet, like his uncle Abraham. In Genesis (), Lot is not described as a prophet. In the New Testament, () Peter the Apostle describes Lot as a righteous man who was daily tormented by the lawless deeds he saw in Sodom. *In both the Bible and in the Quran, Abraham pleads for God to have mercy (Quran; Gen. 18:24‚Äì33). *In Genesis, Lot's wife leaves with Lot but turns around briefly and God turns her into a pillar of salt (). In the Quran, there is no mention of her leaving; rather Lot and his followers were commanded by the angels not to turn, but Lot is informed that his wife will turn and look behind (Quran Hud 11:123), and thus be destroyed with the rest of the two cities. *Following the destruction of Sodom, the Bible describes an incestous event between Lot and his two daughters, at his daughters' behest, in . The Quran does not describe any such event. (See Also: Bible: . Quran: Surah Al-Hijr 57‚Äì77, Surah Hud 74‚Äì83, Surah Al-A'raf 80‚Äì84, Surah Ash-Shu'ara 160‚Äì174, Surah An-Naml 54‚Äì58, Surah Al-Ankabut 28‚Äì35, Surah As-Saaffat 133‚Äì138, Surah Adh-Dhariyat 31‚Äì37, and Surah Al-Qamar 36‚Äì39.) =Joseph (Y≈´suf)= The narratives of Joseph can be found in and in the first 102 verses of Surah Yusuf (Joseph) (Quran 12:1-102) In both the Bible and the Quran, Joseph has a vision of eleven stars and the sun and the moon all bowing to him which he shares with his family. () And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brothers, and said, \\"Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.\\" (Yusuf12.4) Behold! Joseph said to his father: \\"O my father! I did see eleven stars and the sun and the moon: I saw them prostrate themselves to me!\\" Joseph's brothers became jealous that their father preferred Joseph over them, and so they form a plot to kill Joseph. However, one brother convinces them not to kill him but throw him down a well while they are alone. The brothers come to the father asking his permission to take Joseph out with them to enjoy and play with them. Jacob expresses his reservations against letting him go with them and expressing fear about a wild animal killing him while they were not careful about him. The sons assure the father of their being a mighty group against any threats to Joseph. The father eventually agrees to send Yusuf with them (in the Quran), while in the Bible, Jacob sends Joseph out of his own accord without sons trying to persuade him to let him go with them. (Yusuf12.8‚Äì10; ) They agree. They subsequently lie to their father as to Joseph's whereabouts, covering his clothing in blood and asserting that a wild animal had attacked him. A caravan passing the well inspires the brothers to pull Joseph out of the well and to sell him as a slave to traders in the caravan. Later the traders sell him to a wealthy Egyptian. (; Yusuf12.20‚Äì22) Joseph grows up in the house of the Egyptian. When Joseph is a grown man, his master's wife tries to seduce him. Joseph resists and runs away, but is caught by other servants and reported to his master. The wife lies to her husband, saying that Joseph tried to rape her. (Yusuf12.25; ); At this point, the two stories differ. In the Bible, Joseph's master (named as Potiphar) refuses to believe Joseph's denial and imprisons him. In the Quran, Joseph's master (who is only identified as \\"the Vizier\\") accepts the suggestion of another wise person to check Joseph's tunic. If it is torn from the front, the wise person asserts, it will prove Joseph a liar; but if it is torn from the back (as proves to be the case), Joseph will be vindicated and the master's wife proven a liar and an adulteress. The Vizier reprimands his wife and permits Joseph to remain in his household. The Vizier's wife hosts a banquet for women who had been gossiping about her and Joseph providing them with knives; Joseph is commanded to appear before the wife and her ladyfriends; they cut their hands with knives. (The bible does not mention the banquet), a \\"post-Biblical Jewish tradition\\" describes Potiphar serving fruit to the gossips who cut themselves inadvertently, distracted by Joseph's good looks.) Although the Vizier again recognizes Joseph's innocence, he orders him imprisoned nevertheless. In prison, Joseph meets two men. One has a dream of making wine and the other dreams of carrying a stack of bread that birds are eating. Joseph tells the first that he will serve the Pharaoh again and the second will be executed. Both things happen, precisely as Joseph foretold. Although Joseph asks the first man to bring his name and unjust imprisonment to the attention of the Pharaoh, (referred to in the Quran as only the King, not a Pharaoh) the first man quickly forgets about him once restored to the royal favour. Sometime thereafter, Pharaoh had a dream: () \\"17. Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, \\"In my dream, I was standing on the bank of the Nile, 18.when out of the river there came up seven cows, fat and sleek, and they grazed among the reeds. 19. After them, seven other cows came up ‚Äì scrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows in all the Land of Egypt. 20. The lean, ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first. 21. But even after they ate them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before. Then I woke up.\\" 22.\\" In my dreams I also saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk. 23. After them, seven other heads sprouted ‚Äì withered and thin and scorched by the east wind. 24. The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but none could explain it to me.\\" (Quran: Yusuf12.43) The king (of Egypt) said: \\"I do see (in a vision) seven fat kine, whom seven lean ones devour, and seven green ears of corn and seven (others) withered. O ye chiefs! Expound to me my vision if it be that ye can interpret visions.\\" Pharaoh's cupbearer, who had been previously imprisoned with Joseph, suddenly remembers his promise and tells Pharaoh about the man who foretold his own restoration to favour. Pharaoh sent to the prison, asking Joseph to interpret his dream. In the Quranic account, Joseph insists that the Vizier's wife vindicate him before the king before Joseph will agree to do so (this is not mentioned in the Bible); Pharaoh summons the Vizier's wife, who admits her lies about Joseph and proclaims his innocence. The Quran now rejoins the biblical narrative, where Joseph reveals the meaning of the king's dream: Egypt will have seven years of good crops followed by seven years of famine and the famine will be worse than the abundance. The king rewarded Joseph by giving him charge over the storehouses and the entire land of Egypt. During the famine, Joseph's brothers came to Egypt to buy food, but the youngest was left with their father. While Joseph recognized them, they did not recognize him. He demanded that they return with the missing brother. The brothers return home and find that Joseph had hidden in their packs more than they paid for. They asked their father if they might return with the youngest brother. Reluctantly, their father allows this. They return, and after some further incidents, Joseph ultimately reveals himself to his brothers. (; Yusuf 12.90). In both the Quran and the Bible, the missing brother is Benjamin, (Arabic: ÿ®ŸÜ ŸäÿßŸÖŸäŸÜ) Joseph's only full blood brother. The others are half-brothers. The Qur'an correctly does not refer to the king of Egypt during Joseph's time as the \\"Pharaoh.\\" The titular word \\"Pharaoh\\" was given to the kings of Egypt during the New Kingdom period later historically. This distinction is not found in the Bible. =Moses (M≈´sƒÅ)= In the Bible, the narratives of Moses are in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The narratives here are mostly in and . In the Quran, the Moses narratives are in the following passages: 2.49‚Äì61, 7.103‚Äì160, 10.75‚Äì93, 17.101‚Äì104, 20.9‚Äì97, 26.10‚Äì66, 27.7‚Äì14, 28.3‚Äì46, 40.23‚Äì30, 43.46‚Äì55, 44.17‚Äì31, and 79.15‚Äì25. Pharaoh slew the young male children of the Israelites (II:46), and to avoid this fate, Moses' mother cast Moses as an infant into a small ark, where God protected him. Moses was found by the household of the Pharaoh, who adopted him. Moses' sister, Miriam, had followed Moses, and she recommended that his own mother serves as a nurse to him. When Moses became an adult, he saw an Egyptian fighting with an Israelite, and he interceded and killed the Egyptian. The next day, the Israelite asked whether Moses intended to kill him as well. The Pharaoh tried to have Moses killed and Moses fled to a watering place in Midian. He met some sisters and watered their herd. When the women's father, Jethro, learned of Moses, he invited him to stay and gave him a daughter, Zipporah, to marry. In Midian, Moses saw a fire and approached it. God spoke to him and told him to remove his shoes. God said that he had chosen Moses. God said to throw down his staff and to stretch out his arm as signs. His staff turned into a serpent and then returned to the form of a staff. His arm became white although he was not sick. God commanded him to go to Pharaoh to deliver a message. Moses said that he could not speak well. So God provided Aaron, his brother, to help Moses speak. God sent Moses to the court of Pharaoh. Pharaoh refused to listen to Moses. In response, Moses threw down his staff and it became a serpent. This prompted Pharaoh's magicians also threw down their staffs, which also turned into snakes. But the snakes of Pharaoh's magicians were swallowed by Moses' serpent. God caused a famine. God sent plagues of locusts, frogs, blood, and destruction. God sent at least nine signs to Pharaoh, but Pharaoh ignored these signs. When he could ignore them no longer, he agreed to let the Israelites go. However, after God had allowed tranquility, Pharaoh went back on his word and refused to let the Israelites go. As punishment, God made every first-born Egyptian son die and spared every Israelite (the first Passover). Pharaoh became hysterical and demanded that Moses and the Israelites leave at once- only to pursue them with his army after their exit. Then God helped Moses lead the Israelites into a desert and across a sea. Moses struck the sea with his staff and the sea split in half exposing dry land (while creating a wall of water on each side) for the Israelites to walk through. Pharaoh and his army were catching up to the Israelites but the water returned to its original state. Pharaoh and his army drowned. (, II:47) Moses left the Hebrews for forty nights. He put his brother Aaron in charge of the people (Al-Baqara2.48) On a mountain, God gave Moses a revelation of precepts for Israel to follow. God made tablets with writing on them which Moses carried back to Israel. Moses asked to see God. The people saw the fire and lightning and the mountain and were afraid. While Moses was gone, the Israelites demanded to worship an idol. They used the gold from their ornaments to construct a golden calf whom they said was the god who rescued them from Egypt. Aaron does not stop them. Then Moses returned and chastised them and Aaron. Many were killed for their actions. God sent down manna and quail to eat but the Hebrews still rebelled against God, and complained about the food. Moses asked God for water and God answered him. Moses struck a stone with his staff and water came forth. The Israelites were divided into twelve tribes. God gave the Israelites a bountiful land, but this occurred at different times in the two scriptures. Besides that and the many additional details in the Torah, there are other differences: *The biblical Moses is reluctant to become a prophet and makes excuses. He eventually agrees and Aaron speaks and performs miracles at first until Moses is ready and takes over. In the Quran, Aaron was made God's messenger on Moses' request to back him up in the difficult task. Moses asked God to give him human support from his family, then asks for Aaron (his brother) praising Aaron by saying that he (Aaron) is a better speaker than him (Moses). *The sorcerers, in the Quranic story, repent after seeing Moses' signs and submit to God at the anger of Pharaoh. *In the Quran, Pharaoh didn't repent but tried to deceive Moses and God by saying that now he believes in one God, the God of Moses and Aaron (while drowning). *In the Bible, Moses first goes to Pharaoh without showing any signs. *In Exodus, Aaron helps make the golden calf. In the Quran, Aaron himself was a messenger of God and was representing Moses in his absences. He opposed that idea with all his might and warned the Israelites that God will be angry with them. In the Quran, a person named Samiri (not to be confused with Samaritans) leads the Israelites to worship the golden calf. *In the Quran, Pharaoh drowned, but God said in the Quran that he preserved the pharaoh's body as an example for generations to come (or made an example for coming generations) See also Aaron, Islamic view of Aaron, and Islamic view of Pharaoh. =Destruction of Korah= The story of the destruction of Korah appears in in the Torah and in Al-Qasas 76‚Äì82 in the Quran. Korah was an Israelite living during the time of Moses. Because of his wickedness, God caused him to die by opening the ground and swallowing him and his home (; Al- Qasas28.81). In the Quran, Karon is simply a rich man who is too arrogant. In the Torah, he leads a minor rebellion against Moses. God also kills the others who rebel with him and destroys their homes. Later Hebrew Bible narratives =Gideon/Talut= In the Quran and the Bible, there are stories about smaller armies winning victory over larger ones. One story in the Quran and the Bible share strong resemblances, although they are placed at different times and attributed to different characters. The Bible story features Gideon from the Book of Judges and the Quran story features Talut (usually translated as Saul). In the Book of Judges of the Bible, Gideon receives commands from God to take the Israelites to war against the Midianites. Gideon is reluctant, but accedes after making God prove Himself with three different tests. As they are heading to fight, God tells Gideon to send away those who are homesick or afraid of dying. Because the army is still large enough to credit its own strength for victory, God tells Gideon to observe the drinking habits of his troops at the river. God says to send those who do not drink with their hands, but lap the water directly like a dog, back to their homes. The remaining Israelites go on to victory. In 2:246-248 of the Quran, God chooses Talut (generally considered to be Saul) to lead the Israelites into battle against the army of Goliath. On their way, God tells Talut to warn the men that they will be tested by God, and that they must not drink from the next river in order to pass the test. Despite this warning, most of the men disobey and drink from the river. God tells Talut to leave the disobedient members behind, unless they only drank one handful so that the army will consist of only faithful members. The army then goes on to defeat General Goliath's army. =Saul, David and Goliath (TƒÅl≈´t, DƒÅw≈´d and Jalut)= The story appears in 1 Samuel and . The Prophet Samuel is petitioned by the Israelites for a king. God sends Samuel to appoint Saul as the king, although with the warning that kings only take from their people. At least a few people are not happy with Samuel's choice, but Saul then prophecizes and wins some victories, so the people embrace him. Later Saul falls out of God's favour and God promises to appoint someone else as king. The Philistines attack and are bolstered by the fear engendered by their champion Goliath, a giant. God sends Samuel to recruit David, who kills Goliath. David eventually goes on to become Israel's new king. A similar story appears in the Qu'ran 2:246‚Äì251. The Israelites demand of their prophet to appoint a king, and so God appoints the man Talut. The people respond poorly to the selection, upset that Talut does not seem special. God gives the Ark of the Covenant back to the Israelites in order to verify His choice (this is an event that predates Saul in the Bible). Talut leads the men to battle against an army led by the General Goliath. The Israelite army is small and doubtful, but a few men trust that God can still give them victory. David then kills Goliath and becomes king of Israel. The account also bears similarity to when Gideon led an army. See the above Gideon/Talut subsection. =The Queen of Sheba= The story appears in and and in verses Surah 27 20‚Äì44. The two stories have almost nothing in common. In each, the Queen of Sheba comes to visit Solomon and is impressed by his wisdom and riches. In the Bible, the visit is only diplomatic. In the Quran, the Queen becomes monotheist and peace is established in the kingdoms. Although not part of the Quran, Islamic tradition holds that the name of the Queen of Sheba is Bilqis or Balqis. =Jonah (Yunus) and the big fish= In both the Bible and the Quran, Jonah is swallowed by a \\"big fish\\", usually inferred to be a whale. The Book of Jonah in the Bible consists of four chapters about Jonah's mission to Nineveh. Jonah is referenced three times in the Quran: in verses 139‚Äì148 of Sura 37 (As-Saaffat) (Those who set the ranks), verses 87‚Äì88 of Sura 21: al-Anbiya' (The Prophets) and verses 48‚Äì50 of Sura 68: al-Qalam (The Pen)/Nun. It is mentioned in verse 98 of Sura 10: Yunus (Jonah) and verse 86 of Sura 6: al-An'am (The Cattle). In the Quran, Jonah gets frustrated by his own people and abandons them to God's mercy, however without asking permission from God and thus going against his given responsibility. In the Quran, it is also mentioned that if Jonah had not prayed inside the belly of the fish he would have stayed in there until the Judgement day. In the Bible, Jonah pays a fare to sail to Tarshish. In both stories, he boards the ship loaded with passengers, lots are cast and Jonah is thrown overboard and swallowed by a large fish (Jonah 1:17, As-Saaffat 37142). After praying, he is cast out of the fish and washed ashore, and God causes a gourd to grow (37146) or weeds (). In the Bible, Jonah continues into Nineveh, and the city is spared by God. In the Quran, God causes the gourd to grow to comfort Jonah after he lies on the shore in a sickly state (As-Saaffat 37145), in the Bible the gourd plant grows up to provide shade for Jonah while he waits for Nineveh to be destroyed (Jonah 4:6). According to an Islamic tradition however, the big fish gets frightened at first, fearing it might have swallowed a holy person as it heard prayers and supplications read in a wonderful voice from her stomach, hearing which numerous sea creatures had surrounded it. But she comforts herself later since it was God's order to swallow Jonah. After two days the fish casts him out the beach of an island and he is very weak. The gastric juices with the hot sunlight burned his skin till the point he was about to scream of pain. God causes a vine to grow over him and provide him fruit and shade. He recovers and goes back to his people who had become good after he left. According to the Bible, Ninevah was a great city, with more than one hundred twenty thousand people and much livestock (Jonah 4:11). In the Quran, the number of people he was sent towards as a prophet exceeded a hundred thousand. They believed in his message and God granted them prosperity for a long time. (As-Saaffat 37147‚Äì148). In the New Testament, Jesus refers to the Ninevites repenting at the preaching of Jonah (, ). =Haman= In the Bible, Haman was an Agagite noble and vizier of the empire under Persian King Ahasuerus who desires to persecute the Jews. In the Quran, Haman is an adviser and builder under a Firaun (Pharaoh) of ancient Egypt whose narrative relationship with Moses is recounted in the Quran. The structure which Firaun commands Haman to build is similar to the Tower of Babel in Genesis, unrelated to the narrative of Haman in the Bible. Both structures are made from burnt bricks for the purpose of ascending to the heavens. New Testament narratives =Zechariah (Zakariya) and John (Yahya)= The story of Zechariah is told in the Gospel of Luke and and in the Quran 3.37-41 and 19.2‚Äì15. In both accounts, Zechariah and his wife reached an old age without bearing children. Zechariah is told his wife would conceive, despite her barrenness, and his name would be John. As a sign that this would happen, Zechariah becomes mute. John grows to be a devout man. Both accounts mention John's death. Each account also contains unique elements and differ regarding Zechariah's muteness. In the Bible, Gabriel appears to Zechariah, a priest, on the right side of the altar telling him that his wife will conceive. Zechariah questions how his wife could conceive when he is an old man and his wife is barren, and is struck mute because of his disbelief. Later, Elizabeth conceives. After Elizabeth gives birth and they went to circumcise the child, Zechariah confirms that the son's name is John and receives his speech back. In the Quran, God promises Zechariah a child and Zechariah similarly questions God. God replies that it is easy, just as he created Zechariah from nothing. Zechariah then asks for a sign, and God responds that he will not speak to anyone for three nights, except by gesture. This may imply he simply would not find an occasion to speak to anyone. Zechariah comes out from his prayer chamber and gestures to praise God in the morning and afternoon. =Mary (Maryam)= Mary's life is told in several books of the New Testament and the Quran. Bible In the Bible, in the sixth month after the conception of John the Baptist by Elizabeth, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to the Virgin Mary, at Nazareth. Mary was of the house of David, and was betrothed to Joseph, of the same royal family. And the angel had taken the figure and the form of man, came into the house and said to her: 'Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.' Mary having heard the greeting words did not speak; she was troubled in spirit, since she knew not the angel, nor the cause of his coming, nor the meaning of the salutation. And the angel continued and said: 'Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with God. Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name Jesus (in Matthew 1:21‚Äì22 a meaning for the name is given \\"for he shall save his people from their sins. In Hebrew ◊ô◊©◊ï◊¢ sounds like the Hebrew word for salvation \\"◊ô◊©◊ï◊¢◊î\\"). He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his father, and he shall reign in the house of Jacob forever. And of his kingdom there shall be no end.' Not doubting the word of God, unlike Zachariah, but filled with fear and astonishment, she said: \\"How shall this be done, because I have not known a man?' The angel, to remove Mary's anxiety and to assure her that her virginity would be spared, answered: 'The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee. And therefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.' In token of the truth of his word he made known to her the conception of John, the miraculous pregnancy of her relative now old and sterile: 'And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth; she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month with her that is called barren: because no word shall be impossible with God.' Mary may not yet have fully understood the meaning of the heavenly message and how the maternity might be reconciled with her vow of virginity, but clinging to the first words of the angel and trusting to the omnipotence of God she said: 'Behold the handmaid of the Lord, be it done to me according to thy word.' In Luke, Mary is betrothed to Joseph but the Quran never mentions any man. In the Quran, 'her people' have a conversation with Mary accusing her of fornication. In the Bible, no such conversation happens but Joseph knows that people are thinking this. Quran \\"Maryam\\", a Quranic chapter (surah) is named for Mary and The Quran mentions Maryam by name in numerous verses (ƒÅyƒÅt), starting with her birth. Q3:36-37: Then when she (the wife of  øImrƒÅn) had given birth to her she said: :My lord: I have given birth to a female (And God knew best to what she was to give birth. And the male is not like the female.) And I have named her Maryam. Then her lord accepted her with a comely acceptance and caused her to grow with a comely growth And placed her under the care of ZakariyyƒÅ. Whenever ZakariyyƒÅ entered upon her in the sanctuary he found with her provision. He said: :O Maryam: whence comes this to you? She said: It is from the presence of God. God gives provision to whom he wills without reckoning.Sam Gerrans, The Qur'an: A Complete Revelation. Reference Edition. Her final mention is in the final verse of Chapter 66 \\"Prohibition\\". =Jesus (Isa)= Jesus's ministry takes up the whole of the four Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) in the Bible, as well as being the focus of the subsequent books of the New Testament. Some stories common to all four Gospels include that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist,; ; ; subsequently travelled as an itinerant preacher and healer, took on twelve apostles, miraculously fed 5000 people at least once,; ; ; entered Jerusalem on a donkey,; ; ; drove merchants from the Second Temple,; ; ; predicted his betrayal by one of his disciples,; ; ; was crucified,; ; ; but resurrected from death.; ; ; Each gospel represents a different perspective, with some different information and emphases than each of the other gospels. Christians accept all four books as part of the canon of Scripture. Jesus directly appears several times in the Quran: Al-Imran 35‚Äì59; An-Nisa' 156‚Äì158; Al-Ma'idah 109‚Äì120; Maryam 16‚Äì35, Al-Mu'minun 50; Az-Zukhruf 57‚Äì65; As-Saff 6 and 14. He is also indirectly referred to in other locations. The Quran contains few narratives from Jesus' life, but does include many brief descriptions in common with the Bible: *Made the dead to liveSurah 5.110 *Was the prophesied MessiahSurah 3.45 *Had disciplesSurah 3.52 *Taught disciples to carry on his ministrySurah 3.55 *Healed individuals inflicted with blindness and leprosy The details of Jesus's birth differ from those offered in the gospels of Matthew and Luke (see above section). Other accounts in the Quran do not exist in the Bible. Two such stories, one in which infant Jesus verbally testifies to Mary's virginity and another in which young Jesus forms and breathes life into clay birds, have counterparts in non-canonical Christian literature (see Infancy Gospels).Hans-Josef Klauck (2003). The Apocryphal Gospels: An Introduction. p 18 056708390X \\"The surprising element in this Sure is not the allusion to Jesus' miracles of feeding the crowds, but the reference to the remarkable visual miracle of breathing life into birds formed of clay. This is related in the Infancy Gospel of Thomas (2:2‚Äì4;\\" The Quran rejects that Jesus ever expected to be interpreted as divine and that he only taught strictly tawhid. Other figures The Quran and the Bible have over 50 characters in common, typically in the same narratives. The Quran identifies Enoch and Ishmael as prophets, but they are never given a story. In the Bible, all these men are identified as righteous people but not prophets -- except Ishmael who is blessed by God (). There is also one person mentioned in the Quran, Dhul-Qarnayn, who is not mentioned in the Bible by that name but whose story is similar to stories about Alexander the Great as mentioned in other Alexander romances and legends of its time (see Alexander the Great in the Quran). Mixed similarities In several cases, the Quran and the Bible have common events but occur in different narrations. =Idol calf and Samaritan= In the Bible, in Moses' absence, certain people who went out of Egypt with the Hebrews worship a golden calf saying \\"This is your God, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.\\" Hundreds of years later, Samaria was founded and became the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. King Jeroboam, its first king, also made two golden calves and said, \\"These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.\\" The Quran tells the story of a calf while Moses is gone. A man called \\"the Samari\\" Yusuf Ali or \\"the Samaritan\\" (Arberry) is blamed for protagonizing their idolatry. A verse in Hosea 8:5‚Äì6 contains the same content as Ta-Ha 20.97 where Hosea refers to the Jeroboam calf and the Quran refers to the earlier calf. Both feature a prophet speaking to the Samaritan/Samaria promising to destroy the calf. In the Quran, Moses' punishment that the Samari cannot be touched is the same as the modern Samaritan's punishment where no Jew was allowed to touch them because of their idolatry. In his commentary, Yusuf Ali claims that the Samari is not a Samaritan. =Miriam and Mary= In Arabic, both the names Mary and Miriam are called Maryam. Mary, the mother of Jesus, is the only woman to have her name mentioned in the Q'uran; all other women are mentioned only by relations, and their names were given later by commentators. While speaking about Mary, the mother of Jesus, the Quran also refers to her as the sister of Aaron (in verses and ), who in the bible also had a sister Miriam. According to James K. Walker, ‚Äúcritics have noted that the Qur‚Äôan appears to confuse Mary ‚Ä¶ in the New Testament with Miram of the Old Testament, who ‚Ä¶ lived some 1400 years earlier‚Äù. However, according to Muslim interpreters, this Aaron is different from the brother of Moses. It was a tradition to give people the names of prophets and pious persons who lived before them as mentioned in the following hadeeth: > Mughira b. Shu'ba reported: When I came to Najran, they (the Christians of > Najran) asked me: You read\\" O sister of Harun\\" (i. e. Hadrat Maryam) in the > Quran, whereas Moses was born much before Jesus. When I came back to Allah's > Messenger (may peace be upon him) I asked him about that, whereupon he said: > The (people of the old age) used to give names (to their persons) after the > names of Apostles and pious persons who had gone before them. (Sheik Muslim > ‚Äì Adaaab Book) =Hannah and Hannah= In the Books of Samuel, Hannah is grateful that God gave her a son, Samuel. She dedicated him to God by letting him live with Eli the prophet and priest. In the Quran, Mary's mother is grateful to God for Mary and dedicates her to God. Mary then lives in the household of Zechariah the prophet. In the Bible, Zechariah is also a priest. Mary's mother is unnamed in the Quran.

His compositions include much chamber music, a song cycle, The Wind Among the Reeds, and an operetta Tantivy Towers that had a successful London run in 1931. He was also a teacher, examiner and writer on musical subjects. Life and career =Early years= Dunhill was born in Hampstead, London, the fourth of five children of Henry Dunhill (1842‚Äì1901) and his wife Jane, n√©e Styles (1843‚Äì1922).Dibble, Jeremy, \\"Dunhill, Thomas Frederick (1877‚Äì1946)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 13 October 2011 Henry Dunhill was a manufacturer of sacks, tarpaulin and ropes; Jane Dunhill ran a small music shop. Their eldest son, Alfred later founded a tobacco company that bears his name. Thomas was educated at the North London High School for Boys, and when the family moved to Kent, at Kent College, Canterbury. In 1893 Dunhill entered the Royal College of Music studying the piano with Franklin Taylor, counterpoint with James Higgs and W. S. Rockstro, and harmony with Walter Parratt. In 1894 he began studying composition under Charles Villiers Stanford, whose pupil he remained after leaving the college, studying with him until 1901. In 1899 Dunhill was the first winner of the Tagore Gold Medal, awarded to the College's outstanding students.Kington. Beryl \\"Dunhill, Thomas\\" Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 13 October 2011 =Early 20th century= From 1899 to 1908 Dunhill was assistant music master at Eton. From 1905 he was also on the staff of the Royal College of Music as professor of harmony and counterpoint. He began a career as an examiner for the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, working in Britain and throughout much of the British Empire. From 1907 to 1919 Dunhill presented concerts of chamber music in London, featuring the works of British composers. After the first, in June 1907, The Times observed: Among the composers featured in the first concerts were James Friskin, Joseph Holbrooke, Cecil Forsyth and William Hurlstone. Later, Dunhill presented works by Ralph Vaughan Williams, Charles Wood, Eugene Goossens, Rutland Boughton, J. B. McEwen, Richard Walthew and Nicholas Gatty. During this period Dunhill was composing orchestral and chamber works, songs and song cycles. His setting of 'Half Close Your Eyelids', first published in The Dome in 1902, is the earliest known song setting of poetry by W B Yeats. It was used as the first song in the 1904 Yeats cycle The Wind Among the Reeds, which also includes Dunhill's best known song, 'The Cloths of Heaven'. The cycle was first performed in 1912 (in the orchestral version) by Gervase Elwes at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert conducted by Sir Frederick Cowen.\\"Music ‚Äì Philharmonic Society\\", The Times, 22 November 1912, p. 9 The Times said, \\"Mr. Dunhill has caught the spirit of Yeats's poems very skilfully, and his music well conveys their quiet, unforced mysticism, their quick turns of humour and the easy flow of the lines. ‚Ä¶ Mr. Dunhill's setting never seems to miss a point, and never labours one.\\" This period was particularly notable for his chamber music, such as the F minor Quintet for horn and strings, op 6 and the two violin sonatas - the second (of 1916) perhaps his finest work, according to Jeremy Dibble. In the London musical world Dunhill was a figure of increasing prominence in the years before the First World War. He was invited to address the Musical Association in 1908 on the topic \\"The evolution of melody\\"; his remarks were widely reported in the general press.\\"Our London Correspondence\\", The Manchester Guardian, 22 April 1908, p. 4; and \\"The Musical Association\\", The Times, 23 April 1908, p. 13\\"Our composers, he thinks, are reverting to the earliest forms of musical expression, the vague utterances of primitive man, while at the same time employing all the vast resources of modern orchestration to provide atmosphere and background.\\" At the outbreak of the war he joined the Artists Rifles and later became a bandsman with the Irish Guards. In 1918 he was appointed a director of the Royal Philharmonic Society; he chaired the board meeting that reformed the constitution of the society after its wartime expedient of effective control by Sir Thomas Beecham.\\"Thomas Frederick Dunhill\\", Bach-cantatas.com, accessed 7 May 2013 =Light opera= One of the composers whom Dunhill greatly admired was Arthur Sullivan. He generally avoided Sullivan's influence in his own music, but his 1928 study of Sullivan's music broke new ground: there had been many biographies and memoirs, but Dunhill's was the first book by a practising musician to analyse the music.\\"Sullivan's Operas\\", The Times Literary Supplement, 12 April 1928, p. 269 In addition to the 1928 book, Dunhill arranged 15 piano albums of music from all 14 Gilbert and Sullivan operas.They were published by Chappell and Co: Trial by Jury (1925 ‚Äì OCLC 498795573 ), The Sorcerer (1924 ‚Äì OCLC 42298598 ),H.M.S.

In 1931 Dunhill's music came to a wider public with the comic opera Tantivy Towers to a libretto by A.P. Herbert. It ran at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith and then at the New Theatre, London for more than 180 performances.\\"The Theatres ‚Äì Revival of \\"Tantivy Towers,\\" The Times, 27 May 1935, p. 12 It was revived in 1935 with Maggie Teyte and Steuart Wilson in the leading roles. The opera humorously contrasted modern Chelsea artistic types with the traditional philistine county set. Dunhill was widely thought to have succeeded more with the music for the latter than for the former, and was criticised for avoiding any hint of jazz in his Chelsea music.\\"The Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith ‚Äì 'Tantivy Towers'\\", The Times, 17 January 1931, p. 8 =Later years= Dunhill was a stalwart of organisations dedicated to the welfare of his fellow musicians: these included the Performing Right Society and the Musicians' Benevolent Fund. He was a director of the Royal Philharmonic Society and Dean of the Faculty of Music at the University of London. He was in steady demand as musical examiner, lecturer, and adjudicator, and returned to teaching, first at the Royal College, taking the chamber music class, and later at Eton, where he returned during the Second World War. As a composer, Dunhill's later works included: Four Original Pieces for organ Op. 101 (1916); Elegiac Variations on an Original Theme (1919‚Äì20) written in memory of Hubert Parry and first performed at the Gloucester Festival in 1922;Brook, Donald. Composers' Portraits (1946) the suite for strings In Rural England (1929);Recorded on Palace Premieres by The Countess of Wessex‚Äôs String Orchestra, MPR CWSO01 the ballet Gallimaufry, premiered in Hamburg in 1937;\\"British Ballet in Hamburg\\", The Times, 18 December 1937, p. 10 Triptych for viola and orchestra (1942); and the overture May Time (1945) premiered at the Proms conducted by Sir Adrian Boult. The Times called the last \\"a popular and unpretentious overture which makes its way cheerfully enough and cleverly draws on the true vitality of a Morris and one of Morley's best tunes.\\"Promenade Concert ‚Äì Thomas F. Dunhill's New Overture\\", The Times, 11 September 1945, p. 6 His most substantial orchestral piece was the Symphony in A minor, composed several years earlier, but first performed in Belgrade on 28 December 1922. His one- act opera The Enchanted Garden op. 65 was published as part of the Carnegie Collection of British Music series in 1925. At a time when Elgar's music was out of fashion, Dunhill was a strong advocate for it. His 1938 book about the composer combined biography and musical analysis. The Times Literary Supplement praised Dunhill for his accessible analysis and for \\"a portrait drawn by one who knew and loved him well.\\"\\"Music and Literature\\", The Times Literary Supplement, 5 November 1938, p. 704 Among the honours given to Dunhill were the Cobbett Chamber Music Medal (1924), of which he was the first recipient, an honorary doctorate from Durham University (1940) and honorary fellowships of the Royal Academy of Music (1938) and the Royal College of Music (1942). =Personal life= In 1914, Dunhill married Mary Penrose Arnold, the great-niece of Matthew Arnold, and the great-granddaughter of Thomas Arnold. The marriage took place at St Luke's Church in Chelsea, where John Ireland was the resident organist and chorus master. There were two sons and a daughter of the marriage. The couple lived at 74, Lansdowne Road in Notting Hill Gate until 1924, when they moved to Guildford. Mary Dunhill died in October 1929, after which Dunhill returned to London, living at 27, Platts Lane in Hampstead for the last years of his life.Foreman, Lewis and Foreman, Susan. London, A Musical Gazetteer, 2005 In 1942 Dunhill married Isabella Simpson Featonby. He died at his mother-in-law's house in Scunthorpe, aged 69. His son David Dunhill (1917-2005) became a well-known BBC radio announcer who wrote a memoir of his father in 1997.Dunhill, David.

His work on documenting the coal mines of Wales and America has been used extensively in publications. Specifically during the UK miners' strike (1984‚Äì1985). Life and work Tiley first worked in photography as an industrial photographer for Lucas Industries, a large car component company. He spent four years there and subsequently decided to specialise in documentary photography. He studied at the School of Documentary Photography under Magnum photographer David Hurn. On completion of the course in 1984, Tiley worked for a number of national newspapers and magazines, including The Times, The Sunday Times, The Guardian and The Observer. Much of his journalistic work was based on the miners' strike in 1984/1985. Because of his work on the miners' strike, he was commissioned, along with David Bailey, John Davies (photographer) and Paul Reas to produce \\"The Valleys Project\\", a collection of photographs reflecting life in the South Wales Valleys.A resource on the Valleys Project is available at . They are meticulously annotated with context information and encompass every part of the miners' lives. Since the 1980s, Tiley has concentrated on working on commissions for exhibitions, archive collections, television and book publication. Over the past three decades, Tiley has had work exhibited and published regularly in Europe and the US and is the author of three books. His commissions include photographing the Welsh descendants living in Pennsylvania and covering extensively the mining communities of West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia, and Tennessee. He is now a former lecturer in photography, media studies and graphic design at Gower College Swansea, Wales. He has delivered lectures on his photographic practice in the UK and the US. He is also involved in delivering photography workshops on landscape and documentary photography. Tiley was awarded a commission to photograph the manufactured coast-scape in Wales. For the year-long project He travelled around the coastline of Wales to make photographs of the way the coast line has been adapted to cater for twenty-first-century needs. This included photographing industrial manufacturing plants, the tourism industry and the need for power generation. The work was exhibited in Europe and the UK. Tiley was the only photographer allowed to photograph underground on the coal face of the last deep coal mine in the UK, Kellingley Colliery in North Yorkshire. This work was commissioned by Keo Films, London, who made a BBC documentary titled 'The Last Miners'. It was also published as a book by 2Ten Books. Tiley has also produced and directed moving image. His work has been featured on a number of television and radio features in the UK, Europe and the US. Tiley worked on a project called Thirty Years Ago, re-visiting the mining communities he photographed thirty years ago and making portraits of former miners, along with people involved in mining today. His work is closely linked to his upbringing in the south Wales valleys. He is very proud of his birthplace. To this day, he supports the miners and feels sad to see the demise of the industrial valleys. Tiley has exhibited his photographs of Welsh coal mining outdoors at the derelict remains of South Wales coal mines and at Big Pit National Coal Museum at Blaenavon. Since 2015, after leaving his post as a lecturer in Media and Photography, Tiley has worked on numerous commissioned projects and has worked both in still documentary photography and film. In 2015, Tiley was commissioned by Keo Films, London/BBC, to be the only photographer allowed to capture the last few weeks of the last deep coal mine in the UK - Kellingley Colliery, north Yorkshire. The mine closed on 18 December 2015. A book was produced and sold out within weeks. In 2018, Tiley successfully gained funding to work on a major documentary film project called 'Pride in our Valley'. The film will be premiered in 2020; it follows the lives of people in the upper Dulais Valley in South Wales, UK. Tiley says 'this has been an incredible experience and the community have welcomed me with open arms'. Roger lives in the village of Ystradgynlais in the Swansea Valley, South Wales.

Content and reception Onze Danses Pour Combattre la Migraine comprises 17 tracks that draw on a mix of musical forms, cultures and genres. With drum machines and looping organ lines, they shuffle between improvised jazz, ethnic music, electronics and classical music.

Biography Pakenham was born the third son of Thomas Pakenham, 1st Baron Longford, and his wife Elizabeth Pakenham, 1st Countess of Longford. He entered the Royal Navy in 1771 on board the , with Captain John MacBride, with whom he moved to the in 1773. In 1774 he was on the coast of Guinea with William Cornwallis in the , and in 1775 was acting lieutenant of the on the coast of North America. In the following year he was promoted by Lord Shuldham to be lieutenant of the frigate , and while in her saw much boat service, in the course of which he was severely wounded. In 1778 he joined the , commanded by Lord Mulgrave, in the fleet under Keppel, and was present in the Battle of Ushant on 27 July. In the following spring he was moved into the Europe, going to North America with the flag of Rear-Admiral Mariot Arbuthnot, and on 21 September 1779 was promoted to the command of the sloop , newly captured from the enemy. He was then sent to the Jamaica station, where, on 2 March 1780, he was posted by Sir Peter Parker the elder to the . His old wound, received while in the Greyhound, broke out again, and compelled him to return to England in the autumn. In December 1780 he was appointed to the of 28 guns, attached to the fleet under George Darby, which relieved Gibraltar in April 1781, and was sent on to Menorca in company with the under William Peere Williams-Freeman. On their way back, in passing through the straits, they fell in, on 30 May, with two Dutch frigates. In the ensuing Battle of Cape St Mary, one of the Dutch frigates, the Castor (commanded by Pieter Melvill van Carnbee), struck to the Flora, while the other, the Den Briel, overpowered and captured the Crescent. The Crescent was immediately recaptured by the Flora, the Den Briel making her escape; but both Crescent and Castor had received so much damage in the action that they fell into the hands of two French frigates on the way home, 19 June, the Flora escaping. Pakenham had, however, refused to resume the command of the Crescent, maintaining that by his surrender to the Den Briel his commission was cancelled, and that when recaptured the ship was on the same footing as any other prize. For the loss of his ship he was tried by court-martial and honourably acquitted, it being proved that he did not strike the flag till, by the fall of her masts and the disabling of her guns, further resistance was impossible. He was therefore at once appointed to the frigate , which he commanded in the following year at the relief of Gibraltar by Lord Howe. In 1793 he commissioned the , and in her took part in the Glorious First of June, when his conduct was spoken of as particularly brilliant, and he was recommended by Howe for the gold medal. In 1795 he was turned over to the 84-gun ship Juste, in the capture of which, on 1 June, he had had a principal hand. He was afterwards for some time master-general of the ordnance in Ireland, and had no further service in the navy. In 1783, Pakenham entered the Irish House of Commons for Longford Borough and sat until 1790. Subsequently, he represented Kells until 1798 and again Longford Borough until the Act of Union in 1801. On 14 February 1799, Pakenham was promoted to be rear-admiral, vice-admiral on 23 April 1804, and admiral on 31 July 1810. He was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 20 May 1820. He married in 1785 Louisa, daughter of the Right Hon. John Staples, and had a large family. His fifth son Sir Richard Pakenham was a diplomat who served as British ambassador to Mexico, the United States and Portugal. Pakenham died on 2 February 1836.

He served as British Ambassador to the United States from 1843 until 1847, during which time he unsuccessfully worked to prevent the U.S. annexation of Texas and California by establishing British forces there instead. Early life Pakenham, the fifth son of Admiral Sir Thomas Pakenham, by his wife, Louisa, daughter of the Right Hon. John Staples, was born at Pakenham Hall, County Westmeath, Ireland. He completed his education at Trinity College, Dublin, and, apparently without waiting to take a degree, entered the Foreign Office on 15 October 1817. Career His first appointment was as attach√© to his uncle, the Earl of Clancarty, at the Hague. His next appointment was as secretary of the legation in Switzerland (26 January 1824). On 29 December 1826 he was appointed to the same position in Mexico; on 12 March 1835, he was promoted to Minister Plenipotentiary to Mexico. In this capacity he seems to have been popular and efficient. Perhaps the most troublesome of his negotiations was for the abolition of the slave trade: the Mexican government objected to the right of search, and negotiations dragged on for four years, but he obtained a treaty in 1841. He was in Mexico during the Pastry War between Mexico and France, and in February 1839 was dispatched to Veracruz with the object of trying to effect a reconciliation between the two countries. On 13 December 1843, while on leave in England, he was made a privy councillor, and on 14 December he was appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States of America. Here some thorny questions awaited him. One of his first duties was that of the Oregon boundary. In this negotiation, though he did not carry the British points, he obtained the approval of his government, which signed the Oregon Treaty in 1846. The attitude of Great Britain regarding Texas proved of greater difficulty. The relations between the two governments were not very cordial and irritation was easily provoked on both sides. Pakenham left Washington on a leave of absence in May 1847, and, after remaining in Europe for an unusually prolonged period, ultimately preferred to retire on a pension rather than return. He resumed his career on 28 April 1851 as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Lisbon. Here, his diplomatic work was less arduous and he rapidly ingratiated himself with the royal family of Portugal. In May 1855, he came to England on leave, and at his own request, on 28 June, retired on pension, but ,on 7 August, he was sent back to Lisbon on a special mission to congratulate King Pedro V of Portugal on attaining his majority. He returned to England once more in October 1855, was awarded a diplomatic pension of the second class, and retired to Coolure, Castlepollard, where he died, unmarried in 1868.

Creation It was created in 1920 with a lane that measured no more than 800 meters (2,624 feet). The airport was given the name of ‚ÄúCaptain Horacio Vasquez‚Äù honoring a pilot who died in an accident flying from Argentina to La Paz. Nevertheless, because of the location, the airport with time was known as ‚ÄúEl Trompillo‚Äù. For the first 65 years, it was the only airport in the city, until in 1984 the international airport of Viru Viru was constructed. Since then it has only operated local flights and the landing and departure of students of the Bolivian Air Force. The first airlines to use this airport were Lloyd A√©reo Boliviano, known as LAB, and Panagra. About 70 departures and arrivals of the Air Force, and small and large airlines are registered. For a while, from 1980 to 1985, the amount of airplanes registered increased due to a combat against drug traffic.

The program originated on Staten Island in the early 1990s, but has also been implemented in Queens and the Bronx. The Bluebelt includes structural and nonstructural stormwater management control measures taken to mitigate changes to both quantity and quality of runoff caused through changes to land use. History The Bluebelt program was initiated in the late 1980s by New York City‚Äôs Departments of Environmental Protection and City Planning, based on a suggestion made several decades earlier by Ian McHarg, a landscape architect. Acquisition of land began in 1991 for the project, one of the Northeast United States‚Äô most ambitious stormwater management efforts. The overall goal is to provide the necessary stormwater drainage infrastructure for a region on the southern end of the island while at the same time preserving the last freshwater wetlands in New York City. The bluebelt uses a series of carefully placed BMPs at the storm sewer/wetland interface to reduce flooding and improve water quality. Creation of a self- regulating ecosystem that is native to the region is of primary importance to the program. BMPs used in the bluebelt include stormwater wetlands, stream restoration, outlet stilling basins, and sand filters. Ninety-two stormwater wetlands were included as part of the Staten Island project. In order to integrate the wetlands into the natural ecology, the construction process is advised by restoration specialists since general contractors are typically not trained in proper plant selection and installation. The planting design focuses on quick establishment of the preferred successional communities that will complement the surrounding landscape, before invasive species take over the site. The performance of the Bluebelt during the storms that battered the city in the early 21st century - including Hurricane Sandy - has been described as \\"brilliant\\".

A second edition, also by Reiver Games, with both English and German rules was published in 2008. Players assume the roles of mad scientists racing to create a monster from body parts and bring it to life. It's Alive! can be played by two to five players and takes around 20 to 45 minutes to play. A third edition with a family-friendly Hanukkah theme (actually, the original mockup theme) was published in 2013 as Candle Quest by Victory Point Games. Gameplay Players take turns to choose a card and then play it. The game ends when one player cries out It's Alive! after collecting the eight body parts needed to bring their monster to life. First a player must choose a card by either: * Turning over the top card of the deck, for free; * or, buying the top card out of a player's discard pile (known as their graveyard). In the third edition, the player simply buys the card to their stockpile directly out of a discard pile for one and a half times its face value and ends their turn. Once a card has been chosen players then have three options: * Buy that card at its face value, by paying money from their stockpile of cash to the bank; * Sell that card to the bank, adding it to the top of their graveyard and taking half the value of the card from the bank; * Or auction it to the other players, saying what they are prepared to pay, and giving each player one chance to out-bid them. In addition, there are two special cards: the coffin, which is treated like a wild card, and can be used instead of any body part card, and a villagers' uprising which represents irate villagers who need to be appeased by paying them off. Duplicate cards and bought-off villagers can be used to pay for other villagers or to buy cards out of a discard pile. Strategy Strategically, It's Alive! requires the players to manage their limited funds to get as many body parts as possible while denying their opponents cheap access to body parts that they need. Because buying an auctioned part from another player provides them with income, paying over the face value leads to another player gaining more benefit than the purchaser. Since a player can only gain funds during their turn (by selling or auctioning a card), spending money during your turn can be a dangerous tactic, potentially leaving you unable to take part in auctions until your next turn. Also, players need to be aware that drawing the villagers' uprising can be very expensive if provisions haven't been made to meet their price.

However, there are a number of older houses such as the Grade II listed building 'Grove Court' or the Grade I listed 'Upstreet Farmhouse', which was built in the 16th century and stands in an acre of its own land. It had notable different purposes over the years and is known to be haunted. Also listed are 'Hamilton's' and 'The Vision House' (No89 and No94) Close to Upstreet is the Stodmarsh National Nature Reserve, Grove Ferry Picnic Area and the River Stour. Also the Saxon Shore Way (long distance footpath) also passes the village between Chislet and Stourmouth. Upstreet has a few services (a shop, two elderly care homes, one pub and one car sales lot), the garage having closed through 2015. The number of services is declining due to rising car ownership. For example, 45 years ago there was a railway station, haberdashery, greengrocer's, butcher's, baker's etc. However now there is no railway station and the shop consolidates the uses of a post office, greengrocer's, haberdashery, baker's, butcher's, etc. all under one roof.

Organised by county, they were supposed to drill on a regular basis, although this was rarely the case in practice. They later became common in the American colonies, where they are normally referred to as Trainbands. Similar organisations include the Dutch Schutterij, and the Swiss militia, elements of which remain in existence today. Trained Bands; England and Wales Founded in 1572, and organised by county, it was not until the 'Exact Militia Programme' of 1625 that they began to have regular training and weapons drill. Even then, standards varied considerably, and depended on the level of financial support by the local gentry. Although Charles I tried to assemble armies of around 30,000 militia for the 1639 and 1640 Bishops Wars, there was considerable reluctance to serve outside their counties, and a proportion were armed only with Longbows.Fissell, Chapter 5. A standard drill book was issued in February 1638, which was used throughout the 1638 to 1651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms, together with a muster roll by county. This shows large variations in size, equipment and training; the largest was Yorkshire, which had 12,000 men, then London, with 8,000, increased in 1642 to 20,000. Counties like Shropshire or Glamorgan had fewer than 500 men. In the early stages of the 1642 to 1646 First English Civil War, the Trained Bands provided the bulk of the forces used by both Royalists and Parliamentarians, but were often unwilling to serve outside their home areas. They were rapidly replaced by more professional bodies, the most important being the New Model Army. American Train bands In the early American colonies the trained band was the most basic tactical unit.Allan R. Millett and Peter Maslowski: For the common defense: A military history of the United States of America, New York: Free Press; London: Collier Macmillan, 1984, Library of Congress bibliographic record, http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/simon052/94005199.html, last accessed 27 Oct 2018: \\"Although the basic tactical unit in all the colonies was the company, or trainband, regional variations and changes over time were as important as the superficial uniformity. No standardized company size existed, some companies containing as few as sixty-five men and others as many as two hundred. Some trainbands elected their officers, but in others the governors appointed them. Southern colonies, with widely dispersed populations, often organized companies on a countywide basis, while in New England, with its towns and villages, individual communities contained their own trainbands. As populations increased and the number of trainbands grew, colonies organized companies into regiments to preserve efficient management.\\" However, no standard company size existed and variations were wide. As population grew these companies were organised into regiments to allow better management.Allan R.

Generally, upon reaching a certain age a man was required to join the local trainband in which he received periodic training for the next couple of decades. In wartime, military forces were formed by selecting men from trainbands on an individual basis and then forming them into a fighting unit. The exact derivation and usage is not clear. A nineteenth-century dictionary says, under \\"Train\\": The issue is whether the men \\"received training\\" in the modern sense, or whether they were \\"in the train\\" or retinue or were otherwise organised around a military \\"train\\" as in horse-drawn artillery. In 17th Century New England colonial militia units were usually referred to as \\"train bands\\" or, sometimes, \\"trained bands\\".Charles J. Hoadly, State Librarian: The Public Records of the State of Connecticut From October, 1776, to February, 1778, Inclusive, With the Journal of the Council of Safety from October 11, 1776, to May 6, 1778, Inclusive, and An Appendix, Connecticut: Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company, 1894, pp. 32, et seq., https://books.google.com/books?id=uWhKAAAAYAAJ&pg;=PA267&lpg;=PA267&dq;=%22trainband%22#v=onepage&q;=%22trainband%22&f;=false, last accessed 27 Oct 2018: \\"that part of the militia called the train-bands.\\" Typically, each town would elect three officers to lead its train band with the ranks of captain, lieutenant and ensign. As the populations of towns varied widely, larger towns usually had more than one train band. In the middle 1600s train bands began to be referred to as companies. On December 13, 1636 the Massachusetts Militia was organised into three regiments - North, South and East. As there are National Guard units descendants of these regiments, this date is used as the \\"birthday\\" of the National Guard, despite the fact that citizen militias in the American Colonies date back to the Jamestown settlement in 1607.

The aircraft involved, a Vickers Viscount named the Hunyani, was flying the last leg of Air Rhodesia's regular scheduled service from Victoria Falls to the capital Salisbury, via the resort town of Kariba. Soon after Flight 825 took off, a group of ZIPRA guerrillas hit it on its starboard wing with a Soviet-made Strela-2 surface-to-air infrared homing missile, critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an emergency landing. An attempted belly landing in a cotton field just west of Karoi was foiled by a ditch, which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up. Of the 52 passengers and four crew, 38 died in the crash; the insurgents then approached the wreckage, rounded up the 10 survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire. Three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush, while a further five lived because they had gone to look for water before the guerrillas arrived. ZIPRA leader Joshua Nkomo publicly claimed responsibility for shooting down the Hunyani in an interview with the BBC's Today programme the next day, saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes, but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground. The majority of Rhodesians, both black and white, saw the attack as an act of terrorism. A fierce Rhodesian backlash followed against enemy strongholds and increased racial tension even though few black Rhodesians supported attacks of this kind. Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as Time magazine, but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation. Talks between Nkomo and Prime Minister Ian Smith, which had been progressing promisingly, were immediately suspended by the Rhodesians, with Smith calling Nkomo a \\"monster\\". On 10 September, Smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas. The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months, attacking both ZIPRA and its rival, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA). The attack on ZIPRA in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions. In February 1979, ZIPRA shot down Air Rhodesia Flight 827, another civilian flight, in an almost identical incident. Background Rhodesia A dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the self-governing colony of Rhodesia led the colonial government, headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith, to unilaterally declare independence from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965. The idea of \\"no independence before majority rule\\" had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation, and Rhodesia's government was dominated by the country's white minority, so the unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally. Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia. Two rival communist-backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule: the Chinese-aligned Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), mostly comprising Shonas, created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and adopted aspects of Maoist doctrine, while the Ndebele-dominated Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), aligned with Soviet- style Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and the Warsaw Pact, mobilised the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA).; These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the \\"Second Chimurenga\\" against the Rhodesian government and security forces. The resulting conflict, the Rhodesian Bush War, began in earnest in December 1972, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia. After the security forces mounted a successful counter-insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974, developments overseas caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the insurgents' favour. The leftist Carnation Revolution of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith's administration, and led to Mozambique's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with ZANU. Around the same time, Rhodesia's other main backer, South Africa, adopted a d√©tente initiative that forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup. Following the abortive Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975, Smith and the ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo held unsuccessful talks between December 1975 and March 1976. ZANU and ZAPU announced in October 1976, during the run-up to the unsuccessful Geneva Conference in December, that they would henceforth attend conferences as a joint \\"Patriotic Front\\". In March 1978, Smith and non-militant nationalist groups headed by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole and Chief Jeremiah Chirau agreed what became the \\"Internal Settlement\\". This created a joint black‚Äìwhite transitional government, with the country due to be reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, pursuant to multiracial elections. ZANU and ZAPU were invited to participate, but refused; Nkomo sardonically dubbed Smith's black colleagues \\"the blacksmiths\\". ZANU proclaimed 1978 to be \\"The Year of the People\\" as the war continued. Officials from Muzorewa's United African National Council, sent to the provinces to explain the Internal Settlement to rural blacks, were killed by Marxist‚ÄìLeninist guerrillas. Insurgents also began to target Christian missionaries, climaxing in the killing of nine British missionaries and four children at Elim Mission near the Mozambican border on 23 June. The transitional government was badly received abroad, partly because the Internal Settlement kept control of law enforcement, the military, the judiciary and the civil service under white control. No country recognised Rhodesia's interim administration. Smith again worked to bring Nkomo into the government, hoping this would lend it some credence domestically, prompt diplomatic recognition overseas, and help the security forces defeat ZANLA. Starting on 14 August 1978, he attended secret meetings with Nkomo in Lusaka, Zambia (where ZAPU was based), doing so with the assistance of the mining corporation Lonrho. Attempts were made to also involve the ZANU leader Robert Mugabe, but Mugabe would have no part in the talks. According to the South African military historian Jakkie Cilliers, negotiations between Smith and Nkomo progressed well and \\"seemed on the verge of success\\" by the start of September 1978. On 2 September, Smith and Nkomo revealed publicly that the secret meetings had taken place. Incident =Prior threats to Rhodesian air traffic= alt=A Strela-2 launcher and one of its missiles. Rhodesian air traffic was not seriously threatened until about 1977, in the latter stages of the war; before this time, neither revolutionary force had the weapons to launch a viable attack against an aerial target. The weapon that made such attacks feasible for ZIPRA was the Strela-2 shoulder-launched surface-to-air missile launcher, supplied by the Soviet Union from the mid-1970s as part of the Warsaw Pact's materiel support. By September 1978, there had been 20 reported attempts to shoot down Rhodesian military aircraft using these weapons, none of which had been successful. Some Rhodesian Air Force Dakotas had been hit, but all had survived and landed safely. No civilian aircraft had yet been targeted during the Bush War. =Flight= alt=A Vickers Viscount aircraft on a runway, photographed from the port side Air Rhodesia was the country's national airline, established by the government on 1 September 1967 to succeed Central African Airways, which was dissolved at the end of that year. Based at Salisbury Airport, Air Rhodesia's flight network during the late 1970s comprised a domestic programme of passenger and cargo flights, as well as international services to the South African cities of Johannesburg and Durban. The Flight 825 aircraft was a Vickers Viscount 782D, a British-made turboprop aircraft with two engines on each wing. It was named the Hunyani after the river of the same name, which flowed between Lake Kariba and the Rhodesian capital Salisbury. The Hunyani was on the second and final leg of its regular scheduled journey between Victoria Falls and Salisbury, stopping over in the resort town of Kariba. Despite the occasional rocket and mortar attacks launched on Kariba by ZIPRA guerrillas on the northern side of the Zambezi (in Zambia), the resort had endured as one of Rhodesia's choice tourist destinations. The flight on 3 September 1978, Sunday afternoon, from Kariba to Salisbury carried four crew members and 52 passengers, most of whom were holidaymakers from Salisbury, returning home after a weekend at the lake. The flight took off from Kariba Airport on schedule soon after 17:00 Central Africa Time. Flight 825 was piloted by 36-year-old Captain John Hood, a native of Bulawayo who had gained his commercial pilot licence in 1966. He had flown Viscounts for Air Rhodesia since 1968, and had also served in the Rhodesian Air Force on a voluntary basis. His first officer, Garth Beaumont, was 31 years old, and had lived in Rhodesia for most of his life, having immigrated as a child from South Africa. The two air stewardesses were Dulcie Esterhuizen, 21 years old and from Bulawayo, and 23-year-old Louise Pearson, from Salisbury. =Shootdown= A group of ZIPRA guerrillas, armed with a Strela-2 launcher, waited in the bush beneath Flight 825's flightpath, and fired on the Hunyani about five minutes after it took off, while the aircraft was still in the climb phase of its flight. The heat-seeking missile hit the plane's starboard wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode. A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire that could not be put out. The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines. Heaving wildly, the Hunyani began to descend rapidly. At 17:10 Captain Hood sent a distress call to air traffic control, informing them that he had lost the two starboard engines and was going to crash. \\"We're going in,\\" he radioed. Telling his passengers to brace for an emergency landing, he aimed for an open field of cotton in the Whamira Hills, in the bush to the west of Karoi, intending to belly land the craft. The landing was relatively stable until the Hunyani hit a ditch, cartwheeled and exploded. The remaining fuel tanks ruptured and caught fire, setting the wrecked cabin ablaze. =Massacre on the ground= Of the 56 people on board, 38, including Hood and Beaumont, died in the crash. Eighteen survived, albeit with injuries, and climbed out of the wreckage. After briefly settling the others, one of the passengers, Cecil MacLaren, led four others‚Äîyoung newlyweds Robert and Shannon Hargreaves, Sharon Coles, and her four-year-old daughter Tracey‚Äîoff in the direction of a nearby village in search of water. The other 13 remained close to the wreckage. Meanwhile, nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site, and reached it at about 17:45. Three of the 13 survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching: Rhodesian Army reservist Anthony Hill, 39, took cover in the surrounding bush, while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Diana did the same. This left 10 passengers in full view near the wreckage, including four women and two girls (aged 11 and 4). The guerrillas, who were armed with AK-47 rifles, presented themselves to the 10 passengers as friendly, saying they would summon help and bring water. They spoke in English, both to the survivors and among themselves. They told the passengers to congregate around a point a few metres from the wreckage; when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk, the insurgents told the able-bodied men to carry the others. The passengers were assembled into an area of about . Standing roughly away, the cadres now raised their weapons. \\"You have taken our land,\\" one of them said. \\"Please don't shoot us!\\" one of the passengers cried, just before they were killed by a sustained burst of automatic gunfire. Those that survived the initial bursts were bayoneted (including a mother and her 3-week-old baby). Having collected water from the nearby village, MacLaren and his companions were almost back at the crash site when they heard the shots. Thinking it was personal ammunition in the luggage exploding in the heat, they continued on their way, and called out to the other passengers, who they thought were still alive. This alerted the insurgents to the presence of more survivors; one of the guerrillas told MacLaren's group to \\"come here\\". The insurgents then opened fire on their general location, prompting MacLaren and the others to flee. Hill and the Hansens also ran; they revealed their positions to the fighters in their haste, but successfully hid themselves behind a ridge. After Hill and the others had hidden there for about two hours, they saw the attackers return to the crash site at about 19:45. The guerrillas looted the wrecked cabin and some of the suitcases strewn around the site, filled their arms with passengers' belongings, then left again. The survivors were found over the following days by the Rhodesian Army and police; Hill and the Hansens were taken to Kariba Hospital, while MacLaren and his group were airlifted to Andrew Fleming Hospital in Salisbury. =Nkomo claims responsibility, but denies killing survivors= Nkomo claimed responsibility for the attack in an interview with the BBC's Today radio programme the next day, laughing as he did so, to the horror of most Rhodesian observers, both black and white..\\"This wicked massacre shocked the entire nation and the world. Black and white united in condemnation of the shooting down of Flight 825 and the senseless loss of innocent lives. Reports that ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo had laughed about the incident when interviewed on television by the BBC were met with utter revulsion.\\" He said that he had received intelligence that the Hunyani was being used for military purposes. Nkomo said he regretted the deaths as it was not his party's policy to kill civilians, and denied that his men had killed any survivors on the ground; by contrast, he said that his men had helped them, and had left them alive. He also accused Air Rhodesia of surreptitiously hauling troops and war materiel for the government, an allegation that Captain Pat Travers, Air Rhodesia's general manager, called a \\"downright, deliberate lie\\". According to Eliakim Sibanda, a professor and human rights speaker who wrote a history of ZAPU, Nkomo was implying that responsibility for the massacre lay with security force pseudo-guerrillas, more specifically the Selous Scouts unit, which had often been accused of brutalising rural civilians with the goal of shifting public opinion. Sibanda asserts that the massacre \\"cannot be put beyond\\" the Scouts, and also supports Nkomo's claim that the Hunyani had been used militarily, suggesting that ZIPRA might have believed there to be Rhodesian soldiers on board. \\"Rhodesian television, before attacks on ZANLA in Mozambique, had shown Viscounts ferrying paratroopers for the job,\\" he writes, \\"... [and] ZIPRA intelligence knew there were paratroopers stationed [at Victoria Falls]\\". Reactions =Racial tensions= A report published in the American magazine Time a fortnight later described the incident as \\"a genuine horror story, calculated to make the most alarming of Rhodesian doomsday prophecies seem true.\\" The white community in Rhodesia heard the news with fury, and many turned their minds to exacting retribution for what they and many others saw as an act of terrorism.; ; ; The prominent Indian-Rhodesian Gulab family was particularly affected by the incident, having lost eight members in the attack.; Although Rhodesian authorities did not immediately acknowledge the cause of the crash, doing so only after four days' investigation, the truth was common knowledge in Salisbury within hours. Smith wrote in his memoirs that the \\"degree of anger ... [was] difficult to control\\". White South Africans were similarly enraged, particularly after reports appeared in the South African press that the killers had raped the female passengers before massacring them. A Friends of Rhodesia Society in South Africa offered a reward of R100,000 to anybody who would either kill Nkomo or bring him to Salisbury to stand trial. Geoffrey Nyarota, who was then one of the few black reporters at the Rhodesia Herald newspaper, later wrote in his memoirs that many whites became resentful and wary towards blacks in general, believing them all to be \\"terrorist sympathisers\\". Describing the Herald newsroom the night of the incident, he relates a \\"vile collective temper\\" among the white sub-editors: \\"They cursed until their voices became hoarse, threatening dire consequences for all \\"terrs\\" and \\"munts\\" or \\"kaffirs\\"... I sensed that some of the more derogatory remarks made in unnecessarily loud voices that evening were meant specifically for my ears.\\", stress in original Several racially motivated incidents occurred over the following days. According to the Time article, a group of whites entered an unsegregated Salisbury bar \\"fingering the triggers of rifles\\" and forced blacks drinking there to leave. Time also reported a rumour that two white youths, on learning of the massacre, shot the first black man they saw. Smith says that several would-be vigilante groups sought his permission to venture into the bush around the crash site to \\"make the local people pay for their crime of harbouring and assisting the terrorists\\". He instructed them not to, according to his memoirs, telling them that many rural blacks only assisted the guerrillas under extreme duress, and that it would not do to attack them. Many Rhodesians also resented the apparent lack of sympathy emanating from overseas governments, especially considering the character of the attack and its civilian target. =Memorial service, 8 September 1978= alt=A small stone cathedral, viewed from across the street At a memorial service held on 8 September 1978 for Flight 825's passengers and crew at Salisbury's Anglican Cathedral, about 2,000 people crowded inside, with another 500 standing outside on the steps and pavement, many listening to the service inside on portable radio sets. Prominent among those present in the cathedral were uniformed Air Rhodesia and South African Airways personnel, as well as Rhodesian Special Air Service soldiers and senior officers from other military units. Smith and several government ministers also attended, including P K van der Byl, the co-Minister of Foreign Affairs. Dean John de Costa gave a sermon damning what he described as a \\"deafening silence\\" from overseas. \\"Nobody who holds sacred the dignity of human life can be anything but sickened at the events attending the Viscount\\", he said. \\"But are we deafened with the voice of protest from nations who call themselves civilised? We are not! Like men in the story of the Good Samaritan, they pass by on the other side... The ghastliness of this ill-fated flight from Kariba will be burnt upon our memories for years to come. For others, far from our borders, it is an intellectual matter, not one which affects them deeply. Here is the tragedy!\\" =Smith‚ÄìNkomo talks halted= The talks between Smith and the ZAPU leader that had been progressing so promisingly were immediately halted by Salisbury. Smith himself called Nkomo a \\"monster\\". Cilliers comments that the ending of the Smith‚ÄìNkomo talks at this time was \\"potentially the most serious result of the Viscount massacre\\", as the talks had been progressing well before the incident. He surmises that an agreement between the two \\"at this critical stage\\" might have helped the transitional Rhodesian government to secure international recognition. On 10 September, the Prime Minister announced to the nation that certain areas of the country would be placed under a variation of martial law, which he said would be applied in particular regions as and when needed. He declared Rhodesia's intent to \\"liquidate the internal workings of those organisations associated with terrorism\\", and warned neighbouring countries to prepare for \\"any defensive strikes we might undertake\\" against guerrilla bases in their respective territories. He claimed that the war had escalated because Britain and the United States were supporting the Patriotic Front. William Irvine, the co-Minister of Transport, warned the guerrillas that Rhodesia \\"w[ould] not let these innocents go unavenged\\". Rhodesian military response =Operation Snoopy= Because ZAPU and ZIPRA were based in Zambia, many Rhodesians clamoured for a massive retaliatory strike against terrorist targets in that country, but the first external target hit by the security forces following the Viscount shootdown was the prominent cluster of ZANLA bases around Chimoio in Mozambique. The Rhodesian military had struck these bases extensively in November 1977 during Operation Dingo, destroying much of the ZANLA presence there, but the insurgents had since built a complex called \\"New Chimoio\\", slightly to the east; the new camps were distributed across a far larger area than the originals. In a combined airborne-ground assault called Operation Snoopy, the Rhodesian Air Force, Rhodesian Light Infantry and Special Air Service wiped out much of New Chimoio on 20 September 1978. Mozambique sent armour to ZANLA's aid in the form of nine Soviet-made T-54 tanks and four Russian BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers, but the former were routed and one of the latter destroyed by the Rhodesian security forces. According to Rhodesian figures, there were \\"several hundred\\" guerrillas killed, while the security forces lost only two soldiers, one of whom was accidentally killed by a friendly air strike. Rhodesia then attacked ZIPRA's bases in Zambia, in what Group Captain Peter Petter-Bowyer later described as \\"payback time\\" for Flight 825. =Operation Gatling= Operation Gatling was launched on 19 October 1978. It was another joint-force operation between the Air Force and the Army, which contributed Rhodesian Special Air Service and Rhodesian Light Infantry paratroopers. Operation Gatling's primary target, just north-east of central Lusaka, was the formerly white-owned Westlands Farm, which had been transformed into ZIPRA's main headquarters and training base under the name \\"Freedom Camp\\". ZIPRA presumed that Rhodesia would never dare to attack a site so close to Lusaka. About 4,000 guerrillas underwent training at Freedom Camp, with senior ZIPRA staff also on site. The Rhodesian operation's other targets were Chikumbi, north of Lusaka, and Mkushi Camp; all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across Zambia. Assaulting targets deep inside Zambia was a first for the Rhodesian forces; previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked. Led by Squadron Leader Chris Dixon, who identified himself to Lusaka Airport tower as \\"Green Leader\\", a Rhodesian Air Force group flew into Zambia at very low altitudes (thereby avoiding Zambian radar) and took control of the country's airspace for about a quarter of an hour during the initial assault on Westlands Farm, informing Lusaka tower that the attack was against \\"Rhodesian dissidents, and not against Zambia\\", and that Rhodesian Hawker Hunters were circling the Zambian airfields under orders to shoot down any fighter that attempted to take off. The Zambians obeyed all of Green Leader's instructions, made no attempt to resist and temporarily halted civil air traffic. Using Rufunsa airstrip in eastern Zambia as a forward base, the Rhodesian military suffered only minor casualties during the three-day operation, and afterwards claimed to have killed over 1,500 ZIPRA personnel, as well as some Cuban instructors. Historians Paul Moorcraft and Peter McLaughlin write that this exaggerated considerably the number of guerrillas killed, as most of Nkomo's army, then numbering about 10,000 fighters, had not been touched. On the other hand, unarmed refugees often camped in or around insurgent positions, and hundreds of these had been killed in the Rhodesian raid. Moorcraft and McLaughlin comment that for the Rhodesian airmen, it would have been \\"impossible to distinguish innocent refugees from young ZIPRA recruits.\\" Sibanda describes Freedom Camp as \\"a refugee camp for boys\\", and says \\"351 boys and girls\\" were killed. He claims that the Red Cross and the UN Refugee Agency \\"confirmed ZAPU's claim that Smith's forces struck at defenseless, civilian trainees\\". Aftermath The Rhodesian attacks on ZANLA and ZIPRA bases did much to restore the morale of the Rhodesian people following the Viscount incident, though they had not made much impact on the respective guerrilla campaigns. Nkomo and the Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda all the same requested further military aid and better weapons from the Soviets and the British respectively. Martial law was quickly extended across Rhodesia's rural areas, and covered three-quarters of the country by the end of 1978. Air Rhodesia, meanwhile, began developing shielding for its Viscounts. Before this work was completed, ZIPRA shot down a second Viscount, Air Rhodesia Flight 827, on 12 February 1979. This time there were no survivors. Following the second shootdown, Air Rhodesia created a system whereby the underside of the Viscounts would be coated with paint, with the exhaust pipes concurrently shrouded. According to tests conducted by the Air Force, a Viscount so treated could not be detected by the Strela's targeting system once it was over . There were no further Viscount shootdowns in Rhodesia. In the elections held the following year under the Internal Settlement terms, boycotted by ZANU and ZAPU, Muzorewa won a majority, and became the first Prime Minister of the reconstituted, state of Zimbabwe Rhodesia on 1 June 1979. This new order failed to win international acceptance, however, and in December 1979 the Lancaster House Agreement was agreed in London by Zimbabwe Rhodesia, the UK government and the Patriotic Front, returning the country to its former colonial status. The UK government suspended the constitution and took direct control for an interim period. Fresh elections were won by Mugabe, who took power in April 1980, concurrently with the country's recognised independence as Zimbabwe. Legacy and memorial Labour MP Kate Hoey, who in 2013 proposed to memorialise the victims of the Viscount attacksalt=A photograph of Kate Hoey In modern Zimbabwe, it is not the Viscount shootdowns but rather the retributory Rhodesian strikes against nationalist guerrilla camps that endure predominantly in the cultural memory. State media in Zimbabwe, prominently the Herald newspaper, often claim that Rhodesian forces indiscriminately and deliberately slaughtered thousands of helpless refugees during such operations. ZIPRA's downing of civilian planes is meanwhile portrayed as a legitimate act of war on the grounds that the guerrillas might have believed them to have military personnel or equipment on board. The massacre of surviving Flight 825 passengers at the crash site is often omitted or attributed to forces other than ZIPRA; in his 1984 memoirs Nkomo repeated his claim that ZIPRA fighters had helped the survivors, and wrote simply that \\"I truly have no idea how the ten died\\". A monument to those killed in the Rhodesian attack on Chikumbi was built in Zambia in 1998, and dedicated jointly by the Zambian and Zimbabwean governments.; A memorial to the victims of the two Rhodesian Viscount incidents, dubbed the Viscount Memorial, was erected on the grounds of the Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria, South Africa, in 2012, and inaugurated on 1 September that year. The names of the dead passengers and crew are engraved on two granite slabs that stand upright, side by side, the pair topped by an emblem symbolising an aircraft. A pole beside the monument flies the Rhodesian flag.; A British parliamentary motion put forward by Labour MP Kate Hoey in February 2013 to retrospectively condemn the Viscount attacks and memorialise the victims on the anniversary of the second shootdown prompted outcry in the Zimbabwean press, with the Herald branding it a racist \\"Rhodie motion\\" intended to antagonise the Mugabe administration and its supporters. Dumiso Dabengwa, a former ZIPRA commander, described the move as a provocation motivated by race that went against the spirit of the amnesty enacted at Lancaster House. Christopher Mutsvangwa, a diplomat and political analyst, took a similar line, calling Hoey's proposed commemoration \\"a provocation ... [that] means they only regard the death of white people alone during the struggle. There is no mention of what happened to our sons and daughters in and outside the country.\\" ZAPU's official response to Hoey's motion included the assertion that in all conflicts \\"civilians get caught up in cross-fires due to faulty intelligence reports and other communication errors\\", and juxtaposed the civilians killed in the Viscount shootdowns with those killed at Chikumbi.

The medical center is municipally owned by NYC Health + Hospitals. Lincoln is known for innovative programs addressing the specific needs of the community it serves, aggressively tackling such issues as asthma, obesity, cancer, diabetes and tuberculosis. Staffed by a team of more than 300 physicians, the hospital has an inpatient capacity of 347 beds, including 20 neonatal intensive care beds, 23 intensive care beds, 8 pediatric intensive care beds, 7 coronary care beds, and an 11-station renal dialysis unit. With over 144,000 emergency department visits annually, Lincoln has the busiest single site emergency department in New York City and the third busiest in the nation.  History  Lincoln Hospital was founded in 1839 as \\"The Home for the Colored Aged\\" by a group of prominent philanthropists known as the \\"Society for the Relief of Worthy Aged Indigent Colored Persons.\\" The hospital's function gradually became the most important aspect of the operation, and in 1882, the name was changed to \\"The Colored Home and Hospital.\\" In 1895, after more than half a century of occupying various sites in Manhattan, the Board of Trustees purchased a large lot in the South Bronx‚Äîthen a semi-rural area of the city‚Äîat the corner of 141st Street and Southern Boulevard. A new hospital was built; its facilities included the latest developments in medical care. The dedication took place on April 29, 1899. The hospital became a general hospital open to all people without regard to color or creed, although it maintained its founding connection as an institution dedicated to the relief and advancement of black people. During the hospital's reorganization and eventual occupation of the new site, its name was changed to Lincoln Hospital, in honor of president Abraham Lincoln. left Because of the increasing demand for services required by a more densely populated South Bronx‚Äîand a decreasing supply of philanthropic funds‚Äîin 1925 the Board of Trustees decided to sell Lincoln Hospital to the Department of Public Welfare of the City of New York. The great outflow of physicians to the armed forces during World War II and the drastic socioeconomic decline in the area that followed took their toll on Lincoln Hospital. With the loss of jobs from industrial restructuring, new immigrants and migrants from mostly poor, rural areas of the southern regions of the United States, the Caribbean, and Latin America did not have the steady (but low skilled) labor opportunities of prior generations of immigrants. Their long-term standard of living was impacted. The shift in population ushered in changes at Lincoln Hospital. In 1969, a 15-day takeover of the Department of Psychiatry by predominantly Black and Puerto Rican non- professional staff, marked Lincoln Hospital as a key figure in the birth of the community mental health movement. The occupiers criticized the paternalism of the white psychiatrists and challenged community mental health to be more than urban-serving institutions being dominated by well meaning elites who were neither sufficiently responsive to - nor aware of - the needs of poor urban patients. The next year, on July 14, 1970, the Young Lords - a radical group of Puerto Rican activists - occupied Lincoln Hospital‚Äôs administrative building to protest the city‚Äôs indifference to the health needs of Puerto Rican and African American patients. They also protested the deplorable conditions of health care delivery at Lincoln Hospital and accused the medical schools (that were paid to provide hospital interns) of prioritizing the training medical students over patient care. The protest ended in the arrest of two Young Lords. Several months later, in November 1970, the Young Lords and allies seized the Nurses‚Äô Residence building at Lincoln Hospital and won use of Lincoln‚Äôs anticipated drug-treatment funds; the use of space in the administrative building for a drug detox program; and the use of office space in the Psychiatry Department. Community control in the form of The People‚Äôs Program was launched. Lincoln Hospital enjoyed a resurgence in the 1970s as one of the finest institutions for the care of the sick and the training of professionals in the newly formed New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation. = Current campus = right In 1976, a new facility was dedicated about two miles from the \\"Old Lincoln,\\" at a construction cost of 220 million dollars. The present hospital building incorporates some of the most advanced concepts in hospital design and sophisticated equipment. It occupies five full city blocks, providing health care to the entire South Bronx community, as well as parts of Upper Manhattan. Lincoln also administers the Substance Abuse Division, located at 349 East 140th Street. In the 1990s, Lincoln became part of the North-Manhattan/South Bronx \\"Generations Plus Network\\" together with Metropolitan Hospital Center, Morrisania Diagnostic and Treatment Center, and Segundo Ruiz Belvis Diagnostic and Treatment Center. This network continues to strive to provide quality care to a diverse, multi- ethnic urban population in this era of managed care. As of 2007, Lincoln has a capacity of 347 beds. Although it constitutes 9% of the beds in the region, Lincoln caters to 31% of the health care visits of this community, where there is fewer than one primary care physician for every 4,000 people. In 2014, the facility's Emergency Department opened after undergoing a $24 million renovation and expansion project, providing a modernized, state-of-the-art department.  Services  As the busiest single site Emergency Department in New York City, Lincoln Hospital is an Adult Level I Trauma Center and a Pediatric Level II Trauma Center. The New York State Department of Health selected Lincoln as the first hospital in the South Bronx to receive designation as an official Stroke Center. The medical center also houses FDNY‚ÄìEMS Battalion 14. Residents of the South Bronx have the highest occurrence of asthma in New York City. Adult and pediatric asthma patients receive immediate attention from Lincoln's medical staff, set specifically aside in the Emergency Department's designated \\"Asthma Room\\". Adult patients are enrolled in Lincoln's Comprehensive Care for Patients with Asthma Clinic. The Lincoln Asthma and Allergy Clinic provides an individualized, multidisciplinary approach to asthma and allergy management. Lincoln's specialty diabetes clinics include adult, pediatric, pregnancy and diabetes education programs, as well as recently receiving a grant from the United Hospital Fund to implement a new health literacy program for its diabetes clinic. Disease educators can be consulted around-the-clock and diabetes case management is available for pediatric patients. Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center received high quality ratings from the New York State Department of Health from hospital profiles comparing key quality measures and treatments for specific conditions in hospitals statewide. Lincoln ranked number two for appropriate care in New York State in the areas of heart attack and heart failure care, as well as surgical infection prevention, an HHC corporate initiative. Some of Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center's specialty services include: AIDS Center; Asthma Treatment; Diabetes Treatment; Level III Perinatal Center; Regional Trauma Center; Stroke Center; Women's Health Center; Child and Teen Health Services; SAFE (SART) Center.  Research and contributions  Lincoln Hospital's location has allowed access to a unique demographic of New York City's population, with some of the city's most ill, impoverished, and violent all concentrated in its surrounding neighborhoods. Currently, its Department of Graduate Medical Education oversees nine residency programs for training physicians and dentists in emergency medicine, general surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics & gynecology, pediatrics, oral maxillofacial surgery, general dentistry, a transitional year, and preliminary medicine programs. The hospital has vastly contributed to the medical community in various fields of study, most notably in public health, infectious disease, trauma (medicine), and emergency medicine. reported the value of immediate emergency department thoracotomy in a patient group of fatally penetrating trauma. Other studies have improved the diagnosis and management of gunshot wounds, rectal and genitourinary injuries, as well as \\"scoop and run\\" utility in prompt and emergency care in unstable patients. More recent research has examined oxygen delivery in trauma patients, looking at biomarkers and physiological parameters such as organ-specific pHi monitoring., \\"damage-control surgery in life-threatening injuries, the importance of measuring intra-abdominal pressure, the concept of intraabdominal hypertension as a prelude to the morbid abdominal compartment syndrome, and pioneering \\"open-abdomen\\" management.{sfn}Ivatury/Porter/Simon, Ivatury {sfn} Ivatury. The only text book on penetrating trauma was published from Lincoln {sfn} Ivatury/Cayten Other studies have challenged the utilization of accepted predictive markers such as vital signs, and serum lactic acid levels, in trying to employ the use of end-tidal carbon dioxide as a better diagnostic and prognostic marker in penetrating trauma patients. Lincoln has also tackled many public health issues, such as helping recognize healthcare disparities among inner-city minority New Yorkers, as well as eliminating systemic barriers for preventative care measures in one of the nation's poorest census tracts. The hospital has also approached issues such as violence prevention, bullying, child abuse, and counseling and treatment of at-risk youth. Every year the hospital also holds the prestigious Lincoln Annual Research Symposium where over a hundred research projects are presented in competition. This event is judged by a panel of distinguished clinicians from most major New York City hospitals, including Columbia University, Cornell University, and Montefiore Medical Center.

The ship entered service in 1935 and participated in the Second World War. When war was declared in September 1939, all of the Le Fantasques were assigned to the which was tasked to hunt down German commerce raiders and blockade runners. Le Triomphant and two of her sister ships were based in Dakar, French West Africa, to patrol the Central Atlantic for several months in late 1939. They returned to Metropolitan France before the end of the year and were transferred to French Algeria in late April 1940 in case Italy decided to enter the war. Le Triomphant played a minor role in the Norwegian Campaign in late April and was under repair when the Germans invaded France in May. She sailed to Britain to avoid capture in June. The ship was seized by the British in early July and was transferred to the Free French in August. After a refit, Le Triomphant began escorting convoys before the end of 1940 and was transferred to the Pacific Ocean in mid-1941. Later that year, she received orders to return to the Mediterranean in December, but they were cancelled when the Pacific War began on 8 December. Aside from a refit that lasted 10 months, the ship was on convoy escort duties until late 1943. Ordered again to return to the Mediterranean, Le Triomphant was badly damaged by a typhoon in the Indian Ocean and had to be sent to the United States for permanent repairs and modernization that lasted until mid-1945. The ship was sent to French Indochina after the Japanese surrender in September to provide support for the French forces there. After returning to Metropolitan France in mid-1946, she was intermittently active until late 1949. Le Triomphant was placed in reserve at that time and was sold for scrap in 1957. Design and description The Le Fantasque-class ships were designed to counter the fast Italian light cruisers and one member of the class, , set a world record for a ship with a conventional hull that was in excess of . They had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draft of .Jordan & Moulin, pp. 137, 139‚Äì140 The ships displaced at standardChesneau, p. 268 and at deep load. Le Triomphant was powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce , which would propel the ship at . During her sea trials on 26 November 1935, her turbines provided and she reached for a single hour. The Parsons turbines were more economical than the Rateau-Bretagne turbines which gave those ships equipped with them a range of versus at . The crew of the Le Fantasque class consisted of 11 officers and 221 crewmen in peacetime and the number of the latter increased to 254 in wartime.Jordan & Moulin, pp. 140, 143‚Äì144 The main armament of the Le Fantasques consisted of five Canon de Mod√®le 1929 guns in single mounts, one superfiring pair fore and aft of the superstructure and the fifth gun abaft the aft funnel. Their anti-aircraft (AA) armament consisted of two Canon de Mod√®le 1925 guns in single mounts positioned amidships and four Hotchkiss Mitrailleuse de CA Mod√®le 1929 in two twin-gun mounts aft of the 37 mm mounts. The ships carried three above-water triple sets of torpedo tubes; the aft mount could traverse to both sides, but the forward mounts were positioned one on each broadside. A pair of depth charge chutes were built into their stern; these housed a total of sixteen depth charges with another dozen available in the torpedo magazine. They could also be fitted with rails capable of handling 40 naval mines.Jordan & Moulin, pp. 145‚Äì151 =Modifications= In April 1939, the bridge wings were enlarged to accommodate the Hotchkiss machine guns on Le Triomphant, and . After the war began, 200 kg depth-charge stowage increased to 48 and a pair of rails were installed on the stern for depth charges. Each rail could accommodate 3 depth charges and 15 more were stored in the magazine. In early 1940 twin-gun 37 mm mounts replaced the single-gun mounts. Under Free French control as of 3 July, Le Triomphant was refitted in late 1940 during which she had her aft superfiring 138.6 mm gun replaced by a British 4-inch (102 mm) Mk V AA gun and a Type 128 ASDIC system that had been taken from a seized French destroyer was installed. The 35 kg depth charges and their rails were removed and the ship was fitted with four Mod√®le 1918 depth-charge throwers abreast the aft superstructure for depth charges. Two of these were stowed next to each mount and eighteen more were stowed in the magazine.Jordan & Moulin, pp. 156‚Äì157, 253 During a subsequent refit in mid-1941, the Hotchkiss machine guns were relocated to positions on the forecastle deck and their former positions were occupied by single mounts for 2-pounder () Mk II AA guns. A quadruple mount for Hotchkiss machine guns taken from the battleship was installed atop the aft superstructure and rails for 18 British Mk VIIH depth charges were installed on the stern. A fixed antenna for a Type 286M search radar was also installed. A late 1942 refit in Australia exchanged the 13.2 mm machine guns for six Oerlikon light AA guns and the Type 286M radar was replaced by a Type 290 system with a rotating antenna.Jordan & Moulin, pp. 253‚Äì256 En route to the Boston Navy Yard in 1944 for a comprehensive refit, Le Triomphant stopped in Bizerte, French Tunisia, where the British Mk V AA gun was replaced by a 138.6 mm gun from L'Audacieux. The Americans installed SA early-warning, SF surface-search and a British Type 285 fire-control radar, removed her aft torpedo tubes to save weight and converted some boiler feedwater tanks to fuel oil to improve her range. Her AA armament had been removed earlier and now consisted of six Bofors guns in a twin-gun mount superfiring over the aft 138.6 mm guns, and two other twin mounts forward of the aft funnel; she now carried eleven Oerlikon guns in single mounts, four on the sides of the bridge and the remaining guns on platforms on the aft superstructure, on the quarterdeck, and where the aft torpedo mount had been.Jordan & Moulin, pp. 268‚Äì275 Construction and career Ordered on 22 May 1931 as part of the 1930 Naval Program, Le Triomphant was laid down on 28 August 1931 by Ateliers et Chantiers de France at their shipyard in Dunkerque. She was launched on 16 April 1934, commissioned on 31 December 1935, completed on 25 May 1936 and entered service on 24 July. Completion was delayed when her turbines stripped some of their blades and required lengthy repairs. When the Le Fantasques entered service they were assigned to the newly formed 8th and 10th Light Divisions () which were later redesignated as scout divisions (); both divisions were assigned to the 2nd Light Squadron () in Brest. As of 1 October 1936 Le Triomphant, L'Indomptable and Le Malin were assigned to the 8th Light Division while , Le Terrible and belonged to the 10th. Between 15 January and 26 February 1937, the 2nd Light Squadron cruised as far south as Conakry, French West Africa. On 27 May, Alphonse Gasnier-Duparc, Minister of the Navy, reviewed the fleet, including all of the Le Fantasques.Jordan & Moulin, pp. 138‚Äì139, 214‚Äì215 =World War II= Both the 8th and 10th Scout Divisions were assigned to the at Brest when war was declared in September 1939; it made only a single sortie as a complete unit on 2‚Äì6 September when it responded to an erroneous report that German ships had left port. Afterwards it was dispersed into smaller groups to search for German commerce raiders and blockade runners.Jordan & Moulin, p. 222 During 21‚Äì30 October, the , including all of the Le Fantasques, screened Convoy KJ 4 against a possible attack by the heavy cruiser . On 25 November the 8th Scout Division, consisting of Le Triomphant, L'Indomptable, and Le Malin, rendezvoused with the battleship and escorted her to Brest.Rohwer, pp. 7, 9 Her sister, , sailed for Canada on 11 December with a cargo of gold and she was escorted for the next two days by Le Triomphant, Le Terrible, , and .Jordan & Dumas, p. 69 In anticipation of an Italian declaration of war, the , including the 8th Scout Division, assembled in Mers- el-K√©bir, French Algeria, on 5‚Äì9 April 1940, only to return to Brest when the Germans invaded Norway on the 10th. On the night of 23/24 April 1940, the 8th Scout Division made a high-speed patrol of the Skaggerak, hoping to attack German merchantmen headed for Norway. They encountered two patrol boats and damaged one of them while also engaging a pair of S-boats to little effect and narrowly missed spotting a convoy of minelayers. Le Malin then began experiencing engine problems and the ships were forced to reduce speed. Near- misses by German bombers damaged one of Le Triomphants propeller shafts as they withdrew and she returned to Lorient on 30 April for repairs.Jordan & Moulin, pp. 226‚Äì227, 231 As the Germans advanced in France and threatened the harbors in Brittany, the ship departed for Plymouth on 21 June. Free French service Le Triomphant having her bow painted by her crew in late 1940 On 3 July she was seized by the British at Plymouth as part of Operation Catapult, but the ship was turned over to the FNFL on 28 August and Commander () Philippe Auboyneau assumed command of the ship. She was partially refitted with British equipment in September‚ÄìOctober and recommissioned on 23 October, although the ship was not ready to go back to sea until November when she was assigned to the 11th Escort Group, based on the Firth of Clyde in western Scotland. Le Triomphant had constant problems with her propulsion machinery and propeller shafts during this time, which were aggravated when she broke loose from her mooring in Greenock during a gale in February 1941 and collided with a cargo ship. The ship received a major refit at HM Dockyard, Devonport in May‚ÄìJuly to prepare her for service in the Pacific Ocean for which she departed on 31 July via the Panama Canal.Bertrand, p. 154; Jordan & Moulin, p. 250 As Le Triomphant passed through the canal on 16 August, she was recognised and reported by a Japanese observer, whose transmission was intercepted by Magic. The ship reached San Diego on 25 August and received some minor repairs before she sailed for Tahiti on 5 September. Le Triomphant transported Georges Thierry d'Argenlieu, the Free French High Commissioner for the Pacific during this voyage and reached Papeete harbor on 23 September. The ship spent the next month visiting many of the islands of French Polynesia and British Fiji before arriving back in Papeete on 22 October. Starboard aft quarter view of Le Triomphant At that time, she received orders from the Admiralty to return to the Mediterranean and to be at Suez, Egypt, no later than 13 December. While leaving Wellington, New Zealand, Le Triomphant was damaged by a violent and sudden gust of wind and was under repair in Sydney, Australia, on 8 December when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.Bertrand, p. 154 In mid- December, she escorted the troopship from Sydney to Noum√©a, New Caledonia,Waters, p. 255 and conducted other escort missions during this time. In late February 1942, as a Japanese invasion of Nauru and Ocean Island was feared, Le Triomphant helped to evacuate the small military contingent and the European and Chinese workers from both islands. The ship resumed her earlier duties before she began a refit at the Garden Island Dockyard in Sydney on 19 March. Completion of the refit was delayed by the heavy workload there and it was not finished until 20 January 1943. Le Triomphant was reassigned to escort duties, mostly between Sydney and Melbourne and she rescued survivors of the torpedoed BHP Shipping iron ore carrier off Cape Howe on 8 February. Between 10 February and 23 May, the ship conducted 19 escort missions before entering Williamstown Dockyard in Melbourne for the installation of her port propeller chase on 26 May. Le Triomphant resumed escort missions after the installation was completed on 17 June and Captain () Paul Ortoli relieved Auboyneau in July. The ship was overhauled again in Sydney from 8 September to 7 November. She was reclassified as a light cruiser on 28 September.Bertrand, pp. 154, 156; Jordan & Moulin, pp. 250, 261 On 24 November, a five-man liaison team from the Royal Australian Navy boarded the ship in Melbourne. Le Triomphant departed Fremantle the following day to return to the Mediterranean, accompanied by the American oil tanker . A few days later, an accident while starting to refuel damaged the oil transfer gear, which meant that the cruiser only had of fuel in her tanks; to conserve fuel, Cedar Mills started towing Le Triomphant. The transfer gear was finally repaired on 1 December and she was able to top off her oil tanks. During the night of 2/3 December, the ships were struck by a typhoon and Le Triomphant was badly damaged. She took on a 15 degree list and her forward boiler and engine rooms were flooded. After taking off some of the crew, Cedar Mills was able to re-establish the tow on 5 December. The heavy cruiser took over the task and towed the large destroyer to Diego Suarez, French Madagascar, on 19 December. Temporary repairs there took until 21 February 1944 when she sailed for Boston, Massachusetts, for permanent repairs that lasted for a year after her arrival there on 12 April.Jordan & Moulin, p. 250 En route, Le Triomphant stopped at Algiers where she was inspected by General Charles de Gaulle, leader of the Free French, and the High Commissioner for the Navy, Louis Jacquinot. Ordered to the Indian Ocean in 1945, she served with the Eastern Fleet after her arrival in Colombo, Ceylon, on 27 May. After a brief refit in Diego Suarez in July, she covered the British occupation of Singapore in early September together with the .Jordan & Moulin, p. 279 =Postwar activities= Le Triomphant was the first French warship to deploy to French Indochina after the war, arriving in Saigon on 3 October 1945 and alternated with Le Fantasque in providing gunfire support to the French garrison at Nha Trang and then supporting French forces on the coast of the Gulf of Tonkin until February 1946. On 6 March she led a convoy to Haiphong which the French were to take over from the Chinese, but they engaged the convoy for 20 minutes before a cease-fire could be negotiated. Le Triomphant was lightly damaged, but 8 of her crew had been killed and 39 wounded. The sisters participated in a naval review in Ha Long Bay on 24 March before Le Triomphant departed for France on 9 April where she arrived at Toulon on 16 May.Jordan & Moulin, pp. 279‚Äì280 The ship was reduced to reserve upon her return and was refitted at Bizerte from February to November 1947. During this time, only two of the four surviving ships of the class were active at any one time because of a shortage of trained personnel. When Le Triomphant arrived at Toulon on 7 February, she relieved Le Malin in the 10th Light Cruiser Division (). The ship on remained on active duty until she was placed in reserve at Bizerte on 1 November 1949. Le Triomphant was sold for scrap in December 1957 and was subsequently broken up.Jordan & Moulin, pp. 280, 282 References Bibliography   * Category:Le Fantasque-class destroyers Category:World War II destroyers of France Category:1934 ships Category:Ships built in France Category:Maritime incidents in July 1940 ","title":"French destroyer Le Triomphant"},{"id":"14002010","text":"Embrun Cathedral The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Embrun was located in southeastern France, in the mountains of the Maritime Alps, on a route that led from Gap by way of Brian√ßon to Turin. It had as suffragans the Diocese of Digne, Diocese of Antibes and Grasse, Diocese of Vence, Diocese of Gland√®ves, Diocese of Senez and Diocese of Nice. Its see was the Cathedral of N√¥tre Dame in Embrun. The former French Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Embrun was suppressed after the French Revolution. It was replaced, under the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790) by a diocese which had the same boundaries of the civil departement in which it was located. The diocese was called 'Haute-Alpes', with its center at Gap. When the Diocese of Gap was re- established in 1822 it comprised, besides the ancient Diocese of Gap, a large part of the ancient archdiocese of Embrun. The name of the metropolitan see of Embrun, however, had been absorbed in the title of the Archbishop of Aix-en- Provence and Arles, until 2007. In 2008, the title of Embrun was reattached to the Diocese of Gap by papal decree of Pope Benedict XVI.Papal bull on the Diocese of Gap website History Palladius of Embrun was a bishop of Embrun during the 6th century. Tradition ascribes the evangelization of Embrun to Saints Nazarius and Celsus, martyrs under emperor Nero. Gregory of Tours states that they were martyred at Embrun. Their bodies, however, were discovered in a cemetery in Milan by Saint Ambrose. They were also drowned at Trier, on orders of the Emperor Nero. Their entire story is without historical foundation, and a mass of contradictions and improbabilities. According to another tradition, the first Bishop of Embrun, Saint Marcellus, was such a successful preacher that, by the end of his episcopacy, there was not a single pagan left in the diocese. The see became an archbishopric about 800. In 1056 Pope Victor confirmed the Archbishop of Embrun as Metropolitan of the Sees of Digne, Chorges, Solli√®s, Senez, Gland√®ves, Cimiez-Nice, Vence, and Antibes (Grasse). Bishop WinimannThe name is also spelled Viminian, Vivemnus, Wimman, Guiniman, Guitmund, and Guiriman: Fisquet, p. 843. was also granted the palliumFisquet, p. 844. It is pointed out that two of the bishoprics no longer existed in 1076, and it is suggested that the list is a later addition to the document. In 1276 the Archbishops of Embrun were made Princes of the Holy Roman Empire.

Notable Bishops of Embrun *St. Guillaume (1120‚Äì34), founder of the Abbey of Boscodon;The abbey was actually founded by Guillaume and Pierre de Montmirail in 1130; in 1132 the Benedictine Rule was adopted; in 1142 the Bishop of Embrun, another Guillaume, thought the monks so mediocre that he imported several monks from Chalais. *Henry of Segusio (1250‚Äì71), known as (H)Ostiensis, i.e. Cardinal Bishop of Ostia, an orator and canonist of renown; *Bertrand de D√©aulx (1323‚Äì38), who as the legate of Clement VI at Rome did much to bring about the downfall of Rienzi; *Giulio de' Medici (1510‚Äì11), later pope under the name of Clement VII; *Cardinal Fran√ßois de Tournon (1517‚Äì26), employed on diplomatic missions by King Francis I of France, and founder of the College de Tournon; *Cardinal de Tencin (1724‚Äì40), who in September, 1727, caused the condemnation by the Council of Embrun of the *Jansenist Soanen, Bishop of his suffragan see of Senez. *St. Vincent Ferrer preached several missions against the Vaudois in the Diocese of Embrun.

Duchesne, p. 291 n.1, who indicates that there is nothing to show that Armentarius or Jacobus were bishops of Embrun. * 439: ArmentariusIn the episcopal election at Embrun in 438, two factions elected two bishops in the midst of threats and violence, especially involving laypersons; one of the elect, Armentarius, was below the canonical age for consecration, but, without the knowledge and consent of the bishops of the province, he got two bishops somehow to consecrate him. The matter was brought to the Council of Riez, which met on 29 November 439, fourteen bishops being present. The election was annulled as uncanonical, and Armentarius, who had resigned before he received the summons to attend the Council, was treated leniently and given the status of chorepiscopus, though it was made clear that this did not involve any of the prerogatives of a legitimate bishop.

A civil rights activist, he entered state politics and served as Secretary of State of Florida for five months from 1978 to 1979, becoming the first black member of the Florida Cabinet since the end of Reconstruction. Early life and education McCrary was born in 1937 in Blitchton, Florida, the son of a Baptist preacher. He attended Howard Academy in Ocala. He was the quarterback of the school's championship football team. He was a political science major at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, where he was a civil rights activist, organizing sit-ins in Tallahassee. He was also on the debate team, a member of the drama club and an ROTC cadet. He served in the Military Intelligence Corps before graduating from Florida A&M; University College of Law with his Juris Doctor in 1965. Career In 1967, McCrary became Florida's first assistant Attorney General. He dealt with criminal appeals and advised the state Racing Commission. Three years later, he became the first black lawyer to argue a case before the Supreme Court of the United States on behalf of a Southern state (the case was Williams v. State of Florida; the court decided in favor of the state, which was seeking to uphold a law allowing six-person juries in non-capital criminal cases). In the 1970s, McCrary was a partner in the law firm McCrary, Ferguson and Leethrough. He issued a report critical of Opa- locka's government and police department, was the Dade County School Board's first black attorney, and was appointed by Governor Reubin Askew to a Florida Industrial Commission judgeship. At the time, he was Florida's highest-paid black official. After returning to private practice for five years, McCrary was appointed in 1977 to the Florida Constitution Revision Commission by Askew. The following year, Askew appointed him Secretary of State of Florida to finish the unexpired term of Bruce Smathers, who had resigned to run for governor. As Secretary of State, he recommended judicial appointees to the governor. McCrary returned to private practice in 1979 and was active in the community in the 1980s and 1990s. He represented an embattled county commissioner in a public corruption scandal. He was part of the effort to have the board allow single-member districts. In 1991, he served as the unpaid chair of a local community services organization which he saved form bankruptcy. In 2000, he was appointed to the Board of Miami Children's Hospital. In 2001, he was named to a commission that made recommendations to Senior Judge Lenore C. Nesbitt in a federal condemnation suit brought by the National Park Service to acquire land for Everglades National Park. In 2003, the Florida Legislature passed a resolution recognizing his work on ten landmark Florida Supreme Court cases.  Death  McCrary died in 2007 of lung cancer.

The bay lies off of the main Altafjorden, at the entrance to the K√•fjorden. Etymology  Hjemmeluftbukta is an often used example for how the Norwegianization of the indigenous S√°mi language names in Northern Norway have often created meaningless names. In the Northern S√°mi language the name Jiepmaluokta is \\"bay of seals\\" while the Norwegian name Hjemmeluftbukta is an adaption of the S√°mi name and is translated to \\"home air bay\\". The ending -luft (air) comes from the accusative and genitive form of the S√°mi noun luokta (bay) or \\"luovtta\\" which is pronounced \\"luofta\\". The Norwegian version's hjemme- (home) may indicate that at an earlier stage the toponym was Jiemmaluokta - the difference being that jiepma is rendered in genitive, making the name mean \\"seal's bay\\".

The species is distributed along the coast of tropical Africa in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, extending to the Mediterranean Sea. Adults live predominantly in shallow waters shallower than 70 m deep, often forming small schools. The African threadfish is similar in appearance to the closely related and co- occurring African pompano, with the slightly concave shape of the species head profile the most definitive feature of the species. Like other members of the genus Alectis, the juveniles of the species have long trailing dorsal and anal fins. The African threadfish is of minor commercial importance, and is also considered to be a game fish. Taxonomy and naming The African threadfish is one of three members of the diamond trevally genus Alectis, which is one of 33 genera in the jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae. The Carangidae are part of the order Carangiformes. The species has a complex taxonomic history, which is based on only two scientific descriptions. The first description was made by the French naturalist √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1817, in which he named the species Gallus alexandrinus, using the generic name Gallus which had been created by Lac√©p√®de after he recognised the genus distinct from Zeus, a genus of dories. However, Gallus was preoccupied by a bird, leading to the reassignment of the species to at least six different genera, before the species was placed in Alectis. The second description was made by Georges Cuvier in 1833 under the name of Gallichthys aegyptiacus. This name was also re-evaluated twice, before the description was discarded as a junior synonym of A. alexandrina. The species has also been incorrectly referred to as Alectis alexandrinus. However the genus is feminine and so alexandrina is the correct spelling. The common names 'African threadfish' and 'Alexandria pompano' are in reference to the species prominent distribution around Africa, as well as the thread like appearance of the juveniles dorsal and anal fins. Description African threadfish have a slight concavity to their forehead profileThe African threadfish has the typical body structure of a large jack, with a distinctly angular, strongly compressed body. The major identifying feature of the species is its head profile, having a slight concavity near the eyes which distinguishes it from the African pompano. The dorsal profile of the fish is more curved than the ventral profile, and the body is deepest between the origins of the soft dorsal and soft anal fins. The first section of the dorsal fin consists of 5 to 7 visible spines, with the second section having one spine and 20 to 22 soft rays. The anal fin has two spines followed by a single spine and 18 or 19 soft rays. The pectoral fin is long and curved, extending beyond the junction of the straight and curved sections of the lateral line. Anterior to the caudal fin are two oblate keels on each side of the line of scutes. The body appears to be scaleless, but on closer inspection has minute, deeply embedded scales. The lateral line is strongly curved anteriorly, with a section of 6 to 11 scutes toward the tail. Juveniles and often adults have long, filamentous trailing first anal and dorsal fin spines, a trait of all members of Alectis. The species grows to at least 1 m in length. The African threadfish is silver in colour, often with blue and greenish tints and reflection, especially when fresh. The fins are all a pale silvery green to blue colour, or hyaline. Juveniles may show two dark bands on their lower bodies. Distribution and habitat The African threadfish is primarily distributed throughout the tropical eastern Atlantic Ocean, inhabiting the waters of West Africa from Morocco around to Angola. The species also has had several individuals taken from the Mediterranean and one extreme capture in the Adriatic Sea. Adults are generally solitary in coastal waters, occupying lower parts of the water column, down to at least 70 m. Juveniles are usually pelagic and drift with ocean currents, sometimes ending up in estuarine environments. Biology Limited information is available on the species biology, with only the diet of the species confirmed. The African threadfish feeds on squid and other fishes. The reproduction in the species is largely unknown, but observations on Alectis ciliaris suggest individual fish may pair and then spawn. Relationship to humans African threadfish taken off Ghana The species is of minor importance to local fisheries throughout its range, and is also considered a good game fish, especially in larger sizes. The species is rarely targeted by anglers though, due to its comparative rarity. The fish also fetches high prices at market, unlike many other members of the Carangidae. The IGFA world record for the species stands at 8.10 kg (17 lb 3oz) caught off of Daklha, Morocco in 1993.

During active service Le Triomphant had suffered a nuclear leak from one of her nuclear warheads by the end of 1997 and from her reactor in 2004, though the FOST downplayed the incidents and stated no radiation had been released since the reactor had been non-operational at the time. The vessel carries sixteen strategic missiles, which launching can only be authorized by the President of France. History =Construction and testing= The first metal of Le Triomphant was cut at DCN Cherbourg in October 1986, and the boat's engine was shipped to the boat from DCN Indret five years later. The reactor was built into the vessel in August 1991, with the fore and aft sections being welded on in January and April 1992 respectively. The boat was armed and given a commander in May 1992 and moved from the assembly site to the completion basin in July 1993. The boat's launching in March 1994 was followed by the first dive that June and the trip from DCN Cherbourg to lle Longue that July down the \\"free route\\" between Cherbourg and Brest, with a crew of 110 and engineers from DCN Cherbourg. On 4 January 1995, during testing, the boat reached maximum depth for the first time and made the first firing of a ballistic missile the following month. Photographs of the boat were exhibited to the Senate of France from 15 to 23 May 1995. In June, the boat set off back to Cherbourg for Post-Testing Upgrades (Remises A Niveau Apr√®s Essais or RANAE), then set off for a second set of trials, making 1,300 hours of test dives in total and a five-week trip. The boat then spent five weeks in maintenance at Cherbourg and during the main weapons tests took on 11 torpedo models, five trial torpedoes and one Exocet SM39 exercise. As a deterrent system, a salvo of 15 models was successfully launched and, in the last round of development, the boat functioned successfully as a missile platform. =Characteristics=  Conventional and nuclear armament Le Triomphant entered active service in March 1997. On 18 October 2001, the fleet support service notified the DCN that Triomphant was about to take the first period of Unavailability for Maintenance and Repairs (IPER or Indisponibilit√© pour Entretien et R√©parations). The 150 million Euro contract was granted to DCN, with the IPER starting at Ile Longue on 2 April 2002, scheduled for 29 months in all. In this, the boat's first major refit, the missiles and the fuel elements of the nuclear boiler were disembarked. In August 2004 L'Humanit√© ran a piece with the headline \\"Pas si Triomphant que √ßa\\" reporting that Le Triomphant had suffered a nuclear leak from one of her nuclear warheads by the end of 1997 and from her reactor in 2004, though the FOST downplayed the incidents and stated no radiation had been released since the reactor had been non-operational at the time. Le Triomphant carried out a test flight of a M45 strategic missile on 1 February 2005 in the Atlantic. Since 1972, patrols by Submarines forces are conducted 24/7 365/year, embarking each sixteen strategic missiles, which launching can only be authorized by the President of France, and which could destroy 96 targets with an equivalent effect of a hundred times the explosions of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. = Active service = In the night between 3-4 February 2009, Le Triomphant collided with the Royal Navy submarine . Triomphant was reported to have proceeded to Brest under the boat's own power, submerged, to assess damages around the sonar area. Obviously on both boats, no damages were incurred on the nuclear installations. The French Navy at first claimed that Le Triomphant had collided with a container. After Vanguard returned to harbour, it was confirmed that the light brief contact collision was in fact with the designated boat.

The first pharmacies received royal permit when they were established, and in 1600 it was decided that only private individuals trained as pharmacists could own a pharmacy, and would receive a monopoly in their area. This concept was kept for more than 400 years. The first dispansasion from this was given in 1856 when Rikshospitalet was given permission to establish a hospital pharmacy owned by the state. In 1950 a general permission for the state and municipalities to own hospital pharmacies was given. In 1957 the government created Norsk Medisinaldepot (NMD) that was granted the sole rights for wholesale of pharmaceutics in Norway, replacing five private wholesalers. The pharmacists on their hand owned the wholesaler of medical products, Apotekernes F√¶llesindkj√∏p, that was acquired by NMD in 1992. =Deregulation= The first deregulation was of the wholesalers in 1995. This resulted in two competitors of NMD entering the country, Apokjeden, at first owned by the pharmacists and later by Finnish Tamro, and Alliance Unichem. NMD was at first partially privatized in 1997, and then fully sold to Celesio in 2001. On March 1, 2001 a new law was passed giving the right for anyone to own a pharmacy, with the exception of medical doctors and the pharmaceutical industry. Norway went with this from having one of the most regulated to the least regulated pharmacy markets in Europe. This resulted in a huge consolidation of the pharmacy market, with vertical integration of the wholesalers and retailers. By 2007 84% of all pharmacies are wholly owned by the three wholesalers, and only 16 pharmacies remain outside the chains. At the same time the number of pharmacies has increased from about 400 to more than 600. The dominating new establishments are occurring as establishments close to established pharmacies, and is very little degree in areas without pharmacies.

Sundown was born in 1863, probably in Montana, into the visiting Wallowa Band of the Nez Perce, later led by Chief Joseph. The Nez Perce were renowned for their mastery of horses and Sundown learned how to breed and raise horses at an early age. By the age of 14 he was active in the Nez Perce War of 1877, but unlike Joseph and many of his tribesmen, Sundown escaped the U.S. Army cavalry during the Nez Perce Retreat and fled to Canada with a small group of wounded warriors. Legend holds that Sundown stayed for two years with a group of Sioux, including the iconic Sitting Bull. He was considered to be a war criminal and lived in hiding with Sitting Bull and others who played a role in the defeat of General George Custer at the Battle of Little Big Horn.National Cowboys of Color Museum and Hall of Fame ‚Äì Dallas/Ft. Worth at www.cowboysofcolor.org In 1879, Sundown returned to the U.S. and lived briefly at Nespelem, Washington, and then for many years on the Flathead Reservation in northwest Montana, where he married and had two children. He settled back in Idaho on the Nez Perce Reservation in 1910 and two years later married Cecilia Wapshela, a widow with two children and ranch owner, and they lived at her place at Jacques Spur, near Culdesac. All the while, Sundown made his living by breeding, raising, \\"breaking,\\" and selling horses. To make additional money, Sundown entered into rodeos and dominated his opponents, many of whom would withdraw after learning that he would participate. Jackson Sundown won many all-around cash pots, which takes the highest average scores from all events, though he was best known for bareback and saddle bronc horse riding. His appearance differed greatly from other rodeo riders as he wore bright colored shirts, large and elegant woolen chaps and tied his long braids under his chin. Sundown entered into rodeos across the west and in Canada into his early 50s. In 1915 at age 52, he took third place in the all-around at the Pendleton Roundup and decided to retire from rodeo, which had wrecked his body. The following year, an artist who was doing a sculpture of Sundown convinced him to enter the Roundup one last time, an offer that Sundown only accepted after the artist agreed to pay the entry fee .Alcorn,1983 Sundown was twice the age of the other semi-finalists but advanced after high scores in the saddle bronc and bareback horseriding competitions. His final ride is an event of great mythology to this day among American Indians and rodeo aficionados. It is told that Sundown drew a very fierce horse named Angel and that the horse bucked so furiously that Sundown removed his cowboy hat and fanned the horse to get it to cool off, at which time he and the horse merged into one being. Sundown won the all-around event and became immortalized as a hero of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla, which includes the Nez Perce. Sundown died of pneumonia 7 years later at the age of 60 and was buried at Slickpoo Mission Cemetery near Jacques Spur, Idaho. At the time of his death, the U.S. Government did not consider Native Americans to be American Citizens. A large gathering of Native Americans continues at the Pendleton Roundup in Pendleton, Oregon where a pow-wow is held during the Round-up in late September. Stories of Waaya-Tonah-Toesits- Kahn continue to fill the air at this event among the drumming, fry bread, gambling and rodeoing. Sundown was inducted in the National Cowboys of Color Museum and Hall of Fame in 2006. Located in Fort Worth, Texas, it is now known as the National Multicultural Western Heritage Museum. He was inducted into the Pendleton Round-Up and Happy Canyon Hall of Fame in 1972. He was inducted into the Rodeo Hall of Fame of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in 1976.

Written in the Python programming language, it is able to run on POSIX systems that have an interface to a packet-control system or firewall installed locally, for example, iptables or TCP Wrapper. Functionality Fail2Ban operates by monitoring log files (e.g. , , etc.) for selected entries and running scripts based on them. Most commonly this is used to block selected IP addresses that may belong to hosts that are trying to breach the system's security. It can ban any host IP address that makes too many login attempts or performs any other unwanted action within a time frame defined by the administrator. Includes support for both IPv4 and IPv6. Optionally longer bans can be custom-configure for \\"recidivist\\" abusers that keep coming back. Fail2Ban is typically set up to unban a blocked host within a certain period, so as to not \\"lock out\\" any genuine connections that may have been temporarily misconfigured. However, an unban time of several minutes is usually enough to stop a network connection being flooded by malicious connections, as well as reducing the likelihood of a successful dictionary attack. Fail2Ban can perform multiple actions whenever an abusive IP address is detected: update Netfilter/iptables or PF firewall rules, TCP Wrapper's table, to reject an abuser's IP address; email notifications; or any user- defined action that can be carried out by a Python script. The standard configuration ships with filters for Apache, Lighttpd, sshd, vsftpd, qmail, Postfix and Courier Mail Server. Filters are defined by Python regexes, which may be conveniently customized by an administrator familiar with regular expressions. A combination of a filter and an action is known as a \\"jail\\" and is what causes a malicious host to be blocked from accessing specified network services. As well as the examples that are distributed with the software, a \\"jail\\" may be created for any network-facing process that creates a log file of access.

The session was held at Rudy Van Gelder's Englewood Cliffs studio. The set is made up primarily of original Kirk compositions.

Rig means like rigor mortis. That's where a lot of peoples mind are. When they hear me doing things they didn't think I could do they panic in their minds\\". Kirk made many references to pioneers of jazz. \\"No Tonic Pres\\" is a reference to Lester Young; \\"From Bechet, Byas, and Fats\\" is a homage to Sidney Bechet, Don Byas, and Fats Waller; and \\"Once in a While\\" was inspired by Clifford Brown. Kirk also mentioned the work of Edgar Var√®se, the compositions Poeme electronique and Ionisation, as inspiration for the album.

In 1967, Eric Newby and his wife Wanda acquire an old run-down farmhouse in Italy, I Castagni (The Chestnuts), in the foothills of the Apuan Alps on the borders of Liguria and northern Tuscany. The book is a personal memoir of the couple's experiences in renovating the house, which had a tileless roof, a long-abandoned septic tank and a wealth of indigenous flora and fauna, as well as a vivid description of their neighbours and the lifestyle of country people in Italy at that time.  Plot summary  The Newbys want to purchase a house in Italy before house prices start rising and, through the help of contacts, finally purchase I Castagni for two and a half million lire (¬£1,500) after a long and laborious sales process with the owner, a Signor Botti. Once they move in, they have to completely renovate everything, and are beset with various problems such as mice, a plague of cockroaches and an intractable neighbour who insists on using what he sees as a right of way for agricultural machinery that passes right outside the house - he even moves their outside dining table when he finds it blocking his path. The Newbys initiate a lawsuit against him which goes on for years owing to the dilapidated Italian legal system, but which they finally manage to win as a result of the man lying before the judge. The strength of the book is in its descriptions of some of the neighbouring families and the individual family members. Their closest neighbour is a sprightly Italian widow, Signora Angiolina, who helps them navigate their way through the intricacies of social life in their neighbourhood, as well as the Dada family who own several acres of vineyards and cook stupendous meals whenever the Newbys visit them at the Casa Dada. There is a very colourful description of the vendemmia, the annual grape harvest, during which Eric is roped into lifting bigonci, large barrel-shaped vessels full of crushed grapes, that nearly break his shoulder. Although the work is hard, there are merenda, consisting of huge outside picnics at which copious quantities of food are eaten, last year's wine drunk and bawdy gossip exchanged between the contadini. Another interesting description is when the Newbys join their neighbours in the annual funghi harvest in a very bountiful year, managing to gather ten full baskets between the four of them (less successful is a harvesting of wild asparagus when Eric forgets his bifocals and cannot see anything).

Early life Lorenz Adlon (baptized Laurenz) was born in Mainz as Laurenz, the sixth out of nine children of a Catholic shoemaker, Jacob Adlon, and his wife Anna Maria Elisabeth (Schallot), an accoucheuse. His grandfather, Andreas Adlon, was an electoral groom from the Spessart region.Bernd Funke: In der Steingasse fing alles an in: Allgemeine Zeitung 4 January 2013 (German language translated) He was trained as a cabinet maker, finishing an apprenticeship in 1872 at the nationally leading Bemb√© cabinet- making workshop of Mainz. Indeed, Adlon would eventually request its services, for furnishing the future Hotel Adlon of Berlin.Lorenz Adlon - ADLON Holding GmbH (German language translated) =Private life= Lorenz Adlon was married twice. His first wife was Susanne Wannsiedel (died 1878), the daughter of a hotel manager in Mainz, they had three boys and two girls from 1872 to 1877, including a daughter Anna Katharina and a son Ludwig Anton, who together, inherited the hotel after the death of Lorenz (two others died in childhood). Adlon married again, to Fanny Claus, a widow from a prosperous Stuttgart family, who died just short time after in 1893, in Berlin. Mainz Lorenz Adlon joined a fellow student, opening a wine store together, for selling what was produced by the many regional vineyards. english During those years, Adlon couldn't resist the appeal, often visiting the Holl√§ndische Hof hotel near the Rhinefront, there taking note of the German aristocracy and its culinary customs. Adlon also was an athletic person, and ‚Äîreportedly ‚Äî he once catered his whole team, in a profitable experience which particularly fueled Adlon's dream for a gastronomic career. Lorenz Adlon got earnestly interested for gastronomy after a trip to France; after returning from the Franco-Prussian War, Adlon so started working as an innkeeper, in 1872. In 1876, Adlon accomplished his first big job in Mainz, catering the crowds during a regional shooting contest. In 1878, Lorenz Adlon opened the Raimundigarten restaurant, a wooden building, built over an abandoned fortification of Mainz, at its northwest, over the bank of the Rhine. Basically oriented for the tourism, it soon became a successful endeavor. Adlon then started exporting Bohemian Pilsener beer abroad, to both the Netherlands and Belgium. Berlin Late in the 1870s, Lorenz Adlon enthusiastically moved to Berlin, which was so attractive as the magnificent new capital of the Second Reich. Once there, Adlon began in the business of selling wines. It became so successful, that Adlon's shop of the Wilhelmstrasse would store three million bottles at some point; the value of the investment skyrocketed after a vine pest of the late 1910s, and -in general- also overmastering the German inflation. Meanwhile, Lorenz Adlon kept managing the catering for international events, in 1881 for the festival of gymnastics of Frankfurt (Deutschen Turnfest), in 1882 for the Bavarian Trade exhibition, in 1883 for Amsterdam's World's Fair. By then, Lorenz Adlon was enjoying a prosperous financial period. Subsequently, Adlon started acquiring several restaurants, one after the other. He acquired the Mille Colonnes hotel, at the Rembrandt Square of Amsterdam. By 1887, Adlon had already acquired a caf√© at the 62/63 on the patrician Unter den Linden boulevard of midtown Berlin, to Carl Hiller. In 1896, Lorenz Adlon together with two other businessmen, Hiller and Rudolf Dressel, managed the main restaurant facilities at the Neuer See, during the Universal Exposition of Berlin (Gewerbe-Ausstellung). During the event, Adlon got acquainted with the famous director of orchestra Benjamin Bilse, by whom Adlon got properly introduced to the high society of Berlin. Lorenz Adlon then took over Hiller's restaurant at the 55 Unter den Linden boulevard. The place already was leading because of its French dishes, and during Adler's management, it became the most exclusive restaurant in Berlin; Adlon then was a recognized socialite. In 1898, Adlon entered into partnership with Teilhaber Klicks, acquiring the 195-room Hotel Continental on the Georgenstra√üe street, and so Adlon perfected his skills of hotel management. In 1889, Lorenz Adlon acquired his first hotel, the Mille Colonnes, on Rembrandt Square in Amsterdam.biography of Lorenz Adlon (German language translated) In 1899, Lorenz Adlon leased the until then decadent two terraces of the zoo of Mainz. Revamped by Adlon, the place started serving famous international treats, highlighting the Bouillabaisse specialty; daily yielding 6,000 daily goldmarks, it once hosted William II, whose ensuing friendship meant Adlon's definitive belonging into the German high society. Hotel Adlon Hotel Adlon, in the 1920s *See main article: Hotel Adlon Shortly after the turn of the century, Lorenz Adlon agreed with the young emperor William II, who disliked his very traditional town palace, to establish a noble hotel in the town. By 1905, Adlon had invested all what he owned, 2 million goldmarks, for the ambitious 17-million- goldmark project. Adlon managed the process, acquiring several available properties round the 1 Unter den Linden just besides the Brandenburg Gate, despite the protests of the Berliners. The luxurious Hotel Adlon opened on October 23, 1907. Emperor William inaugurated it, and then praising that its beauty was even superior to his own Royal Palace, he patronised it regularly for his unofficial residence. At the heart of Berlin, the Adlon Hotel became the centre of the social life in the city, and it also hosted all its notable visitors. Before 1914, the aristocracy of all Europe was fond for gathering in it; then -sharing the same area with the most important embassies- the hotel hosted a series of international meetings, relevant to the historical development of the First World War. However, after the war the so supportive German monarchy was deposed, and so the magnificence of the Adlon Hotel started to dim. Death Adlons grave at the old cemetery of St. Hedwigs Berlin After the war, Lorenz Adlon remained reluctant about acknowledging the dethronement of the monarch. He refused to remove the monarch's bronze bust from the fireplace room when the emperor had already left for Holland and Philipp Scheidemann had proclaimed the republic. He refused driving through the Brandenburg Gate by the central line, which had once been reserved for the German nobility. In 1918 and 1921, he approached the middle vehicle lane in the attempt to cross the Pariser Platz. The central passage of the Brandenburg Gate was originally reserved for the emperor and therefore rarely frequented. In Adlon's mind, it had remained a safe traffic island. Adlon had suffered a severe street accident in 1918 and on 1921, at the same place, Adlon suffered a second, fatal accident, being hit by a car. (english) Ludwig Anton \\"Louis Adlon, Sr.\\" His son Ludwig Anton, born on 3 October 1874 (he called himself \\"Louis\\"), had five children with his first wife Tilly. After almost 15 years of marriage, he met a hotel guest, a dancer, the German-American Hedwig Leythen (1889-1967), called Hedda, at a New Year's Eve party in the Hotel Adlon, left his wife and children, and in 1922 he married her. It was one of the biggest scandals of Berlin in the 1920s. Tilly moved with her daughter Elisabeth, then two, to the south of Germany, while the other children Susanne (mother of Percy Adlon), Lorenz and the twins Carl and Louis (junior) were sent to boarding school and later all four emigrated to America. His son Louis continued managing the hotel until it was burned down by Soviet troops in 1945. Solveig Grothe on 2007-10-21 in Spiegel Online writes that on April 21, 1945 the first explosions hit the Unter den Linden and the hotel stopped and the Adlon became a hospital for a short time. Grothe quotes Hedda : \\"On the night of May 2, Russian tanks rattled through the Brandenburg Gate, and at eight o'clock in the morning the first Russian soldiers appeared in the Adlon. (...) The disaster began, however, when a troop of Red Army soldiers in search of valuables discovered the wine cellar,...\\" Solveig Grothe on 2007-10-21 in Spiegel Online writes that one of the Russians threw his burning cigarette into the wood wool, which was stored in the wine cellar for packaging, flames spread from the cellar, but slow enough to bring the wounded to safety. His wife Hedda Adlon relates in her autobiography that Louis himself was taken by the Soviets and shot, after they mistook him for a General because a servant called him by his title of \\"Generaldirektor\\".

As a member of the Silent Sentinels she was among the first six suffragists arrested and jailed on June 27, 1917, at the White House. She served eight jail terms for suffrage protesting: three days in June 1917; 60 days in the Occoquan prison in Virginia, from August to September 1917, for picketing; 15 days for a meeting in Lafayette Square; and five sentences of five days each in January and February 1919 for the NWP's watchfire demonstrations.

It is hosted by Exmoor Singers of London, which forms the Tallis Festival Choir for just one weekend every 12 to 18 months. The Festival always includes Thomas Tallis' Spem in alium for 40-part choir, but in addition has commissioned new 40-part works by modern composers, as companion pieces to Spem in alium. In 2007 the Festival was recognised by the BBC for its contribution to new music and highlights from the Festival were broadcast on BBC Radio 3 BBC - Radio 3 - The Choir - Exmoor Singers' Tallis Festival on 28 October 2007. The Festival originated from Tallis Performance Weekends, held periodically over a number of years. The original concept was to bring choral friends together for intense rehearsals from a Friday evening through to a public concert on the Sunday evening. Choirs of between 100 and 160 singers are formed with choral singers from around London and further afield (including France, Hungary, Finland and Japan). New 40-part choral works In 2006 a new 40-part work was commissioned, Tentatio, from Finnish composer Jaakko M√§ntyj√§rvi, and given its first performance. Tentatio, meaning Temptation, is based on a Latin biblical text about Christ spending 40 days in the wilderness and being tempted by the Devil. Instead of eight 5-part choirs as used by Tallis, M√§ntyj√§rvi wrote the work for five 8-part choirs, with the fifth choir being formed entirely of basses and baritones and depicting the devil. In 2007, another new 40-part work was commissioned, Love You Big as the Sky, from Mancunian composer Peter McGarr, which is subtitled a Lindisfarne Love Song and inspired by the island on the Northumbrian coast of England. The text is extensive and covers poems about Lindisfarne, and the detailed geography of the area, including ship wrecks and lighthouses. It is also a love song and includes text taken from a valentine's day card as part of its inspiration. The first performance of Love You Big as the Sky was broadcast in full on BBC Radio 3 as part of the Festival coverage.

During the battle the escape route of the French army under Fran√ßois Bazaine was blocked when the French encountered the First Army under von Steinmetz. The outcome of the battle itself was indecisive although the French were able to escape to Metz. Like most of the early battles of the war, Borny was one that neither side had planned or wanted. For the French, the battle had dire consequences as they neglected to use their numerical superiority to force a passage and it delayed the Army's retreat out of Metz for twelve precious hours. This gave the Prussians the time to bring up their Second army under Prince Frederick Charles and assured that after the battles fought in the following days (Mars- la-Tour and Gravelotte) France's premier army would be trapped at Metz.
