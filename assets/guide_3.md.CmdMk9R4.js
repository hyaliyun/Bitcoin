The Breakthrough Institute is \\"committed to modernizing environmentalism for the 21st century.” Founded in 2003 by Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus, Breakthrough Institute has policy programs in energy and climate, economic growth and innovation, conservation and development. It publishes a policy journal, organizes an annual conference, and offers a fellowship program for recent college graduates and graduate students. Breakthrough Institute's analyses of energy, climate, and innovation policy have been cited by The New York Times, NPR, The Wall Street Journal, and C-SPAN. Philosophically, the Breakthrough Institute is associated with ecomodernism. Breakthrough promotes technological solutions to environmental problems, especially nuclear energy and industrial agriculture.  People  Breakthrough's executive director is Ted Nordhaus. Breakthrough also has a number of senior fellows including sociologist Bruno Latour, journalist Gwyneth Cravens, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Burton Richter, political scientist Roger A. Pielke Jr., sociologist Dalton Conley, Oxford professor Steve Rayner, plant geneticist Pamela Ronald, sociologist Steve Fuller, and environmental thought leader Stewart Brand.  Programs  Breakthrough Institute maintains programs in energy, conservation, and food. Their website states that the energy research is “focused on making clean energy cheap through technology innovation to deal with both global warming and energy poverty.” The conservation work “seeks to offer pragmatic new frameworks and tools for navigating\\" the challenges of the Anthropocene, offering up nuclear energy, synthetic fertilizers, and genetically modified foods as solutions.  Publications  In 2004, Breakthrough founders Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger coauthored the essay, “Death of Environmentalism: Global Warming Politics in a Post-Environmental World.” The paper argues that traditional environmentalism must die so that a new kind of politics can be born. The essay sparked a large debate in the environmental community, which was covered by the New York Times and Salon. In 2007, Nordhaus and Shellenberger published their book Break Through: From the Death of Environmentalism to the Politics of Possibility, which was called \\"prescient\\" by Time and \\"the best thing to happen to environmentalism since Rachel Carson's Silent Spring\\" by Wired Magazine. Breakthrough has gone on to argue that climate policy should be focused on making clean energy cheap through technological innovation and has been critical of climate policies like cap and trade and carbon pricing that are focused primarily on making dirty energy expensive. Breakthrough has engaged in bipartisan efforts to produce a new strategy for climate and energy policy in the wake of cap and trade. In 2010, the Breakthrough Institute, along with the Brookings Institution and right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, published the report Post-Partisan Power, which calls for increased federal subsidies in order to make nuclear energy cheap. The report was widely praised and endorsed. Breakthrough has engaged in extensive work showing that the federal government played a crucial role in the development of major technological innovations from the iPhone to the transcontinental railroad to the shale gas revolution, with its work referenced by many including the New York Times, and President Barack Obama. In 2011, Breakthrough published its extensive investigation into the origins of today's natural gas boom, showing that the government was critical to the shale gas revolution as well. Breakthrough's findings were cited in the New York Times and by President Barack Obama in his 2012 State of the Union and were substantiated by the Associated Press as well as the American Energy Innovation Council. In 2012, Breakthrough partnered with Brookings Institution and the World Resources Institute on the report Beyond Boom and Bust which aimed to reform energy policy in order to make clean energy technologies subsidy independent. The report generated wide bipartisan interest and endorsements. Breakthrough has also authored analyses on the planetary boundaries hypothesis, promoted expansion of nuclear power, and questioned the value of energy efficiency in the context of the Rebound Effect (conservation).

Pielke, Jr., Rachel Pritzker, Joyashree Roy, Mark Sagoff, Michael Shellenberger, Robert Stone, and Peter Teague  Breakthrough Journal  In 2011, Breakthrough published the first issue of the Breakthrough Journal, which aims to “modernize political thought for the 21st century.” The New Republic called Breakthrough Journal “among the most complete efforts to provide a fresh answer to\\" the question of how to modernize liberal thought, and the National Review called it “the most promising effort at self-criticism by our liberal cousins in a long time.” Steven F. Hayward's essay “Modernizing Conservatism” received a Sidney Award from New York Times columnist David Brooks. “Conservation in the Anthropocene” by Peter Kareiva, Michelle Marvier, and Robert Lalasz sparked a discussion on the future of the Anthropocene in the New York Times, and Scott Winship's “The Affluent Economy” was debated in the National Review, the Economist, the New York Times, and the Dish.  Reception  Breakthrough has been criticized by both the right and the left. On the right, they have been criticized for arguing about the importance of the federal government in producing technological innovations. On the left, they have been criticized for arguing that carbon pricing is not the solution to climate change, for being pro-nuclear, for promoting industrial agriculture that is highly dependent on fossil fuels, and for touting natural gas as a way to decrease coal usage. Journalist Paul D. Thacker alleged that the Breakthrough Institute is an example of a quasi-lobbying organization which does not adequately disclose its funding. The Institute has also been criticized for promoting industrial agriculture and processed foodstuffs while also accepting donations from the Nathan Cummings Foundation, whose board members have financial ties to processed food companies that rely heavily on industrial agriculture. After an IRS complaint about potential improper use of 501(c)(3) status, the Institute no longer lists the Nathan Cummings Foundation as a donor. However, as journalist Thacker has noted, the Institute's funding remains largely opaque. Climate scientist Michael E. Mann questions the motives of the Breakthrough Institute. According to Mann the self-declared mission of the BTI is to look for a breakthrough to solve the climate problem. However Mann states that basically the BTI \\"appears to be opposed to anything - be it a price on carbon or incentives for renewable energy - that would have a meaningful impact.\\" He notes that the BTI \\"remains curiously preoccupied with opposing advocates for meaningful climate action and is coincidentally linked to natural gas interests\\" and criticises the BTI for advocating \\"continued exploitation of fossil fuels\\". Mann also questions that the BTI on the one hand seems to be \\"very pessimistic\\" about renewable energy, while on the other hand \\"they are extreme techno-optimists\\" regarding geoengineering.Michael E.

At his prime, his name was included among those of fellow painters and personal friends Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani and Maurice de Vlaminck.  Early life and education  Frantisek Zdenek Maurice Augustin Eberl was born on May 25, 1887, in Prague into an upper-middle-class family. His parents were both Catholics with Swedish and French ancestry. Eberl's artistic talent became obvious early on: in 1903 he was admitted to the local Academy of Fine Arts where he and fellow painter Emil Filla studied under Vlaho Buhovac. His artistic temperament, however, was incompatible with the Academy’s conservative tradition resulting in his leaving Prague and travelling Europe. Oil on Canvas, 1913 In October 1904 Eberl arrived in Munich and enrolled in the local Academy of Fine Arts. He received excellent reviews by his teachers, among them artist Franz von Stuck. Soon, Eberl became a teacher at the Academy himself; however, negative response to his publication of a few political drawings critical of Bavarian nobility caused Eberl to leave Germany. In 1911, Eberl settled down in the artists’ quarter of Montmartre and began showing his works in the famous Paris salons of the time.:fr:François Eberl  Career and private life = World War I  During World War I, Eberl used his talent at caricature drawing and supplied artworks for posters, flyers and sketches to a Czech organization fighting the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1914 he joined the Czech legion and fought alongside the Allies. After a year and a half on the battlefield he suffered a serious injury and was honorably discharged. He joined the Red Cross in La Somme. Despite the war raging in Europe Eberl’s works were seen in numerous exhibits to a growing audience of art lovers. During the war Eberl married Frida Dohring, a Danish woman. They returned to Monmartre where Eberl gained the friendship and patronage of writers Francis Carco, Pierre Mac Orlan and Roland Dorgelès. He counted among his friends fellow painters Pablo Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani and Maurice de Vlaminck.  Between the wars  By 1920 Eberl francofied his name and became François Maurice Eberl. His career took off in that decade. He enjoyed several single artist exhibits, the legendary art dealer Berthe Weill took an interest and included him in numerous exhibits in her Parisian gallery, and Eberl became a member of the Salon des Artistes Independents. As an independent agent he arranged art exhibits within and outside France both for himself and other Salon members. The exuberance of the period was on full display in Eberl’s private life. He drove racecars for Bugatti, owned a menagerie that including both lion and crocodile, and with his wife enjoyed the bohemian artist’s life that characterizes Paris of that time. In 1928 Francois Eberl was awarded the Legion of Honor by the French government. From 1930 until the end of his life Eberl spent summers in the Monaco and he considered it his second home.  World War II & after  During World War II in the early 1940s Eberl’s wife Frida died of a heart condition. Eberl joined the French Resistance and at great personal risk created political caricatures for the Resistance that were air dropped over occupied areas to mobilize people. He also participated in helping Jews threatened with deportation to escape to Spain. After the war, Eberl returned to his Parisian workshop in Rue Camille Tahan. In the late 1940s Eberl married for the second time: Béatrice Seidl brought with her her nephew, Marc-Fréderic, and Eberl became a stepfather. With his new family Eberl entered a quieter time. Together they returned to Eberl’s pre-war practice of spending summers in Monaco where Eberl was made an honorary citizen after the war. Eberl resumed active involvement in Monaco’s cultural life. He helped arrange art exhibits with important artists.  Death  On October 8, 1992 Eberl, died of cancer in his Paris studio. He is buried in Viliers-le-Bel, near Paris.  Style and themes  Although well known for his sensual nudes, it was the first and foremost his authentic depiction of Monmartre’s gritty nightlife atmosphere with its prostitutes, gamblers, drug addicts and alcoholics that promoted Eberl´s fame. Drawing inspiration from the folklore of Paris, his preference was to paint the street scenes and nightclubs as he observed them. Eberl was interested in capturing the marginalized lives of the poor in the shadows of glittering Paris. Eberl came from a well-off family and enjoyed financial freedom and success all his life. Despite his position in life he would mingle and be welcome with the so-called ‘lower classes’ that allowed him to paint them. Eberl never compromised his subjects but rather he expressed their full humanity in his paintings. This distinguishes him among the painters of his time. Eberl’s Monmartre paintings are the embodiment of a social environment in a given time – the evocation of Bohemian Paris, a mythical place in time when even the streets had a certain grandeur and romantic spirit. Also, Eberl had a distinctive color palette which made generous use of earthy tones of browns and reds.  Works on display  Oil on Canvas, 1925. Eberl's works were regularly on display at gallery of Berthe Weill as well as the gallery Bernheim-Jeune and Devambez. Eberl was also a member of the Salon des Indépendants and the Salon d'Automne. Works by Eberl are currently at display at the Musée Monaco, the Musée des Beaux Arts, the Fonds municipal d´art contemporain der Stadt Paris and the Musées d'art moderne de Saint-Etienne. The Musée du Montparnasse has displayed several works by Eberl in the past, the last time in 2002.

Background and arrangement  \\"White Bird\\" was written in December 1967, in Seattle, Washington. Manager Matthew Katz had moved the band there to polish their act at a Seattle venue before booking them into San Francisco nightclubs. Living in the attic of a Victorian house across the street from Volunteer Park, the band had inadequate food and no transportation during a dreary Seattle winter. The song evolved from the depression of the band's circumstances and yearning to be free. The song's repeated chorus is, \\"White bird must fly or she will die.\\" In a later interview, LaFlamme said: > Where the 'white bird' thing came from ... We were like caged birds in that > attic. We had no money, no transportation, the weather was miserable. We > were just barely getting by on a very small food allowance provided to us. > It was quite an experience, but it was very creative in a way. The song was arranged and produced by LaFlamme and sung as a duet between him and group member Patti Santos. A prominent stylistic feature of the song's original arrangement are multiple violin parts overdubbed by LaFlamme.  Release and reception  It was first released on the band's 1969 eponymous debut album It's a Beautiful Day by Columbia Records. The song quickly became the band's signature tune and a staple of FM Album-oriented rock radio. The album rose to Number 47 on the Billboard 200 album chart. Following the popularity of the album track, a single version was edited and remixed for radio play, with a running time of 3:02, and released on October 4, 1969. It rose to as high as Number 3 the week of October 18, 1969 on San Francisco radio station KYA. The single never reached a wide national audience and only made it to Number 118 on Billboard's Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart. Adult Contemporary No. 10 A nearly 10-minute-long version also appeared on the 1972 live album It's a Beautiful Day at Carnegie Hall. It later appeared on nine compilation albums and four more retrospective albums. Legacy The song \\"White Bird\\" is featured in the first season of Knight Rider in the episode of the same name (Season 1, Episode 19, 4 March 1983). The song also featured in two further episodes of Knight Rider: \\"Let it Be Me\\" (Season 2, Episode 23, 13 May 1984) and \\"The Scent of Roses\\" (Season 4, Episode 12, 3 January 1986). In all three episodes, it represented the love theme between the characters of Michael Knight and Stephanie 'Stevie' Mason (who had the surname alias of March in the 2nd Season episode). The song was also used in the soundtrack of A Walk on the Moon, a 1999 American drama about a married woman's infidelity, including Woodstock Music Festival scenes. A version of \\"White Bird\\" by violinist Vanessa-Mae was released in 2001, and reached number 66 in the UK Singles Chart. Sam Bush covered the song on his 2006 Laps in Seven album. The song was also used in Adult World, a 2013 American film comedy starring Emma Roberts, Evan Peters, and John Cusack. The song was used in the 2015 film Focus, starring Will Smith and Margot Robbie, and in 2017, the premiere PBS-TV episode of Prime Suspect: Tennison.

He began, in 1937, spending summers in Rockport, MA, where he painted scenes of the small fishing town. He was active in the Rockport Art Association, teaching oil painting and participating in water color figure painting classes. Biography Riesenberg was born in 1885 in Chicago. He was educated at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where he was recognized for his compositions in oil. He moved to Yonkers in 1905 where he began his career as a professional illustrator, after a sojourn in the American west pursuing what became a lifelong interest in depicting the frontier west as was being popularized then by Zane Grey and other writers. In the early 1930s, he began doing illustration work for magazines. In the 1930s and 1940s, his work was often featured at venues such as the National Academy of Design and in organizations such as the Allied Artists of America. In the 1950s he was an art instructor at the Westchester Workshop in White Plains, NY. http://pulpartists.com/Riesenberg.htmlRiesenberg was also the vice president of the Yonkers Art Association. Riensenberg died in 1971 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Riesenberg had a brother six years older, Felix, with whom he was extremely close. They shared a love of creating art and adventure. In their youth, both wrote short stories in journals they kept. Works Over the Top For You, one of Riesenberg's WWI-era posters advertising liberty loans, where a doughboy clutches the American flag. A National Jewish Welfare Board World War I poster by Riesenberg, c. 1918 Of Riesenberg's work, his contributions during World War I are well known and he is described as \\"one of the greatest illustrators of the World War I era.\\" Riensenberg's style, it has been said, shows influences from Impressionism. He produced many posters for the Marines in addition to posters advertising the Liberty Loan campaign during World War I. One of Riesenberg's most well known works is his 1918 World War I-era poster, Over the Top for You, which illustrates a young doughboy clutching the American flag. With its bold illustration and concise text, like many war posters of the time, Over the Top for You encouraged the public to support its military by purchasing liberty loans. Among other posters, it was selected to display in the Smithsonian American Art Museum under the exhibit, Over the Top: American Posters from World War I. Riesenberg also created several posters for the United States Navy, one of which, titled Democracy's Vanguard, illustrates Marines landing from a boat to initiate an offensive. Another illustrated uniformed soldiers raising the flag against the background of a warship. Riesenberg created illustrations, including covers, for many publications such as Boys' Life Magazine, the official monthly magazine of the Boy Scouts of America, Harper's and The Saturday Evening Post. His many thematic subjects included scenes from places he lived, historical and action scenes, portraits, as well as depicting the Old West.

This manufacturing technology is unique in that the process does not require conventional extrusion or injection molding technologies, yet it readily incorporates components and features traditionally produced by these processes. The polymer solution casting process utilizes a mandrel, or inner diameter mold, that is immersed in a tank of polymer solution or liquid plastic that has been specifically engineered for the process. Due to a combination of thermal and frictional properties, the polymer solution then forms a thin film around the mold.Solvent cast technology - a versatile tool for thin film production. springer.com. Retrieved on 2013-10-31. The mold is then extracted from the tank in a precisely controlled manner, followed by a curing or drying process. Once the first layer of thin film is appropriately solidified, secondary features can be added to the product such as braided or coiled wire, laser-cut hypotubes or engineered metal reinforcements to prevent kinking, or imaging targets specific to the intended medical application. Multiple casting steps can then be repeated to encapsulate the reinforcements, build up wall thickness, add additional lumens and optimize column strength. The part is then removed from the mold after it is cured or solidified. The most notable attribute of this thin-film process technology is the ability to alternate the material properties (i.e. strength, durometer, color, lubricity) amongst the individual layers or even down the length of the part, resulting in a feature- rich single-piece construction. This process also allows other components to be incorporated into the structure of the part during the layering processes, such as injection molded components and extruded tubes made of high performance polymers such as PTFE, PEBAX, and polyimide. Another notable advantage of polymer solution casting technology is that the total manufacturing cost for both prototyping and production volumes are frequently less than the conventional technologies. This cost benefit results from the use of inexpensive molds coupled with the scalability and adaptability of the manufacturing line. As a result, new products and processes are readily developed and implemented, facilitating cost-effective creation of very feature rich and complex catheters. Since the 1990s, Avalon Laboratories and Piper Plastics Corp. have aggressively pioneered polymer solution casting technology, focusing on complex medical devices. The history of these technologies dates back to many highly regarded names in the medical industry including Medtronic, BioMedicus, Bard, Terumo, Research Medical Inc., Shiley, Polaris Plastics, and Caplugs.  Materials  Polymer solution casting technology can be deployed utilizing a host of different polymer materials depending on the application and design inputs, including those used in Class I, II and III medical devices.Polymers in Medicine II. springer.com. Retrieved on 2013-10-31. The earliest and most commonly found materials were polyvinyl chlorides (PVC) due to their advantages in cost, physical properties and clarity. Over the past twenty years, there has been scrutiny of the long term health effects of the PVC base materials relating to the plasticizers and stabilizers which are needed to ensure adequate shelf life of sterilized product. More recently, newly engineered formulations have eliminated these biocompatibility concerns while extending the shelf life, and PVC has re- emerged as a preferred polymer for use in interventional and surgical applications. Polyurethane has emerged as another polymer that meets the medical device market's demands for thinner wall sections, longer lengths and extended blood exposure. The high strength and range of properties make these materials an excellent choice for soft elastomer applications. Among the first commercial polyurethane medical products were non-allergenic medical gloves, developed as a response to latex allergies. These advanced polymers offer a full range of physical properties, improved biocompatibility, and lubricous properties by way of custom formulations and coatings. Another material choice for polymer solution casting is silicone urethane copolymers, which are among the most biocompatible synthetic materials. This class of medical grade material was developed for long-term implantable device applications and offers the physical characteristics of high elongation, low modulus of elasticity, excellent recovery, and resistance to chemicals, oil, and UV light. While there exists a number of materials to choose from while deploying polymer solution casting technology, the material science work continues in the areas of wall thickness, strength, lubricity, biocompatibility and clarity as well as interactions of the liquid polymers with extruded and injection molded components.

A son of King David II of Imereti, Constantine was recognized as heir apparent by Solomon II, who had supplanted his father. Constantine's succession to the throne of Imereti was precluded by the Russian annexation of that country in 1810. Constantine subsequently entered the Russian Imperial military service, where he rose to the rank of Major-General.  Early life and captivity  Prince Constantine was a son of King David II of Imereti and Ana Orbeliani. At the age of three, he was surrendered by his father as a hostage to Solomon II, who had won a power struggle and dethroned David in 1791. When David attempted to reclaim the throne in 1792, Solomon had Constantine incarcerated in the castle of Mukhuri. When David II died in exile in the Ottoman pashalik of Akhaltsikhe in 1795, Constantine found himself in a conflicting situation; he became the only heir to the throne, as the nearest legitimate blood-relative of his childless captor, Solomon II. In March 1802, David's widow Queen Ana, being harassed by Solomon, escaped from Imereti and applied to Tsar Alexander I of Russia to secure the release of his son. The Russian diplomat Aleksandr Sokolov (ru) arrived in Imereti for negotiations, but Solomon was adamant as he was fearful that the Russians would uphold the more amenable Constantine's claim to the throne. After long threats and bribery from the Russian commander in the Caucasus, Prince Tsitsianov, Solomon agreed to release Constantine on the condition that he did not long reside in Tiflis, the capital of Russia's Georgian possessions, and leave for Russia proper as soon as possible. Queen Ana also agreed to this compromise and Constantine was escorted to Tiflis on 30 May 1803. In April 1804, Solomon was forced to accept the Russian suzerainty in the Convention of Elaznauri and, in one of its provisions, recognized Constantine as his heir apparent.  Escape and revolt  Prince Constantine resided at Tiflis under the Russian supervision until June 1804 when, anxious that the Russian authorities considered resettling him in Russia proper, he took advantage of Tsitsianov's departure for the Erivan campaign and escaped to Imereti. There he took shelter at the estate of his brother-in- law, Prince Davit Agiashvili. Solomon reconciled with Constantine and granted him several castles and villages such as Chkhari and Tsirkvali for his princely estate (sabatonishvilo). A group of Russian soldiers sent after him failed to overtake him; neither threats nor persuasion could force Constantine to return to Tiflis. Solomon, likewise, repeatedly turned down requests from the Russian government to surrender him. As Solomon's relations with Russia progressively deteriorated, Tsar Alexander ordered that Solomon be deposed and, together with his heir Constantine, deported from Imereti. In February 1810, the Russian army moved on to conquer Imereti. Constantine was with Solomon, encouraging him to resist until the king finally decided to capitulate in March 1810. In April 1810, Constantine also surrendered and, unable to obtain a permission to live as a private person in his estate, was ordered to move to Russia. On 31 July, he left Tiflis for Saint Petersburg.  Life in Russia  In 1812, by the Tsar's decree, Prince Constantine was enlisted in the Life Guard Cossack Regiment as a Rittmeister and promoted to being a Flügeladjutant to Tsar Alexander I. He was transferred to the Life Guard Hussar Regiment in 1813. He took part in the war against Napoleonic France from 1812 to 1814. In 1817, Constantine became major-general and appointed as a commander of the 1st Brigade of the 1st Hussar Division. He was awarded the Russian orders of St. Vladimir, 4th Class, St. Anna, 1st Class, and of St. George, 4th Class. Prince Constantine retired from the military service in 1838. He died in Moscow in 1844 and was buried at the Donskoy Monastery.  Family  Prince Constantine was married three times. First, he married Princess Anastasia Abashidze in 1806 and divorced her in 1815. They had two children: *Nino (1807–1847) *Giorgi (1809–1819) Constantine married his second wife, Maria Teresa Denis Lopes da Silva, daughter of a Portuguese diplomat, in 1822 and had two children with her: *Konstantin (1827–1885) *Nikoloz (1830–1894) Thirdly, Constantine married Ekaterina Sergeyevna Strakhova (died 22 October 1875) and had one child with her: *Alexander (1837–1900) Constantine was allowed to retain the title of tsarevich (\\"prince royal\\"), his children were equated to the Russian princely nobility (knyaz) in 1812. They and their descendants bore the title and surname of Princes and Princesses Imeretinsky (იმერეტინსკი, Имеретинский), with the qualification of \\"Serene Highness\\" (Светлейший князь) added to their style as ruled by the State Council of the Russian Empire on 20 June 1865.

Former Conservative Party local politician Raymond Londal was the top candidate, along with nine other people. The party ran exclusively in the constituency of Finnmark. The party received 467 votes, of which 370 were cast in Alta, or 1.2 percent in Finnmark and 3.9 percent in Alta, failing to claim a seat in Parliament. The party was abolished after the election. History The party had its origins as a Facebook group which has the same name as the party. The issue of starting a party had been discussed at several meetings in relation to the group, although a majority had been opposed to starting a party. On 18 January 2013 the page's main administrator, Raymond Londal, asked for 500 people to like they post if they wanted him to start the preparation for a party, including collecting the necessary 500 signatures needed to register a party. Londal had initially given a deadline to 1 March, but it took only 75 minutes before he had sufficient likes to proceed. Londal started early that he hoped that the list could act as a unified list for several profiled politicians, including the Progress Party's parliamentarian Jan-Henrik Fredriksen and the Liberal Party's Trine Noodt, although these never joined. Londal, himself a Conservative Party member of Alta Municipal Council, resigned his membership in the Conservatives to be top candidate for the new list. He continued to meet in the municipal council as an independent. Prior to the election Londal stated that he hoped that the list would be able to secure a single candidate to parliament, although he admitted that this was optimistic. The party rallied at the school election at Alta Upper Secondary School, claiming 88 of 754 votes, or 12.2 percent, and making them the third-largest party. Londal stated the day after the election that the party's function now had been completed and that it would be dissolved. A week later he joined the Liberal Party. Issue Raymond Londal, the party's top candidate The party only had a single issue, namely that the sole hospital serving western Finnmark should be relocated from Hammerfest to Alta. The party stated that Alta is more centrally located than Hammerfest and argued that a hospital in Alta would give a closer service to the residents, lower transport costs and better quality. Hospital to Alta was opposed to a three-hospital solution for Finnmark, whereby there would be hospitals in both Alta and Hammerfest. The issue was especially relevant because there were plans to build a new hospital for the region. Londal mentioned Altagård as a potential location and proposed 2016 as the year for construction to start. Election Hospital to Alta exclusively ran in the constituency of Finnmark, which is awarded five members of Parliament, including one leveling seat. It was one of fifteen parties to run in the county and the only to run exclusively in Finnmark. The top candidate was the fifty-year-old Raymond Londal, a teacher and municipal council member from Alta. The second candidate was the thirty-seven-year-old May Ragnhild Vasara Jørgensen from Alta and in third place the twenty-four-year-old Erika Niittyvuopio from Karasjok. The remainder of the ten candidates were all from Alta. For Finnmark as a whole the party achieved 467 votes, or 1.2 percent, making it the tenth-largest party. The party received 370 votes in Alta, or 3.9, making it the sixth- largest party. The best result was reached in Kautokeino, where the party received 74 votes, or 5.1 percent, making it the seventh-largest party. In Hammerfest the party received one vote. In the remainder of the municipalities it received a combined 27 votes, with between zero and two per municipality.

Forming on October 27 near Guam, the storm slowly intensified while moving westward. Krosa developed an eye and became a typhoon before striking Luzon on October 31\\\\. The storm weakened over land, but re-intensified over the South China Sea, reaching peak winds of 150 km/h (90 mph) on November 2 off the southeast coast of China. Typhoon Krosa stalled and encountered unfavorable conditions, resulting in quick weakening. By November 3, it had weakened to tropical storm status, and was no longer being warned on by the next day. In northern Luzon, Krosa damaged 32,000 houses, including 3,000 that were destroyed, and caused four fatalities. High winds and rainfall left ₱277 million (PHP, $6.4 million USD) in damage. Not long after Krosa dissipated, the Philippines were again struck by the more devastating and extremely violent Typhoon Haiyan, which caused much more damage and destruction. Meteorological history On October 27, an area of convection with a broad circulation persisted southeast of Guam, and slowly consolidated due to moderate wind shear and westerly outflow. That day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression about to the southeast of Hagåtña, Guam. At 2100 UTC on October 28, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) began issuing advisories on the depression, giving it the local name Vinta. The next day, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Krosa, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also classified it as Tropical Depression 29W. By that time, the storm was moving steadily westward due to the subtropical ridge to the north. With the warm waters of the Philippine Sea, lessening wind shear, and improving outflow, Krosa gradually strengthened, and the JTWC also upgraded Krosa to tropical storm status on October 30 after an eye feature developed. While approaching northern Luzon on October 29, Krosa quickly intensified as the initial eye feature organized into a well-defined eye. Late on October 30, the JTWC upgraded Krosa to typhoon status, and the next day, both PAGASA and JMA followed suit. On October 31, Krosa made landfall in northeastern Luzon near Cagayan, and developed a symmetric eyewall while initially moving over land. Land interaction weakened the eye by the time Krosa emerged into the South China Sea late on October 31. The next day, PAGASA discontinued advisories after the typhoon exited the region. Convection rebuilt around the center, with continued favorable conditions allowing for restrengthening. Late on November 1, a large eye redeveloped, and the JTWC estimated Krosa attained peak 1 minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). Early the next day, the JMA also estimated the typhoon reached peak 10 minute winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). Later, increasing wind shear caused the eye to deteriorate, and Krosa began slowing about 260 km (160 mi) east-southeast of Hong Kong after reaching the western edge of the subtropical ridge. After remaining nearly stationary, Krosa began moving steadily to the west-southwest due to a new ridge. The convection continued to weaken due to continued shear and cooler waters from upwelling, and Krosa deteriorated to tropical storm status on November 3. The next day, the JTWC issued its final advisory after the circulation became exposed from the convection. Also on November 4, the JMA downgraded Krosa to tropical depression status off the northeast Vietnam coast. The system dissipated at 0000 UTC on November 5. Preparations and impact Severe Tropical Storm Krosa approaching Luzon on October 31 Before Krosa struck the Philippines, PAGASA issued a number 3 warning signal for portions of northern Luzon, where winds were expected to reach over 100 km/h (60 mph). The agency noted for the potential for flooding and landslides. High winds knocked down trees across Luzon, and left about 80% of Cagayan province without power, as well as some areas without internet or cellphone service. Portions of the Pan- Philippine Highway were blocked, and in Lal-Lo, Cagayan, a car crashed into a gasoline truck due to power outages. Agriculture damage was estimated at ₱273 million (US$6.31 million), occurring just before the start of the harvest. Across the island, the typhoon damaged 37,523 houses, including 3,897 that were destroyed, forcing 65,648 people to evacuate to storm shelters. Overall, Krosa killed four people in the Philippines, and left ₱277 million (US$6.4 million) in damage. After the storm, workers quickly restored power lines, while the government provided monetary assistance to storm-ravaged families, after Cagayan was declared a state of calamity. Members of the Philippine military and Department of Public Works and Highways worked to clean up following the storm. The China National Meteorological Centre issued a \\"yellow alert\\", the second-lowest of the four level warning system, for Hainan due to the threat of the storm. The agency recommended boats to return to port. Agencies in Vietnam also warned for the potential of heavy rainfall due to the dissipating Tropical Depression Krosa, and released water from three dams to prevent overflow.

In other words, people define and resolve their internal musings through other's viewpoint. SMT's background is derived from the 1800s from concepts related to the study of public opinion and social interaction by Wilhelm Dilthey, the German philosopher and sociologist. SMT suggests that people, in general, are not capable of self-reflection without taking into consideration a peer's interpretation of the experience. Burgoon and Hale (1984) conceptualized relational communication as the verbal and nonverbal themes present in people's communication that define an interpersonal relationship. History Social Mirror Theory (SMT) also is referred to as mimicry. Mimicry serves as an important impersonal function. The notion that individuals mimic the behaviors of others has long been of interest to psychologists (James, 1890). Over the past 30 years, there has been a noticeable surge in research exploring the subtle and unintentional ways in which people imitate their social interaction partners, including mimicry of facial expressions, emotions, speech patterns and physical movements. The non- conscious mimicry is notably different than conscious imitation or modeling, and important part of the Social Learning Theory (SLT), (Bandura, 1977). To understand why we mimic and articulate the functions that mimicry serves, systemic investigations into mimicry's wide-ranging consequences have been conducted through investigations into the factors that may facilitate and inhibit non conscious mimicry.  Support and effectiveness of mimicry  When two or more people engage in conversation, the person that converses is accustomed to being looked at. Therefore, making eye contact and mimicking the eye contact creates a mirrored effect to the other person to expect conversation and dialogue. Many prominent scholars have studied Non Conscious Behavioral Mimicry (NcBM). NcBM occurs when a person unwittingly imitates the behaviors of another person. (Lakin, JL, 2003). The spontaneous imitation of gestures, postures, mannerisms, and other motor movements is pervasive in human interactions. Existing reviews focuses on two recent themes in the mimicry literature.  Lakin and Chartrand’s non-conscious behavioral mimicry studies  In early 2000, initially an analysis of the moderators of mimicry uncovered the various motivational, social, emotional, and personality factors that led to more or less mimicry of an interaction partner in a given situation. Secondly, a significant amount of recent research was conducted and identified important downstream consequences of mimicking or being mimicked by another person. The consequences included not only increased pro-sociality between those interacting, but also the unexpected effects on the individual. The current experiments explored whether having a goal to affiliate augments the tendency to mimic the behaviors of interaction partners. Experiment 1 demonstrated that having an affiliation goal increases non conscious mimicry, and Experiment 2 further supported this proposition by demonstrating that people who have unsuccessfully attempted to affiliate in an interaction subsequently exhibit more mimicry than those who have not experienced such a failure. Results suggest that behavioral mimicry may be part of a person's repertoire of behaviors, used non consciously, when there is a desire to create rapport.  Basic concepts of mimicry  There are multiple concepts that may fall under the aegis of mimicry. Behavioral mimicry is also placed in its broader context as a form of interpersonal coordination. It is often compared to interactional synchrony and other social contagion effects, including verbal, facial, emotional and behavioral mimicry with similar emotional and attitudinal convergence. Facial Mimicry defined is the resemblance shown by one animal species to another which protects it from predators, perceived or otherwise. Dimberg's research revealed that mothers tend to open their mouths in response to their infants opening and closing the mouth to feed. There is substantial and compelling evidence that supports mimicry of facial expressions occurs automatically. (Dimberg, Thumber, and Elmeched, 2000). Emotional Mimicry research finds that facial actions can automatically elicit feelings (Neumann and Strack, 2000). When a mood is being displayed is a happy mood, both high and low emotions are expressive and participants in study pass their moods from one to another. Verbal Mimicry research includes that a number of verbal tendencies are mimicked (Simner, 1971). Studies with infants demonstrated that newborns as young as 2–4 days old, will cry in response to another infants crying. Also verbal mimicry is revealed in speech patterns, conducted with adult's show that speakers tend to adopt each other's accents, latency to speak, rate of speech, utter durations and sentence syntax (Beck, 1986). Behavioral Mimicry characteristic traits are noticed in body positioning and postures. These traits would fit into the dynamics noted between interacting individuals. Noted psychotherapist, Albert Scheflen (1964) believed that mimicry or postural congruence was an indicator of similarity in views or rules among interacting individuals in similar settings. (Chartrand and Bargh, 1999) focused on mimicry of specific mannerisms and confirmed that mimicry occurs spontaneously in dyadic interactions (Interpersonal Communications, Spitzburgh and Cupach, 2007).  Gender roles of mimicry  Research shows that gender does play an important role in Behavioral Mimicry. Some of the earliest work on mimicry was conducted in domains of clinical psychology and counseling (charney 1966, Scheflen 1964). There are strong links that three facets of rapport; mutual attention, coordination, and positivity- associated with non-verbal behavioral mimicry. Women, but not men were slower to recognize the affective valence of briefly displayed facial expressions when constrained from mimicking them, attributed to the fact that facial constraints hinder women's capacity to empathize. Deceptive mimicry in gender identity seen in humans’ masquerades and camouflages in the nonverbal behaviors. The Optimal Distinctiveness Theory (ODT) hypothesizes that people are in a continual quest to balance the need for distinctiveness (seeing them differently) or assimilation (seeing themselves similar to others) and this is a direct lead to mimicry. Chartrand's and Bargh (1999) have coined the phrase “The Chameleon Effect” to describe the non-conscious behavioral mimicry of individuals modulating their own behavior to blend in with a current environment.

The device was intended to aid in mathematical and other calculations, much as we now use digital computers and calculators. With proper instruction and use, the device was capable of assisting in a wide assortment of calculations, including arithmetic, cryptography, and music. Kircher adopted some of the ideas in the Organum from preexisting inventions like Napier's bones, almanacs, and his own Arca Musarithmica. Like other calculating devices of the period, the Organum prefigures modern computing technology. Yet, due to its general lack of adoption, it remains an interesting but obscure footnote in the history of information technology.Haub, Vollrath Description and layout The Organum Mathematicum was a box or chest divided into nine or more compartments. Each compartment was filled with wooden rods or slats (called \\"tariffa\\" by Kircher). The compartments were organized according to the nine functions they performed (see #Topics). To use the organum, you would remove the rods you needed, manipulate them or rearrange them as needed to perform your calculation, and then return the rods to the box. Some of the rods were simple tables, as one might find in an almanac. Other rods, in particular the music, cryptography and arithmetic rods, were more complex in design and intended to be used in combination.Schott History In 1661, 11 years after the publication of Musurgia Universalis, which contains a description of a similar, but more limited device, the Arca Musarithmica, Kircher sent an Organum Mathematicum to Gottfried Aloys Kinner, the tutor to the 12-year-old Charles Joseph, Archduke of Habsburg, for whom the Organum was likely intended. Kircher enclosed instructions in a drawer in the base of the device, as well as a set of mathematical instruments.Kircher page 1 The Organum Mathematicum was later described in a 1668 book of the same title by Gaspar Schott, who was Kircher's pupil. The book includes numerous excerpts from the original manual. There is also a portrait of the young Charles Joseph who had died four years earlier.Schott page 53 There are no surviving Organums which closely resemble the device illustrated in Schott's book, but there are three known devices, likely of Jesuit manufacture, which contain essentially the same content. Front and back of one of Kircher's musical rods Topics The device described in Schott's book was divided by functionality into 9 main sections, each of which contained approximately 24 rods. Arithmetic The arithmetic rods included a set of Napier's Bones. They were capable of assisting with multiplication of multi-digit numbers, and producing quotients. Geometry The rods in this section could aid in determining heights, by use of a geometric square. Fortifications The rods in this section could aid in determining the design of bulwarks in fortification plans. Chronology The rods in this section could be used to determine the date of Easter and other church holidays which were positioned relative to it. These rods simple contained a table of upcoming dates. Horography The rods in this section contained information needed to construct sundials. Astronomy This compartment had tablets which resembled those found in an almanac. For each day of the year, the length of the day and night, the times for sunrise and sunset, and the duration of morning and evening twilight were provided. All the information was based on measurements taken at 48 degrees latitude (Vienna). Astrology This section had tables describing movements for the visible planets, the constellation Draco, and also provided astrological interpretations for the 12 zodiac signs. Cryptography The rods in this section could be used to encrypt and decrypt text using a cyclic transposition cypher, based on a keyword. Music The rods in this section could be used by non musicians to compose church music. The system used was the same as that used for Kircher's previous device, the Arca Musarithmica. They contained sets of musical phrases which could be combined randomly to set verses to music, producing millions of hymns in 4-part harmony. The Organum Mathematicum at the Museo Galileo in Florence Another view of the Organum Mathematicum at the Museo Galileo in Florence, Italy. Surviving models There are few surviving examples of the Organum. There are no surviving Organums which closely resembles the device illustrated in Schott's book, but there are three known 17th-century devices which contain essentially the same content. Most of them appear to have been built to impress important patrons to the Jesuits. It is unclear if any of them saw regular use. =Florence= This Organum has a steep slope which presents all the rods in an attractive manner. There is a dial in the front which can be used to find local time in 24 different cities around the world (the dial duplicates an illustration from Kircher's Ars Magna Lucis et Umbra). The rods are cut to resemble obelisks, perhaps playing on Kircher's reputed expertise in Egyptology. =Prague= This Organum appears identical to the Florence model. Some photos show an additional metal frame which may have been added later for protection. =Munich= This Organum is the 'odd man out' - it is very different in appearance from the Florence and Prague devices, which are essentially identical. The chest is not sloped, and there are a lot of extra drawers in the pedestal. Related devices Kircher's earlier Arca Musarithmica was a music composing device of similar design to the Organum. The content of the rods was essentially the same as the musical rods in the Organum (although there was room for more of them). The Organum can be thought of as an improved and generalized version of the Arca.

According to a survey by IBM, Mexico City had North America's worst parking and tied for 10th worst in the world, to IBM's survey, with 73 per cent of drivers in Mexico City having had to abandon their search for parking at some point during the previous 12 months. Franeleros Street parking in urban neighborhoods is mostly controlled by the franeleros (from franela, the red rag they wave to gain the attention of drivers), a.k.a. \\"viene vienes\\" (lit. \\"come on, come on\\"), who ask drivers for a fee to park; in the Condesa neighborhood in 2012, 20 to 40 pesos (USD to ). The requested fee can be as high as 200 to 300 pesos (USD to ), for example during sports events in the area surrounding the Plaza México bullring (the world's largest) and the Estadio Azul soccer stadium. The fee is in theory a tip to guard the car, but is in fact extortion,\\"Promete delegado ir por franeleros 'gallitos'\\", Más por más, October 30, 2013 since there is the implicit threat that the franelero will damage the car if the fee is not paid. Double parking is common (with franeleros moving the cars as required), impeding on the available lanes for traffic to pass.

The granting of the license for all zones exclusively to a new company without experience in operating parking meters, Operadora de Estacionamientos Bicentenario, has generated controversy. Expansion plans As of November 2013 there are plans to expand metered parking to Álvaro Obregón borough (colonias Guadalupe Inn, Florida, Crédito Constructor, Axotla and Agrícola) and Coyoacán borough (colonias Del Carmen, Barrio de Santa Catarina, Villa Coyoacán, Barrio de La Purísima Concepción and Barrio San Lucas), as well as colonias Escandón and San Miguel Chapultepec.http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/ciudad-metropoli/2013/catorce- empresas-pelean-parquimetros-967247.html Valet parking As of October 2013, the same west-central neighborhoods are plagued by rogue valet parking services in front of hundreds of restaurants, bars and shops. Laws are being proposed to control valet parking services and require them to belong to a registered entity (razón social), present their rates, and the location where the car will be parked.

Dr. Martin Luther King Drive in the Douglas community area of Chicago, Illinois. Built in 1921, the building served as the headquarters of the Supreme Life Insurance Company, which was founded two years earlier by Frank L. Gillespie. The company, originally known as the Liberty Life Insurance Company, was the first African-American owned insurance company in the northern United States. Since white-owned insurance firms regularly denied black customers life insurance when the firm was founded, the firm played an important role in providing life insurance to Chicago's African-American community. The company ultimately became the largest African-American owned business in the northern states and became a symbol of the predominantly black Bronzeville neighborhood's economic success from the 1920s to the 1950s. In the 1990s, the building was nearly demolished before it was purchased by the Black Metropolis Convention and Tourism Council. The group rehabilitated the building in 2005, and it now serves as the Bronzeville Visitor Information Center. The building was designated as a Chicago Landmark on September 9, 1998. It is one of nine buildings designated as part of the Black Metropolis- Bronzeville District.

Early years Jemsek was born in 1913. He was the son of recent immigrants from the Ukraine. He began to caddy when he was six, and caddied at Laramie, Acacia, and Palos Hills. When he was 15, he began caddying at Cog Hill Golf & Country Club, founded by the Coghill brothers in 1927 at Lemont, Illinois, to the southwest of Chicago. At the age of 17, he became a professional golfer and joined the PGA Tour for a while, then returned to Cog Hill where he took various jobs. At the 1934 Chicago World's Fair, Jemsek won a trophy for driving a golf ball from the sky-ride tower, high, into Lake Michigan for a distance of . St. Andrews The 36-hole St. Andrews golf course in West Chicago was opened in 1926 by Frank Hough. In 1929 Hough opened the Lakewood Course. Jemsek moved to St. Andrews as an instructor after he failed to obtain a pay raise at Cog Hill. He married Hough's daughter Alice, and took over management of the business. In 1939 he bought the course for $40,000 using a combination of savings and a loan. Jemsek saw demand for golfing facilities from new immigrants to Chicago from Ireland, Russia, Greece, Italy and Scandinavia who would not feel comfortable at a private club, and founded the \\"Jemsek Golf\\" company to serve this market. In 1947 St. Andrews hosted a U.S. Open qualifier, the first public course to do so, and was the first to offer United States Golf Association (USGA) handicaps for its regular players. Jemsek employed the champion woman golfer Patty Berg as head professional for almost fifty years. His clubhouse was air conditioned, and metal spikes could be worn inside. Jemsek helped to launch the Illinois PGA. In 1947 he launched the Chicago TV program \\"All-Star Golf\\", which became nationally syndicated. Jemsek became known for making golf accessible to the masses. Cog Hill Jemsek maintained good relations with the Coghill brothers. After John and Bert Coghill had died, in 1951 the remaining brother Marty offered the course to Jemsek. He purchased the course for $400,000, agreeing to retain the Cog Hill name. Jemsek decided that his Cog Hill club would meet the same standards as the best private clubs, with excellent service and impeccably maintained courses. He hired Dick Wilson in 1963 to build a third course at Cog Hill, which involved using part of the old course #1, and adding new holes to that course to compensate. Still wanting a course that could host a PGA Championship or a U.S. Open, he asked Wilson to build a fourth course. Wilson accepted the offer but died before finishing the job, which was completed by his partner Joe Lee. Wilson was suffering from alcoholism while he was working on Cog Hill#4. Jemsek ruled that he could not be admitted to the club house, since if he went in for lunch his drinking would destroy the rest of the day's work. Instead, his lunch was brought out to him. Jemsek's Cog Hill No. 4. course, known as \\"Dubsdread\\", became known as one of the best public golf courses in the United States. Dubsdread was later chosen to host the U.S. Amateur, the Publinx Championship and the PGA Tour's Western Open. Jemsek and his son Frank also came to own Pine Meadow and Summer Grove in Newnan, Georgia, with the Atlanta- area course designed by grandson Joseph T. Jemsek, Frank's son.

It is also used by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Plant 42 shares a runway with Palmdale Regional Airport (PMD). Overview Plant 42 is owned by Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and operated as a component of Edwards Air Force Base, which is 23 miles to the northeast. Most of its facilities are operated by private contractors to build and maintain military aircraft and their components for the United States and their allies.globalsecurity.org plant 42 Plant 42 has of industrial space and a replacement value of $1.1 billion. Some of its facilities build aircraft, including the Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk and other unmanned aircraft. Others maintain and modify aircraft such as the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit bomber. Still others make spare parts. Aerospace contractors at Air Force Plant 42 share a runway complex, and either lease building space from the Air Force (an arrangement commonly referred to as a \\"GOCO,\\" or Government Owned Contractor Operated) or own their own buildings outright (e.g., Lockheed Martin Skunk Works). There are eight production sites specially suited for advanced technology and/or \\"black\\" programs. Currently, the most well-known contractors at Plant 42 are Boeing, Lockheed Martin (home of the legendary Skunk Works), and Northrop Grumman. Previously, the facilities were operated by IT&T; McDonnell-Douglas Aircraft; Lockheed California, Norair, a Division of Northrop; and Lockheed Air Terminal.Palmdale Contractor Operated Installation. // Department of Defense appropriations for 1970, pt. 2, pp. 816-817. Plant 42 is a GOCO, contractually operated for the Air Force since 1954. But under the Obama administration, the Air Force chose to take over some plant operations that had long been performed by contractors. The airfield is now operated by the Department of Defense, with 412 TW/Operating Location, Air Force Test Center in command. Plant 42 controls more than 5,800 acres (23 km²) of Mojave Desert land north of Avenue P and south of Columbia Way (Avenue M). The western border is Sierra Highway, and the plant extends east to around 40th Street East, south of Avenue N to Avenue P, and 50th Street East north of Avenue N to Columbia Way (Avenue M). It is the Antelope Valley's second-largest employer. Facilities Sign by one of the gates into Plant 42 Northrop Grumman's B-2 final assembly and modification facility is at Palmdale. In February 1999, Department of Defense officials said that depot support for the B-2 would be provided by commercial and military sources. For example, the engines are to be maintained by the Air Force, software support is to be provided by commercial sources, and airframe maintenance is to be provided by Northrop Grumman at Palmdale. Rockwell's Palmdale assembly facility is where all the individual parts, pieces, and systems of the Space Shuttle came together and were assembled and tested. Upon completion, the spacecraft was turned over to NASA for truck transport to Edwards AFB. NASA's Dryden Flight Research Facility at Edwards Air Force Base was where the spacecraft was loaded and unloaded on a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft. Entrance plaza of the Lockheed Skunk Works About 250 major subcontractors supplied various systems and components to Rockwell's Palmdale assembly facility. The structures of the orbiter were manufactured at various companies under contract to Rockwell International's Space Transportation Systems Division, Downey, California. The upper and lower forward fuselage, crew compartment, forward reaction control system and aft fuselage were manufactured at Rockwell's Space Transportation Systems Division facility in Downey and were transported overland from Downey to Rockwell's Palmdale, California, assembly facility. The midfuselage was manufactured by General Dynamics, San Diego, California, and transported overland to Rockwell's Palmdale assembly facility. The wings (including elevons) were manufactured by Grumman, Bethpage, Long Island, New York, and transported by ship from New York via the Panama Canal to Long Beach, California, and then transported overland to Rockwell's Palmdale assembly facility. The vertical tail (including rudder/speed brake) were manufactured by Fairchild Republic, Farmingdale, Long Island, New York, and transported overland to Rockwell's Palmdale assembly facility. The payload bay doors were manufactured at Rockwell International's Tulsa, Oklahoma, facility and transported overland to Rockwell's Palmdale assembly facility. The body flap was manufactured at Rockwell International's Columbus, Ohio, facility and transported overland to Rockwell's Palmdale assembly facility. The aft orbital maneuvering system/reaction control system pods were manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, St. Louis, Missouri, and transported by aircraft to Rockwell's Palmdale assembly facility. They were also transported by aircraft from Rockwell's Palmdale assembly facility to the Kennedy Space Center. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had been paying the Air Force for use of Plant 42 facilities for the shuttle work. NASA decided in February 2002 to shift space shuttle overhaul and modification work from Palmdale to Florida.

The Blackbird Airpark Museum is an extension of the AFFT Museum at Edwards AFB, while the Heritage Airpark is operated by the City of Palmdale. History Palmdale Airport in 1953, showing its World War II configuration The origins of Plant 42 go to the early 1930s, when a small airstrip was built in the desert. It was listed in 1935 documentation as CAA Intermediate #5. It was established by the Bureau of Air Commerce (later the Civil Aeronautics Administration) who maintained a network of emergency landing fields. It provided a pilot in distress with a better alternative than landing on a public road or a farmer's field. World War II In 1940, Palmdale Army Airfield was activated as a United States Army Air Corps (later Air Forces) airfield for use as an emergency landing strip and for B-25 Mitchell medium bomber support training during World War II. It was one of many intermediate fields that were used as auxiliary fields or emergency landing fields by the AAF during World War II. Their dispersion along the air routes, their infrequent use, and their U.S. government ownership made them ideal for use by military aircraft. It acted as a sub-base for Muroc Army Airfield and Hammer Army Airfield. Postwar use The Space Shuttle Enterprise rolls out of the Palmdale manufacturing facilities with Star Trek cast and crew members in September 1976. Northrop B-2A roll-out ceremony on November 22, 1988 at USAF Plant 42 Palmdale Army Airfield was declared a surplus facility in 1946 and was purchased by Los Angeles County for use as a municipal airport. The outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 caused the Air Force to reactivate the property for use in final assembly and flight testing of military jet aircraft. Both the Air Force and its aircraft contractors needed a location away from major population centers - due to sonic booms, other noises and security concerns - but close enough to the major centers of aircraft design and production, while having excellent flying weather the year around. The land which became Plant 42 fit these criteria. Consequently, the Air Force agreed to purchase the land from Los Angeles County in 1951. The Air Force awarded a contract to Lockheed Aircraft to develop the master plan for the site. The plan was to construct a facility that would meet the requirements of full war mobilization and augment the industrial production potential of the major airframe manufacturing industry in southern California. The concept for Air Force Plant 42 originated in the challenge of flight testing high performance jet aircraft over heavily populated areas. Following approval of the Master Plan in 1953, the Palmdale Airport officially became Air Force Plant 42; ownership of the installation was transferred to the Federal Government in 1954. With USAF encouragement, Lockheed, looked upon with favor by the Air Force at this time, established its permanent presence at Plant 42. It signed a lease in 1956 for 237 acres to use Palmdale Airport for final assembly and flight testing. Lockheed Skunk Works Lockheed's famed \\"Skunk Works\\" (a location for black projects), which developed such aircraft as the U-2, SR-71 Blackbird and F-117 Nighthawk, is at Site 10 of the complex (actually private property with secure access to Plant 42's airfield), near Sierra Highway. It relocated to Plant 42 from its original Burbank-Glendale- Pasadena Airport (now Bob Hope Airport) site in Burbank after the end of the Cold War. Its present hangar was constructed in 1968 and the outer walls of the structure were put up in a matter of days. Its hangar originally was built for the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar passenger jet project. Since then, the plant has supported facilities for the production, engineering, final assembly and flight testing of high performance aircraft. During the 1980s it was used by Lockheed to produce the U-2/TR-1 and support the SR-71. Northrop produced the F-5E, and Rockwell supported the B-1B Lancer.

He is known for a diary called \\"Providence improved\\", which describes the state of Cheshire throughout the English Civil War. From this diary the main facts of Burghall's life can also be gathered. Biography Before the civil war Burghall was schoolmaster at Bunbury, Cheshire, and was probably appointed to the post about 1632. cites: Burghall Diary, 12 May 1632, \\"Mr. Cole, schoolmaster of Bunbury, departed this life\\". The parish school at Bunbury, of which Burghall was master, was founded in 1594, and was endowed with \\"£20 per annum, one house and some land\\". cites Ormerod Cheshire, ii, 141. The vicar of Bunbury till the year 1629 was William Hinde, a celebrated puritan and biographer of John Bruen of Stapleford. In 1643, during the siege of Nantwich, Burghall says that his goods were seized and himself driven from his home by Colonel Marrow; he thereupon went to Haslington in Cheshire, \\"where he had a call\\", and tarried there from 1 May 1644 until 1646. cites: Burghall Diary for 18 March 1644. In the latter year he became vicar of Acton, taking the place of Hunt, who was sequestered. cites Ormerod, iii. 187. In company with fifty-eight Cheshire ministers he signed the attestation to the Solemn League and Covenant in 1648. cites: Calamy, Continuation, i. 171. In this document his name is spelt Burghah, and by Calamy Burgal. In 1658 he preached and published a sermon at the dedication of the free school at Acton. From the year 1655 he complains that he was much molested by the Quakers, and speaks of their opinions with great asperity. cites: Burghall Diary for 1655, 1660; Calamy, Abridgement of Baxter's Life and Times. ii. 128. After the Restoration, when the Act of Uniformity 1662 was passed, Burghall was one of the victims of the Great Ejection. After preaching farewell sermons at his churches of Wrenbury and Acton, he was on 3 October 1662 suspended from the vicarage of Acton, and on the 28 October his successor Kirks was appointed. The diary ends in the year 1663, when expelled from the vicarage he was reduced to poverty; the last note in the diary complains that he was defrauded of his right to the tithes. A school was formed by public subscription for his maintenance. cites: Ormerod, iii. 185, n.; Lysons, Magna Brit. vol. ii. pt. ii. p. 471, from answers to the queries of Bishop Beilby Porteus in the bishops’ registry, 1778. Burghall died 8 December 1665, steadfast in his religious faith. cites: Calamy, Continuation, i. 171. Diary His diary was left in manuscript. It was printed in 1778 in an anonymous History of Cheshire, in two vols., which incorporated King's Vale Royal with this and similar narratives. cites: Lysons, Magna Brit. II. ii. 466 ; Ormerod, iii. 222-8. It is more accessible in Barlow’s Cheshire (1855). Its title is Providence improved and it begins with the year 1628. Before the civil war the entries only record what the author regarded as the special interventions of Providence in the neighbourhood of Bunbury. In the year 1641 Burghall first notices political events, and afterwards gives a very detailed account of the military operations in Cheshire. The reason was that Lord Byron took his church at Acton and made it a basis of operations for the siege of Nantwich. The narrative throws additional light on some disputed points in the history of the war. Barlow in one of his notes to the diary (many of these notes, he says, were furnished by Mr. Aspland) states that Burghall married a sister of John Bruen, but he does not give any authority for the statement; and all the marriages of Bruen's sisters are shown in Ormerod's pedigree of the Bruen family. cites: Ormerod, Cheshire, ii. 175.

The station was built in 1928 by William D. Meyering and David L. Sutton, two local real estate businessmen. The station is an example of the Domestic style of gas station architecture, in which stations were designed to resemble small houses. A wooden canopy supported by brick piers covers the building's front entrance and two garage bays extend from either side, making the station part of a subtype of the Domestic style appropriately named \\"House with Canopy and Bays\\". The station's walls are built with clinker bricks laid in a skintled pattern, a combination of two Chicago construction innovations. Clinker bricks were heated at higher temperatures than standard bricks, making them swollen, dense, and differently colored; the bricks were generally discarded until the 1920s, when Chicago architects began to build with them. The skintled pattern of brickwork consisted of rough and irregular bricklaying in which bricks stuck out of and into the wall at different angles. The building's parapet roof is tiled with multicolored Mission style clay tiles, which were thought to pair well with skintled walls by architects of the era. Gas stations constructed from the 1930s onward generally had more functional designs, and as of 1999, the Four Nineteen Building was one of only sixteen Domestic-style gas stations remaining in Chicago and one of three with both a canopy and bays.

The route is long and is located in eastern Highland County and southeastern Fayette County. The route's southern terminus is at an intersection with SR 41 in Brush Creek Township and its northern terminus is at an intersection with U.S. Route 62 and SR 3 on the border of Washington Court House and Union Township. Route description SR 753 begins at an unsignalized T-intersection with SR 41 in Brush Creek Township. The intersection is near the Fort Hill State Memorial and is located between the unincorporated community of Cynthiana and the village of Sinking Spring. The route heads north-northwest towards the community of Carmel where it intersects SR 506 at its eastern terminus. After passing around the eastern end of Rocky Fork Lake and its eponymous state park, the route comes to an intersection with US 50. SR 753 turns right onto US 50 forming a concurrency for about . Upon entering Rainsboro, SR 753 breaks off of US 50 at Barrett Mills Road and heads north towards New Petersburg. The route makes a sharp curve to the northeast at New Petersburg and heads through Paint Creek State Park and crosses Walnut Creek on a bridge. Shortly after the park, the route enters Greenfield, the name of the route becomes 7th Street and forms a concurrency with SR 138. At Jefferson Street (SR 28) in Greenfield, the three routes head east towards the center of the village. At the intersection of Jefferson and Washington Streets, SR 753 turns north ending the concurrency with Routes 28 and 138 but forms another with SR 41. North of the downtown section, the two routes head north until the intersection with Mill Street; there, the routes turn right onto it and exit the village on that street. Shortly after leaving Highland County for Fayette, SR 753 turns off of SR 41 and heads east across Paint Creek. After the bridge, the route curves to the north. On this segment, the route passes through the community of Good Hope and has an interchange with the US 35 bypass of Washington Court House. The route enters the city limits of Washington Court House and soon intersects at a four-way intersection US 22. SR 753 continues north and begins to curve around to the northwest before it ends at an intersection with US 62 and SR 3 northeast of downtown Washington Court House. History SR 753 was first designated in 1937 on a route wholly located in Fayette County. The route ran from what is now the northernmost intersection with SR 41 in Perry Township to US 35 southeast of Washington Court House. The route at the southern terminus was SR 70, but SR 70 continued south of Greenfield along the remainder of what is now SR 753 to SR 41 in Brush Creek Township. This section of SR 70 had been a part of the state highway system since 1926. The route would not experience any major changes until 1962 when many highways statewide were renumbered due to their numbers being identical with Interstate highways; in that year, SR 753 was extended south of Greenfield taking over the southern portion of SR 70 which was being deleted due to the presence of Interstate 70 in Ohio. Construction started on an extension of the road from US 35 to US 22 in 1970; this extension was completed by 1972. A $5 million project to extend SR 753 from US 22 to US 62 along Stuckey Road and a new right-of-way was completed in May 2014.

Located about (by water) of Lac Édouard (Quebec) which is the head of Batiscan River, the \\"Lake of the cross\\" is a segment of path of the Batiscan river, near Triton Club. This wild sector grew on forestry and tourism upon the arrival of the railway CNR (subdivision Lac-Saint-Jean) connecting Hervey-Jonction to Chambord (Lac Saint-Jean), through the Lac-Édouard, in the late 19th century.  Toponymy  The French toponym \\"Lac à la croix\\" (Lake of the Cross) was formalized on December 5, 1968, at the Bank of place names in Commission de toponymie du Québec (Geographical Names Board of Quebec). The name of the lake is in harmony with the other place names located at the area east of the \\"Lake of the cross\\". These toponyms are tinged with Christianity Lake Charity which flows into the Batiscan River and its tributaries upstream: \\"Petite Charité 1\\" (Little Charity 1), \\"Petite Charité 2\\" (Little Charity 2), Lac l'Espérance (Lake of Hope) and \\"Lac Petite Espérance\\" (lake of Small Hope). While the \\"Lac de la foi\\" (lake of faith) (neighbor on the east side) flows eastward into Lake \\"Trois Caribou\\" (Three Caribou). These various lakes are connected by footpaths of the Lordship of Triton. The maps of the area still shows the layout of ancient paths connecting the lakes. The development of inter-lake trails and place names are similar to a good sector of pilgrimage that were once popular. In addition, fifty kilometers (by water) separates the mouth of the lake to the Cross and the Island of the cross (Quebec) (downstream in the middle of the Batiscan).Search powered by historian Gaetan Veillette (Saint- Hubert, QC), from maps. In June 2013, the Bank of place names in Geographical Names Board of Canada has 60 homonyms related to \\"Lake of the cross\\" 29 names \\"lac à la Croix\\" (Lake of the cross), 12 \\"Lac en Croix\\" (Lake in Cross), 10 \\"Lac de la Croix\\" (Cross Lake), 3 \\"Lac la Croix\\" (Cross Lake), 5 \\"Petit Lac à la Croix\\" (Little Lake of the Cross) (including some variants in writing) and on \\"Lac La Croix\\". In addition, several other variants complicate the toponymy of Quebec and Canada: \\"Pointe à la Croix\\" (Tip of the cross), \\"Rose-Croix\\" (Rosy Cross), Sainte-Croix (St. Croix), Anse-à-la-Croix (Anse of the cross), \\"Chemin de la Croix\\" (Stations of the Cross), Ile-de-la-Croix (Island of the cross), Montagne-de-la-Croix (mountain of the Cross), Pointe-de-la-Croix (Tip of the cross), \\"Rivière de la Croix\\" (River of the cross) and \\"rue de la Croix\\" (Street of the cross).

The airline runs unscheduled flights to Batanes (the northernmost part of the Philippines) and connects Basco to Laoag and Tuguegarao. In 2013, the company acquired a BAe Jetstream 41 on a lease purchase basis, with plans to use this aircraft to connect Manila to several underserved routes in the Philippines. With the idea of connecting the islands and expanding the routes, the company decided to restructure the fleet with ATR 42-320 for better performance. The airline also planned to procure its own air operator's certificate from the CAAP by 2015, and was looking to start international flights to Taiwan and Malaysia by 2016.

The bridge was designed by Thomas Elliot Harrison for the Hull and Doncaster Branch of the North Eastern Railway and opened in 1869. In the latter part of the 20th century, the bridge became known for the frequent incidents involving ship collisions with the superstructure. As of 2020, it is still in use. History and description Pre-1915 photo of the bridge During the 1860s, a number of attempts were made by different railway companies to create a new line better connecting Kingston upon Hull and South Yorkshire; in 1862 the North Eastern Railway promoted a bill for a line which was unopposed by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, and Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway on the understanding of mutual running powers for the companies, either to Hull, or on lines in South Yorkshire. The bill, the \\"North Eastern Railway (Hull and Doncaster Branch)\\" was deposited late 1862, for a line from a junction on the Hull and Selby Line near Staddlethorpe (near Gilberdyke) to a junction with the South Yorkshire Railway near Thorne, Hatfield and Stainforth. The act was passed in mid-1863. As part of the construction of the line, a bridge was required over the River Ouse near Goole between Skelton and Hook. Construction and design The bridge (2003) The bridge consisted of four fixed spans, one swing span and a fifth swing span, and carried a double-track railway.The swing bridge runs east west, the swing section is closer to the east bank of the river. (Ordnance Survey, 1891, 1:2500) Pier foundations for the bridge spans were of base diameter cast iron cylinders, which tapered to diameter at the high water level, each column was around long. The piers were sunk into the river alluvium using a mass placed on them, and then by the pneumatic Caisson process until bedrock was reached. The tubes were then filled with Portland cement concrete to within of the top, the final fill was with brickwork with a top course of granite. The river abuttments were of brick with stone dressing. The fixed spans were long, made of three wrought iron hogback plate girders each, resting on three piers. The swing span was constructed of three hogback wrought iron box girders, each long, each box girder having a thickness of made of plates thick. In addition to the transverse deck girders the swing span was also braced by three transverse frames, which also served to support a bridgeman's hut over the centre of the bridge. The swing span was supported and turned on 26 conical rollers, which were supported by an annular box girder high by wide, itself resting on six of the cast iron piers with approximately of the pier sunk into the river bed. The bridge rotated around a central column, which contained a hydraulic accumulator of stroke, with diameter ram loaded to , used to power the turning mechanism. The bridge was turned by a three-cylinder hydraulic motor (duplicated for redundancy), and gears. The accumulator was charged by steam engines, also duplicated. The engines were supplied by field boilers also located on the central pier. When in the closed position a hydraulic mechanism at either end of the bridge was used to lock the bridge in position. The bridge could be opened in 50 seconds. The bridge superstructure was designed was T.E. Harrison of the NER, and erected by Pease, Hutchinson and Company (Skerne Ironworks). The fixed spans were supplied by Butler and Pitts (Stanningley),Sheardown, Doncaster in 1869, p.72 , errata 12 March 1869, p.195 the hydraulic motors were of the design of Sir W.G. Armstrong. The swing span weighed , the weight of iron in the piers , with of iron in the girders. The swing span opening was over in width, with a height above high water when closed of over , The swing pier included a river jetty long. The bridge was crossed by NER officials in 1868,Sheardown, Doncaster in 1868, p.63 and the line opened on 2 August 1869.Sheardown, Doncaster in 1869, p.71 Working history Columns and underside of bridge looking towards central pier (2008) On 21 March 1922, the river pier and engine room of the swing span was badly damaged by fire. In May 1933, the LNER had a miniature thumb switch controlled signalling frame installed at the bridge by Westinghouse, at the same time the line from Staddlethorpe to Goole had colour light signalling installed; both were early examples of either technology in use. At the same time, two signal boxes at either end of the bridge were closed. The bridge has had several collisions with water-going ships. On 21 December 1973, the bridge was struck by a German coaster (Vineta ), causing one of the spans to fall into the river, leaving the bridge unworkable for nine months. On 2 August 1976, Danish vessel Leon Sif () hit one of the bridge's piers. British Rail began closure procedures for the railway line due to costs associated repairing the bridge's pier, estimated at £2 million, coupled with a historic failure to get adequate compensation for damage to the bridge caused by shipping. In 1987, the structure was given a grade II* listing by English Heritage. On 23 November 1988, one of the fixed spans was pushed out of alignment by a collision with the Swedish vessel Samo (), which became trapped between the bridge's piers. By the early 21st century, understrength girders and corrosion had led to the line speed over the bridge being reduced to for passenger trains, down to only for trains with a route availability of 9 or more. In 2009, a modernisation programme began – Clancy Docwra installed services (telecoms, fresh and waste water, electricity, signalling) to the central pier through piping under the river bed. Carillion was appointed main contractor in March 2010. The bridge steelwork was repaired and upgraded over a six-week line closure starting in October 2010 – over 400 tonnes of steelwork was installed including diagonal transverse braces, and stiffening to the girders of the web. Additional work included track renewal and painting of the bridge. The total cost of the project was £6 million; the firm of Pell Frischmann was the designing engineer.

Hitobashira can also refer to workers who were buried alive under inhumane conditions. History Some of the earliest written records of hitobashira can be found in the Nihon Shoki (The Chronicles of Japan). One story centered on Emperor Nintoku (323 A.D.) discusses the overflowing of the Kitakawa and Mamuta Rivers. Protection against the torrent was beyond the ability of the stricken populace. The Emperor had a divine revelation in his dream to the effect that there was a person named Kowakubi in the province of Musashi and a person called Koromono- ko in the province of Kawachi. If they should be sacrificed to deities of the two rivers respectively, then the construction of embankments would be easily achieved. Kowakubi was subsequently thrown into the torrent of the Kitakawa river, with a prayer offered to the deity of river. After the sacrifice the embankment was constructed, Koromono-ko however escaped being sacrificed. The Yasutomi-ki, a diary from the 15th century, documents the famous tradition of \\"Nagara-no Hitobashira\\". According to the tradition, a woman who was carrying a boy on her back was caught while she was passing along the river Nagara and was buried at the place where a large bridge was then to be built. Hitobashira traditions were almost always practiced in conjunction with the building of complex, dangerous, often water-related projects, such as bridges. The stories of hitobashira were believed to inspire a spirit of self-sacrifice in people. Stories of hitobashira and other human sacrifices were common in Japan as late as the sixteenth century. Architectural examples=Maruoka Castle The keep of Maruoka Castle Maruoka Castle is one of the oldest surviving castles in Japan and is rumored to have been constructed with a human pillar which can be found in the legend of \\"O-shizu, Hitobashira\\". When Shibata Katsutoyo, the nephew of Shibata Katsuie, was building a castle in Maruoka, the stone wall of the castle kept collapsing no matter how many times it was piled up. There was one vassal who suggested that they should make someone a human sacrifice (hitobashira). O-shizu, a one-eyed woman who had two children and lived a poor life, was selected as the Hitobashira. She resolved to become one on the condition that one of her children be made a samurai. She was buried under the central pillar of the castle keep. Soon after that the construction of the castle keep was successfully completed. But Katsutoyo was transferred to another province and her son was not made a samurai. Her spirit felt resentful and made the moat overflow with spring rain when the season of cutting algae came in April every year. People called it, \\"the rain caused by the tears of O-shizu's sorrow\\" and erected a small tomb to soothe her spirit. There was a poem handed down,\\"The rain which falls when the season of cutting algae comes Is the rain reminiscent of the tears of the poor O-shizu's sorrow\\". It has been commented that the instability of the walls of Maruoka Castle was likely caused by the design of the castle. Although built in the Momoyama period (1575-1600) the design is more indicative of earlier fortresses, the steep base features random-style stone piling which is suggested as the source of instability in the walls which may have led to the use of a human pillar during its construction. Matsue Ohashi Bridge Memorial at the foot of the Matsue Ohashi Bridge The Matsue Ohashi Bridge according to legend used a human sacrifice in its construction. The nearby park is named Gensuke in honour of the human sacrifice along with a memorial dedicated to the victims who died during the bridge's construction. When Horio Yoshiharu, the great general who became daimyō of Izumo in the Keichō era, first undertook to put a bridge over the mouth of this river, the builders laboured in vain; for there appeared to be no solid bottom for the pillars of the bridge to rest upon. Millions of great stones were cast into the river to no purpose, for the work constructed by day was swept away or swallowed up by night. Nevertheless, at last the bridge was built, but the pillars began to sink soon after it was finished; then a flood carried half of it away and as often as it was repaired so often it was wrecked. Then a human sacrifice was made to appease the vexed spirits of the flood. A man was buried alive in the river-bed below the place of the middle pillar, where the current is most treacherous, and thereafter the bridge remained immovable for three hundred years. This victim was called Gensuke who had lived in the street of Saikamachi. It had been determined that the first man who should cross the bridge wearing a hakama without a machi (a stiff piece of material to keep the folds of the garment perpendicular and neat-looking) should be put under the bridge. Gensuke passed over the bridge without a machi in his hakama and was sacrificed. The middle-most pillar of the bridge was for three hundred years called by his name \\"Gensuke-bashira\\". Some believe the name Gensuke was not the name of a man but the name of an era, corrupted by local dialect. The legend is so profoundly believed, that when the new bridge was being built (c.1891) thousands of country folk were afraid to come to town; for rumours arose that a new victim was needed, who was to be chosen from among them. Matsue Castle Matsue castle keep According to legend the Matsue Castle is also said to have been constructed on a human sacrifice that was buried under the castle's stone walls. Her name has never been recorded, and nothing concerning her is remembered except that she is thought to have been a beautiful young maiden who was fond of dancing and is referred to as simply the maiden of Matsue. After the castle was built, a law was passed forbidding any girl to dance in the streets of Matsue because the hill Oshiroyama would shudder and the castle would shake from \\"top to bottom\\". Other examples In Wanouchi, Gifu during the 1754 Horeki River Improvement Incident which involved the difficult and dangerous construction of river embankments, a local retainer voluntarily gave his life by remaining under the rushing water in order to keep a foundation pillar from moving until it could be secured from above. As well as aiding in the construction, this sacrifice was also treated as an offering to the gods ensuring the successful completing of the project (i.e., a hitobashira).

Dedicated on February 13, 1971, the mall opened amid three days of fanfare and dreams of a revitalized downtown. Conflict over the scope and use of the mall began immediately and continued for 30 years until the last remaining parts of the mall were opened to automobile traffic. At that time, a former Eugene mayor commented that the city's dreams for a bright future just hadn't worked. Many residents, however, shared the much-earlier view of a former downtown merchant, that Eugene had sustained more damage from the mall than it would have from a natural disaster. History Eugene Mall construction in 1970. The view is from 10th Avenue looking north down Willamette Street. Image courtesy of the Lane County Historical Museum The Post–World War II economic expansion created a gradual exodus from city core areas in the United States, and federally funded urban renewal projects empowered communities to demolish historic downtown areas and build new, modern structures. With dramatic increases in automobile purchases accompanied by a post-WWII decline in public transportation, many communities accepted urban renewal financing to demolish buildings and install much-needed parking areas.In Eugene, for example, out of 186 buildings targeted by urban renewal officials before 1975, 115 were demolished, 53 were \\"rehabilitated,\\" and only 18 were left untouched. As climate-controlled, suburban shopping centers became common in the 1960s, communities began to explore ways of drawing retail and entertainment business back into downtown areas. An experimental method of encouraging business was a downtown mall. One researcher found that approximately 200 pedestrian malls were constructed in the United States by the close of the 20th century, although only 15 remained in 2013. An Early prediction of the Eugene Mall In 1963, a Lane County planning director predicted that by 1980, residents of Eugene would live in an age of push-button automation where hands-free cars would speed them into the city core, and they could park in multi-story structures and be whisked on moving sidewalks to an extensive, plastic-covered shoppers' mall. But the idea of the Eugene Mall had been considered by civic leaders prior to the 1960s. In 1945, for example, Fred Cuthbert proposed closing Willamette Street to cars in order to create a landscaped pedestrian oasis in the center of town, and he suggested parking along the perimeter. As part of the Eugene Centennial Celebration in 1959, a section of Broadway from Oak Street to Charnelton Street was closed to motor traffic, and pedestrians were delighted. By 1968 the city council was discussing a federally funded urban renewal project to build the Eugene Mall. University of Oregon east campus Community leaders in 1961 had responded to demands for more student housing at the University of Oregon with a project known as the East Campus Urban Renewal. The project demolished historic homes east of the university and constructed large residence complexes surrounded by a landscaped campus that opened in 1965. Some reasoned that if a mall environment could work on a college campus, it would surely work in the downtown business district. Valley River Center Discussions about the need for a downtown mall intensified when Valley River Center (VRC) opened in 1969. The new shopping center was a modern, climate controlled environment with anchor stores and upscale retail and food outlets. And the VRC offered 4000 free parking spaces. Eugene inventoried its downtown holdings and found four major department stores, 170 to 200 retail outlets, and an estimated 500 firms including banks and professional offices. Most of the 3000 public parking spaces were metered. Groundbreaking for the Eugene Mall Civic leaders determined that the time for a downtown mall had arrived, and construction began May 2, 1970, almost exactly nine months after the opening of Valley River Center. Geography and amenities The mall's north–south axis extended on Willamette Street from roughly Eighth Avenue to Eleventh Avenue, with automobile traffic crossing the mall at Tenth Avenue. City bus traffic parked along Tenth Avenue, creating a downtown transfer station. Broadway, a street named in lieu of Ninth Avenue, formed the mall's east–west axis from Charnelton Street to Oak Street. The mall included five restrooms, two playground areas, and three water features. Largest of the water features was a cement fountain and water pools at the intersection of Willamette and Broadway. Seating areas were stationed at various locations on the mall. Later, approximately three more blocks were included in the mall, expanding along Olive Street from Eighth Avenue to Tenth Avenue. Covered walkways were placed in alleys within the mall area. Economic and social climate The Eugene Mall opened at a time of economic uncertainty and limited consumer confidence. Inflation briefly had risen above six percent. Wage and price controls would be in effect on August 15, 1971. But most troublesome to urban retail centers, corporate retailers were no longer investing in large, stand- alone department stores. Increasingly, corporate emphasis was on vacating downtown areas and moving to suburban shopping centers. Tax incentives allowing accelerated depreciation favored construction of enclosed, suburban malls over freestanding retail outlets. Social activism had existed in Eugene prior to the mall's opening, and it had both a loyal following and an infrastructure. When Eugene acquired a large, landscaped, outdoor public-use venue with convenient public transportation, it seemed in fulfillment of deeply held social needs that were not dependent upon retail sales. People angry about the Vietnam War gathered on the mall. The mall was an ongoing location for counter-cultural activity. Retail customers experienced unhappiness at the widening generation gap. When Springfield Creamery owner Chuck Kesey, brother of author Ken Kesey, brought the Grateful Dead to the Oregon Renaissance Faire to play a benefit concert for the creamery in 1972, the Eugene Mall seemed like a good waiting room for the next concert. That concert did not occur until 1982. Immediate difficulties At the June 16, 1971, Eugene City Council meeting, the council adopted an ordinance enforcing seven pages of rules prohibiting some behaviors at the mall. The mall had been open only four months, but in that time it had become a place for young people to \\"hang out.\\" They lounged on the lawns, climbed on the main plaza fountain, and waded in fountain pools. The council tabled an ordinance requiring parental consent before purchase of toxic glue, although community leaders expressed concern about the dangers of glue sniffing. The presence of a transient, non-customer population on the mall would be a frequent challenge for merchants. Some older merchants operating downtown were displaced by the mall. In referring to what he called \\"the problem of older people,\\" the chairman of the Eugene Renewal Agency expressed sadness that the elderly would like to have \\"hung on\\" but couldn't. Almost from the beginning, city leaders had tried to regulate public use of the mall with permits and fees required for organized activities. At times, the regulations escalated tensions between city government and citizens trying to enjoy the mall, although the city was not able to devise an effective method of resolving tensions. The mall burdened existing city infrastructure, and in 1972 the city began a street- widening project around the mall's perimeter. The extra traffic lanes were necessary to absorb cars which had been diverted from streets within the mall area. Street lighting was inadequate, and in that year the city installed 19 bright lights 60-feet high in order to double the first-year light levels. Parking Parking fees had been listed as a major deterrent to downtown shopping on the Eugene Mall. In 1973 the city created a free parking zone around the mall that included 2200 spaces with no time limits. Effects on retail sales from the free parking zone may have been marginal, and the plan further limited city revenue. Bates found that concerns over parking at pedestrian malls are much more important in the United States than in Europe. Shift away from retail Economic conditions in the 1970s had not favored downtown retailers, but urban renewal efforts and tax incentives had benefited the builders of professional and government offices on streets adjacent to the mall. Oak Street, for example, had become the new Main Street. One developer envisioned Eugene as the headquarters of financial institutions, and his view of retail was, \\"good riddance.\\" End of the Eugene Mall In 1984, the city council voted to demolish a portion of the mall on Willamette Street from Tenth Avenue to Eleventh Avenue and return the street to automobile traffic for the first time in 15 years. Business owners celebrated and hailed a new beginning for downtown Eugene. As early as 1983, civic leaders had discussed confining the mall to a three-block, climate controlled area, but in 1985 plans for the indoor downtown mall were rejected. Voters reopened Olive Street to motorized traffic in 1992, and in 1995 Willamette Street was reopened. By 2001, a three-block section of Broadway was all that remained of the Eugene Mall, and voters were asked to remove it. In a special election September 18, 2001, Eugene residents approved by 67 percent a plan to reopen the final section of the mall to motor traffic. Since its beginning, the mall had been blamed for the flight of business from downtown. The mall had not been able to attract housing for urban professionals and had not offered a sustainable nightlife, yet it had always been home to transients and panhandlers. Community leaders could not develop the mall. Potential customers did not enjoy the mall and rarely had reason to go there. But the explanations about the failure of the Eugene Mall were not sufficient to address why some businesses and government offices could not survive downtown. After the mall's removal, exodus from downtown continued. In 2006, the federal courthouse fled downtown and opened in a new building only blocks away. In 2012, the downtown urgent care clinic and medical office building closed and was demolished. Student housing opened on that site in 2013. Also in 2012, the Eugene Police Department moved out of downtown when City Hall was abandoned.

Frey was also a businesswoman and a social studies teacher at Clark Junior High School, where she also developed the curriculum for the students.  Early life  Frey was born near Huggins, MO, to Albert Frey and Gladys (Maxvill) Frey, and grew up in the area attending Oak Grove, Number One (Ballard) and Long Valley elementary schools. A few days after her 17th birthday, she began her first teaching job at Long Valley — the same one-room school that she had attended earlier. When she completed her bachelor's degree in 1957, from Southwest Missouri State College, she was hired by the Anchorage, Alaska, School District, where she taught and later became social studies coordinator. In addition, she earned two master's degrees (History and English) and a doctorate in Women's History and was selected for a Fulbright Scholarship to go to India for two months with 20 social studies educators from all over the United States. After 26 years of teaching, she retired and — along with two other teachers — started a business in Alaska called The Learning Tree. They traveled around the state and helped school districts develop curriculum and train teachers, and she wrote and published curriculum on Alaska's history and Alaskan Natives. Later, she also co-owned a bookstore for a while, commercially fished for red salmon, and sold real estate. In 1994, she left Alaska and moved back to Missouri to a home overlooking Pomme de Terre Lake. There, she became involved in real estate again and joined the Missouri Master Gardeners group and the local archeology group, among others.  Career  Lucy Frey was also the co-owner of the Alaska Women's Bookstore, which inadvertently served as a communal resource site for women in Anchorage. The bookstore became a resource center for women when it began taking in other feminist organizations throughout the community that were closing, often due to losses in funding. Lucy Frey also wrote her own work titled \\"One Woman, One Women's Bookstore: Case Study and Comment on the Place of a Women's Bookstore in a Community\\" published in 1985, in which she discusses the Women's Bookstore Movement and the significance it has had on women's equality as well as other insight on women's bookstores and what it takes for someone to effectively open one in their own community.

The concept is used in cancer survival analyses. Many cancer studies aim to assess the time between two events of interest, such as from treatment to remission, treatment to relapse, or diagnosis to death. This duration is generically called survival time, even if the end point is not death. Time-to-event studies must have sufficiently long follow-up durations to capture enough events to reveal meaningful patterns in the data. A short follow-up duration is appropriate for studying very severe cancers with poor prognoses, whereas a long follow-up duration is better suited to studying less-severe disease, or participants with good prognoses.Clark, M.

The type species is Cryptomarasmius corbariensis (formerly Marasmius corbariensis and originally Agaricus androsaceus var. hygrometricus, first described in 1852 by Vincenzo Briganti). Cryptomarasmius combines the words crypto meaning \\"hidden\\" and Marasmius, alluding to the historical placement of the species within Marasmius as well as the often hidden, minute fruit bodies they produce. A more recent studies show Cryptomarasmius to be a sister taxon to Naiadolina. Species Fourteen species were originally transferred to Cryptomarasmius from Marasmius. The authors suggest that there are several more that should probably be moved from section Hygrometrici, but they only made new combinations for those species with type specimens that were available for DNA sequencing or study.

The commission submitted the report to the Government of India on 31 August 2011. The Expert Panel approached the project through a set of tasks such as: # Compilation of readily available information about Western Ghats # Development of Geo-spatial database based on environmental sensitivity, and # Consultation with Government bodies and Civil society groups. Certain sections of people in Kerala, strongly protested the implementation of the report since most of the farmers obtained their livelihood from the hilly regions in Wayanad. During the 20th century, a very large number of people had migrated from southern Kerala and acquired forest land in Wayanad and other areas.

The report was considered by UNESCO, which added the 39 serial sites of the Western Ghats on the World Heritage List. Kasturirangan Report The Kasturirangan Commission has sought to balance the two concerns of development and environment protection, by watering down the environmental regulation regime proposed by the Western Ghats Ecology Experts Panel’s Gadgil report in 2012. The Kasturirangan report seeks to bring just 37% of the Western Ghats under the Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA) zones — down from the 64% suggested by the Gadgil report. Dr. V.S. Vijayan, member of the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) said recommendations of the Kasturirangan report are undemocratic and anti-environmental. A crucial report on Western Ghats prepared by K. Kasturirangan-led high-level working group (HLWG) has recommended prohibition on development activities in 60,000 km2 ecologically sensitive area spread over Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Goa, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The 10-member panel, constituted to examine the Western Ghats ecology expert panel report prepared under the leadership of environmentalist Madhav Gadgil, has also moved away from the suggestions of the Gadgil panel. The Gadgil panel had recommended a blanket approach consisting of guidelines for sector-wise activities, which could be permitted in the ecologically sensitive zones. Livelihood options \\"Environmentally sound development cannot preclude livelihood and economic options for this region... The answer (to the question of how to manage and conserve the Ghats) will not lie in removing these economic options, but in providing better incentives to move them towards greener and more sustainable practices,\\" the HLWG report says. The panel submitted the report to Environment Minister Jayanthi Natarajan. Prohibitory regime Roughly 37 per cent of the total area defined as the boundary of the Western Ghats is ecologically sensitive. Over this area of some 60,000 km2, spread over the States of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the working group has recommended a prohibitory regime on those activities with maximum interventionist and destructive impact on the environment, the panel says in its report. The Working Group was constituted to advise the government on the recommendations of an earlier report of ecologist Madhav Gadgil-led \\"Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel\\" (WGEEP). The WGEEP had recommended 64% of Western Ghats to be declared as an ecologically sensitive area. It had suggested three levels of categorization where regulatory measures for protection would be imposed and had recommended the establishment of the Western Ghats Ecology Authority for management of the Ghats. The 10-member Working Group, headed by Planning Commission member Kasturirangan, has environmental experts and other professionals as its members. \\"The Western Ghats is a biological treasure trove that is endangered, and it needs to be protected and regenerated, indeed celebrated for its enormous wealth of endemic species and natural beauty\\", the report says. Natarajan said that the recommendations would be looked into urgently so that action can be taken to address these challenges. Kasturirangan said, \\"The message of this report is serious, alarming and urgent. It is imperative that we protect, manage and regenerate the lands now remaining in the Western Ghats as biologically rich, diverse, natural landscapes\\".

He was appointed Escribano Real for his Majesty Felipe II de España, and held various honorary posts in the territories of the Viceroyalty of Peru, including as Mayor of Buenos Aires and Corrientes, Notary public, and Regidor of the Cabildo of Buenos Aires.  Biography  He was born in Jerez de la Frontera, Cádiz, Spain, the son of Diego Pérez de Burgos and Beatriz Martínez de Tremal, belonging to a distinguished Andalusian family. He possibly did his studies in Seville, and arrival in the Río de La Plata from Cádiz in 1581. He lived in Asunción and settled in Buenos Aries in 1583, where he married Juana de Aguilar y Salvatierra, daughter of Leonor de Zamora and her first husband Andrés Gil, natives of Ronda. Burgos was the successor of Antón García Caro, in the position of notary of Buenos Aires. He served as notary public and of Cabildo until 1606, being replaced by Manuel Martin. In 1606, Burgos presented before the City Council, his title of Royal Notary of the Spanish Indies, signed on February 11, 1581 by the King Philip II of Spain. He had an active participation as a government notary in the Río de la Plata. In 1584 he officiated the notarial deed in the interrogation conducted by Conquistador Don Juan de Torres de Vera y Aragón, against three English pirates, who had been persecuted by the Charruas Indians in the territory of Santa Fe Province. One of these pirates was John Drake, the nephew of Francis Drake. Burgos belonged to the second contingent of settlers established in the city of Buenos Aires. He also living in the provinces of San Miguel de Tucumán, Santa Fe and Corrientes. In 1596, he was appointed by Juan Ramírez de Velasco, to exercise the position of Alcalde and Justicia Mayor of Corrientes. Francisco Pérez de Burgos also served as Mayor of Buenos Aires, and Captain in the Fuerte de Buenos Aires. In 1614 he was elected regidor and appointed as fiel ejecutor of Buenos Aires, being replaced in that position on July 21 of that year by Francisco García Romero, a politician born in Extremadura. He continued to serve as deputy of the City Council of Buenos Aires until 1616, and died in the same city on July 21, 1617. He also devoted himself to agriculture and took part in the hunting of cimarron cattle in the Province of Buenos Aires. In 1604 he received land grants in the Paraná River by Hernando Arias de Saavedra, governor of Buenos Aires. He was the owner of a farm located on the Riachuelo to the south of the city. The passage of Burgos (pasaje de Burgos) today Puente Alsina, owes its name to Francisco Pérez de Burgos. During the British invasions of the Río de la Plata, the Burgos passage was crossed by the English troops to enter the city of Buenos Aires.  Family  Francisco Pérez de Burgos were the parents of numerous sons and daughters, among them Leonor de Aguilar Pérez de Burgos, who was married to Francisco de Manzanares y Dardos, a Spanish official born in Toledo, and Catalina Burgos de Aguilar y Salvatierra, wife of Juan Rodriguez de Estela, among whose descendants are Feliciano Pueyrredón and Juan Martín de Pueyrredón. The lineage of the Pérez de Burgos family possibly has its origin in Garci Perez de Burgos or Ferrán Pérez de Burgos, a Spanish nobleman from Burgos, who participated in the Conquista of Jerez de la Frontera, and who served as vassal of the Kings of Castile.

Born in Colborne, Northumberland County, Ontario, the only surviving child of William Harold and Ethel Nobles, she spent her early life at the family farm in Vernonville. She was an authority of the culture and identification of wood-rotting fungi, and developed a numerical identification system today known as the \\"Nobles Species Code\\". Nobles died in Ottawa, Ontario after a short illness. She was awarded the \\"Distinguished Mycologist\\" award, along with Rolf Singer, by the Mycological Society of America in 1986. Education Mildred’s family relocated to Regina Saskatchewan due to her father’s poor health, where she attended public schools and the Collegiate Institute. She later taught in multigrade schools around Regina. In the fall of 1927, Mildred entered Queen's University then later graduated in May 1929 with a B.A. (Honours) in Biology and Chemistry. She dreamt of working at the Central Experimental Farm in Ottawa so she applied for a summer student position. Initially, she was rejected during her interview due to being a woman however, she ended up getting hired later that day after being introduced to the mycologist Dr. Irene Mounce who advocated for her hire. Working for the summer under Dr. Mounce kicked off her career focus in mycology. Mildred then attended graduate school at the University of Toronto. Her graduate studies were carried out under H.S. Jackson and her 1931 M.A. thesis was titled The fungus flora of some local soils. In 1935 she completed her Ph.D. after writing a dissertation on Conidial cycles in the Thelephoraceae. Career Nobles’ mycological career was spent with the Canadian Department of Agriculture in Ottawa. In 1935 she was appointed Assistant Botanist and Plant Pathologist, and by 1959 she became Principal Mycologist. Despite being born with spina bifida Nobles was not deterred from doing fieldwork and traveling. Nobles undertook pioneering research in identifying wood-destroying fungi and was eventually established as a world authority in this field. In 1948 she published a manual for the identification of wood-destroying fungi based on their cultural characteristics. Each species had a numerical code known as Nobles' species code. This key and an identification service was used for investigations in forest management by Forest Pathologists across Canada and contributed to the solution of many decay problems. During the 1940s and 1950s Nobles’ lab was the centre for identification of cultured wood-destroying fungi for the Canadian Forestry Service. The goal was to determine the quantity and quality of wood decay occurring in forests across Canada. In 1965 Nobles published a multiple choice key to replace her 1948 publication to further simplify the identification of wood decay fungi species.

It has a circumboreal distribution, and is native to North America and Eurasia. In the United States it is primarily found in the Northeast and Midwest extending south into the Appalachian Mountains, with disjunct populations westward in the Rocky Mountains. It has a wide-ranging natural habitat, is in found in forests, bogs, fens, and rock outcrops. Carex brunnescens is morphologically variable across its wide range. It has a different morphology when growing in shade vs. sunlight. Shade growing specimens tends to be slender and weak-stemmed with green scales, and sun growing specimens tend to be stiffly erect with brown scales. The degree of variation in this species warrants further taxonomic study.

It was released in April 2013 by Quietmoney Recordings and distributed by Proper Records. The album was recorded in Hastings, Sussex, England and produced by James McMillan. It features Mark Edwards (piano), Gwilym Simcock (piano), Julian Siegel (bass clarinet) and Kirk Whalum (tenor saxophone) with orchestration and big band arrangements by Chris Walden, and includes Sophie Bancroft's song \\"Calgary Bay\\", performed with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. The album received four-starred reviews in The Observer, The Guardian, the London Evening Standard and LondonJazz. Reception In a four- starred review for The Guardian, John Fordham said: \\"Carroll's subtle pitching, tone colouration and jazz improviser's timing reinvent Here's to Life as a distilled understatement accompanied only by acoustic guitar; her earthiness is revealingly complemented by soft strings on Goodbye; and Mad About the Boy is so slow as to be prayer-like\\". Peter Quinn, for Jazzwise Magazine, said \\"Ballads sees Liane nail 11 terrific songs in magisterial fashion... Widely recorded by instrumentalists (Cannonball Adderley, McCoy Tyner) and vocalists (Dinah Washington, Frank Sinatra) alike, ‘Goodbye’ has always been an exceptional song, but in Liane's hands it charts untold depths of emotion. This is one of the few indispensable vocal jazz albums of recent years\\". Dave Gelly in The Observer, gave the album four stars and said of Carroll's performance on Ballads that \\"Surrounded by a changing cast of the best musicians around, illuminated by piquant arrangements, her singing takes on a new, glowing depth\\". Chris Parker, reviewing the album for LondonJazz, said: \\"Carroll does not merely interpret these songs, she inhabits them, intimately confiding in her listeners so that everything from Todd Rundgren's ‘Pretending to Care’ and Carole King's ‘Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow’ to more conventional jazz standards (‘Mad About the Boy’, ‘My One and Only Love’) is imbued with unaffectedly sincere, heartfelt emotion\\". Bruce Lindsay, for All About Jazz, described Carroll's performance of \\"Mad About The Boy\\" as \\"heartbreaking\\". \\"She sings as though she's aware of the futility of her desire but unwilling, or unable, to leave it behind. It shows the greatness of Coward's little ditty, the many emotions that the song can reveal – and the majesty of Carroll's voice. It's just one highlight of many on this exquisite album: Ballads is a classic-in-waiting\\". Jack Massarick, in a four-starred review for the London Evening Standard, said; \\"[W]ith symphonic strings or just solo piano or guitar cushioning her tranquil path, there's abundant time to savour her tender side and the mature timbre of her voice\\".

Sheep are particularly susceptible to flystrike because their thick wool, if sufficiently contaminated with urine and faecal material, can provide effective breeding ground for maggots even in the relative absence of wounds. Causes Flystrike in sheep is a condition where parasitic flies lay eggs on soiled wool or open wounds. After hatching, the maggots bury themselves in the sheep's wool and eventually under the sheep's skin, feeding off their flesh. Once the larvae develop, flies continue to deposit eggs on to new or already infected sheep, starting the infection process over again. Sheep display symptoms such as agitation, poor doing, odour and matted wool, all of which further encourage the attraction of flies. Fly strike can be lethal for sheep due to ammonia poisoning. Fly strike is problematic, not only causing loss or degradation of stock, but also requiring expenditure of both money and time for effective management. In Australia, Lucilia cuprina causes about 90% of infestations, and Chrysomya rufifacies is the most common secondary pest that targets wounds caused by L. cuprina. Identification of infected sheep Flystrike sheep are identified in the flock by characteristic green or wet- looking patches in the sheep's fleece, usually around the haunches or tail, or at the site of an open wound, where wool can create a damper area which is more attractive to flies. In male sheep the penile region is also a common area for flystrike to occur. When the flock settle, infected sheep will display signs of agitation, such as foot stamping or turning to nibble their body. Flystruck animals often have a strong characteristic odour and in severe cases, the wet-looking wool can begin to shed. Fahy, L., Lauber, M., & Suter, R. (2011). Flystrike. Retrieved 10 2013, from Department of Environment and Primary Industries. Fly strike is more likely to be found in favorable environmental conditions such as temperatures between , recent rain, and wind speeds below . The peak UK Green Bottle breeding season tends to be in late June or July, but Flystrike can occur at any time warm damp conditions prevail and Green Bottles are active. Prevention There are several preventative measures which are used to reduce the occurrence of flystrike in sheep flocks, these include: * Controlling intestinal parasites to prevent scours and a suitable surface for flystrike * Scheduled shearing and crutching * Removing the tails of lambs at weaning * Mulesing * Preventative chemical treatments before fly infestation risk is high * Breeding for traits that reduce the likelihood of infestation * Removing or avoiding large manure heaps or other sites attractive to the flies * Using fly traps near the flock to attract and kill any local flies, helping to minimise the local populations. NB: Traps often emit a pungent smell and are best placed away from human activity. None of these measures completely stop the occurrence of fly strike in sheep, and regular treatment is still necessary.Fahy, L., Lauber, M., & Suter, R. (2011). Flystrike.

The farm is run as a charity focusing on education, youth work, animal care and horticulture and is a centre for Riding for the Disabled.  History  Vauxhall City Farm was founded in 1977 as Jubilee City Farm by a group of architects squatting at St Oswald's Place, following large-scale demolitions in the neighbourhood between 1972 and 1976. The farm contains animals such as alpacas, sheep, goats and pigs which are used for the farm's education and youth work as well as for filming and photo-shoots. The farm's pigs have appeared on the Alan Titchmarsh Show and the goats were used to graze a meadow on the roof of the Queen Elizabeth Hall on the South Bank in 2013. In April 2009 BBC London's 'Farmyard Cam' streamed live footage of the sheep at the farm. In October 2013, Vauxhall City Farm was approved for planning permission to provide a major overhaul of the farm alongside new affordable housing. In 2013, the farm was also granted a fund from Sport England and The National Lottery to build three new stables. The farm celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2017.  Projects and services  Entrance to the farm is free, and there is a cafe and gift shop. The farm operates a therapy riding centre as well as youth and animal projects. Former riders at the farm include Sam Martin, who trained to take part in the 2016 Summer Olympics. In November 2011 the farm offered twenty London families free riding lessons run by European Dressage Championship gold medalist Emile Faurie. It also hosts a group of Spinners who make yarn from the wool of the sheep and alpacas using dyes cultivated from vegetables and plants grown on the site. The farm's riding school offers lessons for people with disabilities, while children can “own a pony” during school holidays to learn how to muck them out and ride them. A scheme with local schools and nurseries allows children to watch chicks hatch in their classrooms.

During the war, Lee Ho-cheol was drafted into the North Korean army and sent to the front in the South. He eventually rejoined his family in his native town, but ultimately decided to move to South Korea by himself.

It is served by two priests, one representing the Kalikot district, and the other Bajura district . Myth Shiva carrying the corpse of his consort Sati. According to Hindu legend, when Sati Devi's father Daksha Prajapati was performing a yagya, he invited all the Gods except Mahadev to the ceremony. Sati went to her father's yagya ceremony and asked him why he had not invited her husband. Daksha Prajapati answered that Mahadev drank alcohol, smoked ganja, slept in cemeteries, wore a serpent around his neck, had dreadlocks, covered his body with ash, and wore tiger hide, hence he was unsuitable to attend such an important yagya. Unable to tolerate this insult to her husband, Sati jumped into the yagya fire and gave up her life. Mahadev was so angered by her death that he sent Birbhadra and Bhoot gana to kill Daksha Prajapati and destroy the yagya. After exacting his vengeance, Mahadev started to mourn his wife. Mahadev traveled across the world carrying Sati's corpse. During this time, Vishnu released his Sudarshan chakra and wounded Sati's body so that it could be infested by insects and rot. As Sati's body started to disintegrate, the ground on which her body parts fell became Shakti Peethas, places of worship. In this process, her left shoulder fell on the Mallagiri mountain. Mallagiri was then referred to as Malika.

A member of Anonymous, known by the online handle \\"The Messiah\\", claimed responsibility for spearheading the attacks. On 12 November 2013, James Raj was charged in Singapore court as the alleged \\"Messiah\\". Background On 1 June 2013, a set of web censorship regulations drafted by the Media Development Authority became effective in Singapore. Under the new rules, > websites with at least 50,000 unique visitors from Singapore every month > that publish at least one local news article per week over a period of two > months ... will have to remove 'prohibited content' such as articles that > undermine 'racial or religious harmony' within 24 hours of being notified by > Singapore's media regulator. In response to concerns regarding the new rules, government officials responded that they \\"do not impinge on internet freedom\\". Incidents The hacked version of Irene Tham's The Straits Times blog On 28 November 2013, the attacks began with the People's Action Party's Community Foundation's webpage being hacked, followed by the official website of the Ang Mo Kio Town Council. Site administrators locked the site thereafter and a police report was made. Two days later, a purported member of Anonymous uploaded a four-minute-long video on YouTube, in which he, wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, threatened to \\"bring down key infrastructure in Singapore\\". He also urged Singaporeans to don red and black on 5 November as well as black out their Facebook profile pictures. In the video, he made reference to The Messiah, who he called \\"one of [Anonymous'] comrades\\". The Straits Times news reporter Irene Tham posted a critique of the video on her newspaper blog. In retaliation, the Messiah defaced the blog, its title being changed to \\"Dear ST [Straits Times]: You just got hacked for misleading the people!\\". The Messiah edited the article to state that Tham had misconstrued his speech, \\"conveniently modifying the sentence 'war against the Singapore government' into 'war against Singapore'.\\" He also urged Tham to either apologise within two days or resign from her job as a result of her \\"blasphemous lies\\". Later on, in an email to Yahoo Singapore, The Messiah said > we reached out to our comrades from other fractions [sic] who together with > us performed DNS poisoning on the .gov.sg sites, taking them down for a > period of time. But there must have also been some patching that was done as > some of our favourite point of entries into their networks seemed to be > fixed. On 3 November, the website of the Seletar Airport was hacked. Its webpage replaced with a black and green background with an image in the middle resembling a skull wearing a hood. The site resumed normal operations 30 minutes after the hack was first noticed. On 5 November, the Twitter and YouTube accounts of Singaporean entertainer Ridhwan Azman were hacked. According to posts from the compromised account, this was in retaliation for \\"dissing the legion\\". Apart from this incident, Anonymous did not carry out any other major activity, contrary to its promise to ignite a massive protest on that date. Two days later, the hacktivists hacked into and vandalised a subpage on the website of Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, following Lee's vow to bring The Messiah and his accomplices to justice. It was later found that Mohammad Azhar Bin Tahir and Mohammad Asyiq Bin Tahir were responsible for the attacks. Additionally, the webpage of the Istana was hacked. On 20 November, the websites of 13 schools, which were hosted on a single server, were reportedly defaced between 3:30pm to 5pm. Reception News of the cyberattacks were picked up by international news outlets, including the South China Morning Post, The Huffington Post, Time, The Star, and The Jakarta Post. Regarding the hacking of the Ang Mo Kio Town Council's website, Member of Parliament Ang Hin Kee dubbed it as \\"malicious\\", promising to boost the page's security system. After the release of the YouTube video, the Government IT Security Incident Response Team immediately released an alert to all the Singaporean government agencies. The Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore responded in an official statement, \\"We are aware of the video, and the police are investigating the matter.\\" The Singapore Press Holdings (SPH), of which The Straits Times is a subsidiary, promptly took down the blog which was hacked into and filed a complaint to the police. Singaporean politician and Deputy Chairman of Singapore's Parliamentary Committee for Communications and Information, Baey Yam Keng, offered, \\"We do not know what the hacker's capabilities are, so it's important for us to take this very seriously.\\" Bertha Henson, who operates Breakfast Network, a Singaporean news outlet, felt that The Messiah's action would \\"make the government seem right, that we [independent website operators] are just troublemakers.\\" Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong pledged to hunt down the team responsible for the cyberattack, stating, \\"It is not a laughing matter.

Biography  In the winter of 2012, Candlemass founder and bassist Leif Edling started to work on a new project and wrote a few demos. Looking for musical partners, he first reached out to his friend, Opeth frontman Mikael Åkerfeldt, but due to a lack of time, he declined. Therefore, Stockholm-based guitarist Marcus Jidell (Soen, ex-Evergrey, ex-Royal Hunt) offered to help. Soon, Tiamat drummer Lars Sköld and keyboarder Carl Westholm joined the new band and the line-up was completed by Jidell's wife Jennie-Ann Smith, whose deep and bluesy voice added a new touch to Edling's typical heavy doom riffs. By September 2013, they released their first EP Moonhorse and in November, their critically acclaimed eponymous full-length debut followed through Nuclear Blast. The band's first live show outside of Sweden took place at the Dutch Roadburn Festival in April 2014, and in the fall of the same year, the Swedes released the EP All I Want. After a European tour and several festival appearances, the band entered the studio once more to record their second album. The Girl with the Raven Mask was released worldwide in October 2015 and was voted Album of the Month in several leading European magazines, such as Rock Hard and Metal Hammer. It was nominated for the independent music prize Manifest in Sweden, and in September 2016, Avatarium received the \\"Up and Coming\\" award from Germany's Metal Hammer. For health issues, Leif Edling quit playing live shows with the band on their headline tour through Europe, and Anders Iwers joined the band as a live member. Although Edling stepped out of the spotlight, he is still active as songwriter for the band. At the end of 2016, Avatarium entered the studio again to record their third album, Hurricanes and Halos, together with their new bassist Mats Rydström and organist Rickard Nilsson. This time, singer Jennie-Ann Smith and guitarist Marcus Jidell also contributed to the songwriting. The full-length album was released on 26 May 2017 through Nuclear Blast.

The implications of sfeka d'yoma are discussed in Rosh Hashanah 21a and in the commentaries and poskim. Background Before the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, and prior to the permanent establishment or \\"fixing\\" of the Hebrew solar-lunar calendar, the onset of each month, known as Rosh Chodesh (, lit. \\"head/start of the month/new moon\\") was declared by the Sanhedrin. This declaration was crucially important, as it affected the dates on which the holidays in that month would occur. The Sanhedrin would declare a new month only after accepting the testimony of two witnesses who attested to the sighting of the new moon. If the witnesses were contradicted, or not enough witnesses came forth, the Sanhedrin would convene on the following day to receive testimony. Upon accepting the testimony of two witnesses, the Sanhedrin would sanctify the new month. Messengers would then be sent throughout the Land of Israel, and bonfires lit on high places, to let everyone know the correct date of the new moon. While this system insured that Jews living in Israel would immediately know the date of the new month and, by extension, the dates of the holidays that fell in that month, the news would travel slower to Jews living outside the Land - particularly in Babylonia, where there was a large Jewish population following the destruction of the First Temple and during the era of the Second Temple. Hence, the dates on which the Jewish holidays would occur in each month would be uncertain until such time as every community would know exactly when the new month had been declared by the Sanhedrin. Since there was doubt about which day to observe the holidays, it was established that the holiday, or Yom Tov, be celebrated on two days rather than one. Based on the nature of the start of the lunar months, there could evidently be a margin of error of only one day. Fixing of the calendar A few centuries after the destruction of the Second Temple and the worldwide exile of the Jewish people, the Jewish community in Israel began to decline. The calendar was then fixed (meaning that it was permanently set up by the Jewish sages). With this fixed calendar, there is no doubt about which day the holidays in each month occur. Nevertheless, Jewish communities outside the Land of Israel continue to celebrate two days for certain Jewish holidays because that is the minhag (custom) that the Jewish sages established during an era when it was needed. This is referred to as minhag avoteinu b'yadenu (, lit. \\"the custom of our forefathers is in our hands\\") - meaning that Jews have traditionally accepted and practiced what their ancestors have handed down to them, according to the long-standing classical view that established customs may not be changed. Holidays that reflect sfeka d'yoma Sfeka d'yoma is incorporated into all holidays mentioned in the Torah (Pentateuch) with the exception of Yom Kippur. * Passover - in the Land of Israel, Passover is a seven-day holiday. Both the first day, 15 Nisan, and the last day, 21 Nisan, are celebrated as a Yom Tov. In the Jewish diaspora, the first Yom Tov is celebrated on 15 and 16 Nisan, and the last Yom Tov on 21 and 22 Nisan (thereby creating an eight-day holiday). In keeping with the principle that a sfeka d'yoma is treated as a bona fide day of Yom Tov, the Passover Seder is conducted on both the first and second nights of Passover in the Jewish diaspora. (cached under Moadim - Succot II - 5764) * Shavuot - in the Land of Israel, Shavuot is celebrated on 6 Sivan. In the Jewish diaspora, it is celebrated on 6 and 7 Sivan. * Rosh Hashana is celebrated for two days (1 and 2 Tishrei) both in the Land of Israel and outside it. This exception to the rule that sfeka d'yoma is not relevant in the Land of Israel is because Rosh Hashana is the first day of the month Tishrei. In the days of the Sanhedrin, the messengers could not leave Jerusalem on the festival itself (because of festival law restrictions). Therefore, no one in the whole Land of Israel (outside Jerusalem itself) would know when the beginning of Tishrei, and thereby the holiday of Rosh Hashana, were declared. * Sukkot - in the Land of Israel, Sukkot is a seven-day holiday, and the first day, 15 Tishrei, is celebrated as a Yom Tov. In the Jewish diaspora, the first and second days, 15 and 16 Tishrei, are celebrated as a Yom Tov. * Shemini Atzeret - in the Land of Israel, Shemini Atzeret is celebrated on 22 Tishrei. In the Jewish diaspora, it is celebrated on 22 and 23 Tishrei. Due to the sfeka d'yoma regarding the Yom Tov of Sukkot, there is an additional doubt as to whether the first day of Shemini Atzeret is in fact the last day of Sukkot. The Shulchan Aruch rules that outside the Land of Israel, Jews must eat in the sukkah on Shemini Atzeret without reciting the traditional blessing over this mitzvah.Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim 668. Holidays that do not reflect sfeka d'yoma * Yom Kippur is celebrated on 10 Tishrei (one day only) both in the Land of Israel and outside it. Yom Kippur is the only Torah festival where sfeka d'yoma was not instituted; a two-day Yom Kippur outside Israel would require a difficult and unhealthy two-day fast from both eating and drinking. Sfeka d'yoma was not instituted for holidays that are not mentioned in the Torah but were established later under rabbinic law. These include: * Purim--although mentioned in the later Biblical book of Esther, Purim is a Rabbinic holiday. It is celebrated on 14 Adar almost everywhere. It is celebrated on 15 Adar in Jerusalem, and partially in other cities in Israel, but for reasons unrelated to sfeka d'yoma. * Hanukkah is celebrated for eight days, starting 25 Kislev, both in the Land of Israel and outside it. * Tisha B'Av and other Rabbinic fasts are observed only one day each.

He was the son of Rev. John Henry George Lefroy, the rector of Compton and Ashe, who died when his son was five, leaving his widow and nine other children. He had studied at Guildford Grammar School in Surrey, where he became acquainted with the Stirling family and first developed an interest in the Swan River Colony in Western Australia. He later studied at Oxford University and had many conversations with the son of Captain Yates, who furthered his interest in the colony. Lefroy arrived in the colony in 1841 and took up land in York. He left York in 1843 with Henry Landor on an expedition, accompanied by 10 year old aboriginal boy, Cowits or Kowitch to translate. They crossed the Hotham River and went on to discover and name Kowitch Pool and the Lefroy River, and then returned after a fortnight. He returned to England to serve in the Royal Navy and returned to Western Australia as the Superintendent of Convicts in 1854. In 1860 he followed the Williams River eastward and explored the Darling Scarp. Lefroy and Landor completed another expedition to the Goldfields in 1863, where the party passed through areas such as Bruce Rock, Dumbleyung and Coolgardie. They trekked for a total of 85 days, including four days with no water, before returning to York. Lake Lefroy was named by the explorer Charles Cooke Hunt in 1864 after Lefroy, who would have seen the lake during his visit. Lefroy retired from his position as Superintendent of Convicts in 1875, and died in Fremantle on 18 July 1879 of pneumonia. He was buried at Karrakatta Cemetery.

Buchan provided fine-grain advice on the design of the retail precinct. HASSELL designed the third tower, with Woods Bagot designing the final tower. Sissons Architects also provided architectural services to Walker Corporation. Each of the Towers feature artwork by prominent artists; John Olsen was commissioned to paint his 48 square metre 'King Sun' for Tower 1. A large painting by Yannima Tommy Watson features in the lobby of Tower 5. The first tower was constructed by Built, with Multiplex completing the balance of the project in early 2018. Hutchinson constructed the Lantern Building and refurbished the Goods Shed. The commercial towers are supported by Cogeneration systems, rainwater harvesting, solar arrays, and regenerative lifts leading to 6 Star NABERS energy ratings. Collins Square has a number of multi-national companies as tenants; KPMG, AECOM, Mercer, Transurban, Marsh & McLennan Companies, IWG plc, Pearson Publishing, Pepperstone, BDO Global, Tabcorp Holdings, Mott MacDonald the Commonwealth Bank, and the Australian Taxation Office. The 27,000 sqm (290,625 sqf) leasing deal with KPMG was touted as the largest leasing transaction in Australia during 2013.

The act aimed to \\"come down harshly on outlaw motorcycle gangs and their members\\" and was one of three passed in the same session on 16 October 2013, going into effect immediately. The associated acts enacted on the same date were the Criminal Law (Criminal Organisations Disruption) Amendment Act 2013 and the Tattoo Parlours Act 2013. The Act was repealed in 2016, with the passing of the Serious and Organised Crime Legislation Amendment Act 2016. Repeal of Acts. Stipulations The Act applies to legal organisations and \\"any other group of 3 or more persons by whatever name called, whether associated formally or informally and whether the group is legal or illegal.\\" Similarly it defines office bearer of the organisation to allow for informal roles, with the defendant required to prove that they are not an office bearer. The Act declares a person to be a \\"vicious lawless associate\\" if they commit a serious offence \\"for the purposes of, or in the course of participating in the affairs of, the relevant association\\". It is incumbent on the defendant to prove that the association is \\"an association whose members do not have as their purpose\\" the serious offences listed in the Act. If a person is declared to be a \\"vicious lawless associate\\", this Act mandates a further 15 years imprisonment on top of the sentence for the crime for members of the organisation, and 10 years imprisonment in addition to this for office bearers of the organisation. Specific declared offenses of the Act include parts from the following Acts that are deemed to be 'serious offences' for the purpose of the Act: * the Corrective Services Act 2006 (1 offense); * the Criminal Code (Queensland) (59 offenses); * the Criminal Proceeds Confiscation Act 2002 (1 offense); * the Drugs Misuse Act 1986 (5 offenses); and * the Weapons Act 1990 (5 offenses). Criticism At the time of its introduction the bill attracted a large amount of criticism from law professionals to Amnesty International. In particular, the bill was criticised by Amnesty International for sweeping so broadly that innocent conduct may be caught and infringing the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. A later official taskforce was established in June 2015 to conduct a review of the suite of legislation introduced in 2013 to combat organised crime, in particular outlaw motorcycle gangs (OMCGs). Among many other criticisms, it noted that: :\\"The QPS reports that, overall, 202 individual persons have been charged with criminal offences as a vicious lawless associate. Of those 202 persons, 36 were identified as either members (21) or associates (15) of an OMCG. That figure of 36 people, importantly, includes ex-members who disassociated from their OMCG throughout that period, and ex associates. The remaining 166 individuals are not known to be members or associates of an OMCG. Hence OMCG members make up no more than 17.8% of all offenders charged under the VLAD Act...\\" See also * Criminal Law (Criminal Organisations Disruption) Amendment Act 2013 * Tattoo Parlours Act 2013 Further reading * *  References  External links  * (Qld) * Explanatory webpage of legal website Category:Queensland legislation Category:2013 in Australian law Category:Organised crime in Australia Category:2010s in Queensland Category:Acts related to organized crime ","title":"Vicious Lawless Association Disestablishment Act 2013"},{"id":"40947131","text":"Amorbia potosiana is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.

It compromises Mary Munford, Roberta Gwathmey, Yen (formerly Lewis), and Hoxton dorms (also sometimes referred to as 'houses'), all of which existed before the IRC was established. The IRC houses 317 students of all years at UVa, with international students making up 30% of the students living at the IRC, representing 29 countries. History Applications to the IRC were first available in January 2001, and the IRC opened its doors in the Fall of 2001. The Founder and First Principal of the IRC was Prof. Brad Brown. The crest represents the four houses and their corresponding words of the Latin Motto, the Wheat for food, the Bear for friendship, the Owl for wisdom, and the Laurels for peace. Membership International Residential College residents can be of any year at the university (as opposed to many other residence halls, where restrictions are placed based on the year of the student). All students, whether they are returning upperclassmen, incoming First Years, transfer students, or exchange students, must apply to be able to live in the IRC. Dorms/Houses=Munford and Gwathmey Houses Mary Munford and Roberta Gwathmey are two interconnected buildings located on Emmet Street, near the Memorial Gym. Both offer air conditioning for their residents. *Munford House – Except for six men who live in a small corridor on the first floor, all the residents of Munford House are women, including all of the first-year women. About 100 people live in Munford. Each floor is equipped with study rooms, a large kitchen (with an oven, microwave, refrigerator and sink), and two bathrooms (one for each half of the hall). There are three floors and no elevators. The first floor is a communal space for all students of the IRC, and the location of many events the IRC sponsors. *Gwathmey House – Gwathmey is the largest residence (because so much of Munford is used as communal space), holding about 120 students. Men, including the first-years, live on the first and third floors, and the second floor is for women. Each floor is equipped with a large kitchen (with an oven, microwave, refrigerator and sink) and a large bathroom. The first floor lounge contains a large TV, DVD, Play Station and two sofas. Yen and Hoxton Houses Yen and Hoxton are located next to Alumni Hall on Sprigg Lane. Both houses are designed in the suite style, where most suites are inhabited by like-gendered students in single and double rooms. Hoxton has one co-ed suite. Both houses also have several single and double (Hoxton only) rooms available in the hallways between the suites. Shared and private bathrooms, as well as full kitchens on each floor, are also available in both houses. *Yen House – Yen holds about 60 upper-class students and is air conditioned. Yen House was formerly named Lewis House; in 2017 the name was changed to Yen House to honor the first Chinese student to earn a degree from UVA. *Hoxton House – Hoxton holds approximately 40 upper-class students and is air conditioned. Morea House Morea House is located behind Hoxton house. It includes Morea Arboretum at the west end of its grounds. The house is divided into two sections, Big Morea and Little Morea. *Big Morea is where the principal of the IRC and their family resides. *Little Morea is where the director of studies and their family resides.

In 1939 she was converted into an Armed Merchant Cruiser, then a Landing Ship Headquarters (LSH) in 1942. She directed the landings in North Africa, Sicily, Anzio and Normandy during World War II. Pre-WW II service MV Bulolo was built for the Burns Philp line to be a passenger, cargo and mail steamer. She began her career on 19 November 1938 between Australia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, New Hebrides, Norfolk and Lord Howe Islands. She had completed eight voyages when war broke out in September 1939. World War II history On 22 September 1939 the Bulolo was requisitioned by the British Ministry of War Transport on behalf of the Royal Navy from Burns, Philp & Company Limited, (based in Sydney, New South Wales). She spent October 1939 to January 1940 under conversion to an armed merchant cruiser with seven 6-inch guns, two 3-inch anti-aircraft guns, depth charges and smaller armaments. On 24 January 1940 Bulolo sailed from Freetown acting as a convoy escort within the Freetown Convoy Escort Group. Over the next 27 months she was based almost exclusively in the Atlantic traveling between South America, South Africa and Britain carrying troops and supplies. Bulolo also searched for German surface raiders and in the capture of Vichy French ships. On 25 March 1942 the Bulolo was sold to the Admiralty and from 4 April 1942 to October 1942 she was converted to an amphibious Landing Ship Headquarters ship. During this refit she had a sophisticated communications systems installed for use in army, navy and air force control purposes. Her armament was sharply reduced as well. Bulolo then headed to North Africa as the flagship of Admiral Sir Harold M. Burrough, Commander of the Eastern Naval Task Force to take part in Operation Torch (the invasion of North Africa) and entered Algiers Harbour on 9 November 1942, the day after its surrender. A near miss from a German bomber attack the day before had damaged the engine room telegraph, unbeknownst to the crew. As the ship entered the port at 12 knots, the order for full steam astern went unheeded in the engine room and the ship ran aground, demolished a portion of the seawall and hit a waterfront building before settling back into the harbor. The French officials at the port to welcome the ship first scattered, then applauded the ship’s unconventional arrival. She then took part in Operation Husky (the invasion of Sicily) as the flagship of Rear Admiral Thomas Troubridge in charge of 'Force A' commanding the British XIII Corps (at the Gulf of Noto) between July and August 1943, and then as flagship commanding 'Task Force Peter' embarking the British 1st Division during Operation Shingle, the landings at Anzio in January 1944. The Bulolo then returned to Britain in April 1944 in readiness for Operation Overlord, the Allied landings being planned for Normandy in June 1944. On 28 April 1944, Commodore Douglas-Pennant, Naval Commander of Force \\"G\\", hoisted his flag on HMS Bulolo. Thereafter the Bulolo commenced training for D-Day. On 6 June 1944, Bulolo commanded the landing on Gold Beach, and though she was forced to relocate after receiving incoming fire from the German battery at Longues-sur- Mer, she remained off the beaches directing the assault. On 27 June she returned to Portsmouth. Following another refit, the Bulolo was sent in 1945 to be the Headquarters Ship and flagship of Rear Admiral Benjamin Martin for 'Force W' off Malaya commanding the Allies retaking of South East Asia from Japanese forces. In September 1945, Bulolo was used to accept the Japanese surrender at Singapore.  Post-World War II career  On 4 December 1946 she was decommissioned and returned to the Burns, Philp Shipping Company in 1948 to resume her merchant duties.

The relationship is characterized by exchanges between the neighboring countries of the Baltic Sea in the 14th century. Both countries are members of the European Union, United Nations, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Council of the Baltic Sea States and the Council of Europe.http://www.auswaertiges- amt.de/DE/Aussenpolitik/Laender/Laenderinfos/Schweden/Aussenpolitik_node.html Germany currently has an embassy in Stockholm.

Honorary consuls are in Bremen, Düsseldorf, Erfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Hamburg, Hannover, Kiel, Leipzig, Lübeck-Travemünde, München, Rostock and Stuttgart.  History  During the First World War (1914-1918) Sweden was neutral towards Germany. In the times of the Weimar Republic (1918-1933) Sweden was economically dependent on Germany. One of the important customer countries of Sweden in terms of iron ore was Germany. Moreover, a lot of German large companies acquired significant stock options of Swedish companies. In 1926 the trade and shipping treaty between the two countries was cancelled by Germany, because of disadvantages for German agrarian economy. In Sweden, the reorientation from German to Anglo- American culture had begun after the First World War. But still the upper classes of Sweden derived their culture and inspiration from the German universities, conservatories and art centers. In the interwar period the Swedish import of German literature had an important role.Hans Karl Gunther. German-Swedish relations. 1933-1939: The background for Swedish neutrality. Stanford 1954. p. 139. The domestic political development of Germany, especially the rapid increase of the influence of National Socialists in the German policy after 1930, was followed with big interest by Sweden. The Swedish press adopted a distanced and critical attitude towards the National Socialism which caused disgruntlements between the German-Swedish relations. While Germany was influenced by National Socialism, Sweden was a country with social democratic government. In autumn 1932 Hermann Göring (NSDAP) the president of the Reichstag, at that time, complained to Karl Albert Damgren, the press responsible of the Swedish delegation, in Berlin about the style of the reporting in the Swedish press in relation to National Socialism. The seizing power of Hitler and NSDAP at 30 January 1933 created still problems between Germany and Sweden. Frederic Hans von Rosenberg complained about a Swedish article in the “Social-Demokraten.” He said that the article contained wrong and exaggerated information. But Sweden was also attacked by German press. In the years that followed (1934-1937) the Swedish-German relations occurred a quiet phase. The German government circles expressed their interest in friendly contact with Sweden. Sweden declared in the Second World War again its neutrality. But Arvid Richert, the Swedish envoy in Berlin expressed his apprehension that Sweden could be involved in the war. He advised Sweden that they had to show resistance and attention in relation to statements about Germany to protect their country.Axel Huckstorf. Internationale Beziehungen 1933-1939: Schweden und das dritte Reich. Frankfurt am Main. 1997. P. 9-98. The post war period of Sweden was characterized by continuity. From Sweden’s point of view there was no need for analyzing of their behavior during the National Socialism. It did not need a construction of parliamentary democracy or a constitutional reform. But one of Sweden’s strategies after the war was the rejection of all things which was associated with National Socialism. Thus militaristically and nationalistically currents were opposed and Anglo- American values of modernity and rationality were benefited. http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2108&artikel;=2625391 Meeting of Carl Bildt and Frank-Walter Steinmeier, foreign ministers of Sweden and Germany, in 2014.  Political relations  Germany takes an important role in the Swedish foreign affairs because of its political and economic strength. The cooperation between the two countries becomes apparent in various sections. The bilateral relations are broadly problem-free. Early in year 2012 Reinfeldt was a guest of Chancellor Merkel. In May 2012 the German federal president Gauck visited Sweden at his trip. At autumn 2012 the federal ministers Schäuble and de Maizière went to Sweden, and in January 2017 Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Prime Minister Stefan Löven.http://www.auswaertiges- amt.de/DE/Aussenpolitik/Laender/Laenderinfos/Schweden/Bilateral_node.htmlhttp://www.government.se/press- releases/2017/01/prime-minister-to-receive-german-chancellor-angela-merkel/  Economic relations  On the one hand the main supplier country of Sweden is Germany. The amount of Sweden’s imports from Germany is about 17.3 percent, from Norway about 8.7 percent and from Denmark about 8.4 percent. On the other hand, one of the main customer countries of Sweden is Germany. Sweden exports most of their products to Norway. But Germany is with an amount of 9.8 percent in the lead of Sweden’s customer countries. In year 2012 Germany imported goods from Sweden in the amount of 13 billion Euros.http://www.schwedenstube.de/schwedens-export-partner-nummer-1-ist-jetzt- norwegen/ Among the products which Sweden exports to Germany are pharmaceutical products (18.2%), paper and paperboard (18.3%), metals (12.5%), machines (8.8%), automobiles and automobile particles (7.7%), mineral ores (6.3%) and chemical products (4.6%). 18.2 percent of the total German exports to Sweden are automobiles and automobile particles, 14.5 percent machines, 9.5 percent EDP-appliances, 8.5 percent chemical products, 7.7 percent electrical equipment and 6.5 percent metals.http://www.kooperation- international.de/buf/schweden/allgemeine-landesinformationen.html The stock of the foreign direct investments of Sweden in Germany was around 15.243 Million Euros in year 2009, around 16.146 million Euros in year 2010 and around 16.183 Million Euros in year 2011. The stock of German foreign direct investments in Sweden was higher. The stock was around 16.336 million Euros in year 2009, around 20.096 million Euros in year 2010 and around 26.027 million Euros in year 2011. The number of the engagement of German companies in Sweden is about 870, with about 50.000 employees and estimated annual sales around 30 milliard euros. Regional focus areas are Stockholm, Göteborg and Malmö.http://www.auswaertiges- amt.de/DE/Aussenpolitik/Laender/Laenderinfos/Schweden/Bilateral_node.html  Social policy  Principally Germany has deep interest in socio-political achievements and developments in Sweden. The sections child care, family policy and also the commerce with handicapped person are at the top of interest. Bilateral relations could be registered in the sections labor market reform, professional training and nursing care insurance.http://www.auswaertiges- amt.de/DE/Aussenpolitik/Laender/Laenderinfos/Schweden/Bilateral_node.html Right-wing populism has emerged in both countries. http://www.kas.de/schwerin/de/publications/19556/  Cultural relations  Until the Second World War, Sweden along with the rest of the Nordic countries and the Low Countries was geared to the German linguistic and cultural area and was considered to fall under the \\"German sphere of influence\\". After the War a rapid reorientation followed to the Anglo-American area. The German language has been replaced by English as the second language, though it still retains its position as the most popular foreign language for school students - much ahead of Spanish, French, Finnish, Italian, Arabic, Turkish, Kurdish, Greek, and Russian. Besides Goethe-Institut and Deutsche Schule Stockholm, further partner schools are of concern for the support of the German language in Sweden. The German-language congregation abroad as well as German-Swedish associations make a positive contribution to the intervention of German culture in Sweden. German film productions are in Swedish cinema and Television quite successful, but historical topics are more in the foreground. German ensembles and artist are going regularly to Sweden because of theatrical performances. In the literariness, a high demand exists for German classics. There are from time to time articles in Swedish press about the living in Germany, especially in Berlin.http://www.auswaertiges- amt.de/DE/Aussenpolitik/Laender/Laenderinfos/Schweden/Bilateral_node.html  German institutions, associations and projects in Sweden  * Botschaft der Bundesrepublik Deutschland * Goethe-Institut * Deutsch-Schwedische Handelskammer * German Trade & Invest GmbH – gtai * Deutsche Zentrale für Tourismus e.V.

In 1977 the Country Music Association of Australia inducted him into the Australasian Country Music Hands of Fame, and then in 2009 into the Australian Roll of Renown. Biography Ralph Ernest Newton was born on 22 October 1932 and grew up in Perth with two brothers. At the age of 17 he was an apprentice welder when he started performing country and western music at week-ends. Newton was 19 when he had two motor bike accidents leaving him with \\"crockery teeth and one leg an inch shorter than the other\\". He finished his apprenticeship at the age of 21 and while working his trade he continued performing as a musician. In 1954 he toured Western Australia and followed with a solo northern Australian tour in the next year. By 1957 he was living in Sydney where he performed on the Reg Lindsay Show both on radio and at local venues. Also that year fellow country artists, Rick and Thel Carey, recorded \\"You Can Say That Again\\", which was co-written with Newton. He returned to Perth in 1959. In the mid-1960s he formed a group, The Mavericks, with Mick Kodra. Newton had continued his songwriting and, in 1971, after contact from Eric Scott of Hadley Records, he and his family relocated to Tamworth, so that he could start recording his own material at their studios. His debut release was a four track extended play, The Redback on the Toilet Seat, which appeared by June 1972 and was produced by Scott.

According to David Kent in his Australian Chart Book 1970–1992 the EP appeared in the Kent Music Report Singles Chart on 19 June 1972, peaked at No. 5 for two weeks and remained in the top 100 for 28 weeks. Note: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting from 1974 until Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) created their own charts in mid-1988. In 1992, Kent back calculated chart positions for 1970–1974. Fellow country music artist, Slim Dusty, recalled in his autobiography, Another Day, Another Town (1996), how he had often been mistaken as the song's author. In August 1972 Newton told Nan Musgrove of The Australian Women's Weekly of an occasion where a visiting friend used his outside toilet in Perth where the light globe had blown. The friend reported that he was lucky there were no redback spiders on the toilet seat. The phrase inspired Newton to write the track, \\"The Redback on the Toilet Seat\\", which he indicated was \\"easy to write, that most songs come fairly easy except when you have to write one on demand, then and there\\". Newton's follow up EP, How Did the Redback Die?, appeared in October and continued the theme to explain what happened to the spider. In 1973 Newton was awarded a Golden Guitar Trophy at the inaugural Country Music Awards of Australia for Top Selling Record. Newton received further recognition for his work from the Country Music Association of Australia: in 1977 he was inducted into the Australasian Country Music Hands of Fame, and then in 2009 into the Australian Roll of Renown. Personal life In December 1956 Slim Newton performed with the Gill Brothers Rodeo and Circus in Canberra, he was promoted as \\"West Australia's own Cowboy Singer\\". In September 1958 he married Fay Edwards née Gill in Campsie and they returned to Perth the next year. The couple had five children: Eric (1959–1981), Stephen, Lisa, Linda and Jodi. By the time Jodi was born the family had relocated to Tamworth. Eric had died in a car accident and, in 1983, Stephen established a studio, Enrec, in Tamworth in honour of his older brother. As of June 1984 Newton was working as a welder for Wetherall Engineering in Tamworth but was still touring periodically. In 1992 Stephen relocated Enrec Studios to Kurri Kurri and then on to Sydney. In November 2003 Newton was honoured by a celebration of his life in country music with his children and grandchildren performing his signature song. Newton attended with his partner, Mary Holdom, and the couple also provided some duets. Stephen has worked with John Williamson both at Enrec Studios (when located in Sydney) and as a concert guitarist. In 2009 Stephen relocated Enrec Studios to the former Hadley Records venue.

It was the first model which generalized the Simon model to be used for networks, especially for growing networks. Price's model belongs to the broader class of network growing models (together with the Barabási–Albert model) whose primary target is to explain the origination of networks with strongly skewed degree distributions. The model picked up the ideas of the Simon model reflecting the concept of rich get richer, also known as the Matthew effect. Price took the example of a network of citations between scientific papers and expressed its properties. His idea was that the way an old vertex (existing paper) gets new edges (new citations) should be proportional to the number of existing edges (existing citations) the vertex already has. This was referred to as cumulative advantage, now also known as preferential attachment. Price's work is also significant in providing the first known example of a scale-free network (although this term was introduced later). His ideas were used to describe many real-world networks such as the Web.  The model =Basics Consider a directed graph with n nodes. Let p_k denote the fraction of nodes with degree k so that \\\\sum_{k}{p_k}=1. Each new node has a given out-degree (namely those papers it cites) and it is fixed in the long run. This does not mean that the out-degrees can not vary across nodes, simply we assume that the mean out-degree m is fixed over time. It is clear, that \\\\sum_{k}{kp_k}=m, consequently m is not restricted to integers. The most trivial form of preferential attachment means that a new node connects to an existing node proportionally to its in-degrees. In other words, a new paper cites an existing paper in proportional to its in-degrees. The caveat of such idea is that no new paper is cited when it is joined to the network so it is going to have zero probability of being cited in the future (which necessarily is not how it happens). To overcome this, Price proposed that an attachment should be proportional to some k+k_0 with k_0 constant. In general k_0 can be arbitrary, yet Price proposes a k_0=1, in that way an initial citation is associated with the paper itself (so the proportionality factor is now k + 1 instead of k). The probability of a new edge connecting to any node with a degree k is : \\\\frac{(k+1)p_k}{\\\\sum_k (k+1)p_k}=\\\\frac{(k+1)p_k}{m+1} Evolution of the network The next question is the net change in the number of nodes with degree k when we add new nodes to the network. Naturally, this number is decreasing, as some k-degree nodes have new edges, hence becoming (k + 1)-degree nodes; but on the other hand this number is also increasing, as some (k − 1)-degree nodes might get new edges, becoming k degree nodes. To express this net change formally, let us denote the fraction of k-degree nodes at a network of n vertices with p_{k,n}: : (n+1)p_{k,n+1}-np_{k,n}=[kp_{k-1,n}-(k+1)p_{k,n}]\\\\frac{m}{m+1}\\\\text{ for }k\\\\geq 1, and : (n+1)p_{0,n+1}-np_{0,n}=1-p_{0,n}\\\\frac{m}{m+1}\\\\text{ for }k=0. To obtain a stationary solution for p_{k,n+1}=p_{k,n}=p_k, first let us express p_{k} using the well-known master equation method, as : p_k=\\\\begin{cases}[kp_{k-1}-(k+1)p_k]\\\\frac{m}{m+1} & \\\\text{for } k\\\\geq 1 \\\\1-p_0\\\\frac{m}{m+1} & \\\\text{for } k=0\\\\end{cases} After some manipulation, the expression above yields to : p_0=\\\\frac{m+1}{2m+1} and : p_k=\\\\frac{k!}{(k+2+1/m)\\\\cdots(3+1/m)}p_0=(1+1/m)\\\\mathbf{B}(k+1,2+1/m), with \\\\mathbf{B}(a,b) being the Beta-function. As a consequence, p_k\\\\sim k^{-(2+1/m)}. This is identical to saying that p_k follows a power-law distribution with exponent \\\\alpha=2+1/m. Typically, this places the exponent between 2 and 3, which is the case for many real world networks. Price tested his model by comparing to the citation network data and concluded that the resulting m is feasible to produce a sufficiently good power-law distribution. Generalization It is straightforward how to generalize the above results to the case when k_0 eq 1. Basic calculations show that : p_k=\\\\frac{m+k_0}{m(k_0+1)+k_0}\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{B}(k+k_0,2+k_0/m)}{\\\\mathbf{B}(k_0,2+k_0/m)}, which once more yields to a power law distribution of p_k with the same exponent \\\\alpha=2+k_0/m for large k and fixed k_0. Properties The key difference from the more recent Barabási–Albert model is that the Price model produces a graph with directed edges while the Barabási–Albert model is the same model but with undirected edges. The direction is central to the citation network application which motivated Price. This means that the Price model produces a directed acyclic graph and these networks have distinctive properties. For example, in a directed acyclic graph both longest paths and shortest paths are well defined. In the Price model the length of the longest path from the n-th node added to the network to the first node in the network, scales as \\\\ln(n) Notes For further discussion, see, and.Krapivsky, P. L. and Redner, S., Rate equation approach for growing networks, in R. Pastor- Satorras and J. Rubi (eds.), Proceedings of the XVIII Sitges Conference on Statistical Mechanics, Lecture Notes in Physics, Springer, Berlin (2003). Price was able to derive these results but this was how far he could get with it, without the provision of computational resources. Fortunately, much work dedicated to preferential attachment and network growth has been enabled by recent technological progress.

It is also inspired by the 1989 film Turner & Hooch. The film was produced by Sibiraj's father Sathyaraj under the banner Nathambal Film Factory. The music was composed by Dharan Kumar, cinematography was handled by Nizar Shifi and edited by Praveen K. L. Naaigal Jaakirathai released on 21 November 2014, receiving positive reviews from critics, and was one of the most profitable ventures of 2014. The movie was dubbed in Hindi as Police Aur Tiger. Plot A gang has kidnapped a girl and several police officers, including Karthik (Sibiraj), who is attempting to rescue her. During a shootout, one man from the gang and a police officer named Arul Das (Raghav Umasrinivasan), who is a good friend of Karthik, are killed, while Karthik gets injured. He is put out of action and suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder. Subramani (Idoh) is a trained military dog who has the potential to nab culprits and decipher crime scenes. After its owner, an army officer, is shot dead, Subramani is returned to the officer's father in Coimbatore, who is a neighbor of Karthik. The neighbor leaves the town and requests Karthik to provide shelter to Subramani during his absence. Karthik denies the request but provides shelter after seeing Subramani being troubled by the small kids in the neighborhood. Karthik learns about Subramani and becomes good friends with him. Meanwhile, Karthik's wife Renuka (Arundhati) is abducted by Anbu Das (Balaji Venugopal), the head of the kidnapping ring, and is buried alive inside a coffin. A web camera is attached into the coffin, and the live stream is provided to Karthik. Karthik learns that Renuka can breathe for about six hours. Renuka speaks to Anbu, and with the help of a deaf and dumb teacher, Karthik deciphers what Renuka had conveyed. Suddenly, water trickles into the coffin, and Karthik concludes that it has to be rainwater. He, Subramani, and his cop friend travel to Ooty, the only place in Tamil Nadu where it was raining at the moment. Anbu had kidnapped Renuka to avenge the death of his brother, who was not the man from his gang, but Arul, who worked as a mole in the police department. Karthik is then hit by a metal rod and is also buried in a coffin. Subramani sniffs out Anbu and his henchmen. While Anbu can escape to a tree house, his henchmen get bitten by Subramani, who saves Karthik by digging a pit. Anbu gets hold of a gun and shoots at Subramani, injuring him fatally, before Karthik manages to outwit and defeat Anbu in a fight. Before dying, Subramani had marked the place where Renuka is buried, and Karthik saved her, while Anbu has been buried alive in the same manner. Subramani has gotten offspring, and Karthik is given one of the puppies. The movie ends with a scene where Karthik and his new dog, who has been named Chinnamani in Subramani's memory, are being entrusted to investigate a new case.

Shankar  Production  After Naanayam, Sibi Sathyaraj was on the lookout for a script for his next film. Since nothing interesting turned up, he took a brief hiatus, still reading scripts. Sibiraj is a dog-lover and has 3 dogs. So, he expressed his eagerness in working with animals in a film. Director Shakti S. Rajan, who had earlier directed Sibiraj in Naanayam, came up with a script with a dog in the lead. The film is about a military-trained dog and a man, and their journey. Finally, the film was announced in July 2013. The film was titled Naaigal Jaakirathai meaning 'Beware of Dogs'. Sibiraj plays the second hero and will be sharing screen space with a military trained canine. Apart from playing the hero, the dog would also do several action sequences and comedy tracks in the film. Arundhati of Sundaattam fame was signed as the female lead. The crew was on the lookout for a trained dog, preferably a German Shepherd. After a search, they found a dog from Bangalore. Filming began on 9 October 2013. The story takes place in Coimbatore, and travels to Ooty, Palakkad and Chennai.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack album was composed by Dharan Kumar while the lyrics were written by Yugabharathi and Madhan Karky. A single track \\"Doggy Style\\" was released on 27 August 2014. The album was launched at the Radio Mirchi FM Station, Chennai on 1 September 2014, where the cast and crew were present at the event. Behindwoods gave 2.75 out of 5 stars to the album stating it as \\"a waggy and naughty album from Dharan.\\" Milliblog stated \\"Dharan hasn’t been in the best of forms recently and Naaigal Jaakirathai’s soundtrack is no exception.\\" Behindframes gave 3 out of 5 and stated \\"Cool, peppy and enjoyable tracks by Dharan.\\" Release  The satellite rights of the film were sold to Sun TV.  Reception =Critical reception The film received generally positive reviews. The Times of India gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"Naaigal Jaakirathai's success lies in how cannily Soundar Rajan gives us a thriller that also feels light. But there is a bit of spoon-feeding in the form of exposition that is necessary but sticks out on screen because of how it is presented\\". Rediff gave 2.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"Whatever its faults, director Shakti Soundar Rajan's Naaigal Jaakirathai is a decent fun-filled entertainer\\". The New Indian Express wrote, \\"The uncomplicated tale of a man and his dog may have its glitches. But it’s refreshing in its premise and has many charming moments\\". Filmibeat rated 3 out of 5 and stated \\"Naaigal Jaakirathai is an amazingly new attempt as you don't get to see a dog in the lead very often in Indian cinemas. Kudos to Sibiraj who has played a second protagonist while the dog gets the central character as the story demands for it. Watch the movie for Idoh, the Belgian Shepherd and its splendid performance and of course for Sibiraj who has done justice to his character by portraying a neat and a sturdy looking cop\\". The Hindu wrote, \\"You wouldn’t perhaps begrudge the makers their ‘influences’ if the result was a film we generally don't see a lot of, but Naaigal reneges on the promise of its first portions\\". Sify stated \\"Naaigal Jaakirathai is a film where the idea sounds good but falls short in execution. Shakti Soundar Rajan’s idea of making an investigation thriller along with the fun elements of a dog is laudable but what lacks in the film is detailing of characters\\". Behindwoods rated 2.75 out of 5 and stated \\"Giving so much importance to a dog over the hero, logical screenplay, duration of the film and a engaging climax are the positives of Naaigal Jaakirathai. This is arguably the only authentic dog based film after the well known Rama Narayan directed stories that had animals playing vital roles\\". Box office On 8 December 2014, Sreedhar Pillai from Sify reported that the film, made on a budget of 4 crores, had grossed 7.25 crores till then. Furthermore, the satellite rights were sold for 2.5 crores, making it a profitable venture for its producers. Sequel After the film became a commercial success, Shakti Soundar Rajan informed that he had plans to make a sequel to Naaigal Jaakirathai. It would feature Sibiraj and the dog as well as the lead characters from the first part and is scheduled to commence in 2020.

In Vedic tradition, Uttanka(), also spelled Utanka, is a rishi (sage) who resided in the Maru desert. The primary source of this account is found in the Hindu epic Mahabharata. In the earliest version, Uttanka is described as the disciple of the sage Veda. In the second version, his guru is Gautama. In both legends, he is a learned sage who goes through many hurdles in procuring the earrings demanded by his guru's wife as the fee for the teacher (gurudakshina). Takshakas steal earrings from uttanaka. Illustrated by Asi in a folio of Razmnama. Uttanka asks the king Saudasa who was cursed by Vasistha to become a cannibal for earrings without any fear. And in last successfully receives it from her wife Madayanti, who before giving him warns that those earrings are celestial, and do not by any means put it heedlessly, if he do it will be stolen by higher beings who are always looking for a chance to have them. During his return, from hunger he tries to pluck fruits from a tree and drops those earings and a Nagas (serpents) steal the earrings, and later the gods Indra and Agni help Uttanka to retrieve them from the realm of the serpents. Uttanka is said to have advised King Janamejaya to take revenge against Takshaka, the king of the Nagas, as the latter was responsible for his father Parikshit's death by snake bite. Uttanka is one of the few persons described to have seen the Vishvarupa (Universal form) of the god Krishna. Krishna blessed Uttanka with a boon that would quench his thirst whenever he remembered him. From then on, the rare clouds that bring showers in the desert have been called \\"Uttanka's clouds\\". Gurudakshina Uttanka's legend is narrated in the Hindu epic Mahabharata in two versions. The first is the original narrated in the Paushya Parva chapter of the first Book, Adi Parva. The other version is in the Utankopakhyana (named after Uttanka) in the Ashvamedhika Parva, the 14th Book of the epic. A work in Malayalam, also called Utankopakhyana, is another recounting of the story from the 14th book, but uses the name Utanka, not Uttanka. The Ashvamedhika Parva version is believed to be a later retelling of the original account in the Adi Parva. Adi Parva According to the Adi Parva, Uttanka was one of three chief disciples of the sage Veda, who in turn was a student of Dhaumya. Once, Veda left his ashram (hermitage), entrusting all of the administrative duties to Uttanka. Veda's wife was then in her menstrual period. The women of the ashram urged Uttanka to cohabit with her so that her fertility period would not be wasted, but Uttanka refused to oblige as he was duty bound to his guru and he considered the act immoral. When this episode was conveyed to Veda upon his return to the ashram, he was pleased with his disciple and blessed Uttanka. Takshaka (pictured) stole the earrings that Uttanka acquired to be given as gurudakshina. After Uttanka completed his education, he asked his guru Veda about gurudakshina (fee to the teacher). Veda suggested that he should ask his wife and give him the gift that she desired. The guru's wife harboured a grudge against Uttanka, as he had refused to fulfil her desire in her fertility period. She asked Uttanka to get the earrings of King Pushya’s queen in three days so that she could wear them during a religious fast on the fourth day. Uttanka set out to accomplish the task. On the way, he encountered a giant who was riding a huge bullock and sought his blessings. The giant asked Uttanka to eat the dung and drink the urine of the animal. Uttanka hesitated but ultimately complied after being informed that his guru, Veda, had acted likewise. Uttanka then went to King Pushya and conveyed to him the wish of his guru’s wife for the earrings of his queen so that he could pay his gurudakshina. The king asked Uttanka to meet his wife in her chambers. However, he could not find the queen there. Pushya informed Uttanka that his queen does not appear before any impure person who has not performed the ritual ablutions. After performing the ablutions, Uttanka met the queen and asked her for the earrings, which she granted. She warned Uttanka that Takshaka, the king of Nagas (serpents), was after the divine earrings and he should therefore take guard against him. After Uttanka had met the queen, he was invited to dine with the king. The food was cold and had a hair in it. Enraged, the sage cursed the king that he would lose his sight. In turn, the king cursed Uttanka that he would not have any children. However, they reconciled and withdrew their curses. As Uttanka was returning to Veda's ashram, he decided to take a bath in a water tank. He left his things on the bank of the river and went to take a bath. At that time, Takshaka came there in the disguise of a naked mendicant and stole the earrings. Uttanka tried to pursue the mendicant, but Takshaka had reverted to his original form of a serpent and slithered away into a hole in the ground, reaching Naga-loka, the abode of the Nagas. Uttanka then tried to dig through the hole. Indra, the king of the gods, saw Uttanka in the process of digging and sent his weapon Vajra (thunder-bolt) to help him carve a tunnel to the realm of the Nagas. When Uttanka entered the snake world, he started praising the virtues of the snake king Takshaka and his clan, but to no avail as Takshaka was not moved to give up the earrings. Uttanka then saw two beautiful women weaving with white and black threads on a wheel fixed on the wall. The wheel had twelve spokes and was being turned by six young people. A horse with a rider stood near the wheel. Uttanka praised the functioning of the weaving process, the rider and the horse, and equated the rider to Indra. Pleased with this praise, the rider asked Uttanka to state in what way he could help him. Uttanka requested that he be given the power to bring the snakes under his control. The rider then instructed Uttanka to blow at the back of the horse. Uttanka did as suggested. Then flames emerged from all parts of the horse's body and filled the realm of the serpents with fire and smoke. The terrified Takshaka came out of hiding and gave up the earrings to Uttanka. Uttanka then wondered whether he could reach his guru Veda's ashram to hand over the earrings to the guru's wife before the prescribed time. The rider, noting Uttanka's concern, gave Uttanka his horse, which took Uttanka to the ashram. He reached the ashram just before sunset as the guru's wife was in the process of casting a curse on Uttanka for not arriving in time. When Uttanka narrated his experience in procuring the earrings, the guru and his wife blessed him. Veda then explained to Uttanka the significance of the sights he had seen in Nagaloka. The two women engaged in weaving were Dhata and Vidhata; they were creating the world and all its creatures. The threads were day and night. The wheel with twelve spokes was the year with 360 days. The six boys were the seasons. The giant and bullock were Indra and his elephant Airavata. Its dung was amrita (elixir of life), which kept Uttanka alive in Nagaloka. The rider and horse in Nagaloka were Indra and the fire-god Agni. Veda also explained to Uttanka that his friend, Indra, had helped him during his journey. After handing over the earrings and taking leave of his guru, Uttanka went to Hastinapur, the kingdom of King Janamejaya. He resolved to teach a lesson to Takshaka who had caused him trouble. He informed Janamejaya that it was Takshaka who had killed his father Parikshit and advised Janamejaya to perform a snake sacrifice to exterminate the serpents. Uttanka was one of the rishis who participated in the Sarpa Satra yagna initiated by the king. Sarpa Satra was meant to draw all serpents to the sacrificial fire to certain death by the chanting of mantras. After the serpents started falling into the sacrificial fire, Takshaka was not to be found anywhere. Uttanka then recited the mantras with great vigour to draw Takshaka to the fire. In mortal fear, Taskshaka took shelter with Indra and got himself tied to the throne of Indra for protection. Uttanka, who realised that Takshaka had taken refuge with Indra, intensified his mantras to ensure that not only Takshaka but also Indra along with his throne were drawn to the fire. Indra freed the snake from the throne and escaped. However, when Takshaka was about to drop to death into the sacrificial fire, Astika, a young boy well versed in scriptures, son of the sage Jaratkaru intervened with Janamejaya. Astika ensured that the Sarpa Satra was stopped and the life of Takshaka was saved. Ashvamedhika Parva The god Indra (pictured) is described as having helped Uttanka recover the stolen earrings. In the Ashvamedhika Parva the tale is narrated with some variation. Uttanka is described as a brahmin who belonged to the Bhrigu race that lived in a hermitage in the Maru desert. Uttanka was the disciple of the sage Gautama, whom he served for a hundred years. Uttanka was very dear to Gautama, who did not let him go even after Uttanka had completed his education. Uttanka grew old over time. One day Uttanka collapsed while carrying a huge bundle of firewood. Gautama's daughter cried looking at the sight. When called by his guru, Uttanka accosted Gautama, and with tears in his eyes asked him why he alone had been retained in the hermitage when thousands of other disciples had been discharged after training. Gautama restored Uttanka's youth, gave his daughter in marriage to Uttanka and then permitted him to leave. Uttanka wanted to give the sage his gurudakshina. The guru told him to meet his wife Ahalya and inquire as to her wish. Ahalya suggested that he bring her the divine earrings of Madayanti, King Mitrasaha Saudasa's wife, as gurudakshina. The king had turned into a cannibalistic rakshasa by a curse and was known as Kalmashapada. Uttanka met Kalmashapada, who approached Uttanka to eat him, but Uttanka stopped him and explained that he was duty-bound to get Madayanti's earrings as gurudakshina and that he, Uttanka, would return to Kalmashapada after fulfilling his obligation. Kalmashapada agreed and directed him to his wife, who refused to part with her earrings until Uttanka brought some token from Kalmashapada as proof of his consent. Upon returning from Kalmashapada with a token, Madayanti gave him the earrings. The queen warned Uttanka that her earrings were coveted by Nagas, Yakshas, rakshasas and the gods, who would try to steal them. Uttanka was therefore advised not to allow the earrings to touch the ground to prevent the snakes from taking possession of them. On the way back to the ashram, Uttanka had tied the earrings in a deerskin. While travelling, he stopped and climbed a tree to pluck some fruit for his refreshment. He tied the deerskin to a branch, but the deerskin became untied and the earrings fell on the ground. A snake immediately got hold of the earrings and vanished into an ant-hill. In grief, Uttanka fell from the tree. For 35 days, he dug the ant-hill with a stick to get the snake out and retrieve the earrings. The earth began to shake due to the repeated strikes. At that time, Indra – riding his chariot – saw Uttanka's futile efforts. As in the Adi Parva, Indra used his Vajra to enable Uttanka to enter the beautiful Nagaloka. There, Uttanka saw a horse with the \\"tail which had black and white hair, a copper-coloured muzzle, and eye of the same colour that seemed to flame forth in splendor\\". The horse told Uttanka to blow from behind, as in the Adi Parva version. The horse was the fire god Agni who was the guru of Gautama, who had offered his help to retrieve the earrings. When Uttanka followed the directive of the horse, flames and smoke emerged from every pore of the horse and choked the dwellings of the snakes. Thus choked, the serpents, headed by Vasuki came out, worshipped Uttanka and surrendered the earrings and asked that they be pardoned. When Uttanka returned to the hermitage of Gautama to give the earrings to Ahalya, he narrated the sequence of events that occurred in procuring the earrings. Meeting Krishna Uttanka prays to Krishna for showing his Vishvarupa. Vishvarupa of Krishna as seen by Arjuna. Krishna is also described as having shown this form to Uttanka. The Ashvamedhika Parva narrates Uttanka's meeting with the god Krishna. As Krishna was returning to his kingdom Dwarka, he noticed the wandering ascetic Uttanka. Uttanka met Krishna and asked for news. Krishna told about the devastation in the Kurukshetra War. Uttanka was agitated and was about to curse Krishna for not bringing about a compromise between the warring cousins Pandavas and Kauravas. Krishna explained the necessity of war for restoration of dharma and revealed his Vishvarupa form to Uttanka. The sage bowed to Krishna. Krishna told Uttanka to ask for a boon. Uttanka asked Krishna to grant him the boon of finding water whenever he was thirsty. Krishna granted the boon to Uttanka. Uttanka was the only other person other than Arjuna and Bhishma to get a divine vision of Krishna. Wandering in the desert, the sage became thirsty and, hoping to get water, thought of Krishna, but instead, he found a naked Chandala (an outcaste untouchable) urinating and asking him to drink the urine. The Chandala was covered in mud and surrounded by filthy dogs. The Chandala repeatedly requested Uttanka to drink his urine. But when Uttanka refused, the Chandala disappeared. Then when Krishna appeared on the scene Uttanka complained that it was improper of him to send a Chandala to quench the thirst of a Brahmin. Krishna explained that he had requested Indra to give him amrita, but Indra was not willing to give it to mortals. Indra disguise as chandala meet Sage uttanka, folio of Razmnama Finally, Indra had relented and had told Krishna that he would offer Uttanka the amrita as a Chandala, provided the sage did not refuse it. Krishna had agreed to Indra's condition. Krishna then informed Uttanka that his refusal to accept amrita from the Chandala was improper. However, Krishna promised to keep his boon of providing water to the sage. He then blessed Uttanka that rain clouds would appear at his bidding and bring rain showers in the desert. These clouds appear rarely, and in the desert rain clouds are still known as Uttanka’s clouds (Uttanka Megha). In another version of this event, it is said that, to test Uttanka, Krishna once appeared before him disguised as an untouchable hunter and offered him water which was polluted with urine. Uttanka rejected the offer as it was being offered by the hunter, an untouchable. This displeased Krishna who then appeared before Uttanka in his true form. Other legends The Vana Parva book of the Mahabharata narrates that an asura (demon) named Dhundhu lived under the sands of the desert of Ujjalaka, in Marudhanva. Dhundu terrorized the whole world. Upset by Dhundu's action, Uttanka – whose ashram was in Ujjalaka – performed tapas (austerities) dedicated to Vishnu. Pleased, Vishnu told Uttanka that the Ikshvaku king Kulavalashva, possessing part of his power, would slay the demon. The sage went to the king Vrihadaswa, who was retiring into woods, recounted him Vishnu's prophecy. King then commended his son Kuvalasva to obey the behest of Utanka, himself retired into forest. King Kuvalasva, with more than twenty-one thousands troop accompanied by his son and Brahmana Uttanka, set out for that region. While travelling, Vishnu filled him with part of his own energy. The demon Dhundhu had a boon from Grandsire, of not being killed by anyone possessing divinity. He was living in western region, beneath sea of sands. King with his man excavated it, and found huge body Asura lying beneath it. Surrounded by all, the Danava was assaulted with sharp weapons. And enraged, the Asura baffled all of their weapons, and started to vomit fiery flames, achieving wonderful feat of consuming all of his troops in a moment. The King, possessed of mighty energy, then approached him, extinguished his flames with force, discharging stream of water, and consumed him in a moment by using Brahma weapon. Out of all sons being slaughtered, three of his son survived. He was then granted several boons by gods and Rishis, who became gratified with that encounter. As a result, Kulavalashva became known as Dhundhumara, the slayer of Dhundhu. The Naradiya Purana narrates that Uttanka lived in an ashram in Ujjalaka. In his old age, he left for a pilgrimage and travelled to various temples. Once, the sage saw a hunter named Gulika stealing the golden plates of the temple of Vishnu at Sauvira. Gulika tried to kill the sage. Then Uttanka informed Gulika that the sin of murder would be to live through many births to expiate his sin. Hearing this the hunter was penitent and fell dead. Uttanka then sprinkled water from the holy Ganges on the hunter's corpse, which restored Gulika who then attained Vaikuntha, the abode of Vishnu. As advised by Vishnu, Uttanka went to Badari, performed tapas and attained Vaikuntha himself.

On 9 July 1997 the National President Greg Craig gave control of the Parramatta chapter to Sam Ibrahim, brother of well known Kings Cross nightclub owner John Ibrahim. Sam Ibrahim was not required to follow the normal path of first becoming a prospect, then a fully patched member, before taking over the role of chapter president. The Parramatta chapter was shut down in 2006 after several members were arrested. See the \\"Crime / In The Media\\" section below for further information.  Patch / motto / colors  The Nomads patch consists of a skull wearing a helmet. The helmet has wings and a swastika. Behind the helmet are a set of pistons.

He was patched into the chapter by National President Greg Craig, without the need to first prospect. In January 2011 he was shot in the legs in a drive-by shooting outside his mother's house. In September 2015, it was announced that the Australian Government would be deporting him. Allan Sarkis – President of Notorious Allan Sarkis was patched into the Parramatta chapter by Sam Ibrahim (then the Parramatta President). Sarkis left the club, along with other Parramatta members, to start the Notorious Gang / Motorcycle Club, which gained media attention as they promoted themselves as a motorcycle club although many members did not ride Harley Davidson motorcycles and they often wore clothing not associated with the traditional outlaw motorcycle club scene. They were deemed the \\"Nike Bikies\\" in some publications. Moto- #14-only the dead see the end of the war As part of the New South Wales Police operation named Strike Force Raptor, the organizational structure of Notorious MC was dismantled and the group classified as no longer being active as of March 2012.

Civil War In 1861 Augustus Seward transferred to the Paymaster Corps and was promoted to Major. Later that year he declined an appointment in the 19th Infantry. During the American Civil War he carried out paymaster and staff duties in New Mexico Territory, Arizona Territory and Washington, D.C. He received brevet promotions to Lieutenant Colonel in May, 1865 and Colonel in November, 1865 in recognition of his Civil War service.George Washington Cullum, Edward Singleton Holden, Biographical Register of the Officers and Graduates of the United States Military Academy, Volume II (3rd edition), 1891, p. 340. Assassination attempt Augustus Seward was staying at the home of his father in Washington, D.C. on April 14, 1865, when Lewis Powell attempted to assassinate William H. Seward at the same time John Wilkes Booth was carrying out the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln.Mark Jones, Peter Johnstone, History of Criminal Justice, 2011, p. 273.Thomas Goodrich, The Darkest Dawn: Lincoln, Booth, and the Great American Tragedy, 2006, pp. 92–93. His father was in bed recovering from injuries sustained in a carriage accident, and a jaw splint he was wearing as a result likely deflected Powell's knife and saved Seward's life.Don Voorhees, The Indispensable Book of Useless Information, Your Name is Mudd, 2011. Augustus, his brother Frederick and others in the house were attacked by Powell as Powell attempted to gain access to Seward's bedroom, as they intervened in Powell's attack on Seward, and again as Powell made his escape. Augustus suffered seven stab wounds and remained in Washington until 1868, where he testified at Powell's trial, and performed staff duties while recovering from his wounds.Charles Bracelen Flood. Grant and Sherman: The Friendship That Won the Civil War, 2006, pp. 327–328. Later career Augustus Seward continued to serve in the Army and perform paymaster and staff duties. His postings included: Boston, Massachusetts, from January to October 1868; New York City from 1868 to 1869; leave of absence from February to December 1869; Chief Paymaster of the Department of the Cumberland from December 1869 to May 1870; Chief Paymaster of the Department of the South and Paymaster of the department headquarters from May 1870 to October 1871; and Paymaster of the Department of Dakota from November 1871 to May 1876.Cullum, Holden, Biographical Register, 1891, p. 340. Death and burial In May 1876, Seward was diagnosed with an affliction described as paralysis of the eye. He took a leave of absence from the Army and died at the home of his brother Frederick in Montrose, New York on September 11, 1876.Lowell (Mass.) Daily Courier, Death notice, Augustus H.

The sole example of this single seat, wooden glider first flew in 1962. Design and development The Tobia was specifically designed by Rotondi as the basis of an extended aircraft building project for the students of the aeronautical division of the G. Feltrinelli Technical Institute of Milan. This turned out to be a four-year exercise, beginning in 1958. It was a shoulder wing, single seat, wood and fabric glider with a single spar, straight tapered, square tipped wing. From the spar forwards the wing was plywood covered, forming a torsion resisting D-box; aft, it was fabric covered. Its ailerons were long and narrow, covering half the span. The inner parts of the wing carried mid-chord air brakes similar to those used on the influential DFS Olympia Meise. The Tobia had an oval, almost circular cross section, fabric covered fuselage. Its long cockpit was centred on the wing leading edge and was covered by a single piece, teardrop shaped perspex canopy. The tail surfaces were straight tapered and square tipped with the tailplane and elevators mounted slightly above the fuselage on a dorsal fin fillet; the fin was tall and the rudder extended down to the keel and control surfaces were not aero-dynamically balanced. The Tobia had a retractable monowheel undercarriage, with a landing skid ahead of it to the nose. The sole Tobia's first flight was made in 1962. Later, wing fitting damage sustained in a heavy landing ended its career.

It is located south- west of Kirkliston, and west of the city centre. The house, designed by Robert Adam in the late 18th century, is a category A listed building. The 18th- century gardens, inspired by the French formal style, are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the listing of nationally significant gardens. Newliston is within the City of Edinburgh council area and the historic county of West Lothian. History Newliston was originally the property of the Dundas family of nearby Dundas Castle. Duncan Dundas, the Lord Lyon King of Arms, acquired the property in the 15th century. His descendant, Elizabeth Dundas, 8th of Newliston, married John Dalrymple, 1st Earl of Stair (1648–1707). Their son John Dalrymple, 2nd Earl of Stair (1679–1747), served as ambassador to the French court at Versailles from 1715 to 1720. Inspired by the formal style of the gardens of Versailles, Lord Stair set about planning a grand garden for Newliston. The architect William Adam drew up plans for a new mansion, as well as a layout for the gardens, in 1723–1725. William Adam's design for the house was never built, although the stables are probably his work. Much of the detail of the garden design, including canals, cascades and avenues, may have been the work of Lord Stair himself. Work on the gardens continued until 1744, employing up to 200 workmen. Lord Stair was an officer in the British Army, rising to the rank of Field Marshal at the Battle of Dettingen (1743) and opposing the Jacobites during the Rising of 1745. Lord Stair's loyalty has led to suggestions that the 'Union Jack' patterned layout of \\"Hercules Wood\\" within the grounds is a celebration of his part in the victory at Dettingen. In 1747, following Lord Stair's death, Newliston was sold to London merchant Roger Hog. His son, Thomas Hog of Newliston, commissioned Robert Adam, son of William Adam, to design the present house in 1789. The house then became the home of James Maitland Hog, Roger's grandson. The landscape designer William Sawrey Gilpin worked on improvements to the grounds in the 1830s, during which time the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway was built through the south-west corner of the Newliston parks. The East Lodge, on the B800 road, was built in 1848, probably to the designs of David Bryce. The house remains in the ownership of Roger Hog's descendants, and is open to the public during the summer. A ride-on miniature railway runs through the grounds.

He was military governor of Shrewsbury during the early years of the war and later served as the Royalist High Sheriff of the county and helped negotiate the surrender of Bridgnorth. His final years were spent in a prolonged and complex struggle to free his estates from sequestration. Background, early life and education Pitchford Hall, Shropshire, home of the Royalist Ottley family in the 17th century. Pictured in 1901 Pitchford Hall, photographed 2005. Francis Ottley's parents were: :*Thomas Ottley of Pitchford, Shropshire The Ottley family belonged to the middling landed gentry and claimed descent from the Ottleys of Oteley, near Ellesmere, Shropshire. However they made their fortune as part of the powerful merchant class of the town of Shrewsbury itself, the wealth of which derived from its monopoly in the finishing of Welsh cloth. As early as 1444 a Thomas Ottley was one of the aldermen assisting the bailiffs in the government of Shrewsbury.Coulton, p.17 He bought Pitchford Hall in 1473, and also had a house in Calais, from which he could seek outlets for finished cloth. His son William was High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1500, marking the definitive acceptance of the Ottleys into the landed gentry, the dominant class in Shropshire, a county which had no resident aristocracy in the 16th century.Coulton, p.40 :*Mary Gifford, daughter of Roger Gifford, MD Roger Gifford was a noted doctor, who was appointed Elizabeth I's physician ordinary in 1587. He became wealthy and served as MP for Old Sarum. He was reported to be a Catholic but this is uncertain. Francis Ottley was educated at Shrewsbury School from the age of ten. He entered Lincoln College, Oxford, matriculating at the age of 17 on 4 December 1618, the same day as his younger brother, Richard. While Richard stayed on to graduate, Francis left without a degree for legal training, and the Inner Temple registered his admission in November 1619, incorrectly naming his father as Robert. In 1621 he married Lucy, the already widowed daughter of Thomas Edwards, who was High Sheriff of Shropshire at the time. Royalist seizure of Shrewsbury Ottley was already active in local politics before the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, so quickly emerged as a leading Royalist within Shropshire, playing a key role in the military conquest of the county by the Charles I. As newspapers were not yet in circulation in the Midlands,Phillips (ed), 1894, Ottley Papers, p.33. he kept in touch with the national situation by having an agent in London, Robert Browne,Phillips (ed), 1894, Ottley Papers, p.32. send him occasional newsletters, summarising developments in the capital, but also in provincial centres as news came in. Letters from Browne still survive, relaying such news as the crisis in May 1641 over the execution of Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of StraffordPhillips (ed), 1894, Ottley Papers, p.30-31. and, a year later, the first hostilities between Charles I and Parliament at the Siege of Hull.Phillips (ed), 1894, Ottley Papers, p.31. Sir Vincent Corbet, Ottley's principal Royalist collaborator in Shropshire during the early days of the Civil War and later a cavalry commander. The town and corporation of Shrewsbury were deeply divided. A political and ideological conflict between Puritans and Laudians had resulted in a battle of the pulpits for more than two decades.Coulton, p.69-90 During the summer of 1642 parliament and the king instigated rival mobilisations, the former under the Militia Ordinance, the latter under Commissions of array. Ottley received a commission from the king, dated 22 June at York,Phillips (ed), 1894, Ottley Papers, p.34. to mobilise the county's Trainbands by sending a warrant to the High Sheriff. On the other side, a group of Shrewsbury aldermen petitioned parliament on 16 July to recognise a militia that had begun to gather under the command of Thomas Hunt.Coulton, p.91 Parliament authorised the training of militia for the defence of Shrewsbury and, under an act of 22 July, deputed three MPs, William Pierrepont, Sir John Corbet, and Richard More to establish its military control of Shropshire. The Drapers' Company responded with contributions of money, silver plate and equipment for the parliamentary cause. However, Ottley seized the initiative and disrupted the parliamentary muster on 1 August. Royalist forces drilled the following day under Sir Vincent Corbet of Moreton Corbet. A declaration of loyalty to the king was issued by the grand jury at Shrewsbury assizes on 8 August. Acknowledging that their Worcestershire neighbours had been first to pledge their support, the Shropshire gentry and burgesses declared: Ottley was one of those who signed, although his name was close to the bottom of the list of gentry,Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.243. while his brother-in-law Sir Thomas Wolryche, 1st Baronet was close to the top. Ottley sent out messengers to carry the resolution to gentry in outlying areas to keep them informed and supportive. However, the situation remained confused and undecided for several weeks, with many of the Shropshire gentry hoping that mediation would avert open conflict.Coulton, p.92 Sir Richard Newport appeared on the scene as a mediator between the two sides but he was secretly in close contact with Ottley and his friend Thomas Eyton of Eyton upon the Weald Moors through his son, Francis Newport.Phillips (ed), 1894, Ottley Papers, p.36. and had pledged £6000 to the king for a barony. Hopes of a peaceful resolution faded quickly after the king raised his standard at Nottingham on 22 August, effectively declaring war on Parliament.Sherwood, p.1 Ottley was in contact with a group of Anglican clergy who were plotting to come out firmly on the king's side.Phillips (ed), 1894, Ottley Papers, p.35. They met in Shrewsbury to issue their own declaration on 24 August,Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.244-5. although the recorded signatories include none of the ministers of Shrewsbury itself. Shrewsbury corporation declared a policy of neutrality and non-resistance on 30 August.Coulton, p.90 Ottley plotted to bring the king to Shrewsbury to take advantage of the situation, using Thomas Eyton as intermediary, although he also received information from other informants, like Sir Thomas Hanmer,Phillips (ed), 1894, Ottley Papers, p.41. the king's cupbearer. By 4 September Eyton had met the king at Nottingham and passed on to Ottley the king's summons to a meeting.Phillips (ed), 1894, Ottley Papers, p.38. In the meantime, on 10 September, the king wrote, authorising him to raise 200 infantry to take Shrewsbury.Phillips (ed), 1894, Ottley Papers, p.40. and, in an accompanying letter, Edward Hyde assured him of the king's personal, as well as official, concern and regard for him. On 13 September, the Royalist field army set off westward and reached Derby on the same day, where the king received an assurance from Ottley that the town was \\"at his devotion.\\"Sherwood, p.4 On 15 September Shrewsbury council agreed to give the king free access to the town and to “”Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.245. The king had reached Uttoxeter by the time Ottley was able to meet him. An address was drafted for the king to read out at Wellington, where he rallied his forces on 19 September. On 20 September the king and his army entered Shrewsbury to a welcome from its people, although they had little choice in the face of overwhelming force.Sherwood, p.5 Ottley was knighted by the king at Shrewsbury on 21 September 1642. The king was based at Shrewsbury until 12 October 1642, shadowed by the main Parliamentarian army, under the Lord General, Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, which had marched from Northampton to Worcester to block his progress southward.Sherwood, p.9 The Royalist soldiers billeted in the town were ill-paid and took to extortion and looting. Soon this spread to the surrounding countryside of north Shropshire.Sherwood, p.6 As early as 28 September Ottley was sent a complaint by John Weever of Market Drayton, alleging that he had only narrowly escaped having his home looted by Royalist soldiers and that many of his neighbours had not been so lucky, although they were “noe Rounheades but most duitefull subjects to his ma'tie.”Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.249. Weever and other complainants had already begun to address themselves to Ottley, although he was not yet formally head of the garrison at Shrewsbury. However, there was informal recognition of his leading role: a proclamation, apparently from the king, notified all gentlemen and soldiers that they should be ready to rally in case of disturbance signalled by “”. Quest for the governorship Edward Hyde, later Earl of Clarendon, a moderate voice and Ottley's main supporter in the Royalist camp. Sir Orlando Bridgeman, a Cheshire Royalist politician and future Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. He was in close contact with Ottley during the Civil War. Major General Sir William Brereton, most successful Parliamentarian commander in the Midlands, under whose protection the Shropshire committee gained a foothold at Wem. When the king left on 12 October, embarking on the campaign that would lead to the Battle of Edgehill, Ottley had still not been appointed military governor of the town. Instead, there was an ambiguous document, signed by the king on 11 October, ordering him not to leave his residence in the county and requiring the Sheriff, JPs and other officials to aid him by protecting his \\"person family and Estate and every part therof against all persons Whatsoever.\\"Phillips (ed), 1894, Ottley Papers, p.46. He was thus compelled to continue lobbying for official appointment to the post of governor. Meanwhile, however, he tried to take control of the situation. Moving south from Shrewsbury, on 14 October at Bridgnorth the king outlawed three of Shrewsbury's most prominent citizens as traitors: Thomas Hunt, Humfrey Mackworth, and Thomas Nicholls. These men immediately disappeared from the area, leaving the Royalists freer to consolidate their position. In December Ottley, together with Eyton, Corbet and other gentry, financed the formation of a force of dragoons, which was to be commanded by Corbet.Coulton, p.94Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.254-5. However, the initial response was poor, with only about 60 enlisted. In January 1643 Ottley renewed his campaign to be appointed governor.Phillips (ed), 1894, Ottley Papers, p.55. On 2 January he compelled all the inhabitants of Shrewsbury, on pain of death, to swear a declaration against the Parliamentary Army: This he hoped would win the king's favour and bring the coveted appointment. On 5 January Hyde wrote from Oxford, the Royalist capital, explaining the king's reluctance and promising speedy appointment if required. However, Ottley had other informants at Oxford and elsewhere. A letter despatched the following day by Thomas Bushell made clear that there others lobbying for the post at Shrewsbury. Apparently Ottley insisted on the appointment, as he was rewarded with formal appointment as governor later that month. A consignment of high quality carbines despatched to Oxford on 11 January must have helped, for Hyde soon wrote back asking for more and offering to raise the necessary money.Phillips (ed), 1894, Ottley Papers, p.59. A letter from Hyde, written 9 February, significantly alludes to Ottley's commission, possibly still en route, before bemoaning his apparent inability to provide the promised arms.Phillips (ed), 1894, Ottley Papers, p.69. Complaints, opposition and repression The economy of Shrewsbury was greatly disrupted by the war and the war industries, including the manufacture of muskets begun by Ottley and the royalist propaganda press installed by the king, took up little of the slack.Webb, volume 1, p.241. Unsurprisingly, there was still a large body of opinion uncommitted to either side and wanting only a return to peace and business as normal. Jonathan Langley, a native of Shrewsbury stranded in the Parliamentary stronghold of Birmingham, wrote to Ottley of his desire to return to his home and family, and pointing out that \\"my protestation already taken binds me both to King and to parliament.\\"Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.263. Trade was greatly impeded by the necessity to obtain a pass from Ottley for any journey outside the town.Sherwood, p.70 The depredations of Royalist soldiers impeded trade and inconvenienced citizens, creating a stream of complaints to the governor. On 7 January it was Peter Venables, an important Cheshire Royalist requesting release of his sister's goods seized by Ottley's soldiers.Phillips (ed), 1894, Ottley Papers, p.58. On 28 January John Birch, a Bristol wine merchant, wanted to know what had happened to four butts of sack, worth £64, and requesting restitution or recompense.Phillips (ed), 1894, Ottley Papers, p.66. Some of the complainants could be ignored. Birch's complaint was particularly audacious, as his arrest had been ordered by OttleyPhillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.257-8. and he had escaped only because he was a purveyor of wines to the royalist gentry of Bridgnorth, including Wolryche, the governor.Phillips (ed), 1894, Ottley Papers, p.63. He was soon in arms on the side of Parliament, and proved a redoubtable Roundhead commander in Gloucestershire and Herefordshire. It was not so easy to shrug off a letter from the king himself, alleging that Ottley's men had purloined goods belonging to an influential Staffordshire wool merchant and demanding they be released forthwith.Phillips (ed), 1894, Ottley Papers, p.68. Moreover, Hyde wrote complaining that Mr. Acherley, in whose house he had stayed the previous September, was being subjected to a campaign of intimidation. Harassed by conflicting demands, Ottley's position was slowly but steadily undermined by both the opposition and his own side. He frequently received news of events in Cheshire and in the north of Shropshire from Orlando Bridgeman, who seems to have been a close friend: however, the news was not always good, and there was usually a request for more men and materials to fight the war. At the end of January 1643, Ottley received a flurry of letters reflecting the first serious impact of a Parliamentary fightback, under Sir William Brereton. Most disturbing was a letter from Sir Vincent Corbet, beseeching him to send to Whitchurch not soldiers but as many surgeons as he could possibly provide.Phillips (ed), 1894, Ottley Papers, p.67. In February Parliament established a Shropshire committee to take control of the county.Coulton, p.96 and in April it was federated with its counterparts in Warwickshire and Staffordshire.Sherwood, p.64 The quickening pace of conflict brought in a flurry of complaints and entreaties. William Watkins, an enterprising small farmer of Shotton, protested bitterly that he was heavily taxed to pay for hostilities while his less industrious neighbours seemed to pay nothing.Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.264. Lettice Corbet, daughter-in-law of the Parliamentarian leader Sir John Corbet but a royalist, wrote to reclaim possessions she had left in Ottley's care, fearing that she would be cut off by the advance of Lord Brooke's Parliamentarian forces in Staffordshire.Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.265. The danger proved real and enemy forces reached Newport, prompting Ottley to an emergency mobilisation of Shrewsbury's dragoons and their retainers for a possible counter-move.Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.266. The lands of Parliamentarians that fell in the royalist-controlled areas were sequestered. The seizure of Humphrey Mackworth's lands created problems for Ottley, made all the sharper by the fact that they were, by contemporary reckoning, cousins. The seizure had been made without regard to anyone else's interests in the lands. In March Ottley was compelled to issue an order allowing the royalist William Browne to draw £70 a year from Mackworth's confiscated estates, as he had bought an interest in them through an indenture of mortgage.Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.298-9. Shortly afterwards he received a cutting but polite letter from Mackworth's mother, Dorothy Gorton, asking that he “not let me suffer for my esteemed fault.” She was the widow of Ottley's own uncle and claimed that she held a jointure in the sequestered lands.Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.302-3. Open discontent was building up in the town and its surroundings and Ottley took repressive measures. He issued an order for the detention of George Baxter, the widely respected puritan rector of Little Wenlock, who had fled the area. Baxter had apparently returned secretly to the area and was to be brought to Shrewsbury for interrogated on \\"all such matters as maybe objected against him on his ma'ties behalfe.\\"Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.262-3. At the Spring assizes of 1643, all ten indicted were charged with offences of disloyalty.Sherwood, p.23 The list began with William Webb, “,”Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.270. and the other accused were mostly men who had spoken out of turn, although the tailor Andrew Mills of Newport had induced a royalist soldier to desert to Brereton's forces.Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.271. Birch was on the list but he cannot have been in custody as he was in action with the Roundheads at Bristol on 7 March.Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.276. One Robert Corbett, accused of “speeking certain words tending to treason,” but bailed by Lord Newport, may have been Robert Corbet of Stanwardine, a cousin of Sir Vincent and a notable lawyer: by the time of the assizes he was with the Parliamentary committee for the county. On 17 March Ottley issued a proscription list, ordering the arrest of 43 people for disaffection towards the regime.Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.279. These seem to have been mainly minor tradesmen and farmers. Royalist reorganisation and retrenchment The royalists were now feeling much more threatened militarily and were not rising well to the challenge. 17 March brought requests for reinforcement from Sir Vincent CorbetPhillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.281-2. in the wake of a defeat at Middlewich. Two days later William Blunden, Ottley's cousin and commander of the small royalist cavalry force from Bishop's Castle, wrote to him in confusion, trying to find out what his orders were. He enclosed a letter for the sheriff, asking Ottley to open it if necessary, and in this he reported that his troops were completely out of gunpowder and ammunition.Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.286-7. The very next day brought news of the inconclusive Battle of Hopton Heath, in which the royalist commander, Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton, had been killed. Orlando Bridgeman wrote to get Ottley to redistribute shot, grenades and artillery, both to make the best of their insufficient supplies and to protect them from capture, and he revealed that they still needed to pay for much of what they had.Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.288-90. Ottley duly saw to the transfer of cannon between royalist forces and also used his powers as governor to appoint Richard Millward as an ensign to train an infantry company, commanded by Richard Ottley, his own brother.Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.290. Lord Capel, from April 1643 royalist commander in Worcestershire, Shropshire, Cheshire and North Wales. However, the royalist government had realised that local and informal initiatives were proving ineffectual and, by 1 April, had appointed Lord Capel as regional commander, with the title of lieutenant general. Capel wrote to Ottley to introduce himself and to arrange for the storage of gunpowder at Shrewsbury, sending his own troops to guard it.Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.300. At a council of war, held in Shrewsbury on 3 April, Ottley was made responsible for the safety of the magazine.Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.303. Capel began to harass Ottley for funds. First he asked him to ensure that those who had promised to maintain the Shrewsbury dragoons produce what they owed: some of the soldiers had failed to turn up for service.Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.311. He followed this by insisting on a systematic survey of the resources of the townspeople to see what could be extracted: he deputed the lawyer Arthur Trevor to oversee the process: he attached a postscript demanding a huge quantity of musket ammunition.Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.312. Within a week the king wrote demanding he procure supplies of flax and hemp to make matches for the muskets and artillery.Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.316. William Waller, Parliamentarian commander in the south-west The more vigorous military and organisational measures seem not to have steadied royalist nerves and Parliamentarian forces used propaganda skilfully to keep their opponents on edge. On 6 May, William Waller, commanding Parliament's forces in the south- west, issued a demand to the clergy of Shropshire that they take an oath to parliament, intimating that he proposed to drive right across the Midlands to join Brereton.Webb, volume 1, p.290. On 16 May Sir Richard Leveson wrote to ask Ottley's help in moving his household goods from Lilleshall Abbey into Shrewsbury for safe keeping, in view of the vulnerability to attack in the countryside.Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.318. On the same day Capel wrote, apparently to put Ottley on guard against possible disturbances or attacks under cover of the May Fair,Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.319. as his next letter congratulated the governor on his precautions. Four days later he ordered Ottley, with the help of Sir John Mennes and Sir Thomas Scriven, to carry out a thorough review and upgrade of the fortifications, security arrangements and supply situation. Shrewsbury was to be equipped to resist a siege of at least six months.<Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.321-23. He was given plenary powers over the inhabitants to implement his plans. It seems that Capel was at this time acquiring considerable regard for Ottley's efficiency and he kept him informed of wider developments: an account of his attempt to save Warrington from capture stressed success in minor skirmishes after the event rather than the loss of the town to the Parliamentarians.Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.325-6. However, there was soon news of royalist success in driving back the Parliamentarians in Worcestershire.Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.327. Capel continued to put the region on a war footing. On 13 June he demanded two horses from each gentry familyPhillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.332-3. Apparently a good deal of casual requisitioning was going on and Sir Paul Harris, an enthusiastic but unpopular royalist soon wrote to tell Ottley that soldiers from the Shrewsbury garrison had seized his weapons and threatened to break open his stored possessions.Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.333-4. Richard Herbert wrote from Bromfield on behalf of a neighbour whose apprentice had been conscripted, to the serious detriment of his business.Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.337. The economic and psychological impact of the war was variable: at about the same time Lettice Corbet was asking Ottley for safe-conduct passes and official protection so that her servants and mother could mount a business and shopping trip to London, the very centre of Parliamentarian power.Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.331. Pressure from the parliamentarians on the royalists of Shropshire was increasingly matched by that from within royalist ranks on Ottley himself. By late June, despite some royalist successes in Staffordshire, Capel was writing of his worries about the movements of Sir John Corbet,Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.338-9. who had been appointed head of the parliamentary committee and titular colonel-in-chief of any forces it raised. There were rumours he was close by, perhaps near Tamworth. In July there were rumours of plots among the townspeople of Shrewsbury. A letter arrived, perhaps from Oxford, purporting to be a warning from a friend but reporting that there were plots to replace Ottley as governor and suggesting that he was not issuing sufficient propaganda to counteract the widespread Parliamentarian pamphleteering.Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.344-5. Around the end of August the parliamentary committee, with the support of Brereton gained a foothold in its native county, occupying the small, unfortified market town of Wem. The Royalists were compelled to spend large sums of money rearming their forces in Shropshire. On 28 September the king authorised payment of £965 10s. to Francis Walker for manufacturing artillery and ammunition at Bouldon in Shropshire – most of it for delivery to Shrewsbury and Bridgnorth. In October the Parliamentarians at Wem, only 300 strong and now commanded by Colonel Thomas Mytton, saw off an assault, by 5000 of Capel's troops - partly because the townspeople, including many women, rallied to their aid.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.202-3. Soon after this failure, a widespread plot against Royalist control was uncovered in Shrewsbury. The mayor's accounts contain an entry for the building of gibbets, dated 29 December, probably indicating a considerable number of executions around that time. However, this was not enough for his Royalist critics. A letter sent on behalf of the king alluded to the need to be meticulous in publicising royal proclamations,Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.359-60. although it appears that Ottley had not shirked in this. Dismissal and after Prince Rupert, portrayed in Parliamentarian propaganda as the author of atrocities. He was the main Royalist critic of Ottley's policies. Prince Rupert who was appointed Captain-General of Forces in the region on 6 January 1644, had been briefed in unfavourable terms about the situation in Shropshire by Sir John Mennes, who had grievances about unpaid wages and expenses.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.211-12. Rupert wrote on 25 January 1644 to demand that Ottley initiate a reign of terror and announcing that he would soon arrive to make Shrewsbury his base for the Spring campaign.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.212-13. Ottley immediately replied that he had hanged a corporal for dereliction of duty and assured the prince that everything would be ready for his arrival. However, Mennes continued to brief against Ottley and his circle.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.214. Even before Rupert's arrival, the pace of fighting in the region rose rapidly, driven by an influx of battle-hardened royalist soldiers redeployed during a lull in the Irish Confederate Wars. Despite initial successes, Mytton continued to carry out damaging actions against the royalists, ambushing and looting a royalist ammunition train from Shrewsbury at Ellesmere, Shropshire and capturing its commanders, and later taking Eyton prisoner at Buildwas.Webb, volume 1, p.382. On 14 February the king issued writs under the Privy Seal of England for a loan of £100,000.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.219-21. Ottley's contribution was assessed at only £30, probably in recognition of his past sacrifices in the royalist cause. Rupert arrived at Shrewsbury on 18 February, armed with the powers of President of Wales, a post substituting for the Council in the Marches of Wales.Coulton, p.98 The major problem facing royalists in the region was lack of money. Rupert immediately abolished “free quarter”, the billeting of soldiers in civilian homes, and announced a transition to a combination of central provisioning and money wages.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.223. Next he made an agreement to settle back pay and future wages for the officers and officials, with Ottley himself to receive £20 a week.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.224-5. However, this was probably unrealistic, as the locality had been fairly thoroughly ransacked for resources and funds already. Moreover, horses continued to be billeted in private stables, as Francis Newport complained to Ottley in March.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.235. Meanwhile, Rupert led a brutal campaign to clear the area of Parliamentarian troops, massacring the garrison of Hopton Castle – a move which seems to have stiffened resistance.Sherwood, p.89 In March, he left to relieve Newark, with the military situation in Shropshire unchanged despite the disruption and bloodshed. During this month Ottley visited Oxford, probably to rally support at royalist headquarters, where he still had some credit with the king and his closest advisers. On his return, the mayor and aldermen welcomed him back with a gift of sack, cakes and sugar.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.236. Ottley continued in office for some time beyond this, although Rupert was clearly unimpressed by him and hoping for his dismissal or resignation. This may be why in May, when he was back in Shropshire, he pressed the Shrewsbury authorities to settle claims for back pay from Ottley and the other officers, as nothing had been paid since the agreement of 19 February and there was still pay outstanding from before that date: a total on 10 May of £1053 1s.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.240-1. It was probably in July that Rupert finally contrived his removal and put in charge Sir Fulke Hunckes, a veteran of the Irish wars, as Hunckes was generally written of as governor by early August.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.245. Ottley remained a Royalist soldier in Shrewsbury, despite his loss of the governorship. Later in the year, Rupert returned to campaign in Shropshire and replaced Hunckes with Sir Michael Erneley, a Wiltshire landowner who had no connection with the area and considered the locals hostile.Coulton, p.102 Ottley was made one of the Commissioners of Shropshire, attending Prince Rupert. At a meeting on 1 November they resolved to meet Ottley's arrears of pay by earmarking the proceeds of the Shropshire estates of John Egerton, 2nd Earl of Bridgewater, who had been declared a recusant.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.254. By 23 December, when he was sent a letter about unpaid loans by the king and the Oxford Parliament, he was also royalist High Sheriff of Shropshire,Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.259-61. although Parliament recognised Colonel Thomas Mytton, the governor of Wem, as sheriff. Prince Maurice Prince Maurice, was now put in charge of the Royalist forces in the region in place of his brother. Although less capable, he was no less demanding. Sir Robert Howard of Clun Castle wrote to Ottley suggesting that the county gentry subscribe £100 a month to entertain Maurice to win his favour.Webb, volume 2, p.128.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.266-7. Ottley was hoping that a fairer system of levies might be devised to meet the costs of the war, in line with the decisions of the Oxford Parliament.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.267-8. However, such concerns were soon sidelined by the urgent need to prepare for more fighting. Maurice soon wrote to the commissioners to complain about failure to meet the costs of fortifications at Bridgnorth.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.268-9. At Shrewsbury, Erneley was attempting to strengthen the fortifications of the town, expecting an imminent attack and was himself under pressure from Maurice to complete the work. On 25 January 1645 Erneley lambasted Ottley and the local gentry for their failure to make sufficient contributions to the war effort, claiming that they were responsible for fomenting mutiny: This seems to have been sufficiently cutting. On 1 February Ottley wrote to the commissioners of Munslow Hundred in southern Shropshire, not for more money, but calling on them to provide a force of 300 infantry for him to command. He also commissioned a cornet for a company of cavalry, clearly intending to lead a mixed force into battle.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.272-3. Capture and after On 4 February Maurice arrived in Shrewsbury and himself weakened its defences by taking away some of its garrison to reinforce his army campaigning in Wales and Cheshire.Coulton, p.103 This gave the county's Parliamentary committee an opportunity to move troops forward, enveloping the town in readiness for an assault. These were organised on 14 February and on 21 February they were pledged £2000 for the operation, with the proviso that looting in Shrewsbury would result in execution under martial law.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.275-6. Later that day they surprised a meeting of royalist commissioners of array at Apley Hall,Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.281-2. home of Sir Thomas Whitmore, 1st Baronet, and took them prisoner. These included Ottley himself and the son of Sir William Owen, a former MP and tenant of the Council House in Shrewsbury. The following evening, a small Parliamentarian force led by a Dutch professional soldier, William Reinking, entered the town by a door left open below the Council House. The town's main gates were taken and opened to admit the main force under Mytton and Shrewsbury fell, with little bloodshed, to the Parliamentarians. Lord Astley, commander of remaining royalist troops in Shropshire and Cheshire, 1645–6 Ottley was released within months. On 24 July Prince Maurice sent out a letter from Worcester to the remaining governors and garrisons of Shropshire making clear that Ottley had a special direction from the king to raise the posse of the county – a last resort to rally forces as royalist resistance crumbled across the country. They were ordered to provide accommodation for both Ottley and his retinue.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.284. As part of this last stand, royalist political authority in Shropshire was vested in Commissioners of Association, with specific reference to achieving an advantageous peace. Ottley was appointed a commissioner, along with Wolryche, Sir Edward Acton, Sir Thomas Edwardes and others.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.285-6. Military leadership fell to Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading. Evidently Ottley wrote to him with concerns about growing dissensions and poor morale among the remaining garrisons. On 10 January 1646 Astley sent two replies on the subject, singling out Bridgnorth as of particular concern.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.293-4. The collapse of morale was spreading into the leadership: Richard Cresset, one of the Commissioners of Array, wrote to Ottley for help in suppressing discussion of his decision no longer to attend meetings, which he asserted would lead to his ruin.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.300-1. Military collapse followed. Astley's scratch force, trying to break out to Oxford, was defeated at the Battle of Stow-on-the-Wold on 21 March. On 26 April Bridgnorth was compelled to surrender. Ottley was one of those who negotiated the surrender of the last important Royalist stronghold in Shropshire to Parliament, on relatively favourable terms, which were extended to cover himself. His wife and children were given separate permission to live at Pitchford.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.303. Sequestration Under the terms of the surrender, Ottley and his family, like the garrison, were to choose between peace and exile. He chose to stay and on 28 April received the promised pass, allowing him to march unimpeded back to Pitchford, with his family, his arms and his retinue.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.305. As his estates had been sequestrated, he was forced to compound for delinquency. Meanwhile, Lady Ottley took steps to secure as much of her household property and land as possible. In the immediate aftermath of the surrender, Elinor Davenport, a relative, went to Bridgnorth to establish good relations with the sequestrators dealing with furnishings and clothing.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.306. During May, Thomas Lee, a relative of Sir Francis and a Lincoln's Inn lawyer, probably a parliamentarian, acted for Lady Ottley in negotiating values.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.307. Lady Ottley and the children were provided for fairly quickly, with a fifth of Sir Francis's estates handed over to them for their maintenance by an order of 5 September 1646.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.310. The eldest son, Richard, was given a pass to go the Bridgnorth on 16 June and this may have been in connection with Ottley's request to compound for delinquency, which was made formally on that date. Two days later Sir Francis begged the County Committee to hand over his father's will and all other documentation in their possession and to cease meddling with his estate. It seems that there was friction between the sequestrators and the County Committee, as the latter was removing timber as compensation for Ottley's burning of houses during the war.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.241-2. The sequestrators made an order to prevent removal of timber in June and reiterated it, while trying to speed up appraisal of the value, during the following month.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.309-10. However, the process proved extremely protracted and complex, taking more than 3 years. On 7 September 1646 Ottley's fine was fixed at £2,130.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.242. In response Ottley asked for allowance to be made for timber and other items taken away by the County Committee in contravention of the sequestrators' previous orders. In May 1647 he introduced a request for further losses to be taken into account. On 6 March 1648 the Shropshire Committee for Sequestrations issued an order releasing Ottley's estates, as he had accepted in principle the fine imposed on him.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.241. The signatories included Humphrey Mackworth. However, there were still numerous details to settle. During the summer Ottley was accused in a pamphlet of involvement in a royalist plot to resume resistance in Shropshire by seizing a house known as Dawley Castle and the nearby house of Sir Basil Brooke, presumably Madeley Court. Little came of the plot or the accusation.Audley (1912), p.293-5. However, delays mounted and on 20 December 1648 he was granted a pass by Thomas Fairfax, the Lord General of Parliament's forces, to return to Shropshire to expedite his final composition.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.246. Ottley's younger son, Adam, accompanied him on the trip, staying at Dudmaston Hall, Wolryche's estate near Bridgnorth.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.249-50. By late February 1649 Adam was corresponding with his father about a lawsuit in which the Ottley's were allied with Sir William Aston against Mackworth, although the details of this are unknown.Phillips and Audley (ed), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.252. On 13 April 1649 Sir Francis asked for his son Richard to be included in his composition. The following day a reduced fine of £1860 was announced. Further negotiations over his £4,000 of debts resulted in a further reduction of £660, with the final result that, on 25 June 1649, he was ordered to pay a fine of £1200. Death Ottley died in London on 11 September 1649. Marriage and Family Sir Francis Ottley with his wife, Lucy Edwards, and two of their children, Richard and Mary. An engraving made c.1825 after an oil painting of 1636 by Petrus Troueil, now owned by the Shrewsbury Museums Service. Francis Ottley married Lucy Edwards, daughter of Thomas Edwards of the College, Shrewsbury, in 1624.Phillips (ed), 1894, Ottley Papers, p.28 She was the widow of Thomas Pope, another Shrewsbury resident, and was about eight years older than Ottley. Francis and Lucy Ottley had at least three children, whose baptisms are recorded in the Pitchford parish register. :* Sir Richard Ottley (baptised 15 September 1626) was an important Shropshire politician and MP after the Restoration. :* Adam Ottley (baptised 26 October 1628) was also involved in post-restoration politics in Shropshire, a town clerk of Shrewsbury.Coulton, p.140 :* Mary Ottley (baptised 30 March 1630) lived through the Civil War but died in August 1648.Horton, p.15 Lady Lucy Ottley long outlived her husband and at least two of her children. Both Richard and Adam kept her informed of political developments in London and in their own region, while she regularly sent pies from Shropshire. She was buried on 19 May 1680 at Pitchford.Horton, p.20 Family tree The following family tree is based on information extracted from the heraldic visitations of Shropshire, Lord Hawkesbury's pedigree and the Pitchford parish register.

It was originally imported by missionaries coming from Tonga in this time period and was worn by Fijians to indicate their conversion to Christianity. It is now regarded as Fiji's national dress even though pre-colonial Fijian traditional clothing consisted of clothing such as the malo and the liku. It consists of a rectangle of cloth of varying length, between below-knee and ankle-length, wrapped around the hips and legs and traditionally fastened by tying at the waist. Modern men's sulus may be fastened with buckles. Women's casual or everyday sulus are known as sulu-i-ra, and more elegant full-length ones for dressy occasions as sulu jaba. Men's sulus are known as sulu vakataga. Tailored sulus with pockets are commonly worn as part of Fijian men's business and formal wear, with shirt and sandals and optionally western-style jacket and tie. In certain situations, such as entering a church, wearing a sulu is seen as respectful. Tailored sulus also feature in police and military uniforms. Official uniform sulus come to below the knees and feature a distinctive zigzag hem. In Fiji the sulu is seen as an expression of ethnic Fijian identity. While wearing a sulu is often mandatory for Fijians in certain settings, members of other ethnicities are sometimes discouraged from wearing it.

Diana Aljeiroudi), (; born 15 January 1977) is an award-winning, Berlin-based, Syrian independent film director, producer and co-founder of DOX BOX International Documentary Film Festival in Syria and DOX BOX e.V. non-profit association in Germany. El Jeiroudi was the first Syrian to be a juror in Cannes Film Festival in 2014, when she was part of the first Documentary Film Award jury in the festival. Together with her partner Orwa Nyrabia, El Jeiroudi was also the first Syrian known to be invited to become a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2017. Education El Jeiroudi graduated with a degree of Arts and Humanities from the Damascus University, Syria . From 1998 to 2002, El Jeiroudi worked in Marketing and Advertising, for some highly acclaimed international agencies, before starting up Proaction Film, an independent film production outfit in Damascus, with her partner Orwa Nyrabia. El Jeiroudi also received professional training in film producing and distribution at the INA/Sorbonne in France. Career= Films  After she started a promising career in the field of marketing, in 2002, El Jeiroudi launched a film production company with Partner Orwa Nyrabia. Her first film as film director was The Pot (2005), a short experimental documentary film that premiered in the prestigious Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival in Japan and then, screened in more than 60 countries, and received high critical acclaim. Her second film was entitled Dolls, A Woman from Damascus (2008), was premiered in IDFA and screened in Visions du Réel, Montpellier Cinemed Festival, Copenhagen International Documentary Festival and others in more than 40 countries worldwide. Dolls, A Woman from Damascus was very well received by critics too, CounterPunch wrote: \\"Sometimes there is a film that encapsulates all the tensions and contradictions of a people and a state. This is the merit of Diana El Jeiroudi’s documentary film about the situation of women, the advent of consumer society and the growing influence of Muslim fundamentalism in Syria.\\" In 2017 it was made public that she made a third documentary, co-directed with her long-term collaborator, Syrian photographer and activist Guevara Namer, in 2012. The short film, entitled Morning Fears, Night Chants was premiered in IDFA in 2012 with a crew list made entirely of alias names, and told the story of a young Syrian female singer-songwriter living under danger of prosecution in Damascus. El Jeiroudi's films were also shown in art events and venues, including Kunsthalle Wien, Berlin State Museums, Asian Art Biennial in Taiwan, among others.  Producer, trainer and promoter  As producer of documentary film, El Jeiroudi worked on various successful projects, including Silvered Water, Syria Self-Portrait, which premiered in 2014 Cannes Film Festival, and awarded a Grierson Awards in the BFI London Film Festival 2014, and The Mulberry House, by Scottish-Yemeni Oscar-nominated filmmaker Sara Ishaq, premiered in IDFA 2013 then released theatrically in Austria and Spain. El Jeiroudi was also one of the producers of the 2014 Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize Winner documentary The Return to Homs. In her other capacity, as a documentary film promoter and trainer, El Jeiroudi headed DOX BOX's professional activities side, through which she managed to make the festival the region's most remarkable documentary film platform. She and her partner Orwa Nyrabia, launched DOX BOX in early 2008. The international documentary film festival grew quickly into the most important documentary film gathering in the Arab World. The festival started with screenings in Damascus cinemas but from 2009 on screenings were expanded to other Syrian cities including Homs and Tartus. Along with the annual festival, many workshops and activities were offered to young Syrian filmmakers. The fifth edition of the festival, planned for March 2012, was cancelled in protest of the Syrian government's crackdown on protesters during the ongoing Syrian uprising. Instead, El Jeiroudi advocated for Syrian documentary films to be shown in festivals around the world in what was termed the \\"Dox Box Global Day.\\" The aim, according to the DOX BOX website, was to show \\"how poverty, oppression and isolation do not prevent humans from being spectacularly brave, stubborn and dignified.\\" Her work with DOX BOX earned her and her partner, Orwa Nyrabia, several awards including the Katrin Cartlidge Award and the European Documentary Network's Award in 2012. In 2014, after moving to Berlin, El Jeiroudi announced the creation of DOX BOX e.V., a non- profit association aimed at the support, promotion and education of a new generation of documentary makers in the Arab World, El Jeiroudi's work in Berlin included the creation of the first Arab-European Documentary Convention and an extensive research project that aims at mapping the documentary industry in the Arab region. In addition to being a co-founder and general manager of the association, El Jeiroudi continued to direct and produce films herself. In 2015, El Jeiroudi was one of the jury members for the first-ever documentary film award \\"L'Œil d'or\\" or \\"The Golden Eye\\" in 2015 Cannes Film Festival, she served on juries of various festivals, including IDFA, One World Film Festival in Prague ... among others.

The Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events (CUORE, pronounced ) is a particle physics facility located underground at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Assergi, Italy. CUORE was designed primarily as a search for neutrinoless double beta decay in 130Te, a process that has never been observed. It uses tellurium dioxide (TeO2) crystals as both the source of the decay and as bolometers to detect the resulting electrons. CUORE searches for the characteristic signal of neutrinoless double beta decay, a small peak in the observed energy spectrum around the known decay energy; for 130Te, this is Q = 2527.518 ± 0.013 keV. CUORE can also search for signals from dark matter candidates, such as axions and WIMPs. An observation of neutrinoless double beta decay would conclusively show that neutrinos are Majorana fermions; that is, they are their own antiparticles. This is relevant to many topics in particle physics, including lepton number conservation, nuclear structure, and neutrino masses and properties. The CUORE collaboration involves physicists from several countries, primarily from the United States and Italy. CUORE is funded by the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare of Italy, the United States Department of Energy, and the National Science Foundation of the United States. In September 2014, as part of the testing of the CUORE dilution refrigerator, scientists in the CUORE collaboration cooled a copper vessel with a volume of one cubic meter to 6 mK (0.006 K, −273.144 °C) for 15 days, setting a record for the lowest temperature in the universe over such a large contiguous volume. Detectors The CUORE detectors are TeO2 crystals used as low heat capacity bolometers, arranged into towers and cooled in a large cryostat to approximately 10 mK with a dilution refrigerator. The detectors are isolated from environmental thermal, electromagnetic, and other particle backgrounds by ultrapure low-radioactivity shielding. Temperature spikes from electrons emitted in Te double beta decays are collected for spectrum analysis. The detectors are calibrated using 232Th, the first element in a long decay chain that includes several prominent gamma rays up to 2615 keV. For the construction of CUORE, the collaboration followed several procedures to minimize radioactive contamination that can cause the detectors to register background events at energies close to the energy released in neutrinoless double beta decay. The crystals were grown by the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences with strict radiopurity requirements. The crystals are held in place by PTFE support in towers constructed from oxygen-free high thermal conductivity copper and were assembled under nitrogen inside gloveboxes in cleanrooms. Copper, lead, ancient low-radioactivity Roman lead, and borated polyethylene are used to shield the detectors. Coincidence algorithms are also used to reject events that caused multiple channels to trigger, such as would be caused by an incoming cosmic ray muon or a gamma ray that Compton scatters in multiple crystals. History Cuoricino was the first large-scale bolometer tower used for a rare event search and was operated from 2003 to 2008. It had 62 TeO2 crystals (11 kg of 130Te), with some crystals enriched in 130Te and others with natural isotopic abundance, and some slightly larger and some smaller crystals. The tower was similar in construction to the CUORE tower, and was shielded with copper, lead, and Roman lead. Cuoricino was operated near 8 mK in a relatively small dilution refrigerator. Using the results of Cuoricino, the final details of the CUORE detector towers were finalized, and an assembly sequence was set up for the construction of these 19 towers. CUORE-0 was the first detector tower produced on this assembly line. It had 52 improved TeO2 crystals in a copper tower with better surface purity and significantly reduced radon and other contamination. It was operated in the Cuoricino cryostat from 2013 to 2015 as a first test of the new CUORE assembly procedures as the assembly of the CUORE towers was completed. CUORE is a scaled-up version of CUORE-0, hosted in a new custom-built cryostat capable of supporting a detector with a mass of approximately one ton. It contains 988 5×5×5 cm3 crystals, with 741 kg TeO2 (206 kg of 130Te). The new cryostat was constructed from extremely radiopure materials, and a large Ancient Roman lead shield is used to shield the detectors . There is a 73-ton octagonal shield outside of the cryostat, constructed of lead and borated polyethlene, to reduce the number of environmental gamma rays and neutrons reaching the detector. Due to the large number of discrete detectors, cosmic ray muons can be easily excluded by rejecting events that occur simultaneously in multiple detectors. The CUORE towers were installed in the cryostat in August 2016, and data taking with CUORE began in May 2017. Results Cuoricino took data from April 2003 to June 2008. Final results using 19.75 kg·y of 130Te exposure set world-leading 90% limits on the 130Te 0νββ half-life of > 2.8 × 1024 yr, with a background of 0.18 ± 0.01/(keV·kg·yr) near the 0νββ decay energy. Axion mass limits were also set, consistent with other experiments. The first paper detailing the initial performance of CUORE-0 was published in August 2014 using data taken March to September 2013, with 7.1 kg·y exposure, showing backgrounds reduced by a factor of 6 compared to CUORICINO and an energy resolution of 5.7 keV. A limit on 0νββ was presented in April 2015, combining 9.8 kg·yr of CUORE-0 exposure with the Cuoricino exposure to set a new limit of > 4.0×1024 yr. CUORE has a background goal of 0.01·counts/(keV·kg·y) in the 0νββ region of interest with an energy resolution goal of 5.0 keV. After five years, CUORE is estimated to have a 90% CL half-life sensitivity to 0νββ of 9.5 × 1025 yr, and an effective Majorana neutrino mass sensitivity of 0.05-0.13 eV (depending on the nuclear matrix elements used). First results of the full CUORE experiment were published 2018. No evidence for neutrinoless double beta decay was found. Research and development CUPID is the \\"CUORE Upgrade with Particle Identification, a research and development project for the CUORE detector. Several research groups worldwide are working to develop materials for this upgrade. CUPID aims to use new detector materials in the same cryostat as CUORE. ABSuRD is \\"A Background Surface Rejection Detector\\" research and development project for the CUORE detector. The project aims to develop a scintillating bolometer with the ability to veto ionizing background radiation.

He previously played for the Washington Nationals, Tampa Bay Rays, Arizona Diamondbacks and Chicago Cubs. Amateur career Souza attended Cascade High School in Everett, Washington. In high school, Souza starred for the school's baseball and football teams. Souza committed to attend Washington State University on a baseball scholarship, while also playing football for the Washington State Cougars. Professional career=Washington Nationals The Washington Nationals selected Souza in the third round of the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft. Souza signed with the Nationals rather than attend college, receiving a $346,000 signing bonus. He played for the Hagerstown Suns of the Class A South Atlantic League in 2009 and 2010. In 2009, he had 116 strikeouts in 126 games. He was selected for the South Atlantic League All-Star Game in 2010, but he also received a 50-game suspension for use of a banned substance. Souza played for the Potomac Nationals of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League in 2011. Late in the season, he was benched for breaking team rules, and considered leaving the Nationals' organization to play college football. He returned to the Nationals' organization in 2012, and batted .297 with 23 home runs between Hagerstown and Potomac. In 2013, Souza played for the Harrisburg Senators of the Class AA Eastern League, where he batted .300 with 15 home runs and 20 stolen bases in 77 games. He played in the Arizona Fall League after the regular season. He was added to the Washington 40 man roster on November 1, 2013. Souza split his time between the AAA level Syracuse Chiefs and the Washington Nationals in 2014. He was called up to the majors for the first time on April 12, 2014. Souza made his major league debut on April 13 in a game against the Atlanta Braves. He entered as a defensive replacement in the seventh inning and struck out in his only at-bat of the game, which ended in a 10-2 loss for the Nationals. He was sent down to the Syracuse Chiefs on May 5 in order to make room for Scott Hairston, who had just come off the disabled list. On July 16, 2014, Souza went 2–4 in the Triple-A All-Star Game with a double and a single. Souza's performance at the AAA level was recognized with his selection as the International League's Most Valuable Player and Rookie of the Year. He led the International League in batting average with .354, on base percentage with .435 and slugging percentage with .601. On August 4, Souza was called up to the Washington Nationals after Nate McLouth was put on the 15-day disabled list. On August 8, he was injured in a game against the Atlanta Braves after trying to rob Freddie Freeman of a home run. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list on August 10 with a left shoulder contusion. On September 28, 2014, Souza made a dramatic leaping catch of a fly ball to left-center field for the third out in the ninth inning in the final game of the regular season. The catch secured Jordan Zimmermann's no hitter, the first since the Nationals moved to Washington, D.C. in 2005. Tampa Bay Rays On December 19, 2014, the Nationals traded Souza and Travis Ott to the Tampa Bay Rays in a three-team trade, in which the San Diego Padres traded Joe Ross and a player to be named later (Trea Turner) to the Nationals, the Padres traded Jake Bauers, Burch Smith, and René Rivera to the Rays, and the Padres received Wil Myers, Ryan Hanigan, and Jose Castillo from the Rays. In 2015, Souza started the season as an opening day starter, with his first home run as a Ray hitting the hotel in Rogers Centre. In August 2015, Souza was placed on the disabled list with a broken hand. Overall, Souza played in 110 games, batting .225/.318/.399 with 16 home runs, 40 RBIs, and 12 steals, playing mainly in right field. In 2016, Souza once again saw daily playing time, playing in 120 games with the club. Overall, Souza saw improvements in nearly every statistic, batting .247/.303/.409 with 17 home runs and 49 RBIs In 2017, Souza started the season by batting .330/.411/.543 in the month of April winning American League Player of the Week for the week of April 23 On May 26, Souza comically made national media after he dove for a ball in Target Field that was almost 30 feet away from him, his next at bat he received a standing ovation from Twins fans, then promptly launched a home run up into the second deck. On July 15, Souza set a new career high after hitting his 18th home run of the year into the camera well in Angels Stadium. On July 26, Souza hit a 455-foot home run against the Baltimore Orioles that hit the d-ring catwalk in Tropicana Field. Souza had a breakout year in 2017, improving on nearly every statistic, setting career highs for home runs (30), RBIs (78), runs (78), stolen bases (16), OBP (.351), and SLG (.459), as well as doubling his walk rate and cutting his strikeout percentage to a career low. Because of his performance, he was named the Rays' MVP for the 2017 season. Arizona Diamondbacks On February 20, 2018, the Rays sent Souza to the Arizona Diamondbacks in a three-team trade, in which the New York Yankees acquired Brandon Drury, the Diamondbacks acquired Taylor Widener from the Yankees, and the Rays acquired Nick Solak from the Yankees and Anthony Banda and two players to be named later (Colin Poche and Sam McWilliams) from the Diamondbacks. In an effort to find innovative ways to improve after his first career 30-homer season, he started to use strobe glasses. Every day, he would don the eyewear and head to the outfield for extra batting practice against tiny foam balls. The specs would shut off his field of vision at specific intervals and help him sharpen his pitch recognition. Souza was ejected for the first time in his MLB career on May 12, 2018, by home plate umpire Doug Eddings, after throwing his bat in reaction to a called third strike. On May 22nd, Souza landed on the disabled list for the second time with the same injury, a strained right pectoral muscle, which caused him to miss the first month and a half of the season. On March 25, 2019, Souza tore his left anterior cruciate ligament, lateral collateral ligament, posterior lateral capsule, and partially tore his left posterior cruciate ligament, prematurely ending his 2019 season during spring training. On December 2, 2019, Arizona opted not to tender Souza a contract for the 2020 season, and he became a free agent. Chicago Cubs On January 28, 2020, the Chicago Cubs officially announced that they signed Souza to a 1-year contract. Souza was designated for assignment by the Cubs on September 5, 2020. Souza was released by the organization on September 8. Personal life Souza is a Christian. Early in his baseball career, Souza lived a lifestyle characterized by \\"drinking, staying out late, chasing women.\\"Faith helps Rays' Steven Souza Jr. turn around life, career After his live-in girlfriend cheated on him with a teammate, and he had a confrontation with Potomac Nationals manager Matt LeCroy, Souza briefly quit baseball in 2011. Brent Lillibridge, a friend and former Major League player, invited him to attend his Christian church outside Seattle. Souza accepted, and after a period of time said he \\"could feel the Lord moving\\" and was baptized at age 22. He returned to baseball and worked to turn his life around. Souza married Mikaela Peckman in 2015. The couple welcomed their first child, a son named Micah, in December 2016. References= Notes  Further reading  * Michael, Matt.

It lies about west of East Shining Tree Lake. The community of Shining Tree lies on its east shore. Location The community of Shining Tree lies on Highway 560, in Northern Ontario, which runs west from Highway 11 to Highway 144. It is midway between Sudbury to the south and Timmins to the north. The lake may also be accessed by float plane. West Shining Tree Lake is connected to five other lakes through narrow passages. The lake has over of highly irregular shoreline. There are many islands, channels and bays. In the past West Shining Tree Lake was on an Ojibway canoe route from Bear Island, Temagami, to the Mattagami First Nation, north of Gogama. The Ojibway named the area \\"Wasakwagama\\", meaning White Tree Water, after the many white birches growing there, particularly on McRae Island. A fur trading post was established in 1905 by Mort and John Moore. They mistranslated Wasakwagama as \\"Shining Tree\\", whether by accident or design, and called their post the Shining Tree General Store. This became the name of the town and the lake. Environment The region is at an elevation of above sea level, with gently undulating terrain of rounded hills sculpted by glacial action. The general drainage direction in the area is towards the north or east. The bedrock is mafic or intermediate metavolcanic rock. The area has unusually elevated levels of copper, cadmium and zinc. Gold has been mined in the region in the past, and gold exploration was continuing as of 2012. Average temperatures range from from December to February, up to from June to August. An average of snow falls each winter. Average annual rainfall is The land is covered by typical boreal forest vegetation. Game The land around the lake has stable populations of black bear and moose, and plentiful grouse, snowshoe hare and duck. All of these may be hunted in the fall season. A license is required. Hunters may use rifles or bows. Fish include northern pike, walleye (pickerel), smallmouth bass, whitefish, perch, and various species of trout including lake trout, brook trout and rainbow trout. Again, a fishing license is required. Ice fishing may be practiced in winter. There are several tourist resorts that offer housekeeping cabins, boat rentals and other services.

Melo told the Xth enquiry in 2013 to investigate the role of arms sales to Iran and the Army's \\"Fundo de Defesa do Ultramar\\" slush fund, saying that da Costa had asked the Army about arms sales to Iran on 2 December 1980, and that on 5 December, the day after his death, the Army had issued an order illegally declaring arms sales to be under its jurisdiction, not the Defence Minister's.noticias.pt.msn.com, 14 February 2013, Camarate: Nuno Melo recomenda audição de quem autorizou venda de armas ao Irão Portugal became a major arms supplier to Iraq, selling 3.5bn escudos' worth in 1982 and 6bn in 1983. With Iraq's increasing difficulties keeping up payments for Portuguese arms, on 29 September 1983 the Portuguese government of Mário Soares secretly authorised sales to Iran. Several months later Portugal's President Ramalho Eanes expressed surprise at learning at the presence at Lisbon Airport of an Iranian aircraft carrying arms. Security arrangements for an Iran Air jumbo jet were such that Iraqi diplomats in Lisbon learned of them. In 1984 Portugal sold Iran 1.5bn escudos' worth of arms, making it Portugal's second-largest customer after Iraq. Iran–Contra The Portuguese Expresso revealed in January 1987 that in 1984–86 $8.3m of Portuguese arms had been supplied to the Nicaraguan Contras by US officials involved in Iran–Contra.Associated Press, 10 January 1987, Newspaper says Secord Ordered Portuguese Arms for Contras With AM-US-Iran-Contra Week, Bjt The arms amounted to 1,900 tons of arms and ammunition, including 1,500 tons shipped in 1985.

A detailed excavation of the site started in November 2013 by the State Archaeological Directorate led to discovery of several artifacts and six tablets. Geography=Location Moghalmari is located at . Excavation 300px 300px The first detailed excavation of the Moghalmari site started in 2003 by a group of archaeologists led by Asok Datta from Department of Archaeology, University of Calcutta. In the first phase of the excavation in 2003-04, two sites in the Mogholmari village was selected for the excavation. While the first site named MGM1, consisted of a structural mound with bricks strewn over the surface, locally known as Sakhisener dhibi or Sashisener dhibi. The other site named MGM2 situated over present habitation, consist of five circular brick bases of stupas and pottery strewn over the surface. The first site revealed a triratha projection in the western part of the site consisting of a wall running north–south which is considered to be a wall of a small monastic complex. The excavation also revealed square/rectangular structures (considered to be cells) apart from other antiquities. The second site revealed three circular brick structures considered to be base of stupas. The artifact remains indicated that it belongs to 6th-7th Century. Further excavation revealed silt deposition of 55 cm and the artifacts found below that layer consisted of Black and Red Wares. In 2006-07 another extensive excavation was started on MGM1 and another site named MGM3. The excavations revealed a long wall covered with stucco decorations consisting of floral, animals and human figurines, and also evidenced two stages of construction of the structure. Another important discovery of the excavation was the discovery of a Buddha image on a slate stone. Another round of excavations in 2012 revealed various stucco figures in the walls with votive tablets having figure of Buddha as the central element, and flanked by Bodhisattas and Buddhist inscriptions. The excavation also revealed a pradikshana path in the eastern and southern part of the site. The excavation has also revealed a central temple structure with cells surrounding a square courtyard. According to Rajat Sanyal, one of the member of the excavating team, the structure was constructed during the Vajrayana phase of Buddhism, where deity worship started in Buddhism, which can be inferred from the presence of figures of deities in the walls including Jambala and saraswati. The figurines and the artifacts evidences towards influence of Gupta tradition of middle Ganga region.

The aviation museum is located on the north side of Gloucestershire Airport, between Gloucester and Cheltenham. It houses a number of aircraft, aero engines, cockpits and other related exhibits. It is themed on the early development of Jet aircraft, in particular the role played by the Gloster Aircraft Company and other local firms such as Dowty Rotol and Smiths Industries. The museum is also the custodian of the Russell Adams photographic archive. History The organisation was formed in 1986 and established as a company limited by guarantee. The museum first opened to the public at the Gloucester Trading Estate, the former Brockworth aerodrome. With the aid of grants and public donations, it began to amass a collection of aircraft. The museum's first significant public opening began with a temporary exhibition in a hangar adjacent to Gloucestershire Airport. This had to close in 2000 after it was announced the former wartime hangar was to be demolished. The aircraft were dispersed to a number of locations in Gloucestershire including, briefly, at the former GAC 'shadow' factory at Bentham. A workshop was established at Brockworth Court and the remaining airframes eventually made their way back to Gloucestershire Airport, where they were placed in open storage. In 2005, an Avro Anson in the collection was sold for restoration. The museum made a number of unsuccessful bids to the Heritage Lottery Fund to construct a purpose-built facility before finally submitting plans for a building at Gloucestershire Airport. In January 2011 plans were approved for a new to house the museum's collection. One year later, an agreement was reached for a 45 year lease of the land the building sits on. The museum opened provisionally from 24 August 2013 and officially in May 2014. A Gloster Meteor was added in 2013 and a Gloster Javelin purchased from RAF Leeming in 2014 was moved to the museum a few months later. With these acquisitions, the museum had a significant number of aircraft on display outside and as a result announced a fundraising campaign for an extension in 2019.

Early life  Kingsley Kuku was born in Arogbo, the traditional headquarters of the Ijaw ethnic nationality in Ondo State, Nigeria. He had his early education in Arogbo before moving out of the community to further his study.  Education  Kuku attended Patrick Catholic Primary School, Arogbo, Ondo State (1977–1983), Nigeria. He had his secondary education at Ijaw national High School, Arogbo, Ondo State (1983–1988). He later proceeded for his higher education and obtained a Bachelor of Education degree in English Language at the Ondo State University, Ado Ekiti, now Ekiti State University in 1995; and M.Sc. in International Relations and Strategic Studies at Igbinedion University, Okada Edo State (2011–2012), Nigeria. He also had a stint at University of Cambridge where he got a certificate in Dispute Resolution in 2008. In recognition of his role in the advancement of Nigeria's fledgling democracy, Kuku was conferred with an Honorary Doctorate in Political Science - Phd (Honoris Causa) in November 2013 by the Igbinedion University, Okada Edo State, Nigeria. Kuku holds a Doctor Of Philosophy (PhD- Research) degree from Selinus University Of Sciences and Literature in International Relations (Peace Studies) and an Executive Certificate in Public Leadership from the Prestigious Harvard Kennedy School of Government.  Activism  Kuku embraced activism early in his university days as one of the socio-politically conscious young Nigerian students who were agitated about the then military rule and dictatorship in Nigeria. He was a student leader and one time National Mobilization Officer of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) who was active in the campaign and struggle for the demilitarization of the Nigerian society and absolute return of democratic governance to Nigeria. Kuku's experience in the leadership of the apex students' body in Nigeria set a platform for him to be at the vanguard of many organisations that were set out to tackle injustice and maladministration within the Nigerian socio-political structure. He was a pioneer member of Ijaw Youth Council (IYC), a notable ethnic rights group in Nigeria; and was the second spokesman of the Council. He was signatory to the historical Kaiama Declaration. Kingsley Kuku has remained a vocal voice and an active stakeholder for the development and restoration of lasting peace in the oil- rich Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Hon. Kingsley Kuku with Niger Delta Ex- Agitators who completed trainings as pilot through the Presidential Amnesty Programme Hon. Kingsley Kuku with Political Officers of the Embassies of the US & Some European Countries in Nigeria after a meeting in Abuja, Nigeria  Politics  After his involvement in the Ijaw Youth Council, Kuku contested and was elected as a Member of the Ondo State House of Assembly and became Chairman of the House Committee on Information for four years. He was at various times Special Assistant and Head of Conflict Management Unit at the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC); a Member of the Presidential Committee on Amnesty; and Secretary of the Presidential Committee on Peace and Conflict Resolution in the Niger Delta. Kuku's diverse engagements in the listed official designations paved the way for him for a greater task. In January 2011, he was appointed Special Adviser to the President of Nigeria, Dr Goodluck Jonathan, on the Niger Delta and Chairman Niger Delta Presidential Amnesty Programme. President Jonathan reappointed him into the same position in July 2011 after the general elections in 2011. As the Chairman of the Presidential Amnesty Programme for ex-agitators in the oil-bearing communities in the Niger Delta, Kuku oversaw the disarmament and demobilization of 30,000 ex-agitators and he is superintending the skilling and reintegration of these youths into civil society. The ongoing reintegration component of the Amnesty Programme, which is geared towards building capacity in the deprived Niger Delta youths that are enrolled in the Presidential Amnesty Programme, has so far attained considerable measure of its set objectives. Kuku exerts full management and administrative authority within the limits of the established budget, standing about N60 billion naira in 2012 (about $350 million USD), and government operating policies; and delegates various functions to several departmental heads in a structured organisation. On the third anniversary of the Amnesty Programme in 2012, Kuku confirmed at a press briefing that the peace being restored to the oil producing Niger Delta region of Nigeria, through the coordination of the Amnesty Programme, has significantly increased the production capacity of oil operators in the Niger Delta region and saved Nigeria amount running in billions of dollars in oil revenue within just three years. Remaking the Niger Delta: Challenges & Opportunities Remaking The Niger Delta: Challenges and Opportunities - by Kingsley Kuku Not a few activists, political pundits and experts on international development had raised concerns on the insurgency in the Niger Delta region particularly at the height of the tension between 2004 and 2008. The concerns, which were based on the implications of the unrest in the region on the overall revenue of the Federal Republic of Nigeria of which over 80% of the nation's revenue is drawn from the proceeds of the oil activities that run in the Niger Delta, were brought to the front burner of national discourse for government and its security agencies to rise up against the challenges of violent assaults targeted not just at the economic soul of Nigeria but at peace and security of the nation; and at the efforts of the Nigerian government in sustaining its foreign policy drive. Like other patriots and stakeholders in the development of the Niger Delta, Kuku has made postulations for change and demonstration actions towards the growth of the region and advancement of Nigeria being part of the several interventionist strategies such as the Niger Delta Development Commission, Amnesty Programme (headed by Kingsley Kuku), Ministry of Niger Delta and other initiatives that are set out to bring an end to the crisis in the Nigerian oil-producing states, ensure lasting peace and nurture the country's economy for better. Kuku, who said in one of his media chats that, \\"in May 2009, before the amnesty proclamation, production output had dipped to 680,000 barrels of per day, from 2.2 million barrels per day. Due to the amnesty programme, the nation’s crude oil production today stands at about 2.7 million barrels per day and the target of 4.5 million barrels per day is plausible, if amnesty gains are sustained,\\" also warned in his book -Remaking the Niger Delta: Challenges and Opportunities - that the oil companies and other stakeholders cannot continue with business as usual while he and other concerned citizens continue to make strenuous attempts to re-orient and reintegrate former agitators. He emphasised that the historical grievances that gave rise to militancy and insurgency ought to be addressed as Nigeria owes it to the present and future generations to put environmental remediation on the agenda while ensuring that adequate Corporate Social Responsibility commitment is extracted from the multinational oil companies that are operating in the Niger Delta communities towards meaningful development within their immediate operational base in Nigeria for peace and security to reign supreme in the country. In similar form Kuku made a chilling pronouncement which was reported by many newspapers in Nigeria in which he described the prevailing peace in Nigeria as \\"fragile\\" and admonished that the peace in the region may relapse to another brand of restiveness, unless relevant developmental agencies intensify efforts to change the face of the nation’s oil rich belt. One of the significant features of the Kuku-led amnesty programme is its impact on the lives of the ex-militants many of whom have now been transformed into better citizens who are not only concerned about personal upliftment but the progress and development of the society as a whole. This much is reflected in the present preoccupation of many of the ex- agitators. For instance, a leader of the ex militants in Ondo State established a skill acquisition centre in the State for the purpose of training youths across the country in various skills that will make them fit for employment, particularly by the various oil companies in the country. Similarly, in the wake of a terrible flood that ravaged many communities in Nigeria, including some part of the Niger Delta, some of the ex-militants contributed funds and relief materials to support and improve the lot of the people that were affected by the flood. International engagements / Recognition Since the tension characterized by armed violence and unrest within the Niger Delta in the time past was not limited to Nigeria and Nigerians alone, many foreign countries and their nationals had cautioned about the potentially dangerous end of the disorder that was engulfing the oil-rich Niger Delta region which is one of the major suppliers of crude oil to the international market. The situation, which chillingly gripped the attention of the international community that is consistently suing for peace and security around the world and promoting increase in international trade amongst the developed and the developing countries, had given impetus for notable Western nations such as the United Kingdom to provide some form of interventions in addressing the challenges of insecurity and violence in the Niger Delta region to protect Nigeria's economic lifeline and prevent escalation of crises across the country and within the West African sub- region. Amongst the strategies, offered Nigeria as support, in stemming the disturbance and uprising from the Niger Delta agitators was the establishment of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Niger Delta by the British Parliament with the members of the group drawn from Members of Parliament (MP) across party lines. In recognizing the ideas initially suggested by different foreign nations and international organisations in mitigating against total collapse of law and order in Niger Delta, Kuku moved further to reach out to other strategic foreign partners and entities, through several tools of diplomacy, for technical support in achieving his mandate of office as the Chairman of the Presidential Amnesty Programme and the Special Adviser on Niger-Delta to the Nigerian President, Goodluck Jonathan. In 2011, Kuku was a guest speaker at an internationally renowned institute for international affairs, Chatham House London where he delivered a paper titled, Amnesty in the Niger Delta: Sustaining Peace and Surmounting Challenges. The occasion was an important climate for Kuku to share the progress and challenges of his responsibilities in the Nigerian government with the international community with the view to having more committed and supportive hands on board towards alleviating the problems of the Niger-Delta. Similarly, in 2013 Kuku was invited by the programme managers of another leading global institute for international affairs, Wilson Centre USA. At Wilson Centre, Kuku spoke on a topic - A Briefing on the Niger Delta: Where Things Stand - in which he narrated the struggles of himself and his team at the Amnesty Office in reversing the tide of calamity in the Niger Delta to the point it is now. After the event, the Wilson Centre published the outcome of the discussion with an opening quotation that reads - \\"It is critical to discuss what the Niger Delta is now, not what it was.\\" – The Honorable Kingsley Kuku\\", in accentuating the opportunities and promise of the new Niger Delta as enunciated by Kuku at the Wilson Centre. In what could be regarded as a smart diplomatic move, Kuku made the list of some notable personalities around the world who attended a special dinner for President Obama inauguration in US. Kuku was seen in some exclusive photographs with President Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Tracy as well as with other important personalities in international politics and development. Hon. Kingsley Kuku being presented with Honorary Citizenship of the State of Georgia by Members of the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus (GLBC) in Atlanta, Georgia USA. In early April 2015, Kuku was selection as one of the recipients of the Honorary Citizenship of the State of Georgia in the United States by the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus (GLBC). And according to a report by a major Nigerian newspaper on the notification of the award to Kuku by the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus, \\"The Commendation and honour from the State of Georgia is in recognition of your (Kuku's) unrivalled contribution to Nigeria’s socioeconomic growth and development, leading the Presidential Amnesty Program transparently and undertaken monumental projects that have contributed immensely towards reforming the ex-agitators and contributing manpower to the Oil & Gas, aviation, logistics and other services industry in Nigeria and Africa at large\\". At the Commendation & Award ceremony, which was held on May 9, 2015 in Atlanta, Georgia USA, Kuku delivered a moving acceptance speech and pleasantly surprised the guests as he dedicated the honour to President Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria who Kuku described as the man \\"who accorded me an opportunity to unravel, nurture and deploy my talents creditably to the service and advancement of Nigeria\\". Interests Kuku enjoys writing, consistent study in Global Peace & Security, Enlightened Discussions In Defence Of Human Rights & Political Discourses. Personal life Kuku is an ardent and unrepentant respecter of family values.

Although she has struggled commercially, her work has been recognized at various points in her career such as with membership in the Legion of Honor of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in France and the Sistema Nacional de Creadores de Arte in Mexico. Life Zamora was born in 1935 in Mexico City. She began her artistic studied with muralist José Hernández Delgadillo in 1956, later marrying him and having three children, Beatriz, Francisco and Myriam. From 1964 to 1966, she studied ceramics with José Castaño in Mexico City. From 1967 to 1970, she studied art history at the Instituto de Cultura Superior. In 1972, she went to France to study at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Through her artistic career, she has struggled commercially. In 1980, she moved to New York, living and working there for eight years. However, even here she had problems getting her work accepted. She returned penniless to Mexico City, struggling to have a place to live and store her artwork. Today she has over 2,700 pieces in all sizes in storage. She remained married to Hernández Delgadillo until his death in 2000. She lives in Mexico City. Artistry After her time in Paris, she returned to Mexico in 1973 and abandoned painting with a brush. Instead she began using earth, which culminated in an exhibition called La Tierra (The Earth). This move has been explained as a merging of her theoretical objectives with those of the New York School of abstract expressionism . In 1977, she shifted again, towards the creation of black monochrome works using different materials such as obsidian, charcoal, smudge, oxidized metals, coal, semi-precious stones and other black materials to create works that have different textures and shines. Her work has been compared to that of Frenchman Pierre Soulages, in that he was the only painter in Europe dedicated to the use of only black as she is the only one in the Americas to do the same. However, her artwork is very different from Soulages in style. Eduardo Rubio wrote in 1988 that “the work of no other Mexican artist has unleashed so many passions and has been so misunderstood as … (hers).” Painter José Zúñiga has stated that “Beatriz’s paintings are not understood, mostly due to the lack of information we have about present-day trends in art. I don’t think that Beatriz improvises, as many have said, and what I most celebrate is her boldness in showing her work.” Asked why she paints only in black she responds “Just because.” “Black is itself; its sameness. Between galaxies, there are millions of light-years of this color in the universe. Earth is a fragment of that universe… Black is the full power of natural law and the base of my work.” She also says “To put is simply, black is the theme because it is the absolute, it is cosmic and it implies the common and the sublime as part of life itself; it is also a means of communication as expression and as an end… it is the purpose of my work.” Career Zamora had her first individual exhibition at the Antonio Souza Gallery in Mexico City in 1962. Since then, she has exhibited individually about eighty times and participated in about 250 collective shows in Mexico and abroad. Individual exhibitions include those at the Museo de la Ciudad de México (2012), Casa de Francia in Mexico City (2010), the Centro de la Juventud Arte y Cultura FUTURAMA in Mexico City (2009), the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (2009), Galería Pecanins in Mexico City (2000, 2005, 2008), the French Embassy in Mexico (2008), the Museo de Arte Contemporario de Yucatán in Mérida (2006), the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana (2005), the Museo Universitario del Chopo in Mexico City (2004), the Universidad Autónoma de Guanajuato (2003), the Galería Ku in San Miguel de Allende (2001) and the Museo Nacional del Carbón in Agujitas, Coahuila (2000) . She has received three major grants for her work, two from the Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes (CONACULTA) in 1993 and 1997, and one from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation in New York in 2002. Since 1979 she has donated works to institutions such as the Colegio de México, the Fundación Barceló in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, CONACULTA and the Universidad Pedagógica Nacional . Her work has been recognized at various points in her career. In 1977, she was made a member of the Legion of Honor of the Académie des Beaux- Arts in France. In 1978, she won the Salón Nacional de Artes Plásticas at the Palacio de Bellas Artes. However, a young artist angry at her win, took the painting and threw it down some stairs, damaging it. In 1999, she received the Gran Premio Omnilife 99 at the Salón de Octubre in Guadalajara . In 2004, COMUARTE held a tribute to her. In 2011, Zamora was accepted as a member of the Sistema Nacional de Creadores de Arte. Zamora is a member of the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana, the International Association of Artists in the United States, the Sociedad Mexicana de Artistas Plásticos and the Confédération Internationale des Sociétés d´Auteurs et Compositeurs .

It is named for its former occupant, the Geological Survey of Canada. The building was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1955 as it is one of the oldest remaining buildings in Ottawa, and over the years it has served as home to various public and cultural institutions. History The Sussex Drive facade The oldest part of the building (the George Street wing) was constructed in 1863 under the ownership of James Skead, a local businessman, and Edward Griffen. Griffen soon after sold his share to Skead and the building became known as Skead's Hotel. From 1864 to 1871, it was leased to the Crown and served as a military barracks, known as the George Street Barracks. It sat vacant for several years before being purchased in 1875 by restaurateur William Mills, who operated it for a few years as the Clarendon House Hotel. After numerous scandals, including the alleged assault of Mills' daughter by F. A. Martin, MPP for Ste. Agathe, Manitoba, the Clarendon was closed by 1877. The Government of Canada purchased the property in 1879 to be used as the headquarters of the Geological Survey of Canada. Soon after its purchase, the building hosted the inaugural exhibit of the Canadian Academy of Arts in March of 1880, with the works from this exhibit later forming the initial collection of the National Gallery of Canada. Later that year, the building was retrofitted to serve as the offices and museum of what was then called the Geological and Natural History Survey of Canada. The museum and its collections, which attracted 9,549 visitors in its first year, would later become the genesis of Canada’s national museums. The Sussex Drive section was rebuilt in 1881 on its original footprint. The Geological Survey of Canada remained in the building until 1911 when it moved to the Victoria Memorial Museum. The building was renovated again, this time to accommodate the federal Department of Mines, and a new laboratory was added to the George Street wing in 1917.

When states apply and are granted of the federal funds, federal legislation provides guidelines on how to specifically distribute the money. For example, at least 75% of the funds must be apportioned on programs that follow one of the approved home visiting models. The rest of the money may be allocated for “promising approaches”, where they have shown some evidence of effectiveness, but yet to have strong assessment of evidence. Local programs may apply for funding in this classification.National Conference of State Legislatures. \\"Alert : Federal Home Visiting Initiative Deadline Approaching\\". Retrieved Oct 20, 2013. Implementation=Home visitors Home visitors are trained professionals who focus on early childhood and maternal health; they may be nurses, social workers, or early childhood specialists with additional training. Their scope of practice includes children and maternal health, parenting and family education, child abuse and neglect. Home visitors provide education and resources to parents in multiple layers, such as educating on normal trajectory of early childhood, identifying abnormal development or modifying problematic behavior, offering referrals to community resources, such as Medicaid, job training, employment services, or food assistance. They also provide mental health counseling to parents who may have substance abuse problems, or maternal depression. Target Home visiting services aim to support families who are most disadvantaged, or at risk. This population includes first time parents, low- income parents, single or teen parents, as well as parents with substance abuse or addictions, or mental health issues such as maternal depression. Benefit=Evidence-based practices Evidence-based practice means that there has been a set of standards of practices established from clinically proved trials and researches that produced consistently improved outcomes. Individual clinician's training and organizational and systems changes could influence the implementation of clinical guidelines.Glanz, K., Rimer, B.K., Viswanath, K. (Eds.) (2008). Health Behavior and Health Education (4th edition). San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass. Chapter 14, Diffusion of Innovations (pp 313–334). The review of home visiting programs reports that intensive and frequent visits from trained professionals to families from the prenatal stage up to the second or third years of the child's life produces a positive and improved outcome in maternal and child's health. The frequency could be as often once a week to at least once or twice every month in the beginning stage of home visits. Evidence Quality practices offered by well-trained home visitors in Home Visiting Programs have been shown to be effective in these areas: lower number of low birth weight babies, 50% decrease in child abuse or neglect, 25% increase in reading and math test grades in 1-3 grades, 60% increase in high school graduation rate. If trained visitors diligently follow the standards, the cost-benefit studies have demonstrated returns of investment from $1.75 to $5.70 on every dollar spent.  Cost=Federal funding Social Security Act, Title V, Section 511 (42 USC 711) states to conduct a statewide assessment on needs of the at-risk population to be eligible for the grant award. It also requires states to achieve “quantifiable, measurable improvements” on the five areas of family life, listed above. HHS appropriates $100 million for fiscal year 2010, $250 million for FY 2011, $350 million for FY 2012, $400 million for FY 2014. 3% of available funding is reserved to fund Indian Tribes. Responsibility of States States also must file a report to the Secretary of HHS on the progress of the program, which must show improvements on at least four areas at the end of the first three-year period. HHS holds authority to terminate the grant to any states that fail to comply or demonstrate improvements. A final report must be submitted to HHS, no later than December 31, 2015.

Hashomer Hatzair, along with HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed of Israel, is a member of the International Falcon Movement – Socialist Education International. Early formation Pioneer's camp of Gdud Shomeria, 1920, Mandatory Palestine Kfar Yeladim principal Shneur Zalman Pugachov sitting among a group of girl students (probably graduates) and teachers Zvi Zohar, Arieh Allweil and Dov Yoffe (~ 1926-1931) Hashomer Hatzair youth group of the city Slonim in Poland, 1934 Hashomer Hatzair came into being as a result of the merger of two groups, Hashomer (\\"The Guard\\") a Zionist scouting group, and Ze'irei Zion (\\"The Youth of Zion\\") which was an ideological circle that studied Zionism, socialism and Jewish history. Hashomer Hatzair is the oldest Zionist youth movement still in existence. Initially Marxist-Zionist, the movement was influenced by the ideas of Ber Borochov and Gustav Wyneken as well as Baden-Powell and the German Wandervogel movement. Hashomer Hatzair believed that the liberation of Jewish youth could be accomplished by aliyah (immigration; literally \\"ascent\\") to Palestine and living in kibbutzim. After the First World War the movement spread to Jewish communities throughout the world as a scouting movement. Psychoanalysis was also an influence, partly through Siegfried Bernfeld; so was the philosopher Martin Buber. Otto Fenichel also supported Hashomer Hatzair's efforts to integrate Marxism with psychoanalysis. Hashomer Hatzair's educators sought to shape the image of the child from birth to maturity; some were aware of the work of the Soviet educator Anton Makarenko who also propounded collectivist education. Members of the movement settled in Mandatory Palestine as early as in 1919. In 1927, the four kibbutzim founded by Hashomer Hatzair banded together to form the Kibbutz Artzi federation. The movement also formed a political party which shared the name Hashomer Hartzair, advocating a binational solution in mandatory Palestine with equality between Arabs and Jews. That is why, when a small group of Zionist leaders met in New York in May 1942 in the Biltmore Hotel, Hashomer Hatzair representatives voted against the so-called Biltmore Program. In 1936, the kibbutz-based Hashomer Hatzair party launched an urban political party, the Socialist League of Palestine, which would represent non-kibbutzniks who shared the political approach of the members of Hashomer Hatzair kibbutzim and the youth movement in the political organizations of the Yishuv (as the Jewish community in Palestine was known). The Socialist League was the only Zionist political party within the Yishuv to accept Arab members as equals, support Arab rights, and call for a binational state in Palestine. In the 1930s, Hashomer Hatzair (along with Mapai) was affiliated with the centrist Marxist \\"Two-and-a-half\\" International, the International Revolutionary Marxist Centre (also known as the \\"London Bureau\\") rather than either the more mainstream socialist Labour and Socialist International or the Leninist Third International. Growth and the Holocaust Hashomer Hatzair's 1 May parade in Haifa in the 1950s By 1939, Hashomer Hatzair had 70,000 members worldwide. The movement's membership base was in Eastern Europe. With the advent of World War II and the Holocaust, members of Hashomer Hatzair focused their attention on resistance against the Nazis. Mordechaj Anielewicz, the leader of Hashomer Hatzair's Warsaw branch, became head of the Jewish Fighting Organization and one of the leaders of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Other members of the movement were involved in Jewish resistance and rescue in Hungary, Lithuania and Slovakia. The leaders of Hashomer Hatzair in Romania were arrested and executed for anti-fascist activities. The former head of Hashomer Hatzair in Łódź, Abraham Gancwajch,W. D.

Today 1 May parade in Jerusalem 2009 Today, Hashomer Hatzair continues as a youth movement based in Israel, and operates internationally. In Europe, North and Latin America, as well as in Australia, Hashomer Hatzair organizes activities and camps (machanot) for the youth. Activities are still ideological, but over time have been adapted to the needs of modern communities, vastly different from the context in which Hashomer Hatzair was created. The movement has more than 7,000 members worldwide (excluding Israel) running weekly youth activities and camps in Germany, Canada, the United States, Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, France, Belgium. Austria, Italy, Switzerland, Netherlands, Hungary, Bulgaria, Belarus, Ukraine, Australia and Poland. Famous alumni include Arik Einstein, Dan Shechtman, Tony Cliff, Ehud Gazit, Ernest Mandel, Mordecai Anielewicz, Abraham Leon, Benny Morris, Eliane Karp, Leopold Trepper, Amnon Linn, Zahara Rubin, Haviva Reik, Abba Hushi, Sam Spiegel, Irv Weinstein, Manès Sperber, Leon Rosselson, Juliana Rozestan, José Gurvich, Joel Westheimer, Prisoner X (Ben Zygier),http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy- defense/in-australia-jewish-community-reacts-with-shock-and- grief.premium-1.503252 Milo Adler Gilles, Gila Martow, and even Isser Harel and Menachem Begin who were briefly members before joining Mapai and the right wing Betar respectively, as well as Kerem B'Yavneh's Rabbi Avraham Rivlin. Noam Chomsky sympathized with and worked with the group, although he was never a member. With the merger of the United Kibbutz Movement and Kibbutz Artzi, the likelihood of a merger between Hashomer Hatzair and UKM's youth movement, Habonim Dror, has increased and the two youth movements, once rivals, have increasingly co-operated in various countries where they co-exist. The movements even share an office in New York. However, the views of each movement on religion may be an obstacle to merger as Habonim Dror has a stronger identification with cultural Judaism as opposed to Hashomer Hatzair, which has been at times stridently secular and anti-religious — seeing itself as a leader of a legitimate expression of a secular stream of Judaism.

Today the movement operates in Tzavta Centro Comunitario (Tzavta Community Center), in the neighborhood of Almagro, City of Buenos Aires. It is one of 9 Zionist Youth Movements in the city. It has around 120 members, running regular Saturday activities and secular Kabalat Shabat service, besides two machanot per year. Australia The movement in Australia is located in Melbourne and was established in 1953 as a break away from Habonim Dror. There was briefly a ken (branch) in Sydney during the 1960s, but it closed due to a lack of members. Many of the original bogrim (leaders) of Australian Hashomer Hatzair settled in kibbutz Nirim. Its building in Melbourne is known as Beit Anielewicz, located in the suburb of St Kilda East. It runs weekly meetings as well as bi- annual camps which take place in the Australian countryside, during the summer and winter months. Hashomer Hatzair Australia is a member of the Australasian Zionist Youth Council (AZYC). Currently there are around 70 members of 'Hashy' Australia. Meetings for chanichim/ot (participants) from school years 3-12 are on Sunday afternoons and evenings. During Year 10 (age: 15–16) chanichim/ot undergo a 'hadracha' (leadership) course. This course is run by current bogrim/ot in the movement and teaches the chanichim/ot leadership skills which are used when they lead members of the Junior movement in Year 11. The current Year 11 madatzim/ot (leaders) are from the kvutzat (group) Elifaz. Hashomer Hatzair Australia has a strong belief that chanichim/ot should be active in the community, helping whenever they can. Members often go to rallies, actively pursue social justice locally and abroad, and run programs for disadvantaged children. As with most of the kenim around the world, every year Hashy sends the chanichim/ot who have just completed school on a 10-month Shnat program in Israel. Hashy is an active part of the Hashomer Hatzair World Movement and regularly interacts with other kenim as well as other movements.  Austria  The Austrian Hashomer Hatzair traces its roots to the original Hashomer Hatzair founded in the Galicia region of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Hashomer were among the earliest members of the Österreichischer Pfadfinderbund in 1914. We also founded the first Ken which is located at Desider-Friedmannplatz 1b, 1010 Vienna. It holds around hundred members. The Ken meets every Saturday at 3:00, its peulots are usually from 3-5 and the evenings program is from 5-7. The Ken usually has four active kvutzots and one Bogrim kvutza. The Ken has two machanot each year in the winter and summer and a couple of tijulim, every second year the oldest kvutzot the bogrim and the oldest kvutza go to machane Israel in which they attend the Seminar Tzofi or Tzofinodet.  Belgium  In Belgium, Hashomer Hatzaïr was established in 1920. Today, 250 hanihim come each Saturday to take part in folk dancing (rekudei'am), ludic activities (peoulot) and Shabbat celebrations (oneg shabbat). Four camps are organized throughout the year. The November, Winter and Easter camps usually take place in the Netherlands and the Summer camp in France. The shaliah is Tal Eitan and the shirfa madrihim is composed of the kvutzot of Yehiam (2002) and Maanit (2003) . Until 2006 there was a ken in Liege, but it closed because it was too small. Hashomer Hatzaïr in Belgium is part of the Brith which is composed of the five zionist youth groups of Belgium : Hashomer Hatzair, Hanoar Hatzioni , Habonim Dror, Bnei Hakiva and Jeunesse Juive Laïque. Brazil In Brazil, the movement is informally called \\"Shomer\\" and has five branches: Rio de Janeiro (2), São Paulo, Florianópolis and Brasília. Normally, the activities encompass weekly meetings as well as two summercamps (machané) per year. Besides Haflagot, Acantonamentos, Machane de Lag Baomer. In Rio, where the tnuah is bigger, it embodies one of the left-wing Zionist institutions in the local Jewish community, playing a leading role in subjects like the peace process in the Middle East. The educational activities are also aimed at the challenges of Brazilian society, such as social and environmental issues. There are about 300 members in the national movement USA and Canada In the United States and Canada camps last through the school summer vacation. The two summer camps in Liberty, New York, USA and Perth, Ontario, Canada are both called Camp Shomria or \\"Mosh\\". In addition, the movement runs activities in cities across the continent throughout the year promoting the Israeli–Palestinian peace process, socialist-Zionism, Hagshama Atzmit (self-actualization), social activism (tikkun olam), and withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza. Through seminars, camps (winter/summer), worldwide programs, and weekly activities wherein youth leads youth, Hashomer Hatzair aims to create a just world through socialism, equality, and the betterment of Israel and the world. There are currently kenim in Toronto, northern New Jersey (Tenafly), central New Jersey (East Brunswick), New York City, Washington D.C., and Philadelphia. The United States is currently in the process of recreating kenim in Westchester, NY and Albany, NY. Hashomer Hatzair has collaborated with Habonim Dror and other left-wing Zionist groups to form the Union of Progressive Zionists campus network. In October 2011, Hashomer Hatzair participated in Occupy Toronto and built a sukkah at the site of the protest.  Chile  The Chilean branch of Hashomer Hatzair was founded more than 60 years ago and it continues educating young Jewish Chileans with the values of social justice, fraternity, Judaism and love for Israel. Currently there are 50–100 members aged 9–22 who meet every Saturday in the Ken located in Santiago. These are young chaverim that self organize and most of them do not belong to any Jewish collectivity or entity, thus most of them will have no link to anything Jewish if it wasn't for the tnua. For further info, visit the up-to-date website in Spanish. France In France, the youth movement spells Hachomer Hatzaïr with a \\"c\\". It was founded in Paris in Belleville area, in 1933, by Jews from Poland and Tunisia. The French branch now has about 500 members in two kenim, in Paris and Lyon. The khanikhim (children) (literally, \\"students\\") and Bogrim (organizers) (literally, \\"adults\\") meet weekly in groups and run 3 makhanot (\\"Resorts & Leisure\\") (literally, \\"camps\\") in November (or late October), around the end of December, and for 3 weeks in July. The French movement has 3 branches:See http://www.hachomerhatzair.com/#!vstc1=page-2/vstc0=la-structure- hh .

An educational branch, a political arm, and an \\"emsheh\\" branch. Germany Hashomer Hatzair Germany (German: Haschomer Hatzair Deutschland) is a registered association (Eingetragener Verein), that is operating Ken Berlin. The Jewish youth movement was re-established in 2012 for the first time since it was prohibited during the Second World War and the Holocaust. The movement was active in several cities in Germany until 1939. Since its reopening, Hashomer Hatzair Germany has assembled a community of members to bring the youth movement values and passion back to Berlin. Hungary Hashomer Hatzair has been re-established in 1989 in Budapest. Today it's one of the largest Zionist youth movements in Hungary. HH Hungary organizes two camps every year and also offers various programs for Jewish youngsters: bringing charity to Hungarian Holocaust Survivors, cleaning out Jewish cemeteries in the countryside etc. Hashomer Hatzair has approximately 50 members nowadays in Budapest. Hashomer Hatzair was the first Jewish youth movement to be re-established in Hungary after the fall of Communism (1989). Israel Today, the movement has around 80 kens all over Israel. A Knesset report in 2010 stated that there were around 7,000 official members, making Hashomer Hatzair the fifth largest youth movement in Israel by members.https://fs.knesset.gov.il/globaldocs/MMM/1abf8d55-f7f7-e411-80c8-00155d010977/2_1abf8d55-f7f7-e411-80c8-00155d010977_11_7041.pdf, \\"Youth Movements in Israel\\", 2010 The main actions of the movement are regular activities for youth ages 9–18, education for the tnua values and social actions. Every year the movement has a conference for the whole \\"Gub\\" (Guf Boger, the members who guide in the kens, ages 15–18) to discuss the yearly topic that is related to the Israeli society, the kenim and the movement. At the end of the conference the members formulate the results of the discussions for charta that represent the position of the tnua. Examples for topics: Zionism with peace, equality between genders, Socialism, Judaism in Hashomer Hatzair etc. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the Hashomer Hatzair Workers Party merged with other left wing parties to form Mapam, which became the political party of both the youth movement and the Kibbutz Artzi federation. In Israel it was traditionally aligned with Mapam and later Meretz. It is not officially aligned with Meretz. After a recent merger of the Meretz-aligned Kibbutz Artzi Federation with the Labour Party's United Kibbutz Movement, Hashomer Hatzair is officially not aligned with either party, though by tradition, it is close in outlook to Meretz.  Italy  Hashomer Hatzair operates four kens (branches) in Italy—in Rome, Milan, Florence, and Turin. Local members organize two camps per year. The Italian movement can count on about 400 members.  Mexico  The Mexican branch of Hashomer Hatzair was established in 1940. Since 1983, its \\"ken\\" (Hebrew for \\"nest\\", i.e., its headquarters), named after Mordechai Anielewicz, is currently located in the Polanco neighbourhood, western part of Mexico City. Hashomer Hatzair Mexico was founded by Avner Aliphas, a Hebrew professor at the Yiddish school of Mexico and later founder of the \\"Tarbut\\" Jewish day school in 1942. Aliphas was born in Kolno, Poland, in 1911, and made aliyah (immigrated to Eretz Israel) in 1936 to join Kibbutz Negba, and in 1938 he helped establish Kibbutz Hanita. In 1939 he returned to Kolno after his mother died and luckily got out before the Nazi invasion to attend a Zionist conference in Paris. When the war broke out and he could not go back to Israel, he traveled to Mexico where he became active in the Zionist movement. In 1940, supported by the Zionist Organization in Mexico, Aliphas founded Hashomer Hatzair in Mexico, thus giving an option for young people who had been educated towards Zionism at home. This was the first Jewish youth movement that existed in the country; its first Ken was in Tacuba 15, in the city center. During the next decades, Hashomer Hatzair was one of the places for secular socialization for the Jewish community. As of the present day, the Mexican branch of Hashomer Hatzair comprises approximately fifty members who regularly attend cultural, educational and sporting events as a group.  Uruguay  Hashomer Hatzair has existed in Uruguay since 1946. In its early stages, there were two different kinim but now there is only one in the centre of the city, consisting of two kvutzot of younger children (ages 6 to 7 and 8 to 10) and another two of older kids (11 to 13 and 14 to 16). The ken is called Ken Mordejai Anilevich and is in the capital city of Montevideo in the neightboard of Pocitos  Netherlands  Hashomer Hatzair is active in the Netherlands from the 1950s. Until somewhere in the 1970s there were kenim in Rotterdam and Amsterdam. A ken in Maastricht has been active since around the year 2000. The ken has two kvutzot of older and younger kids (9-12 and 5-8). Ken Maastricht has been part of the World Movement since 2011.  Switzerland  In Switzerland, Ken Yitzhak Rabin in Zürich consists of some 100 hanihim, meeting on Shabbat afternoon and for two or three camps (annually in autumn and winter, bi-annually in summer), next to the Bogrim's bi-annual trips to Israel or Poland. Special events are held for Pessach, Chanuka and the Yitzhak Rabin memorial. The Ken was founded in 1935 and joined World Hashomer in 1938. During the 2nd world war, there were five major Kenim (Zurich, Basel, Berne, Biel, Geneva) plus activities in a few smaller cities and in the refugee centers. Swiss Shomer members having made aliya can be encountered e.g. in Lehavot Habashan and Magen. the Shomer was the largest Jewish youth movement in Switzerland.  Venezuela  Logo de los 60 años del Ken Najshon, fundado en 1955 por Tamar Campo Hashomer Hatzair in Venezuela was founded in 1954 in Caracas, coming through Tamar Campo, an immigrant girl from Cuba, who began doing educational activities in September 1954 for young Jews of Venezuela, during the Rosh Hashana festivities. The name is Ken Najshon, inspired like the prince of the tribe of Judah, who led the Jewish people out of Egypt across the waters opened by Moses . Today the Ken Najshon continues educating young's in the Jewish community of Venezuela, every Saturday at the Hebraica club by peulot where they teach about Zionism, socialism and humanistic Judaism and are taught values of equality, social justice and brotherhood through non-formal education. Life Movement (Tnuat Bogrim / Kidmah / Kidma / Kidmat Anilewicz) Around the world, Hashomer Hatzair members have founded a life movement to pick up where the youth movement leaves off. Groups have been organized in Israel by Israelis and non-Israelis, and others were formed in their countries of origin (such as in Canada, the United States, Switzerland and Hungary).  Canada and the United States  The Life Movement in the United States and Canada has created three urban communes, one in New York and two in Toronto where members are experimenting with the Israeli model of communot in their home societies. In addition, a new winter trip to Israel for Bogrim called Mifgash takes place yearly.

She served as leader of the Israeli Labor Party between 2011 and 2013. Before entering politics, she was a journalist, an author, and a television and radio commentator. Early life Yachimovich was born in Kfar Saba. Her father, Moshe, was a construction worker and her mother, Hanna, a teacher.Official website Both parents were Holocaust survivors who immigrated to Israel from Poland. She became politically engaged at an early age, and was expelled from Ostrovsky high school in Ra'anana at age 15 for hanging up posters denouncing the principal's style of leadership. She was conscripted in 1978, and in 1985, Yachimovich graduated from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev with a degree in behavioural science. Journalism and media career Yachimovich on a bicycle in the streets of Tel Aviv, 2011 While studying in Beersheba, she worked as a correspondent for the Al HaMishmar newspaper. She went on to become an anchor for the Israel Broadcasting Authority's radio station Reshet Bet, earning a reputation as opinionated and critical of conventional wisdom and the establishment. She has also been described as an assertive, abrasive radio journalist with very pronounced feminist and social-democratic views. As a journalist, she covered women's and social welfare issues. In October 2000, following a work dispute, she left her radio job and joined Channel 2 TV, where she hosted a political talk show and served as a news commentator. She also did a weekly program for Israel Army Radio (Galei Tzahal). Southern Lebanon conflict As a journalist, Yachimovich was credited in giving prominent stage on national radio for activists of Four Mothers advocacy group who campaigned for Israel's withdrawal from Southern Lebanon. The group was established in February 1997 by four mothers who have lost their sons in the Israeli helicopter disaster. The founders formed a pressure group advocating a withdrawal, pointing out the excessive cost in human lives of a continuing Israeli presence in Southern Lebanon. Yachimovich and military affairs journalist Carmela Menashe were the first to give stage to the group's agenda, helping the grass-roots movement strike at the heart of Israeli public debate. The growing discussion over Israel's role in Southern Lebanon eventually led prime minister Ehud Barak to announce a withdrawal plan in 2000, amid vocal criticism over Yachimovich's agenda from military officials. Four Mothers' group leaders later noted that Menashe's and Yachimovich's support was crucial in promoting their goal. Bank Hapoalim layoffs Bank Hapoalim, one of Israel's largest financial institutions, had announced in late 2002 that it was about to cut 10% of its workforce of about 900 employees, many of whom tenured under the bank's employment contract. Criticism of the plan came from the Histadrut labor union, which questioned the necessity of such a massive layoff amidst ILS 1 billion in profits for the bank that year. First filing legal action against the bank via the Tel Aviv District Labor Court, the Histadrut union also went on to embark on a massive public relations campaign against the bank's management. The bank's main shareholder, Israeli businesswoman Shari Arison, one of Israel's wealthiest women, led a press conference to defend the layoffs, on advice from her public relations consultant Rani Rahav. Arison expressed regret for the layoffs, characterizing management's decision as an example of national responsibility. Critics rejected her argument as being poorly constructed, claiming that her remarks only seemed to demonstrate that for the country's wealthiest, national responsibility means profit maximization. Histadrut labor union chairman Amir Peretz, who was facing upcoming Histadrut leadership elections, then led a campaign personally attacking Arison, publishing billboards with the slogan 'Shari Arison laughs, 900 families cry'. Agitated about the slogan, Arison threatened Poster Media, the company that put up the billboards and which was partly owned by Arison, with a $10 million libel suit, successfully halting the campaign. Yachimovich entered the discussion by airing a critical review of Shari Arison's conduct, on her editorial segment in Channel 2 news. She warned that the threats of a lawsuit provided an example of how the rich and successful are able to arrange things to their liking, in this case by firing such a large number of employees and then silencing public criticism of the move. The next day, Arison's consultant Rani Rahav published an assertive open letter attacking Yachimovich, faxing it to 500 of Israel's top CEO's and media personalities. The letter, containing the phrase 'Bad, bad Shelly' multiple times, was described by press as childish. In the letter, Rahav asked Yachimovich to depart Israel, claiming she should be grateful that wealthy people choose to live in Israel, invest in its economy and donate to charitable causes within it. Later that year, when Arison relocated her residence to the United States, Rahav published yet a second open letter titled 'You won, Shelly', blaming Yachimovich in Arison's relocation. Entry to political life On 29 November 2005, two weeks after Amir Peretz was interviewed by Yachimovich on \\"Meet the Press\\" for the occasion of his election as leader of the Labor Party, Yachimovich announced she was leaving journalism and entering politics. She ran in the Labor primaries and achieved the ninth place on the party's list for the 2006 elections, in which she was elected to the Knesset. Shelly Yachimovich at Gay Pride Tel Aviv 2007 Yachimovich was criticized on her sharp move from journalism to politics. Critics noted that it was inappropriate for a watchdog journalist to become a member of the system she was supposed to be guarding. Others alleged that the interview she had with Peretz shortly before joining politics must have lacked professional impartiality, according to journalism ethics. Following criticisms, a cooling-off period of three months was imposed on journalists by Israeli broadcast regulator The Second Authority in late 2005. Yachimovich later claimed on her behalf that she didn't have the slightest idea of joining politics on her mind during that interview. She also declared that she opposes any cooling-off periods on joining politics, arguing that these should instead be imposed on parliamentarians and civil servants who upon leaving the public sphere immediately join high-profile positions in the private sector, exploiting their influence to make private profits. Shelly Yachimovich with activists in 2015 Despite criticisms, her entry to political life was preceded and followed by numerous other Israeli journalists who ran for a Knesset seat, including Nitzan Horowitz, Yair Lapid, Nachman Shai, Uri Orbach, Ofer Shelach and Merav Michaeli. Public debate has continued to question this practice, leading to a failed Knesset bill to be debated in 2010 and again in 2012, proposing a cooling-off period of 6 months for journalists before entering politics. 17th Knesset The 17th Knesset, which span from April 2006 to February 2009, saw the Labor party joining the Kadima-led coalition under prime-minister Ehud Ulmert in the thirty-first government of Israel. Yachimovich was quickly growing critical of Labor's role in the government, as she believed the party was not executing its social-democratic mandate. She also became frustrated of then party leader Peretz, citing his choice to become Minister of Defense over an economically related minister, as a choice that created a personal, ideological and political drift between them. She consequently started to divert from voting along party lines and opposed the 2006 State Budget bill. Responding to criticisms, she justified her stance by claiming that most Knesset members and ministers who voted for the State Budget bill had not actually read it, and had not debated its long term consequences, which she deemed irrational. In the February 2007 party leadership primaries, she endorsed Ehud Barak over Ami Ayalon, pointing out that while she couldn't see the difference between them as both were not representing social-democratic values, Barak still had a better shot at leading the party to electoral victories. She received The Knight of Quality Government award from the Movement for Quality Government in Israel in 2008. The selection committee commemorated her as being one of the very few elected officials who attacks Crony capitalism practices; who consistently supports the Supreme Court and State Comptroller legitimacy and standing; and who voices out for the issues of the less-privileged classes of society. In 2009, Yachimovich leaked an undisclosed version of the forthcoming State Budget bill's Arrangements Act, the traditional addendum to the yearly budget, on her website and invited ordinary citizens to provide comments on its contents. She also released a detailed criticism of many of the State Budget's proposals, mainly in regard to proposed cutbacks to governmental services. The publication of the complete document, which under normal circumstances is being kept under the strictest secrecy in the Ministry of Finance and only distributed in small portions to selected officials, has been described as explosive, and an unprecedented event in the bill's history. As a result of the leak, the Bill came under public scrutiny and was susceptible to a wide debate in the Knesset and over the media, eventually causing the Ministry of Finance to withdraw some of its proposals for budget cutbacks. Furthermore, the case brought into question the Arrangements Act's objectives, with critics noting it bypasses the Knesset by essentially cancelling out previous legislation in a swipe of hand. Legislation Yachimovich legislated and participated in legislating 17 laws during term. Among the more prominent ones are: *The Wages Protection law (24th amendment): Payslips. :The amendment was put in force to make it easier for employees to detect ill labour practices. It made it illegal for employers not to provide a monthly payslip detailing the data on which employees' salary was based. The amendment required employers to keep a detailed track of employees' work and make it transparent to the latter. Payslips should state data such as employees' base salary, social benefits, overtime hours, vacation days, sick days, and the eventual hourly wage. The amendment also required employers to keep track of employees attendance for the first time, targeting the protection of employees working long hours in Law, Audit and Hi-tech firms. Following the legislation, many employers from those sectors feared their employees would notice that they aren't making the national minimum hourly wage, when taking into account their fixed salaries versus the excessively long work hours common in those industries. *The Right to Sit While Working law. :The law aimed at stopping a common practice in many grocery stores and drug stores where cashiers were asked to work the tills while standing for the entire shift, although there was no practical reason for them not to sit. Labor rights organizations backed the law by claiming that the practice was insulting and disrespectful, while large chain-store retailer Super-Pharm fiercely lobbied against the law, arguing it should reserve the right to serve customers the way it sees fit. The law recognized the right to sit while working, and forced employers to provide chairs for the cashiers, salespersons and service workers unless employers could prove that the job at hand could not have been carried out from a sitting position. *The Knesset law (25th amendment): Regulating Lobbyists' Activity. :The amendment enforced the first ever regulation over lobbyists' activity in the Knesset, aiming at better transparency and accountability over the decision making process. It required lobbyists traipsing through the Knesset to wear orange ribbons identifying them as such. As press alleged that there hardly exists any legislative process in which lobbyists don't get involved in some way, the amendment aimed at identifying the varying interests and funding behind Lobby activity. The amendment gained public attention shortly afterwards, when journalist Ilana Dayan revealed on her investigative show Uvda (\\"Fact\\") a candid camera footage, showing employees of Gilad Government Relations lobbying firm brag about influencing legislation to promote business interests. The amendment allowed Speaker of the Knesset Ruby Rivlin to identify the lobbying firm's employees and bar them from further entering the Knesset.

Shortly afterwards, she came out vocally against party leader Ehud Barak for negotiating a place for Labor in the Likud-led coalition of the thirty-second government of Israel. Believing that Labor would act as a dead weight on Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing government, she opposed joining the coalition and warned that Labor would serve as a fig leaf for right-winged governmental agenda. The debate escalated to Yachimovich and six other Labor MK's being named as 'Labor rebels', who formed an anti-Barak alliance and restrained from voting along party lines, although officially being part Netanyahu's government. Trying to appease her, Barak offered Yachimovich an appointment as the Minister of Industry, Trade and Labor in the upcoming government. She refused the offer despite admitting it was a post she was aiming at, and continued opposing Labor's part in the government, up until early 2011 when Barak diverted from the party and the remaining MK's agreed on leaving the government. During the 18th Knesset, Yachimovich continued to lead Knesset in passing legislation, and was referred to as a diligent parliamentarian. She has been described as a staunch social-democrat, highly critical and belligerent, who does not hesitate to take on fat cats and the lobbyists who represent them. She has been described as using unorthodox politics, with critics noting she managed to aggravate both economic right and dovish left with her stances. After Ehud Barak left the Labor Party to form Independence in January 2011, a poll found that Yachimovich was the most popular of the likely candidates for leadership of the Labor Party. On 3 March 2011 Yachimovich declared her candidacy for party leadership and sought to sign up new members for the party. By the time the membership drive ended on 6 June, Yachimovich, according to estimates, had signed up more than 17,300 new members. A month prior to primary elections, an interview Yachimovich gave for a Haaretz feature article drew fierce critique from both wings of the political spectrum, and became one of her most highly referred to interviews. She stated that she does \\"not see the settlement project as a sin and a crime\\", since it was originally based on a widespread consensus that included the Labor Party. She argued that the Israeli Left is locked in a false paradigm that is portraying the Settlement project as responsible for the erosion of the welfare state, while actually the shortage of resources to relieve social injustices was a direct result of Benjamin Netanyahu's economic agenda. She concluded that Labor should first and foremost represent a social- democratic agenda, ahead of a Dovish agenda, and maintained that poverty, ignorance and broad social disparities should be tackled first since they tend to formulate a common ethos towards war. Left wing commentators slashed her the following days as being a representative of the 'fake Left', as well as using populist stances to approach a more centrally and Hawkish leaning audience. Others argued that her order of priorities was flawed, noting that social justice within Israel can't be achieved without peace with its neighbors. The issue became pivotal to the upcoming primary elections, with fractions of the party forming to attack or defend her over those remarks. Despite criticism, she reiterated her opinion on the matter in several following instances, arguing that her only sin is that she does not adhere to the 'Post-Zionist order'. In the leadership primary elections, held on 12 September Yachimovich came in first among the four contenders, defeating Peretz by a slim margin of 32% to 31%. Since the Labor party constitution requires a minimum of 40% of the votes for a first-round decision, a run-off was held on 21 September resulting in a 54% to 46% victory (a margin of slightly more than 3,500 votes) over Peretz. In the early hours of 22 September, Yachimovich was officially declared leader of the Labor Party at party headquarters, the second woman to hold that position after Golda Meir. Following the announcement on the formation of a unity government on 8 May 2012 and Kadima's departure from the opposition, the Labor Party became the largest party in the opposition. As such, Yachimovich was nominated unopposed as Leader of the Opposition. She held this post for 70 days, until Kadima left the government and became the largest opposition party once again. Legislation Yachimovich legislated and participated in legislating 28 laws during term. Among the more prominent ones are: *Layoffs Severance Package Law (25th amendment): Recurring Layoffs Prevention :The amendment established that any interruption of employer-worker relations of less than three months does not terminate seniority rights. The amendment shut a loop- hole in the employment law of low wage labor in cleaning, security and catering services, as well as other low paid professions commonly outsourced to sub-contractor umbrella companies, in which employees had been fired and immediately re-hired once a year to exempt employers from providing seniority rights. This common practice created many low wage employees who, despite working for the same employer for years, were restricted from seniority benefits such as expanded pension provisions as entitled by Israeli labor laws. Responding to national and international criticism of Israel's excessively prevalent Working Poor class, and to the 2011 social protests, the amendment empowered Israel's major labor union, the Histadrut, to take action to improve labor conditions for those employees. *Work and Leisure Hours Law (13th amendment): The Right to Take a Break For Using the Toilets, Employer's Responsibility Not to Deduct the Break From Salary, And Its Responsibility to Construct Decent Lavatory Facilities. :The 'toilets law' came to force after cashiers of some retail chain-stores complained that they were implicitly restricted from leaving tills to use the toilets throughout their shifts, lasting up to nine consecutive hours. This has resulted in employees refraining from consuming fluids and exposure to related health risks. Legislators harshly criticized the practice and noted that \\"the existence of such a situation in the State of Israel in 2008 is unthinkable, and workplaces must not be allowed to revoke employees' basic rights as human beings\\". *Prohibition of Discrimination in Products, Services and Entry into Places of Entertainment and Public Places Law (2nd amendment): Prohibition of Discrimination, Selection and Infinite Delay at Entrance to Public Places. :The amendment was suggested after an instance of documented discrimination against a dark-skinned youth received wide media attention in 2010. A dark- skinned Golani Brigade soldier was denied entry to a night club due to an undisclosed selection policy, while his white-skinned friends were let in without hassles. The case brought into question the selection practices of some entertainment venues in Israel, which were claimed to include de facto discrimination against minorities while circumventing anti-discrimination laws. As the amendment was designed to specifically tackle such practices, legal sources expressed their view that it will strengthen anti-discriminatory norms and will make it easier to prosecute club-owners who violate the law.

Family and personal life Yachimovich at her apartment in Tel Aviv, 2011 She lives in Kerem HaTeimanim neighborhood in central Tel Aviv with her two children, Gal and Rama, in a 78 square meters apartment. A feminist, Yachimovich reportedly refused to marry under the rabbinate religious authority. After getting divorced, she maintains good relations with her ex-husband, Noam Ziv, to whom she dedicated her last book. She published her apartment's worth, her mortgage loan worth and previous income figures, in order to promote increased transparency of elected officials' interests. Claiming she has nothing to hide, Yachimovich challenged all Members of Knesset to publish their own financial standing. Besides her native language, Hebrew, she speaks English and Polish.https://knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mk_eng.asp?mk_individual_id_t=782 Yachimovich is an atheist. On Judaism, she says \\"My Judaism is one of identity: I am part of a family and part of a people with a shared fate, history, culture and customs. My extended (ultra-Orthodox) family was destroyed in the Holocaust and my parents who survived were angry at God and felt betrayed. Paradoxically, even though I have a much more conciliatory attitude and harbor no resentment toward religion, and feel connected to the sources on the social level – their anger contained much greater faith. To be totally honest, I turn to God in times of trouble, just in case. He helps, and then like an ingrate, I return to my secularism.\\" See also * List of Israeli politicians ReferencesExternal links A series of articles authored by Shelly Yachimovich from 2006-12-25 to date, TheMarker (retrieved 2012-10-10) Category:1960 births Category:21st-century women politicians Category:Ben-Gurion University of the Negev alumni Category:Jewish feminists Category:Jewish Israeli politicians Category:Jewish novelists Category:Jewish women writers Category:Israeli feminists Category:Israeli novelists Category:Israeli people of Polish-Jewish descent Category:Israeli political writers Category:Israeli radio journalists Category:Israeli television journalists Category:Israeli women journalists Category:Israeli women novelists Category:Israeli women's rights activists Category:Israeli Labor Party leaders Category:LGBT rights activists from Israel Category:Living people Category:Members of the 17th Knesset (2006–2009) Category:Members of the 18th Knesset (2009–2013) Category:Members of the 19th Knesset (2013–2015) Category:Members of the 20th Knesset (2015–2019) Category:Members of the 21st Knesset (2019) Category:People from Kfar Saba Category:People from Ramat HaSharon Category:People from Tel Aviv Category:Women Members of the Knesset Category:Women opposition leaders Category:Zionist Union politicians Category:Women television journalists Category:Women radio journalists ","title":"Shelly Yachimovich"},{"id":"40949083","text":"Ensign P.

It does not 'guide' them, as it can only be determined after the event and is thus inaccessible to forward planning. Unlike individual labour hours in the classical labour theory of value formulated by Adam Smith and David Ricardo, Marx's exchange value is conceived as a proportion (or 'aliquot part') of society's labour-time. Marx did not define this concept in computationally rigorous terms, allowing for flexibility in using it in specific instances to relate average levels of labour productivity to social needs manifesting themselves as monetarily effective market demand for commodities. In addition, although it is axiomatic that socially necessary labour input determines commodity values, precise numerical calculation of such an input in relation to the value of a given commodity, i.e. the empirical regulation of the values of different types of commodities, is exceedingly difficult, due to incessantly shifting social, physical or technical circumstances affecting the labour process. Simplified explanation of the concept In a market economy, labour expenditures producing outputs and the market demand for those outputs are constantly adjusting to each other. This is a complex process, in which enterprises operating at varying levels of productivity and unit-costs compete with each other in responding to the expansion and contraction of total market demand for their output. In the third volume of Das Kapital, Marx discusses how the market value (or \\"regulating price\\") of a commodity may be determined under different conditions of demand and productivity. A given mass of new value is produced in a given time, but if and how this new value is realised in money terms and distributed as income and reinvestment is finally established only after products are sold at specific market prices. If the market for a commodity is oversupplied, then labour-time has been expended in excess of what was socially necessary, and exchange value falls. If the market for a commodity is undersupplied, then the labour-time expended on its production has been less than what is socially necessary, and exchange value rises. The simplest definition of socially necessary labour time is the amount of labour time performed by a worker of average skill and productivity, working with tools of the average productive potential, to produce a given commodity. This is an \\"average unit labour-cost\\", measured in working hours. If the average productivity is that of a worker who produces a commodity in one hour, while a less skilled worker produces the same commodity in four hours, then in these four hours the less skilled worker will have only contributed one hour's worth of value in terms of socially necessary labour time. Each hour worked by the unskilled worker will only produce a quarter of the social value produced by the average worker. But the production of any commodity generally requires both labour and some previously produced means of production (or capital goods), like tools and materials. The amount of labour so required is called the direct labour input into the commodity. Yet the required capital goods have in their turn been produced (in the past) by labour and other capital goods; and so on for these other capital goods, and so on. The sum of all the amounts of labour, that were direct inputs into this backwards-stretching series of capital goods produced in the past, is called the indirect labour input into the commodity. Putting together the direct and indirect labour inputs, one finally gets the total labour input into the commodity, which may also be called the total embodied labour in it, or its direct and indirect labour contents. However, by \\"socially necessary labour\\" Marx refers specifically to the total labour-time which on average is currently required to produce an output. It is this current labour cost which determines the value of output. So in a developed market Marx's exchange value refers to the average quantity of living labour which must be performed under currently prevailing conditions to produce a commodity. These conditions are incessantly changing, both in relation to quality of labour, quality of machinery, quality of distribution, and volumes of labour, machinery, sales in the branch, so estimating 'current' requirements is very much an exercise in approximation and dependent on the scales involved. Operation of the law of value If producers produce commodities below the socially average labour- cost, they obtain extra profit upon sale at the ruling market prices, and conversely those producing at above this cost make a proportionate loss. A constant incentive therefore exists to reduce labour-costs by increasing the productivity of the labour force. This can be done through higher exploitation, economising on costs, and better equipment. The long-run effect is that it takes less and less labour-time to produce a commodity. Enterprises cannot usually do very much about reducing their fixed input costs, because these are rarely under their control. But they can always try to reduce their labour costs. \\"Socially necessary labour\\" therefore refers to at least three economic relationships: * between the specific productivity of a producer and the average productivity in his branch; * between the outputs of the branch of production and social needs manifested in monetarily effective demand; and * between the output of a producer, and the output of the whole branch (that can be sold). In other words, we have to distinguish between * labour time necessary for the production of a given amount of a commodity—this quantity defines the aggregate value of the output, arising from the nature of a commodity as a bearer of exchange-value; * the quantity of labour time socially necessary to produce the appropriate amount of the product, i.e. the amount of a product which at the production price meets the effective demand for it—this quantity defines the correspondence between the total quantity of the commodity produced as use-values and the effective demand for those use- values. The former determines the unit value of commodities, hence their production price, and the latter determines the discrepancy between actual supply and effective demand, hence the discrepancy between market price and production price. Marx and Ricardo Marxist value theory treats economic value, i.e. exchange value, as an attribute of labour-products/commodities which exists by virtue of social relations of production in the capitalist mode of production. Thus, value is a purely social characteristic of commodities. The substance of the value of a commodity is a determinate quantity of social labour. That is, the existence of exchange value presupposes social relations between people organised into a society. 'Socially necessary labour time' encapsulates this essential 'relatedness' of value—it is labour time assessed in relation to social needs, not merely labour time performed. This distinction demarcates Marx from other political economists, but is often overlooked in accounts of Marx's value theory. Marx understood that the casual reader might mistakenly treat his category as interchangeable with its Ricardian predecessor, and in later editions and the Afterword to the Second German Edition implores readers to pay particular attention to the mediations between that old category and the one his own theory sought to establish. Marx's concept of value is not intended to be an equilibrium price. He does not assume market equilibrium, but aims to explain how the process of convergence between supply and demand practically occurs, that is, why supply and demand meet at a given price point when a sale is realised in a specific market. Criticism Marx's interpretation of value from the perspective of society as whole proved elusive for many critics. Marx tried to answer them, in a letter to a friend, Dr. Louis Kugelmann: \\"All that palaver about the necessity of proving the concept of value comes from complete ignorance both of the subject dealt with and of scientific method. Every child knows that a nation which ceased to work, I will not say for a year, but even for a week, would perish. Every child knows, too, that the masses of products corresponding to different needs require different and quantitatively determined masses of the total labour of society. That this necessity of the distribution of social labour in definite proportions cannot possibly be done away with by a particular form of social production but can only change the mode of its appearance, is self-evident. No natural laws can be done away with. What can change in historically different circumstances is only the form in which these laws assert themselves. And the form in which this proportional distribution of labour asserts itself, in a state of society where the interconnection of social labour is manifested in the private exchange of the individual products of labour, is precisely the exchange value of these products. \\"Where science comes in is to show how the law of value asserts itself.\\"Marx, letter to Dr Kugelmann, July 11, 1868, in Marx/Engels Selected Correspondence, p. 251-252 Despite these comments, Marx has been criticised strongly for adding the \\"socially necessary\\" qualification to labour time by the libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick in Anarchy, State and Utopia, for whom it is an unjustified 'bolt-on' aspect of Marx's theory. “Chapter 8: Equality, Envy, Exploitation, Etc.” Anarchy, State, and Utopia, by Robert Nozick, Basic Books, 2013, p. 258–260 One debate in Marxian economics concerns the question of whether the product-values formed and traded include both direct and indirect labour, or whether these product-values refer only to current average production costs (or the value of current average replacement costs). Mirowski (1989) for example accuses Marx of vacillating between a field theory (labour-time currently socially necessary) and a substance theory of value (embodied labour-time). This kind of criticism is due to a confusion of the process of labour in general (adding use to a product, which under capitalism equates adding value to a commodity) with the task of quantifying the exchange value added. The general process affixes labour time to a commodity, and providing the commodity functions as such the quantity of labour time is immaterial—an abstract unknown, so to speak—and can be expressed in many ways, e.g. \\"embodied in\\", \\"attached to\\", \\"associated with\\", etc. Quantifying the amount of labour time associated with commodities requires focus on the social, shifting character of socially necessary labour, and specifically recognition that the quantities are 'current' i.e. incessantly changing. Today's value is different from yesterday's and tomorrow's, and the amount of value can only be determined numerically on the basis of a given point in time at which values are realized simultaneously at specific prices. Thus Marx's theory is best interpreted as a field theory, but for the reasons just stated, modelling the determination of value by socially necessary labour time mathematically is a difficult exercise if not probably impossible.

It was an attempt by the international community to revive the Israeli–Palestinian peace process through negotiations, involving Israel and the Palestinians as well as Arab countries, including Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. On 3 November, the conference was followed by bilateral negotiations between Israel and respectively the joint Jordanian- Palestinian delegation, Lebanon and Syria. Subsequent bilateral meetings took place in Washington from 9 December 1991. On 28 January 1992, multilateral negotiations about regional cooperation were started in Moscow, attended by Israel, the Jordanian-Palestinian delegation and the international community, but without Lebanon and Syria.  Background  As early as 22 May 1989, US Secretary of State James Baker stated to an AIPAC audience that Israel should abandon its expansionist policies; this remark took many as a signal that the pro-Israel Reagan years were over. After the Gulf War on 6 March 1991, President George H.W. Bush addressed Congress in a speech often cited as the Bush administration’s principal policy statement on the new order in the Middle East following the expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.Michael Oren, Power, Faith and Fantasy, p569 In addition to maintaining a permanent U.S. naval presence in the Gulf, providing funds for Middle East development, and instituting safeguards against the spread of unconventional weapons, Michael Oren notes \\"The centerpiece of his program, however, was the achievement of an Arab-Israeli treaty based on the territory-for-peace principle and the fulfillment of Palestinian rights.\\"  Preparations  As a first step Bush announced his intention to reconvene the international peace conference in Madrid. The Bush administration believed there was a window of opportunity to use the political capital generated by the U.S. victory in the Gulf War to revitalize the Arab-Israeli peace process. This peace initiative focused on convening a multi-party international conference that would then break into separate, bilateral and multilateral negotiating tracks. U.S. Secretary of State James Baker made eight diplomatic visits to the region to get support for the conference. A framework of objectives was formulated and the U.S., together with the Soviet Union, extended a letter of invitation, dated 30 October 1991 to Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the Palestinians.The Madrid Peace Conference. MidEastWeb, 30 October 1991  Loan guarantees and the settlements issue  Although \\"check-book diplomacy\\" had been used in the past to move the peace process, as at the Camp David Accords, President Bush and Secretary Baker felt the coalition victory and increased U.S. prestige would itself induce a new Arab-Israeli dialogue, but also because their diplomatic initiative focused on process and procedure rather than on specific agreements and concessions. From Washington's perspective, economic inducements would not be necessary, but in May, these entered the process with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's request for $11 billion in U.S. loan guarantees, to help absorb immigrants on humanitarian grounds. This request however, added a new dimension to U.S. diplomacy and sparked a political showdown between Shamir's Likud government and the Bush administration.Scott Lasensky, Underwriting Peace in the Middle East: U.S. Foreign policy and the Limites of Economic Inducements, Middle East Review of International Affairs, Vol. 6, No. 1, March 2002. Secretary Baker made frequent shuttle trips to the region between March and October 1991 in an attempt to find a procedural formula acceptable to all sides. He did not have an easy time finding the right formula to convene the conference, particularly on the issue of Palestinian representation. In light of Shamir's pro-settlement policy, Palestinians and many Arab governments viewed the request for Israeli loan guarantees as a test of America's credibility as mediator. In addition to Arab opposition, the Bush administration had its own problems with the request, because there was residual ill-will following Israel's refusal to verify whether the previous (October 1990) $400 million loan guarantee was used for settlement expansion; the administration did not see populating settlements as a humanitarian issue. Throughout the run-up to the Madrid conference, Israel's loan guarantee request remained a sore point. By early September 1991, the Administration asked Congress for a 120-day delay on the loan guarantees. This postponement was seen as a way to get to Madrid, to buy time, and to soften the domestic debate. If a settlement freeze could not be obtained from Israel, Bush and Baker wanted the issue off the agenda. \\"[The United States] must do everything we can to give peace a chance,\\" Bush said in requesting the delay from Congress. Israeli leaders opposed linking the loans to the political process; Shamir and the pro-Israel lobby in Washington decided to push forward with their request despite Bush's opposition. Israel and its supporters in Washington began a campaign to support the loan request, but Bush, with a 70 percent job approval rating, would not back down. By mid-September, U.S.-Israel relations were tense; pro-Israel groups challenged the president and lobbied against the delay. Shamir had originally believed he could outflank Bush and Baker and turn to U.S. public opinion and the pro-Israel lobby. However, the U.S. Jewish community—though visibly mobilized on this issue—was not united in taking on the Administration, and Shamir soon backed away from a direct confrontation. With Bush's approval ratings high, and his unambiguous show of determination and will, he gained congressional support for the delay; following that, the diplomatic pieces soon fell into place and the parties convened in Madrid at the end of October. The conference President George H. W. Bush addresses the Middle East Peace Conference at the Royal Palace in Madrid, Spain. The Palestinian team was part of a joint Palestinian-Jordanian delegation and consisted of Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza. It was formally without overt PLO associates like Saeb Erekat and Haidar Abdel-Shafi, the head of the delegation, because of Israeli objections. Before the conference, Israel had threatened not to come if PLO representatives, or someone from outside the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, or someone from East Jerusalem would be part of the Palestinian delegation. However, the delegation was in constant communication with the PLO leadership in Tunis. Over Israeli objections, the PLO dispatched an unofficial \\"advisory delegation,\\" headed by Faisal Husseini to act as a liaison.Palestinian Says His Delegation Will Assert P.L.O. Ties at Talks. Clyde Haberman, The New York Times, 22 October 1991 During the conference, PLO figures were present backstage to instruct the Palestinian delegation.Preamble: Madrid Conference. PNA, archived on 19 December 2003 The purpose of the conference was to serve as an opening forum for the participants and had no power to impose solutions or veto agreements. It inaugurated negotiations on both bilateral and multilateral tracks that also involved the international community. The Syrian and Lebanese negotiators agreed on a common strategy. It was the last conference held with both the USSR and US present; the USSR collapsed later that year in December 1991.  Following bilateral and multilateral negotiations  The Madrid Conference was followed by two parallel tracks of negotiations. The bilateral track was aimed at achieving peace treaties between Israel and its three neighbor states Jordan, Lebanon and Syria as well as with the Palestinians. The multilateral track was about the shared regional issues water, environment, arms control, refugees and economic development.The Madrid Framework. Israel MFA, 28 January 1999  Bilateral negotiations  Four separate sets of bilateral negotiations started on 3 November 1991, right after the formal conference ended. Twelve meetings in Washington followed. The first one on 9 December 1991; the last one on 24 January 1994, four months after the conclusion of the Oslo I Accord. The bilateral Israeli-Palestinian negotiations did not go well under the Shamir government. The Madrid negotiations were later upstaged and eventually replaced by, initially secret, negotiations following the 1992 Israeli election, during which Rabin and Labor pledged to end Shamir's settlement policy and reformulate national priorities.  Multilateral negotiations  The multilateral negotiations were scheduled two weeks after the opening of the conference, but the first meeting in Moscow took place only on 28–29 January 1992.The Palestinian delegation opening statement to the multilateral talks. Israel MFA, 28 January 1992 The meetings were held in five separate forums each focusing on a major issue - water, environment, arms control, refugees or economic development. The European Union took part in the meetings. The meetings took place between September 1992 and November 1993. The first round took place in May 1992. Israel boycotted the groups on refugees and economic development, because Palestinians from outside the West Bank and Gaza were present. Syria and Lebanon refused to take part in multilateral meetings as long as there was no concrete progress on the bilateral level. Formal talks in the multilateral track, which had been frozen for several years, resumed on 31 January 2000, with a meeting of the Steering Committee in Moscow, to be followed by meetings of the working groups. After this round, however, the formal talks were stalled.The Multilateral Negotiations. Israel MFA, 19 November 2007  The impact of the Madrid Peace Conference  In the negotiations leading to Madrid, Israel made revocation of UN Resolution 3379 a condition of its participation in the conference; this was accomplished shortly thereafter, with the passage of Resolution 46/86, on 16 December 1991.260 General Assembly Resolution 46-86- Revocation of Resolution 3379- 16 December 1991- and statement by President Herzog, 16 December 1991, Vols 11-12: 1988–1992 and statement by President Herzog , Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. Israel also cites, as a major benefit of the conference and the peace process, the greatly increased number of countries which recognize and have some degree of diplomatic relations with it – nearly doubling – in particular citing the major powers of China and India and some even in the Arab world, like Oman, Qatar, Tunisia, Morocco and Mauritania, along with the decline of the Arab boycott and economic relations with some of the Arab countries. In The Palestine-Israel Conflict: A Basic Introduction, Gregory Harms and Todd Ferry argue that ‘the symbolic significance of the Madrid conference far outweighed its accomplishments, which were thin indeed.’ Harms, G., Ferry, T. (2005), The Palestine-Israel Conflict: A Basic Introduction, Canada: Pluto Press, p. 153. Nevertheless, an example had been made and a future model had been laid down, as the Madrid conference represents the first time all these countries had been gathered \\"face-to-face\\". At the end of the Madrid conference all participating countries appeared hopeful that the conference had resulted in a future road-map for reconciliation. The closing remarks presented below illustrate this hopeful sentiment: > Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, 1 November 1991 > \\"With an open heart, we call on the Arab leaders to take the courageous > step and respond to our outstretched hand in peace\\"The Madrid Peace > Conference, Journal of Palestine Studies, Vol. 21, No. 2 (Winter 1992), p. > 144. > Head of the Palestinian Delegation, Haydar Abd al-Shafi, 1 November 1991 > \\"To the cosponsors and to the international community that seeks the > achievement of a just peace in the Middle East, you have given us a fair > hearing. You cared enough to listen and for that we thank you. Thank > you.\\"The Madrid Peace Conference Journal of Palestine Studies, Vol. 21, No. > 2 (Winter 1992), p. 146. The bilateral Israeli–Palestinian negotiations eventually led to the exchange of letters and the subsequent signing of the Oslo I Accord, on the lawn of the White House on 13 September 1993. The Israel-Jordan negotiations that emanated from the Madrid conference, led to a peace treaty in 1994. The Israeli–Syrian negotiations included series of follow-on meetings, which according to some reports, came quite close, but failed to result in a peace treaty.

The concept originated in Ricardian socialism, with the term \\"surplus value\\" itself being coined by William Thompson in 1824; however, it was not consistently distinguished from the related concepts of surplus labor and surplus product. The concept was subsequently developed and popularized by Karl Marx. Marx's formulation is the standard sense and the primary basis for further developments, though how much of Marx's concept is original and distinct from the Ricardian concept is disputed (see ). Marx's term is the German word \\"Mehrwert\\", which simply means value added (sales revenue less the cost of materials used up), and is cognate to English \\"more worth\\". It is a central concept in Karl Marx's critique of political economy. Conventionally, value- added is equal to the sum of gross wage income and gross profit income. However, Marx uses the term Mehrwert to describe the yield, profit or return on production capital invested, i.e. the amount of the increase in the value of capital. Hence, Marx's use of Mehrwert has always been translated as \\"surplus value\\", distinguishing it from \\"value-added\\". According to Marx's theory, surplus value is equal to the new value created by workers in excess of their own labor-cost, which is appropriated by the capitalist as profit when products are sold.Marx, The Capital, Chapter 8\\"...It was made clear that the wage worker has permission to work for his own subsistence—that is, to live, only insofar as he works for a certain time gratis for the capitalist (and hence also for the latter's co-consumers of surplus value)...\\" Karl Marx, Critique of the Gotha Programme. Sec.II Marx thought that the gigantic increase in wealth and population from the 19th century onwards was mainly due to the competitive striving to obtain maximum surplus-value from the employment of labor, resulting in an equally gigantic increase of productivity and capital resources. To the extent that increasingly the economic surplus is convertible into money and expressed in money, the amassment of wealth is possible on a larger and larger scale (see capital accumulation and surplus product).  Origin  The concept of surplus value originated in Ricardian socialism, with the term \\"surplus value\\" itself being coined by William Thompson in 1824. William Godwin and Charles Hall are also credited as earlier developers of the concept. Early authors also used the terms \\"surplus labor\\" and \\"surplus produce\\" (in Marx's language, surplus product), which have distinct meanings in Marxian economics: surplus labor produces surplus product, which has surplus value. Some authors consider Marx as completely borrowing from Thompson, notably Anton Menger: This claim of priority has been vigorously contested, notably in an article by Friedrich Engels, completed by Karl Kautsky and published anonymously in 1887, reacting to and criticizing Menger in a review of his The Right to the Whole Produce of Labour, arguing that there is nothing in common but the term \\"surplus value\\" itself. An intermediate position acknowledges the early development by Ricardian socialists and others, but credits Marx with substantial development. For example: Johann Karl Rodbertus developed a theory of surplus value in the 1830s and 1840s, notably in Zur Erkenntnis unserer staatswirthschaftlichen Zustände (Toward an appreciation of our economic circumstances, 1842), and claimed earlier priority to Marx, specifically to have \\"shown practically in the same way as Marx, only more briefly and clearly, the source of the surplus value of the capitalists\\". The debate, taking the side of Marx's priority, is detailed in the Preface to Capital, Volume II by Engels. Marx first elaborated his doctrine of surplus value in 1857–58 manuscripts of A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy (1859), following earlier developments in his 1840s writings. It forms the subject of his 1862–63 manuscript Theories of Surplus Value (which was subsequently published as Capital, Volume IV), and features in his Capital, Volume I (1867).  Theory  The problem of explaining the source of surplus value is expressed by Friedrich Engels as follows: Marx's solution was to distinguish between labor-time worked and labor power. A worker who is sufficiently productive can produce an output value greater than what it costs to hire him. Although his wage seems to be based on hours worked, in an economic sense this wage does not reflect the full value of what the worker produces. Effectively it is not labour which the worker sells, but his capacity to work. Imagine a worker who is hired for an hour and paid $10 per hour. Once in the capitalist's employ, the capitalist can have him operate a boot-making machine with which the worker produces $10 worth of work every 15 minutes. Every hour, the capitalist receives $40 worth of work and only pays the worker $10, capturing the remaining $30 as gross revenue. Once the capitalist has deducted fixed and variable operating costs of (say) $20 (leather, depreciation of the machine, etc.), he is left with $10. Thus, for an outlay of capital of $30, the capitalist obtains a surplus value of $10; his capital has not only been replaced by the operation, but also has increased by $10. The worker cannot capture this benefit directly because he has no claim to the means of production (e.g. the boot-making machine) or to its products, and his capacity to bargain over wages is restricted by laws and the supply/demand for wage labour.  Definition  Total surplus-value in an economy (Marx refers to the mass or volume of surplus-value) is basically equal to the sum of net distributed and undistributed profit, net interest, net rents, net tax on production and various net receipts associated with royalties, licensing, leasing, certain honorariums etc. (see also value product). Of course, the way generic profit income is grossed and netted in social accounting may differ somewhat from the way an individual business does that (see also Operating surplus). Marx's own discussion focuses mainly on profit, interest and rent, largely ignoring taxation and royalty-type fees which were proportionally very small components of the national income when he lived. Over the last 150 years, however, the role of the state in the economy has increased in almost every country in the world. Around 1850, the average share of government spending in GDP (See also Government spending) in the advanced capitalist economies was around 5%; in 1870, a bit above 8%; on the eve of World War I, just under 10%; just before the outbreak of World War II, around 20%; by 1950, nearly 30%; and today the average is around 35–40%. (see for example Alan Turner Peacock, \\"The growth of public expenditure\\", in Encyclopedia of Public Choice, Springer 2003, pp. 594–597).  Interpretations  Surplus-value may be viewed in five ways: * As a component of the new value product, which Marx himself defines as equal to the sum of labor costs in respect of capitalistically productive labor (variable capital) and surplus-value. In production, he argues, the workers produce a value equal to their wages plus an additional value, the surplus- value. They also transfer part of the value of fixed assets and materials to the new product, equal to economic depreciation (consumption of fixed capital) and intermediate goods used up (constant capital inputs). Labor costs and surplus-value are the monetary valuations of what Marx calls the necessary product and the surplus product, or paid labour and unpaid labour. * Surplus- value can also be viewed as a flow of net income appropriated by the owners of capital in virtue of asset ownership, comprising both distributed personal income and undistributed business income. In the whole economy, this will include both income directly from production and property income. * Surplus- value can be viewed as the source of society's accumulation fund or investment fund; part of it is re-invested, but part is appropriated as personal income, and used for consumptive purposes by the owners of capital assets (see capital accumulation); in exceptional circumstances, part of it may also be hoarded in some way. In this context, surplus value can also be measured as the increase in the value of the stock of capital assets through an accounting period, prior to distribution. * Surplus-value can be viewed as a social relation of production, or as the monetary valuation of surplus-labour – a sort of \\"index\\" of the balance of power between social classes or nations in the process of the division of the social product. * Surplus-value can, in a developed capitalist economy, be viewed also as an indicator of the level of social productivity that has been reached by the working population, i.e. the net amount of value it can produce with its labour in excess of its own consumption requirements.  Equalization of rates  Marx believed that the long-term historical tendency would be for differences in rates of surplus value between enterprises and economic sectors to level out, as Marx explains in two places in Capital Vol. 3: Marxists Internet Archive Hence, he assumed a uniform rate of surplus value in his models of how surplus value would be shared out under competitive conditions.  Appropriation from production  Both in Das Kapital and in preparatory manuscripts such as the Grundrisse and Results of the immediate process of production, Marx asserts that commerce by stages transforms a non-capitalist production process into a capitalist production process, integrating it fully into markets, so that all inputs and outputs become marketed goods or services. When that process is complete, according to Marx, the whole of production has become simultaneously a labor process creating use-values and a valorisation process creating new value, and more specifically a surplus-value appropriated as net income (see also capital accumulation). Marx contends that the whole purpose of production in this situation becomes the growth of capital; i.e. that production of output becomes conditional on capital accumulation. If production becomes unprofitable, capital will be withdrawn from production sooner or later. The implication is that the main driving force of capitalism becomes the quest to maximise the appropriation of surplus-value augmenting the stock of capital. The overriding motive behind efforts to economise resources and labor would thus be to obtain the maximum possible increase in income and capital assets (\\"business growth\\"), and provide a steady or growing return on investment.  Absolute vs. relative  According to Marx, absolute surplus value is obtained by increasing the amount of time worked per worker in an accounting period.Karl Marx and Frederick The Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 34 (New York: International Publishers, 1994) p. 63. Marx talks mainly about the length of the working day or week, but in modern times the concern is about the number of hours worked per year. In many parts of the world, as productivity rose, the workweek decreased from 60 hours to 50, 40 or 35 hours. Relative surplus value is obtained mainly by: * reducing wagesKarl Marx and Frederick Engels, Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 34, pp. 75–76. — this can only go to a certain point, because if wages fall below the ability of workers to purchase their means of subsistence, they will be unable to reproduce themselves and the capitalists will not be able to find sufficient labor power. * reducing the cost of wage-goods by various means, so that wage increases can be curbed.Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 34, p. 77. * increasing the productivity and intensity of labour generally, through mechanisation and rationalisation, yielding a bigger output per hour worked. The attempt to extract more and more surplus-value from labor on the one side, and on the other side the resistance to this exploitation, are according to Marx at the core of the conflict between social classes, which is sometimes muted or hidden, but at other times erupts in open class warfare and class struggle.  Production versus realisation  Marx distinguished sharply between value and price, in part because of the sharp distinction he draws between the production of surplus-value and the realisation of profit income (see also value-form). Output may be produced containing surplus-value (valorisation), but selling that output (realisation) is not at all an automatic process. Until payment from sales is received, it is uncertain how much of the surplus-value produced will actually be realised as profit from sales. So, the magnitude of profit realised in the form of money and the magnitude of surplus-value produced in the form of products may differ greatly, depending on what happens to market prices and the vagaries of supply and demand fluctuations. This insight forms the basis of Marx's theory of market value, prices of production and the tendency of the rate of profit of different enterprises to be levelled out by competition. In his published and unpublished manuscripts, Marx went into great detail to examine many different factors which could affect the production and realisation of surplus-value. He regarded this as crucial for the purpose of understanding the dynamics and dimensions of capitalist competition, not just business competition but also competition between capitalists and workers and among workers themselves. But his analysis did not go much beyond specifying some of the overall outcomes of the process. His main conclusion though is that employers will aim to maximise the productivity of labour and economise on the use of labour, to reduce their unit-costs and maximise their net returns from sales at current market prices; at a given ruling market price for an output, every reduction of costs and every increase in productivity and sales turnover will increase profit income for that output. The main method is mechanisation, which raises the fixed capital outlay in investment. In turn, this causes the unit-values of commodities to decline over time, and a decline of the average rate of profit in the sphere of production occurs, culminating in a crisis of capital accumulation, in which a sharp reduction in productive investments combines with mass unemployment, followed by an intensive rationalisation process of take-overs, mergers, fusions, and restructuring aiming to restore profitability.  Relation to taxation  In general, business leaders and investors are hostile to any attempts to encroach on total profit volume, especially those of government taxation. The lower taxes are, other things being equal, the bigger the mass of profit that can be distributed as income to private investors. It was tax revolts that originally were a powerful stimulus motivating the bourgeoisie to wrest state power from the feudal aristocracy at the beginning of the capitalist era. In reality, of course, a substantial portion of tax money is also redistributed to private enterprise in the form of government contracts and subsidies. Capitalists may therefore be in conflict among themselves about taxes, since what is a cost to some, is a source of profit to others. Marx never analysed all this in detail; but the concept of surplus value will apply mainly to taxes on gross income (personal and business income from production) and on the trade in products and services. Estate duty for example rarely contains a surplus value component, although profit could be earned in the transfer of the estate. Generally, Marx seems to have regarded taxation imposts as a \\"form\\" which disguised real product values. Apparently following this view, Ernest Mandel in his 1960 treatise Marxist Economic Theory refers to (indirect) taxes as \\"arbitrary additions to commodity prices\\". But this is something of a misnomer, and disregards that taxes become part of the normal cost-structure of production. In his later treatise on late capitalism, Mandel astonishingly hardly mentions the significance of taxation at all, a very serious omission from the point of view of the real world of modern capitalism since taxes can reach a magnitude of a third, or even half of GDP (see E. Mandel, Late Capitalism. London: Verso, 1975).For example in the United Kingdom alone 75% of all taxation revenue comes from just three taxes Income tax,National insurance and VAT which in reality is 75% of the GDP of the country.  Relation to the circuits of capital  Generally, Marx focused in Das Kapital on the new surplus-value generated by production, and the distribution of this surplus value. In this way, he aimed to reveal the \\"origin of the wealth of nations\\" given a capitalist mode of production. However, in any real economy, a distinction must be drawn between the primary circuit of capital, and the secondary circuits. To some extent, national accounts also do this. The primary circuit refers to the incomes and products generated and distributed from productive activity (reflected by GDP). The secondary circuits refer to trade, transfers and transactions occurring outside that sphere, which can also generate incomes, and these incomes may also involve the realisation of a surplus-value or profit. It is true that Marx argues no net additions to value can be created through acts of exchange, economic value being an attribute of labour- products (previous or newly created) only. Nevertheless, trading activity outside the sphere of production can obviously also yield a surplus-value which represents a transfer of value from one person, country or institution to another. A very simple example would be if somebody sold a second-hand asset at a profit. This transaction is not recorded in gross product measures (after all, it isn't new production), nevertheless a surplus-value is obtained from it. Another example would be capital gains from property sales. Marx occasionally refers to this kind of profit as profit upon alienation, alienation being used here in the juridical, not sociological sense. By implication, if we just focused on surplus-value newly created in production, we would underestimate total surplus-values realised as income in a country. This becomes obvious if we compare census estimates of income & expenditure with GDP data. This is another reason why surplus-value produced and surplus- value realised are two different things, although this point is largely ignored in the economics literature. But it becomes highly important when the real growth of production stagnates, and a growing portion of capital shifts out of the sphere of production in search of surplus-value from other deals. Nowadays the volume of world trade grows significantly faster than GDP, suggesting to Marxian economists such as Samir Amin that surplus-value realised from commercial trade (representing to a large extent a transfer of value by intermediaries between producers and consumers) grows faster than surplus-value realised directly from production. Thus, if we took the final price of a good (the cost to the final consumer) and analysed the cost structure of that good, we might find that, over a period of time, the direct producers get less income and intermediaries between producers and consumers (traders) get more income from it. That is, control over the access to a good, asset or resource as such may increasingly become a very important factor in realising a surplus-value. In the worst case, this amounts to parasitism or extortion. This analysis illustrates a key feature of surplus value which is that it accumulated by the owners of capital only within inefficient markets because only inefficient markets – i.e. those in which transparency and competition are low – have profit margins large enough to facilitate capital accumulation. Ironically, profitable – meaning inefficient – markets have difficulty meeting the definition a free market because a free market is to some extent defined as an efficient one: one in which goods or services are exchanged without coercion or fraud, or in other words with competition (to prevent monopolistic coercion) and transparency (to prevent fraud).  Measurement  The first attempt to measure the rate of surplus-value in money-units was by Marx himself in chapter 9 of Das Kapital, using factory data of a spinning mill supplied by Friedrich Engels (though Marx credits \\"a Manchester spinner\\"). Both in published and unpublished manuscripts, Marx examines variables affecting the rate and mass of surplus-value in detail. Some Marxian economists argue that Marx thought the possibility of measuring surplus value depends on the publicly available data. We can develop statistical indicators of trends, without mistakenly conflating data with the real thing they represent, or postulating \\"perfect measurements or perfect data\\" in the empiricist manner. Since early studies by Marxian economists like Eugen Varga, Charles Bettelheim, Joseph Gillmann, Edward Wolff and Shane Mage, there have been numerous attempts by Marxian economists to measure the trend in surplus-value statistically using national accounts data. The most convincing modern attempt is probably that of Anwar Shaikh and Ahmet Tonak.http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521564794 Usually this type of research involves reworking the components of the official measures of gross output and capital outlays to approximate Marxian categories, in order to estimate empirically the trends in the ratios thought important in the Marxian explanation of capital accumulation and economic growth: the rate of surplus-value, the organic composition of capital, the rate of profit, the rate of increase in the capital stock, and the rate of reinvestment of realised surplus-value in production. The Marxian mathematicians Emmanuel Farjoun and Moshé Machover argue that \\"even if the rate of surplus value has changed by 10–20% over a hundred years, the real problem [to explain] is why it has changed so little\\" (quoted from The Laws of Chaos: A Probabilistic Approach to Political Economy (1983), p. 192). The answer to that question must, in part, be sought in artifacts (statistical distortion effects) of data collection procedures. Mathematical extrapolations are ultimately based on the data available, but that data itself may be fragmentary and not the \\"complete picture\\".  Different conceptions  In neo-Marxist thought, Paul A. Baran for example substitutes the concept of \\"economic surplus\\" for Marx's surplus value. In a joint work, Paul Baran and Paul Sweezy define the economic surplus as \\"the difference between what a society produces and the costs of producing it\\" (Monopoly Capitalism, New York 1966, p. 9). Much depends here on how the costs are valued, and which costs are taken into account. Piero Sraffa also refers to a \\"physical surplus\\" with a similar meaning, calculated according to the relationship between prices of physical inputs and outputs. In these theories, surplus product and surplus value are equated, while value and price are identical, but the distribution of the surplus tends to be separated theoretically from its production; whereas Marx insists that the distribution of wealth is governed by the social conditions in which it is produced, especially by property relations giving entitlement to products, incomes and assets (see also relations of production). In Kapital Vol. 3, Marx insists strongly that This is a substantive – if abstract – thesis about the basic social relations involved in giving and getting, taking and receiving in human society, and their consequences for the way work and wealth is shared out. It suggests a starting point for an inquiry into the problem of social order and social change. But obviously it is only a starting point, not the whole story, which would include all the \\"variations and gradations\\".  Morality and power  A textbook-type example of an alternative interpretation to Marx's is provided by Lester Thurow. He argues:Thurow, Lester C. (2008). \\"Profits\\". Concise Encyclopedia of Economics. Liberty Fund. \\"In a capitalistic society, profits – and losses – hold center stage.\\" But what, he asks, explains profits? There are five reasons for profit, according to Thurow: * capitalists are willing to delay their own personal gratification, and profit is their reward. * some profits are a return to those who take risks. * some profits are a return to organizational ability, enterprise, and entrepreneurial energy * some profits are economic rents – a firm that has a monopoly in producing some product or service can set a price higher than would be set in a competitive market and, thus, earn higher than normal returns. * some profits are due to market imperfections – they arise when goods are traded above their competitive equilibrium price. The problem here is that Thurow doesn't really provide an objective explanation of profits so much as a moral justification for profits, i.e. as a legitimate entitlement or claim, in return for the supply of capital. He adds that \\"Attempts have been made to organize productive societies without the profit motive (...) [but] since the industrial revolution... there have been essentially no successful economies that have not taken advantage of the profit motive.\\" The problem here is again a moral judgement, dependent on what you mean by success. Some societies using the profit motive were ruined; profit is no guarantee of success, although you can say that it has powerfully stimulated economic growth. Thurow goes on to note that \\"When it comes to actually measuring profits, some difficult accounting issues arise.\\" Why? Because after deduction of costs from gross income, \\"It is hard to say exactly how much must be reinvested to maintain the size of the capital stock\\". Ultimately, Thurow implies, the tax department is the arbiter of the profit volume, because it determines depreciation allowances and other costs which capitalists may annually deduct in calculating taxable gross income. This is obviously a theory very different from Marx's. In Thurow's theory, the aim of business is to maintain the capital stock. In Marx's theory, competition, desire and market fluctuations create the striving and pressure to increase the capital stock; the whole aim of capitalist production is capital accumulation, i.e. business growth maximising net income. Marx argues there is no evidence that the profit accruing to capitalist owners is quantitatively connected to the \\"productive contribution\\" of the capital they own. In practice, within the capitalist firm, no standard procedure exists for measuring such a \\"productive contribution\\" and for distributing the residual income accordingly. In Thurow's theory, profit is mainly just \\"something that happens\\" when costs are deducted from sales, or else a justly deserved income. For Marx, increasing profits is, at least in the longer term, the \\"bottom line\\" of business behaviour: the quest for obtaining extra surplus-value, and the incomes obtained from it, are what guides capitalist development (in modern language, \\"creating maximum shareholder value\\"). That quest, Marx notes, always involves a power relationship between different social classes and nations, inasmuch as attempts are made to force other people to pay for costs as much as possible, while maximising one's own entitlement or claims to income from economic activity. The clash of economic interests that invariably results, implies that the battle for surplus value will always involve an irreducible moral dimension; the whole process rests on complex system of negotiations, dealing and bargaining in which reasons for claims to wealth are asserted, usually within a legal framework and sometimes through wars. Underneath it all, Marx argues, was an exploitative relationship. That was the main reason why, Marx argues, the real sources of surplus-value were shrouded or obscured by ideology, and why Marx thought that political economy merited a critique. Quite simply, economics proved unable to theorise capitalism as a social system, at least not without moral biases intruding in the very definition of its conceptual distinctions. Hence, even the most simple economic concepts were often riddled with contradictions. But market trade could function fine, even if the theory of markets was false; all that was required was an agreed and legally enforceable accounting system. On this point, Marx probably would have agreed with Austrian School economics – no knowledge of \\"markets in general\\" is required to participate in markets.

They also refer to the traditions of the Polish Workers' Party and partly of the Polish United Workers' Party.  History  The Communist Party of Poland was founded in July 2002 in Dąbrowa Górnicza by activists largely derived from the Union of Polish Communists \\"Proletariat\\", which had existed since 1990 and was liquidated by the state authorities due to formal procedures. The first congress of the party took place in December 2002, the second - in December 2006, the third - in December 2010, the fourth - in March 2015, and the fifth in July 2019. In the Polish parliamentary elections in 2005 and 2007, KPP members started from the lists of the Polish Labour Party (PPP). In the 2005 Polish presidential election, the party supported Daniel Podrzycki of the PPP (who died shortly before the election in a road accident). Before the 2010 Polish presidential election, the chairman of the party Józef Łachut expressed at the Congress of the Left Alliance support for the candidacy of Grzegorz Napieralski from the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD). In 2010 Polish local elections the party formed an election committee (Red Wrocław Election Committee) and put forward candidates for the Wrocław city council. In the 2011 Polish parliamentary election, individual members of the KPP started to the Sejm from the lists of the SLD or PPP. The Communist Party of Poland called for a boycott of the 2015 Polish parliamentary election. In addition, she established contacts with the Polish Left. In the 2019 Polish parliamentary election, the KPP became part of The Left and put forward one candidate for the Sejm. Before the 2020 Polish presidential election, the Communist Party of Poland supported the candidacy of Waldemar Witkowski from Labour Union.  Party program  The Communist Party of Poland proclaims anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist slogans. It seeks to introduce socialism and take over political and economic power by the proletariat. It also calls for the replacement of capitalist property by social ownership through the nationalization of industry, trade and natural resources. They advocate broad social rights (including free and universal education and free healthcare). The party is for equality and full separation of the Church and the state (including non-financing by the state of religious associations and withdrawal of religious instruction from public schools). They also postulates cessation of privatization and reprivatization and tax reform (progressive tax system, limitation of VAT), as well as property vetting. It criticizes the liquidation of the Polish People's Republic and the political transformation. The KPP is also against Poland's participation in the European Union and NATO. In addition, the party strongly opposes the decommunization laws adopted by the Law and Justice government and the historical policy pursued by the Institute of National Remembrance. Chairmen *14 December 2002 to 8 December 2006 - Marcin Adam *8 December 2006 to 11 December 2010 - Józef Łachut *11 December 2010 – present - Krzysztof Szwej  Structure and activists  The number of activists of the Communist Party of Poland over the years ranged from several hundred to over a thousand activists. The KPP's highest executive body is the National Executive Committee. The central control body of the party is the National Statutory and Audit Commission. The body appointed to deal with individual cases of party members arising from appeals against resolutions of organs, including resolutions on exclusion from it, is the National Peer Court.  Newspaper  The official newspaper of the party is Brzask, published in subscription and available on the Internet.  Legal status and attempts at outlawing  The existence of communist parties in Poland and their activities are legal as long as they refer to the ideology of the communist system, bypassing totalitarian methods and practices. Similarly, communist symbolism is not prohibited in Poland. The Polish Communist Party completely dissociates itself from the use of totalitarian methods. In 2013, Law and Justice activist Bartosz Kownacki requested the party to be banned because of alleged propagation of totalitarianism. As a result of the investigation, the prosecutor's office did not find any evidence of a crime and discontinued the investigation. From 2015 to 2019, a trial was underway regarding the alleged promotion of the totalitarian system by KPP activists in Brzask. On January 18, 2019, the District Court in Dąbrowa Górnicza found editors of the magazine \\"Brzask\\" innocent of the alleged offenses. As part of solidarity with the KPP in connection with the court proceedings against it, in 2018 and 2019 protests under Polish embassies organized, among others The Communist Party of Greece, the Communist Party of Belgium and the Communist Party of Britain. In Poland, solidarity with the KPP was declared by the Democratic Left Alliance and Workers' Democracy.

It premiered on Showtime on December 8, 2013.  Plot  Saul (Mandy Patinkin) coerces the imprisoned Alain Bernard (William Abadie) into contacting his superiors in Mossad and convincing them to deploy two operatives to Tehran to assist Brody (Damian Lewis). Carrie (Claire Danes), now in Tehran posing as a Swiss tourist, meets Fara's uncle Masud (David Diaan) who allows Carrie use of his home as a safehouse. The Mossad operatives make contact with Carrie there. They give her a cyanide needle to be delivered to Brody, which he is to use to kill Danesh Akbari while the operatives create a diversion by detonating C-4 nearby. Brody is repeatedly questioned under the supervision of Majid Javadi (Shaun Toub). Javadi reports back to Akbari (Houshang Touzie), saying that Brody could be of great value for Iranian propaganda, but it's hard to know whether he can be trusted. Javadi suggests that Akbari assess Brody face-to- face. Javadi then organizes a rendezvous with Carrie where he acquires the cyanide needle and confirms that Akbari will likely soon be meeting with Brody. The next day, Brody is taken to an outdoor location secured by Akbari's guards. Akbari arrives there simultaneously and smiles and nods at Brody. Brody approaches him, preparing to use the needle, but before he gets close, Akbari gets back into his car and leaves. Brody is then escorted into a nearby house where Abu Nazir's widow, Nassrin (Naz Deravian), is waiting to talk to Brody and vet him on behalf of Akbari. Six days pass. Brody has been making appearances on Iranian television denouncing the United States. Saul, Lockhart (Tracy Letts), and Dar Adal (F. Murray Abraham) have a meeting. They agree that Brody no longer has a chance of getting close to Akbari. Lockhart states that Brody didn't show up for an attempted extraction out of Iran, his loyalty to the United States can no longer be trusted, and that his knowledge of the operation jeopardizes Javadi's status as an asset. With the President demanding immediate action, Lockhart implies that the only option is to assassinate Brody. Saul calls Carrie, asking why Brody refused the extraction and if Brody has reached out to her. He tells Carrie to fly back to the U.S. where they will reconvene. Carrie, spooked by the phone call, calls Brody and tells him he may be in danger. She asks him to flee Tehran with her, but Brody declines, saying there's nowhere else for him to go. Carrie then spots the two Mossad operatives headed towards Brody and alerts him. Brody evades them and goes to Nassrin's house. He tells her someone tried to kill him, and asks her to arrange a meeting with Akbari, claiming that he has very important information about Majid Javadi. Brody is brought into Akbari's office where they speak in privacy. Brody reveals to Akbari the truth behind his presence in Iran: he was sent there to kill Akbari, so that Javadi, now a CIA asset, could take his place. Akbari thanks Brody for his loyalty and says he will take care of Javadi. Brody then bludgeons Akbari in the head with a crystal ash tray, and suffocates him while he is unconscious. Brody finds a cell phone on Akbari's desk and uses it to call Carrie, telling her, \\"I killed him. Get me out of here\\".

One major component of this plan is the construction and operation of Qualifying Industrial Zones. These are industrial facilities within Jordan and Egypt which can serve as centers of collaborative effort.

The formal proposal for the Valley of Peace initiative began with a joint proposal in 2008 to build a canal between the Red and Dead Seas, desalinating the water, producing hydroelectric power and yielding profits, clean water, jobs and potentially unprecedented regional cooperation. The study concluded in 2013, and an agreement was signed in 2013 by Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority to move ahead with the plan. In February 2015, Israel and Jordan signed an agreement to exchange water and jointly convey Red Sea brine to the shrinking Dead Sea. The agreement was reported to be worth about $800 million. It was the result of a memorandum of understanding signed among Israeli, Jordanian and Palestinian officials on December 9, 2013, in Washington. Under this agreement, Jordan and Israel will share the potable water produced by a future desalination plant in Aqaba, while a pipeline will supply saltwater to the Dead Sea.Israel, Jordan sign historic plan to save Dead Sea, By Sharon Udasin, jpost.com 02/27/2015.Israel Desalinization Technology Leads to “Historic” Agreement with Jordan, israelideas.org, April 22, 2015. In December 2015, Israel and Jordan formally released the technical plans to move ahead with this project. A new desalination plant to be built near the Jordanian tourist resort of Aqaba would convert salt water from the Red Sea into fresh water for use in southern Israel and southern Jordan; each region would get eight billion to 13 billion gallons a year. This process would produces about as much brine as a waste product; the brine would be piped more than 100 miles to help replenish the Dead Sea, already known for its high salt content. This would reinforce the status of the Dead Sea as an important economic resource to both nations, in multiple areas including tourism, industry and business. In July 2017, Israel and the Palestinian Authority announced a new deal to provide drinking water for millions of Palestinians. this was part of the larger deal between Israel, Jordan and Palestinians to build a 220-kilometer (137-mile) pipeline to convey water from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea. One benefit of this canal would be to replenish the dwindling Dead Sea. Also, the water in this canal will generate electricity for local towns, and will also power a desalination plant to produce drinking water.

This Valley of Peace is part of a 20-kilometer [23-mile] corridor being proposed by Israeli President Shimon Peres for regional economic development. About 420 km of the corridor runs along the Jordanian border, with no border fences, and another 100 km touches on the Palestinian territories. Other projects involve the German, Japanese, and Turkish governments and are slated to create up to a million new jobs in Israel and the West Bank. Original project contents, 2008 As first proposed in 2008, the plan encompassed a number of items. Some possible future developments along the canal may include convention centers, hotels for up to 200,000 people, restaurants, parks, and artificial lakes and lagoons, and greenhouses for winter fruits and vegetables. A high- speed train line and highway would run along the canal allowing travel between the Dead and Red Seas within an hour. The area may also become a free-trade zone, thus attracting investment from around the world. The canal might also include a major desalinization plant. In May 2008, it was announced that this project was getting close to being implemented.

Halper describes ICAHD as \\"a critical, 'radical' organization which can envision a single democratic state in Palestine/Israel.\\"\\"As Long As Our Voice Is Needed\\", altro.co.il; accessed 14 February 2016. Activities ICAHD's activities, which are based on nonviolent direct action, include exhibits, films, workshops, tours of the occupied territories, publication of books and articles on the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, international advocacy. ICAHD also organizes the rebuilding of demolished Palestinian houses using a network of Israeli, Palestinian and international volunteers. In April 2012 founding member Meir Margalit estimated that the organization had rebuilt 1,000 homes including 200 in East Jerusalem. In addition to rebuilding demolished Palestinian houses, ICAHD often takes legal actions on behalf of Palestinians whose houses have been demolished or are threatened with demolition (see example of Aqabah). Members of ICAHD have been arrested numerous times by the Israeli army and police for attempting to prevent the demolition of Palestinian homes. Most recently, on 3 April 2008, ICAHD Coordinator Jeff Halper was arrested for the eighth time while nonviolently protesting the bulldozing of the home of the Hamdan family in a Palestinian neighborhood of Jerusalem – a house that had already been torn down once by Israeli authorities and had been rebuilt by ICAHD. In April 2012 one of ICAHD's founders, Meir Margalit was questioned by the Israeli Interior Ministry. Margalit, who admitted being involved in the rebuilding of over 200 homes, later commented, \\"I was asked if I did it on purpose and answered that I do not recognize the Interior Ministry's right to question me about my activities in East Jerusalem, which is occupied territory and where Israeli law is not valid\\". Margalit, a Jerusalem City Councilor, felt that he was being singled out for political reasons stating \\"we're in the McCarthy era, and it will get to everyone sooner or later.\\" In response, the Interior Ministry spokesperson said that \\"Mr. Meir Margalit was summoned for questioning on suspicion of building without a permit, which is a criminal act.\\" ICAHD sends out action alerts and activists from different groups go out and engage in civil disobedience by stopping the bulldozers.

Writing in The Independent, Yasmin Alibhai-Brown described the ICAHD as \\"valiant, peaceful activists trying to stop bulldozers that daily demolish Palestinian homes and who tenaciously campaign against the occupation and land grabs by their own nation, their own people.\\" Criticism Malcolm Hoenlein, in 2007, then executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, said ICAHD was \\"trying to talk about demolitions without presenting the reason or truth for it.

Freedman felt that Halper and ICAHD should have been willing to condemn wrongdoing \\"on both sides\\".

Concern was also expressed that Israel may prefer this solution over the traditional two-state solution. Jordan, which back then was more than 50 percent Palestinian, would be further cemented as a de facto Palestinian state. However, some Jordanian officials have supported Jordanian control over the West Bank.

It de jure legalised a union of several Soviet republics that had existed since 1919 and created a new centralised federal government (Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union and Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union (TsIK) were the legislative while Council of People's Commissars was the executive) where key functions were centralised in Moscow. The Treaty along with the Declaration of the Creation of the USSR was approved on 30 December 1922 by a conference of delegations from the Russian SFSR, the Transcaucasian SFSR, the Ukrainian SSR and the Byelorussian SSR. The Treaty and the Declaration were confirmed by the 1st Congress of Soviets of the USSR and signed by heads of delegations Voted Unanimously for the Union Mikhail Kalinin, Mikhail Tskhakaya, Mikhail Frunze and Grigory Petrovsky, Aleksandr Chervyakov Creation of the USSR at Khronos.ru respectively on December 30, 1922. The treaty provided flexibility to admit new members. Therefore, by 1940 the Soviet Union grew from the founding four republics to 15 republics. On 8 December 1991, Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian Presidents signed the Belovezha Accords. The agreement declared dissolution of the USSR by its founder states (denunciation of the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR) and established the CIS. On 10 December, the accord was ratified by the Ukrainian and Belarusian parliaments. On 12 December, the agreement was ratified by the Russian Parliament, therefore the Russian SFSR renounced the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and de facto declared Russia's independence from the USSR. On 26 December 1991, the USSR was self- dissolved by the Council of the Republics of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the first house of Soviet legislature (the second house, the Council of the Union, was without a quorum).  Background  The treaty was a result of many internal political conflicts within the Bolshevik Party and governments inside the Union. Initially, Vladimir Lenin did not see that Russia's October Revolution would end all foreign borders as such. That view was supported by Leon Trotsky and his followers, who believed that Russia was only a first step in a future world revolution. However, as the Red Army approached the edges of the former Russian Empire and its borders (including the newly-created borders of areas that had declared independence after the October Revolution), it needed an excuse to cross them. One such method was a creation of an alternative government, a Soviet Republic, which would then take over authority as the Red Army ousted the existing government. That was the case with Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan and failed campaigns such as in the Baltic States and Poland. Alternatively, it would use the presence of a minority to undermine the standing army (such as the establishment Tatar and Bashkir autonomies) and, where there was no national minority, a government based on geographical locale – Far Eastern Republic, Turkestan. However, the Red Army's ultimate failure in the Polish–Soviet War placed the Bolshevik world revolution plans on hold. Simultaneously, the growing figure of Joseph Stalin pursued a different agenda. Lenin himself saw the creation of national republics as a permanent feature in line with his korenizatsiya policies. In spring of 1922, Lenin suffered his first stroke, and Stalin, still being a People's Commissar for Nationalities, gained a new official chair as the General Secretary of the Communist Party. Stalin argued that now that the Russian Civil War had concluded and that war communism was now replaced by the New Economic Policy, which required a country whose legal de jure framework would match its de facto one and reorganising the Bolshevik state into a single sovereign entity. That included liquidating the many splinter Soviet governments and restoring supreme rule to Moscow. The line went directly in conflict with both proponents of korenizatsiya and some of the local governments, most notably in Ukraine (opposition of Christian Rakovsky) and Georgia (Georgian Affair). Thus, the treaty can be viewed as a compromise between the different groups within the Bolshevik camp to satisfy the aspirations of large minorities (the named examples of Georgia and Ukraine) and also to allow for potential expansion, as well. Byelorussia was the smallest republic, but its official languages included Polish and Yiddish in addition to Russian and Belarusian to undermine the authority of the neighbouring Second Polish Republic and to use its sizeable Jewish minority, as well as the Belarusians and Ukrainians in Poland as a future fifth column. At the same time, it created a new centralised federal government in which key functions would clearly be in the hands of Moscow.

In the cover sheet, the title Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was typed in Russian, French, English and German, as well as the actual words Treaty on the Formation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics also in those four languages. It contained the original state emblem of the Soviet Union. The declaration was written as a reflection on contemporary international relations and why the treaty was necessary. According to the narrative, there are now two distinct camps, an \\"exploiting\\" capitalist with colonialism, chauvinism and social and ethnic inequalities and a \\"free\\" socialist one with mutual trust, peace and international cooperation and solidarity. The former sought to destroy the latter, but because of the common good that the latter is based on, the former has failed. The declaration goes on and lists three factors as to why this Union is a necessary step. First of all, the aftermath of the Civil War left many of the republics' economies destroyed, and rebuilding in the new socialist fashion is proving difficult without closer economic cooperation. Secondly, foreign threats continue to loom over the socialist camp, and its sovereignty requires an alliance for defence. Finally, the ideological factor, that the Soviet rule is internationalist in nature and pushes the working masses to unite in a single socialist family. These three factors justify in uniting in a single state that would guarantee prosperity, security and development. Finally the declaration then specifies that the resultant Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is one that is created on free will of the peoples, that its purpose follows the ideals of the October Revolution, that each and every socialist republic has the right to join and leave the Union at its own will, and hinting at the Soviet foreign policy of socialist irredentism (see World revolution), finishes stating that the treaty ...will serve a decisive step on the path of unification of all workers into a \\"World Socialist Soviet Republic\\". Following the declaration, is the treaty itself consisting of a preface and 26 articles. * In the preface it is fixed that the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic, the Byelorussian Socialist Soviet Republic and the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (containing Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia) acting in free will, agree to form a single Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, that is governed on articles listed in the treaty. * Article 1 lists the competency of the responsibilities that the Union's authorities would contain. These include all foreign affairs; international treaties; change in external borders; expansion of the Union by accepting new republics; declaring war and agreeing to peace; foreign and domestic trade; authority over economic development; creating a single postal and transport services; the armed forces; internal migration; creation of single judiciary, education and healthcare services as well as unifying all units of measurement. All of the above would be thus explicitly controlled directly by the Union's authority. Moreover, the final clause explicitly listed, that the Union's authorities could now overturn acts of all Republics' authorities (be it Congresses of Soviets, Soviets of People's Commissars or Central Executive Committees) that were deemed in violation with regard to this Treaty. * Articles 2–10 determined the structure of supreme authorities of the Union. The legislative authority, according to the treaty, was the Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union and between the congresses, this was to be carried out by the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union (TsIK) (2). The delegates to the Congress are to be elected by local Soviets represented by one elected representative from 25,000 voters in urban areas and one per 125,000 voters in rural areas (3). The Congress delegates would be elected by local Guberniya Soviets, rather than Republican ones (4). The congresses would be held annually or may be summoned by requests of at least two Republics' or the Union's TsIK (5). The TsIK would be the main body to carry out executive functions between the congresses. This TsiK was a 371-person body, whose members were proportionally represented to the population of the Union, and elected by the Congress (6). The Union TsIK would meet four times per annum on a regular basis, whilst irregular sessions can be summoned on demand by the Union government (the Council of People's Commissars) or by one of the constituent Republics (7). The Congress and the TsIK would be held in the capitals of the Union Republics in the order that would be decided by TsIK's Presidium (8). The latter was to be appointed by TsIK, that would be the supreme power organ between its sessions (9). This Presidium would consist of nineteen members, with four chairmen, each representing the four republics (10). The Presidium also had the authority to summon an irregular session of TsIK. * Article 11 appointed the executive authority, the Council of People's Commissars (SNK). The council's members were appointed by TsIK, and included ten portfolios (commissariats) as well as a chairmen and his deputies. * Article 12 specified the functions of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union (under control of TsIK) and the secret police, the OGPU (under control of the SNK, and the OGPU chairman was to be a participant of the SNK with advisory vote). The creation of these two bodies was justified as measures to overcome criminal and counter-revolutionary elements in that very article. * Articles 13–17 specified the framework on the legal proceedings between the Union's supreme bodies (the TsIK and the SNK) and those of each republic. All of the decrees by Union's SNK were effective in every republic (13). Also confirmed, was the multilingual aspect of the Union, specifying that all of the Union's decrees are to printed in the official language of each constituent republic (Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Georgian, Armenian and Turkic (i.e. Azerbaijani)) (14). It was specified that the Union's SNK resolution may only be overruled by the Union's TsIK or its Presidium (16), and if a republican TsIK chooses to protest the resolution or a decree of the Union's TsIK, the protest itself does not halt the implementation of the document (15). The latter is only possible if there are obvious violations with existing laws, and in such cases, the republic must immediately notify the Union's SNK and the relevant commissariat (17). * Article 18 listed the authorities that would be retained by the Republics and specified their respective Councils of People's Commissars, each to have a chairmen, his deputies, eleven portfolios and representatives with advisory votes of several Union-level commissariats, in particular foreign affairs, defence, foreign trade, transport and logistics. * At the same time article 19 specified that republican-level organs, the Supreme Soviet of the National Economy (whose chairman was to also have a full seat in the relevant republican SNK), the commissariats for food supply, finance and labour, as well as the Soviet inspection (the Rabkrin) though subjugated to the Republican authorities, their activities were to be regulated by the Union's TsIK. * Article 20 discussed that the budgets of the Republics would form the Union's budget and that all expenses and spendings by the Republics would be determined by the Union's TsIK. Moreover, the latter would also determine the share of profits, if any, that each Republic would receive. * Articles 21–23 created a single Soviet citizenship (21), state symbolism (flag, national anthem and a coat of arms – 22), and specified the Union's capital in Moscow (23). * Article 24 demanded that the republics amended their constitutions with regard to the treaty. * Article 25 specified that any amendments, additions or changes to the treaty may be done only by the Union's Congress of Soviets. * Article 26 affirmed the clause in the declaration where each republic has the right to leave the Union. Immediate aftermath=Politics Initially, the treaty did little to alter the major political spectrum. Most of the governing positions of the RSFSR's supreme organs were automatically transferred to those of the USSR. For example, the Chairman of the All-Union Central Executive Committee (TsIK) was taken by Mikhail Kalinin, who would retain his chair as Russia's TsIK. Likewise, Lenin's position as chairman of RSFSR's Council of People's Commissars (SNK), which he held since the Revolution, would now to be transformed as the Chairman of the Union's SNK. However, as Lenin remained ill from the stroke, both of his chairs would be occupied by Alexei Rykov as acting head of the government. Joseph Stalin's position as General Secretary of the Communist Party was also unchanged. However, the party's position was. Prior to the treaty, the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (RKP(b)) had its own bureaus to oversee activities in distant regions such as the Turkestani Bureau, the Transcaucasian Bureau etc.. After the Treaty, the party was reorganised as the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) (VKP(b) – V for Vsesoyuznaya, the All- Union). Although the republics' parties remained, Russia's party retained its primus inter pares position but also officially took over as a supreme authority in the USSR. Central Asia One area in which the Soviet division of power was not resolved during the treaty's signing was Soviet Central Asia, which contained several problems. A major battleground during the Russian Civil War, the region would remain unstable after it. Turkestan had come under Russian control fairly recently, between 1867 and 1885. Moreover, unlike other ethnic borders of the former Russian Empire, which were delimited during the Tsarist days (for example, Transcaucasia lost its feudal administration by the mid-19th century), the Soviet authorities inherited two provinces that were de jure never part of Russia proper, the Emirate of Bukhara and the Khanate of Khiva. During the Russian Civil War, they shared the fate of the other republics, but even there, their special status was preserved, and they were established as the Bukharan and Khorezm People's Soviet Republics. Despite Mikhail Frunze's victories, the conflict was ongoing, and whole provinces were under control of the Basmachi movement in 1922. To settle the issue, in line with the korenizatsiya policy a massive programme of national delimitation in Central Asia was undertaken. On October 27, 1924, TsIK issued a decree where the former Bukharan, Khivan People's Republics as well as the RSFSR's Turkestan were re-organized as the Uzbek SSR and the Turkmen SSR, both of whom became full Union Republics on 13 May 1925. The borders of the new republics matched the ethnic ones, and Uzbekistan initially also contained a newly-formed Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, which would be elevated to a full Union Republic on October 16, 1929 to become the Tajik SSR. Soviet Constitution In January 1924, the Second Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union, that was called in accordance to the treaty ratified the first 1924 Soviet Constitution. The constitution's text is essentially the rewritten and expanded treaty. It even contains the same declaration. The treaty had 26 articles, but the constitution had eleven chapters and 72 articles. Aftermath and legality Some experts argue that the original Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, ceased to exist as such, upon the adoption of the 1936 Soviet Constitution on 5 December 1936, which greatly altered the internal arrangement and reorganised the Soviet Union from a confederation into a proper federal country. Instead of the Congress of Soviets, the new constitution created a permanent parliament, the Supreme Soviet. It also tied together most of the authorities and most significantly affirmed the role of the Communist Party as the \\"driving force\\" behind the Soviet Union's working masses. With regard to the original Treaty, the adoption of the Constitution re-organised the make-up of the Union. The Transcaucasian SFSR ceased to exist, and its three republics were fully admitted to the Union. Simultaneously, two of RSFSR's autonomies, the Kazak and the Kirghiz ASSRs, were re-organised as full republics. Therefore, the seven became the eleven. The Transcaucasian SFSR existed until December 5, 1936, when it was broken into Armenian, Georgian and Azerbaijani SSRs. The same day, the Kazak and Kirghiz ASSRs of the RSFSR ceased to exist, and their territory was divided between the new Kazakh and Kirghiz SSRs.  1940  In a prelude to World War II, several new republics were created before the 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union. The first was the Karelo-Finnish SSR, which on 31 March 1940 was elevated to a union republic from the Karelian ASSR, previously part of the RSFSR. After the annexation of Baltic states, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were transformed into the Lithuanian SSR (July 13), Latvian SSR (July 21) and Estonian SSR (also July 21) and were formally adjoined to the Soviet Union on 3, 5 and 6 August respectively. The final republic was the Moldovian SSR, which merged the large territory of Bessarabia with the Moldovian ASSR, previously part of the Ukrainian SSR. After World War II, no new republics were established. Instead, the Karello-Finnish SSR was downgraded into an autonomous republic and reannexed by the RSFSR on July 16, 1956. Annulment On December 8, 1991, the leaders of the Ukrainian and Belorussian SSRs, and the RSFSR met to agree on the annulment of the 1922 treaty, which was terminated on December 25, 1991, effectively dissolving the USSR. On March 15, 1996, the State Duma of the Russian Federation expressed its legal position in relation to the decision of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR in \\"The denunciation of the Treaty establishing the Soviet Union\\" as the wrongful, unconstitutional act passed by a grave violation of the Constitution of the RSFSR, the norms of international law and then in force legislation.

The group first convened in February 2004, at the first annual Middle East coexistence conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. ALLMEP was formally incorporated in 2006. It grew from 14 organizations in 2004 to 27 in 2005 and 44 NGOs in 2007. Overview, ALLMEP website. ALLMEP has met with USAID and State Department officials, including at its event in Jerusalem in 2006 which included NGO representatives and U.S. diplomats. It also has ongoing contact with appropriate U.S. officials responsible for NGO funding. ALLMEP hosts an annual event in Washington. In June 2005, ALLMEP held a summer conference on coexistence. The event included Middle East ambassadors, Jewish and Muslim religious leaders, members of Congress, State Department officials, leading pro-Israel and pro-Arab activists, Middle East NGO activists to discuss ALLMEP's agenda of coexistence. More than 250 participated, including diplomats from Tunisia, Yemen, Sweden, Saudi Arabia, and Afghanistan. The programming included a panel discussion by Egyptian Ambassador Fahmy, Jordanian Prince Firas bin Raad, Palestinian Chief Representative Hassan Abdel Rahman, Luxembourg Ambassador (during EU presidency) Arlette Conzemius-Paccoud, and former U.S. Ambassador Phillip Wilcox of the Washington Middle East Institute. ALLMEP members also met with over 30 congressional offices, regarding the NGOs work on reconciliation. In March 2006, ALLMEP co-sponsored a reception and screening of a new documentary film about coexistence efforts, Encounter Point. In conjunction with this event, ALLMEP and JustVision representatives met with more than 37 congressional offices. In March 2009, the summit members of ALLMEP met with members of Congress, the Department of State, USAID, and the White House. As interest increased for the idea of the IFFIPP, the Alliance doubled its number of meetings in 2009 compared to 2008, and met with over ten percent of Congressional offices.

The most common languages amongst the Israeli British community are Hebrew, Arabic and British English. Contemporary issues Some Israeli-Jewish expatriates in Europe complain that they feel excluded from the rest of the Jewish community. Only 2% of expats in Britain and France who responded to a 2008 survey said that they feel part of the local Jewish community. Despite many Israelis claiming not to feel connected to other Jewish groups in the country, around 33% of those interviewed said they felt more attached to their Jewish identity rather than their Israeli identity, with 11% saying they identified less as Jews.Expat and excluded, Israelis in the UK A survey by JTA reported that the Israeli community in the UK had little involvement in the local Jewish community, though Israeli expats often chose to live in predominantly Jewish areas. Israelis in the UK often complain of being discouraged by the perceived \\"frosty\\" attitude of British Jews towards them, but at the same time many Israelis in Britain are indifferent to the local Jewish community and reluctant to become part of it. Media Alondon is London's main Hebrew- language magazine that caters primarily to the British Israeli community.Alondon official website Notable people One of the most notable British people of Israeli descent is Sacha Baron Cohen, comedian, writer and Golden Globe-winning actor. His mother came from Israel. Others include entertainer Uri Geller and professional wrestler Noam Dar. In 2008, six Israelis were counted amongst the top 50 richest people in the UK, according to the Sunday Times Rich List, equal to the number of people born in the UK who made the top 50. They include Lev Leviev (worth £2.5 billion); Benny Steinmetz; and brothers Eddie and Saul Zakai.

Martov (born Yuliy Osipovich Tsederbaum/Zederbaum; 24 November 1873 – 4 April 1923) was a politician and revolutionary who became the leader of the Mensheviks in early 20th-century Russia.Israel Getzler, Martov: A Political Biography of a Russian Social Democrat (2003). He was an old friend and mentor of Leon Trotsky,Figes, p. 295 who described him as the \\"Hamlet of Democratic Socialism\\".Figes, p. 468 Early life Martov was born to a middle-class Jewish family in Constantinople, Ottoman Empire (modern day Istanbul). His sister was the fellow Menshevik leader Lydia Dan. He was arrested as a teenager, and his grandfather paid 300 roubles to bail him out. Instead of accepting his grandfather's suggestion of emigrating to the United States of America, he chose to be exiled for two years in Vilna (now Vilnius). He recounted that the famine crisis of 1891 made him a Marxist: \\"It suddenly became clear to me how superficial and groundless the whole of my revolutionism had been until then, and how my subjective political romanticism was dwarfed before the philosophical and sociological heights of Marxism\\".Figes, p. 162 In Russia, Martov was originally a close colleague of Vladimir Lenin and with him, and a small group of Marxist intellectuals, founded the League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class in 1895.Tony Cliff (1986) Lenin: Building the Party 1893–1914. London, Bookmarks: 52–59 The founders were arrested almost immediately after its establishment; it could however claim some success when local activists of the union organised the textile strike of 30,000 workers in 1896.Figes, p. 148 Both Martov and Lenin were exiled to Siberia for this: Martov was sent to the village of Turukhansk in the Arctic, while Lenin was sent to Shushenskoye in the comparatively warm \\"Siberian Italy\\".Simon Sebag Montefiore, Young Stalin, page 96  Exile  Forced to leave Russia and with other radical political figures living in exile, Martov joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). Martov and Lenin were both founding members of the party journal Iskra in 1900.Tony Cliff (1986) Lenin: Building the Party 1893–1914. London, Bookmarks: 100Figes, p. 149 In Munich, Martov was on the editorial board alongside Lenin and Potresov.Figes, p. 150 Martov was one of the Marxists who wanted Nikolay Bauman expelled from the party after an incident where he drove a party member to suicide after drawing a vicious cartoon of her.Figes, p. 198 Martov was initially on good terms with the Jewish Bund. However, Martov would eventually have a critical parallel role with Lenin in the opposition to the Bund from the positions of the RSDLP. At the Second Congress of the RSDLP in London in 1903, there was a dispute between Martov and Lenin over who was to be considered a 'member' of the RSDLP. Lenin had published his ideas for moving the party forward in his pamphlet What Is to Be Done?, which was a document putting forward the views of the entire Iskra group led by Lenin and Martov. However, in the London Congress of the party, differing definitions of party membership were put forward by the two men. Lenin argued for a restricted membership of fully committed cadre while Martov argued for a looser interpretation of membership. Martov later refused to participate in the editorial board of Iskra with Lenin and Georgi Plekhanov, after Lenin had removed the three Menshevik veterans Axelrod, Potresov and Zasulich.Figes, p. 153 Ideology Martov and Lenin based their ideas for party organization on those prevailing in the Western European social democratic parties, with particular influence from Germany. The split with Lenin was based in differences of the wording of article one of the party statute, concerning membership definition, at the Second Party Congress in Brussels. Martov believed that RSDLP sympathizers who were willing to obey the party's leadership and recognize the party's program should be admitted as party members, as well as those people who were fully paid up party members who participated in one of party's organizations; while Lenin wanted clear dividing lines between party members and party sympathizers, with party membership being limited to those people who were fully paid up party members who participated in one of the party's organisations.Figes, p. 151 Martov's view prevailed at first 28 to 23 votes, but the 5 Bundist delegates and 2 Economists walked out in reaction for the denying of their respective issues, and Lenin's view now won a slight majority.Figes, p. 152 They referred to themselves as Bolsheviks throughout the Congress, hence their adoption of the name Bolshevik which literally means 'person of the majority'. The minority or 'Menshevik' faction adopted the corresponding title. The vote on the editorial board was not seen as important by any of the disputants at the time, and in fact the Bolsheviks were generally in a minority but some delegates had not been present for the crucial vote who would otherwise have voted for the Mensheviks. Martov was one of the Jewish Marxist leaders (alongside Trotsky), who rejected the demands for Jewish national autonomy, with the Iskra group favouring class interests over nationalism; he was therefore deeply opposed to the Bundists' Jewish nationalism.Figes, p. 82 Martov was described as being \\"too good an intellectual to be a successful politician\\", as he often was held back by his integrity, and \\"philosophical approach\\" to matters of politics. He tended to select political allies primarily by the \\"coherence of their general worldview\\", instead of \\"practicality\\" or \\"timeliness\\". His \\"high minded approach\\" would later win rounds of applause among the socialist intelligentsia. Nonetheless, Martov's noble principles made him too \\"soft\\" and \\"indecisive\\", at time when the opposite were politically required of him.Figes, p. 469 He has been described as a \\"brilliant intellectual and party theoretician\\". Activity Together with fellow Wilno Social Democrat, Arkady Kremer, Martov explained the strategy involving mass agitation and participating in Jewish strikes, by also sometimes learning Yiddish to win over their support, in the work On Agitation (1895). The plan detailed that workers were to see a need for broader political campaigning through participating in strikes, led by the Social Democrats as trade unions were banned under the Tsarist regime.Figes, p. 147–8 Leaders of the Menshevik Party at Norra Bantorget in Stockholm, Sweden, May 1917. Pavel Axelrod, Julius Martov and Alexander Martinov Martov became one of the outstanding Menshevik leaders along with George Plekhanov, Fedor Dan and Irakli Tsereteli. Leon Trotsky too was a member of the Menshevik faction for a brief period but soon broke with them. Martov was in exile during the strikes following Bloody Sunday.Figes, p. 180 After the reforms brought about by the 1905 Revolution, Martov argued that it was the role of revolutionaries to provide a militant opposition to the new bourgeois government. He advocated the joining together of a network of organisations, trade unions, cooperatives, village councils and soviets, to harass the bourgeois government until the economic and social conditions made it possible for a socialist revolution to take place. Martov was always to be found on the left wing of the Menshevik faction and supported the reunification with the Bolsheviks in 1905. That fragile unity was short lived, however, and by 1907 the two factions had again split in two. In 1911 Martov notably wrote the pamphlet \\"Spasiteli ili uprazdniteli? Kto i kak razrushal R.S.-D.R.P.,\\" \\"Saviours or destroyers? Who destroyed the RSDLP and how\\", which denounced the Bolsheviks for, among other things, raising money by \\"expropriations,\\" that is, robbing banks.Martov : a political biography of a Russian social democrat by Israel Getzler. Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 1967. pp117,128 This pamphlet was denounced by both Kautsky and Lenin. Martov was joined by Trotsky in Paris in November 1914, where he collaborated with him on Nashe Slovo (\\"Our Word\\").Figes, p. 294 He was the only contributor to Nashe Slovo not to align with Lenin in 1917.Figes, p. 296 In 1914, Martov opposed the First World War, which he viewed as an imperialist war in terms very similar to those of Lenin and Trotsky. He therefore became the central leader of the Menshevik Internationalist faction which organized in opposition to the Menshevik Party leadership. In 1915, he sided with Lenin at an international conference in Switzerland, but later repudiated the Bolsheviks.\\"Julius Martow is Dead: Russian Socialist, Enemy of Lenin, Was an Exile In Germany\\", The New York Times. 6 April 1923. Page 17. Retrieved 14 March 2011. The 'internationalist' minority in the Menshevik party favored a campaign for 'democratic peace'.Figes, p. 293 Martov was the designer of the idea of exchanging Russian Marxist exiles for German citizens interned in Russia. This way, the Russian Marxists revolutionary leaders, including Lenin, would manage to return to Russia following the revolution of 1917. The Provisional Government was however unwilling to agree to the exchange, and Martov agreed to wait.Figes, p. 385 The February Revolution At the onset of the 1917 Revolution, Martov was in Zurich with Lenin.Figes, p. 323 After the February Revolution in 1917, Martov returned to Russia but was too late to stop some Mensheviks joining the Provisional Government. He strongly criticized those Mensheviks such as Irakli Tsereteli and Fedor Dan who, now part of Russia's government, supported the war effort. However, at a conference held on 18 June 1917, he failed to gain the support of the delegates for a policy of immediate peace negotiations with the Central Powers. He was unable to enter in an alliance with his rival Lenin to form a coalition in 1917, despite it being the 'logical outcome' according to the majority of his left wing supporters in the Menshevik faction. The October Revolution When the Bolsheviks came to power as a result of the October Revolution in 1917, Martov became politically marginalised. He believed that the only way to avoid a civil war was through a 'united democratic government' based on the parties of the soviet. His proposal was met with 'torrents of applause' in the Soviet.Figes, p. 489 Martov's faction as a whole was however isolated. His view was denounced by Trotsky.Figes, p. 490 This is best exemplified by Trotsky's comment to him and other party members as they left the first meeting of the council of Soviets after 25 October 1917 in disgust at the way in which the Bolsheviks had seized political power: \\"You are pitiful isolated individuals; you are bankrupts; your role is played out. Go where you belong from now on—into the dustbin of history!\\" To this Martov replied in a moment of rage, \\"Then we'll leave!\\", and then walked in silence away without looking back. He paused at the exit, seeing a young Bolshevik worker wearing a black shirt with a broad leather belt, standing in the shadow of the portico. The young man turned on Martov with unconcealed bitterness: \\"And we amongst ourselves had thought, Martov would at least remain with us\\". Martov stopped, and with a characteristic movement, tossed up his head to emphasize his reply: \\"One day you will understand the crime in which you are taking part\\". Waving his hand wearily, he left the hall.I henhold til Boris Ivanovich Nicolaevsky erindringer \\"Pages from the Past\\" For a while Martov led the Menshevik opposition group in the Constituent Assembly until the Bolsheviks abolished it. Later, when a factory section chose Martov as their delegate ahead of Lenin in a Soviet election, it found its supplies reduced soon afterwards.Martov : a political biography of a Russian social democrat by Israel Getzler. Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 1967. Civil war During the Russian Civil War, Martov supported the Red Army against the White Army; however, he continued to denounce the persecution of non-violent political opponents of the Bolsheviks, whether Social Democrats, trade unionists, anarchists, or newspapers. Speaking of the Red Terror, Martov said: \\"The beast has licked hot human blood. The man-killing machine is brought into motion... But blood breeds blood... We witness the growth of the bitterness of the civil war, the growing bestiality of men engaged in it.\\"The Black book of Communism, p. 736. In October 1920, Martov was given permission to legally leave Russia and go to Germany. Martov spoke at the Halle Congress of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany later that month. Martov had not intended to stay in Germany indefinitely, and only did so after the Mensheviks were outlawed in March 1921, following the Tenth Congress of the ruling Communist Party. In 1922, learning Martov was ill, Lenin asked Stalin to transfer funds to Berlin to contribute to Martov's medical care, but Stalin refused. Martov died in Schömberg, Germany, in April 1923. Before his fatal illness, he launched the newspaper Socialist Messenger, which remained the publication of the Mensheviks in exile in Berlin, Paris, and eventually New York until the last of them had died.

It also represents hotel workers in Hawaii, cannery workers in Alaska, warehouse workers throughout the West and bookstore workers in Portland, Oregon. The union was established in 1937 after the 1934 West Coast Waterfront Strike, a 3-month-long strike that culminated in a 4-day general strike in San Francisco, California, and the Bay Area. It disaffiliated from the AFL-CIO on August 30, 2013. In 2014, the San Francisco Chronicle described the ILWU as \\"the aristocrat of the working class; a top member can earn well over $100,000 a year with excellent benefits\\", with vacancies receiving thousands or sometimes even tens of thousands of applications.Carl Nolte: When S.F. waterfront was scene of bloody riots. SFGate, July 5, 2014 Union officials claim that in the Puget Sound area, such pay numbers are inflated because they do not include \\"casuals\\", part-time workers who are not registered ILWU members, do not receive benefits and earn less, with the minimum being $25.71 per hour (as of 2015).  The 1934 West Coast Waterfront strike  Longshoremen on the West Coast ports had either been unorganized or represented by company unions since the years immediately after World War I, when the shipping companies and stevedoring firms had imposed the open shop after a series of failed strikes. Longshoremen in San Francisco, then the major port on the coast, were required to go through a hiring hall operated by a company union, known as the \\"blue book\\" system for the color of the union's membership book. The Industrial Workers of the World had attempted to organize longshoremen, sailors and fishermen in the 1920s. A number of former IWW members and other militants, such as Harry Bridges, an Australian-born sailor who became a longshoreman after coming to the United States, soon joined the International Longshoremen's Association, when passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act in 1933 led to an explosion in union membership in the ILA among West Coast longshoremen. Those activists, known as the \\"Albion Hall group\\" after their usual meeting place in San Francisco, made contacts with like-minded activists at other ports. They pressed demands for a coastwide contract, a union-run hiring hall and an industrywide waterfront federation and led the membership in rejecting the weak \\"gentlemen's agreement\\" that the conservative ILA leadership had negotiated with the employers. When the employers offered to arbitrate, but only on the condition that the union agree to the open shop, the union struck every West Coast port on May 9, 1934. The strike was a violent one: When strikers attacked the stockade in which the employers were housing strikebreakers in San Pedro, California on May 15, the employers' private guards shot and killed two strikers. Similar battles broke out in San Francisco and Oakland, California, Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington. When the employers made a show of force in order to reopen the port in San Francisco, a pitched battle broke out on the Embarcadero in San Francisco between police and strikers. Two strikers were killed on July 5 by a policeman's shotgun blast into a crowd of picketers and onlookers. This incident is known as Bloody Thursday and is commemorated every year by ILWU members. When the National Guard moved in to patrol the waterfront, the picketers pulled back. The San Francisco and Alameda County Central Labor Councils voted to call a general strike in support of the longshoremen, shutting down much of San Francisco and the Bay Area for four days, ending with the union's agreement to arbitrate the remaining issues in dispute. The union won most of its demands in that arbitration proceeding. Those it did not win outright it gained through hundreds of job actions after the strikers returned to work, as the union gradually wrested control over the pace of work and the employer's power to hire and fire from the shipping and stevedoring companies through the mechanism of hiring halls. Union members also engaged in a number of sympathy strikes in support of other maritime unions' demands.  World War II, integration of African Americans  The ILWU admitted African Americans in the 1930s, and during World War II its San Francisco section alone had an estimated 800 black members, at a time when most San Francisco unions excluded black workers and resisted implementation of President Roosevelt's Executive Order 8802 (1941) against racial discrimination in the US defense industry. However, \\"black union members were a minuscule group within the ILWU [leadership] hierarchy\\", with the few exceptions concentrated in the Oakland locale, which had an even larger black membership than San Francisco. Also, by the own admission of Richard Lynden, the San Francisco locale's president, the ILWU failed to work on the upgrading (promotion) of its black members. Still, in the judgement of historian Albert S. Broussard, \\"as far as blacks were concerned, the ILWU stood head and shoulders above other Bay Area locals in virtually every respect\\" during World War II.  ILWU 1971 strike  The March Inland and expansion to Hawaii  The union commenced the \\"March Inland\\", in which it organized the many warehouses that received the goods that longshoremen handled, both in the ports themselves and further removed from them, shortly after the successful conclusion of the 1934 strike. The union eventually organized warehouses throughout the United States. This \\"March Inland\\" was crucial in improving the working conditions and quality of life with each union it assimilated. For example, the Weighers' and Warehousemens' Union was one such union based in Oakland, California, that became a part of the ILWU, and prior to the assimilation \\"warehouse workers suffered low wages, high job insecurity and frequent speed-ups.\\"  Joining and leaving the CIO  On August 11, 1937, the Pacific Coast district, with the exception of three locals in the Northwest, formally seceded from the ILA, renaming itself the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, after the ILA attempted to reorganize the existing locals, abandon representation of warehousemen and reverse the unions' policies on issues such as unemployment insurance. Harry Bridges was elected President of the new union, which quickly affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Bridges became the West Coast Director for the CIO shortly thereafter. Bridges' star within the CIO began to wane, however, as the Communist Party began to lose ground within the CIO. When the CPUSA began to attack Roosevelt in the months after the signing of the Molotov- Ribbentrop pact in 1939, the CIO responded by abolishing the position of West Coast director of the CIO, limiting Bridges' authority to California. The United States government lost every effort it made to deport Bridges, revoke his naturalization, or prosecute him for denying that he was a member. The CIO, on the other hand, did not consider itself bound by the decisions of the courts or administrative agencies on this issue; after Bridges came out, along with other CP-allied labor leaders, against the Marshall Plan and for Henry A. Wallace's presidential campaign, the CIO expelled the ILWU in 1950 for being dominated by communists.  Survival outside the CIO and return to the AFL-CIO  Expulsion had no real effect, however, on either the ILWU or Bridges' power within it. The organization continued to negotiate agreements, with less strife than in the 1930s and 1940s, and Bridges continued to be reelected without serious opposition. The union negotiated a groundbreaking agreement in 1960 that permitted the extensive mechanization of the docks, significantly reducing the number of longshore workers in return for generous job guarantees and benefits for those displaced by the changes. The agreement, however, highlighted the lesser status that less senior members, known as \\"B-men,\\" enjoyed. Bridges reacted uncharacteristically defensively to these workers' complaints, which were given additional sting by the fact that many of the \\"B-men\\" were black. The additional longshore work produced by the Vietnam War allowed Bridges to meet the challenge by opening up more jobs and making determined efforts to recruit black applicants. The ILWU later faced similar challenges from women, who found it even harder to enter the industry and the union. ILWU headquarters in San Francisco Bridges had difficulty giving up his position in the ILWU, even though he explored the possibility of merging it with the ILA or the Teamsters in the early 1970s. He finally retired in 1977, but only after ensuring that Louis Goldblatt, the long-time Secretary- Treasurer of the union and his logical successor, was denied the opportunity to replace him. The Inlandboatmen's Union, whose members operate tugs, barges, passenger ferries and other vessels on the West Coast, and who had formerly been part of the Seafarers International Union of North America, merged with the ILWU in 1980. The ILWU rejoined the AFL-CIO in 1988, and disaffiliated with it in 2013.  Disaffiliation from the AFL-CIO  The ILWU disaffiliated from the AFL-CIO on August 30, 2013, accusing the AFL-CIO of unwillingness to punish other unions when their members crossed ILWU picket lines and over federal legislative policy issues.\\"Longshore Union Pulls Out of National AFL-CIO.\\" Associated Press. August 31, 2013. Accessed 2013-08-31.  The ILWU in recent years  left The ILWU represents 42,000 members in over 60 local unions in the states of California, Washington, Oregon, Alaska and Hawaii. An additional 4,000 members belong to the Inlandboatmen's Union of the Pacific, which constitutes the Union's Marine Division. Another 14,000 members belong to the autonomous ILWU Canada. With respect to employment in West Coast ports the employer and the union maintain the hiring halls gained through an arbitration following the strike of 1934. According to the union: > [...] the principles embodied in the ILWU hiring hall have bound together > workers who have sought equal opportunity to work under safe conditions at a > fair wage. The hiring hall has always been more than a place where jobs are > dispatched. It is where earnings and work opportunity are equalized, and > jobs are distributed in a fair and democratic system untarnished by > prejudice or favoritism.  Leadership  Harry Bridges led the union from 1934 to 1977. James P. Herman led the union from 1977 to 1991, when David Arian replaced him, followed by Brian McWilliams in 1994. James Spinosa defeated McWilliams in the election for ILWU President in 2000. James Spinoza was defeated by Robert McEllrath, a Longshore worker from Local 4 in Vancouver, WA, who was elected in 2006 and reelected in 2009, 2012 and 2015. The Current President is William Adams, a longshoreman from Tacoma, Wa. Upon his election in 2018 he became the first black ILWU president.  1999 representation election  On April 22, 1999, the ILWU won a representation election for more than 300 workers at the Powell's bookstore chain headquartered in Portland, Oregon. The workers there became ILWU Local 5.  2002 slowdown and lockout  The ILWU was accused of engaging in a slowdown of work on docks in 2002, as an alternative to a strike, to support its contract demands in negotiations with the Pacific Maritime Association. The union has documented that productivity was in fact stable at that time, while the employer claims to have contradictory data. The employers responded to the slowdown with a lockout, disallowing the workers to do their jobs. The Bush administration sought a national emergency injunction under the Taft-Hartley Act against both the employers and the union, and threatened to move longshore workers from coverage under the National Labor Relations Act to coverage under the Railway Labor Act, which would effectively prevent longshore workers from striking. (This is a long-time goal of the PMA and other companies whose workers the ILWU represents.Mongelluzzo, Bill. \\"(Ports) No help from Washington: congressional action to rein in the ILWU would face long odds\\" Journal of Commerce Week November 04, 2002) The Longshore Contract that resulted from 2002 negotiations expired on July 1, 2008. The ILWU and the PMA reached a tentative agreement for a new 6-year Longshore Contract in July 2008. In the following weeks, the ILWU membership voted to approve the new contract.  2008 May Day work stoppage  Longshore worker and crane operator Al Webster joined the Seattle march on May 1, 2007 to call for an end to the Iraq war. In protest of the Iraq War, the ILWU encouraged longshore workers to \\"shut down all West Coast ports\\" by walking off the job on May 1, 2008, to \\"make May Day a 'No Peace, No Work' holiday.\\" On May 1, more than 10,000 ILWU members from all 29 West Coast ports voluntarily stopped work, with some attending rallies held by the ILWU where the union called for working-class people to withhold their labor to protest the war. The employer, the Pacific Maritime Association, filed a complaint against the Union for conducting what it saw as an illegal work stoppage. The court agreed with the PMA and determined that the ILWU had conducted a \\"secondary boycott\\" against the PMA, which is illegal under the National Labor Relations Act of 1935.  2014 Israeli ship standoff  In August 2014, the Israeli-owned ZIM Piraeus was the subject of a major demonstration at the Port of Oakland instigated by the Arab Resource and Organizing Center (AROC). Approximately 500 protesters opposed to Israeli military actions in the Gaza Strip participated. The AROC claimed to have been supported by ILWU dockworkers who refused to unload the ship's cargo, stating that \\"Workers honored our picket and stood on the side of justice.\\" However, the union denied this saying it had taken no position on the conflict in Gaza \\"but in cases when unsafe circumstances arise ... the union must protect the safety of its members in the workplace.\\" An ILWU spokesman said workers were not prepared to become involved because of safety issues related to the size of the demonstration and the heavy police presence. However, several news reports and blogs claimed that some members from ILWU Locals 34 and 10 openly supported the protesters.

Base pay was about $35 an hour. In Southern California, the slowdown caused more than twenty-five cargo ships to idle off the coast, affecting over 700 mariners, primarily Overseas Filipinos. The conflict caused Tesla Motors to airlift cars rather than shipping them, costing millions of dollars. 2020 George Floyd Juneteenth shutdown 38,000 dockyard workers shut down all 29 of the U.S.'s Pacific Coast ports to protest the death of George Floyd and in solidarity with the protests sweeping the nation.

The factions emerged in 1903 following a dispute within the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) between Julius Martov and Vladimir Lenin. The dispute originated at the 2nd Congress of the RSDLP, ostensibly over minor issues of party organization. Martov's supporters, who were in the minority in a crucial vote on the question of party membership, came to be called Mensheviks, derived from the Russian ('minority'), while Lenin's adherents were known as Bolsheviks, from ('majority').Brovkin, Vladimir N. 1991.

Despite the naming, neither side held a consistent majority over the course of the entire 2nd Congress, and indeed the numerical advantage fluctuated between both sides throughout the rest of the RSDLP's existence until the Russian Revolution. The split proved to be long-standing and had to do both with pragmatic issues based in history, such as the failed Revolution of 1905 and theoretical issues of class leadership, class alliances and interpretations of historical materialism. While both factions believed that a proletarian revolution was necessary, the Mensheviks generally tended to be more moderate, and more positive towards the liberal opposition and the peasant-based Socialist Revolutionary Party.  History of the split = 1903–1906  At the 2nd Congress of the RSDLP in August 1903, Julius Martov and Vladimir Lenin disagreed, firstly, in regards to which persons should be in the editorial committee of Iskra, the Party newspaper; secondly, in regards to the definition of a \\"party member\\" in the future Party statute: * Lenin's formulation required the party member to be a member of one of the Party's organizations * Martov's only stated that he should work under the guidance of a Party organization. Although the difference in definitions was small, with Lenin's being slightly more exclusive, it was indicative of what became an essential difference between the philosophies of the two emerging factions: Lenin argued for a small party of professional revolutionaries with a large fringe of non-party sympathizers and supporters, whereas Martov believed it was better to have a large party of activists with broad representation. Martov's proposal was accepted by the majority of the delegates (28 votes to 23). However, after seven delegates stormed out of the Congress—five of whom were representatives of the Jewish Bund who left in protest about their own federalist proposal being defeated—Lenin's supporters won a slight majority, which was reflected in the composition of the Central Committee and the other central party organs elected at the Congress. This was also the reason behind the naming of the factions. It was later hypothesized that Lenin had purposely offended some of the delegates in order to have them leave the meeting in protest, giving him a majority. However, Bolsheviks and Mensheviks were united in voting against the Bundist proposal, which lost 41 to 5.Johnpoll, Bernard K. 1967. The Politics of Futility; The General Jewish Workers Bund of Poland, 1917–1943. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press. pp. 30–31. Despite the outcome of the Congress, the following years saw the Mensheviks gathering considerable support among regular social democrats and effectively building up a parallel party organization.  1906–1916  At the 4th Congress of the RSDLP in 1906, a reunification was formally achieved. In contrast to the 2nd Congress, the Mensheviks were in the majority from start to finish, yet Martov's definition of a party member, which had prevailed at the 1st Congress, was replaced by Lenin's. On the other hand, numerous disagreements about alliances and strategy emerged. The two factions kept their separate structures and continued to operate separately. As before, both factions believed that Russia was not developed enough to make socialism possible and that therefore the revolution which they planned, aiming to overthrow the Tsarist regime, would be a bourgeois-democratic revolution. Both believed that the working class had to contribute to this revolution. However, after 1905 the Mensheviks were more inclined to work with the liberal bourgeois democratic parties such as the Constitutional Democrats because these would be the \\"natural\\" leaders of a bourgeois revolution. In contrast, the Bolsheviks believed that the Constitutional Democrats were not capable of sufficiently radical struggle and tended to advocate alliances with peasant representatives and other radical socialist parties such as the Socialist Revolutionaries. In the event of a revolution, this was meant to lead to a dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry, which would carry the bourgeois revolution to the end. The Mensheviks came to argue for predominantly legal methods and trade union work, while the Bolsheviks favoured armed violence. Some Mensheviks left the party after the defeat of 1905 and joined legal opposition organisations. After a while, Lenin's patience wore out with their compromising and, in 1908, he called these Mensheviks \\"liquidationists.\\" = 1912–14 = In 1912, the RSDLP had its final split, with the Bolsheviks constituting the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, and the Mensheviks the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. The Menshevik faction split further in 1914 at the beginning of World War I. Most Mensheviks opposed the war, but a vocal minority supported it in terms of \\"national defense.\\"  1917 revolutions  After the overthrow of the Romanov dynasty by the February Revolution in 1917, the Menshevik leadership led by Irakli Tsereteli demanded that the government pursue a \\"fair peace without annexations,\\" but in the meantime supported the war effort under the slogan of \\"defense of the revolution.\\" Along with the other major Russian socialist party, the Socialist Revolutionaries (also known as ), the Mensheviks led the emerging network of soviets, notably the Petrograd Soviet in the capital, throughout most of 1917. With the monarchy gone, many social democrats viewed previous tactical differences between the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks as a thing of the past and a number of local party organizations were merged. When Bolshevik leaders Lev Kamenev, Joseph Stalin, and Matvei Muranov returned to Petrograd from Siberian exile in early March 1917 and assumed the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, they began exploring the idea of a complete re-unification of Bolsheviks and Mensheviks at the national level, which Menshevik leaders were willing to consider. However, Lenin and his deputy Grigory Zinoviev returned to Russia from exile in Switzerland on 3 April and re-asserted control of the Bolshevik Party by late April 1917, taking it in a more radical direction. They called for an immediate revolution and transfer of all power to the soviets, which made any re-unification impossible. In March–April 1917, the Menshevik leadership conditionally supported the newly formed liberal Russian Provisional Government. After the collapse of the first Provisional Government on 2 May over the issue of annexations, Tsereteli convinced the Mensheviks to strengthen the government for the sake of \\"saving the revolution\\" and enter a socialist-liberal coalition with Socialist Revolutionaries and liberal Constitutional Democrats, which they did on 17 May. With Martov's return from European exile in early May, the left-wing of the party challenged the party's majority led by Tsereteli at the first post-revolutionary party conference on 9 May, but the right wing prevailed 44–11. From then on, the Mensheviks had at least one representative in the Provisional Government until it was overthrown by the Bolsheviks during the October Revolution. With Mensheviks and Bolsheviks diverging, Mensheviks and non-factional social democrats returning from exile in Europe and United States in spring-summer of 1917 were forced to take sides. Some re-joined the Mensheviks. Others, like Alexandra Kollontai, joined the Bolsheviks. A significant number, including Leon Trotsky and Adolf Joffe, joined the non-factional Petrograd-based anti-war group called Mezhraiontsy, which merged with the Bolsheviks in August 1917. A small yet influential group of social democrats associated with Maxim Gorky's newspaper Novaya Zhizn (New Life) refused to join either party.  After the 1917 Revolution  Noe Zhordania, Menshevik leader and Prime Minister of Georgia The 1917 split in the party crippled the Mensheviks' popularity and they received 3.2% of the vote during the Russian Constituent Assembly election in November 1917 compared to the Bolsheviks' 23% and the Socialist Revolutionaries' 37%. The Mensheviks got just 3.3% of the national vote, but in the Transcaucasus they got 30.2%. 41.7% of their support came from the Transcaucasus and in Georgia, about 75% voted for them.Radkey, Oliver Henry. 1950. The Election to the Russian Constituent Assembly of 1917. Harvard University Press. The right-wing of the Menshevik Party supported actions against the Bolsheviks while the left-wing, the majority of the Mensheviks at that point, supported the left in the ensuing Russian Civil War. However, Martov's leftist Menshevik faction refused to break with the right-wing of the party, resulting in their press being sometimes banned and only intermittently available. The Mensheviks opposed War Communism and in 1919 suggested an alternative programme.O'Brien, James. 11 August 2012. \\"What is to be done: The Menshevik Programme July 1919.\\" Spirit of Contradiction. Retrieved on 26 July 2013. During World War I, some anti-war Mensheviks had formed a group called Menshevik-Internationalists. They were active around the newspaper Novaya Zhizn and took part in the Mezhraiontsy formation. After July 1917 events in Russia, they broke with the Menshevik majority that supported continued war with Germany. The Mensheviks-Internationalists became the hub of the Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party (of Internationalists). Starting in 1920, right-wing Mensheviks-Internationalists emigrated, some of them pursuing anti- Bolshevik activities. The Democratic Republic of Georgia was a stronghold of the Mensheviks. In parliamentary elections held on 14 February 1919, they won 81.5% of the votes and the Menshevik leader Noe Zhordania became Prime Minister. Prominent members of Georgian Menshevik Party were Noe Ramishvili, Evgeni Gegechkori, Akaki Chkhenkeli, Nikolay Chkheidze and Alexandre Lomtatidze. After the occupation of Georgia by the Bolsheviks in 1921, many Georgian Mensheviks led by Zhordania fled to Leuville-sur-Orge, France, where they set up the Government of the Democratic Republic of Georgia in Exile. In 1930, Ramishvili was assassinated by a Soviet spy in Paris. Menshevism was finally made illegal after the Kronstadt uprising of 1921. A number of prominent Mensheviks emigrated thereafter. Martov went to Germany, where he established the paper Socialist Messenger. He died in 1923. In 1931, the Menshevik Trial was conducted by Stalin, an early part of the Great Purge. The Messenger moved with the Menshevik center from Berlin to Paris in 1933 and then in 1939 to New York City, where it was published until 1965.Kowalski, Werner. 1985.

It grew out of the Socialist Alliance (SA) in England, and was initiated by several non- aligned members of the SA executive in March 2004. Members of the network were supporters of Respect – The Unity Coalition and other left electoral initiatives including the Green Party. The main aspect of the network was its now defunct website, which had regularly updated articles from a wide range of socialist perspectives on issues including the possibilities of creating socialist unity. History The network was formed in March 2004 by several non-aligned members of the Socialist Alliance in England, and grew to include left-wing activists from a range of political parties and campaigning organisations, and those with no party affiliation. It was centrally involved in the debates around the winding down of the Socialist Alliance and the formation of Respect. It produced its own leaflets on occasions and in the 2005 General Election some members of the network stood as \\"Socialist Unity\\" candidates, providing a banner under which independent socialists could choose to stand, as part of the Socialist Green Unity Coalition, a coalition with the Socialist Party. Socialist Unity candidates stood again in the 2006 council elections, gaining over 5% of the vote in Swindon, and over 10% in Hackney. The network also produced a 2005 election guide with Red Pepper magazine.

Radical cheerleading combines elements of peaceful protest or non-violent direct action with theatrical elements including costuming, spectacle and choreographed dance. Radical cheerleading was created by sisters Cara Jennings,, Aimee Jennings and Coleen Jennings in Miami, Florida, USA in 1996. It grew to become an international movement with squads in the United States, Canada and the European Union. Radical cheerleaders create and adapt cheers that promote feminism and left-wing ideals.  Subculture  Radical cheerleading developed as subculture apart from cheerleading. Mainstream cheerleading reached new heights of popularity in the 1990s, as it transformed from a form of entertainment to being understood as an athletic sport. The first Cheerleading World Championship took place in 2001, asserting cheerleading as a competitive sport. During this time the popular view of cheerleaders in the United States was highly gendered and highly sexualized, including the Bring It On franchise of films. The satirical practice of radical cheerleading developed alongside the growing popularity of cheerleading in popular culture. Author Christine Ro writes, \\"the popular image of cheerleading was still very much of the minimally dressed female cheerleader on the sidelines of a male sports event. This was the image radical cheerleaders seized upon in order to subvert gender messages while serving up peppy support for social justice causes.\\"  Gender non-conformity  Gender non-conformity is a foundation upon which the subculture of radical cheerleading developed. Since its creation, radical cheerleading has been a movement open to all: participants may be male, female, transgender, non-binary or non-gender identified. Often, radical cheerleaders subvert gender norms through costuming and aesthetics. According to author and radical cheerleader Jeanne Vaccaro, the movement was responsible for \\"cultivating a queer sensibility.\\" The subculture’s inclusion of non- gender-conforming individuals creates a space for all bodies, which in turn creates a uniquely accepting community. This is more than just an open-door policy, but an identifying characteristic of the subculture of radical cheerleading, just as relevant to the movement as the leftist messages it asserts. thumb  Aesthetics  Radical cheerleaders reappropriate the aesthetics of cheerleading, sometimes in an ironic fashion. Radical cheerleaders dress in diverse ways. Radical cheerleading is often marked by a DIY aesthetic, with handmade costumes and props. Some radical cheerleaders make pom-poms using garbage bags by folding them in half, tying off one side with a rubber band and then cutting strips from the other end. Every squad has a unique aesthetic of its own. The Dirty Southern Belles, from Memphis, Tennessee, wear the colors pink and black to cheer for gay pride. The Pirate Cheerleaders, a squad from Milwaukee, wear black skirts with white pleats, and shirts with pirate logos when performing at basement punk shows. The New Paltz Rads, a squad from the State University of New York at New Paltz, sport signature colors black and red.  Notable demonstrations  thumb Radical cheerleaders often perform at political demonstrations, festivals and other feminist events, where they lead protest chants. Radical cheerleading is used at demonstrations to promote political messages in a media-friendly, people- friendly way. Radical cheerleaders may also perform on stage at music venues, to bring political issues (as well as entertainment) to an unsuspecting crowd. A notable demonstration took place at a Taco Bell restaurant in Auburn, Alabama in 2001, where radical cheerleaders gathered to protest for fair wages. Dubbed the \\"Taco Bell Protest,\\" participants explained to police that the purpose of their demonstration was to protest the business relationship between corporate Taco Bell and the Six L's Packing Company, Inc., a firm that pays employees low wages with zero benefits. Radical cheerleaders demonstrated at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York, the March for Women's Lives in Washington, DC on April 25, 2004 and The Resistin' Radicatz, a radical cheerleading squad, performed at the 2004 Million Worker March.  Cheer content  Cheers are usually written from scratch or by rewriting the words of popular and historic songs. The first radical cheer book was published in 1997. An example of a radical cheer, led by creator Cara Jennings, performed at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York: An example of a cheer performed by the Radical Teen Cheer Squad: \\"We're teens, we're cute, we're radical to boot! We're angry, we're tough, and we have had enough!\\"  Media  In Give Me An F: Radical Cheerleading and Feminist Performance, radical cheerleader and Author Jeanne Vaccaro describes the process of archiving radical cheerleading through the examination of cheers, zines, photographs and personal testimony from fellow radical cheerleader Mary Xmas. In a speech at the National Women's Studies Association in 2004, feminist magazine director Lisa Jervis placed radical cheerleading within a tradition of playful feminist comment on popular culture. In August 2004 the New York City Radical Cheerleaders completed Don't Let the System Get You Down—Cheer Up, a video documentary of the Radical Cheerblock at the March for Women's Lives. The video was released in time to celebrate and honor and inspire the hundreds of radical cheerleaders who converged in New York to protest the Republican National Convention.  Responses  Radical cheerleading is a style of performance, and is inherently defined by the element of spectacle. Responses within the media have ranged from positive to negative. Sheila Noone, the editorial director of American Cheerleader magazine, commented that cheerleaders are involved in an \\"uphill battle\\" towards gaining respect, asserting that radical cheerleading makes this even more difficult. In contrast, Lauren Jack, member of Harvard University's Cheerleading squad, made the statement that cheerleading is \\"all about trying to get everyone else excited about your causes, so it's perfect for political activism.\\"  See also  *Anarcha-feminism *Genderfuck *Mary Christmas, one of the founding members of New York City's Radical Cheerleaders *Raging Grannies *Women's International League for Peace and Freedom  References  External links  * Category:Anarcha-feminist collectives Category:Activism by type Category:Protests Cheerleading Category:Cheerleading Category:Anarchist theory Category:Feminism and the arts Category:Feminist protests ","title":"Radical cheerleading"},{"id":"40949256","text":"Big Bad World may refer to: *Big Bad World, a 2008 album by Plain White T's *Big Bad World (TV series), a British sitcom on Comedy Central *\\"Big Bad World\\", a song on the 2013 album In a Perfect World (Kodaline album) ","title":"Big Bad World (disambiguation)"},{"id":"40949262","title":"Politics of Israel"},{"id":"40949267","text":"\\"Property is theft!\\" () See also p. 1. is a slogan coined by French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in his 1840 book What is Property? Or, an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and of Government.  Overview  By \\"property\\", Proudhon referred to a concept regarding land property that originated in Roman law: the sovereign right of property, the right of the proprietor to do with his property as he pleases, \\"to use and abuse,\\" so long as in the end he submits to state-sanctioned title. Proudhon contrasts the supposed right of property with the rights (which he considered valid) of liberty, equality, and security. Proudhon was clear that his opposition to property did not extend to exclusive possession of labor-made wealth. In the Confessions d'un revolutionnaire Proudhon further explained his use of this phrase:Pierre- Joseph Proudhon. No Gods, No Masters: An Anthology of Anarchism. Edited by Daniel Guerin, translated by Paul Sharkey. 2005. AK Press. p. 55-56  Similar phrases  Jacques Pierre Brissot had previously written, in his Philosophical Inquiries on the Right of Property (Recherches philosophiques sur le droit de propriété et le vol), \\"Exclusive property is a robbery in nature.\\"William Shepard Walsh, Handy-book of Literary Curiosities, p. 923 Marx would later write in an 1865 letter to a contemporary that Proudhon had taken the slogan from Warville,Karl Marx, \\"Letter to J. B. Schweizer\\", from Marx Engels Selected Works, Volume 2, first published in Der Social-Demokrat, Nos. 16, 17 and 18, February 1, 3 and 5, 1865 (that is, from Brissot(where it is understood that \\"Warville\\" is another name for 'Brissot'; see, e.g., Jean Pierre Brissot de Warville)) although this is contested by subsequent scholarship. The phrase also appears in 1797 in the Marquis de Sade's text L'Histoire de Juliette: \\"Tracing the right of property back to its source, one infallibly arrives at usurpation. However, theft is only punished because it violates the right of property; but this right is itself nothing in origin but theft\\".Marquis de Sade, Juliette, 1797 Similar phrases also appear in the works of Saint Ambrose, who taught that superfluum quod tenes tu furaris (the superfluous property which you hold you have stolen) and Basil of Caesarea (Ascetics, 34, 1–2). Jean-Jacques Rousseau made the same general point when he wrote: \\"The first man who, having enclosed a piece of ground, bethought himself of saying 'This is mine', and found people simple enough to believe him, was the real founder of civil society. From how many crimes, wars, and murders, from how many horrors and misfortunes might not any one have saved mankind, by pulling up the stakes, or filling up the ditch, and crying to his fellows: Beware of listening to this impostor; you are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us all, and the earth itself to nobody.\\"Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Discourse on Inequality, 1754 Irish Marxist James Connolly referred to the socialist movement as the \\"Great Anti-Theft Movement of the Twentieth Century.\\"James Connolly, Socialism Made Easy, 1909.  Criticism  Karl Marx, although initially favourable to Proudhon's work, later criticised, among other things, the expression \\"property is theft\\" as self-refuting and unnecessarily confusing, writing that theft' as a forcible violation of property presupposes the existence of property\\" and condemning Proudhon for entangling himself in \\"all sorts of fantasies, obscure even to himself, about true bourgeois property\\". Max Stirner was highly critical of Proudhon, and in his work, The Ego and Its Own, made the same criticism of Proudhon's expression before Marx, asking, \\"Is the concept 'theft' at all possible unless one allows validity to the concept 'property'? How can one steal if property is not already extant? ... Accordingly property is not theft, but a theft becomes possible only through property.\\"Stirner, Max. The Ego and Its Own. Edited by David Leopold. p. 223  Footnotes  I.

Proudhon, who was born in Besançon, was a printer who taught himself Latin in order to better print books in the language. His best-known assertion is that \\"property is theft!\\", contained in his first major work, What Is Property? Or, an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and Government (Qu'est-ce que la propriété? Recherche sur le principe du droit et du gouvernement), published in 1840. The book's publication attracted the attention of the French authorities. It also attracted the scrutiny of Karl Marx, who started a correspondence with its author. The two influenced each other and they met in Paris while Marx was exiled there. Their friendship finally ended when Marx responded to Proudhon's The System of Economic Contradictions, or The Philosophy of Poverty with the provocatively titled The Poverty of Philosophy. The dispute became one of the sources of the split between the anarchist and Marxist wings of the International Working Men's Association. Some such as Edmund Wilson have contended that Marx's attack on Proudhon had its origin in the latter's defense of Karl Grün, whom Marx bitterly disliked, but who had been preparing translations of Proudhon's work.Hoffman, Robert (May 1967). \\"Marx and Proudhon: A Reappraisal of Their Relationship\\".

A Popular History of France from the First Revolution to the Present Time. D. Estes and C. E. Lauria. p. 189. After the death of Proudhon's follower Mikhail Bakunin, Proudhon's libertarian socialism diverged into anarcho-communism, collectivist anarchism and individualist anarchism, with notable proponents such as Carlo Cafiero, Joseph Déjacque, Peter Kropotkin and Benjamin Tucker.  Biography = Early life and education  Proudhon was born in Besançon, France, on 15 January 1809 at 23 Rue du Petit Battant in the suburb of Battant. His father Claude-François Proudhon, who worked as a brewer and a cooper, was originally from the village of Chasnans, near the border with Switzerland. His mother Catherine Simonin was from Cordiron. Claude-François and Catherine had five boys together, two of whom died at a very young age. Proudhon's brothers Jean-Etienne and Claude were born in 1811 and 1816 respectively and both maintained a very close relationship with Proudhon. As a boy, he mostly worked in the family tavern, helped with basic agricultural work and spent time playing outdoors in the countryside. Proudhon received no formal education as a child, but he was taught to read by his mother, who had him spelling words by age three. However, the only books that Proudhon was exposed to until he was 10 were the Gospels and the Four Aymon Brothers and some local almanacs. In 1820, Proudhon's mother began trying to get him admitted into the city college in Besançon. The family was far too poor to afford the tuition, but with the help of one of Claude-François' former employers she managed to gain a bursary which deducted 120 francs a year from the cost. Proudhon was unable to afford books (or even shoes) to attend school which caused him great difficulties and often made him the object of scorn by his wealthier classmates. In spite of this, Proudhon showed a strong will to learn and spent much time in the school library with a pile of books, exploring a variety of subjects in his free time outside of class.  Entrance into the printing trade  In 1827, Proudhon began an apprenticeship at a printing press in the house of Bellevaux in Battant. On Easter of the following year, he transferred to a press in Besançon owned by the family of one of his schoolmates, Antoine Gauthier. Besançon was an important center of religious thought at the time and most of the works published at Gauthier were ecclesiastical works. During the course of his work, Proudhon spent hours every day reading this Christian literature and began to question many of his long held religious beliefs which eventually led him to reject Christianity altogether. Over the years, Proudhon rose to be a corrector for the press, proofreading their publications. By 1829, he began to become more interested in social issues than religious theory. Of particular importance during this period was his encounter with Charles Fourier, who in 1829 came to Gauthier as a customer seeking to publish his work Le Nouveau Monde Industriel et Sociétaire. Proudhon supervised the printing of the book, which gave him ample opportunity to talk with Fourier about a variety of social and philosophical issues. These discussions left a strong impression on Proudhon and influenced him throughout his life. It was also during this time that Proudhon formed one of his closest friendships with Gustave Fallot, a scholar from Montebéliard who came from a family of wealthy French industrialists. Impressed by Proudhon's corrections of one of his Latin manuscripts, Fallot sought out his friendship and the two were soon regularly spending their evenings together discussing French literature by Michel de Montaigne, François Rabelais, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Voltaire, Denis Diderot and many other authors to whom Proudhon had not been exposed during his years of theological readings.  Decision to pursue philosophy and writing  The house in Besançon in which Proudhon was born In September 1830, Proudhon became certified as a journeyman compositor. The period following this was marked by unemployment and poverty, with Proudhon travelling around France (also briefly to Neuchâtel, Switzerland) where he unsuccessfully sought stable employment in printing and as a schoolteacher. During this period, Fallot offered financial assistance to Proudhon if he came to Paris to study philosophy. Proudhon accepted his offer despite concerns about how it might disrupt his career in the printing trade. He walked from Besançon to Paris, arriving in March at the Rue Mazarin in the Latin Quarter, where Fallot was living at the time. Proudhon began mingling amongst the circle of metropolitan scholars surrounding Fallot, but he felt out of place and uncomfortable amidst people who were both wealthier and more accustomed to scholarly debate. Ultimately, Proudhon found that he preferred to spend the majority of his time studying alone and was not fond of urban life, longing to return home to Besançon. The cholera outbreak in Paris granted him his wish as Fallot was struck with the illness, making him unable to financially support Proudhon any longer. After Proudhon left, he never saw Fallot (who died in 1836) again. However, this friendship was one of the most important events in Proudhon's life as it is what motivated him to leave the printing trade and pursue his studies of philosophy instead. After an unsuccessful printing business venture in 1838, Proudhon decided to dedicate himself fully to scholarly pursuits. He applied for the Suard Pension, a bursary that would enable him to study at the Academy of Besançon. Proudhon was selected out of several candidates primarily due to the fact that his income was much lower than the others and the judges were extremely impressed by his writing and the level of education he had given himself while working as an artisan. Proudhon arrived in Paris towards the end of autumn in 1838.  Early writings  In 1839, the Academy of Besançon held an essay competition on the subject of the utility of the celebration of Sunday in regard to hygiene, morality and the relationship of the family and the city. Proudhon's entry, titled De la Célébration du dimanche, essentially used the essay subject as a pretext for discussing a variety of political and philosophical ideas and in it one can find the seeds of his later revolutionary ideas. Many of his ideas on authority, morality and property disturbed the essay judges at the Academy and Proudhon was only awarded the bronze medal (something in which Proudhon took pride because he felt that this was an indicator that his writing made elite academics uncomfortable). In 1840, Proudhon published his first work Qu'est-ce que la propriété?, or What Is Property? His third memoir on property was a letter to the Fourierist writer Considérant, published in 1842 under the title Warning to Proprietors. Proudhon was tried for it at Besançon, but he was acquitted when the jury found that they could not condemn him for a philosophy that they themselves could not understand.\\"Pierre-Joseph Proudhon\\". Encyclopedia Britannica. In 1846, he published the Système des contradictions économiques ou Philosophie de la misère (The System of Economic Contradictions, or The Philosophy of Poverty) which prompted a book-length critique from Karl Marx entitled The Poverty of Philosophy, commencing a rift between anarchism and Marxism and anarchists and Marxists that would be continued by the Bakuninists and collectivist anarchists (the followers of Mikhail Bakunin) in the First International and that lasts to this day. For some time, Proudhon ran a small printing establishment at Besançon, but without success. Afterwards, he became connected as a kind of manager with a commercial firm in Lyon, France. In 1847, he left this job and finally settled in Paris, where he was now becoming celebrated as a leader of innovation. In this year, he also became a Freemason.Henri du Bac. The Un-Marxian Socialist: A Study of Proudhon . New York: Sheed and Ward, 1848. p. 9.  Revolution of 1848  Proudhon and His Children by Gustave Courbet, 1865 Proudhon was surprised by the Revolutions of 1848 in France. He participated in the February uprising and the composition of what he termed \\"the first republican proclamation\\" of the new republic, but he had misgivings about the new provisional government headed by Jacques- Charles Dupont de l'Eure (1767–1855), who since the French Revolution in 1789 had been a longstanding politician, although often in the opposition. Beside Dupont de l'Eure, the provisional government was dominated by liberals such as Alphonse de Lamartine (Foreign Affairs), Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin (Interior), Adolphe Crémieux (Justice) and Auguste Burdeau (War) because it was pursuing political reform at the expense of the socio-economic reform, which Proudhon considered basic. As during the 1830 July Revolution, the Republican-Socialist Party had set up a counter-government in the Hotel de Ville, including Louis Blanc, Armand Marrast, Ferdinand Flocon and Alexandre Martin. Proudhon published his own perspective for reform which was completed in 1849, Solution du problème social (Solution of the Social Problem), in which he laid out a program of mutual financial cooperation among workers. He believed this would transfer control of economic relations from capitalists and financiers to workers. The central part of his plan was the establishment of a bank to provide credit at a very low rate of interest and the issuing of exchange notes that would circulate instead of money based on gold. During the Second French Republic (1848–1852), Proudhon had his biggest public effect through journalism. He got involved with four newspapers, namely Le Représentant du Peuple (February 1848–August 1848), Le Peuple (September 1848–June 1849), La Voix du Peuple (September 1849–May 1850) and Le Peuple de 1850 (June 1850–October 1850). His polemical writing style, combined with his perception of himself as a political outsider, produced a cynical combative journalism that appealed to many French workers, but alienated others. He repeatedly criticised the government's policies and promoted reformation of credit and exchange. He tried to establish a popular bank (Banque du peuple) early in 1849, but despite over 13,000 people signing up (mostly workers) receipts were limited falling short of 18,000FF and the whole enterprise was essentially stillborn. Proudhon ran for the Constituent Assembly in April 1848, but he was not elected although his name appeared on the ballots in Paris, Lyon, Besançon and Lille. He was successful, in the complementary elections of 4 June 1848 and served as a deputy during the debates over the National Workshops, created by the 25 February 1848 decree passed by Republican Louis Blanc. The workshops were to give work to the unemployed. Proudhon was never enthusiastic about such workshops, perceiving them to be essentially charitable institutions that did not resolve the problems of the economic system. However, he was against their elimination unless an alternative could be found for the workers who relied on the workshops for subsistence. In 1848, the closing of the National Workshops provoked the June Days uprising and the violence shocked Proudhon. Visiting the barricades personally, he later reflected that his presence at the Bastille at this time was \\"one of the most honorable acts of my life\\", but in general during the tumultuous events of 1848 he opposed insurrection by preaching peaceful conciliation, a stance that was in accord with his lifelong stance against violence. Proudhon disapproved of the revolts and demonstrations of February, May and June 1848, though he was sympathetic to the social and psychological injustices that the insurrectionists had been forced to endure. In Spain, Ramón de la Sagra established the anarchist journal El Porvenir in La Coruña in 1845 which was inspired by Proudhon's ideas. Catalan politician Francesc Pi i Margall became the principal translator of Proudhon's works into SpanishGeorge Woodcock. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. p. 357. and later briefly became President of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the Federal Democratic Republican Party. According to George Woodcock, \\"[t]hese translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860s\\".George Woodcock. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. p. 357 According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, \\"[d]uring the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi i Margall attempted to establish a decentralized, or 'cantonalist,' political system on Proudhonian lines\\".  Later life and death  Proudhon was arrested for insulting President Louis- Napoléon Bonaparte and was imprisoned from 1849 to 1852. After his release, he remained in exile from 1858 to 1862 in Belgium. Upon the liberalization of the empire in 1863, he returned to France. Proudhon died in Passy on 19 January 1865 and was buried in Paris at the cemetery of Montparnasse.Property is Theft!  Philosophy = Anarchism  According to Mikhail Bakunin, Proudhon was the first person to refer to himself as an \\"anarchist\\".Bush, Rod (2009). The End of White World Supremacy: Black Internationalism and the Problem of the Color Line. Philadelphia: Temple University Press. p. 226. .Eatwell, Roger; Wright, Anthony (199). Contemporary Political Ideologies: Second Edition. New York: Continuum International Publishing Group. p. 132. . Proudhon's anarchist mutualism is considered as a middle way or synthesis between individualist anarchism and social anarchism. According to Larry Gambone, Proudhon was a \\"social individualist anarchist\\". Both anarcho- communist Peter Kropotkin and individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker defined anarchism as \\"the no-government form of socialism\\" and \\"the abolition of the State and the abolition of usury\\", respectively. In this, Kropotkin and Tucker were following the definition of Proudhon, who stated that \\"[w]e do not admit the government of man by man any more than the exploitation of man by man.\\"Marshall, Peter (2009). Demanding the Impossible: A History of Anarchism. Oakland: PM Press. p. 244–245. . In What Is Property?, published in 1840, Proudhon defined anarchy as \\"the absence of a master, of a sovereign\\" and wrote that \\"[a]s man seeks justice in equality, so society seeks order in anarchy\\".Larned, Josephus Nelson (1922). The New Larned History for Ready Reference, Reading and Research. C.A. Nichols Publishing Company. pp. 336–337. In 1849, Proudhon declared in Confessions of a Revolutionary that \\"[w]hoever lays his hand on me to govern me is a usurper and tyrant, and I declare him my enemy\\".Gray, Alexander (1946). The Socialist Tradition: Moses to Lenin (reprinted ed.). Auburn: Mises Institute. p. 246. . In The General Idea of the Revolution (1851), Proudhon urged a \\"society without authority\\". In a subchapter called \\"What is Government?\\", Proudhon wrote: Towards the end of his life, Proudhon modified some of his earlier views. In The Principle of Federation (1863), Proudhon modified his earlier anti-state position, arguing for \\"the balancing of authority by liberty\\" and put forward a decentralized \\"theory of federal government\\". Proudhon also defined anarchy differently as \\"the government of each by himself\\" which meant \\"that political functions have been reduced to industrial functions, and that social order arises from nothing but transactions and exchanges\\". This work also saw Proudhon call his economic system an \\"agro-industrial federation\\", arguing that it would provide \\"specific federal arrangements [...] to protect the citizens of the federated states from capitalist and financial feudalism, both within them and from the outside\\" and so stop the re-introduction of \\"wage labour\\". This was because \\"political right requires to be buttressed by economic right\\". In the posthumously published Theory of Property, Proudhon argued that \\"property is the only power that can act as a counterweight to the State\\". Hence, \\"Proudhon could retain the idea of property as theft, and at the same time offer a new definition of it as liberty. There is the constant possibility of abuse, exploitation, which spells theft. At the same time property is a spontaneous creation of society and a bulwark against the ever-encroaching power of the State.\\"Copleston, Frederick (1994). Social Philosophy in France. A History of Philosophy. IX. New York: Image/Doubleday. p. 67. Noam Chomsky criticized Proudhon's later life by stating that \\"[m]any of these masters were not anarchists throughout their lives and their complete works include passages which have nothing to do with anarchism. To take an example: in the second part of his career Proudhon's thinking took a conservative turn. His verbose and monumental De la Justice dans la Revolution et dans l'Eglise (1858) was mainly concerned with the problem of religion and its conclusion was far from libertarian.\\"Chomsky, Noam (1970). \\"Preface\\". In Guérin, Daniel. Anarchism: From Theory to Practice. Translated by Klopper, Mary. New York: New York University Press. .  Dialectics  In What Is Property?, Proudhon moved on from the rejection of communism and private property in a dialectical manner, looking for a \\"third form of society. [...] This third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property, we will call liberty.\\"Proudhon, Pierre- Joseph; McKay, Iain, ed. (2011). Property is Theft!: A Pierre-Joseph Proudhon Anthology? (illustrated revised ed.). Oakland: AK Press. p. 136. . In his System of Economic Contradiction, Proudhon described mutuality as \\"the synthesis of the notions of private property and collective ownership.\\"Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. System of Economic Contraditions. I. pp. 410–411.Lichtheim, George (1975). A Short History of Socialism. p.76. Proudhon's rejection of compulsory communism and privileged property led him towards a synthesis of libertarian communism and possession, just as the apparent contradiction between his theories of property represents an antimony which still needs synthesizing. Proudhon stated that in presenting the \\"property is liberty\\" theory, he is not changing his mind about the earlier \\"property is theft\\" definition. Proudhon did not only rely on \\"synthesis\\", but also emphasized \\"balance\\" between approaches such as communism and property that apparently cannot be fully reconciled. American mutualist William Batchelder Greene took a similar approach in his 1849–1850 works.Wilbur, Shawn P. (2018). \\"Mutualism\\". In Adams, Matthew S.; Levy, Carl. The Palgrave Handbook of Anarchism. Springer. pp. 213–224. .  Free association  For Proudhon, mutualism involved free association by creating industrial democracy, a system where workplaces would be \\"handed over to democratically organised workers' associations. [...] We want these associations to be models for agriculture, industry and trade, the pioneering core of that vast federation of companies and societies woven into the common cloth of the democratic social Republic.\\" Under mutualism, workers would no longer sell their labour to a capitalist but rather work for themselves in co-operatives. Proudhon urged \\"workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with equal conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism\\". This would result in \\"[c]apitalistic and proprietary exploitation, stopped everywhere, the wage system abolished, equal and just exchange guaranteed\\".Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph (1989) [1851]. The General Idea of the Revolution. Translated by Robinson, John Beverley. London: Pluto Press. pp. 277–281. . As Robert Graham notes, \\"Proudhon's market socialism is indissolubly linked to his notions of industrial democracy and workers' self- management\\".Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph (1989) [1851]. \\"Introduction\\". The General Idea of the Revolution. Translated by Robinson, John Beverley. London: Pluto Press. p. xxxii. . K. Steven Vincent notes in his in-depth analysis of this aspect of Proudhon's ideas that \\"Proudhon consistently advanced a program of industrial democracy which would return control and direction of the economy to the workers\\". For Proudhon, \\"strong workers' associations [...] would enable the workers to determine jointly by election how the enterprise was to be directed and operated on a day-to-day basis\\".Vincent, K. Steven (1984). Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the Rise of French Republican Socialism. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 156, 230. .  Mutualism  Proudhon adopted the term mutualism for his brand of anarchism and socialism which involved control of the means of production by the workers. In his vision, self- employed artisans, peasants and cooperatives would trade their products on the market. For Proudhon, factories and other large workplaces would be run by \\"labor associations\\" operating on directly democratic principles. The state would be abolished and instead society would be organized by a federation of \\"free communes\\" (a commune is a local municipality in French). In 1863, Proudhon wrote: \\"All my economic ideas as developed over twenty-five years can be summed up in the words: agricultural-industrial federation. All my political ideas boil down to a similar formula: political federation or decentralization\\".Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph (1863). Du principe Fédératif [Principle of Federation]. Proudhon's grave in Paris Proudhon called this use- ownership possession (possession) and this economic system mutualism (mutualisme), having many arguments against entitlement to land and capital, including reasons based on morality, economics, politics and individual liberty. One such argument was that it enabled profit which in turn led to social instability and war by creating cycles of debt that eventually overcame the capacity of labor to pay them off. Another was that it produced despotism and turned workers into wage workers subject to the authority of a boss. In What Is Property?, Proudhon described the liberty he pursued as \\"the synthesis of communism and property\\", further writing: Proudhon continued to oppose both capitalist and state property. In Theory of Property, Proudhon maintained that \\"[n]ow in 1840, I categorically rejected the notion of property for both the group and the individual\\", but then he also states his new theory of property that \\"property is the greatest revolutionary force which exists, with an unequaled capacity for setting itself against authority\\" and the \\"principal function of private property within the political system will be to act as a counterweight to the power of the State, and by so doing to insure the liberty of the individual\\". However, the authors of An Anarchist FAQ write that \\"this is a common anarchist position. Anarchists are well aware that possession is a source of independence within capitalism and so should be supported\\". At the same time, Proudhon continued to oppose concentrations of wealth and property, arguing for small-scale property ownership associated with peasants and artisans. Proudhon also still opposed private property in land, writing: \\"What I cannot accept, regarding land, is that the work put in gives a right to ownership of what has been worked on.\\" In addition, Proudhon still believed that property should be more equally distributed and limited in size to that actually used by individuals, families and workers associations.Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. \\"Theory of Property\\".

(2006). No Gods, No Masters. 1. Oakland: AK Press. p. 62. . As a consequence of his opposition to profit, wage labour, worker exploitation, ownership of land and capital as well as to state property, Proudhon rejected both capitalism and state socialism, including authoritarian socialism and other authoritarian and compulsory forms of communism which advocated state property. The authors of An Anarchist FAQ argue that his opposition to \\"communism\\" was because \\"libertarian communism\\", while having some forerunners such as François-Noël Babeuf, would not be as widespread until after his death and so, like Max Stirner, \\"he was directing his critique against the various forms of state communism which did [exist]\\". While opposed to the charging of interest and rent, Proudhon did not seek to abolish them by law, writing: \\"I protest that when I criticized the complex of institutions of which property is the foundation stone, I never meant to forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital. I think that all these manifestations of human activity should remain free and voluntary for all: I ask for them no modifications, restrictions or suppressions, other than those which result naturally and of necessity from the universalization of the principle of reciprocity which I propose.\\"Cohen, Henry, ed. (1927). Proudhon's Solution of the Social Problem. New York: Vanguard Press.  Nationalism  Proudhon opposed dictatorship, militarism, nationalism and war, arguing that the \\"end of militarism is the mission of the nineteenth century, under pain of indefinite decadence\\"Woodcock, George. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. p. 233. and that the \\"workers alone are capable of putting an end to war by creating economic equilibrium. This presupposes a radical revolution in ideas and morals.\\"Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. p. 214. As Robert L. Hoffman notes, War and Peace \\"ends by condemning war without reservation\\" and its \\"conclusion [is] that war is obsolete\\".Hoffman, Robert L. Revolutionary Justice. pp. 210–211. Marxist philosopher John Ehrenberg summarized Proudhon's position that \\"[i]f injustice was the cause of war, it followed that conflict could not be eliminated until society was reorganised along egalitarian lines. Proudhon had wanted to prove that the reign of political economy would be the reign of peace, finding it difficult to believe that people really thought he was defending militarism.\\"Ehremberg, John. Proudhon and His Age. p. 145. Proudhon argued that under mutualism \\"[t]here will no longer be nationality, no longer fatherland, in the political sense of the words: they will mean only places of birth. Man, of whatever race or colour he may be, is an inhabitant of the universe; citizenship is everywhere an acquired right.\\"Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century. p. 283. Proudhon also rejected dictatorship, stating in the 1860s that \\"what I will always be [...] a republican, a democrat even, and a socialist into the bargain\\".Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. p. 201. Henri-Marie de Lubac argued that in terms of Proudhon's critique of democracy \\"we must not allow all this to hoodwink us. His invectives against democracy were not those of a counter-revolutionary. They were aimed at what he himself called 'the false democracy'. [...] They attacked an apparently liberal 'pseudo-democracy' which 'was not economic and social', [...] 'a Jacobinical democracy.'\\" Proudhon \\"did not want to destroy, but complete, the work of 1789\\" and while \\"he had a grudge against the 'old democracy', the democracy of Robespierre and Marat\\", he repeatedly contrasted it \\"with a 'young democracy', which was a 'social democracy.'\\"De Lubac, Henri-Marie. The Un-Marxian Socialist: A Study of Proudhon. pp. 28–29. According to historian of anarchism George Woodcock, some positions Proudhon took \\"sorted oddly with his avowed anarchism\\". Woodcock cited as an example Proudhon's proposition that each citizen perform one or two years militia service.Woodcock, George (1987). Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: A Biography (revised ed.). Montreal: Black Rose Books. p. 128. . The proposal appeared in the Programme Revolutionaire, an electoral manifesto issued by Proudhon after he was asked to run for a position in the provisional government. The text reads: \\"7° 'L'armée. – Abolition immédiate de la conscription et des remplacements; obligation pour tout citoyen de faire, pendant un ou deux ans, le service militaire; application de l'armée aux services administratifs et travaux d'utilité publique\\" (\\"Military service by all citizens is proposed as an alternative to conscription and the practice of 'replacement', by which those who could avoided such service\\"). In the same document, Proudhon also described the \\"form of government\\" he was proposing as \\"a centralization analogous with that of the State, but in which no one obeys, no one is dependent, and everyone is free and sovereign\\".Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph (1868). \\"Programme révolutionnaire\\". Mélanges. Tome I. Paris: Lacroix. pp. 70–72.  Private property and the state  Proudhon saw the privileged property as a form of government and that it was necessarily backed by and interlinked with the state, writing that \\"[t]he private property of privilege called forth and commanded the State\\" and arguing that \\"since the first related to the landowner and capitalist whose ownership derived from conquest or exploitation and was only maintained through the state, its property laws, police and army\\". Hence, Proudhon distinguished between personal property and possessions (possession) and private property (propriété), i.e. productive property while the former having direct use-value to the individual possessing it.Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph; McKay, Iain, ed. (2011). Property is Theft!: A Pierre-Joseph Proudhon Anthology? (illustrated revised ed.). Oakland: AK Press. p. 91. . \\"From the distinction between possession and property arise two sorts of rights: the jus in re, the right in a thing, the right by which I may reclaim the property which I have acquired, in whatever hands I find it; and the jus ad rem, the right to a thing, which gives me a claim to become a proprietor. Thus the right of the partners to a marriage over each other's person is the jus in re; that of two who are betrothed is only the jus ad rem. In the first, possession and property are united; the second includes only naked property. With me who, as a laborer, have a right to the possession of the products of Nature and my own industry, — and who, as a proletaire, enjoy none of them, — it is by virtue of the jus ad rem that I demand admittance to the jus in re.\\" Unlike capitalist property supporters, Proudhon stressed equality and thought that all workers should own property and have access to capital, stressing that in every cooperative \\"every worker employed in the association [must have] an undivided share in the property of the company\\".Proudhon, Pierre- Joseph; McKay, Iain, ed. (2011). Property is Theft!: A Pierre-Joseph Proudhon Anthology? (illustrated revised ed.). Oakland: AK Press. p. 12. . In his later works, Proudhon used property to mean possession. This resulted in some individualist anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker calling possession as property or private property, causing confusion within the anarchist movement and among other socialists.The Anarchist FAQ Collective; McKay, Ian, ed. (2008/2012). \\"Anarchism and 'anarcho'-capitalism\\". An Anarchist Faq. I/II. Oakland/Edinburgh: AK Press. . . . \\"Tucker and Bakunin both shared Proudhon's opposition to private property (in the capitalist sense of the word), although Tucker confused this opposition (and possibly the casual reader) by talking about possession as 'property.'\\" In his earliest works, Proudhon analyzed the nature and problems of the capitalist economy. While deeply critical of capitalism, Proudhon also objected to those contemporary in the socialist movement who advocated centralized hierarchical forms of association or state control of the economy. In a sequence of commentaries from What Is Property? (1840), posthumously published in the Théorie de la propriété (Theory of Property, 1863–1864), Proudhon declared in turn that \\"property is theft\\", \\"property is impossible\\", \\"property is despotism\\" and \\"property is freedom\\". When saying that \\"property is theft\\", Proudhon was referring to the landowner or capitalist who he believed \\"stole\\" the profits from laborers. For Proudhon, as he wrote in the sixth study of his General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century,Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph (1851). General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century.

Property is Theft!: A Pierre-Joseph Proudhon Anthology? (illustrated revised ed.). Oakland: AK Press. p. 583. . In What Is Property?, Proudhon also wrote: > Property is physically and mathematically impossible. > Property is impossible, because it demands something for nothing. > Property is impossible because wherever it exists production costs more > than it is worth. > Property is impossible, because, with a given capital, production is > proportional to labor, not to property. > Property is impossible, because it is homicide. > Yes, I have attacked property, and shall attack it again. > Property is robbery. > The people finally legalized property.

The Gift of Property: Having the > Good/Betraying Genitivity, Economy and Ecology, An Ethic of the Earth > (illustrated ed.). New York: SUNY Press. p. 67. . Proudhon believed that illegitimate property was based on dominion (i.e. entitlement) and that this was backed by force. While this force can take the form of police in the employ of a state, it is the fact of its enforcement, not its form, that makes it what it is. Proudhon rejected entitlement regardless of the source and accepted possession based on occupancy. According to Proudhon, \\"[t]here are different kinds of property: 1. Property pure and simple, the dominant and seigniorial power over a thing; or, as they term it, naked property. 2. Possession. 'Possession,' says Duranton, 'is a matter of fact, not of right.' Toullier: 'Property is a right, a legal power; possession is a fact.' The tenant, the farmer, the commandité, the usufructuary, are possessors; the owner who lets and lends for use, the heir who is to come into possession on the death of a usufructuary, are proprietors.\\"Proudhon, Pierre- Joseph; McKay, Iain, ed. (2011). Property is Theft!: A Pierre-Joseph Proudhon Anthology? (illustrated revised ed.). Oakland: AK Press. p. 91. . In Confessions of a Revolutionary, Proudhon also wrote: In asserting that property is freedom, Proudhon was referring not only to the product of an individual's labor, but also to the peasant or artisan's home and tools of his trade and the income he received by selling his goods. For Proudhon, the only legitimate source of property is labor. What one produces is one's property and anything beyond that is not. Proudhon advocated workers' self-management and was opposed to the private ownership of the means of production. In 1848, Proudhon wrote: Proudhon also warned that a society with private property would lead to statist relations between people,Bojicic, Savo (2010). America America or Is It? Bloomington: AuthorHouse. p. 369. . arguing: > The purchaser draws boundaries, fences himself in, and says, 'This is mine; > each one by himself, each one for himself.'

According to Proudhon, \\"[t]he proprietor, the robber, the hero, the sovereign — for all these titles are synonymous — imposes his will as law, and suffers neither contradiction nor control; that is, he pretends to be the legislative and the executive power at once [...] [and so] property engenders despotism. [...] That is so clearly the essence of property that, to be convinced of it, one need but remember what it is, and observe what happens around him. Property is the right to use and abuse. [...] [I]f goods are property, why should not the proprietors be kings, and despotic kings — kings in proportion to their facultes bonitaires? And if each proprietor is sovereign lord within the sphere of his property, absolute king throughout his own domain, how could a government of proprietors be any thing but chaos and confusion?\\"Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph; McKay, Iain, ed. (2011). Property is Theft!: A Pierre-Joseph Proudhon Anthology? (illustrated revised ed.). Oakland: AK Press. p. 135. .  Property  George Crowder writes that the property anarchists including Proudhon oppose \\"is basically that which is unearned\\", i.e. \\"such things as interest on loans and income from rent. This is contrasted with ownership rights in those goods either produced by the work of the owner or necessary for that work, for example his dwelling-house, land and tools. Proudhon initially refers to legitimate rights of ownership of these goods as 'possession,' and although in his latter work he calls this 'property,' the conceptual distinction remains the same.\\"Crowder, George (1991). Classical Anarchism: The Political Thought of Godwin, Proudhon, Bakunin, and Kropotkin. Oxford: Clarendon Press. pp. 85–86. . According to George Woodcock, \\"Proudhon did not mean literally what he said. His boldness of expression was intended for emphasis, and by 'property' he wished to be understood what he later called 'the sum of its abuses'. He was denouncing the property of the man who uses it to exploit the labour of others without any effort on his own part, property distinguished by interest and rent, by the impositions of the non- producer on the producer. Towards property regarded as 'possession' the right of a man to control his dwelling and the land and tools he needs to live, Proudhon had no hostility; indeed, he regarded it as the cornerstone of liberty, and his main criticism of the communists was that they wished to destroy it.\\"Hargreaves, David H. London (2019). Beyond Schooling: An Anarchist Challenge. London: Routledge. pp. 90–91. . Late in his life, Proudhon argued for increasing the powers of government while also strengthening property, by making it more egalitarian and widespread, in order to counter-balance it. Iain McKay points out that \\"Proudhon's 'emphasis on the genuine antagonism between state power and property rights' came from his later writings, in which he argued that property rights were required to control state power. In other words, this 'heterodoxy' came from a period in which Proudhon did not think that state could be abolished and so 'property is the only power that can act as a counterweight to the State.' Of course, this 'later' Proudhon also acknowledged that property was 'an absolutism within an absolutism,' 'by nature autocratic' and that its 'politics could be summed up in a single word,' namely 'exploitation.'\\" McKay further writes how \\"Proudhon argues that 'spread[ing] it more equally and establish[ing] it more firmly in society' is the means by which 'property' 'becomes a guarantee of liberty and keeps the State on an even keel.' In other words, rather than 'property' as such limiting the state, it is 'property' divided equally through society which is the key, without concentrations of economic power and inequality which would result in exploitation and oppression. Therefore, '[s]imple justice... requires that equal division of land shall not only operate at the outset. If there is to be no abuse, it must be maintained from generation to generation.'\\" David Hargreaves writes that \\"[i]ronically, Proudhon did not mean literally what he said. His boldness of expression was intended for emphasis, and by 'property' he wished to be understood what he later called 'the sum of its abuses'. He was denouncing the property of the man who uses it to exploit the labour of others without any effort on his own part, property distinguished by interest and rent, by the impositions of the non-producer on the producer. Towards property regarded as 'possession' the right of a man to control his dwelling and the land and tools he needs to live, Proudhon had no hostility; indeed, he regarded it as the cornerstone of liberty, and his main criticism of the communists was that they wished to destroy it.\\"Hargreaves, David H. (2019). Beyond Schooling: An Anarchist Challenge. London: Routledge. pp. 90–91. . Nonetheless, communists ranging from Peter Kropotkin to Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels agreed with Proudhon's distinction and were not opposed to personal property, or what Proudhon called \\"possession\\", nor they wished to abolish it.  Revolution  While Proudhon was a revolutionary, his revolution did not mean civil war or violent upheaval, but rather the transformation of society. This transformation was essentially moral in nature and demanded the highest ethics from those who sought change. It was monetary reform, combined with organizing a credit bank and workers associations, that Proudhon proposed to use as a lever to bring about the organization of society along new lines. This ethical socialismHopper, John P. (1978). The Ethical Socialism of Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Proudhon.

Karl Polanyi: A Life on the Left. \\"Bourgeois Radicalism: A Hegemonic Project\\". New York: Columbia University Press. . James Boyle quotes Proudhon as stating that socialism is \\"every aspiration towards the amelioration of society\\" and then admitting that \\"we are all socialists\\" under this definition.Boyle, James (1912). What Is Socialism? The Shakespeare Press. p. 35. About the 1848 French Revolution and the Second French Republic, Proudhon took a radical stance regarding the National Workshops, criticized for being charity whilst criticizing the June Days Uprising for using violence.Darimon, Alfred; Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph (1849).

Librairie internationale.Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph (1872). Oeuvres complétes. 4. Proudhon's criticism of the February Revolution was that it was \\"without an idea\\" and considered some parts of the revolution too moderate and others too radical. According to Shawn Wilbur, those contradictions were caused by his dialectical phase with the System of Economic Contradictions and was prone to viewing nearly all his key concepts as being worked out in terms of irreducible contradictions. Although the revolutionary concept of dual power was first used by Vladimir Lenin, it was conceptually first outlined by Proudhon. According to Murray Bookchin, \\"Proudhon made the bright suggestion, in his periodical Le Représentant du peuple (April 28, 1848), that the mass democracy of the clubs could become a popular forum where the social agenda of the revolution could be prepared for use by the Constituent Assembly—a proposal that would essentially have defused the potency of the clubs as a potentially rebellious dual power.\\"Bookchin, Murray (1996). The Third Revolution: Popular Movements in the Revolutionary Era (illustrated ed.). 2. London: A&C; Black. p. 115. .  Socialism  Proudhon called himself a socialist, was recognized as one and still is. As one of the first theorists of libertarian socialism, Proudhon opposed state ownership of capital goods in favour of ownership by workers themselves in associations. Proudhon was one of the main influences on the theory of workers' self-management (autogestion) in the late 19th and 20th century. Proudhon strenuously rejected the ownership of the products of labor by capitalists or the state, arguing in What Is Property? that while \\"property in product [...] does not carry with it property in the means of production\\",Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph (1970). What Is Property? Dover. p. 109. \\"[t]he right to product is exclusive\\" and \\"the right to means is common\\". Proudhon applied this to the land (\\"the land is [...] a common thing\\")Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph (1970). What Is Property? Dover. p. 92. and workplaces (\\"all accumulated capital being social property, no one can be its exclusive proprietor\\").Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph (1970). What Is Property? Dover. p. 120. Proudhon argued that while society owned the means of production or land, users would control and run them (under supervision from society) with the \\"organising of regulating societies\\" in order to \\"regulate the market\\".Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. Selected Writings. p. 70. By the 1840s and 1850s, socialism came to cover a rather broad range. Proudhon's writings from the years following the French Revolution of 1848 are full of passages in which he associated himself with socialism, but he distanced from any particular system of socialist economics or type of socialism.Bestor, Arthur E. (June 1948). \\"The Evolution of the Socialist Vocabulary\\". Journal of the History of Ideas. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press. 9 (3): 259–302. . . As a broad concept, socialism is one or more of various theories aimed at solving the labor problem through radical changes in the capitalist economy. Descriptions of the problem, explanations of its causes and proposed solutions such as abolition of private property and support of either cooperatives, collective property, common property, public property or social property varied among socialist philosophies.Brooks, Frank H. (1994). The Individualist Anarchists: An Anthology of Liberty (1881–1908). Piscataway: Transaction Publishers. p. 75. . Proudhon made no public criticism of Karl Marx or Marxism because in Proudhon's lifetime Marx was relatively unknown. It was only after Proudhon's death that Marxism became a large movement. However, he criticized authoritarian and state socialists of his period. This included the French socialist Louis Blanc, of whom Proudhon said that \\"you desire neither Catholicism nor monarchy nor nobility, but you must have a God, a religion, a dictatorship, a censorship, a hierarchy, distinctions, and ranks. For my part, I deny your God, your authority, your sovereignty, your judicial State, and all your representative mystifications.\\" It was Proudhon's book What Is Property? that convinced the young Marx that private property should be abolished. In The Holy Family, one of his first works, Marx stated: \\"Not only does Proudhon write in the interest of the proletarians, he is himself a proletarian, an ouvrier. His work is a scientific manifesto of the French proletariat.\\" However, Marx disagreed with Proudhon's anarchism and later published a vicious criticism of Proudhon. Marx wrote The Poverty of Philosophy as a refutation of Proudhon's The Philosophy of Poverty. In their letters, Proudhon expressed disagreement with Marx's views on revolution, stating: \\"I believe we have no need of it in order to succeed; and that consequently we should not put forward revolutionary action as a means of social reform, because that pretended means would simply be an appeal to force, to arbitrariness, in brief, a contradiction.\\" More than Proudhon's anarchism, Marx did take issue with what he saw as Proudhon's misunderstanding of the relationship between labor, value and price as well as believing that Proudhon's attack on bourgeois property was framed in terms of bourgeois ethics rather than transcending these ethics altogether. Anarchists, among others, have since criticized Marx and Marxists for having distorced Proudhon's views. Iain McKay argues that Marx took many concepts such as his criticism of private property, scientific socialism and surplus value from Proudhon. Similarly, Rudolf Rocker argued that \\"we find 'the theory of surplus value, that grand 'scientific discovery' of which our Marxists are so proud of, in the writings of Proudhon.'\\" Edward Hyams summarized that \\"since [The Poverty of Philosophy] no good Marxists have had to think about Proudhon. They have what is mother's milk to them, an ex cathedra judgement.\\" In spite of their personal diatribes, Marx always maintained a certain respect for Proudhon, although this did not stop Marx from expelling Proudhon's follower Mikhail Bakunin (in spite of his criticism of Proudhon) and his supporters from the First International. In his obituary of Proudhon which was written on 24 January 1865, almost two decades after The Poverty of Philosophy, Marx called What Is Property? \\"epoch-making\\".Marx, Karl (February 1865). \\"On Proudhon\\".

Social ownership  While favoring individual ownership for small-property holdings, Proudhon advocated social ownership and worker cooperatives or smililar workers' associations and workers' councils. Proudhon advocated industrial democracy and repeatedly argued that the means of production and the land should be socialized. In What Is Property?, Proudhon wrote that \\"land is indispensable to our existence, consequently a common thing, consequently insusceptible of appropriation\\". In a letter to Louis Blanqui in 1841, Proudhon wrote that \\"all capital, whether material or mental, being the result of collective labour, is, in consequence, collective property\\". In his election manifesto for the 1848 French Constituent Assembly election, Proudhon wrote: > For this value or wealth, produced by the activity of all, is by the very > fact of its creation collective wealth, the use of which, like that of the > land, may be divided, but which as property remains undivided. [...] In > short, property in capital is indivisible, and consequently inalienable, not > necessarily when the capital is uncreated, but when it is common or > collective. [...] [T]his non-appropriation of the instruments of production > [...] I, in accordance with all precedent, call [...] a destruction of > property. In fact, without the appropriation of instruments, property is > nothing. In a letter to Pierre Leroux in 1849, Proudhon wrote: > Under the law of association, transmission of wealth does not apply to the > instruments of labour, so cannot become a cause of inequality. [...] We are > socialists [...] under universal association, ownership of the land and of > the instruments of labour is social ownership.

I deny it, precisely because I believe in an > order wherein the instruments of labour will cease to be appropriated and > instead become shared; where the whole earth will be depersonalised.  Controversy  Although long considered a founding father of anarchism, some have tried to link him to the extreme right. He was first used as a reference in the Cercle Proudhon, a right-wing association formed in 1911 by Georges Valois and Edouard Berth. Both had been brought together by the syndicalist Georges Sorel, but they would tend toward a synthesis of socialism and nationalism, mixing Proudhon's mutualism with Charles Maurras' integralist nationalism. In 1925, Georges Valois founded the Faisceau, the first fascist league, which took its name from Benito Mussolini's fasci. Zeev Sternhell, historian of fascism in particular of French fascists, noted this use of Proudhon by the far-right, stating: In response, K. Steven Vincent states that \\"to argue that Proudhon was a proto-fascist suggests that one has never looked seriously at Proudhon's writings\\".Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the Rise of French Republican Socialism, p. 234. Proudhon had great influence on the anarchist and non-anarchist socialist movement. In the United States, Proudhon was influential within radical progressive sectors and labour leaders, among them individualist anarchists such as Joseph Labadie, Dyer Lum and Benjamin Tucker. In France, Proudhon's influence on French socialism, including the Paris Commune, was surpassed by Marxist socialism only at the beginning of the XX century. Proudhonists made up an important French faction in the First International and Proudhon's thought strongly influenced debate in French and Belgian socialist circles long before the Cercle Proudhon. George Woodcock stated that \\"Sorel, whose ideas were most fully developed in his Reflections on Violence, had no direct connection with the syndicalist movement, and he was repudiated.\\"Woodcock, George (2004) [1962]. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements /reprint revised ed.). Toronto: Broadview Press. . In 1945, J. Salwyn Schapiro argued that Proudhon was a racist, \\"a glorifier of war for its own sake\\" and his \\"advocacy of personal dictatorship and his laudation of militarism can hardly be equalled in the reactionary writings of his or of our day\\". Other scholars have rejected Schapiro's claims. Robert Graham states that while Proudhon was personally racist, \\"anti- semitism formed no part of Proudhon's revolutionary programme\\".Graham, Robert. \\"Introduction\\".

Anarchist Albert Meltzer has argued that although Proudhon used the term anarchist, he was not one and that he never engaged in \\"anarchist activity or struggle\\", but rather in \\"parliamentary activity\\".Albert Meltzer. Anarchism: Arguments for and Against, AK Press, 2000, p. 12. Proudhon also engaged in an exchange of published letters between 1849 and 1850 with the French Liberal School economist Frédéric Bastiat discussing the legitimacy of interest. As Robert Leroux argued, Bastiat had the conviction that Proudhon's anti-interest doctrine \\"was the complete antithesis of any serious approach\\".Leroux, Robert. \\"Political Economy and Liberalism: The Economic Contribution of Frédéric Bastiat\\", Routledge, 2011, p. 118. Proudhon famously lost his temper and declared to Bastiat: \\"Your intelligence is asleep, or rather it has never been awake. You are a man for whom logic does not exist. You do not hear anything, you do not understand anything. You are without philosophy, without science, without humanity. Your ability to reason, like your ability to pay attention and make comparisons is zero. Scientifically, Mr. Bastiat, you are a dead man.\\"Roche, Charles George. \\"Frederic Bastiat: A Man Alone\\". Arlington House, 1971, p. 153.  Antisemitism and sexism  Stewart Edwards, the editor of the Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, remarks that \\"Proudhon's diaries (Carnets, ed. P. Haubtmann, Marcel Rivière, Paris 1960 to date) reveal that he had almost paranoid feelings of hatred against the Jews. In 1847, he considered publishing an article against the Jewish race, which he said he 'hated'. The proposed article would have \\"called for the expulsion of the Jews from France\\". It would have stated: \\"The Jew is the enemy of the human race. This race must be sent back to Asia, or exterminated. H. Heine, A.

In his Carnets (Notebooks), unpublished until the 1960s, Proudhon maintained that a woman's choice was to be \\"courtesan or housekeeper\\". To a woman, a man is \\"a father, a chief, a master: above all, a master\\". His justification for patriarchy is men's greater physical strength and recommended that men use this greater strength to keep women in their place, saying that \\"[a] woman does not at all hate being used with violence, indeed even being violated\\". In her study of Gustave Courbet, who painted the portrait of Proudhon and His Children (1865), art historian Linda Nochlin points out that alongside his early articulations of anarchism Proudhon also wrote La Pornocratie ou les femmes dans les temps modernes, described as \\"the most consistent anti-feminist tract of its time, or perhaps, any other\\" and which \\"raises all the main issues about woman's position in society and her sexuality with a paranoid intensity unmatched in any other text\\".Nochlin, Linda (2007). Courbet. Thames & Hudson. p. 220. n. 34. Proudhon's defenses of patriarchy did not go unchallenged in his lifetime and libertarian communist Joseph Déjacque attacked Proudhon's anti-feminism as a contradiction of anarchist principles. Déjacque directed Proudhon \\"either to 'speak out against man's exploitation of woman' or 'do not describe yourself as an anarchist'\\".Cohn, Jesse (2009). \\"Anarchism and gender\\".

Its services are delivered at community bases, hospitals, clinics and people's homes. The trust has close links to the universities of Oxford, Oxford Brookes, Buckinghamshire, Reading and Bath. They are part of the Oxford Academic Health Science Centre, working closely with university colleagues to translate their findings into clinical care as quickly as possible, enabling people using the services to benefit from the latest advances in healthcare. The trust has established a Street Triage scheme where mental health professionals work alongside police officers between 5pm and 4.30am every day so they can offer face-to-face advice, make accurate risk assessments and give care to the patient. It aims to avoid using custody as a place of safety and reduce the amount of time police officers spend on mental health incidents. Organisational history Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust was formed in February 2011 by the merger of Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust (OBMH) and Community Health Oxfordshire. Before becoming a NHS foundation trust on 1 April 2008 the trust was named Oxfordshire & Buckinghamshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust (OBMH). The partnership NHS Trust was formed on 1 April 2006 by the merger of Oxfordshire Mental Healthcare NHS Trust and Buckinghamshire Mental Health NHS Trust. Oxfordshire Mental Healthcare NHS Trust had been established in April 1994, and Buckinghamshire Mental Health NHS Trust in April 2001. History Since April 2010, OBMH has provided tiers 3 and 4 of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) in Wiltshire and Bath and North East Somerset following a competitive tender. Previously this service had been operated by three providers, though primarily the Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust. The service is jointly funded by the NHS and local authorities. The Oxfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group established a five year outcome based contract with the trust in September 2015. 20% of the funding will be based on seven outcomes: *People living longer *People more able to function *Timely access to support *Carers feeling supported *People having a meaningful role in society *People having stable accommodation *People having improved physical health In July 2016 it was announced that the trust would take over community learning disability services in Oxfordshire from Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust as part of a plan to reduce the area served by Southern.
