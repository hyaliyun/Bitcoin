Hoffman and Associates =Theodore Hoffman= (Daniel Benzali) The head of the firm, and a respected veteran defense attorney. He gets Richard Cross cleared for Jessica's murder but is surprised to find himself later defending Neil Avedon for the same murder. He spends much of the first season exploring alternative theories as to who killed Jessica Costello in an attempt to clear Neil's name. =Justine Appleton= (Mary McCormack) Justine is highly driven, and her ambition has overridden her better judgment on more than one occasion. She made no secret of her desire to make second chair when Richard Cross was charged, though Ted ultimately chose Lisa. She later began doing business with Cross, which led to Ted firing her after he found out. He later took her back, however, after she gave the firm valuable information regarding Cross. =Chris Docknovitch= (Michael Hayden) A younger attorney, and highly ambitious (though less so than Justine). He served as second chair during the Avedon trial. =Arnold Spivak= (J.C. MacKenzie) A brilliant legal mind, able to obtain relevant precedents from past cases pertaining to current ones. His intelligence is tempered by his awkwardness in social situations, which has rarely led to him making second chair in cases. A mutual attraction developed between him and Julie Costello, though that ended when she abruptly married Richard Cross. =Lisa Gillespie= (Grace Phillips) Lisa served as Ted's second chair during the Richard Cross case. She was also having a relationship with Chris. =Louis Hines= (John Fleck) Louis is Ted's personal assistant. =Dave Blalock= (Kevin Tighe) Davie Blalock served as the firm's private investigator until he was murdered by Rusty Arnold while following up a lead for the Avedon case. =Ray Velacek= (Joe Spano) Ray is a retired police detective whom the firm defended in an assault charge after he attempted to protect a woman from her abusive husband. After Dave Blalock's death, Hoffman hired him as the firm's new investigator. =Lila= (Vanessa A. Williams) Lila is the firm's receptionist. Her role on the series is limited though the firm did defend her fianc√©e on a charge in an early episode. Prosecutors and Police =Miriam Grasso= (Barbara Bosson) The lead prosecutor in the Avedon trial. Her un-chic wardrobe and simple demeanor belie the fact that she is a fierce and effective prosecutor. Despite the adversarial nature of their jobs, she and Ted are good friends and have a mutual personal and professional respect. =Detective Arthur Polson= (Dylan Baker) A detective in the LAPD's Robbery/Homicide department, he in charge of investigating the murder of Jessica Costello, arresting Richard Cross, then Neil Avedon for the murder. He and Ted frequently butted heads, though tensions eased between the two after Ted's daughter was abducted. =Roger Garfield= (Gregory Itzin) The political-minded District Attorney of the county of Los Angeles, with aspirations for being elected Governor of California. His professional decisions appear to based at least as much on how the public perceives him as on what is truly the right course of action. =Mark Washington= (Markus Redmond) The second chair during the Avedon case. He is a younger, less experienced ADA. Though generally competent, he did not endear himself in the eyes of the jury with his aggressive cross- examination of Neil Avedon's mother. Others =Richard Cross= (Stanley Tucci). A millionaire businessman, a longtime acquaintance of Ted's, and the first man arrested for Jessica Costello's murder. The charges are quickly dismissed after Cross produces an alibi and he later bankrolled Neil Avedon's defense, claiming him to be a friend. As time passes, however, Ted becomes convinced that Cross is manipulating events and may be part of a conspiracy to frame Neil for the murder. Cross was a notorious philanderer and was eventually found to be HIV positive. Once he could no longer safely engage in sex with others, he would set up Jessica and her sister Julie with men, then obtain sexual gratification by having them describe the encounters in graphic detail. =Neil Avedon= (Jason Gedrick) A popular movie actor with a long history of misdemeanors, who frequently abused drugs and alcohol. The show began with Ted obtaining a deal for Neil following his latest offence, then angrily dismissing him as a client for his reckless behaviour. Ted later reluctantly took his case after he was arrested for the murder of Jessica (whom he'd been dating). =Julie Costello= (Bobbie Philips) Jessica's older sister, and a model with a checkered past of her own, largely due to her romantic involvement with Richard Cross. She was originally set to testify against Cross at Neil's trial but stunned Ted and the entire court with the revelation that she could no longer testify as she and Cross had just eloped. =Annie Hoffman= (Patricia Clarkson) Ted's patient and loving wife. She and Ted attempted to shield their young daughter Elizabeth from the heavy public scrutiny of the trial (with limited success). After the trial continued to infiltrate their lives, culminating in Elizabeth being abducted briefly, Annie asked for a separation, and eventually a divorce. After the end of the trial, there were indications the two would reconcile, however. =Judge Beth Bornstein= (Linda Carlson) The presiding judge over the Avedon trial. She and Ted had been romantically involved several years before he was married, though their relationship in the courtroom was strictly professional. =Francesca Cross= (Donna Murphy) Richard's first wife and a close friend of Ted's. She grew tired of his long history of infidelity and divorced him soon after he was cleared of Jessica's murder. She later had a brief affair with Ted after he and Annie separated. =Dr. Graham Lester= (Stanley Kamel) Neil's psychiatrist, later found to part of a conspiracy to frame Neil. He testified that Neil had called his office the night of Jessica's murder and confessing to the crime. Hoffman attempted to undermine his credibility by presenting evidence that Lester had sexually abused female patients. =Roberto Portalegre= (Miguel Sandoval) A business associate of Richard Cross' from Brazil, he is in fact a cocaine dealer. Cross asked Ted to represent Roberto's son Eduardo on a rape charge, though Roberto paid the young girl off before he can do anything. After Eduardo is later charged with attempting to strangle another girl, Ted begins to wonder if he had something to do with Jessica's death. =Gary Blondo= (John Pleshette) A producer from the studio that produced Neil's latest movie Deadbolt. He is one of the people mentioned in Jessica's diary and had possibly slept with her, making him a suspect in her murder. He attempted to feign illness to avoid taking the stand, though the ruse was quickly exposed. =Jessica Costello= (Collette White) The victim; a fifteen-year-old girl found naked and strangled in her bedroom after having sex with an older man. Numerous suspects and theories surfaced throughout the trial though the identity of her killer was not revealed until the season finale.

As of 2010 it was one of the poorest municipalities in Brazil, with a low Human Development Index. Location Manoel Urbano is in the state of Acre, the Vale do Acre mesoregion and the Sena Madureira microregion. It is from the state capital, Rio Branco, along the BR-364, which is paved to the municipality. It is bounded on the north by the state of Amazonas, on the south and east by the municipality of Sena Madureira, on the west by the municipality of Santa Rosa do Purus, on the northwest by the municipality of Feij√≥ and on the southwest by Peru. Its area is . The municipality contains 2% of the Cazumb√°-Iracema Extractive Reserve, established in 2002 to support sustainable use of the natural resources by the traditional population. It also contains about 66% of the Chandless State Park, created in 2004, which protects an area of rainforest with bamboos that contains various endemic species of flora and fauna. History The history of European settlement dates to the end of the 19th century when two brothers, Jo√£o Moaco and Z√© Moaco, founded the Coloca√ß√£o Tabocal settlement on the right bank of the Purus River. At that time supplies and produce were shipped via the Purus by boats and smaller vessels from the ports of Bel√©m and Manaus. One summer a boat named \\"Castelo\\" was stranded during the dry season, and was not floated until the next rainy season. The residents began to call the area \\"Castelo\\". In 1936 the residents asked the state government to make the settlement a town named after Manoel Urbano, an Amazonian mestizo from the Manacapur√∫ region who had explored the Purus River. In the territorial division of 31 December 1936 the region was the Castelo district of the Sena Madureira municipality. On 1 March 1963 the municipality of Manoel Urbano was separated from Sena Madureira. Demographics In the 2010 Census, its population was 7,981, divided between 5,278 urban and 2,703 rural. As of 2010 the municipality ranked 5186 out of 5565 of Brazilian municipalities on the Human Development Index. The overall index was 0.551.

Career =France= Born in Calais, Pas-de-Calais, Bossu started out as a boy at small French amateur club US Bl√©riot-Plage, before joining Calais RUFC. When he was 16 he moved to RC Lens but never managed to play for the professional team there as he was confined to the third and fourth teams. =Barnet and Hayes= Bossu joined Barnet in March 2000. He made his debut and subsequently only first team appearance for Barnet on 17 May 2000 in the second leg of the play-off semi-final. Barnet were trailing 2‚Äì0 (4‚Äì1 on aggregate) away to Peterborough United when Bossu replaced the injured Lee Harrison in the Barnet goal. He conceded one more goal, giving David Farrell his hat-trick and confirming Peterborough's place in the final. He joined Conference side Hayes on loan in December 2000. His one-man heroics in the 1‚Äì0 win away to Boston United on 2 December ended a run of seven consecutive defeats. However, in the process Bossu broke a finger and returned to Barnet to recuperate. He joined Rushden & Diamonds on loan in March 2001, but failed to make a first team appearance for them and was released by Barnet at the end of the season. He rejoined Hayes in August 2001, but lost his place as Hayes were relegated from the Conference. Although he began the following season as second-choice, he regained his place in the side and went on to win the Hayes Supporters' Player of the Year Award in 2003. In the midst of this he had also become the first Hayes goalkeeper to score a goal, with a last-minute header in the game away to St Albans City. =Gillingham= Bossu joined Gillingham in September 2003 and made his debut later that month away to Walsall. He played just five more times that season, including the victory at home to Premier League side Charlton Athletic in the FA Cup. In August 2004 he joined Torquay United on a three-month loan deal playing in the first two games of the season away to Bristol City and at home to Hull City the same month. However, he was sent back to Gillingham by Torquay with a knee injury, prompting a row over who should pay his wages. He joined Oldham Athletic in late October 2004, but failed to make their first team. =Darlington and Walsall= He was released by Gillingham at the end of the 2004‚Äì05 season, joining Darlington in August 2005. The same month he joined Accrington Stanley on loan, playing one Conference National game away to Cambridge United before returning to Darlington where he played 10 times before being released at the end of the season. He then joined Walsall in September 2006, but was released in May 2008. =Aberdeen= After being released by Walsall, Bossu then went on trial with Scottish Premier League side Aberdeen. After impressing goalkeeping coach Jim Leighton, he was offered a contract with the Scottish club. Bossu left Aberdeen in August 2009 after only three appearances for the club. He signed for Crewe Alexandra on a two-month contract on 28 October following a successful trial. However, he left six days later after asking for his contract to be cancelled.

He has written a range of satires on the theme of the decline of Western civilization, as well as producing short stories, poetry, essays, and a number of radio plays.  Early life and education  David Manning Foster was born on 15 May 1944 in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales, Australia to George and Hazel (n√©e Manning) Foster, vaudeville and radio performers who separated before his birth, and spent his early years in Katoomba, raised by his mother and maternal grandparents. In 1950, Foster spent six months in Katoomba Hospital recovering from poliomyelitis, a disease that left him with a slight limp. His mother married a bank officer and Foster attended high schools in Sydney (Fort Street High School), Armidale (Armidale High School), and Orange (Orange High School) as the family moved from city to country towns.'David Foster' compiled by Annabel Frost. Australian Country Style (March 1996). pp.18, 20. At Orange High, Foster began playing drums professionally in a jazz dance band. In 1961, Foster commenced an Arts degree at the University of Sydney in Sydney, but he left studies after a year to work and travel.Foster, David. 'Aggression in Sleepy Hollow' Australian Book Review 65 (October 1984). pp.9-10. A year thereafter, in 1963, he return to the University to study chemistry at the University of Sydney School of Chemistry. Foster worked part-time as a musician and as an engineer at Marrickville Council while he completed his Bachelor of Science in Chemistry. He was awarded the University Medal for Inorganic Chemistry in 1967 and moved to Canberra for a PhD in Biological Inorganic Chemistry at the Australian National University, from which he graduated in 1970.David (Manning) Foster Biography ‚Äì Australian, Novel, Penguin, and York ‚Äì JRank Articles  Career  = Scientific and early literary career = At the end of this degree, he went to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the United States to pursue postdoctoral studies at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Pennsylvania. During this time, he began to write his first novellas, later published in North South West (1973). Back in Sydney in 1972, he worked as a Research Officer in the Department of Medicine, University of Sydney, before abandoning science for a career as a novelist. Since then he has supported himself and his family by various work as a pool attendant, musician, postman, truck driver, martial arts instructor and trawler fishermanFoster, David. 'Like Spinoza the Philosopher' Toads: Australian Writers: Other Work, Other Lives. Ed. Andrew Sant. Sydney, Allen & Unwin, 1992. pp.72-84. After the publication of North South West by Macmillan, Foster was awarded an Australia Council for the Arts Fellowship. = Literary career = Foster's first collection of novellas was well-received, and his first novel, The Pure Land (1974) won the inaugural The Age Book of the Year prize. The novel is strongly autobiographical as it traces the experiences of the young scientist Danny Harris in America and Australia. At the end of the novel, Danny has abandoned science and appears to be inventing the novel in which he is a character. His grandfather, Albert Manwaring, has left his life as a photographer in Katoomba to seek success and, finally, spiritual purity in America; Danny, born in America, reverses the journey to find a Pure Land in Australia. The novel satirises both the grasping materialism of America and the backward colonialism of Australia. This novel was followed by another collection of stories Escape to Reality (1977) which pursued Foster's interest in masculine irresponsibility and the paradoxes of science and art. With a fellow scientist at the Australian National University, called 'D.K. Lyall' (Des Kirk), Foster published The Empathy Experiment (1977), a strange exploration of paranoia in the context of scientific experiments in empathy. A 1978 Marten Bequest enabled Foster to travel to Scotland to research Moonlite (1981), his acclaimed satire on colonialism, which places the experiences of Scottish islanders during the clearances of the nineteenth century in paradoxical comparison with the colonising of Australia at the same time. Plumbum (1983) uses Foster's experience in jazz bands to satirise the contemporary Western adulation of rock musicians, contrasting this fervour with the various religions of Bangkok and India. The Adventures of Christian Rosy Cross (1985) is a burlesque historical satire on the paradoxes of religious belief following the picaresque adventures of Christian as he searches for the philosopher's stone. Dog Rock: a Postal Pastoral (1985) offers a more benign comedy as Foster examines the trivia of an Australian country town like Bundanoon. A second Dog Rock novel, The Pale Blue Crochet Coathanger Cover (1988) continues this nostalgic view of a disappearing rural life with particular reference to the misuse of animals, and, in 2012, Foster published a third Dog Rock novel, Man of Letters. Testostero (1987), inspired by a residence in Venice in 1984, uses the convention of the separated twins to satirise the cultural differences between Britain and Australia, with a third possibility represented by Italy. Among its many allusions and parodies, the novel invokes the traditions of Carnivale and Carlo Goldoni's play,The Venetian Twins. After the Australian Bicentennial celebrations of 1988 Foster published his own satire of the state of contemporary Australia in Mates of Mars (1991). The novel follows a group of martial arts enthusiasts as they travel from Sydney to the Northern Territory and encounter a spiritualism that challenges their various beliefs and attitudes. The characters represent a multicultural Australia, and demonstrate the novel's premise that 'Australians are not just members of the internal proletariat of...Western Christian Civilisation ( a civilisation now decrepit, that can never take Colonials seriously) but also, in certain key aspects chiefly, but not exclusively, economic, barbarian members of the external proletariat of the Sinic Mahayana Buddhist Civilisation, in its Westernised Japanese/Korean/Colonial Chinese branch, on the southernmost march of that civilisation'.Mates of Mars. Introduction. Penguin, 1991. Foster used the support of an Australian government Creative Fellowship awarded in 1991 (a 'Keating' award) to research his monumental The Glade Within the Grove (1996). Narrated by the postman of Dog Rock, D‚ÄôArcy D‚ÄôOliveres, this novel examines the destruction of the native forests of Australia and the decline of Christianity in the context of pre- Christian religious beliefs. Set mainly in the 'revolutionary' year of 1968, the novel speculates about a group of hippies who set up a commune in the South Eastern forests of Australia. The novel's accompanying poem,The Ballad of Erinungerah, claims to be the work of a child of the commune and describes the visit of the goddess, Brigid, and her demand that the men castrate themselves. The novel celebrates the forests in lyrical descriptions, satirises the stupidity of the communards and translates snatches of classic texts into Australian vernacular. It is celebratory, satirical and elegiac. Later, Foster published under his own name an essay 'On Castration' in Heat magazine, that incorporated part of the novel as it argued that male sexuality is a destructive force that needs to be controlled.'On Castration' Heat 4 (1997) pp. 7-19. Reprinted as 'Castration' in Studs and Nogs Random House, Sydney, 1999, pp.117-129. This obsession is evident in all Foster's work after Mates of Mars. His novel In the New Country offers a comic and despairing view of the decline of rural life in Australia, comparing it to the corresponding decline of spirituality in the Old Country of Ireland. The Land Where Stories End is a fairytale about a woodcutter in Ireland who goes on an impossible quest for spiritual purity. In 2009, Foster published Sons of the Rumour, his most ambitious and original novel to date. Modelled on the structure of the One Thousand and One Nights, it changes the storyteller's role from Shahrazad to a group of men travelling through the 7th century city of Merv. Richard Burton's Arabian Nights are transformed into Iranian days. Foster creates a comic structure for the stories with his rather Australian bickering couple the Shah and Shahrazad, but the stories are imaginative adventures, sometimes puzzling, sometimes grotesque and often wondrous. For example, 'The Mine in the Moon' imagines a world without women, where boys grow up without maternal comfort; 'The Tears of the Fish' describes an orgy and castration ritual; 'The Gilt Felt Yurt' measures the loss of freedom in the creation of civilization and settlement. In the course of the stories the Shah undergoes an education in spiritualism and sexual understanding. A final section of the novel moves to the present day where a modern man undergoes a visionary experience in Ireland. Reviewing the novel for Australian Book Review, James Ley concluded, 'There is simply no one remotely like him in contemporary Australian fiction. He is so far ahead of everyone else that it's not funny. Except that it is funny‚Äîvery, very funny'. James Ley. 'A town called Merv' Australian Book Review November 2009 p.16  Personal life  In 1964, Foster married his Orange High girlfriend, Robin Bowers, with whom he would have three children; Samantha (b. 1968), Natalie (b. 1969), and Seth (b. 1973).Lever, Susan.

Location The municipal seat is on the left bank of the Abun√£ River, which defines the boundary between Brazil and Bolivia. It is from Rio Branco by road, or as the crow flies, accessible to weekend tourists from the city via the AC-40 highway. It has an area of , and is the 19th largest in area in Acre. The municipality is bounded to the north and northwest by the municipality of Senador Guiomard, to the east by the municipality of Acrel√¢ndia, to the south by Bolivia and to the west by the municipality of Capixaba. The municipality contains the Pl√°cido de Castro Ecological Park, a municipal conservation area that contains 113 genera of trees. An area that held large trees such as Brazil nut, rubber, cocoa and mahogany was destroyed by fire in 2005. The surrounding area has several large, ancient earthworks termed \\"geoglifos\\" by regional archaeologists. An example is clearly visible in aerial photography at . History In the early 20th century the region of the present municipality was a place where fugitives from the law took refuge. Jos√© Pl√°cido de Castro, who was prefect of the Alto Acre department in 1906-07, recommended the need for a settlement to stabilise the situation. In 1922 a trading post was established, serving extractors of nuts and rubber in the Abun√£ River basin. The post was in a rubber tappers' settlement named Pacatuba on the S√£o Gabriel rubber estate, which was soon renamed after Pl√°cido de Castro, a hero of the Acre War. The Pl√°cido de Castro District is shown as part of the Rio Branco municipality in the divisions of 31 December 1936 and 1 July 1960. The town did not develop until the 1940s and 1950s with the opening of the present road that links the city of Rio Branco to the towns of Quinari (Senador Guiomard) and Pl√°cido de Castro. The municipality of Pl√°cido de Castro was created on 10 March 1963. People and economy The 2010 census gave the population as 17,209, of which 8,999 were men and 8,210 women. 12,384 were literate. 6,787 were Roman Catholic and 5,134 were Evangelical Christians. The Human Development Index as of 2010 was 0.622. In 2015 there were 3,260 elementary school pupils and 776 secondary school pupils. Estimated population as of 2016 was 18,159. The municipality is the 8th largest in Acre by population, with a population density of 8.87 inhabitants per square kilometre. The local economy is based on beef and dairy cattle, saw mills, furniture manufacture, tourism, agriculture and extraction, particularly Brazil nuts. The neighbouring Bolivian village of Vila Montevid√©u had a free trade zone for imported goods that was much visited by Brazilians. The village was burned in a major fire in 2007 and was rebuilt on a nearby site with the new name of Vila Evo Morales. The name honours President Evo Morales of Bolivia, who sent aid for reconstruction and was the first Bolivian president to visit the village.

Porto Acre is limited to the north by the state of Amazonas, to the west and south by the municipality of Bujari, to the south by Rio Branco and to the east by the municipality of Senador Guiomard. History In 1899 Acre belonged to Bolivia and the present municipal seat was named Puerto Alonso. That year Luis G√°lvez Rodr√≠guez de Arias expelled the Bolivians and declared the Independent State of Acre. He renamed Puerto Alonso to Cidade do Acre and made it the headquarters of the new state. The state created a flag, minted its own currency, drafted a constitution, appointed ministers and formed an army. However, Galves was deposed and arrested after a few months and the Bolivians regained control. At the start of 1902 Jos√© Pl√°cido de Castro accepted an invitation to lead a revolt against Bolivia. He took a boat up the Acre river, ostensibly to conduct land surveys in the south but in practice carrying arms and ammunition. He stopped off briefly in Puerto Alonso to meet the Bolivian governor Lino Romero and evaluate his future opponent. In the south he organised the rubber tappers and other inhabitants for the revolt. He then returned to Brazil, bypassing Puerto Alonso to avoid alerting the Bolivians. Pl√°cido captured Xapuri on 6 August 1902 and next day proclaimed that Acre was independent. On 14 October 1902 the rebels captured some of the outer defences of Puerto Alonso and the armed Bolivian launch Rio Afua, which they renamed the Independencia. Pl√°cido de Castro surrounded the town on 8 January 1903, and launched an attack on 15 January 1903 that soon petered out. His men started to dig zigzag trenches to the Bolivian lines. Eventually, with his forces exhausted and almost out of ammunition, Romero surrendered on 24 January 1903.

The municipality has an area of and a population density of 5.71 inhabitants per square kilometre. The local football team is Val√™ncia Porto Acre. Porto Acre's economy is based on extraction of rubber, Brazil nut and wood processing, small-scale livestock, horticultural products and general commerce. The Acre River is still used for movement of goods and people. During the dry season its fertile banks are used to grow watermelon, banana, vegetables, cassava and other food crops.

A native of De Lancey, Pennsylvania, he attended Saint Francis University, Loretto, Pennsylvania. He was a right-hander and played for the St. Louis Cardinals (1935‚Äì38) and Boston Red Sox (1941‚Äì46). In 1946, at the age of 43, he was the second-oldest player to appear in an American League game that season. Ryba was usually used in relief during his ten-year major league career. Ryba appeared in 10 career games as a catcher. While in the minor leagues, he played all nine positions at various points. He made his major league debut on September 22, 1935, against the Cincinnati Reds in game 1 of a doubleheader at Sportsman's Park. He pitched seven innings of two-hit relief and was the winning pitcher in the 14‚Äì4 game. He also had two hits and three runs batted in to help his cause. In four seasons with St. Louis Ryba won 16 games, lost 9, and had an ERA of 4.39. On September 5, 1940, he was traded to the Boston Red Sox for pitcher Al Brazle. Ryba was 37 years old and had not pitched in the big leagues for two years, but his best seasons were ahead of him. In six years with the Red Sox, Ryba won 36 games, lost 25, saved 16, and had an ERA of 3.42. Boston won the pennant in his last season, and he appeared in Game # 4 of the 1946 World Series, giving up one earned run and allowing two inherited runners to score in of an inning. Ryba caught both games of a home doubleheader against the Cleveland Indians on July 19, 1942. Ryba finished in his league's top ten for games finished 5 times, games pitched 3 times, saves 2 times, and winning percentage 1 time. Career totals for 250 games (240 as a pitcher) include a record of 52‚Äì34 (.605), 36 games started, 16 complete games, 2 shutouts, 132 games finished, and 16 saves. Ryba allowed 319 earned runs in 783 innings pitched for an ERA of 3.66. He wielded a strong bat for a pitcher, hitting .235 (58-for-247) with 24 RBI. He was strong defensively as well, making just seven errors as a pitcher and none as a catcher. Ryba managed in the Red Sox, Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds farm systems after his pitching career, coached for St. Louis from 1951 to 1955, and scouted for the Cardinals and Reds until his death, at the age of 68 in Brookline Station, Missouri, when he fell from a ladder in his yard while trimming branches of a tree.

Unlike the standard Boolean algebra of events, a CEA allows the defining of a probability function, P, which satisfies the equation P(If A then B) = P(A and B) / P(A) over a usefully broad range of conditions. Standard probability theory In standard probability theory, one begins with a set, Œ©, of outcomes (or, in alternate terminology, a set of possible worlds) and a set, F, of some (not necessarily all) subsets of Œ©, such that F is closed under the countably infinite versions of the operations of basic set theory: union (‚à™), intersection (‚à©), and complementation ( ‚Ä≤). A member of F is called an event (or, alternatively, a proposition), and F, the set of events, is the domain of the algebra. Œ© is, necessarily, a member of F, namely the trivial event \\"Some outcome occurs.\\" A probability function P assigns to each member of F a real number, in such a way as to satisfy the following axioms: : For any event E, P(E) ‚â• 0. : P(Œ©) = 1 : For any countable sequence E1, E2, ... of pairwise disjoint events (meaning that each event is disjoint with every other event), P(E1 ‚à™ E2 ‚à™ ...) = P(E1) + P(E2) + .... It follows that P(E) is always less than or equal to 1. The probability function is the basis for statements like P(A ‚à© B‚Ä≤) = 0.73, which means, \\"The probability that A but not B is 73%.\\" Conditional probabilities and probabilities of conditionals The statement \\"The probability that if A, then B, is 24%.\\" means (put intuitively) that event B occurs in 24% of the outcomes where event A occurs. The standard formal expression of this is P(BA) = 0.24, where the conditional probability P(BA) equals, by definition, P(A ‚à© B) / P(A). It is tempting to write, instead, P(A ‚Üí B) = 0.24, where A ‚Üí B is the conditional event \\"If A, then B\\". That is, given events A and B, one might posit an event, A ‚Üí B, such that P(A ‚Üí B) could be counted on to equal P(BA). One benefit of being able to refer to conditional events would be the opportunity to nest conditional event descriptions within larger constructions. Then, for instance, one could write P(A ‚à™ (B ‚Üí C)) = 0.51, meaning, \\"The probability that either A, or else if B, then C, is 51%\\". Unfortunately, philosopher David Lewis showed that in orthodox probability theory, only certain trivial Boolean algebras with very few elements contain, for any given A and B, an event X such that P(X) = P(BA) is true for any probability function P. Later extended by others, this result stands as a major obstacle to any talk about logical objects that can be the bearers of conditional probabilities. The construction of conditional event algebras The classification of an algebra makes no reference to the nature of the objects in the domain, being entirely a matter of the formal behavior of the operations on the domain. However, investigation of the properties of an algebra often proceeds by assuming the objects to have a particular character. Thus, the canonical Boolean algebra is, as described above, an algebra of subsets of a universe set. What Lewis in effect showed is what can and cannot be done with an algebra whose members behave like members of such a set of subsets. Conditional event algebras circumvent the obstacle identified by Lewis by using a nonstandard domain of objects. Instead of being members of a set F of subsets of some universe set Œ©, the canonical objects are normally higher-level constructions of members of F. The most natural construction, and historically the first, uses ordered pairs of members of F. Other constructions use sets of members of F or infinite sequences of members of F. Specific types of CEA include the following (listed in order of discovery): : Shay algebras : Calabrese algebras : Goodman-Nguyen-van Fraassen algebras : Goodman-Nguyen-Walker algebras CEAs differ in their formal properties, so that they cannot be considered a single, axiomatically characterized class of algebra. Goodman-Nguyen-van Frassen algebras, for example, are Boolean while Calabrese algebras are non-distributive. The latter, however, support the intuitively appealing identity A ‚Üí (B ‚Üí C) = (A ‚à© B) ‚Üí C, while the former do not. References Goodman, I. R., R. P. S. Mahler, and H. T.

Archived 2007-12-19, retrieved 2008-11-01 The term was coined by Polish sociologist Florian Znaniecki.El≈ºbieta Ha≈Ças, The Humanistic Approach of Florian Znaniecki, Chapter III. The Humanistic Coefficient of Sociological Order Znaniecki coined the term in Polish in his Wstƒôp do socjologii (Introduction to Sociology, 1922) and translated it into English as \\"humanistic coefficient\\" in his book, The Object-Matter of Sociology (1927). Definitions Grossly and simply speaking, the humanistic coefficient is the difference between trying to describe or explain social facts as if they were purely physical phenomena, or doing it instead by taking into account the culture of the folk or milieu in which those facts happen. In Znaniecki's own words: \\"an observer of cultural life can understand the data observed only if taken with the \\"humanistic coefficient\\", only if he does not limit his observation to his own direct experience of the data but reconstructs the experience and the data in the social context of the people involved\\".Paraphrased from \\"The Social Role of the Man of Knowledge By Florian Znaniecki \\" Originally published: New York : Harper & Row, 1968. Elsewhere he wrote: \\"This essential character of cultural data we call the humanistic coefficient, because such data, as objects of the student's theoretic reflection, already belong to somebody's else's experience and are such as this active experience makes them.\\" Piotr Sztompka defines the humanistic coefficient as \\"a connection that exists between each social fact and actions and experiences of particular individuals, and the resulting need for those facts to be studied from specific perspective that requires the research to place him or herself in the position of those individuals.\\" El≈ºbieta Ha≈Ças in turn defines it as \\"the notion of the human collective's constructing and reconstructing of reality\\", thus related to the concept of social constructionist. Meaning According to the concept of the humanistic coefficient, all social facts are created by social actors, and can only be understood from their perspective. No social facts can exist without connection to some individuals (although that connection does not have to necessarily be consciously perceived). Thus the sociologist should study reality by trying to understand how others see the world, not as an independent observer (objectively); in other words the scientist needs to understand the world of the subject. Ken Plummer puts it curtly as \\"the object of study is always linked to somebody's human meanings. While some have criticized the humanistic coefficient approach as too close to subjectivism, Znaniecki himself saw is as anti-subjectivist; he noted that social facts like cultural systems can exist even if nobody perceives their existence. He was also critical of any value coming from personal, subjective observations, arguing that such observations have value only if they can be objectively described. Both natural and social sciences operate within the bounds of the humanistic coefficient, but the natural sciences may abstract the pheomena they analyze from it, while the social sciences are methodologically obliged to account for it. Thus Znaniecki argued that the difference between natural and social sciences lies not in the difference between objective and subjective experiences, but in the subject of what is being studied: for Znaniecki, natural sciences studied things, and social sciences ‚Äì cultural values. He saw sociology as a nomothetic science that should be able to use a similar methodology as natural sciences. The humanistic coefficient concerns the ontology of culture, but it also has an epistemological aspect, as it describes how sociological concepts should be constructed in an environment where social facts investigated by the researchers can be accessed only through experiences and actions of the subjects he or she observes. The humanistic coefficient is a major element in the sociological theory of Znaniecki.

It was the scene of an early bloodless victory during the war to make Acre independent of Bolivia. The town is known as the birthplace of the rubber tapper and environmentalist Chico Mendes and of the surgeon and professor Adib Jatene. Location Xapuri is at the point where the Xapuri River meets the Acre River. Its name is said to come from the Indigenous word Chapury, meaning \\"river meeting\\". Another explanation is that its name comes from the indigenous tribe of \\"Xapury\\" people. The town is about northwest of the BR-317 highway which leads from Rio Branco, to the east, to Brasil√©ia, to the west. It has broad streets and wooden houses. The area of the municipality is . It is 12th largest in area in Acre. It is bounded by the municipality of Sena Madureira to the west, Rio Branco to the north, Capixaba to the east, Epitaciol√¢ndia to the south, and Brasil√©ia to the southwest. The municipality contains part of the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve, a sustainable use environmental unit created in 1990. The reserve is fairly well maintained apart from a few locations of deforestation, but its surroundings are quite deforested, compromising its buffer zone.  History  Xapuri was born in 1883 shortly after Volta da Empreza (today's Rio Branco) was founded. The first Europeans came to the region in the first rubber boom, a period of uncontrolled land grabbing and extraction of forest resources. The village of Xapuri became one of Acre's main rubber trading posts, and the region was an important producer of rubber and Brazil nuts. Until the Acre War of 1902‚Äì03 it was part of Bolivia, although most of the new colonists were Brazilian. At the time of the Acre War the Bolivians called the post Mariscal Sucre. At the start of 1902 Jos√© Pl√°cido de Castro accepted an invitation to lead a revolt against Bolivia. Although he argued for immediately attacking the garrison of 230 troops at Puerto Alonso (now Porto Acre), Pl√°cido de Castro was persuaded to first take the outpost at Xapuri. He entered Xapuri with 33 men in the early morning of 6 August 1902 and captured the sleeping garrison without spilling blood. On 7 August 1902 he issued a manifesto proclaiming that Acre was independent. After further fighting the last Bolivian forces surrender at what is now Porto Acre on 24 January 1903. The village of Xapuri was officially elevated to the status of a town on 22 March 1904 by the prefect of Alto Acre, Colonel Augusto da Cunha Matos. On 22 March 1905 it was elevated to the status of city by the interim prefect Captain Odilon Pratagi Brasiliense. Xapuri was officially made a municipality on 23 October 1912. Infrastructure was soon built, including trading houses and schools. For many years Xapuri was known as the Little Princess of Acre (Princesinha do Acre) due to its great wealth from rubber. The city became famous after the 1988 assassination of the rubber tapper and environmentalist Chico Mendes, who was born in Xapuri. His house has been preserved as one of the attractions of the town. People and economy The municipality of Xapuri has the 9th largest population in Acre. As of 2010 the population was 16,091. The estimated population in 2016 was 17,608. The population density of 2010 was 3.01 people per square kilometre. The town is an important Acre tourist destination for its monuments to the Acre War and the house of Chico Mendes, and has an eco- lodge at the Seringal Waterfall. Apart from cattle ranching and subsistence farming, there is a condom factory, wood flooring factory and furniture workshops. There are several settlement projects for extraction of nuts and rubber, subsistence agriculture and forestry. The people also raise livestock, hunt and fish. The Xapuri I and II projects are trying to bring back extractors and farmers who had moved to the city and to promote recovery of areas of pasturage and slash-and-burn agriculture by replanting fruit trees and timber trees.

Directly translated, Volkspele means \\"folk-games\\" and can be translated to folk-dance. Folk-dance was the brain-child of South African Dr. SH Pellisier, who was visiting Sweden in 1915 with a friend to become more proficient in carpentry. After finishing their day's work they met with other young people in their respective countries' national dress to practise their folk-singing and -dancing. The South Africans were the only ones left out as they did not have any traditional dances. Back in South Africa, Pellisier translated four Swedish dances and taught them to pupils at the Afrikaans High School in Boshof where he was Deputy Headmaster. During a Sunday School picnic on the farm Vuisfontein near Boshof on 22 February 1914 they performed the dances for the first time. The picnic games became known as volkspele. With the help of the Reddingsdaadbond, an organisation which was established to assist poor Afrikaners after the Anglo Boer War, groups of dancers called laers were established throughout the country. Get-togethers called saamtrekke are usually organised where all the laers get together to sing and do folk-dancing. The folk-dancers also present displays and have courses on different levels, seniors: people out of school, and juniors: learners in school, for either a weekend or longer. During the June school holidays there are also courses for grade 5-7 pupils (known as the Judith Pellissierweek - named after the wife of Dr Pellissier), grade 8-9 pupils (known as the Vormingsweek - Formative) and for grade 10-12 pupils (known as the Pellisierweek). From time to time there are overseas tours; or a folk- dance group or two will tour with South African folk-dancers in South Africa, giving displays at various towns. At these saamtrekke, displays, tours and courses the dress (volkspeledrag) is as the photos below show. Tours have been conducted to Europe, Namibia, The United States and Turkey, with groups from Italy, Germany, Belgium and others touring South Africa. The dress originated from the formal dress the pioneers or Voortrekkers wore. It is called national dress, as in the European countries. All folk-dancers in South Africa must use the same style with only the colours differing. Each laer has its own colours for the ladies' dresses as well as for the men's waistcoats - these are embroidered with indigenous flower designs.

In particular, Goldie's theorem applies to semiprime right Noetherian rings, since by definition right Noetherian rings have the ascending chain condition on all right ideals. This is sufficient to guarantee that a right-Noetherian ring is right Goldie. The converse does not hold: every right Ore domain is a right Goldie domain, and hence so is every commutative integral domain. A consequence of Goldie's theorem, again due to Goldie, is that every semiprime principal right ideal ring is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of prime principal right ideal rings. Every prime principal right ideal ring is isomorphic to a matrix ring over a right Ore domain. Sketch of the proof This is a sketch of the characterization mentioned in the introduction. It may be found in . *If R be a semiprime right Goldie ring, then it is a right order in a semisimple ring: ** Essential right ideals of R are exactly those containing a regular element. ** There are no non-zero nil ideals in R. ** R is a right nonsingular ring.This may be deduced from a theorem of Mewborn and Winton, that if a ring satisfies the maximal condition on right annihilators then the right singular ideal is nilpotent. ** From the previous observations, R is a right Ore ring, and so its right classical ring of quotients Qr exists. Also from the previous observations, Qr is a semisimple ring. Thus R is a right order in Qr. * If R is a right order in a semisimple ring Q, then it is semiprime right Goldie: **Any right order in a Noetherian ring (such as Q) is right Goldie. **Any right order in a Noetherian semiprime ring (such as Q) is itself semiprime. **Thus, R is semiprime right Goldie.

Regazzi lives and works in Bologna. Biography The debut was at an early age; when he was 14 years old started to be involved with passion in the construction of musical instruments, at that time mostly classical guitars, under the guidance of Alan Wilcox and Renato Scrollavezza in the mid 1970s. Later, the possibility to become a home pupil of Otello Bignami was crucial for his decision to stop the studies at the Bologna University (Physics) to become a professional violin maker. Established and well known worldwide for the high quality of his instruments, he has been president of a number of specialized organizations including the European Association of Violin and Bow Makers. His violins are examples of the Italianate sound and in demand also in countries.Marina Amaduzzi, Il Signore dei Violini in: La Repubblica, 21 Dec 2005, p.15 Just before the advent of the new millennium his production started to be inspired by Guarneri del Ges√π, with the achievement of a rich and full sonority. His work is also inspired by Ansaldo Poggi and Otello Bignami (Augusto Pollastri's Bolognese School). In 2006 the Chamber of Commerce of Bologna conferred on him an honour in recognition of his work.Camera di Commercio di Bologna or see: Patrizia Zini, Un premio alla creativit√† bolognese, in: Bologna Economica, Luglio-Agosto 2006, p.11 In 2018 the Fondazione Cologni wanted to have him in the Golden Book of the MAM (Maestro d'Arte e Mestiere), a sort of Grammy Award for handicraft activities.http://www.maestrodartemestiere.it/it/libro-d- oro/2018/roberto-regazzi Performers and musicians who have bought and play his instruments, including Boris Belkin,http://www.sienafree.it/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=13166:boris- belkin-e-la-sofia-festival-orchestra-diretta-da-alipi-naydenov-in-concerto-a- siena&catid;=256:eventi-e-spettacoli&Itemid;=522 or http://mialfombravoladora.blogspot.com/2009/11/52-boris-belkin-con-la-real- orquesta.html Franco Mezzena, Anne-Sophie Mutter,Das Magische Holz, Florenus Edizioni - Dynamic 2005 Ruggiero Ricci,The Legacy of Cremona, Genova 2001, Dynamic Salvatore Greco, Giovanni Adamo, Uto Ughi, Franco Gulli, Anastasiya Petryshak, Riccardo Brengola, the Quartetto di Venezia, Peter Fisher and many others.

The official Japanese title of the museum translates as the \\"National Museum of International Art\\". The museum is also known by the English acronym NMAO (National Museum of Art, Osaka). NMAO history Designed by architect Arata Isozaki. The museum originates from the Expo Art Gallery which was built as part of Expo '70, held in Suita in the outskirts of Osaka. The site was converted into Expo Commemoration Park after the Expo, but the gallery was preserved for possible future use as a permanent art museum. It re-opened in 1977 as the National Museum of Art, as part of the Expo Commemoration Park. Due to the aging of the building as well as growing space limitations, the museum was temporarily closed in January 2004. The old museum was demolished and turned into a car park, while the exhibits were transferred to its more central, current location in Nakanoshima, which opened in November 2004. NMAO collections Most of the artwork in the collection is from the post- war era. Pre-war exceptions include work by Paul C√©zanne, Pablo Picasso, Max Ernst, Tsuguharu Foujita and Yasuo Kuniyoshi. =Pelli's building= The museum structure is itself an example of the modern architect's art. The present museum was designed by international architect C√©sar Pelli. Most of the museum facilities are located underground, next to the Osaka Science Museum. Pelli suggested that the externally visible design structure represents waving reeds in the wind. The entrance, auditorium, restaurant and the museum shop are located just beneath ground level, with exhibits and storage facilities on the next two floors beneath.

The islands are limestone karst towers and are a part of Ao Phang Nga National Park. About from the shores of Khao Phing Kan lies a tall islet called Ko Ta Pu (, ) or Ko Tapu (, ). Since 1974, when they were featured in the James Bond movie The Man with the Golden Gun, Khao Phing Kan and Ko Ta Pu have been popularly called James Bond Island. Etymology Khao Phing Kan means \\"hills leaning against each other\\" in Thai, reflecting the connected nature of the islands. Khao Ta Pu can be literally translated as \\"crab's eye\\" island, and Ko Tapu can be translated as \\"nail\\" or \\"spike\\" island, reflecting its shape. With koh () meaning \\"island\\" and khao () meaning \\"hill\\", the terms ko, khao, and Ko Khao are frequently interchanged in the naming of the islands.Approaching James Bond Island, 6 Apr 2009 After appearing in the 1974 James Bond movie The Man with the Golden Gun, Khao Phing KanJoe Cummings, Becca Blond, Morgan Konn Thailand, Lonely Planet (2005) p. 642 web version and sometimes Ko Ta PuTravel like 007, NBC News, 11 November 2008 became widely referred to as James Bond Island, especially in tourist guides, and their original names are rarely used by locals. Claudia Springer James Dean transfigured: the many faces of rebel iconography, University of Texas Press, 2007 p. 195 History Before 1974, the island was a rarely visited indigenous area. However, it was chosen as one of the locations for the 1974 James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun as the hideout for Bond's antagonist, Francisco Scaramanga. After the movie release it turned into a popular tourist destination.The Man With the Golden Gun film locations Popularity and increased tourism left Khao Phing Kan with substantial litter. In 1981, the island became the most famous part of the newly established Ao Phang Nga Marine National Park. Since 1998, it is forbidden for tourist boats to approach Ko Ta Pu. This measure aims to stop erosion of the limestone rocks on and near the islet that might eventually result in the island's collapse.Ko Tapu is closed for tourists, Travel.ru (in Russian) Geography =Khao Phing Kan= Khao Phing Kan consists of two forest-covered islands with steep shores. They lie in the northwestern part of Phang Nga Bay, from the mainland, amid a group of a dozen of other islands. Its western part is about in diameter whereas the eastern part is about long and wide and is elongated northwards. The island has a few caves and two sandy beaches, in the southwest and between the twin islands. The former hosts the government office where every visitor has to pay a tax. The latter is used as the port for the tourist boats arriving from the mainland and has several souvenir shops selling items like coral and shells and plastic-encased butterflies, scorpions, and spiders. Beaches and caves are regularly flooded with the tides, which have an amplitude of , so access to some caves is only possible during low tide. The Thai name for Khao Phing Kan reflects the particular shape of the island which appears as if a flat limestone cliff tumbled sideways and leaned on a similar rock in the centre of the island. Waters around the island are only few metres deep and are pale-green in colour. The bottom is covered with silt, brought to the Phang Nga Bay by several rivers from the north. Ko Ta Pu =Khao Ta Pu= Khao Ta Pu is a limestone rock about tall with the diameter increasing from about near the water level to about at the top. It lies about to the west from the northern part of Khao Phing Kan. A local legend explains the formation of Khao Ta Pu as follows. Once upon a time, there lived a fisherman who used to bring home many fish every time he went to the sea. However, one day he could not catch any fish despite many attempts and only picked up a nail with his net. He kept throwing the nail back into the sea and catching it again. Furious, he took his sword and cut the nail in half with all his strength. Upon impact, one half of the nail jumped up and speared into the sea, forming Khao Ta Pu. A scientific version of the Khao Ta Pu formation says that in the Permian period, the area was a barrier reef. Then, upon tectonic movements, it ruptured, and its parts were dispersed over the area and flooded by the rising ocean. Wind, waves, water currents, and tides gradually eroded the islands thus formed, sometimes producing peculiar shapes, such as Khao Ta Pu.Phang Nga Bay National Park, National Park Division, Royal Forestry Department Tide- related erosion is visible at the bottom of the rock. In the James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun, Francisco Scaramanga describes Khao Ta Pu as a \\"mushroom-shaped rock\\", which houses two large solar panels that come up on top of Khao Ta Pu and lock on to the Sun. Khao Ta Pu is also featured in another James Bond film (Tomorrow Never Dies, identified as in Vietnam) and in the Italian film Quo Vado? (identified as in the Philippines). Khao Phing Kan and Ko Ta Pu Climate The area has a tropical monsoon climate, which is characterized by frequent rains and stable temperature. According to the data collected between 1961 and 1990, average number of rainy days is 189 per year bringing of precipitation, mostly between May and October. The temperature varies between and and the average relative humidity is 83%. Flora and fauna Butterflyfish Most of the island is covered with deciduous limestone shrubland and evergreen trees. Some plants, such as Pandanus, cycads, and euphorbs grow on nearly soil-free cliffs, such as those of Ko Ta Pu, penetrating their roots into the numerous cracks and surviving on rainwater. Shallow water depth, warm, stable temperature, and rich nutrient supply from mangrove forests and several rivers running into Phang Nga Bay result in abundant plankton and other marine life. The bay island hosts 26 species of reptiles, 24 species of fish, 14 species of shrimp, 15 species of crab, and 16 species of manta rays, sharks, and game fish. Most fishes are typical of coral reefs, such as butterflyfish. Other common inhabitants are blue crab, swimming crab, mudskipper, humpback shrimp, mud lobster, pomfret, sole, anchovy, scad, rock cod, rainbow cuttlefish, soft cuttlefish, musk crab, mackerel, moray eel, puffer fish, rabbitfish, groupers, black sea cucumber, brain coral, staghorn coral and flowerlike soft coral. Amphibians include Fejervarya raja, cricket frog (Fejervarya limnocharis) and the common tree frog. Aquatic plants are represented by red algae, Halimeda, seagrass, and plant plankton. There are more than 100 species of birds in the area such as the striated heron, Pacific reef heron, little egret and others.

The museum is situated in Battlefield Park, and is a complex made up of four buildings. Three of the buildings in the complex were purpose-built for the museum, while the other was initially built as a provincial prison, before being re-purposed for museum use. The institution was opened as the Mus√©e de la province de Qu√©bec in 1933. The museum initially served as the provincial archives, art, and natural science museum until 1962, when the natural science collection was removed. In the following year, the museum was renamed the Mus√©e du Quebec. The provincial archives were moved from the museum in 1979, leaving it solely as an art museum. In 2002, the museum was renamed the Mus√©e national des beaux-arts du Qu√©bec. Its collection includes over 40,000 works spanning from the 16th century, to the present day. Its collection primarily includes works that were produced in Quebec, or by Quebec artist, although it does also includes works from other parts of Canada, and the rest of the world. The museum is affiliated with the Canadian Museums Association, the Canadian Heritage Information Network, and the Virtual Museum of Canada. History Construction for the Pierre Lassonde Pavilion in 2014 Prior to the formal establishment of the museum, several items for the museum's art, and natural history collections were acquired for the museum prior to the institution's creation. The Premier of Quebec Lomer Gouin first presented the idea of starting a provincial collection of art as a part of a program to \\"define the Quebec nation,\\" although most of the actual program was organized under his successor, Louis-Alexandre Taschereau. The program formally began in March 1920, when the cabinet minister, Athanase David, announced an initiative that saw the province support artists by buying their works. Works initially acquired for this collection were selected by a five-man jury, who sought to affirm \\"innovative art trends,\\" found among artists in Quebec, as well as works that push the conception of a common rural past. In 1922, the legislature of Quebec passed the Loi des mus√©es de la province du Qu√©bec (), providing funding for the construction of museums throughout the province. However construction for the G√©rard-Morisset Pavilion did not begin until 1928; with the museum finally opened to the public in June 1933. Initially the museum operated as an art museum, a natural science museum, and as the provincial archives. The natural history collection was removed from the museum in 1962, and the institution was renamed Mus√©e du Qu√©bec the following year. The provincial archives was moved from the museum to the Universit√© Laval in 1979, leaving the institution with only its art collection. The institution was formally made into a provincial Crown corporation in 1983. From 1989 to 1991, the museum renovated and incorporating a former prison, Charles Baillairg√© Pavilion, into its building complex. The acquisition and renovation of the former prison building had more than doubled the surface space the museum had. The renovation of the former prison expanded the museum's viewing space to 12 galleries, as well as provided space for an auditorium, a giftshop, restaurant, storerooms, and a workshops. The museum's sculpture garden was completed shortly after the Charles Baillairgin√© Pavilion opened in 1993. In 2002, the museum was renamed the Mus√©e national des beaux- arts du Qu√©bec. In 2013, the museum began work on a new pavilion, the Pierre Lassonde Pavilion, and was opened in 2016. Architecture The G√©rard- Morisset Pavilion was the first building used by the museum The property is situated in Battlefield Park, with the museum complex made up of four buildings, the G√©rard-Morisset Pavilion, the Charles Baillairg√© Pavilion, the Pierre Lassonde Pavilion, and the Central Pavilion/Grand Hall. The pavilions are connected to one another through a tunnel network. =G√©rard-Morisset Pavilion= The G√©rard-Morisset Pavilion was the first building built for the museum. Work on the building began in May 1928, and was completed in early 1931. The building was designed in a Beaux-Arts style by Wilfrid Lacroix; while the reliefs on the facade were sculpted by Joseph-√âmile Brunet. The building was opened to the public in June 1933. The building features white marble, wide Victorian style steps, carved ceilings. In 2018, the museum completed renovations of the G√©rard-Morisset Pavilion, which saw the brightening of its viewing spaces, as well as harmonizing the structure with the rest of the museum complex. =Charles Baillairg√© Pavilion= Charles Baillairg√© Pavilion was formerly a prison that was later re-purposed by the museum The Charles Baillairg√© Pavilion is the second building that the museum occupied, although its age predates the other buildings in the museum complex. The pavilion was designed by Charles Baillairg√© in 1867, and was initially used as a prison. The design was modelled after the Auburn Correctional Facility, in Auburn, New York. The building was used to house inmates until 1970. Shortly after acquiring the property, the museum underwent a two-year renovation beginning in 1989. The renovations led to the creation of four exhibition galleries within the pavilion, as well as a section of preserved jail cells to highlight the building's former use as a prison. Designs for the renovation were by Charles Dorval and Louis Fortin. Along with the building, Dorval and Fortin also designed the underground access that connected G√©rard Morisset pavilion with the Charles Baillairg√© pavilion. In an effort to maintain the Battlefield Park, the design concealed a section of the new wing under the park's natural landscaping. The museum opened the pavilion to the public in May 1991. =Central Pavilion= The glass-facade pyramid, known as the Central Pavilion or Grand Hall was built during the 1989‚Äì1991 renovations of the museum complex, and was also designed by Dorval and Fortin. The Central Pavilion lies in between the G√©rard-Morisset Pavilion with the Charles Baillairg√© Pavilion, and serves as the museum's visitor centre. =Pierre Lassonde Pavilion= The Pierre Lassonde Pavilion in 2016, three years after its opening Construction of the Pierre Lassonde Pavilion began in 2013, and was opened in June 2016. The pavilion provides a glass-enclosed access from Grande All√©e to the rest of the museum complex, situated further within Battlefield Park. The pavilion was designed by the Office for Metropolitan Architecture, led by Jason Long, and Shohei Shigematsu, the lead partners for the design project.During the construction of the building, renovations were also undertaken to the museum's tunnel system, transforming them into viewing spaces. The building is adjacent to Saint-Dominique Church, and has a tunnel that provides indoor connection to the other pavilions of the museum complex. The pavilion largely uses glass and steel for its building material, in an effort to foster transparency between the museum, and the general public. The total cost for the construction of the pavilion was approximately C$103.4 million. The pavilion features of gallery space; and also includes a cafe in its main lobby, a courtyard adjacent to the lobby, a white spiral staircase, and a gold-coloured elevator. The building was named after Pierre Lassonde, a benefactor of the museum. The colouring of the gold elevator was chosen to reflect Lassonde's work with gold. Permanent collection As of March 2019, the museum's permanent collection includes 40,000 works from 4,524 different artists from Quebec, the rest of Canada, and around the world from the 16th century to present day. The legislative act that governs the institutions notes that the museum's purpose is to promote, and preserve art from Quebec, from all periods in history, as well as presence for international art. The museum's permanent collection was either acquired through donations, purchase, or ordered directly from the artist/collector/merchant. The first works acquired for the collection was from the Art Association of Montreal's 37th Spring Exhibition in 1920, although only six works acquired during that time remains in the museum's permanent collection. Each pavilion in the museum complex houses a different department of the museum's collection. G√©rard- Morisset Pavilion houses the museum's historical art collection; the Charles Baillairg√© Pavilion houses works of modern art, while the Pierre Lassonde Pavilion houses works of contemporary art. =Selected works= File:Gaspard- Joseph Chaussegros de L√©ry (1721-1797).jpgUnknown, Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de L√©ry, c. 1718.

Early military history  In 1846 the pro-British army leader Sir Jung Bahadur (1816‚Äì77) of the Rana family finally overthrew the Nepalese government and declared himself the prime minister. Like many dictatorships, Jung Bahadur's office was passed on through hereditary rather than valid elections. Jung Bahadur launched a successful military campaign in 1855 in Tibet (Nepalese- Tibetan War). But the Nepalese-Tibetan War exhausted Nepal's finances and in 1856 Tibet signed a peace treaty which granted diplomatic and commercial rights to Nepal on the condition that Tibet continue to pay a yearly \\"tribute\\" to the Nepalese government. Nepal aided Great Britain during the Indian Mutiny and during World War I. The British government in gratitude for Nepal's assistance declared the independence and sovereignty of Nepal to be genuine by the terms of a treaty concluded in 1923.  World War II  On September 4, 1939 Nepal declared war on Germany in solidarity with the Allied Forces, assisting the United Kingdom as they had in World War I and the Indian Mutiny. Twelve regiments of Gurkha soldiers from Nepal were sent to fight in the British Indian Army. Although Britain has been recruiting Gurkha soldiers from Nepal since the 19th century, no effort was made to develop a centralized recruit-training system in the Brigade of Gurkhas throughout the pre Second World War era. As a result, British Army recruiting training was conducted at the various Gurkha regimental training centres in India. After the end of the war, Nepal also established good diplomatic relations with the United States in 1948.  Nepal Civil War  Maoist insurgency. In February 1996, one of the Maoist parties started a bid to replace the constitutional monarchy and democratic government with a so-called people's new democratic republic, through a Maoist revolutionary strategy known as the people's war, which led to the Nepal Civil War. Led by Dr. Baburam Bhattarai and Pushpa Kamal Dahal (also known as \\"Prachanda\\", fierce in Nepalese), the insurgency began in five districts in Nepal: Rolpa, Rukum, Jajarkot, Gorkha, and Sindhuli. The Maoists have declared the existence of a provisional \\"people's government\\" at the district level in several locations The end of civil war and establishment of the democratic republic of Nepal The various parties of Nepal together conducted an anti-monarchy campaign by demonstrating and chanting slogans, and finally the king was compelled to declare a democracy. After the democracy the parties leaders had thrown out the monarchy and declared the democratic republic of Nepal. The civil war of Nepal caused by the Maoists had been concluded after the Maoists came into the political mainstream. All the Maoists combatants/militias were concentrated in cantonments and verified. Since last 6 years the leaders are engaged in a constitution building process.

It is based on the S.E.A. Write Award- winning novel by Chart Korbjitti, Khamphiphaksa (The Judgment, also the English-language title for the film). Plot A young man, Fak, is a revered novice Buddhist monk, and the entire village has turned out to the local temple to hear him preach a sermon. Fak's talk is interrupted a coughing fit by his widower father, though, and Fak struggles to maintain his focus. Fak then decides he must put aside his aspirations for monkhood to take care of his father. Then he is conscripted by lottery into the army. He hopes that when he completes his national service, he will return to the village, be ordained as a monk and devote his life to religion. On his return home from the army, the bus to his village breaks down. During the stop, Fak steps over to the side of the road, near a lotus pond, to urinate. There, among the lotus, he sees a beautiful woman bathing, fully clothed (as is customary in Thailand). Fak zips up and eventually arrives at home, where he finds his father in a very happy state. His father's reason for being so happy is that he has remarried. Fak's stepmother then appears from behind a mosquito net: it's the woman from the lotus pond. Her name is Somsong, and though she is sweet and devoted, there is something clearly wrong with her, perhaps some type of mental illness. Though there are happy times, with Fak joining his father at work as a janitor for the local school, his reunion with his father is short-lived after his father becomes ill and dies. Because Fak made a promise to his father that he would look after his stepmother, Fak's goal of returning to the monkhood must again be put aside. Though Fak is well liked in the village, the villagers do not like Somsong and have labeled her \\"crazy\\". And after Fak's father's death, the villagers start to treat Fak differently: they believe he is having an affair with his stepmother. Fak at first ignores the gossip, but it becomes harder and harder to deny because of Somsong's behavior. On one occasion, during a likay performance at a village fair, Fak is accosted by Somsong after she sees Fak talking with a young woman. Somsong is suffering from delusions that she and Fak are married, and she is jealous. Somsong also has the unfortunate habit of shedding her clothes and running naked in public, or simply lifting her dress and exposing herself. During one of these episodes, some villagers happen upon Fak just as he's chased the nude Somsong down and is attempting to cover her up. But what the villagers think they are witnessing is Fak having sex with his stepmother. Fak has been judged. Fak has taken his father's old job as school janitor. One day a dog that's thought to be rabid wanders onto the school grounds. Fak is given the job of killing it. He grabs a hoe and uses it to strike the animal, hitting it with a glancing blow that only injures it and makes it angrier. Fak eventually finishes the snarling dog off, but it is a bloody task. For a brief moment, Fak is seen as a hero by the students and faculty, and he feels a bit better about himself. Fak must prepare for his father's cremation. He invites the school's headmaster, the village headman and others. He orders 50 sandalwood blossoms for attendees to place on the burning casket. But no one shows up for the ceremony, except for the monks he engaged to chant over his father, and the local undertaker. Fak makes friends with the undertaker, a lowly person who is not well liked by the superstitious villagers because they believe he is unclean. Even Fak didn't particularly like the man, but after Fak tells him that he has never had sexual relations with Somsong, the man believes him. After the cremation rite, the undertaker offers Fak some rice whiskey. Fak at first doesn't like the taste or the way it makes him feel. But he has a few more drinks and starts enjoy himself. Looking for relief from the pressure of taking care of his mentally ill stepmother and the harsh judgment of the villagers, Fak turns to the bottle and becomes an alcoholic. His downward spiral continues until he has angered the villagers, and they turn on him and beat him, leaving him to be assisted home by Somsong.

Spencer County, Indiana was named in his honor. Biography A native of Virginia, Spencer moved to Kentucky with his parents. He married Elizabeth Polk, daughter of the noted Indian fighter Capt. Charles Polk, in Bardstown, Nelson County, Kentucky on January 18, 1793. Spencer and his wife moved to Vincennes, Indiana. In 1809 Spencer was appointed by Governor William Henry Harrison as the first sheriff of Harrison County, Indiana. He moved his family to Corydon and served in that office until his death.Kinter House Inn History Spencer and his wife ran \\"The Green Leaf Tavern,\\" in their large log home on Oak Street. Governor William Henry Harrison and Lieutenant Governor Ratliff Boon stayed there when they came on official business, as did delegates to the 1816 Indiana Constitution Convention. When tensions grew high between the settlers and the Native Americans, Spencer organized the Harrison County Militia known as the \\"Yellow Jackets\\" because of the color of their uniforms, for a campaign against them. The Battle of Tippecanoe on November 7, 1811 ended with Captain Spencer being seriously wounded during the battle. He was shot in the head and both thighs. When he was being carried off the field he was killed instantly by another shot. Spencer's horse and sword were brought back from the battle and were returned to his widow. The following account of the battle of Tippecanoe is taken from the official dispatch sent by General Harrison to the secretary of war, on the 18th of November, eleven days after the battle: \\"...Spencer was wounded in the head. He exhorted his men to fight valiantly. He was shot through both thighs and fell; still continuing to encourage them, he was raised up, and received a ball through his body, which put an immediate end to his existence...\\" Captain Spencer's bravery and the heroics of his men were lauded by General Harrison. He is the namesake of counties in Indiana and Kentucky as well as the town of Spencer, Indiana, the seat of Owen County. Spencer's widow continued operating The Green Leaf Tavern. When she married William Boone, she changed the name to the \\"Billy Boone Tavern\\". However, the marriage was short lived and she divorced Boone in 1829.

It was the ninth staging of the competition beginning with the 1994 edition and the ninth time it was held at the Circus Tavern. The competition was the first of 30 Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) tournaments in the 2002 season. Nine-time world champion Phil Taylor whitewashed second-time finalist Peter Manley 7‚Äì0 in the final. It was a rematch of the final of the 1999 PDC World Championship, which Taylor also won. Taylor won his eighth consecutive world championship and tenth overall. He defeated Paul Williams, Shayne Burgess, the 2001 tournament runner-up John Part, and Dave Askew on his way to the final. Taylor also achieved a 167 checkout, the highest of the competition, in his second round match against Burgess. Tournament summary =Background= The Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) was established under the World Darts Council name by the managers John Markovic, Tommy Cox and Dick Allix and the world's top 16 players in January 1992 as a separate body from the British Darts Organisation (BDO). The PDC World Darts Championship was first held in 1994 and is one of two world championships in the game of darts: the other being the BDO World Darts Championship. The 2002 tournament was held between 28 December 2001 and 5 January 2002 in Purfleet, Essex, and was the first of 30 PDC-sanctioned events in the 2002 season. It was the ninth edition of the tournament and featured a 32-player main draw that was played at the Circus Tavern. The Circus Tavern, where the tournament was held A total of 31 players automatically qualified for the main draw with 16 of them seeded. Alan Warriner was seeded first and Phil Taylor was the second seed. The remaining place was decided by a play-off round contested by members of the Professional Dart Players Association at the Beaufort Arms, Birmingham on 8 December 2001. Matt Chapman was the player who advanced from qualifying to the main draw, making his debut and only appearance at the tournament. Six more players debuted in the competition: Ronnie Baxter, Steve Beaton, Andy Jenkins, Chris Mason, Kevin Painter and Paul Williams after they moved to the PDC from the BDO. The maximum number of sets contested in a match increased from seven in the first round to eleven from the second round to the semi-finals, leading up to the final which was played as best-of-thirteen sets. Sponsored by the lager company Skol, the tournament had a total prize fund of ¬£205,000, and the host broadcaster was Sky Sports. Bookmakers and pundits considered Taylor the favourite to claim his eighth world championship in a row and tenth overall. Taylor said he had practised heavily to prepare for the tournament after he lost to Painter in the first round of the World Grand Prix: \\"I'm hungrier than I've ever been, so all those players who feel I can be beaten are going to be shown I am out to win and no one will be in my way. I have been doing loads of practice, three or four hours a day. I'm feeling good.\\" =Round 1= The draw for the first round of the championship was televised live on Sky Sports News and conducted by the broadcaster Sid Waddell, the director of the world championship Tommy Cox, and Painter in the late afternoon on 10 December 2001. The first round of the competition, in which all 32 players participated, took place from 28 and 30 December 2001. In this round the 2001 World Grand Prix champion Warriner defeated Reg Harding 4‚Äì2. Warriner won the first two sets before Harding took sets three and five for a 3‚Äì2 scoreline. He beat Harding 3‚Äì2 in the sixth set to win the match. Warriner said afterwards that his performance was inadequate. Colin Lloyd won 4‚Äì2 over Alex Roy after he came from 2‚Äì0 behind in the first and completing the fourth set with a 100 checkout. World number five and World Grand Prix semi-finalist Dennis Smith achieved the tournament's first whitewash when he defeated Paul Lim 4‚Äì0; Lim won only three legs during the match. Former world champion and eighth ranked Richie Burnett compiled checkouts of 142 and 124 points to defeat Peter Evison 4‚Äì1, a game which saw Evison fail to complete a nine-dart finish in the first leg of the third set after one of his darts landed less than away from the double 18 outer ring. Baxter achieved a three-dart average of 103 to defeat Painter 4‚Äì2. He led 3‚Äì1 before Painter won set five; Baxter won with a finish on the double 16 inner ring. The Irish Masters champion Denis Ovens converted a two-set deficit to Jenkins to force a final set decider which he won to claim a 4‚Äì3 victory. World number four Peter Manley achieved set victories of 3‚Äì1 and 3‚Äì0 to lead Steve Brown 2‚Äì0. Brown made a 115 checkout to win the third set before Manley took sets four and five to win 4‚Äì1 and progress to the second round of a PDC tournament for the first time since October 2000. In his 25th world championship appearance, John Lowe came from one set against Les Fitton to win four sets in a row. Lowe finished on the double nine outer ring to win 4‚Äì1. Shayne Burgess defeated Jamie Harvey 4‚Äì3; trailing 2‚Äì1 Burgess took the first two legs of set four and another three to equal the scoreline. He then took the next set before Harvey forced a final set decider. Checkouts of 111 and 85 put Burgess ahead until Harvey reduced his advantage. Harvey then missed five dart throws to land in an outer double ring and Burgess won the match. Another 4‚Äì3 victory occurred when Steve Beaton defeated Bob Anderson after leading 3‚Äì1 and Anderson won two sets in a row. After winning the sixth set, Beaton forced a final set decider, which he won 5‚Äì3. Taylor achieved a three-dart average of 98.2 points in defeating Paul Williams 4‚Äì1. Dave Askew defeated the English Open champion Mason 4‚Äì3 in a seven-set match. The World Grand Prix runner-up Roland Scholten won 4‚Äì1 over Cliff Lazarenko. Scholten took the opening set before Lazarenko made a 82 checkout to win the second. Scholten won three consecutive sets to enter the second round. John Part, the runner-up of the 2001 edition, won 4‚Äì2 against Mick Manning. Part took the first two sets and Manning the third. Manning compiled a 110 checkout and had a finish on the double ten outer ring to win set four after Part missed five chances to hit an outer double ring. Part then won six legs in a row to win the match. World number three Rod Harrington beat Keith Deller, the 1983 world champion, 4‚Äì3. Tied 2‚Äì2, Harrington argued with Deller about a perceived positioning of Deller's left leg in retrieving his darts from the board and the time it took to do so. That caused Harrington to clip Deller's heel while he was throwing, which he did not admit to doing until 2016. Deller won the fifth set with a finish on the outer double 16 ring. Harrington took the sixth set to force a final set decider, which he won on a 58 checkout. Harrington kicking Deller was the catalyst for the creation of the exclusion zone, an area that players are not allowed to enter when their opponent is in action. In the first round's final match the two-time world champion Dennis Priestley lost a solitary set in a 4‚Äì1 win over Chapman. =Round 2= John Lowe (pictured in 2009) was eliminated in the second round of the tournament The second round was played to the best-of-11 sets from 30 December 2000 and 2 January 2001. Lloyd became the first player through to the quarter-finals with a 6‚Äì4 victory over Warriner, who was the first player ranked in the top ten to lose in the tournament. Lloyd took the first three sets before Warriner took a 4‚Äì3 lead. He then recovered to win the match, calling it \\"one of the best performances of my career.\\" Burnett took more than two hours to defeat Ovens 6‚Äì4 after neither player led by more than a set until the end of the match. Baxter took a little more than one hour to beat Smith 6‚Äì1. He claimed the first set and Smith the second. Baxter's higher finishing average won him six consecutive legs in the middle of the game en route to victory. Manley defeated Lowe 6‚Äì5. He took the lead in set one before Lowe claimed the second with a 121 checkout. Lowe won sets three and four to take the lead until Manley nullified this to tie the match. The game went to a final set decider which Manley won 3‚Äì0. After the match, Manley said he had not expected a strong performance from Lowe. Taylor had a three-dart average of 111.21 points, completed respective checkouts of 140 and 167 points and two finishes of ten dart throws to defeat Burgess 6‚Äì1; Burgess won four legs during the game's concluding two sets. Askew overcame a challenge from Scholten to win 6‚Äì3. Both players equalled each other's form before Askew moved ahead with victories in the fifth and sixth sets. Scholten subsequently made a 13-dart finish to claim set seven before Askew replied to win the next two sets and the match. Part compiled ten maximum scores (180), checkouts of 116 and 117 and achieved a three-dart average of 98.68 points to complete a 6‚Äì0 whitewash of Beaton. The final second round match saw Priestley play the two time World Matchplay champion Harrington. After both players began at a slow pace with Harrington compiling high scores and missing checkouts and Priestley making checkouts without high scores, the latter took the lead in the match and a 6‚Äì3 victory after Harrington failed to complete a 169 checkout. =Quarter- finals= The four quarter-finals were played as best-of-11 sets on 3 January 2002. The first quarter-final match was played between Lloyd and Burnett. Although Burnett was heavily favoured to win, Lloyd took a 5‚Äì0 lead and appeared set to complete a 6‚Äì0 whitewash until Burnett won four consecutive sets to go 5‚Äì4 behind. Lloyd took three successive legs to win the match 6‚Äì4 and was the first player to earn a semi-final berth. Lloyd said post-match that he was surprised over his early lead: \\"I've played good darts in the last three games but I've let them come back at me. But the main thing about my play this year is that I haven't let my head drop. They have come back at me but I've said 'keep fighting Lloydy' and you're going to get there. That's what's made the difference. I'm not going to give up.\\" The second game had Askew take an early lead over Priestley until the latter won two sets in a row to lead 2‚Äì1. Askew then tied the match at 2‚Äì2 and took four more sets and made a 100 checkout to win 6‚Äì2. In the next quarter-final, pre-match favourite Baxter played Manley. Both players shared the first four sets before Manley achieved a 123 checkout in the fifth set to move into a clear lead. Manley claimed three more sets for a 6‚Äì2 victory. The final match of the quarter- finals saw Taylor play Part in a rematch of the 2001 world championship final. Taylor took the first three sets before he achieved seven maximums and failed to complete a nine-dart finish in the fourth set when his eighth dart throw landed inside the single seven ring. He then completed a 6‚Äì0 whitewash of Part after he won two more sets and had achieved a three-dart average of 100.23 points; Part forced a final leg decider in the fifth and sixth sets before Taylor defeated him. Taylor admitted he had not expected to whitewash Part: \\"I thought I would be beat him but not so easily. I think John is a better player than that. The way he played against Steve Beaton was brilliant and no one beats Steve 6‚Äì0 easily.\\" =Semi-finals= Peter Manley (pictured in 2007) reached the second world championship final of his career with a 6‚Äì4 win over Colin Lloyd. Both of the semi-finals were best-of-11 sets on 4 January 2002. The first semi-final pitted Manley against Lloyd. Manley won the first set and Lloyd the second from checkouts of 105, 137 and 46. Lloyd took the third set after Manley produced a 111 checkout from eleven darts thrown. Both players shared the following two sets; Manley took the fourth on the outer double ten ring and Lloyd the fifth from checkouts of 134 and 91. Manley won sets six and seven and Lloyd the eighth. Manley retook the lead after the ninth set and claimed a 6‚Äì4 victory after the final set went to a fifth leg which he won on the outer double eight ring. Lloyd made ten maximums to Manley's eight. Manley said he was annoyed with the easy removal of flights on Lloyd's darts and felt the latter slowed the match. Lloyd stated a warm arena reduced his hand grip and denied employing gamesmanship to slow Manley. Taylor faced Askew in the other semi-final. Askew took the first two legs of the first set. Taylor came from behind to claim the set after Askew missed four opportunities to hit a double in its third leg. Taylor subsequently won the next six legs to lead 3‚Äì0. Askew ended the streak by winning one leg in the fourth set as Taylor secured the set. Taylor then took sets five and six for a 6‚Äì1 win, only losing one leg in each of the final two sets. Post-match Taylor said Askew had put him under pressure: \\"I could feel Dave was under pressure from the start and I knew that if he hit 140, then I had to follow him. I just kept on top of him\\", and commented on Manley's challenge to him, \\"It's either going to be a walkover or a cracker, and I think it will be a good match. Peter will push me, but If I push him back he'll go.\\" =Final= Phil Taylor (pictured in 2009) won his tenth world darts championship and eighth in a row with a 7‚Äì0 whitewash of Manley. The final between Manley and Taylor on 5 January 2002 was contested as the best-of-13 sets. To reach the 2002 final, Taylor had defeated Paul Williams, Shayne Burgess, John Part and Dave Askew, while Manley had beaten Steve Brown, John Lowe, Ronnie Baxter and Colin Lloyd. This was Taylor's eleventh world championship final and his ninth in a row in the PDC. He had previously won the world championship nine times in 1990, 1992, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001. Manley appeared in his second world championship final, having finished runner-up to Taylor in the 1999 tournament. Taylor won the first set 3‚Äì0. Manley was unable to land a dart in the outer double 20 ring in the second set before he completed a checkout on the outer double ten ring to win his first leg of the match. He then was unable to convert eight more opportunities and Taylor's finishing allowed him to clinch set two 3‚Äì1. In the third set Taylor produced a 104 checkout and a 13-dart finish to win it 3‚Äì0. Taylor led the fourth set 2‚Äì0 when he failed to convert a 100 checkout and Manley won the third leg. He then responded to compile a 11-dart finish and take the set. The fifth set saw Manley win his first leg after he missed the outer double eight ring on his first try. Taylor took four legs in a row to win the fifth set 3‚Äì1 and the sixth 3‚Äì0. In the first leg of the final set, Manley was unable to land a dart in the outer double ten ring and Taylor whitewashed him 7‚Äì0 to win the world championship. It was Taylor's tenth world championship win and eighth in a row; he won ¬£50,000 for winning the tournament and a further ¬£1,000 for compiling its highest checkout, a 167. After the match, Manley did not shake Taylor's hand and walked off the stage to use the urinal facilities. He later shook Taylor's hand but not before the crowd booed him. Taylor said he was delighted to win the championship and represented Manley leaving the stage as less important than it was: \\"What you must remember is all the professionals are winners and Peter deserved to be up here in the final. He was gutted but he came back and shook my hand and that is the end of it. It is extra special because it is ¬£50,000 and I do feel sorry for people who had a bet on a nine-darter because with me and Pete I thought it might come.\\" Taylor said he wanted to win 13 world championships because it is his lucky number. Manley said he enjoyed playing in the final and complemented Taylor's ability: \\"I had some hard games to come through and I beat my mate Ronnie Baxter and he would probably have been a better player to beat Phil tonight. But Phil is the greatest player ever to walk the earth.\\" Writing for The Daily Telegraph journalist Simon Hughes felt Taylor's tenth world championship had exceeded the achievements of the snooker players Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry and the rower Steve Redgrave. Mel Webb of The Times felt Taylor's number of world championships was unlikely to be eclipsed by other players bar Taylor himself: \\"Nobody, not even Tiger Woods or Don Bradman, has dominated his sport as overwhelmingly as Taylor does his.\\" Prize fund The breakdown of prize money for 2002 is shown below. * Winner: ¬£50,000 * Runner-up: ¬£25,000 * Semi-finalists (√ó2): ¬£12,500 * Quarter- finalists (√ó4): ¬£7,000 * Last 16 (√ó8): ¬£4,500 * Last 32 (√ó16): ¬£2,500 * 9 dart checkout: ¬£100,000 * Highest checkout: ¬£1,000 * Total: ¬£205,000 Draw Numbers given to the left of players' names show the seedings for the top 16 in the tournament.

This roadside attraction has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1988. Built in 1937 to attract attention of passing motorists, these are similar to such structures as the Benewah Milk Bottle, the Teapot Dome Service Station, or the comparably colossal Dinosaur Park sculptures in South Dakota. These were all built in a period of time when automobile travel became increasingly affordable and popular.Determining the Facts Reading 3: The Roadside Colossus, Roadside Attractions, National Park Service. This pair of statues are said by the Kodak Company to be the \\"second most photographed statues in the United States\\", behind Mount Rushmore in South Dakota. History The city of Bemidji is located in a vast woodland and lake region. As early as the 1890s, the town enjoyed a modest tourist trade. When rail connections were constructed to Bemidji in 1898, promoters began the development of lakeshore sites for cottages, hotels, and resorts. Most of these resorts catered to hunters and anglers. In the 1920s the rise in automobile popularity and affordability contributed to a significant boom in Bemidji's tourist industry, but it suffered during the Great Depression. Enter Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox. As a means of stimulating tourism in Bemidji, a number of local, civic organizations sponsored a winter carnival meant to promote the city's resources for winter sports. Due to Bemidji's once prominent status as a logging and lumbering center, the celebrations focused on Paul Bunyan, the larger-than life lumberjack who is an American folk hero. On January 14, 1937 the carnival opened with Earl L. Grinols, Sr., elected as the carnival king. Two giant statues were unveiled at the event: one of Bunyan and the other of his giant blue ox, Babe; the pair were to serve as carnival mascots. Babe was brought into town on a Grinols Implement & Fuel Co. truck arranged so that its exhaust exited through Babe's nostrils. The statues were designed by Lennord L. Pitney of Park Rapids, Minnesota. In March 2006, the Rotary Club of Bemidji raised $53,000; along with a $68,000 federal grant, the club undertook to repair some damage to the statues. The money was also allocated for use in maintenance, with the majority slated for stabilizing the ground beneath the statues, to lessen shifting in freezing temperatures. The work included repairing a crack in Babe from the neck to the hindquarters; this had continued to widen despite yearly fixes by the city with caulk and blue paint.Babe the Blue Ox gets fed highway funding, UPI, March 14, 2006. retrieved Dec. 2010 In October of 2013, local organizers ran the first Bemidji Blue Ox Marathon and planned the course to run past the statues.

It covers civil wars and wars of aggression and of self-defence both within South Africa and against it. It includes the history of battles fought in the territories of modern South Africa in neighbouring territories, in both world wars and in modern international conflicts. Prehistory Before the arrival of any European settlers in South Africa the Southern part of Africa was inhabited by the San people. As far as military history of South Africa is concerned, African tribes frequently waged war against each other and made alliances for survival. The succession of Bantu immigrants from Central Africa during the time of the Bantu expansion initially led to the formation of merged tribes such as the Masarwa. After some time Bantu immigrants of greater strength invaded much of the traditional San territories. Archeological research suggests that each Bantu succession had better weapons than their predecessors enabling them to dominate the eastern parts of South Africa thereby forcing the Khoisan into less desirable parts of the country.Ethnography and Condition of South Africa Before A.D. 1505, George McCall Theal, London 1919. About the middle of the 18th century several clashes occurred between the Khoisan and the advancing Bantu tribes known as the Batlapin and the more powerful Barolong. These invaders would take as slaves those who had been conquered and referred to them as the Balala. During battle the defenders were armed with strong bows, and poisoned arrows; they also used the assegai and battle-axe, and protected their bodies with a small shield. In a fight in the open plain they had little chance in defeating the invaders, though when attacked on a mountain or among rocks they managed to beat of their enemies. Khoikhoi- Dutch Wars The arrival of the permanent settlements of Europeans, under the Dutch East India Company, at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652 brought them into the land of the local people, such as the Khoikhoi (called Hottentots by the Dutch), and the Bushmen (also known as the San), collectively referred to as the Khoisan. While the Dutch traded with the Khoikhoi, nevertheless serious disputes broke out over land ownership and livestock. This resulted in attacks and counter-attacks by both sides which were known as the Khoikhoi‚ÄìDutch Wars that ended in the eventual defeat of the Khoikhoi. The First Khoikhoi-Dutch War took place from 1659 ‚Äì 1660 and the second from 1673 ‚Äì 1677.Scientia Militaria, South African Journal of Military Studies, Vol 16, Nr 3, A short chronicle of warfare in South Africa, compiled by the Military Information Bureau, Page 40 Anglo-Dutch rivalry =Castle of Good Hope= During 1664, tensions between England and the Netherlands rose with rumours of war being imminent ‚Äì that same year, Commander Zacharius Wagenaer was instructed to build a pentagonal castle out of stone at . On 26 April 1679, the five bastions were built. The Castle of Good Hope is a fortification which was built on the original coastline of Table Bay and now, because of land reclamation, seems nearer the centre of Cape Town, South Africa. Built by the VOC between 1666 and 1679, the Castle is the oldest building in South Africa. The Castle acted as local headquarters for the South African Army in the Western Cape, but today houses the Castle Military Museum and ceremonial facilities for the traditional Cape Regiments. =Battle of Muizenberg= The Battle of Muizenberg was a small but significant battle for the future destiny of South Africa which took place at Muizenberg (near Cape Town), South Africa in 1795; it led to the capture of the Cape Colony by the United Kingdom. A fleet of seven Royal Navy ships ‚Äì five third-rates, Monarch (74), Victorious (74), Arrogant (74), America (64) and Stately (64), with the 16-gun sloops Echo and Rattlesnake ‚Äì under Vice-Admiral Elphinstone anchored in Simon's Bay at the Cape of Good Hope in June 1795, having left England on 1 March. Their commander suggested to the Dutch governor that he place the Cape Colony under the protection of the British monarch ‚Äì in effect, that he hand the colony over to Britain ‚Äì which was refused. Simon's Town was occupied on 14 June by a force of 350 Royal Marines and 450 men of the 78th Highlanders, before the defenders could burn the town. Following skirmishes on 1 and 2 September, a final general attempt to recapture the camp was prepared by the Dutch for the 3rd, but at this point the British reinforcements arrived and the Dutch withdrew. A British advance on Cape Town, with the new reinforcements, began on the 14th; on the 16th, the colony capitulated. The British assumed control of the Cape of Good Hope for the next seven years. The Cape was returned to the restored Dutch government (known as the Batavian Government) in 1804. In 1806 the British returned and after again defeating the Dutch at the Battle of Blaauwberg, stayed in control for more than 100 years. Xhosa wars The Xhosa Wars (also known as the Kaffir Wars or Cape Frontier Wars) were a series of nine wars between parts of the Xhosa people, and European settlers with their Xhosa allies, from 1779 and 1879 in what is now the Eastern Cape in South Africa. The wars were responsible for the Xhosa people's loss of most of their land, and the incorporation of its people into European-controlled territories. King Shaka Zulu holding an assegai and heavy shield, 1824. Ndwandwe-Zulu War The Ndwandwe-Zulu War of 1817‚Äì1819 was a war fought between the expanding Zulu kingdom and the Ndwandwe tribe in South Africa. Shaka revolutionised traditional ways of fighting by introducing the assegai, a spear with a short shaft and broad blade, used as a close-quarters stabbing weapon. (Under Shaka's rule, losing an assegai was punishable by death. So it was never thrown like a javelin.) He also organised warriors into disciplined units known as Impis that fought in close formation behind large cowhide shields. In the Battle of Gqokli Hill in 1819, his troops and tactics prevailed over the superior numbers of the Ndwandwe people, who failed to destroy the Zulu in their first encounter. The Ndwandwe and the Zulus met again in combat at the Battle of Mhlatuze River in 1820. The Zulu tactics again prevailed, pressing their attack when the Ndwandwe army was divided during the crossing of the Mhlatuze River. Zulu warriors arrived at the Ndwande King Zwide's headquarters near present-day Nongoma before news of the defeat, and approached the camp singing Ndwandwe victory songs to gain entry. Zwide fled with some of his offspring including Madzanga. Most of the Ndwandwe abandoned their lands and migrated north and eastward. This was the start of the Mfecane, a catastrophic, bloody migration of many different tribes in the area, initially escaping the Zulus, but themselves causing their own havoc after adopting Zulu tactics in war. Shaka was the ultimate victor, and his (more peaceful) descendants still live today throughout Zululand, with customs and a way of life that can be easily traced to Shaka's day. Mfecane Mfecane (Zulu), also known as the Difaqane or Lifaqane (Sesotho), is an African expression which means something like \\"the crushing\\" or \\"scattering\\". It describes a period of widespread chaos and disturbance in southern Africa during the period between 1815 and about 1835. The Mfecane resulted from the rise to power of Shaka, the Zulu king and military leader who conquered the Nguni peoples between the Tugela and Pongola rivers in the beginning of the 19th century, and created a militaristic kingdom in the region. The Mfecane also led to the formation and consolidation of other groups ‚Äì such as the Matabele, the Mfengu and the Makololo ‚Äì and the creation of states such as the modern Lesotho. Battles between Voortrekkers and Zulus Zulu attack on a Boer camp in February 1838 The Battle of Italeni in what is now KwaZulu- Natal, South Africa, in early 1838, between the Voortrekkers and the Zulus during the period of the Great Trek, resulted in the Zulu armies repulsing the Voortrekkers. On 9 April, near the Babanango Mountain Range a large Zulu impi (army) appeared, consisting of approximately 8,000 warriors. The Voortrekker commandos returned to their camp on 12 April. Boer general Piet Uys formed a raiding party of fifteen volunteers (including his son, Dirkie Uys.) During subsequent fighting Uys, his son, the Malan brothers as well as five of the volunteers were killed, and the Voortrekkers were forced to retreat. It has been speculated that, without the lessons learnt as a result of the Battle of Italeni ‚Äì such as fighting from the shelter of ox-wagons whenever possible and choosing the place of battle rather than being enticed into unfavourable terrain ‚Äì the Voortrekkers would not have succeeded in finally beating the Zulus at the Battle of Blood River eight months later. The Battle of Blood River () was fought on 16 December 1838 on the banks of the Blood River (Bloedrivier) in what is today KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. In the aftermath of the Weenen massacre, a group of about 470 Voortrekkers, led by Andries Pretorius, defended a laager (circle of ox wagons) against Zulu impis, ruled by King Dingane and led by Dambuza (Nzobo) and Ndlela kaSompisi, numbering between 10 and 20 thousand. The Zulus repeatedly and unsuccessfully attacked the laager, until Pretorius ordered a group of horse riders to leave the encampment and engage the Zulus. Partly due to the fact that the Voortrekkers used rifles and at least one light cannon against the Zulus' spears, as well as the good location and motivation of the Voortrekkers, only three Voortrekkers were wounded and none perished; that contrasted against the more than 3,000 Zulu warriors who died. The Voortrekkers credited God as the reason why they had won the battle as they had made a covenant asking for protection beforehand. The Anglo-Zulu War Battle of Isandlwana The Anglo-Zulu War was fought in 1879 between Britain and the Zulus, and signalled the end of the Zulus as an independent nation. It was precipitated by Sir Bartle Frere High Commissioner for Southern Africa who manufactured a casus belli and prepared an invasion without the approval of Her Majesty's government. At the Battle of Isandlwana (22 January 1879), the Zulu overwhelmed and wiped out 1,400 British soldiers. This battle is considered to be one of the greatest disasters in British colonial history. Isandlwana forced the policy makers in London to rally to the support of the pro-war contingent in the Natal government and commit whatever resources were needed to defeat the Zulu. The first invasion of Zululand ended with the catastrophe of Isandlwana where, along with heavy casualties, the main centre column lost all supplies, transport and ammunition and the British would be forced to halt their advances elsewhere while a new invasion was prepared. At Rorke's Drift (22‚Äì23 January 1879) 139 British soldiers successfully defended the station against an intense assault by four to five thousand Zulu warriors. The Battle of Intombe was fought on 12 March 1879, between British and Zulu forces. The Siege of Eshowe took place during a three-pronged attack on the Impis of Cetshwayo at Ulundi. The Battle of Gingindlovu (uMgungundlovu) was fought between a British relief column sent to break the Siege of Eshowe and the Impis of Cetshwayo on 2 April 1879. The battle restored the British commanders' confidence in their army and their ability to defeat Zulu. With the last resistance removed, they were able to advance and relieve Eshowe. The Battle of Hlobane was a total disaster for the British; 15 officers and 110 men were killed, a further 8 wounded and 100 native soldiers died. The Battle of Kambula took place in 1879 when a Zulu army attacked the British camp at Kambula, resulting in a massive Zulu defeat. The Battle of Ulundi took place at the Zulu capital of Ulundi on 4 July 1879 and proved to be the decisive battle that finally broke the military power of the Zulu nation. Boer Wars =First Anglo-Boer War= The First Boer War, also known as the First Anglo-Boer War or the Transvaal War, was fought from 16 December 1880 until 23 March 1881 and was the first clash between the British and the South African Republic (Z.A.R.) Boers. It was precipitated by Sir Theophilus Shepstone, who annexed the South African Republic (Transvaal Republic) for the British in 1877. The British consolidated their power over most of the colonies of South Africa in 1879 after the Anglo-Zulu War, and attempted to impose an unpopular system of confederation on the region. The Boers protested, and in December 1880 they revolted. The battles of Bronkhorstspruit, Laing's Nek, Schuinshoogte, and Majuba Hill proved disastrous for the British where they found themselves outmaneuvered and outperformed by the highly mobile and skilled Boer marksmen. With the British commander-in-chief of Natal, George Pomeroy Colley, killed at Majuba, and British garrisons under siege across the entire Transvaal, the British were unwilling to further involve themselves in a war which was already seen as lost. As a result, William Gladstone's British government signed a truce on 6 March, and in the final peace treaty on 23 March 1881, gave the Boers self- government in the South African Republic (Transvaal) under a theoretical British oversight. =Jameson Raid= The Jameson Raid (29 December 1895 ‚Äì 2 January 1896) was a raid on Paul Kruger's Transvaal Republic carried out by Leander Starr Jameson and his Rhodesian and Bechuanaland policemen over the New Year weekend of 1895‚Äì96. It was intended to trigger an uprising by the primarily British expatriate workers (known as Uitlanders, or in English \\"Foreigners\\") in the Transvaal but failed to do so. Though the raid was ineffective and no uprising took place, it did much to bring about the Second Boer War and the Second Matabele War. The affair brought Anglo-Boer relations to a dangerous low, and the ill feeling was heightened by the \\"Kruger telegram\\" from the German Emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm II. It congratulated Paul Kruger for defeating the raid, as well as appearing to recognise the Boer republic and offer support. The emperor was already perceived as anti-British, and a naval arms race had started between Germany and Britain. Consequently, the telegram alarmed and angered the British. =Second Anglo-Boer War= Siege of Ladysmith The Second Boer War, also known as the Second Anglo-Boer War, the Second Freedom War (Afrikaans) and referred to as the South African War in modern times took place from 11 October 1899 ‚Äì 31 May 1902. The war was fought between Great Britain and the two independent Boer republics of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic (referred to as the Transvaal by the British). After a protracted hard-fought war, the two independent republics lost and were absorbed into the British Empire. In all, the war had cost around 75,000 lives ‚Äì 22,000 British soldiers (7,792 battle casualties, the rest through disease), 6,000‚Äì7,000 Boer Commandos, 20,000‚Äì28,000 Boer civilians, mostly women and children due to disease in concentration camps, and an estimated 20,000 black Africans, Boer allies, who died in their own separate concentration camps. The last of the Boer forces surrendered in May 1902 and the war ended with the Treaty of Vereeniging in the same month. The war resulted in the creation of the Transvaal Colony which in 1910 was incorporated into the Union of South Africa. The treaty ended the existence of the South African Republic and the Orange Free State as Boer republics and placed them within the British Empire. The Boers referred to the two wars as the Freedom Wars. Those Boers who wanted to continue the fight were known as \\"bitter-einders\\" (or irreconcilables) and at the end of the war a number like Deneys Reitz chose exile rather than sign an undertaking that they would abide by the peace terms. Over the following decade, many returned to South Africa and never signed the undertaking. Some, like Reitz, eventually reconciled themselves to the new status quo, but others waited for a suitable opportunity to restart the old quarrel. At the start of World War I the bitter-einders and their allies took part in a revolt known as the Maritz Rebellion. World War I =Bonds with the British Empire= During the First World War, Smuts (right) and Botha were key members of the British Imperial War Cabinet. The Union of South Africa, which came into being in 1910, tied closely to the British Empire, joined Great Britain and the allies against the German Empire. Prime Minister Louis Botha and Defence Minister Jan Smuts, both former Second Boer War generals who had fought against the British then, now became active and respected members of the Imperial War Cabinet. (See Jan Smuts during World War I.) The Union Defence Force was part of significant military operations against Germany. In spite of Boer resistance at home, the Afrikaner-led government of Louis Botha joined the side of the Allies of World War I and fought alongside its armies. The South African Government agreed to the withdrawal of British Army units so that they were free to join the European war, and laid plans to invade German South-West Africa. Elements of the South African army refused to fight against the Germans and along with other opponents of the Government rose in open revolt. The government declared martial law on 14 October 1914, and forces loyal to the government under the command of General Louis Botha and Jan Smuts proceeded to destroy the Maritz Rebellion. The leading Boer rebels got off lightly with terms of imprisonment of six and seven years and heavy fines. (See World War I and the Maritz Rebellion.) =Military action against Germany during World War I= The Union Defence Force saw action in a number of places: # It dispatched its army to German South-West Africa, later known as South West Africa, and now known as Namibia. The South Africans expelled German forces and gained control of the former German colony. (See German South-West Africa in World War I.) # A military expedition under General Jan Smuts was dispatched to German East Africa (later known as Tanganyika) and now known as Tanzania. The objective was to fight German forces in that colony and to try to capture the elusive German General von Lettow-Vorbeck. Ultimately, Lettow-Vorbeck fought his tiny force out of German East Africa into Mozambique then Northern Rhodesia, where he accepted a cease-fire three days after the end of the war (see East African Campaign (World War I)). # 1st South African Brigade troops were shipped to France to fight on the Western Front. The most costly battle that the South African forces on the Western Front fought in was the Battle of Delville Wood in 1916. (See South African Army in World War I and South African Overseas Expeditionary Force.) # South Africans also saw action with the Cape Corps as part of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in Palestine. (See Cape Corps 1915‚Äì1991) =Military contributions and casualties in World War I= More than 146,000 whites, 83,000 blacks and 2,500 people of mixed race (\\"Coloureds\\") and Asians served in South African military units during the war, including 43,000 in German South-West Africa and 30,000 on the Western Front. An estimated 3,000 South Africans also joined the Royal Flying Corps. The total South African casualties during the war was about 18,600 with over 12,452 killed ‚Äì more than 4,600 in the European theatre alone. The Commonwealth War Graves commission has records of 9457 known South African War dead during World War I. The British Empire is red on the map, at its zenith in 1921. (India highlighted in purple.) South Africa, bottom centre, lies between both halves of the Empire. There is no question that South Africa greatly assisted the Allies, and Great Britain in particular, in capturing the two German colonies of German South West Africa and German East Africa as well as in battles in Western Europe and the Middle East. South Africa's ports and harbours, such as at Cape Town, Durban, and Simon's Town, were also important rest-stops, refuelling-stations, and served as strategic assets to the British Royal Navy during the war, helping to keep the vital sea lanes to the British Raj open. World War II =Political choices at outbreak of war= On the eve of World War II the Union of South Africa found itself in a unique political and military quandary. While it was closely allied with Great Britain, being a co-equal Dominion under the 1931 Statute of Westminster with its head of state being the British king, the South African Prime Minister on 1 September 1939 was none other than Barry Hertzog the leader of the pro- Afrikaner anti-British National party that had joined in a unity government as the United Party. Hertzog's problem was that South Africa was constitutionally obligated to support Great Britain against Nazi Germany. The Polish-British Common Defence Pact obligated Britain, and in turn its dominions, to help Poland if attacked by the Nazis. After Hitler's forces attacked Poland in the morning of 1 September 1939, Britain declared war on Germany within a few days. A short but furious debate unfolded in South Africa, especially in the halls of power in the Parliament of South Africa, that pitted those who sought to enter the war on Britain's side, led by the pro-Allied pro-British Afrikaner and former Prime Minister Jan Smuts and General against then-current Prime Minister Barry Hertzog who wished to keep South Africa \\"neutral\\", if not pro-Axis. =Declaration of war against the Axis= On 4 September 1939, the United Party caucus refused to accept Hertzog's stance of neutrality in World War II and deposed him in favour of Smuts. Upon becoming Prime Minister of South Africa, Smuts declared South Africa officially at war with Germany and the Axis. Smuts immediately set about fortifying South Africa against any possible German sea invasion because of South Africa's global strategic importance controlling the long sea route around the Cape of Good Hope. Smuts took severe action against the pro-Nazi South African Ossewabrandwag movement (they were caught committing acts of sabotage) and jailed its leaders for the duration of the war. (One of them, John Vorster, was to become future Prime Minister of South Africa.) (See Jan Smuts during World War II.) =Prime Minister and Field Marshal Smuts= Prime Minister Jan Smuts was the only important non-British general whose advice was constantly sought by Britain's war-time Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Smuts was invited to the Imperial War Cabinet in 1939 as the most senior South African in favour of war. On 28 May 1941, Smuts was appointed a Field Marshal of the British Army, becoming the first South African to hold that rank. Ultimately, Smuts would pay a steep political price for his closeness to the British establishment, to the King, and to Churchill which had made Smuts very unpopular among the conservative nationalistic Afrikaners, leading to his eventual downfall, whereas most English-speaking whites and a minority of liberal Afrikaners in South Africa remained loyal to him. (See Jan Smuts during World War II.) =Military contributions in World War II= Field Marshal Jan Smuts inspects South African sailors in Alexandria, Egypt, 16 May 1942 South African Air Force in Libya South Africa and its military forces contributed in many theatres of war. South Africa's contribution consisted mainly of supplying troops, airmen and material for the North African campaign (the Desert War) and the Italian Campaign as well as to Allied ships that docked at its crucial ports adjoining the Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean that converge at the tip of Southern Africa. Numerous volunteers also flew for the Royal Air Force. (See: South African Army in World War II; South African Air Force in World War II; South African Navy in World War II.) # The South African Army and Air Force played a major role in defeating the Italian forces of Benito Mussolini during the 1940/1941 East African Campaign. The converted Junkers Ju 86s of 12 Squadron, South African Air Force, carried out the first bombing raid of the campaign on a concentration of tanks at Moyale at 8 am on 11 June 1940, mere hours after Italy's declaration of war. # Another important victory that the South Africans participated in was the capture of Malagasy (now known as Madagascar) from the control of the Vichy French. British troops aided by South African soldiers, staged their attack from South Africa, landing on the strategic island on 4 May 1942 to preclude its seizure by the Japanese. # The South African 1st Infantry Division took part in several actions in East Africa (1940) and North Africa (1941 and 1942), including the Battle of El Alamein, before being withdrawn to South Africa. # The South African 2nd Infantry Division also took part in a number of actions in North Africa during 1942, but on 21 June 1942 two complete infantry brigades of the division as well as most of the supporting units were captured at the fall of Tobruk. # The South African 3rd Infantry Division never took an active part in any battles but instead organised and trained the South African home defence forces, performed garrison duties and supplied replacements for the South African 1st Infantry Division and the South African 2nd Infantry Division. However, one of this division's constituent brigades ‚Äì 7 SA Motorised Brigade ‚Äì did take part in the invasion of Madagascar in 1942. # The South African 6th Armoured Division fought in numerous actions in Italy from 1944 to 1945. # The South African Air Force SAAF made a significant contribution to the air war in East Africa, North Africa, Sicily, Italy, the Balkans and even as far east as bombing missions aimed at the Romanian oilfields in Ploie»ôti, supply missions in support of the Warsaw uprising and reconnaissance missions ahead of the Russian advances in the Lvov-Cracow area. # Numerous South African airmen also volunteered service to the RAF, some serving with distinction. # South Africa contributed to the war effort against Japan, supplying men and manning ships in naval engagements against the Japanese. Of the 334,000 men volunteered for full-time service in the South African Army during the war (including some 211,000 whites, 77,000 blacks and 46,000 \\"coloureds\\" and Asians), nearly 9,000 were killed in action. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission has records of 11,023 known South African war dead during World War II. However, not all South Africans supported the war effort. The Anglo-Boer war had ended only thirty five years earlier and to some, siding with the \\"enemy\\" was considered disloyal and unpatriotic. These sentiments gave rise to \\"The Ossewabrandwag\\" (\\"Oxwagon Sentinel\\"), originally created as a cultural organisation on the Centenary of the Great Trek becoming more militant and openly opposing South African entry into the war on side of the British. The organisation created a paramilitary group called Stormjaers ('storm chasers'), modelled on the Nazi SA or Sturmabteilung (\\"Storm Division\\") and which was linked to the German Intelligence (Abwehr) and the German Foreign Office (Dienstelle Ribbentrop) via Dr. Luitpold Werz ‚Äì the former German Consul in Pretoria. The Stormjaers carried out a number of sabotage attacks against the Smuts government and actively tried to intimidate and discourage volunteers from joining the army recruitment programs. Korean War The names of those who died and are listed as missing can be found on the Memorial plaque in the gardens of the Union Buildings in Pretoria In the Korean War, the 2 Squadron (\\"The Flying Cheetahs\\") took part as South Africa's contribution. It won many American decorations, including the honour of a United States Presidential Unit Citation in 1952: :2 Sqn had a long and distinguished record of service in Korea flying F-51D Mustangs and later F-86F Sabres. Their role was mainly flying ground attack and interdiction missions as one of the squadrons making up the USAF's 18th Fighter Bomber Wing. :During the war the squadron flew a grand total of 12 067 sorties for a loss of 34 pilots and two other ranks. Aircraft losses amounted to 74 out of 97 Mustangs and four out of 22 Sabres. Pilots and men of the squadron received a total of 797 medals including 2 Silver Stars ‚Äì the highest award to non-American nationals ‚Äì 3 Legions of Merit, 55 Distinguished Flying Crosses and 40 Bronze Stars. 8 pilots became POW's. Casualties: 20 KIA 16 WIA. Some sources list 35 deaths from 2 Squadron. Simonstown Agreement The Simonstown Agreement was a naval co-operation agreement between the United Kingdom and South Africa signed 30 June 1955. Under the agreement, the Royal Navy gave up its naval base at Simonstown, South Africa, and transferred command of the South African Navy to the government of South Africa. In return, South Africa promised the use of the Simonstown base to Royal Navy ships. South Africa and Israel U.S. Intelligence believed that Israel participated in South African nuclear research projects and supplied advanced non-nuclear weapons technology to South Africa during the 1970s, while South Africa was developing its own atomic bombs.Von Wielligh, N. & von Wielligh-Steyn, L. (2015). The Bomb ‚Äì South Africa's Nuclear Weapons Programme. Pretoria: Litera. According to David Albright, writing for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, \\"Faced with sanctions, South Africa began to organize clandestine procurement networks in Europe and the United States, and it began a long, secret collaboration with Israel.\\" although he goes on to say \\"A common question is whether Israel provided South Africa with weapons design assistance, although available evidence argues against significant cooperation.\\" According to the Nuclear Threat Initiative, in 1977 Israel traded 30 grams of tritium in exchange for 50 tons of South African uranium and in the mid-80s assisted with the development of the RSA-3 ballistic missile. Also in 1977, according to foreign press reports, it was suspected that South Africa signed a pact with Israel that included the transfer of military technology and the manufacture of at least six atom bombs. Chris McGreal has claimed that \\"Israel provided expertise and technology that was central to South Africa's development of its nuclear bombs\\". In 2000, Dieter Gerhardt, Soviet spy and a former commodore in the South African Navy, claimed that Israel agreed in 1974 to arm eight Jericho II missiles with \\"special warheads\\" for South Africa. South African undercover activity abroad * On 4 October 1966, the Kingdom of Lesotho attained full independence, governed by a constitutional monarchy. In 1973, an appointed Interim National Assembly was established. With an overwhelming progovernment majority, it was largely the instrument of the BNP, led by Prime Minister Jonathan. South Africa had virtually closed the country's land borders because of Lesotho support of cross-border operations of the African National Congress (ANC). Moreover, South Africa publicly threatened to pursue more direct action against Lesotho if the Jonathan government did not root out the ANC presence in the country. This internal and external opposition to the government combined to produce violence and internal disorder in Lesotho that eventually led to a military takeover in 1986. * In 1981, the Seychelles experienced a failed coup attempt by Mike Hoare and a team of mercenaries. An international commission, appointed by the UN Security Council in 1982, concluded that South African defence agencies had been involved in the attempted takeover, including supplying weapons and ammunition. See History of Seychelles. * The South African army, and especially its air force, was actively involved in aiding the security forces in Rhodesia against Marxist insurgents led by the Patriotic Front. South Africa and weapons of mass destruction South African Border War South African Defence Force propaganda leaflet circulated during the Border War. Between 1966 and 1989, South Africa waged a long and bitter counter-insurgency campaign against the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) in South-West Africa.Andr√© Wessels, \\"The war for Southern Africa (1966‚Äì1989) that continues to fascinate and haunt us.\\" Historia 62.1 (2017): 73‚Äì91. online PLAN was backed by the Soviet Union and a number of Warsaw Pact member states, as well as several sympathetic, newly independent African governments. It also received considerable combat support from the People's Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) and a sizeable contingent of Cuban military advisors. In response, South Africa underwent a massive military expansion to combat the PLAN threat, which included the formation of several elite special forces units such as Koevoet, 32 Battalion, and the Reconnaissance Commando Regiment. South African troops raided neighbouring states to strike at PLAN forward operating bases, which occasionally entailed clashes with FAPLA and the Zambian Defence Force. This largely undeclared conflict became known as the South African Border War during the late 1970s. SADF expeditionary forces targeted guerrilla bases, refugees, and rural infrastructure in Angola and Zambia, depending initially on border raids, patrols, and air strikes to keep PLAN at bay. This was eventually extended to a permanent SADF military presence throughout southern Angola, with the objective of forcing PLAN bases to relocate further and further north. While this strategy was successful, it resulted in the parallel expansion of FAPLA, with Soviet assistance, to meet what Luanda perceived as a direct South African threat to Angolan sovereignty. FAPLA and the SADF clashed continuously between 1981 and 1984, and again from 1987 to 1988, culminating in the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale. The South African Border War was closely linked to the Angolan Civil War. South African expeditionary units had openly invaded Angola in 1975 during Operation Savannah, an ill-fated attempt to support two rival Angolan factions, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA), during the civil war. The SADF was forced to withdraw under overwhelming pressure from thousands of Cuban combat troops. When South Africa began intensifying its campaign against PLAN in the 1980s, it reasserted its alliance with UNITA and took the opportunity to bolster that movement with training and captured PLAN weaponry. The Battle of Cuito Cuanavale proved to be a major turning point for both conflicts, as it resulted in the Angolan Tripartite Accord, in which Cuba pledged to withdraw its troops from Angola while South Africa withdrew from South-West Africa. South-West Africa received independence as the Republic of Namibia in 1990. Production of military equipment by South Africa South Africa has produced a variety of significant weapons, vehicles and planes for its own uses as well as for international export. Some have been established weapons produced under licence and in other instances South Africa has innovated and manufactured its own weapons and vehicles. The predominant manufacturer of weapons is Denel. During the 1960s and 1970s, Armscor produced a great deal of South Africa's armament as South Africa was under UN sanctions. It was during this time that Armscor contracted with Gerald Bull's Space Research Corporation for advanced 155mm howitzer designs, which it eventually produced, used, and exported to countries such as Iraq. Internal guerrilla activity during apartheid Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, it was common for anti-apartheid political movements to form military wings, such as Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), which was created by the African National Congress, and the Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA) of the Pan-Africanist Congress. These functioned as de facto guerrilla armies, carrying out acts of sabotage and waging a limited rural insurgency. The guerrillas occasionally clashed with each other as their respective political organs jockeyed for internal influence. Though fought on a much smaller scale than the South African Border War, the SADF's operations against MK and APLA mirrored several important aspects of that conflict. Much like PLAN, for example, MK often sought sanctuary in states adjacent to South Africa's borders. The SADF retaliated with targeted assassinations of MK personnel on foreign soil, and a combination of air strikes and special forces raids on MK bases in Zambia, Mozambique, Botswana, and Lesotho. Both MK and APLA were disbanded and integrated with the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) following the abolition of apartheid. Modern Afrikaner separatist militias The Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) ‚Äì \\"Afrikaner Resistance Movement\\" ‚Äì was formed in 1973 in Heidelberg, Transvaal, a town southeast of Johannesburg. It is a political and paramilitary group in South Africa and was under the leadership of Eug√®ne Terre'Blanche. They are committed to the restoration of an independent Afrikaner republic or \\"Boerestaat\\" within South Africa. In their heyday, the period of transition in the early 1990s, they received much publicity both in South Africa and abroad as an extremist white supremacist group. During the Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa, the AWB stormed the venue, the Kempton Park World Trade Centre, breaking through the glass front of the building with an armoured car. The invaders took over the main conference hall, threatening delegates and painting slogans on the walls and left again after a short period. In 1994, before the advent of majority rule, the AWB again gained international notoriety in its attempt to defend the dictatorial government of Lucas Mangope in the homeland of Bophuthatswana, who opposed the upcoming elections and the dissolution of \\"his\\" homeland. The AWB, along with a contingent of about 90 Afrikaner Volksfront militiamen entered the capital of Mmabatho on 10 and 11 March. Terre'Blanche was sentenced for the attempted murder of security guard, Paul Motshabi, but he only served three years. In June 2004, he was released from prison. Terre'blanche claimed that while in prison, he re-discovered God and has dropped some of his more violent and racist policies. He preached reconciliation as 'prescribed by God' in his later years. Terre'Blanche was murdered on his farm on 3 April 2010. Present military: South African National Defence Force The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) is the name of the present-day armed forces of South Africa. The military as it exists today was created in 1994, following South Africa's first post- apartheid national elections and the adoption of a new constitution. It replaced the South African Defence Force (SADF), and included personnel and equipment from the SADF and the former Homelands forces (Transkei, Venda, Bophuthatswana, and Ciskei), as well as personnel from the former guerrilla forces of some of the political parties involved in South Africa, such as the African National Congress's Umkhonto we Sizwe, the Pan Africanist Congress's APLA and the Self-Protection Units of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). As of 2004, the integration process was considered complete, with the integrated personnel having been incorporated into a slightly modified structure very similar to that of the SADF, with the latter's structure and equipment for the most part being retained. The commander of the SANDF is appointed by the President from one of the armed services. The current commander is General Solly Shoke. He in turn is accountable to the Minister of Defence, currently Nosiviwe Noluthando Mapisa-Nqakula. Some of the Traditional South African Regiments have been serving the country for over a hundred and fifty years under various iterations of political systems and different governments. =Arms Deal= The South African Department of Defence's Strategic Defence Acquisition (known as the Arms Deal) aimed to modernise its defence equipment, which included the purchase of corvettes, submarines, light utility helicopters, lead-in fighter trainers and advanced light fighter aircraft. This saw the SANDF being provided with modern equipment. =Peacekeeping= Recent peacekeeping actions on the behalf of the South African military include the South African intervention in Lesotho in order to restore the democratically elected government after a coup, as well as extensive contributions to the United Nations peacekeeping operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi. An operation to Sudan has recently begun and is scheduled to be increased to Brigade strength. Issues that face the SANDF include a severe shortage of pilots and naval combat officers, due to the replacement of white officers from the former SADF with appointments from the old liberation forces and emigration. The loss of trained personnel and the decommissioning of much needed equipment due to funding issues, high HIV- rates amongst personnel and the fact that SANDF infantry soldiers are some of the oldest in the world, all raise questions regarding the current fighting efficiency of the SANDF. Some of these issues are being addressed with the introduction of the Military Skills Development (MSD) programme, as well as aggressive recruitment and training by the Reserve Force Regiments. Recently, the SANDF has been involved in combat in both the Central African Republic (Bangui) as well as in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FIB)). The performance of the SANDF soldiers in combat in these two theatres has gone a long way towards silencing critics of the combat effectiveness of the actual soldiers but has refocused the debate on that of the political leadership as well as the procurement and recruitment issues that still abound.

Plot Hitaka Kugaya, a former kendo champion who often has a weird recurring dream about a mysterious woman, seems to be the only one in his class who's not interested in Takemi Kanata; he meets her in the music room, while she's playing Beethoven's Tempest, and she warns him that a tempest is coming. While going back home from school, he's followed by a dog, and when he gives him something to eat it opens a huge mouth, revealing itself as a demon. At the very last moment, when his hand is already in the dog's mouth, in it appears a sword (the holy sword \\"Himuka\\"), which splits the beast in half; after that, Takemi appears, and gets rid of the body with a strange mirror (\\"mirror of containment\\"). Crying, she calls him Tohma, and reveals him that the beasts are \\"invaders from another world\\", and they're \\"guardians of the seal\\": the two worlds are separated by a seal, but the seal gets breached periodically, and the clan of the sword has the mission to stop the invasion. At first he doubts Takemi's words, as he doesn't remember anything, but when he comes back home he finds his aunt murdered by a crow demon, and he's badly injured; when he awakes in a hospital, there's already no way out for him. Characters ; : The main character, reincarnation of the hero Tohma; his parents died in a car accident, and his aunt Sakuri took care of him. Inside him there was a sword made of hihiirokane, a metal capable of concentrating souls to use them as a power source; the heavenly pillar, made of the same material, is the only seal keeping the spirits used for this to come back and get revenge. He loses his right arm to the sword, but the sword itself will regenerate his arm as soon as he learns how to use it properly. ; : The other main character, reincarnation of the mirror-bearer Tsukumi, Tohma's girlfriend who ended up being manipulated by the intruders and being killed by Tohma while their village was being destroyed. As a child she had a long fever, from which she recovered when the mirror appeared; thanks to the mirror she recovered immediately her memories, but since she was powerless without the sword she was scared of going outside, and locked herself in a shed all day. ; : Coach of the kendo team, she becomes Hitaka's legal guardian after his aunt's death. Involved somehow by Takemi, she's the one to cut Himuka's bonds saving Hitaka's life, and later discovers she belongs to the clan of the sword too. She develops a \\"connection\\" with Yukue Noume because they enjoy the thrill of battle. ;Asami Sakura : A young detective who initially investigates on the murder case in Hitaka's house, and suspects the two of them, but she witness a fight with an intruder and becomes their ally. After being removed from the case together with detective Togashi, she continues investigating and eventually receives an anonymous floppy disk containing all the truth behind the hihiirokane. ;Kiju Togashi : An experienced detective, he understands immediately the murder case at Hitaka's house isn't going to do any good to him. After being hurt and removed from the case by the agents of the guardianship post, he discreetly continues to help them. ; : The leader of the intruders; he's related to Hitaka since ancient times, and his hatred towards him is endless. Deluded by the fact that Hitaka still hasn't regained memory of his previous life, he repeatedly provokes him, until Himuka goes berserk and Hitaka loses his right arm. When Tsubasa reverses the power of the mirror to summon a powerful creature to fight him, Hitaka finally regains his memory and for the first time is able to injure him. ; : Tsubasa's right hand man; he seems to have greater powers than his, and he's very skilled with the sword.

This gives it a longer history of settlement than larger contemporary settlements in the region and country such as York and even London. During this time, it has experienced plague, several invasions, the loss of its railway, and its marginalisation to a backwater under the Romans. Nevertheless, Pocklington has prospered where other market towns have failed. It has always been the commercial and civic centre for the district and was at one point the second largest settlement in Yorkshire. It is the focal point of an area which has seen significant events through the centuries, many influencing English history. Pocklington gets its name via the Old English \\"Poclintun\\" from the Anglian settlement of Pocel's (or Pocela's) people and the Old English word \\"tun\\" meaning farm or settlement [A D Mills, The Popular Dictionary of English Place-Names], but though the town's name can only be traced back to around 650 AD, the inhabitation of Pocklington as a site is thought to extend back a further 1000 years or more to the Bronze Age. Historical timeline Pocklington in the last ice age =Bronze Age Pocklington= It is not known exactly when there was first a settlement at Pocklington ‚Äì archaeologists have found Iron Age remains in and around the town and many Bronze Age burials and other finds have been discovered in the neighbourhood. More recently in 2016 builders uncovered an earlier, Bronze Age, settlement, dating to around 800 BC. In 1937, wooden planks belonging to an ancient boat were discovered by a local man in nearby Ferriby. Originally estimated to date from 1300 BC, newer estimates using radiocarbon dating have placed the boats between the years 1890 BC to 1700 BC. Certainly the Wolds area as a whole was a very attractive location for settlements to ancient man, who preferred to stay clear of the poorly drained and often flooded neighbouring vales ‚Äì before the draining of a lot of land in the medieval era the flat land to the west and south of Pocklington was very marshy. Archaeologists have experienced problems in recovering early remains and artefacts from the area intact because of the damage and disruption caused by centuries of arable land use ‚Äì one skeleton discovered in 2005 was intact apart from its skull, which had been sheared off and crushed by a plough. =Iron Age Pocklington= Ptolemy relates that the Parisii, an ancient Briton tribe (with branches in France, and after which Paris itself is named) inhabited a large part of what is now the East Riding of Yorkshire in the late Iron Age (50 BC) [Ptolemy, Geography]. They were probably displaced to Britain by population movements on the continent. It is possible that Pocklington was settled by the Parisii as early as the 5th century BC, but certainly by the time the Parisii participated in the general rising of Vercingetorix against Julius Caesar in 52 BC there is strong evidence that their regional capital was based at Pocklington itself. In 2017, a Celtic warrior's grave, dated to about BC 320 to 174, was discovered at a housing development under construction in Pocklington at the Yorkshire Wolds. After archeologists had completed a very long excavation project, the site was found to include a bronze shield, remains of a chariot and the skeletons of ponies. The shield's boss bears a resemblance to the Wandsworth shield boss (circa BC 350 to 150), owned by the British Museum. One design element on the extremely-well preserved Pocklington shield, a scalloped border, \\"is not comparable to any other Iron Age finds across Europe, adding to its valuable uniqueness\\", said Paula Ware, managing director at MAP Archaeological Practice Ltd in late 2019. Horses were rarely included in Iron Age burials, making the find particularly significant. \\"The discoveries are set to widen our understanding of the Arras (Middle Iron Age) culture and the dating of artefacts to secure contexts is exceptional,\\" according to Paula Ware. =Romano-British Pocklington= It is during the era of the Roman occupation that Pocklington suffered something of a reversal in its development. It was eclipsed by York as the prominent settlement within the Yorkshire region, with the City of York effectively beginning its life during this era and swiftly eclipsing Pocklignton in size and importance. Despite Pocklington's existing status and size at the time, York was favoured as the site of the Roman city Eboracum in around 71 AD. It is thought to have been selected, whilst Pocklington was ignored, because of its better water access (River Ouse, accessible via Humber estuary) and because it was a naturally crossing point on a plain of routes from all directions. Despite Ermine Street (the primary Roman arterial road north from London) running close by Pocklington, the town was not garrisoned by Roman forces. A legionary barracks and important Roman town were constructed in York, which was for several years the home of the Roman Imperial Court and effectively the centre of administration for the Roman Empire, but Pocklington likely remained a Roman-influenced but little altered Iron Age settlement. There is archaeological evidence for some signs of Romanization (cultural) in Pocklington, including a Roman-style bath-house. The Roman name for Pocklington is not known but it is thought that Pocklington might be the presently unlocated Delgovicia, meaning \\"out of the way place\\" or, literally, backwater. However, Millington and Malton are competing candidates for this place-name also. By the time Ptolemy wrote his Geography in approximately 140 AD, he made no mention of Pocklington but instead referred to the capital of the Romano-British Parisi as being located in Petuaria, near modern-day Brough. Given that the Parisi themselves were non- literate and Ptolemy was writing at some remove, it is difficult now to know whether their capital shifted from Pocklington to Brough, or whether it was always at Pocklington, or always at Brough. Around this time, the Roman authorities raised an irregular auxiliary unit from the area, known as the Company of Newcomers [Collingwood & Wright, The Roman Inscriptions of Britain]. There is also evidence of a Roman villa just outside Pocklington, and although it is not known who occupied it, is suspected to have been a Romano-British chief. In 2004 diggers excavating the site near Pocklington unearthed fragments of a human skeleton which almost certainly dated back to Roman times. A quantity of Roman era pottery dating back to between 70 AD and 410 AD has also been uncovered scattered across the same field. It is known that at least as early as the 4th century large tracts of land in the Pocklington area and the Wolds were granted to Germanic \\"Foederati\\" ‚Äì continental warlords (possibly of the Alemanni) who were given areas of farmland in return for military service. It is not known to what extent this influx replaced or mingled with the earlier inhabitants. =Anglo-Saxon and Viking era= It was some time before 650 AD that Pocklington gained its current name, meaning \\"farmstead belonging to Pocela's people\\". It is not known what name Pocklington was known by before that date. It is reputed that the ancient kingdom of Deira has its capital nearby. It is likely that the missionary Paulinus established the first Christian church in Pocklington on his way from Goodmanham to found York Minster. Certainly, the Sotheby Cross, dating from the late 14th century in the churchyard at All Saints' Church, has the inscription \\"Paulinus here preached and celebrated AD627\\". The Great Heathen Army of the Vikings captured much of the area in 866, and, in 876, their remnants settled permanently in parts of the Yorkshire countryside. Viking kings ruled this area, known to historians as \\"The Viking Kingdom of Jorvik\\", for almost a century. In 954, the last Viking king, Eric Bloodaxe, was expelled and his kingdom was incorporated in the newly consolidated Anglo- Saxon state. =High Middle Ages in Pocklington= Many English towns are able to find mention of themselves in the Domesday Book, William the Conqueror's catalogue of the country. Even before the Norman Conquest, however, records of Pocklington are found in taxation census' of Anglo Saxon kings. Pocklington steadily evolved from Anglo Saxon times as the centre of the surrounding agricultural area. Before the Norman conquest, when King Harold's brother-in- law Earl Morcar was Lord of the Manor, it was a prosperous settlement. =Late Middle Ages ‚Äì medieval Pocklington= The Battle of Stamford Bridge was fought just 4 miles from Pocklington, and was the first of two major battles in that year for control of the country (the other being the Battle of Hastings. The former marked the end of Viking rule in England and the latter ushered in a period of Norman rule. After the Norman conquest the manor at Pocklington became a royal manor ‚Äì with the Percy family as the King's overlords ‚Äì and under this royal patronage, Pocklington continued to prosper. Pocklington was recorded in the Domesday Book as \\"Poclinton\\" and, given its current size, it is surprising to note that at the time of Domesday (1086) it is recorded as being the second largest settlement in Yorkshire after York itself, showing clearly that it had bounced back from its marginalisation in Roman Britain. Pocklington developed through the Middle Ages while many similar places fell into dramatic decline. Pocklington owed much of its prosperity in the Middle Ages to the fact it was a local centre for the trading of wool and that it lay on the main road to York, an important national centre for the export of wool to the Continent. Wool was England's principal export in the Middle Ages. A weekly market and regular fairs in the town were held by Royal Charter in 1245. Regular fairs continued until the early 1900s. The town's All Saints' Church is the only survivor from the Middle Ages. Known as the \\"Cathedral of the Wolds\\", it dates from the late 12th to early 15th centuries. Although containing some fragments of the earlier Norman church, its foundations go back further to the original Saxon era. The clerestory is 13th century and the tower is 15th. Parish records show that the Black Death (the bubonic plague) struck Pocklington hard in 1350, a year after its first outbreak in London and the south coast. Pocklington School was founded in 1514 as the Guild of the Parish Church by senior churchmen and politician John Dolman. His family became Lords of the Manor in the 14th century. In 1400 Pocklington was one of 30 East Riding of Yorkshire settlements which could be termed market towns. By 1750 there were just 10 and Pocklington was one. Over the next 150 years the town trebled in size with a host of new trades joining existing agricultural, brewing and milling interests. =Early Modern Period in Pocklington= Pocklington has one of the few Cromwellian charters in the country. The town charter was granted on 8 September 1656, one of the few during Oliver Cromwell's 11 years. Pocklington also lays claim to being the last place in England to hold a witch burning. In 1630 the parish register for that year records Old Wife Green burnt in Market for being a witch. In 1848 a cache of more than 500 coins from 1500 to 1700 was found on the edge of town. And 19 years later, the town's most notorious resident Isabella Bilington aged 32 was sentenced to death at York Assizes for crucifying her mother at Pocklington. After the killing she burnt a calf and a cock as a sacrifice. Her husband too was hanged as an accomplice. =Early Industrial Pocklington= William Wilberforce wrote his first public letter against the slave trade while at Pocklington School from 1771‚Äì76 and went on to be the driving force behind the abolition of slavery in the early 19th century. This is celebrated by the broken linked chain in the present town coat of arms. John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, was a frequent visitor to Pocklington in the late 18th century, and is among several notable churchmen, bishops and titular archbishops, born or educated in the town. A Wesleyan Methodist Church survives in use in Pocklington to this day. Entertainment also earned the town notoriety. The celebrated Flying Man of Pocklington, Thomas Pelling, attempted in 1733 to travel along a rope between the church and the Star Inn in the Market Square. He crashed to his death fracturing his skull against the wall of the church following a misunderstanding with men working the windlass. He is buried where he fell at the east end of the church where a plaque celebrates his memory. In 1759 a Pocklington brewer called Timothy Overland received a piece of land on the York to Beverley road on the southern fringe of Pocklington and built the Pocklington New Inn. By 1778, the establishment was a prosperous Coach House at the height of the coaching era. The building is still in the same use today as the Pocklington Motel. By this time the seat of the Lord of the Manor had transferred to Kilnwick Percy Hall. The present house was built in 1784 although there had been a hall there for many centuries. Unfortunately, a large section of it fell into disrepair and was pulled down during the 1940s. The remainder has (belatedly) been classed as a Grade II listed Georgian mansion. =19th century Pocklington= Steady further growth continued during the 19th century which saw much of the town completely rebuilt. In 1814, an act of parliament was passed for making a navigable canal from East Cottingwith to Street Bridge (about a mile from Pocklington). An early draft of this Parliamentary act was recently discovered in the attic of a Pocklington house. By 1818 the Pocklington Canal linked Pocklington to the River Derwent. It fell into disuse with the decline of Britain's canals but has been continuously resurrected by the Pocklington Canal Amenity Society since 1971 and the old mill house is now classed as a Grade II listed water mill of historic interest: most of the mill mechanism still exists. In 1821, the entire parish contained 2,163 inhabitants, of which 1,962 were of the township of Pocklington itself. In 1868, Pocklington's inhabitants are described as being \\"for the most part employed in agricultural pursuits, and in ropemaking, brickmaking, brewing, and malting. There are besides corn mills, iron foundries, and agricultural implement manufactories which materially contribute to the industrial wealth of the town.\\" In 1890, extensive repairs and alterations were made to All Saints' Church and, in a foreshadowing of modern interest in \\"time capsules\\", a message detailing the work was sealed in a glass bottle along with an 1890 newspaper and buried underneath the plith of the medieval Sotheby Cross. Unearthed accidentally during repairs in 2005, the sealed message and a copy of the 1890 newspaper were re-buried in the same spot, along with a contemporary copy of the Pocklington Post. =20th century Pocklington= The group of five airfields based in and around Pocklington played an active role in the Second World War. Pocklington Airfield was completed in April 1941. The first operational unit to occupy Pocklington was the Canadian No. 405 Squadron with Wellington aircraft, but in 1942 the RAF's 102 (Ceylon) Squadron took over the airfield, flying night sorties to bomb targets in France. They still hold an annual reunion in Pocklington. It was disbanded on 20 October 1954. During the Second World War a few houses in Pocklington were subject to bombing, after their street was mistaken for the airfield. Those serving on HMS Volage also keep close ties with the town that adopted them during the war, sending letters and parcels. The association with Pocklington continues with a new housing estate being named 'Volage Court' in recognition of the links with HMS Volage. Pocklington used to be served by a railway connection but this was closed in the Beeching Report era of the 1960s. Some existing lengths of trackway can be seen behind the old railway station (now used as the sports hall for Pocklington School). There has been some talk of bringing the railway line back to Pocklington but there has been substantial development along the original line after the land was sold off and the original route is no longer practical. There are serious doubts also as to the financial feasibility of re-opening the line. Pocklington experienced a rapid expansion in the final two decades of the 20th century, with large amounts of \\"green land\\" being ceded to new housing development to meet the demands of both lower housing occupancy rates (a trend common across the country) and also demand for commuter belt housing for the cities of York and Leeds. Throughout its long history, Pocklington has faced difficult times like recession, wartime and the closing of the railway, but each time the town has overcome and gone on to develop further.

History of the theory  This theory was suggested by future linguist Fu Sinian in his thesis 1933.Fu Sinian, \\"Yi Xia dong xi shuo\\" (Theory of the Yi in the East and the Xia in the West) in Zhongyangyuan qingzhu Cai Yuanpei xiansheng 65 sui lunwenji, Lishi yuyan yanjiusuo jikan waibian 1:1 (January 1933), 1093 - 1134Fu Sinian quanji (Complete Works of Fu Sinian), III, 822-893 It was further expanded by Liang Siyong who suggested that the newly discovered Yangshao culture was established by the Xia in the west and the Longshan culture by the Yi peoples of the east.Liang Siyong, \\"Xiaotun Longshan yu Yangshao\\" (Â∞èÂ±ØÈæçÂ±±Ëàá‰ª∞Èü∂) in Zhongyangyuan qingzhu Cai Yuanpei xiansheng 65 sui lunwenji, Lishi yuyan yanjiusuo jikan waibian (1933), 555- 567 For Chinese and Western historians this hypothesis became the prevailing theory to interpret Chinese prehistory and remained so until about 1960.Liu Yao, \\"Lomgshan wenhua yu Yangshao wenhua zhi fenxi\\" in Zhongguo kaogu xuebao, 2 (1947), pp. 251-282Andersson, J.G., \\"Researches into the Prehistory of the Chinese\\" in Bulletin of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, 15 (1943), pp. 29-91 Further archaeological discoveries made the theory obsolete. In 1950s it became clear that the Yinxu culture was preceded by the Erligang culture in Zhongyuan. In addition, the gap between the Erligang culture and the Longshan culture was joined by the Erlitou culture, which was named after the Erlitou site discovered in 1959. Chinese scholars identify the Erligang and Erlitou cultures as the sites of the Shang and Xia Dynasties respectively although the archaeological boundary between the two dynasties was still debatable. In 1983, the ruin of Yanshi Shang City was discovered and identified as the Erligang culture. The ruin very close to the Erlitou site suggests that the Erlitou and Erligang cultures were dominated by people with different cultural background. In Shandong, the Shandong Longshan culture was replaced by the Yueshi culture around 2000 B.C. The sites of the Yueshi culture show complementary distribution with those of the Erligang culture which expanded eastward from Zhongyuan. It proved that the Shang people did not originated in the east.  Implications  Though largely replaced and modified by later further research, Fu Sinian's theory entered the history as a landmark in Chinese historiography. It essentially questioned ethnic homogeneity sometimes postulated as the route of Chinese civilization. This contributed to the concept of the dialogical development of cultures.

Massie was recruited to the Carlton in the 1997 AFL Draft and won a Rising Star nomination in his first AFL season (1998) after debuting less than two weeks before his 18th birthday. As a utility player, Massie failed to live up to his top 10 draft pick status, however, and only managed 43 games in four seasons at Carlton before being traded.

Major Bowes is in the center. The Hoboken Four was a musical quartet formed in 1935, uniting a trio of Italian-American musicians who called themselves the 3 Flashes with aspiring singer Frank Sinatra. The trio had been based in Hoboken, New Jersey, before meeting Sinatra in 1934, after which Sinatra drove them and their instruments to gigs outside the city and occasionally performed with them. Following their winning performance on the Major Bowes Amateur Hour on September 8, 1935, the newly-formed quartet embarked on a seven-month tour of the central and western United States and Canada with one of Major Bowes' touring companies. Tensions between the quartet members escalated, however, to the point that Sinatra was regularly beaten by the other members, and he quit the tour halfway through. He returned to Hoboken to pursue a solo career, while the rest of the group disbanded after the tour ended.  History  The original trio was composed of three Italian Americans who were childhood friends on Sixth Street in Hoboken, New Jersey: James (Jimmy Skelly) Petrozelli, Patrick (Patty Prince) Principe, and Fred (Freddie Tamby) Tamburro. They worked as truck drivers and sang and danced as a group. They had a regular weekend set at the Rustic Cabin, a roadhouse located on U.S. Route 9W near Alpine, New Jersey, about from Hoboken. In 1934, the 19-year-old Frank Sinatra attached himself to the group, offering to drive them and their instruments to gigs outside Hoboken in his sports car. According to Tamburro: \\"Frank hung around us like we were gods or something. We took him along for one simple reason: Frankie-boy had a car. He used to chauffeur us around\\". Sinatra also acted as their unofficial manager, \\"renting the four of them to schools and club bands, with himself as the featured singer for a small additional fee\\". Sinatra had larger ambitions than being a manager or driver: he wanted to sing on stage, and performing with the 3 Flashes was the break he sought.  Expansion to a quartet  Edward Bowes, emcee of the Major Bowes Amateur Hour, in a March 1935 publicity photo In September 1935 the 3 Flashes decided to audition for the Major Bowes Amateur Hour, a radio show that encouraged listeners to vote for their favorite act either by calling the station or sending a postcard. The act that gained the most votes won the opportunity to go on a road tour with one of Major Bowes' touring companies. Sinatra also decided to audition as a solo singer. While the trio and the singer were accepted separately, Major Bowes felt it wouldn't do to promote two acts from the same town and put them together as a quartet which he renamed the Hoboken Four. According to another version of the story, it was Sinatra's mother, Dolly, who persuaded the trio to accept Sinatra as a permanent member. Appearing on the September 8, 1935 program, broadcast from the Capitol Theater in New York City, the quartet was introduced by Major Bowes as \\"singing and dancing fools\\". When asked to introduce themselves, each of the 3 Flashes cited their places of work, \\"when they were not out of work\\". When it was Sinatra's turn, Tamburro joked, \\"This feller here has never worked at all\\". Sinatra said, \\"I'm Frank. We're looking for a job. How about it? Everyone that's ever heard us, likes us. We think we're pretty good\\". The group sang \\"Shine\\" by the Mills Brothers, and Sinatra performed \\"Night and Day\\" by Cole Porter. The group won the contest hands down; it was claimed that over 40,000 calls were received, the biggest response in the program's history. The following month, the group appeared in two short films produced by Major Bowes, The Nightclub and The Big Minstrel Act. In the latter film, the singers wore blackface. The shorts aired at Radio City Music Hall. The Hoboken Four returned to compete several times on the Major Bowes Amateur Hour, calling themselves by different names each time, including the Seacaucus Cockamamies, the Bayonne Bacalas, the Jive Four, and the Jolly Jersey Gypsies of Song.Sinatra at the Sands, 1966, Reprise Records They won each contest. During his live performance at the Sands in 1966, Sinatra said that Major Bowes had to change the name to fool other contenders and the audience from realizing it was the same winning group competing against a fresh pack of amateurs. Sinatra often joked about the dozens of names his group was given and how Major Bowes kept rigging the show for them to win.  National tour  In the winter of 1935‚Äì1936 the Hoboken Four embarked on a seven-month bus and train tour of vaudeville theaters in the central and western United States and Canada with one of Major Bowes' touring companies. Each member received $50 per week, plus meals, which was more money than any of them had ever earned before. They performed 35 shows per week in 39 states. Songs that were added to their repertoire included \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" and \\"A Fine Romance\\". The grind of constant traveling and lodging in substandard accommodations generated tension among the quartet members. At one stop, Sinatra either started giggling on stage or cracked a joke about Tamburro on stage, and Tamburro decked him after the show. Sinatra's talent and self-confidence were evident to everyone in the touring company, as well as his ability to attract female fans, and Tamburro and Petrozelli began taking out their frustrations by beating up Sinatra from time to time. Before the end of 1935, Sinatra had had enough. He quit the tour and returned home to Hoboken. The original 3 Flashes continued with the tour as the Hoboken Trio, but soon decided to call it quits themselves. Petrozelli and Principe found jobs in Keansburg, New Jersey, while Tamburro went back to being a truck driver with an occasional singing gig.

Islanding can be dangerous to utility workers, who may not realize that a circuit is still powered, and it may prevent automatic re-connection of devices. Additionally, without strict frequency control the balance between load and generation in the islanded circuit is going to be violated, leading to abnormal frequencies and voltages. For those reasons, distributed generators must detect islanding and immediately disconnect from the circuit; this is referred to as anti-islanding. A common example of islanding is a distribution feeder that has solar panels attached to it. In the case of a power outage, the solar panels will continue to deliver power as long as irradiance is sufficient. In this case, the circuit detached by the outage becomes an \\"island\\". For this reason, solar inverters that are designed to supply power to the grid are generally required to have some sort of automatic anti-islanding circuitry. Some designs, commonly known as a microgrid, allow for intentional islanding. In case of an outage, a microgrid controller disconnects the local circuit from the grid on a dedicated switch and forces the distributed generator(s) to power the entire local load. In the context of nuclear power plants, islanding is an exceptional mode of operation of a nuclear reactor. In this mode, the power plant is disconnected from the grid and cooling systems (especially the pumps) are powered using only the power generated by the reactor itself. For some reactor types, islanding is part of the normal procedure when the power plant disconnects from the grid, in order to quickly recover electricity production. When islanding fails, emergency systems (such as diesel generators) take over. For instance, French nuclear power plants are conducting islanding tests every 4 years. The Chernobyl disaster was a failed islanding test. Islanding basics Electrical inverters are devices that convert direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC). Grid-interactive inverters have the additional requirement that they produce AC power that matches the existing power presented on the grid. In particular, a grid-interactive inverter must match the voltage, frequency and phase of the power line it connects to. There are numerous technical requirements to the accuracy of this tracking. Consider the case of a house with an array of solar panels on the roof. Inverter(s) attached to the panels convert the varying DC current provided by the panels into AC power that matches the grid supply. If the grid is disconnected, the voltage on the grid line might be expected to drop to zero, a clear indication of a service interruption. However, consider the case when the house's load exactly matches the output of the panels at the instant of the grid interruption. In this case the panels can continue supplying power, which is used up by the house's load. In this case there is no obvious indication that an interruption has occurred. Normally, even when the load and production are exactly matched, the so-called \\"balanced condition\\", the failure of the grid will result in several additional transient signals being generated. For instance, there will almost always be a brief decrease in line voltage, which will signal a potential fault condition. However, such events can also be caused by normal operation, like the starting of a large electric motor. Methods that detect islanding without a large number of false positives is the subject of considerable research. Each method has some threshold that needs to be crossed before a condition is considered to be a signal of grid interruption, which leads to a \\"non-detection zone\\" (NDZ), the range of conditions where a real grid failure will be filtered out.Bower & Ropp, pg. 10 For this reason, before field deployment, grid-interactive inverters are typically tested by reproducing at their output terminals specific grid conditions and evaluating the effectiveness of the islanding methods in detecting islanding conditions.  Questionable rationale  Given the activity in the field, and the large variety of methods that have been developed to detect islanding, it is important to consider whether or not the problem actually demands the amount of effort being expended. Generally speaking, the reasons for anti-islanding are given as (in no particular order):Bower & Ropp, pg. 13CANMET, pg. 3 # Safety concerns: if an island forms, repair crews may be faced with unexpected live wires # End-user equipment damage: customer equipment could theoretically be damaged if operating parameters differ greatly from the norm. In this case, the utility is liable for the damage. # Ending the failure: Reclosing the circuit onto an active island may cause problems with the utility's equipment, or cause automatic reclosing systems to fail to notice the problem. # Inverter confusion: Reclosing onto an active island may cause confusion among the inverters. The first issue has been widely dismissed by many in the power industry. Line workers are already constantly exposed to unexpectedly live wires in the course of normal events (i.e. is a house blacked out because it has no power, or because they pulled the main breaker inside?). Normal operating procedures under hot-line rules or dead-line rules require line workers to test for power as a matter of course, and it has been calculated that active islands would add a negligible risk.CANMET, pg. 9-10 However, other emergency workers may not have time to do a line check, and these issues have been extensively explored using risk-analysis tools. A UK-based study concluded that \\"The risk of electric shock associated with islanding of PV systems under worst-case PV penetration scenarios to both network operators and customers is typically <10‚àí9 per year.\\" The second possibility is also considered extremely remote. In addition to thresholds that are designed to operate quickly, islanding detection systems also have absolute thresholds that will trip long before conditions are reached that could cause end-user equipment damage. It is, generally, the last two issues that cause the most concern among utilities. Reclosers are commonly used to divide up the grid into smaller sections that will automatically, and quickly, re-energize the branch as soon as the fault condition (a tree branch on lines for instance) clears. There is some concern that the reclosers may not re-energize in the case of an island, or that the rapid cycling they cause might interfere with the ability of the DG system to match the grid again after the fault clears. If an islanding issue does exist, it appears to be limited to certain types of generators. A 2004 Canadian report concluded that synchronous generators, installations like microhydro, were the main concern. These systems may have considerable mechanical inertia that will provide a useful signal. For inverter based systems, the report largely dismissed the problem; \\"Anti- islanding technology for inverter based DG systems is much better developed, and published risk assessments suggest that the current technology and standards provide adequate protection while penetration of DG into the distribution system remains relatively low.\\"CANMET, pg. 45 The report also noted that \\"views on the importance of this issue tend to be very polarized,\\" with utilities generally considering the possibility of occurrence and its impacts, while those supporting DG systems generally use a risk based approach and the very low probabilities of an island forming.CANMET, pg. 1 An example of such an approach, one that strengthens the case that islanding is largely a non-issue, is a major real-world islanding experiment that was carried out in the Netherlands in 1999. Although based on then-current anti-islanding system, typically the most basic voltage jump detection methods, the testing clearly demonstrated that islands could not last longer than 60 seconds. Moreover, the theoretical predictions were true; the chance of a balance condition existing were on the order of 10‚àí6 a year, and that the chance that the grid would disconnect at that point in time was even less. As an island can only form when both conditions are true, they concluded that the \\"Probability of encountering an islanding is virtually zero\\"Verhoeven, pg. 46 Nevertheless, utility companies have continued to use islanding as a reason to delay or refuse the implementation of distributed generation systems. In Ontario, Hydro One recently introduced interconnection guidelines that refused connection if the total distributed generation capacity on a branch was 7% of the maximum yearly peak power.\\"Technical Interconnection Requirements for Distributed Generation\\" , Hydro One, 2010 At the same time, California sets a limit of 15% only for review, allowing connections up to 30%,\\"California Electric Rule 21 Supplemental Review Guideline\\" and is actively considering moving the review- only limit to 50%. The issue can be hotly political. In Ontario a number of potential customers taking advantage of a new Feed-in tariff program were refused connection only after building their systems. This was a problem particularly in rural areas where numerous farmers were able to set up small (10 kWp) systems under the \\"capacity exempt\\" microFIT program only to find that Hydro One had implemented a new capacity regulation after the fact, in many cases after the systems had been installed.Jonathan Sher, \\"Ontario Hydro pulls plug on solar plans\\", The London Free Press (via QMI), 14 February 2011 Islanding detection methods Detecting an islanding condition is the subject of considerable research. In general, these can be classified into passive methods, which look for transient events on the grid, and active methods, which probe the grid by sending signals of some sort from the inverter or the grid distribution point. There are also methods that the utility can use to detect the conditions that would cause the inverter-based methods to fail, and deliberately upset those conditions in order to make the inverters switch off. A Sandia Labs Report covers many of these methodologies, both in-use and future developments. These methods are summarized below. =Passive methods= Passive methods include any system that attempts to detect transient changes on the grid, and use that information as the basis as a probabilistic determination of whether or not the grid has failed, or some other condition has resulted in a temporary change. Under/over voltage According to Ohm's law, the voltage in an electrical circuit is a function of electric current (the supply of electrons) and the applied load (resistance). In the case of a grid interruption, the current being supplied by the local source is unlikely to match the load so perfectly as to be able to maintain a constant voltage. A system that periodically samples voltage and looks for sudden changes can be used to detect a fault condition.Bower & Ropp, pg. 17 Under/over voltage detection is normally trivial to implement in grid- interactive inverters, because the basic function of the inverter is to match the grid conditions, including voltage. That means that all grid-interactive inverters, by necessity, have the circuitry needed to detect the changes. All that is needed is an algorithm to detect sudden changes. However, sudden changes in voltage are a common occurrence on the grid as loads are attached and removed, so a threshold must be used to avoid false disconnections.Bower & Ropp, pg. 18 The range of conditions that result in non-detection with this method may be large, and these systems are generally used along with other detection systems.Bower & Ropp, pg. 19 Under/over frequency The frequency of the power being delivered to the grid is a function of the supply, one that the inverters carefully match. When the grid source is lost, the frequency of the power would fall to the natural resonant frequency of the circuits in the island. Looking for changes in this frequency, like voltage, is easy to implement using already required functionality, and for this reason almost all inverters also look for fault conditions using this method as well. Unlike changes in voltage, it is generally considered highly unlikely that a random circuit would naturally have a natural frequency the same as the grid power. However, many devices deliberately synchronize to the grid frequency, like televisions. Motors, in particular, may be able to provide a signal that is within the NDZ for some time as they \\"wind down\\". The combination of voltage and frequency shifts still results in a NDZ that is not considered adequate by all.Bower & Ropp, pg. 20 Rate of change of frequency In order to decrease the time in which an island is detected, rate of change of frequency has been adopted as a detection method. The rate of change of frequency is given by the following expression: \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}f}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = ROCOF = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta P f}{2GH} where f is the system frequency, t is the time, \\\\Delta P is the power imbalance (\\\\Delta P = P_m - P_e), G is the system capacity, and H is the system inertia. Should the rate of change of frequency, or ROCOF value, be greater than a certain value, the embedded generation will be disconnected from the network. Voltage phase jump detection Loads generally have power factors that are not perfect, meaning that they do not accept the voltage from the grid perfectly, but impede it slightly. Grid-tie inverters, by definition, have power factors of 1. This can lead to changes in phase when the grid fails, which can be used to detect islanding. Inverters generally track the phase of the grid signal using a phase locked loop (PLL) of some sort. The PLL stays in sync with the grid signal by tracking when the signal crosses zero volts. Between those events, the system is essentially \\"drawing\\" a sine-shaped output, varying the current output to the circuit to produce the proper voltage waveform. When the grid disconnects, the power factor suddenly changes from the grid's (1) to the load's (~1). As the circuit is still providing a current that would produce a smooth voltage output given the known loads, this condition will result in a sudden change in voltage. By the time the waveform is completed and returns to zero, the signal will be out of phase. The main advantage to this approach is that the shift in phase will occur even if the load exactly matches the supply in terms of Ohm's law - the NDZ is based on power factors of the island, which are very rarely 1. The downside is that many common events, like motors starting, also cause phase jumps as new impedances are added to the circuit. This forces the system to use relatively large thresholds, reducing its effectiveness.Bower & Ropp, pg. 21 Harmonics detection Even with noisy sources, like motors, the total harmonic distortion (THD) of a grid-connected circuit is generally unmeasurable due to the essentially infinite capacity of the grid that filters these events out. Inverters, on the other hand, generally have much larger distortions, as much as 5% THD. This is a function of their construction; some THD is a natural side-effect of the switched-mode power supply circuits most inverters are based on.Bower & Ropp, pg. 22 Thus, when the grid disconnects, the THD of the local circuit will naturally increase to that of the inverters themselves. This provides a very secure method of detecting islanding, because there are generally no other sources of THD that would match that of the inverter. Additionally, interactions within the inverters themselves, notably the transformers, have non-linear effects that produce unique 2nd and 3rd harmonics that are easily measurable. The drawback of this approach is that some loads may filter out the distortion, in the same way that the inverter attempts to. If this filtering effect is strong enough, it may reduce the THD below the threshold needed to trigger detection. Systems without a transformer on the \\"inside\\" of the disconnect point will make detection more difficult. However, the largest problem is that modern inverters attempt to lower the THD as much as possible, in some cases to unmeasurable limits. =Active methods= Active methods generally attempt to detect a grid failure by injecting small signals into the line, and then detecting whether or not the signal changes. Negative-sequence current injection This method is an active islanding detection method which can be used by three-phase electronically coupled distributed generation (DG) units. The method is based on injecting a negative-sequence current through the voltage-sourced converter (VSC) controller and detecting and quantifying the corresponding negative- sequence voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) of the VSC by means of a unified three-phase signal processor (UTSP). The UTSP system is an enhanced phase-locked loop (PLL) which provides a high degree of immunity to noise, and thus enables islanding detection based on injecting a small negative-sequence current. The negative-sequence current is injected by a negative-sequence controller which is adopted as the complementary of the conventional VSC current controller. The negative-sequence current injection method detects an islanding event within 60 ms (3.5 cycles) under UL1741 test conditions, requires 2% to 3% negative-sequence current injection for islanding detection, can correctly detect an islanding event for the grid short circuit ratio of 2 or higher, and is insensitive to variations of the load parameters of UL1741 test system. \\"Negative-Sequence Current Injection for Fast Islanding Detection of a Distributed Resource Unit\\", Houshang Karimi, Amirnaser Yazdani, and Reza Iravani, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 23, NO. 1, JANUARY 2008. Impedance measurement Impedance Measurement attempts to measure the overall impedance of the circuit being fed by the inverter. It does this by slightly \\"forcing\\" the current amplitude through the AC cycle, presenting too much current at a given time. Normally this would have no effect on the measured voltage, as the grid is an effectively infinitely stiff voltage source. In the event of a disconnection, even the small forcing would result in a noticeable change in voltage, allowing detection of the island.Bower & Ropp, pg. 24 The main advantage of this method is that it has a vanishingly small NDZ for any given single inverter. However, the inverse is also the main weakness of this method; in the case of multiple inverters, each one would be forcing a slightly different signal into the line, hiding the effects on any one inverter. It is possible to address this problem by communication between the inverters to ensure they all force on the same schedule, but in a non- homogeneous install (multiple installations on a single branch) this becomes difficult or impossible in practice. Additionally, the method only works if the grid is effectively infinite, and in practice many real-world grid connections do not sufficiently meet this criterion. Impedance measurement at a specific frequency Although the methodology is similar to Impedance Measurement, this method, also known as \\"harmonic amplitude jump\\", is actually closer to Harmonics Detection. In this case, the inverter deliberately introduces harmonics at a given frequency, and as in the case of Impedance Measurement, expects the signal from the grid to overwhelm it until the grid fails. Like Harmonics Detection, the signal may be filtered out by real-world circuits.Bower & Ropp, pg. 26 Slip mode frequency shift This is one of the newest methods of islanding detection, and in theory, one of the best. It is based on forcing the phase of the inverter's output to be slightly mis- aligned with the grid, with the expectation that the grid will overwhelm this signal. The system relies on the actions of a finely tuned phase-locked loop to become unstable when the grid signal is missing; in this case, the PLL attempts to adjust the signal back to itself, which is tuned to continue to drift. In the case of grid failure, the system will quickly drift away from the design frequency, eventually causing the inverter to shut down.Bower & Ropp, pg. 28 The major advantage of this approach is that it can be implemented using circuitry that is already present in the inverter. The main disadvantage is that it requires the inverter to always be slightly out of time with the grid, a lowered power factor. Generally speaking, the system has a vanishingly small NDZ and will quickly disconnect, but it is known that there are some loads that will react to offset the detection. Frequency bias Frequency bias forces a slightly off-frequency signal into the grid, but \\"fixes\\" this at the end of every cycle by jumping back into phase when the voltage passes zero. This creates a signal similar to Slip Mode, but the power factor remains closer to that of the grid's, and resets itself every cycle. Moreover, the signal is less likely to be filtered out by known loads. The main disadvantage is that every inverter would have to agree to shift the signal back to zero at the same point on the cycle, say as the voltage crosses back to zero, otherwise different inverters will force the signal in different directions and filter it out.Bower & Ropp, pg. 29 There are numerous possible variations to this basic scheme. The Frequency Jump version, also known as the \\"zebra method\\", inserts forcing only on a specific number of cycles in a set pattern. This dramatically reduces the chance that external circuits may filter the signal out. This advantage disappears with multiple inverters, unless some way of synchronizing the patterns is used.Bower & Ropp, pg. 34 =Utility-based methods= The utility also has a variety of methods available to it to force systems offline in the event of a failure. Manual disconnection Most small generator connections require a mechanical disconnect switch, so at a minimum the utility could send a repairman to pull them all. For very large sources, one might simply install a dedicated telephone hotline that can be used to have an operator manually shut down the generator. In either case, the reaction time is likely to be on the order of minutes, or hours. Automated disconnection Manual disconnection could be automated through the use of signals sent through the grid, or on secondary means. For instance, power line carrier communications could be installed in all inverters, periodically checking for signals from the utility and disconnecting either on command, or if the signal disappears for a fixed time. Such a system would be highly reliable, but expensive to implement.Bower & Ropp, pg. 40CANMET, pg. 13-14 Transfer-trip method As the utility can be reasonably assured that they will always have a method for discovering a fault, whether that be automated or simply looking at the recloser, it is possible for the utility to use this information and transmit it down the line. This can be used to force the tripping of properly equipped DG systems by deliberately opening a series of recloser in the grid to force the DG system to be isolated in a way that forces it out of the NDZ. This method can be guaranteed to work, but requires the grid to be equipped with automated recloser systems, and external communications systems that guarantee the signal will make it through to the reclosers.CANMET, pg. 12-13 Impedance insertion A related concept is to deliberately force a section of the grid into a condition that will guarantee the DG systems will disconnect. This is similar to the transfer-trip method, but uses active systems at the head-end of the utility, as opposed to relying on the topology of the network. A simple example is a large bank of capacitors that are added to a branch, left charged up and normally disconnected by a switch. In the event of a failure, the capacitors are switched into the branch by the utility after a short delay. This can be easily accomplished through automatic means at the point of distribution. The capacitors can only supply current for a brief period, ensuring that the start or end of the pulse they deliver will cause enough of a change to trip the inverters.Bower & Ropp, pg. 37 There appears to be no NDZ for this method of anti-islanding. Its main disadvantage is cost; the capacitor bank has to be large enough to cause changes in voltage that will be detected, and this is a function of the amount of load on the branch. In theory, very large banks would be needed, an expense the utility is unlikely to look on favourably.Bower & Ropp, pg. 38 SCADA Anti-islanding protection can be improved through the use of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems already widely used in the utility market. For instance, an alarm could sound if the SCADA system detects voltage on a line where a failure is known to be in progress. This does not affect the anti- islanding systems, but may allow any of the systems noted above to be quickly implemented.

In 1931 he founded the world's first research center and museum for dance in Paris. Biography Rolf de Mar√© was born in Stockholm in 1888 as the son of diplomat Henrik de Mar√© and sculptor Ellen Roosval von Hallwyl. In 1912 he made friends with post-impressionist painter Nils von Dardel who was not particularly well off, but imaginative and talented, while de Mar√© was enthusiastic and had money. In 1918, through Dardel, de Mar√© met Jean B√∂rlin and de Mar√© became lover and protector of the Swedish dancer. De Mar√© created in 1920 the Ballets Su√©dois at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris of which B√∂rlin was first dancer and choreographer. In the autumn of 1924 Giorgio de Chirico curated the scenography and costumes for Pirandello's La Giara. B√∂rlin died in 1930 and in 1931, de Mar√© founded Les Archives internationales de la Danse (AID) in Paris in his memory, the world's first museum and research institute for dance. The Archive became a famous centre for studies in dance and visitors came from all over the world to see exhibitions or to study in its vast library. The dance center also published its own magazine and books, arranged lecture demonstrations in the building which de Mar√© had constructed for his dance centre. After the World War the archives had grown too large for a private person to maintain, de Mar√© closed his business in Paris and donated parts of the collections -- some 6,000 books, engravings and other items, all concerned mainly with Western dance -- to the French government which placed them at the museum and library of the Paris Opera. However, the museum declined to accept two substantial elements of de Mar√©'s collection: firstly, material from the Ballets Su√©dois, and secondly, the fruits of his expedition of exploration to Indonesia in 1936 -- the first to have been undertaken with the purpose of documenting dance. Therefore, the collection from the Swedish Ballet in Paris and the non-European collections were brought by de Mar√© to Stockholm to form the Dance Museum, which he opened in 1953 in the basement of the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm. On his death he made the Dance Museum the sole heir to his fortune, and this enabled the museum to make further acquisitions. After dissolving the Ballets Suedois in 1925, de Mar√© made no attempt to revive its works. The various, concrete collectibles de Mar√© amassed and that exist today as the bedrock of Stockholm's Dance Museum, illuminate our picture of him as archivist and art collector, all the while they question his role as a connoisseur of a theater based on the art of dancing. Throughout his life, Rolf de Mar√© was also a distinguished art collector. In the early 1960s, he made an important donation of modernist art to the Moderna Museet. Rolf de Mar√© died of a stroke in Barcelona in 1964.

It was directed by George More O'Ferrall for London Films. It was entered into the 1953 Cannes Film Festival. Cast and production Trevor Howard plays Scobie, a senior policeman in British Sierra Leone. He is unhappily married to Louise, played by Elizabeth Allan. While she is away, he begins a love affair with Helen, played by Maria Schell. However, Scobie's Catholic faith leaves him tormented with guilt. The film also features Denholm Elliott, Peter Finch, G√©rard Oury, George Coulouris and Michael Hordern. It contains no original score, but instead features indigenous music from Sierra Leone in West Africa, where location filming took place. The interiors were filmed at Shepperton Studios in London. The black and white cinematography was by Jack Hildyard. Plot Scobie, Deputy Commissioner of the Sierra Leone Police in Freetown during the Second World War, is unhappily married to fellow-Catholic Louise: both mourn the death of their only daughter. Despite his having been a police officer in the country for 15 years, when the Police Commissioner announces he is to retire, Scobie is overlooked in favour of a younger man sent out from the UK. On a search of a neutral Portuguese ship, the Esperan√ßa, he finds an envelope addressed to Germany. When he confiscates it, the captain begs him to do nothing because the letter is to his daughter. Feeling pity, Scobie burns it. His wife does not like the climate or the other expatriates and keeps begging him to let her go to South Africa by sea but they cannot afford the fare. Eventually he accepts a loan from Yusef, a suspected smuggler. Called up country because a local District Commissioner is in trouble, he finds the man has committed suicide because of his debts. While he is there, survivors of a ship torpedoed by the Germans are brought ashore by the Vichy police of neighbouring French Guinea. One is Helen, a young widow who reminds him of his dead daughter. Back in Freetown, he finds she has been given a hut near his house and, after he pays her a visit, they commence an affair. After an argument, he writes her a love letter but it is intercepted by a servant in Yusef's pay. He learns that Louise is returning and Yusef tells him that he must give a packet of contraband diamonds to the captain of the Esperan√ßa or he will give his wife his letter to Helen. He complies. However, someone tells Louise about the affair. Scobie is in torment between his love for Helen and his responsibilities to his wife, his wartime role and particularly his religious faith. He contemplates suicide but is then killed trying to stop a brawl. Differences between film and book The main difference between the film and the book is in the ending, which is almost equally bleak, but reversed from Greene's original story. In the book, Scobie's servant is killed (apparently an act of revenge by Yusef, here played by G√©rard Oury). Scobie commits suicide. In the film, Scobie intends to kill himself, but is interrupted by a fight breaking out. He intervenes and is shot. The servant (Earl Cameron) does not die, but instead Scobie dies in his servant's arms.

History European settlement began in the Tintaldra in 1837 with the arrival of squatters looking for fresh grass and water for cattle. The town began to form around 1854 as unlucky prospectors began to look for land to farm, though of insufficient size to justify a Post Office until 1 January 1867. Its location as a crossing point over the Murray River and its associated customs house led to a boom period in the late 19th century. Federation and the development of other river crossings into New South Wales led to a slow decline. Soldier settlers moved to the area after World War I.

Brown (born November 28, 1955) is an American political theorist. She is Class of 1936 First Professor of Political Science and a core faculty member in The Program for Critical Theory at the University of California, Berkeley. Career Brown received her BA in both Economics and Politics from UC Santa Cruz, and her M.A and Ph.D in political philosophy from Princeton University. Before she took a position at UC Berkeley in 1999, Brown taught at Williams College and UC Santa Cruz. At Berkeley, beyond her primary teaching roles in Political Theory and Critical Theory, Brown is also an affiliated faculty member of the Department of Rhetoric, the Jurisprudence and Social Policy Program, the Designated Emphasis in Women, Gender and Sexuality, and the Designated Emphasis in Early Modern Studies. Brown lectures around the world and has held numerous visiting and honorary positions, including at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna, the Goethe University in Frankfurt, the UC Humanities Research Institute in Irvine, the Institute for the Humanities Critical Theory Summer School at Birkbeck, University of London (2012, 2015), a Senior Invited Fellow of the Center for Humanities at Cornell University (2013), a Visiting Professor at Columbia University (2014), a Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Lecturer (2014), a Visiting Professor of Law and Government at Cornell University (2015), the Shimizu Visiting Professor of Law at the London School of Economics (2015), and a Visiting Professor at the European Graduate School (2016).

Brown's work has been translated into more than twenty languages and has received many awards. Brown served as Council Member of the American Political Science Association (2007‚Äì09) and as Chair of the UC Humanities Research Institute Board of Governors (2009‚Äì11). In 2012, her book Walled States, Waning Sovereignty won the David Eastman Award. In 2017, her book Undoing the Demos won the Spitz Prize for the best book in liberal and/or democratic theory. Brown received the 2016 Distinguished Teaching Award, UC Berkeley's most prestigious honor for teaching. She received a UC Presidents Humanities Research Fellowship (2017‚Äì18) and was a Guggenheim Fellow (2017‚Äì18). Brown's thinking on the decline of sovereignty and the hollowing out of democracy has found popular and journalistic audiences, with discussions of her work appearing in The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Guardian. Brown has appeared in documentary films including \\"The Value of the Humanities\\" (2014) and \\"What is Democracy?\\" (directed by Astra Taylor, 2019). Together with Michel Feher, Brown is co-editor of the Zone Books' series Near Futures and its digital supplement Near Futures Online. Overview of work Brown has established new paradigms in critical legal studies and feminist theory.Wendy Brown, Christina Colegate, John Dalton, Timothy Rayner, Cate Thill, Learning to Love Again: An Interview with Wendy Brown, Contretemps 6, January 2006: 25-42 She has produced a body of work drawing from Karl Marx's critique of capitalism and its relation to religion and secularism, Friedrich Nietzsche's usefulness for thinking about power and the ruses of morality, Max Weber on the modern organization of power, psychoanalysis and its implications for political identification, Michel Foucault's work on governmentality and neoliberalism, as well as other contemporary continental philosophers. Bringing these resources together with her own thinking on a range of topics, Brown's work aims to diagnose modern and contemporary formations of political power, and to discern the threats to democracy entailed by such formations. =States of Injury: Power and Freedom in Late Modernity (1995)= In this work Brown asks how a sense of woundedness can become the basis for individual and collective forms of identity. From outlawing hate speech to banning pornography, Brown argues, well-intentioned attempts at protection can legitimize the state while harming subjects by codifying their identities as helpless or in need of continuous governmental regulation. While breaking ground in political theory, this work also represents one of Brown's key interventions in feminist and queer theory. The book offers a novel account of legal and political power as constitutive of norms of sexuality and gender. Through the concept of \\"wounded attachments\\", Brown contends that psychic injury may accompany and sustain racial, ethnic, and gender categories, particularly in relation to state law and discursive formations. In this and other works Brown has criticized representatives of second wave feminism, such as Catharine MacKinnon, for reinscribing the category of \\"woman\\" as an essentialized identity premised on injury. Prior to States of Injury, Brown addressed Toward a Feminist Theory of the State (1989) in The Nation, characterizing it as a \\"profoundly static world view and undemocratic, perhaps even anti-democratic, political sensibility\\" as well as \\"flatly dated\\" and \\"developed at 'the dawn of feminism's second wave ... framed by a political- intellectual context that no longer exists -- a male Marxist monopoly on radical social discourse'\\". See Wendy Brown, \\"Consciousness Razing\\", The Nation, January 8/15, 1990, pp. 61‚Äì64. for reinscribing the category of \\"woman\\" as an essentialized identity premised on injury. = Politics Out of History (2001) = This book comprises a series of essays on contemporary political issues from the problem of moralism in politics to the legacies of past injustices in the present. Throughout her thematically overlapping chapters, Brown asks: \\"What happens to left and liberal political orientations when faith in progress is broken, when both the sovereign individual and sovereign states seem tenuous, when desire seems as likely to seek punishment as freedom, when all political conviction is revealed as contingent and subjective?\\" Much of this book takes history and liberalism themselves as objects of theoretical reflection and sites of contestation. Drawing on a range of thinkers, such as Freud, Marx, Nietzsche, Spinoza, Benjamin and Derrida, Brown rethinks the disorientation and possibility inherent to contemporary democracy. =Edgework: Critical Essays on Knowledge and Politics (2005)= This work consists of seven articles responding to particular occasions, each of which \\"mimic, in certain ways, the experience of the political realm: one is challenged to think here, now, about a problem that is set and framed by someone else, and to do so before a particular audience or in dialogue with others not of one's own choosing.\\" Each individual essay begins with a specific problem: what is the relationship between love, loyalty, and dissent in contemporary American political life?; how did neoliberal rationality become a form of governmentality?; what are the main problems of women's studies programs?; and so on. According to Brown, the essays do not aim to definitively answer the given questions but \\"to critically interrogate the framing and naming practices, challenge the dogmas (including those of the Left and of feminism), and discern the constitutive powers shaping the problem at hand.\\" =Regulating Aversion: Tolerance in the Age of Identity and Empire (2006)= In this book, Brown subverts the usual and widely accepted notion that tolerance is one of the most remarkable achievements of Western modernity. She suggests that tolerance (or toleration) cannot be perceived as the complete opposite to violence. At times, it can also be used to justify violence. Brown argues that tolerance primarily operates as a discourse of subject construction and a mode of governmentality that addresses or confirms asymmetric relations between different groups, each of which must then \\"tolerate\\" other groups and categories or \\"be tolerated\\" by the dominant groups and categories. To substantiate her thesis, Brown examines the tolerance discourse of figures like George W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, Samuel Huntington, Susan Okin, Michael Ignatieff, Bernard Lewis, and Seyla Benhabib and argues that \\"tolerance as a political practice is always conferred by the dominant, it is always a certain expression of domination even as it offers protection or incorporation to the less powerful.\\" Among those influenced by Brown's thinking on this subject are Joan Wallach Scott and Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek, whose respective works The Politics of the Veil (2007) and Violence: Six Sideways Reflections (2007) draw heavily on Brown's account of tolerance discourse. In a debate with Rainer Forst at the ICI in Berlin Brown addressed this problematic again,The power of tolerance ‚Äì Debate between Wendy Brown and Rainer Forst, ICI Berlin, 2008] (July 16, 2015). later published as a co- authored book, The Power of Tolerance (2014). Here Brown argues against primarily moral or normative approaches to power and discourse, and warns against the dangers of uncritically celebrating the liberal ideal of tolerance, as frequently happens in Western notions of historical, civilizational or moral progress.The Power of Tolerance: A Debate, Columbia.edu (July 16, 2015). =Les Habits neufs de la politique mondiale (2007)= Published exclusively in French, Les habits neufs de la politique mondiale (The New Clothes of World Politics) argues that the following political fact is irreversible: liberal democracy, as a global social and historical modality of statecraft, is dying. The two movements delivering such blows, neoliberalism and neoconservatism, feature both resonances and dissonances. Brown argues that whilst the former acts as a political rationality, a mode of general regulation of behavior, the latter is both necessary to its survival, and parasitic of its survival. As a form of governmentality that redefines freedom, neoliberalism will moralize politics, limiting its scope; this is the function of neo-conservatism. =Walled States, Waning Sovereignty (2010)= This book examines the revival of wall- building under shifting conditions of global capitalism. Brown not only problematizes the assumed functions of walls, such as the prevention of crime, migration, smuggling, and so on. She also argues that walling has taken on new a significance due to its symbolic function in an increasingly globalized and precarious world of financial capital. As individual identity as well as nation-state sovereignty are threatened, walls become objects invested with individual and collective desire. Anxious efforts to shore up national identity are thus projected onto borders as well as new material structures that would appear to secure them. See also, Timothy Shenk, \\"Booked #3: What Exactly Is Neoliberalism?\\" Dissent Magazine The book was reprinted with a new preface by the author following the 2016 election of Donald Trump. =Undoing the Demos: Neoliberalism's Stealth Revolution (2015)= Brown's study begins by engaging and revising key arguments in Foucault's The Birth of Biopolitics with the aim of analyzing different ways that democracy is being hollowed out by neoliberal rationality. She describes neoliberalism as a thoroughgoing attack on the most foundational ideas and practices of democracy. The individual chapters of the book examine the effects of neoliberalization on higher education, law, governance, the basic principles of liberal democratic institutions, as well as radical democratic imaginaries. Brown treats \\"neoliberalism as a governing rationality through which everything is 'economized' and in a very specific way: human beings become market actors and nothing but, every field of activity is seen as a market, and every entity (whether public or private, whether person, business, or state) is governed as a firm.\\" To address such threats, Brown argues, democracy must be reinvigorated not only as an object of theoretical inquiry but also as a site of political struggle. = In the Ruins of Neoliberalism: The Rise of Anti- Democratic Politics in the West (2019) = Brown's latest book, published in 2019 by Columbia University Press, analyses the hard-right turn in Western politics. While this turn is animated by socioeconomically aggrieved white working- and middle-class populations, Brown argues that it is also contoured by the multipronged assault on democratic values taking place under neoliberalism. In the Ruins of Neoliberalism traces the ambition to replace democratic orders with ones disciplined by markets and traditional morality and democratic states with technocratic ones. Brown also explores the unintentional outcomes of neoliberal reason, from its attack on the value of society and its fetish of individual freedom to its legitimation of inequality, to understand how it generates an apocalyptic populism willing to destroy the world rather than endure a future in which white male supremacy disappears.  Public life  Wendy Brown giving the Democracy Lecture at the HKW Berlin in 2017. Photo by Santiago Engelhardt. A prominent public intellectual in the United States, Brown has written and spoken about issues of free speech, public education, political protest, LGBTQ issues, sexual assault, Donald Trump, conservatism, neoliberalism, and other matters of national and international concern. For decades, Brown has been active in efforts to resist measures toward the privatization of the University of California system. In her capacity as co-chair of the Berkeley Faculty Association, she raised awareness, organized marches, and spoke publicly about the privatization of public education. She has been critical of the university's decision to cut costs by utilizing lecturers rather than hiring tenure and tenure track professors. Relatedly, she has voiced concern over the perils of the UC's proposed online education programs.For Brown's article on this topic, published in a \\"Qui Parle\\" special issue, see Brown has criticized university administration for their response to sexual assault. \\"I think many faculty feel there are repeat harassers on our faculty who are never charged ... Graduate students gave up on careers, and these perpetrators were allowed to continue, and that was wrong‚Äînever should have happened,\\" she said. At the \\"99 Mile March\\" to Sacramento she addressed her criticism to more general trends: \\"We are marching to draw attention to the plight of public education in California and to implore Californians to re-invest in it. For all its resources, innovation and wealth, California has sunk to nearly the bottom of the nation in per student spending, and our public higher education system, once the envy of the world, is in real peril.\\" Brown supported Occupy Wall Street as part of the UC faculty council, claiming that \\"We understand this to be part of what (the movement) stands for. We are delighted by the protests and consider our campaign to be at one with it.\\" Personal life Brown is a native of California and lives in Berkeley with her partner Judith Butler and son, Isaac.

The Hull and South Yorkshire Extension Railway was incorporated on 6 August 1897 and on 25 July 1898 was transferred to the Hull and Barnsley Railway. The bill was deposited by a group of local coal owners representing the Manvers Main Colliery Company, Hickleton Main Colliery, Wath Main Colliery, Wharncliffe Silkstone Colliery together with representatives of the Hull and Barnsley Railway. Description The main line left that of the Hull and Barnsley at Wrangbrook Junction, which then became a three-way affair with the South Yorkshire Junction Railway as well as the H&B.; It ran via Hickleton and Thurnscoe to Wath where it made an east facing junction with the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway and a spur to reach Manvers Main Colliery. The line was over in length, with steep gradients - being between 1 in 120 to 150 uphill for the first six miles after Wrangbrook junction, then around 1 in 110 to 1 in 115 downhill to Wath-upon-Dearne. The line had problems with subsidence, as well as flooding at the point it passed under the Midland railway. The line was transferred to the H&B; on 25 July 1898 and then in June the following year, they doubled the line between Wrangbrook Junction and Hickleton as well as spurs to serve the collieries at Hickleton, Manvers and Wath. The line was opened for goods on 31 March 1902 and for passengers on 28 August the same year with intermediate stations at Moorhouse and South Elmsall and Hickleton and Thurnscoe. Passenger traffic, which ran to Kirk Smeaton on the H&B;, ended on 6 April 1929, goods traffic between Wath and Hickleton ended on 2 October 1933, between Hickleton and Moorhouse on 31 May 1954 and on the remainder of the line on 1 October 1963. Certain lines around the southern terminus at Wath remained for use by the National Coal Board. These were closed with the Wath Main / Manvers Main complex in the 1980s.

In 2011 Smyth wrote a two-man show entitled The Brother which he adapted from the work of Flann O'Brien. He performed the play (with actor David Llewellyn, directed by Andrew Sherlock) at an international Flann O'Brien conference in Vienna in July 2011, and at another international conference in Trieste in May 2012. The Brother had a six-night run at the Edinburgh Free Fringe Festival in August 2012, and has subsequently been performed at the Eleanor Rathbone Theatre (the University of Liverpool), as part of the 2012 May Festival at the University of Aberdeen, and at the IASIL (International Association for the Study of Irish Literature) Conference in Lille in June 2014. Smyth wrote a companion piece entitled Will the Real Flann O'Brien ...? A Life in Five Scenes which he performed (in a double header with The Brother) at the 2013 Liverpool Irish Festival, and at the Third Flann O'Brien Conference in Prague in July 2015. The Liverpool Irish Literary Theatre travelled to the O'Brien conference Salzburg in July 2017 to perform a trio of short plays, including two by Flann O'Brien - Thirst and The Dead Spit of Kelly - as well as The Golden Gate by Lord Dunsany. The company also performed at the Flann O'Brien Conference in Dublin in July 2019. LILT is currently developing a piece entitled A Drink with Brendan Behan, based on the life (and death) of that famous Irish writer. In August 2017 Smyth's play Nora & Jim - based on an episode in the lives of James Joyce and Nora Barnacle - ran for six nights at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

In 2012 Smyth recorded and released an album entitled James Joyce's Chamber Music: this was a folk musical version (co-written and performed with his daughter Esther) of the thirty-six lyric suite published by James Joyce in 1907. The album was launched at a concert in the Bluecoat Arts Centre in Liverpool in October 2012 as part of the Liverpool Irish Festival. In 2013 and 2014 Smyth performed concerts of selected material from this album at concerts in Nijmegen, Brussels, Kortrijk, Paris, Rennes, Reykjavik, Trieste, Kristiansand, Gothenburg, Sassari, and Florence. A website based on the album was launched at an event in the Everyman Theatre in Liverpool on 22 January 2015.http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/jamesjoyceschambermusic/ Material from the album has been performed at Joyce events in Istanbul and San Francisco. In July 2019 Smyth released Words for Music, Perhaps: Fifteen Songs Adapted from the Poetry of W.B. Yeats. Once again featuring Esther Smyth on vocals, the album included settings of Yeats' poems such as 'Brown Penny', 'September 1913' and 'Come Gather Round Me, Parnellites' as well as new versions of 'The Fiddler of Dooney' and 'Down by the Salley Gardens'.

The four main models to explain psychological abnormality are the biological, behavioural, cognitive, and psychodynamic models. They all attempt to explain the causes and treatments for all psychological illnesses, and all from a different approach. Biological (medical) model The biological model of abnormality (the only model not based on psychological principles) is based on the assumptions that if the brain, neuroanatomy and related biochemicals are all physical entities and work together to mediate psychological processes, then treating any mental abnormality must be physical/biological. Part of this theory stems from much research into the major neurotransmitter, serotonin, which seems to show that major psychological illnesses such as bipolar disorder and anorexia nervosa are caused by abnormally reduced levels of Serotonin in the brain.(1) The model also suggests that psychological illness could and should be treated like any physical illness (being caused by chemical imbalance, microbes or physical stress) and hence can be treated with surgery or drugs. Electroconvulsive therapy has also proved to be a successful short-term treatment for depressive symptoms of bipolar disorder and related illnesses, although the reasons for its success are almost completely unknown. There is also evidence for a genetic factor in causing psychological illness.(2)(3). The main cures for psychological illness under this model: electroconvulsive therapy, drugs and surgery at times can have very good results in restoring \\"normality\\" as biology has been shown to play some sort of role in psychological illness. However they can also have consequences, whether biology is responsible or not, as drugs always have a chance of causing allergic reactions or addiction. Electrotherapy can cause unnecessary stress and surgery can dull the personality, as the part of the brain responsible for emotion (hypothalamus) is often altered or even completely removed. =Evaluation of the biological (medical) model= A diagnosis of mental 'illness' implies that a person is in no way responsible for the abnormality of functioning and as such is not to blame. The concept of 'no blame' is generally thought to be more humane and likely to elicit a much more sympathetic response from others. However Zarate (1972), pointed out that even more than physical illness, mental illness is something that people fear ‚Äì largely because it is something they do not understand. In general, people do not know how to respond to someone diagnosed as mentally ill. There may also be fears that the person's behaviour might be unpredictable or potentially dangerous. Therefore, sympathy is more likely to give way to avoidance of the person, which in turn leads to the person feeling shunned. A huge amount of research has been carried out within the framework of the medical model and this has greatly increased our understanding of the possible biological factors underpinning psychological disorders. However, much of the evidence is inconclusive and findings can be difficult to interpret. For example, in family studies, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of genetics from the effects of environment. It can also be difficult to establish cause and effect. For example, raised levels of dopamine may be a consequence rather than a cause of schizophrenia. Many psychologists criticise psychiatry for focusing its attention primarily on symptoms and for assuming that relieving symptoms with drugs cures the problem. Unfortunately, in many cases when the drug treatment is ceased the symptoms recur. This suggests that drugs are not addressing the true cause of the problem.Mike Cardwell, Liz Clarke & Claire Meldrum. (2008) Psychology for AS Level. London. Harper Collins Publishers Limited Behavioural model The behavioural model to abnormality assumes that all maladaptive behaviour is essentially acquired through one's environment. Therefore, psychiatrists practising the beliefs of this model would be to prioritise changing the behaviour over identifying the cause of the dysfunctional behaviour. The main solution to psychological illness under this model is aversion therapy, where the stimulus that provokes the dysfunctional behaviour is coupled with a second stimulus, with aims to produce a new reaction to the first stimulus based on the experiences of the second. Also, systematic desensitisation can be used, especially where phobias are involved by using the phobia that currently causes the dysfunctional behaviour and coupling it with a phobia that produces a more intense reaction. This is meant to make the first phobia seem less fearsome etc. as it has been put in comparison with the second phobia. This model seems to have been quite successful, where phobias and compulsive disorders are concerned, but it doesn't focus on the cause of the illness or problem, and so risks recurrence of the problem. =Evaluation of the behavioural model= The behavioural model overcomes the ethical issues raised by the medical model of labelling someone as 'ill' or 'abnormal'. Instead the model concentrates on behaviour and whether it is 'adaptive' or 'maladaptive'. The model also allows individual and cultural differences to be taken into account. Provided the behaviour is presenting no problems to the individual or to other people, then there is no need to regard the behaviour as a mental disorder. Those who support the psychodynamic model, however, claim the behavioural model focuses only on symptoms and ignores the causes of abnormal behaviour. They claim that the symptoms are merely the tip of the iceberg ‚Äì the outward expression of deeper underlying emotional problems. Whenever symptoms are treated without any attempt to ascertain the deeper underlying problems, then the problem will only manifest itself in another way, through different symptoms. This is known as symptom substitution. Behaviourists reject this criticism and claim that we need not look beyond the behavioural symptoms as the symptoms are the disorder. Thus, there is nothing to be gained from searching for internal causes, either psychological or physical. Behaviourists point to the success of behavioural therapies in treating certain disorders. Others note the effects of such treatments are not always long lasting. Another criticism of the behavioural model are the ethical issues it raises. Some claim the therapies are dehumanising and unethical. For example, aversion therapy has been imposed on people without consent. Cognitive model The cognitive model of abnormality focuses on the cognitive distortions or the dysfunctions in the thought processes and the cognitive deficiencies, particularly the absence of sufficient thinking and planning. This model holds that these variables are the cause of many psychological disorders and that psychologists following this outlook explain abnormality in terms of irrational and negative thinking with the main position that thinking determines all behaviour. The cognitive model of abnormality is one of the dominant forces in academic psychology beginning in the 1970s and its appeal is partly attributed to the way it emphasizes the evaluation of internal mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, and problem-solving. The process allows psychologists to explain the development of mental disorders and the link between cognition and brain function especially to develop therapeutic techniques and interventions. When it comes to the treatment of abnormal behavior or mental disorder, the cognitive model is quite similar to the behavioural model but with the main difference that, instead of teaching the patient to behave differently, it teaches the patient to think differently. It is hoped that if the patient's feelings and emotions towards something are influenced to change, it will induce external behavioural change. Though similar in ways to the behavioural model, psychiatrists of this model use differing methods for cures. One key assumption in cognitive therapy is that treatment should include helping people restructure their thoughts so that they think more positively about themselves, their life, and their future. One of the main treatments is rational emotive therapy (RET), which is based on the principle that an \\"activating\\" emotional event will cause a change in thoughts toward that situation, even if it is an illogical thought. So with this therapy, it is the psychiatrist's job to question and change the irrational thoughts. It is similar to the behavioural model where its success is concerned, as it has also proved to be quite successful in the treatment of compulsive disorders and phobias. Although it does not deal with the cause of the problem directly, it does attempt to change the situation more broadly than the behavioural model. Due to their respective characteristics and similarities, there are instances when psychologists combine cognitive and behavioural models to treat mental disorders. Psychodynamic model The psychodynamic model is the fourth psychological model of abnormality, and is based on the work of Sigmund Freud. It is based on the principles that psychological illnesses come about from repressed emotions and thoughts from experiences in the past (usually childhood), and as a result of this repression, alternative behaviour replaces what is being repressed. The patient is believed to be cured when they can admit that which is currently being repressed (4). The main cure for illnesses under this model is free association where the patient is free to speak while the psychiatrist notes down and tries to interpret where the trouble areas are. This model can be successful, especially where the patient feels comfortable to speak freely and about issues that are relevant to a cure.

Since they are not prolific egg layers, Rouen ducks are most commonly bred for their meat. The breed originated in France sometime before the 19th century. Description The plumage coloring of both the Rouen drake and the Rouen duck are nearly identical to that of the Mallard drake and Mallard duck. The Mallard color pattern is referred to as gray. Males have green heads, white collars, black tail coverts and dark, ashy brown tail feathers, a gray body, and a deep claret breast. The female Rouen hens are a consistent shade of mahogany brown, with a brown crown and tan eye-stripes extending from bill to the back of the eyes. Another feature of the female color pattern is the distinct, detailed penciling found on feathers of the head, neck, body, most of the wing and tail. Rouen females can be much darker brown than Mallard females. Both sexes also have blue speculum feathers. However, Rouen speculum feathers are brighter in color and larger in size than that of the Mallard. Adult Rouen ducks are typically significantly larger than Mallard ducks. The Rouen duckling is identical to the Mallard duckling in terms of plumage coloring. In North America, two distinct types are bred: the common, or production-bred, variety that is larger than a Mallard but has a typical duck conformation, and the much larger and squarer standard-bred variety. The production variety normally weighs 6-8 lbs (2.7-3.6 kg) while the standard-bred weighs 9-12 lb (4.1-5.4 kg). Rouen ducklings can be distinguished from wild mallard ducklings by the presence of a second stripe which runs across their face, just under their eye, whereas mallard ducklings have only one stripe which runs across their eye. History The breed was first raised in France, but it was not until it reached England in the 19th century that it was refined into the breed recognized as the Rouen today. The French version resembled a larger than average Mallard, but by selective breeding, the British developed the exhibition-type Rouen. The final product was a bird with a deep, long keel, boat-shaped profile, enormous appearance, and refined markings, especially the penciling on the female. It was used chiefly as a roasting bird; though it produced 35 to 125 eggs a year, there were other breeds which were more reliable egg-layers with higher production. The eggs are typically white but can have blue and green tints. Exhibition-typed Rouen ducks have been known to crush their eggs if allowed to set due to their massive frames. In 1861, Mrs. Beeton said of it: The origin of the name is not known. When they arrived in England, they were variously called the Rh√¥ne, after the region in southwest- central France, Rohan, after the cardinal of that name, Roan, for the mixture of colors, and Rouen after the northern French town, with Rouen eventually being adopted in both England and France. In France, they are called Rouen Fonc√© (dark) as opposed to Rouen Clair, which are lighter in color. In 1850 the first Rouens were introduced to the United States by D. W. Lincoln of Worcester, Massachusetts, and used as general farm ducks until becoming popular as show birds. They were included in the Standard of Perfection of the American Poultry Association in 1874 and since then have won many titles, often having the most entries in the heavyweight class and doing well in competition with other breeds.

She was 23 years old and allegedly eight months pregnant when she and Father Ladislao Guti√©rrez faced a firing squad.Executions of Camila O'Gorman and Father Ladislao Guti√©rrez, executedtoday.com, 18 August 2008; accessed 28 July 2015. Biography Camila was born in Buenos Aires, the youngest daughter of Adolfo O'Gorman y Perich√≥n Vandeuil, and his wife, Joaquina Xim√©nez Pinto. She was the second-to-last of six children in an upper-class family of mixed Irish, French and Spanish descent. Typical of powerful families in Argentina's post-colonial era, two of her brothers went on to pursue reputable careers. One as an ordained priest of the Jesuit Order, and the other as a police officer and the eventual founder of the Buenos Aires Police Academy. She was also the granddaughter of Ana P√©richon de O'Gorman (1776‚Äì1847), renowned lover of the Viceroy of the La Plata Santiago de Liniers, First Count of Buenos Aires. As the first British invasion occurred, Liniers was part of the defence of Buenos Aires. For heroic actions in defence of the city, Santiago de Liniers was appointed Military Governor of Buenos Aires, and Perichon de O'Gorman became the unofficial first lady. Her importance and power led to accusations intended to discredit her, including allegations that she was a spy for the French or the English. After Liniers died in 1810 she retired to a quieter life with her sons and died peacefully in 1847, at the age of 72. In 1847 Argentina was governed by Juan Manuel de Rosas, a general of the Argentine Army and a politician. Rosas governed the Argentine Confederation by decree from 1829 to 1852. Camila was considered a pillar of polite society, a close friend and confidante of Rosas' daughter, Manuelita, and a frequent guest at the Governors Residence. In her late teens, Camila was introduced to Father Ladislao Guti√©rrez, a Jesuit priest who had attended seminary with her brother. At the time, the Society of Jesus was the only institution within Argentina's Catholic Church which continued to speak out against Rosas' police state tactics. This led Rosas to later banish the Jesuits from Argentina. Father Guti√©rrez came from a similar background; his uncle was the provincial governor of Tucum√°n, Celedonio Guti√©rrez. Father Guti√©rrez had been assigned as the parish priest of Nuestra Se√±ora del Socorro (Our Lady of Relief) and was frequently invited to the O'Gorman family's estate. They soon began a clandestine affair. They escaped in December 1847 and settled in Goya, Corrientes Province, where they set up the town's first school and posed as a married couple under false names. Corrientes was at the time under the control of Benjam√≠n Virasoro, a warlord hostile to Rosas. As the scandal broke, Adolfo O'Gorman sent a letter to Rosas accusing Gutierrez of having seduced Camila, \\"under the guise of religion\\". Adolfo described himself and his family as heartbroken and pleaded that his daughter be rescued from the man he accused of having kidnapped her.Adolfo O'Gorman's Letter to Juan Manuel de Rosas, chnm.gmu.edu, 21 December 1847. Rosas' exiled political opponents, and future president Domingo Faustino Sarmiento declared that Rosas was responsible for the moral corruption of Argentine womanhood. Camila and Ladislao were recognised by an Irish priest, Fr. Michael Gannon. Among others, Father Anthony Fahy and lawyer Dalmacio V√©lez Sarsfield \\"demanded an exemplary punishment of the wayward daughter that was also giving the industrious and well-regarded [Irish] community a bad name\\".Julianello, Mar√≠a Teresa, The Scarlet Trinity: The Doomed Struggle of Camila O'Gorman against Family, Church and State in 19th-Century Buenos Aires, irlandeses.org (Cork: Irish Centre for Migration Studies), 2000. The couple was abducted from Corrientes Province and returned to Buenos Aires. Camila claimed she had initiated her relationship with Gutierrez and insisted on their elopement, angrily denying rumors that she had been raped. From Buenos Aires, Rosas had given strict orders ‚Äì the fugitives were to be sent to the prison of Santos Lugares (today San Andr√©s, General San Mart√≠n, Buenos Aires Province) in separate carriages ‚Äì as indicated by Foreign Relations Minister Felipe Arana in his warrant of arrest. Before reaching their final destination, Camila wrote to Manuelita Rosas, with the hope that she might persuade her father into granting clemency. Manuelita replied to her friend's letter, promising to help. Manuelita optimistically furnished a cell in a nearby Convent with a piano and books. However, Rosas denied his daughter's pleas and replied that this case, \\"needs a show of my undisputed power, as the moral values and sacred religious norms of a whole society are at stake\\". At the time, Rosas had removed the administration of justice from the courts and taken it upon himself. As per protocol, he signed a decree ordering the executions. Immediately after arriving to the prison, according to canon law, Father Castellanos, the prison chaplain, visited Camila's cell and baptised her unborn baby. This consisted of Camila drinking holy water and placing consecrated ashes on her forehead. The next morning, 18 August 1848, O'Gorman and Guti√©rrez were taken to the courtyard, tied to chairs, and blindfolded. Rosas accepted full responsibility for the execution, and said nobody had made any plea on behalf of the couple, overlooking the pleas of his own daughter, Manuelita. Many documents have survived, including a letter from Adolfo O'Gorman to Rosas, demanding \\"exemplary punishment for the most atrocious and unheard of event in this country\\". A book published in 1883, many years after the event, by Antonino Reyes, who had served Rosas for 14 years and was his aide-de-camp, secretary, sergeant major, and chief of police at Santos Lugares Prison. Reyes was so moved that he decided not to witness the executions and out of compassion ordered both bodies to be placed in the same coffin. Only then did he write to Rosas and inform him that his orders had been carried out. In the aftermath of their deaths, both friends and enemies of Rosas claimed to be appalled by the cruel and senseless execution, including Sarmiento and his fellow Unitarios, and wrote about it using terms such as \\"the beautiful girl\\", \\"the doomed couple\\" and \\"the repression of love\\". Camila was 20 years old and eight months pregnant with an illegitimate child. Father Guti√©rrez was 24 years old.

The control track encodes a series of pulses, each pulse corresponding to the beginning of each frame. This allows the video tape player to synchronize its scan speed and tape speed to the speed of the recording. Thus, the recorded control track defines the speed of playback (e.g. SP, LP, EP, etc.), and it is also what drives the relative counter clock that most VCRs have.  Significance and use  The control track is used to fine-tune the tape speed during playback, so that the high speed rotating heads remained exactly on their helical tracks rather than somewhere between two adjacent tracks (known as \\"tracking\\"). Since good tracking depends on precise distances between the rotating drum and the fixed control/audio head reading the linear tracks, which usually varies by a couple of micrometers between machines due to manufacturing tolerances, most VCRs offer tracking adjustment, either manual or automatic, to correct such mismatches. The control track is also used to hold index marks, which were normally written at the beginning of each recording session, and can be found using the VCR's index search function: this will fast-wind forward or backward to the nth specified index mark, and resume playback from there. At times, higher-end VCRs provided functions for the user to manually add and remove these markshttp://www.crutchfield.com/S-PFiOFC1Dt8s/learn/learningcenter/home/vcr_glossary.htmlJVC HR-S7300 manual: features list: \\"..., Index Search, Manual Index Mark/Erase ...\\" ‚Äî so that, for example, they coincide with the actual start of the television program ‚Äî but this feature later became hard to find. By the late 1990s, some high-end VCRs offered more sophisticated indexing. For example, Panasonic's Tape Library system assigned an ID number to each cassette, and logged recording information (channel, date, time and optional program title entered by the user) both on the cassette and in the VCR's memory for up to 900 recordings (600 with titles).Panasonic Video Cassette Recorder NV-HS960 Series Operating Instructions, VQT8880, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.  Control track damage  A gap in the control track signal of a videotape usually causes a flaw during playback, as the player may lose tracking as soon as the track drops out. This usually leads to a gap in video and audio (since there's no information as to what speed the media is recorded at), the VCR's counter will freeze, and upon re-acquiring the control track, the video sync will be momentarily lost. Problems with control track signals are almost always caused by a gap in recording, e.g. a recording was resumed beyond (rather than at) the point where recording was previously stopped. A control track error can also be caused by a \\"dropout\\" - a defect in the magnetic particles on a tape - but this is very uncommon, as the control track is immune to all but the most severe tape damage. A discontinuous control track was (and still is) especially problematic for analog videotape editing. Each gap in the control track, no matter how brief, destroys synchronization and continuity, which can make a segment of a recorded video difficult or impossible to use for editing. The acronym LOCT (pronounced locked), used by many video professionals, can mean \\"Loss Of Control Track\\" and/or \\"Loss Of Continuous Timecode\\". Though either type of \\"loss\\" can pose similar problems, and both issues are sometimes directly related, control track and timecode are two different things (see timecode). Control track problems cannot be \\"repaired\\". You can duplicate the tape to restore control track continuity, but this will not fix visual and audible \\"glitches\\" caused by gaps in the original control track, and the video itself will suffer quality degradation due to \\"generation loss\\". For this reason, many video professionals would \\"pre-stripe\\" every analog videotape to be used in the field or studio beforehand to help ensure good control track throughout. This was done by pre- recording black to the entire videotape. Pre-striping also facilitated spot- checking for dropouts on the video portion of the tape (usually seen as brief white horizontal \\"dashes\\") before use.

She is best known for the texts of nine cantatas, which Johann Sebastian Bach composed after Easter of 1725.Christiane Mariane von Ziegler (Librettist) - Short Biography Biography Christiana Mariana Romanus was born in Leipzig, where her father served as mayor in 1701. She began her literary career after the death of her second husband, Captain von Ziegler in 1722. She returned to Leipzig, where she lived in the family home, the Romanushaus, with her mother. Her father had received a long-term prison sentence for financial irregularities. Despite the difficult family circumstances, the house became a literary and musical salon. Johann Christoph Gottsched encouraged her poetic activity. She became the first woman member of Gottsched's literary society, the Deutsche Gesellschaft. In 1741 she married for the third time and her literary activity ceased. She died in Frankfurt an der Oder. Libretti Br√ºhl, Leipzig in 1704 Bach moved to Leipzig in 1723 to take up the post of Thomaskantor. In this role he set about composing a large number of cantatas for performance in the city's churches. There is some uncertainty about who was writing Bach's libretti in his first couple of years in Leipzig. Whoever his original librettist was, Bach appears to have been looking for a new librettist in 1724, and this may be when he met Ziegler. The nine cantatas set by Bach to texts by Ziegler are: * Ihr werdet weinen und heulen, BWV 103, 22 April 1725 * Es ist euch gut, da√ü ich hingehe, BWV 108, 29 April 1725 * Bisher habt ihr nichts gebeten in meinem Namen, BWV 87, 6 May 1725 * Auf Christi Himmelfahrt allein, BWV 128, 10 May 1725 * Sie werden euch in den Bann tun, BWV 183, 13 May 1725 * Wer mich liebet, der wird mein Wort halten, BWV 74, 20 May 1725 * Also hat Gott die Welt geliebt, BWV 68, 21 May 1725 * Er rufet seinen Schafen mit Namen, BWV 175, 22 May 1725 * Es ist ein trotzig und verzagt Ding, BWV 176, 27 May 1725 The question arises why Bach turned to other librettists. There were still texts by Ziegler unset. She published a cycle of cantata texts in 1728, the texts set by Bach and others not set by him.Versuche in gebundener und ungebundener Schreibart (Leipzig 1728) John Eliot Gardiner suggests that the relationship between the two may have been strained by Bach's habit of amending her texts to suit his purposes.The versions published by Ziegler are slightly different from the texts used in the cantatas, and this is believed to be the result of the composer modifying the libretti with which he was presented. See Gardiner, John Eliot. Bach: Music in the Castle of Heaven. There also seem to be some examples of lack of communication when Bach sets Ziegler's words by adapting music he had composed earlier (as for example in Er rufet seinen Schafen mit Namen, BWV 175).

Johannes Hendrik Feldmeijer (Assen, 30 November 1910 ‚Äì near Raalte, 22 February 1945) was a Dutch Nazi politician and a member of the NSB. Early years He was born in Assen on 30 November 1910 as Johannes Hendrik Veldmeijer. In 1915, his family's name was changed to Feldmeijer. He used only his middle name, making him Henk Feldmeijer. He graduated from high school in 1928 with top grades in every subject, and started studying mathematics and physics. He interrupted his education to perform national service in 1931. During this period he met a leader of the recently established Stormtroopers of the National Socialist Movement (NSB). He was inspired by the ideas of this movement to become member number 479 in 1932. As one of the first 1,000 members, he had direct access to the movement's leader Anton Mussert. He made many speeches in and around Groningen about the need of a strong leader (Mussert) and against democracy. His speaking talents were quickly recognized, and he got a paid position in the propaganda department. He made many journeys to Nazi Germany, during which he had meetings with SS members; he also visited Scandinavia and Mussolini's Italy. After failing his exams in 1935, he broke off his education and became a full-time employee of the NSB stationed in Utrecht. Because of his membership in the NSB he was fired as a reserve- officer of the army in 1935. Ideological development Feldmeijer belonged to the volkisch group in the NSB, just like Meinoud Rost van Tonningen. This group tried to cultivate the Germanic part of Dutch history, and promoted a racist and anti-semitic view. Feldmeijer had many secret contacts in German SS circles, of which his NSB superiors were not aware. The Volkisch group in the NSB caused a radicalisation of the party's viewpoints. They idealised the lives of the Germanic forefathers of the Dutch people, and the proponents of these theories performed much research on these ideas. In 1937, Feldmeijer became an important member of the organisation Der Vaderen Erfdeel (Heritage of our forefathers), renamed Volksche Werkgemeenschap (Volkisch working community) in 1940; This group performed the research for the Volkisch group in the NSB. The Dutch people had to learn to realise that their culture was a Germanic culture; an important step in the direction of the SS way of thinking. Feldmeijer was strongly attracted to the SS ideology, but had to keep his ties with this organisation a secret as the NSB did not fully appreciate this. In the autumn of 1937, he was forced to leave the headquarters of the NSB in Utrecht because of a conflict with the NSB leader Anton Mussert, and was made the district leader of Salland. In August 1939 Rost van Tonningen appointed him as commander of the Mussert guards. Feldmeijer based the organisation of this paramilitary group of several hundred men on the SS organisation in Germany. In 1939 he made several trips to Berlin to advise the Germans on the Dutch language transmissions of Radio- Bremen. On 3 May 1940 the Dutch government imprisoned him in Fort Ooltgensplaat, where he shared a cell with Rost van Tonningen. He was later transported to France via Belgium, and on 30 May 1940 he was liberated by German troops in Calais. On 2 June 1940 Feldmeijer and Rost van Tonningen arrived back in Den Haag. That same night Rost van Tonningen was invited to a meeting with Heinrich Himmler and Artur Seyss-Inquart to discuss the nazification of the Netherlands and the establishment of a Dutch SS. A few days later, Rost van Tonningen introduced Feldmeijer to Hanns Albin Rauter, the German head of the Dutch occupied territories police, who was impressed with the vigour and charisma of the young Dutchman. Dutch SS Feldmeijer was tasked with establishing and commanding the Nederlandsche SS. Mussert had opposed the creation of the SS in the Netherlands, but German pressure had made him agree to its establishment. De Nederlandsche SS had a maximum membership of 4,000 on 1 November 1942. It always had a double standard, as it was seen as part of the NSB and at the same time part of the German SS. In theory, it was under the leadership of Anton Mussert but in reality Feldmeijer reported to Himmler and his representative in the Netherlands, Hanns Albin Rauter. Feldmeijer stimulated his members to contribute actively to the German war effort: he himself served at the front twice: April‚ÄìMay 1941 as a gunner in the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler in Yugoslavia and Greece, and June 1942 ‚Äì March 1943 as Flak commander in SS-Division Wiking at the Eastern Front in Southern Russia. In March 1943 he was promoted to Standartenf√ºhrer in the Allgemeine SS and in March 1944, after completion of an officer training course, he was promoted to Hauptsturmf√ºhrer in the Waffen-SS. He was decorated with the Iron Cross 2nd Class, the Sturmabzeichen and the Verwundetenabzeichen in black. Conflicts within the NSB Feldmeijer had many conflicts with other members of the NSB because of his strong dedication to the SS. The SS wanted a complete integration of the Netherlands in the Greater German Reich. On the other hand, Mussert wanted a German League of Nations, with Germany as a leading member of the European union of states. The German occupation authorities saw in Feldmeijer a willing tool to keep Mussert's ambitions in check. The conflict between the SS and the NSB came to a boil in May 1943, and while Feldmeijer and Mussert made a public appearance together to show their good relations, in practice all ties between the NSB and the German SS were severed. War crimes and death Feldmeijer supported the retaliatory measures taken against the resistance actions against NSB members. He was a member of the Sonderkommando-Feldmeijer between September 1943 and September 1944, and executed at least 20 people for resistance activities in an operation named Silbertanne Aktion. Other prominent members of the commando were Heinrich Boere, and Klaas Carel Faber and his brother. In February 1945 he was appointed to command a battalion of the Landstorm Nederland. While driving to his position at the front, his car was strafed by an Allied fighter plane and Feldmeijer was killed. He was buried in Haren several days later. Himmler sent Rauter a telegram after hearing of the death of Feldmeijer: I am very sad over the death of Feldmeijer. Please convey my condolences to his wife. Feldmeijer was the future of Holland in my eyes. Don't bother to offer my condolences to Mister Mussert, as he never knew what kind of man he had in Feldmeijer.

Knobel, a ruckman originally from the Gold Coast, was recruited to the AFL in his home state with the Brisbane Lions onto their rookie list. He made his debut in 2000 after a rookie elevation. After getting his chance in Round 14, Knobel held his spot for much of the season, and played in two finals matches. After a disappointing 2001 season, and with the Lions having an abundance of ruck stocks (Keating, McLaren, McDonald, Macdonald among others), they traded him to St Kilda. After fairly limited seasons with the Saints in 2002 and 2003, his 2004 season was much improved, playing all 24 games and becoming the Saints' number one ruckman. Despite his crash and bash ruckwork and tally of 460 hitouts for the year, he was criticised for his lack of around the ground work, averaging just 6 disposals in 2004. This led to him being traded in the 2005 pre-season draft to the Richmond Football Club. In 2005, he missed 3 games late in the year with a hamstring injury but performed better around the ground. In 2006, Knobel played just 3 games and found it hard for selection due to the form of All- Australian ruckman Troy Simmonds. Due to ongoing injury concerns Knobel was unable to play a senior game in 2007 and announced his retirement from AFL football on 28 August 2007. AFLQ After his AFL retirement, Trent Knobel decided to come out of retirement to join AFLQ club Labrador Tigers after rejecting offer from AFLQ power house Southport Sharks and Broadbeach Cats.

Inspired by true events, it was written and directed by Brad Isaacs and stars AnnaSophia Robb and Cayden Boyd. Plot Narrator Benjamin Reynolds (Cayden Boyd) lives with neglectful parents in 1960s west Texas: a mother (Lara Flynn Boyle) who is, as Ben states, \\"psychotically obsessed with movie stars to a point that defies explanation\\" and a father (Matthew Modine) who is overly obsessed with his boat. Ben explains how his father meets his mother under vulnerable circumstances and describes how his \\"folks never should have married, and they definitely should have never had a kid.\\" \\"But they did, it happens. The randomness of life and all that.\\" Ben goes on explaining how things got worse and worse due to his parents obsessions, his mother hiring handymen that resembled attractive movie stars to fix problems his father could have fixed but didn't because he was concentrating on constructing his boat. One stormy night, there is a serious car wreck outside of the Reynolds' diner. Patrons assist in aiding the passengers but find only a single survivor, a young girl about Ben's age. Ben's parents agree to take in this girl, Cassie Kennington (AnnaSophia Robb), as she recuperates from her injuries and until she can be moved into her grandparents' home in Galveston. The first real glimpse at Cass is when Ben brings her a well prepared dinner meal, that she declines after making a snide remark about having a partially lacerated liver. As Ben begins to leave the room, Cass quickly asks if her parents' bodies were already sent back to Amarillo for burial and how the accident was listed on the official police report. Ben responds with an awkward, \\"I'm not really sure.\\" Cass tries to imply that it was her father's tendencies to drive while intoxicated and speeding that caused the accident. The next night we find Cass abruptly awakened from a brief flashback of something she appears to be hiding. Ben is seated at the foot of her bed looking concerned and says, \\"you were screaming.\\" Cass takes a sip of water and only replies that it's late and he should get back to sleep. A few hours later Cass is seated in Ben's room staring blankly at him sleeping. As he awakes to the dawn of morning and notices her, he quietly yells, \\"Jesus!\\" She goes on to ask him if he likes her or just feels sorry for her situation. Ben agrees that he likes her. Cass begins to explain why there is little reason to remain there and encourages him to run away with her and live with her \\"hip\\" aunt (Heather Graham) and uncle (Dylan McDermott), who live in Baltimore. Making their way down the road, Cass explains the importance of having a plan and not just some \\"pipe dream.\\" After Cassie's highly intellectual explanation of what a pipe dream is, he asks, \\"What part of your brain works so hard at and makes you think and talk like that?\\" Cass informs him that her father was a professor with a very wide vocabulary and many unique ideas; that when he wasn't teaching college he \\"taught her\\" and her mother \\"never did anything\\". [about it] Their first stop is at a pig farm run by an also maritally distraught Henderson (Val Kilmer), who approaches them hiding in his hog house. Henderson explains that his wife saw them come in from across the road and tosses Cass and Ben some sandwiches his wife made for them. Henderson welcomes them to stay and responds to Cassie's question of how much is room, board, and water with, \\"I imagine falling to sleep to the smell of pig shit outta do it.\\" Ben later explains that his plan for life is to become a pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals. The two appear to stick around for at least a few days. We don't find out Cassie's full plan but one night, as they hear Henderson and his wife arguing, she tells Ben that them getting married is \\"a major part of the plan.\\" That same night Cass has another nightmarish flashback involving the car accident that gives us a little more depth to her secret. The next day, Henderson performs what imitates a wedding ceremony for the two. They both get back on the road, but when they stop for a break, a police car pulls up. The officers (Stephen Root and Toby Huss) question the two for being alone but Cass quickly creates a story. \\"We're in that green station wagon next to the pissers.\\" Cass goes on to reiterate that their father had a recent bladder transplant and it's been \\"more like a medical convention than a vacation.\\" As Sheriff Brock (Root) is skeptical but nearly convinced, the station wagon pulls out of the parking lot. It seems that Ben and Cass would spend the night in jail when Cass fakes a seizure in her cell. Deputy Raymond Ward (Huss), designated to guard the two, believes it and unwittingly lets Ben out of his cell to assist her. As he prepares to help Ward prevent Cass from choking on her tongue, Ben pushes Ward over giving them enough time to escape and lock the jail cell door behind them. As they take their next break, Ben makes a short argument and questions Cass about her brash attitude. A bus full of hippies pulls up and a man walks up asking for directions to Memphis. Ben and Cass are promised a lift in exchange for Cassie's navigation abilities. However, they're only taken as far as Kentucky because Ben becomes jealous with this guy who gets very social-able with Cass and \\"just lives his life and everything seems to work out.\\" After being dropped off at a farm, Cassie becomes somewhat hostile and begins nagging Ben about how it \\"would be way too comfortable for me and my banged up body to be in a nice warm bus headed exactly where we want to be goin'.\\" Ben's defense is, \\"we're married you know. That's suppose to count for something.\\" In Virginia, Cassie's arm begins to swell. After looking at it, Ben realizes it seems serious and calls a doctor. Seeing as they are two lone children coming to him for medical assistance during the night, they are questioned about where they're from and who their parents are. Cass, once again, attempts to create an elaborate story involving their father being laid off at a local mill and money being tight. Just as before, Cassie's story unfortunately fails. Before they contact the local sheriff, Ben quickly makes up another story about their mother being arrested for armed robbery in Arizona. Cassie is treated and both are back on their way. The next hitchhike engages them with a very kind and talkative African-American couple. The story Ben and Cass provide this time is he is front runner for both \\"Mr. Teen Maryland\\" and \\"Mr. Teen America.\\" He tells his own tale, where Ripley's Believe It or Not is coming to interview his cousin (Cass) for attempting to walk across Kentucky on her hands but being trampled by cattle before nearly making it. Ben tells the couple, that's how she got hurt. They successfully make it to Baltimore, where Cassie's aunt and uncle welcome the two into their home. While initially over-enjoyed by finally reaching their destination, Cass becomes more distant and irritable with everyone. More and more actions begin to trigger these terrible feelings and memories to resurface with more frequent nightmares. Cass than has another horrific flashback that provides another portion of her dark repressed memory. We see Ben getting along with Cassie's aunt and uncle while Cass sits in the corner, alone, and with a look of hollowness and distance. In a later scene, Cassie's uncle decides to try and finally get her involved with the activities. Cass begins dancing with her uncle when he, as a dance move, lifts her up for a moment and he is shocked when Cassie crashes to the floor after struggling from his arms while screaming. She curls up, hides her face, and begins to cry. Her uncle, aunt, and Ben all gather around Cass with looks of fear and confusion. Cassie's recent emotional resurfacing strengthens the belief of psychological trauma. After eventually falling asleep and being taken to bed, Ben awakes to find Cass is missing. He begins to cautiously search the home and finds her staring at him, with a now completely blank look, as she stands with the wind blowing lightly through her hair and gown while standing on the balcony. She is taken to the Mercy Psychiatric Ward in Virginia. There are no words spoken between them as Cass gives Ben a very emotional good-bye hug and is then taken to her room. Ben is sent to a military academy in North Carolina. After hoping Cass will get better, he is informed that she will be sentenced to a high risk observation ward for no less than 18 months. Ben decides to run away from the academy and ultimately go save Cass before its too late. He ends up finding a ride with a businessman (Ethan Phillips), all the way back to Virginia. They talk briefly about families. Ben openly mentions his plan to break his wife out of a psychiatric ward, which has the businessman question if maybe Ben was the one staying at the hospital. Ben produces a plan to sneak into the hospital after hours by quietly catching the door before it closes after an employee leaves for the evening. Ben makes his way to Cassie's room, only to find her eerily calm and quiet. He walks up and sits softly next to her. He tells Cass that he's come to get her out. She seems reluctant and responds, \\"what if I'm really, really tired?\\" Cass then leans over, kisses him lightly on the cheek, and lays her head on his shoulder. The next scene is a flashback and full disclosure of Cassie's destructive secret. It's a stormy night out and the Kennington's are heading hastily down a country road. Cass is seated in the front passenger seat, with her father driving, and her mother sitting in the middle rear seat. Cass is seen placing a pillow to cover up her crossed legs, seemingly to protect herself from her father. Her father then removes the pillow, and begins to rub her leg with his fingers. She soon fights back, screaming, and causes the car to swerve and then crash. After the flashback, we're brought back to Cass and Ben in the hospital. Ben tells her that she \\"took it as long as you could. You can't blame yourself for that.\\" He pushes her hair back to try and comfort her, and she replies sorrowfully with, \\"there are good parts to them to.\\" Ben repeats that its time to leave. Cassie's guilt holds high and she tells him, \\"I'm sick. When you kill two people, it makes you sick.\\" He tells her again that he is taking her out of there and assures her that they'll worry about everything else later. She agrees and they escape. Ben narrates that before he and Cass could start their lives together, he must resolve some things for himself first. Ben is seen burning down his mother's only movie theater and crashing his father's boat. It looks like an act of anger only at first. In fact, he has made them free from their own distractions that kept them from the truth. Now when they had lost what they thought was their only meaning of life, they look ruined, but they are free. As Ben's parents grieve for their lost things, Ben and Cass watch from the top of a nearby pickup truck, arms around each other. The movie then progresses to Ben and Cassie's lives as they get older, with Ben's child voice still narrating. When they are adults, Cass becomes an editor for children books and Ben becomes the youngest pitcher in Major League Baseball to pitch in the World Series. After his arm gives out, he becomes a writer as Cass planned. They eventually have two kids, whose names are unknown. We see, a now elderly, Ben and Cass walking along the beach holding hands. He continues to narrate the lessons he learned in life. \\"Having the chance to give what you never got.\\" \\"Most people need a plan. Life is crazy enough without one.\\" Ben is now walking down the beach all alone. Narration continues, \\"The hardest part of life is losing someone you love. At first, you almost wish you never knew them, so it would stop hurting so much. It feels like it's going to kill you.\\" Now showing earlier scenes when Ben first met Cass and of their journey. \\"What you end up missing the most is the sweet burden of being needed. It gives your life a purpose. It really does. And it makes you feel great.\\" \\"That's something else Cassie taught me. It's all part of the plan.\\" Cast *AnnaSophia Robb as Cassie Kennington *Cayden Boyd as Ben Reynolds *Val Kilmer as Henderson *Matthew Modine as Ben's Father *Lara Flynn Boyle as Ben's Mother *Heather Graham as Cassie's Aunt *Dylan McDermott as Cassie's Uncle References External links * Category:2000s coming-of-age drama films Category:2000s drama road movies Category:2007 films Category:American coming- of-age drama films Category:American drama road movies Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in the 1960s Category:2007 drama films ","title":"Have Dreams, Will Travel"},{"id":"7739520","text":"Zhuo Wenjun as depicted in the album Gathering Gems of Beauty (Áï´È∫óÁè†ËêÉÁßÄ) Zhuo Wenjun (; fl. 2nd century BC) was a Chinese poet of the Western Han dynasty.

He was sometimes referred to as the Chevalier de Rocheblave. Early life Philippe-Fran√ßois de Rastel de Rocheblave was born in Savournon, Hautes-Alpes, France. Illinois Country, Upper Louisiana Territory Philippe de Rocheblave served in the French Army. Rocheblave led French troops in New France, during the Seven Years' War also, known as, the French and Indian War in North America, serving as a lieutenant at Fort de Chartres in the Illinois Country. He later established a business at Kaskaskia. After the British took control of Kaskaskia, he became the commandant of Fort Sainte-Genevi√®ve, in the Illinois Country for New Spain. In 1774, Rocheblave took command of Kaskaskia, for the British. American Revolutionary War In 1778, during the American Revolutionary War, Colonel George Rogers Clark, commander of the Illinois Regiment, Virginia State Forces, captured Kaskaskia for the Americans and took Philippe de Rocheblave prisoner. Rocheblave was sent to Virginia, where he eluded parole and fled to the British forces in New York City. Post-War years and death According to Robert MacIntosh's 2006 book \\"Earliest Toronto\\", after the American Revolutionary War ended, Rocheblave first settled in Upper Canada, where Lord Dorchester, the Governor-General approved a grant of 1000 acres on the banks of the Humber River. However, the grant stalled when it fell to John Graves Simcoe, the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, and his appointees, to process it, and specify the actual acres that should have been his. Philippe de Rocheblave then brought his family to Montreal; they later settled at Varennes in 1789. He became involved in the fur trade in the Detroit region. In 1796, Rocheblave was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada for Surrey and was re-elected in 1796 and 1800, serving until his death in 1802. The sons of Rocheblave, No√´l and Pierre, also, became members of the legislative assembly. Pierre de Rastel de Rocheblave also, became a member of the Lower Canada Legislative Council. Philippe de Rocheblave died on April 3, 1802, in Quebec City, Lower Canada.

The complex conjugate of the D-matrix is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian of spherical and symmetric rigid rotors. The matrix was introduced in 1927 by Eugene Wigner. stands for Darstellung, which means \\"representation\\" in German.  Definition of the Wigner D-matrix  Let be generators of the Lie algebra of SU(2) and SO(3). In quantum mechanics, these three operators are the components of a vector operator known as angular momentum. Examples are the angular momentum of an electron in an atom, electronic spin, and the angular momentum of a rigid rotor. In all cases, the three operators satisfy the following commutation relations, : [J_x,J_y] = i J_z,\\\\quad [J_z,J_x] = i J_y,\\\\quad [J_y,J_z] = i J_x, where i is the purely imaginary number and Planck's constant has been set equal to one. The Casimir operator : J^2 = J_x^2 + J_y^2 + J_z^2 commutes with all generators of the Lie algebra. Hence, it may be diagonalized together with . This defines the spherical basis used here. That is, in this basis, there is a complete set of kets with : J^2 jm\\\\rangle = j(j+1) jm\\\\rangle,\\\\quad J_z jm\\\\rangle = m jm\\\\rangle, where j = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, ... for SU(2), and j = 0, 1, 2, ... for SO(3). In both cases, . A 3-dimensional rotation operator can be written as :\\\\mathcal{R}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma) = e^{-i\\\\alpha J_z}e^{-i\\\\beta J_y}e^{-i\\\\gamma J_z}, where Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥ are Euler angles (characterized by the keywords: z-y-z convention, right-handed frame, right-hand screw rule, active interpretation). The Wigner D-matrix is a unitary square matrix of dimension 2j + 1 in this spherical basis with elements :D^j_{m'm}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma) \\\\equiv \\\\langle jm'  \\\\mathcal{R}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma) jm \\\\rangle =e^{-im'\\\\alpha } d^j_{m'm}(\\\\beta)e^{-i m\\\\gamma}, where :d^j_{m'm}(\\\\beta)= \\\\langle jm' e^{-i\\\\beta J_y}  jm \\\\rangle = D^j_{m'm}(0,\\\\beta,0) is an element of the orthogonal Wigner's (small) d-matrix. That is, in this basis, : D^j_{m'm}(\\\\alpha,0,0) = e^{-im'\\\\alpha } \\\\delta_{m'm} is diagonal, like the Œ≥ matrix factor, but unlike the above Œ≤ factor.  Wigner (small) d-matrix  Wigner gave the following expression: Translated into English by :d^j_{m'm}(\\\\beta) =[(j+m')!(j-m')!(j+m)!(j-m)!]^{\\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\sum_s \\\\left[\\\\frac{(-1)^{m'-m+s} \\\\left(\\\\cos\\\\frac{\\\\beta}{2}\\\\right)^{2j+m-m'-2s}\\\\left(\\\\sin\\\\frac{\\\\beta}{2}\\\\right)^{m'-m+2s}}{(j+m-s)!s!(m'-m+s)!(j-m'-s)!} \\\\right]. The sum over s is over such values that the factorials are nonnegative. Note: The d-matrix elements defined here are real. In the often- used z-x-z convention of Euler angles, the factor (-1)^{m'-m+s} in this formula is replaced by (-1)^s i^{m-m'}, causing half of the functions to be purely imaginary. The realness of the d-matrix elements is one of the reasons that the z-y-z convention, used in this article, is usually preferred in quantum mechanical applications. The d-matrix elements are related to Jacobi polynomials P^{(a,b)}_k(\\\\cos\\\\beta) with nonnegative a and b. Let : k = \\\\min(j+m, j-m, j+m', j-m'). If :k = \\\\begin{cases} j+m: & a=m'-m;\\\\quad \\\\lambda=m'-m\\\\\\\\\\\\ j-m: & a=m-m';\\\\quad \\\\lambda= 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ j+m': & a=m-m';\\\\quad \\\\lambda= 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ j-m': & a=m'-m;\\\\quad \\\\lambda=m'-m \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{cases} Then, with b=2j-2k-a, the relation is :d^j_{m'm}(\\\\beta) = (-1)^{\\\\lambda} \\\\binom{2j-k}{k+a}^{\\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\binom{k+b}{b}^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\left(\\\\sin\\\\frac{\\\\beta}{2}\\\\right)^a \\\\left(\\\\cos\\\\frac{\\\\beta}{2}\\\\right)^b P^{(a,b)}_k(\\\\cos\\\\beta), where a,b \\\\ge 0.  Properties of the Wigner D-matrix  The complex conjugate of the D-matrix satisfies a number of differential properties that can be formulated concisely by introducing the following operators with (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 3), :\\\\begin{align} \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{J}}_1 &= i \\\\left( \\\\cos \\\\alpha \\\\cot \\\\beta \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha} + \\\\sin \\\\alpha {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\beta} - {\\\\cos \\\\alpha \\\\over \\\\sin \\\\beta} {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\gamma} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{J}}_2 &= i \\\\left( \\\\sin \\\\alpha \\\\cot \\\\beta {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\alpha} - \\\\cos \\\\alpha {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\beta} - {\\\\sin \\\\alpha \\\\over \\\\sin \\\\beta} {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\gamma} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{J}}_3 &= - i {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\alpha} \\\\end{align} which have quantum mechanical meaning: they are space- fixed rigid rotor angular momentum operators. Further, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{P}}_1 &= i \\\\left( {\\\\cos \\\\gamma \\\\over \\\\sin \\\\beta}{\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\alpha } - \\\\sin \\\\gamma {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\beta }- \\\\cot \\\\beta \\\\cos \\\\gamma {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\gamma} \\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{P}}_2 &= i \\\\left( - {\\\\sin \\\\gamma \\\\over \\\\sin \\\\beta} {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\alpha} - \\\\cos \\\\gamma {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\beta} + \\\\cot \\\\beta \\\\sin \\\\gamma {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\gamma} \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{P}}_3 &= - i {\\\\partial\\\\over \\\\partial \\\\gamma}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} which have quantum mechanical meaning: they are body-fixed rigid rotor angular momentum operators. The operators satisfy the commutation relations : \\\\left[\\\\mathcal{J}_1, \\\\mathcal{J}_2\\\\right] = i \\\\mathcal{J}_3, \\\\qquad \\\\hbox{and}\\\\qquad \\\\left[\\\\mathcal{P}_1, \\\\mathcal{P}_2\\\\right] = -i \\\\mathcal{P}_3 and the corresponding relations with the indices permuted cyclically. The \\\\mathcal{P}_i satisfy anomalous commutation relations (have a minus sign on the right hand side). The two sets mutually commute, :\\\\left[\\\\mathcal{P}_i, \\\\mathcal{J}_j\\\\right] = 0,\\\\quad i, j = 1, 2, 3, and the total operators squared are equal, :\\\\mathcal{J}^2 \\\\equiv \\\\mathcal{J}_1^2+ \\\\mathcal{J}_2^2 + \\\\mathcal{J}_3^2 = \\\\mathcal{P}^2 \\\\equiv \\\\mathcal{P}_1^2+ \\\\mathcal{P}_2^2 + \\\\mathcal{P}_3^2. Their explicit form is, :\\\\mathcal{J}^2= \\\\mathcal{P}^2 =-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sin^2\\\\beta} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial \\\\alpha^2} +\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial \\\\gamma^2} -2\\\\cos\\\\beta\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial\\\\alpha\\\\partial \\\\gamma} \\\\right)-\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial \\\\beta^2} -\\\\cot\\\\beta\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\beta}. The operators \\\\mathcal{J}_i act on the first (row) index of the D-matrix, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathcal{J}_3 D^j_{m'm}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma)^* &=m' D^j_{m'm}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma)^* \\\\\\\\\\\\ (\\\\mathcal{J}_1 \\\\pm i \\\\mathcal{J}_2) D^j_{m'm}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma)^* &= \\\\sqrt{j(j+1)-m'(m'\\\\pm 1)} D^j_{m'\\\\pm 1, m}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma)^* \\\\end{align} The operators \\\\mathcal{P}_i act on the second (column) index of the D-matrix :\\\\mathcal{P}_3 D^j_{m'm}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma)^* = m D^j_{m'm}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma)^* , and because of the anomalous commutation relation the raising/lowering operators are defined with reversed signs, :(\\\\mathcal{P}_1 \\\\mp i \\\\mathcal{P}_2) D^j_{m'm}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma)^* = \\\\sqrt{j(j+1)-m(m\\\\pm 1)} D^j_{m', m\\\\pm1}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma)^* . Finally, :\\\\mathcal{J}^2 D^j_{m'm}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma)^* =\\\\mathcal{P}^2 D^j_{m'm}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma)^* = j(j+1) D^j_{m'm}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma)^*. In other words, the rows and columns of the (complex conjugate) Wigner D-matrix span irreducible representations of the isomorphic Lie algebras generated by \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal{J}_i\\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{-\\\\mathcal{P}_i\\\\\\\\}. An important property of the Wigner D-matrix follows from the commutation of \\\\mathcal{R}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma) with the time reversal operator T, :\\\\langle jm'  \\\\mathcal{R}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma) jm \\\\rangle = \\\\langle jm'  T^{ \\\\dagger} \\\\mathcal{R}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma) T jm \\\\rangle =(-1)^{m'-m} \\\\langle j,-m'  \\\\mathcal{R}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma) j,-m \\\\rangle^*, or :D^j_{m'm}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma) = (-1)^{m'-m} D^j_{-m',-m}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma)^*. Here we used that T is anti-unitary (hence the complex conjugation after moving T^\\\\dagger from ket to bra), T  jm \\\\rangle = (-1)^{j-m}  j,-m \\\\rangle and (-1)^{2j-m'-m} = (-1)^{m'-m}.  Orthogonality relations  The Wigner D-matrix elements D^j_{mk}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma) form a set of orthogonal functions of the Euler angles \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, and \\\\gamma: :\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} d\\\\alpha \\\\int_0^\\\\pi \\\\sin \\\\beta d\\\\beta \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} d\\\\gamma \\\\,\\\\, D^{j'}_{m'k'}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma)^\\\\ast D^j_{mk}(\\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\gamma) = \\\\frac{8\\\\pi^2}{2j+1} \\\\delta_{m'm}\\\\delta_{k'k}\\\\delta_{j'j}. This is a special case of the Schur orthogonality relations. Crucially, by the Peter‚ÄìWeyl theorem, they further form a complete set. The group characters for SU(2) only depend on the rotation angle Œ≤, being class functions, so, then, independent of the axes of rotation, :\\\\chi^j (\\\\beta)\\\\equiv \\\\sum_m D^j_{mm}(\\\\beta)=\\\\sum_m d^j_{mm}(\\\\beta) = \\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\left (\\\\frac{(2j+1)\\\\beta}{2} \\\\right )}{\\\\sin \\\\left (\\\\frac{\\\\beta}{2} \\\\right )}, and consequently satisfy simpler orthogonality relations, through the Haar measure of the group,Schwinger, J. \\"On Angular Momentum\\", Harvard University, Nuclear Development Associates, Inc., United States Department of Energy (through predecessor agency the Atomic Energy Commission) (January 26, 1952) :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} \\\\int _0^{2\\\\pi} d\\\\beta \\\\sin^2 \\\\left (\\\\frac{\\\\beta}{2} \\\\right ) \\\\chi^j (\\\\beta) \\\\chi^{j'}(\\\\beta)= \\\\delta_{j'j}. The completeness relation (worked out in the same reference, (3.95)) is :\\\\sum_j \\\\chi^j (\\\\beta) \\\\chi^j (\\\\beta')= \\\\delta (\\\\beta -\\\\beta'), whence, for \\\\beta' =0, :\\\\sum_j \\\\chi^j (\\\\beta) (2j+1)= \\\\delta (\\\\beta ).  Kronecker product of Wigner D-matrices, Clebsch-Gordan series  The set of Kronecker product matrices : \\\\mathbf{D}^j(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma)\\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{D}^{j'}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma) forms a reducible matrix representation of the groups SO(3) and SU(2). Reduction into irreducible components is by the following equation:Rose, M. E. Elementary Theory of Angular Momentum. New York, JOHN WILEY & SONS, 1957. : D^j_{m k}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma) D^{j'}_{m' k'}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma) = \\\\sum_{J=j-j'}^{j+j'} \\\\langle j m j' m'  J \\\\left(m + m'\\\\right) \\\\rangle \\\\langle j k j' k'  J \\\\left(k + k'\\\\right) \\\\rangle D^J_{\\\\left(m + m'\\\\right) \\\\left(k + k'\\\\right)}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma) The symbol \\\\langle j_1 m_1 j_2 m_2  j_3 m_3 \\\\rangle is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient.  Relation to spherical harmonics and Legendre polynomials  For integer values of l, the D-matrix elements with second index equal to zero are proportional to spherical harmonics and associated Legendre polynomials, normalized to unity and with Condon and Shortley phase convention: : D^{\\\\ell}_{m 0}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{4\\\\pi}{2\\\\ell+1}} Y_{\\\\ell}^{m*} (\\\\beta, \\\\alpha ) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{(\\\\ell-m)!}{(\\\\ell+m)!}} \\\\, P_\\\\ell^m ( \\\\cos{\\\\beta} ) \\\\, e^{-i m \\\\alpha }. This implies the following relationship for the d-matrix: : d^{\\\\ell}_{m 0}(\\\\beta) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{(\\\\ell-m)!}{(\\\\ell+m)!}} \\\\, P_\\\\ell^m ( \\\\cos{\\\\beta} ). A rotation of spherical harmonics \\\\langle \\\\theta, \\\\phi \\\\ell m'\\\\rangle then is effectively a composition of two rotations, : \\\\sum^\\\\ell_{m'=-\\\\ell} Y_{\\\\ell m'} (\\\\theta, \\\\phi ) ~ D^{\\\\ell}_{m' ~m }(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma). When both indices are set to zero, the Wigner D-matrix elements are given by ordinary Legendre polynomials: : D^{\\\\ell}_{0,0}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma) = d^{\\\\ell}_{0,0}(\\\\beta) = P_{\\\\ell}(\\\\cos\\\\beta). In the present convention of Euler angles, \\\\alpha is a longitudinal angle and \\\\beta is a colatitudinal angle (spherical polar angles in the physical definition of such angles). This is one of the reasons that the z-y-z convention is used frequently in molecular physics. From the time- reversal property of the Wigner D-matrix follows immediately : \\\\left( Y_{\\\\ell}^m \\\\right) ^* = (-1)^m Y_{\\\\ell}^{-m}. There exists a more general relationship to the spin-weighted spherical harmonics: : D^{\\\\ell}_{m s}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,-\\\\gamma) =(-1)^s \\\\sqrt\\\\frac{4\\\\pi}{2{\\\\ell}+1} {}_sY_{{\\\\ell}m}(\\\\beta,\\\\alpha) e^{is\\\\gamma}. https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bbm%3A978-4-431-54180-6%2F1.pdf  Relation to Bessel functions  In the limit when \\\\ell \\\\gg m, m^\\\\prime we have :D^\\\\ell_{mm'}(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma) \\\\approx e^{-im\\\\alpha- im'\\\\gamma}J_{m-m'}(\\\\ell\\\\beta) where J_{m-m'}(\\\\ell\\\\beta) is the Bessel function and \\\\ell\\\\beta is finite.

It commemorates the popular uprising which expelled Polish‚ÄìLithuanian occupation forces from Moscow in November 1612, and more generally the end of the Time of Troubles and turning point of the Polish-Muscovite War (1605‚Äì1618). The day's name alludes to the idea that all classes of Russian society united to preserve Russian statehood when there was neither a tsar nor a patriarch to guide them. In 1613 tsar Mikhail Romanov instituted a holiday named Day of Moscow‚Äôs Liberation from Polish Invaders. It was celebrated in the Russian Empire until 1917, when it was replaced with a commemoration of the Russian Revolution. Unity Day was reinstituted by the Russian Federation in 2005, when the events of the year 1612 have been celebrated instead of those of 1917 every November 4 since. The day is also the feast day of the Russian Orthodox icon of Our Lady of Kazan. Popularity According to a poll in 2007, only 23 percent of Russians know the name of the holiday, up from 8 percent in 2005. 22 percent identified the holiday as the Day of Accord and Reconciliation, the name of the holiday on November 7 during the 1990s. Only 4 percent knew that the holiday commemorates the liberation of Moscow from Polish invaders, down from 5 percent in 2005. Events (2005 onwards) =2005= The center of the first of the revived tradition was Nizhny Novgorod, where monument to Kuzma Minin and Dmitry Pozharsky and Vladimir Putin laid flowers. The Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus', Alexy II was also in attendance. Activities in Moscow, included two processions and a \\"Russian March\\". Religious processions occurred with local heads of administration in attendance. Fundraisers were held in Tula, a district art festival occurred for children with disabilities, and in Kaluga, veterans and orphans were given local confectionery products. =2006= A Russian Marc\\" took place, despite bans in cities such as Moscow. A ninety-minute show involving more than a thousand actors was staged in Nizhny Novgorod. =2007= 1612, Vladimir Khotinenko's historical film dramatizing the event the holiday commemorates, was released on November 1. Thirty-nine events were held in Moscow alone. Vladimir Putin laid flowers at the monument to Minin and Pozharsky and presented the Pushkin Medal at a reception in the Moscow Kremlin, \\"for the preservation of Russian spiritual heritage\\" and \\"promotion of the Russian language\\". =2008= President Dmitry Medvedev offering flowers to the Monument to Minin and Pozharsky in Red Square in 2008 President Dmitry Medvedev laid flowers at the monument to Minin and Pozharsky and organized a reception in the Grand Kremlin Palace. In Revolution Square, 7,000 attended a meeting devoted to the Day of National Unity. Activists of the youth movement \\"Nashi\\" called for a day of \\"under the covers\\" - 10,000 young people gathered on Vasilevsky Descent Square to sew a patchwork of thousands into the so- called \\"blanket the world\\". There was a free rock festival \\"Call\\", aimed at combating negative phenomena among young people, such as drugs. =2010= A celebration was held of the consecration of the restored gate icon of St. Nicholas Mozhaiskogo on the Nikolskaya Tower of the Moscow Kremlin, with the participation of the Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus', Kirill I. =2012= Russian religious leaders (Armenian, Judaic, Muslim, Buddhist, Orthodox, Old Believer) during the official celebrations of the National Unity Day, 2012 Nizhny Novgorod was once again the center of the celebration. The organization of the regional government allocated a holiday budget of 15,200,000 rubles. Here, a sculpture 30 meters in length and about 5 meters in height was erected, with the image of Kozma Minin.

They later moved to Saratov. Maria spent her early years in the provinces, where she gained a critical but affectionate appreciation of provincial ways. Her early education in languages and literature was most likely acquired while she was a companion to a daughter of the local nobility. Maria was married at the age of 17 or 18 to a local landowner who served as a district judge. The marriage was unhappy. Maria's husband was originally wealthy, but lost his money gambling and going on sprees. They eventually separated, but only after Maria had given birth to her only son. She moved to Saint Petersburg around 1830. Several years later she began writing to support herself and her child, and to pay off some of her husband's debts. Her first story appeared in 1837, and she published works regularly until her death. Her first success came with the two-volume story collection Evenings on the Karpovka (1838-1839). Her two-volume collection Tales (1840) was well- received, as was her Sketches of Southern France and Nice (1844). Some of Zhukova's stories are historical, and some are set abroad with non-Russian characters, a common feature of Russian fiction in the Romantic period.

Technical textiles include textiles for automotive applications, medical textiles (e.g., implants), geotextiles (reinforcement of embankments), agrotextiles (textiles for crop protection), and protective clothing (e.g., heat and radiation protection for fire fighter clothing, molten metal protection for welders, stab protection and bulletproof vests, and spacesuits).Techtextil: Application areas. Techtextil, Frankfurt: Trade fair for Technical Textiles and Nonwovens] consulted 28 March 2015 The sector is large, growing, and supports a vast array of other industries. The global growth rate of technical textiles is about 4% per year, which is greater than the growth rate of home and apparel textiles, which are growing at a rate of 1% per year. Currently, technical textile materials are most widely used in filter clothing, furniture, hygiene medicals and construction material. Classification Technical textiles can be divided into many categories, depending on their end use. The classification system developed by Techtextil, Messe Frankfurt Exhibition GmbH, is widely used in Europe, North America and Asia. Techtextil specifies 12 application areas: Agrotech, Buildtech, Clothtech, Geotech, Hometech, Indutech, Medtech, Mobiltech, Oekotech, Packtech, Protech, and Sporttech, Architech (Architectural textile), Military textiles, Autotech (Automobile textiles), Smartech (Smart Textiles), Wearable computers, . These are sometimes spelled Agrotex, Buildtex, Clothtex, Geotex, Hometex, Indutex, Medtex, Mobiltex, Oekotex (Ecotex), Packtex, Protex and SportexResisto Protection Textil GmbH visited 21 August 2008 '' =Buildtech (Construction Textiles)= Construction textiles are used in: construction concrete reinforcement, fa√ßade foundation systems, interior construction, insulations, proofing materials, air conditioning, noise prevention, visual protection, protection against the sun, building safety. An interesting and aesthetic appealing application is the use of textile membranes for roof construction. This area is also referred to as textile architecture. PVC coated high tenacity PES, teflon coated glass fibre fabrics or silicone coated PES are used for their low creep properties. Splendid examples of such construction are found in football stadia, airports and hotels. =Clothtech (Clothing Textiles)= Technical textiles for clothing applications. Especially in the finishing process where fabric is treated under pressure and high temperature the technical textile supports the fabric for smooth processing. This is usually the blend of polyester, modal, viscose, nylon, etc. =Geotech (Geotextiles)= These are used in reinforcement of embankments or in construction work.http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/centre- looks-to-promote-use-of-geo-textiles-in-rural-roads/articleshow/48680614.cms The fabrics in geo textiles are permeable fabrics and are used with soils having ability to separate, filter, protect or drain. The application areas include civil engineering, earth and road construction, dam engineering, soil sealing and in drainage systems. The fabric used in it must have good strength, durability, low moisture absorption and thickness. Mostly nonwoven and woven fabrics are used in it. Synthetic fibers like glass, polypropylene and acrylic fibers are used to prevent cracking of the concrete, plastic and other building materials. Polypropylene and polyester are used in geo textiles and dry/liquid filtration due to their compatibility. =Hometech (Domestic Textiles)= Textiles used in a domestic environment - interior decoration and furniture, carpeting, protection against the sun, cushion materials, fireproofing, pillows, floor and wall coverings, textile reinforced structures/fittings. In the contract market such as for large area buildings, ships, caravans, busses, ... fire retardant materials are used. Fire retardant properties are obtained either through the use of inherent fire retardant fibres such as modacryl or through the application of a coating with fire retardant additives (bromide of phosphorus compounds). =Indutech (Industrial Textiles)= Textiles used for chemical and electrical applications and textiles related to mechanical engineering. Silk-screen printing, filtration, plasma screens, propulsion technology, lifting/conveying equipment, sound- proofing elements, melting processes, roller covers, grinding technology, insulations, seals, fuel cell. Lifting textiles Technical textiles for Lifting applications. Used in process of lifting heavy goods. The textile produced is strongly woven with High tenacity yarns and the fabric is treated with heat and high temperature controlling its elongations. This is usually made of High tenacity polyester and Nylon however HMPE yarns as Dyneema are also used. =Mobiltech (Textiles used in transport; automotive and aerospace)= These textiles are used in the construction of automobiles, railways, ships, aircraft and spacecraft. Examples are Truck covers (PVC coated PES fabrics), car trunk coverings (often needle felts), lashing belts for cargo tie downs, seat covers (knitted materials), seat belts, non-wovens for cabin air filtration (also covered in indutech), airbags, parachutes, boats (inflatable), air balloons. These textiles are used in automobiles, ships and aircraft. Many coated and reinforced textiles are used in materials for engines such as air ducts, timing belts, air filters, non-wovens for engine sound isolation... A number of materials are also used in the interior of cars. The most obvious are seat covers, safety belts and airbags but one can find textiles also for the sealing. Nylon gives strength and its bursting strength being high is used as air bags in cars. Carbon composites are mostly used in the manufacture of aeroplane parts while carbon fibre is used for making higher end tyres. High tensile polyester is used for making air balloons. =Oekotech or Ecotech (Ecological Protection Textile)= New applications for textiles in environmental protection applications - floor sealing, erosion protection, air cleaning, prevention of water pollution, water cleaning, waste treatment/recycling, depositing area construction, product extraction, domestic water sewerage plants. =Packtech (Packaging textiles)= Packaging, silos, containers, bags, lashing straps, canvas covers, marquee tents. =Protech (protective textiles)= The main target of the technical protective fabrics is to improve people safety in their workplaces. A technical protective fabric can save a worker's life, that's why, most of them are mainly used to manufacture PPE (personal protective equipment). The demand of these fabrics is growing around the world thank to the sensibilitization of the society, requiring more safety at work. There are some organizations around the world (ASTM and ISO) which describe the requirements and regulations, to fulfill by a fabric, to be considered as a technical protective fabric. The aim of a technical protective fabric isn't fashion, they are designed to have extra values in protection, against some hazards. Nowadays it can be found in the market, technical fabrics which protect of: * High temperatures (insulating, firefighters) * burns (flame, convective and radiant heat, firefighters, ATEX area) * Electric arc flash discharge (plasma explosion, Electric companies) * molten metal impacts (foundries) * metal sparks (welding) * acid environment (petrochemical, gas, refineries, chemical) * bullet impact (military, security) * cut resistant (gloves, glass industry) * astronaut's suits * Left over food packets * Paid banks These fabrics are made of different kind of fibers, because every blend apports different technical characteristics to the fabric: * Meta-Para aramides ‚Äì Nomex: high resistance, tear, tensile strength, expensive, * Wool viscoses polyamide ‚Äì marlan : repellency of molten metal, heat insulation, transparency. * Glass fiber - High resistance, insulating. * Modacrylic cotton ‚Äì Marko wiki: Marko : electric arc flash protection, comfort, flame-resistant, multinorm, efficient, skin friendly, antistatic. * Polyamide ‚Äì Kevlar : extreme resistance, low aging =Sportech (Sports textiles)= Shoes, sports equipment, flying and sailing sports, climbing, angling, cycling, winter and summer sports, indoor sport it can vary from anything including sports bags. Specific areas of application =Conveyor belts= For industrial applications and in power transmission, technical textiles are used in conveyor belts. Carcass is a fabric inside the conveyor belt, which is responsible for the strength and stretch properties of the belt. This carcass is made with layers of woven fabrics bonded together. =Electronics in textiles= It has been heard that soon textiles will be merged with electronics in all areas. In future wearable computers would be launched, these will not be like advance wrist watches etc., they will contain IC s in fabric to develop fabric keyboards and other wearable computer devices. These types of products are known as Interactive electronic textiles (IET). Research to support IET development is being conducted in many universities. Growing consumer interest in mobile, electronic devices will initiate the demand for IET products. See also *Landscape fabric *marlan *marko *Biotextile References *Horrocks, A.R.; S.C.

Traditionally believed to be a cultivar of the Wych Elm U. glabra, its fastigiate shape when young, upward-curving tracery, small samarae and leaves, late leaf-flush and late leaf-fall, taken with its south-west England provenance, suggest a link with the Cornish Elm, which shares these characteristics. Description The tree initially has an upright, columnar form,Photograph of fastigiate form of young Exeter elm but later develops a large rounded crown and occasionally reaches 17 m in height. Older specimens may develop pendulous branches.Wilkinson, Gerald, Epitaph for the Elm (London 1978), p.62 Exeter Elm is chiefly distinguished by its contorted leaves, < 11 cm long by 8 cm broad, rounder than the type [wych] and with more laciniate margins,Bean, W.

The four were rated less resistant than U. foliacea clone 23, from Spain, later cultivated as 'Christine Buisman'. 'Exoniensis' possesses a moderate resistance to the more virulent strain of Dutch elm disease, and consequently often featured in the Dutch elm breeding programme in association with the Field Elm (U. minor) and Himalayan Elm (U. wallichiana). Cultivation Once commonly planted in the UK and parts of western Europe, 'Exoniensis' is also known to have been marketed in Poland in the 19th century by the Ulrich nursery,Ulrich, C. (1894), Katalog Drzew i Krezewow, C. Ulrich, Rok 1893-94, Warszawa Warsaw, and remains in commerce there. The Sp√§th nursery of Berlin cultivated the tree as U. montana fastigiata (U. exoniensis Hort.) from the early 20th century. It is possible that three trees supplied by the Sp√§th nursery to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1902 as U. montana fastigiata were Exeter Elm, old specimens of which survive in Edinburgh (it was the practice of the Garden to distribute trees about the city). In Sweden 'Exoniensis' is sometimes pruned from an early age to form a tidy cone-shaped tree called locally 'pyramidalm' (: pyramid elm - also one of Sp√§th's names for 'Exoniensis').Photographs of 'Pyramidalm' and unpruned 'Exoniensis' in Sweden, www.tradgardsakademin.se Lars Lagerstedt, Pyramid Elm in Lustgarden, 2013, p.40 It is found in Australia at the Ballarat Botanical Gardens where it is listed on the Significant Tree Register of the National Trust.

The purple and green nodes indicate semiprime ideals. The purple nodes are prime ideals, and the purple and blue nodes are primary ideals. In ring theory, a branch of mathematics, semiprime ideals and semiprime rings are generalizations of prime ideals and prime rings. In commutative algebra, semiprime ideals are also called radical ideals. For example, in the ring of integers, the semiprime ideals are the zero ideal, along with those ideals of the form n\\\\mathbb Z where n is a square-free integer. So, 30\\\\mathbb Z is a semiprime ideal of the integers (because 30 = 2 √ó 3 √ó 5, with no repeated prime factors), but 12\\\\mathbb Z\\\\, is not (because 12 = 22 √ó 3, with a repeated prime factor). The class of semiprime rings includes semiprimitive rings, prime rings and reduced rings. Most definitions and assertions in this article appear in and . Definitions For a commutative ring R, a proper ideal A is a semiprime ideal if A satisfies either of the following equivalent conditions: * If xk is in A for some positive integer k and element x of R, then x is in A. * If y is in R but not in A, all positive integer powers of y are not in A. The latter condition that the complement is \\"closed under powers\\" is analogous to the fact that complements of prime ideals are closed under multiplication. As with prime ideals, this is extended to noncommutative rings \\"ideal-wise\\". The following conditions are equivalent definitions for a semiprime ideal A in a ring R: * For any ideal J of R, if Jk‚äÜA for a positive natural number k, then J‚äÜA. * For any right ideal J of R, if Jk‚äÜA for a positive natural number k, then J‚äÜA. * For any left ideal J of R, if Jk‚äÜA for a positive natural number k, then J‚äÜA. * For any x in R, if xRx‚äÜA, then x is in A. Here again, there is a noncommutative analogue of prime ideals as complements of m-systems. A nonempty subset S of a ring R is called an n-system if for any s in S, there exists an r in R such that srs is in S. With this notion, an additional equivalent point may be added to the above list: * R\\\\A is an n-system. The ring R is called a semiprime ring if the zero ideal is a semiprime ideal. In the commutative case, this is equivalent to R being a reduced ring, since R has no nonzero nilpotent elements. In the noncommutative case, the ring merely has no nonzero nilpotent right ideals. So while a reduced ring is always semiprime, the converse is not true.The full ring of two-by-two matrices over a field is semiprime with nonzero nilpotent elements. General properties of semiprime ideals To begin with, it is clear that prime ideals are semiprime, and that for commutative rings, a semiprime primary ideal is prime. While the intersection of prime ideals is not usually prime, it is a semiprime ideal. Shortly it will be shown that the converse is also true, that every semiprime ideal is the intersection of a family of prime ideals. For any ideal B in a ring R, we can form the following sets: :\\\\sqrt{B}:=\\\\bigcap\\\\\\\\{ P\\\\subseteq R \\\\mid B \\\\subseteq P, P \\\\mbox{ a prime ideal} \\\\\\\\}\\\\subseteq\\\\\\\\{x\\\\in R\\\\mid x^n\\\\in B \\\\mbox{ for some }n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}^+ \\\\\\\\} \\\\, The set \\\\sqrt{B} is the definition of the radical of B and is clearly a semiprime ideal containing B, and in fact is the smallest semiprime ideal containing B. The inclusion above is sometimes proper in the general case, but for commutative rings it becomes an equality. With this definition, an ideal A is semiprime if and only if \\\\sqrt{A}=A. At this point, it is also apparent that every semiprime ideal is in fact the intersection of a family of prime ideals. Moreover, this shows that the intersection of any two semiprime ideals is again semiprime. By definition R is semiprime if and only if \\\\sqrt{\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}}=\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}, that is, the intersection of all prime ideals is zero. This ideal \\\\sqrt{\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}} is also denoted by Nil_*(R)\\\\, and also called Baer's lower nilradical or the Baer-Mccoy radical or the prime radical of R. Semiprime Goldie rings A right Goldie ring is a ring that has finite uniform dimension (also called finite rank) as a right module over itself, and satisfies the ascending chain condition on right annihilators of its subsets. Goldie's theorem states that the semiprime right Goldie rings are precisely those that have a semisimple Artinian right classical ring of quotients. The Artin‚ÄìWedderburn theorem then completely determines the structure of this ring of quotients.

He was the highest SS and Police Leader in the occupied Netherlands and therefore the leading security and police officer there during the period of 1940‚Äì1945. Rauter reported directly to the Nazi SS chief, Heinrich Himmler, and also to the Nazi governor of the Netherlands, Arthur Seyss-Inquart. After World War II, he was convicted in the Netherlands of crimes against humanity and executed by firing squad. Early life and career Born in Klagenfurt, Rauter graduated from High school in 1912 and started training as an Engineer at the Graz University of Technology. At the outbreak of World War I Rauter volunteered for service in the Austro-Hungarian Army. He served with a Gebirgssch√ºtzenregiment and was discharged in 1919, having reached the rank of Oberleutnant. Rauter took part in the K√§rntner Freiheitskampf of 1919, and from May until July 1921 he fought in the Freikorps Oberland in Oberschlesien. For his service during the war, Rauter received several decorations including Austrian Military Merit Cross 3rd Class with War decoration, Silver Medal for Bravery, Wound Medal or Karl Troop Cross. Rauter first met Adolf Hitler in 1929 and joined the Nazi cause in Austria. His forays in Austria forced him to flee to Germany in 1933, where he became part of the NSDAP department for Austria. He joined the SA, and was active in planning illegal NSDAP activities in Austria. In 1935 he left the SA to become a member of the SS. Until 1940 he was the Leader of the SS Southeast department in Breslau. Actions in the occupied Netherlands Leider Anton Mussert giving a speech to NSB volunteers in Den Haag, October 1941. To the rear are Rijkscommissaris Arthur Seyss- Inquart, general Hendrik Seyffardt and SS Obergruppenf√ºhrer Hanns Albin Rauter In May 1940 he was appointed Generalkommissar f√ºr das Sicherheitswesen (General Commissioner for Security) and H√∂herer SS-und Polizeif√ºhrer (Higher SS and Police leader) for the occupied Netherlands. In his position as police commander and highest ranking SS leader in the Netherlands, Rauter was responsible for the deportation of 110,000 Dutch Jews to the Nazi concentration camps (6,000 survived) and the repression of the Dutch resistance. He had 300,000 Dutchmen deported to Germany for forced labour. His first victims to die were those killed during the armed break up of the February strike on 26 February 1941, accounting for 9 dead that day: he also immediately declared a state of emergency and ordered summary executions. He was the chief promoter of terror through summary arrests and internment in the Netherlands. The SS set up a concentration camp named Herzogenbusch after the city of 's-Hertogenbosch, but located in the neighboring town of Vught that gave the camp its name: Kamp Vught. In total this camp detained 31,000 people, of whom some 735 were killed. Also, his SS manned a so-called polizeiliches Durchgangslager or police transit camp near Amersfoort, known as Kamp Amersfoort, in fact also a concentration camp, where some 35,000 people were detained and maltreated and 650 people (Dutch and Russian) died. Rauter's SS also managed the Kamp Westerbork (polizeiliches Durchgangslager Westerbork), the place from which some 110,000 Dutch Jews were deported to Nazi concentration and extermination camps, mainly Auschwitz and Sobibor. Under Rauter's guidance, a special block was built for 'political prisoners' (i.e. resistance workers) in the Scheveningen prison. These were often held in indefinite detention. In total 28,000 people were detained here over 4 years; many were severely mistreated, some were tried and 738 men and 21 women died here or on the nearby execution field, the Waalsdorpervlakte (now a national place of remembrance). Rauter also instigated a system of retaliation for assaults on Nazi officials and their Dutch collaborators: one killed Nazi equalled ten Dutch victims, one killed Dutch collaborator equalled three Dutch victims. During 1944 these numbers sharply increased with the rise of resistance violence. During the Allied assault on Arnhem in Operation Market Garden, Rauter took the active field command of the Kampfgruppe Rauter during operations in the Veluwe area and near the bridges over the IJssel river. Kampfgruppe Rauter consisted of the Landstorm Nederland, Wachbataillon Nordwest and a regiment of the Ordnungspolizei. After the assault on Arnhem had been fought off by the Germans, Rauter was given the command of the Maas front as a General in the Waffen-SS. In the night of 6‚Äì7 March 1945 he was severely wounded by an attack staged by the Dutch resistance at Woeste Hoeve on the Veluwe, a little village between Arnhem and Apeldoorn. In a reprisal organised by SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Karl Eberhard Sch√∂ngarth, the Germans executed 117 political prisoners at the location of the attack as well as 50 prisoners in Kamp Amersfoort and 40 prisoners each in The Hague and Rotterdam‚Äî a total of 263 persons were killed (including one German soldier). This attack had not been planned; the resistance merely wanted to hijack a truck and use it to drive to a farmer who had butchered cows for the German army. Instead of the truck, Rauter's BMW motorcar was stopped by members of the resistance dressed in German uniforms. However, Rauter had just two weeks earlier issued a directive stating that German patrols should not stop any German military vehicles outside towns or villages, and a firefight broke out. His fellow passengers were all killed, but Rauter feigned death and survived. He was found by a German military patrol and transferred to a hospital where he remained until his arrest by British Military Police after the end of hostilities. After the war SS Obergruppenf√ºhrer Hanns Albin Rauter on trial at The Hague in 1948 Rauter was handed over to the Dutch government by the British and was tried by a special court in The Hague. Rauter denied committing war crimes, but the court found him guilty and sentenced him to death. A film record was made of the trial. The death sentence was confirmed by a higher court on 12 January 1949, and Rauter was executed by firing squad near Scheveningen on 24 March 1949. The location of his grave remains a state secret.

History The Desert Sun is owned by Gannett publications since 1988 and acquired the Indio Daily News in 1990 to become the sole local newspaper. First issued on August 5, 1927, as a weekly six-page newspaper, The Desert Sun grew with the desert communities it serves. It covers local, state, national and world news, and has developed a variety of sections over time. The newspaper began to publish six days a week in 1955 and had their first Sunday edition on September 8, 1991. Their circulation to date is 50,000 and their distribution range is in regional communities from Beaumont to Twentynine Palms to the Salton Sea. The Desert Suns headquarters are in Palm Springs, in an office complex built in 1991 to replace a smaller building. The Desert Sun publishes the Desert Post Weekly, a variety entertainment paper available on every Thursday in the distribution range, as well as city-specific publications The Indio Sun, The La Quinta Sun, The Palm Springs Weekend, The Palm Desert Sun and The Cathedral City Sun. In 2010, the second page of the primary section is known as \\"7 by 7:30AM\\", to focus on the editor's selected seven most important stories of the day. The namesake was to estimate how long it takes to read the second page in half an hour (from 7:00 AM to 7:30 AM). Greg Burton served as executive editor of the paper from 2011‚Äì2018, before leaving to become executive editor of The Arizona Republic.

Influencer content may be framed as testimonial advertising; influencers play the role of a potential buyer, or may be involved as third parties. These third parties can be seen in the supply chain (such as retailers or manufacturers) or as value-added influencers, such as journalists, academics, industry analysts, and professional advisers.Brown, Duncan and Hayes, Nick. Influencer Marketing: Who really influences your customers?, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008.  Social influence  Most discussions of social influence focus on social persuasion and compliance.Cialdini, Robert. Influence: Science and Practice, Allyn and Bacon, 2001. In the context of influencer marketing, influence is less about arguing for a point of view or product than about loose interactions between parties in a community (often with the aim of encouraging purchasing or behavior). Although influence is often equated with advocacy, it may also be negative.Reichheld, Fred. The Ultimate Question: Driving Good Profits and True Growth, Harvard Business School Press, 2006. The two-step flow of communication model was introduced in The People's Choice (Paul Lazarsfeld, Bernard Berelson, and Hazel Gaudet's 1940 study of voters' decision-making processes), and developed in Personal Influence (Lazarsfeld, Elihu Katz 1955) and The Effects of Mass Communication (Joseph Klapper, 1960). Influencer marketing is also important through social comparison theory. As psychologist Chae reports, influencers serve as a comparison tool. Consumers may compare influencer lifestyles with their imperfections. Meanwhile, followers may view influencers as people with perfect lifestyles, interests, and dressing style. As such, the promoted products may serve as a shortcut towards a complete lifestyle. Chae's study finds women with low self-esteem compare themselves to the influencers. As such, they elevate the status of influencers above themselves. When using an influencer, a brand may use consumer insecurities to its benefits. For this reason, influencer marketing may lead to faulty advertising.  Influencers  There is a lack of consensus about what an influencer is. One writer defines them as \\"a range of third parties who exercise influence over the organization and its potential customers.\\"Peck, Helen; Payne, Adrian; Christopher, Martin; Clark, Moira. Relationship Marketing: Strategy and Implementation, Butterworth-Heinemann, 1999. Another defines an influencer as a \\"third party who significantly shapes the customer's purchasing decision but may never be accountable for it.\\" According to another, influencers are \\"well-connected, create an impact, have active minds, and are trendsetters\\".Keller, Ed and Berry, Jon. The Influentials, Free Press, 2003 And just because an individual has many follows does not necessarily mean they have much influence over those individuals, only that they have many followers. Sources of influencers vary. Marketers target easily identifiable influencers, such as journalists, industry analysts, and high- profile executives. For most business-to-consumer (B2C) purchases, influencers may include people known to the purchaser and the retail staff. In high-value business-to-business (B2B) transactions, influencers may be diverse and might include consultants, government-backed regulators, financiers, and user communities. Forrester Research analyst Michael Speyer notes that for small and medium-sized businesses, \\"IT sales are influenced by several parties, including peers, consultants, bloggers, and technology resellers.\\"Speyer, Michael. Identifying IT Buyers‚Äô Hidden Influencers: Finding And Nurturing Your Brand Presence Beyond Your Formal Channels, Forrester Research, 2007. According to Speyer, \\"Vendors need to identify and characterize influencers inside their market. This requires a comprehensive influencer identification program and the establishment of criteria for ranking influencer impact on the decision process.\\" Influencers can play a variety of roles at different times in a decision-making process, an idea developed by Brown and Hayes. = Identifying influencers = Market-research techniques can be used to identify influencers, using predefined criteria to determine the extent and type of influence. Activists get involved with organizations such as their communities, political movements, and charities. Connected influencers have large social networks. Authoritative influencers are trusted by others. Active minds have a diverse range of interests. Trendsetters are the early adopters (or leavers) of markets. According to Malcolm Gladwell, \\"The success of any kind of social epidemic is heavily dependent on the involvement of people with a particular and rare set of social gifts\\". He has identified three types of influencers who are responsible for the \\"generation, communication and adoption\\" of messages: * Connectors network with a variety of people, have a wide reach, and are essential to word-of-mouth communication. * Mavens use information, share it with others, and are insightful about trends. * Salesmen are \\"charismatic persuaders\\". Their influence is the tendency of others to imitate their behavior. Most current information about influencers focuses on consumer, rather than business-to-business, markets. Word-of-mouth communication is prevalent in a consumer environment. In business marketing, influencers affect a sale but are typically eliminated from the purchase decision. Consultants, analysts, journalists, academics, regulators, and standards bodies are examples of business influencers. Influencers may be further categorized by the number of followers they have on social media. They include outside celebrities with large followings and internet celebrities on social-media platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Their followers range in number from hundreds of millions to 1,000. Influencers may be categorized in tiers (mega-, macro-, micro-, and nano- influencers), based on their number of followers. Businesses pursue people who aim to lessen their consumption of advertisements, and are willing to pay their influencers more. Targeting influencers is seen as increasing marketing's reach, counteracting a growing tendency by prospective customers to ignore marketing. Marketing researchers Kapitan and Silvera find influencer selection extends into product personality. This product and benefit matching is key. For a shampoo, it should use an influencer with good hair. Likewise, a flashy product may use bold colors to convey its brand. If an influencer is not flashy, he will clash with the brand. Matching an influencer with the product's purpose and mood is important. = Payment = Most influencers are paid before the start of a marketing campaign, and others are paid after it ends. Consensus exists about how much an influencer should be paid. Compensation may vary by how many people an influencer can reach, the extent to which they will endorse the product (a deliverable), and the success of their past endorsements have performed. Top-tier influencers and celebrities may receive a six- or seven-figure fee for a single social-media post. In addition to (or in lieu of) a fee, payment may include free products or services. For influencers with smaller followings, free products or services may be the only form of compensation.  Social media  Online activity can play a central role in offline decision-making, allowing consumers to research products. Social media have created new opportunities for marketers to expand their strategy beyond traditional mass-media channels. Many use influencers to increase the reach of their marketing messages. Online influencers who curate personal brands have become marketing assets because of their relationship with their followers. Social-media influencers establish themselves as opinion-leaders with their followers and may have persuasive strengths such as attractiveness, likeability, niche expertise, and perceived good taste. The interactive and personal nature of social media allows parasocial relationships to form between influencers and their followers, which impacts purchase behavior. Influencer marketing on social media reaches consumers who use ad-blockers. Critics of an online-intensive approach say that by researching exclusively online, consumers can overlook input from other influential individuals. Early-2000s research suggested that 80 to 92 percent of influential consumer exchanges occurred face-to-face with word-of-mouth (WOM), compared to seven to 10 percent in an online environment. Scholars and marketers distinguish WOM from electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM). = 2017 controversies = YouTuber PewDiePie's antisemitic and racist comments led to cancelled deals with the Walt Disney Company and a widespread backlash. Celebrity influencer Kendall Jenner and other media personalities failed to disclose their paid endorsements of the fraudulent Fyre Festival, as required by the Federal Trade Commission. YouTuber Logan Paul posted a video containing a dead body in Japan's Suicide Forest, sparking a backlash and accusations of insensitivity. Applications Some marketers use influencer marketing to establish credibility in a market; others use it to create social conversations about their brand, and still others focus on driving online or in-store sales. Marketers leverage credibility gained over time to promote a variety of products or services. They measure their success in several ways, including earned media value, impressions, and cost per action. As marketing scholars Lim et al. find, a social media influencer's personal brand is important. Likewise, product relation is a key factor. As social learning theory suggests, influencers serve as informed consumers. When credible influencers match up with the product, consumers will consider their recommendations. Freberg et al. find respondents see influencers as a neutral authority pitch for a product. Especially when compared to CEO spokespeople, influencers are more approachable and trustworthy. Kapitan and Silvera also mention influencers for older generations. Citing Lithium's 2014 study, a majority of Millennials and Baby Boomers prefer word of mouth. Such research shows influencers are more effective for younger demographics. With the rise of social media influencers, influencer marketing could be a trend.  Regulation  In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) treats influencer marketing as a form of paid endorsement. It is governed by the rules for native advertising, which include compliance with established truth- in-advertising standards and disclosure by endorsers (influencers). In 2017, the FTC sent more than 90 letters to influencers (celebrities and athletes) reminding them of their obligation to disclose sponsored posts with the hashtag #ad. As a result of the FTC's action, Instagram added a feature in 2017 allowing influencers to indicate a \\"paid partnership\\" at the top of a post. Media-regulating bodies in other countries (such as Australia), followed the FTC in creating influencer-marketing guidelines. In 2019, the United Kingdom announced a voluntary agreement between the country's Competition and Markets Authority and high-profile social-media influencers to ensure compliance with consumer law.  Fake influencers  Fake influencers have been around for as long as their genuine counterparts, and all criteria used to determine the veracity of an influencer account can be fabricated. Third- party sites and apps sell services to individual accounts which include falsely increasing followers, likes, and comments. Instagram has failed to shut down all such websites. One marketing agency tested whether fake accounts could be profitable. The company created two fictitious accounts, built their online presence through paid followers and engagement (likes and comments), and applied for work in marketing campaigns on popular influencer-marketing platforms. They published their results, an explanation of how the false accounts were created, and which brands had sponsored them. An analysis of over 7,000 influencers in the UK indicated that about half of their followers have up to 20,000 \\"low-quality\\" followers themselves, consisting of internet bots and other suspicious accounts. Over four in 10 engagements with this group of influencers are considered \\"non-authentic.\\" A study of UK influencers which looked at almost 700,000 posts from the first half of 2018 found that 12 percent of UK influencers had bought fake followers. Twenty-four percent of influencers were found to have abnormal growth patterns in another study, indicating that they had manipulated their likes or followers. Influencer fraud (including fake followers) was estimated to cost businesses up to $1.3 billion, about 15 percent of global-influencer-marketing spending. Research in 2019 accounted only for the calculable cost of fake followers. = Virtual influencers = Virtual influencers are also sometimes considered fake. However, virtual-influencer profiles do not correspond to real individuals and are not automated bots which generate fake likes, comments, or followers. They are virtual characters, intentionally designed by 3D artists to look like real people in real situations. Although most of the characters can be easily identified as computer graphics, some are very realistic and can fool users. The characters are usually identified as models, singers, or other celebrities. Their creators write their biographies, conduct interviews on their behalf, and act like the characters themselves. Lil Miquela was a realistic virtual influencer which prompted curiosity and speculation until it was learned that she was created by advertisers.

This extensive site has been redeveloped and many of the old listed hospital buildings have been renovated, including the old hospital water tower, the highest building in the surrounding area, which now serves as an impressive private dwelling. The traditional village is served by one shop,3 public houses, a veterinary surgery, an off licence and two churches: St Edward's (Anglican) and St Andrew's (Methodist). The modern development has limited amenities, although there is a Latin American cuisine restaurant situated on the canal side, nearby. The village hit the headlines in March 2006 when a fire at a house on Hillside Road killed four people. The cause of the fire was quickly established as arson and eight months later a local man called Mark Goldstraw was found guilty on four counts of murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommended minimum term of 35 years.BBC News Man jailed for four fire murders The village is twinned with Mitterteich in Germany.

He appeared in court in London on 21 September accused of collecting information about potential terrorist targets and traveling to Pakistan earlier this year for terrorism training, after the full 28-day period of arrest without charge allowed under the Terrorism Act 2006. His wife, Mehreen Haji, was arrested on 19 September and charged with supplying ¬£4000 to Habib Ahmed \\"knowing or having reasonable suspicion that it would, or might be used for the purposes of terrorism\\". Police claimed the pair were members of Al-Muhajiroun, the Islamic militant group founded by radical Muslim cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed who was then serving a jail sentence for inciting terrorism. In March 2007, Habib and Mehreen Haji appeared at the Central Criminal Court in London. Habib was accused of receiving weapons training for terrorism in Pakistan and having information likely to be useful for terrorism, while Mehreen was accused of raising money to be used for terrorism. Habib was remanded in custody for likely trial in January 2008 while Mehreen was released on bail. Two further men, both friends of Ahmed, were arrested at 6am on 2 September from houses in Cheetham Hill as part of the same investigation, but were released without charge two weeks later. They could not explain why they had been arrested; according to the family of one of the freed men, he was a member of Al Muhajiroun when he was younger, but now had nothing to do with the group. In September 2007, an associate of Habib Haji, Raingzieb Ahmed, from Fallowfield, Manchester, who had been in custody in Pakistan, was deported to the UK and arrested on arrival. He was charged with directing a terrorist organization, possessing information which would be useful to a terrorist and possessing a rucksack which contained traces of explosives. Both Habib Ahmed and Rangzieb Ahmed were found guilty of being members of al-Qaeda in December 2008. Mehreen Haji was cleared of two counts of arranging funding for the purposes of terrorism.

Early life and education  Roe was born in Skeirke, Borris-in-Ossory, County Laois. He started playing rugby at The King's Hospital school, Dublin when he was ten years old. After studying at Trinity College, he was ordained a deacon in the Church of Ireland in 1953, and priest in 1954. He joined Lansdowne rugby football club for the 1953-54 season. he served a curacy at Sandford, Dublin in the Diocese of Dublin and Glendalough from 1953 to 1955.  Rugby career  Roe was first selected to play for the Barbarians while studying at Trinity College in 1951. He played in a total of eleven matches for the Barbarians and scored two tries. From 1952 to 1957 Roe played in twenty-one matches for 's national rugby team as hooker. In 1955 Roe toured with the British and Irish Lions in South Africa, where he played approximately a dozen games (two as prop) and scored a try against Griqualand West. After injuring his ribs early in the tour, his appearances were limited but he still played when required. The tour lasted four months, and Roe's roommates were the 19-year-old Tony O'Reilly, Bill Williams and Bryn Meredith. Roe found the rugby in South Africa more demanding than he was accustomed to in Ireland, and he admired the consistent play of O'Reilly. He disliked South Africa's apartheid system as opposed to his beliefs as a priest. Roe's twenty-inch neck brought some ribbing from his teammates. The Catholics on the team joked that he had a great neck for a Roman collar. In 1955 as an army chaplain based near London, he played about fifteen games for London Irish. Roe thought that Sunbury, the home base of the London Irish, was enjoyable; while the training at London Irish was rigorous, Roe believed that the team at Lansdowne was more settled. Roe regarded fellow hooker Karl Mullen, the man he replaced in the Ireland number 2 jersey and the captain of Ireland and the 1950 British and Irish Lions, as his toughest opponent. In the summer of 1957 Roe was a member of the first Barbarians side to tour outside Britain or Ireland. The team's tour of Canada was a success, with a 6‚Äì0 won-lost record and a 227‚Äì23 points for- against ratio.  Army chaplaincy  Roe joined the British Army in 1955, when he was commissioned (on a Short Service Commission) into the Royal Army Chaplains' Department as a Chaplain to the Forces 4th Class (equivalent to a captain in all other units, chaplains are traditionally addressed as padre regardless of rank). He switched to a full commission in 1958, and was promoted to Chaplain to the Forces 3rd Class (equivalent to a major) in 1961. Roe distinguished himself for bravery while serving as a British Army chaplain attached to the 1st battalion, Lancashire Regiment in Aden in 1967. During the Arab police mutiny (part of the Aden Emergency),Arab police mutiny Roe heard gunfire and left Radfan Camp to investigate. He found a British Army lorry on fire with a number of British soldiers lying dead and wounded. Under heavy fire Roe helped the wounded soldiers to safety in Radfan Camp. Roe was unarmed, as is the custom for military chaplains. He only left the scene after being forcibly turned back by another officer, after he had been shot at and his personal Land Rover struck by machine gun fire. He was awarded the Military Cross for his courage under fire, the award was gazetted on 19 January 1968. He was promoted to Chaplain to the Forces 2nd Class (lieutenant- colonel) in 1969, and to 1st Class (colonel) in 1973. In 1977 he was made an Honorary Chaplain to the Queen. He retired from the Army in 1982, and was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his work as a chaplain in that year's Queen's Birthday Honours. Later life Roe became Rector of Merrow, Surrey (Diocese of Guildford) in 1982 and served there until his retirement in 1989. He then moved to Shalford, Surrey and continued to take services within the diocese. He died on 15 July 2010.

She participated in the Greco-Italian War in 1940‚Äì1941, escorting convoys and unsuccessfully attacking Italian shipping in the Adriatic Sea. After the German invasion of Greece in April 1941, the ship escorted convoys between Egypt and Greece until she evacuated part of the government to Crete later that month and then to Egypt in May. After the Greek surrender on 1 June, Vasilissa Olga served with British forces for the rest of her career. She escorted convoys in the Eastern Mediterranean for the next several months before she was sent to India for a refit. The ship resumed convoy escort duties upon its completion at the beginning of 1942 in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. In December of that year, now operating in the Central Mediterranean, Vasilissa Olga and a British destroyer briefly captured an Italian submarine, but it sank while under tow. The following month, the ship, together with a pair of British destroyers, sank a small Italian transport ship. She was briefly tasked to escort an Australian troop convoy in the Red Sea in February 1943 before returning to the Mediterranean. Together with a British destroyer, Vasilissa Olga sank at least two ships from an Italian convoy in June. Over the next several months, she escorted British ships as the Allies invaded Sicily (Operation Husky)and mainland Italy (Operation Avalanche). The ship was transferred back to the Eastern Mediterranean in September to participate in the Dodecanese Campaign. Together with two British destroyers, she helped to destroy a small German convoy in the islands before beginning to ferry troops and supplies to the small British garrison on the island of Leros. After completing one such mission, she was sunk by German bombers in Lakki harbor on 26 September with the loss of 72 men. Design and description The Vasilefs Georgios-class ships were derived from the British G-class destroyers, modified with German guns and fire-control systems.Friedman, p. 223 They had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draft of . They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The two Parsons geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers for a designed speed of . During her sea trials on 19 December 1938, Vasilissa Olga reached a speed of from , although her armament was not yet installed. The ships carried a maximum of of fuel oil which gave a range of at . Their crew consisted of 162 officers and crewmen.Whitley 1988, p. 155 Unlike her sister ship , Vasilissa Olga was not fitted out to accommodate an admiral and his staff.Freivogel, p. 355 The ships carried four SK C/34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, designated 'A', 'B', 'X' and 'Y', from front to rear, one pair each superfiring forward and aft of the superstructure. Her anti-aircraft (AA) armament consisted of four guns in four single mounts amidships and two quadruple mounts for Vickers AA machineguns. The Vasilefs Georgios class carried eight above-water torpedo tubes in two quadruple mounts. They had two depth charge launchers and a single rack for their 17 depth charges. =Wartime modifications= During her late 1941 refit in Calcutta, India, Vasilissa Olgas armament was revised to better suit her role as a convoy escort. The rear set of torpedo tubes was replaced by a AA gun and 'Y' gun was removed to increase the number of depth charge throwers and depth charge stowage. To reduce topweight, the 3.7 cm guns were replaced by Oerlikon autocannon. Her mainmast was removed and her aft funnel shortened to improve the arcs of fire of her AA guns. The ship was fitted with a Type 128 asdic to improve her ability to detect submarines.Freivogel, p. 361 Construction and service The Vasilefs Georgios-class ships were ordered on 29 January 1937 as part of a naval rearmament plan that was intended to include one light cruiser and at least four destroyers, one pair of which were to be built in Britain and the other pair in Greece.Freivogel, p. 351 Vasilissa Olga was laid down at Yarrow & Company's shipyard in Scotstoun, Scotland, in February 1937, launched on 2 June 1938, and commissioned on 4 February 1939 without her armament, which was installed later in Greece. After the sank the elderly protected cruiser in a sneak attack on 15 August 1940 off the island of Tinos, Vasilissa Olga and her sister were sent to Tinos to escort the merchant ships there home. During the Greco-Italian War she escorted convoys and participated in raids against Italian lines of communication in the Strait of Otranto on the nights of 14/15 November 1940 and 4/5 January 1941 that failed to locate any ships. The sisters ferried the Greek gold reserves to Crete on 1 March.Freivogel, p. 355 After the German invasion of Greece on 6 April, the sisters began to escort convoys between Greece and Egypt via Crete. On 22 April, Vasilissa Olga was ordered to evacuate elements of the Greek government to Crete, including Vice Admiral Alexandros Sakellariou who was the Minister for Naval Affairs, Chief of the Navy General Staff and Deputy Prime Minister. The following month she proceeded to Alexandria, Egypt, and then escorted convoys in the Eastern Mediterranean before departing for India to be modernized on 9 October.Freivogel, pp. 355‚Äì56, 360‚Äì61 The refit was completed on 5 January 1942 and the ship escorted convoys in the Arabian and Red Seas before arriving back in Alexandria on 22 February. Together with the British destroyer , Vasilissa Olga was escorting the oil tanker RFA Slavol off Mersa Matruh, Egypt, when they detected and unsuccessfully attacked the on 26 March. Later that day, the submarine sank both Jaguar and Slavol. Vasilissa Olga ran aground in early May while escorting a convoy between Alexandria and Tobruk and damaged her propellers. After repairs the ship was transferred to the Indian Ocean where she escorted convoys there and in the Red Sea until December when she returned to the Mediterranean.Freivogel, p. 361Whitley, p. 156 On 14 December, Vasilissa Olga and the destroyer forced the to the surface off Malta. The submarine's crew was unable to scuttle their boat and it was taken in tow, although it later sank.Rohwer, p. 219 The following month, on the night of 18/19 January 1943, Vasilissa Olga, along with the destroyers and , intercepted and sank the Italian freighter off the Libyan coast. The following month, the ship was assigned to escort the ocean liners transporting the Australian Army's 9th Division home from Egypt (Operation Pamphlet) as they passed through the Red Sea between 7 and 24 February.Freivogel, pp. 361‚Äì62 On 2 June, during the preparatory stages of Operation Corkscrew (the Allied invasion of the Italian island of Pantelleria), Vasilissa Olga and the destroyer engaged an Italian convoy, sinking its lone escort, the torpedo boat off Cape Spartivento. The convoy, however, managed to limp away. The following month, the ship was assigned to escort the ships of the British Covering Force in the Ionian Sea during Operation Husky and later bombarded Catania, Sicily. After the Italian armistice on 8 September, Vasilissa Olga was one of the ships that escorted Italian ships to Malta on 10 September. The next day, she returned to Italian waters to escort the ships involved in Operation Avalanche.Rohwer, pp. 253, 262Freivogel, p. 362 The ship was transferred to the Eastern Mediterranean to support British forces involved in the Dodecanese Campaign in the Aegean Sea less than a week later, arriving at Alexandria on 16 September. On the night of 17/18 September, she engaged a German convoy off the coast of Stampalia, together with the destroyers and , sinking the transports Pluto and Paula and forced the crew of the escorting whale catcher, Uj 2104, to beach itself. Vasilissa Olga transported of supplies and 300 men of the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment from Haifa, Palestine, to reinforce the British garrison on Leros. After another supply run, she was sunk by Junkers Ju 88 bombers of LG 1 in Lakki on the morning of 26 September, with the loss of 72 men.Freivogel, p. 363; Smith, pp. 192‚Äì99 Notes Bibliography  External links * A complete operational record of Vasilissa Olga * Historical summary from the Hellenic Navy website Category:Vasilefs Georgios-class destroyers Category:Ships built on the River Clyde Category:1938 ships Category:World War II destroyers of Greece Category:World War II shipwrecks in the Aegean Sea Category:Maritime incidents in September 1943 Category:Dodecanese campaign Category:Destroyers sunk by aircraft Category:Ships sunk by German aircraft ","title":"Greek destroyer Vasilissa Olga"},{"id":"7739894","text":"Jan Van Breda Kolff (born December 16, 1951) is an American former college and professional basketball player and college basketball head coach. The son of coach Butch van Breda Kolff and grandson of Dutch soccer player Jan van Breda Kolff, he played from 1975 to 1983 for the Denver Nuggets, Kentucky Colonels, and Virginia Squires in the American Basketball Association, and the New York/New Jersey Nets in the National Basketball Association. From 1970 to 1974 he played for Vanderbilt University, and in 1974 he led the Commodores to a Southeastern Conference championship as SEC Player of the Year. He also spent two years in Italy, from 1983 to 1985, helping Italian team Virtus Bologna win a championship. Coaching career Van Breda Kolff's tenure at St. Bonaventure ended abruptly in controversy late in the 2002‚Äì03 season. St. Bonaventure declared junior college transfer Jamil Terrell eligible to play without sitting out a year (as he would have been under NCAA rules if he had earned an associate degree), even though Terrell had only earned a welding certificate. Athletic director Gothard Lane had told school president Robert Wickenheiser that Terrell was ineligible to play that year. However, Wickenheiser, under prodding from his son Kort, who was also one of Van Breda Kolff's assistants, unilaterally declared Terrell eligible. School officials didn't seek guidance from the NCAA about Terrell's eligibility until the 2002‚Äì03 season was nearly over. The Bonnies were forced to forfeit every game in which Terrell played, and were also barred from the Atlantic 10 Conference tournament. In protest, the Bonnies players opted to sit out the last two games.Weiss, Dick. Bona AD: wronged for doing right. New York Daily News, April 19, 2003.2004 infraction report Van Breda Kolff denied knowing about the scandal, and was cleared of wrongdoing. On April 25, 2007, he was named as one of three finalists to become the new head coach of UC Riverside's men's basketball program. Van Breda Kolff was named coach of the Nashville Broncos of the American Basketball Association in 2008. He stayed with the team through its name change to the Music City Stars, but lost his job when the team disbanded in 2010.

There is a story about the Kasba Ganpati: Some children had brought cows to the area for grazing, and found an idol of Ganapati. Then, they colored this idol and started worshipping it. Shivaji's mother Jijabai also visited the temple often. Hence, Dadoji Konddeo built a pendol in front of the idol; this is where the Kasba Ganpati Temple is located today.

He was the Duke of Zvenigorod and Galich from 1389 until his death. During the reign of his brother Vasily I, he took part in the campaigns against Torzhok (1392), Zhukotin (1414), and Novgorod (1417). He was the chief orchestrator of the Muscovite Civil War against his nephew, Vasily II, in the course of which he twice took Moscow, in 1433 and 1434. Family matters By his wife, Anastasia, the daughter of Yury of Smolensk, Yury had three sons ‚Äî Vasily Kosoy, Dmitry Shemyaka, and Dmitry Krasny. The marriage to Anastasia made him the brother-in-law of ≈†vitrigaila, Grand Duke of Lithuania. The Nativity Cathedral built by Yury in Zvenigorod ca. 1405. Inheritance and claims At his father's death, Yury received in appanage the towns of Zvenigorod, Ruza, and Galich. Upon his brother's death, Yury immediately asserted his claim to the throne of Muscovy against that of Vasily's son, Vasily II. He referenced the old house law of the House of Rurik, whereby the senior throne in the dynasty passed from brother to brother, rather than from father to son. He also interpreted in his favour the testament of Dmitri Donskoi, written at the time when Vasily had been unmarried and childless. Treaty with Vasily II In 1430, Yury and his nephew decided that the issue would be settled in the Golden Horde. The Khan supported the claim of Vasily II, but allowed Yury to take the appanage of his deceased younger brother, Peter of Dmitrov. This decision did not fully satisfy Vasily, who took Dmitrov by force and expelled Yury's governor from the town in 1432. In response, Yury rallied his forces and advanced on Pereslavl-Zalessky. Vasily II was defeated on the bank of the Klyazma River and fled to Kostroma. After that, Yury entered Moscow in triumph and proclaimed himself Grand Duke. Instead of imprisoning his nephew, Yury allowed him to settle in Kolomna and rule the town as his appanage. This show of magnanimity cost him dearly, as scores of Muscovite boyars and noblemen fled to Vasily's court in Kolomna. This shift in momentum impelled Yury to conclude a treaty with Vasily, whereby the uncle renounced his claims to Moscow, promised to deny assistance to his sons, and exchanged Dmitrov for other territories. Vasily returned to Moscow, while Yury withdrew to Galich. Further conflicts The following year, Kosoy and Shemyaka defeated Vasily II on the banks of the Kus River. The grand prince was informed that Yury's troops had been seen among his enemies and decided to punish him for this treachery. In winter 1434, he set Galich ablaze, but Yury had escaped northward to Belozersk. On 16 March, the armies of the uncle and the nephew clashed between Rostov and Pereslavl. Vasily's army was roundly defeated and he sought refuge in Nizhny Novgorod. On 31 March 1434, on the Bright Week Wednesday, Yury again entered Moscow, where he captured Vasily's family and treasury. He was preparing a new campaign against Vasily when he died suddenly, on 5 July 1434, succeeded by his eldest son, Vasily Kosoy.

It was built to serve the mining village of Edlington and the Doncaster suburb of Balby in South Yorkshire, England. The station, like others on the Dearne Valley, consisted of a bed of sleepers set at track level with an old L&Y; coach body lit by a couple of gas lamps for a waiting shelter. The large station sign was removed in the late 1920s and replaced by a simple \\"Edlington\\". The station was opened for passengers on 3 June 1912 and ceased on 10 September 1951. The passenger service was originally operated by a Hughes-designed 'railmotor' which was fitted with vacuum-operated retractable steps, thus saving on platform building. At first, trains were operated on behalf of the DVR by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway; when that company amalgamated with the London and North Western Railway on 1 January 1922, the combined organisation (also known as the London and North Western Railway) absorbed the DVR on the same day.

History The Port Adelaide Racing Club began thoroughbred racing at the course and in 1921 the club bought the site on which the course stands for ¬£25,000. The champion horse Tulloch became the first Australian horse to pass the ¬£100,000 stakes mark when he won he S.J.Pullman Stakes at the track in 1961. Administration of the course was taken over by the South Australian Jockey Club in 1975. The racecourse was also once served by now-demolished Cheltenham Racecourse railway station on the Outer Harbor railway line. In November 2007, the SAJC sold the racecourse land for A$85 million for a new housing development. It was proposed that the money be used to help fund the Victoria Park Racecourse redevelopment. However, following the decision to abandon racing at this venue the money will be utilised for further development at the Morphettville Racecourse.

In 2006 he released his last solo album called Freakeys along with members of both bands. Biography Born in Mococa, a small city from S√£o Paulo state in Brazil, F√°bio began playing simple keyboards from an early age. Along with his older brother Andr√©, both had keyboard classes, which Fabio dropped early. As a teenager, he began rehearsing within his first rock band and having his first small concerts. After that he played in a small professional night band and for 4 years he toured the states of S√£o Paulo and Minas Gerais in a VW Transporter (commonly known in Brazil as \\"Kombi\\", short form of \\"Kombinationfahrzeug\\"). After a tough decision of studying law, along with the college he played in other small rock bands, arranged and produced his first records and worked as a freelancer in several other bands too only for money. In 1999 F√°bio started playing with heavy metal bands, and he recorded his first solo album, All Night Party at Gallamauaka's Land, which he used as a curriculum vitae for his 8 years of music by the time he was finishing college. Record company Mega Hard contacted Hangar and F√°bio recorded the Inside Your Soul album. By 2001, the famous Brazilian band Angra had been split and reformed with Hangar's drummer Aquiles Priester. Aquiles asked F√°bio to join them for the Rebirth tour. Of course he accepted, dropping all other professional commitments in order to become \\"a heavy-metal keyboardist in the land of samba\\". He played a 100 concerts in 17 countries in this tour. In 2001 he also released All Night Party at Gallamauaka's Land. 2003 had F√°bio touring Brazil with Hangar, which he had become a full member the year before.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It begins at Fresh Pond in Cambridge (linking to Fresh Pond Parkway via Concord Avenue), and heads north on the east bank of Alewife Brook, crossing into West Somerville and ending at the Mystic River on the Medford town line, where it becomes Mystic Valley Parkway. The entire length of Alewife Brook Parkway is designated as part of Massachusetts Route 16 (Route 16), while the southernmost sections are also designated as part of Route 2 and U.S. Route 3 (US 3). It is managed by the Department of Conservation and Recreation with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation responsible for bridge maintenance. Route description The southern terminus of the parkway is the westernmost of the two Fresh Pond rotaries, with Concord Avenue connecting the parkway to Fresh Pond Parkway at the eastern rotary. The road is designated Massachusetts Routes 2 (northbound) and 16 (eastbound), and US Route 3 (northbound). The parkway runs roughly north, skirting just east of the Alewife T station to a large intersection (formerly a rotary), where the limited access highway carrying Route 2 to the west begins. The parkway runs north from this intersection, paralleling just east of the course of Alewife Brook, which forms the western boundary of Cambridge with Arlington. The first major intersection is with Massachusetts Avenue, which carries Massachusetts Route 2A eastward toward Porter Square, and Routes 2A and 3 westward into Arlington. The parkway continues to parallel Alewife Brook as it heads north into Somerville. After crossing Broadway, the parkway passes through a rotary- like interchange with Powder House Boulevard. It then passes Dilboy Stadium, on the left, and reaches its northern terminus at a small rotary near where Alewife Brook empties into the Mystic River. There it meets Mystic Valley Parkway, which runs from Arlington just to the west to Medford to the northeast. The Route 16 designation continues northeast. The parkway's total length is just over two miles (about three kilometers). History The parkway, with the surrounding Alewife Brook Reservation (), forms part of Boston's Metropolitan Park District, established in 1893. It was originally planned by landscape architect Charles Eliot as one section of a web of pleasure roads designed for their aesthetics. Nearby Alewife Brook was straightened and channelized between 1909 and 1912, and construction of the parkway was completed by 1916. Landscaping was performed by the famed Olmsted Brothers firm. Route 2 connected to Alewife Brook Parkway as a highway in the present right-of-way at some point before 1937.http://www.schlichtman.org/mahighways/bosmap37.gif A drive-in theatre was built in 1950, replaced by the Fresh Pond Shopping Center in 1962. The current indoor movie theatre next to the shopping center was added in 1964.A Brief Chronology of Fresh Pond Along the southern end, Alewife Brook Parkway underwent further changes beginning in the late 1980s, including a new four lane causeway overpass spanning the Fitchburg line of the Commuter rail, new dedicated shoulder turning-lanes for exiting and entering the shopping centers, enlarged roundabouts with obstructive center trees removed, new raised grassy medians down the center of the parkway, and new trees, light poles, and bike lanes integrated into the sidewalks. Some of the other amenities integrated in the new design include handicap ramps and stairs on the northbound side of the bridge leading to the Rindge Towers, new sidewalk access leading to the Alewife T station, Alewife Linear Park, bike trail adjacent to Jerry's Pond, and a dedicated road for large trucks to service the shopping areas by passing below the overpass. As traffic has grown over the past century, the original aesthetics of the parkway's southernmost sections have been largely lost. It is now the principal connector between Route 2 and the western suburbs, on the one hand, and downtown Cambridge and Boston on the other, and consequently carries a large volume of commuter traffic. The Alewife MBTA station is a prominent feature on the parkway, and there are shopping centers, parking lots, and office and apartment buildings lining the parkway between Alewife station and the southern terminus. =In media= In February 2010, CBS-television affiliate WBZ questioned whether the remaining 118 rotaries such as the ones featured at Alewife Brook Parkway and Fresh Pond Parkway should be scrapped across Massachusetts.

Background Kato Hideki, a Japanese bass guitarist and founding member of Ground Zero, moved to New York City in 1992. He began working with Christian Marclay, Marc Ribot, and John Zorn. In 1995, he began collaborating with Ikue Mori, who had been the drummer for DNA. After DNA disbanded, Mori experimented with drum machines to allow them to play samples of music. Mori and Hideki invited guitarist Fred Frith to the join the group. A founding member of Henry Cow, Frith had lived in New York City for fourteen years and collaborated with many experimental music musicians. According to Mori, the aim of Death Ambient was \\"to create sounds and texture extravaganza.\\" Death Ambient recorded their first album, Death Ambient at Green Point Studio in Brooklyn in 1995. The ambient music was a collection of improvised pieces that included Mori's drum machine generated sound samples. The album was released the same year in the New Japan series on John Zorn's Tzadik record label. In 1997 American guitarist James Plotkin temporarily replaced Frith for a UK tour that included concerts in London and Stirling. The London concert was broadcast on BBC Radio 3's show, Mixing It.

The series began as a mid-season replacement on NBC on April 4, 1948, but was transferred to ABC during 1949. The show was transferred back to NBC during 1951, and then to DuMont from January 10, 1952, to October 10, 1954. Overview On the series, two critics debated a recently published book, one in favor and the other against. Later, the author of the book appeared to meet the critics. Columnist Jack Gaver outlined the concept in his column \\"Up and Down Broadway, in 1946: \\"The author of a current best-seller is tossed in with a couple of guest critics and a commentator and, if he survives 30 minutes of unscripted pro and con, may decide never to write another book. Sometimes the boys get rough and lucky is the writer who draws a couple of critics of such opposed views that they go after each other instead of him.\\" John K. M. McCaffery was the moderator from 1948 to 1951.http://www.radioechoes.com/?page=series&genre;=OTR- Talk&series;=Author%20Meets%20The%20Critics Faye Emerson had a brief stint as moderator during 1952, during which the show was transferred to prime time. Virgilia Peterson was the moderator during the DuMont run from 1952 to 1954, when the show was broadcast Thursdays at 10pm EST. The DuMont episodes of the series were produced by Phyllis Adams Jenkins (1923-2004), a pioneer in providing serious programming intended for daytime television audiences. She later produced other series, including What's the Problem?, the daytime series Home featuring Arlene Francis during the 1950s, and Dinah Shore's daytime series during the 1960s. On his series, Ernie Kovacs parodied it as \\"Author Heats the Critics\\", with the author attacking the critics, rather than the other way around. Broadcast history Martin Stone first proposed producing the program in 1940, but it radio executives found the concept \\"too highbrow\\"; the program was first conceived of by Stone and \\"Albany newspaper man\\" Richard Lewis. It first made air in December 1940, on an Albany station, before moving to Schenectady, and then to New York City. (It was on the AM radio station WHN in New York City, by 1942.) Stone produced the program remotely during much of this era, as he was serving as general counsel for the Lend-Lease Administration and in the Navy, during the Second World War. After six years on local stations, national radio broadcaster Mutual network began airing the program. It carried the series on radio June 12, 1946 to April 2, 1947. It was sponsored by the Book-of-the-Month club, on Mutual. In summer 1946, Stone left Mutual \\"under agreement\\", airing the show on WQXR on Thursdays with the club sponsorship, and on Mutual without sponsorship. On May 20, Mutual filled his old time slot with Books on Trial, a series sponsored by the Literary Guild, featuring a \\"prosecuting attorney and jury.\\" Stone took the situation to court, alleging appropriation and effort to confuse. Stone lost in court, as State Supreme Court Justice Bernard Botein found no conflict of ideas. NBC debuted the series as a weekly radio program, on Sundays, beginning June 1, 1947. By that point, \\"almost 1,000 of the world's top-flight authors and other literary figures\\" had appeared on the program. In one episode before NBC, author Gontran de Poncins walked out on a debate about Kabloona. The series began as a mid-season replacement on NBC on April 4, 1948, but was transferred to ABC during 1949. The show was transferred back to NBC during 1951, and then to DuMont from January 10, 1952, to October 10, 1954. Episode status As with most DuMont series, not many episodes of the DuMont version are known to survive.

In the 1930s he was appointed to the chair of colonial studies at the University of Tokyo, formerly held by his teacher Nitobe Inaz≈ç. However, Yanaihara's pacifist views and emphasis on indigenous self-determination, which he partly inherited from Nitobe - a Quaker and founding member of the League of Nations - came into a full conflict with Japan's wartime government during World War II. He was noted for his criticism of Japan's expansionist policies. As a result, Yanaihara was forced to resign from teaching under pressure by right-wing scholars in 1937. Yanaihara resumed his teaching after the war and taught international economics at the University of Tokyo. He served as the president of the University from 1951 to 1957.

Life Agnes Baldwin Alexander was born July 21, 1875, in the Kingdom of Hawaii. She was the youngest of five children born to William De Witt Alexander and Abigail Charlotte n√©e Baldwin Alexander. The Alexanders were a scion of two of Hawaii's most illustrious Christian missionary families‚Äîthe Alexanders and the Baldwins. Her father was one of Hawaii's most famous men as President of Oahu College, author of \\"A Brief History of the Hawaiian People,\\" and first Surveyor-General of the Hawaiian Islands. Alexander graduated from Oahu College in 1895, later doing undergraduate work at Oberlin College and U.C. Berkeley. After teaching for a few years, she fell prey to chronic illness. In 1900, she joined a group of Islanders who were going on a tour of Europe. In November 1900, she was in Rome where she encountered an American Bah√° º√≠ woman and her two daughters who were returning from a Bah√° º√≠ pilgrimage in the Holy Land, then called Syria. As the result of an epiphany one night, which she described as ‚Äúneither a dream nor vision‚Äù, she embraced the Bah√° º√≠ Revelation and accepted it as God's new message to humanity, proclaimed by Bah√° ºu'll√°h, whose name means 'the Glory of God º. At the request of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's eldest son,  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, Miss Alexander pioneered the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Japan in 1914. In 1921 she became the first to introduce the New Gospel in Korea. Except for extended vacations in Hawaii, Agnes spent over thirty years in Japan. Alexander became an early advocate of Esperanto and used that new international language to spread the Bah√° º√≠ teachings at meetings and conferences. At the request of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's great- grandson Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Baha'i Faith, Agnes Alexander wrote two histories: \\"Forty Years of the Bah√° º√≠ Cause in Hawaii: 1902-1942\\" and \\"History of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Japan: 1914-1938\\". Both of these volumes were published posthumously. In 1957, Shoghi Effendi appointed Agnes Alexander a Hand of the Cause of God, the highest rank one may hold as an individual Bah√° º√≠. In 1964, Alexander represented the Universal House of Justice, the supreme administrative body of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, at the election of Hawaii's first National Spiritual Assembly in Honolulu. After suffering a broken hip in 1965, and spending two years in a Tokyo hospital, Agnes Alexander returned home to Honolulu in 1967. Ironically, the Arcadia residence where she passed her last four years was adjacent to her birthplace on Punahou Street. On January 1, 1971, Alexander died. She was buried behind Kawaiahao Church with her missionary forebears. Family tree Agnes Alexander is related to several notable people including: Amos Starr Cooke, David Dwight Baldwin, William Owen Smith, Samuel T. Alexander, Henry P. Baldwin, Annie Montague Alexander, and others. Her parents were William D. Alexander and Abigail Baldwin and grandparents William P. Alexander and Mary Ann McKinney from her father, and Dwight Baldwin and Charlotte Fowler through her mother. Works Alexander wrote one book on the history of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Japan and was covered in detail by a number of other books. * See also *Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Japan  References  Further reading * Troxel, Duane K.

The game is so called because the aim of the game is to end up with a royal flush of any suit.Geoffrey Mott-Smith & Albert Hodges Morehead, The Complete Book of Solitaire and Patience Games The game is so much mechanical in nature that there is currently no digital implementation. Rules First, the deck is dealt into five piles: two piles of eleven cards and three piles of ten. The player first turns the first pile up and looks for either an ace, a ten, a king, a queen, and a jack, cards which comprise a royal flush. Once such a card is found, the search ends there, with the cards on top of it discarded and those under it left alone. The search then proceeds into the next pile and the search for other cards in the royal flush continues. Also, the suit of the first card found determines the suit of the entire royal flush. When a pile contains no card of the royal flush being searched, the entire pile is discarded. When another royal-flush card is found in a pile, the search continues until all five piles are searched and royal-flush cards are at the top of their piles. Afterwards, the piles are placed on top of each other in the reverse direction of the deal. So if the deal is from left to right, once the search ends, each pile is placed on its neighbor to the left. (Morehead and Mott-Smith's rule said stated that the piles should be turned face down first before the piles are gathered). The discarded cards are set aside. Then without shuffling, the remaining cards are dealt this time into four piles. After this, the search the cards of the royal flush begins again with the same procedure already stated above. Once all four piles are searched and regathered, the remaining cards (again without reshuffling) are dealt into three piles. The process continues, and after the gathering of the piles, the cards are dealt into two piles and the procedure begins once more. When the two piles are regathered, the remaining cards at this point are then dealt into a single pile. Even at this point, the search stops when a royal-flush card is found and the cards on top of it are discarded. The game is won when the cards of the royal flush are the only ones left in the pile and are arranged in any order. If there are any other cards sandwiched among the royal flush cards, the game is lost. Variation To give the game some variation, Lee and Packard suggests the player to try other poker hands such as four-of- a-kinds, full houses, or straight flushes.Sloane Lee & Gabriel Packard, 100 Best Solitaire Games, The player can simply look for a specific hand or look for certain cards to include in their hand while playing the game.

The club was active for 93 years (from 1923 until 2016) as professional club before being dissolved due to financial problems. The club had several successful years in the highest division in Russian basketball. In 2006, Dynamo won a European trophy in the Eurocup. In 2018 the club reestablished as amateur club in the Moscow Basketball League. History =Early years= Created in 1923 when Russia was part of the Soviet Union, Dynamo is among the oldest sports clubs in the country. Its name was chosen because Dynamo means 'power in motion'. The club was backed by the State Political Directorate (GPU), a police apparatus of the USSR. That is why the team has always been thought of as the police club, while cross-town rival CSKA Moscow was the army club. Dynamo quickly earned a reputation outside the Soviet Union borders due to its success in major sports such as football, handball, ice hockey and, of course, basketball. Dynamo Moscow won the USSR League championship in 1937 and 1948 and also made it to the final in 1944 and 1990. =1960s and 1970s= Over the decades, Dynamo earned a reputation for being among the strongest teams nationally and around the continent. Dynamo finished third in the Soviet Union League standings in 1946, 1957 and 1958, as well as making it to the 1952 USSR Cup final. Years of domestic obscurity followed in which the team could not achieve any remarkable domestic success. A few former Dynamo players participated in some of the most historic moments in USSR sport. Aleksandr Boloshev was a member of the Olympic Team that won the gold medal in Munich 1972. Furthermore, Vladimir Zhigili, one of the most famous players in Dynamo's history, was World Champion in Puerto Rico in 1974. =Modern era= The team found new success outside its domestic borders in the mid-1990s. Dynamo made it all the way to the Cup Winners' Cup semi-final in 1991, losing to eventual champ PAOK Thessaloniki. The team also qualified for the Koraƒá Cup in 1992. 1994 and 1995 without much success, despite having players like Sergei Bazarevich, Pavel Astakhov, Sergei Babenko or Evgeniy Pashutin. Things changed in 1996, however, as Dynamo shone in the 1996 Saporta Cup. The club brought in players like Bazarevich, Vitaly Nosov, and Valeri Daineko. Dynamo went all the way from the previous round, survived the group stage and made it to the best-of-three semi-finals playoffs. TAU Cer√°mica swept the series with an 87-98 road win in Moscow and a 104‚Äì93 home triumph in Vitoria, and it went on to win the title against PAOK Thessaloniki. The club could not live up to the expectations and one year after that, in 1997, Dynamo Moscow disappeared due to financial reasons despite having played the Euroleague for the first time in club history. It was not until 2001 when Dynamo reappeared in the Russian basketball scene. MBC Dynamo Moscow was created under the support of the Dynamo society and its chairman Vladimir Pronichev. Dynamo entered the Russian League second division in the 2001‚Äì02 season and won the title that very same year, returning to the elite of Russian basketball. The club had to face new financial problems but once again the Dynamo organization, led by chairman Viktor Zakharov and his assistant Vladimir Mikhalevsky, stepped up to solve all troubles and give the team the economic stability it needed. MBC Dynamo Moscow joined the Dynamo organization in Moscow City and found a new president in his ex-coach Evgeny Gomelsky, brother of the legendary coach and former CSKA president, the late Alexander Gomelsky. Dynamo finished sixth in the 2002-03 Russian League with players like Nikita Morgunov, Martin M√º√ºrsepp, Bazarevich, Aleksander Milosserdov or Dmitri Domani, who remains now as the team captain. Dynamo did even better in the 2003‚Äì04 season, in which players like Nikos Oikonomou, Jimmy Oliver, Nikolay Padius, Damir Mr≈°iƒá and the late Kenyon Jones helped the team to make it to the Russian League semi-finals. Krylatskoe Sports Center, which Dynamo started playing in from 2006 Dynamo continues taking steps forward and making a big financial effort to incorporate some of the best European players in the market. As such, for 2004‚Äì05, Dynamo signed the Euroleague all-time top rebounder, Mirsad T√ºrkcan, the 2003-04 Euroleague regular season top scorer Lynn Greer, center Lazaros Papadopoulos and solid, well-rounded veterans such as Ariel McDonald, Trajan Langdon, K≈°y≈°tof Lavrinoviƒç and Andrei Fetisov. Dynamo won difficult Group D in the ULEB Cup regular season and was considered a top candidate to go far in the elimination rounds, especially when the team won the first leg of the two- way eighth-finals series on the road against Hemofarm, 81‚Äì84, but lost 96‚Äì75 on their own home court. Dynamo once again has a competitive roster in which Papadopoulos, Domani and Valentin Koubrakov returned to be joined by some team-oriented players such as Ruben Douglas, Mire Chatman, Bojan Popoviƒá, Hanno M√∂tt√∂l√§ and Antonis Fotsis. Moreover, Dynamo landed one of the best head coaches in European basketball history, none other than the legendary Du≈°an Ivkoviƒá. With the right environment, a solid roster, a great coach and the hunger to win its first-ever European title, in 2006 the team won the ULEB Cup. In 2006 the club moved to its new arena in the Krylatskoe Sports Center. In the 2006‚Äì2007 season, Dynamo competed in the ULEB Euroleague, reaching the quarterfinals under monster efforts from Fotsis and Papadopoulos. They lost to Panathinaikos B.C. 0:2. A poor finish in domestic competition (4th place) lead the team returning to the ULEB Cup. Before the 2007‚Äì2008 season, coach Ivkoviƒá was replaced by Svetislav Pe≈°iƒá, and players like Milo≈° Vujaniƒá, Henry Domercant and Robertas Javtokas, who replaced Papadopoulos, were signed. Heavy favorites to win, Dynamo struggled - they made the ULEB Cup Final Eight, but lost in the semifinals to CB Girona 78:81 in a huge shock, which lead to the firing of Pe≈°iƒá. He was replaced by Sergei Bazarevich. Dynamo finished in 3rd place in the PBL. In the 2008‚Äì2009 season, David Blatt became head coach, and solid NBA players like Jannero Pargo and Bo≈°tjan Nachbar were signed, along with stars in Europe like Hollis Price and Darju≈° Lavrinoviƒç. Dynamo was a heavy favorite to win the EuroCup Basketball tournament, formerly the ULEB Cup. Despite playing solidly most of the way, Dynamo was plagued by financial problems - Price and Pargo left the team in January, with Brian Chase signing to replace Price. Still a favorite to win the EuroCup, Dynamo suffered a fiasco in the Final Eight tournament, losing to Hemofarm 85:93 in the quarterfinals. In the PBL, Dynamo finished in a disastrous 6th place. The next two seasons, 2009-2010 and 2010‚Äì2011, Dynamo didn't have any success in European competition, never reaching the playoffs in either the EuroCup and the FIBA EuroChallenge tournaments. In the PBL, Dynamo finished in 4th place in 2009‚Äì2010, thanks in most part due to efforts by Sergey Monya and Alexey Shved. In 2010‚Äì2011, in the PBL, Dynamo finished only in 9th place.

Smoak had a difficult time establishing an audience in his home state, so he moved north in the 1950s. Through 1953, he played occasionally with Bill Monroe & His Bluegrass Boys; the following year, he became a permanent member of the band. Smoak joined Hylo Brown & the Timberliners in 1958, and later began to perform with Arthur Smith and the Cracker Jacks on radio stations WAFB in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and WBT in Charlotte, North Carolina. He went solo in 1961 recording for the tiny Folk Lyric label. Smoak played both bluegrass and country music in the 1960s, and in the 1970s, he published three praised banjo instruction books, some of the first to include standard musical notation and tablature.

The n-th term of an automatic sequence a(n) is a mapping of the final state reached in a finite automaton accepting the digits of the number n in some fixed base k.Allouche & Shallit (2003) p. 152Berstel et al (2009) p. 78 An automatic set is a set of non- negative integers S for which the sequence of values of its characteristic function œáS is an automatic sequence; that is, S is k-automatic if œáS(n) is k-automatic, where œáS(n) = 1 if n \\\\in S and 0 otherwise.Allouche & Shallit (2003) p. 168 Definition Automatic sequences may be defined in a number of ways, all of which are equivalent. Four common definitions are as follows. =Automata-theoretic= Let k be a positive integer, and let D = (Q, Œ£k, Œ¥, q0, Œî, œÑ) be a deterministic finite automaton with output, where *Q is the finite set of states; *the input alphabet Œ£k consists of the set {0,1,...,k-1} of possible digits in base-k notation; *Œ¥ : Q √ó Œ£k ‚Üí Q is the transition function; *q0 ‚àà Q is the initial state; *the output alphabet Œî is a finite set; and *œÑ : Q ‚Üí Œî is the output function mapping from the set of internal states to the output alphabet. Extend the transition function Œ¥ from acting on single digits to acting on strings of digits by defining the action of Œ¥ on a string s consisting of digits s1s2...st as: :Œ¥(q,s) = Œ¥(Œ¥(q0, s1s2...st-1), st). Define a function a from the set of positive integers to the output alphabet Œî as follows: :a(n) = œÑ(Œ¥(q0,s(n))), where s(n) is n written in base k. Then the sequence a = a(1)a(2)a(3)... is a k-automatic sequence. An automaton reading the base k digits of s(n) starting with the most significant digit is said to be direct reading, while an automaton starting with the least significant digit is reverse reading.Pytheas Fogg (2002) p. 13 The above definition holds whether s(n) is direct or reverse reading.Pytheas Fogg (2002) p. 15 =Substitution= Let \\\\varphi be a k-uniform morphism of a free monoid \\\\Sigma^* and let \\\\tau be a coding (that is, a 1-uniform morphism), as in the automata-theoretic case. If w is a fixed point of \\\\varphi‚Äîthat is, if w = \\\\varphi(w)‚Äîthen s = \\\\tau(w) is a k-automatic sequence.Allouche & Shallit (2003) p. 175 Conversely, every k-automatic sequence is obtainable in this way. This result is due to Cobham, and it is referred to in the literature as Cobham's little theorem.Cobham (1972) =k-kernel= Let k ‚â• 2\\\\. The k-kernel of the sequence s(n) is the set of subsequences :K_{k}(s) = \\\\\\\\{s(k^e n + r) : e \\\\geq 0 \\\\text{ and } 0 \\\\leq r \\\\leq k^e - 1\\\\\\\\}. In most cases, the k-kernel of a sequence is infinite. However, if the k-kernel is finite, then the sequence s(n) is k-automatic, and the converse is also true. This is due to Eilenberg.Allouche & Shallit (2003) p. 185Lothaire (2005) p. 527Berstel & Reutenauer (2011) p. 91 It follows that a k-automatic sequence is necessarily a sequence on a finite alphabet. =Formal power series= Let u(n) be a sequence over an alphabet Œ£ and suppose that there is an injective function Œ≤ from Œ£ to the finite field Fq, where q = pn for some prime p. The associated formal power series is : \\\\sum_{i \\\\geq 0} \\\\beta(u(i)) X^i . Then the sequence u is q-automatic if and only if this formal power series is algebraic over Fq(X). This result is due to Christol, and it is referred to in the literature as Christol's theorem. History Automatic sequences were introduced by B√ºchi in 1960, although his paper took a more logico-theoretic approach to the matter and did not use the terminology found in this article. The notion of automatic sequences was further studied by Cobham in 1972, who called these sequences \\"uniform tag sequences\\". The term \\"automatic sequence\\" first appeared in a paper of Deshouillers. Examples The following sequences are automatic: =Thue‚ÄìMorse sequence= DFAO generating the Thue‚ÄìMorse sequence The Thue‚ÄìMorse sequence t(n) () is the fixed point of the morphism 0 ‚Üí 01, 1 ‚Üí 10. Since the n-th term of the Thue‚ÄìMorse sequence counts the number of ones modulo 2 in the base-2 representation of n, it is generated by the two-state deterministic finite automaton with output pictured here, where being in state q0 indicates there are an even number of ones in the representation of n and being in state q1 indicates there are an odd number of ones. Hence, the Thue‚ÄìMorse sequence is 2-automatic. =Period-doubling sequence= The n-th term of the period-doubling sequence d(n) () is determined by the parity of the exponent of the highest power of 2 dividing n. It is also the fixed point of the morphism 0 ‚Üí 01, 1 ‚Üí 00.Allouche & Shallit (2003) p. 176 Starting with the initial term w = 0 and iterating the 2-uniform morphism œÜ on w where œÜ(0) = 01 and œÜ(1) = 00, it is evident that the period-doubling sequence is the fixed-point of œÜ(w) and thus it is 2-automatic. =Rudin‚ÄìShapiro sequence= The n-th term of the Rudin‚ÄìShapiro sequence r(n) () is determined by the number of consecutive ones in the base-2 representation of n. The 2-kernel of the Rudin‚ÄìShapiro sequenceAllouche & Shallit (2003) p. 186 is : \\\\begin{align} r(2n) &= r(n), \\\\\\\\\\\\ r(4n+1) &= r(n), \\\\\\\\\\\\ r(8n+7) &= r(2n+1), \\\\\\\\\\\\ r(16n+3) &= r(8n+3), \\\\\\\\\\\\ r(16n+11) &= r(4n+3). \\\\end{align} Since the 2-kernel consists only of r(n), r(2n + 1), r(4n + 3), and r(8n + 3), it is finite and thus the Rudin‚ÄìShapiro sequence is 2-automatic. =Other sequences= Both the Baum‚ÄìSweet sequenceAllouche & Shallit (2003) p. 156 () and the regular paperfolding sequenceBerstel & Reutenauer (2011) p. 92Allouche & Shallit (2003) p. 155Lothaire (2005) p. 526 () are automatic. In addition, the general paperfolding sequence with a periodic sequence of folds is also automatic.Allouche & Shallit (2003) p. 183 Properties Automatic sequences exhibit a number of interesting properties. A non-exhaustive list of these properties is presented below. *Every automatic sequence is a morphic word.Lothaire (2005) p. 524 *For k ‚â• 2 and r ‚â• 1, a sequence is k-automatic if and only if it is kr-automatic. This result is due to Eilenberg. *For h and k multiplicatively independent, a sequence is both h-automatic and k-automatic if and only if it is ultimately periodic.Allouche & Shallit (2003) pp. 345‚Äì350 This result is due to Cobham, with a multidimensional generalisation due to Semenov. *If u(n) is a k-automatic sequence over an alphabet Œ£ and f is a uniform morphism from Œ£‚àó to another alphabet Œî‚àó, then f(u) is a k-automatic sequence over Œî.Lothaire (2005) p. 532 *If u(n) is a k-automatic sequence, then the sequences u(kn) and u(kn ‚àí 1) are ultimately periodic.Lothaire (2005) p. 529 Conversely, if u(n) is an ultimately periodic sequence, then the sequence v defined by v(kn) = u(n) and otherwise zero is k-automatic.Berstel & Reutenauer (2011) p. 103 Proving and disproving automaticity Given a candidate sequence s = (s_n)_{n \\\\ge 0}, it is usually easier to disprove its automaticity than to prove it. By the k-kernel characterization of k-automatic sequences, it suffices to produce infinitely many distinct elements in the k-kernel K_k(s) to show that s is not k-automatic. Heuristically, one might try to prove automaticity by checking the agreement of terms in the k-kernel, but this can occasionally lead to wrong guesses. For example, let :t = 011010011\\\\dots be the Thue‚ÄìMorse word. Let s be the word given by concatenating successive terms in the sequence of run-lengths of t. Then s begins :s = 12112221\\\\dots.. It is known that s is the fixed point h^{\\\\omega}(1) of the morphism :h(1) = 121, h(2) = 12221. The word s is not 2-automatic, but certain elements of its 2-kernel agree for many terms. For example, s_{16n+1} = s_{64n+1} \\\\text{ for } 0 \\\\le n \\\\le 1864134 but not for n = 1864135. Given a sequence that is conjectured to be automatic, there are a few useful approaches to proving it actually is. One approach is to directly construct a deterministic automaton with output that gives the sequence. Let (s_n)_{n \\\\ge 0} written in the alphabet \\\\Delta, and let (n)_k denote the base-k expansion of n. Then the sequence s = (s_n)_{n \\\\ge 0} is k-automatic if and only each of the fibres :I_k(s,d) := \\\\\\\\{(n)_k \\\\mid s_n = d\\\\\\\\} is a regular language.Allouche and Shallit (2003) p. 160 Checking regularity of the fibres can often be done using the pumping lemma for regular languages. If s_k(n) denotes the sum of the digits in the base-k expansion of n and p(X) is a polynomial with non-negative integer coefficients, and if k \\\\ge 2, m \\\\ge 1 are integers, then the sequence :(s_k(p(n)) \\\\pmod{m})_{n \\\\ge 0} is k-automatic if and only if \\\\deg p \\\\le 1 or m \\\\mid k-1.Allouche and Shallit (2003) p. 197 1-automatic sequences k-automatic sequences are normally only defined for k ‚â• 2. The concept can be extended to k = 1 by defining a 1-automatic sequence to be a sequence whose n-th term depends on the unary notation for n; that is, (1)n. Since a finite state automaton must eventually return to a previously visited state, all 1-automatic sequences are ultimately periodic. Generalizations Automatic sequences are robust against variations to either the definition or the input sequence. For instance, as noted in the automata-theoretic definition, a given sequence remains automatic under both direct and reverse reading of the input sequence. A sequence also remains automatic when an alternate set of digits is used or when the base is negated; that is, when the input sequence is represented in base ‚àík instead of in base k.Allouche & Shallit (2003) p. 157 However, in contrast to using an alternate set of digits, a change of base may affect the automaticity of a sequence. The domain of an automatic sequence can be extended from the natural numbers to the integers via two-sided automatic sequences. This stems from the fact that, given k ‚â• 2, every integer can be represented uniquely in the form \\\\sum_{0 \\\\leq i \\\\leq r} a_{i}(-k)^{i} , where a_{i} \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0, \\\\dots, k-1\\\\\\\\}. Then a two-sided infinite sequence a(n)n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} is (‚àík)-automatic if and only if its subsequences a(n)n ‚â• 0 and a(‚àín)n ‚â• 0 are k-automatic.Allouche & Shallit (2003) p. 162 The alphabet of a k-automatic sequence can be extended from finite size to infinite size via k-regular sequences. The k-regular sequences can be characterized as those sequences whose k-kernel is finitely- generated. Every bounded k-regular sequence is automatic. Logical approach For many 2-automatic sequences s = (s_n)_{n \\\\ge 0}, the map n \\\\mapsto s_n has the property that the first-order theory \\\\text{FO}(\\\\mathbb{N},+,0,1,n \\\\mapsto s_n) is decidable. Since many non-trivial properties of automatic sequences can be written in first-order logic, it is possible to prove these properties mechanically by executing the decision procedure. For example, the following properties of the Thue‚ÄìMorse word can all be verified mechanically in this way: *The Thue‚ÄìMorse word is overlap-free, i.e., it does not contain a word of the form cxcxc where c is a single letter and w is a possibly empty word. *A non-empty word x is bordered if there is a non-empty word w and a possibly empty word y with x = wyw. The Thue‚ÄìMorse word contains a bordered factor for each length greater than 1. *There is an unbordered factor of length n in the Thue‚ÄìMorse word if and only if (n)_2 otin 1(01^*0)^*10^*1 where (n)_2 denotes the binary representation of n. The software Walnut, developed by Hamoon Mousavi, implements a decision procedure for deciding many properties of certain automatic words, such as the Thue‚ÄìMorse word. This implementation is a consequence of the above work on the logical approach to automatic sequences.

Events  On 4 September 1944 the Allies had conquered Antwerp, and it was thought that they already advanced into the Netherlands. Radio Oranje broadcasts, one by the Prime Minister-in-exile Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy, increased the confusion; twice, in just over twelve hours (at 23.45 on 4 September and again in the morning of the 5th), they announced that Breda, 8 kilometers from the border with Holland, had been liberated (though in fact this success would not be achieved until 29 October 1944 by forces of 1st Polish Armoured Division of General Maczek). The news spread rapidly, with underground newspapers preparing headlines announcing the \\"fall of Breda\\". Further fueling speculation, German occupation officials Arthur Seyss-Inquart (appointed Reichskommissar for the Occupied Netherlands in May 1940) and Hanns Albin Rauter, SS and police leader announced a \\"State of Siege\\" for the Netherlands to the 300,000 cable radio listeners and in the newspapers of the following day: > The population must maintain order ... it is strictly forbidden to flee > areas that are threatened by the enemy. All orders from the military > commanders must be strictly adhered to and without question ... any > resistance to the occupation forces will be suppressed with force of > weaponry. Any attempt to fraternize with the enemy or to hinder the German > Reich and its allies in any form will be dealt with harshly; perpetrators > will be shot.'Willem Ridder (2007). Countdown to Freedom. AuthorHouse. pp. > 431‚Äì. Despite the threats, many Dutchmen celebrated on the streets while preparing to receive and cheer on the Allied liberators. Dutch and Orange flags and pennants were prepared, and many workers left their workplace to wait for the Allies to arrive. The extent of this optimism as measure of Dutch attitudes to Occupation has been hard for historians to gauge in the absence of any contemporary surveys, but it can be discerned as significant by researchers accessing diaries and finding an increase in births in statistics nine months after Dolle Dinsdag.Bob Moore (2003) ‚ÄòGoed en fout‚Äô or ‚Äògrijs verleden‚Äô?

German occupation forces and NSB members panicked: documents were destroyed and many fled the Netherlands for Germany. Ary Willem Gijsbert Koppejan (1919‚Äî2013), a member of the resistance organisation De Ondergedoken Camera (the Underground Camera), secretly photographed German troops fleeing the city and soldiers and collaborators waiting at the Den Haag railway station on Dolle Dinsdag.  Effects  The Allied advance could not continue as the Allies had overextended themselves and had to halt in the South of the Netherlands and Operation Market Garden in September was an outright failure since the planned Allied advance across the Rhine had to be abandoned. The occupiers' nervousness turned to aggression after the landings in Normandy in June 1944 and increased after Dolle Dinsdag.Dewulf, J. (2011).

Mad Tuesday caused the railway strikes of 1944 that started on 17 September with the code: \\"De kinderen van Versteeg moeten onder de wol\\" (translation: the children of Versteeg must \\"get under the wool\\"/go to bed). The strike would last until the complete Netherlands was liberated on 5 May 1945; the government-in-exile thought that by spreading rumors the Germans would start to panic. It worked, and by announcing the railway strike of 1944 the Germans started to panic even more, and many Germans and Dutch collaborators fled to Germany, fearing reprisals (Seyss-Inquart had already set the example; on September 3, he had sent his wife to Salzburg).Van Der Zee, Henri.

The industry and supply route from and to Germany was almost completely stopped, which made it even harder for Germany to defend what still was occupied.

CD&E; is a forward-looking process for developing and evaluating new concepts, before committing extensive resources. CDE is a process to identify the best solution not only from a technical perspective, but also for possible solutions for challenges involving doctrine, organization, training, and material to achieve significant advances in future operations. CD&E; is a way of thinking your way through the future before spending money. Developing and identifying future-oriented concepts allows one to: * test their validity/feasibility; * take advantage of other studies/experiments conducted and * save resources and avoid duplication. The potential impacts on interoperability and increased capabilities by emerging concepts must be captured by some process and exploited. Concept development gives broad and sometimes ill-defined ideas a chance to be examined by groups of experts in a logical process. These ideas can come from different sources: e.g. Ministry of Defense, industry, servicemen organizations or partners. They can be generated by staff processes, operational experience, formal analytical work, or published proposals. There need be no boundaries on the types of ideas that enter the concept development process, although some simpler ones that modify techniques or procedures might be ‚Äòfast-tracked‚Äô into practice because they are intuitively sound. Typically, promising ideas with a broader scope are explored and refined through workshops and larger seminars to the point where more mature concepts are formed. These concepts are further debated in committees or working groups and, if accepted, are submitted to the experimental process.  Kinds of experiments  Different kinds of experiments can be conducted: * Discovery experiments [a questionable scientific practice] reveal more details of the scrutinized problem. * Hypothesis experiments validate specific thesis and * Demonstration experiments provide an insight into the realization of the a concept.

Alfred Boeddeker, O.F.M. (August 7, 1903 as Anthony Boeddeker ‚Äî January 1, 1994) was an American Franciscan friar who is best known for having founded humanitarian programs to aid the poor and marginalised in the San Francisco Bay Area. These programs, named by Father Boeddeker for Saint Anthony of Padua, include the St. Anthony Dining Room (1950), the St. Anthony Free Medical Clinic (1956), and the St. Anthony Farm, near Petaluma in Sonoma County, California. The dining room and medical clinic are part of the St. Anthony Foundation. Biography Anthony Boeddeker was born in San Francisco, California. He joined the Franciscans in 1921 as brother Alfred and was ordained a priest in 1927. He studied theology at the Santa Barbara Seminary and pastored at the St. Rafael Church in Goleta, California. From 1930 to 1933 studied in Rome, Italy. After his return from Rome, he taught for fifteen years at the Franciscan School of Theology at the Mission Santa Barbara. Boeddeker was selected to start a Catholic university in Hankow, China. In preparation for this assignment, he enrolled in a graduate program at the University of California, Berkeley to study Mandarin, Japanese and Russian languages and Chinese history and politics. The Hankow plans were cancelled, however, after the Chinese Civil War of mainland China in 1949. Father Boeddeker was then appointed pastor of St. Boniface Church in the Tenderloin, San Francisco, California, where he remained for the rest of his life. Not far from this church, two of Boeddeker's sayings are prominently displayed on the walls of the St. Anthony Dining Room on Jones Street: *‚ÄúThe great activity of our life is to love.‚Äù *‚ÄúI see God as one act‚Äîjust loving, like the sun always shining.‚Äù Legacy Singers of the Street perform in Boeddeker Park, August 2016. A park and recreation center named after Boeddeker is located in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco. The recreation center features the sculpture Redding School, Self-Portrait, (4 ft. x 16 1/2 ft. x 2 1/4 in.) which was created as a tribute to Boeddeker by artist Ruth Asawa with assistance from children at Redding Elementary School. The piece, a bas relief wall mural, consists of a portrait of Boeddeker surrounded by children and scenes from San Francisco, including animals, street cars, cars, houses, airplanes and birds. The mural is made of glass fiber reinforced concrete and is framed with a plain concrete border. Children from the school created images with pastry dough which were then added into the mural. The piece was surveyed in 1993 by the Smithsonian Institution's Save Outdoor Sculpture! program and was described as needing conservation treatment. Further reading Hartmann, Madeline.

He sang backing and lead vocals with the band, as well as drumming, and he contributed several songs to their repertoire. Arnott left Spectrum to join Mighty Kong, a new band formed by ex-Daddy Cool members Ross Wilson and Ross Hannaford, but the new group was very short-lived and broke up soon after recording its only LP in late 1973.

He represented the Wallabies in 4 tests in 1961 and the Australia national rugby league team in 13 matches on the 1963 Kangaroo tour. Union career A champion schoolboy athlete Lisle broke into first grade in 1959 with the Sydney suburban club, Drummoyne DRFC (the \\"Dirty Reds\\"). He debuted for NSW in 1960 forming a successful halves combination with Ken Catchpole. In 1961 he made his national rugby union debut as a Wallaby playing three test matches against Fiji. Later that year he made an appearance against South Africa playing inside Mike Cleary. He played rugby union at fly half or centre. League career Along with Cleary, following the South African Wallaby tour he made the code switch and joined the South Sydney Rabbitohs in 1962 . He played 106 grade games with the club till 1968. After just one appearance in the professional code in 1961 he was selected for New South Wales. Three weeks later with still only one club appearance under his belt Lisle made his international rugby league debut in the third test in Sydney against the visiting Great Britain. This stands as the fastest rise to international representative status in Australian rugby league history. At season end after just five club appearances he was selected in the all conquering 1963 Kangaroo tour of England and France though he did not play in any Tests on the tour.

Alchemy derives from the Arabic word kimiya () or al-kƒ´miyƒÅ æ (). The Arabic term is derived from the Coptic , khƒìmia, or , khƒìmeia.\\"alchemy\\", entry in The Oxford English Dictionary, J. A. Simpson and E. S. C. Weiner, vol. 1, 2nd ed., 1989, .p. 854, \\"Arabic alchemy\\", Georges C. Anawati, pp. 853-885 in Encyclopedia of the history of Arabic science, eds. Roshdi Rashed and R√©gis Morelon, London: Routledge, 1996, vol. 3, . However, the ultimate origin of the word is uncertain.Encyclopedia Britannica, 2002 Edition, CD-ROM According to the Oxford English Dictionary, al-kƒ´miyƒÅ æ may be derived from , which is derived from the ancient Egyptian name of Egypt, khem or khm, khame, or khmi, meaning \\"blackness\\", i.e., the rich dark soil of the Nile river valley. Therefore, alchemy can be seen as the \\"Egyptian art\\" or the \\"black art\\". However, it is also possible that al-kƒ´miyƒÅ æ derived from , meaning \\"cast together\\".Weekley, Ernest (1967). Etymological Dictionary of Modern English. New York: Dover Publications. Overview There are two main views on the derivation of the Greek word. According to one, the word comes from the Greek œáŒ∑ŒºŒµŒØŒ±, pouring, infusion, used in connexion with the study of the juices of plants, and thence extended to chemical manipulations in general; this derivation accounts for the old-fashioned spellings \\"chymist\\" and \\"chymistry\\". The other view traces it to khem or khame, hieroglyph khmi, which denotes black earth as opposed to barren sand, and occurs in Plutarch as œáŒ∑ŒºŒµŒØŒ±; on this derivation alchemy is explained as meaning the \\"Egyptian art\\". The first occurrence of the word is said to be in a treatise of Julius Firmicus, an astrological writer of the 4th century, but the prefix al there must be the addition of a later Arabic copyist. In English, Piers Plowman (1362) contains the phrase \\"experimentis of alconomye\\", with variants \\"alkenemye\\" and \\" alknamye\\". The prefix al began to be dropped about the middle of the 16th century (further details of which are given below). =Egyptian origin= According to the Egyptologist Wallis Budge, the Arabic word al-kƒ´miya æ actually means \\"the Egyptian [science]\\", borrowing from the Coptic word for \\"Egypt\\", kƒìme (or its equivalent in the Mediaeval Bohairic dialect of Coptic, khƒìme). This Coptic word derives from Demotic km·ªâ, itself from ancient Egyptian kmt. The ancient Egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour \\"black\\" (Egypt was the \\"Black Land\\", by contrast with the \\"Red Land\\", the surrounding desert); so this etymology could also explain the nickname \\"Egyptian black arts\\". However, according to Mahn, this theory may be an example of folk etymology. Assuming an Egyptian origin, chemistry is defined as follows: :Chemistry, from the ancient Egyptian word \\"khƒìmia\\" meaning transmutation of earth, is the science of matter at the atomic to molecular scale, dealing primarily with collections of atoms, such as molecules, crystals, and metals. Thus, according to Budge and others, chemistry derives from an Egyptian word khemein or khƒìmia, \\"preparation of black powder\\", ultimately derived from the name khem, Egypt. A decree of Diocletian, written about 300 AD in Greek, speaks against \\"the ancient writings of the Egyptians, which treat of the khƒìmia transmutation of gold and silver\\".Oxford English Dictionary Online, s.v. alchemy =Greek origin= Arabic al-kƒ´miya æ or al-khƒ´miya æ ( or ), according to some, is thought to derive from the Koine Greek word khymeia () meaning \\"the art of alloying metals, alchemy\\"; in the manuscripts, this word is also written khƒìmeia () or kheimeia (),Cf. Liddell-Scott-Jones s.v. . which is the probable basis of the Arabic form. According to Mahn, the Greek word œáœÖŒºŒµŒØŒ± khumeia originally meant \\"pouring together\\", \\"casting together\\", \\"weld\\", \\"alloy\\", etc. (cf. Gk. kheein () \\"to pour\\"; khuma (), \\"that which is poured out, an ingot\\"). Assuming a Greek origin, chemistry is defined as follows: :Chemistry, from the Greek word (khƒìmeia) meaning \\"cast together\\" or \\"pour together\\", is the science of matter at the atomic to molecular scale, dealing primarily with collections of atoms, such as molecules, crystals, and metals. From alchemy to chemistry Later medieval Latin had alchimia / alchymia \\"alchemy\\", alchimicus \\"alchemical\\", and alchimista \\"alchemist\\". The mineralogist and humanist Georg Agricola (died 1555) was the first to drop the Arabic definite article al-. In his Latin works from 1530 on he exclusively wrote chymia and chymista in describing activity that we today would characterize as chemical or alchemical. As a humanist, Agricola was intent on purifying words and returning them to their classical roots. He had no intent to make a semantic distinction between chymia and alchymia.Alan J. Rocke, \\"Agricola, Paracelsus, and Chymia,\\" Ambix vol. 32 (1985), 38-45. During the later sixteenth century Agricola's new coinage slowly propagated. It seems to have been adopted in most of the vernacular European languages following Conrad Gessner's adoption of it in his extremely popular pseudonymous work, Thesaurus Euonymi Philiatri De remediis secretis: Liber physicus, medicus, et partim etiam chymicus (Zurich 1552). Gessner's work was frequently re-published in the second half of the 16th century in Latin and was also published in a number of vernacular European languages, with the word spelled without the al-.Alan J. Rocke, \\"Agricola, Paracelsus, and Chymia,\\" Ambix vol. 32 (1985), 38-45. In the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe the forms alchimia and chimia (and chymia) were synonymous and interchangeable. The semantic distinction between a rational and practical science of chimia and an occult alchimia arose only in the early eighteenth century.William R. Newman and Lawrence M. Principe, \\"Alchemy vs. Chemistry: The Etymological Origins of a Historiographic Mistake,\\" Early Science and Medicine, vol. 3 (1998), 32-65. In 16th, 17th and early 18th century English the spellings ‚Äî both with and without the \\"al\\" ‚Äî were usually with an i or y as in chimic / chymic / alchimic / alchymic. During the later 18th century the spelling was re-fashioned to use a letter e, as in chemic in English. In English after the spelling shifted from chimical to chemical, there was corresponding shift from alchimical to alchemical, which occurred in the early 19th century.\\"Chemic\\", \\"chemical\\" and \\"chemistry\\" in New English Dictionary on Historical Principles (year 1893). Also \\"Alchemy\\" and \\"alchemist\\" in New English Dictionary on Historical Principles (year 1888).

The Metaphor machine was one of the first commercial workstations to offer a complete hardware/software package and a GUI. Although the company achieved some commercial success, it never achieved the fame of either the Apple Macintosh or Microsoft Windows. History David Liddle and Donald Massaro founded Metaphor in 1982 after leaving Xerox PARC. By 1987, the company had an annual revenue of $39.7 million. In 1991, IBM, one of its primary customers, acquired the company outright. Product overview =Hardware= The Metaphor workstation had a wireless keyboard, wireless mouse, wireless numeric pad, and a wireless 5-function keypad. All these input devices docked in the desktop workstation where they were recharged. Objects on the desktop and open applications had a uniform command set that could be controlled by the keypad which had Copy, Move, Delete, Options, and Size. Workstations were connected with Ethernet. The industrial design of the workstation was done by Mike Nutall of Matrix Product Design. It won a gold medal from the IDSA. The workstation itself was engineered by James Yurchenco at David Kelley Design. Both Matrix and David Kelley Design were precursors of IDEO. Two different workstations models were produced. Workstation One had an external electronics enclosure. Workstation Two had integrated electronics. A Workstation Three, which included a color screen, was designed through final prototypes, but was never taken into production. =GUI Origins= Xerox PARC in 1973 began development of the Alto, widely shown in 1979. The Alto was the first computer with a bitmap display, mouse and a desktop metaphor as a graphical user interface (GUI). Xerox commercialized it as the Xerox Star. =DIS= The Metaphor GUI provided a unique visualization of end-to-end elements in an enterprise. In total, Metaphor branded this as a Data Interpretation System (DIS), which is a class of Decision Support System (DSS) The DIS software was designed to show in one workflow, the access of data from SQL databases, its analysis and then its presentation. This was accomplish by using graphically iconic applications for database gateway, spreadsheet, plot, email, and printing tools all connected by arrows. These were animated when the workflow ran. The workflow collection was called a Capsule. =Capsule= The heart of the Metaphor DIS system was the Capsule. Basically, a capsule was a simplified BATCH program. Because Metaphor applications were built so they communicated with each other, they could be moved into a folder and automated in a \\"Capsule\\". (The name was taken from the manned space capsules of the time.) The functionality of the Word Processor, Spreadsheet, and Data Retrieval tools were no better than their Microsoft Office counterparts (in fact, they had a smaller sub-set of features than Office). The primary advantage of Metaphor's system was the degree to which applications were linked together. Complex reiterative data-retrieval jobs were able to be created on-the-fly by a user with no programming knowledge. A user could visually drag fields from multiple databases into the Data Retrieval tool (which would generate its own SQL code based on the fields, links and criteria displayed) and send the output directly into a spreadsheet for sorting, calculations, and graphs. The report could then be sent into a pre-formatted Word Processing document, sent to the printer, and even e-mailed to a pre-designated distribution list. The whole process would repeat for each SKU, Region, Price Code, etc. without any human interaction. Even in today's GUI designs, this abstract conception of the desktop has never been attempted because it requires the interoperation of every application, a uniform dataflow model, and a communication protocol usable by a supervisor in a programmatic way. =Meta5= In March 2000, IBM licensed the Metaphor IBM Intelligent Decision Server (IDS) technology to Relational Development Systems (RDS), which was renamed Meta5. Patriot Partners Metaphor and IBM created a venture called Patriot Partners in 1990. The attempt was to create an organization that could produce a solid business line of object-oriented software. Rather than capitalize the venture, IBM purchased the Metaphor software division in 1991 and operated it as a wholly owned, independent subsidiary, and the hardware and field repair division was spun off into its own company, Sequence Support Services. In May 1992, Sequence Support Services ceased operations. In October 1994, Metaphor ceased operations. References Further reading * Available for download at Internet Archive.

It formed on July 31 and reached tropical storm status the following day east of the Leeward Islands. Dean brushed the northern Leeward Islands as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale, bringing light rain but producing no damage, before turning northward and striking Bermuda as a Category 2 hurricane. It continued northward before making landfall in southeastern Newfoundland. Dean was initially difficult to forecast; it was thought to pose a possible threat to the Lesser Antilles, and as a result several evacuations occurred, and many hurricane watches and warnings were issued. However, as the storm turned northward, all watches and warnings in the Lesser Antilles were discontinued. As Dean approached Bermuda, a hurricane watch was issued, and was later upgraded to a hurricane warning. After the storm tracked away from the island, the hurricane warning was discontinued. In addition, a hurricane warning was briefly in effect for Sable Island, Nova Scotia. The storm left $8.9 million (1989 USD, $ USD) and sixteen injuries across Bermuda, but no fatalities were reported. In Atlantic Canada, Dean dropped light rain across Nova Scotia and Sable Island. Meteorological history A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on July 27, as detected by Meteosat imagery. By July 31 the tropical wave began to be classified, using the Dvorak Technique, by satellite analysts at the National Hurricane Center, in part due to persistent deep convection. Shortly thereafter, the system became organized enough that the National Hurricane Center began classifying it as Tropical Depression Five, roughly halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles. The depression moved westward at 17 mph (28 km/h), intensifying as it did so, and eventually intensified enough to be upgraded to a tropical storm, which was named Dean by the National Hurricane Center. Continuing generally westward, Dean continued to gradually intensify, and became a hurricane on August 2 after an Air Force reconnaissance flight had recorded hurricane-force winds. The following day a decreasing ridge of high pressure to the north and a trough of low pressure forming off the East Coast of the United States caused the storm to slow in its forward motion and turn northwest. The trough of low pressure forming off the East Coast of the United States was deepening, causing Dean to curve northward while remaining nearly stationary. The storm then began to accelerate to a forward speed of 17 mph (28 km/h) as it headed toward Bermuda. Thereafter, Dean intensified into a Category 2 hurricane, whilst the eastern half of the eyewall brushed Bermuda. Dean continued to intensify slightly after passing the island of Bermuda and became a Category 2 hurricane on August 7. While Dean was a Category 2 hurricane, it attained its peak intensity with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 968 mbar (hPa; 28.59 inHg). After peak intensity, the forward speed of the storm continued to increase as it approached Atlantic Canada while weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane. While approaching southern Newfoundland, Dean had weakened enough to be downgraded to a tropical storm on August 8. Shortly thereafter it made landfall on the south coast of Newfoundland with winds of 65 mph (105 km/h). Later that day Dean emerged into the far north Atlantic, and rapidly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on the following day. Preparations Depiction of Hurricane Dean on a weather map on August 5 at 0600 UTC Hurricane Dean was very difficult to forecast in its early stages as the storm approached the eastern Caribbean. Even though most forecast models predicted that Dean would skirt the Leeward Islands, the track prediction models were not consistent and, as a result, uncertainty existed in justifying the posting of watches and warnings for the Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico. One track predicted Dean to threaten South Florida within three to four days. Regardless, the National Hurricane Center issued hurricane warnings for Guadeloupe on August 2 and the rest of the Leeward Islands extending to the Virgin Islands. The uncertainty of the hurricane's forecast track forced residents and tourists in the Lesser Antilles to evacuate. In the British Virgin Islands, 80 American and Canadian tourists evacuated to hotels. In Puerto Rico, residents were advised to secure or stow away loose objects and stock up on emergency supplies. 1.1 million residents in the city of San Juan went to supermarkets to get much-needed supplies in anticipation that the storm might hit Puerto Rico. In Humacao, the National Guard evacuated 1,966 people living along a coastal highway. The islands of Martinique and Dominica were placed under a hurricane watch. The warning for Guadeloupe was discontinued at 2200 UTC when the hurricane no longer posed any threat to the island. Simultaneously, the hurricane watches in effect for Martinique and Dominica were also discontinued. As Dean continued westward, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for the Turks and Caicos Islands. The watch was soon canceled as Dean made its northward turn towards Bermuda. In Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch on August 5. The hurricane watch was later changed to a hurricane warning the following day. Dean‚Äôs approach to the island canceled numerous inbound and outbound flights. In Atlantic Canada, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for Nova Scotia and Sable Island, while the Canadian forecasters issued a high wind advisory. Impact Hurricane Dean on August 3, 1989, north of the Virgin Islands The outer bands of Hurricane Dean produced heavy rainfall and winds up to 75 mph (121 km/h) across Antigua and Barbuda. There was no reported damage in the Leeward Islands or the Virgin Islands since the hurricane turned northward. In the Atlantic, a sailboat bound for Bermuda was caught off guard by the hurricane. The boat, which carried no radio equipment, was spotted by a hurricane hunter plane. The occupants of the boat suffered no injuries. In Bermuda, the hurricane's eastern eyewall produced 81 mph (130 km/h) sustained winds with gusts up to 113 mph (182 km/h). Bermuda's highest rainfall total from Dean was 2.45 in (50.8 mm) while parts of the island received 3-5 in (76.2‚Äì127 mm) of rain. Strong winds from Hurricane Dean caused considerable power line damage, leaving 65,000 residents without electricity. The winds also caused minor roof damage. In Hamilton Harbor, 20 pleasure boats were damaged or sent adrift due to the rough seas. Flooding from the hurricane damaged fifteen houses. Sixteen people were injured by the hurricane, five of the injuries were considered serious. There were, however, no reports of fatalities from Dean's impact on Bermuda. Damage in Bermuda amounted up to $8.9 million (1989 USD, $ USD). Although Dean remained away from the United States coastline, it produced storm tides of 1.7 ft (0.51 m) to North Carolina. In Atlantic Canada, hurricane-force winds were reported in Nova Scotia and Sable Island. Newfoundland reported winds of only 50 mph (80 km/h). Moderate rainfall was reported on Newfoundland, with most areas of the island experiencing at least 1 in (25.4 mm) of precipitation. Rainfall on Newfoundland peaked at 2.7 in (68.58 mm) on the south coast of the island, near the location of Dean's landfall. A majority of rainfall was reported on the west side of Dean, but minimal precipitation had been recorded to the east of the storm. High winds were reported on the eastern side of the storm, however, with lighter winds along the western quadrants of Dean. Offshore, waves up to 26 ft (7.92 m) were reported and Sable Island reported rainfall of 0.59 in (15 mm). Although there were no reports of damage in Atlantic Canada from Hurricane Dean, three sailors had to be rescued by the Canadian Coast Guard when their boat got dismasted during the storm.

It has been providing insurance products for more than 70 years and now provides cover solely via Lloyd's Syndicate 218. ERS offers a diverse range of products, including private car, classic car, van, motorcycle, taxi, minibus, fleet, haulage, agricultural vehicle and motor breakdown. History ERS began life in 1946 as Equity Motor Policies, a Lloyd's syndicate. In 1987 the company merged with Red Star to form Equity Red Star. Nine years later the company was bought by Cox Insurance, a Lloyd's underwriting business specialising in nuclear, marine and catastrophe insurance. In 2002, following losses incurred due to 9/11, Cox Insurance withdrew from its commercial insurance activity to focus on personal lines. The business raised new equity capital to support its motor underwriting operation. A management buyout of the business in 2005 led to a new focus and a new name, Equity Insurance Group ‚Äì led by CEO, Neil Utley ‚Äì backed by investors Englefield and Duke Street Capital. It was headquartered at Brentwood, Essex. Further facilities are located in Colchester and Swansea. The group's high street broking network was rebranded, converging Bennetts, Insure-shop and JMW to become Equity Insurance Brokers. On 4 December 2006, Australian insurer Insurance Australia Group announced that it would acquire Equity Insurance Group for ¬£570 million and Open + Direct Insurance Services, the largest retail broking operation in Northern Ireland.. The acquisition was completed on 8 January 2007 and Neil Utley, then CEO, joined the executive team of IAG. IAG also acquired Barnett & Barnett in 2008, and went on to dispose of its branch-based broking in 2009. In May 2012, IAG announced a strategic review of its UK operations, selling Barnett & Barnett and the NBJ Broking arm. In April 2013 US Private Equity company Aquiline purchased Equity Insurance Group from IAG for ¬£80 million. This prompted a transformation programme which led to the sale of EDBL and its personal accident and household books to Canopius. In April 2014, Equity Insurance Group rebranded to ERS and became a \\"motor only, broker only\\" insurer. It now operates solely as an A+ rated Lloyd's syndicate 218.[1] In 2014 ERS underwent structural changes to drive further organisational efficiencies and implement steps to help the company achieve its goal of a 90% combined operational ratio. This involved consolidating ERS‚Äô offices into two locations (London and Swansea) and expanding both locations for growth. As a result, the Brentwood head office was closed with the majority of work that had been undertaken there split between London and Swansea. However servicing for ERS‚Äô direct classic car arm, RH Insurance, remains in Brentwood at an alternative site. Financial ;2014 ERS announced a full calendar year profit of ¬£8.3m, the first it has reported since 2009 and a ¬£28m improvement year on year. The combined ratio improved by 6.6% to 101% from the prior year, with improvements across all ratios but the majority of improvement coming from the loss ratio. Gross written premiums ¬£388m, down from ¬£406m. ERS has approved the closure of its 2012 year of account with a small profit, ¬£1.4m, 0.3% of capacity. This is the first year of account since 2007 to close with a profit and is an improvement on the forecast provided last year which was for a small loss of ¬£1.1m or 0.2% of capacity. The forecast released for the 2013 year of account remains a small loss of 0.9% of capacity with a forecast of ‚àí5.9% to +4.1%. This is an improvement on the forecast at the same point last year which was ‚àí7.3% to +2.7% and also an improvement on the Q3 2014 forecast. ;2015 The calendar year profit for 2015 was 6.0m and the combined ratio improved to 99.8% (2014: 101%) and is below 100% for the first time since 2009, with improvements across all ratios but the majority of improvement coming from the loss ratio. Gross written premiums ¬£394m, an increase of 2% from 2014. ERS has approved the closure of its 2013 year of account with a profit, ¬£10.7m, 2.4% of capacity, this is an improvement from a year ago which forecast 2013 as a small loss of 0.9% of capacity and a range of ‚àí5.9% to +4.1%. The current forecast released for the 2014 year of account remains a loss of 3.4% of capacity with a forecast of ‚àí8.4% to +1.6%.

It can be distinguished from all its congeners, with the exception of Kryptopterus cryptopterus, by the almost flat dorsal profile with no concavity behind the head. This species grows to a length of SL. Examples of this distinctively shaped, translucent fish used to be assigned to the long- established species K. cryptopterus but recent studies have shown several small but consistent differences which prompted the erection of this new species. It has been recorded in Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. K. geminus can be distinguished from this close relative by its narrower head, longer snout, longer anal fin and eyes located much more laterally.

He is best known for designing the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra. Biography Born in Glen Innes, New South Wales, Madigan studied architecture at Sydney Technical College from 1939 to 1941. He enlisted in the Royal Australian Navy in 1941,Madigan, Colin Frederick, WW2 Nominal Roll, Department of Veterans' Affairs. and was one of the few survivors of the sinking of the corvette HMAS Armidale off Timor in 1942. In 1951 Madigan, Maurice Edwards and Jack Torzillo formed the firm, \\"Edwards Madigan Torzillo and Partners\\", whose work was mostly on public projects such as public housing, public libraries, schools and offices. A notable building from this period was the Warringah Council Library at Dee Why, New South Wales, which was awarded the Sir John Sulman Medal for architecture in 1966. In 1968, they won the design competition for the National Gallery of Australia. Later, Madigan supervised construction of the High Court of Australia after its designer Christopher Kringas died in March 1975, just prior to the start of construction in April 1975. The unsuccessful design for the new Australian Parliament House in Canberra was one of the shortlisted finalists in the architectural design competition. He retired in 1989. Madigan also wrote a book on the sinking of HMAS Armidale in 1942, Armidale '42 : a survivor's account. In later years, Madigan vigorously opposed plans to build a new entrance to the National Gallery of Australia.

Bumble (Olivier B. Bommel in Dutch) series by Marten Toonder. The character and his eccentric language debuted in 1947.  Frequent catchphrases by professor Prlwytzkofsky  The Professor uses several well-known catchphrases: * \\"Praw!\\": used at the beginning of exclamations. Something has gone wrong and the Professor expresses his dismay. The word is probably derived from Slavic \\"prav\\" (=that is right, you are right), since it replaces the normal Dutch \\"waarachtig\\" (which literally means truly). * \\"Der naam is Prlwytzkofsky. Met ener z in der midden. Der goede dag.\\" Translation: \\"The name is Prlwytzkofsky. With a z in the middle. The good day.\\" (alternative second sentence: \\"Met ener y an der enden.\\", \\"With a y at the end\\"). This is his usual greeting, even when meeting people he knows very well. * \\"Gans (on)wetenschappelijk!\\" meaning \\"completely (un)scientific\\". Example: the professor routinely calls his scientific colleague Sickbock \\"gans onwetenschappelijker kwak\\".  Distinctive characteristics of the Prlwytzkofsky language  The language is characterised by an abundance of composite words built on the combination of words literally translated from German, but in a small number of cases including a Slavic word. Often, the particular combination in Dutch may create a hint or an echo of a totally unconnected word. For instance, \\"mislinger\\" (loser,failure, a person) combines the Dutch word mis (miss = wrong, failure) with the German word (ge)lingen (succeed) creating a word which hints at \\"slinger\\" (pendulum or festoon). The actual Dutch word is \\"mislukkeling\\". Professor Prlwytzkofsky calls disturbed brains \\"verhoornde hersenschors\\" - horned cerebral cortex. \\"Verhoornd\\" (horned) rhymes with \\"verstoord\\" (disturbed), which is the meaning here, but actually translates the German word for brain, which is \\"Gehirn\\". Without knowledge of the German word, one may be led to think that the phrase refers to the brains of a cuckold. A Slavic influence is obvious in Prlwytzkofsky calling his assistant Alexander Pieps (a mouse) \\"Irkoetsk\\" (\\"short-statured assistant, who always manages to do things in the wrong way\\", but of course also referring to the Siberian town). = Straight German Influence = Clearest examples of Germanization are: * the use of the German masculine gender article \\"Der\\" (but since all words not of the female sex but ending in a consonant or diphthong take \\"Der\\" as their article, this also hides a Slavic substratum and simplifies the Prlwytzkofsky gender system, compared to Dutch and German) * a limited number of isolated words like \\"gans\\" (whole), \\"tas\\" (cup), words with the -iker ending rather than the Dutch -icus. These words are actually in normal use in the variant of the Dutch language spoken in Flanders. * the order of auxiliary verbs in subordinate sentences is as in German = Germanisms = * \\"overhoofd\\" (Dutch actually uses the real German loanword √ºberhaupt) * \\"manschap\\" (team, troops, from German Mannschaft. Dutch only uses this word in the plural) * \\"kraftwagen\\" (=car) = Slavic linguistic influence = * \\"besjnemtsing\\" : a sexual insult, possibly hinting at \\"degermanization\\" and claimed to be Serbo-Croat in origin by the Haagsch Bommel Genootschap. * \\"proeksel\\" : sexual insult, meaning unknown but claimed to be Serbo-Croat. The word made it into the Dutch language and developed several meanings, from \\"wet snow\\" to \\"mashed and mixed-up food\\". * \\"frlwortzln\\" : verb, derogatory and possibly meaning to dismember by a process involving eradication, also claimed to be influenced by Serbo-Croat. = Miscellaneous influences = * \\"Minkukel\\": although not original Prlwytzkofsky language (it was coined by extraterrestrials in Tom Poes en het Kukel), the Professor is responsible for its present meaning in Dutch: a \\"person with a low IQ\\". Only after his own \\"kukel\\" is measured by the extraterrestrials and diagnosed as negative, does he start to protest it must mean something else. Only the whacky (but Taoist) goose Wammes Waggel has a \\"plus\\" kukel and Oliver Bommel's kukel registers as zero (higher than everybody else in Rommeldam, even Tom Poes, who all get negative scores), signifying \\"kukel\\" has nothing to do with intelligence, but rather with spontaneity and savoir-vivre. * \\"Kwak\\": English: quack. Although the normal Dutch word is \\"kwakzalver\\" and the German word is \\"Quacksalber\\", the Professor always uses the shorter form, which may indicate English influence. * contrary to practice in both Dutch and German, the perfect participle of a second, third ... auxiliary in a subordinated clause is never turned into an infinitive (this may be an influence of English, or of Romance languages)  External links  *\\"Keep thinking for yourself, also aloud!\\" *Three mysterious words only ring a bell at the Embassy of Yugoslavia (in Dutch) *Various personages in the Marten Toonder comic series(in Dutch) *The grammatical structure of Prlwytzkofsky(in Dutch)  See also  *Syldavian, another comic strip variant of the Dutch language Category:Fictional languages Category:Constructed languages introduced in the 1940s ","title":"Prlwytzkofsky"},{"id":"7740642","text":"David G.

The domains are the light and dark stripes visible within each grain. The outlined grain has its magnetocrystalline axis almost vertical, so the domains are seen end-on. A magnetic domain is a region within a magnetic material in which the magnetization is in a uniform direction. This means that the individual magnetic moments of the atoms are aligned with one another and they point in the same direction. When cooled below a temperature called the Curie temperature, the magnetization of a piece of ferromagnetic material spontaneously divides into many small regions called magnetic domains. The magnetization within each domain points in a uniform direction, but the magnetization of different domains may point in different directions. Magnetic domain structure is responsible for the magnetic behavior of ferromagnetic materials like iron, nickel, cobalt and their alloys, and ferrimagnetic materials like ferrite. This includes the formation of permanent magnets and the attraction of ferromagnetic materials to a magnetic field. The regions separating magnetic domains are called domain walls, where the magnetization rotates coherently from the direction in one domain to that in the next domain. The study of magnetic domains is called micromagnetics. Magnetic domains form in materials which have magnetic ordering; that is, their dipoles spontaneously align due to the exchange interaction. These are the ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials. Paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials, in which the dipoles align in response to an external field but do not spontaneously align, do not have magnetic domains.  Development of domain theory  Magnetic domain theory was developed by French physicist Pierre-Ernest Weiss, cited in who, in 1906, suggested existence of magnetic domains in ferromagnets.. He suggested that large number of atomic magnetic moments (typically 1012-1018) were aligned parallel. The direction of alignment varies from domain to domain in a more or less random manner, although certain crystallographic axis may be preferred by the magnetic moments, called easy axes. Weiss still had to explain the reason for the spontaneous alignment of atomic moments within a ferromagnetic material, and he came up with the so-called Weiss mean field. He assumed that a given magnetic moment in a material experienced a very high effective magnetic field due to the magnetization of its neighbors. In the original Weiss theory the mean field was proportional to the bulk magnetization M, so that H_e = \\\\alpha\\\\ M where \\\\alpha\\\\ is the mean field constant. However this is not applicable to ferromagnets due to the variation of magnetization from domain to domain. In this case, the interaction field is H_e = \\\\alpha\\\\ M_s Where M_s is the saturation magnetization at 0K. Later, the quantum theory made it possible to understand the microscopic origin of the Weiss field. The exchange interaction between localized spins favored a parallel (in ferromagnets) or an anti- parallel (in anti-ferromagnets) state of neighboring magnetic moments  Domain structure  How dividing a ferromagnetic material into magnetic domains reduces the magnetostatic energy = Why domains form = The reason a piece of magnetic material such as iron spontaneously divides into separate domains, rather than exist in a state with magnetization in the same direction throughout the material, is to minimize its internal energy. A large region of ferromagnetic material with a constant magnetization throughout will create a large magnetic field extending into the space outside itself (diagram a, right). This requires a lot of magnetostatic energy stored in the field. To reduce this energy, the sample can split into two domains, with the magnetization in opposite directions in each domain (diagram b right). The magnetic field lines pass in loops in opposite directions through each domain, reducing the field outside the material. To reduce the field energy further, each of these domains can split also, resulting in smaller parallel domains with magnetization in alternating directions, with smaller amounts of field outside the material. The domain structure of actual magnetic materials does not usually form by the process of large domains splitting into smaller ones as described here. When a sample is cooled below the Curie temperature, for example, the equilibrium domain configuration simply appears. But domains can split, and the description of domains splitting is often used to reveal the energy tradeoffs in domain formation. = Size of domains = As explained above, a domain which is too big is unstable, and will divide into smaller domains. But a small enough domain will be stable and will not split, and this determines the size of the domains created in a material. This size depends on the balance of several energies within the material. Each time a region of magnetization splits into two domains, it creates a domain wall between the domains, where magnetic dipoles (molecules) with magnetization pointing in different directions are adjacent. The exchange interaction which creates the magnetization is a force which tends to align nearby dipoles so they point in the same direction. Forcing adjacent dipoles to point in different directions requires energy. Therefore, a domain wall requires extra energy, called the domain wall energy, which is proportional to the area of the wall. Thus the net amount that the energy is reduced when a domain splits is equal to the difference between the magnetic field energy saved, and the additional energy required to create the domain wall. The field energy is proportional to the cube of the domain size, while the domain wall energy is proportional to the square of the domain size. So as the domains get smaller, the net energy saved by splitting decreases. The domains keep dividing into smaller domains until the energy cost of creating an additional domain wall is just equal to the field energy saved. Then the domains of this size are stable. In most materials the domains are microscopic in size, around 10‚àí4 \\\\- 10‚àí6 m. = Magnetic anisotropy = Micrograph of surface of ferromagnetic material, showing the crystal grains, each divided into several domains parallel to its \\"easy\\" axis of magnetization, with the magnetization in alternating directions (red and green areas). Animation showing how magnetostriction works. A changing external magnetic field causes the magnetic dipoles to rotate, changing the dimensions of the crystal lattice. An additional way for the material to further reduce its magnetostatic energy is to form domains with magnetization at right angles to the other domains (diagram c, right), instead of just in opposing parallel directions. These domains, called flux closure domains, allow the field lines to turn 180¬∞ within the material, forming closed loops entirely within the material, reducing the magnetostatic energy to zero. However, forming these domains incurs two additional energy costs. First, the crystal lattice of most magnetic materials has magnetic anisotropy, which means it has an \\"easy\\" direction of magnetization, parallel to one of the crystal axes. Changing the magnetization of the material to any other direction takes additional energy, called the \\"magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy\\". = Magnetostriction = The other energy cost to creating domains with magnetization at an angle to the \\"easy\\" direction is caused by the phenomenon called magnetostriction. When the magnetization of a piece of magnetic material is changed to a different direction, it causes a slight change in its shape. The change in magnetic field causes the magnetic dipole molecules to change shape slightly, making the crystal lattice longer in one dimension and shorter in other dimensions. However, since the magnetic domain is \\"squished in\\" with its boundaries held rigid by the surrounding material, it cannot actually change shape. So instead, changing the direction of the magnetization induces tiny mechanical stresses in the material, requiring more energy to create the domain. This is called \\"magnetoelastic anisotropy energy\\". To form these closure domains with \\"sideways\\" magnetization requires additional energy due to the aforementioned two factors. So flux closure domains will only form where the magnetostatic energy saved is greater than the sum of the \\"exchange energy\\" to create the domain wall, the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, and the magnetoelastic anisotropy energy. Therefore, most of the volume of the material is occupied by domains with magnetization either \\"up\\" or \\"down\\" along the \\"easy\\" direction, and the flux closure domains only form in small areas at the edges of the other domains where they are needed to provide a path for magnetic field lines to change direction (diagram c, above). = Grain structure = The above describes magnetic domain structure in a perfect crystal lattice, such as would be found in a single crystal of iron. However most magnetic materials are polycrystalline, composed of microscopic crystalline grains. These grains are not the same as domains. Each grain is a little crystal, with the crystal lattices of separate grains oriented in random directions. In most materials, each grain is big enough to contain several domains. Each crystal has an \\"easy\\" axis of magnetization, and is divided into domains with the axis of magnetization parallel to this axis, in alternate directions. = \\"Magnetized\\" states = It can be seen that, although on a microscopic scale almost all the magnetic dipoles in a piece of ferromagnetic material are lined up parallel to their neighbors in domains, creating strong local magnetic fields, energy minimization results in a domain structure that minimizes the large-scale magnetic field. In its lowest energy state, the magnetization of neighboring domains point in different directions, confining the field lines to microscopic loops between neighboring domains within the material, so the combined fields cancel at a distance. Therefore, a bulk piece of ferromagnetic material in its lowest energy state has little or no external magnetic field. The material is said to be \\"unmagnetized\\". However, the domains can also exist in other configurations in which their magnetization mostly points in the same direction, creating an external magnetic field. Although these are not minimum energy configurations, due to a phenomenon where the domain walls become \\"pinned\\" to defects in the crystal lattice they can be local minimums of the energy, and therefore can be very stable. Applying an external magnetic field to the material can make the domain walls move, causing the domains aligned with the field to grow, and the opposing domains to shrink. When the external field is removed, the domain walls remain pinned in their new orientation and the aligned domains produce a magnetic field. This is what happens when a piece of ferromagnetic material is \\"magnetized\\" and becomes a permanent magnet. Heating a magnet, subjecting it to vibration by hammering it, or applying a rapidly oscillating magnetic field from a degaussing coil, tends to pull the domain walls free from their pinned states, and they will return to a lower energy configuration with less external magnetic field, thus \\"demagnetizing\\" the material.  Landau-Lifshitz energy equation  Electromagnetic dynamic magnetic domain motion of grain oriented electrical silicon steel Moving domain walls in a grain of silicon steel caused by an increasing external magnetic field in the \\"downward\\" direction, observed in a Kerr microscope. White areas are domains with magnetization directed up, dark areas are domains with magnetization directed down. The contributions of the different internal energy factors described above is expressed by the free energy equation proposed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz in 1935, which forms the basis of the modern theory of magnetic domains. The domain structure of a material is the one which minimizes the Gibbs free energy of the material. For a crystal of magnetic material, this is the Landau-Lifshitz free energy, E, which is the sum of these energy terms:Carey R., Isaac E.D., Magnetic domains and techniques for their observation, The English University Press Ltd, London, (1966). :E = E_{ex} + E_D + E_{\\\\lambda} + E_k + E_H\\\\, where *Eex is exchange energy: This is the energy due to the exchange interaction between magnetic dipole molecules in ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials. It is lowest when the dipoles are all pointed in the same direction, so it is responsible for magnetization of magnetic materials. When two domains with different directions of magnetization are next to each other, at the domain wall between them magnetic dipoles pointed in different directions lie next to each other, increasing this energy. This additional exchange energy is proportional to the total area of the domain walls. *ED is magnetostatic energy: This is a self-energy, due to the interaction of the magnetic field created by the magnetization in some part of the sample on other parts of the same sample. It is dependent on the volume occupied by the magnetic field extending outside the domain. This energy is reduced by minimizing the length of the loops of magnetic field lines outside the domain. For example, this tends to encourage the magnetization to be parallel to the surfaces of the sample, so the field lines won't pass outside the sample. Reducing this energy is the main reason for the creation of magnetic domains. *EŒª is magnetoelastic anisotropy energy: This energy is due to the effect of magnetostriction, a slight change in the dimensions of the crystal when magnetized. This causes elastic strains in the lattice, and the direction of magnetization that minimizes these strain energies will be favored. This energy tends to be minimized when the axis of magnetization of the domains in a crystal are all parallel. *Ek is magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy: Due to its magnetic anisotropy, the crystal lattice is \\"easy\\" to magnetize in one direction, and \\"hard\\" to magnetize in others. This energy is minimized when the magnetization is along the \\"easy\\" crystal axis, so the magnetization of most of the domains in a crystal grain tend to be in either direction along the \\"easy\\" axis. Since the crystal lattice in separate grains of the material is usually oriented in different random directions, this causes the dominant domain magnetization in different grains to be pointed in different directions. *EH is Zeeman energy: This is energy which is added to or subtracted from the magnetostatic energy, due to the interaction between the magnetic material and an externally applied magnetic field. It is proportional to the negative of the cosine of the angle between the field and magnetization vectors. Domains with their magnetic field oriented parallel to the applied field reduce this energy, while domains with their magnetic field oriented opposite to the applied field increase this energy. So applying a magnetic field to a ferromagnetic material generally causes the domain walls to move so as to increase the size of domains lying mostly parallel to the field, at the cost of decreasing the size of domains opposing the field. This is what happens when ferromagnetic materials are \\"magnetized\\". With a strong enough external field, the domains opposing the field will be swallowed up and disappear; this is called saturation. Some sources define a wall energy EW equal to the sum of the exchange energy and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, which replaces Eex and Ek in the above equation. A stable domain structure is a magnetization function M(x), considered as a continuous vector field, which minimizes the total energy E throughout the material. To find the minimums a variational method is used, resulting in a set of nonlinear differential equations, called Brown's equations after William Fuller Brown Jr. Although in principle these equations can be solved for the stable domain configurations M(x), in practice only the simplest examples can be solved. Analytic solutions do not exist, and numerical solutions calculated by the finite element method are computationally intractable because of the large difference in scale between the domain size and the wall size. Therefore, micromagnetics has evolved approximate methods which assume that the magnetization of dipoles in the bulk of the domain, away from the wall, all point in the same direction, and numerical solutions are only used near the domain wall, where the magnetization is changing rapidly. Rotation of orientation and increase in size of magnetic domains in response to an externally applied field.  Domain imaging techniques  There are a number of microscopy methods that can be used to visualize the magnetization at the surface of a magnetic material, revealing the magnetic domains. Each method has a different application because not all domains are the same. In magnetic materials, domains can be circular, square, irregular, elongated, and striped, all of which have varied sizes and dimensions. = Magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) = Large domains, within the range of 25-100 micrometers can be easily seen by Kerr microscopy, which uses the magneto-optic Kerr effect, which is the rotation of the polarization of light reflected from a magnetized surface. = Lorentz microscopy = Lorentz microscopy is a transmission electron microscopy technique used to study magnetic domain structures at very high resolution. Off-axis electron holography is a related technique used to observe magnetic structures by detecting nanoscale magnetic fields. = Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) = Another technique for viewing sub- microscopic domain structures down to a scale of a few nanometers is magnetic force microscopy. MFM is a form of atomic force microscopy that uses a magnetically coated probe tip to scan the sample surface. = Bitter method = Bitter patterns are a technique for imaging magnetic domains that were first observed by Francis Bitter.A Dictionary of Physics. Oxford University Press, 2009. The technique involves placing a small quantity of ferrofluid on the surface of a ferromagnetic material. The ferrofluid arranges itself along magnetic domain walls, which have higher magnetic flux than the regions of the material located within domains. A modified Bitter technique has been incorporated into a widely used device, the Large Area Domain Viewer, which is particularly useful in the examination of grain-oriented silicon steels.R. J.

He is most famous for his co-ownership of two time NASCAR championship team Holman Moody with Ralph Moody. Early career He was born in Nashville, Tennessee. After the start of World War II, Holman began a career as a tool and die maker and as a shipyard worker. After the war, he became a trucker. He assembled a Mack truck between shipments. He was hired in 1952 by Clay Smith and Bill Stroppe to drive their parts truck to each leg of the 1952 Mexican Road Race, and to stay ahead of the racing team. The team won the race, and they hired Holman as a full-time mechanic and parts man after the race to work in their Long Beach, California shop. Smith was killed in a racing accident at DuQuoin, Illinois in 1954, and Stroppe took over. Holman continued to work for him until 1956. Holman was hired by Ford Motor Company to run their factory shop in Charlotte. Holman-Moody Ralph Moody was the mechanic, manager, and star driver of 1925 Indianapolis 500 winner Pete DePaolo's Ford factory- sponsored stockcar racing facility in Charlotte, North Carolina. The drivers formed a partnership after the American Manufacturers' Association banned Ford's factory partication in stockcar racing in June 1957. The move unemployed both men. They decided to pool their resources, and formed Holman- Moody. The team became one of the winningest teams in NASCAR history, after racking up 92 wins and two championships before Moody sold his interests to Holman. Ironically, Holman-Moody invested in the Bill Stroppe organization in 1965 and the Long Beach facility at 2190 Temple Ave. became Holman-Moody- Stroppe.

There are also a significant number of Jewish people with the surname, and it is said that this name originated from a house sign in the Frankfurt am Main (Judengasse) picturing a mirror. The form Spiegel is documented in Frankfurt am Main since the 16th century. Variants are Szpiegel, Schpiegel, Shpi(e)gel, ≈ûpighel, etc. Family lore, as told by the family of Joseph Spiegel scion of the Spiegel Family of catalogue fame, says that the family name in Germany had been Meyer. Big Meyer, bought a large mirror for the house. When he got it home, it was too big to fit. So, it was leaned against a nearby tree. When people came into the valley, the sun reflected off the mirror. The house became known as the Spiegel house. The family adopted the name.

Reception Bloody Disgusting rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, \\"But even as the premise of The Plague continues to titillate and intrigue, the film can‚Äôt quite deliver on its promise, rendering it slightly entertaining and ultimately forgettable.\\" Steve Barton of Dread Central rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, \\"Clive Barker may have in some way produced this mess and lent his name to it, but rest assured there‚Äôs nothing Barker-esque about it. All that's here is a giant missed opportunity which ‚Äî pardon the really bad, yet fitting pun ‚Äî you should avoid like the plague.\\" Scott Weinberg of DVD Talk rated it 2.5/5 stars and wrote that it does not live up the premise, instead \\"devolving into yet another (and very stale) zombie-type chase thriller\\". David Johnson of DVD Verdict wrote, \\"The Plague is an inscrutable movie that starts out strong, but loses forward momentum, eventually grinding to an awkward halt.\\" See also  * Village of the Damned (1960 film) (similar plot) References External links  * Category:2006 films Category:2006 horror films Category:American films Category:American science fiction horror films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in 1983 Category:Films set in 1993 Category:Films set in New Hampshire ","title":"The Plague (2006 film)"},{"id":"7740775","text":"\\"If You Want To Sing Out, Sing Out\\" is a popular song by Cat Stevens.

The Highlands Natural Pool is in Ringwood, New Jersey, United States. This swimming pool is located in the Wyanokie Highlands adjacent to the Norvin Green State Forest. The pool is a stream-fed non-chemically-treated swimming pond with stone retaining walls and a safe children‚Äôs area. Annual memberships and daily visitors passes are available to the general public.  History  In 1921, Camp Midvale was founded as a haven for working people seeking refuge, recreation, community, and nature by a group of outdoor enthusiasts called the Nature Friends (Naturfreunde). In 1935, Nature Friends volunteers carved the present swimming pool out of the hillside by hand. In 1974, the Metropolitan Recreation Association, a successor group of the Nature Friends, donated the Camp Midvale property to the Ethical Culture Society, because they were unable to financially maintain it, and most of the wooded area of over was placed under the New Jersey Green Acres program, to be preserved from development in perpetuity. Ethical Culture members Walter and May Weis endowed money to the remaining developed part of the property in order to realize their dream of preserving land for the purpose of environmental education. Thus the Weis Ecology Center (WEC), a private, non-profit organization, was created to offer the public a unique opportunity to learn about the Northern New Jersey Highlands Region. The WEC was then taken over by the New Jersey Audubon Society who closed the pool in 1994. In 1995, New Jersey Audubon agreed to allow the community to open the pool and in 1996, The Community Association of the Highlands incorporated, reopening the site as the Highlands Natural Pool. In 1998, NJAS/WEC formally donated the pool to the community.

It was a US$18 million bribery scandal that implicated some of the country's leading politicians. The case In 1991, an arrest linked to militants in Kashmir led to a raid on hawala brokers, revealing evidence of large-scale payments to national politicians. On 25 March 1991, as per the court proceedings published by the Supreme court of India, Ashfak Hussain Lone, a person alleged to be an official of the terrorist organisation Hizbul Mujahideen, was arrested in Delhi. During his interrogation, the police learnt that his organisation was funded through hawala, using Surendra Kumar Jain and his family as a conduit. Based on this and further information received during Lone's interrogation, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) conducted raids on the premises of Surrender Kumar Jain, his brothers, relations and businesses. During the raids, the CBI seized Indian and foreign currency, two diaries and two note books at the premises. These diaries contained detailed accounts of vast payments made to people identified only by initials. The initials corresponded to the initials of high ranking politicians, both in power and out of power, and of high ranking bureaucrats. At this stage, the investigation stopped at the CBI and neither the Jain's, nor the contents of their diaries were investigated by the CBI. Meanwhile, officers of the CBI involved in the investigation were transferred out to other places by orders from ruling politicians. However, the case continued to make headlines in the newspapers media, as it was pursued by a few journalists. On 4 October 1993, writ petitions were filed at the Supreme court of India, in the public interest under Article 32 of the Constitution of the India. These contained allegations that Government agencies like the CBI and the revenue authorities had failed to perform their duties and legal obligations as they had \\"failed to investigate matters arising out of the seizure of the \\"Jain diaries\\"; that the apprehension of terrorists had led to the discovery of financial support to them by clandestine and illegal means using tainted funds obtained through \`hawala' transactions; that this had also disclosed a nexus between politicians, bureaucrats and criminals, who were recipients of money from unlawful sources, given for unlawful consideration that the CBI and other Government agencies had failed to investigate the matter, take it to its logical conclusion and prosecute all persons who were found to have committed an offence; that this was done with a view to protect the persons involved, who were very influential and powerful; that the matter disclosed a nexus between crime and corruption at high places in public life and it posed a serious threat to the integrity, security and economy of the nation; that probity in public life, the rule of law and the preservation of democracy required that the Government agencies compelled to duly perform their legal obligations and to proceed in accordance with law against every person involved, irrespective of where he was placed in the political hierarchy.\\" In India, the Hawala method is an illegal method of transacting in foreign currency. It is illegal and contentious due to two reasons. Firstly, it is highly secretive as it does not reveal the identity of people on either side of the transaction, even to the hawala operators. Secondly, it violates the FERA regulations of India as it does not use approved channels of regular banks for foreign currency transactions. However, it is often used in India for two reasons. Firstly, to transfer legally earned salaries (example : by ordinary workers overseas in Saudi Arabia and UAE) to their hometowns, as hawala transaction costs are a fraction of banks, and hawala operators can be found in the smallest villages of India. Secondly, by politicians, bureaucrats and nefarious elements to transfer corruption money. Discovery of involvement of politicians in hawala Those accused included L. K. Advani https://www.indianmirror.com/indian-industries/indian-scams/hawalascam.html, V. C. Shukla, Devi Lal, Sharad Yadav, Balram Jakhar, https://www.epw.in/journal/2016/47/web-exclusives/did-modi-receive- rs-55-crore-sahara-group-gujarat-cm.html and Madan Lal Khurana. The list contained politicians from multiple political parties including BJP, INC, SJP and Janata Dal, and one independent, with amounts varying between Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 7.5 crore. The prosecution that followed was partly prompted by a public interest petition (see Vineet Narain), and yet the court cases of the Hawala scandal eventually all collapsed without convictions. Many were acquitted in 1997 and 1998, partly because the hawala records (including diaries) were judged in court to be inadequate as the main evidence. The Central Bureau of Investigation's role was criticized. In concluding the Vineet Narain case, the Supreme Court of India directed that the Central Vigilance Commission should be given a supervisory role over the CBI. L. K. Advani resigned because of this scandal. Later in June, 2015 he said, \\"I quit over Hawala because I listened to my conscience\\"https://www.huffingtonpost.in/2015/06/28/lk-advani_n_7680330.html. This statement was seen as a \\"veiled message\\"https://www.ndtv.com/india- news/need-to-maintain-probity-in-public-life-i-resigned-after-hawala-scam- says-lk-advani-775977 to Modi government that his leaders also should take moral responsibility and resign over Modigate scandal. Supreme court judgment The supreme court proceeding did not relate to the hawala case per se, but rather to the suspicious transfer of the CBI Director Joginder Singh and the rampant misuse of political power to curb the investigations of the CBI and Revenue department. In its judgment, delivered on 18 December 1997, the court, through judges S.P.Bharucha and S.C.Sen gave a ruling consisting of a 26 points list of pronouncements, the most important of which made it impossible for politicians in the government to remove the Director of the CBI for 2 years, thus ensuring that the CBI and its officers would have freedom to carry out their work without political interference.

He served as Rajmantri Dangaria, the chief courcellor, for more than seventeen years, from January 1662 to March 1679. During this period Assam witnessed Mughal invasions first under Mir Jumla and later during the Battle of Saraighat against Ram Singh. During the internal disruptions that followed he played a prominent part upholding state rule but was ultimately assassinated by his adversaries. He is best known for his foresight, judgement and patriotism; and for refusing to accept the crown twice when it was offered to him. According to the Buranjis, the Burhagohain was tall in stature and his strides resembled that of a goose. His face was broad, and he had two moles on the forehead. He was ruddy in complexion. He wore a buffalo-coloured gati or a cloth tightly wrapped round the body with two ends made into a knot near the waist and he carried a big hengdang or sword. Since he belonged to the Bahgaria clan, he is generally referred to as Bahgaria Atan Burhagohain. Appointment He was appointed as the Burhagohain in January 1662, at the time Garhgaon was occupied by Mir Jumla. He oversaw the military resistance to the Mughal general, negotiated the Treaty of Ghilajharighat, planned the rejuvenation of the Ahom kingdom and was one of the architects of the Ahom victory at the Battle of Saraighat. He was known for his military tactics of guerrilla warfare that came to be known as daga juddha, and also for his statesmanship and wise counsel. He was appointed the Rajmantri Dangaria (Prime Minister) by the Ahom king Chakradhwaj Singha, and in the turmoil following the excesses of Debera Borbarua, he was offered the Ahom throne itself, which he refused. Despite his wisdom and keen political sense, he was unable to see through the treachery of Laluk Sola Borphukan, and was murdered by the Borphukan's henchmen in 1679. Works =Military= Atan Burhagohain was one of the key people in the victory of the Assamese in the Battle of Saraighat. The Prime Minister was personally in charge of the command of the northern division of the Ahom army on the north bank of Guwahati. His camp was situated at Lathia Parvat, and he had with him 80 chor-bachas or commando soldiers in his Pali (meaning a unit of command under a commander in Assamese). From his base at Lathia fort, he initiated a campaign of guerrilla attacks on the Mughals, employing many well known commandos: Lai, Lechai, Chili, Mabi, Mari, Achor, Tunai, Baduli, and other spies who entered the enemy's camps at night and removed their treasures, money and disabled their arms. Atan Burhagohain was also a highly skilled military engineer and after the occupation of Gauhati, he was directed by the King to oversee the construction of the necessary fortifications on both banks of Brahmaputra. Before the final Saraighat battle, on seeing the fortification and preparation of the Ahom army, Raja Ram Singha commented to his lieutenant Rashid Khan: : \\"Forts have been constructed by the Ahoms on tops of hills, and the outlying plains are also too narrow for the purpose of an open engagement. It is for this reason that the Assamese had proved invincible in their wars against foreigners. The fortifications are intricate and complex, and to each fort there are three passages. The enemy is beyond the reach of our heavy artillery; and there is no opportunity for fighting with arrows and guns. Their ministers, commanders and infantry are all to be admired for having constructed such an impregnable wall of defence.\\" This conversation was communicated to the Ahoms by a traveller named Hangalbhanga Laskar. On hearing this, the Premier Atan Burhagohain promulgated this message to the army: : \\"You are to note carefully that at the sight of our fortifications demoralisation has already started in the enemy's camp. His enthusiasm is already on the wane. The Barphukan should only remain inviolate in his command, and we shall fight to the last drop of our blood.\\" =Statesmanship= Atan Burhagohain was not only a highly trained soldier, he was also an able administrator and astute statesman. Immediately upon ascending the throne, King Chakradhwaj Singha was impatient and contemplated immediate attack on the Mughal forces. He pleaded with the King that such attack would be suicidal, that first they should properly train the army, build the armory, stock food provisions and other war material, as the hostilities may continue for a number of years. He addressed the king and his councillors on this occasion: : \\"It is the legitimate duty of a sovereign to restore the old limits of his dominions by defeating and destroying his enemies. His success in war can alone enhance his glory and renown. So, His Majesty's proposal is just and proper. We have been enjoying absolute and uninterrupted sovereignty from time immemorial, and the high-handed imperiousness of the Mughals has transcended the limits of our forbearance. His Majesty has only voiced the sentiments of his ministers when he declares that we should fall upon the Mughals this very moment if possible. But we must provide the army with sufficient quantity of food provisions and war materials, and must hold in stock sufficient reserve to enable us to replenish the stores of the expeditionary army as soon as they become empty. This task of supplying reinforcements will become a matter of frequent occurrence.\\" : \\"The country has become depopulated owing to the flight of the villagers from their homes during the last war with Mir Jumla. His Majesty has recently procured their return to their country and settled them in different places. We shall have to enquire whether these people have been able to obtain rice and food.\\"Bhuyan, S.K. (1957). Atan Burhagohain and his times, p.p.49,50 He said, ‚Äúsakalo dravyat thaki chaul kotha he prodhan‚Äù (\\"rice is the most indispensable and important of all the items\\"). Long before Napoleon stated that \\"an Army marches on its stomach\\" Atan Burhagohain had realised this and convinced his king to make necessary preparations. Atan Burhagohain further pleaded, : \\"A kari paik or a humble subject of Your Majesty buys an earthen pot to boil his course rice for trifling sum of two couries. Lest the rice and the pot, the total value of which will not, in any case, exceed twenty couries or one pice, be spoiled, he tests the soundness of the vessel by striking it with the fingers at the bottom and the sides two or three times before making the purchase. A bird erects a nest on high where she hatches to life her young ones. She takes them round from one bough to another after they have grown up a bit. They are brought down to the ground when they can fly. If they are let loose before they become full fledged they are eaten up by dogs and jackals. The mother-bird leaves them only after they can pick up and eat their food themselves.\\" Atan Burhagohain also advised to have the boatsmen and oarsmen trained: : \\"Similarly, when the three batches of rowers, posted at the middle and the two extremities of Your Majesty's barge, strike their oars simultaneously, the sight becomes beautiful to look at, the oarsmen feel spirited, the boat moves swiftly, and the helmsman wields the steering with ease and comfort. But, if on the other hand, there is no harmony and synchronism in the strokes of the three batches of rowers, the helmsman is inconvenienced in steering his shaft, the boat does not make any headway, and the spectators are far from being delighted. If the king directs his measures on the lines indicated above, then only he will be able to vanquish his enemies and extend his territories to the old limits.\\" \\"Bhuyan, S.K. (1957). Atan Burhagohain and his times, p.p.50,51 The counsel of Prime Minister Atan Burhagohain roused the monarch to a consciousness of the realities of the situation, and extensive preparation was made for two years before the onslaught on the Mughals. After the reoccupation of Gauhati by the Ahoms, Atan Burhagohain was appointed by the king to erect the necessary fortifications on both banks of Brahmaputra, strengthen them, stock them with provisions and men. Lachit Borphukan was asked to post a contingent of soldiers at each strategic point under an able commander. Under the Premier's supervision, the civil administration of Kamrup was reorganised on sound footing, and Chaudhuris and Patwaries were appointed to realise the stipulated jaigiri-dhan or land revenue. The administration of the parganas of Kamrup was vested under various senior officers: Barphukan (Darang, Barbhag and Bangeswar), Paniphukan (Khata and Banbhag), Duara Phukan (Pubpar and Paschimpar), Deka Phukan (Sarubangsar and Kachari-mahal), Chetia Phukan (Ramsa and Sarukhetri), Dayangia Rajkhowa (Bar Khetri), Tar-Salagarua Rajkhowa (Barhanti), Dikhowmukhia Rajkhowa (Chamaria), Pani-Salaguria Rajkhowa (Nagarberha), Pani- Dihingia Rajkhowa (Bagaribari), Tarua-Dihingia Rajkhowa (Barpeta), Namdangia Rajkhowa (Barnagar), Pani-Abhoypuria Rajkhowa (Bajali), Bar-Abhoypuria Rajkhowa (Bekeli) and Saru-Abhoypuria Rajkhowa (Bausi). During the war, Raja Ram Singha asked his envoy Panditrai: : \\"Well, Panditrai during your visit to Barphukan's camp you must have formed some impression of the Ahom ministers and commanders. Please tell me what you have seen and what you think of them.\\" To this Panditrai replied, : \\"The Barpatra Gohain, the Burhagohain and the Barphukan have all impressed me as wonderfully capable commanders presenting a rare combination of beauty, accomplishment, valour and wisdom. As to Burhagohain he is young in years, fair and handsome in features, sober and deep in intelligence, dexterous in all matters, and he rivals all others in soundness of his counsel.\\" Ram Singha commented, \\"It is really wonderful that a man can be so intelligent at this tender age.\\" Panditrai added, \\"The Burhagohain is also an arch-diplomat.\\" Ram Singha concluded, \\"Who will be able to cope with such a minister when he comes to years? Pride should be the heritage of that land where such a counsellor has taken his birth.\\" Notes  Bibliography and references  * Bhuyan, S.K. (1957). Atan Burhagohain and his times.

This was not the first connection between the coal pits, at that time owned by the Marquess of Rockingham, and the canal, for in the middle years of the 18th century, a wagonway had been built to link the Bassingthorpe pits to the newly opened \\"Rotherham Cut\\" of the River Dun Navigation. The Greasbrough Canal, connecting to the navigation on the boundaries of Rotherham and Parkgate, was opened in 1780 to serve the Marquess's interests, and the wagonways from his coal pits at Bassingthorpe were diverted to the canal head. Two years later, the Marquess died, and the estate passed to his nephew, Earl Fitzwilliam. The Earl owned coal pits at High Stubbin and Swallow Wood, and these pits were, from the early 19th century, joined by a wagonway to the Greasbrough Canal. In 1839, the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway opened a branch from its main line at Holmes, which had been opened the previous year, to join with the Earl's railway at Parkgate. This line ran alongside the construction works of the North Midland Railway before joining the canal bank. This connection broke the near monopoly of the Duke of Norfolk's estate in supplying coal to the developing industries of the city and gave the Earl's coal a competitive edge in the marketplace. In 1840, the estate bought a six-coupled steam locomotive for use on the line, and to accommodate this, the wagonway was rebuilt. A connection was made from the North Midland Railway to the Earl's line, which rendered the branch from Holmes redundant. This connection was closed in 1977, a year before New Stubbin Colliery itself. The Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway constructed a line from Rotherham Road alongside the canal and below the North Midland line to reach the canal head. The line opened in 1873, and the agreement between the Earl's Colliery Company and the M.S.& L. terminated on 31 December 1978 when the line closed. In 1915 Viscount Halifax invested heavily into improvement of the rail line. The line can be divided into two sections, both originally rope-worked. The lower section serving New Stubbin Colliery, sunk between 1913 and 1915, changed to locomotive working. Its last steam locomotives were two examples built by Hudswell Clarke & Co. of Leeds: No. 34, an outside cylinder, six-coupled side tank locomotive, works No.1523, built in 1925 and delivered new to the Appleby-Frodingham Steel Company in Scunthorpe, which came to the line in the 1950s; and No. 37, an outside cylinder, six-coupled saddle tank. They worked until the mid-1960s, when the line became fully dieselised, Hudswell Clarke again supplying the power.

Stevens was recovering during what amounted to nearly a year of convalescence, after being diagnosed with a collapsed lung and tuberculosis. He spent three months in King Edward VII Hospital, Midhurst, England, transferring afterward to another nine months of bedrest at home. O'Driscoll, Michelle. Disc Magazine interview \\"Tea with the Tillerman\\" Stevens, who was near death at the time he was admitted in the hospital, used the time he was recuperating for contemplation, and wrote dozens of songs, including \\"Trouble\\", many of which were recorded much later. Phillips, Mark. Originally aired on 3 December 2006 CBS Sunday Morning, Yusuf Islam Reflects on His Return; Artist Once Known as Cat Stevens Talks About New Album. Retrieved 12 August 2007 When he was hospitalized, Stevens was often alone in a very spare and plain room. He was told that at the time he was admitted, he had perhaps only a few weeks of life left in him. The effect on the 19-year-old pop star was pronounced. He said, \\"To go from the show business environment and find you are in hospital, getting injections day in and day out, and people around you are dying, it certainly changes your perspective. I got down to thinking about myself. It seemed almost as if I had my eyes shut.\\" Islam, Yusuf Yusuf Islam: Biography The song itself shows Stevens switching from heavily orchestrated pop music to a folk-rock emphasis. While recovering, Stevens donated his spare time, and some of his newer, more introspective songs for Colin Higgins and Hal Ashby's 1971 film soundtrack of Harold and Maude. Most of the tunes used for the movie appear on Stevens's next albums, Mona Bone Jakon and Tea for the Tillerman, with the exception of two songs which were not released until the release of the album Footsteps in the Dark: Greatest Hits Vol. 2 in 1984, \\"If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out\\" and \\"Don't Be Shy\\". In Harold and Maude the song \\"Trouble\\" is used in the scene of Maude's impending death, with her devoted young lover heartbroken over the turn of events.

Meehan (June 5, 1889 - March 31, 1920) was the leader of the White Hand Gang in the 1910s. Dinny Meehan was described by the police as \\"the most desperate gang leader in Brooklyn.\\" Biography Born in Brooklyn, Meehan apparently joined the White Hand Gang in his late teens. In 1912, he was arrested for shooting and killing John \\"Christie\\" Maroney, who led a faction of White Handers from the Navy Yard section of Brooklyn. After a sensational trial where police reserves were called in for fear of rioting if Meehan was convicted, Meehan was surprisingly acquitted, adding to his criminal reputation. Over the years he had served time in the Elmira Reformatory, Blackwell's Island, and the City Workhouse. Dinny often boasted that he would never see the inside of a state penitentiary. Unlike some crime bosses, Dinny Meehan often joined his men on criminal jobs. By 1920, there were a total of three cases pending against him; he was out of jail on a $5,000 bond for robbing a man on Fifth Avenue, leading his men in the hijacking of a truckload of shoes worth $10,000, and overseeing the theft of $10,000 worth of silk from a Red Hook warehouse. On the afternoon of March 31, 1920, Dinny Meehan and his wife Sadie were asleep in bed at their apartment at 452 Warren Street in Red Hook. Their four-year-old son played in the living room while Sadie's mother, Rose Leighton, dozed in a recliner. Neither of them knew that five strange men were in the apartment until the last second. As the men made for the bedroom, the young boy admonished them not to wake his parents. The leader of the group playfully patted the youngster's head and said they just wanted to look in. A total of five shots were fired; one passed through Dinny Meehan's head and then lodged in the shoulder of his wife, who later recovered from her wounds. The gunmen dashed from the building and made their escape in an automobile truck. Meehan's murder has been traditionally thought to have been arranged by Brooklyn Black Hand boss Frankie YaleSchoenberg, Robert J. (1992). Mr. Capone, p. 68. HarperCollins. and carried out by Yale's underboss, Augie Pisano, and two hitmen from Cleveland, Ralph DeSarno and Giovanni Sciacca. At the time of the killing, however, police believed that a possible motive was the gang leader's role in supplying strikebreakers to take the places of employees of the United Fruit Company on piers along the Hudson and East Rivers. These employees had recently walked out when their demands for higher wages were turned down. The arrest of a Frank Madden, an associate of the International Longshoremen's Association Local 856 and his subsequent plea of Not Guilty for the charge of Meehan's murder confirms this. It was also rumored that there was internal strife in the White Hand Gang. Just before his murder, Meehan was acquitted in a robbery case while one of his henchman, Edward Gilchrist, was convicted. Dinny was said to have \\"double-crossed\\" Gilchrist, causing resentment within his gang. Sadie Meehan told police in November 1923 that her husband's killer was, in fact, Wild Bill Lovett, head of the arch-rival Jay Street Gang.English, T. J. (2006).

Shrine to Mandarava in cave above Lake Rewalsar. There are three Buddhist monasteries at Riwalsar. The lake also has three Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Krishna, Lord Shiva and to the sage Lomas. Another holy lake, Kunt Bhyog which is about 1,750 m above sea level lies above Rewalsar.himachaltourism.gov.in It is associated with the escape of 'Pandavas' from the burning palace of wax‚Äîan episode from the epic Mahabharata. It was from here that the Indian teacher and 'Tantric' Padmasambhava left for Tibet. Known to the Tibetans as 'Guru Rinpoche', the Precious Master, it was under Padmasambhava's influence that Mahayana Buddhism spread over Tibet. There are islands of floating reed on Rewalsar lake and the spirit of Padmasambhava is said to reside in them. It is here that the sage Lomas did penance in devotion to Lord Shiva, and the Sikh guru Gobind Singh (22 December 1666 ‚Äì 7 October 1708), the tenth Guru of Sikhism, also resided here for one month. The Sisu fair held in late February/early march, and the festival of Baisakhi are important events at Rewalsar. Legend of Padmasambhava and Princess Mandarava of Mandi (Zahor) Mandarava and Padmasambhava were energetically drawn to one another. Vihardhara, fearful of the contamination of the royal bloodline and what he perceived as Mandarava's apostasy, endeavoured to have Mandarava and Padmasambhava purified by immolation through the flames of a pyre. Instead of finding their corpses incensed and charred, Vihardhara finds that the fire of the pyre has been transformed into Lake Rewalsar, out of which arises a blooming lotus that supports the unharmed Mandarava and Padmasambhava who through this manifestation of their realisation have achieved their secret names of Vajravarahi and Hayagriva, respectively, after which Vihardhara furnishes the union with his unreserved blessings. Legend has it that the great teacher Padmasambhava (Guru Rinpoche) used his enormous power to take flight to Tibet from Rewalsar. In Rewalsar, his spirit is said to reside in the tiny island of floating reed that drifts over the water.  Statue of Padmasambhava  Statue of Padmasambhava above Rewalsar Lake (Tso Pema). On April 1, 2012, a monumental statue of Padmasambhava, measuring 37.5 m (123 ft), was consecrated, blessed and inaugurated by the 14th Dalai Lama. The building project was spear-headed and overseen by Wangdor Rinpoche and funded by donations. It took nearly 10 years to complete, with the foundation alone taking three years. The statue was constructed almost entirely by hand by tradespeople from the immediate Rewalsar area and by master artists from Nepal and Bhutan. It is made primarily of cement, layered by hand over a skeleton of iron rebar, while the walls are made of hand-cut stone. Bhutanese sculptors carved intricate details into the cement while still wet. It was then painted by masters from Nepal, who finished the delicate details by hand. The building's interior is filled with traditional dzong, tsa tsas, prayer flags and medicine pills made by local craftworkers.

All but one coastal species (C. ranunculus) are found in inland waters, such as springs, pools, creeks and streams. Most species live in extreme environments; for example, several species of Chlamydogobius are found in the water that emerges from geothermal springs, such as the Dalhousie goby, found in the waters around Dalhousie Springs. These fish can live in water with a wide range of temperatures, pH, salinity, and oxygen levels; for example they are found in water with a pH between 6.8 and 9.0, and temperatures between . They can tolerate salinity as high as 60 parts per thousand (almost twice that of sea water). They have been found in water with extremely low oxygen levels (as low as 0.8 ppm). Their water habitats often exhibit oxygen levels below 5 milligrams of oxygen per litre. To cope with extremely low oxygen levels, they will emerge from the water to \\"gulp\\" air (known as aerial respiration). They also will position themselves over beds of algae to capture the produced oxygen. They will hide in the mud and silt at the bottom of a stream, or in a plant or under a rock to avoid more extreme water temperatures. Sometimes they will emerge from very hot water for brief periods to take advantage of evaporative cooling. They can survive even if there are drought conditions that reduce the size of their habitat. If there is a flood that results in drastically increased water flow, they anchor themselves to rocks with their pelvic fins. Chlamydogobius fish are able to change their colours to blend in with their environments. Human drilling activities in Australia have often reduced the pressure of the aquifers that feed the Australian hot springs that Chlamydogobius rely on, so some species are endangered.Threats to Australian desert springs Species There are currently six recognized species in this genus: * Chlamydogobius eremius (Zietz, 1896) (Desert goby) * Chlamydogobius gloveri Larson, 1995 (Dalhousie goby) * Chlamydogobius japalpa Larson, 1995 (Finke goby) * Chlamydogobius micropterus Larson, 1995 (Elizabeth springs goby) * Chlamydogobius ranunculus Larson, 1995 (Tadpole goby) * Chlamydogobius squamigenus Larson, 1995 (Edgbaston goby) References Category:Fish of Australia Category:Gobionellinae ","title":"Chlamydogobius"},{"id":"7741028","text":"Greenfield-Central High School is a secondary school (grades 9-12) located in the city of Greenfield, Indiana.

She was one of the \\"educated city youths\\" who were sent to remote countryside to be \\"re-educated by the poor and lower-middle class peasants\\". They were destined to spend their lives as \\"peasants of a new type with a socialist consciousness\\". At the age of nineteen, she was sent to the \\"Great Northern Wilderness\\", deep in Manchuria, where she faced a life of extreme harshness, marked by deprivation and bullying by the party cadres assigned to re-educate the new arrivals. It wasn't until the death of Mao that she was finally allowed, after eight years, to come back to the city. She then resumed her studies and, in 1979, publishing her first significant work, The Right to Love. The book is a reflection on freedom, and resistance to the forces that oppress the individual.

Martin Russell Thayer (January 27, 1819 ‚Äì October 14, 1906) was a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives from the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. His grandnephew was John B. Thayer, who died on the sinking of the RMS Titanic. Early life Martin Russell Thayer was born in Dinwiddie County, Virginia, near the city limits of Petersburg. He attended the Mount Pleasant Classical Institute in Amherst, Massachusetts, and Amherst College. He moved with his father to Philadelphia in 1837. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1840. He studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1842 and commenced practice in Philadelphia. Public service Thayer was a commissioner to revise the revenue laws of Pennsylvania in 1862. He was elected as a Republican to the Thirty-eighth and Thirty-ninth Congresses, during which he served on the committee on the bankrupt law and was the chairman of the United States House Committee on Private Land Claims. He declined to be a candidate for re-election in 1866, and resumed the practice of law. While in Congress, Thayer criticized the use of portraits of living persons on US currency, suggesting that the Treasury's privilege of portrait selection for currency was being abused. Spearheaded by Thayer,Rothbard, p. 126. on April 7, 1866 Congress enacted legislation specifically stating \\"that no portrait or likeness of any living person hereafter engraved, shall be placed upon any of the bonds, securities, notes, fractional or postal currency of the United States.\\"National Monetary Commission, p. 191. Thayer was judge of the district court of Philadelphia from 1867 to 1874, and served as president judge of the court of common pleas of Philadelphia from 1874 until his resignation in 1896. In 1873 he was appointed on the board of visitors to West Point, and wrote the report. (Some 40 years earlier, his cousin Sylvanus Thayer had been superintendent of West Point.) He was elected by the judges of the common pleas court prothonotary of Philadelphia in 1896. He also engaged in literary pursuits. He died in Philadelphia in 1906 and is buried in the churchyard of Church of St. James the Less in Philadelphia.

In 1866 the then 20-year-old Gabriel Strobl became a Roman Catholic priest monk (Pater) at the Benedictine monastery Admont Abbey (Stift Admont). A devastating Monastery fire in 1865 had destroyed the Natural History Cabinet (a museum) and its contents which had included Joseph Stammel‚Äôs Universe. He was entrusted by Abbot Karlmann Hieber (served 1861-1868) with rebuilding the Natural History Museum. In 44 years of work - until his stroke in 1910 - Gabriel Strobl built up the Museum anew. In his first 12 years of work, he devoted himself principally to botany, before dedicating himself completely to entomology for the following 32 years. Although his published work is mainly on Diptera he also worked on Hymenoptera and Coleoptera of the Balkan peninsula which was partially ruled by Austria-Hungary until 1918.

Taft has been referred to as Cincinnati's most prestigious law firm.Djordjevich, Vera (2007). Vault Guide to the Top Chicago & Midwest Law Firms, p. 305. Vault Inc., New York. . History Taft traces its roots back to 1885, when Worthington & Strong was founded by Judge William Worthington and Edward W. Strong. John L. Stettinius and John B. Hollister joined the firm after its founding, at which point the firm became known as Worthington, Strong, Stettinius & Hollister. In January 1923, Judge Worthington died. In the following year, a young firm headed by Robert A. Taft and Charles P. Taft II, sons of former President William Howard Taft, joined the older firm to become Taft Stettinius & Hollister LLP. In 1947, the firm's labor department, led by J. Mack Swigert, was instrumental in helping Robert Taft, who had become a United States Senator, draft and pass the groundbreaking Taft‚ÄìHartley Act that regulated labor unions. Since the 1980s, the firm's expansion beyond Cincinnati has been accomplished with the aid of strategic mergers with local firms with its various branch offices, including Kelley, McCann, and Livingston of Cleveland in 2001, Sommer Barnard of Indianapolis in 2008, Kahn Kleinman of Cleveland in 2008, Chester, Wilcox, and Saxbe of Columbus in 2012,http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2011/11/15/chester-willcox- merging-with-taft.html?page=all and Shefsky and Froehlich of Chicago in 2014. On August 29, 2019, partners at Briggs & Morgan of Minneapolis voted to merge with Taft. The merger became effective January 1, 2020. Practice areas The firm's practice areas include business and finance, business restructuring, bankruptcy and creditor rights, domestic relations, employment, environmental, gaming, government contracts, health and life sciences, higher education, intellectual property, labor relations, litigation, pharmaceutical and life sciences litigation, private client, public finance, real estate, tax, technology services and more.http://www.martindale.com/Taft-Stettinius- Hollister-LLP/law-firm-483037-practice-areas.htm Taft employs more than 600 attorneys following its 2020 merger with Briggs & Morgan.

It was published in 1956. Description The song is a love duet between the protagonists Tony and Maria, sung while Tony visits Maria on the fire escape outside her apartment. West Side Story is a modernized adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet set in 20th-century New York; the scene in which \\"Tonight\\" appears is the adaptation of Romeo and Juliet's famous \\"balcony scene\\". Many of the pieces in West Side Story experiment with different melodic tricks. This song is notable for its prominent perfect fourth intervals, and a theme that starts on a pentatonic scale but develops into a western key. History In the original 1957 Broadway production of West Side Story, \\"Tonight\\" was performed by Larry Kert and Carol Lawrence in the roles of Tony and Maria. In the 1961 film adaptation of the musical, the song was performed by Marni Nixon (dubbing Natalie Wood as Maria) and Jimmy Bryant (dubbing Richard Beymer as Tony). This rendition of the song is listed at #59 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema.

Ground is covered with snow and the lake is frozen. Prashar Lake and temple Prashar Lake lies 49 km north of Mandi, Himachal Pradesh, India, with a three storied pagoda-like temple dedicated to the sage Prashar. Details The lake is located at a height of 2730 m above sea level. With deep blue waters, the lake is held sacred to the sage Prashar and he is regarded to have meditated there. Surrounded by snow-capped peaks and looking down on the fast flowing river Beas, the lake can be approached via Drang. There is a round, floating island inside the lake, which is a common natural phenomenon found all around the world. It is composed of plant matter in various stages of decomposition, and is held aloft by the oxygen in its plants' roots. The floating land moves in all directions in the lake. The floating land covers 7% of area of lake whereas water is with 93%. The temple was built in the thirteenth century and legend has it was built by a baby from a single tree.

Bhima, one of the Pandava brothers, had created the lake. The story says, after the Kurukshetra / Mahabharat war, Pandavas were returning with Lord Kamrunag. When they reached this place, Kamrunag loves the tranquil surroundings and decides to live here forever.

This dent became Prashar Lake.Lake Till now no one has been able to find out the depth of Prashar Lake.

On the school ground is the North Site of the Hull City Learning Centre, no longer part of the City Learning Centres, in the school Information Technology building. History In 1854 Sir Henry Cooper was elected Mayor of Hull and, on the occasion of the visit of Queen Victoria in October of that year, he received a Knighthood. He became a member and first Chairman of the Hull School Board in 1871. When the Board Schools opened in 1876 at Bean Street, Hull, they were named the 'Sir Henry Cooper Schools' and, following their closure, the name was transferred to this school when it opened in September 1967. Sir Henry Cooper School closed in 2012, with pupils transferring to the newly built Thomas Ferens Academy. The building of the academy, sponsored by the University of Hull, met local opposition, with concerns that construction could cause \\"flooding, traffic problems and loss of green space\\".\\"Residents pledge a fight to block academy plans\\"; Yorkshire Post. Retrieved 26 April 2012 The school was renamed Sirius Academy North in 2015. At the west end of Adelaide Terrace was the entrance to Bean Street. Originally a short street leading to an old farm, the street was shown, un-named, and with only a few buildings on Wilkinson‚Äôs plan of Hull of 1848. It was originally named ‚ÄúNew‚Äù Jarratt Street to avoid confusion with the older Jarratt Street in the centre of Hull, and was still named as such on the 1852 Ordnance Survey plan of Hull, when it led only as far as an old-established farm, whose land and buildings initially prevented its further development. Slightly later, a new street called Bean Street was being developed from the north side of the Hessle Road (most likely to have been named in honour of Alderman Robert Bean, a brewer and maltster, who was chairman of the Property Committee in the 1840s). Bean Street was laid out c.1869, and the 1871 Census lists many occupied houses on the street and terraces running off it. It developed north, eventually joining the older New Jarratt Street that ran south from Anlaby Road. As the two became joined c.1871. The Sir Henry Cooper Board School was situated in Bean Street, opening in 1876, it was named after the School Board‚Äôs first chairman. There were 900 places after 1903, for boys girls and infants, Average attendance was 813 in 1904, and 543 in 1938. The boys were transferred to Boulevard High School in 1957 leaving only the senior girls and infants departments. The school was demolished c.1966; the transfer of the land (0.625 acres) was noted in the Town Planning Officer‚Äôs annual report for 1967/68. A new Sir Henry Cooper High School was built on the Orchard Park Estate around the same time. The huge population of Bean Street (it was said that more people lived in Bean Street than the whole of Withernsea) was served by two pubs; a small beer-house called the Engineers Arms, which opened c.1872, and closed in the 1960s. From September 2012 to September 2013 the school site was the temporary home of Newland School for Girls, while its own buildings were reconstructed.

It is likely that the music was introduced to The Maldives by sailors from the Indian Ocean region. It may be said that Boduberu first made an appearance in The Maldives in the 11th Century AD, or possibly before that.  Performance  Boduberu is performed by about 20 people, including three drummers and a lead singer. They are accompanied by a small bell, a set of drums also known as a bodu beru, and an onugandu - a small piece of bamboo with horizontal grooves, from which raspy sounds are produced by scraping. The songs may be of heroism, romance or satire. The prelude to the song is a slow beat with emphasis on drumming, and dancing. As the song reaches a crescendo, one or two dancers maintain the wild beat with their frantic movements ending in some cases in a trance. The costume of the performers is a sarong and a white short sleeved shirt.  Evolution  Boduberu evolved among the common citizens as an alternative to court music. In the early days, the people gathered together to perform Boduberu, and it became widely accepted as the music of the common people. The performing of the music is often referred as \\"vibrating the island\\". A notable point about Boduberu is its noise and sometimes meaningless lyrics sung. The lyrics do not have a meaning, because it consists of a mixture of local, neighbouring and some African words. Today, meaningful songs written in the local language Dhivehi are sung to the rhythm of Boduberu. Boduberu is usually sung after a hard day's work. The location is up to the performers.

The River Gryffe passes through the council areas of Inverclyde and Renfrewshire, rising in Kilmacolm and joining the Black Cart Water between Houston and Inchinnan. The river and its strath extend over the historic county of Renfrewshire. Strathgryfe, anciently a feudal lordship, is associated historically with the origins of the county and anciently the name was used not only for the Strath of Gryffe itself, but for a traditional Province covering the whole of what later became Renfrewshire. History The lands of Strathgryffe were granted by King David I to Walter fitz Alan, first High Steward of Scotland, and founder of the Stewart family in Scotland, probably in the 1150s. The Stewarts would be based in Strathgryffe for centuries thereafter. The introduction of Sheriffs created a further source of political authority in Strathgryffe. In the mid 19th century, local government reforms replaced the ancient provinces by new Counties (shires), aligned to sheriffdom boundaries. As the sheriff for Strathgryffe had based himself in Renfrew, the county was called county of Renfrew. =Name= A Strath is a wide glen. The term is rendered in Scots Gaelic as 'Srath' and in the ancient Modern Welsh as 'Ystrad'. 'Stragrif' is mentioned in the 1169 charter of Paisley Abbey, which placed the churches of the area under the control of the new abbey. Later, the name 'Gryff' is recorded in the Military Survey of Scotland 1747‚Äì1755, compiled by William Roy, a predecessor to the Ordnance Survey maps of Great Britain. However it seems that 'Gryfe' was the established usage until more recent times. The 'Gryffe' name is becoming the predominant usage in the area, seen for example in new signposts showing the name of the river and the names of organisations such as the Gryffe Valley Rotary Club and Gryffe High School in Houston, Renfrewshire. Settlements There are a number of villages in Strathgryffe, varying considerably in size. The following straddle or are immediately adjacent to the River Gryffe: * Kilmacolm * Quarrier's Village (Kilmacolm civil parish) * Bridge of Weir * Houston (including Craigends on the South- east bank of the river) * Crosslee (Houston and Killellan civil parish) Geography The geography of the area is a contrasting mix of green fields surrounding the river, with rough moorland in the higher areas, particularly Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park.

Baron Brimstone successfully steals the Sol-Mac from the Chem-Solar Corporation with the intention of mass- producing it as a weapon and selling it to various figures in the \\"criminal underworld\\". The security at Chem-Solar and Machine Man are unable to prevent the theft. Baron Brimstone later organizes a meeting with non-Maggia affiliated criminals to recruit them into his Satan Squad. Duke Dawson, one of the assembled criminals, takes exception to Brimstone's leadership and met with Delmar Insurance agent Pamela Quinn. This results in Baron Brimstone sending his lieutenants \\"Snake\\" Marston and \\"Hammer\\" Harrison to bring her in for interrogation. When Machine Man tracks them and finds the Satan Squad's hideout, he rescues Quinn, and hands Baron Brimstone to the police.Machine Man #16 While at a Maximum Security unit on Ryker's Island, Baron Brimstone hypnotizes a guard into freeing him.

The day before her abduction she was about to star in a play about the role of women in the Palestinian intifada. She was a prominent member of Poorani Illam, a women's center in Jaffna, which gives support to women traumatized by government bombing raids and bereavement.  Execution  In 1997, LTTE sources acknowledged that she was executed along with another dissident, one Manoharan, also a final year University student.

Early life Culver was born in Logan, Ohio. He received a liberal preparatory schooling and attended the Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio. He moved to Pennsylvania and settled in Reno, Pennsylvania and engaged in mercantile pursuits. He also became interested in the development of oil in Venango County, Pennsylvania, and the establishment of national banks in thirteen cities throughout the East. He was elected as a Republican to the Thirty-ninth Congress. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1866. While a member of Congress, he became bankrupt and was imprisoned in 1866 but was eventually acquitted after a long trial. He resumed operations in the oil business, with headquarters in Franklin, Pennsylvania. He died while on a business trip in Philadelphia in 1909. He was interred in Franklin Cemetery in Franklin, Pennsylvania. Culver and the Great Bank Scandal Culver had made a small profit in Logan, Ohio by investing some bank money in oil. He took that money and began buying up banks throughout the oil region. He bought land two miles below Oil City, Pennsylvania where he established the town of Reno and The Reno Oil and Land Company and starting selling stock in what appears to have been a basic pyramid scheme. Culver also attempted to establish the Reno- Pithole railroad, to run between Reno and Pithole, Pennsylvania, the leading oil boom town at the time. Culver was not one for half measures‚Äîto run the railroad he hired Ambrose Burnside, and to hook investors, he brought deep- pocketed men of wealth from all over the country to tour his as-yet-non- existent oil fields. Ultimately Culver's plan collapsed and he was pursued by creditors and courts up and down the oil region. The collapse of his banks triggered a financial panic throughout the oil region that drove many oilmen out of the business and created chaos that set the stage for men like John D. Rockefeller to move in. A more complete and colorful account of Culver's career can be found in the book The Great Oildorado by Hildegarde Dolson.

Career Considered the most talented of the Westmore brothers, Ern found work at Warner Bros. studio, RKO Studios, and Eagle-Lion Studios. He was the director of make-up on over 50 films during his career, and was also featured as himself in a number of B-movie-style features for Kroger Babb, including One Too Many, and Secrets of Beauty, also known as Why Men Leave Home, an instructional primer for women regarding how to keep their husbands faithful.Internet Movie Database: Ern Westmore. URL accessed 13 January 2006. Ern was also involved in the creation of the House of Westmore with three of his brothers. It was billed as a place of beauty, primarily for women, and Ern was forced to borrow $40,000 from John Barrymore and Errol Flynn to assist in the financing, never paying them back. In 1955, Babb set Westmore up with his own television series. Originally called Hollywood Today, but also called Hollywood Backstage and The Ern Westmore Show, The Ern Westmore Hollywood Glamour Show was a program featuring make-up tips and beauty suggestions. Ern struggled with alcoholism throughout his life, drinking as early as 1921. Often involved with Barrymore, John Decker, and W. C. Fields, Ern would eventually be forced out of Warner Bros. because of his alcohol problem. It eventually led to work with One Too Many.

This allows the nut, when open, to move along the screw without the screw turning (or, vice versa, to allow the screw to pass through the nut without turning). Then, when the nut is closed, it resumes the normal movement of a nut on a screw (in which axial travel is linked to rotational travel) A split nut assembly is often used in positioning systems, for example in the leadscrew of a lathe. It is one of the machine elements that makes single-point threading practical on manual (non-CNC) lathes. The very earliest screw-cutting lathes (in the late 18th and early 19th centuries) did not have them, but within a few decades, split nuts were common on lathes. The two halves of the nut have chamfered ends (60¬∞ to axis), which helps the threads to find engagement during the closing action. Usually the screw and nut are also oiled for lubrication. Such provisions prolong the service life of the threads by minimizing wear. Split nuts work best with trapezoidal threads. Split nuts may not engage and disengage with multi start threads due to the overlapping leads.

He returned to become Japan's leading entrepreneur of the early Meiji period. Early life Godai was born in Satsuma domain (in what is now part of Kagoshima city, Kagoshima Prefecture), and was sent by the domain to study naval science and technology at the Kaigun Denshujo in Nagasaki. At the outbreak of the Anglo-Satsuma War of 1864, he was appointed captain of the Tenu Maru. Along with Matsuki Koan, he was taken prisoner by the Royal Navy when his ship was captured.(Cobbing A 2000) He was chosen as one of 15 students to be sent to Great Britain to study at the University College, London in defiance of the Tokugawa bakufu's official national seclusion policy. Bakumatsu period In 1865 Godai made contact with Thomas Glover who steered negotiations with the Platt textile machinery giant in Oldham, Lancashire, England. This visit led to the establishment of the Kagoshima Mill in Satsuma in 1867 - reputed to be Japan's first modern factory. Manchester engineers spent a year in Kagoshima to supervise building, factory production and the training of local workers. The Manchester Seven - as they became known had a special White Mansion constructed for their comfort and is today a museum. Godai's UK visit also included the Manchester Chamber of Commerce - reputed to have inspired the foundation of the pioneering Osaka Chamber and Industry.Broad 1997. Godai later returned to Europe to negotiate with the Comte des Cantons Charles Montblanc (1832‚Äì1893) to establish a joint venture commercial enterprise for the development of Satsuma's natural resources in exchange for European weapons and manufactured goods. This French‚ÄìSatsuma trading company attracted French investment into the Satsuma domain to establish a steamship shipyard and textile (silk) spinning factories and to send promising students from Satsuma overseas. Its existence also allowed Satsuma to participate as if it were an independent country in the Paris Exhibition of 1867, much to the consternation of the Tokugawa-government representatives. At the same time, Godai used his contacts to purchase the latest warships to equip the Satsuma in preparation with the growing conflict to overthrow the Tokugawa regime. Meiji statesman After the Meiji Restoration, Godai became a San'yo (junior councilor), and used his foreign experience to defuse a number of incidents created against foreigners by xenophobic ex-samurai. He resigned from government service in 1869, and turned his full attention to business. Basing himself in Osaka, he created several major joint stock companies involved in international trade, commerce and shipping, which he operated simultaneously. Godai went on to found the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and the Osaka Stock Exchange. He also participated in the Osaka Conference of 1875, which attempted to hold together the fragile coalition of feudal domains which dominated the early Meiji government. Godai was later implicated in the Hokkaido Colonization Office Scandal of 1881, which brought down the administration of Prime Minister Kuroda Kiyotaka.

When he was twenty-three years old, he began to publish useful works on the Talmud, in which he displayed vast erudition. Rulings Among his rulings in Jewish Law is the consent for women to wear wigs. He argued that hairs which are not attached to the head are not subject to the prohibitions regarding modesty which requires the covering of a woman's hair. He claimed that the woman's duty to make herself attractive to her husband outweighed other objections. His ruling was later included in the great code of Jewish Law known as the Shulchan Aruch.

Early analysts expected Chumash oral literature to conform to the regional pattern of Southern California narratives. However, little evidence was available before accounts from the papers of John Peabody Harrington began to be published in the 1970s. The narratives now seem to have stronger ties with central California than with the Takic and Yuman groups to the south. Research and recording Despite their close ties to the Chumash, Spanish sources did little to collect information on native oral culture. In addition, the Chumash were roughly divided into 8 separate linguistic groups. Obispe√±o, Purisme√±o, Ineze√±o, Barbare√±o, Venture√±o, Island, Cuyama, and Emigdia√±o varied to a degree where they were closer to separate languages than similar dialects.Blackburn, December's Child: A Book of Chumash Oral Narratives, p. 8 The Chumash weren‚Äôt a cultural or linguistic sovereignty in the traditional sense; they were a conglomeration of autonomous settlements. Most recording of Chumash narratives occurred through anthropological study, specifically Harrington‚Äôs papers. Characteristics Like other Native American universes, the Chumash mythical universe is ordered, but still very uncertain. Events occur at the whim of supernatural beings capable of kindness and malevolence. Supernatural beings can be both rational and irrational at times, as humans may be.Blackburn, December's Child: A Book of Chumash Oral Narratives, p. 31 Chumash narratives vary in plot, but the ‚Äúhero‚Äôs journey‚Äù and ‚Äútrickster‚Äôs story‚Äù appear frequently in Chumash oral culture. The motives inspiring the protagonist, however, appear dubious by Western standards. Whereas Western fictional heroes are called to action and make decisions based on a clear set of choices, Chumash protagonists act based on an abstruse imperative or ‚Äúmust‚Äù. Magic and death also appear commonly as literary devices. Conflict often arises between beings with innate magical powers and those who acquired their powers through magical objects or helpers. Death, wherever it occurred in native stories, was always reversible, and was usually undone with the aid of the aforementioned magical powers or special ‚Äúmedicines‚Äù bearing similar supernatural powers. Another commonly used literary device was inversion, where the opposite of what‚Äôs to be expected occurs, ex. supernatural beings consume only toxic materials, or events occurring at day versus night in the human world are chronologically switched in the underworld. Time is not a strongly defined topic in Chumash folklore. Very little detail is placed on the creation of the universe and there‚Äôs little chronological order to narratives, suggesting that Chumash culture valued the idea of progress over time in a different way than the West.Blackburn, December's Child: A Book of Chumash Oral Narratives, pp. 31‚Äì32 The universe was believed to have changed only very slightly in its history; one of the few transformative events was the Flood. The Flood was believed to have transformed the so-called ‚ÄúFirst People‚Äù into present day plants and animals. Modern humans were created by supernatural powers, and death was introduced to deal with overpopulation. The Flood separated Chumash mythology into an unspecified, indeterminate past, and the world we see today. Chumash narratives would transform further with the arrival of Europeans. Again, similar to Western folklore, Chumash narratives often began and ended with idiomatic phrases. ‚ÄúWhen Coyote was human‚Äù or, ‚ÄúMomoy was a rich Widow,‚Äù analogous to ‚ÄúOnce upon a time‚Äù in Western culture, were introductions to stories about the two most commonly seen characters in Chumash narratives. As the West had, ‚Äúand they lived happily ever after‚Ä¶,‚Äù so the Chumash had an idiomatic expression roughly translating to ‚ÄúI am finished, it is the end.‚Äù Most storytelling occurred at night, and some stories were told only in Winter. The Chumash highly valued storytellers, and certain narratives were made privy only to subjects of certain social status. Chumash storytellers would integrate stories from elsewhere into their own beliefs, but despite this, Chumash narratives are significantly distinct from those of neighboring cultures.Blackburn, December's Child: A Book of Chumash Oral Narratives, p. 28 The universe and its origins =The Middle World and the First People= The Chumash believed their universe was divided into at least 3 worlds and groups of beings. The Middle world is occupied by humans. The first world above belongs to supernatural beings such as the Sun, and the Giant Eagle. The first world below is inhabited by monsters which enter the human world after dark. People were believed to be able to travel between worlds, but not without difficulty. Prior to the Flood, the First People dwelled in the Middle world. These people were thought to be largely humanoid with some floral or faunal characteristics related to the plants or animals they would become after the Flood. Unlike other native groups, the Chumash excluded much of the animal kingdom from their folklore. Most of the animals mentioned are birds. Plants, reptiles, mammals, and insects are mentioned occasionally, and fish only have one representative among the First People. Bears, rattlesnakes, elk, whales, and other seemingly impressive animals don‚Äôt appear as characters in Chumash folklore.Blackburn, December's Child: A Book of Chumash Oral Narratives, pp. 34‚Äì35 Among the First People, Coyote appears the most in Chumash narratives as the archetype hero/trickster. Coyote can be thought of as an analogy for man; he has conflicting virtues and vices. Often portrayed as an old man, Coyote is powerful and knowledgeable, but wasn‚Äôt born into the high social stratus of the supernatural beings like the Great Eagle. Also featured prominently among the First People was Momoy. Momoy, depicted as an old woman, turned into Datura meteloides (a narcotic plant) after the Flood. She was a wealthy widow who lived in a far-away place alone or with a daughter. She herself doesn‚Äôt bear power within the universe, but she can take brief glimpses into the future, and inform individuals only the probable outcomes of their actions. One who drinks the water that Momoy uses to wash her hands will fall into a coma and receive visions pertaining to their future or destiny. According to legends, the middle world was supported above the world below by two giant serpents, whose movements would cause earthquakes. The world above was held in place by the Giant Eagle. The middle world was believed to be flat and circular with a number of islands floating on an ocean. The Chumash live on the largest, most central island. To the West exists the land of the dead, filled with souls waiting to be reborn. The land of the dead contains 3 areas similar to purgatory, heaven, and hell: : wit,  îayaya, and ≈†imilaq≈°a.Blackburn, December's Child: A Book of Chumash Oral Narratives, p. 30 =The afterlife= In Chumash belief, the soul is a separate entity from the body, but one only experiences their soul separating from their body at least 3 days after death, or as a harbinger of death. In the case where a living person saw their own soul, it was possible to avoid death by ingesting Momoy or toloache. Immediately following death, the soul oversees the destruction of their property and revisits locations frequented in life before heading Westward to the land of the dead in a ball of light. The soul first encounters two widows who live by merely smelling food and water and bathe themselves in a spring. The soul then travels to a ravine, where it must pass two deadly boulders and two giant ravens who attempt to peck out the eyes of the soul, replacing them with poppies. Then, the soul must pass a tall woman with a scorpion-like tail. She draws attention by clapping and will sting anyone who comes too near. Finally, the soul reaches the ocean spanned by a single bridge or pole. Beneath the consistently rising and falling bridge exists evil souls petrified from the neck down. Two monsters attempt to scare the traveling soul, who, if lacking requisite knowledge or power, will fall into the sea and be transformed into a fish or amphibian. Souls who pass this final test enjoy ≈†imilaq≈°a, a land ruled by a chief in a crystal house, the Sun. Here, one will eat, sleep, and play for eternity, or until they are reincarnated. The discussion of who enters ≈†imilaq≈°a varies among Chumash groups. The Venture√±o, for example, believe the spirits of children and those who drown do not enter ≈†imilaq≈°a, but will be reincarnated after 12 years. =The First World above and supernatural beings= The world above was inhabited by supernatural beings such as the Sun, the Two Thunders, and the  îelye îwun, or Giant Eagle. They generally exist in human form, but have supernatural powers and usually only intervene in human affairs to a minimal extent. They can be malevolent if so inclined and have more control over the universe than any other beings. The Sun was portrayed as an extremely old widower living with two daughters in a crystal house. He and his daughters subsist off human flesh and bones. He wears nothing but a feathered headband in which he tucks the bodies of small children. He carries a torch made of bark which he uses to light the world beneath him. His daughters wear aprons made of live rattlesnakes. Every day, the Sun travels a path around the world and returns to his daughters with corpses to eat. Every day, the Sun plays peon with the Great Eagle against the Coyote of the Sky and the Morning Star. On the Winter solstice, the Moon decides who has won the game for the year. If the Sun wins, there will be a rainy year and bountiful crop yields. If the Sun loses, more people will suffer and die. Some Chumash families apparently stayed indoors all day during the Winter solstice.Blackburn, December's Child: A Book of Chumash Oral Narratives, p. 34 The Great Eagle was seen as a hands-off leader of the first people's social order. The Great Eagle would spend most of his time in the first world meditating, lost in thought. His relatives, falcon, and two hawks play a more active leadership role. The roles of everyone else of the first people follow no distinct hierarchy and reflect societal roles and positions of the Chumash themselves. The Coyote of the Sky appears to be one of the few supernatural powers largely trusted by the Chumash. The Coyote of the Sky was believed to support the welfare of the first people and humans below. The Ineze√±o view him as a father figure and pray to him specifically. The monsters of the world below, however, were thought to be intrinsically malevolent supernatural beings that always pose a threat to humans. They were often described as grotesque, nocturnal, and misshapen.

He also had an important influence on the next generation of lutists through his activity as a teacher of music in his own music school.Facsimile of Pratum Musicum with an introduction and bibliography by Kwee Him Yong, Frits Knuf, Netherlands, 1977 Life Emmanuel Adriaenssen was born in Antwerp between 1540 and 1555. Little is known about his early life and training. It is known that he travelled to Rome in 1574 to study music. Upon his return to Antwerp he started a lute school with his brother Gysbrecht.Don Randel, The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music, Harvard University Press, 1996, p. 7 The brothers had in 1587 a conflict with the musicians' guild of Antwerp because they practised as musicians without becoming members of the guild. Emanuel later became a master of the guild.Godelieve Spiessens, Emmanuel Adriaenssen et son Pratum Musicum, in: Acta Musicologica Acta Musicologica Vol. 36, Fasc. 2/3 (Apr. - Sep., 1964), pp. 142-151 He married Sybilla Crelin in 1584 with whom he had six sons and one daughter. Their sons Alexander (1587-1661), Vincent (1595‚Äì1675) and Niclaes (1598‚Äì1658) became respectively a still life painter, a battle painter and a portrait painter.Vincent Adriaenssen at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Niclaes Adriaenssen at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Prior to the Fall of Antwerp, Emmanuel was likely a Calvinist as he only had his first son baptised in a Catholic after the Fall of Antwerp. He was registered as a Catholic in the purge records of the Antwerp civic guard after the Fall of Antwerp. His wealth and good connections with the higher circles of Anwerp society may have protected him. Emmanuel was later appointed captain of the civic guard, an activity providing a regular income. In 1595 he took part in the liberation of the neighboring town of Lier, which had been occupied by troops of the Dutch Republic. Adriaenssen became a well-off burgher who frequented the local notables including probably from the nobility, who valued his virtuosity on the lute. He gained an international reputation thanks to his publications of lute music which found their way into the libraries of illustrious people, such as Philips of Marnix, Lord of Saint- Aldegonde, Constantijn Huygens, King John IV of Portugal and Cardinal Mazarin. Composers Adrian Denss (1594), Robert Dowland (1610), Georg Leopold Fuhrmann (1615), Jean-Baptiste Besard (1617), Wolfgang Printz (1690) and Ernst Gottlieb Baron (1727) mention him as a leading composer for lute. As a teacher, he played an important role because of the outstanding tablatures that he published and because he was the initiator of an Antwerp lute school whose pupils included, in all likelihood, Denss and Joachim van den Hove.Godelieve Spiessens, Adriaenssen, Emanuel, in : Sadie, Stanley et Tyrrell, John (ed.), 'The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians Vol. 1', London, 2001 Emmanuel Adriaenssen died in Antwerp between 2 February 1604, the date on which he made his last will, and 27 February 1604, the date of is funeral and burial in the St. James' Church, Antwerp. His wife remarried and emigrated later to Leiden in the Dutch Republic taking her youngest son Niclaes with her. Works Page (f. 59v) of the Pratum Musicum The Pratum Musicum was first published in Antwerp in 1584 and was reprinted with alterations several times until 1600. They constitute 3 editions: * Pratum musicum longe amoenissimum, cuius ... ambitu comprehenduntur ... omnia ad testudinis tabulaturam fideliter redacta... opus novum (Antwerp, Petrus Phalesius the Younger 1584), reprinted in 1600; and * Novum pratum musicum... selectissimi diversorum autorum et idiomatum madrigales, cantiones, et moduli... opus plane novum, nec hactenus editum (Antwerp, Petrus Phalesius the Younger and Johannes Bellerus, 1592). The Pratum Musicum contains lute solos, and more importantly settings of madrigals for multiple lutes and different ensembles involving lutes and voices giving much study material for the researcher into renaissance performance practice. The book contains around 85 tablatures for fantasias, songs and dances. Most of the vocal pieces are in Italian. The Neapolitan songs, with their parallel fifths (which not required in Italian text, so it is a question here of a style marker) have a more rustic character. One of them, Del crud‚Äôamor, has an almost Oriental character. Various dances for solo lute also tend toward the rustic. The ensemble pieces have been recorded by the Dowland Consort of Lutes and by the Liuto Concertato.

It pitted Kitani Minoru and Go Seigen, close rivals for a decade and friends at a personal level, and both ranked 7 dan, against each other. Go Seigen emerged victorious by a 6-4 margin. This match marked the beginning of the period of his dominance as the top player, which continued until the First Meijin Tournament in 1962. Background Nine months before the match started, Kitani had defeated Honinbo Shusai, the Meijin, in Shusai's retirement game. The Honinbo title was to be open to competition, and both Kitani and Go took part in that tournament. Each failed to get through to the final match, which was contested by Sekiyama Riichi and Shin Kato, with Sekiyama becoming the first Honinbo under the titleholder system in 1941. The preliminaries of this first Honinbo tournament were under way during the Kamakura match. With wartime conditions, the pace of all competitions slowed considerably. All these players also took part in the Oteai competition. The first 9 dan to emerge from the Oteai was Fujisawa Kuranosuke, some years later (at this time 6 dan). At the time, it was hard to receive promotion even to 8 dan. The pool of top players was rather small; Karigane Junichi was 8 dan but had stayed outside the system that had established itself around Shusai and the Nihon Ki-in. The result of the match was the first step in the process by which Go Seigen would establish ascendancy over his rivals (except Sekiyama, who withdrew from competition because of bad health). He was promoted to 8 dan in spring 1942. Having taken on Kitani, against whom he had an unfinished jubango stopped at 3-3 in 1933 when Kitani was promoted, Go took on both Karigane and Fujisawa (whom he played in the end in three long matches), and then the new Honinbos Hashimoto Utaro and Iwamoto Kaoru. Go Seigen played again in the Honinbo tournament, but not after 1945. In later years various challenges allowed him to face the Honinbo of the time. The games Apart from game 2, played in Shiba Park in Tokyo, and game 5 played in Gunma Prefecture, the match was held in various locations actually in Kamakura. The first game was in the Buddhist temple Kench≈ç-ji. Game 3 was in Engaku-ji, as were games 4, 6 and 9. The games 7, 8 and 10 were in the Hachiman Shinto shrine in Kamakura. The starting conditions of the match were tagaisen; since the players were of equal rank: colours alternated, with Kitani winning the nigiri. There was no komidashi. Largely unexpectedly, Kitani went 1-5 down over the first six games, and so was subject to beating down. The final four games, beginning 29 December 1940, were therefore played at sen-ai-sen, with Kitani taking Black twice, White, then Black. Of those final games, Go Seigen could win only the second, so that with a net score of 4-6 and a win with White Kitani had salvaged some of his reputation. All ten games are masterpieces, with both players showing great spirit. Sponsorship The match was sponsored by the Yomiuri Shimbun.

Though there may have been another similar fortification erected nearby during the Heian period (794-1185), it is likely that the last incarnation of Shakujii castle was first built after the Kamakura period (1185-1333). A dam was built around the same time, a short distance from the castle, at a spot selected by a diviner, to block the waterway. The castle lasted into the Muromachi period (1336-1467) and was controlled by the Toshima clan.

Toshima Yasutsune led the forces of Shakujii castle and nearby Nerima castle to reinforce his brother, Toshima Yasuaki, who was attacked at Hiratsuka castle. They were defeated by the army of ≈åta D≈çkan, a vassal of the Uesugi clan, who put down the rebellion. The Toshima then fled to Kozukue Castle. They were defeated there as well, and Shakujii castle was destroyed a short time later. Recently, attempts have been made to restore the castle. However, there is very little remaining above ground. Based on what digging has revealed, it has been difficult to determine the exact location, size, and extent of the fortifications and the moat.

The fire occurred when an arsonist set a wardrobe closet on fire at the Wincrest Nursing Home building, located at 6326 N. Winthrop Avenue. The alarm sounded at 11:30 a.m. and the fire was put out at 1:30 p.m. Although the building itself sustained minor smoke, fire and water damage, 23 people died from smoke inhalation. A 21-year-old housekeeper was arrested by authorities and was charged with multiple counts of arson. The fire was described as the worst of its kind in Chicago's history, and caused the Board of Health to enact changes. The building In its design plan, the building complex consisted of 28 rooms, which could accommodate 88 residents. The original brick building was demolished in 1966 as part of a three-stage construction project and was replaced by a three story building and a garden. The complex was finally completed in 1973. =Construction of the building= The original nursing home complex was a 1,906 sq ft (177 m¬≤) brick building consisting of two floors. In 1959, a second building was added to the rear which includes a garden. The addition increased the size of the complex to 5,179 sq ft (481 m¬≤). The addition was built with precast concrete floor and roof slabs connected to steel beams and columns. In 1966, the brick building was removed and was replaced by a three story building; at the same time, a third floor was added to the original building constructed in 1959. Overall, the second addition expanded the complex to 9,466 sq ft (879 m¬≤). In 1973, a third building was added with a 10 ft (3 m) corridor connecting to the existing building complex. The third building also consisted of three floors and had a floor area of 3,613 sq ft (336 m¬≤). The construction of the third building, consisted of precast concrete floor slabs, metal roof deck on steel bar joists. All of the buildings were covered with a 5/8 inch fire rated plasterboard. =Structural details= After the entire complex was finished in 1973, it had nursing area, lounges, and a small kitchen with no cooking appliances, closets and bathrooms on the all three floors. The complex also had a laundry room, boiler room, storage room and chapel lounge which is located in the third building of the complex. In the design plan, the nursing home complex only had two stairways. The first stairways are located in the first building, near the lobby area and the second stairway is located in the second building. Both stairways had doors that have wire mesh windows and are operated by hydraulic door closers. The complex also had only one elevator which also located in the first building across from the lobby stairway. The exterior walls of the building consisted of brick and concrete blocks surrounded by gypsum board. The interior walls also consistent of gypsum with the outer wall finish consisting of paint, wallpaper, ceramic tile and vinyl. Overall, the entire structural system of the building complex consisted of a reinforced concrete foundation and floor slabs up to thick. All of the floor slabs are supported by fire resistant columns and beams. All of the patient rooms, lounge areas, and chapel on all three floors had a natural ventilation system (i.e. open windows). The restroom area, enclosed garden area, nurses offices and other rooms in the building complex were ventilated by heater, air conditioner and ceiling fans. All of the buildings electrical system were composed of system II required emergency exit signs and corridor lighting system. The system operated an automatic transfer switch which operates the emergency lights in case of power failure. The third floor of the building complex had battery powered emergency lighting. The nursing home was equipped with a manual and automatic fire alarm system that is connected directly to the fire alarm office of the Chicago Fire Department. The alarm system was designed to give out a code or box number of the alarm station when activated. The manual fire alarm system consisted of two pull fire alarm boxes located on each floor and one fire alarm box located at the entrance of the building. The automatic fire alarms are activated by heat sensors which are located on the third floor, both stairways and in the storage closet. The automatic fire alarm system also consisted of smoke detectors. On the third floor, three fire extinguishers and two public address loud speakers were installed. =Building conditions before the fire= The Wincrest Nursing Home was inspected by three departments (health, building and fire) on a monthly basis. The last inspection occurred on January 8, 1976 (21 days before the fire). All inspections showed no code or health violations. Incident At the time of the fire, the building was occupied by 83 residents, three nurses, 2 aides and eleven office, kitchen and maintenance staff. 28 of the residents were in the chapel room on the third floor of the building. =The fire= Fire was reported in room 306 by a nurse's aide who pulled the fire alarm box. The alarm was received by the Chicago Fire Department at 11:43 A.M (CDT). Attempts to put out the fire by staff proved to no avail. The first fire engine arrived at the scene of the fire 3 minutes and 40 seconds later as nursing home staff evacuated the burning building. More fire engines arrived seconds later as smoke was seen rising from the top of the building. At 11:46 A.M., firefighters fighting the fire, discovered the third floor heavily laden with smoke and trapped elderly patients in wheelchairs. The victims were immediately removed from the burning building and were transported to nearby hospitals. The fire was put out at 1:28 p.m. CDT. The room where the fire broke out was completely gutted and the adjacent corridor sustained only moderate smoke and heat damage. Three other rooms also suffered heat and smoke damage. No smoke damage was evident on the second or first floors and water damage was minor. However, despite the minor damage to the building, 23 fatalities were reported due to smoke inhalation. Aftermath =Investigation= An investigation made by the Chicago Police Department and fire department. The survivors claimed that the fire was started in a plywood wardrobe closet in Room 306 which was unoccupied at the time. Although the actual cause of the fire was unknown, the Police Bureau of Investigation arrested a housekeeper who was charged with multiple counts of arson. It is unclear, however, how the authorities determined that the fire was an act of arson, and the arsonist's motives for starting the fire were never noted. The investigation also indicated that the smoke and heat from the fire raced down the corridor and entered rooms where doors were left open. In addition, a window was left open, reducing the amount of smoke and toxic gas entering the chapel area and the lounge room thus preventing further fatalities. Investigators also cited the difficulty of moving elderly patients in wheelchairs to the nearby stairway and the inability of elderly patients of evacuating themselves from the third floor where the fire took place. =Fire safety improvements= The City of Chicago and the Board of Health made several safety improvements after the fire. These improvements include: *Installing a sprinkler system in all new and existing nursing homes and that the new sprinkler systems must be connected with the fire alarm system. *Requiring emergency training for all nursing home staff which includes transporting patients during an emergency, maintaining designated areas for family members and establish a roll call system for nursing home personnel. *The abolishment of dead-end corridors in nursing home. *Requiring all nursing home management to have a background check on all nursing home employees. *A disaster plan and regular emergency drills made by the Board of Health. *A requirement of residents to wear identification bands. *Stricter smoking rules were enforced after the fire. Now, residents or visitors must smoke in designated areas supervised by staff. =Recent violations= *On March 31, 1998, the Illinois Department of Public Health fined Wincrest Nursing Home $10,000 (1998 USD) after a staff member hit an elderly woman with a coffee cup and a wet bed linens. After an investigation by the health department and local police, the employee was fired. *On February 2, 2005, the nursing home was fined $5,000 (2005 USD) for failure to provide adequate supervision after a deranged resident set fire to his room. no hearing date was set for the nursing home.

She was wrecked in Audierne Bay in 1797, following an engagement with the French ship-of-the-line, Droits de l'Homme. Armament and construction Amazon was one of four 36-gun, 18-pound, Amazon- class frigates built to a design by William Rule. She and her sister ship, , were ordered on 24 May 1794.

They were 933 tons burthen a piece.Winfield p.148 Work began in June at Rotherhithe by Wells & Co, when the keel was laid down. Launched on 4 July 1795 Amazon was taken to Deptford where she was completed from 3 - 25 September. Including fitting, her construction had cost ¬£24,681. Amazon was built to carry a main battery of twenty-six on her upper gun deck, eight on the quarter deck and two on the forecastle. She additionally carried ten carronades, six on the quarter deck and two on the forecastle. When fully manned, she had a complement of 264. Service In 1795, while under the command of Captain Robert Carthew Reynolds, she was part of the Inshore Squadron under Sir Edward Pellew watching the French port of Brest to report any attempt by the French fleet to leave port. Pellew's force comprised the 44-gun ships and , the 38-gun frigate , Amazon, and a second 36-gun frigate, . Cruising off Ushant, late in the afternoon of 13 April 1796, a ship was seen to windward. Pellew, ordered R√©volutionnaire to sail an intercepting course while the rest of the squadron gave chase. R√©volutionnaire eventually cut off the quarry, which turned out to be the French frigate, Unit√©, and after a brief exchange of fire, forced her to surrender.James (Vol.I) p.321 A week later, on 20 April, Amazon was again in pursuit of an enemy frigate. With Argo in Plymouth and R√©volutionnaire on her way home with her prize, the three remaining British frigates were lying- to off The Lizard, when 40-gun Virginie was spotted.James (Vol.I) pp.324-325 Indefatigable, being the best sailer, was first to engage, after a chase, lasting 15 hours. When Amazon and Concorde caught up, the French ship surrendered.James (Vol.I) p.325 Then on 13 June, Amazon contributed to the capture of the 16-gun Betsy and the 14-gun Les Trois Couleurs off Brest. On 11 December 1796, Amazon was despatched with news that seven French ships of the line had arrived in Brest. This was part of the preparation for an invasion of Ireland.James (Vol.II) p.6 The French fleet left harbour and evaded the main British blockade fleet and sailed for Bantry Bay. However, storms scattered them and most returned to France having accomplished very little.James (Vol.II) pp.7-8 In the Action of 13 January 1797, Amazon, in company with Pellew's ship Indefatigable, encountered the French ship Droits de l'Homme, a 74-gun ship of the line.James (Vol.II) p.11 Normally, frigates would not engage a ship of the line as they would be severely outgunned. However, there was a heavy sea and the French ship could not open her lower deck gunports for fear of flooding. This reduced her broadside considerably.James (Vol.II) p.12 Pellew was seven miles ahead of Amazon when he first attacked the Droits de l'Homme. An hour and a half later Amazon came up and poured a broadside into the Frenchman's quarter. The two frigates attacked her from either side yawing to rake her while avoiding much of her return fire.James (Vol.II) p.13 At 4.20 am on 14 January land was suddenly sighted ahead and the frigates broke off the attack and headed in opposite directions. Amazon, going north, and more severely damaged, was unable to wear and ran aground at Audierne Bay, Isle Bas.James (Vol.II) p.16 Three crew had been killed during the battle and six more drowned, but the rest were able to reach shore.

Tomatis (1 January 1920 ‚Äì 25 December 2001) was a French otolaryngologist and inventor. He received his Doctorate in Medicine from the Paris School of Medicine. His alternative medicine theories of hearing and listening are known as the Tomatis method or Audio-Psycho-Phonology (APP). Tomatis' approach began as an effort to help professional singers in his native Nice based on his idea that errant hearing is the root cause of a variety of ailments. His Listening Test and later his Electronic Ear therapy were designed to alleviate these problems.  Tomatis' life and work  Alfred Tomatis grew up in a musical family in France. His father was an opera singer, and he spent much of his childhood traveling with him and watching his opera performances from the wings. At an early age, however, he and his parents decided he was not fit for the stage. So he went into medicine and eventually became an Ear, Nose and Throat physician. Soon after he began his practice, his father began referring him opera colleagues with vocal problems. Tomatis soon discovered traditional treatments inadequate but also that there was very little research on the voice itself. He formulated the theory that many vocal problems were really hearing problems. His theory that \\"the voice does not produce what the ear does not hear\\", is the hallmark of his research and his method. He discovered that the voices of opera singers had damaged their own muscles of the middle ears. With damaged hearing, they were forcing their voices to produce sounds in registers they could no longer hear. In his attempt to retrain his patients, he developed the Electronic Ear, a device which utilizes electronic gating, bone conduction transducers and sound filters to enhance the uppermost missing frequencies. The goal is to tonify the muscles of the middle ear in order to sensitize the listener to the missing frequencies. Tomatis began treating a number of other problems with the same methods, including reading problems, dyslexia, depression, severe schizophrenia, and even autism. He found evidence that many of these problems result from a failure of communication, which has to do with listening and the ear. Scientific reports showed that the ear starts forming a few days after conception and that the ear is fully developed by the fourth month of pregnancy. Tomatis theorized that information coming from the fetal ear stimulates and guides the development of the brain. He believed that a number of auditory communication problems begin in pregnancy, with the fetus not properly responding to the voice of the mother. Tomatis theorized that the whole body is involved in the production of speech and language. He stated that reading, even silent reading, is an activity of the ear. He recommended reading out loud, not only for children and by children, but also by adults, for 30 minutes a day. He claimed this not only stimulates the brain but is the best way to learn. His most controversial method attempts to lead autistic children to recognize and respond to their mother's voice. The electronic ear, he maintained, could simulate the sound of the mother's voice as heard in the uterus, and to lead the child gradually to accept and respond to her real unfiltered voice. He reported that this method often brought startling results, with children crying with joy as they recognized their mother's voice for the first time. In many of the differing issues he addressed, Tomatis believed that many problems of learning disabilities, dyslexia, schizophrenia, and depression were caused by some trauma resulting from broken relationships and poor communication. He found that treatment of these maladies requires the cooperation of the parents and even grandparents. In his autobiography, Tomatis recounts the many run-ins he had with the medical establishment in both France and Canada, where he later worked. Eventually he left the orthodox medical community, admitting that his practice was beyond the scope of normative allopathic comprehension. He named his new field audio-psycho- phonology.  The science of Tomatis  Tomatis reported in his autobiography that he regretted not providing scientific colleagues with more statistical evidence for his work along with his many publications, but he claimed that the benefits of his methods are difficult to measure. Due to the lack of scientific basis and the wide range of diseases it claimed to treat, French authorities have always considered Tomatis sound therapy as an alternative medicine which should not be promoted. The results of a scientific study published in 2008 reflect a lack of improvement in language using the Tomatis Method for children with autism. However, in 2010 Jan Gerittsen conducted a detailed case analysis of Corbet's reported findings on children on the Autism Spectrum Disorder. Gerittsen showed that for this particular research an individual case study design would have been the more appropriate research design method. His individual case study analysis captured with higher fidelity the effect of Tomatis Method in each of the participants. Given individual differences of children on the Autism Spectrum a group design study could omit to address the significant improvements which Gerittsen noted occurred in 60% of the participants in the areas of language, daily living skills, social interaction and motor skills. Tim Gilmor's meta-analysis, covering four smaller studies of the Tomatis method found that \\"Positive effects sizes were found for each of the five behavioral domains analyzed\\". These study results, although positive, are limited by major methodological issues such as small sample sizes and limited use of random assignment. Gerittsen summarized 35 reteach studies documenting effects of the Tomatis Listening Method in a variety of cognitive, developmental / behavioral and aptitude domains. These include studies on children and adults with learning and developmental disabilities including auditory processing issues as well as applications for optimizing well-being and aptitude in musicians. In 2013, Liliana Sacarin found significant early effects, after only 30 hours of Tomatis sound stimulation, in children 7-13 of age diagnosed with AD/HD when using standardized measures of performance, observed behavior and brain electrophysiology. The results of her doctoral dissertation evidenced statistically significant improvements in cognitive, attentional and behavioral measures for the Tomatis group when compared to the controls (non- Tomatis group). The Sacarin study reported that the qEEG group analysis resulted in significant brain electrophysiology changes for the Tomatis group but not for the controls. Despite criticisms of Audio Processing Integration in general and the Tomatis Method in particular, some of those treated, notably G√©rard Depardieu, Sting and Maria Callas, maintain that they experienced highly beneficial results from working with Tomatis and his method. In some websites it is reported, that in the years 2005‚Äì2007 the Ministry of Education in Poland had implemented the Tomatis Method in hundreds of schoolshttp://free.ebooks6.com/COMBATING-SCHOOL-FAILURE-IN-POLAND-A- REMARKABLE-INITIATIVE-download-w54588.pdf with financial support of a programme initiated by the European Union, recommended and scientifically accompanied by the 'Instytut Fizjologii i Patologii S≈Çuchu, Warszawa' (Institute for the Physiology and Pathology of the Ears, Warsaw). Research done in Poland (72 schools; 1333 children) proved that the training improved key school competences (ability to learn; social competences; language competences; music competences.  The Tomatis effect  Tomatis adapted his techniques to target diverse disorders including auditory processing problems, dyslexia, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorders, autism, and sensory processing and motor-skill difficulties. It is also claimed to have helped adults fight depression, learn foreign languages faster, develop better communication skills, and improve both creativity and on-the-job performance. About some musicians, singers and actors it is also claimed they have said they had found it helpful for fine-tuning their tonal and harmonic skills. The Tomatis Method uses recordings by Mozart and Gregorian Chant as well as of the patient's mother's voice. Tomatis' use of Mozart is not to be confused with so-called Mozart Effect popularized by American author and music researcher Don Campbell. Although Tomatis coined the phrase, his method is not directly related to claims that listening to Mozart increases intelligence. Tomatis wrote fourteen books and over two thousand articles. His Ear and Language, The Conscious Ear, The Ear and the Voice and We are all Multilingual have been translated into English, the latter by author David Charles Manners.  Awards and honors  Tomatis' awards and honors include: * Knights of Public Health (1951) * Gold Medal for Scientific Research Brussels (1958) * Grand Medal of Vermeil from the City of Paris (1962) * Price Isaure Clemence (1967) * Gold Medal of the Society \\"Arts, Sciences and Letters\\" (1968) * Commander's Cultural and Artistic Merit (1970) * Medal of Honor Society for Promoting Arts and Letters (1992).

John Anstis (29 August 1669 ‚Äì 4 March 1744) was an English officer of arms, antiquarian and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1702 and 1722. He rose to the highest heraldic office in England and became Garter King of Arms in 1718 after years of political manoeuvring. Early life Anstis was born at St Neot, Cornwall on 29 August 1669. He was the first son of another John Anstis and his wife Mary, the daughter of George Smith. Anstis matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford, on 27 March 1685 and entered the Middle Temple on 31 January 1690. On 23 June 1695 he married Elizabeth, daughter and heir of Richard Cudlipp of Tavistock, Devon. They had eight sons and six daughters. Anstis was called to the bar on 19 May 1699. Political life In March 1701, Anstis received permission from the Earl Marshal, Henry Howard, 7th Duke of Norfolk, to collect materials from the College of Arms library to assist in the defence of the jurisdiction of the Earl Marshal, which was under attack. Anstis was also elected to Parliament for St Germans in 1702. When the Garter King of Arms, Sir Thomas St George, died in March 1703 Anstis was in a position to advise Lady Howard on how to protect her son's rights from the threat of a royal nomination of a new Garter on the one hand and the assumption of the nomination by the deputy earl marshal. Sir Henry St George was nominated to be Garter and succeeded his brother in June 1703. Heraldic career Anstis did not stand for election to Parliament in 1705. In May 1707 he was nominated Carlisle Herald of Arms Extraordinary and Norfolk Herald, as part of a plan to persuade Garter St George to administer the office jointly, with Anstis doing most of the work. In spite of the nomination, Anstis was never appointed to either post. His main rival to succeed St George was now John Vanbrugh, who had become Clarenceux King of Arms in March 1704 to strengthen his own claims to the office. In December 1710 Anstis used a change in administration to try again at securing the Gartership. On 20 January 1711 he was re-elected to Parliament in a by-election as MP for St Mawes and was then elected as MP for Launceston at the 1713 general election. He changed his strategy with St George. He continued to secure offices related to public records for himself and he remained loyal to the Tory ministry in Parliament. With his influential political friends, Anstis was eventually able to obtain the promise of an appointment to the office of Garter King of Arms, on 2 April 1714. Anstis was returned again as MP for Launceston in the 1715 general election and held the seat until the 1722. By the time that Sir Henry St George died in August 1715, the political situation had shifted away from Anstis's political connections: Vanbrugh was nominated to the office and took measures to secure the passage of his grant. In addition, on 30 September 1715 Anstis was arrested on suspicion of involvement in plotting a Jacobite uprising in Cornwall. A protracted legal battle ensued as Anstis and Vanbrugh both claimed the title of Garter. Anstis eventually emerged victorious in May 1718. In 1724 he obtained an order for publishing, as editor and assisted by Elias Ashmole, the Register of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, From its Cover in Black Velvet Usually Called the \\"Black Book\\", which was printed at his own expense. This was a transcript of the Latin \\"Black Book of the Garter\\", the earliest surviving register of that order, written in about 1535, now in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle. In the preface to his work he wrote: > While we, with sensible regret, complain of the loss of these old annals > whereby we are deprived of a great treasure, it hath been judged expedient > to preserve the remains which have happily escaped this shipwreck. And > therefore the eldest register remaining in the archives is now exhibited to > publick view, less by the currency of time or any unforeseen accident it > might be subject to the same unhappy fate. The original manuscript is a very > large pompous volume in folio written in an handsome strong character on > vellom, having the initial letters of each paragraph, together with the > names of the companions and of the knights nominated in scrutinies, > beautifully embellished with gold, placed on squares of gold and azure > alternately...It hath been shewn in the introduction when and by whom this > register was compiled and from what materials it was collected. In the following year he interested Robert Walpole in a plan for a new order of chivalry based on a revival of the medieval Order of the Bath. This led to his Observations Introductory to an Historical Essay on the Knighthood of the Bath in 1725 and to Anstis's drawing up the statutes for the new order. Anstis duly presided over the coronation of George II in 1727. In 1728 he embarked on extensive research to prove that his family was related to Archbishop Henry Chichele, the founder of All Souls College, Oxford. This research could have entitled his son, John Anstis, to a fellowship at the college; which was blocked by Archbishop William Wake, Anstis did have his son made Blanc Coursier Herald in 1727. In 1737 he secured the succession of his office of Garter to John the younger. Death and legacy Anstis died on 4 March 1744 at Mortlake, Surrey. He was buried at Duloe in Cornwall on 23 March according to his wishes. Anstis was an indefatigable antiquarian whose correspondence with fellow scholars such as Thomas Hearne and Humfrey Wanley testifies to his wide interests. He left a mass of unpublished papers, including over 8000 pages of notes on English history, Jurisprudence, Chronology, Heraldry, Ecclesiastical and Military Affairs. Many of his papers were sold in 1768 and in 1774 and are now held in the British Library, the Bodleian Library, and All Souls, Oxford. Arms References Bibliography *John Anstis.

Between 2006 and 2013 he made 40 appearances scoring 1 goal for the Uruguay national team Club career =Early career= Scotti was born in Montevideo, but grew up in Trinidad, capital of Flores Department. He started his career playing football for the local village team Independiente in 1993, when he was between 17 and 18 years old. Scotti won the regional tournament title in his second season with Independiente in 1994. After three seasons in Independiente, in 1997 he joined to Central Espa√±ol on trial. He spent only three months there before leaving for Montevideo Wanderers. In that club, Scotti played 12 games and scored one goal for the club during the Uruguayan first division tournament of that year. In 1998, Scotti played for his first international club, the Chilean Primera Divisi√≥n team Huachipato, where Scotti had a good spell, for example, having much continuity, scoring goals and being elected the best player of the tournament in his position. He remained until the next season, when he was transferred to the Mexican club Necaxa. There, he achieved third place FIFA Club World Championship 2000, after winning 4‚Äì3 on penalties against Real Madrid. In 2001, he returned to Uruguay to play again for Montevideo Wanderers. In 2002, he was transferred to Nacional, winning the Torneo Apertura and the Campeonato Uruguayo, scoring a goal in the second final game. =Russia & Argentina= He then moved to Russia in 2003 where he played for FC Rubin Kazan in the Russian Premier League until December 2006. In January 2007, Scotti joined Argentine Primera Divisi√≥n side Argentinos Juniors, on request of the team's coach Ricardo Caruso Lombardi. =Colo- Colo= On 31 December 2009, it was announced that Scotti had come to verbal agreements with Colo-Colo for an undisclosed fee. He put pen to paper on a one-year deal and joined Santiago club before new year's day alongside argentinian Mat√≠as Quiroga.

His league debut came on 23 January, in a 3‚Äì2 loss against Uni√≥n San Felipe and his first goal for the club was in a 3‚Äì0 home victory over Palestino after an excellent free kick. Then, on 8 May, Scotti scored his second league goal in a 5‚Äì2 win to Cobresal, his goal being voted the week‚Äôs best according to CDF's top five weekly summary of goals. After the World Cup held at South Africa (which Scotti played with Uruguayan national team) he began to lose his shape, so that Diego Cagna (club‚Äôs coach) relegate him some games to the detriment of Miguel Riffo. On 7 November, Scotti played in the 2‚Äì2 Chilean derby draw with Universidad de Chile where was sent off after double yellow card following a challenge with adversary team striker Carlos Bueno. However Colo-Colo lost the race for the title with Universidad Cat√≥lica in the penultimate matchday after a seven-point lead over San Carlos team, which finished when Scotti's side lost 2‚Äì1 with O'Higgins and Cat√≥lica won simultaneously 3‚Äì2 over Cobreloa at Calama.

When she was a teenager, she kept a diary, which describes life in Diamantina, Minas Gerais, Brazil which was then published in 1942. The diary was published under a pen name Helena Morley. When it was originally published it was in portuguese under the title Minha Vida de Menina. The diary was then translated in to English by Elizabeth Bishop in 1957.  Biography  Igreja de Nossa Senhora das Merc√™s, located in Diamantina, MG, Brazil. The building is in the historic region of the town. She was born in Diamantina, Minas Gerais, Brazil to an English father and a Brazilian mother. Her father worked as a diamond miner. The diary chronicles Brant's daily life, and covers her teenage years until 1895. In 1900 Brant married Augusto M√°rio Calderia Brant, they had five children together. Brant says that she published her diaries in order to act as a role model for younger females who may read the book. She wrote that the diary was a way to show young women what becoming an adult means, and in this way she is acting like a grandmother to the reader. One of her daughters, Ignez Caldeira Brant, married with Abgar Renault, Ministry of Education (Brazil) (1955-1956) e do Tribunal de Contas da Uni√£o (1967-1973).  Published Work  Brant's only published work is The Diary of Helena Morley, which she began writing when she attended the Normal School. The diary discusses her daily life in the diamond mining town of Diamantina, romantic interests, but it also deals with heavier topics like loss. The book also discusses relationships, marriage in particular, but also social affairs and Brant's dreams. The topics of the book make it so that it could be a diary of a present day teenager rather than one 60 years ago Since Brant discusses her everyday life, insights about that point in history are able to be gained by reading the diary, particularly about the effects of the abolition of slavery. There is very little documentation about life post emancipation, making the diary an important resource for historians Brant is praised for her ability to add humor to the discussion of racism, which typically is associated with seriousness. Another reason Brant's book was so popular is the nostalgic that it brings the reader, the provincial life of a small town, that the reader is able to find peace in the description of the simple life.  Reception  The book attracted attention like many other diaries of young women. The prevalence of young female diaries is explained for many of the same reasons Brant's own diary is popular. That they allow the reader to feel young again and reminisce about when they were a teenager. Some of the first attention that was drawn to Brant for her work was after Alexandre Eul√°lio praised Brant for her work these praises placed Brant among classic Brazilian authors. French author Georges Bernanos also made the public aware of the book. Elizabeth Bishop was originally drawn to the work in 1952, then in 1957 Bishop published her English translation of the book. Bishop says that she was drawn to Brant's work because of Brant's impressive skills of observation and ability to recreate a scene using only words. Some have compared Brant's work to Jane Austen that even though she was from a small town in Brazil, its style is like work from England.

Despite being born to peasant parents, Anyona rose to prominence in the Kenyan political landscape to be thrice elected to the Kenyan Parliament representing the people of Kitutu East (later renamed Kitutu Masaba) constituency. He shared an ideological viewpoint and was a close political confidant of the first Vice- President of Kenya, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga. Anyona's name remains dominant among Kenya's political personalities because he is perceived by a large section of Kenyans as a brave man, who was strong enough to challenge the Kenya African National Union (KANU) government at a time when it was almost suicidal to do so. He forged a reputation as a principled politician who championed free expression of thought, democracy and a just and equal society. He lived a modest life, never seeking to enrich himself from the offices he held and abhorred the culture of corruption and worship of money that prevailed in the country.  Early life  Anyona was born in 1945 in Tombe Village, Kitutu Masaba, Kenya. He attended Tombe Primary School from 1952 to 1954 and Sengera Intermediate School from 1955 to 1958 before proceeding to the prestigious Alliance High School where he schooled from 1959 to 1964 and served as Deputy School Captain. From Alliance, he proceeded to Makerere University, Uganda where he studied Political Science, English, Economics and History between 1965 and 1968, graduating with Bachelor of Arts (Hons) and serving as President of the Kenya Makerere Students Union in 1967. Upon returning from Uganda, Anyona worked as an Assistant Secretary in the Office of the President between 1968-1970, as the Secretary General of the Kenya Red Cross Society in 1970 and as Nairobi Airport Manager then District Sales Manager for British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) later renamed British Airways in Nairobi from 1970 to 1974.  Rise to politics  In 1974, he contested and won the then Kitutu East Parliamentary seat. He quickly established a reputation as a fearless firebrand and for thorough research before presenting issues in parliament, coming to be referred to as a 'one-man backbench' after parliament was neutered following the murder of JM Kariuki and the detention of then Deputy Speaker and Tinderet MP Jean Marie Seroney and Butere MP Martin Shikuku. Anyona's political troubles began in 1977 when he was arrested within the precincts of parliament (an illegality in itself) for questioning the award of a tender for the supply of wagons to the then East African Railways and Harbours Corporation and detained without trial at Manyani Prison by then President Jomo Kenyatta. He was released a year later by President Daniel arap Moi soon after he assumed power following the death of President Kenyatta. His attempts to resume representative politics were thwarted when he was barred from contesting his old parliamentary seat in the 1979 General Elections and from contesting trade union elections as a candidate for the post of Secretary General of the Transport and Allied Workers Union in 1980. Anyona would again be arrested in 1981 and charged with sedition but the charges were eventually withdrawn by the state. In 1982, this time with his longtime friend and veteran politician Jaramogi Oginga Odinga and several others , he attempted to form a political party Kenya African Socialist Alliance (KASA) to challenge the ruling party KANU.REPORT FROM TROUBLED KENYA http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/PI/lib00187,0EB2944A57B605E3.html. He was arrested on the way to the Intercontinental Hotel Nairobi to hold a press conference to announce the formation of the party and was detained without trial on 2 June 1982 and incarcerated at Kamiti and Shimo La Tewa Prisons; Jaramogi was later placed under house arrest in August 1982. Anyona was also expelled from the ruling party KANU. Shortly after Anyona was detained, his lawyer John Khaminwa was also detained without trial and a crackdown followed that targeted university lecturers, student leaders, politicians, lawyers and journalists. KANU, sensing the danger the two politicians had posed, immediately sought to change the constitution. The result was the passing of a constitutional amendment making Kenya a de facto one-party state the same year.http://web.peacelink.it/wajibu/18_issue/p1.html Anyona was released from detention in 1984 but his attempts to resume active politics were thwarted by the state when he was barred from contesting KANU branch elections in 1985, trade union elections in 1986, the Kitutu East (Masaba) parliamentary seat in the 1988 General Elections and Speaker of the National Assembly in 1988. He teamed up with his friend Jaramogi in 1990 during the clamour for multi-party democracy in Kenya; to many Kenyans, this was one battle Anyona and Jaramogi could not shy away from because they were the ones who started it in 1982. Anyona was however arrested at a Nairobi pub and charged with sedition. Others arrested with him included Professor Edward Oyugi, Isiah Ngotho Kariuki, and Augustus Njeru Kathangu.UNFAIR TRIAL FOR KENYAN CRITICS FEARED http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-28385081.html?refid=gg_x_02 The experiences they went through included torture at the infamous Nyayo House torture chambers in Nairobi. After a marathon trial, they were jailed for fifteen years running concurrently for seven years on charges of scheming to overthrow the Kenyan government and being in possession of seditious and proscribed publications.4 KENYANS FOUND GUILTY OF SEDITION http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/BG/lib00065,0EADDF6A5448C0BB.html According to some documents presented in the trial, it was alleged that Anyona had gone as far as preparing a shadow cabinet to take over after he overthrew the government. However, it was later revealed by an Assistant Minister in the Office of the President, John Keen, that these allegations were nothing but government fabrications, aimed at silencing Anyona. In 1992, after filing appeals against their sentences, the four were released on bail. On 20 May 1992, they were freed when the state opted not to oppose their appeals.  Multiparty era  With the multi-party elections coming up in December 1992, all opposition parties hoped Anyona would give them his endorsement. FORD- Kenya in particular, then under Jaramogi Oginga Odinga was seen as Anyona's perfect destination. He was elected the FORD-Kenya Nyamira District Branch Chairman in absentia. In a surprising move however, Anyona rejected FORD- Kenya's overtures, opting instead to launch his own political party Kenya Social Congress. In the 1992 Multi-Party General Elections, he easily won the Kitutu Masaba Constituency parliamentary seat, becoming the only member of parliament from the KSC. He also stood as a Presidential candidate in the same elections and came out 5th. He served as the Chairman of the Public Investments Committee (PIC) of the national assembly for 1993/1994 and was re- elected as a member of parliament in 1997 for another 5 year term. Anyona died on 4 November 2003 in a car crash on Lusaka Road in Nairobi.  Family  Anyona was married to Esther Mokeira and they were blessed with 5 children.

The film dramatizes events described in The Bible‚Äîthe tenth chapter of the First Kings and the ninth chapter of Second Chronicles. It starred Yul Brynner as Solomon and Gina Lollobrigida as Sheba; and features George Sanders as Adonijah, Marisa Pavan as Abishag, and David Farrar as the Pharaoh. The screenplay by Anthony Veiller, Paul Dudley, and George Bruce, was based on a story by Crane Wilbur. In February 2020, the film was shown at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival, as part of a retrospective dedicated to King Vidor's career. Plot The film's theme differs substantially from Biblical sources and is highly fictionalized, most notably in representing the Queen of Sheba as an ally of ancient Egypt in opposition to King Solomon of Israel, and in her having a love affair with Solomon. Under the rule of King David, Israel is united and prosperous, although surrounded by enemies, including Egypt and its allies. The aging King favours Solomon to succeed him, but his elder brother Adonijah (George Sanders), a warrior, declares himself King. When David learns of this, he publicly announces Solomon to be his successor. Adonijah and Joab, his general, withdraw in rage, but Solomon later offers his brother the command of the army, knowing that Adonijah may use it against him. Israel continues to prosper under Solomon's rule. The Queen of Sheba (Gina Lollobrigida) conspires with the Egyptian Pharaoh to undermine Solomon's rule by seducing him and introducing Sheban pagan worship into Jerusalem. Solomon is indeed bewitched by her, and the two begin living together under the pretense of forming an alliance between their two kingdoms. The king's reputation is damaged, but at the same time Sheba‚Äîwho sees the king's wisdom in the Judgment of Solomon‚Äîbegins to truly fall in love with him and regret her plotting. Things come to a head when Solomon recklessly allows a Sheban 'love festival' (in fact an orgy in celebration of a pagan god Almaqah) to be held within Israel. In an act of divine retribution, lightning from heaven destroys the Sheban altar and damages the newly built Temple in Jerusalem, and the land is beset with a deadly famine. Solomon is publicly rebuked by the people; the High Priest and Nathan the Prophet disown him. Meanwhile, Adonijah, banished by his brother after an assassination attempt, goes and strikes a bargain with Pharaoh; given an army, he will conquer Israel for Egypt, in exchange for being placed on the throne as a kind of viceroy. The tiny army mustered by Solomon (who has been abandoned by his allied states) is quickly routed, and Adonijah presses on to Jerusalem and makes himself king. Meanwhile, Sheba, now a believer in the power of the God of Israel, prays for Solomon to be redeemed and restored to power as Nathan the Prophet overhears. Pursued by the Egyptians, who were sent to finish him off, Solomon thereafter devises a plan. He lines up the remnants of his army on a hill, prompting the enemy to charge. The Israelites, who have arranged themselves to face east, then use their highly polished shields to reflect the light of the rising sun into the Egyptians' eyes. Blinded, the Egyptians are prevented from seeing the chasm in front of which the Israelites have positioned themselves, and the entire army rushes headlong over the edge and falls to its death. Meanwhile, Adonijah, met with a tepid reaction to his coup, tries to stir up Jerusalem's population by ordering the stoning of Sheba. Midway through this hideous display, Solomon makes a triumphant return to the city. Adonijah attacks his brother, refusing to be deprived again of his throne, but is himself struck down. Joab, in retaliation, attempts to attack Solomon, but is struck down by Solomon's faithful retainers Josiah and Ahab. At Solomon's prayer Sheba is miraculously healed of her wounds; as he resumes his power, she returns to her homeland, now pregnant by Solomon.

The following year Julius Epstein was writing a script for Small which was going to be produced by the team of Clarence Greene and Russell Rouse (who often made movies under Small's supervision). Small then announced he was developing the project with Arthur Hornblow Jr. and in 1955 Gina Lollobrigida was signed. United Artists agreed to distribute the following year. Small provided 75% of the film's anticipated $6 million budget, with United Artists provided 25%. Lollobrigida came on board as financial partner, getting a percentage of the profits. The role of Solomon was initially turned down by Tyrone Power and Yul Brynner; however, Power agreed to accept the part after the script was rewritten. Power's involvement meant the film became a co- production with Power's Copa Productions, headed by Ted Richmond. In the interim, Small and Hornblow had made Witness for the Prosecution together which was a hit but they decided to end their partnership. Small went into co- production with Copa Productions, with Hornblow retaining a financial interest. The film was shot in Madrid and Valdespartera, Zaragoza, Spain. Production began on 15 September 1958, aiming for a mid-December finish. =Death of Tyrone Power= Two thirds of the movie had been shot and the unit was in Madrid when on 15 November Tyrone Power filmed a duel scene with George Sanders, who played his brother. (The two had also filmed a sword fight in the 1942 film The Black Swan.) The duel had to be repeated several times. Power finally dropped the sword and said he couldn't continue, complaining of a pain in his left arm. He was helped to his dressing room and given brandy. It is unclear what happened next, as stories differ. In one scenario, he was taken to the hospital in Gina Lollabrigida's car and died. Another scenario is that Power died in his dressing room. In order to keep his jaw from dropping, a scarf was put around his neck to \\"walk\\" him out of the studio to the car. This was done in part because Mrs. Power was at the hotel and knew nothing about what happened. Ted Richmond gave orders that no press was to be called, and Mrs. Power was not to be called. He died en route to the hospital. Mrs. Power was escorted to the hospital. A memorial service was held on 16 November at US Torrejon Air Force Base. Production of the movie was halted. Because love scenes remained to be shot, another actor would have to be cast if the existing script was to be used; battle sequences had been filmed, but most of these could still be used, with close ups of the new actor added. Other possibilities discussed including rewriting the script to use Power's footage, or use Power for the first half of the movie (as \\"young Solomon\\"), then recasting another actor as Solomon for the second half. The issue was complicated by the fact that three different parties had full script, star and director approval: Small, Copa Productions, and Gina Lollobrigida. On 16 November Small offered the part of Solomon to Yul Brynner, a friend of Power, and the actor accepted. This meant Brynner had to delay playing the lead role in Spartacus, to which he had committed. However United Artists had not been told of Brynner's casting and were unsure of the conditions which had been granted to him. Ted Richmond wanted to pull out of producing and for a time there was some doubt if the film would go ahead at all. Another option was to cancel Solomon and Sheba altogether: the production was insured up to $3 million in the case of the death of one of the six lead players; Lloyd's of London covered the daily $100,000 bill while the film was halted. However, in the end it was decided to proceed with Brynner in the role of Solomon. The film was eventually completed over ten weeks after much difficulty with an estimated cost of $6 million. It was felt that this was relatively inexpensive, considering the scale of the movie; and Spain increasingly became a basis for Hollywood movies. Release Solomon and Sheba received its world premiere on 27 October 1959 at the Astoria Theatre, Charing Cross Road, London, where it was presented in 70mm. =Critical reception= Solomon and Sheba received indifferent to negative reviews and Yul Brynner's performance was criticized by no less than the film's director, King Vidor, who stated that Tyrone Power had been much more believable as a conflicted king than Brynner, who apparently played it with too much self-assurance. Variety, however, praised some of the film's sequences as \\"magnificent production scenes\\", and described Lollobrigida as showing \\"the queen to be a woman of sharp brain as well as sensual beauty.\\" The magazine also stated that Brynner \\"does a fine job in presenting a Solomon who credibly suggests a singer of songs, yet finally is a man of ordinary flesh and blood who cannot resist Sheba.\\" =Box office= The film was a box office success, earning an estimated $5.5 million in North American rentals,\\"All-Time Top Grossers\\", Variety, 8 January 1964 p 69 with a total gross of $12.2 million.

A simple example of such a magma may be derived from the children's game of rock, paper, scissors. Such magmas give rise to non-associative algebras.  A commutative non-associative magma derived from the rock, paper, scissors game  Let M := \\\\\\\\{ r, p, s \\\\\\\\} , standing for the \\"rock\\", \\"paper\\" and \\"scissors\\" gestures respectively, and consider the binary operation \\\\cdot : M \\\\times M \\\\to M derived from the rules of the game as follows: : For all x, y \\\\in M: :* If x eq y and x beats y in the game, then x \\\\cdot y = y \\\\cdot x = x :* x \\\\cdot x = x I.e. every x is idempotent. : So that for example: :* r \\\\cdot p = p \\\\cdot r = p \\"paper beats rock\\"; :* s \\\\cdot s = s \\"scissors tie with scissors\\". This results in the Cayley table: : \\\\begin{array}{cccc} \\\\cdot & r & p & s\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline r & r & p & r\\\\\\\\\\\\ p & p & p & s\\\\\\\\\\\\ s & r & s & s \\\\end{array} By definition, the magma (M, \\\\cdot) is commutative, but it is also non- associative, as shown by: :r \\\\cdot (p \\\\cdot s) = r \\\\cdot s = r but :(r \\\\cdot p) \\\\cdot s = p \\\\cdot s = s i.e. :r \\\\cdot (p \\\\cdot s) eq (r \\\\cdot p) \\\\cdot s  Other examples  The \\"mean\\" operation x \\\\oplus y = ( x + y ) / 2 on the rational numbers (or any commutative number system closed under division) is also commutative but not in general associative, e.g. :-4 \\\\oplus (0 \\\\oplus +4) = -4 \\\\oplus +2 = -1 but :(-4 \\\\oplus 0) \\\\oplus +4 = -2 \\\\oplus +4 = +1 Generally, the mean operations studied in topology need not be associative. The construction applied in the previous section to rock-paper-scissors applies readily to variants of the game with other numbers of gestures, as described in the section Variations, as long as there are two players and the conditions are symmetric between them; more abstractly, it may be applied to any trichotomous binary relation (like \\"beats\\" in the game). The resulting magma will be associative if the relation is transitive and hence is a (strict) total order; otherwise, if finite, it contains directed cycles (like rock-paper-scissors-rock) and the magma is non-associative. To see the latter, consider combining all the elements in a cycle in reverse order, i.e. so that each element combined beats the previous one; the result is the last element combined, while associativity and commutativity would mean that the result only depended on the set of elements in the cycle. The bottom row in the Karnaugh diagram above gives more example operations, defined on the integers (or any commutative ring).  Derived commutative non-associative algebras  Using the rock-paper-scissors example, one can construct a commutative non- associative algebra over a field K: take A to be the three-dimensional vector space over K whose elements are written in the form :(x, y, z) = x r + y p + z s, for x, y, z \\\\in K. Vector addition and scalar multiplication are defined component-wise, and vectors are multiplied using the above rules for multiplying the elements r, p, s. The set :\\\\\\\\{ (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1) \\\\\\\\} i.e. \\\\\\\\{ r, p, s \\\\\\\\} forms a basis for the algebra A. As before, vector multiplication in A is commutative, but not associative. The same procedure may be used to derive from any commutative magma M a commutative algebra over K on K ^ M, which will be non-associative if M is.

History Shortly after being awarded the contract for the current Spirit of Gosport in 2001, Abels Shipbuilders were awarded a follow-on contract for a second ferry, which was to be known as Spirit of Portsmouth. However this vessel was only partially constructed when the ferry company cancelled the order, and the unfinished hull remained at Abel's shipyard for many years, before being completed as a medical missionary ship, the Forth Hope. The need for a second vessel to run alongside the similar Spirit of Gosport still existed, and the current Spirit of Portsmouth was built in 2005. She is primarily used for cruising Portsmouth Harbour and the Solent, thus enabled Spirit of Gosport to replace Portsmouth Queen on the Gosport to Portsmouth ferry route. The main difference between the two Spirit of vessels is the covered roof and bar on Spirit of Portsmouth, making her more suited to cruising. Spirit of Portsmouth however, services the ferry route when either Spirit of Gosport or the other ferry Harbour Spirit are out of service. Upon the introduction of Spirit of Portsmouth, the 1966-built Portsmouth Queen was withdrawn from service. The previous vessel that was dedicated to cruise duty was Solent Enterprise.

The religious significance of this lake is next to that of the Lake Manasarovar in Tibet. manimahesh lake view The lake is the venue of a highly revered pilgrimage trek undertaken during the month of August/September corresponding to the month of Bhadon according to Hindu calendar, on the eighth day of the New Moon period. It is known as the ‚ÄòManimahesh Yatra‚Äô. The Government of Himachal Pradesh has declared it as a state-level pilgrimage. There are two trekking routes to the lake. One is from Hadsar village that is mostly frequented by pilgrims and trekkers. This route is easier and have adequate arrangement for basic food and accommodation during the pilgrimage season. The other one is from village Holi, which is for the more adventurous ones. This route climbs up further and then descends to the lake, providing a beautiful view. There is no other habitation, except for a small village on this route. Legend According to one popular legend, it is believed that Lord Shiva created Manimahesh after he married Goddess Parvati, who is worshipped as Mata Girija. There are many legends narrated linking Lord Shiva and his show of displeasure through acts of avalanches and blizzards that occur in the region. Legend also mentions that Shiva performed penance on the banks of Manimahesh Lake. In the same vein, it is mentioned that Gaddis (Shepherd), the tribes of this region, adopted Lord Shiva as their deity. Gaddis are the people who reside in the Gaddi Valley which is the name of the upper regions of Ravi River where the Mount Chamba Kailash lies. Further, according to the legend, the Shiva, who lived in Mount Kailash, the highest mountain of the state, gifted the Gaddis with a Chuhali topi (pointed cap), which they wear traditionally along with their other dress of chola (coat) and dora (a long black cord about 10‚Äì15 m long). The Gaddis started calling the land of this mountainous region as 'Shiv Bhumi' (\\"Land of Shiva\\") and themselves as devotees of Shiva. The legend further states that before Shiva married Parvati at Lake Manasarovar and became the \\"universal parents of the universe\\", Shiva created the Mount Kailash in Himachal Pradesh and made it his abode. He made Gaddis his devotees. The land where Gaddis lived extended from west of Bharmaur, upstream of the confluence of Budhil and Ravi rivers, up to Manimahesh. Manimahesh was also considered the abode of the three Lords of the universe namely, Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma. Manimahesh was reckoned as the heaven (Kaliasa) of Lord Shiva. The waterfall seen at the Dhancho on the way to Manimahesh Lake, and which emanates from the lake, was considered as the heaven (Vaikunta) of Vishnu. The heaven of Bramha is cited as a mound overlooking the Bharmaur city. The Gaddis also believe that Shiva resides in the Mount Kailash for six months, whereafter he moves to the netherworld handing over the reigns to Lord Vishnu. The day he departs to the netherworld is observed by the Gaddis reverentially every year, which is the Janmashtami day, the eighth day of the month of Bhadon (August), the birthday of Lord Krishna (an incarnation of Lord Vishnu). Shiva returned from the netherworld to Bharamaur at the end of February, before the night of his wedding and this day is observed as the Shivratri day; Gaddis observe this also as a festive day since Shiva and Parvati returned to Mount Kailash in the Gaddi land. Etymology of 'Manimahesh' signifies a \\"jewel (Mani) on Lord Shiva's (Mahesh's) crown\\". According to a local legend, the moon-rays reflected from the jewel can be seen from Manimahesh Lake on clear full moon night (which is a rare occasion). However, it has been inferred that such a phenomenon could be the result of reflection of light from the glacier that embellishes the peak in the form of a serpent around Shiva's neck. A legend in which Lord Shiva himself is tricked is narrated. According to this narration linked to Dhancho where pilgrims spend a night on their way to Manimahesh Lake, Lord Shiva, pleased with the devotion of one of his ardent devotees Bhasmasur (an asura or demon) bestowed a boon, which gave powers to Bhasmasur under which Bhasmasur touching anyone would reduce that person to ashes. Bhasmasur wanted to try this boon on Shiva himself. He, therefore, followed Shiva to touch him and get rid of him. However, Shiva managed to escape and enter into the waterfall at Dhancho and take shelter in a cave behind the rolling waters of the fall. Bhasmasur could not get through the waterfall. Then, Lord Vishnu intervened and killed Bhasamasur. Since then the fall is considered holy A rare event of the first sun‚Äôs rays falling on the Mani Mahesh peak is seen in reflection in the lake like saffron tilak. This display in the lake has enhanced the legendary belief of the Gaddis on the sanctity of Manimahesh Lake at the base of the Mount Kailash, which they visit on an annual pilgrimage. This event has also contributed to the practice of taking bath in the lake on Janmashtami day or Radhashtami day, fifteen days after the birth of Lord Krishna. Geography A small lake with pilgrims living in tents during the annual - Manimahesh Yatra The lake, of glacial origin, is in the upper reaches of the Ghoi nala(refer Leomann maps:India Himalaya Map 4) which is tributary of Budhil river, a tributary of the Ravi River in Himachal Pradesh. However, the lake is the source of a tributary of the Budhil River, known as ‚ÄòManimahesh Ganga‚Äô. The stream originates from the lake in the form of a fall at Dhancho. The mountain peak is a snow clad tribal glen of Brahamur in the Chamba district of manimahesh range. The highest peak is the Mani Mahesh Kailas, also called ‚ÄòChamba Kailash' (elevation ) overlooking the lake. The lake, considered a glacial depression, is sourced by snow-melt waters from the surrounding hill slopes. Towards the end of June with ice beginning to melt, numerous small streams break up everywhere, which together with the lush green hills and the myriad of flowers give the place a truly remarkable view. The snow field at the base of the mountain is called by the local people as Shiva‚Äôs Chaugan Shiva's playground. According to a belief, Lord Shiva stayed here with his consort Parvati. Manimahesh is approached from three routes. Pilgrims from Lahaul and Spiti pass through Kugti pass. Pilgrims from Kangra and Mandi take the Karwarsi pass or Jalsu pass via Tyari village, near Holi in Bharmour. The easiest and popular route is from Chamba via Bharmour. The most popular is the Bhanrlour‚ÄìHadsar-Manimahesh route which involves a track from Hadsar village to the Manimahesh Lake. The highest altitude touched in this route is and it takes two days with an overnight stay at Dhancho. Season to be undertaken is June to October and it has a gentle grade. The path leading to the lake is well maintained. Halfway up this track is of open and flat meadow land to Dhancho. Tented accommodation is available here during August‚ÄìSeptember. Night halt is preferred here. Free kitchens are opened by people to feed pilgrims. But many prefer to go and pitch their tents next to the lake to feel a divine experience. En route, there is waterfall at Gauri Nallah known as the Dhancho fall. From Dhancho, it is a steep climb. This track has seen lot of improvements over the years. In the past the first climb was first done by crossing Dhancho nalla. It was so tough that people used to crawl to get across. Since they used to crawl like a monkey in this stretch it was known as 'Bandar Ghati' (monkey valley). Now this track is much improved and the newly constructed path is used. However, some still prefer to take the old route as an adventure and go through the Bandar Ghati. In the past, on the trek from Dhancho, the bridge over the Mani Mahesh river was crossed to reach the left bank of the valley. After , the river was again crossed, over another wooden bridge, to the right bank. From this point, the climb passes through many zigzag paths along flowered meadows. Birch trees are seen in the vicinity, which indicates a gain in altitude as the trek proceeds. Along this stretch of the trek route, there are a number community kitchens (eateries) at about elevation. From this location, the trail to Mani Mahesh Lake could be discerned. The waterfall, flowing from the lake, is also seen at this stage. A further trek of through the grassy ridges leads to the Manimahesh Lake. Lake and its precincts Even though the Manimahesh Lake is of small size with shallow depth, its location, directly below Manimahesh Kailas peak and several other peaks and dangling glaciers, is an \\"inspiration even to the least devout pilgrim.\\" Trekking in the last reach is through the glacier fields of the lake. However, on the way, the walk is through the valley of flowers and wild medicinal herbs up to the lake. The lake is situated at the centre of a snowy field touching the sacred peak. The lake is surrounded by sandy boulders, small hilly mounds and prickly dry bushes, and there is no sign of any grass. It is called Shiv Chaugan (play ground of Lord Shiva). The lake appears as if it has penetrated the rugged valley. On a clear day the reflection of the abode of Shiva, the Kailash Mountain can be seen on the lake surface. All the year round, the place remains desolate, without any inhabitants, because none dares to stay here. The air is fresh but icy cold. There are almost no fauna in the lake at its precincts ‚Äì no ants, snakes or any kind of wild life. A few Bird species are sighted rarely. The silence of the place is broken only when the pilgrims visit the place in large numbers, an evening before the holy dip (locally known as naun) in the lake.Yadav, p.55‚Äì57 According to legend, Lord Shiva performed penance for several hundred years here. The water cascades sprang out from his matted hair and took the form of the lake. The lake as formed appears like a saucer. It has two distinct parts. The larger part has icy cold water, called the 'Shiv Karotri' (the bathing place of Lord Shiva). The smaller part of the lake, which is hidden by the bushes, has lukewarm water and is called 'Gauri Kund', the bathing place of Parvati, Shiva's consort. Thus, men and women bathe in different parts of the lake. According to rites, the dip (called locally as naun) in the lake is taken four times, if permitted or otherwise only once. In the periphery of the lake, now there is a marble image of Lord Shiva, which is worshipped by pilgrims. The image is called the Chaumukha. The lake and its surroundings present an impressive view. The still, clear and unpolluted waters of the lake reflect the snow- capped peaks that overlook the valley. There is also a small temple in the shikhara style on the periphery of the lake. A brass image of Lakshmi Devi known as Mahishasuramardini is deified in the temple. Pilgrimage The holy pilgrimage to the Manimahesh Lake (revered by local people as resting place of Lord Shiva) is supported by the Government of Himachal Pradesh, Manimahesh Pilgrimage Committee and several voluntary organizations. For the Gaddi tribal population of the region, pilgrimage to the lake is most holy. It is held every year during the Hindu month of Badon on Radhastami, the 15th day following the festival of Janmashtami, corresponding to the Gregorian month of August or September. The Yatra or Jatra, as it is called, is also popularly known as the 'Manimahesh Yatra'.\\"What precautions should be taken while traveling to Manimahesh\\" It is heralded by a procession known locally as \\"holy chhari\\" (holy stick carried by the pilgrims on their shoulders) trek undertaken by pilgrims and sadhus. Pilgrims undertake the holy trek barefoot and cover a distance of from the nearest road point of HadsarVillage Hadsar in Chamba district to the Manimahesh Lake. Lord Shiva is the presiding deity of the yatra. The colorful procession of the \\"chhari\\" is accompanied by singing and recitation of hymns in praise of Lord Shiva. The Chhari trek, considered a tough trek, follows a set ancient route with stops at the designated places. To facilitate this trek, pilgrims are provided with facilities of transport (jeeps up to road ends), food and medical facilities and so forth. It is a two-day trek to the lake from Hadsar with a night halt at Dhanchho. Tents are available for hire at Bharmour or Chamba, Himachal Pradesh. Ponies are hired by some devotees for the trek. Direct trekking from Chamba is also an option undertaken by the devout, which is a nine-day trek; the route followed is Rakh (), Bharmaur, Hadsar (), Dhancho () and Manimahesh () with a brief halt at Bhiram Ghati. The return trip follows the same route. The holy trek starts from the Laxmi Narayan temple and the Dashnami Akhara in Chamba town, with the sacred stick ('Chhari') of Gur Charpathnath carried by the pilgrims with participation of sadhus. The trek to the lake takes about 6 days. After the procession arrives at the lake, ceremonies are held all through the night. On the following day, pilgrims take a holy dip (naun) in the lake. After taking bath in the holy waters of the lake, pilgrims circumambulate the lake three times as an act of reverence, seeking blessings of the Lord Shiva. However, before taking a final dip in the Mani Mahesh Lake, women devotees take a dip at the Gauri Khund, which is situated about a mile short of the lake while men take bath at Shiv Karotri a part of the main lake. The belief is that Parvati, Shiva‚Äôs consort bathed at the Gauri Khund, while Shiva took his bath at the Shiv Karotri. State priests of Bharmaur Brahmin family perform the worship (Pujas) in all temples within the lake precincts.

She later studied at the Leningrad State Institute of Theater, Music and Cinematography and was active in the underground art community. In 1964, she was arrested and served a term of forced labor. Her first poems were published in 1966; some through official channels, but mostly through samizdat. She was baptized in 1973. Over the next few years, she was a regular participant in demonstrations and hunger strikes on behalf of her fellow creative artists. In 1976, she assisted in the creation of the samizdat literary journal ' (Hours). That same year, she was sentenced to five years of exile for Anti-Soviet Propaganda. After breaking exile to attend the trial of Yuly Rybakov, she was sentenced to two years of imprisonment. In 1980 she emigrated to Germany with her two sons, living first in Frankfurt-am-Main, then Munich, where she worked for Radio Liberty. From 1996 to 1999 she lived in the in Chauvincourt- Provemont, Normandy, France. From 2002 until her death on 20 February 2015 she lived in Berlin. Works Her works include The Star Chernobyl, about three sisters involved in the Chernobyl disaster; and her first novel, The Women's Decameron, about ten pregnant women in a maternity ward who are quarantined for ten days and - inspired by The Decameron - decide to tell ten stories each day, about life in 1980s Russia.

Her book series \\"The Yulianna\\" is sometimes classified as anti-Potter since it is a children's series that supports the Christian faith instead of witchcraft and magic. It tells the story of twin girls separated at birth and posits a Christian view of spiritual battle where angels and demons are real and prayer and Christian life or selfishness and giving in to temptation have real spiritual causes or results, and how prayer really can be 'magic'. Probably her most popular book is the first of a two-part series, called \\"Cassandra's Path, or Adventures with Macaroni\\", a science fiction apocalyptic view from the Christian perspective of the last days, and of one woman's journey to faith.

It is the first SM Supermall in the country, the largest shopping mall in the Philippines and the eighth largest shopping mall in the world. The SM City North EDSA mall is operated by SM Prime Holdings. It used to have a gross floor area of 120,000 square meters in the past when it was opened on November 8, 1985, a challenging period in the Philippines' political history with the EDSA Revolution just months away. The mall's redevelopment began with the opening of The Block in July 2006. Among the developments were a new Annex building which opened in December 2008 and Sky Garden which opened in May 2009. The Car Park Plaza transformed into a lifestyle center in 2009. SM City North EDSA, a work in progress with the renovation of the City Center, and the development of the North Link. History Old facade of The Block with the Sky Garden under-construction in the foreground. SM City North EDSA was built on a land which was then a marshland in a relatively remote location amidst a political crisis which saw interest rates to rise as high as 45 percent. The lot was previously owned by the Government Service Insurance System and originally intended to be used to host houses for public school teachers. The mall opened on November 8, 1985. It was the first mall built by SM Prime Holdings Inc. and initially only had SM's fifth department store and first supermarket as its tenants. At that time it had a gross floor area of 23 square meters. As more tenants and entertainment venues were added, SM City North EDSA then came to be known as the mall that institutionalized the \\"one- stop\\" shopping concept in the Philippines. It was the first to introduce \\"malling\\" as a pastime in the Philippines. A four-level carpark, also known as the Annex 1, was constructed in February 1988. The lower ground floor was converted into an enclosed retail space. Another level was also added on the main mall. On July 28, 1989, a two-floor annex, also known as the original \\"Annex 2\\", was built providing more leasable space, a bowling alley and four additional movie houses. The main building and the annexes were expanded with a lower ground level, and the first level of The Carpark Plaza was converted into Cyberzone, a section reserved mainly for technology and gadget retail. Over the years, SM City North EDSA had seen many expansions and redevelopment, including the construction of Annex 3, which opened in 2006. On July 28, 2006, Annex 3, also known as The Block, was opened featuring a hypermarket, its flagship toy store, additional four movie theaters, retail shops, and restaurants. On February 8, 2007, as part of its massive redevelopment plan, the original Annex 2 was completely demolished and construction of a new building started. The current Annex 2 was reopened on December 12, 2008. On May 2009, The Sky Garden was opened to the public, featuring its linear park garden and a 1,500-seater Sky Dome. In 2011, the six-story structure Annex 4, known as the North Link, was completed, housing BPO companies and retail stores. For two years (2014-2016), SM City North EDSA was the largest solar- powered shopping mall in Southeast Asia after installing 5,760 solar panels until that record was surpassed in May 2016 by the Robinsons Starmills Pampanga in San Fernando, Pampanga. SM City North EDSA Complex Since its inception in 1985, and the construction of the original Car Park Plaza in February 1988 and the second Annex Building in July 1989, SM City North EDSA Complex's current edifice within the complex are composed of the City Center, Interior Zone (including the Car Park Plaza), The Annex, The Block, The Sky Garden, The Northlink, and The North Towers. The complex has further expanded beyond which is interconnected by a series of footbridges linked to different sides of the main mall structure. =Main mall complex= City Center (Main Building) City Center Opened on November 8, 1985, the original building consisted of only three floors. Its original structure has evolved through the years. The City Center has a total of 190,000 gross floor area. Its fourth floor has recently been added to keep up with demand. The newly renovated city center has spherical skylights. As the hub of the retail complex, the City Center has various retail establishments, including the mall's main anchors: The SM Store (formerly SM Department Store) and SM Supermarket. It is also the hub of leisure anchors such as SM Foodcourt, an entertainment center, and a newly modernized cineplex that incorporate the country's second IMAX Theater. The main dining establishments of the City Center are situated on the second level where they break through the frontage in a sequence of linear casements which overlook the Sky Garden.SM earmarks P360 M to open 3 more IMAX theaters at malls  The Manila Bulletin Newspaper Online.

The original structure was a four-level parking lot. In the early 2000s the open-parking area right beside it were built up and made into its horizontal expansion to accommodate more vehicles and to integrate the newly constructed The Block. In the 2010s the building was expanded vertically by two floors via a steel structure that also integrated rooftop solar panels. The Car Park Plaza features the first outlet of the Cyberzone that was later moved to The Annex building and additional 8,000 parking slots. The building is connected to the main mall with a footbridge located on the second floor.

He was the eldest son of lieutenant colonel Fredrik Anders J√§gerhorn and Ulrika Sofia Brunow. Colonel Fredrik Adolf J√§gerhorn, vice commander of the Sveaborg fortress in 1808 was Johan Anders' brother. Life The J√§gerhorn af Spurila noble family tree can be documented to 15th century Finland with legends - inspired by the Song of Roland - going back to the 12th century when Swedish crusader king Eric the Saint of Sweden came to Finland and made an early ancestor of the family squire of the king. Johan Anders J√§gerhorn was a military officer with the rank of major in the Swedish army and lieutenant colonel in the Russian army 1789. As a participant in an officers‚Äô plot against the Swedish king in Finland 1788, J√§gerhorn advocated sovereignty for Finland. Condemned to death by the Swedes on the ground of treason, he was exiled to Germany. In Hamburg he befriended Lord Edward FitzGerald and acted as an intermediary between the Irish and the French before the rebellion of 1798. After two years‚Äô imprisonment (1799‚Äì1801) in the Tower of London, he returned to Finland and was instrumental in shaping the constitution of newly autonomous Finland. After having been part of the Swedish kingdom for more than 600 years, Finland became an autonomous Russian Grand Duchy in 1809. J√§gerhorn was thus one of the historical originators of Finnish independence. Finland declared independence on 6 December 1917. Johan Anders J√§gerhorn was the founder and leader of a secret order called Walhalla-orden with its seat in the Suomenlinna fortress. He was married to Ulrika Sofia Blomcreutz of Swedish nobility in 1783. J√§gerhorn died in Porvoo, Finland on 6 March 1825. His only two daughters had died at early age in tragic accidents. Legacy In 1981, Minister Desmond O'Malley of Ireland unveiled a commemorative plaque adorning J√§gerhorn's house in Porvoo, Finland and stated: \\"If this man has spent 2 years of prison for the independence of Ireland, he is indeed worthy of this plaque.\\"  Sources  *Bruno Lesch: Jan Anders J√§gerhorn, - Patriot och v√§rldsmedborgare, separatist och emigrant.

He is best known for his activity as a leader (with friend Isatay Taymanuly) of rebellions against Russian colonialism. This activity is believed to have resulted in his murder in 1846. His first rebellions took place against Zhangir-Kerey Khan of the Bukey Horde. Because the rebellion was badly defeated and a bounty was placed on Utemisov, he had to flee the region. Makhambet's early education took place at a Russian language school in Orenburg. However, his poetry was more closely tied to Kazakh culture and literary tradition. The major themes of his poetry were of two types: political criticism of Russia or the khan, or more general poetry devoted to themes about human existence and life.

Plot Buppah Rahtree is a loner female student at a Bangkok university who becomes the object of a wager by a group of male students to see if she can be bedded. Ake, the son of a wealthy family, takes the bet and courts young Buppah. She resists him at first, but one day sees him feeding pigeons in a park and talks to him. After she expresses her desire to fly away, they go on a ride in Ake's convertible. They continue to have a relationship, which culminates in a three-day weekend at Bang Saen, during which Ake has sex with her; he stays in bed with her the whole time. Ake shows videotapes of their sex to his friends, and for his efforts wins a bottle of Johnnie Walker, which he reflects to himself seems like a trivial prize for messing up another person's life. Ake breaks off all contact with Buppah. After her stepfather gives her a car ride, he takes her to a short-time hotel and sexually assaults her. She stabs him with a fountain pen he gaver her as a present and runs home to her apartment. Depressed, she contemplates suicide but is interrupted by a phone call from Ake, who wants to meet her. Ake tells her about the wager and apologizes. Though he plans to leave Thailand to study in England, he hopes to maintain their friendship. Buppah informs Ake she is two months' pregnant. Ake's mother tells him to convince Buppah to have an abortion. After the operation, he drives her back to her apartment, and it is obvious she is in pain. Ake leaves to get rice congee but does not return. After unsuccessfully attempting to collect rent, Buppah's landlady breaks into the apartment, where she discovers Buppah's corpse; Buppah bled to death due to complications from the abortion. When the authorities arrive, Buppah revives, and her vengeful spirit refuses to be dislodged. Mrs. See calls upon Maew, a false shaman who hustles locals, to exorcise the spirit. When he fails, Maew convinces his teacher, Master Tong, to try. For his effort, Master Tong is left with a knife in his back. A pair of Roman Catholic priests perform an exorcism, only to end up curse at and vomited upon by the ghost. As Buppah haunts the building, residents leave in droves, ruining Mrs. See's finances. In England, Ake grows homesick and has turned to drug use. He returns to Thailand and offers to bring Buppah rice congee. Ake catches the eye of Muay, a young woman at the congee stand. Muay seduces Ake and has him take her to an old cinema, where they have sex. When Ake returns to Buppah's apartment, he has forgotten the congee. Buppah knows that Ake has cheated on her, and for his transgression, she amputates his legs. Muay comes to the apartment to find Ake. Buppah takes possession of Muay's body and compels Muay to cut her own legs off. Mrs. See recruits a genuine shaman from Cambodia. The shaman and his men come to the apartment just as Muay is being possessed. They put a spirit cloth over Ake and on Buppah's corpse. Through a prayer, the shaman puts Buppah's spirit back into the corpse. They plan to take Buppah to a temple to be cremated, but on the way, the spirit cloth blows off the body, which is in the back of a pickup truck. Buppah takes control of the vehicle and causes it to crash into another truck. Muay, saddened by the turn of events, makes contact with Ake's father, who is angered and puzzled by the call. As it turns out, Ake has been dead for more than a month. Muay had sexual relations with Ake's ghost. Buppah returns to her apartment, where she will likely stay for eternity. Ake's ghost, now legless, sits outside in the hallway and apologizes to Buppah for the rest of his ghost eternity.

Biography  Brought up by a devout Roman Catholic mother, he lost his faith in his early teens, while still at the Lyc√©e in Sens. Among the factors that brought this about, one stood out in his own mind: at school religion was taught without life or understanding. Gh√©on did not miss it. As F. J. Sheed says, \\"His was a happy atheism.\\"F. J. Sheed. Sidelights on the Catholic Revival, New York: Sheed and Ward, 1940, p. 51. He replaced Catholicism with a semi-pagan cult of beauty in all its forms ‚Äî nature, literature, music, painting. He moved to Paris in 1893 to study medicine. Around the same time, he started to write poetry, along with his colleagues Francis Jammes and St√©phane Mallarm√©. He also published avant garde criticism. In 1887 he met Andr√© Gide, who became his literary guide and friend for twenty years. Gh√©on, writes Gide's biographer Alan Sheridan, \\"was Gide's closest friend and companion on innumerable homosexual exploits.\\"Alan Sheridan. Andr√© Gide: A Life in the Present, Harvard University Press, 1999, p. xiii. Ghƒóon actually drafted a militant text in favour of homosexuality, La Vie secr√®te de Guillaume Arnoult, which was one of the inspirations for Gide's Corydon.Fabrice Hadjadj. \\"Henri Gh√©on, un chr√©tien tourment√©\\", Le Figaro, 18 June 2008. In 1909 they were founding members of the Nouvelle Revue Fran√ßaise (NRF). Gh√©on also painted, studied music and travelled widely. It was the sceptic Gide who occasioned the first cracks in Gh√©on's paganism when he invited him to visit Florence with him in 1912. There Gh√©on discovered the religious art of Giotto and Fra Angelico and was overwhelmed to the point of shedding tears. \\"At St Mark's,\\" he wrote, \\"with Christ dying on the cross and the Virgin waiting for the angel in a bare and silent corridor..., even our senses had a soul. Art had transported me before, but never so high.\\"Dom Antoine Marie osb. \\"Henri Gh√©on\\", Letter of Saint-Joseph Abbey, May 13, 2008. He served as an army doctor in the First World War. During this period he regained his Catholic faith, as described in his work L'homme n√© de la guerre (The Man Born from the War). His conversion was bound up with a devoutly Catholic naval officer, Pierre Dominique Dupouey, whom he met only three times in the space of a few weeks, but who impressed him greatly. It was again Gide who was the occasion for this fateful encounter: when Gh√©on left for the Belgian front, Gide urged him to try to find Dupouey, who had once been his disciple and with whom he still corresponded. On Holy Saturday, 1915, Dupouey was killed in action on the Yser. By Christmas, Gh√©on had returned to the Catholic faith. He founded the \\"Compagnons de Notre Dame\\" (Companions of Our Lady), a sort of amateur theatre confraternity of young people, for which he wrote over 60 plays, usually on episodes from the Gospel or the lives of the saints. Gh√©on's plays had clear similarities with the medieval mystery and miracle plays. The Companions of Our Lady performed with success in Paris and throughout France, as well as in Belgium, Holland and Switzerland, and Gh√©on was awarded a prize for his work by the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. He also wrote poems, saints' biographies, and novels, among them a three-part work, Les Jeux de l'enfer et du ciel (Games of Hell and Heaven), centred on the Cur√® d'Ars. Gh√©on died of cancer in a Paris clinic on June 13, 1944, a week after the Allied landing in Normandy and six days after the opening of his most recent play, Saint Gilles. Reputation In 2008 the writer and philosopher Fabrice Hadjadj, reviewing Catherine Boschian-Campaner's biography of Gh√©onCatherine Boschian-Campaner. Henri Gh√©on, camarade de Gide: Biographie d'un homme de d√©sirs, Presses de la Renaissance, 2008. in Le Figaro, wrote, \\"Henri Ghƒóon is not a minor writer and his work speaks for itself. If his novels recall Dickens, his theatre loses nothing in comparison with Anouilh and Giraudoux. It was he alone who, in the first half of the 20th century, revived the popular burlesque and verticality of the medieval mystery plays, thus anticipating Dario Fo.\\" His Miroir de Peine was set to music by Hendrik Andriessen.

History Spirit of Gosport was built in 2001 to replace Portsmouth Queen on ferry duties. However, the company also wanted to replace Solent Enterprise, which operated cruise duties. The vessel was hardly used for the first few months and both existing ferries were kept in service. In 2003, she finally replaced Solent Enterprise on cruise duties. This continued until 2005, when a brand new vessel was purchased to replace Spirit of Gosport on cruise duties. Shortly after being awarded the contract for Spirit of Gosport, Abels were awarded a follow-on contract for a second ferry, to be known as Spirit of Portsmouth. However this vessel was only partially constructed when the ferry company cancelled the order, and the unfinished hull remained at Abel's shipyard for many years, before being completed as a medical missionary ship, the Forth Hope. This ship should not be confused with the subsequent Spirit of Portsmouth that now operates alongside the Spirit of Gosport.

He recruited Dr. Charles Drew to help develop the organization and its processes to get the plasma supply project operational. Their work was estimated to have helped save the lives of thousands of Allied troops. Early life Scudder was born to John and Ellen Bartholemew Scudder in 1900 in Brooklyn, New York. He attended Rutgers University before deciding to be a surgeon. He completed medical school at Columbia University, where he also did graduate-level work on blood research and surgical procedures for its use. His family was part of the Scudders in India, who devoted more than 1,100 combined years to Christian medical mission service. Four generations of the family and 42 members served in India. Career After obtaining his doctorate, Scudder began working and teaching at Columbia University- Presbyterian Hospital. There he worked in blood transfusion and surgery. He became an assistant professor of clinical surgery at Columbia University in 1935. He worked on research centering on whole blood, then on fractionated blood and plasmas. By 1940 he was doing research on blood fluid dynamics as well. Blood for Britain In late 1939, after World War II began in Europe, the Blood Transfusion Betterment Association (BTBA) of New York met with certain members of the British medical establishment about transfusion techniques. Plasma transfusion was possible at that time, but still experimental. No one had a good method for supplementing Britain's supplies with American blood plasma. This was crucial since, by all expectations, any war was expected to have the high casualties similar to those of World War I. The managers of the BTBA turned to Dr. Scudder to organize the project. He recruited Charles Drew, one of his brightest graduate students and recently minted PhD, to lead the project. During the course of Plasma for Britain, Scudder often assisted Drew in organizing and communicating with project managers and other medical authorities. When Plasma for Britain was turned over to the British Military, Scudder returned to his teaching and research position at Columbia. Later life Scudder continued research in fields related both to blood work and surgery. He published papers on shock syndrome, banked blood, and using chemicals and X-rays to map the cardiovascular system. He co-authored many papers. In the 1960s, when there was a conflict between the Red Cross and the for-profit American Association of Blood Banks, Scudder publicly supported the Red Cross.

When the user opens any program this will be counted as a process, and therefore requires the computer to allocate certain resources for it to be able to run. Such resources could have access to a section of the computer's memory, data in a device interface buffer, one or more files, or the required amount of processing power. A computer with a single processor can only perform one process at a time, regardless of the number of programs loaded by the user (or initiated on start-up). Computers using single processors appear to be running multiple programs at once because the processor quickly alternates between programs, processing what is needed in very small amounts of time. This process is known as multitasking or time slicing. The time allocation is automatic, however higher or lower priority may be given to certain processes, essentially giving high priority programs more/bigger slices of the processor's time. On a computer with multiple processors different processes can be allocated to different processors so that the computer can truly multitask. Some programs, such as Adobe Photoshop and YafRay, which can require intense processing power, have been coded so that they are able to run on more than one processor at once, thus running more quickly and efficiently. This method is generally suitable for multiprogramming environments and is actually very helpful.
