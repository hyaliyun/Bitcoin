It was formed in the 1935-1936, shortly after William Aberhart's supporters formed a Social Credit government in Alberta. While the party never won many seats in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba, it maintained a presence in the legislature for most of the period from 1936 to 1973. Origins In its earliest years, the Social Credit League took the form of a populist protest movement. Like other Social Credit parties in Canada, it eventually became as a party of conservatism while retaining an anti-establishment message. The party's leadership was consistently anti-socialist. The Social Credit Party ran 19 candidates in the provincial election of 1936, five of whom were elected. It did not have a leader during the election, but chose Stanley Fox to lead the parliamentary group shortly thereafter. During this period, the party supported the monetary reforms of Major Douglas, which Aberhart had been promoting in Alberta for several years. The 1936 election produced a minority government, with 23 Liberal-Progressives, 16 Conservatives, 7 Independent Labour Party members, the 5 Social Crediters and 4 others. After early talks for a Liberal-Progressive/Conservative coalition broke down, the Social Crediters made a surprise offer to keep the outgoing Liberal-Progressive government of John Bracken in power. Some party members may have hoped for a formal coalition, but this came to nothing and the party supported the government from the outside for the next four years. Fox stepped down as party leader in 1937, and was replaced by S.E. Rogers. World War II and coalition After the start of World War II, Bracken promoted a \\"non-partisan government\\" for Manitoba, in which all four major parties would hold cabinet portfolios in a demonstration of provincial unity. The plan was approved by the other parties, and Social Credit joined the government in late 1940. Social Credit Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Norman Turnbull was sworn in as a minister without portfolio on November 4, 1940, and served in this capacity until February 14, 1946. The decision to join government caused a split in the party. Salome Halldorson crossed the floor to sit as an Opposition Social Credit MLA and won the support of Alberta Socred Premier Ernest Manning as well as the Manitoba Social Credit League which officially expelled the four Social Credit MLAs who supported the government. Nevertheless, in the election of 1941, several Social Credit candidates ran in opposition to the coalition, while coalition supporters continued to call themselves Social Credit candidates. This division damaged the party's credibility with the electorate, and only three Social Credit candidates were elected: Fox, Turnbull and Rogers (all government supporters). Decline The party does not seem to have had a leader in the parliament which followed, and in fact became little more than an appendage of the Liberal-Conservative coalition as the 1940s progressed. Fox and Turnbull were re-elected in the 1945 election, but the party ran only two other candidates in the rest of the province. It completely lost its coherence as a parliamentary force in the late 1940s, and did not run any candidates in the 1949 election. The Social Credit Party re-emerged for the election of 1953: William Bullmore was elected in the constituency of Dauphin, and Gilbert Hutton won in Minnedosa. The party was again marginalized in the parliament which followed, however, and none of its candidates were elected in the provincial elections of 1958 and 1959. Although the Social Credit parties of Alberta and British Columbia had largely abandoned their monetary policies by this time, Bullmore and Hutton continued to promote social credit during their time in parliament. During the late 1940s and the 1950s, the President of the Manitoba Social Credit League was Wilbert James Tinkler. He was the closest that the party had to an official leader in this period, as neither Bullmore nor Hutton held an official role in the legislature. Tinkler ran for federal and provincial office on six occasions. Tinkler became the president of the Social Credit league at a time when it had only a minimal presence in the legislature, and a weak provincial organization. The party had joined the governing coalition of Premier John Bracken in 1940, and its parliamentary representation was subsequently regarded as little more than an adjunct to the province's Liberal-Conservative government. Several figures within the party had campaigned against the alliance in 1941, but all were defeated. The party's organization subsequently collapsed, and it offered no candidates for election in 1949. Social Credit did not have an official political leader between 1941 and at least 1959. Tinkler, as its leading official for most of this period, was not a prominent public figure, though he did help reconstruct some semblance of a provincial network for the party. He was replaced as party president by S.S. Hunt of Dauphin in late June 1953, but appears to have regained this title later in the decade. Tinkler continued to work in the party after Jacob Froese became its official leader following the 1959 election. Later years The party received another lease on life in November 1959, when Jacob Froese won a by- election in the riding of Rhineland. Froese remained a member of the legislature until the 1973 election, when he was defeated by a Progressive Conservative candidate. The party was unable to win any other seats, however, and Froese effectively acted as an independent MLA during his time in parliament. He served as party leader for most, if not all of the period from 1959 to 1977. Froese was sometimes called the \\"conscience of parliament\\", and does not appear to have endorsed his party's original views on monetary reform. The Manitoba Social Credit Party ran five candidates in the 1977 election, all of whom fared poorly. Even Froese was reduced to a fourth-place finish in Rhineland. In the 1981 election, the party announced that it would not run any candidates. Froese was by this time a member of Sidney Green's Progressive Party. The party seems to have dissolved itself shortly thereafter.

Its goal was protein design and its applications, which had implications in many fields including medicine. Genome@home was run by the Pande Lab at Stanford University, a non-profit institution dedicated to science research and education. Function Following the Human Genome Project, scientists needed to know the biological and medical implications of the resulting wealth of genetic information. Genome@home used spare processing power on personal computers to virtually design genes that match existing proteins, although it can also design new proteins that have not been found in nature. This process is computationally demanding, so distributed computing is a viable option. Researchers can use the results from the project to gain a better understanding of the evolution of natural genomes and proteins, and their functionality. This project had applications in medical therapy, new pharmaceuticals, and assigning functions to newly sequenced genes. Genome@home directly studied genomes and proteins by virtually designing new sequences for existing 3-D protein structures, which other scientists obtained through X-ray crystallography or NMR techniques. By understanding the relationship between the sequences and specific protein structures, the Pande lab tackled contemporary issues in structural biology, genetics, and medicine. Specifically, the Genome@home project aided the understanding of why thousands of different amino acid sequences all form the same structures and assisted the fields of proteomics and Structural genomics by predicting the functions of newly discovered genes and proteins. It also had implications in medical therapy by designing and virtually creating new versions of existing proteins. Genome@home's software was designed for uniprocessor systems. It begins with a large set of potential sequences, and repeatedly searches through and refines these sequences until a well-designed sequence is found. It then sends this sequence to the server, and repeats the process. Conclusion For financial reasons, the project was officially concluded on March 8, 2004, although data was still collected until April 15. Following its completion, users were asked to donate to Folding@home instead. Results It accumulated a large database of protein sequences, which will be used for important scientific purposes for years by the Pande Lab and other scientists across the world. Four peer- reviewed scientific publications have resulted from Genome@home.

Aside from Fier, the Palominos membership has been wildly elastic, with only bassist Bill Laswell and guitarist Nicky Skopelitis appearing on every album through 1996. Their latest work, 2012's A Good Country Mile features vocalist Kevn Kinney. While the Palominos' records usually featured a core set of musicians and a certain emotional continuity throughout the bulk of an album, various guest appearances resulted in stylistic changes from track to track. History =Initial lineup= The group first featured Fier, singer-guitarist Arto Lindsay, saxophonist John Zorn, bass guitarist Bill Laswell and violinist/guitarist Fred Frith. Their self-titled debut album was released on New York's Celluloid Records in 1983, and featured guest appearances by bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, guitarist Nicky Skopelitis, percussionist David Moss, turntablist M.E. Miller and others. The album has some of the first recorded turntable scratching outside of rap music, courtesy of Laswell and M.E. Miller. M.E. Miller also used vocal splitting technique to create harmony on the song he sings. They were heavily influenced by so-called no wave music (Arto Lindsay had played in the seminal no-wave band DNA), but their music also contained elements of funk and of the improvisational jazz stylings that became Zorn's trademark. This line-up lasted only for the first record, although all of the core members apart from Zorn were guests on subsequent Palominos recordings. =1985‚Äì1989= Amanda Kramer - Former Golden Palaminos singer in Concert in 2009 The Palominos' next album, 1985's Visions of Excess, sounded vastly different. Of the band members that were on the first album, only Fier, Laswell and Arto Lindsay remained. Visions of Excess also marked the debut of singer Syd Straw, whose songwriting and vocals were featured prominently, as well as on the group's next album. Michael Stipe, John Lydon and Jack Bruce took turns on lead vocals, while Richard Thompson and Jody Harris were featured on lead guitar. Blast of Silence (Axed My Baby for a Nickel) was released the following year, continuing in much the same vein as Visions of Excess and with appearances by many of the same personnel. It included covers of two songs written by Little Feat's Lowell George, both sung by Syd Straw. The record also featured prominent guest appearances by Peter Blegvad, Matthew Sweet, Don Dixon, Peter Holsapple and T-Bone Burnett. A Dead Horse (1989) carried on in the sound of its predecessors slightly, but some of the songs crossed into a darker, more ambient and ethereal sound that dominated the Palomino records of the 1990s. Syd Straw had moved on and was no longer in the band, with most of the vocals now handled by Amanda Kramer, formerly of the dance music group Information Society. Fier later was a guest on Straw's first solo record, Surprise. =1990‚Äì1995= Drunk with Passion marked the first album not on Celluloid Records, taking cues from some of the darker sounds heard on A Dead Horse and using more processed and electronic sounds, giving some of its songs an ethereal feel. This album is arguably more influenced by its guest appearances than are any of the previous albums. Guests included H√ºsker D√º's Bob Mould (who formed the band Sugar the following year), Richard Thompson, and Michael Stipe, who provided (along with a forceful solo by Thompson) one of the band's finer moments, the opening track \\"Alive and Living Now\\". Nicky Skopelitis also became more of a cornerstone of the band, contributing to the bulk of Drunk with Passion's songs along with Fier and Kramer. In 1992, Fier released his first solo record, Dreamspeed, which is partially a reworking of the Palomino's next album, This Is How It Feels. This Is How It Feels, released on Restless Records in 1993, continued the ambient sound of Drunk with Passion, but also incorporated elements of club and trance music. It also marked the introduction of new lead vocalist Lori Carson, who co-wrote nine of the CD's tracks with Anton Fier. Bill Laswell also returned to contribute on this record, and his production work on this and on the following record, Pure, heavily influenced Laswell's own remix work of the late 1990s, as seen on the CDs Emerald Ather and City of Light. The album also contains the first cover song since Blast of Silence, an ethereal, drum-machine-laced re-interpretation of Jackson Browne's \\"These Days\\". To further highlight the album's dance elements, an EP of remixes of songs from This Is How It Feels , entitled Prison of the Rhythm, was released shortly after the CD's release. Pure, released a year later, is seen by many as the band's most focused work, owing much to the strong contributions once again of Carson, Laswell, and Skopelitis. Tracks such as \\"No Skin\\" and \\"Pure\\" continue in the dance/ambient style of the previous album. The CD also stirred a minor controversy over the bare female breast on its cover, with some stores carrying a version of the CD with a booklet and the cover replaced by simple, text-based artwork. Another remix EP (No Thought, No Breath, No Eyes, No Heart) accompanied Pure's release. Pure was also the last Palominos record for Lori Carson. However, the song \\"Little Suicides\\", from Pure showed the same sparse sound, production, and strong yet quiet vocals (albeit less electronic) that influenced Carson's solo work. Anton Fier produced Carson's 1995 solo record, Where It Goes. 1994 also saw the release of what was essentially Fier's second solo recording, Absence of Time (released under the moniker Blind Light), which used outtakes from Pure for much of its framework. =1995‚Äì2000= Dead Inside (1996) was another stylistic turnaround for the Palominos, and their last proper album. This record had a deathly, industrial sound, with the line-up consisting only of Fier, multi-instrumentalist Knox Chandler (who before joining the Palominos, was also in a band with Lori Carson), Nicky Skopelitis, and poet Nicole Blackman. Blackman's dark and deliberate lyrics (tellingly, Blackman had also recently worked with the industrial German band KMFDM) made Dead Inside a challenging record; its sound and tone stand out as decidedly unlike any of the others. The album's opener is a brutal, spoken-word track, \\"Victim\\", which details a woman's thoughts as she is abducted and eventually murdered by her kidnapper. In 1997, The Palominos released another EP, named Dead Outside, composed of five remixes of tracks from Dead Inside. The EP, in a novelty for its time, was released as free MP3s on the Internet, made available via Nicole Blackman's website and through a fan-created band appreciation website (since decommissioned). The EP consisted of five remixes, each released sequentially for download from the sites for one month only, as per Fier's instructions: # Victim: The Last Thing by Sean Beavan (whose credits include 8MM, Nine Inch Nails, & Marilyn Manson) with John Van Eaton # Ride: Pragmatic Spasmatic by Raymond Watts (of KMFDM & Pig) # Belfast: Empty as Wire by Scanner (a frequent Blackman collaborator) # Ride remixed by Mark Walk (of Ruby) # Victim: Interference by John Van Eaton (another Blackman collaborator who also worked with NiN for 10 years)''' =2000-present= After the turn of the millennium, the band went on hiatus. Both Syd Straw and Lori Carson have gone on to moderately successful and critically acclaimed solo careers, with Carson a frequent contributor to television shows and movies. A compilation of some of Carson's contributed songs, titled Stolen Beauty, was released by Rykodisc in 2003, and her last solo record, The Finest Thing, was released in 2004. Anton Fier re-appeared on the music scene in 2009, producing Drivin' 'n' Cryin's album The Great American Bubble Factory, which was the band's first album in 12 years. In 2010, the Golden Palominos played two shows in New York City: a May 7 show at Le Poisson Rouge and a May 11 show at The Living Room. Both shows were an unqualified success and speculation began as to if more dates or a re- formation of the band was in the future. At around the same time, Fier began drumming again in New York City as a sideman to his friend Tony Scherr, and Kevn Kinney, the lead singer of Drivin' 'n' Cryin', re-connected with Fier at these shows. Fier and Kinney rekindled their friendship and began rehearsing together again, which then progressed into starting a Kickstarter campaign to fund a new Kevin Kinney album. The album, A Good Country Mile, was released on February 21, 2012, and is billed as 'Kevn Kinney and The Golden Palominos' (composed of Fier on drums, Scherr on guitars, and Andy Hess, formerly of Gov't Mule, on bass as well as Aaron Lee Tasjan on guitars and backing vocals). Initial reviews of the album were positive with Jambands stating the \\"...resulting music is raw and lovely and real as hell.\\" While this represents the first music from the Palominos in nearly 15 years, any additional projects exclusively under the Golden Palominos moniker have not materialized.

A few best-of compilations are available: two A History collections on Celluloid both released in 1992; a German collection released in 1997; and 2002's collection Run Pony Run. However, none include any material from Drunk with Passion onward. The later albums on Restless are growing harder to find on CD, with the earliest CDs on Celluloid and Drunk with Passion being nearly non- existent. (Dreamspeed is also extremely rare in its original release and is a prized possession of Fier aficionados. However, Fier re-released it and his other solo record, Absence of Time, on John Zorn's Tzadik label in late 2003.)  References  External links * Profile at Yahoo!

Life =Early years= Cornelius was born in D√ºsseldorf. From the age of twelve he attended drawing classes at the D√ºsseldorf Academy.Artist biography in German Masters of the Nineteenth Century, p.267 His father, who was superintendent of the D√ºsseldorf gallery and professor at the academy, died in 1799, after which Cornelius supported his family by his work as a portraitist and illustrator. In a letter to the Count Raczynski he wrote: > It fell to the lot of an elder brother and myself to watch over the > interests of a numerous family. It was at this time that it was attempted to > persuade my mother that it would be better for me to devote myself to the > trade of a goldsmith than to continue to pursue painting ‚Äì in the first > place, in consequence of the time necessary to qualify me for the art, and > in the next, because there were already so many painters. My dear mother, > however, rejected all this advice, and I felt myself impelled onward by an > uncontrollable enthusiasm, to which the confidence of my mother gave new > strength, which was supported by the continual fear that I should be removed > from the study of that art I loved so much. His earliest major work was the decoration of the choir of the church of St Quirinus at Neuss, commissioned by Canon Wallraff of Cologne in 1803. In 1809 he began a series of drawings illustrating Goethe's Faust, the first part of which had been published the previous year. For these Cornelius employed a linear style much influenced by a facsimile edition of D√ºrer's prayer book for Maximilian I. Six of the images were shown to the poet, who approved of them. Cornelius continued the series following his move to Rome, and it was published in twelve engravings between 1816 and 1826, under the title Bilder zu Goethe's Faust. He moved to Frankfurt in 1809, and worked there until going to Rome two years later. =Rome= Cornelius arrived in Rome on 14 October 1811, and soon became one of the most promising of the Lukasbund or \\"Nazarene Brotherhood\\", a group of young German artists resident in the city, which included Johann Friedrich Overbeck, Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, Philipp Veit, Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld and Ludwig Vogel, a fraternity (some of whom selected a ruinous convent for their home) who had banded together for resolute study and mutual criticism. At Rome Cornelius participated, with other members of the brotherhood, in the decoration of the Casa Zuccari (the residence of Jakob Salomon Bartholdy, the Prussian consul general), and the Villa Massimi, while at the same time also working on designs for the illustration of the Nibelungenlied. =Return to Germany= In 1819 Cornelius left the frescoes at the Villa Massimi unfinished and returned to Germany, having been summoned to Munich by the crown-prince of Bavaria, later King Ludwig I, to direct the decorations for his new sculpture gallery, the Glyptothek. In 1821 he took on, in addition to his work for Ludwig, the directorship of the D√ºsseldorf Academy. He soon discovered, however, that attention to such widely separated duties was incompatible with the just performance of either, and so eventually he resigned his post at D√ºsseldorf, some of his pupils following him to Munich to assist him there. At the death of Director Langer, 1824‚Äì5, he became director of the Munich Academy. =Works in Munich and Berlin= Fresco of The Last Judgment at the Ludwigskirche in Munich The fresco decorations of the Ludwigskirche in Munich, which were for the most part designed and executed by Cornelius, were perhaps the most important mural works of their time. The large fresco of the Last Judgment, over the high altar in that church, measures in height by in width. The frescoes of the Creator, the Nativity, and the Crucifixion in the same building are also upon a large scale. Other major works in Munich included his decorations in the Pinakothek and in the Glyptothek; those in the latter building, in the hall of the gods and the hall of the hero-myths, are perhaps the best known. In about 1839‚Äì40 he left Munich for Berlin to work on a series of cartoons, depicting the Apocalypse, for a cycle of frescoes commissioned by Frederick William IV for a proposed \\"Campo Santo\\" or royal mausoleum in Berlin. The king abandoned his plans following the revolution of 1848, but Cornelius continued to work on the cartoons for the rest of his life. He maintained close contact with the art world in Rome, and returned to live there between 1853 and 1869. Style and technique Cornelius, as an oil painter, possessed little technical skill, and his works do not exhibit any instinctive appreciation of colour. Even as a fresco painter his manipulative power was not great. In critically examining the execution in colour of some of his magnificent designs, one cannot help feeling that he was, in this respect, unable to do them full justice. Cornelius and his associates endeavoured to follow in their works the spirit of the Italian painters. But the Italian strain is to a considerable extent modified by the D√ºrer heritage. This D√ºrer influence is manifest in a tendency to overcrowding in composition, in a degree of attenuation in the proportions of, and a poverty of contour in, the nude figure, and also in a leaning to the selection of Gothic forms for draperies. These peculiarities are even noticeable in Cornelius's principal work of the \\"Last Judgment\\", in the Ludwigskirche in Munich. The attenuation and want of flexibility of contour in the nude are perhaps most conspicuous in his frescoes of classical subjects in the Glyptothek, especially in that representing the contention for the body of Patroclus. But despite these peculiarities there is always in his works a grandeur and nobility of conception. Although not dexterous in the handling of the brush, he could conceive and design a subject with masterly purpose. If he had an imperfect eye for colour, he had vast mental foresight in directing the German school of painting; and his favorite motto of \\"Deutschland uber alles\\" indicates the direction and the strength of his patriotism. His pupils included Karl Hermann, Wilhelm von Kaulbach and Adam Eberle. Cornelius often relied on pupils and assistants for the execution, and sometimes even the design of the projects of which he was in charge. The cartoons for the Glyptothek were all by Cornelius's own hand; in the Pinakothek, however, his sketches and small drawings sufficed, and at the Ludwigskirche even the invention of some of the subjects was entrusted to Hermann. Influence In 1855 Th√©ophile Gautier wrote that Cornelius \\"enjoyed a celebrity such as few artists enjoy in their lifetime\\", adding that he was admired \\"as if he were already dead\\". To comprehend and appreciate thoroughly the magnitude of the work which Cornelius accomplished for Germany, we must remember that at the beginning of the 19th century Germany had no national school of art. Germany was in painting and sculpture behind all the rest of Europe. Yet in less than half a century Cornelius founded a great school, revived mural painting, and turned the gaze of the art world towards Munich. The German revival of mural painting had its effect upon England, as well as upon other European nations, and led to the famous cartoon competitions held in Westminster Hall, and ultimately to the partial decoration of the Houses of Parliament. In November 1841, when the latter work was in contemplation, Cornelius, in response to invitations, visited England. His opinion was in every way favourable to the carrying out of the project, and even in respect of the durability of fresco in the English climate. Cornelius, in his teaching, always inculcated a close and rigorous study of nature, but he understood by the study of nature something more than constantly making studies from life; he meant the study of nature with an inquiring and scientific spirit. Study nature, was the advice he once gave, in order that you may become acquainted with its essential forms.

The medal was authorized by an Act of Congress in 1901. The medal was awarded to those personnel who served on ships in the fleet of Rear Admiral William T. Sampson during combat operations in the waters of the West Indies and Cuba. The Sampson Medal was also known as the Medal Commemorating Naval Engagements in the West Indies or West Indies Naval Campaign Medal, not to be confused with the West Indies Campaign Medal which was a separate award. A similar commemorative decoration was the Dewey Medal, considered senior to the Sampson Medal. Creation The Sampson Medal was first authorized by a Joint resolution of the United States Congress on March 3, 1901. The resolution authorized the Secretary of the Navy to have produced bronze medals to commemorate naval engagements in the West Indies and on the shores of Cuba during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The medal was to be presented to the officers and men of the United States Navy and Marine Corps who participated in engagements and battles that were deemed to be of sufficient importance to merit their commemoration. The resolution also stipulated that those who might be eligible for recognition for participation in more than one engagement would not receive a second medal, but would receive a \\"bronze bar appropriately inscribed, to be attached to the ribbon by which the medal is suspended.\\" Appearance The obverse of the medal was designed by Charles E. Barber. It depicts a bust of Admiral Sampson. The reverse was designed by George T. Morgan. It depicts a Navy officer, Sailor, and Marine standing upon a block identifying the action for which the medal was awarded. Suspending the ribbon of the medal is a brooch pin with the name of the recipient's ship. The recipient's name is engraved on the lower rim of the medal, this being one of only two medals officially issued named to a recipient. Campaign clasps or engagement bars were authorized for wear on the ribbon, showing various battles and the ship name which had participated. The medal was issued for 47 engagements or skirmishes and some were awarded with several engagement bars. When worn as a ribbon on a military uniform, there were no devices authorized.

Under the terms of the Second Charter, issued in 1609, the Company offered shares for twelve pounds ten shillings per share, to be invested and reinvested for seven years. Those men who ventured to Virginia in person, investing their time and risking their lives, would each be counted as holding one share.Craven, Wesley Frank, The Virginia Company of London, 1606-1624, pp.19-202008\\\\. The Second Charter of Virginia; May 23, 1609, Lillian Goldman Law Library, Yale University: In 1616, at the end of the administration of Sir Thomas Dale, the first dividend became due and payable to all who had invested, whether by the purchase of shares or by \\"personal adventure\\". However, since the colony had not prospered, there was no money to divide. Instead, the Company offered grants of land. Colonists who had paid their own passage to Virginia received a \\"first dividend\\" of , free of quit-rent, for their \\"personal adventure\\", and an additional hundred acres for each share they owned in the London Company: Those who had been brought at the Company's expense (as indentured servants) also received 100 acres for their \\"personal adventure\\", but in their case the land was subject to an annual rent of one shilling per 50 acres: Colonists who arrived after the departure of Sir Thomas Dale were entitled to a lesser grant of 50 acres. The London Company reasoned that \\"... by the singular Industry and virtue of the said Sir Thomas Dale the former Difficulties and Dangers were in greatest part overcome to the great ease and security of such as have been since that time transported thither\\",. In other words, those who had come earlier received twice as much land, supposedly in recognition of the greater risks and hardships they had endured. Of course, reducing the size of the grant to 50 acres also saved the hard- pressed Company a great deal of money, and the later colonists can scarcely be said to have experienced the \\"great ease and security\\" mentioned by the Company; the death rate continued extremely high.Morgan, Edmund S., American Slavery, American Freedom. Morgan states: \\"One reason why the King dissolved the Virginia Company [in 1624] was that it seemed to have sent so many men to their deaths without taking adequate measures to feed and shelter them.\\" The phrase \\"Ancient Planter\\" was not an honorific; it was simply a descriptive term, as used in the \\"Instructions\\", for a planter of long standing.Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd Edition, p.64:\\"Ancient\\", (2) of early origin; going far back. According to a letter from John Rolfe dated January 1619/20: > All the Ancient Planters being sett free have chosen places for their > dividends according to the Comyssion. Which giveth all greate content, for > now knowing their owne landes, they strive and are prepared to build houses > & to clear their groundes ready to plant, which giveth great encouragement > and the greatest hope to make the Colony florrish that ever yet happened to > them.Records of the Virginia Company of London, ed. Susan Myra Kingsbury, > III, 245 Identification Because the surviving historical records are incomplete, and sometimes demonstrably inaccurate,See for example \\"Early Passengers to Virginia: When Did They Really Arrive?\\", by Avery E. Kolb, The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 88, No. 4, pp 401-414 it is not possible to compile a definitive list of Ancient Planters. The database of Colonial Land Office Patents at the Library of Virginia is the principal source of information as to the identities of those who received grants as Ancient Planters. Though the record does not begin until 1623, when administration of the colony was taken over by the Crown, many of the subsequent patents identify \\"ancient planters\\", or provide information which shows that a tract of land must have been originally granted under the terms applying to Ancient Planters. Additional information comes from the 1624/5 Muster, a census ordered as part of the handover of the colony from the Virginia Company to the Crown. For some of the colonists, the census includes information on the year and ship of arrival. In many cases this valuable information is missing. Also as part of the transition to Crown Colony status, a list of grants was compiled in 1625 and sent to London.\\"Extracts of all the Titles and Estates of Land, sent home by Sir Francis Wyatt, May, 1625\\", ibid., 551 This list does not identify the Ancient Planters as such, but in some cases knowledge of the grant combined with information from other sources (e.g., knowledge of the date of arrival) is enough to show that the planter in question must have received the grant as an Ancient Planter.

He was born in Woolwich, London, the son of Samuel Hunter Christie and educated at King's College School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was fourth wrangler in 1868 and was elected a fellow of Trinity in 1869. Having been Chief Assistant at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich from 1870 to 1881, he was appointed to replace George Airy as Astronomer Royal in 1881 and remained in office until 1910. He received the degree D.Sc. (honoris causa) from the University of Oxford in June 1902, and was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1904. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June, 1881. He was president of the Royal Astronomical Society from 1888 to 1890. The first Astronomer Royal to retire at 65 (all previous incumbents bar Airy and John Pond had died in office; John Pond had been forced by poor health to resign in 1835, while Airy retired aged 81), Christie died and was buried at sea near Gibraltar in 1922. He had married in 1881 Mary Violette, daughter of Sir Alfred Hickman.

Auslander, Liveness: performance in a mediatized culture (London: Routledge, 2008), p. 83. It is particularly associated with the creation of hybrid subgenres from the later 1960s including blues rock, country rock, southern rock, and swamp rock which have been seen as responses to the perceived excesses of dominant psychedelic and developing progressive rock.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, All music guide to rock: the definitive guide to rock, pop, and soul (Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), p. 1327. Because roots music (Americana) is often used to mean folk and world musical forms, roots rock is sometimes used in a broad sense to describe any rock music that incorporates elements of this music.R. Shuker, Popular Music: the Key Concepts (London: Routledge, 2005), p. 235. In the 1980s, roots rock enjoyed a revival in response to trends in punk rock, new wave and heavy metal music. History Bob Dylan In 1966, as many rock artists moved towards expansive and experimental psychedelia, Bob Dylan spearheaded the back-to- basics roots revival when he went to Nashville to record the album Blonde on Blonde, using notable local musicians like Charlie McCoy. This, and the subsequent more clearly country-influenced albums, John Wesley Harding (1967) and Nashville Skyline (1969), have been seen as creating the genre of country folk, a route pursued by a number of, largely acoustic, folk musicians.K. Wolff, O. Duane, Country Music: The Rough Guide (Rough Guides, 2000), p. 392. Other acts that followed the back to basics trend in different ways were the Canadian/American group the Band and the California-based Creedence Clearwater Revival, both of which mixed basic rock and roll with folk, country and blues, to be among the most successful and influential bands of the late 1960s.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, All music guide to rock: the definitive guide to rock, pop, and soul (Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), pp. 61 and 265. The same movement saw the beginning of the recording careers of Californian solo artists like Ry Cooder, Bonnie Raitt and Lowell George.B. Hoskyns, Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends (John Wiley and Sons, 2007), pp. 87-90. =Blues rock= Peter Green performing with Fleetwood Mac in 1970 The blues boom overlapped, both chronologically and in terms of personnel, with the earlier, wider rhythm and blues phase, which had begun to peter out in the mid-1960s leaving a nucleus of instrumentalists with a wide knowledge of blues forms and techniques, which they would carry into the pursuit of more purist blues interests.R. Unterberger, \\"Early British R&B;\\", in V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), , pp. 1315-6.N. Logan and B. Woffinden, The NME Book of Rock 2 (London: W. H. Allen, 1977), , pp. 61-2. Blues Incorporated and John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers were well known in the London Jazz and emerging R&B; circuits, but the Bluesbreakers began to gain some national and international attention, particularly after the release of Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton album (1966), considered one of the seminal British blues recordings.T. Rawlings, A. Neill, C. Charlesworth and C. White, Then, Now and Rare British Beat 1960-1969 (Omnibus Press, 2002), p. 130. Produced by Mike Vernon, who later set up the Blue Horizon record label. From 1966 to 68, young Englishman formed blues rock bands such as Cream, Fleetwood Mac, Keef Hartley Band, Ten Years After, and Free. In America, Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Canned Heat, and Johnny Winter performanced at Woodstock Festival 1969. =Country rock= Dylan's lead was also followed by the Byrds, who were joined by Gram Parsons in 1968. Earlier in the year Parsons had already recorded Safe at Home with the International Submarine Band, which made extensive use of pedal steel guitar and is seen by some as the first true country-rock album. The result of Parsons tenure in the Byrds was Sweetheart of the Rodeo (1968), generally considered one of the finest and most influential recordings in the genre. The Byrds continued for a brief period in the same vein, but Parsons left soon after the album was released to be joined by another ex-Byrds member Chris Hillman in forming the Flying Burrito Brothers. Over the next two years they recorded the albums The Gilded Palace of Sin (1969) and Burrito Deluxe (1970), which helped establish the respectability and parameters of the genre, before Parsons departed to pursue a solo career. Country rock was a particularly popular style in the California music scene of the late 1960s, and was adopted by bands including Hearts and Flowers, Poco and New Riders of the Purple Sage. Some folk-rockers followed the Byrds into the genre, among them the Beau Brummels and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.P. Buckley, The Rough Guide to Rock (Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2003), p. 730. A number of performers also enjoyed a renaissance by adopting country sounds, including: the Everly Brothers, whose Roots album (1968) is usually considered some of their finest work; former teen idol Ricky Nelson who became the frontman for the Stone Canyon Band; Michael Nesmith who formed the First National Band after his departure from the Monkees; and Neil Young who moved in and out of the genre throughout his career. One of the few acts to successfully move from the country side towards rock were the bluegrass band The Dillards. The greatest commercial success for country rock came in the 1970s, with the Doobie Brothers mixing in elements of R&B;, Emmylou Harris (a former backing singer for Parsons) becoming the \\"Queen of country-rock\\" and Linda Ronstadt creating a highly successful pop-orientated brand of the genre. Members of Ronstadt's former backing band went on to form the Eagles (made up of members of the Burritos, Poco and Stone Canyon Band), and emerged as one of the most successful rock acts of all time, producing albums that included Desperado (1973) and Hotel California (1976).N. E. Tawa, Supremely American: popular song in the 20th century: styles and singers and what they said about America (Scarecrow Press, 2005), pp. 227-8. Country rock began to fade in the late 1970s in the face of punk and new wave trends. =Southern rock= Duane Allman playing guitar at the Fillmore East, June 26, 1971 (late show) Although the Southern states had been, as much as anywhere, the birthplace of rock and roll, after the decline of rockabilly in the late 1950s, it was not until the early 1970s that a distinctive regional style of rock music emerged.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, All music guide to rock: the definitive guide to rock, pop, and soul (Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), pp. 1332-3. (This was despite some successful bands from the region, a major contribution to the evolution of soul music in the Stax-Volt records company and the existence of the Muscle Shoals and FAME Studios). The founders of Southern rock are usually thought to be the Allman Brothers Band, who developed a distinctive sound, largely derived from blues rock, but incorporating elements of boogie, soul, and country; combining hard rock instrumentation and rhythms with accented vocals and Duane Allman's slide guitar. Of the acts that followed the Allmans into the emerging genre, the most successful was Lynyrd Skynyrd, who with songs like \\"Free Bird\\" (1973) and \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" (1974) helped establish the \\"Good ol' boy\\" image of the subgenre and the general shape of 1970s guitar rock. They were followed by many other bands, including The Atlanta Rhythm Section, ZZ Top, Black Oak Arkansas, the more country-influenced The Marshall Tucker Band, and Wet Willie, Blackfoot, The Ozark Mountain Daredevils, Johnny Winter, Edgar Winter Group, and the Dixie Dregs. After the loss of original members of the Allmans and Lynyrd Skynyrd, the genre began to fade in popularity in the late 1970s, but was sustained the 1980s with acts like The Outlaws, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Stevie Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble, Pointblank, .38 Special, and Molly Hatchet. =Swamp rock= Swamp rock is a rock genre that drew more on 1960s rock than on the 1950s rhythm and blues sound that helped to define swamp pop.Bernard, Swamp Pop, p. 106. This genre is created by the work of such artists as Creedence Clearwater Revival, John Fogerty, Dale Hawkins, Ronnie Hawkins, Leon Russell, Delaney and Bonnie, and Tony Joe White.L. C. Hillstrom, The Vietnam Experience: a Concise Encyclopedia of American Literature, Songs, and Films (Greenwood, 1998), p. 115. =Heartland rock= The term heartland rock was first used in the early 1970s to describe Midwestern arena rock groups like Kansas, REO Speedwagon and Styx, but came to be associated with a more socially concerned form of roots rock more directly influenced by folk, country and rock and roll.R. Kirkpatrick, The words and music of Bruce Springsteen (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007), p. 51. It has been seen as an American Midwest and Rust Belt counterpart to West Coast country rock and the Southern rock of the American South.G. Thompson, American Culture in the 1980s (Edinburgh University Press, 2007), p. 138. Led by figures who had initially been identified with punk and new wave, it was most strongly influenced by acts such as Bob Dylan, The Byrds, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Van Morrison, 1960s garage rock, and the Rolling Stones.. Exemplified by the commercial success of singer songwriters Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger, and Tom Petty, along with less widely known acts such as Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes and Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers, it was partly a reaction to post-industrial urban decline in the East and Mid-West, often dwelling on issues of social disintegration and isolation, beside a form of good-time rock and roll revivalism. The genre reached its commercial, artistic and influential peak in the mid-1980s, with Springsteen's Born in the USA (1984), topping the charts worldwide and spawning a series of top ten singles, together with the arrival of artists including John Cougar/Mellencamp, Steve Earle and more gentle singer/songwriters such as Bruce Hornsby. It can also be heard as an influence on artists as diverse as Billy Joel, Kid Rock and The Killers. Though various Heartland rock acts had sustained success through the 1990s such as Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen, The Wallflowers, and to a lesser extent, the BoDeans and Los Lobos, Heartland rock's commercial prosperity and general popularity began to fade away as early as the early 1990s. As rock music in general, and blue collar and white working class themes in particular, lost influence with younger audiences, heartland's artists turned to more personal works. =1980s revival= The term \\"roots rock\\" was coined during the mid-'80s. A number of key bands were defined as cow punk, punk rockers who played country music, including Jason & The Scorchers from Tennessee, Dash Rip Rock from Louisiana and Drivin N Cryin from Georgia, but the centre of the cow punk movement became Los Angeles, thanks to bands including the Long Ryders, Tex & the Horseheads, the Rave-Ups, Lone Justice and Rank and File. Also part of this trend and enjoying some mainstream success were Gun Club, Chris Isaak, Violent Femmes, BoDeans, and Los Lobos.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, S. T. Erlewine, eds, All Music Guide to the Blues: The Definitive Guide to the Blues (Backbeat, 3rd edn., 2003), pp. 493, 564, 670, 723. In addition the alternative country movement, producing such figures as Steve Earle, Lucinda Williams and Uncle Tupelo, can be seen as part of the roots rock tendency.M. Dutton, True to the Roots: Americana Music Revealed (University of Nebraska Press, 2006), p. 18.P. Fox, B. Ching, Old Roots, New Routes: The Cultural Politics of Alt.Country Music (University of Michigan Press, 2008), p. 7. The movement began to decline in popularity again in the 1990s but produced some bands like Son Volt, Wilco and The Bottle Rockets.P. Buckley, The Rough Guide to Rock (Rough Guides, 3rd ed., 2003), p. 1169. After disbanding Dire Straits in 1995, lead singer Mark Knopfler has largely returned to a roots-rock sound across his nine albums.

(The Mastroianni brothers also created an original strip, Dogs of C Kennel, in 2009.) Cast of characters For a visual glossary, see Meet The Actors at John Hart Studios. =Character inspiration= Hart was inspired to draw cavemen (and many other creatures) through the chance suggestion of one of his coworkers at General Electric, and took to the idea \\"because they are a combination of simplicity and the origin of ideas.\\" The name for the strip \\"may have been suggested by my wife, Bobby,\\" Johnny recalls.The Johnny Hart Interview Hart describes the title character as similar to himself, playing the \\"patsy.\\" The other major characters ‚Äî Peter, Wiley, Clumsy Carp, Curls, and Thor ‚Äî were patterned after friends and co- workers. The animal characters include dinosaurs, ants and an anteater, clams, a snake, a turtle and bird duo, and an apteryx (presented in the strip as being the sole surviving specimen, and hence self-aware of its being doomed to extinction). =Human characters = * B.C.: An orange haired, humble, na√Øve slob and eternal patsy. B.C. occasionally makes nighttime rounds as his alter- ego, \\"The Midnight Skulker.\\" * Peter: A yellow haired, self-styled genius and the world's first philosophical failure, founder of the \\"Prehistoric Pessimists Society\\" and the \\"Truth Pedestal,\\" and the discoverer of oil. Peter is patterned after Hart's friend, Peter Reuter; the two had been co-workers at General Electric. * Thor: a self-proclaimed ladies' man; inventor of the wheel and the comb. Thor was patterned after another of Hart's friends from GE, Thornton Kinney. * Jane: a bossy cavewoman who enjoys clobbering snakes. Until August 29, 2019, Jane was referred to in the strip as the \\"Fat Broad\\". * Grace: a quiet but intellectual giant in a world of crude men. Until August 29, 2019, Grace was referred to in the strip as the \\"Cute Chick\\". * Wiley: a peg-legged, superstitious, unshaven, woman-fearing, water-hating poet and coach of the local baseball and football teams, not to mention the first bartender. Wiley was patterned after Hart's brother-in-law, Wiley Baxter, who lost his leg in World War II. * Clumsy Carp: a nerdy, bespectacled ichthyologist and perpetual klutz, clumsy enough to trip over a shadow, yet with some unusual skills, such as his ability to make and stack \\"water balls\\" (similar to snowballs). Clumsy Carp was patterned after Hart's childhood friend, Jack Caprio. * Curls: a master of sarcastic wit. Curls was patterned after Hart's friend from high school, Richard (Curly) Boland. * Grog: pure Id, a caveman's caveman; a primitive, semi-evolved wild man with a one-word vocabulary and enough strength to knock the sun out of the sky using a golf ball. *The Guru: an unnamed, bearded wise man living like a hermit atop a mountain, whence he dispenses wisdom and sarcasm. =Animals and other non- human characters= * John the Turtle and the Dookey Bird: this prehistoric odd couple are inseparable friends, especially when making their annual trek south for the winter. The Dookey Bird rides on John's back when they travel. * The Snake: the put-upon, mortal enemy of the Fat Broad (and her club). * The Anteater: eats ants with a sticky, elastic tongue and a ZOT! sound. Hart actually drew something of a hybrid‚Äîwith the long ears of an aardvark and the bushy tail of a giant anteater. (This character was the inspiration for Peter the Anteater, the University of California, Irvine team mascot. Also served as the inspiration for the mascot of the now disestablished US Navy fighter squadron VF-114 the \\"Aardvarks\\".)The Anteater Mascot, UCI Library * Maude: an ant, a nagging wife with a smart-alec son (Johnny) and a quarrelsome, straying husband. * Jake: ant husband of Maude, who is always threatening to run off with Shirley. * Queen Ida: the queen ant, an unfeeling and abusive dictator. (Queen Ida is based on Hart's wife Bobby, whose given name is Ida. She's featured every year on her birthday, December 3.) * The Dinosaur: big but not too bright‚Äîa sort of sauropod with spinal plates like a stegosaurus. Sometimes called Gronk, which is the only sound he makes (although he can talk fluently in recent strips). * The Clams: talking clams with legs, among other appendages. (Clams are also the preferred unit of currency in B.C.) * The Apteryx (kiwi): a \\"wingless bird with hairy feathers,\\" as he invariably introduces himself. * The Turkey: makes his yearly appearance at Thanksgiving time, eluding the mighty hunters. * Oynque: the turkey's porcine partner in crime, rarely seen without his trademark mud puddle. * Wolf: the newest B.C. character August 24, 2009;John Hart Studios.com a blissfully deviant domestication of Precambrian fur. Man's first friend. * Various incidental ants, including a schoolteacher and her students. * Raptors: velociraptors that try to eat the other characters. There are also several odd inanimate characters, including a talking Daisy and his/her friend, a talking Rock. =Seldom-used or one-shot human characters= Although the strip seldom expands its human cast outside of the established group of characters, there are a few exceptions. It can be assumed that there are other groups or tribes of humans for Wiley's sports teams to compete against, for example, but these are never actually seen. There have been a few exceptions to this, however, with a few additional human characters seen from time to time, even if only once. * Anno Domini, or A.D., introduced during a weeks-long journey by Peter to discover the new world, which he successfully accomplished. His name is arguably a riff on B.C.'s name. He dresses as a caveman very much like the rest of the characters, but has a thick mustache and a stereotypical Italian accent, assuming a bit of a take on Christopher Columbus. He befriends Peter in the \\"new world.\\" * Conahonty, a Native American Indian, who also appears in the \\"new world\\" storyline, and befriends Peter. He is a friend of A.D.'s, and speaks rather stereotypical broken English. He dresses more like a somewhat stereotyped Indian than a caveman, and at one point even specifically states that he is an American Indian. He and A.D. were not frequently seen after Peter returned from his epic journey. The two are the most oft-appearing non- regular human characters in the history of the strip other than the Guru, due to the strip's tight focus on its core cast of humans. His name is a spoof of the name Pocahontas. * Peter's Pen Pal, An unseen person whom Peter corresponds with by tossing \\"floating stone tablet\\" letters into the ocean and receiving answers at a later time. Setting The characters live, for the most part, in caves, in what appears to be a barren, mountainous desert by an unidentified sea. Background detail is often limited to a simple horizon line broken up by the occasional silhouettes of a stray volcano or cloud. \\"Retail stores\\", \\"shop counters\\", and \\"businesses\\" are symbolized by a single boulder, labeled (for instance): \\"Wheel Repair\\", \\"Advice Column\\", \\"Psychiatrist\\", etc. The February 5, 2012, strip gives a nearby location of N 53¬∞ 24' 17\\" W 6¬∞ 12' 3\\", which is in present-day Dublin, Ireland. Originally, the strip was set firmly in prehistoric times, with the characters clearly living in an era untouched by modernity. Typical plot lines, for example, include B.C.'s friend, Thor (inventor of the wheel and the comb), trying to discover a use for the wheel. Thor was also seen making calendars out of stone every December. Other characters attempt to harness fire or to discover an unexplored territory, like Peter trying to find the \\"new world\\" by crossing the ocean on a raft. Animals, like the dinosaur, think such thoughts as, \\"There's one consolation to becoming extinct‚ÄîI'll go down in history as the first one to go down in history.\\" Grog arrived in early 1966,Take a Bow, B.C. published in 1970, containing cartoons from 1965 and 1966 emerging from a miniature glacier which melted to reveal what Wiley called \\"Prehistoric man!\\" B.C., like Hart's Wizard of Id, is a period burlesque with a deliberately broad, non literal time frame. As time went on the strip began to mine humor from having the characters make explicit references to modern-day current events, inventions, and celebrities. Increasingly familiar visual devices, like the makeshift \\"telephone\\" built into a tree trunk, also started to blur the comic's supposed prehistoric setting and make it rife with intentional anachronisms. One of the comic's early out-of-context jokes, from June 22, 1967, was this one: :Peter: \\"I used to think the sun revolved around the earth.\\" :B.C.: \\"What does it revolve around?\\" :Peter: \\"The United States!\\" Another early example: Near Christmas time, the apteryx, dressed as Santa Claus, modified his usual spiel: \\"Hi there, I'm an Apterclaus, a wingless toymonger with batteries not included!\\" The Washington Post columnist and comics critic Gene Weingarten suggestedChatological Humor, The Washington Post, July 2004 that B.C. is actually set not in the past but in a dystopic, post-apocalyptic future. Format and style B.C. follows a gag-a-day format, featuring (mostly) unrelated jokes from day to day, plus a color Sunday page. Occasionally it will run an extended sequence on a given theme over a week or two. It also follows the convention of Sunday strips with a short, setup/payoff joke in the first two panels, followed by an extended gag. The principal cast is small and varied, with each character imbued with a developed personality. \\"The art style, like that of Charles Schulz's Peanuts, masks sophisticated minimalism with a casually scratchy veneer,\\" according to comics historian Don Markstein.B.C. at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on August 27, 2015. Dry humor, prose, verse, slapstick, irony, shameless puns and wordplay, and comedic devices such as Wiley's Dictionary (where common words are defined humorously with a twist, see Daffynition) make for some of the mix of material in B.C. Example: \\"Rock (verb): To cause something or someone to swing or sway, principally by hitting them with it!\\"--from an early 1967 strip. Or: \\"Cantaloupe (noun): What the father of the bride asks after seeing the wedding estimate!\\" There are running gags relating to the main cast and to a variety of secondary, continuing characters. One such periodic recurring gag has Peter communicating with an unseen pen-pal on the other side of the ocean, writing a message on a slab of rock that he floats off into the horizon. It is invariably returned the same way, with a sarcastic reply written on the reverse side. These segments use silent or \\"pantomime\\" panels (indicating that time has elapsed; night falls and dawn rises) between the set-up and the delayed punch line--typical of Hart's idiosyncratic use of \\"timing\\" in B.C.  Religious aspect  Late in the run of the strip, and following a renewal of Hart's religious faith in 1984, B.C. increasingly incorporated religious, social, and political commentary, continuing until Hart's death in 2007. References to Christianity, anachronistic given the strip's supposed setting and the implications of its title, became increasingly frequent during Hart's later years. In interviews, Hart referred to his strip as a \\"ministry\\" intended to mix religious themes with secular humor.The Plain Truth ‚Äì At the Hart of B.C. Though other strips such as The Family Circus and Peanuts have included Christian themes, B.C. strips were pulled from comics pages on several occasions due to editorial perception of religious favoritism or overt proselytizing. Easter strips in 1996 and 2001, for example, prompted editorial reaction from a handful of U.S. newspapers, chiefly the Los Angeles Times and written and oral responses from Jewish and Muslim groups who were offended that Hart would include his own Christian beliefs in his strip. The American Jewish Committee termed the Easter 2001 strip, which depicted the last words of Jesus Christ and a menorah transforming into a cross, \\"religiously offensive\\" and \\"shameful.\\"Easter Comic Strip Creates An Uproar, Christian Century, May 2, 2001 A 2003 strip depicting a character using an outhouse with a crescent symbol on the front, slamming the door shut, and declaring, \\"Is it just me, or does it stink in here?\\" was interpreted by some as carrying an anti-Islam message. Hart responded to the controversy, saying \\"This comic was in no way intended to be a message against Islam ‚Äî subliminal or otherwise.... It would be contradictory to my own faith as a Christian to insult other people‚Äôs beliefs.\\"Wondermark ¬ª Archive ¬ª The Comic Strip Doctor: B.C.

B.C. strip from April 15, 2001, which prompted complaints from some Jewish groups.  Other controversy  The B.C. daily strip from December 7, 2006 attracted criticism for defining infamy as \\"a word seldom used after Toyota sales topped 2 million.\\" The day was the 65th anniversary of the Japanese military's attack on Pearl Harbor, and the punchline of the strip refers to Franklin D. Roosevelt's \\"Infamy Speech\\" which requested from Congress a declaration of war against Japan. The day's strip was pulled from at least one newspaper, the San Antonio Express- News. The paper's managing editor said the comic was \\"a regressive and insensitive statement about one of the worst days in American history.\\" On July 21, 2009, the strip presented a gag that involved the supposed suggestion of animal abuse. John Hart Studios received many angry responses from readers and issued an apology on their website.  B.C. in other media  *The characters were featured in two animated television specials. B.C.: The First Thanksgiving, first aired on NBC in 1973, was directed by Abe Levitow, and featured the voice talents of Daws Butler (as B.C. and Clumsy), Don Messick as Peter and Thor, Bob Holt as Wiley and Grog, and Joanie Sommers as Fat Broad and Cute Chick. *B.C.: A Special Christmas first aired on HBO in 1981, and starred the comedy team of Bob and Ray as the voices of Peter and Wiley, respectively. *The characters appeared in animated commercials for the U.S. Federal agency ACTION in the 1970s and for Monroe shocks in the late 1980s. They were also licensed by Arby's restaurants in 1981, which issued a collector set of 6 B.C. cartoon character drinking glasses. In the last half of the 1960s, the BC characters were used in commercials for Marathon gasoline. *B.C. was turned into two video games for the ColecoVision home video game system, Atari 800, Commodore 64 and the MSX home computers: B.C.'s Quest for Tires and B.C. 2: Grog's Revenge.  Hometown  Influences from B.C. are found throughout Johnny Hart's home of Broome County, New York. A PGA Tour event, the B.C. Open, took place every summer in Endicott, New York through 2005 (the final scheduled B.C. Open in 2006 was disrupted by flooding, prompting a change of venue to the Turning Stone Resort & Casino in central New York state). Each year Johnny would bring in a group of cartoonists to play in the Pro-Am. Jim Davis, Mike Peters, Mort Walker, Paul Szep, Dik Browne, John Cullen Murphy, Dean Young, Stan Drake, Brant Parker, Lynn Johnston, and entertainer Tom Smothers would put on a free show for the community, drawing and signing autographs for golf and cartooning fans. The Broome County parks departmentBroome County Parks and Recreation features Gronk the dinosaur as their mascot, and Thor riding a wheel graces every Broome County Transit bus. In the past, Hart has also left his mark, free of charge, on the logos of the Broome Dusters and B.C. Icemen hockey teams.

Biography He was born in Berlin, the second son of the sculptor Johann Gottfried Schadow, who gave him his first lessons in drawing. He then turned to painting, and was instructed by Weitsch. In 1806-7 Schadow served as a soldier. In 1810 he traveled with his elder brother Rudolph to Rome where he became one of the leading painters of the Nazarene movement. Following the example of Johann Friedrich Overbeck and others, Schadow, originally a Lutheran, joined the Roman Catholic Church, and held that an artist must believe and live out the truths he essays to paint. The sequel showed that Schadow was qualified to shine more as a teacher and mentor than as a painter. As an author, he is best known for his lecture, Ueber den Einfluss des Christentums auf die bildende Kunst (About The Influence of Christianity On The Visual Arts) (D√ºsseldorf, 1843), and the biographical sketches, Der moderne Vasari (Berlin, 1854). Mignon (1828) In Rome, Schadow was given one of his first major commissions when the Prussian Consul-General, General Jakob Salomon Bartholdy, befriended the young painter, and asked him and three young compatriots (Peter von Cornelius, Johann Friedrich Overbeck and Philipp Veit) to decorate in fresco a room in his house on the Pincian Hill. The overall theme selected was the story of Joseph and his brethren, and two scenes, the Bloody Coat and Joseph in Prison, were conferred on Schadow. In 1819, Schadow was appointed professor in the prestigious Berlin Academy of the Arts, and his ability and thorough training gained many devoted disciples. It was during this period that Schadow developed his paintings for churches. In 1826 he was made director of the D√ºsseldorf Academy of the Arts, which he reoriented towards the production of Christian art, though he began a major dispute with one of its professors, Heinrich Christoph Kolbe, ending in the latter leaving the Academy in 1832. In 1837, Schadow selected, at request, those of his students best qualified to decorate the chapel of St Apollinaris on the Rhine with frescoes. When finished, they were acclaimed as the fullest and purest manifestation of the spiritual side of the D√ºsseldorf school. One of his famous students, Heinrich Mucke, carried on the liturgical art with emphasis both in painting and frescoes. The painting of the Wise and Foolish Virgins, considered one of his masterworks, was commissioned in 1842. Now in the St√§del Museum, this large and important picture, while carefully considered and rendered, lacks the power of some of his other works. Potocki in Childhood (1820) Schadow's fame rests less on his own artistic creations than on the school he formed. In D√ºsseldorf a reaction set in against the spiritual and sacerdotal style he had established and, in 1859, the party of naturalism, after a severe struggle, drove Director Schadow from his chair. He died at D√ºsseldorf in 1862, and a monument was erected in the square which bears his name at a jubilee held to commemorate his directorate. The D√ºsseldorf School that Schadow directed became internationally renowned, attracting such American painters as George Caleb Bingham, Eastman Johnson, Worthington Whittredge, Richard Caton Woodville, William Stanley Haseltine, James M. Hart, and William Morris Hunt and producing the German emigre Emmanuel Leutze.

Biography The Spinner () Born in Rome, he had his father, Johann Gottfried Schadow, at Berlin, for his first master.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 1911 In 1810 he went to Rome and received kindly help from Canova and Thorvaldsen. His talents were versatile; his first independent work was a figure of Paris, and it had for its companion a spinning girl. The latter, a portrayal of a young girl spinning, proved to be extremely popular among visitors to Rome, and even admirers of the work of Canova and Thorvaldensen acknowledged its worth. Schadow made several other versions of the work, the first probably between 1814 and 1816. The King of Prussia, Prince Esterhazy and the Duke of Devonshire all expressed a wish to include this statue in their collections. One version completed in 1820 is on display in the Hermitage, which acquired it from the Znamenka Palace, near St. Petersburg, in 1930. Putting on a sandal () Embracing the Roman Catholic faith, he produced statues of John the Baptist and of the Virgin and Child. In England he became known by bas-reliefs executed for the Duke of Devonshire and for the Marquess of Lansdowne. His last composition, commissioned by the king of Prussia, was a colossal group, Achilles with the Body of Penthesilea; the model, universally admired for its antique character and the largeness of its style, had not been carried out in marble when in 1822 the artist died in Rome.

The son of Thomas A. Fox and Flora McQuarrie, Fox was born in Balmoral, Manitoba. He was educated at the University of Manitoba and the Manitoba Medical College. He subsequently practiced as a doctor. He reached the rank of Captain in the Canadian Army Medical Corps. In Manitoba's 1936 provincial election, Fox was elected as a Social Credit candidate in the riding of Gilbert Plains. The newly formed party did not have a leader during the election, and Fox was subsequently chosen to head its parliamentary caucus. Soon after being chosen as leader, Fox offered to support the government of Liberal-Progressive Premier John Bracken, who had been reduced to a minority and was unable to find allies elsewhere. There were some discussions for a formal coalition, but these came to nothing, and Social Credit supported the minority government from the outside until 1940. Fox stepped down as the party's parliamentary leader in 1937, in favour of S.E. Rogers. He supported Social Credit's decision to join the government in 1940, and was re-elected in 1941 and 1945. In 1937, Fox was charged with performing an illegal operation on Miss Alice Bosnell. However, charges were dropped because Bosnell, married to Dr. Fox earlier that year, could not be compelled to testify against her husband. Fox planned to run for re-election in the 1949 campaign, but lost the coalition nomination to Ray Mitchell of the Liberal-Progressive Party. He did not return to political life afterwards, and died on March 22, 1984.

He was a leading Scottish climber of his day, particularly excelling on winter routes. He died in a climbing accident at the age of 38. He was probably best known for his humorous songs and prose about climbing, many of which were published posthumously in the collection One Man's Mountains. Early life Patey was born on 20 February 1932 at Ellon, Aberdeenshire. He was educated at Ellon Academy and Robert Gordon's College in Aberdeen. He studied medicine at the University of Aberdeen, graduating in 1955 with a MB ChB. Medical career Patey worked for ten years as a general practitioner (GP) in Ullapool, in the far north-west of Scotland. He served for four years as Surgeon Lieutenant in the Royal Marines at the 42 Commando School at Bickleigh. Climbing Patey first became interested in climbing while he was in the Scouts, but it was at University in Aberdeen, that he first revealed his full talent as an exploratory climber, captaining the Lairig Club. Much of his early exploratory routes were on Lochnagar and neighbouring Cairngorms. A dedicated climber, he often dropped all other commitments for the prospect of a good climb. Patey's preference of travelling light extended to leaving his gloves behind on some ice climbs and he had a disrespect for climbing ropes unless they were necessary. While he was at Bickleigh, he would regularly open up new climbs on the Devon Tors. He cared little about recording these climbing details, since that way, if routes were left unblemished and apparently virgin, those following could have a similar excitement in their experience. This generosity of spirit, along with his exuberance and irrepressive energy, left a lasting memory with his companions. His irreverent climbing songs would often be accompanied at a piano by incessant humming through a comb and paper. He climbed extensively in Scotland, (making the first winter traverse of the Cuillin ridge with Hamish MacInnes, David Crabbe and Brian Robertson in 1965), as well as achieving notable ascents in the Alps and the Karakoram including the first ascent of the Muztagh Tower (7273 metres) with John Hartog, Joe Brown and Ian McNaught- Davis in 1956 and Rakaposhi (7788 m) in 1958 with Mike Banks. In 1968, he and Ian Clough were the first to climb Am Buachaille, a sea stack off the coast of Sutherland.Sandwood Bay on walkhighlands.co.uk He, Rusty Baillie and Chris Bonington pioneered the route up the Old Man of Hoy which was repeated with others on a live televised BBC outside broadcast on 8‚Äì9 July 1967. In 1966 he received a Queen's Commendation for Brave Conduct, after assisting in an incident where two climbers were killed after a fall. On 25 May 1970 he fell and died while abseiling from The Maiden, a sea stack off Whiten Head on the Sutherland coast. Bibliography *One Man's Mountains, Tom Patey, 1971, .

His most iconic work is the chariot on top of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, executed in 1793 when he was still only 29.https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gottfried-Schadow Biography Schadow was born in Berlin, where his father was a poor tailor. Frederica of Prussia His first teacher was the sculptor Tassaert, patronized by Frederick the Great; the master offered his daughter in marriage, but the pupil preferred to elope with a Jewish girl, Marianne Devidel, to Vienna, and the father-in-law not only condoned the offence but furnished money wherewith to visit Italy.Hertz, Deborah. Jewish High Society In Old Regime Berlin, 2005. Three years' study in Rome formed his style, and in 1788 he returned to Berlin to succeed Tassaert as sculptor to the court and secretary to the Prussian Academy of Arts. Over half a century he produced upwards of two hundred works, varied in style as in subjects. Melanchthon with Luther behind, by Schadow, Melanchthon House Museum, Wittenberg Schadow's grave in Berlin Among his ambitious efforts are Frederick the Great in Stettin, Bl√ºcher in Rostock and Luther in Wittenberg. His portrait statues include Frederick the Great playing the flute, and the crown-princess Louise and her sister Frederica. His busts, of which there are more than one hundred, include seventeen colossal heads in the Walhalla, Ratisbon; Goethe, Wieland, and Fichte were modelled from life. Prinzessinengruppe: Schadow's famous statue of Friederica (right), with her sister, Louise Of church monuments and memorial works thirty are enumerated; yet Schadow hardly ranks among Christian sculptors. He is claimed by classicists and idealists: the quadriga on the Brandenburger Tor and the allegorical frieze on the facade of the Royal Mint, both in Berlin, are judged among the happiest studies from the antique. Schadow, as director of the Berlin Academy, had great influence. He wrote on the proportions of the human figure, on national physiognomy, etc.; and many volumes by himself and others describe and illustrate his method and his work. Drawing of Harry Maitey, chalk and graphite, October 26, 1824 His interest in physiognomy is documented by the drawing he made of Harry Maitey, the first Hawaiian in Prussia. Today, some of his sculptures and busts are displayed in the Friedrichswerdersche Kirche and the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin. Schadow developed a friendship with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe when at first Goethe's son visited Schadow in Weimar. Schadow created 12 bronze medals of Goethe. One such medal is in the property of the British Museum.Bronze medal of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, by Johann Gottfried Schadow, Explore, Highlights, British Museum, retrieved 4 June 2012. In 2009, one such medal was bestowed by the Goethe Institute upon Dr. Daisaku Ikeda in recognition of his contributions to peace and Goethe's philosophy. He died in Berlin in 1850. His sons Rudolph and Friedrich Wilhelm were notable for sculpture and painting, respectively. He was the grandfather of admiral Felix von Bendemann of the German Imperial Navy.Judentum in Deutschland, Luebeck-kunterbunt.de Family He was uncle to the sculptor Emil Wolff.

UEFI replaces the legacy Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) firmware interface originally present in all IBM PC-compatible personal computers, with most UEFI firmware implementations providing support for legacy BIOS services. UEFI can support remote diagnostics and repair of computers, even with no operating system installed. Intel developed the original Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) specifications. Some of the EFI's practices and data formats mirror those of Microsoft Windows.IBM PC Real Time Clock should run in UT. Cl.cam.ac.uk. Retrieved on 30 October 2013. In 2005, UEFI deprecated EFI 1.10 (the final release of EFI). The Unified EFI Forum is the industry body that manages the UEFI specifications throughout.  History  The original motivation for EFI came during early development of the first Intel‚ÄìHP Itanium systems in the mid-1990s. BIOS limitations (such as 16-bit processor mode, 1 MB addressable space and PC AT hardware) had become too restrictive for the larger server platforms Itanium was targeting. The effort to address these concerns began in 1998 and was initially called Intel Boot Initiative. It was later renamed to Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI). In July 2005, Intel ceased its development of the EFI specification at version 1.10, and contributed it to the Unified EFI Forum, which has developed the specification as the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). The original EFI specification remains owned by Intel, which exclusively provides licenses for EFI-based products, but the UEFI specification is owned by the UEFI Forum. Version 2.0 of the UEFI specification was released on 31 January 2006. It added cryptography and \\"secure boot\\". Version 2.1 of the UEFI specification was released on 7 January 2007. It added network authentication and the user interface architecture ('Human Interface Infrastructure' in UEFI). The latest UEFI specification, version 2.8, was approved in March 2019. Tiano was the first open source UEFI implementation and was released by Intel in 2004. Tiano has since then been superseded by EDK and EDK2 and is now maintained by the TianoCore community. In December 2018, Microsoft announced Project Mu, a fork of TianoCore EDK2 used in Microsoft Surface and Hyper-V products. The project promotes the idea of Firmware as a Service.  Advantages  The interface defined by the EFI specification includes data tables that contain platform information, and boot and runtime services that are available to the OS loader and OS. UEFI firmware provides several technical advantages over a traditional BIOS system: * Ability to use large disks partitions (over 2 TB) with a GUID Partition Table (GPT) * CPU-independent architecture * CPU-independent drivers * Flexible pre- OS environment, including network capability * Modular design * Backward and forward compatibility  Disadvantages  * the higher abstraction layer and the ability to run UEFI applications opens the door to rootkits, which were already spotted in the wild. * many argue that UEFI introduces an unnecessary complexity that won't be used by the operating systems anyway, one of the most prominent speakers being Linus Torvalds. Not many mainline OSes take advantage of the CPU-independent drivers nor the flexible and modular design, and every OS needs a native driver.  Compatibility  = Processor compatibility = As of version 2.5, processor bindings exist for Itanium, x86, x86-64, ARM (AArch32) and ARM64 (AArch64).UEFI Specification 2.4, section 2.3 Only little- endian processors can be supported.UEFI specification 2.3.1, section 1.8.1. Unofficial UEFI support is under development for POWERPC64 by implementing TianoCore on top of OPAL, the OpenPOWER abstraction layer, running in little- endian mode. Similar projects exist for MIPS and RISC-V. As of UEFI 2.7, RISC-V processor bindings have been officially established for 32-, 64- and 128-bit modes.http://www.uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Spec_2_7.pdf Standard PC BIOS is limited to a 16-bit processor mode and 1 MB of addressable memory space, resulting from the design based on the IBM 5150 that used a 16-bit Intel 8088 processor. In comparison, the processor mode in a UEFI environment can be either 32-bit (x86-32, AArch32) or 64-bit (x86-64, Itanium, and AArch64). 64-bit UEFI firmware implementations support long mode, which allows applications in the preboot execution environment to use 64-bit addressing to get direct access to all of the machine's memory. UEFI requires the firmware and operating system loader (or kernel) to be size-matched; for example, a 64-bit UEFI firmware implementation can load only a 64-bit operating system (OS) boot loader or kernel. After the system transitions from \\"Boot Services\\" to \\"Runtime Services\\", the operating system kernel takes over. At this point, the kernel can change processor modes if it desires, but this bars usage of the runtime services (unless the kernel switches back again). As of version 3.15, the Linux kernel supports 64-bit kernels to be booted on 32-bit UEFI firmware implementations running on x86-64 CPUs, with UEFI handover support from a UEFI boot loader as the requirement. UEFI handover protocol deduplicates the UEFI initialization code between the kernel and UEFI boot loaders, leaving the initialization to be performed only by the Linux kernel's UEFI boot stub. = Disk device compatibility = In addition to the standard PC disk partition scheme that uses a master boot record (MBR), UEFI also works with the GUID Partition Table (GPT) partitioning scheme, which is free from many of the limitations of MBR. In particular, the MBR limits on the number and size of disk partitions (up to four primary partitions per disk, and up to 2 TiB per disk) are relaxed. More specifically, GPT allows for a maximum disk and partition size of 8 ZiB .  Linux  Support for GPT in Linux is enabled by turning on the option \`CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION\` (EFI GUID Partition Support) during kernel configuration. This option allows Linux to recognize and use GPT disks after the system firmware passes control over the system to Linux. For reverse compatibility, Linux can use GPT disks in BIOS- based systems for both data storage and booting, as both GRUB 2 and Linux are GPT-aware. Such a setup is usually referred to as BIOS-GPT. As GPT incorporates the protective MBR, a BIOS-based computer can boot from a GPT disk using a GPT-aware boot loader stored in the protective MBR's bootstrap code area. In the case of GRUB, such a configuration requires a BIOS boot partition for GRUB to embed its second-stage code due to absence of the post- MBR gap in GPT partitioned disks (which is taken over by the GPT's Primary Header and Primary Partition Table). Commonly 1 MiB in size, this partition's Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) in GPT scheme is and is used by GRUB only in BIOS-GPT setups. From GRUB's perspective, no such partition type exists in case of MBR partitioning. This partition is not required if the system is UEFI-based because no embedding of the second-stage code is needed in that case. UEFI systems can access GPT disks and boot directly from them, which allows Linux to use UEFI boot methods. Booting Linux from GPT disks on UEFI systems involves creation of an EFI system partition (ESP), which contains UEFI applications such as bootloaders, operating system kernels, and utility software. Such a setup is usually referred to as UEFI-GPT, while ESP is recommended to be at least 512 MiB in size and formatted with a FAT32 filesystem for maximum compatibility. For backward compatibility, most UEFI implementations also support booting from MBR-partitioned disks, through the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) that provides legacy BIOS compatibility. In that case, booting Linux on UEFI systems is the same as on legacy BIOS-based systems.  Microsoft Windows  The 64-bit versions of Windows Vista SP1 and later can boot from disks with a partition size larger than 2 TB.  Features  = Services = EFI defines two types of services: boot services and runtime services. Boot services are available only while the firmware owns the platform (i.e., before the \`ExitBootServices\` call), and they include text and graphical consoles on various devices, and bus, block and file services. Runtime services are still accessible while the operating system is running; they include services such as date, time and NVRAM access. In addition, the Graphics Output Protocol (GOP) provides limited runtime services support; see also Graphics features section below. The operating system is permitted to directly write to the framebuffer provided by GOP during runtime mode. However, the ability to change video modes is lost after transitioning to runtime services mode until the OS graphics driver is loaded. ; Variable services : UEFI variables provide a way to store data, in particular non- volatile data, that is shared between platform firmware and operating systems or UEFI applications. Variable namespaces are identified by GUIDs, and variables are key/value pairs. For example, variables can be used to keep crash messages in NVRAM after a crash for the operating system to retrieve after a reboot. ; Time services : UEFI provides device-independent time services. Time services include support for time zone and daylight saving fields, which allow the hardware real-time clock to be set to local time or UTC.UEFI specification, section 7.3 On machines using a PC-AT real-time clock, by default the hardware clock still has to be set to local time for compatibility with BIOS-based Windows, unless using recent versions and an entry in the Windows registry is set to indicate the use of UTC. = Applications = Interaction between the EFI boot manager and EFI drivers Beyond loading an OS, UEFI can run UEFI applications, which reside as files on the EFI System Partition. They can be executed from the UEFI Shell, by the firmware's boot manager, or by other UEFI applications. UEFI applications can be developed and installed independently of the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). A type of UEFI application is an OS boot loader such as GRUB, rEFInd, Gummiboot, and Windows Boot Manager; which loads some OS files into memory and executes it. Also, an OS boot loader can provide a user interface to allow the selection of another UEFI application to run. Utilities like the UEFI Shell are also UEFI applications. = Protocols = EFI defines protocols as a set of software interfaces used for communication between two binary modules. All EFI drivers must provide services to others via protocols. = Device drivers = In addition to standard processor architecture-specific device drivers, EFI provides for a processor-independent device driver stored in non-volatile memory as EFI byte code or EBC. System firmware has an interpreter for EBC images. In that sense, EBC is analogous to Open Firmware, the hardware-independent firmware used in PowerPC-based Apple Macintosh and Sun Microsystems SPARC computers, among others. Some architecture-specific (non-EFI Byte Code) EFI drivers for some device types can have interfaces for use by the OS. This allows the OS to rely on EFI for drivers to perform basic graphics and network functions before, and if, operating-system-specific drivers are loaded. In other cases, the EFI driver can be filesystem drivers that allow for booting from other types of disk volumes. Examples include efifs for 37 file systems (based on GRUB2 code), used by Rufus for chain- loading NTFS ESPs. = Graphics features = The EFI specification defined a UGA (Universal Graphic Adapter) protocol as a way to support device- independent graphics. UEFI did not include UGA and replaced it with GOP (Graphics Output Protocol), with the explicit goal of removing VGA hardware dependencies. The two are similar. UEFI 2.1 defined a \\"Human Interface Infrastructure\\" (HII) to manage user input, localized strings, fonts, and forms (in the HTML sense). These enable original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or independent BIOS vendors (IBVs) to design graphical interfaces for pre-boot configuration. Most early UEFI firmware implementations were console- based. Today many UEFI firmware implementations are GUI-based. = EFI system partition = An EFI system partition, often abbreviated to ESP, is a data storage device partition that is used in computers adhering to the UEFI specification. Accessed by the UEFI firmware when a computer is powered up, it stores UEFI applications and the files these applications need to run, including operating system boot loaders. Supported partition table schemes include MBR and GPT, as well as El Torito volumes on optical disks. For use on ESPs, UEFI defines a specific version of the FAT file system, which is maintained as part of the UEFI specification and independently from the original FAT specification, encompassing a variant of the FAT32 file system on ESPs, and FAT16 and FAT12 file systems on removable media. The ESP also provides space for a boot sector as part of the backward BIOS compatibility. = Booting =  UEFI booting  Unlike the legacy PC BIOS, UEFI does not rely on boot sectors, defining instead a boot manager as part of the UEFI specification. When a computer is powered on, the boot manager checks the boot configuration and based on its settings, loads into memory and then executes the specified OS boot loader or operating system kernel. The boot configuration is defined by variables stored in NVRAM, including variables that indicate the file system paths to OS loaders or OS kernels. OS boot loaders can be automatically detected by UEFI, which enables easy booting from removable devices such as USB flash drives. This automated detection relies on standardized file paths to the OS boot loader, with the path varying depending on the computer architecture. The format of the file path is defined as ; for example, the file path to the OS loader on an x86-64 system is , and on ARM64 architecture. Booting UEFI systems from GPT-partitioned disks is commonly called UEFI-GPT booting. Despite the fact that the UEFI specification requires MBR partition tables to be fully supported, some UEFI firmware implementations immediately switch to the BIOS-based CSM booting depending on the type of boot disk's partition table, effectively preventing UEFI booting to be performed from EFI System Partition on MBR-partitioned disks. Such a boot scheme is commonly called UEFI-MBR. It is also common for a boot manager to have a textual user interface so the user can select the desired OS (or system utility) from a list of available boot options.  CSM booting  To ensure backward compatibility, most UEFI firmware implementations on PC-class machines also support booting in legacy BIOS mode from MBR-partitioned disks, through the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) that provides legacy BIOS compatibility. In this scenario, booting is performed in the same way as on legacy BIOS-based systems, by ignoring the partition table and relying on the content of a boot sector. BIOS-style booting from MBR-partitioned disks is commonly called BIOS-MBR, regardless of it being performed on UEFI or legacy BIOS-based systems. Furthermore, booting legacy BIOS-based systems from GPT disks is also possible, and such a boot scheme is commonly called BIOS-GPT. The Compatibility Support Module allows legacy operating systems and some option ROMs that do not support UEFI to still be used. It also provides required legacy System Management Mode (SMM) functionality, called CompatibilitySmm, as an addition to features provided by the UEFI SMM. This is optional and highly chipset- and platform-specific. An example of such a legacy SMM functionality is providing USB legacy support for keyboard and mouse, by emulating their classic PS/2 counterparts. In November 2017, Intel announced that it planned to phase out support for CSM by 2020.  Network booting  The UEFI specification includes support for booting over network via the Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE). PXE booting use network protocols include Internet Protocol (IPv4 and IPv6), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) and iSCSI. OS images can be remotely stored on storage area networks (SANs), with Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) and Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) as supported protocols for accessing the SANs. Version 2.5 of the UEFI specification adds support for accessing boot images over the HTTP protocol.  Secure boot  The UEFI 2.3.1 Errata C specification (or higher) defines a protocol known as secure boot, which can secure the boot process by preventing the loading of drivers or OS loaders that are not signed with an acceptable digital signature. The mechanical details of how precisely these drivers are to be signed are not specified. When secure boot is enabled, it is initially placed in \\"setup\\" mode, which allows a public key known as the \\"platform key\\" (PK) to be written to the firmware. Once the key is written, secure boot enters \\"User\\" mode, where only drivers and loaders signed with the platform key can be loaded by the firmware. Additional \\"key exchange keys\\" (KEK) can be added to a database stored in memory to allow other certificates to be used, but they must still have a connection to the private portion of the platform key. Secure boot can also be placed in \\"Custom\\" mode, where additional public keys can be added to the system that do not match the private key. Secure boot is supported by Windows 8 and 8.1, Windows Server 2012, and 2012 R2, and Windows 10, VMware vSphere 6.5 and a number of Linux distributions including Fedora (since version 18), openSUSE (since version 12.3), RHEL (since version 7), CentOS (since version 7HowTos/UEFI - CentOS Wiki), Debian (since version 10), and Ubuntu (since version 12.04.2). , FreeBSD support is in a planning stage. = UEFI shell = UEFI provides a shell environment, which can be used to execute other UEFI applications, including UEFI boot loaders. Apart from that, commands available in the UEFI shell can be used for obtaining various other information about the system or the firmware, including getting the memory map (\`memmap\`), modifying boot manager variables (\`bcfg\`), running partitioning programs (\`diskpart\`), loading UEFI drivers, and editing text files (\`edit\`). Source code for a UEFI shell can be downloaded from the Intel's TianoCore UDK/EDK2 project. A pre-build ShellBinPkg is also available. Shell v2 works best in UEFI 2.3+ systems and is recommended over the shell v1 in those systems. Shell v1 should work in all UEFI systems. Methods used for launching UEFI shell depend on the manufacturer and model of the system motherboard. Some of them already provide a direct option in firmware setup for launching, e.g. compiled x86-64 version of the shell needs to be made available as \`/SHELLX64.EFI\`. Some other systems have an already embedded UEFI shell which can be launched by appropriate key press combinations. For other systems, the solution is either creating an appropriate USB flash drive or adding manually (\`bcfg\`) a boot option associated with the compiled version of shell. Commands The following is a list of commands supported by the EFI shell. * help * guid * set * alias * dh * unload * map * mount * cd * echo * pause * ls * mkdir * mode * cp * comp * rm * memmap * type * dmpstore * load * ver * err * time * date * stall * reset * vol * attrib * cls * bcfg * edit * Edd30 * dblk * pci * mm * mem * EddDebug = Extensions = Extensions to UEFI can be loaded from virtually any non-volatile storage device attached to the computer. For example, an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) can distribute systems with an EFI system partition on the hard drive, which would add additional functions to the standard UEFI firmware stored on the motherboard's ROM. = UEFI Capsule = UEFI Capsule defines a Firmware-to-OS, modern and secure firmware update interfacehttps://edk2-docs.gitbook.io/understanding- the-uefi-secure-boot-chain/secure_boot_chain_in_uefi/signed-capsule-update. Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and Fwupd for Linux support the UEFI Capsule.  UEFI classes  UEFI machines can have one of the following \\"classes\\", which were used to help ease the transition to UEFI. Intel has ended UEFI CSM in 2020. * Class 0: Legacy BIOS * Class 1: UEFI in CSM-only mode (i.e. no UEFI booting) * Class 2: UEFI with CSM * Class 3: UEFI without CSM * Class 3+: UEFI with Secure Boot Enabled  Boot stages  = SEC - Security Phase = This is the first stage of the UEFI boot but may have platform specific binary code that precedes it. (e.g., Intel ME, AMD PSP). Minimal code written in assembly for the specific architecture. It initializes a temporary memory (often CPU cache as RAM) and serves as the system‚Äôs software root of trust with the option of verifying PEI before hand-off. = PEI - Pre-EFI Initialization = The second stage of UEFI boot consists of a dependency-aware dispatcher that loads and runs PEI modules (PEIMs) to handle early hardware initialization tasks such as main memory initialization and recovery operations. Additionally, it is responsible for discovery of the current boot mode and handling many ACPI S0ix/S3 operations. In the case of ACPI S0ix/S3 resume, it is responsible for restoring many hardware registers to a pre-sleep state. PEI also uses CPU cache as RAM. = DXE - Driver Execution Environment = This stage also consist of C modules and a dependency-aware dispatcher. With main memory now available, most hardware drivers, feature code, PCI bus, and runtime services (UEFI -> OS services) are initialized. = BDS - Boot Device Select = In this stage, input and output devices are typically initialized, drivers or Option ROMs on PCI devices are executed according to system configuration, and boot options are processed for availability, ordering, and device matching. = TSL - Transient System Load = This is the stage between boot selection and hand-off to the OS. At this point one may enter setup, UEFI shell, or execute an EFI application such as the OS boot loader. = RT - Runtime = The UEFI hands off to the OS. A UEFI compatible OS is now responsible for exiting boot services triggering the firmware to unload all no longer needed code and data, leaving only System Management Mode (SMM) and runtime service code/data. When a legacy OS is used, CSM will handle this call ensuring the system is compatible with legacy BIOS expectations.  Implementation and adoption  = Intel EFI = Intel's implementation of EFI is the Intel Platform Innovation Framework, codenamed Tiano. Tiano runs on Intel's XScale, Itanium and IA-32 processors, and is proprietary software, although a portion of the code has been released under the BSD license or Eclipse Public License (EPL) as TianoCore. TianoCore can be used as a payload for coreboot. Phoenix Technologies' implementation of UEFI is branded as SecureCore Technology (SCT). American Megatrends offers its own UEFI firmware implementation known as Aptio, while Insyde Software offers InsydeH2O, its own implementation of Tiano. In December 2018, Microsoft released an open source version of its TianoCore EDK2-based UEFI implementation from the Surface line, Project Mu. = Das U-Boot = An implementation of the UEFI API was introduced into the Universal Boot Loader (Das U-Boot) in 2017. On the ARMv8 architecture Linux distributions use the U-Boot UEFI implementation in conjunction with GNU GRUB for booting (e.g. SUSE Linux), the same holds true for OpenBSD. For booting from iSCSI iPXE can be used as a UEFI application loaded by U-Boot. = Platforms using EFI/UEFI = Intel's first Itanium workstations and servers, released in 2000, implemented EFI 1.02. Hewlett-Packard's first Itanium 2 systems, released in 2002, implemented EFI 1.10; they were able to boot Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and HP- UX; OpenVMS added UEFI capability in June 2003. In January 2006, Apple Inc. shipped its first Intel-based Macintosh computers. These systems used EFI instead of Open Firmware, which had been used on its previous PowerPC-based systems.Apple Computer. \\"Universal Binary Programming Guidelines, Second Edition: Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) \\" On 5 April 2006, Apple first released Boot Camp, which produces a Windows drivers disk and a non- destructive partitioning tool to allow the installation of Windows XP or Vista without requiring a reinstallation of Mac OS X. A firmware update was also released that added BIOS compatibility to its EFI implementation. Subsequent Macintosh models shipped with the newer firmware.Apple's Transition from Open Firmware to Extensible Firmware Interface, mactech, 2007. During 2005, more than one million Intel systems shipped with Intel's implementation of UEFI. New mobile, desktop and server products, using Intel's implementation of UEFI, started shipping in 2006. For instance, boards that use the Intel 945 chipset series use Intel's UEFI firmware implementation. Since 2005, EFI has also been implemented on non-PC architectures, such as embedded systems based on XScale cores. The EDK (EFI Developer Kit) includes an NT32 target, which allows EFI firmware and EFI applications to run within a Windows application. But no direct hardware access is allowed by EDK NT32. This means only a subset of EFI application and drivers can be executed at the EDK NT32 target. In 2008, more x86-64 systems adopted UEFI some of them using the rEFInd GUI boot menu. While many of these systems still allow booting only the BIOS-based OSes via the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) (thus not appearing to the user to be UEFI- based), other systems started to allow booting UEFI-based OSes. For example, IBM x3450 server, MSI motherboards with ClickBIOS, all HP EliteBook Notebook and Tablet PCs, newer HP Compaq Notebook PCs (e.g., 6730b, 6735b, etc.). In 2009, IBM shipped System x machines (x3550 M2, x3650 M2, iDataPlex dx360 M2) and BladeCenter HS22 with UEFI capability. Dell shipped PowerEdge T610, R610, R710, M610 and M710 servers with UEFI capability. More commercially available systems are mentioned in a UEFI whitepaper. In 2011, major vendors (such as ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte, and MSI) launched several consumer-oriented motherboards using the Intel 6-series LGA 1155 chipset and AMD 9 Series AM3+ chipsets with UEFI.Asus P67 Motherboard Preview. With the release of Windows 8 in October 2012, Microsoft's certification requirements now require that computers include firmware that implements the UEFI specification. Furthermore, if the computer supports the \\"Connected Standby\\" feature of Windows 8 (which allows devices to have power management comparable to smartphones, with an almost instantaneous return from standby mode), then the firmware is not permitted to contain a Compatibility Support Module (CSM). As such, systems that support Connected Standby are incapable of booting Legacy BIOS operating systems. In October 2017, Intel announced that it would remove legacy PC BIOS support from all its products by 2020, in favor of UEFI Class 3. = Operating systems = An operating system that can be booted from a (U)EFI is called a (U)EFI-aware operating system, defined by (U)EFI specification. Here the term booted from a (U)EFI means directly booting the system using a (U)EFI operating system loader stored on any storage device. The default location for the operating system loader is \`/BOOT/BOOT.EFI\`, where short name of the machine type can be \`IA32\`, \`X64\`, \`IA64\`, \`ARM\` or \`AA64\`. Some operating systems vendors may have their own boot loaders. They may also change the default boot location. * The Linux kernel has been able to use EFI at boot time since early 2000,Announcement of release 3.5pre1 by maintainer Brett Johnson made on 27 February 2004. using the elilo EFI boot loader or, more recently, EFI versions of GRUB. Grub+Linux also supports booting from a GUID partition table without UEFI. The distribution Ubuntu added support for UEFI secure boot as of version 12.10. Furthermore, the Linux kernel can be compiled with the option to run as an EFI bootloader on its own through the EFI bootstub feature. * HP-UX has used (U)EFI as its boot mechanism on IA-64 systems since 2002. * OpenVMS has used EFI on IA-64 since its initial evaluation release in December 2003, and for production releases since January 2005. The x86-64 port of OpenVMS also uses UEFI to boot the operating system. * Apple uses EFI for its line of Intel-based Macs. Mac OS X v10.4 Tiger and Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard implement EFI v1.10 in 32-bit mode even on newer 64-bit CPUs, but full support arrived with OS X v10.8 Mountain Lion. * The Itanium versions of Windows 2000 (Advanced Server Limited Edition and Datacenter Server Limited Edition) implemented EFI 1.10 in 2002. MS Windows Server 2003 for IA-64, MS Windows XP 64-bit Edition and Windows 2000 Advanced Server Limited Edition, all of which are for the Intel Itanium family of processors, implement EFI, a requirement of the platform through the DIG64 specification. * Microsoft introduced UEFI for x64 Windows operating systems with Windows Vista SP1 Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Implementation Guidelines and Windows Server 2008 however only UGA 1.1 is supported; Graphics Output Protocol (GOP) is not supported. Therefore, a few PCs running 64-bit versions of Windows Vista SP1, Windows Vista SP2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2 are compatible with EFI. Boot to UEFI Mode or legacy BIOS mode 32-bit UEFI was originally not supported since vendors did not have any interest in producing native 32-bit UEFI firmware because of the mainstream status of 64-bit computing. Windows 8 finally introduced further optimizations for UEFI systems, including Graphics Output Protocol (GOP) support, Microsoft Basic Display Driver a faster startup, 32-bit UEFI support, and secure boot support. * On 5 March 2013, the FreeBSD Foundation awarded a grant to a developer seeking to add UEFI support to the FreeBSD kernel and bootloader. The changes were initially stored in a discrete branch of the FreeBSD source code, but were merged into the mainline source on 4 April 2014 (revision 264095); the changes include support in the installer as well. * Oracle Solaris 11.1 and later support UEFI boot for x86 systems with UEFI firmware version 2.1 or later. GRUB 2 is used as the boot loader on x86. * OpenBSD 5.9 introduced UEFI boot support for 64-bit x86 systems using its own custom loader, OpenBSD 6.0 extended that support to include ARMv7. = Use of UEFI with virtualization = * HP Integrity Virtual Machines provides UEFI boot on HP Integrity Servers. It also provides a virtualized UEFI environment for the guest UEFI-aware OSes. * Intel hosts an Open Virtual Machine Firmware project on SourceForge. * VMware Fusion 3 software for Mac OS X can boot Mac OS X Server virtual machines using UEFI. * VMware Workstation prior to version 11 unofficially supports UEFI, but is manually enabled by editing the .vmx file. VMware Workstation version 11 and above supports UEFI, independently of whether the physical host system is UEFI-based. VMware Workstation 14 (and accordingly, Fusion 10) adds support for the Secure Boot feature of UEFI. * The vSphere ESXi 5.0 hypervisor officially support UEFI. Version 6.5 adds support for secure boot. * VirtualBox has implemented UEFI since 3.1, but limited to Unix/Linux operating systems and some versions of Windows (does not work with Windows Vista x64 and Windows 7 x64). * QEMU/KVM can be used with the Open Virtual Machine Firmware (OVMF) provided by TianoCore. * The VMware ESXi version 5 hypervisor, part of VMware vSphere, supports virtualized UEFI as an alternative to the legacy PC BIOS inside a virtual machine. * The second generation of the Microsoft Hyper-V virtual machine supports virtualized UEFI. * Google Cloud Platform Shielded VMs support virtualized UEFI to enable Secure Boot.  Applications development  EDK2 Application Development Kit (EADK) makes it possible to use standard C library functions in UEFI applications. EADK can be freely downloaded from the Intel's TianoCore UDK / EDK2 SourceForge project. As an example, a port of the Python interpreter is made available as a UEFI application by using the EADK. The development has moved to GitHub since UDK2015. A minimalistic \\"hello, world\\" C program written using EADK looks similar to its usual C counterpart: #include #include #include EFI_STATUS EFIAPI ShellAppMain(IN UINTN Argc, IN CHAR16 **Argv) { Print(L\\"hello, world \\"); return EFI_SUCCESS; }  Criticism  Numerous digital rights activists have protested against UEFI. Ronald G. Minnich, a co-author of coreboot, and Cory Doctorow, a digital rights activist, have criticized EFI as an attempt to remove the ability of the user to truly control the computer. It does not solve the BIOS's long-standing problems of requiring two different drivers‚Äîone for the firmware and one for the operating system‚Äîfor most hardware. Open-source project TianoCore also provides UEFI interfaces. TianoCore lacks the specialized drivers that initialize chipset functions, which are instead provided by coreboot, of which TianoCore is one of many payload options. The development of coreboot requires cooperation from chipset manufacturers to provide the specifications needed to develop initialization drivers. = Secure boot = In 2011, Microsoft announced that computers certified to run its Windows 8 operating system had to ship with Microsoft's public key enrolled and secure boot enabled. Following the announcement, the company was accused by critics and free software/open source advocates (including the Free Software Foundation) of trying to use the secure boot functionality of UEFI to hinder or outright prevent the installation of alternative operating systems such as Linux. Microsoft denied that the secure boot requirement was intended to serve as a form of lock-in, and clarified its requirements by stating that x86-based systems certified for Windows 8 must allow secure boot to enter custom mode or be disabled, but not on systems using the ARM architecture. Windows 10 allows OEMs to decide whether or not secure boot can be managed by users of their x86 systems. Other developers raised concerns about the legal and practical issues of implementing support for secure boot on Linux systems in general. Former Red Hat developer Matthew Garrett noted that conditions in the GNU General Public License version 3 may prevent the use of the GNU Grand Unified Bootloader without a distribution's developer disclosing the private key (however, the Free Software Foundation has since clarified its position, assuring that the responsibility to make keys available was held by the hardware manufacturer), and that it would also be difficult for advanced users to build custom kernels that could function with secure boot enabled without self-signing them. Other developers suggested that signed builds of Linux with another key could be provided, but noted that it would be difficult to persuade OEMs to ship their computers with the required key alongside the Microsoft key. Several major Linux distributions have developed different implementations for secure boot. Garrett himself developed a minimal bootloader known as a shim, which is a precompiled, signed bootloader that allows the user to individually trust keys provided by distributors. Ubuntu 12.10 uses an older version of shim pre-configured for use with Canonical's own key that verifies only the bootloader and allows unsigned kernels to be loaded; developers believed that the practice of signing only the bootloader is more feasible, since a trusted kernel is effective at securing only the user space, and not the pre-boot state for which secure boot is designed to add protection. That also allows users to build their own kernels and use custom kernel modules as well, without the need to reconfigure the system. Canonical also maintains its own private key to sign installations of Ubuntu pre-loaded on certified OEM computers that run the operating system, and also plans to enforce a secure boot requirement as wellrequiring both a Canonical key and a Microsoft key (for compatibility reasons) to be included in their firmware. Fedora also uses shim, but requires that both the kernel and its modules be signed as well. It has been disputed whether the kernel and its modules must be signed as well; while the UEFI specifications do not require it, Microsoft has asserted that their contractual requirements do, and that it reserves the right to revoke any certificates used to sign code that can be used to compromise the security of the system. In February 2013, another Red Hat developer attempted to submit a patch to the Linux kernel that would allow it to parse Microsoft's authenticode signing using a master X.509 key embedded in PE files signed by Microsoft. However, the proposal was criticized by Linux creator Linus Torvalds, who attacked Red Hat for supporting Microsoft's control over the secure boot infrastructure. On 26 March 2013, the Spanish free software development group Hispalinux filed a formal complaint with the European Commission, contending that Microsoft's secure boot requirements on OEM systems were \\"obstructive\\" and anti-competitive. At the Black Hat conference in August 2013, a group of security researchers presented a series of exploits in specific vendor implementations of UEFI that could be used to exploit secure boot. In August 2016 it was reported that two security researchers had found the \\"golden key\\" security key Microsoft uses in signing operating systems. Technically, no key was exposed, however, an exploitable binary signed by the key was. This allows any software to run as though it was genuinely signed by Microsoft and exposes the possibility of rootkit and bootkit attacks. This also makes patching the fault impossible, since any patch can be replaced (downgraded) by the (signed) exploitable binary. Microsoft responded in a statement that the vulnerability only exists in ARM architecture and Windows RT devices, and has released two patches; however, the patches do not (and cannot) remove the vulnerability, which would require key replacements in end user firmware to fix. Many Linux distributions support UEFI Secure boot now, such as RHEL (RHEL 7 and later), Cent OS (CentOS 7 and later), Ubuntu, Debian (Debian 10 and later), OpenSUSE, SUSE Linux. = Firmware problems = The increased prominence of UEFI firmware in devices has also led to a number of technical problems blamed on their respective implementations. Following the release of Windows 8 in late 2012, it was discovered that certain Lenovo computer models with secure boot had firmware that was hardcoded to allow only executables named \\"Windows Boot Manager\\" or \\"Red Hat Enterprise Linux\\" to load, regardless of any other setting. Other problems were encountered by several Toshiba laptop models with secure boot that were missing certain certificates required for its proper operation. In January 2013, a bug surrounding the UEFI implementation on some Samsung laptops was publicized, which caused them to be bricked after installing a Linux distribution in UEFI mode. While potential conflicts with a kernel module designed to access system features on Samsung laptops were initially blamed (also prompting kernel maintainers to disable the module on UEFI systems as a safety measure), Matthew Garrett discovered that the bug was actually triggered by storing too many UEFI variables to memory, and that the bug could also be triggered under Windows under certain conditions. In conclusion, he determined that the offending kernel module had caused kernel message dumps to be written to the firmware, thus triggering the bug.

The vessel was built in 1970 as HMS Rose to a Phil Bolger design based on the original 18th-century British Admiralty drawings of , a 20-gun sixth- rate post ship from 1757. As HMS Rose The ship was meant to be a close replica of the original Rose, but still fill a commercial function. John Fitzhugh Millar who commissioned the ship build gave Bolger copies of the original British Admiralty drawings, Bolger modified the hull shape below the water line, sharpening up her entry so she sailed to windward better. Unlike some square-riggers, she could sail two points (22-1/2 degrees) on the wind provided that seas remained under four feet or so. Bolger also changed the arrangement of her decks, at the bank's insistence, so that she could be used as a tavern and restaurant, though she was never used as such. Rose was built at the Smith and Rhuland shipyard in Lunenburg, a yard which had established a reputation for large and successful replicas such as HMS in 1960 and in 1963. The ship was inspected and certified by the United States Coast Guard. She spent the first ten years of her life in Newport, Rhode Island sailing in Newport Harbor and as a dockside attraction. In the summer of 1972, Rose was hired for the film \\"The Man Without a Country\\", a made-for-television production. Norman Rosemont Productions couldn't find the money to take the ship out sailing, so all the filming was shot with sails set, as the ship was securely moored to the pier, next to the causeway to Goat Island. During filming Cliff Robertson had to hide that he had a broken leg at the time. In 1984, already in serious disrepair, she was purchased by Kaye Williams and brought to Bridgeport, Connecticut, and operated as a sail training vessel in the 1980s and 1990s, run by the HMS Rose Foundation based in Bridgeport, Connecticut, United States. In her lifetime as Rose, her figurehead had to be replaced twice, each time slightly upgraded. One was damaged in a storm off Bermuda on her way to Norfolk, Virginia in June 1998. The figurehead was named in fun as \\"Chester\\" by the crew. Late in the 1990s, the publisher W. W. Norton & Company rented Rose in New York for a pier-side party to celebrate the publication of Patrick O'Brian's latest novel. O'Brian himself was present, and he casually mentioned to Roses captain Richard Bailey that if Rose were painted in an 1805 colour scheme she would be a \\"dead ringer\\" for the frigate Surprise that appeared in his books. Bailey quickly ordered his crew to get out the paint and make the changes. O'Brian was so impressed that he changed his mind about his prohibition of having any of his books converted into film, and Norton immediately started looking for a Hollywood production company. Replica HMS Rose off Massachusetts in 1971, the hull painted as her namesake Transformation into HMS Surprise The ship was sold to the 20th Century Fox film studio in March 2001, and underwent extensive modifications to be used in the making of the film Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, in which she portrayed the Royal Navy frigate HMS with a story based on several of the books by Patrick O'Brian. The modifications included a reshaped stern, all deck structures removed, the single ship's wheel replaced by a double wheel, period fighting tops fitted, new sails, and the figurehead replaced. Renaming as HMS Surprise After the film was complete, the ship was leased and then purchased by the Maritime Museum of San Diego which has restored her to sailing condition as of September 2007.\\"Reviving Surprise\\"(pdf) David L.

In 1991, The Connecticut General Assembly passed \\"An Act Concerning the HMS Rose\\" in which the ship was commissioned as a vessel of the Connecticut Naval Militia. The act stated that the H.M.S. Rose Foundation was responsible for maintaining the ship, but when the ship was sold to 20th Century Fox, the statute was not repealed and is still in effect.CGS 27-5 - Public Act 91-31 HMS Rose in 2000 painted to resemble the original Surprise coming into Baltimore References External links * Maritime Museum of San Diego page on the Surprise * Photo gallery of Surprise in San Diego, October 2005 Category:1970 ships Category:Ships built in Nova Scotia Category:Maritime Museum of San Diego Category:Museum ships in San Diego Category:Individual sailing vessels Category:Sail training ships Category:Tall ships of the United States Category:Replica ships ","title":"HMS Surprise (replica ship)"},{"id":"866069","text":"Andrei Donatovich Sinyavsky (; 8 October 1925 ‚Äì 25 February 1997) was a Russian writer and Soviet dissident known as a defendant in the Sinyavsky‚ÄìDaniel trial in 1965. Sinyavsky was a literary critic for Novy Mir and wrote works critical of Soviet society under the pseudonym Abram Tertz () published in the West to avoid censorship in the Soviet Union. Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel were convicted of Anti-Soviet agitation in a show trial, becoming the first Soviet writers convicted solely for their works and for fiction, and served six years at a Gulag camp. Sinyavsky emigrated to France in 1973 where he became a professor of Russian literature and published numerous autobiographical and retrospective works. Early life and education Andrei Donatovich Sinyavsky was born on 8 October 1925 in Moscow, Soviet Union, the son of Donat Evgenievich Sinyavsky, a Russian nobleman from Syzran who became a member of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, and a mother of a Russian peasant background. Donat was arrested several times by the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution as an \\"enemy of the people\\", and during his last stay in jail the medical authorities took his electroencephalographic reading. Sinyavsky described his father's experiences in the autobiographical novel Goodnight!. Sinyavsky's family was evacuated to Syzran following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, where he graduated from school in 1943. Sinyavsky was drafted into the Red Army after graduation and served as a radio engineer at an airport. In 1945, Sinyavsky became a philology student at Moscow State University, becoming a full-time student following his demobilization from the Red Army the next year, and studied the works of Vladimir Mayakovsky. Sinyavsky graduated in 1949 and attended a graduate school where he successfully defended his thesis in 1952. Sinyavsky worked at the Gorky Institute of World Literature in Moscow and taught at Moscow State University's Faculty of Journalism and the Moscow Art Theatre School. By the end of 1960, Sinyavsky was admitted into the Union of Soviet Writers. Sinyavsky became one of the leading literary critics of the Novy Mir magazine, at the time headed by Aleksandr Tvardovsky. In the early 1960s, Novy Mir was considered the most liberal legal publications in the Soviet Union and began leaning towards a dissident position. In November 1962, Novy Mir became famous for publishing Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's groundbreaking One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, a novella about a prisoner of the Gulag. Sinyavsky, a prot√©g√© of Boris Pasternak, described the realities of Soviet life in short fiction stories which were often critical in nature. Sinyavsky published his novels in the West under the pseudonym Abram Tertz, derived from the name of a historical Russian Jewish gangster although Sinyavsky himself was not Jewish. Sinyavsky's works were naturally rejected for publication by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) during a time of extreme censorship in the Soviet Union. Sinyavsky‚ÄìDaniel trial On 4 September 1965, Sinyavsky was arrested along with fellow-writer and friend Yuli Daniel, and tried in the first Soviet show trial during which writers were openly convicted solely for their literary work. Sinyavsky and Daniel were arrested as part of widespread political repression in the Soviet Union due to their works critical of Soviet life being published abroad. Legally, Sinyavsky and Daniel could not be charged for their publications outside the Soviet Union, and instead were charged under Article 70 of the RSFSR Criminal Code for producing materials for Anti-Soviet agitation. This was the first time Anti-Soviet laws were applied to works of fiction. Dozens of Soviet writers and intellectuals came to the defence of Sinyavsky and Daniel, and on 5 December 1965 held the Glasnost meeting in Moscow, the first spontaneous public political demonstration in the Soviet Union after the Second World War. The Sinyavsky‚ÄìDaniel trial was accompanied by harsh propaganda campaigns in the Soviet media, perceived as a sign of demise of the Khrushchev Thaw which had allowed greater freedoms of expression during the late 1950s and early 1960s. On 14 February 1966, Sinyavsky was sentenced to seven years on charges of \\"anti-Soviet activity\\" for the opinions of his fictional characters. After the trial, 63 supporters of Sinyavsky and Daniel signed a petition requesting their release. In response to the petition, members of the Secretariat of the Union of Soviet Writers spoke out against Sinyavsky and Daniel. As historian Fred Coleman writes, \\"Historians now have no difficulty pinpointing the birth of the modern Soviet dissident movement. It began in February 1966 with the trial of Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel, two Russian writers who ridiculed the Communist regime in satires smuggled abroad and published under pen names... Little did they realize at the time that they were starting a movement that would help end Communist rule.\\" Sinyavsky was forced to work as a stevedore at the Dubravlag, a labor camp (katorga) of the Gulag system located near Yavas, Mordovian ASSR. Sinyavsky was released early in 1971 as part of an initiative by Yuri Andropov, the Chairman of the KGB and the future General Secretary of the CPSU. Later years and death In 1973, Sinyavsky was allowed to emigrate to France at the invitation of Claude Frioux, a professor at the University of Paris 8 Vincennes-Saint-Denis specializing in Russia. Sinyavsky became a professor of Russian literature at Sorbonne University, co-founded the Russian-language almanac Sintaksis with his wife Maria Rozanova, and actively contributed to Radio Liberty.Andrei Sinyavsky RADIO LIBERTY: 50 YEARS OF BROADCASTING. Hoover Inst, Stanford University Sinyavsky and Rozanova's son, Iegor Gran, graduated from √âcole Centrale Paris and became a novelist. On 17 October 1991, Sinyavsky was featured in a report received by Izvestia on the review of convictions for several prominent Soviet individuals due to lack of corpus delicti in their actions. Sinyavsky, Yuli Daniel, KƒÅrlis Ulmanis, Nikolay Timofeev-Ressovsky were considered for \\"rehabilitation\\" only two months before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In early 1996, Sinyavsky suffered a heart attack, and later that year was diagnosed with lung cancer with metastases in the brain. Sinyavsky underwent unsuccessful operations and radiotherapy at the Curie Institute. Sinyavsky died in 1997 in Fontenay-aux-Roses, near Paris, and was buried there by the Russian Orthodox priest and writer Vladimir Vigilyansky with Andrei Voznesensky in attendance. Andrei Sinyavsky's grave (Cimeti√®re communal de Fontenay-aux-Roses, Rue des Pierrelais 18) Sinyavsky was the catalyst for the formation of the Russian-English translation team of Larissa Volokhonsky and Richard Pevear, who have translated a number of works by Mikhail Bulgakov, Anton Chekhov, Fyodor Dostoyevski, Nikolai Gogol, and Leo Tolstoy. Volokhonsky, who was born and raised in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), first visited the United States in the early 1970s and happened across Pevear's Hudson Review article about Sinyavsky. At the time, Pevear believed Sinyavsky was still in a Russian prison; Volokhonsky had just helped him immigrate to Paris. Pevear was surprised and pleased to be mistaken: \\"Larissa had just helped Sinyavsky leave Russia,\\" Pevear recalled. \\"And she let me know that, while I'd said he was still in prison, he was actually in Paris. I was glad to know it.\\" Bibliography ;Books * On Socialist Realism (1959) criticised the poor quality of the drearily positive-toned, conflict-free strictures in the style of the state-backed socialist realism, and called for a return to the fantastic in Soviet literature, the tradition, Sinyavsky said, of Gogol and Vladimir Mayakovsky. This work also drew connections between socialist realism and classicism. It asserted that greater similarities exist between Soviet literature and that predating the 19th century than exist between Soviet (socialist realist) literature and the intellectual skepticism plaguing the protagonists of 19th-century Russian novels. * The Trial Begins (1960) is a short novel with characters reacting in different ways to their roles in a totalitarian society, told with elements of the fantastic. * The Makepeace Experiment (1963) is an allegorical novel of Russia where a leader uses non- rational powers to rule. * Fantastic Stories (1963) is a collection of short stories, such as \\"The Icicle\\".

It formerly included all other Philippine tarictic hornbills as subspecies, in which case the common name of the 'combined species' was shortened to tarictic hornbill. Taxonomy The Visayan hornbill was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Buceros panini in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. The type locality is the island of Panay in the Philippines. The Visayan hornbill is now placed in the genus Penelopides that was introduced in 1849 by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in a plate of the hornbills. The origin of the generic name is uncertain but it may be a combination of the Latin pene meaning \\"almost\\" or \\"nearly\\", the Ancient Greek lophos meaning \\"crest\\" and -oideƒìs \\"resembling\\". The specific epithet panini is a Latinized form of \\"Panay\\". The common English name refers to the Visayan Islands. These are located in the central part of the Philippines and include the island of Panay. Two subspecies are recognized: * P. p. panini ‚Äì (Boddaert, 1783): Visayan tarictic hornbill, nominate, found on Panay, Negros, Masbate and Guimaras * P. p. ticaensis ‚Äì Hachisuka, 1930: Ticao tarictic hornbill, found on Ticao Island (likely extinct)  Description  Detail of male's head The adults show sexual dimorphism. The male has a creamy-white head and neck, a white upper chest, a reddish-brown lower chest and uppertail-coverts, and a creamy-white buff tail with a broad black tip. The bill and casque are blackish; the former with yellowish ridges. The bare ocular skin is pinkish-white. The tail and bill of the female resemble that of the male, but otherwise the plumage of the female is black, and the ocular skin is blue. Diet and behavior Visayan hornbills live in groups and frequent the canopy of rainforests. These birds are noisy and emit an incessant sound that sounds like ta-rik-tik, hence the name. Despite their noise they are difficult to find, being well camouflaged by the dense foliage. The principal food of Visayan hornbill is fruit. It also eats insects, beetles, ants and earthworms (rarely). Conservation Tarictic hornbill chick surrendered to researchers in Panay, Philippines. This is a highly endangered species. The total population is estimated at 1800 individuals. There has been a heavy decline in population due to hunting and loss of habitat caused by deforestation. The subspecies ticaensis was described as \\"abundant\\" in 1905, but almost the entire forest on the island was replaced by plantations and settlements in the 20th century. The last time the Ticao tarictic was seen was in 1971, and it is now likely to be extinct. If confirmed, this is the first taxon of hornbill to go extinct in recorded history; many other taxa in the family are now at risk. Captivity This species has just been imported from Panay in the Philippines by Chester Zoo, England. There are two pairs at Chester, and two pairs at Avifauna in the Netherlands, amongst other collections. In the past, the Los Angeles Zoo has bred this species, but it is not known whether these birds were pure Penelopides panini panini, so it may not be the first captive breeding of this species; that title may go to a breeding centre on Panay, where Chester's birds came from. The Chester zoo has bred this species.

Froese (November 28, 1917 ‚Äì June 14, 2003) was a politician in the Canadian province of Manitoba. He was the province's only Social Credit MLA between 1959 and 1973, and was the party's leader for most if not all of the period from 1959 to 1977. The son of Jacob J. Froese and Margaret Enns, Froese was born in Winkler, Manitoba to Jacob J. and Margaret (Enns) Froese. His Father was an Old Colony Mennonite Church bishop from 1936 to 1968. He was educated in the local school system and worked as a farmer, also becoming a leading figure in the Winkler Credit Union Society. He married Mary Peters in 1941, and together they had 10 children. Early in his life, he was a Young Liberal. Froese was elected to the Manitoba legislature for the riding of Rhineland in a November 1959 by-election, defeating a Progressive Conservative candidate by 91 votes. He was re-elected by 33 votes in the 1962 general election, and by greater margins in elections of 1966 and 1969. The Social Credit Party of Manitoba was largely moribund in this period, and it never came close to electing a second MLA during Froese's time in the legislature. A popular local figure, Froese was for all intents and purposes an independent parliamentarian. Manitoba politics became increasingly polarized between the New Democratic Party and Progressive Conservative Party during the 1970s. Froese was defeated by Progressive Conservative candidate Arnold Brown in the 1973 election, and finished a poor fourth in a bid for re-election four years later. He ran as a federal Social Credit candidate in Lisgar in the 1974 Canadian election, but finished fourth in this race as well. In the 1981 provincial election, Froese ran for provincial parliament as a member of the Progressive Party of Manitoba, founded by former NDP cabinet minister Sidney Green. He received only 349 votes, and did not attempt any further political comebacks. Froese died at home in Winkler in 2003. His funeral was held at the Winkler Mennonite Brethren Church, of which he had long been a member.

By mapping application calls to the persistence layer, the DAO provides some specific data operations without exposing details of the database. This isolation supports the single responsibility principle. It separates what data access the application needs, in terms of domain-specific objects and data types (the public interface of the DAO), from how these needs can be satisfied with a specific DBMS, database schema, etc. (the implementation of the DAO). Although this design pattern is equally applicable to most programming languages, most types of software with persistence needs, and most types of databases, it is traditionally associated with Java EE applications and with relational databases (accessed via the JDBC API because of its origin in Sun Microsystems' best practice guidelines \\"Core J2EE Patterns\\" for that platform).  Advantages  The primary advantage of using data access objects is the relatively simple and rigorous separation between two important parts of an application that can but should not know anything of each other, and which can be expected to evolve frequently and independently. Changing business logic can rely on the same DAO interface, while changes to persistence logic do not affect DAO clients as long as the interface remains correctly implemented. All details of storage are hidden from the rest of the application (see information hiding). Thus, possible changes to the persistence mechanism can be implemented by just modifying one DAO implementation while the rest of the application isn't affected. DAOs act as an intermediary between the application and the database. They move data back and forth between objects and database records. Unit testing the code is facilitated by substituting the DAO with a test double in the test, thereby making the tests independent of the persistence layer. In the general context of the Java programming language, Data Access Objects as a design concept can be implemented in a number of ways. This can range from a fairly simple interface that separates the data access parts from the application logic, to frameworks and commercial products. DAO coding paradigms can require some skill. Technologies like Java Persistence API and Enterprise JavaBeans come built into application servers and can be used in applications that use a JavaEE application server. Commercial products like TopLink are available based on object-relational mapping (ORM). Popular open source ORM software include Doctrine, Hibernate, iBATIS and JPA implementations such as Apache OpenJPA.  Disadvantages  Potential disadvantages of using DAO include leaky abstraction, code duplication, and abstraction inversion. In particular, the abstraction of the DAO as a regular Java object can hide the high cost of each database access, and can also force developers to trigger multiple database queries to retrieve information that could otherwise be returned in a single operation using SQL set operations. If an application requires multiple DAOs, one might find oneself repeating essentially the same create, read, update, and delete code for each DAO. This boiler-plate code may be avoided however, by implementing a generic DAO that handles these common operations.See http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-genericdao/index.html for workarounds  Hypothetical use scenario  Imagine a situation where you own a successful company that has received contracts to develop an application for two different clients. The specifications for the application are nearly identical for the two clients. Both clients manage data using SQL databases, but one company uses a proprietary database and the other uses an open source alternative, which implies that your application's persistence layer will need to be implemented in two different ways. Further, as new clients arise, additional implementations may be needed. In this case, using the Data Access Object pattern would ensure the right amount of abstraction and encapsulation required to access any of the varying backend databases.

The skeletal portion of the material is often called the \\"matrix\\" or \\"frame\\". The pores are typically filled with a fluid (liquid or gas). The skeletal material is usually a solid, but structures like foams are often also usefully analyzed using concept of porous media. A porous medium is most often characterised by its porosity. Other properties of the medium (e.g. permeability, tensile strength, electrical conductivity, tortuosity) can sometimes be derived from the respective properties of its constituents (solid matrix and fluid) and the media porosity and pores structure, but such a derivation is usually complex. Even the concept of porosity is only straightforward for a poroelastic medium. Often both the solid matrix and the pore network (also known as the pore space) are continuous, so as to form two interpenetrating continua such as in a sponge. However, there is also a concept of closed porosity and effective porosity, i.e. the pore space accessible to flow. Many natural substances such as rocks and soil (e.g. aquifers, petroleum reservoirs), zeolites, biological tissues (e.g. bones, wood, cork), and man made materials such as cements and ceramics can be considered as porous media. Many of their important properties can only be rationalized by considering them to be porous media. The concept of porous media is used in many areas of applied science and engineering: filtration, mechanics (acoustics, geomechanics, soil mechanics, rock mechanics), engineering (petroleum engineering, bioremediation, construction engineering), geosciences (hydrogeology, petroleum geology, geophysics), biology and biophysics, material science. Fluid flow through porous media Fluid flow through porous media is a subject of common interest and has emerged a separate field of study. The study of more general behaviour of porous media involving deformation of the solid frame is called poromechanics. The theory of porous flows has applications in inkjet printingStephen D.

They can be broadly divided into three categories: * networks of capillaries * arrays of solid particles (e.g., random close pack of spheres) * trimodal Porous materials often have a fractal-like structure, having a pore surface area that seems to grow indefinitely when viewed with progressively increasing resolution.

Laws for porous materials  One of the Laws for porous materials is the generalized Murray's law. The generalized Murray‚Äôs law is based on optimizing mass transfer by minimizing transport resistance in pores with a given volume, and can be applicable for optimizing mass transfer involving mass variations and chemical reactions involving flow processes, molecule or ion diffusion.

He played the lead role in the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical The Phantom of the Opera in London (1991, 1992), Toronto (1992, 1994‚Äì1995, 1998), The Canadian \\"Far East\\" Tour ‚Äì Vancouver, Singapore, and Hong Kong (1995,1997), and in the UK Tour in Bradford, and Manchester (2000). In 1994 and 1995 members of the Phantom of the Opera Appreciation Society voted him their favourite Phantom. Karrie was brought up in Wales, where he had radio and television shows on BBC Wales. He began his career as the lead singer of pop group Peter and the Wolves, and went on to star in several West End musical productions, including Les Mis√©rables and Chess. He also played Daddy Warbucks in Annie, Fagin in Oliver! and Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof for Aberystwyth Arts Centre. In 2005 he starred with Shan C√¥thi in the Mal Pope musical Amazing Grace at the Wales Millennium Centre for the Wales Theatre Company. He performed alongside John Owen Jones and Nic Greenshields in the one-off Three Phantoms concert in aid of George Thomas Hospice Care. He also created roles in three Bernard J. Taylor musicals, and the title role of Nosferatu was written for him. In 2012 he appeared in the 33rd edition of The Royal Nova Scotia International Tattoo in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, where he and Brenna Conrad performed a Cole Porter tribute and a rendition of Phantom of the Opera. Married with six children, Karrie is an ambassador for Bobath Children's Therapy Centre Wales, a registered charity based in Cardiff which provides specialist Bobath therapy to children from Wales who have cerebral palsy. In 2013 he resigned his honorary fellowship at Aberystwyth University in protest, he said, at its apparent determination to \\"ruin one of the finest arts centres in the country\\", and because he was \\"unable to support any regime that can treat their staff in such a cruel and appalling manner.\\" In conjunction with The Blaenavon Workmen's Hall, one of the finest remaining mining institute's in South East Wales, Peter has written and will produce and perform in a new Pantomime within the hall's 350-seat Theatre in December 2017.

It is a follow-up to Pulstar (1995) and features side-scrolling action similar to its predecessor and different ships with varying characteristics. It was made less challenging than its predecessor, and the graphic quality was improved upon. The game was released to mixed reviews. It was commended for its graphics and boss design, and for keeping the Neo Geo shooter scene alive. It has received greater recognition in retrospective reviews when re-released on smartphones and home consoles through the ACA Neo Geo series. Critics continued to praise the boss battles and graphics, but criticized the uneven stage design. Gameplay The player uses a charge shot against a boss Blazing Star is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up similar to its predecessor Pulstar (1995) and the classic shooter R-Type (1987). The story revolves around cyborgs that, remembering their humanity, team up to destroy artificial intelligence systems developing the cybernetic armies they were once a part of. The player can choose from playing as one of these cyborgs, each piloting a ship equipped with different shot types, power, and speed. Tapping the fire button will unleash a standard shot, or it can be tapped rapidly for a different shot type, or held down for a charge attack. Upon releasing the fire button during a charge, it will unleash a powerful focused shot which can also be dispersed to cover a large area with smaller bullets. The effect and range of these attacks varies depending on the player's ship. Power-ups are littered across each stage that boost the power of the ship's weaponry. There are also other items that will increase the player's score and count towards their ranking at the end of each stage. Some of these are only revealed if the player eliminates specific waves of enemies. Some of the later stages introduce more stage hazards like narrow passages. Each stage ends with a boss fight which the player must be completed in the allotted time to get bonus points added to their score. If not completed under the time limit, the player is forced to continue to the next stage without collecting additional points.  Development  Blazing Star was the first game developed by Yumekobo, a company formerly known as Aicom but rebranded to mark their new direction of working closely with SNK. Initial discussions began with the concept for a follow-up to their shooter Pulstar, however they wanted their new game to maintain a degree of independence from the original. Scan collection, Translation With significant changes made to the gameplay style and setting, the team treated their new game as a gaiden and did not want to use Pulstar in the title. Yumekobo's president at the time opposed this, wanting Pulstar in the title for business reasons. At some point the game was titled Pulstar Blast. The publisher SNK entered the dispute, saying they did not want Yumekobo's new shooter to be associated to Pulstar in the west because it received poor reception there due to its high difficulty. The team settled on the title Blazing Star for its western release, chosen among others including Zero Hour and The Zenith. Not wanting to keep the names different between regions, Yumekobo's president decided to make Blazing Star the title in all regions. The team had trouble designing the attack patterns and enemy placements to establish the right level of difficulty. Interesting combat patterns made the game more difficult, but the game was boring otherwise. The director of Pulstar thought the original game was too difficult and wanted the new shooter to have a charge shot for an easier challenge. Although much of the game changed through development, the charge shot was one of the early concepts that was kept along with the goal to create impressive scenery. Yumekobo staff believed the game's best selling point was its detailed graphics. The artists had to overcome challenges creating the textures, animation, and reducing the sprites to 16 colors each due to Neo Geo hardware limitations. The system's sprite limit restricted the number of bullets they could place on-screen. There was still some sprite flickering in the final game due to crossing this threshold. The character Leefa has a kogal personality and was modeled after Yuko Asahina from Tokimeki Memorial at the request of the game designers. JB was modeled after the actor Jean Reno, and Asayuki was based on a character for a previous game the character designer worked on that was never released. Unique endings were planned for each character but were later cut, the details of which were divulged in an issue of Neo Geo Freak.  Release  Blazing Star was released on the Neo Geo arcade system (MVS) in 1998, and the home system (AES) on February 26, 1998. A Neo Geo CD release was planned but abandoned. The game was re-released on iOS and Android in July 2012, and on the Wii via the Virtual Console in Japan on August 21 later that year. The smartphone versions include multiplayer support via Bluetooth and a practice mode that lets the player start from any stage they have cleared. Hamster Corporation rereleased the game for the Nintendo Switch via the eShop on May 2, 2017 as part of their ACA Neo Geo series. As with all games released under the ACA Neo Geo brand, the game includes Hamster's additional scoring modes, screen filter options, and difficulty settings. This version later came to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One digital storefronts on February 8, 2018. Blazing Star is also included in SNK's Neo Geo Mini dedicated console. A port developed by DotEmu for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux and asm.js was released by SNK Playmore as part of the Humble NEOGEO 25th Anniversary Bundle on December 15, 2015. It was also released on GOG.com on May 30, 2017.  Reception  Critics commended Blazing Star as a testament to SNK's devotion to the Neo Geo hardware and keeping classic genres such as shoot 'em ups alive. Edge wrote that side-scrolling shooters were rare to find, but the game should satisfy fans of the genre. They praised the colorful backgrounds and 3D special effects. Video Games agreed that the graphics were nice, but felt some of the backgrounds were pale and it ultimately did not offer \\"The Ultimate in Neo Geo graphics\\" as was advertised on the game's packaging. Next Level argued that the game took better advantage of the Neo Geo hardware than Pulstar with its improved background and lighting effects. Journalists found the game similar to its predecessor, but Video Games in particular thought Pulstar was the better game. They gave Blazing Star a score of 72% and felt it was too short, not challenging enough, and lacking in sophisticated level design. They did however like the bosses, as did Next Level and Edge who both appreciated the game for carrying on the large boss trend from Pulstar. Edge ultimately felt that the \\"frenetic, old- school gameplay...will keep the Neo Geo's devotees happy.\\" The iOS and Android ports of Blazing Star were well-received. TouchArcade commended the strategic gameplay, impressive 2D backgrounds, and felt it featured \\"some of the most intricate shooter gameplay you can find in the vast pool of shmups available on the App Store.\\" Their biggest criticisms were the touch screen controls which they felt were sluggish. Pocket Gamer agreed about the controls, writing that their finger would get in the way of action occasionally. They still thought the game was addictive and \\"the equivalent of the machine in the corner that the hardened veterans congregate around, dropping in coin after coin as they inch their way up the leaderboards.\\" Reviewing the Arcade Archives release, Nintendo Life called it a \\"perfect port\\", noting that it even retained the frame rate slowdown when the screen is filled with sprites. Their biggest complaints were the game's aged pre-rendered graphics and the sharp difficulty increase in the latter stages, but they felt these were minor issues. They felt Hamster Corporation's Hi-Score and Caravan modes were perfect complements to Blazing Star. Nintendo World Report felt that it had an uneven level design, wishing the earlier levels had more stage hazards. They did however appreciate the game for maintaining a degree of simplicity without sacrificing gameplay depth, and called it \\"one of the more accessible and fun shoot-em-ups out there\\". Legacy Retro Gamer and Harcore Gaming 101 wrote that the game is sometimes remembered for its poorly-translated English text. Some articles, including one by linguist Ben Zimmer, have cited the game's game over message, ‚ÄúYou fail it\\", as inspiring the popular interjection \\"Fail\\".

Duke Professor of English at Duke University. Apart from English literature, Price had a lifelong interest in Biblical scholarship. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.\\"Reynolds Price author and long-time Duke English professor, dies.\\" Duke Office of News and Communications. 20 Jan 2011. Web. Biography Price was born Edward Reynolds Price in Macon, North Carolina on February 1, 1933, the first of two sons of William Solomon and Elizabeth Price. Both he and his mother narrowly survived an extremely taxing childbirth; family legend states that during these circumstances, Will Price prayed and made a promise to God that if his wife and son survived, he would quit drinking alcohol.Schiff, James. Understanding Reynolds Price. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1996. Print. Price's family, struggling under the economic climate of the Great Depression, resided in the rural North Carolina towns of Macon, Henderson, Warrenton, Roxboro, and Asheboro throughout his childhood. Rather than joining other boys his age in sports and outdoor activities, Price developed a childhood fondness for the arts ‚Äì reading, writing, painting, and opera included. He attended Broughton High School in Raleigh, North Carolina and eventually received a full scholarship to Duke University, where he continued writing, served as the editor of Duke's literary magazine, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa his junior year and graduated summa cum laude. After graduating in 1955, Price received a Rhodes Scholarship and attended Merton College, Oxford. While at Oxford, Price formed important friendships with the poet W. H. Auden, as well as the biographer Lord David Cecil. He devoted a significant portion of his literary studies, as well as his thesis, to English poet John Milton. Upon graduation with a B.Litt. in 1958, Price secured a position in the Duke University English department, where he stayed for the rest of his career, often teaching courses on Milton, creative writing, and the Gospels. In the spring of 1984, a life-altering medical event occurred when Price reported difficulty walking and underwent testing at Duke University Hospital. James Schiff describes, \\"He soon learned of a 'pencil- thick and gray-colored' tumor, ten inches long and cancerous, which was 'intricately braided in the core of [his] spinal cord'.\\" Although surgery and radiation managed to remove the tumor from his spine, Price became a paraplegic and required a wheelchair for the rest of his life. After enduring these initial years, Price emerged from this trying period \\"a more patient and watchful person and a dramatically more prolific writer.\\" He still bore, however, \\"colossal, incessant pain,\\" as he described.Strandberg, Victor. \\"The Religious/Erotic Poetry of Reynolds Price.\\" Studies in the Literary Imagination, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Spring 2002): 61-86. Web. He wrote about his experience as a cancer survivor in his memoir A Whole New Life. Regarding his life after this tragedy, Price explains, \\"I'd have to say that, despite an enjoyable fifty-year start, these recent years since full catastrophe have gone still better. They've brought more in and sent more out - more love and care, more knowledge and patience, more work in less time.\\" In 1987, Duke University gave Price its highest honor when it awarded him the University Medal for Distinguished Meritorious Service. Price died at the age of 77 on January 20, 2011, as a result of complications from a heart attack.Grimes, William. \\"Reynolds Price, a Literary Voice of the South, Dies at 77.\\" The New York Times 20 Jan 2011. 14 April 2013.

Price's first ever published story, called \\"A Chain of Love\\", came in 1958. He wrote his first novel, A Long and Happy Life, and witnessed its publication in 1962. The work received the William Faulkner Foundation Award (1963) and has sold over a million copies. His 1986 novel Kate Vaiden also gained immense popularity and received the National Books Critics Circle Award. Price composed a memoir entitled Clear Pictures in 1989 which directly led to the production of a Charles Guggenheim documentary about the author's lifetime. He completed another memoir called A Whole New Life in 1994 which chronicled his journey after the discovery of cancer in his spine. The Collected Poems, containing four volumes of poetry - Vital Provisions (1982), The Laws of Ice (1986), The Use of Fire (1990), and The Unaccountable Worth of the World (1997) - was published in 1997.Price, Reynolds.

Victor Strandberg explains, \\"Price's name was next to a Renaissance portrait of Jesus alongside a headline that reads, 'Novelist Reynolds Price offers a new Gospel based on archeology and the Bible.' Inside the magazine, this cover story begins with Time's statement that 'A great novelist and biblical scholar examines what faith and historical research tell us after 2,000 years and emerges with his own apocryphal Gospel'.\\" Personal life Price lived alone, by choice, for all of his adult life and was openly homosexual.Garner, Dwight. \\"An American Writer, Coming of Age in Oxford.\\" The New York Times 12 May 2009. 14 April 2013.

Price gives an account of this occurrence in A Whole New Life: > It was the big lake of Kinnereth, the Sea of Galilee, in the north of Israel > ... the scene of Jesus' first teaching and healing. I'd paid the lake a > second visit the previous October. ... Still sleeping around me on the misty > ground were a number of men in the tunics and cloaks of first-century > Palestine. I soon understood with no sense of surprise that the men were > Jesus' twelve disciples and that he was nearby asleep among them. ... Then > one of the sleeping men woke and stood. I saw it was Jesus, bound toward me. > ... Again I felt no shock or fear. All this was normal human event; it was > utterly clear to my normal eyes and was happening as surely as any event of > my previous life. ... Jesus bent and silently beckoned me to follow. ... > Jesus silently took up handfuls of water and poured them over my head and > back til water ran down my puckered scar. Then he spoke once‚Äî\\"Your sins are > forgiven\\"‚Äîand turned to shore again, done with me. I came on behind him, > thinking in standard greedy fashion, It's not my sins I'm worried about. So > to Jesus' receding back, I had the gall to say \\"Am I also cured?\\" He turned > to face me, no sign of a smile, and finally said two words‚Äî\\"That too.\\"Price, > Reynolds. A Whole New Life. New York: Scribner, 1995. Print. Reception Despite the success of his best-selling novels and nationwide recognition on the cover of Time, Price has received a lesser degree of recognition than many of his contemporaries in American literature. James Schiff explains, \\"Despite the praise from reviewers, Price has not received a great deal of scholarly attention - certainly less than other members of his literary generation, such as John Updike, Philip Roth, Thomas Pynchon, Joyce Carol Oates, Toni Morrison, John Barth, Sylvia Plath, Susan Sontag, Don DeLillo, and Cynthia Ozick.\\" But although he is less well-known than such writers, Price is widely celebrated by the literary community and the majority of his readers.

It has about 33 million customers across 16 countries. In the United Kingdom, Aviva is the largest general insurer and a leading life and pensions provider. Aviva also has a focus on the markets in Europe and in Asia and, in particular, on the growth markets of China and South East Asia. Aviva is also the second largest general insurer in Canada. Aviva has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange, and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. Name The name of the company upon its formation in May 2000 was CGNU plc and was created when Norwich Union merged with insurer CGU. In April 2002, the company's shareholders voted to change the company name to \\"Aviva plc\\", an invented palindrome word derived from \\"viva\\", the Latin for 'alive' and designed to be short, memorable and work worldwide. The Norwich Union brand, however, was retained for the UK long-term savings and general insurance business. In April 2008, Aviva announced that it would adopt the \\"Aviva\\" name as its worldwide consumer facing brand, and that the Norwich Union brand would be phased out in the United Kingdom. History Aviva can trace its history back to the establishment of the Hand in Hand Fire & Life Insurance Society in London in 1696.Note: taken over by Commercial Union in 1905 Predecessor company London and Lancashire Fire and Life, pictured in Dublin, c. 1871 It was created by a merger of two British insurance firms, Norwich Union and CGU plc (itself created by the merger of 1998 of Commercial Union and General Accident) as CGNU in February 2000. The Aviva name was adopted in July 2002. Thereafter, most of the group operations, except for some strong local brands, were carried out under the uniform brand \\"Aviva\\". During March 2005, Aviva acquired the RAC plc breakdown recovery operation for around ¬£1.1 billion. In July 2006, Aviva greatly increased its presence in the United States by acquiring AmerUs Group, a Des Moines based financial services company founded in 1896 in a $2.9 billion (¬£1.6 billion) deal. The launch was supported by a ¬£9 million advertising campaign to promote the rebranding (one of the most expensive ever in the insurance field), with the participation of celebrities including Bruce Willis and Alice Cooper. In June 2009, the company decided to dispose of Navigator, its Australian wealth management business, to National Australia Bank for A$825 million (¬£401 million).NAB buys Aviva to become biggest life insurer Sydney Morning Herald, 22 June 2009 In October 2009, the company decided to focus on its commercial insurance sector and demonstrate its commitment to brokers by launching their 'find a broker' facility, using the British Insurance Brokers Association search engine. To help them with this endeavour, Paul Whitehouse was recruited to play the part of a successful hairdresser running three salons. The message of the campaign focused on business insurance through insurance brokers. In September 2011, Aviva completed the sale of RAC plc breakdown recovery operation for ¬£1.0 billion to The Carlyle Group. In February 2012, Aviva sold its occupational health business to the British support services company Capita. In July 2012, Aviva announced plans to sell or close 16 non core businesses in order to simplify its activities and boost shareholder returns. As part of the plans Aviva announced the sale of its operations in South Korea and the closure to new business of its bulk buying annuity unit in the United Kingdom. In August 2012, Aviva announced that up to 800 jobs would be lost, following a reorganization caused by further turmoil in the Eurozone. In December 2012, Aviva agreed to sell Aviva USA Corporation to Athene Holding for US$1.8 billion (¬£1.1 billion) as part of a plan to improve shareholder returns and reduce the group's capital requirements, having paid $2.9 billion in 2006 and incuring a large loss. Athene subsequently sold the life insurance business of Aviva to Global Atlantic. On 13 April 2015, Aviva completed the ¬£5.6 billion all share takeover of Friends Life Group. Andy Briggs, current group chief executive of Friends Life, became CEO of Aviva UK Life, with Mark Wilson continuing as CEO of the enlarged Aviva Group. In July 2016, Aviva froze withdrawals from the Aviva Investors Property Trust because of a lack of liquidity after Britain's vote to leave the European Union on the 23rd of June. In September 2017, Aviva agreed to sell its Italian joint venture Avipop Assicurazioni to Banco BPM for US$312.01 million (‚Ç¨265 million). In March 2018, Aviva, controversially, announced that it \\"had the ability\\" to cancel its irredeemable preference shares at par. This caused a wider sell off in the preference share market in the United Kingdom. Also in March 2018 the company announced to spend around ¬£600 million on so called \\"bolt on\\" acquisitions, that are in \\"Poland, Turkey, anywhere we have existing markets\\". In October 2018, Mark Wilson agreed to step down as CEO with immediate effect, with Adrian Montague taking interim control of the company, pending Wilson's formal departure in 2019.

Moss was paid an annual base salary of ¬£925,000 for his role as Chief Executive. Moss resigned on 8 May 2012, after shareholders voted down a proposed senior management pay deal which would have seen Moss increase his basic pay by 5% despite several years of Aviva underperformance. Following the departure of Aviva's CEO, Andrew Moss, McFarlane assumed the role of executive deputy chairman and became executive chairman on 1 July 2012. On 20 November 2012, Aviva announced that Mark Wilson had been appointed CEO, starting 1 January 2013.

The name is usually pluralised into \\"the Eildons\\" or \\"Eildon Hills\\", because of its triple peak. The high eminence overlooks Teviotdale to the South.R. Milne & H. Brown, The Corbetts and Other Scottish Hills, p. 29. Published by the Scottish Mountaineering Trust, 2002. The north hilltop (of three peaks) is surrounded by over of ramparts, enclosing an area of about 16 ha (40 acres) in which at least 300 level platforms have been cut into the rock to provide bases for turf or timber-walled houses, forming one of the largest hill forts known in Scotland. A Roman army signalling station was later constructed on the same site as this hill fort. The mid hilltop is the highest, whilst the south hilltop is the lowest. The hills are owned by the Duke of Buccleuch, Scotland's largest private landowner. As with all land in Scotland the public have a right of responsible access to the hills, and there are many paths crossing the area and leading to all three summits. The hills form part of the Eildon and Leaderfoot National Scenic Area, one of forty such areas in Scotland, which have been defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development. The areas protected by the national scenic area (NSA) designation are considered to represent the type of scenic beauty \\"popularly associated with Scotland and for which it is renowned\\". The Eildon and Leaderfoot NSA covers 3877 ha, and extends to include the town of Melrose, Scott's View and Leaderfoot Viaduct. History Excavations have found evidence that the hill fort was occupied by 1000 BC, in the Bronze Age. The ramparts seem to have been built and rebuilt in three phases. 296 individual huts floors have been identified within the fort, suggesting a population of around 2000, and making it one of the largest known in Scotland from this period. The hill fort is thought to have been the capital of the Selgovae, who lived in upper Tweeddale prior to the arrival of the Romans. In the 1st century CE the Roman army built the massive fort of Trimontium at Newstead, named after the three peaks, at the foot of the hill on the bank of the River Tweed. In association with this fort they constructed a signal tower with a tiled roof in a 15 m diameter enclosure built on the summit of Eildon North Hill. The hill fort may have been abandoned by this time, as Roman archaeological finds uncovered during excavation of the site in 1986 all overlaid native finds. The tower was thought to have been constructed out of timber during the Flavian period, with a later tower being constructed out of stone during the reign of Emperor Antoninus Pius. Finds including Roman coins and pottery have suggested that some of the house platforms were again in use in the 2nd to 4th century. There is some evidence that prehistoric peoples regarded the Eildon Hills as a holy place and scholars believe they may have been a place of ceremonial gatherings. There are several holy springs around the base of the hills, now dedicated to Christian saints, but probably originally sacred to Celtic deities.http://www.scotborders.gov.uk/pdf/22592.pdf They were once known as Eldune, derived from the 12th-century Simeon of Durham who referred to them as . The final part of the word is Old English dun, meaning a rounded hill, while the first part has been variously etymologized as Brittonic eil (referring to a fenced enclosure) or Old English «£led (\\"fire\\") or «£l«£te (\\"empty place\\"). Formation It is possible that the hills were formed deep beneath the Earth's surface as ancient laccoliths. In folklore Eildon is said to be a \\"hollow hill\\", and is mentioned in the legend of Thomas the Rhymer. Some believe Thomas went under the hill itself, and certainly part of the ballad occurs in the vicinity. Sir Walter Scott tells the tale of a horse dealer who is paid in \\"ancient coin\\" by an elderly buyer in old-fashioned dress and taken inside the hill at night. A host of armed knights lie asleep at their horses' feet; their sleeping leader is King Arthur. Shown a horn and a sword, in confusion the dealer blows the horn: the men begin to awake and a loud voice indicates that he has been proved a coward for not seizing the sword first. A whirlwind ejects him from the chamber and outside he tells his story to some shepherds before dropping dead of exhaustion. Scott identifies the elderly man as Thomas the Rhymer.http://www.magicdragon.com/Wallace/lore.htmlhttp://www.britannia.com/history/arthur/eildon.html Another legend concerns the Eildon Tree Stone, a large moss-covered boulder near Melrose, marking the spot where the Fairy Queen led Thomas into her realms in the heart of the hills. The volcanic rock was said to have been cleft in three by the wizard Michael Scot, as relayed by Walter Scott in his 1805 poem The Lay of the Last Minstrel: > In these far climes it was my lot > To meet the wondrous Michael Scott, > A wizard, of such dreaded fame, > Than when, in Salmanca's cave, > Him listed his magic wand to wave, > The bells would ring in Notre Dame! > Some of his skill he taught to me; > And Warrior, I could say to thee > The words that cleft Eildon hills in three, > And bridled the Tweed with a curb of stone: > But to speak them were a deadly sin. James Hogg retold the legend in his 1823 novel The Three Perils of Man. Media This place was cited in the lyric 'Eiledon', from Big Country's 'The Seer' album.

In July 2012, Great Ormond Street Hospital was featured in the opening ceremony of the London Summer Olympics. In 2017 Great Ormond Street Hospital was subject to international attention regarding the Charlie Gard treatment controversy. Archives The hospital's archives are available for research under the terms of the Public Records Act 1958 and a catalogue is available on request. Admission records from 1852 to 1914 have been made available online on the Historic Hospital Admission Records Project. St. Christopher's Chapel St Christopher's Chapel in Great Ormond Street Hospital. St. Christopher's Chapel is a chapel decorated in the Byzantine style and Grade II* listed building located in the Variety Club Building of the hospital. Designed by Edward Middleton Barry (son of the architect Sir Charles Barry who designed the Houses of Parliament) and built in 1875, it is dedicated to the memory of Caroline Barry, wife of William Henry Barry (eldest son of Sir Charles Barry) who provided the ¬£40,000 required to build the Chapel and a stipend for the chaplain. It was built in \\"elaborate Franco-Italianate style\\". As the chapel exists to provide pastoral care to ill children and their families, many of its details refer to childhood. The stained glass depicts the Nativity, the childhood of Christ and biblical scenes related to children. The dome depicts a pelican pecking at her breast in order to feed her young with drops of her own blood, a traditional symbol of Christ's sacrifice for humanity. When the old hospital was being demolished in the late 1980s, the chapel was moved to its present location via a 'concrete raft' to prevent any damage en route. The stained glass and furniture were temporarily removed for restoration and repair. It was reopened along with the new Variety Club Building on 14 February 1994 by Diana, Princess of Wales, then president of the hospital. Peter Pan Peter Pan statue at Great Ormond Street Hospital by Diarmuid Byron O'Connor In April 1929 J.M. Barrie gave the copyright to his Peter Pan works to the hospital, with the request that the income from this source not be disclosed. This gave the institution control of the rights to these works, and entitled it to royalties from any performance or publication of the play and derivative works. Innumerable performances of the play and its various adaptations have been staged, several theatrical and television adaptations have been produced, and numerous editions of the novel have been published, all under licence from the hospital.Tatar, Maria (ed). The Annotated Peter Pan. W.W. Norton (2011)Bruce K. Hanson. Peter Pan on Stage and Screen 1904‚Äì2010. McFarland (2011) The hospital's trustees further commissioned a sequel novel, Peter Pan in Scarlet, written by Geraldine McCaughrean and published in 2006. After the copyright first expired in the UK at the end of 1987 ‚Äì 50 years after Barrie's death ‚Äì the UK government's Copyright, Designs and Patents Act of 1988 granted the hospital a perpetual right to collect royalties for public performances and commercial publication of the work within the UK. This did not grant GOSH full copyright control over the work, however. When UK copyright terms were later extended to the author's life plus 70 years by a European Union directive in 1996, GOSH revived its full copyright claim on the work. After the copyright expired again in 2007, the terms of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act again applied. At various times, GOSH has been in legal disputes in the United States, where the copyright term is based on date of publication, putting the 1911 novel in the public domain since the 1960s. The hospital asserts that the 1928 version of the play is still under copyright in the US. Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity The hospital has relied on charitable support since it first opened. One of the main sources for this support is Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity. Whilst the NHS meets the day-to-day running costs of the hospital, the fundraising income allows Great Ormond Street Hospital to remain at the forefront of child healthcare. The charity aims to raise over ¬£50 million every year to complete the next two phases of redevelopment, as well as provide substantially more fundraising directly for research. The charity also purchases up-to-date equipment, and provides accommodation for families and staff. Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity was one of the charities that benefited from the national Jeans for Genes campaign, which encourages people across the UK to wear their jeans and make a donation to help children affected by genetic disorders. All Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity's proceeds from the campaign went to its research partner, the UCL Institute of Child Health. On 6 August 2009, Arsenal F.C. confirmed that Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity was to be their 'charity of the season' for the 2009‚Äì10 season. They raised over ¬£800,000 for a new lung function unit at the hospital. Two charity singles have been released in aid of the hospital. In 1987, \\"The Wishing Well\\", recorded by an ensemble line-up including Boy George, Peter Cox and Dollar amongst others became a top 30 hit. In 2009, The X Factor finalists covered Michael Jackson's \\"You Are Not Alone\\" in aid of the charity, reaching No.1 in the UK Charts. On 30 March 2010, Channel 4 staged the first Channel 4's Comedy Gala at the O2 Arena in London, in aid of the charity. The event has been repeated every year since, raising money for Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity each time. In 2011, Daniel Boys recorded a charity single called 'The World Is Something You Can Imagine'. It was also released as with proceeds going to the Disney Appeal at Great Ormond Street Hospital.

Though it was part of the original 1926 numbering plan, it was deleted within 10 years. Route description From its southern terminus in Davenport, Iowa,http://www.iowadot.gov/maps/msp/historical/pdf/1934-august-front.pdf U.S. Highway 55 initially followed the route of present-day U.S. Highway 52 through Hampton, Minnesota excepting for later local improvements such as the Rochester and Decorah bypasses. It was deleted 80 years ago. North of Hampton, Minnesota, U.S. Highway 55 headed north and west to downtown Minneapolis. Within the village of Hampton, Minnesota, U.S. Highway 55 followed along Main Street and present-day Minnesota Highway 50 to Farmington. Within Farmington, the highway had a shared segment with what was then U.S. Highway 65 (now Minnesota Highway 3) to Elm Street in Hampton. From Farmington, U.S. Highway 55 headed westward to Burnsville via present-day 212th Street West, Lakeville Blvd, 210th Street West, Kenwood Trail, and Burnsville Parkway to Lyndale Ave (now Interstate 35W). Following the decommissioning of U.S. Highway 55, the portion of the route between Farmington and Burnsville was subsequently designated as a portion of Minnesota Highway 50, and transferred to County control in 1994 as Dakota County Road 50. From Burnsville, U.S. Highway 55 again turned northwards, following Lyndale Avenue across the Minnesota River and into Downtown Minneapolis via Lyndale Avenue, Lake Street, and 3rd Avenue. History When the route was designated in 1926, its northern terminus was in Minneapolis at an intersection with U.S. Highway 12, near the Mississippi River. Its southern terminus was in Dubuque, Iowa, at an intersection with U.S. Highway 61 (or possibly U.S. Highway 20). In 1932, US 55 was extended south to Davenport, Iowa, to another intersection with US 61. While US 61 followed a more direct route from Dubuque to Davenport, the new US 55 extension followed the western shore of the Mississippi River. Just two years later, in 1934, US 55 was deleted entirely. U.S. Highway 67 was extended through Davenport to Dubuque, absorbing the 1932 extension of US 55. The northern half of this stretch was co-signed with an extension of U.S. Highway 52, which took over the US 55 designation to Hampton, Minnesota. From Hampton, US 52 was routed to Saint Paul via Minnesota Highway 56 to Inver Grove Heights and Robert Street into downtown Saint Paul. The remainder of U.S. Highway 55 north and west of Hampton was designated as U.S. Highway 65. The prior routing of U.S. Highway 65 into from Farmington to Saint Paul was redesignated as U.S. Highway 218 for one year, and subsequently redesignated as Minnesota Highway 218, and later as Minnesota Highway 3. The number \\"55\\" was later proposed for the route which would become U.S. Highway 56.Oklahoma Department of Transportation, Chronological History Documentation: US 56 (correspondence between ODOT, AASHO, and other DOTs) Major intersections References * Information regarding routes of the U.S. Highways within Minnesota was obtained from vintage maps provided by the Mid-West Map Company (1929) and H.M.

He was the first person convicted of murder based on DNA fingerprinting evidence, and the first to be caught as a result of mass DNA screening. Pitchfork raped and murdered two girls in neighbouring Leicestershire villages, the first in Narborough, in November 1983, and the second in Enderby, in July 1986. He was arrested on 19 September 1987 and sentenced to life imprisonment on 22 January 1988, after admitting both murders. Life Pitchfork lived in Newbold Verdon, attending school in Market Bosworth and Desford, until his marriage in 1981 to a social worker, after which he lived in Littlethorpe. The Pitchforks had two sons. Before his marriage, Pitchfork had been convicted of indecent exposure and had been referred for therapy at Carlton Hayes Hospital, Narborough. Pitchfork had obtained work in Hampshires Bakery in 1976 as an apprentice. He continued to work there until his arrest for the murders. He became particularly skilled as a sculptor of cake decorations and had hoped, eventually, to start his own cake decorating business. According to his supervisor, he was \\"a good worker and time-keeper, but he was moody... and he couldn't leave women employees alone. He was always chatting them up.\\"  Crimes  On 21 November 1983, 15-year-old Lynda Mann took a shortcut on her way home from babysitting instead of taking her normal route home. She did not return and so her parents and neighbours spent the night searching for her. The next morning, she was found raped and strangled on a deserted footpath known locally as the Black Pad. Using forensic science techniques available at the time, police linked a semen sample taken from her body to a person with type A blood and an enzyme profile that matched only 10% of males. With no other leads or evidence, the case was left open. On 31 July 1986, a second 15-year-old girl, Dawn Ashworth, left her home to visit a friend's house. Her parents expected her to come home at 9:30 PM; when she failed to do so they called police to report her missing. Two days later, her body was found in a wooded area near a footpath called Ten Pound Lane. She had been beaten, savagely raped and strangled to death. The modus operandi matched that of the first attack, and semen samples revealed the same blood type. The prime suspect was Richard Buckland, a local 17-year- old youth with learning difficulties, who revealed knowledge of Ashworth's body, and admitted to the Ashworth crime under questioning, but denied the first murder.Graff, Vincent (4 April 2015) \\"DNA of a killer\\", Radio Times, Pages 24-27 =DNA profiling= In 1985, Alec Jeffreys, a genetics researcher at the University of Leicester, first developed DNA profiling along with Peter Gill and Dave Werrett of the Forensic Science Service (FSS). Gill commented: Using this technique, Jeffreys compared semen samples from both murder victims against a blood sample from Buckland and conclusively proved that both girls were killed by the same man but not by Buckland. Buckland became the first person to have his innocence established by DNA fingerprinting. Jeffreys later said: Leicestershire Constabulary and the FSS then undertook an investigation in which more than 5,500 local men were asked to volunteer blood or saliva samples. This took six months, and no matches were found. =Arrest and conviction= On 1 August 1987, one of Pitchfork's colleagues at the bakery, Ian Kelly, revealed to fellow workers in a Leicester pub (The Clarendon) that he had taken the blood test while masquerading as Pitchfork. Pitchfork told Kelly that he could not give blood under his own name because he had already given blood while pretending to be a friend of his who had wanted to avoid being harassed by police because of a youthful conviction for burglary. A woman who overheard the conversation reported it to police. On 19 September 1987, Pitchfork was arrested. During subsequent questioning, Pitchfork admitted to exposing himself to more than 1,000 women, a compulsion that began in his early teens. He later progressed to sexual assault and then to strangling his victims in order to protect his identity. He pleaded guilty to the two rapes/murders in addition to another incident of sexual assault, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The Lord Chief Justice at the time of his sentencing said: \\"From the point of view of the safety of the public I doubt if he should ever be released.\\" The Secretary of State set a minimum term of 30 years; in 2009, Pitchfork's sentence was reduced on appeal to 28 years.Pitchfork, R v [2009] EWCA Crim 963 Artwork In April 2009, a sculpture that Pitchfork had created in prison was exhibited at the Royal Festival Hall, Bringing the Music to Life, depicted an orchestra and choir. The sculpture was exhibited as part of a venture by the Koestler Trust, having been purchased by the Festival Hall for ¬£600. Following outrage in the papers and from victim-advocate groups, it was removed from display. Parole reviews On 22 April 2016, the Parole Board for England and Wales heard Pitchfork's case for early release on parole. Pitchfork's advocates presented evidence of his improved character, noting that Pitchfork had furthered his education to degree level and had become expert at the transcription of printed music into braille, for the benefit of the blind. The families of victims Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth opposed his release on parole. On 29 April 2016, the Parole Board announced that Pitchfork's petition for parole had been denied, but they then issued a recommendation that Pitchfork be moved to an open prison. In June 2016, Michael Gove, then serving as Justice Secretary, agreed with the board's recommendation, and at some point prior to 8 January 2017, Pitchfork was moved to an undisclosed open prison. The Parole Board denied parole again in 2018. He may be eligible for parole again in 2020. On 3 May 2018, Pitchfork was denied parole. The Parole Board said Pitchfork will be eligible for a further review within two years. Lynda's mother said the Parole Board had \\"listened to us before the murderer\\". Last year, it emerged Pitchfork would be released from open prison on unsupervised days out. It had been widely expected that Pitchfork could be approaching final release from prison on parole. In November 2018, Pitchfork was spotted walking around Bristol, so it was assumed that he had been moved to HM Prison Leyhill in Gloucestershire.bristolpost.co.uk Drama In 2014, ITV commissioned a two-part television drama, Code of a Killer, based on Pitchfork's crimes and the creation of DNA profiling. It starred John Simm as researcher Alec Jeffreys and David Threlfall as David Baker, the lead police detective.Lee Marlow, \\"Code of a Killer: ITV film crew shoot in Leicester for two part drama on how DNA profiling snared double-child killer\\" , Leicester Mercury, 30 October 2014 Pitchfork was played by Nathan Wright. The drama was the first broadcast in two 90-minute episodes, on 6 and 13 April 2015. It was subsequently reformatted as three episodes and released on DVD. The New Tricks episode \\"Dark Chocolate\\" refers to Colin Pitchfork several times and it is ultimately the similarities between Pitchfork's case and the case the UCOS team are currently investigating that leads to the criminal's arrest.

Ukrainian immigrants established the first Ukrainian Baptist church in Canada in Winnipeg in 1903. Around the turn of the 20th century, English-speaking Baptists sent a missionary to labour among the growing Ukrainian population in western Canada. From this work, a church was organized in Overstone, Manitoba in 1904. Around this same time, Baptist work among Ukrainian Canadians was started in Toronto, and in Saskatchewan. John Kolesnikoff, a missionary, moved to Canada from eastern Ukraine in 1907. These churches were successful in attracting Mennonite, Shtundist, and Eastern Orthodox emigrants from Imperial Russia. The first annual conference of Ukrainian Baptists in Canada was held in Canora, Saskatchewan in 1908.

It is closely related to the writhed hornbill, but can be recognized by the yellow throat and ocular skin in the male, and the blue throat and ocular skin in the female (both throat and ocular skin are deep orange or red in both sexes of the writhed hornbill). Its binomial name commemorates the Scottish ornithologist Viscount Walden.  Habitat and behaviour  Male carrying a small fruit. As most other hornbills, this species is primarily a frugivore. Rainforests with abundant fruit-bearing trees are the natural habitat of these birds. The Walden's hornbills live in small groups and are noisy. The Walden's hornbills use natural or carved-out hollows in tree trunks for its nest. As other hornbills, they reproduce very slowly. As lack of appropriate nesting sites is a problem, nest boxes are being attached to tree trunks in certain reserves.  Status  This is a critically endangered species. Walden's hornbill reproduce very slowly and thus are unable to survive high hunting pressures coupled with heavy logging of the rainforests. It is presumed extinct on Guimaras and now survives only on Negros and Panay.

Buckhead is the third largest business district within the Atlanta city limits, behind Downtown and Midtown, a major commercial and financial center of the Southeast. Buckhead is an example of an edge city, anchored by a core of high-rise office buildings, hotels, shopping centers, restaurants and condominiums centered around the intersection of Peachtree Road and Piedmont Road near Georgia State Route 400, Buckhead station, and Lenox Square. History In 1838, Henry Irby purchased 202 1/2 acres surrounding the present intersection of Peachtree, Roswell, and West Paces Ferry roads from Daniel Johnson for $650. Irby subsequently established a general store and tavern at the northwest corner of the intersection. The name \\"Buckhead\\" comes from a story that Irby killed a large buck deer and placed the head in a prominent location. Prior to this, the settlement was called Irbyville. By the late 1800s, Buckhead had become a rural vacation spot for wealthy Atlantans. In the 1890s, Buckhead was rechristened Atlanta Heights but by the 1920s it was again \\"Buckhead\\".\\"In the 1980s an effort was made to change the name to Atlanta Heights, to no avail. The people preferred the picturesque name of Buckhead.\\" in The Atlanta Historical Bulletin, Volume 1 (1927), p.26 A cycling event, \\"Georgia Rides to the Capitol,\\" on Piedmont Road Buckhead remained dominated by country estates until after World War I, when many of Atlanta's wealthy began building mansions among the area's rolling hills. Despite the stock market crash of 1929, lavish mansions were still constructed in Buckhead throughout the Great Depression. In 1930, Henry Aaron Alexander built one of the largest homes on Peachtree Road, a house with 33 rooms and 13 bathrooms. The community was annexed by Atlanta in 1952, following an earlier attempt by Mayor William B. Hartsfield in 1946 that was voted down by residents. Buckhead's black neighborhoods, including Johnsontown, Piney Grove, Savagetown and Macedonia Park, were razed beginning in the 1940s.Scott Henry, \\"Buckhead's black past: Historians are finding a rich African-American history in Atlanta's whitest neighborhood\\", Creative Loafing, June 6, 2012 In 1956, an estate known as Joyeuse was chosen as the site for a major shopping center to be known as Lenox Square. The mall was designed by Joe Amisano, an architect who designed many of Atlanta's modernist buildings. When Lenox Square opened in 1959, it was one of the first malls in the country, and the largest shopping center in the Southeastern U.S. Office development soon followed with the construction of Tower Place in 1974. To reverse a downturn in Buckhead Village during the 1980s, minimum parking spot requirements for bars were lifted, which quickly led to it becoming the most dense concentration of bars and clubs in the Atlanta area. Many bars and clubs catered mostly to the black community in the Atlanta area, including Otto's, Cobalt, 112, BAR, World Bar, Lulu's Bait Shack, Mako's, Tongue & Groove, Chaos, John Harvard's Brew House, Paradox, Frequency & Havana Club.Scott Henry, \\"Buckhead Rising\\", Creative Loafing, 2006-05-31 The area became renowned as a party spot for Atlanta area rappers and singers, including Outkast, Jazze Pha, Jagged Edge, Usher and Jermaine Dupri, who mentioned the neighborhood's clubs on his song \\"Welcome to Atlanta.\\" Following the events of the Ray Lewis murder case in Buckhead on the night of the 2000 Super Bowl (held in Atlanta at the Georgia Dome), as well as a series of murders involving the Black Mafia Family, residents sought to ameliorate crime by taking measures to reduce the community's nightlife and re-establish a more residential character. The Buckhead Coalition's president and former Atlanta Mayor Sam Massell, along with councilwoman Mary Norwood were instrumental in persuading the Atlanta City Council to pass a local ordinance to close bars at 2:30 AM rather than 4 AM, and liquor licenses were made more difficult to obtain. Eventually, most of the Buckhead Village nightlife district was acquired for the \\"Buckhead Atlanta\\" multi-use project, and many of the former bars and clubs were razed in 2007.Clark Dean, \\"Lost in Buckhead Atlanta\\", Atlanta Business Journal, June 29, 2011 Charlie Loudermilk Park and the Buckhead Theater in Buckhead Village In 2008, a newsletter by the Fulton County Taxpayers Foundation began circulating that proposed the secession of Buckhead into its own city after more than 50 years as part of Atlanta. This came on the heels of neighboring Sandy Springs, which finally became a city in late 2005 after a 30-year struggle to incorporate, and which triggered other such incorporations in metro Atlanta's northern suburbs. Like those cities, the argument to create a city of Buckhead is based on the desire for more local control and lower taxes. Geography Buckhead was originally the central area now called \\"Buckhead Village\\". The current usage of the term Buckhead roughly covers the interior of the \\"V\\" formed by Interstate 85 on the east and Interstate 75 on the west.

In 2011, The Gadberry Group compiled the list of the 50 wealthiest zip codes in the United States, ranking Buckhead's western zip code (30327) as the second wealthiest zip code in the South (behind Palm Beach's 33480) and the second wealthiest zip code east of California and south of Virginia. The same group reported the average household income at $280,631, with an average household net worth of $1,353,189. These 2011 figures are up from a similar 2005 study that pegged Buckhead as the wealthiest community in the South and the only settlement south of the Washington D.C. suburb of Great Falls, and east of the Phoenix suburb of Paradise Valley to be among the 50 wealthiest communities in the country. However, according to Forbes magazine, (30327) is the ninth- wealthiest zip code in the nation, with a household income in excess of $341,000. The Robb Report magazine has consistently ranked Buckhead one of the nation's \\"10 Top Affluent Communities\\" due to \\"the most beautiful mansions, best shopping, and finest restaurants in the Southeastern United States\\".Buckhead: A Place for All Time Due to its wealth, Buckhead is sometimes promoted as the \\"Beverly Hills of the East\\" or \\"Beverly Hills of the South\\" in reference to Beverly Hills, California, an area to which it is often compared. Economy A portion of the Buckhead skyline seen from Lenox Square At the heart of Buckhead around the intersections of Lenox, Peachtree and Piedmont Roads, is a shopping district with more than 1,500 retail units where shoppers spend more than $3 billion a year. In addition, Buckhead contains the highest concentration of upscale boutiques in the United States. The majority are located at Lenox Square and Phipps Plaza, sister regional malls located diagonally across from each other at the intersection of Peachtree and Lenox Roads. The malls are home to designer boutiques, mainstream national retailers, as well as six major department stores. This commercial core also has a concentration of \\"big-box\\" retailers. The \\"Buckhead Atlanta\\" mixed-use development brought even more exclusive boutiques, restaurants, hotels, condos and office space to the heart of Buckhead in 2014. The name of the project was rebranded as 'Buckhead Atlanta'. The Alhambra, historic apartments in the Garden Hills neighborhood Buckhead is also a center for healthcare, and is home both to Piedmont Hospital and the private, catastrophic care hospital Shepherd Center which specializes in spinal cord injury and acquired brain injury.

Cityscape The Sovereign Building completed in late 2008, is Buckhead's tallest building. While much of west and north Buckhead is preserved as single-family homes in forested settings, the Peachtree Road corridor has become a major focus of high-rise construction. The first 400-foot (121 m) office tower, Tower Place, opened in 1974. Park Place, built in 1986, was the first 400+ foot (121+ m) condominium building. 1986 also saw the completion of the 425-foot (129 m), 34-story Atlanta Plaza, then Buckhead's tallest and largest building. In 2000, Park Avenue Condominiums pushed the record to 486 feet (148 m). Since that time, a wave of development has followed. The 660-foot (201 m) Sovereign and 580-foot (177 m) Mandarin Oriental, now renamed the Waldorf-Astoria, were completed in 2008. Many luxury high-rise apartment buildings have been built recently, including the 26-story Post Alexander High Rise in 2014 and the 26-story Skyhouse Buckhead in 2014. Today, Buckhead has over 50 high-rise buildings, almost one- third of the city's total.Emporis Building Database: Buckhead Atlanta Education =Primary and secondary schools= Public schools in Buckhead are administered by Atlanta Public Schools.

Transportation =Roadways= The Georgia Governor's Mansion, located on West Paces Ferry Road The main north-south street of Buckhead is Peachtree Road, which extends south into the heart of the city as Peachtree Street, Atlanta's main street. This name change is significant in that it defines a border between Buckhead and Midtown. The main east-west street is Paces Ferry Road, named for a former ferry that used to cross the Chattahoochee River. Hardy Pace, one of Atlanta's founders, operated the ferry and owned much of what is now Buckhead. In addition to Peachtree and West Paces Ferry Roads, other arterial roads include Piedmont Road (Georgia 237), Roswell Road (Georgia State Route 9), and Northside Parkway. =Mass transit= In the early 1990s, after a bitter fight against GDOT by residents, Buckhead was split in two by Georgia 400, a tolled extension of a freeway connecting I-285 to I-85. However, MARTA's Red Line extension was put in the highway's median, providing additional mass transit to Buckhead and Sandy Springs. MARTA operates three stations in Buckhead, the southernmost being Lindbergh Center. Just north of there, the Red and Gold lines split, with the Gold Line's Lenox station at the southwest corner of the Lenox Square parking lot, and the Red Line's Buckhead station on the west side of the malls where Peachtree crosses 400. A free circulator bus called \\"the buc\\" (Buckhead Uptown Connection) stops at all three stations. The proposed extension of the Atlanta Streetcar to Buckhead (nicknamed the \\"Peachtree Streetcar\\" because it would run along Peachtree Street in Downtown Atlanta and Peachtree Road in Buckhead) would provide street-level service with frequent stops all the way to downtown Atlanta, complementing the existing subway-type MARTA train service for the area. =Pedestrians and cycling= *North Beltline Trail (Under construction) *Chastain Park Trail *Mountain To River Trail *Paces Ferry Trail *PATH400,\\"First phase of PATH400\\", Buckhead Patch which provides a 5.2 mile pathway throughout the heart of Buckhead that connects different trails and parks. PATH400 connects the people of Buckhead to surrounding neighborhoods, offices, and retail locations. Bike Share In 2017, the Relay Bike Share program expanded into Buckhead. Three new stations were installed with plans to add more in the future.

Biography =Early life= Litterick was born in Glasgow, Scotland. He received an education at Clydebrooke and Glasgow, and became a member of the British Socialist Party at age sixteen (his father was also a lifelong socialist). He was jailed for his role in a rent riot at Clydebank in 1920, and joined the newly formed Communist Party of Great Britain the same year. =Politics= Litterick moved to Canada in 1925 and initially worked as a miner in Alberta and British Columbia. In 1926, he became the district secretary of the Communist Party of British Columbia. He moved to Montreal in 1930, and became an organizer for the Workers Unity League, a Communist trade union umbrella designed to build a revolutionary trade union movement in Canada. When Communist Party leader Tim Buck was arrested in 1931, Litterick moved to Toronto to take over some of his responsibilities. He soon moved to Winnipeg. In 1934, Litterick was selected as Provincial Secretary of the Communist Party of Manitoba. He married Molly Bassin in 1936. =MLA: 1936‚Äì40= He was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1936, during a period of increased popularity for the party. His campaign focused on eliminating the province's 2% wage tax. In that election, he was very popular among Winnipeg workers. He placed second, behind Independent Socialist Lewis Stubbs, on first-preference votes. Winnipeg at the time elected ten members via preferential balloting. Litterick regarded himself as an ally of Stubbs, a popular left-wing judge and Independent Socialist. Litterick's primary support base was in Winnipeg's working-class north end. He received considerable support from the city's Jewish community (his wife, Molly, was Jewish). Stubbs was declared elected and on the second count, Litterick received numerous surplus vote transfers from him and was declared elected as well. Litterick was not a major figure in the national Communist Party. He delivered a speech entitled \\"Whither Manitoba\\" in 1937, which was subsequently issued as a pamphlet. Beyond this, he did not play a significant public role in the party's national activities. Because of his loyalty to Moscow, Litterick expressed changing views on Canada's involvement in World War II in late 1939. On September 9, he urged both Premier John Bracken and Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to give full support to Poland against Nazi Germany's invasion. Litterick subsequently was required by the party to retract this position, and to oppose the war as an imperialist venture, in light of the Soviet Union's neutrality in the conflict at the time. (Later the CPC put their support behind the war after Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941.) =Later life= He was expelled from the Manitoba legislature in 1940, after the Communist Party was declared an illegal organization. He had already gone into hiding, apparently the subject of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police manhunt. Information about Litterick's whereabouts after 1940 is limited. He appears in a photograph of Canada's wartime Communist Party leaders, apparently taken in Montreal in 1942.Classiques.uqac.ca He surrendered to the RCMP in Toronto in 1942 and was interned in the Don Jail. In 1943, it was reported that he was working at a garment factory in Toronto.

The decoration was first created in 1963 and is presented to members of any Coast Guard unit that distinguishes itself by valorous or extremely meritorious service, not involving combat, but in support of Coast Guard operations. It may also be awarded to units and personnel of the other U.S. armed forces, typically when in support of operations where the Coast Guard is the lead service. One example was the award of the commendation with Operational Distinguishing Device to rescue squadrons of the U.S. Air Force and maritime patrol squadrons and helicopter squadrons of the U.S. Navy, when said units assisted the Coast Guard during search and recovery operations following the January 1986 loss of the NASA Space Shuttle Challenger. Additional awards of the Coast Guard Unit Commendation are denoted by award stars. The Operational Distinguishing Device, a 5/16 inch silver letter \\"O\\" centered on the unit of the uniform ribbon, is also authorized for units which are presented the decoration for field operations and conditions. Prior to 2003, the Coast Guard Unit Commendation was subordinate to the Secretary of Transportation Outstanding Unit Award. With the transfer of the Coast Guard to the Department of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Transportation Outstanding Unit Award became obsolete, making the Coast Guard Unit Commendation the senior peacetime award, but junior to the Joint Meritorious Unit Award and the Presidential Unit Citation.

Cheney has voiced support for same-sex marriage, and has been credited with encouraging her father's approval of same-sex marriage, which he has publicly supported since leaving the vice presidency. In December 2006, Cheney was reported to be pregnant.Argetsinger, Amy; Roberts, Roxanne. (December 6, 2006) Mary Cheney and Partner Are About to Be Moms The Washington Post. Accessed May 28, 2007. Cheney and Poe were said to be \\"ecstatic\\" about the baby. \\"The vice president and Mrs. Cheney are looking forward with eager anticipation to the arrival of their sixth grandchild,\\" spokesperson Lea Anne McBride said on December 5. On January 31, 2007, in a forum by Glamour Magazine at Barnard College of Columbia University, Mary Cheney stated that: \\"This is a baby... This is a blessing from God. It is not a political statement. It is not a prop to be used in a debate by people on either side of an issue. It is my child.\\" Cheney gave birth to their first child, a son, in May 2007. Cynthia Leive, the editor in chief of Glamour, asked Cheney if she had anything to say to critics like James Dobson, who has denounced same-sex marriage and LGBT people raising children. Cheney accused Dobson of distorting the research he cited, and added: \\"Every piece of remotely responsible research that has been done in the last 20 years has shown there is no difference between children raised by same-sex parents and children raised by opposite-sex parents; what matters is being raised in a stable, loving environment.\\" She also said that Dobson was entitled to his opinion, \\"but he's not someone whose endorsement I have ever drastically sought.\\" Mary Cheney gave birth to her second child, a daughter, on November 18, 2009.

Nevertheless, Cheney's sexual orientation was publicly known, and some considered her presence during the campaign as bolstering, providing the Republican ticket with a \\"compassionate conservative\\" image. During an interview with Lynne Cheney, Cokie Roberts brought up the topic of Mary Cheney's having declared herself gay. Lynne Cheney responded by stating that \\"Mary has never declared such a thing,\\" and criticized Roberts and the media for their interest in the story. In 2002, Mary Cheney joined the Republican gay-straight alliance Republican Unity Coalition and said that sexual orientation should be \\"a non-issue\\" for the Republican Party.

Cheney did not publicly express her opinion of the amendment at the time. In her 2006 autobiography Now It's My Turn, Cheney stated her opposition to the amendment. However, at the time, she remained silent to support Bush's re-election bid. In August 2004, Dick Cheney reiterated the position he took in the 2000 Presidential campaign: that the issue should be handled by individual state governments. He added, though, that President Bush determined his administration's policies, and his policy supported the Federal Marriage Amendment. =2004 presidential re-election campaign= During the 2004 Presidential re-election campaign for the Bush- Cheney administration, during which Cheney served as her father's director of vice presidential operations, the subject of her sexual orientation arose again. The 2004 presidential election debates included mentions of the same- sex marriage debate and referred, initially indirectly, to Cheney. Both Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry and vice-presidential candidate John Edwards mentioned and praised Cheney's openness with regard to her sexual orientation when questioned regarding gay issues. During the Cheney-Edwards vice-presidential debate, moderator Gwen Ifill directed a question to the Vice President in which his daughter was indirectly mentioned:Ifill, Gwen.

I appreciate that very much.\\" Ifill followed up: \\"That's it?\\" Cheney replied, \\"That's it,\\" effectively ending the discussion of his daughter's sexual orientation. At the end of the debate, Mary Cheney appeared on the podium with her partner and the rest of the family. During the third and final Bush-Kerry presidential debate, moderator Bob Schieffer asked, \\"Do you believe homosexuality is a choice?\\" John Kerry replied, \\"If you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, she's being who she was born as.\\"Schieffer, Bob.

In the book, published in 2006, Cheney discusses how she came out to her parents, recounting her father's initial reaction: \\"You know, look, you're my daughter and I love you and I just want you to be happy.\\" She also discusses her relationship with her partner, Heather Poe. Gay rights advocates criticized her for waiting until after the 2004 election to voice her disapproval of the Bush administration's positions on gay rights. During another appearance by Cheney on May 19, 2006, on the Late Show with David Letterman, David Letterman brought up some of the issues raised by the gay community. He asked Cheney why she had waited two years after the 2004 election to speak publicly about gay marriage and LGBT rights, and asked whether she had any input with the Bush administration regarding gay issues. Cheney responded that she did not, and that it had not been her job to do so.

History  Historically, Cyrillic U evolved as a specifically East Slavic short form of the digraph used in ancient Slavic texts to represent . The digraph was itself a direct loan from the Greek alphabet, where the combination (omicron-upsilon) was also used to represent . Later, the o was removed, leaving the modern upsilon-only form.

The letter is usually romanised into English and most other West European languages as : Krylov (family name, ).

In proper nouns, however, may occur after consonants: 'Ulan-Ude' and 'Blair'. However, many such loanwords are spelled with : 'Bl√©riot' (a French aviator). That is the case especially for names that entered the language centuries ago like: , 'Berlin'. The use of is much more frequent for names from non-European languages: 'Mao Zedong'. The letter is also used in Russian to render initial in foreign words: thus (the river in France) is written . After consonants this is transcribed as .

Nicknamed ‚ÄúAustrian Stinnes‚Äù, he was active in aviation's pioneering days and invested in the arts. Castiglioni was credited as being instrumental to the founding of what would eventually become BMW AG. Early life Castiglioni was born in Trieste, then part of Austria-Hungary, to the chief rabbi. It is not known when Camillo developed his interest in aviation, but it is known that he was passionate about flying. Camillo's education was primarily law, gaining employment as an attorney and legal officer of a bank in Padua, quickly learning international finance and how to manage capital. He was the son of a rubber maker, so naturally Camillo found work with the Austro-American Gummiwarenfabrik AG (rubber products) in Vienna as an Agent for the Kaufmann automobile tire division in Constantinople. Camillo found great success in this position, demonstrating his abilities to negotiate and structure financial deals. In fact, Camillo was so successful, he was promoted to Director of the export department of the parent company in Vienna. Around 1901, along with Viktor Silberer and Franz Hinterstoissera Camillo helped to create the Viennese aero club (later Austrian aero club). He eventually was made deputy director, then in 1904 he was appointed to General Director of the company. Through his experience in the rubber and tire production field, Camillo saw the birth of aviation as an industry, going from a ballooning hobby, to makeshift glider craft requiring tires, to fully operational aircraft operated by engines. He met many influential men in his business, and came to realize that aviation sparked not only his passion for flight, but also recognized the tremendous financial opportunity of aviation's potential as an industry. In order to draw from the arising enthusiasm for airplanes and ballooning, as well as to take advantage of the lucrative business the hobby generated, Camillo established one of his first companies, Luftfahrzeug-Gesellschaft, in 1907. Being a pure commercial firm ‚Äì it acquired the Etrich balloon patents and sold balloon fliers in Austria Hungary. There were many contests that these inspired balloon drivers entered, and Camillo was no different- he bought his own balloon and successfully took his balloon driver examination on 24 August 1909. Aviation financing During the First World War, he became one of the richest and most influential financiers in Central Europe. The first major investor in the series production of aircraft. 1914 Purchased the German aircraft company Hansa- und Brandenburgische Flugzeugwerke, which employed Ernst Heinkel as its chief designer. Acquired a majority holding in Austro-Daimler with its chief designers Puch and Porsche. Press \\"Czar\\" and sponsor of the arts (financed Max Reinhardt and helped him to organize the Salzburg Festival). After a series of setbacks, his financial empire broke up in 1926. He retired to Switzerland, then to Milan where he set up a private bank and once again amassed a considerable fortune. After the Second World War, negotiated a large US loan for his friend Josip Broz Tito in Yugoslavia. When Tito refused to pay his commission, Castiglioni succeeded in getting Yugoslavian assets in Italy worth millions sequestered. 1916 Awarded the Franz Joseph Order with ribbon on the Military Service Cross for his services to aviation 1918 with the St-Georges Order for his achievements in the war material production. Castiglioni became rich in ventures during the period of inflation, acquiring a majority interest in Alpine Montan AG. The Austrian aviation company √ñsterreichische Luftfahrtsgesellschaft was founded by him. BMW influence Castiglioni significantly influenced the development of BMW AG in its early years. The granting of a license agreement by Austro- Daimler to the Rapp-Werke in 1917 was partly attributable to Castiglioni. 1918 At Castiglioni's insistence the Wiener Bankverein (Vienna) acquired the majority of BMW's share capital. 1922 Castiglioni purchased all the equipment relating to engine construction, the associated know-how and the rights to the name \\"Bayerische Motoren Werke AG\\" from the BMW AG, which was renamed S√ºddeutsche Bremse AG. Castiglioni in turn renamed the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke to BMW AG and allowed the renamed company to continue production at the BFW plant. From the establishment of BMW AG until November 9, 1922 and then from 1924 to 1929, he was a member of the Supervisory Board and President of BMW AG. 1928 Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board. His was one of the voices that urged BMW in 1928 to purchase the Eisenach Automobilwerke. Due to financial difficulties in 1929 he was obliged to surrender his holding of BMW shares to a consortium of banks (Deutsche Bank, Disconto, Bankhaus Hagen etc.). A consortium led by the Deutsche Bank and the Diskonto-Gesellschaft purchased the BMW shares previously held by Camillo Castiglioni, who was facing problems of liquidity. Failed speculation and bankruptcy In February 1924, Castiglioni partnered with Fritz Mannheimer, and later other influential bankers to speculate on the devaluation of the French franc. They shorted hundreds of millions of franc, eventually causing the franc to drop almost 40% in less than a month. By the beginning of March 1924, one United States dollar was worth 28 francs. Then, however, investment bank Lazard, on the behalf of Banque de France and powered by J.P. Morgan & Co., bought immense amounts of francs, causing the franc to rise again, to 15 franc per dollar. Castiglioni, Mannheimer and their partners lost millions. In September 1924, the Austrian Depositenbank, of which Castiglioni had been president, collapsed. A warrant for his arrest on a charge of fraud was issued, but Castiglioni had been taken care to be in Italy when the crash came. The Austrian State said that if he deposited $4,200,000 ($ in present-day value), he could return unmolested. Philanthropy Castiglioni built up a large art collection and a theatre in Vienna. He was the richest man in Central Europe and much beloved by the Viennese whom he assisted financially on Sundays and odd occasions. He was also a patron of the arts and for some time supported the famed producer Max Reinhardt, for whom he built a theater. So fond was he of appearing in the public limelight that he lived with all the pomp and ceremony of royalty, even traveling in the Kaiser Karl's private parlor car, which he bought. Because of his famous banking activities, his life was documented in a 1988 movie on television titled Camillo Castiglioni oder die Moral der Haifische (in English: Camillo Castiglioni, or the morality of sharks), directed by Peter Patzak.

In human sexuality, the term scoptophilia describes the sexual pleasure that a person derives from looking at prurient objects of eroticism, such as pornography, the nude body, and fetishes, etc., as a substitute for actual participation in a sexual relationship.Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language (Unabridged) (1976), p. 2036 Psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud used the term scopophilia to describe, analyse, and explain the concept of , the pleasure in looking,Lacan, Jacques. The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis (1994) p. 194. a curiosity which he considered a partial-instinct innate to the childhood process of forming a personality;Freud, Sigmund Freud On Sexuality (PFL 7) pp. 109‚Äì110. and that such a pleasure-instinct might be sublimated, either into Aesthetics, looking at objets d'art or sublimated into an obsessional neurosis \\"a burning and tormenting curiosity to see the female body\\", which afflicted the Rat Man patient of the psychoanalyst Freud.Freud, Sigmund. Case Histories II (PFL 9) pp. 41‚Äì42. From that initial interpretation of Schaulust arose the psycho- medical belief that the inhibition of the scopic drive might lead to actual, physical illness, such as physiologic disturbances of vision and eyesight.Freud, Sigmund. On Psychopathology (PFL 10) pp. 112‚Äì113. In contrast to Freud's interpretation of the scopic drive, other psychoanalytic theories proposed that the practices of scopophilia might lead to madness ‚Äî either insanity or a mental disorder ‚Äî which is the scopophilic person's retreat from the concrete world of reality into an abstract world of fantasy.Fenichel, Otto. The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (1946) p. 177. The theoretic bases of Scoptophilia were developed by the psychoanalyst Otto Fenichel, in special reference to the process and stages of psychological identification.Otto Fenichel, The Scoptophilic Instinct and Identification (1953) That in developing a personal identity, \\"a child, who is looking for libidinous purposes . . . wants to look at an object in order [for it] to ‚Äòfeel along with him‚Äô.\\"Fenichel, Otto. Theory, p. 71. That the impersonal interaction of scopophilia (between the looker and the looked-at) sometimes replaced personal interactions in the psychological life of a person who is socially anxious, and seeks to avoid feelings of guilt.Fenichel, Otto. Theory, p. 348. Lacan's conceptual development of the gaze linked the pleasure of scopophilia to the person's apprehension of the Other (person) who is not the Self; that is: \\"The gaze is this object lost, and suddenly re-found, in the conflagration of shame, by the introduction of the Other.\\"Lacan, Jaxques, p. 183. The practice of scopophilia is how a person's desire is captured by the imaginary representation of the Other.Lacan, Jacques. Television (1990) p. 86. Theories alternative to Lacan's interpretations of scopohilia and the gaze proposed that a child's discovery of genital difference, and the accompanying anxiety about not knowing the difference of the Other sex, is the experience that subsequently impels the child's scopic drive to fulfil the desire to look and to look at. Literary examples * The Satyricon (The Book of Satyr-like Adventures, AD 1st c.), by Gaius Petronius Arbiter, presents the scoptophilic description of a priestess of Priapus as the woman who was \\"the first to put an inquisitive eye to a crack she had naughtily opened, and spy on their play with prurient eagerness.\\"Petronius, The Satyricon (Penguin 1986) pp. 50; 188. * In Secret Sexualities: A Sourcebook of 17th and 18th Century Writing (2003), by Ian McCormick, shows that transgressive sexuality is composed of the inter- relationships between the public and the private spheres and between the open and the secret aspects of a person's life. The example is Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure (1749), in which the protagonist Fanny Hill gives her scoptophilic observations of two sodomites, which include descriptions of the furnishings and the d√©cor of the room in which they are copulating: ‚Äú. . . at length I observed a paper patch of the same colour as the wainscot, which I took to conceal some flaw; but then it was so high that I was obliged to stand upon a chair to reach it, which I did, as soft as possible, and, with a point of a bodkin, soon pierced it, and opened myself espial room sufficient. And now, applying my eye close, I commanded the room perfectly, and could see my two young sparks romping and pulling one another about, entirely, to my imagination, in frolic and innocent play.‚ÄùMcCormick, Ian.

(c.f. scopophobia) That the social practice of scopophilia is meant to definitively fix the appearance and the identity of the Other (person) who is not the Self, by way of the gaze that objectifies and dehumanizes a person as \\"not I\\" and thus \\"not one of us.\\" In that philosophic vein, the practices of cultural scopophilia restrict the number and type of visible representations of \\"outsiders\\" people in a society.Todd W. Reeser, Masculinities in Theory (2011) pp. 164‚Äì5 Cinema In Psycho (1960), directed by Alfred Hitchcock, the protagonist Norman Bates is a voyeur whose motel rooms feature peepholes. In the course of the story, the motel manager Norman spies upon the anti-heroine as she undresses in her ostensibly private room. In Peeping Tom (1960), directed by Michael Powell, Scopophilia is mentioned as a psychological affliction of the protagonist, Mark Lewis. As narrative cinema, Peeping Tom is a deliberate exercise in voyeurism for the protagonist and for the spectator, which demonstrates how readily the protagonist and the spectator are mentally willing and morally capable of watching atrocities (torture, mutilation, death) that should not be gazed upon as narrative movies. The mentally ill protagonist acted as he acted consequent to severe mental mistreatment in boyhood, by his film-maker father; the paternal abuse mentally malformed Mark into a reclusive, introverted man comfortable with torturing and killing people. In the 1970s, parting from Lacan's propositions, psychoanalysts of the cinema used the term scopophilia to identify and to describe the aesthetic and emotional pleasures (often pathological), and other unconscious mental processes that occur in the minds spectators gazing at a film.Jane Mills,\\"The Money Shot\\" (2001) , p. 223John Thornton Caldwell, Televisuality: Style, Crisis, and Authority in American Television (1995) , p. 343 Yet voyeurism and the male gaze are psychological practices basic to the spectators' emotional experience of viewing mainstream, commercial cinema;J. Childers, G. Hentzi. The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism (1995) pp. 316‚Äì17. notably, the male gaze is fully presented, described, and explained, and contrasted with the female gaze, in the essay \\"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\\" (1975), by Laura Mulvey. Nonetheless, in Roll over Adorno: Critical Theory, Popular Culture, Audiovisual Media (2006) other analyses indicate that theories of scopophilia and the male gaze scapegoat the variegated pleasures of watching a narrative film as entertainment.

Black Emperor, released as a double album on 9 October 2000 on vinyl by Constellation and 8 November 2000 on CD by Kranky. Structure and details The four tracks on Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven are composed of individually named internal movements. The album is primarily instrumental, except for sampled voice inserts and the one minute \\"Moya Sings 'Baby-O'...\\". The samples on the album are often used to send some satirical, political, or poetic message. The inner panels of the vinyl edition released by Constellation contain a diagram used to illustrate the relative lengths of movements within the four tracks; each movement is drawn by Efrim Menuck, as a rectangular block with its length determined by the proportion of the track it comprises. Some of the blocks are shifted slightly upwards to show an increase in intensity. The movement title and the numerical length are denoted either above or below the square. The same diagram is provided as a paper insert in the CD edition from Kranky. The inside cover drawings were taken from William Schaff's \\"Notes to a Friend; Silently Listening No. 2\\", illustrations taken \\"from a series of small little books [Schaff] self released in the late 90s, and early into the 21st century\\". The cover is a redrawn version, by John Arthur Tinholt, of one of Schaff's pieces from that series. The flip side of the vinyl contains various photographs taken by the band. Reception On Metacritic, the album has a score of 84 based on 13 reviews, indicating \\"Universal acclaim\\". Pitchfork called it a \\"massive and achingly beautiful work\\", describing the first disc as \\"a refinement of the sound that crystallized on the Slow Riot EP\\" whilst the second disc \\"flirts with moments of vertiginous shoegazing, looser rock drumming and reckless crescendos of unalloyed noise\\". Alternative Press called it \\"a massive instrumental effort\\" that is \\"as skilled and musical as it is on-the-fly improvised and messy\\".Alternative Press #150, p. 94 The A.V. Club called the album \\"as beautiful and disarming as its predecessors\\". Tiny Mix Tapes called the album \\"alternately hypnotic and captivating, sleepy and startling\\" comparing its sounds to \\"a far subtler Pink Floyd\\". The Austin Chronicle called it \\"cinematic\\" and \\"breathtaking in its grandiose beauty\\". The album went on to be included in numerous year-end and decade-end music lists. Magnet included it in its \\"20 Best Albums of 2000\\" list.Magnet 1-2/01, p. 45 NME ranked it number 16 in its \\"Top 50 Albums of the Year\\".NME 12/30/00, p. 78 Sputnikmusic named it the 6th best album of the 2000s. Pitchfork named it the 5th best album of the year. and the 65th best album of the decade. They also ranked the first movement of the track 'Storm' at #283 on their list of \\"Top 500 tracks of the 2000s\\". Tiny Mix Tapes ranked it 7th on their \\"Favorite 100 Albums of 2000‚Äì2009\\" list. LAS Magazine ranked it the 14th greatest album of the decade. Gigwise included the album on its list of the 50 best albums of the 2000s. In their 20th anniversary review of pop culture from 2000, The A. V. Club published a piece on this album as one of their \\"Permanent Records\\", with reviewer Andrew Paul writing that it feels \\"prophetic\\" to listen to in the 21st century, with the content \\"somehow even more terrifying, beautiful, and awesome\\". A 2020 BBC overview of double albums lists this as an \\"honorable mention\\" for releases that the audience needs to hear. Track listing The album consists of four continuous tracks on the compact disc release split into two CDs. The double LP release has each track pressed onto its own side. Time lengths of individual movements are taken from the official discography. Times for each movement appear in the album's cover art, but those times are very inaccurate. While the movements of the tracks are listed, the names of the four tracks that make up the album are unlisted on the CD. Disc one Disc two =Notes= *\\"Broken Windows, Locks of Love Pt. III\\" was originally named \\"3rd Part\\". *\\"She Dreamt She Was a Bulldozer, She Dreamt She Was Alone in an Empty Field\\" was originally named \\"John Hughes\\", presumably after the film director. *\\"Monheim\\" and \\"Chart #3\\" were recorded on 22 November 1998 ‚Äì but not broadcast until 19 January 1999 ‚Äì for John Peel's radio show, before the release of Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven, as the first two movements of a piece called \\"Hung Over as the Queen in Maida Vale\\". (Maida Vale is the location of Maida Vale Studios, a complex of BBC sound studios; the sessions for John Peel's radio show were recorded there.)

The phrase originated at Xerox PARC. Some philosophers of mind have argued that consciousness is a form of user illusion. This notion is explored by Tor N√∏rretranders in his 1991 Danish book M√¶rk verden, issued in a 1998 English edition as The User Illusion: Cutting Consciousness Down to Size. He introduced the idea of exformation in this book. Philosopher Daniel Dennett has also embraced the view that human consciousness is a \\"user- illusion\\".\\"Human consciousness is unlike all other varieties of animal consciousness in that it is a product in large part of cultural evolution ... creating thereby a cognitive architecture unlike the 'bottom-up' minds of animals.... [T]his architecture furnishes each of us with ... a user-illusion\\" (Daniel C. Dennett, From Bacteria to Bach and Back: The Evolution of Minds (2017), p. 370). According to this picture, our experience of the world is not immediate, as all sensation requires processing time. It follows that our conscious experience is less a perfect reflection of what is occurring, and more a simulation produced unconsciously by the brain. Therefore, there may be phenomena that exist beyond our peripheries, beyond what consciousness could create to isolate or reduce them.  Criticism  Critics of the idea of consciousness being a device for justifying preconceptions argue that such a device would consume nutrients without producing any useful results, since it would not change the outcome of any decisions. These critics argue that the existence of social insects with extremely small brains falsifies the notion that social behavior requires consciousness, citing that insects have too small brains to be conscious and yet there are observed behaviors among them that for all functional intents and purposes match those of complex social cooperation and manipulation (including hierarchies where each individual has its place among paper wasps and Jack Jumper ants and honey bees sneaking when they lay eggs). These critics also argue that since social behavior in insects and other extremely small-brained animals have evolved multiple times independently, there is no evolutionary difficulty in simple reaction sociality to impose selection pressure for the more nutrient-consuming path of consciousness for sociality. These critics do point out that other evolutionary paths to consciousness are possible, such as critical evaluation that enhances plasticity by criticizing fallible notions, while pointing out that such a critical consciousness would be quite different from the justificatory type proposed by N√∏rretranders, differences including that a critical consciousness would make individuals more capable of changing their minds instead of justifying and persuading.How the body shapes the way we think: A new view of intelligence, Rolf Pfeifer, Josh BongardInformation Processing in Social Insects: Claire Detrain, Jean L.

He served as Governor of Tennessee from 1871 to 1875, and was president of the state's 1870 constitutional convention, which wrote the current Tennessee State Constitution. Although he originally opposed secession, Brown fought for the Confederacy during the American Civil War, eventually rising to the rank of major-general.Anne-Leslie Owens, \\"John Calvin Brown (1827-1889),\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 31 October 2012. A leader of the state's Bourbon Democrats, Brown dedicated much of his time as governor to solving the state's mounting debt issues. Following his gubernatorial tenure, he advocated railroad construction, briefly serving as president of the Texas & Pacific Railroad in 1888, and as president of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company in 1889. Early life and education John Calvin Brown was born in Giles County, Tennessee, the son of Duncan and Margaret Smith Brown. He was the younger brother of Neill S. Brown, who served as governor of Tennessee in the late 1840s. John graduated from Jackson College in Columbia, Tennessee, in 1846.Finding Aid for John Calvin Brown Papers , Tennessee State Library and Archives, website, 2007. Retrieved: 31 October 2012. He studied law with his uncle, Hugh Brown, in Spring Hill, and was admitted to the bar in 1848. He began practicing law in Pulaski that same year.Phillip Langsdon, Tennessee: A Political History (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 193-195. Like his brother, Brown was a Whig prior to the American Civil War, and following the Whig Party's collapse in the mid-1850s, he continued to support former Whig candidates. During the presidential election of 1860, he served as an elector for the Constitution Union Party candidate John Bell, who opposed secession, and took a neutral stance on the issue of slavery. In the weeks following the Battle of Fort Sumter in April 1861, however, secessionist sentiment swept across Middle Tennessee, and Brown, along with his brother and, eventually, John Bell, switched sides and supported the burgeoning Confederacy.Oliver Perry Temple, East Tennessee and the Civil War (Johnson City, Tenn.: Overmountain Press, 1995), pp. 221-229. American Civil War In May 1861, Brown enlisted as a private in the Confederate infantry, and was elected colonel of the 3rd Tennessee Infantry shortly afterward. He was later placed in charge of a brigade consisting of three Tennessee regiments. Following the surrender of Fort Donelson, he was held as a prisoner of war for six months in Fort Warren, Massachusetts, before being exchanged in August 1862. Soon afterwards, he was promoted to brigadier-general and assigned command of a new and larger brigade composed of troops from Florida and Mississippi. He took part in Braxton Bragg's campaigns in Kentucky and Tennessee in late 1862 through 1863. Brown was wounded in the battles of Perryville and Chickamauga while leading his brigade. His men were a part of the defensive line on Missionary Ridge in 1863. In 1864, Brown fought in the Atlanta Campaign, at various times temporarily commanding a division. In August, he was promoted to major-general and formally assigned command of a division in Cheatham's Corps. He was again wounded at Battle of Franklin in 1864, where six of his fellow generals were killed. He was incapacitated for several months and did not rejoin the army until the end of the Carolinas Campaign in April 1865. He surrendered with Joseph E. Johnston's forces at Bennett Place and was paroled a month later. Governor of Tennessee Governor Brown's home in Pulaski (present-day Grissom Colonial Hall) Brown returned to Pulaski and resumed his law practice following the war. He was elected to the Tennessee General Assembly in 1869. In the following year, he was a delegate to the state constitutional convention, and was elected its president by his peers. This convention overhauled the state's 1834 constitution, essentially updating it to meet post-Civil War demands. The document most notably guaranteed the right to vote to all males of at least 21 years of age, regardless of race, but also instituted a poll tax. Although it has been amended a number of times, it remains Tennessee's current state constitution. Brown in 1902 Although he had been a Whig before the Civil War, Brown joined the Democratic Party after the war, and was nominated as the party's candidate for governor in 1870. Since the new constitution restored voting rights to ex-Confederates, Brown easily defeated his Republican opponent, William H. Wisener of Shelbyville, by a 78,979 to 41,500 vote. He was reelected by a narrower margin, 97,700 votes to 84,089, over Republican candidate Alfred A. Freeman in 1872. Tennessee Blue Book (1890), p. 54. Brown's most pressing issue was the state's skyrocketing debt. In previous decades, Tennessee had accumulated $43 million in bonded debt, mostly to pay for internal improvements, such as turnpike construction and loans to railroads. Governor William Brownlow exacerbated the problem by issuing more bonds to pay the interest on outstanding bonds in the late 1860s. By the time Brown took office, the state was struggling to pay the interest on this debt. Brown managed to reduce the state's bonded debt to $20 million, and eliminated all of the state's floating debt. His efforts proved futile, however, and the state eventually defaulted following the Panic of 1873. Brown's administration enacted the state's first truly effective public school legislation, which called for the establishment of county and city school superintendents, and the creation of the office of State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Brown also advocated a board of directors to govern local school districts, and the organization of separate schools for African- American and white children. To support these schools, Governor Brown called for the Legislature to institute a small state tax and give cities and counties the power to raise additional taxes. In 1875, along with several other former Confederate generals, he competed for an open United States Senate seat, but lost on the 54th ballot in the state legislature to former President Andrew Johnson. Later life In 1876, Brown, who supported Thomas A. Scott's efforts to build a transcontinental railroad in the South, joined the Texas & Pacific Railroad as a vice president. He was appointed receiver of this railroad in 1885, and was elevated to president in 1888. The following year, he became president of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company, which was one of the largest industrial firms in the South. Brown also served as president of the Bon Air Coal Company, a coal mining operation on the Cumberland Plateau near Crossville, in the 1880s.John Benhart, Appalachian Aspirations: The Geography of Urbanization and Development in the Upper Tennessee River Valley, 1865-1900 (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2007), p. 31. Brown fell ill in the Summer of 1889, and traveled to Red Boiling Springs, a mineral springs resort in north-central Tennessee, in hopes of recovering. On August 17, 1889, however, he suffered a stomach hemorrhage and died. His body was returned to Pulaski and interred in the city's Maplewood Cemetery. Personal life Brown's first wife, Anne Pointer, died in 1858. They had no children. He married his second wife, Elizabeth Childress of Murfreesboro, in 1864. Her paternal aunt was First Lady Sarah Childress Polk, and her father resided at the Childress-Ray House. They had four children: Marie, Daisy, Elizabeth, and John C. Brown, Jr.Annie Somers Gilchrist, Some Representative Women of Tennessee (Nashville: McQuiddy Printing Company, 1902), p. 15. Brown's wife, Elizabeth, was among the women featured in Annie Somers Gilchrist's 1902 book, Some Representative Women of Tennessee. The Browns' daughter, Marie, was married to Governor Benton McMillin.

Two of the most important components in krill oil are omega-3 fatty acids similar to those in fish oil, and phospholipid-derived fatty acids (PLFA), mainly phosphatidylcholine (alternatively referred to as marine lecithin). Studies have shown toxic residues in Antarctic krill and fish; however, the United States Food and Drug Administration has accepted notices from krill oil manufacturers declaring that krill oil and products derived from it meet the standards for Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status, although the FDA itself has not tested the products. While not an endangered species, Antarctic krill are a mainstay of the diets of many ocean-based species including whales and there is some environmental and scientific concern that their population has decreased dramatically both due to climate change and human harvesting. Difference between krill oil and fish oil Krill oil and oceanic fish oil are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, mainly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). While both contain some EPA and DHA as free fatty acids, krill oil contains particularly rich amounts of choline-containing phospholipids and a phosphatidylcholine concentration of 34 grams per 100 grams of oil.

SAR11 members are highly dominant organisms found in both salt and fresh water worldwide - possibly the most numerous bacterium in the world, and were originally known only from their rRNA genes, which were first identified in environmental samples from the Sargasso Sea in 1990 by Stephen Giovannoni's laboratory in the Department of Microbiology at Oregon State University and later found in oceans worldwide. P. ubique and its relatives may be the most abundant organisms in the ocean, and quite possibly the most abundant bacteria in the entire world. It can make up about 25% of all microbial plankton cells, and in the summer they may account for approximately half the cells present in temperate ocean surface water. The total abundance of P. ubique and relatives is estimated to be about 2 √ó 1028 microbes.\\"Candidatus Pelagibacter Ubique.\\" European Bioinformatics Institute.

The Pelagibacter genome takes up about 30% of the cell's volume. It is gram negative., Gauthier, Nicholas; Zinman, Guy; D‚ÄôAntonio, Matteo; Abraham, Michael. Comparative Microbial Genomics DTU course. 2005. It recycles dissolved organic carbon. It undergoes regular seasonal cycles in abundance - in summer reaching ~50% of the cells in the temperate ocean surface waters. Thus it plays a major role in the Earth's carbon cycle. Its discovery was the subject of \\"Oceans of Microbes\\", Episode 5 of \\"Intimate Strangers: Unseen Life on Earth\\" by PBS.View \\"Oceans of Microbes\\" http://www.podcastdirectory.com/podshows/4339749 Cultivation Several strains of Pelagibacter ubique have been cultured thanks to improved isolation techniques. The most studied strain is HTCC1062 (high-throughput cultivation collection). The factors that regulate SAR11 populations are still largely unknown. They have sensors for nitrogen, phosphate, and iron limitation, and a very unusual requirement for reduced sulfur compounds. It is hypothesised that they have been molded by evolution in a low nutrient ecosystem, such as the Sargasso Sea where it was first discovered.Giovannoni Lab http://giovannonilab.science.oregonstate.edu/ A population of P. ubique cells can double every 29 hours, which is fairly slow, but they can replicate under low nutrient conditions. P. ubique can be grown on a defined, artificial medium with additions of reduced sulfur, glycine, pyruvate and vitamins. Genome The genome of P. ubique strain HTCC1062 was completely sequenced in 2005 showing that P. ubique has the smallest genome (1,308,759 bp) of any free living organism encoding only 1,354 open reading frames (1,389 genes total). The only species with smaller genomes are intracellular symbionts and parasites, such as Mycoplasma genitalium or Nanoarchaeum equitans It has the smallest number of open reading frames of any free living organism, and the shortest intergenic spacers, but it still has metabolic pathways for all 20 amino acids and most co-factors. Its genome has been streamlined. This streamlining concept is important because it reduces the amount of energy required for cell replication. P. ubique saves energy by using the base pairs A and T (‚âà70.3% of all base pairs) because they contain less nitrogen, a resource that is hard for organisms to acquire. Non-coding RNAs have been identified in P. ubique through a bioinformatics screen of the published genome and metagenomic data. Examples of ncRNA found in these organisms include the SAM-V riboswitch, and other cis-regulatory elements like the rpsB motif. Another example of an important ncRNA in P. ubique and other SAR11 clade members is a conserved, glycine-activated riboswitch on malate synthase, putatively leading to \\"functional auxotrophy\\" for glycine or glycine precursors in order to achieve optimal growth. It is found to have proteorhodopsin genes, which help power light-mediated proton pumps. Subtle differences arise in the expression of its codon sequences when it is subjected to either light or dark treatments. More genes for oxidative phosphorylation are expressed when it is subjected to darkness. Name The name of the genus (Pelagibacter) stems from the Latin masculine noun pelagus (\\"sea\\") combined with the suffix -bacter (rod, bacterium), to mean \\"bacterium of the sea\\". The connecting vowel is an \\"i\\" and not an \\"o\\", as the first term is the Latin \\"pelagus\\" and not the Greek original œÄŒ≠ŒªŒ±Œ≥ŒøœÇ (pelagos) (the word pelagus is a Greek word used in Latin poetry, it is a 2nd declension noun with a Greek-like irregular nominative plural pelagƒì and not pelagi). The name of the specific epithet (ubique) is a Latin adverb meaning \\"everywhere\\"; species with the status Candidatus are not validly published so do not have to be grammatically correct, such as having specific epithets having to be adjectives or nouns in apposition in the nominative case or genitive nouns according to rule 12c of the IBCN. The term \\"Candidatus\\" is used for proposed species for which the lack of information (cf.) prevents it from being a validated species according to the bacteriological code,JUDICIAL COMMISSION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE ON SYSTEMATIC BACTERIOLOGY: Minutes of the meetings, 2 and 6 July 1994, Prague, Czech Republic\\" Int.

Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola ( , , ; 1 October 15077 July 1573), often simply called Vignola, was one of the great Italian architects of 16th century Mannerism. His two great masterpieces are the Villa Farnese at Caprarola and the Jesuits' Church of the Ges√π in Rome. The three architects who spread the Italian Renaissance style throughout Western Europe are Vignola, Serlio and Palladio. Biography Giacomo Barozzi was born at Vignola, near Modena (Emilia-Romagna). He began his career as architect in Bologna, supporting himself by painting and making perspective templates for inlay craftsmen. He made a first trip to Rome in 1536 to make measured drawings of Roman temples, with a thought to publish an illustrated Vitruvius. Then Fran√ßois I called him to Fontainebleau, where he spent the years 1541‚Äì1543. Here he probably met his fellow Bolognese, the architect Sebastiano Serlio and the painter Primaticcio. After his return to Italy, he designed the Palazzo Bocchi in Bologna. Later he moved to Rome. Here he worked for Pope Julius III and, after the latter's death, he was taken up by the papal family of the Farnese and worked with Michelangelo, who deeply influenced his style (see Works section for details of his works in this period). In 1558, he was in Piacenza to revise the designs of Palazzo Farnese, commissioned by Margaret of Austria, wife of the Duke Ottavio Farnese and daughter of Emperor Charles V. From 1564 Vignola carried on Michelangelo's work at St Peter's Basilica, and constructed the two subordinate domes according to Michelangelo's plans. Giacomo Barozzi died in Rome in 1573. In 1973 his remains were reburied in the Pantheon, Rome. Works =Major Architectural Works= Vignola's main works include: *Villa Giulia for Pope Julius III, in Rome (1550‚Äë1553). Here Vignola was working with Ammanati, who designed the nymphaeum and other garden features under the general direction of Vasari, with guidance from the knowledgeable pope and Michelangelo. A medal of 1553 shows Vignola's main villa substantially as it was completed, save for a pair of cupolas. *Villa Farnese at Caprarola (1559‚Äì1573); *Villa Lante at Bagnaia (1566 onwards), including the gardens and their water features and casini; *Chiesa del Ges√π, Rome, the mother church of the Jesuit order, which would become a source for Baroque church facades in the 17th century; *Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli, Assisi (with Galeazzo Alessi); *Church of Sant'Andrea in Via Flaminia, Rome, the first church to have an oval dome, which became a signature of the Baroque. *Palazzo dei Banchi, Bologna *Palazzo Farnese, Piacenza. This was a grandiose project of a vast palace on a scale paralleled only by the Vatican Palace in Italy; the rectangular plan is circa 111 metres by 88 metres. The actual construction, however, made up only less than a half of Vignola's original project and lacked many of the planned architectural features; missing elements include part of the exterior surrounding walls, the main fa√ßade, modelled on the ancient triumphal arch and with a large tower, and a theater in the large inner courtyard. =Other Architectural Works= Cloister of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum *The main courtyard of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum, formerly the convent of the Church of Santi Domenico e Sisto, is traditionally attributed to Vignola but completed after his death. Ten arches on the long sides and seven on the short are sustained by pilasters with Tuscan style ornamentation that rise from high plinths. A simple frieze with smooth triglyphs and metopes separates the lower from the upper levels.http://www.romaspqr.it/roma/Fontane/Fontane%20Palazzi%20Cortili/fontana_chiesa_ss_domenico_e_sisto.htm Retrieved 3 May 2013 =Unbuilt Works= Like many other architects, Vignola submitted his plans for completing the facade of San Petronio, Bologna. Designs by Vignola, in company with Baldassare Peruzzi, Giulio Romano, Andrea Palladio and others furnished material for an exhibition in 2001Marzia Faietti and Massimo Medica, 2001. La Basilica incompiuta: Progetti antichi per la facciata di San Petronio (Ferrara: Edisai) =Written Works= Le due regole della prospettiva prattica, 1682 His two published books helped formulate the canon of classical architectural style. The earliest, Regola delli cinque ordini d'architettura [\\"Canon of the five orders of architecture\\"] (first published in 1562, probably in Rome), presented Vignola's practical system for constructing columns in the five classical orders (Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite) utilising proportions which Vignola derived from his own measurements of classical Roman monuments.Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc., Palladio's Literary Predecessors The clarity and ease of use of Vignola's treatise caused it to become in succeeding centuries the most published book in architectural history.Vignola, Canon of the Five Orders of Architecture, translated with an introduction by Branko Mitrovic (New York: Acanthus Press, 1999), p. 17. . Vignola's second treatise, Due regole della prospettiva pratica [\\"Two rules of practical perspective\\"], published posthumously with extensive commentary by the mathematician Ignazio Danti (Bologna 1583), favours one-point perspective rather than two-point methods such as the bifocal construction. Vignola presented‚Äî without theoretical obscurities‚Äî practical applications which could be understood by a prospective patron.

Early life and education Born in Drumheller, Alberta, Siddon pursued engineering, graduating with distinction from the University of Alberta in 1963, winning the Gold Medal in Mechanical Engineering, followed by earning his Masters and Doctorate in aeroacoustics from the University of Toronto, Institute of Aerospace. He became a professor at the University of British Columbia and founded a successful aero-acoustics firm, Siddon-Harford & Associates. Political career After serving as City Councillor in Richmond, BC for two years, he was first elected to parliament in a 1978 election as a Progressive Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) to represent the British Columbia riding of Burnaby‚ÄîRichmond‚ÄîDelta. He was successively elected in five federal elections between 1978 and 1993, and worked under several Prime Ministers. When Brian Mulroney became leader of the PC Party, Siddon was appointed the party's science critic in the shadow cabinet. After the Tories won the 1984 election, he was given the cabinet post of Secretary of State for Science and Technology. Siddon proved to be a hard working and competent MP, and was promoted to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans position on November 21, 1985, in the wake of the tunagate scandal that had forced the resignation of previous minister, John Fraser. Siddon remained in the Fisheries post for five years, until 1990, overseeing one of the most important eras in Canadian fishing history. By the mid-1980s, it was evident that severe overfishing was soon going to have consequences. Siddon thus attempted to impose stiff quotas on the catch; however, in retrospect, Siddon did not go far enough, and in 1991, a complete moratorium on cod fishing had to be imposed. In 1990, Siddon moved to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development position. Shortly after his swearing-in, Siddon was left to tackle another crisis alongside his provincial counterpart John Ciaccia, as the Oka Crisis broke out. Siddon's greatest legacies and successes were also achieved as Minister of Indian Affairs with the agreement in 1992 to create the new territory of Nunavut, and the establishment of the British Columbia Treaty Process. When fellow British Columbian and ally Kim Campbell became PC leader and prime minister in 1993, Siddon was promoted to the senior cabinet, becoming Minister of National Defence on June 25, 1993. In this role, he was responsible for ordering new EH-101 navy helicopters to replace the aging Sea King helicopters. The deal was finalized, but the opposition Liberal Party of Canada made it an election issue and argued that the helicopters were too expensive. After winning the election, the Liberals cancelled the contract and incurred cancellation fees of $500 million (CAD). The Sea Kings have since had numerous crashes and require 30 hours of maintenance for every hour of flight time. Siddon entered the 1993 election expecting a tough battle. His support for native land claims and his earlier fishing quotas had made him one of the top targets of the new Reform Party of Canada. Siddon ended up finishing third behind Raymond Chan of the Liberal Party and Nick Loenen of Reform. After federal politics Siddon returned to the private sector, but remained active in Tory politics. He supported Peter MacKay's leadership bid in 2003, and later became an early advocate of union between the Tories and Canadian Alliance. Following his federal political career, Siddon remained active as a consultant, lecturer and corporate board member. He speaks frequently on the political challenges of combating global climate change and the long range implications for water supply management. Siddon was the founding Chair of the Okanagan Water Stewardship Council, and a member of the RBC Blue Water Advisory Panel. In 2007, he was awarded a Doctorate of Laws from the University of British Columbia  Okanagan, received the University of Alberta Honour Award in 2009, the 2010 UBC Alumni Award of Distinction, and was the 2017 recipient of the University Of Toronto Engineering Alumni Hall of Distinction Award. Siddon made a return to politics when he was elected to the Board of Education in Penticton, B.C. in November 2008. His campaign was based on more openness by the board with fewer in-camera meetings. Siddon was also a strong vocal opponent to the board's decision to tear down a historic auditorium and gymnasium in the local high school. Following a successful three years on the School Board, in 2011 Siddon decided not to seek re- election, but rather ran for the position of Area 'D' Director for the Regional District of Okanagan Similkameen. Siddon defeated his two contenders, receiving 50.5% support in ballots cast. In 2014 he was re-elected as Area 'D' Director. In February 2018, Siddon announced that he would be retiring from politics, and that he would not be seeking re-election in October 2018. Lawsuit Siddon was successful in settling out of court after hitting outspoken radio commentator Rafe Mair with a massive defamation lawsuit in the mid 1990s. Mair publicly apologized for comments made towards Siddon, and settled for what is said to be hundreds of thousands of dollars.

It is made from cardoon thistle, raw sheep's milk and salt. The cheese is soft and gooey. The cheese becomes harder and chewier as time goes by. The region's ancient bordaleira sheep are also prized for their wool. Cuisine The region's cuisine is well-regarded and includes dishes such as breaded sweet sardines and Juniper beef stew.

December 19, 2017 The Conchos dam The Serra da Estrela is also home to a hydroelectric system of dams, part of which is the Cov√£o dos Conchos. The Cov√£o dos Conchos looks like a natural sinkhole within the lake at first glance, but it was constructed as a spillway in 1955 and acts as a water diversion from Ribeira das Naves to Lagoa Comprida. History, legends and myths A legend associated with the mountain is mentioned in chapter 41 of the American literary classic, Moby-Dick: :\\"... the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface)...\\" Archaeological investigations have allowed a picture of life during the fifth millennium BC, the Early Neolithic to emerge, where small communities sustained themselves by small game hunting, the gathering of acorn and other winter fruits, and migratory pastoralism. The raising of sheep and goats, introduced to the region by the first Neolithic settlers - suggests that spring and summer were spent on high ground pastures and winter on the lower grounds of the river valleys. The significance of the Serra da Estrela in Neolithic culture can be seen in the discovery that megaliths in the Mondego River basin were predominantly built with an alignment that allowed the mountain range to be seen from within the inner chamber. At the same time the rise of Aldebaran, the brightest star of Taurus, behind the mountains could also be seen and its Heliacal rising in late April/early May could have been used as a temporal marker for the movement to the high pastures of Serra da Estrela. This archaeological narrative closely mirrors the local folklore that explains the name of the mountain range.

Biography Lamont was born at Corriemulzie near Inverey in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The son of Robert Lamont (forester to Earl Fife) and Elizabeth Ewan, his education began at the local school in Inverey, near Braemar. In 1817 his father died and John was sent to be educated at St James' monastery (Scots Benedictine College) at Ratisbon, Germany. He began to work in astronomy and joined the Bogenhausen Observatory, became its director in 1835, took his doctorate of philosophy in 1830 and became professor of astronomy in 1852 at Munich University. At the observatory he undertook the task of creating a star catalog that had about 35,000 entries. In 1845 he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His most important work was on the magnetism of the Earth. He performed magnetic surveys in Bavaria and northern Germany, France, Spain, and Denmark. He discovered a magnetic decennial period (ten-year cycle) and the electric current in the Earth closing the electric \\"circuit\\" creating the magnetic field in 1850. This roughly matched the eleven-year sunspot cycle discovered by Heinrich Schwabe. He calculated the orbits of the moons of Uranus and Saturn, obtaining the first value for Uranus' mass. By chance he observed Neptune in 1845 and twice in 1846, but did not recognize the object as being a new planet. He died, unmarried and without children, in Munich, Germany, on 6 August 1879. His considerable wealth was used to found scholarships in sciences. He is buried in Bogenhausen Churchyard on the edge of Munich. Publications Lamont is the author of Handbuch des Erdmagnetismus (1849). Honours His many honours include ForMemRS and FRSE. In 1867 he was awarded the Merit Order of the Bavarian Crown by the King of Bavaria, through which Lamont was ennobled and permitted to use the predicate \\"von\\". The statue on his tomb in Munich has him with an open hand, into which the locals put small coins. In 1934 the Deeside Field Club erected a granite memorial cairn in his memory at Inverey, Scotland. It was unveiled by Sir James Jeans. The following astronomical features were named in his honor: * Lamont (Martian crater). * Lamont (lunar crater).

It had 41 members: 13 members of each of the Houses of Commons of Southern Ireland and of Northern Ireland; 7 members of each of the Senates of Southern Ireland and of Northern Ireland; and a President chosen by the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. It never met and was abolished in 1925. Purpose Under Section 2 of the 1920 Act, the Council was established with the following purpose: Under Section 7 of the 1920 Act, the Council could make orders concerning matters which were within the remit of the respective Parliaments of Southern and Northern Ireland. The Council's Orders required royal assent in the same way Bills of either of the Parliaments also required such assent. Establishment The Council was duly established on the \\"Appointed Day\\", 3 May 1921. On 23 June 1921, the House of Commons of Northern Ireland duly elected its 13 chosen members to the Council: *Robert Anderson *J. M. Andrews *Milne Barbour *Dawson Bates *William Coote *James Craig *Herbert Dixon *William Grant *Robert Johnstone *Crawford McCullagh *Samuel McGuffin *Robert McKeown *David Shillington The House of Commons of Southern Ireland was a body which although established, never functioned and never elected members to the Council; most of its members instead sat in the republican Second D√°il. In fact, the Council of Ireland never met. Adaptation of Council under Treaty The Anglo-Irish Treaty made provision for the continuation of the Council of Ireland after the Irish Free State was established. Under the Treaty, if Northern Ireland chose to opt out of the Irish Free State (as in fact it subsequently did), the Council was to continue but the Council's powers could then only be applied to Northern Ireland and not to the Irish Free State. While its functions only applied to Northern Ireland, its membership continued to be 40: 20 selected by each of the Parliaments of the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland respectively and one by the King's representative. Therefore, after the Treaty, it was no longer the all-Ireland body originally envisaged as its powers applied only to Northern Ireland. Instead, it was a body in which the Irish Free State might influence the affairs of Northern Ireland and consequently was increasingly distrusted by the Government of Northern Ireland.Michael J. Kennedy, Division and Consensus: The Politics of Cross-border Relations, 2000 The Council never met. On 23 January 1922 Michael Collins, then head of the Provisional Government in Dublin, met Sir James Craig, then Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, in London, and they agreed amongst other matters that: \\"The two Governments [are] to endeavour to devise a more suitable system than the Council of Ireland for dealing with problems affecting all Ireland.\\"Craig- Collins Agreement text Abolition After the collapse of the Irish Boundary Commission in 1925, the 1921 Treaty was amended 3 December 1925 by agreement between United Kingdom, Northern Ireland and Irish Free State governments. The Council of Ireland was essentially abolished, as it was transferred to the care of the Northern Ireland government that did not intend to work towards a united Ireland in the foreseeable future.

She is known for her erotic poetry, in which she praised the vulva among other things. Life Gwerful Mechain lived in Mechain in Powys. Little is known of her life, but it is generally accepted that she was a descendant of a noble family from Llanfechain. Her father was Hywel Fychan of Mechain in Powys, her mother was named Gwenhwyfar, and she had at least four siblings (three brothers and a sister). She married John ap Llywelyn Fychan and had at least one child, a daughter named Mawd. Work She is perhaps the most famous female Welsh- language poet after Ann Griffiths (1776‚Äì1805), who was also from northern Powys. Her work, composed in the traditional strict metres, including cywyddau and englynion, is often a celebration of religion or sex, sometimes within the same poem. Probably the most famous part of her work today is her erotic poetry, especially Cywydd y Cedor (\\"Poem to the Vagina\\"), a poem praising the vulva. In it, she upbraids male poets for celebrating so many parts of a woman's body but ignoring \\"the middle.\\" \\"Let songs about the quim circulate,\\" she adjures her readers. \\"Lovely bush, God save it.\\" She actively participated in the poetic culture of her day. Many of her surviving poems are examples of Ymrysonau, or poetic or bardic contentions or debates, with contemporaries such as Dafydd Llwyd of Mathafarn, Ieuan Dyfi and Llywelyn ap Gutun.

The church is famous for its fresco cycles which include works by Domenico Ghirlandaio, Benozzo Gozzoli, Taddeo di Bartolo, Lippo Memmi and Bartolo di Fredi. The basilica is located within the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the \\"Historic Centre of San Gimignano\\", with its frescos being described by UNESCO as \\"works of outstanding beauty\\".UNESCO: Historic Centre of San Gimignano, (accessed 05-09-2012) History The first church on the site was begun in the 10th century. During the early 12th century the importance of San Gimignano, and its principal church, grew steadily, owing to the town's location on the pilgrimage route to Rome, the Via Francigena. The present church on this site was consecrated on 21 November 1148 and dedicated to St. Geminianus (San Gimignano) in the presence of Pope Eugenius III and 14 prelates. The event is commemorated in a plaque on the facade. The power and authority of the city of San Gimignano continued to grow, until it was able to win autonomy from Volterra. The church owned land and enjoyed numerous privileges that were endorsed by papal bulls and decrees.San Gimignano (accessed 02-09-2012) It was elevated to collegiate status 20 September 1471.Emanuele Repetti, Gazetteer, physicist, historian of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, Florence, 1833-1846. During the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries, the church was enriched by the addition of frescos and sculpture. The western end of the building (liturgical east) was altered and extended by Giuliano da Maiano between 1466 and 1468, with the work including vestries, the Chapel of Conception and the Chapel of St Fina. The church was damaged during World War II, and during the subsequent restoration in 1951 the triapsidal eastern end of the earlier church was discovered lying beneath the nave of the present church. The church possesses the relics of St. Geminianus, the beatified Bishop of Modena and patron saint of the town, whose feast day is celebrated on 31 January. On 8 May 1300 Dante Alighieri came to San Gimignano as the Ambassador of the Guelph League in Tuscany.Cummune di San Gimignano, (accessed 02-09-2012) Girolamo Savonarola preached from the pulpit of this church in 1497. Architecture Interior, Collegiate Church The Collegiate Church stands on the west side of Piazza del Duomo, so named although the church has never been the seat of a bishop. The church has an east-facing facade, and chancel to the west, as at St Peter's Basilica. The architecture is 12th and 13th century Romanesque with the exception of the two chapels in the Renaissance style. The facade, which has little ornament, is approached from the square by a wide staircase and has a door into each of the side aisles, but no central portal. The doorways are surmounted by stone lintels with recessed arches above them, unusual in incorporating the stone Gabbro. There is a central ocular window at the end of the nave and a smaller one giving light to each aisle. The facade, which is stone, was raised higher in brick in 1340, when the ribbed vaulting was constructed, and the two smaller ocular windows set in. Matteo di Brunisend is generally credited as the main architect of the medieval period, with his date of activity given as 1239, but in fact his contribution may have been little more than the design of the central ocular window. Beneath this window is a slot which marks the place of a window which lit the chancel of the earlier church, and may be the most visible sign of the church's reorientation in the 12th century rebuilding, although this is not entirely agreed upon by scholars. To the north side of the church, in the corner of the transept and chancel, stands a severely plain campanile of square plan, with a single arched opening in each face. The campanile may be that of the earlier church, as it appears to mark the extent of the original western facade, or it may have been one of the city's many tower houses, pressed into service of the church. To the south side of the church is the Loggia of the Baptistry, a 14th-century arcaded cloister with stout octagonal columns and a groin vault. Internally, the building is in the shape of a Latin Cross, with central nave and an aisle on either side, divided by arcades of seven semi-circular Romanesque arches resting on columns with simplified Corinthianesque capitals. The chancel is a simple rectangle with a single arched window at the terminal end. The roofs throughout are of quadripartite vaults which date from the mid 14th century. Although Gothic by date and decoration, the profiles of the ribs are semi-circular in the Romanesque manner. The clerestory has small windows, inserted when the nave was vaulted, along with lancet windows in the north aisle, the aisle windows were subsequently blocked for the painting of the fresco cycle, making the interior very dark. Decoration The Romanesque architectural details of the church's interior are emphasised by the decorative use of colour, with the voussoirs of the nave arcades being of alternately black and white marble, creating stripes, as seen at Orvieto Cathedral. The vault compartments are all painted with lapis lazuli dotted with gold stars, and the vaulting ribs are emphasised with bands of geometric decoration predominantly in red, white and gold. The church is most famous for its largely intact scheme of fresco decoration, the greater part of which dates from the 14th century, and represents the work of painters of the Sienese school, influenced by the Byzantine traditions of Duccio and the Early Renaissance developments of Giotto. The frescoes comprise a Poor Man's Bible of Old Testament cycle, New Testament cycle, and Last Judgement, as well as an Annunciation, a Saint Sebastian, and the stories of a local saint, St Fina, as well as several smaller works. =Old Testament cycle= The Creation of Adam by Bartolo di Fredi The wall of the left aisle had six decorated bays, of which the paintings of the first bay are in poor condition and those of the sixth have been damaged and in part destroyed by the insertion of the pipe organ. The remaining paintings, with the exception of a repainted panel in the sixth bay, are the work of Bartolo di Fredi, and, according to an inscription, were completed around 1356. The paintings are in three registers and proceed from left to right chronologically in each register. Upper level The upper register occupies the lunettes beneath the vault and depicts the story of Creation. # Creation of the Firmament # Creation of Man # Adam names the animals # Creation of Eve # God commands Adam and Eve not to touch the forbidden fruit # The Original Sin (lost) Middle level Pharaoh and his soldiers are drowned crossing the Red Sea, from the Old Testament cycle by Bartolo di Fredi The second register has ten remaining scenes, with two at the furthest right having been lost with the insertion of the organ. # The Expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden (very incomplete) # Cain kills Abel (very incomplete) # Noah and his family building the Ark # Animals entering the Ark # Noah and his family giving thanks after the Great Flood # The Drunkenness of Noah # The departure of Abraham and Lot from the land of the Chaldeans # Abraham and Lot go separate ways. # Joseph's dream # Joseph is put into a well by his brothers # Story of Joseph in Egypt (lost) # Story of Joseph in Egypt (lost) Lower level In the lower register, there are ten scenes. # Joseph, has his brothers arrested (very incomplete) # Joseph makes his identity known to his family (incomplete) # Moses changes the rod into a serpent # The army of Pharaoh are drowned in the Red Sea. (this scene occupies two sections) # Moses on Mount Sinai # The devil is sent to Job by God # The men and herds of Job are killed # The house of Job falls, killing his sons. # Job prays to God # Job, plagued by boils, is visited by friends. (incomplete) # (Lost scene) =New Testament cycle= The six decorated bays of the right aisle, with scenes of the New Testament, pose a problem of authorship. Giorgio Vasari states that they are the work of \\"Barna of Siena\\" and relates that Barna fell to his death from the scaffolding.Giorgio Vasari, Le Vite delle pi√π eccellenti pittori, scultori, ed architettori, Part I, \\"Barna of Siena \\", (accessed 11-09-2012) The name \\"Barna\\" in relation to paintings at the Collegiate Church of San Gimignano appears to have originated in Lorenzo Ghiberti's Commentaries. In 1927 the archivist Peleo Bacci made the suggestion that Barna had never existed and that the paintings are the work of Lippo Memmi. This hypothesis received no support and little comment for fifty years. In 1976 discussion of Bacci's attribution was revived, with Moran suggesting that there had been a mis-transcription of \\"Bartolo\\" as \\"Barna\\", with the name \\"Bartolo\\" referring to Bartolo di Fredi, painter of the Old Testament cycle.Gordon Moran, Is the name Barna an incorrect transcription of the name Bartolo, Sansoni, Florence (1976) The attribution of the New Testament cycle to Lippo Memmi, perhaps assisted by his brother Federico Memmi and father Memmo di Filippucci, is now generally agreed. Lippo Memmi was influenced by his more famous brother-in-law, Simone Martini. Lippo Memmi also painted a large Maesta in the Town Hall of San Gimignano, in imitation of that done by Simone Martini at the Town Hall of Siena. The New Testament cycle of the right aisle appears to pre-date the Old Testament cycle and is generally accepted to date from c.1335-1345. The scenes within the New Testament cycle are organised into four separate narratives, and do not follow a clear left- to-right pattern as do those of the left aisle. As with the left aisle, they are divided into three registers, the upper being the lunettes between the vaults. Upper level The upper register shows the Birth of Christ. The series reads from right to left, in six bays. # The Annunciation # The Nativity and adoration of the shepherds # The adoration of the Magi # The Presentation at the Temple # The Massacre of the Innocents # The Flight into Egypt Middle level The middle register shows scenes of the Life of Christ, beginning at the 4th bay, below the picture of the Presentation at the Temple, and reading left to right, with eight scenes. The scenes have been skilfully juxtaposed so that narrative elements may be compared or contrasted. Within the fourth bay is shown the Presentation of the Temple, Jesus sitting among the Doctors of the Temple of Jerusalem as a twelve-year-old, and Jesus before his crucifixion, enthroned, crowned with thorns and mocked. # Jesus among the Doctors of the Temple of Jerusalem # The Baptism of Jesus # The Calling of Peter # The Wedding at Cana of Galilee (damaged in WWII) # The Transfiguration # The Resurrection of Lazarus # Jesus enters Jerusalem # The people welcome Jesus to Jerusalem (the final two scenes are a single event spread over two frames) Lower level The lower register, showing the Passion of Christ, continues beneath the Entry into Jerusalem, and is read from right to left in eight scenes over four bays. # The Last Supper # Judas agrees to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver # Jesus prays in the Garden of Gethsemane # The Kiss of Judas # Jesus at the Praetorium # The Scourging of Jesus # Jesus crowned with thorns and mocked # Jesus carrying the cross to Calvary Bays five and six Bay five, beneath the lunette of the Slaughter of the Innocents, has a single large scene of the Crucifixion. Bay six, beneath the lunette of the Flight into Egypt contained four scenes (destroyed in the 15th century) of post-crucifixion events which are thought to have been: # The Deposition # The Descent into Limbo # The Resurrection # Pentecost =The Last Judgement= This scene is painted in fresco on the inner wall of the facade and the adjoining walls of the nave. The work was completed in 1393 by Taddeo di Bartolo, one of the foremost Sienese painters of the 14th century. The central section shows the figure of Christ as Judge, accompanied by the Virgin Mary and St John, with the Apostles. On the right wall is the image of Paradise, in a ruined state. On the left side Hell is represented, along with various depictions of the gruesome torments to be suffered by those who commit and of the Seven Deadly Sins. =Chapel of Santa Fina= This chapel off the right aisle, which has been described as \\"one of the jewels of Renaissance architecture, painting and sculpture\\", is dedicated to a young girl, Serafina, known as \\"Fina\\" and regarded locally as a saint. Fina, a child renowned for her piety, was orphaned at an early age, and then suffered a disease which rendered her invalid. She lay each day on a wooden palette, and was nursed by two women. According to her legend, eight days before her death at the age of fifteen, Fina had a vision of Pope Gregory who told her that death was near. On the day of her death, 12 March 1253, the bells of San Gimignano rang spontaneously, and large pale mauve flowers grew around her palette. As her nurse laid out her body, her hand moved, touching the nurse and healing her of paralysis that she had suffered as the result of many hours of supporting Fina's head. On the day of her funeral, a blind choir boy had his sight restored by touching her feet. It is said that mauve flowers bloom in San Gimignano every year on the anniversary of her death. A chapel dedicated to St Fina was built off the right aisle by Giuliano da Maiano, and has architectural details and a finely carved altarpiece by Benedetto da Maiano. The side walls of the chapel were painted in fresco by Domenico Ghirlandaio around 1475, showing, on the walls, Santa Fina's visitation by Pope Gregory and Santa Fina's Funeral, with the various miracles including the two healings and an angel rings the bells in the background. The vault and spandrels were decorated by Sebastiano Mainardi and have figures of Evangelists, Prophets and Doctors of the Church. =Chapel of the Conception= The chapel was built in 1477 and modified in the 17th century. The side lunettes have frescoes by Niccolo di Lapi representing the Birth of the Virgin and St Philip Neri celebration mass. The vault shows the Coronation of the Virgin painted by Pietro Dandini. The altarpiece is the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception by Ludovico Cardi, late 16th century. =Other artworks= The Martyrdom of St Sebastian by Benozzo Gozzoli (1465) honours the saint who was invoked in times of plague. St Sebastian On the rear wall of the nave, beneath the Last Judgement is a fresco of the Martyrdom of St Sebastian painted by Benozzo Gozzoli in 1465. The work was commissioned by the people of San Gimignano as the result of a vow that they made to honour the saint, whose intervention was believed to have brought relief from an outbreak of plague in 1464. The painting shows the figure of Christ and the Virgin Mary in Glory, while below, St Sebastian, standing on a Classical plinth and bristling with arrows, suffers martyrdom and is crowned by angels. Benozzo Gozzoli received his training under Lorenzo Ghiberti while working on the Baptistry doors. He fulfilled two other important commissions in San Gimignano. Both were at the Church of Sant' Agostino, a fresco cycle of the life of St Augustine of Hippo executed 1464-65, and another St Sebastian, showing the townsfolk sheltering beneath his cloak.Diane Cole Ahl, Benozzo Gozzoli's Frescoes of the Life of Saint Augustine in San Gimignano: Their Meaning in Context, Artibus et Historiae, Vol. 7, No. 13 (1986), pp. 35-53 The Annunciation The Annunciation, by Sebastiano Mainardi is located in the Baptistry Loggia beside the church. In the Baptistery Loggia to the south of the church are several small frescoes of saints, and a major work, The Annunciation, previously attributed to Ghirlandaio but now believed to be the work of Sebastiano Mainardi and dated to 1482. In front of The Annunciation stands the font, which was removed from the church and placed in this position in 1632. It is hexagonal, with a sculptured relief on the side, that to the front being the Baptism of Christ, with the two adjoining panels containing kneeling angels. It is the work of the Sienese sculptor Giovanni di Cecco and was commissioned by the Wool-workers Guild in 1379. Works by Jacopo della Quercia and others * The Annunciate angel and the Virgin Mary, two figures carved in wood by Jacopo della Quercia stand towards the end of the nave. They were created around 1421 and later decorated with polychrome by Martino di Martolomeo. * Pope Gregory predicts the death of St Fina, an early 14th-century fresco in a lunette of the right nave arcade, thought to be the work of Nicolo di Segna di Bonaventura. * The main altar of the church has a large marble ciborium and two kneeling angels with candlesticks, the work of Benedetto Maiano, created at the same time as the altarpiece and tabernacle in the Chapel of Santa Fina, 1475. * The crucifix of the chancel is by the Florentine sculptor, Giovanni Antonio Noferi, 1754. Noferi also designed the marble pavement of the chancel.

When a given swim calls more on endurance than on outright speed, it is the more likely to be considered a long-distance swim. Long-distance swims, however, may take place in pools, such as the 1st official 24 hours World Championship in 1976 won by Peppo Biscarini with a record of 83.7 km (24 hour swims in a 50 m-long pool) or the current 25 meter pool world record of 2008 Olympic gold medalist Maarten van der Weijden Some of the better-known long- distance swims are crossings of the English Channel, Catalina Channel, Fehmarn Belt and Cook Strait. Ultra-long distance swimming is sometimes referred to as marathon swimming. The minimum distance that constitutes a marathon swim has dramatically shortened over time. Different organizations adopt various minimum distances. The swimming marathon events at the Olympic games have a distance of 10 km. Long-distance swims tend to fall into one of two categories: (1) swims in which the start date and start time are chosen by the individual swimmer (often called solo-swims), and (2) swims that involve a group-start. Long-distance swimming is one of the events wherein there are women's records that beat men's records under equal conditions.http://www.active.com/swimming/articles/men-vs-women-in-endurance- sports Organization regulations Swim organizations, for the purposes of their record keeping, often impose other rules. FINA and International Marathon Swimming Hall of Fame do not keep records for swims that employ thermal insulating material, drag reduction fabrics, buoyancy aids, breathing apparatus, propulsion prosthetics, etc. For major channel crossings, most organizations do allow the swimmer to use outside help, an example being that the swimmer swims alongside a boat that uses sophisticated electronics and telecommunications to help the swimmer take the easiest path through surface currents and tides. Such boats can also make the challenge easier for the swimmer by blocking wind and surface chop. Such boats also carry food and hot beverages for the swimmer to consume periodically during the swim (e.g. every 20 to 30 minutes). In another variant, some swim organizations simply have different sets of records for different equipment scenarios (e.g. wetsuit and non-wetsuit divisions), similar to the structure of free diving record keeping.  Long-distance swimming in the Netherlands  The Netherlands has a rich tradition in these races, which are known in Dutch as langebaanzwemmen (literally \\"long-lane swimming\\"). , some have been organised continually for over 50 years. Many Dutch competitors have also achieved prestige in the international arena, such as Herman Willemse, Judith de Nijs, Lenie de Nijs, Joke van Staveren, Monique Wildschut, Irene van der Laan, Hans van Goor, Edith van Dijk and Maarten van der Weijden (Olympic medalist). In the Netherlands, there are three categories of langebaanzwemmen: * Prestatietochten (lit. \\"achievement-tour\\"): distances over 250 m for all categories (inclusive of participants without a racing permit). * Langeafstandzwemmen (lit. \\"long- distance swimming): distances up to 10 km. This category includes open water events. In this category there are the Open Nationale Kampioenschappen in 5 km and 10 km freestyle, with separate events for professionals and amateurs, and * Marathonzwemmen (lit. \\"marathon swimming\\"): distances over 10 km. The Nationale Kampioenschappen (national championships) in this category is a joint venture with neighbouring Belgium. Most events are in the long-distance category, with around 25 in the Netherlands. An approximately equal number are organised in Flanders in Belgium. The waterways of the Low Countries, therefore, are some of the busiest in open-water swimming in the world.

Its inheritance pattern is a system of partible inheritance, which bears resemblance to Salic patrimony: as such, it might testify in favour of a wider, probably ancient Germanic tradition. Under this law, land was divided equally among sons or other heirs. The word Gavelkind is thought to have originated from old Irish phrases 'Gabhaltas-cinne' or Gavail-kinne, which means family settlement. (Modern Gaelic 'gabhail-cine'.) Collectanea de Rebus Hibernicus, Volume 1 Over the centuries, various acts were passed to degavel individual manors but, in England and Wales, it was the Administration of Estates Act 1925 that finally abolished the custom.Elton. The tenures of Kent. ch. XVI ‚Äì Disgavelled Lands  Gavelkind in Kent Monument at Swanscombe recording the legend of how Kent managed to extract concessions from William the Conqueror. Before abolition of gavelkind tenure by the Administration of Estates Act 1925, all land in Kent was presumed to be held by gavelkind until the contrary was proved. It was more correctly described as socage tenure, subject to the custom of gavelkind. The chief peculiarities of the custom were the following: * A tenant could pass on part or all of his lands as a fiefdom from fifteen years of age. * On conviction for a felony, the lands were not subject to corruption of blood. * Generally the tenant could always dispose of his lands in his will. * In case of intestacy, the estate was passed on to all the sons, or their representatives, in equal shares, leaving all the sons equally a gentleman. Although females claiming in their own right were given second preference, they could still inherit through representation. * A dowager was entitled to one half of the land. * A widow who had no children was entitled to inherit half the estate, as a tenant, as long as she remained unmarried. Gavelkind, an example of customary law in England, was thought to have existed before the Norman Conquest of 1066, but generally was superseded by the feudal law of primogeniture. Its survival (until as late as 1925) in one part of the country, is regarded as a concession by William the Conqueror to the people of Kent.R. J. Smith, \\"The Swanscombe Legend and the Historiography of Kentish Gavelkind,\\" in Medievalism in the Modern World. Essays in Honour of Leslie J. Workman, ed. Richard Utz and Tom Shippey (Turnhout: Brepols, 1998), pp. 85‚Äì103. Gavelkind in Wales In Wales there was a custom of inheritance similar to that of gavelkind in England which, in Welsh, was known as '. Under Welsh common law on a landowner's death the land would be divided equally among all his sons, including illegitimate sons.Koch. Celtic Culture. Vol. 1. p. 11 The ultimately infinite division of ever smaller pieces of land by successive generations of sons has been blamed for the comparative weakness of the Welsh polity as opposed to the system of primogeniture in England where the entire patrimony was received intact by the eldest son. The Welsh historian Philip Yorke, writing in 1799, summarised the situation: The Laws in Wales Acts 1535‚Äì1542 saw the Welsh legal system being replaced with that of the English, and the law of gavelkind was replaced with that of primogeniture; however, as in England, the custom of gavelkind was not finally abolished until the Administration of Estates Act 1925. Gavelkind in Ireland In Ireland, gavelkind was a species of tribal succession, by which the land, instead of being divided at the death of the holder amongst his sons, was thrown again into the common stock, and redivided among the surviving members of the sept. Under Early Irish law land was divided at the death of the holder amongst his sons. The Normans gave this Irish inheritance law the name gavelkind due to its apparent similarity to Jute gavelkind inheritance in Kent.

The station has one of the longest radio histories in Canada. CFRC remains in operation at the present time and serves Queen's University and the greater Kingston community. The station broadcasts at 101.9 MHz, although for most of its past it operated at \\"1490 on the AM dial,\\" including a period during which it was simulcast on 1490 kHz AM and 91.9 MHz FM. CFRC-FM is a member of the National Campus and Community Radio Association. History A comprehensive oral history of the station was compiled by Arthur Zimmerman, which was broadcast on the station in 1982 and was published in book form in 1991. Radio technology has a surprisingly long history in Kingston, dating back to the early radio experimentations of Queen's first Professor of General Engineering, James Lester Willis Gill. He mounted the first public exhibition of wireless telegraphy at a Queen's Convocation lecture on April 28, 1902, only four months after Guglielmo Marconi's first successful trans-Atlantic transmission from Signal Hill. By the 1910s regular courses on wireless technology and theory were being taught by Gill, and Professor Gill set up the Queen's wireless telegraph sets at Barriefield war Camp in 1915 and contributed directly to the use of wireless and radio technologies by the Allied forces during World War I. An informal wireless club was formed by a group of Gill's students, who kept experimenting with the latest available wireless technology. With the help of Professor Douglas Jemmett an experimental station license (9BT) was obtained in the Spring of 1922. The station's equipment was housed in the basement (later moved to the second floor) of the Electrical Engineering building, Fleming Hall (named after Sir Sandford Fleming). It had a power output of approximately 250 watts, and had an estimated range of 160 kilometres. While there were likely some preliminary, unscheduled broadcasts by 9BT, the station's first scheduled public broadcast was on October 7, 1922, as Professor Richard O. Jolliffe called the football game between Queen's and McGill. (At that time, the University's football/rugby team, the Queen's Tricolour, were the winners of the Grey Cup for three consecutive years, and it is a common myth that when the current call letters CFRC were assigned, their meaning was \\"Canada's Famous Rugby Champions\\"; this acronym being possible, however, was purely coincidental). Some student broadcasters also said that CFRC meant \\"Crazy Fellows Raising Cain\\". An alumnus donation in early 1923 made possible the acquisition of better, more reliable transmitting equipment, and a private commercial licence was obtained under the call letters CFRC by July 1923. CFRC was Kingston's only radio station and began airing programs from the new Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission in 1934, becoming a full affiliate in 1936 in a commercial partnership with the Kingston Whig-Standard newspaper.Queen's University Archives - CFRC - history With the replacement of the CRBC with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 1936, CFRC became an affiliate. In 1938, in what was possibly the station's most notable broadcast, United States President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's convocation speech at the university was relayed by CFRC to all North American radio networks. CFRC remained a CBC station for several years however, with a weak signal and with commercial limitations placed on it by the university (such as a ban on advertising for patent medicine), the Whig-Standard sought its own station and, in 1942, launched CKWS AM 960 (now an FM station), at which time CKWS acquired CFRC's CBC affiliation and its commercial license. In exchange for CKWS carrying some programming from the university, CFRC agreed not to compete commercially with CKWS for ten years and to only engage in broadcasts that filled the university's educational mandate. The station reverted to an experimental outlet for the university's Electrical Engineering Department until 1945 when it resumed programming on a limited basis as part of the Summer Radio Institute - a training program for broadcasters run with the CBC - and thereafter broadcasting non-commercial radio plays by the Queen's Drama Guild. Since the station originally began broadcasting, CFRC periodically changed frequencies until it settled on 1490 AM on March 29, 1941. In 1954, CFRC-FM began broadcasting at 91.9 Megacycles on the FM dial to simulcast the programming of CFRC 1490. In 1957, the university appointed Margaret Angus as its first Director of Radio and students formed the CFRC Radio Club to produce programming and operate the station under her supervision as a fully fledged campus radio station. In 1986, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission approved Radio Queen's application to change CFRC-FM's frequency from 91.9 MHz to its current FM frequency, 101.9 MHz.Decision CRTC 86-436Decision CRTC 89-714 In 1990 the AM frequency went dark and all CFRC programming moved to the FM frequency (which had been broadcasting separate programming since 1970) and a new stereo transmitter. The station was for many years the only campus radio station in Canada to be owned and operated by a university rather than by its students. This changed in 2003 when ownership and management of the station was transferred from the university to the Alma Mater Society (Queen's student government). Due to changes in CRTC regulations, CFRC's ownership transitioned from 2012 to 2014 so that it became an autonomous service, no longer owned and operated by the AMS. As a registered non-profit corporation, CFRC 101.9 FM is owned and operated by Radio Queen's University. CFRC also hosts a podcasting network providing training and resources for independent podcast production.https://podcast.cfrc.ca/ CFRC Sports CFRC has for years provided regular coverage of all Queen's Golden Gaels regular season and playoff football games. Intermittently, they have also provided coverage of Golden Gaels hockey and basketball.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers, St. Louis Cardinals and Miami Marlins. With St. Louis, he won the 2011 World Series over the Texas Rangers. Early life Furcal grew up in Loma de Cabrera, a small village in the Dominican Republic near the Dajab√≥n River and border with Haiti. His father, Silvino, drove a taxi and his mother, Aura, was a schoolteacher. Furcal had three older brothers, Jos√©, Manuel and Lorenzo, and a sister. Silvino Furcal was a standout outfielder during an era when Dominican ballplayers did not get much recognition from Major League scouts. Silvino introduced his sons to baseball and Rafael credited his father with teaching him how to enjoy the game. Until his death in 2010, Silvino would often call Rafael to give him advice after games. Manuel Furcal pitched in the Seattle Mariners organization and Lorenzo played in the Oakland Athletics system before suffering career- ending injuries. Jos√© Furcal committed suicide in 1999 and Manuel died that same year in an accident. Furcal attended Jose Cabrera High School and was prepared to enroll in engineering school before being spotted by a scout at a tryout in Santo Domingo. He was subsequently signed as an amateur free agent by the Atlanta Braves on November 9, 1996, for $5,000. Professional career =Minor League Baseball= He began his professional career as a second baseman with the Gulf Coast Braves in 1997. The following season, with the Danville Braves he hit .328 and stole a league record 60 bases in only 66 games. He was named Danville's Player of the Year and Appalachian League All- Star Second Baseman. In 1999, he switched to shortstop and joined the Macon Braves in \\"A\\" ball and hit .337 with 73 stolen bases in 83 games. He was transferred to the advanced \\"A\\" team in Myrtle Beach and hit .293 for them with 23 steals in 43 games. He led all of minor league baseball with 96 steals total. He was named to Baseball America's first team All-Star team and the South Atlantic League All-Star team. In addition, he was the Braves Minor League Player of the Year, the South Atlantic League Most Outstanding Prospect and a Class A All-Star. =Atlanta Braves= An injury to Braves shortstop Walt Weiss prior to the season led to Furcal improbably making the jump from \\"A\\" ball to the Major League roster. He made his Major League debut on April 4, 2000, against the Colorado Rockies, getting 2 hits in 4 at-bats. His first hit was against Rockies pitcher Rolando Arrojo. Furcal went on to hit .295 with 40 stolen bases for the Braves and won the National League Rookie of the Year Award that year. He missed most of the 2001 season because of a dislocated left shoulder, suffered while stealing second base in a July 6 game at Boston. The Braves learned Furcal's true age, then 23, at the start of the 2002 season. Before then, he had claimed he was only 21. He returned to the starting lineup that season and tied a modern Major League record with three triples in a game on April 21 against Florida. Furcal completed an unassisted triple play for the Braves against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 10, 2003. It was the 12th in baseball history. In the fifth inning, the shortstop caught pitcher Woody Williams' liner with the runners moving in a hit and run attempt, stepped on second base to retire catcher Mike Matheny (who later became Furcal's manager in St. Louis) and tagged Orlando Palmeiro before he could return to first. He was selected to the National League All-Star Team as a reserve in 2003. In September 2004, during his final season with the Braves, he was arrested for drunk driving, violating his probation dating from an earlier drunk driving arrest in June 2000. Furcal was ordered to serve 21 days in jail. In an unusual arrangement, the beginning of the jail term was contingent upon the Braves' situation on the playoffs. Once the Braves were eliminated from post-season action, Furcal served his time. =Los Angeles Dodgers= White Sox first baseman Paul Konerko during spring training action, 2008. On December 7, 2005, Furcal signed a free agent contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers for three years and $39 million. In September Furcal was selected as the inaugural winner of the Roy Campanella Award, given to the Dodgers player who best exemplifies the spirit and leadership of the late Hall of Fame catcher. The award was voted on by only his teammates. In May 2007, he became one of only five Major League players to get 4 hits in each of 3 consecutive games. Furcal with the Dodgers in 2009. Early in 2008, he suffered a back injury that kept him sidelined for most of the season, not returning until right before the playoffs started. In the fifth inning of Game Five the 2008 National League Championship Series against the Philadelphia Phillies, Furcal made three errors to set records for most errors in one NLCS inning and game. He was just the second player to make three errors in one postseason inning. No shortstop had made three errors in one playoff game since Buck Weaver in the 1917 World Series. Two of the errors came on the same play as Furcal booted a routine groundball hit by Pat Burrell and then airmailed his throw behind home plate in a failed attempt to prevent Chase Utley from scoring.Dodgers undone by poor fundamentals MLB.com On December 19, 2008, after speculation that he would re-sign with the Braves as a free agent, Furcal signed a 3-year $30 million contract to stay with the Dodgers. Furcal struggled in the first year of his new contract, hitting only .269 for the Dodgers in 2009. His on-base plus slugging of .711 was also below his career average of .757. Furcal was added to the 2010 National League All-Star team as a reserve after New York Mets shortstop Jos√© Reyes suffered an injury and was forced to withdraw. Furcal walked in his only plate appearance in the game. Due to injuries he only appeared in 97 games for the Dodgers in 2010, but finished with a .300 batting average and stole 22 bases. In 2011, he spent more time on the disabled list than the active roster for the Dodgers, appearing in just 37 games, during which he hit only .197. =St. Louis Cardinals= Furcal during the 2011 World Series Parade Furcal was traded along with cash considerations to the St. Louis Cardinals on July 30, 2011 for Double-A outfielder Alex Castellanos. In 50 games with the Cardinals, he hit .255 with 7 home runs. In the 2011 World Series, he only hit .179 but picked up his only World Series ring when the Cards won the series by beating the Texas Rangers in seven games.Cardinals get Furcal in another 'win-now' deal MLB.com On October 31, 2011, the St. Louis Cardinals declined his $12 million option for 2012. The club signed Furcal to a 2-year, $14 million deal on December 10, 2011. During the 2012 season Furcal was batting .264 with five home runs and 49 RBIs until being sidelined with an elbow injury on August 30. An MRI of the elbow revealed damage to a ligament in his throwing arm. Furcal would be placed on the disabled list for the remainder of the season in order to undergo four to six weeks of physical rehabilitation in the hopes of forestalling surgical repair. As a replacement for Furcal, the Cardinals called up Pete Kozma from the Triple-A affiliate Memphis Redbirds. On March 7, 2013 the Cardinals announced that Furcal would undergo Tommy John surgery and would almost certainly miss all of the 2013 baseball season. An off-season program of rest and rehabilitation for his damaged right elbow at first appeared to be successful, as Furcal reported for Cardinals spring training. However a bone spur began to cause discomfort prompting an MRI and examination by Cardinals team radiologist Greg Cizek on March 4, 2013, who recommended surgery. A second opinion from noted surgeon Dr. James Andrews confirmed the diagnosis on March 6, 2013. He became a free agent after the 2013 World Series on October 31, 2013. =Miami Marlins= On December 6, 2013, Furcal signed a one-year deal with the Miami Marlins. With the younger Adeiny Hechavarria at shortstop, Furcal was projected to play second base with the Marlins. He made his Marlins debut on June 13, 2014, against the Pittsburgh Pirates. =Kansas City Royals= On March 17, 2015, Furcal signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals. He was released on March 31 and then re-signed the following day to another minor league contract. He played just seven games in the minors for the Wilmington Blue Rocks and Northwest Arkansas Naturals, hitting .240. On May 19, he announced his retirement. Personal life During the offseason, Furcal played for the Aguilas Cibae√±as. He resides in Santiago, Dominican Republic with his family. Furcal met his wife, Glenny, during his final spring training with the Braves and the couple has two sons together, Rafael Jr. (born in 2006) and Anthony (born in 2008). Furcal also has a daughter named Ashley (born in 2004) from a previous relationship. Furcal has used his baseball earnings to give back to his hometown. When Furcal re-signed with the Dodgers in 2008, he arranged to have the Los Angeles Fire Department donate a fire truck to Loma de Cabrera which, until then, did not have a fire department. He has also arranged to pay the hospital bills of Loma de Cabrera residents. Furcal's father, Silvino, died on Father's Day in 2010 after being kicked by a horse on the family's farm. Furcal was considered for election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame for the first time in 2020.

The town, named after the nearby Blind River, celebrated its centennial in 2006. History French explorers discovered the North Channel and made it a renowned voyageur route. Fur traders, loggers and miners followed to seek natural resources. A fur trading post was established by the North West Company in 1789 at the mouth of the Mississagi River. When the fur trade slowed about 1820, the Hudson's Bay Company purchased the North West Company. A number of trappers settled along the rivers flowing into Lake Huron. One of the rivers, just three miles (5 km) east of the Mississagi mouth, was called Penewobecong, which translates to \\"smooth rock or sloping\\". The voyageurs named the river the Blind River because the mouth was not easily visible along the canoe route. The name Blind River was adopted by the settlement that grew at the mouth of the river. Blind River's post office was established in 1877. The Canadian Pacific Railway station in Blind River, Ontario, 1910. The logging industry developed because of the accessibility of timber along the Blind River and Mississagi watersheds. The industry was spurred by a copper discovery in the mid-19th century in Bruce Mines. The first sawmill was built beside the mouth of the Blind River at the current site of the Old Mill Motel. The protected estuary of the east arm of the Blind River as well as the deep water offshore offered a good location for the mill. The sawmill provided timber and planks for the copper mine. The Canadian Pacific Railway arrived in Blind River in 1888 when its Algoma Branch was extended westward from Algoma Mills to Sault Ste. Marie. By 1906, when Blind River had been incorporated as a town, a second larger sawmill had been erected on the west arm of the Blind River. Today the west arm is the location of the Blind River Marine Park. In 1929, the Carpenter Hixon Company built a state-of-the-art pine sawmill producing 89 million board feet of lumber in its first year. Through boom and bust the mill survived under the name McFadden Lumber Company for over forty years as the largest white pine sawmill east of the Rocky Mountains, with an annual capacity of 120,000,000 board feet (280,000 m¬≥) of lumber, an output never reached in actual production.. The Great Mississagi Fire of 1948Michael Commito, \\" 'The Biggest, Blackest Graveyard': A Socioeconomic History of the Mississagi Fire and Salvage, 1948-1973\\" Masters Thesis, Laurentian University, 2010. led to a depletion of timber, difficult economic conditions and the eventual closing of the mill in 1969. The lumber history is commemorated in the Timber Village Museum. In 1955, uranium was discovered near Blind River. The first uranium mine began operation as the Pronto Mine in Algoma Mills. Although its life was short-lived, its significance was that it led to the discovery of the entire Blind River-Elliot Lake uranium mining camp. In 1983 a uranium refinery was built just west of Blind River. This uranium refinery is owned and operated by the Cameco Corporation, which processes uranium concentrates from all over the world into uranium trioxide. The town of Blind River made headlines in 1991 for a double murder that occurred at the local rest stop off the Trans-Canada Highway. On June 28, 1991, an unknown assailant shot an elderly couple from Lindsay, Ontario, Gord McAllister, 62, and his wife Jackie, 59, and 29-year- old Brian Major. The killer gained entry into the McAllisters' motor home by posing as a police officer. Jackie McAllister and Brian Major died of their wounds. The case was profiled in 1993 on NBC-TV's Unsolved Mysteries. No one has ever been charged in the murders, but a suspect, Ronald Glenn West (a former Toronto police officer convicted of two rape-murders in Toronto in 1970 for which he is currently serving two life sentences, and of a series of robbery-assaults in Sault Ste. Marie in 1995), remains under suspicion. Gord McAllister died on February 14, 2012. Until 1997, Blind River had its own radio station, CJNR-AM 730. In 1997, the station was absorbed into the new CKNR-FM, based in Elliot Lake.

Transportation links are Highway 17 (part of the Trans-Canada Highway), the Huron Central Railway operating on the leased Canadian Pacific Railway line that runs through the town, and the Blind River Marine Park, a town-owned marina servicing pleasure craft. A 1991 study by the Ontario Ministry of Transportation proposed the extension of Highway 555 (Granary Lake Road) from Blind River to meet Spine Road in Elliot Lake, creating a new route which would reduce the length of a commute between the two communities by approximately 20 kilometres.\\"Council considers old idea for new road\\" . Elliot Lake Standard, August 5, 2015. Although the ministry has announced no firm plans to construct the proposed road, Elliot Lake City Council passed a motion in August 2015 calling for the project's revival on the grounds that it would provide significant economic benefit to both communities. The town also provides services to the surrounding communities through its District Health Centre, two high schools (W.C. Eaket Secondary School and √âcole secondaire catholique Jeunesse-Nord) and three elementary schools (Blind River Public School, St. Mary's Catholic School and the French-language √âcole Catholique St-Joseph).

He was also the winning pitcher in the first ever Major League Baseball game played west of Kansas City. In his homeland, G√≥mez was nicknamed El Divino Loco (\\"The Divine Madman\\"), on account of his willingness to pitch in tough situations and #22.https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/7d94a891 Major league career G√≥mez (birth name: Rub√©n G√≥mez Col√≥nG√≥mez's birth name follows Spanish naming customs: the first or paternal family name is \\"G√≥mez\\" and the second or maternal family name is \\"Col√≥n\\".) was born in Arroyo, Puerto Rico. He debuted with the New York Giants on April 17, 1953. He finished his rookie season with a 13‚Äì11 record. G√≥mez created some controversy when, on the order of Giants' manager Leo Durocher, he hit Brooklyn Dodgers player Carl Furillo with a pitch. G√≥mez would hit other notables with pitches in his career, including Joe Adcock and Frank Robinson.Puerto Rico Herald After going 17‚Äì9 in his second season, G√≥mez pitched and won Game 3 of the 1954 World Series in the Giants sweep of the Cleveland Indians. He thus became the first Puerto Rican player to be a member of a World Series championship team, becoming a hero in his native country (schools closed the day he pitched in the World Series so the kids could watch the game).Life In Legacy - Week of July 31, 2004 When G√≥mez returned to Puerto Rico, he was greeted by thousands of fans at the San Juan airport and a holiday was declared. After the 1957 season, the Dodgers and Giants moved to Los Angeles and San Francisco, respectively. On April 15, 1958, G√≥mez made baseball history when he pitched an 8‚Äì0 shutout against the Dodgers at San Francisco's Seals Stadium in the first Major League Baseball game played on the West Coast. He thus became the first pitcher to win a game played on the West Coast; the losing pitcher was future Hall of Famer Don Drysdale.Philadelphia Athletics Historical Society In 1958, G√≥mez was traded to the Phillies. In the 1959 season he was only 3‚Äì8 in 72 innings, and went 0‚Äì3 in 1960. He was out of the major leagues in 1961 and returned in 1962 to pitch for both the Indians and the Twins, compiling a combined 2‚Äì3 record. Five years later he returned to finish his major league career with innings for the Phillies. Other professional leagues G√≥mez later went to the Mexican League, where he pitched with Veracruz, Mexico. One day a young boy begged G√≥mez to buy a lottery ticket that he was selling to make some badly needed money. The boy insisted that G√≥mez buy the ticket because his uniform number matched that of the ticket, and G√≥mez, who did not normally buy such tickets, agreed. To his great surprise the ticket was a winner of a $35,000 prize. G√≥mez attempted to share the money with the boy's family and when they refused, he went to a local bank and set up a trust fund for the lad, to be given to him at age 18. In 1967, G√≥mez was 39 years old and still playing with Veracruz, when the Phillies gave him another shot. He pitched only innings that season in seven games, making his last appearance on May 2, 1967. Between 1947 and 1977, G√≥mez played 28 winter seasons with the Cangrejeros de Santurce and Vaqueros de Bayam√≥n of the Puerto Rican league, setting league marks for a pitcher in wins (174) and ERA (2.97).

In 1942 she married her second husband, a banker, Giannis Kostopoulos; the couple divorced in 1946. She married her third and final husband, Giorgos Lafazanis, on 18 September 1967. They remained wed until her death in 2004. Vlahopoulou had no children by any of her marriages. She left Finos Film in 1966 and moved to Karagiannis- Karatzopoulos. From 1972, she continued to star in films for the next seven years. In 1992‚Äì93, she starred in the musical comedy Gia Tin Ellada Re Gamo To (ŒìŒπŒ± œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥Œ± œÅŒµ Œ≥Œ±Œºœé œÑŒø), after which she retired.

(CV) was an early pioneer in Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing (CAD/CAM). Computervision was founded in 1969 by Marty Allen and Philippe Villers, and headquartered in Bedford, Massachusetts, United States. Its early products were built on a Data General Nova platform. Starting around 1975, Computervision built its own \\"CGP\\" (Computervision Graphics Processor) Nova-compatible 16-bit computers with added instructions optimized for graphics applications and using its own operating system known as Computervision Graphic Operating System (CGOS). In the 1980s, Computervision rewrote their code to operate on Unix-based platforms. Computervision was acquired by Prime Computer in 1988 for $434 million. Prime subsequently adopted the Computervision name. In 1998 Parametric Technology Corporation acquired Computervision.PTC History CADDS product history A Computervision Inc. CADDS3 system being used to create a piping and instrumentation diagram in a training lab, circa 1979. Computervision's headquarters were at 201 Burlington Road in Bedford, Massachusetts Computervision's first product, CADDS-1, was aimed at the printed circuit board layout and 2-D drafting markets. CADDS stood for Computervison Automated Design and Drafting System. The CADDS-1 system featured a combination digitizer and plotter mounted on a large drafting table. Integrated circuit layout was added with the CADDS-2 product, which had a dedicated operating system and a 16-bit graphic database. When this proved insufficient resolution for VLSI (very large scale integration), the company developed CADDS-2/VLSI in the late 1970s. CADDS-2/VLSI included a new operating system, a 32-bit database, and user expandability through a dedicated programming language called ICPL (integrated circuit programming language), which was a dialect of BASIC, based on an interpreter licensed from Fairchild Semiconductor. The original CADDS-2 ran on Data General Nova 1200 computers. CADDS-2/VLSI ran on Computervision's own hardware/software which was a modified Data General Nova with a modified version of DG's RDOS operating system. CADDS3 was introduced in the late 1970s on the CGP80 and CGP100 using Tektronix storage tube vector devices as display terminals and graphics tablets with menus for operator input. CADDS3 was written in Fortran and based on software developed by Patrick Hanratty and acquired from S3 Corporation around 1973. In 1975, Computervision introduced an improved database that allowed additional entities and data types to be introduced easily. Other improvements, including a B-spline package and improved refresh performance led to adoption by many large customers, including Boeing, which purchased dozens of systems for the 757/767 aircraft program. Improved 3-D design was added in the early 1980s with the CADDS4 product on the CGP200. This version of CADDS moved display technology from storage tube base displays to raster graphics and introduced the dedicated graphics co-processor board known as the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). With CADDS4 Tailored packages were available for CAD drafting, CAM (computer-aided manufacturing), 3-D modeling, piping and plant design, printed circuit board layout, instrument panel design, and many other applications. During this period, they also contributed to the development of the IGES standard for CAD/CAM data exchange, along with Applicon and other competitors. The major breakthrough in 3-D Design was with the CADDS4X on the CGP200X running CGOS200X. This version of the operating system and hardware improved memory management (not true virtual memory) and increased program size. In 1984 a cluster of CGP200X with a proprietary 32-bit processor Analytic Processing Unit (APU) was offered as the Computervision Distributed System (CDS) 4000. The APU was sometimes called \\"All Paws Up\\". CADDS production continued into the twenty-first century. As of 2019, CADDS (now at version CADDS5) was offered as a CAD/CAM system specialized for shipbuilding. MEDUSA product history In 1983 Computervision purchased Cambridge Interactive Systems (CIS), founded by British computer scientist Dr. Dick Newell and Tom Sancha. Computervision was interested in obtaining some of the state-of-the-art technology of the MEDUSA CAD system the Cambridge company had developed. CIS had a partnership with Prime Computer which maintained its option on the MEDUSA source code. At the time, MEDUSA was available on the then newly released 32-bit so-called super mini computers, whose most prominent distributors were Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) (with their VAX hardware) and Prime Computer. In 1984 there was a fork in MEDUSA as Prime took its option to keep developing MEDUSA. This in effect created two different versions of MEDUSA: CIS MEDUSA (owned by Computervision, which ran on Prime, Sun and VAX workstations) and Prime MEDUSA (which only ran on Prime computers). The two versions had a slightly different file format and the development language was developed in slightly different directions. The split in MEDUSA development was merged when Prime Computers acquired Computervision, with the promise to CV customers that VAX and Sun users would not be forced to switch to Prime workstations. Prime was divided into the two main divisions: Prime Hardware, which was responsible for the proprietary computer hardware, and Prime Computervision, which was responsible for the CAD/CAM business with MEDUSA and CADDS. With falling hardware sales Prime eventually stopped production of PRIMOS computers and transferred its maintenance obligations to another company, thus being able to concentrate on the CAD/CAM software business. The company was renamed from Prime Computervision to Computervision (CV). Hardware In 1985, CV introduced an IBM 4361-based mainframe known as the CDS5000 to support Product Data Manager (PDM). This system never ran any graphics software but instead was used to manage the large number of product files and data that users were generating. The CDS5000 was networked with CDS4000 and CGP200X systems using serial links. Computervision CADDS system exhibited at a trade show in 1978. Computervision was crucial to Sun Microsystems development as a company. CV was Sun's first large customer for Unix-based workstations. The CDS3000 series of workstations were actually Sun-2 systems with additional graphics hardware from CV. Ultimately in 1987, CV migrated from the CGP systems to Sun-3-based workstations known as CADDStations with a VME bus version of the GPU. Computervision merged with Prime Computer in 1988 and acquired GE Calma (its major competitor in the microelectronic CAD market) in 1989. Computervision was acquired by Parametric Technology Corporation (PTC) in 1998, which (as of 2013) still produces the CADDS5 product, although only as a CAD/CAM product specialized for shipbuilding. In 2001, PTC sold the MEDUSA and MPDS Plant Design System software rights to CAD Schroer, which has developed a Fourth Generation of each system. Customers One of the first major customers in the UK for ComputerVision were the construction company John Laing PLC. \\"In 1975 John Laing purchased a ComputerVision CADDS3 computer aided design and drafting system to carry out investigations into the use of CAD in the construction engineering and building environment\\" - Mervyn Richards, Laing Technology Group (Thomas Telford Press, Institute of Civil Engineers, Conference - ) Laing Design Partners, a division of John Laing, had for some time been sponsoring work at Imperial University on the use of CAD in construction in the early 1970s and this led to Laing choosing the ComputerVision platform. At this time, Laing became the first CAD user in the UK Civil Engineering and Construction industry and were instrumental in developing and promoting the use of Computers in Construction. Mervyn Richards, responsible for this initiative later became one of the industries leading experts in Computer Aided Design, Modeling and construction IT (see the BS1192 specification). His work with CADDS3, ComputerVision and Elstree Computing Limited lead to the development and distribution of many software tools for ComputerVision platforms, promoting their use and popularising the platform for many years - right up to CADDS5. The Queen Alia Airport, by example, was a classic project to which these systems were used (by John Laing PLC). The first higher educational user of Computervision equipment was State University of New York College of Technology at Alfred, New York which acquired a CADDS3 system in 1979 with the help of a NSF grant and generous donation of equipment by Computervision employees Virgil Ross, Drew Davis and Bob Gothie. Alfred State graduated their first AAS Computer Graphics Engineering Technology (TAC/ABET) Graduates in 1983 with Martin Allen as the featured graduation speaker. The first graduating class of 18 students had over 75 job offers, launching a 20-year history of unparalleled placement success. One of the numerous \\"firsts\\" that was spun off the Alfred State program was a joint project with the New York State Department of Transportation, Region 6, to design highways and bridges and associated structures in 3-D CADDs which resulted in New York State being one of the first to use CADDS for highway design. In 1981 the United States Navy awarded an ‚Äúindefinite quantity, indefinite delivery contract valued at $63,000,000 for Designer V hardware, CADDS4 software, services, and training. Primarily used by the Navy Laboratories, in the 1985 time frame, CADDS was adopted by the Navy shipyards to support waterfront activities, and the Naval Sea Systems Command to support contract ship design. As of 2013, CADDS (by then CADDS5) continued in production as a CAD/CAM product specialized for shipbuilding.

Originally independent, the company was known best for supplying surplus optics and other items via its mail order catalog and factory store. History In 1942, amateur photographer Norman W. Edmund (1916 - 2012) found it hard to find lenses he needed for his hobby. This led him to advertise lenses for sale in photography magazines. It was so successful he founded \\"'Edmund Salvage Corporation'\\". It soon changed its name to Edmund Scientific and made its name with ads in publications like Scientific American as a supplier of chipped lenses, war- surplus optics, and low cost scientific gadgetry. Its advertisements caught the attention of hobbyists, amateur astronomers, high school students, and cash-strapped researchers. =War surplus= An Edmund lens envelope. An Edmund chipped lens. Edmund Scientific was part of the post-World War II \\"war surplus\\" phenomenon, when the U.S. government sold off large quantities of materials. \\"Army and Navy Stores\\" were a national phenomenon and originally sold military-surplus clothing. Surplus electronics found an outlet in dozens of shops, in New York City's \\"Radio Row\\" and elsewhere. A few issued catalogs and developed national mail-order businesses. Edmund was, however, the only widely known supplier of surplus optics. The core of Edmund's offerings was surplus lenses. These were single-element lenses, shipped in coin envelopes, with the approximate diameter and focal length stenciled on them. Reflecting their salvage and surplus origins, available diameters and focal lengths did not fall into regular progressions. Edmund published crudely printed, stapled \\"books\\" describing experiments that could be performed with their lenses, and plans for building telescopes and other optical equipment. Edmund also sold lens \\"kits\\". The 10-lens kit cost less than US$10 and included a booklet of plans for instruments which could supposedly be built with them. Unlike Heathkits, which were absolutely complete kits requiring only soldering and assembly, Edmund's \\"kits\\" consisted of only the lenses. A great deal of skill and effort was still needed to fashion the telescopes, microscopes, or opaque projectors described. With single-element lenses, the quality of the resulting optics was not high. Edmund even sold high-quality, thick, black cardboard tubes needed for many of the projects. =Heyday= Edmund Scientific's factory store in Barrington, New Jersey in the mid-1970s which carried many items not listed in the catalogs. Following Sputnik, Edmund was able to capitalize on a growing national interest in science and astronomy. They expanded their business into a full line of telescopes and telescope kits as well as equipment, parts, and supplies for other scientific fields such as physics, optics, chemistry, microscopy, electronics, and meteorology. They continued to grow as a supplier to teachers and schools with demonstration devices and kits which covered most fields of science. Edmund's catalog became a source for optical and mechanical parts essential to amateur telescope making, including hard-to-find items such as optical glass blanks, pitch-lap ingredients, and a series of grit abrasives for grinding and polishing astronomical objective mirrors by hand. A compilation of Edmund's earlier pamphlets published as the book \\"All About Telescopes\\" offered many designs for telescopes of all sizes and configurations, which directed the builder to the relative Edmund catalog part numbers needed for each design. The \\"Factory Store\\" in Barrington, New Jersey also had a number of bins and shelves full of rare surplus items which never made it into the catalogs. Edmund's catered to the 1960s generation by expanding and highlighting their line of projectors, color wheels, black lights, filters, and other optical devices which could be used by rock bands and in psychedelic light shows. Other items catering to the counterculture were eventually added to the catalog covering the fields of Biofeedback, ESP, Kirlian photography, Pyramid power, and alternative energy. In 1971, in the Whole Earth Catalog of items \\"relevant to independent education\\", Stewart Brand noted: > \\"Edmund is the best source we know of for low-cost scientific gadgetry > (including math and optics gear). [In this category,] many of the items we > found independently... turned up in the Edmund catalog, so we were obliged > to recommend that in this area we've been precluded.\\" Some sources claim that certain of the original polyhedral dice used in the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game system were obtained from Edmund Scientific.Contrarian (2008-03-05).

Retrieved on 2016-03-05 from https://forum.rpg.net/archive/index.php/t-382854.html. =Restructuring= In the 1970s, as the viability of Edmund's business model waned, Norman Edmund's son Robert Edmund refashioned the business into two new ones, Edmund Scientifics and Edmund Optics. Edmund Scientifics marketed to consumers and specialized in science-themed toys, vaguely high-tech household gadgets, and \\"science gifts.\\" Edmund Optics did not have a public showroom like Edmund Scientifics, although the two organizations shared the same building. The large back room of Edmund Scientifics still sold military surplus from World War II and other wars well into the 1980s and into the mid-1990s. Some of the items in the surplus room were from German and other non-American militaries. None of these items were in the mail-order catalogs. They also sold other surplus wares of interest to hobbyists, including specialized motors and other miscellaneous electronics, parts from toys, and other household items. In line with their focus on optics, Edmund Scientifics's entrance vestibule housed a pale-blue working World War II Japanese submarine periscope. Children were often drawn to this periscope. Drawing on the periscope's popularity, sometime in the 1970s a hall of mirrors, complete with black lights, was installed toward the rear of the building. =Acquisition= In 2000 Edmund Scientific was purchased by Science Kit and Boreal Laboratories, a western New York based science supply company. Science Kit and Boreal Laboratories is part of a group of companies that provide science supplies to elementary, middle, and high schools, as well as colleges and universities. This group falls under the unofficial umbrella \\"VWR Education\\", and its constituent enterprises are owned by VWR International, a multi-national conglomerate with offices in India, China, Europe, Canada, and the United States. They are no longer affiliated with Edmund Optics Inc. Beginning in 2000, Edmund Optics offered a variety of experimental grade and stock clearance items via a print catalog and online under a separate business named Anchor Optics, but this operation ceased in 2016, and the current Anchor Optics web site now redirects to a page at Edmund Optics listing clearance items. In 2001, the Barrington, New Jersey, store closed after Edmund Scientific was acquired by Science Kit and Boreal Laboratories. As of 2009, online sales made up the bulk of Edmund Scientific's revenues. The company was still selling telescopes (including an updated version of their Astroscan Telescope), microscopes (mostly they have carried the Boreal brand, manufactured for their parent company Science Kit LLC), surplus optics, magnets, and Fresnel lenses. They continued to sell many of their old favorites along with new items such as the Impossiball and hand boilers as well as other science-themed toys, novelty items, gifts, and gadgets. As of 2017, Edmund Optics continued to offer brand-new stock optics, as well as offering custom and specialized optics to corporations and higher education institutions.  In popular culture  Edmund Scientific has provided items used in television shows such as House, MythBusters, 24, Modern Marvels, and motion pictures such as Star Trek, and the 1975 version of Escape to Witch Mountain.

The scene, under construction since the 1950s and with parts dating back earlier, was inspired by detailed research into the architecture and landscape of the vale, with some models of cottages taking hundreds of hours to complete. It was founded by the late Roye England, (an anglophile Australian who lived in England), and run jointly by the late English Model Maker, Guy Williams, (who made fifty-seven of the museum's ninety railways). They can be seen working together in the 1958 British Path√© short, 'Hair Thatching'. The museum is run by a group of volunteers and is open to the public most weekends and holidays, except during the winter. History The museum was founded by the artist and craftsman Roye England, who was interested in model railways. He observed the destruction and modification of many historic buildings in the area and began to make model representations of them. Both the main Vale scene and others display working scale model railway scale models of typical scenes on the Great Western Railway (GWR) of the 1920s. The trains are also representative in detail of those travelling that line in those years. It is not a 'model railway layout' in its usual sense as the trains run at scale speed with a realistic interval between each. Displays =Vale of White Horse= The main display and ongoing project at Pendon is a scale representation of the Vale of White Horse as it was in the inter-war period. The scene is centred on the 'typical' village of Pendon Parva, which is served by a railway station on the main London to Bristol GWR main line that runs through the Vale, and another on the M&SWJR; that became one of the constituent companies of the GWR in 1923. The topography and the village layout is fictional, but every building and significant feature is an exact model of a real building from the Vale of White Horse. Some locos on the layout: *GWR 2900 Class No. 2943 Hampton Court Built in 1912. *GWR 4000 Class No. 4050 Princess Alice Built in 1914. *GWR 2251 Class No. 2253 Built in 1930. *LSWR N15 Class No. 789 Sir Guy Built in 1925. *GWR 3700 Class No. 3705 Mauritius *LSWR S15 class No. 515 Built in 1921. =Dartmoor branch= On the ground floor of the museum, a model representing a Great Western Railway branch line on Dartmoor, originally built in 1955 to showcase the trains being built for the Vale scene, is operated for visitors. The main focus of the Dartmoor scene is a model of Brunel's timber viaduct at Walkham in Devon built by R. Guy Williams, who also built many of the model locomotives at the museum. Locos on the layout include: *GWR 2900 Class No. 2921 Saint Dunstan Built in 1907. *GWR 2800 Class No. 2844 Built in 1912. *LSWR M7 Class No. 30 Built in 1904 =Madder Valley= The museum includes displays of individual models, modelling methods and railway artefacts. The museum also displays Madder Valley, a pioneering model railway built by John Ahern. Models The model trains are hand built, to represent individual locomotives, carriages, and wagons as exactly possible, based on surviving records and photographs. Operation consists of a sequence of trains, showing what one could have seen passing by on a summer day and night, in the mid-1920s. This sequence is based on timetables of the period. They are all modelled in 4 mm to 1 foot scale (1:76), and run on track of 18mm gauge, a combination known as EM gauge.

Wagner Jr. served three terms as the mayor of New York City, from 1954 through 1965. When running for his third term, he broke with the Tammany Hall leadership, ending the reign of clubhouse bosses in city politics. Life and early career Wagner was born in the Manhattan borough of New York City, the son of Margaret Marie (McTague) and German-born United States Senator Robert Ferdinand Wagner. He attended Taft School and graduated from Yale University in 1933, where he was on the business staff of campus humor magazine The Yale RecordYale Banner & Pot Pourri. New Haven: Yale University Press. 1932. p. 182. and became a member of Scroll and Key (as was John Lindsay, his successor as mayor). He attended Harvard Business School and the Graduate School of International Studies in Geneva. He graduated from Yale Law School in 1937. In 1942, he was the Exalted Ruler of New York Lodge No. 1 of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. A residential building is named after him on the Stony Brook University campus. Wagner was a member of the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 16th D.) in 1938, 1939‚Äì40 and 1941‚Äì42. He resigned his seat on January 13, 1942, and joined the Army Air Corps to fight in World War II. After the war he served as City Tax Commissioner, Commissioner of Housing and Buildings, and Chairman of the City Planning Commission. He was Borough President of Manhattan from 1950 to 1953. He also served as delegate to numerous Democratic conventions, and was the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate in 1956. Mayor His nomination and election as New York City mayor in 1953 caused a rift in the Democratic Party, and instigated a long-standing feud between Eleanor Roosevelt and Carmine DeSapio, Boss of Tammany Hall. Mrs. Roosevelt was a Wagner supporter, and DeSapio offered only reluctant support to Wagner until 1961, when Wagner ran for a third term on an anti-Tammany platform, which eventually helped end DeSapio's leadership. During Wagner's tenure as New York City's mayor, he built public housing and schools, created the City University of New York system, established the right of collective bargaining for city employees, and barred housing discrimination based on race, creed or color. He was the first mayor to hire significant numbers of people of color in city government. His administration also saw the development of the Lincoln Center and brought Shakespeare to Central Park. In the fall of 1957 after the Dodgers and Giants left New York City he appointed a commission to determine whether New York City could host another National League baseball team, eventually leading to the Mets franchise being awarded to New York City. During his years in office, the city experienced the visit of a number of notables from around the world. In January, 1957, President Eisenhower invited King Saud to the United States to discuss strategies for resolving the Suez crisis. Wagner refused Eisenhower's request of a ticker tape parade for the King and even went so far as to refuse to formally greet him, stating that the Muslim ruler was anti- Jewish and anti-Catholic, all of which was \\"a crude appeal to the prejudices of the hyphenated voters.\\" * Bailey, Thomas A (1980). A Diplomatic History of the American People, Prentice-Hall, Inc. , pp. 5. He did greet Queen Elizabeth II later in 1957. In 1956, he ran on the Democratic and Liberal tickets for U.S. Senator from New York, but was defeated by Republican Jacob K. Javits. Like his father, Wagner was aligned with Tammany Hall for much of his career. However, when he sought a third term in 1961 Wagner broke with Carmine DeSapio and won the Democratic primary anyway, despite a challenge from Tammany's candidate Arthur Levitt Sr. A Democratic Mayor not aligned with Tammany was a new development and marked a milestone in the decline of traditional clubhouse or machine politics in New York City. Wagner was mayor at the time of the controversial demolition of the original Penn Station, which began on October 28, 1963. In 1965, he signed the law that created the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. In February 1962, Wagner quit the New York Athletic Club because it barred African Americans and Jews from becoming members. By the early 1960s, a campaign to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor Wagner, who was concerned about the image of the city in preparation for the 1964 World's Fair. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible.* Carter, David (2004). Stonewall: The Riots that Sparked the Gay Revolution, St. Martin's Press. , pp. 29‚Äì37. In 1965, Wagner decided not to run for a fourth term as mayor. Four years later, however, he ran for mayor again, but lost the Democratic primary. In 1973, he talked with the city's five Republican county chairmen about running for Mayor as a Republican, but these negotiations collapsed. Ambassador After deciding not to run for a fourth term in 1965, Wagner served as ambassador to Spain from 1968 to 1969. In that year, he decided to run for a fourth term but was soundly beaten by Mario Procaccino in the Democratic primary. He also made a brief run four years later, but withdrew before the primary took place. In 1978 he was appointed by Jimmy Carter to be his representative to the Vatican, where the College of Cardinals had recently elected John Paul II. Personal life Wagner was a Roman Catholic. Wagner's first wife was Susan Edwards, by whom he had two sons, Robert Ferdinand Wagner III and Duncan. Susan Wagner died of lung cancer in 1964. By all accounts, the two had a very happy marriage, and although Susan was not particularly fond of politics, she enjoyed traveling with her husband and meeting many famous people. Susan was described as optimistic, cheerful, kind, and always happy. According to his friends, Mayor Wagner was \\"lonely and depressed\\" after the death of his first wife. He married Barbara Cavanagh in 1965. They divorced in 1971. Wagner married Phyllis Fraser, widow of Bennett Cerf, in 1975. They lived together until his death in 1991. Her five-floor townhouse at 132 East 62nd Street, designed by Denning & Fourcade, \\"was so magnetic that the statesman moved in.\\" Death and legacy He died in Manhattan of heart failure in 1991, aged 80 while he was being treated for bladder cancer. His funeral mass was offered by Cardinal William Wakefield Baum at St. Patrick's Cathedral, and he was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Maspeth, Queens. \\"Mr. Wagner was buried beside the graves of his father, United States Senator Robert F. Wagner, and mother, Margaret, and first wife, Susan Edwards Wagner, and not far from the grave of New York's Governor Al Smith.\\" The Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University is named in his honor, as is the Robert F. Wagner Jr. Park in Battery Park City and the Robert F. Wagner Jr. Secondary School for Arts and Technology in Long Island City. Wagner's papers, photographs, artifacts and other materials are housed at the New York City Municipal Archives and at La Guardia and Wagner Archives.

The British government purchased 51% of the company in 1914, gaining a controlling number of shares, effectively nationalizing the company. It was the first company to extract petroleum from Iran. In 1935 APOC was renamed the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC) when Reza Shah Pahlavi formally asked foreign countries to refer to Persia by its endonym Iran. In 1954 it was renamed again to the British Petroleum Company (BP), one of the antecedents of the modern BP public limited company. The government of Mohammad Mosaddegh nationalized the company's local infrastructure assets and gave the new company the name National Iranian Oil Company. The British waged a trade war with Iran rather than pay Iran's new prices (the arrangement since 1901 had been that Iran got only 16% of the profits) and, with the United States CIA, arranged a military coup to depose Mosaddegh and install a regime more favorable to the UK.  The D'Arcy oil concession  thumbnail = Exploration and discovery = thumbnail In 1901 William Knox D'Arcy, a millionaire London socialite, negotiated an oil concession with Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar of Persia. He financed this with capital he had made from his shares in the highly profitable Mount Morgan mine in Queensland, Australia. D'Arcy assumed exclusive rights to prospect for oil for 60 years in a vast tract of territory including most of Iran. In exchange the Shah received ¬£20,000 (¬£ million today), an equal amount in shares of D'Arcy's company, and a promise of 16% of future profits.. D'Arcy hired geologist George Bernard Reynolds to do the prospecting in the Iranian desert. Conditions were extremely harsh: \\"small pox raged, bandits and warlords ruled, water was all but unavailable, and temperatures often soared past 50¬∞C\\".. After several years of prospecting, D'Arcy's fortune dwindled away and he was forced to sell most of his rights to a Glasgow-based syndicate, the Burmah Oil Company. By 1908, having sunk more than ¬£500,000 into their Persian venture and found no oil, D'Arcy and Burmah decided to abandon exploration in Iran. In early May 1908, they sent Reynolds a telegram telling him that they had run out of money and ordering him to \\"cease work, dismiss the staff, dismantle anything worth the cost of transporting to the coast for re-shipment, and come home.\\" Reynolds delayed following these orders and in a stroke of luck, struck oil shortly after, on 26 May 1908. =Creation of APOC= On 14 April 1909, Burmah Oil created the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC) as a subsidiary and also sold shares to the public. Volume production of Persian oil products eventually started in 1913 from a refinery built at Abadan, for its first 50 years the largest oil refinery in the world (see Abadan Refinery). In 1913, shortly before World War I, APOC managers negotiated with a new customer, Winston Churchill, who was then First Lord of the Admiralty. Churchill, as a part of a three-year expansion program, sought to modernise Britain's Royal Navy by abandoning the use of coal-fired steamships and adopting oil as fuel for its ships instead. Although Britain had large reserves of coal, oil had the advantage of greater energy density, allowing a longer steaming range for a ship for the same bunker capacity. Furthermore, Churchill wanted to free Britain from its reliance on the Standard Oil and Royal Dutch Shell oil companies. In exchange for secure oil supplies for its ships, the British government injected new capital into the company and, in doing so, acquired a controlling interest in APOC. The contract that was set up between the British Government and APOC was to hold for 20 years. The British government also became a de facto hidden power behind the oil company. APOC took a 50% share in a new Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC) organised in 1912 by Calouste Gulbenkian to explore and develop oil resources in the Ottoman Empire. After a hiatus caused by World War I it reformed and struck an immense gusher at Kirkuk, Iraq in 1927, renaming itself the Iraq Petroleum Company. In 1920, the APOC also acquired a northern oil concession that had been formally granted in 1916 to a former Russian subject, the Georgian Akaki Khoshtaria. To manage this new acquisition, the APOC formed a new subsidiary, the North Persia Oil Company, but the Iranians refused to accept the new company, giving rise to a lingering dispute over the northern Iranian oil.Kazemi, F. (December 15, 1985), \\"Anglo-Persian Oil Company\\", in: Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, Vol. II, Fasc. 1. Iranica Online (Last Updated: August 5, 2011). Accessed April 16, 2012. In 1923, a large quantity of oil was found at Naftkhana (now Khanaqin in Diyala Province), which was considered a \\"transferred territory\\" along the Iran-Iraq border. The Khanaqin Oil Company was registered in London as an APOC subsidiary. During this period, Iranian popular opposition to the D'Arcy oil concession and royalty terms whereby Iran only received 16% of net profits was widespread. Since industrial development and planning, as well as other fundamental reforms were predicated on oil revenues, the government's lack of control over the oil industry served to accentuate the Iranian government's misgivings regarding the manner in which APOC conducted its affairs in Iran. Such a pervasive atmosphere of dissatisfaction seemed to suggest that a radical revision of the concession terms would be possible. Moreover, owing to the introduction of reforms that improved fiscal order in Iran, APOC's past practice of cutting off advances in oil royalties when its demands were not met had lost much of its sting. In 1923, Burmah employed Winston Churchill as a paid consultant to lobby the British government to allow APOC to have exclusive rights to Persian oil resources, which were subsequently granted. In 1925, TPC received concession in the Mesopotamian oil resources from the Iraqi government under British mandate. TPC finally struck oil in Iraq on 14 October 1927. In 1928, the APOC's shareholding in TPC, which by now was named Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), would be reduced to 23.75%; as the result of the changing geopolitics post Ottoman Empire break-up, and the Red Line Agreement. =Renegotiating of terms by Iran= The attempt to revise the terms of the oil concession on a more favourable basis for Iran led to protracted negotiations that took place in Tehran, Lausanne, London and Paris between Abdolhossein Teymourtash, Iran's Minister of Court 1925‚Äì32 and its nominal Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the Chairman of APOC, John Cadman, spanned 1928‚Äì32. The overarching argument for revisiting the terms of the D'Arcy Agreement on the Iranian side was that its national wealth was being squandered by a concession that was granted in 1901 by a previous non- constitutional government forced to agree to inequitable terms under duress. In order to buttress his position in talks with the British, Teymourtash retained the expertise of French and Swiss oil experts. Iran demanded a revision of the terms whereby Iran would be granted 25% of APOC's total shares. To counter British objections, Teymourtash would state that \\"if this had been a new concession, the Persian Government would have insisted not on 25 percent but on a 50‚Äì50 basis. Teymourtash also asked for a minimum guaranteed interest of 12.5% on dividends from the shares of the company, plus 2s per ton of oil produced. In addition, he specified that the company was to reduce the existing area of the concession. The intent behind reducing the area of the concession was to push APOC operations to the southwest of the country so as to make it possible for Iran to approach and lure other oil companies to develop oilfields on more equitable terms in areas not part of APOC's area of concession. Apart from demanding a more equitable share of the profits of the company, an issue that did not escape Teymourtash's attention was that the flow of transactions between APOC and its various subsidiaries deprived Iran of gaining an accurate and reliable appreciation of APOC's full profits. As such, he demanded that the company register itself in Tehran as well as London, and the exclusive rights of transportation of the oil be returned to the Iranian government. In fact in the midst of the negotiations in 1930, the Iranian National Consultative Assembly approved a bill whereby foreign companies would be required to pay a 4 percent tax on prospective profits earned in Iran. In the face of British prevarication, Iran decided to demonstrate Iranian misgivings by upping the ante. Apart from finally allowing the press to draft editorials criticizing the terms of the D'Arcy concession, a delegation consisting of Reza Shah and other political notables and journalists was dispatched to the vicinity of the oilfields to inaugurate a newly constructed road, with instructions that they refrain from visiting the oil installation in an explicit show of protest. In 1931, Teymourtash who was travelling to Europe to enroll Crown Prince Mohammed Reza Pahlavi at a Swiss boarding school, decided to use the occasion to attempt to conclude the negotiations. According to Cadman, Teymourtash worked feverishly and diligently to resolve all outstanding issues, but succeeded only in securing an agreement in principle while key figures and lump sum payments were not settled: > He came to London, he wined and he dined and he spent day and night in > negotiating. Many interviews took place. He married his daughter, he put his > boy to school [Harrow], he met the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, a > change took place in our government, and in the midst of all this maze of > activities we reached a tentative agreement on the principles to be included > in the new document, leaving certain figures and the lump sum to be settled > at a later date. However, while Teymourtash was led to believe that after four years of exhaustive and detailed discussions, he had succeeded in navigating the negotiations on the road to a conclusive end; the latest negotiations in London were to prove nothing more than a cul de sac. Matters came to a head in 1931, when the combined effects of over-abundant oil supplies on the global markets and the economic destabilization of the Great Depression, led to fluctuations which drastically reduced annual payments accruing to Iran to a fifth of what it had received in the previous year. In that year APOC informed the Iranian government that its royalties for the year would amount to a mere ¬£366,782 while in the same period the company's income taxes paid to the British government amounted to approximately ¬£1,000,000. Furthermore, while the company's profits declined 36 percent for the year, the revenues paid to the Iranian government pursuant to the company's accounting practices decreased by 76 percent. Such a precipitous drop in royalties appeared to confirm suspicions of bad faith, and Teymourtash indicated that the parties would have to revisit negotiations. However, Reza Shah was soon to assert his authority by dramatically inserting himself into the negotiations. The monarch attended a meeting of the Council of Ministers in November 1932, and after publicly rebuking Teymourtash for his failure to secure an agreement, dictated a letter to cabinet cancelling the D'Arcy Agreement. The Iranian government notified APOC that it would cease further negotiations and demanded cancellation of the D'Arcy concession. Rejecting the cancellation, the British government espoused the claim on behalf of APOC and brought the dispute before the Permanent Court of International Justice at the Hague, asserting that it regarded itself \\"as entitled to take all such measures as the situation may demand for the Company's protection.\\" The Permanent Court of International Justice was a tool of the League of Nations which, in turn, was dominated by the victors of World War I. At this point, Hassan Taqizadeh, had been appointed the new Iranian Minister entrusted with the task of assuming responsibility for the oil dossier. In modern political history, Taqizadeh is known as a secular politician who believed that \\"outwardly and inwardly, in body and in spirit, Iran must become Europeanized\\".\\"In Berlin the Democrat leader Sayyed Hasan Taqizadeh edited two series of the important newspaper Kaveh (named after a legendary blacksmith who liberated Iran). The first series, published during the War, aimed largely at getting Iranians to support the Central Powers against Britain and Russia, while the second was the main organ of the new Iranian nationalist culture. In addition to supporting new young writers like Muhammad Ali Jamalzadeh, it contained striking editorial features by Taqizadeh, in one of which he said that Iran must become wholly Western in every way if it were to progress; this is perhaps the high point of the Westernist view of nationalism, which Taqizadeh himself later modified.\\" (Nikki R. Keddie, p. 181). Taqizadeh was to intimate to the British that the cancellation was simply meant to expedite negotiations and that it would constitute political suicide for Iran to withdraw from negotiations. After the dispute between the two countries was taken up at the Hague, the Czech Foreign Minister who was appointed mediator put the matter into abeyance to allow the contending parties to attempt to resolve the dispute. Ironically, Reza Shah who had stood firm in demanding the abolishment of the D'Arcy concession, suddenly acquiesced to British demands, much to the chagrin and disappointment of his Cabinet. A new agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was agreed to after Cadman visited Iran in April 1933 and was granted a private audience with the Shah. A new agreement was ratified by the National Consultative Assembly on May 28, 1933, and received Royal assent the following day. =1933 agreement= The terms of the new agreement provided for a new 60-year concession. The Agreement reduced the area under APOC control to , required annual payments in lieu of Iranian income tax, as well as guaranteeing a minimum annual payment of ¬£750,000 to the Iranian government. These provisions, while appearing favourable, are widely agreed to have represented an unfair deal for the Iranian government. The agreement extended the life of the D'Arcy concession by an additional 32 years, negligently allowed APOC to select the best , the minimum guaranteed royalty was far too modest, and in a fit of carelessness the company's operations were exempted from import or customs duties. Finally, Iran surrendered its right to annul the agreement, and settled on a complex and tediously elaborate arbitration process to settle any disagreements that would arise. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company continued its large Persian operations although it changed its name to the AIOC in 1935. By 1950 Abadan had become the world's largest refinery. In spite of diversification the AIOC still relied heavily on its Iranian oil fields for three-quarters of its supplies, and controlled all oil in Iran. Nationalisation and coup =Discontent in Iran= Indian soldiers march into the Abadan Refinery, Operation Countenance, 25 August 1941 Under the 1933 agreement with Reza Shah, AIOC had promised to give laborers better pay and more chance for advancement, build schools, hospitals, roads and telephone system. AIOC did not fulfill these promises.. In August 1941, the Allied powers Britain and the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Iran in order to secure the oilfields and open a secure supply route to the USSR. The Persian Corridor sent over 4 million tonnes of American Lend-Lease and other materiel alone. Reza Shah was forced to abdicate in favor of his son whom they considered far more friendly to their interests. Following World War II, nationalistic sentiments were on the rise in the Middle East, the most notable example being Iranian nationalism. AIOC and the pro-western Iranian government led by Prime Minister Ali Razmara, initially resisted nationalist pressure to revise AIOC's concession terms still further in Iran's favour. In May 1949, Britain offered a \\"Supplemental oil agreement\\" to appease unrest in the country. The agreement guaranteed royalty payments would not drop below ¬£4 million, reduced the area in which it would be allowed to drill, and promised more Iranians would be trained for administrative positions. The agreement, however, gave Iran neither a \\"greater voice in company's management\\", nor the right to audit the company books. In addition, Iranian royalties from oil were not expected to ever drop to the proposed guarantee of ¬£4 million and the reduced area covered all of the productive oilfields. When the Iranian Prime Minister tried to argue with AIOC head Sir William Fraser, Fraser \\"dismissed him\\" and flew back to the UK.. In late December 1950, word reached Tehran that the American-owned Arabian American Oil Company had agreed to share profits with Saudis on a 50-50 basis. The UK Foreign Office rejected the idea of any similar agreement for AIOC.. On 7 March 1951, Prime Minister Haj Ali Razmara was assassinated by the Fada'iyan-e Islam. Fada'iyan-e Islam supported the demands of the National Front, which held a minority of seats in Parliament, to nationalize the assets of the British Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. As Prime Minister, Razmara had convinced the majority that nationalization would be folly, but his assassination eliminated the sole voice powerful enough to oppose the demands of the National Front. Iranian anger about the lack of progress in the nationalization of AIOC was apparent when the assassination of Razmara. was marked by an obvious lack of mourning by the Iranian public. A raucous protest walkout by newspaper reporters ensued when a visiting American diplomat urged \\"reason as well as enthusiasm\\" to deal with the imminent British embargo against Iran.. By 1951, Iranian support for nationalisation of the AIOC was intense. Grievances included the small fraction of revenues Iran received. In 1947, for example, AIOC reported after-tax profits of ¬£40 million ($112 million), but the contractual agreement entitled Iran to just ¬£7 million (17.5% of profits) from Iranian oil. Britain was receiving more from AIOC than Iran.. In addition, conditions for Iranian oil workers and their families were very bad. The director of Iran's Petroleum Institute wrote: =Nationalisation= Later in March 1951, the Iranian parliament, the Majlis, voted to nationalise the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC) and its holdings, and shortly thereafter the Iranian public elected a champion of nationalisation, Mohammed Mossadegh, as prime minister.Abrahamian, Iran between Two Revolutions (1982), pp. 55‚Äì6 That led to the Abadan Crisis, in which, under British pressure, foreign countries agreed not to purchase Iranian oil, and the Abadan refinery was closed. The AIOC withdrew from Iran and increased the output of its other reserves in the Persian Gulf. Mossadegh broke off negotiations with the AIOC in July 1951, after the AIOC threatened to pull its employees out of Iran, and Britain warned tanker owners that \\"the receipts from the Iranian government would not be accepted on the world market.\\"Abrahamian, Iran between Two Revolutions (1982), p. 268 The British ratcheted up the pressure on the Iranian government and drew up a detailed plan of an invasion to occupy Abadan, a contingency plan known by the code name \\"Buccaneer\\". That plan was ultimately rejected by both Clement Attlee and Winston Churchill. US President Harry S. Truman and US ambassador to Iran Henry F. Grady opposed intervention in Iran but needed Britain's support for the Korean War. The United States was also opposed to nationalization of the AIOC, because of the fear that the idea of nationalization would spread to other places, but the US believed it would be possible to reach a face-saving agreement with Mossadegh, under which actual control and management of the organisation would remain with the AIOC. The United States sent Averell Harriman to Iran to convince Mossadegh of such a scheme. Arriving in Tehran on 15 July 1951, Harriman claimed that the United States accepted nationalization, yet insisted on having \\"a foreign-owned company to act as an agent of NIOC in conducting operations in Iran\\". The British were also in favor of pseudo-nationalization, sending Lord Privy Seal Richard Stokes to Iran, arriving on 3 August 1951, with the same aim as Harriman. Mossadegh adamantly opposed the plan, because he thought it would only \\"revive the former AIOC in a new form.\\" Mossadegh's opposition caused the British to conclude that he had to go. Officials at the Ministry of Fuel and Power wrote in September 1951: In October 1951, Mossadegh paid a visit to the United States, after the US embassy in Tehran had accidentally invited him (the invitation was actually meant for Churchill). There, in discussions with George C. McGhee, Mossadegh surprisingly agreed to a complex settlement, under which Iran would own the refinery in Kermanshah and administer the oilfields, and the much larger Abadan Refinery would be sold to a non-British company. The money from that sale would go to the AIOC as compensation. Furthermore, the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) would sell a minimum of 30 million tons of crude oil annually to the AIOC for the next fifteen years, its board would consist of three Iranians and four non-Iranians, and the transactions of the NIOC would mostly remain in sterling. Mossadegh prolonged his visit on Washington's urging because the US administration believed that the incoming Conservative government of Winston Churchill would be agreeable to that deal. However, the deal was rejected by the British, who believed Mossadegh's downfall was imminent. Several major oil companies, such as Socony-Vacuum and Shell, assured the Ministry of Fuel and Power that they were also opposed to the agreement. Efforts were made by the UK to settle the dispute through the International Court of Justice, although Iran contended that the issue of nationalization was outside the court's jurisdiction. On 22 July 1952, \\"the court accepted the Iranian argument that the dispute was between the Iranian government and a foreign corporation, not the British government; since the dispute was not about a treaty or convention with a foreign government, it was subject to Iranian domestic law\\". As the months went on, the crisis became acute. By mid-1952, an attempt by the Shah to replace Mossadegh backfired, and led to riots against the Shah and perceived foreign intervention. After that, Mossadegh returned with even greater prestige. At the same time however, his coalition was weakening, because Britain‚Äôs boycott of Iranian oil eliminated a major source of government revenue, and made Iranians poorer and thus unhappier by the day. =Coup= Britain was unable to subvert Mossadegh because its embassy and officials had been evicted from Iran in October 1952, but it successfully appealed to US anti-communist sentiment, depicting both Mossadegh and Iran as unstable and likely to fall under communist influence as they were weakened. It was alleged that if Iran fell, the \\"enormous assets\\" of \\"Iranian oil production and reserves\\" would come under communist control, as would \\"in short order the other areas of the Middle East\\".. By 1953, both the US and the UK had new, more anti-communist and interventionist administrations, and the United States no longer opposed intervention in Iran. The anti-Mossadegh plan was orchestrated by CIA under the code-name 'Operation Ajax', and by SIS (MI6) as 'Operation Boot'..The C.I.A. in Iran: Britain Fights Oil Nationalism In August, the American CIA, using bribes to politicians, soldiers, mobs, and newspapers, and with information from the British embassy and secret service, organized a riot which gave the Shah an excuse to remove Mosaddegh. The Shah issued an edict forcefully removing the immensely popular and democratically elected Mosaddegh from power, and General Fazlollah Zahedi led tanks to Mosaddegh's residence and arrested him. On 21 December 1953, Mosaddegh was sentenced three years' solitary confinement in a military prison, well short of the death sentence requested by the prosecutors. He was then kept under house arrest at his Ahmadabad residence, until his death on 5 March 1967.Abrahamian, Ervand, Iran Between Two Revolutions by Ervand Abrahamian, (Princeton University Press, 1982), p. 280Mossadegh ‚Äì A Medical Biography by Ebrahim NorouziPersian Oil: A Study in Power Politics by L.P. Elwell-Sutton. 1955. Lawrence and Wishart Ltd. LondonEccentric Nationalist Begets Strange History, New York Times 7 December 2009. = Consortium = With a pro-Western Shah and the new pro-Western Prime Minister, Fazlollah Zahedi, Iranian oil began flowing again and the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company, which changed its name to British Petroleum (BP) in 1954, tried to return to its old position. However, Iranian public opinion was so opposed that the new government could not permit it. Under pressure from the United States, BP was forced to accept membership in a consortium of companies which would bring Iranian oil back on the international market. BP was incorporated in London in 1954 as a holding company called Iranian Oil Participants Ltd (IOP)... The founding members of IOP included British Petroleum (40%), Gulf Oil (8%), Royal Dutch Shell (14%), and Compagnie Fran√ßaise des P√©troles (later Total S.A., 6%). The four Aramco partners ‚Äî Standard Oil of California (SoCal, later Chevron), Standard Oil of New Jersey (later Exxon), Standard Oil Co. of New York (later Mobil, then ExxonMobil), and Texaco ‚Äì each held an 8% stake in the holding company.. This group of companies at various stages came to be known as the Supermajors, the \\"Seven Sisters\\", or the \\"Consortium for Iran\\" cartel, and dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s to the 1970s.The new Seven Sisters: oil and gas giants dwarf western rivals, by Carola Hoyos, Financial Times. 11 March 2007 Until the oil crisis of 1973, the members of the Seven Sisters controlled around 85% of the world's known oil reserves. All IOP members acknowledged that the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) owned the oil and facilities in Iran, and IOP's role was to operate and manage them on behalf of NIOC. To facilitate that, IOP established two operating entities incorporated in the Netherlands, and both were delegated to NIOC. Similar to the Saudi- Aramco \\"50/50\\" agreement of 1950,. the consortium agreed to share profits on a 50‚Äì50 basis with Iran, \\"but not to open its books to Iranian auditors or to allow Iranians onto its board of directors.\\" The negotiations leading to the creation of the consortium, during 1954-55, was considered as a feat of skillful diplomacy for the \\"Seven Sisters\\". Some viewed the move as one to quell the rising tensions of Iranians since it allowed IOP to divert and hide profits with ease‚Äîeffectively controlling Iran's share of the profits. Subsidiary companies =Scottish Oils Ltd= Scottish Oils Ltd, established by Anglo-Persian in 1919 by merging five Scottish oil shale companies (Young's Paraffin Light & Mineral Oil Company, Broxburn Oil Company, Pumpherston Shale Oil Company, Oakbank Oil Company and James Ross & Company Philpstoun Oil Works), was a producer of shale oil.. Shale oil production in Scotland ceased in the early 1960s but there was an unsuccessful attempt to revive it in 1973. The company was wound up on 15 December 2010. The Scottish Oil Agency Ltd was a distributing and selling organisation of Scottish Oils Ltd. A Scottish Oil Agency rail tanker is preserved at the Museum of the Scottish Shale Oil Industry. Tanker fleet The British Tanker Company Limited (BTC) was formed in 1915, after the Anglo-Persian Oil Company decided to become a fully self-contained operation, directly owning a fleet of tankers for sea transport. On formation, the BTC had an initial budget of $144,000 with which to build seven steam-powered tankers. The Company's first tanker was the British Emperor, which was launched in 1916. The names of the first seven ships, and all later additions to the fleet, bore the prefix British. Over the next decade, the demand for oil grew throughout the developed world, and the BTC expanded accordingly. By 1924, the fleet numbered 60 ships, with the 60th being the flagship, 10,762 deadweight tonnes (dwt), British Aviator. She was the BTC‚Äôs first diesel engine oil tanker, and at that time the most powerful single-screw motor ship in the world. The economic depression of the early 1930s saw rising unemployment amongst merchant navies around the world. However, the BTC undertook a series of strategic mergers, and coupled with the continued support of the Shah of Iran, the APOC succeeded in strengthening its position within the industry. In 1939, the British government chartered the whole fleet of 93 tankers to supply fuel to its armed forces during the Second World War. The fleet lost a total of 42 ships sunk during the war. Within a year of peace in 1945, the BTC fleet had returned to its pre-war total of 93 vessels. The recovery continued with the building of 57 new tankers, each 12,000 dwt, which increased the tonnage of oil transported from Abadan refinery in Iran, whilst remaining light enough for the tankers to pass through the shallow waters of the Suez Canal. In 1946, Princess Elizabeth launched the tanker British Princess for the APOC, and was given a sapphire brooch to mark the occasion. In 1951, however, the situation changed dramatically, when the Iranian oil industry was nationalised, and the APOC removed all its staff from Iran.

He also earned fifty-three caps with the U.S. national team between 1987 and 1994 including two games at the 1990 FIFA World Cup. He was a member of the U.S. team at the 1988 Summer Olympics and was most recently the general manager of the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer before resigning on August 29, 2016.http://www.sjearthquakes.com/club/johndoyle  Youth  Doyle attended Washington High School in Fremont, California where he played on the boys' soccer team. The team won the league championship Doyle's senior year. At the end of his senior year, he held the school's scoring record and had been named All-League each year he played. Doyle was named Athlete of the Decade for the 1980s. Doyle also played soccer with the Fremont City youth soccer club where he was a four-time state champion. After high school, he attended the University of San Francisco where he played college soccer. He was a 1986 second team All-American. He was inducted into the University of San Francisco Hall of Fame in 1999 and named a Legend of the Hilltop in 2005.  Professional  = Western Soccer League = In 1987, Doyle spent the collegiate off-season with the San Jose Earthquakes of the Western Soccer League. In 1989 and 1990, he also played for the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks during the college soccer off-season. In 1989, he was named to the WSL All- Star team. = Europe = In 1990, he moved to Europe where he signed with Swedish club √ñrgryte IS. In 1992, he returned to the Blackhawks for six games during the summer. In 1993, he played for German First Division club VfB Leipzig. Leipzig had won promotion to the First Division in 1993, but lasted only one year there, finishing last in 1994 and being demoted to the Second Division for the next season. = Return to the U.S. = With the demotion of Leipzig, Doyle signed with Major League Soccer (MLS). However, when the league delayed its first season to 1996, Doyle joined the Atlanta Ruckus of the A-League on loan from MLS for their inaugural season. The Ruckus developed their team around Doyle and the defense, which led the team to the league's championship game where the Ruckus lost to the Seattle Sounders. Doyle was selected to the league All-Star team and was named the league Defender of the Year. In order to ensure an initial equitable distribution of talent to each of the league's new teams, MLS allocated well known players. Doyle was allocated to the San Jose Clash. At the end of the A-League season, Doyle moved back to the Bay Area, becoming the first player, and first team captain, in the Clash's history in 1996. He was then named MLS's first Defender of the Year. Doyle scored eleven goals and had fifteen assists in his time in the league.  National and Olympic teams  The U.S. Olympic team called in Doyle for a May 30, 1987, qualification match against Canada. The U.S. had lost 2‚Äì0 to Canada a week earlier and needed to win by that margin or greater to continue qualification. The team rose to the challenge and defeated Canada 3‚Äì0. Doyle continued to play with the Olympic team, including its three games at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. In those games, he scored a goal in the 4‚Äì2 loss to the Soviet Union. He would continue to play for the national team in 1989, when the U.S. began qualification for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. He played two games for the U.S. at the finals.

Most of the founding authors were published by Les √âditions de Minuit with the strong support of J√©r√¥me Lindon. Overview Alain Robbe-Grillet, an influential theorist as well as writer of the Nouveau Roman, published a series of essays on the nature and future of the novel which were later collected in Pour un Nouveau Roman. Rejecting many of the established features of the novel to date, Robbe-Grillet regarded many earlier novelists as old-fashioned in their focus on plot, action, narrative, ideas, and character. Instead, he put forward a theory of the novel as focused on objects: the ideal nouveau roman would be an individual version and vision of things, subordinating plot and character to the details of the world rather than enlisting the world in their service. Despite the assertions of nouveaut√©, this vision of the novel can be construed as developing from earlier writers' suggestions and practice. Joris-Karl Huysmans, ninety years before, had suggested how the novel might be depersonalised; more recently, Franz Kafka had shown that conventional methods of depicting character were not essential; James Joyce had done the same for plot; and absurdist writers had engaged with some of the themes that preoccupied writers of the nouveau roman. Seminar with Jean Ricardou and Claude Simon, Cerisy (France) Contemporary literature workshop with Marc Avelot, Philippe Binant, Bernard Magn√©, Claudette Oriol-Boyer, Jean Ricardou, Cerisy (France), 1980 A group of writers dubbed Nouveaux Romanciers, New novelists, appeared in the mid-1950s: Alain Robbe-Grillet, Claude Simon, Nathalie Sarraute, Michel Butor and Robert Pinget. The style had different approaches but generally rejected the traditional use of chronology, plot and character in fiction, as well as the omniscient narrator. The Nouveau Roman authors were open to influences from writers such as William Faulkner and the cinema. Both Robbe-Grillet and Marguerite Duras, whose 1958 novel Moderato cantabile was in the style of the Nouveau roman, also contributed to the French New Wave style of filmmaking.French literature - Toward the nouveau roman Encyclopedia Britannica Alain Robbe-Grillet became an elected member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise on 25 March 2004, succeeding Maurice Rheims at seat No. 32. Claude Simon, the 1985 Nobel Laureate in Literature, is often identified with the nouveau roman movement. Jean Ricardou is the theorist of the nouveau roman literary movement. Authors in the style of the Nouveau Roman Other writers associated with the style of Nouveau Roman are: * G√©rard Bessette * Maurice Blanchot * Italo Calvino * Jean Cayrol * Julio Cort√°zar * Mark Z. Danielewski * Tony Duvert * Jacques Godbout * Maude Hutchins * J. M. G. Le Cl√©zio * Claude Mauriac * Claude Ollier * Georges Perec * Tanguy Viel * Kateb Yacine The Nouveau Roman and the Left Bank The Nouveau Roman style also left its mark on the screen as writers Marguerite Duras and Alain Robbe-Grillet became involved with the Left Bank film movement (often labelled as part of the French New Wave). Their collaboration with director Alain Resnais resulted in critical successes such as Hiroshima mon amour (1958) and Last Year in Marienbad (1961). They would later go on to direct their own films.Clouzot, Claire, Le cin√©ma fran√ßais depuis la nouvelle vague, Fernand Nathan/Alliance Fran√ßaise, 1972 Influenced by these films French courses in North America during the 1960s and 1970s often included works by Nouveau Roman authors such as Alain Robbe-Grillet's La Jalousie (1957), Michel Butor's La Modification (1957), Nathalie Sarraute's Le Planetarium (1957) and Marguerite Duras' Moderato Cantabile (1958). The Nouveau Roman in Quebec, Canada The Nouveau Roman influenced French-language writers in Quebec such as Jacques Godbout and Gerard Bessette. The Canadian-born French writer Nancy Huston declared that she began writing in direct reaction to the stark style of the Nouveau Roman in Nord Perdu (1999).

The term occurs in Scotland and in Ireland,Garron, Dictionary,com and generally refers to an undersized beast. In Scotland, a garron is one of the types of Highland pony. It is the larger, heavier type bred on the mainland. The Isles' type of pony is generally smaller and slightly finer, but still within the breed standard. There is less difference today than there once was between these two types. The word garron has also been used to describe a Highland cross of a Clydesdale horse with ponies. It was used in farming, especially in the Highlands and Islands where a full-sized Clydesdale would not have been as economical. These horses were valued for their hardiness and ability to work on slopes.Topham, John.

It is also the geographic name of the promontory upon which the fort and the southern approach of the Golden Gate Bridge were constructed.Fort Point, ID 223701, Geographic Names Information System USGS The fort was completed just before the American Civil War by the United States Army, to defend San Francisco Bay against hostile warships. The fort is now protected as Fort Point National Historic Site, a United States National Historic Site administered by the National Park Service as a unit of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. History In 1769 Spain occupied the San Francisco area and by 1776 had established the area's first European settlement, with a mission and a presidio. To protect against encroachment by the British and Russians, Spain selected Punta del Cantil Blanco, a promontory with a high white cliff (cantil blanco) located at the narrowest part of the bay's entrance,Plano del Puerto de San Francisco, Jose de Ca√±izares, 1776, Archivo Cartografico y de Estudios Geograficos, Madrid, Spain, Digital Commons to construct a fortification. The Castillo de San Joaquin was constructed in 1794, subordinate to the nearby Presidio de San Francisco. It was an adobe structure housing nine to thirteen cannons.Castillo de San Joaquin, California State Military Museums, California Military Department, Sacramento Mexico won independence from Spain in 1821, gaining control of the region and the fort, but in 1835 the Mexican army moved to Sonoma leaving the castillo's adobe walls to crumble in the wind and rain. On July 1, 1846, after the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War broke out between Mexico and the United States, U.S. forces, including Captain John Charles Fremont, Kit Carson and a band of 10 followers, captured and occupied the empty castillo and spiked (disabled) the cannons. Sometime during the Spanish and Mexican eras, the Punta del Cantil Blanco came to be known as the \\"Punta del Castillo\\" (\\"Castle Point\\")Sixty Years In California, by William Heath Davis, publ. 1889. p.6 (Internet Archive), which was carried over into the era of U.S. sovereignty, in rough translation, as \\"Fort Point\\". =U.S. era= Following the United States' victory in 1848, California was annexed by the U.S. and became a state in 1850. The gold rush of 1849 had caused rapid settlement of the area, which was recognized as commercially and strategically valuable to the United States. Military officials soon recommended a series of fortifications to secure San Francisco Bay. Coastal defenses were built at Alcatraz Island, Fort Mason, and Fort Point. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began work on Fort Point in 1853. Plans specified that the lowest tier of artillery be as close as possible to water level so cannonballs could ricochet across the water's surface to hit enemy ships at the water-line. Workers blasted the cliff down to above sea level. The structure featured seven-foot- thick walls and multi-tiered casemated construction typical of Third System forts. It was sited to defend the maximum amount of harbor area. While there were more than 30 such forts on the East Coast, Fort Point was the only one on the West Coast. In 1854 Inspector General Joseph K. Mansfield declared \\"this point as the key to the whole Pacific Coast...and it should receive untiring exertions\\". A crew of 200, many unemployed miners, labored for eight years on the fort. In 1861, with war looming, the army mounted the fort's first cannon. Colonel Albert Sidney Johnston, commander of the Department of the Pacific, prepared Bay Area defenses and ordered in the first troops to the fort. Kentucky-born Johnston then resigned his commission to join the Confederate Army; he was killed at the Battle of Shiloh in 1862.

The Confederate raider CSS Shenandoah planned to attack San Francisco, but on the way to the harbor the captain learned that the war was over; it was August 1865, months after General Lee surrendered. Severe damage to similar forts on the Atlantic Coast during the war ‚Äì Fort Sumter in South Carolina and Fort Pulaski in Georgia ‚Äì challenged the effectiveness of masonry walls against rifled artillery. Troops soon moved out of Fort Point, and it was never again continuously occupied by the army. The fort was nonetheless important enough to receive protection from the elements. In 1869 a granite seawall was completed. The following year, some of the fort's cannon were moved to Battery East on the bluffs nearby, where they were more protected. In 1882 Fort Point was officially named Fort Winfield Scott after the hero of the war against Mexico. The name was later applied to an artillery post at the Presidio. =Into a new century= In 1892, the army began constructing the new Endicott System concrete fortifications armed with steel, breech-loading rifled guns. Within eight years, all 103 of the smooth-bore cannons at Fort Point had been dismounted and sold for scrap. The fort, moderately damaged in the 1906 earthquake, was used over the next four decades for barracks, training, and storage, however, in 1913, part of the interior wall was removed by the army in their short-lived attempt to make the fort the army detention barracks using soldier and prisoner labor. The detention barracks were later built on Alcatraz Island and was used until becoming a federal prison. Soldiers from the 6th U.S. Coast Artillery were stationed there during World War II to guard minefields and the anti-submarine net that spanned the Golden Gate. New quarters and administrative buildings were constructed on the higher ground, behind the new Endicott batteries, moving Fort Scott to this location. =Preserving Fort Point= In 1926 the American Institute of Architects proposed preserving the fort for its outstanding military architecture. Funds were unavailable, and the ideas languished. Plans for the Golden Gate Bridge in the 1930s called for the fort's removal, but Chief Engineer Joseph Strauss redesigned the bridge to save \\"While the old fort has no military value now,\\" Strauss said, \\"it remains nevertheless a fine example of the mason's art.... It should be preserved and restored as a national monument.\\" The fort is situated directly below the southern approach to the bridge, underneath an arch that supports the roadway. Preservation efforts were revived after World War II.

Media use Approach to the fort The fort from the Golden Gate Bridge deck Fort Point is a popular filming location. It is also mentioned in other media. =In film= * The most famous example is Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 thriller Vertigo, wherein Kim Novak's character jumps into the San Francisco Bay in an apparent suicide attempt. * In the 1950 film The Man Who Cheated Himself, there is a five-minute search scene near the end of the film that was filmed at Fort Point and shows many shots of the fort. * In Point Blank, the 1967 John Boorman noir movie starring Lee Marvin and Angie Dickinson, it is shown as the location for the \\"Alcatraz Drop\\" at the closed Alcatraz Prison. However, in the final scene a continuous camera shot rises to show Alcatraz Prison in the distance, revealing this to be Fort Point. * In Richard Lester's 1968 film Petulia, George C. Scott's character plays with his boys, ignoring 'No Trespassing' signs, at Fort Point. * In the 1969 pilot film for the TV series Then Came Bronson, Martin Sheen's character jumps to his death from Fort Point. *In Dark Passage (1947), a fight scene with Humphrey Bogart on the bluff above the fort ends with his opponent falling to his death in what is now the fort's parking lot. * In the 2014 film Dawn of the Planet of the Apes the humans use Fort Point's armory to dramatically increase their firepower in the form of armored vehicles and large amounts of munitions. * The 2019 film The Last Black Man in San Francisco filmed throughout San Francisco, with several scenes filmed outside and around the fort. *The fort is briefly shown on a television during the opening of the 2019 horror film Us. =In games= * Fort Point is included in the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas as a night club called Jizzy's Pleasure Domes. * Fort Point is also included in the video game NBA Street * Fort Point is included in the game Midtown Madness 2 * Fort Point is one of the surf spots in Transworld Surf * Fort Point is a mission location in Watch Dogs 2 * Fort Point (along with the Golden Gate Bridge) has been faithfully recreated in Duke Nukem 3D 20th Anniversary World Tour's episode 5, level 6, named Golden Carnage. =In television= *In The Amazing Race 16, teams are here presented with a building's height, year built, and features. They must figure out that it's Coit Tower and go there to find their next clue. * In Season 3, Episode 20 of the television series The West Wing, (titled \\"The Black Vera Wang\\"), Fort Point is the intended target of a foiled terrorist attack by Islamic fundamentalists, who are planning to attack the fort because of its proximity to the Golden Gate Bridge. The attack is allegedly funded by the fictitious Arab nation of Qumar, a recurring source of terrorism over the course of the series. *Fort Point was in a made-for-TV movie \\"What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing.\\" The movie was a spin off of the T.V. show Emergency.

In quantum field theory, virtual particles are termed off shell because they do not satisfy the energy‚Äìmomentum relation; real exchange particles do satisfy this relation and are termed on shell (mass shell).Thomson, M. (2013). Modern particle physics. Cambridge University Press, , pp. 117‚Äì119. In classical mechanics for instance, in the action formulation, extremal solutions to the variational principle are on shell and the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations give the on-shell equations. Noether's theorem regarding differentiable symmetries of physical action and conservation laws is another on-shell theorem. Mass shell Points on the hyperboloid surface (the \\"shell\\") are solutions to the equation. Mass shell is a synonym for mass hyperboloid, meaning the hyperboloid in energy-momentum space describing the solutions to the equation: :E^2 - \\\\vec{p} \\\\,^2 c^2 = m_0^2 c^4, the mass‚Äìenergy equivalence formula which gives the energy E in terms of the momentum \\\\vec{p} and the rest mass m_0 of a particle. The equation for the mass shell is also often written in terms of the four-momentum; in Einstein notation with metric signature (+,‚àí,‚àí,‚àí) and units where the speed of light c = 1, as p^\\\\mu p_\\\\mu \\\\equiv p^2 = m^2. In the literature, one may also encounter p^\\\\mu p_\\\\mu = - m^2 if the metric signature used is (‚àí,+,+,+). The four-momentum of an exchanged virtual particle X is q_\\\\mu, with mass q^2 = m_X^2. The four-momentum q_\\\\mu of the virtual particle is the difference between the four-momenta of the incoming and outgoing particles. Virtual particles corresponding to internal propagators in a Feynman diagram are in general allowed to be off shell, but the amplitude for the process will diminish depending on how far off shell they are. This is because the q^2-dependence of the propagator is determined by the four-momenta of the incoming and outgoing particles. The propagator typically has singularities on the mass shell.Thomson, M. (2013). Modern particle physics. Cambridge University Press, , p.119. When speaking of the propagator, negative values for E that satisfy the equation are thought of as being on shell, though the classical theory does not allow negative values for the energy of a particle. This is because the propagator incorporates into one expression the cases in which the particle carries energy in one direction, and in which its antiparticle carries energy in the other direction; negative and positive on- shell E then simply represent opposing flows of positive energy. Scalar field  An example comes from considering a scalar field in D-dimensional Minkowski space. Consider a Lagrangian density given by \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\phi,\\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\phi). The action :S = \\\\int d^D x \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\phi,\\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\phi) The Euler-Lagrange equation for this action can be found by varying the field and its derivative and setting the variation to zero, and is: :\\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial (\\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\phi)} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial \\\\phi} Now, consider an infinitesimal spacetime translation x^\\\\mu \\\\rightarrow x^\\\\mu +\\\\alpha^\\\\mu. The Lagrangian density \\\\mathcal{L} is a scalar, and so will infinitesimally transform as \\\\delta \\\\mathcal{L} = \\\\alpha^\\\\mu \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\mathcal{L} under the infinitesimal transformation. On the other hand, by Taylor expansion, we have in general :\\\\delta \\\\mathcal{L} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial \\\\phi} \\\\delta \\\\phi + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial (\\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\phi)} \\\\delta( \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\phi) Substituting for \\\\delta \\\\mathcal{L} and noting that \\\\delta( \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\phi) = \\\\partial_\\\\mu ( \\\\delta \\\\phi) (since the variations are independent at each point in spacetime): :\\\\alpha^\\\\mu \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\mathcal{L} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial \\\\phi} \\\\alpha^\\\\mu \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\phi + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial (\\\\partial_ u \\\\phi)} \\\\alpha^\\\\mu \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\partial_ u \\\\phi Since this has to hold for independent translations \\\\alpha^\\\\mu = (\\\\epsilon, 0,...,0) , (0,\\\\epsilon, ...,0), ..., we may \\"divide\\" by \\\\alpha^\\\\mu and write: : \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\mathcal{L} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial \\\\phi} \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\phi + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial (\\\\partial_ u \\\\phi)} \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\partial_ u \\\\phi This is an example of equation that holds off shell, since it is true for any fields configuration regardless of whether it respects the equations of motion (in this case, the Euler-Lagrange equation given above). However, we can derive an on shell equation by simply substituting the Euler-Lagrange equation: : \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\mathcal{L} = \\\\partial_ u \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial (\\\\partial_ u \\\\phi)} \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\phi + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial (\\\\partial_ u \\\\phi)} \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\partial_ u \\\\phi We can write this as: : \\\\partial_ u \\\\left (\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\partial (\\\\partial_ u \\\\phi)} \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\phi -\\\\delta^ u_\\\\mu \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\right) = 0 And if we define the quantity in parentheses as T^ u{}_\\\\mu, we have: :\\\\partial_ u T^ u{}_\\\\mu = 0 This is an instance of Noether's theorem. Here, the conserved quantity is the stress‚Äìenergy tensor, which is only conserved on shell, that is, if the equations of motion are satisfied.

He is modeled after the Hatter from Lewis Carroll's novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, a character often called the \\"Mad Hatter\\" in adaptations of Carroll. Mad Hatter is depicted as a scientist who invents and uses technological mind-controlling devices to influence and manipulate the minds of his victims. He is one of Batman's most enduring enemies and belongs to the collective of adversaries that make up Batman's rogues gallery. The Mad Hatter has been substantially adapted from the comics into various forms of media, including feature films, television series, and video games. He has been voiced by Roddy McDowall in the DC animated universe, and Peter MacNicol in the Batman: Arkham video game series. He has also been portrayed in live- action by David Wayne in the 1960s Batman series, and Benedict Samuel in the Fox series Gotham. Publication history Created by Bill Finger and Lew Sayre Schwartz, the Mad Hatter made his first appearance in Batman #49 (October 1948). Jervis Tetch is fascinated with hats of all shapes and sizes, as well as the Lewis Carroll's children's book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and its sequel Through the Looking-Glass, particularly favoring the chapter \\"A Mad Tea Party\\". According to Dr. Blakloch of Arkham Asylum: Blakloch also notes that when agitated, Tetch begins rhyming as a defence mechanism. Tetch often quotes and makes reference to Carroll's Wonderland novels, and sometimes even fails to discern between these stories and reality. In addition to his obsession with Lewis Carroll, Tetch has also shown an additional obsession for hats. In Secret Six, he will not eat a piece of food that does not have a hat on it, and states that he is not interested in the sight of his naked teammate Knockout because she is not wearing a hat. In the graphic novel Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, it is strongly implied that he is a pedophile. His storylines in Streets of Gotham #4 and Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale's Batman: Haunted Knight also imply an unhealthy fixation on children, such as when he kidnaps a young Barbara Gordon and forces her into a tea party dressed as Alice, as well as kidnapping other runaway children and dressing them up like characters from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Fictional character biography Growing up, Tetch was a lonely, awkward child, shunned by other children and living in his own fantasy world. As an adult, he becomes a neuroscientist, and at some point moves into a boarding house owned by Ella Littleton. There he befriends Ella's daughter, Connie, and her friends in her junior high school computer club, sometimes helping them with their projects. A few years later, when Connie is in high school, she gets pregnant. Fearing the reaction of her extremely strict mother, Connie lies to her and claims she had been raped by someone on her high school's baseball team, the Gotham Hawks. Ella, in turn, approaches Tetch for help and convinces him that the Gotham Hawks are \\"bad kids\\". Tetch agrees to use his mind control technology on a member of the team, making him use a pipe bomb to kill the other players. Although this is Tetch's first known criminal act, his involvement in the locker room bombing would not be discovered until years later. =Criminal career= Jervis Tetch/The Mad Hatter in his first appearance in Batman #49 (1948). In his first appearance as the Mad Hatter, Tetch attempts to steal a trophy from the Gotham Yacht Club, and begins a crime spree that ends when he is foiled by Batman while he is trying to rob spectators from a high society horseshow. Tetch is subsequently sent to Arkham Asylum (although his fate is not revealed until Detective Comics #510). The Mad Hatter is not seen again in the Golden Age of Comic Books. In the Silver Age of Comic Books, an impostor Mad Hatter appears and clashes with Batman many times. He is revealed as an impostor when the Mad Hatter finally reappears, claiming to have \\"disposed of the impostor\\" (although the impostor would return one last time in Detective Comics #573 in 1987). Accompanied by several henchmen and a pet chimpanzee (named \\"Carroll Lewis\\", although the Mad Hatter claims that the chimp refuses to tell him how it came to have that moniker), the Mad Hatter kidnaps Lucius Fox, the C.E.O. of Wayne Tech. Although he holds Lucius Fox for ransom, the Mad Hatter also unveils a device allowing him to copy the knowledge in Fox's brain, which he intends to use to make an additional fortune. However, Lucius Fox is rescued by Batman, who also captures the Mad Hatter and his henchmen. The Mad Hatter's next appearance marks the first time he is portrayed in comics with the mind- controlling devices for which he would eventually become best known. Allying himself with other villains in an attempt to kill Batman, Hatter uses a mind- controlling hat on Scarecrow, forcing the villain (who had been paralyzed with fear) to fight. When Batman overcomes his attackers, Tetch flees and appears to die on a bridge under the wheels of a train. In actuality he had escaped by jumping onto a truck that had been passing underneath the bridge. Subsequent encounters with Batman resulted in Tetch being sent to Arkham. During another early encounter with Batman, the Mad Hatter escapes from Arkham in time for Halloween, and makes his home in an old mansion that had been abandoned after a gruesome murder years before. Retreating deeply into his delusions about Wonderland, Tetch offers sanctuary to runaway children, asking them in return to dress up as characters from Alice in Wonderland and attend his tea parties, where he serves them drugged tea to keep them sedated. Around this time, the teenage Barbara Gordon comes to Gotham, having been adopted by her uncle, Commissioner Jim Gordon, following the death of her parents. Barbara sneaks out against her uncle's orders, and goes to Gotham Park, where she soon finds herself being chased by a group of masked men with knives. The group surround her, and begin implying that they will molest or rape her, provoking her to scream for help. The Mad Hatter appears and scares the men away with his gun. Tetch takes her to his \\"Wonderland\\", where she is expected to play the role of Alice. When she refuses to drink tea and asks to leave, Tetch angrily smashes a teapot, scaring another of the runaways into sneaking away while Tetch's attention is on Barbara. The boy leads the police and Batman to Tetch's hideout, and Tetch is defeated by Batman while Commissioner Gordon rescues Barbara. When Black Orchid visits Arkham Asylum, attempting to find out more about her past from Poison Ivy, she is assisted by Tetch. After Ivy refuses to help Orchid, Tetch tries to cheer her up. He also reveals he has been helping other inmates at Arkham, such as bringing Ivy things to make her plant-animal hybrids with. \\"I believe in helping people,\\" he explains. \\"We were all put here for a purpose, I say. But it's still nice to get a thank-you.\\" Tetch is delighted to receive a small flower as thanks for his help. Tetch is also aware of Animal Man's identity as Buddy Baker. He is seen laughing hysterically in Arkham with the final page of \\"The Return with the Man of the Animal Powers\\", the second Animal Man story, after which he is dragged back to his cell. In the Knightfall saga, the Mad Hatter is the first to strike, following the breakout from Arkham. He invites all criminals to a tea party to which Batman and Robin would come. One of the criminals was Film Freak, on whom Tetch uses a mind control device, sending him to find the person that broke them out of Arkham. Batman and Robin come and defeat the Mad Hatter as Film Freak is defeated by Bane. In Robin: Year One, millionaire third-world dictator Generalissimo Lee hires the Mad Hatter to kidnap a number of young girls using his mind control devices. The Mad Hatter does so by implanting the devices in Walkmen, which he gives out to girls at Dick Grayson's school. The young Robin manages to defeat the Mad Hatter, however. Another plan consisted of implanting his devices in \\"free coffee and donuts\\" tickets he handed out in front of the police stations in Gotham. That plan had him controlling most of the cops in the city, inciting them to steal for him, and ultimately to riot. He even had Gotham police detectives Crispus Allen and Renee Montoya break into a bank for him. Sasha Bordeaux helped Batman stop him this time around. The Mad Hatter shows up in Gotham City after it is rocked by a devastating earthquake. He adds to his body count, callously murdering a policeman. His goal is to unearth a trove of valuables, which in the end turn out to be classic hats. Tetch's role in the deaths of the Gotham Hawks High School Baseball team is eventually discovered by detectives in the Gotham City Police Department. Tetch, imprisoned at Arkham at the time, is interviewed to try to find his motive. After sending the police away, telling them that the team had been \\"bad kids\\" and that they \\"deserved it\\", Tetch contacts Ella Littleton and warns her that the police might uncover her role in the bombing. Tetch had given her one of his mind-controlling hats years before, which she used to try to take control of a guard and try to help Tetch escape from Arkham. The Hatter is caught as he tries to escape, and the mind-controlled guard fires on police before dying in return fire. Tetch himself is shot multiple times and left in critical condition. Distraught at the news, Elle Littleton inadvertently tells her daughter Connie that Tetch had killed the team for her, to \\"avenge her honor\\". Connie informs the police of everything that had happened, and Ella Littleton is arrested. While working with Black Mask, the Mad Hatter implants a mind control chip directly into Killer Croc's brain, which causes him to mutate again due to the virus he had been injected with by Hush and the Riddler. Killer Croc embarks on a quest to get payback on those responsible for his mutation, and starts with the Mad Hatter. Batman arrives in time to save him, but Killer Croc escapes. During Infinite Crisis, the Mad Hatter is first seen being roundly beaten by Argus, and then later fighting with the Secret Society of Super Villains during the Battle of Metropolis. =One Year Later/Secret Six= Tetch is revealed to have been involved in the plot by The Great White Shark to frame Harvey Dent for murdering various Gotham criminals in the Detective Comics storyline Face The Face. The capacity in which he is involved is left vague, however. Tetch's base of operations in Gotham City is destroyed following a search for an atomic weapon, by the former Robin, Tim Drake, and the current Captain Boomerang, Owen Mercer. A recording of Tetch appears on a monitor screen and tells them that the roof will be the final hat they will ever wear as it falls down on them. Robin and Boomerang narrowly escape the building. He is later approached by Cat-Man, and he joins the members of the Secret Six to oppose the Secret Society of Super Villains; they have recruited him in hopes of a defense against Doctor Psycho's mind control abilities. When Rag Doll attacks the Secret Six under Dr. Psycho's control, Tetch puts on what he calls his \\"thinking cap\\" and goes into a seizure. After the Six crash-land, they are attacked by the Doom Patrol, who come close to apprehending the Six until Mad Hatter steps in and uses his mind control abilities to subdue the Doom Patrol singlehandedly, going so far as to almost make Elasti-Girl eat Beast Boy before Scandal stops him. In a later issue of Secret Six, Tetch reveals that he has designed a hat to make him happy beyond the measures of what illegal drugs can. He also states that he has planted miniature listening devices around the House of Secrets to keep tabs on his fellow members. After revealing the true motives of Scandal Savage to leave the team, the Secret Six go after her, finding themselves at Vandal Savage's temple in the mountains, where Doctor Psycho starts attacking the team. Tetch easily gets the upper hand on Doctor Psycho until Cheshire appears and stabs him in the back with a poisoned dagger. Scandal tends to Hatter's wound, and Cat-Man administers an antidote to Tetch. While the Six face off against Cheshire and Vandal Savage, Hatter takes on Doctor Psycho one on one, and emerges victorious despite his injuries, gravely injuring Dr. Psycho with Cheshire's dagger. At the end of the mini-series, Hatter saves Scandal from falling to her death, and the Six befriend him. As Hatter stands atop Savage's destroyed base with Rag Doll, he promises to be a very good friend in return. Rag Doll then pushes Hatter off the roof, seemingly to his death, saying there was \\"only room for one dandy freak on the team\\". However, it is revealed on the final page that Tetch survived the fall. Heartbroken, he vows revenge on the rest of the Six. Prior to the events of Gotham Underground, Tetch falls victim to his own mind control devices at the hands of Tweedledum and Tweedledee. The two force him to \\"lead\\" a gang of Wonderland-related criminals through various gimmicky heists before Batman deduces the Tweeds to be the true masterminds. Once the three are returned to Arkham, the Hatter quickly exacts revenge on the two, manipulating them into a bloody brawl with his mind control chips. =Gotham Underground and Salvation Run= More recently, Mad Hatter appears in Gotham Underground #1 (August 2007), alongside Scarecrow, Hugo Strange, the Penguin, and Two-Face, who have gathered together to assist him in escaping Gotham in light of the disappearance of other villains due to the Suicide Squad and Amanda Waller kidnapping and deporting villains offworld in Countdown to Final Crisis. During their meeting, however, the Suicide Squad break into the building and arrests them. He is later seen on the Hell World in Salvation Run #2 (January 2008), confirming that he has indeed been deported off-world. He appears briefly during the final issue as the Parademons attack, and escapes the Hell Planet alive thanks to Lex Luthor's device. =DC Infinite Halloween Special= In the first issue of DC Infinite Halloween Special, Hatter recounts a first-person perspective story of a small boy whose parents are murdered before his eyes by a blood-sucking humanoid bat. The story follows closely the actual origin story of Batman, and is a close approximation of the Red Rain 'universe' (noted in the Countdown Presents: The Search for Ray Palmer series as Earth-43), wherein Batman is in fact a vampire. =Final Crisis= In the 2008 DC event Final Crisis, Dan Turpin has been approached by the Question with regards to a recent string of child disappearances related to a mysterious group called The Dark Side Club. Turpin subsequently discovers that the club is led by Darkseid, who has taken on a human form after the events of Death of the New Gods. He is gathering a group of children together and infusing them with the Anti-Life Equation as part of his broader plan to enslave and devastate the human race. In Final Crisis #2 (2008), Turpin discovers that Tetch played an instrumental role in assisting Darkseid in gathering the children together through the use of his mind-control hats. Turpin, overcome with a violent rage that he himself does not understand, viciously beats Tetch. Upon threats of brain damage, Tetch confesses that the children have been taken to Bl√ºdhaven. Confused and unsure of himself, Turpin then leaves and boards a bus to Bl√ºdhaven. The Final Crisis Secret Files also reveals that Darkseid's Justifiers helmets are a combination of Apokoliptic technology and the Hatter's mind control circuitry. =Secret Six Redux= Secret Six #6 (February 2009) reveals that Mad Hatter has hired the Six to break Tarantula out of Alcatraz, to deliver her as well as a \\"get out of Hell free\\" card created by Neron to Gotham City. Doing so has put the Six directly in the line of retribution from Junior, Ragdoll's psychotic sister. Junior believes that the Neron Card is key to saving her soul from eternal damnation, and will stop at nothing to reclaim it from Tarantula and the Six. It seems that Junior's wrath is not the motivation behind Tetch's hiring the Six to perform this mission. He has made it clear his intention is to ensure the Six safely reach Gotham. The story is ongoing, and Tetch's full plan has yet to be revealed, although it is made clear in the same issue that Tetch intends to murder each member of the Six as part of his revenge. Tetch observes as the Six battle Junior and his goons on Gotham Bridge and when the battle ceases he confronts them, telling them how they betrayed him. Rag Doll throws Tetch's hat over the edge and Tetch jumps off after it. =Batman: Life After Death= Tetch next shows up, seemingly uninjured from his battle with the Secret Six, working with The Penguin, who is planning on killing the new Black Mask. He assists Penguin in attaching a mind control device to a gas mask, which is placed on Batman's head to turn him into a puppet to assassinate Black Mask. The plot fails, and Batman recovers before killing Black Mask. Following this, Tetch is shown once again incarcerated in Arkham. He hires Deathstroke and the Titans to free him, and escapes just prior to a massive prison riot. =The New 52= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Jervis Tetch is portrayed as suffering from hypogonadism, which prevents him physically maturing. He begins taking testosterone-enhancing drugs that permanently impair his mental stability. His parents commit him to Arkham Asylum after he has a drug-induced psychotic breakdown, during which he begins referring to himself as \\"The Mad Hatter\\". He is eventually freed by the White Rabbit. He uses his mind control technology to make a passenger train full of people commit suicide, assisted by his henchmen, the Tweed Brothers.Batman: The Dark Knight #4 He then uses his technology to drive several Gothamites insane. Batman eventually foils his plan and throws him through a glass rooftop.Batman: The Dark Knight #6 Mad Hatter and the Tweed Brothers next appear after Black Mask escapes Arkham Asylum. When Black Mask attempts regain control over his False Face Society, he comes into conflict with the Mad Hatter, who sees Black Mask as a rival due to Black Mask's similar mind control abilities. Both the Mad Hatter and Black Mask engage in battle, only for Batman to intervene and subdue them both. The Mad Hatter resurfaces, selling his mind control hats all over Gotham and holding casting calls at his missile launch facility base, all to recreate a ‚Äúperfect day‚Äù he had years before at a theme park with his childhood sweetheart, Alice. He creates a replica of the theme park in his base and takes control of all the people he sold the hats to all to become the pedestrians in the park. He goes to Alice's house, where he finds to his dismay that she has become an alcoholic and a drug addict. He bludgeons her to death to ‚Äúput her out of her misery‚Äù. He attempts to cast a new Alice with ‚Äúmind controlled girls‚Äù, but ultimately kills them for falling short of his ideal. In frustration, he makes his mind control subjects walk into the sewer and drown themselves. The Mad Hatter becomes obsessed with Bruce Wayne's new girlfriend, Natalya Trusevich, and has the Tweed Brothers kidnap her. She spurns the Mad Hatter's advances, but he realizes she knows Batman‚Äôs secret identity and torture her for the information. In the end, she refuses to give the information, and he throws her out of a helicopter to her death. An enraged Batman hunts him down and nearly drowns him, only to revive him at the last minute when his conscience gets the better of him.Batman: The Dark Knight #15-21 In the Watchmen sequel Doomsday Clock, Mad Hatter is among the villains.Doomsday Clock #6 (July 2018). DC Comics. Characterization =Skills and abilities= While the Mad Hatter has no inherent superpowers, he is a brilliant 'neurotechnician' with considerable knowledge on how to dominate and control the human mind, either through hypnosis or direct technological means. Usually, the Hatter places his mind control devices in the brims of hats, but has been known to utilize other devices as well. More recently, he has been able to directly influence the minds of others at a distance without any apparent equipment. However, this is most likely not a newly emerging superhuman ability; more likely, his skill at miniaturizing and concealing technology, and advances upon his original technology, have probably allowed him to develop technology that permits him to use a device hidden upon his person (such as in his hat) to project mindcontrolling powers in the manner of a meta-human ability such as telepathic powers. The Mad Hatter is not above using his own inventions on himself, such as creating a hat that can cause him both extreme bliss, as well as return him to lucidity when he deems it necessary. Despite his small stature, the Mad Hatter has been known to exhibit surprising strength and agility from time to time. In the graphic novel Madness, the Mad Hatter is shown as impressively holding his own in a fistfight with Batman atop a moving train. =Appearance= The Mad Hatter has gone through many changes in his physical appearance over the years, but the basic look remains the same. In his debut, he was a very short brown (or auburn) haired man. When he reappeared in the early 1980s, he was depicted as of average height, with blond hair. In later years, he was short again but with white hair. Today, Tetch has red hair much like his impostor did, but his size and height still seem to vary. Constants throughout his depictions are a slightly overlarge head and (more recently) very large teeth. In Secret Six #6 (December 2006), Tetch claims to suffer from macrocephaly.Secret Six #6 (December 2006) Other characters named Mad Hatter =Impostor Mad Hatter= The impostor Mad Hatter After the real Jervis Tetch/Mad Hatter had been sent to Arkham Asylum following his debut, a very different Mad Hatter appeared; who claimed to be Jervis Tetch. This Mad Hatter first appeared in Detective Comics #230 in April 1956 by Bill Finger, and Sheldon Moldoff, and, unlike the original, was tall, red-headed, stocky built and sported a gaudy mustache.Detective Comics #230 He was primarily a thief who was obsessed with completing his private collection of hats from all nations, cultures, and historical periods. He often constructed various weaponry concealed inside his hats like flame-throwers and buzzsaws. The headgear he wanted most was, of course, Batman's cowl. In numerous attempts, he tried to de-cowl Batman.Batman #201Batman #292 After many tries, he was successful by spraying the cowl with a radioactive substance. Batman then went to nuclear lab and as he was preparing to leave, he set off the radiation detectors. He then had to remove it and handed it to one of Mad Hatter's henchmen who was disguised as one of the lab workers. No sooner did the Mad Hatter put it in his collection than Batman and Robin arrived. They had traced the cowl with their \\"super sensitive Geiger counter\\" in the Batplane. Later on, in Batman #297 (March 1978),the imposter Mad Hatter claimed to have gone straight, but that turned out to be a lie.Batman #297 In 1981, it was revealed that he was in fact an impostor when the real Jervis Tetch returned. The real Hatter claimed to have killed his impostor, but the impostor Mad Hatter reappeared alive in 1987 in Detective Comics #573, where he ended up being beaten by Batman.Detective Comics #573 He was treated to a cameo appearance in Secret Origins #44 (1989) where he is seen in his cell at Arkham making paper hats in the story \\"His Name is Clayface III\\". Upon seeing him, one Arkham guard tells another: \\"He could murder ya a thousand different ways if we let 'im have any real hat--! But that doesn't stop him from tryin'!\\"Secret Origins # 44 The impostor Mad Hatter appeared in batman #700 (2010) under the moniker \\"Hatman\\", as well as in a flashback to his Mad Hatter days.Batman #700 Other versions =Batman: Crimson Mist= In the Elseworlds tale Batman: Crimson Mist- the third part of the trilogy that began with Batman & Dracula: Red Rain, which saw Batman become a vampire, Mad Hatter makes a cameo during the vampire Batman's assault on Arkham Asylum, in which Batman kills and beheads him. =Batman Beyond= An aged version of Mad Hatter appears in the first issue of the 2010 Batman Beyond limited series. According to a now elderly Bruce Wayne, the Mad Hatter \\"burnt out\\" his mind years earlier during his final confrontation with Batman, and has since spent his days locked up in the mental institution wing of a hospital in Neo Gotham after Arkham Asylum closed down. By now, he has become harmless.Batman Beyond #2 In the Justice League Beyond story arc \\"Flashdrive\\", the Mad Hatter is portrayed as having died, presumably from old age. His body is kept in a vault beneath Wayne Manor with the rest of Batman's deceased rogues.Justice League Beyond: \\"Flashdrive\\" =Injustice: Gods Among Us= The Mad Hatter appears in Injustice: Gods Among Us, terrified of being removed from Arkham Asylum by the Justice League before vanishing thanks to Flash.Injustice: Gods Among Us #15 In Year Five, Mad Hatter meets with Black Mask, Bronze Tiger, Man-Bat, Scarecrow, and Tweedledum and Tweedledee until their meeting is crashed by Damian Wayne. The villains overwhelmed Damian until Deadman possesses Bronze Tiger where he defeats the villains and calls for help.Injustice: Gods Among Us: Year Five #14 =Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles= In the Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles crossover, the Mad Hatter is turned into a mutant rabbit by the Shredder, along with other mutated inmates of Arkham Asylum. After Shredder being defeated by Batman and the Turtles, the police scientists have managed to turn Jervis and the rest of inmates at Arkham back to normal and are currently in A.R.G.U.S. custody.Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #6. DC Comics/IDW =Batman: White Knight= Jervis Tetch appears in the 2017 series Batman: White Knight. This version‚Äôs technology is used by Jack Napier (who in this reality was a Joker who had been force fed an overdose of pills by Batman which temporarily cured him of his insanity) to control Clayface. Particles from Clayface‚Äôs body were then slipped into the drinks of other Batman villains so that Napier could control them by way of Clayface‚Äôs ability to control parts of his body that had been separated from him. He assists Neo Joker in stealing his technology back from Napier so she can control the villains, and he remains as her sidekick for the rest of the story. Reception The character of the Mad Hatter has been analyzed as a stereotypical depiction of a villainous European in fiction.Georg Drennig, \\"Otherness and the European as Villain and Antihero in American Comics,\\" in Comics as a Nexus of Cultures, eds. Mark Berninger, Jochen Ecke, and Gideon Haberkorn (Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland & Company, 2010) 129-131. In other media =Television= Live-action * The Mad Hatter appears in the 1960s live-action Batman series, played by actor David Wayne. He was based on the Mad Hatter from the comics at the time, who had not yet been revealed to be an impostor. His main weapon was his trick top hat, in which concealed a set of eyes that would pop up and shoot a hypnotic beam at his enemy, who would fall unconscious to the tune of the first five notes of \\"Rock-a-bye Baby\\". In \\"The Thirteenth Hat\\"/\\"Batman Stands Pat\\", Tetch kidnapped the jurors who had previously incarcerated him, along with their hats. He was also after Batman's cowl, his \\"thirteenth hat\\". He had a female accomplice named Lisa, who worked at a hat boutique. She helped Tetch kidnap her boss, who was one of the jurors who had helped put him away, and aided in the rest of his scheme to foil Batman and Robin. In the end though, he was defeated and sent back to prison. In \\"The Contaminated Cowl\\"/\\"The Mad Hatter Runs Afoul\\", Tetch tried to get at Batman's cowl with the use of radiation. He sprayed the Dark Knight's cowl with radioactive material, assuming that he would take it off for fear of being contaminated. The radiation turned the cowl pink, but Batman (having previously taken an Anti-Radiation Bat-pill) did not remove it, and Tetch was again defeated. Jervis Tetch was one of the few main villains who was known by both his real name and his criminal name in the 1960s Batman series. * The Mad Hatter appears in Gotham, portrayed by Benedict Samuel. This version of the character is a professional hypnotist who can control the minds of people by simply having them listen to his voice while using a \\"ticking\\" device. He may be obsessed with Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland as he dresses himself, his henchmen and some of his victims as characters of the book. He also creates a virus from his sister Alice's blood that turns people into homicidal maniacs. With help from his hired help in the form of the Tweed Brothers, Jervis tried to use the blood in the drinks at the Gotham Founders Dinner presided over by Mayor Oswald Cobblepot to drive them mad only for them to be defeated by police captain Nathaniel Barnes where Jervis and the Tweeds are remanded to Arkham Asylum. The Tweeds are an obvious reference to Tweedledum and Tweedledee of both Alice in Wonderland and DC's Batman comics. Through the Court of Owls, the League of Assassins finish Jervis' job which involved detonating a bomb that spread the virus throughout the detonated area. Gordon and Bullock had to harvest Jervis' blood in order to make an antidote. In season 4, he becomes part of a group of supervillains under the leadership of Jerome Valeska in order to help out with Jerome's grand scheme in sending Gotham into madness. Penguin even called him Mad Hatter. In season 5, Mad Hatter oversaw the chemical production at Ace Chemicals that was run by hypnotized Chessmen members which was stumbled upon by James Gordon and Leslie Thompkins. After Ecco subdued Gordon, Jeremiah had to improve his deaths of Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne re-enactment by having Mad Hatter hypnotize Gordon and Leslie into taking the place of the Thomas and Martha Wayne look-a- likes in the alley. Mad Hatter was instructed to have the hypnosis be deactivated when the pearls hit the ground; their deaths were prevented by Selina Kyle. * Jervis Tetch is mentioned in the 12th episode of the fifth season of The Flash, titled \\"Memorabilia\\"; according to Sherloque Wells, he is a resident of Earth-221, and is known as the \\"Mad Hatter Killer\\", using a memory machine on his victims until they become brain dead. * It is rumoured that Mad Hatter would appear in season 2 of Batwoman. Possibly a love interest to Alice. Animation * The Mad Hatter also made an appearance in a 1968 episode of The Batman/Superman Hour titled \\"A Mad, Mad Tea Party\\" voiced by Ted Knight. Though the series was inspired by the 1960s show, the Mad Hatter is indeed a very different character from the one David Wayne portrayed. The Mad Hatter no longer brands a mustache and is more Alice in Wonderland- obsessed than hat-obsessed. In the episode, the Mad Hatter schemes to steal a priceless antique teapot from a museum so he can use it for his 'mad, mad tea party'. He also has trained white rabbits, a top-hat-shaped getaway car, and henchmen dressed as various Wonderland characters like Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Mock Turtle, Cheshire Cat, Knave of Hearts, and White Rabbit. * The Mad Hatter is featured in multiple series set in the DC Animated Universe, voiced by Roddy McDowall. ** In Batman: The Animated Series, the Mad Hatter is depicted as an English, average-sized man with blonde hair and a large overbite. Debuting in the episode \\"Mad as a Hatter\\", the shy and kind Jervis Tetch is a technical and electronic genius who experiments with animals using mind-controlling microchips stored within hats to stimulate brain waves. He is in love with his secretary, the aptly-named Alice Pleasance, which is the real name of Lewis Carroll's inspiration for Alice in Wonderland, (voiced by Kimmy Robertson), who does not reciprocate his feelings. Donning the guise of the Mad Hatter, he attempts to win Alice's affection by taking her out on the town after her boyfriend dumps her. She misinterprets the gesture, however, as simply a way to cheer her up, and unwittingly spurns his affections. Driven over the edge, he uses his mind control microchips to turn Alice into his robot-like puppet. Batman defeats the Mad Hatter by dropping a Jabberwocky ornament hanging over him. Paul Dini, who wrote this episode, once claimed that it was inspired by a true story involving a technical designer who had unrequited feelings for someone at work, so he committed a workplace shooting. In \\"Perchance to Dream\\", Tetch uses an electronic helmet to trap Batman in a virtual reality realm which gives him his greatest desires: freedom from the burdens of being Batman, his parents alive and well, and a relationship with Selina Kyle (the virtual reality experience is entirely within Batman's mind; Tetch is unable to observe it and thus fails to learn Batman's secret identity and other depicted details of his life). When Batman finally frees himself from the equipment, he demands to know why Tetch had used the machine rather than simply kill him; the Mad Hatter retorts that he simply wanted Batman out of his life, and was willing to give him whatever life he wanted in return. The Mad Hatter is then taken into custody by the police. He appears in the beginning and ending scenes of \\"Joker's Wild\\", both of which take place in the Arkham Asylum lounge where he is playing chess with Scarecrow and joins him and Poison Ivy in complaining when the Joker changes the channel. In \\"The Worry Men\\", he creates \\"worry men\\" dolls implanted with his mind-control chips, and uses them to hypnotize Gotham City's elite into giving him large sums of money. Batman stops him, however, and gives him his own \\"Worry Man\\" to stop him from committing further crimes. In \\"Trial\\", he enthralls all Arkham staff members into a catatonic state so that the residential inmates can put a captured Batman on trial for his \\"crimes\\" against them with the trial being presided by Joker. As a member of the jury, Mad Hatter was the jury foreman who told Joker the verdict of \\"not guilty\\". As Joker plans to have Batman killed and unmasked, Mad Hatter assisted the Arkham inmates into trying to catch Batman until the police storm Arkham Asylum and stop the prisoners. In \\"Make 'Em Laugh\\", he sells some of these chips to the Joker, who subsequently plants one on him to prevent him from telling the authorities who he sold them to, Batman later found Mad Hatter under catatonic control of his own mind- control chips. ** In The New Batman Adventures, the character was redesigned as a very short, thin, rodent-like man with a paler complexion; the blond hair was changed to a more white/greyish color. His outfit, including his hat, was now a dark green color. In \\"Animal Act\\", he takes control of the animals, and later the performers, at Haley's Circus, where Dick Grayson performed with his family as a child. ** The Mad Hatter also makes an appearance in the Superman: The Animated Series episode \\"Knight Time\\". When Bruce Wayne is hypnotized by mind-controlling nanites, everyone assumes the Mad Hatter is responsible. Superman (posing as Batman) and Robin end up finding the Mad Hatter in a meeting with Bane and Riddler to decide how best to take advantage of Batman's disappearance. After defeating Bane and Riddler, Superman and Robin apprehend Mad Hatter, Hatter being no match for Superman's speed. He uses his expertise in nanotechnology to show them that the nanites are not his, but of extraterrestrial origin. They later turn out to have been created by Brainiac. ** In Batman Beyond episode \\"Black Out\\", the Mad Hatter's top hat can be seen in a glass display at the Batcave. Albeit the character doesn't physically appear, when asked about the Mad Hatter's fate, show's creator Paul Dini jokingly stated that he along with the Riddler reformed and started running a men's clothing store.ToyFare issue, 1999 * The 1960s Impostor Mad Hatter appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold. In the episode \\"Day of the Dark Knight\\", he is seen as an inmate at Iron Heights Penitentiary, where he, along with other Batman-villains, were defeated by Batman and Green Arrow. He later makes cameo appearances in \\"Legends of the Dark Mite\\", \\"Mayhem of the Music Meister\\", and \\"Chill of the Night\\". A version of his mesmerizing hat made an appearance as well, as a trophy in the episode \\"A Bat Divided\\". * Mad Hatter makes his first appearance in the Young Justice Outsiders, voiced by Dwight Schultz. In the episode \\"Triptych\\", Robin, Spoiler, Arrowette, and Orphan track down Clayface disguised as the Hatter in order to find the real one's location. Though they catch up to him, the Mad Hatter escapes with a young man he was experimenting on. They later inform Wonder Woman that Sportsmaster released Shade, so Tetch could implant him with his mind control tech before turning him over to Cheshire. * Mad Hatter's hat appears as one of Dr Trap's items behind glass barriers in the Harley Quinn adult animated series. =Film= * The Mad Hatter was considered by Mark Protosevich as one of the lead choices to be the main antagonist of Batman Unchained, the unproduced third Joel Schumacher Batman film, but was dropped in favor of the Scarecrow and Harley Quinn. Rowan Atkinson could play this character. * The Mad Hatter appears in Batman: Bad Blood, voiced by Robin Atkin Downes. He is one of Talia al Ghul's henchmen. Tetch has once used his abilities to shape the previously empty mind of Heretic (a clone of Damian Wayne) into a perfect soldier for his master's organization the League of Assassins. After Batman is captured by the Heretic and taken into their headquarters, the Mad Hatter reprograms his brain into devotedly following Talia al Ghul's orders and revealing all of his and his allies' secrets. With Batman's help, the League of Assassins infiltrates the World Tech Summit in Gotham hosted by Bruce Wayne and takes over Wayne Enterprises' technologies. Tetch starts to brainwash all the attending politicians and dignitaries into obeying Talia. However, he is killed by a system overload caused in the ensuing battle between Batman's allies and Talia's henchmen halting the process. The overload causes his head to explode. * The Mad Hatter makes a cameo appearance in Batman Unlimited: Mechs vs. Mutants voiced by Alastair Duncan. He is seen as an inmate of Arkham Asylum, believing himself to be free of his cell. * Mad Hatter made a cameo appearance in the 2016 animated film Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders (which is a continuation of the Adam West 1966 Batman TV series). He along with the other supervillains team up with Robin and Catwoman in order to stop a group of cloned rogue Batmen. * The Impostor Mad Hatter makes a cameo appearance in the 2018 crossover film Scooby-Doo! & Batman: The Brave and the Bold as an Arkham inmate. =Video games= Lego Batman * The Mad Hatter appears in Lego Batman: The Videogame with his vocal effects provided by Chris Edgerly. He appears as an enemy of Batman, a helper of the Joker, and the first boss of Chapter 3 \\"The Joker's Return.\\" In the game, Mad Hatter is armed with a small handgun, and his special abilities are double-jumping (thanks to a propeller built into his hat) and mind-control.Game Informer features a two-page gallery of the many heroes and villains who appear in the game with a picture for each character and a descriptive paragraph. In the Nintendo DS version, the Mad Hatter can go through travel-chutes and can implant demolition-canisters. He can be unlocked in the level of \\"Joker's Last Laugh\\" in the chapter dubbed \\"The Chemical Factory\\" See \\"LEGO Batman: Character Gallery\\", Game Informer 186 (October 2008): 93. He appears to be gathering toxic waste needed for the Joker's laughing gas. The player needs to activate the trap door that he stands on to make him fall into the toxic waste. If he uses mind-control on one character, the player has to switch characters to attack him. When he's defeated, Batman pounds his hat over his eyes and he and Robin drag him out of the building and toss him on the ground while he tries to take his hat off. In the ending, he's seen in Arkham Asylum having tea at a table and petting a bunny. He is the only lieutenant of the Joker that is not given a mission in the villain campaign, and is thus 1 of 2 villain bosses that's only unlocked as a playable character by purchasing him from the Batcomputer after Batman and Robin defeat him, the other being Man-Bat. * The Mad Hatter appears in Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes voiced by Townsend Coleman. During the game, there is a massive breakout at the Arkham Asylum in which the Mad Hatter escapes. He is an optional side boss in which he is seen getting ready to rob Gotham Theater. His opening catchphrase is \\"Mad? me?! Oh, very well then.\\" Once Batman and Robin show up to stop him, he uses hypnotic suggestions to make them believe white rabbits are fighting them. After the duo defeat the rabbits, they take down Mad Hatter. He is then available to purchase. * The Mad Hatter appears as a playable character in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, voiced by Nolan North. In one of Batgirl's side-quests in the Hall of Justice, she states that he's selling mind-control hats that the player needs to attack, but he himself doesn't appear in the side-quest. Once the player attacks everyone wearing his hats, Mad Hatter's available to purchase. *Mad Hatter‚Äôs hat store can be found in The Lego Batman Movie adventure world in Lego Dimensions. His voice can be heard near the store, advertising his hats. * The Mad Hatter appears as a playable character in Lego DC Super-Villains, via the \\"Batman: The Animated Series Level Pack\\" DLC. Batman: Arkham The Mad Hatter appears in the Batman: Arkham series where he is voiced by Peter MacNicol. * According to Batman: Arkham Asylum writer Paul Dini, the Mad Hatter was originally planned to be featured in the game in a level where Batman discovers him in a child's hedge maze within the Botanical Gardens, while Poison Ivy controls her plants to slow Batman down. Nevertheless, the idea didn't really fit the tone of the game so the Mad Hatter's appearance in the game was dropped. Although the character didn't appear in the game, Batman can find some tea cups and some tea plates, possibly placed by the Hatter. * In his first physical appearance in Batman: Arkham City, it is revealed that he was being manipulated by Hugo Strange into conducting inhumane behavior control experiments on Arkham Asylum patients for the latter's selfish purposes. Strange even goes so far as to provide him with a consistent supply of tea and preys on his obsession with murdering young women, whom the Hatter claims are living incarnations of the namesake character from Alice in Wonderland. Mind control formulas resulting from these experimental procedures are implied to be used in brainwashing members of a private military company subsequently contracted to handle security for the new Arkham City, a segregated zone for Gotham's criminal element. During the game's storyline, Batman is implanted with a post-hypnotic suggestion which causes him to blunder straight into Tetch's hands. The Mad Hatter poisons his opponent using powerful psychoactive drugs mixed within tea, bringing on fearsome hallucinations, but Hatter's attempt to control Batman fails even after he puts a brainwashing mask on Batman, the Dark Knight defeating his brainwashed minions before smashing Hatter's hat and beating him unconscious. If visited later, the Hatter will mourn for the state of his hat and cry about only wanting a friend. If Catwoman visits, she says Strange \\"did a real number on you\\" (since Tetch didn't recognize her), and lie about going to search for Alice. * In Batman: Arkham Origins, the Mad Hatter sends brainwashed minions to greet Batman and contacts the Dark Knight over the radio, offering him an \\"employment opportunity\\"; he seems to have a better grasp of reality at this point, being a few years before Arkham City, since he introduced himself by his real name, Jervis Tetch. Batman tracks Tetch to his hat shop, where the Hatter is annoyed his mind control isn't perfected yet (he can't get his minions to refer to him as \\"sir\\" when addressing him), but is happy that he can force people to pay attention to him now; he was previously overlooked and ignored. When Batman confronts him, Tetch hypnotises him into seeing \\"Wonderland\\"; he explains that \\"the Queen's forces\\" are seeking to take \\"Alice\\" away from him, so he thought \\"who better to protect Alice than the Batman?\\" Batman fights his way through the illusion and Tetch's minions, saving the Hatter's latest \\"Alice\\" with a Reverse Batarang that knocks the lunatic out. Even after Batman calls the police, Tetch will remain unconscious in the shop while his saved victim continues crying. * In Batman: Arkham Knight, the Mad Hatter's top hat and the two rabbit mask worn by his henchmen appear in the evidence room at the Gotham City Police Department. According to Aaron Cash, the Mad Hatter was let go after the Arkham City incident. Mad Hatter appears in the \\"Season of Infamy\\" downloadable content (DLC) from the game's Season Pass in the side mission \\"Wonderland.\\" Jervis Tetch is taken in for interrogation at Batman's hands. In his own cryptic and poetic manner, Mad Hatter reveals that he took three hostages before being captured and leaves a clue for Batman to \\"listen for the siren's song,\\" obviously alluding to a police siren. Batman finds Officer Katz (who is masked as the Cheshire Cat) and Officer McQueen (who is masked as the Queen of Hearts). The final hostage appears in the police station after the last car is found with a book in the trunk titled \\"Batman's Adventures in Wonderland,\\" prompting a confrontation with the Hatter in the interrogation room. Batman is drawn into a hallucination which recalls his experiences in the Asylum, Arkham City, and the events of the current game in a storybook setting. Though the Hatter attempts to trick Batman into killing Officer Hutch (in a White Rabbit mask), he breaks free from the illusion and incarcerates Tetch who continues to declare his desire to have Batman as his \\"Alice\\". Other games * The Mad Hatter is a boss in the videogame dubbed The Adventures of Batman & Robin for the Sega Genesis. In the game, he takes over the Gotham theatre, turns it into a surreal virtual Wonderland, and commands an army of robots based on characters from the books. His appearance, while based on that of the character from Batman: The Animated Series, also sports elongated eyelashes on his left eye, a reference to Alex DeLarge, the main character of A Clockwork Orange. * The Mad Hatter appears in DC Universe Online voiced by Aaron Mace. *The Mad Hatter is among many other DC characters included in Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure. =Miscellaneous= * In The Batman Adventures, the storyline from \\"Mad as a Hatter\\" is continued off screen in comic #17 entitled \\"But A Dream\\", wherein the Mad Hatter tries to force Alice to marry him with a mind-control chip, but Robin manages to force the Dream Inducer onto Tetch's head, which inadvertently causes a permanent mental break with reality. Tetch is returned to Arkham a vegetable, but happy, as in his mind he lives out the life he always wanted with Alice (presumably these events follow those features in the TV series).The Batman Adventures #17 * Mad Hatter appears in the Justice League Unlimited spin-off comic book; in this, his last appearance in the DC Animated Universe, it was revealed that years of using his mind-controlling technology had rotted his mind and driven him mad.Justice League Unlimited #8 See also * List of Batman Family adversaries References External links Category:DC Comics male supervillains Category:Fictional characters with schizophrenia Category:Fictional hypnotists and indoctrinators Category:Fictional neuroscientists Category:Comics characters introduced in 1948 Category:Comics characters introduced in 1956 Category:Characters created by Sheldon Moldoff Category:Characters created by Bob Kane Category:Characters created by Bill Finger Category:Golden Age supervillains Category:Video game bosses Category:DC Comics television characters Category:Fictional kidnappers Category:Male characters in comics Category:Male characters in film Category:Male characters in television Category:Fictional characters with obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder Category:Fictional mad scientists Category:Fictional pedophiles ","title":"Mad Hatter (DC Comics)"},{"id":"866434","text":"See also: 1990 Canadian incumbents, 1992 Canadian incumbents Crown *Head of State - Queen Elizabeth II Federal government *Governor General - Ray Hnatyshyn =Cabinet= *Prime Minister - Brian Mulroney *Deputy Prime Minister - Don Mazankowski *Minister of Finance - Michael Wilson then Don Mazankowski *Secretary of State for External Affairs - Joe Clark then Barbara McDougall *Minister of National Defence - Bill McKnight then Marcel Masse *Minister of National Health and Welfare - Perrin Beatty then Beno√Æt Bouchard *Minister of Industry, Science and Technology - Beno√Æt Bouchard then Michael Wilson *Minister of the Environment - Robert de Cotret then Jean Charest *Minister of Justice - Kim Campbell *Minister of Transport - Doug Lewis then Jean Corbeil *Minister of Communications - Marcel Masse then Perrin Beatty *Minister of Fisheries and Oceans - Bernard Valcourt then John Crosbie *Minister of Agriculture - Don Mazankowski then Bill McKnight *Minister of Public Works - Elmer MacKay *Minister of Employment and Immigration - Barbara McDougall then Bernard Valcourt *Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources - Jake Epp *Minister of Forestry - Frank Oberle *Minister of Veterans Affairs - Gerry Merrithew Parliament See: 34th Canadian parliament =Party leaders= *Progressive Conservative Party of Canada - Brian Mulroney *Liberal Party of Canada - Jean Chr√©tien *Bloc Qu√©b√©cois - Lucien Bouchard *New Democratic Party- Audrey McLaughlin *Reform Party of Canada - Preston Manning =Supreme Court justices= *Chief Justice: Antonio Lamer *Beverley McLachlin *Bertha Wilson then Frank Iacobucci *William Stevenson *G√©rard V.

Description The Datamaster is an all-in-one computer with text-mode CRT display, keyboard, processor, memory, and two 8-inch floppy disk drives in one cabinet. The processor is an 8-bit Intel 8085, with bank switching to manage 256 kB of memory. The intention of the Datamaster was to provide a computer that could be installed and operated without specialists. A BASIC interpreter was built-in to the system. IBM decided to merge the Datamaster's BASIC implementation with System/34 BASIC, which reportedly delayed the Datamaster by almost a year. When introduced, a single-screen Datamaster sold for around . A second keyboard and screen could be attached in an extended configuration. The Datamaster was the least expensive IBM computer until the far less expensive and far more popular PC. Influence on later IBM systems The familiarity of the design group gained on the Datamaster project encouraged selection of an Intel CPU for the IBM PC, announced one month after the Datamaster. The delay caused by the decision to reuse System/34 BASIC in the Datamaster encouraged IBM's selection of Microsoft BASIC for the PC. A number of components from the Datamaster were reused in the later IBM. The PC's expansion bus, later known as the ISA bus, was based on the Datamaster's I/O bus. The Datamaster's Model F keyboard with its IBM 5250 style layout was also reused in the PC, albeit with a serial interface (instead of the parallel one used on the Datamaster) and a new external housing.

The main coalition partners were Prussia and Russia with Saxony, Sweden, and Great Britain also contributing. Excluding Prussia, some members of the coalition had previously been fighting France as part of the Third Coalition, and there was no intervening period of general peace. On 9 October 1806, Prussia joined a renewed coalition, fearing the rise in French power after the defeat of Austria and establishment of the French- sponsored Confederation of the Rhine. Prussia and Russia mobilized for a fresh campaign with Prussia massing troops in Saxony. Edouard Driault, \\"The coalition of Europe against Napoleon.\\" American Historical Review 24.4 (1919): 603-624 online. Napoleon decisively defeated the Prussians in an expeditious campaign that culminated at the Battle of Jena‚ÄìAuerstedt on 14 October 1806. French forces under Napoleon occupied Prussia, pursued the remnants of the shattered Prussian Army, and captured Berlin. They then advanced all the way to East Prussia, Poland and the Russian frontier, where they fought an inconclusive battle against the Russians at the Battle of Eylau on 7‚Äì8 February 1807. Napoleon's advance on the Russian frontier was briefly checked during the spring as he revitalized his army with fresh supplies. Russian forces were finally crushed by the French at the Battle of Friedland on 14 June 1807, and three days later Russia asked for a truce. David G. Chandler, Jena 1806: Napoleon Destroys Prussia (Osprey, 1993). Through the Treaties of Tilsit in July 1807, France made peace with Russia, which agreed to join the Continental System. The treaty was particularly harsh on Prussia, however, as Napoleon demanded much of the Prussian territory along the lower Rhine west of the Elbe and in what was part of the former Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. Respectively, these acquisitions were incorporated into the new Kingdom of Westphalia, led by his brother J√©r√¥me Bonaparte. He also established the Duchy of Warsaw, ruled by his new ally the king of Saxony. At the end of the war Napoleon was master of almost all of western and central continental Europe, except for Spain, Portugal, Austria and several other smaller states. Despite the end of the Fourth Coalition, Britain remained at war with France. Hostilities on land resumed later in 1807, when a Franco-Spanish force invaded Britain's ally Portugal, beginning the Peninsular War. A further Fifth Coalition would be assembled when Austria re-joined the conflict in 1809. Origins The Fourth Coalition (1806‚Äì1807) of Great Britain, Prussia, Russia, Saxony, and Sweden formed against France within months of the collapse of the previous coalition. Following his triumph at the Battle of Austerlitz and the subsequent demise of the Third Coalition, Napoleon looked forward to achieving a general peace in Europe, especially with his two main remaining antagonists, Britain and Russia. Meanwhile, he sought to isolate Prussia from the influence of these two powers by offering a tentative alliance, while also seeking to curb Prussia's political and military influence among the German states. Despite the death of William Pitt in January 1806, Britain and the new Whig administration remained committed to checking the growing power of France. Peace overtures between the two nations early in the new year proved ineffectual due to the still unresolved issues that had led to the breakdown of the Peace of Amiens. One point of contention was the fate of Hanover, a German electorate in personal union with the British monarchy that had been occupied by France since 1803. Dispute over this state would eventually become a casus belli for both Britain and Prussia against France. This issue also dragged Sweden into the war, whose forces had been deployed there as part of the effort to liberate Hanover during the war of the previous coalition. The path to war seemed inevitable after French forces ejected the Swedish troops in April 1806. Prussian Gardes du Corps, wishing to provoke war, ostentatiously sharpen their swords on the steps of the French embassy in Berlin in the autumn of 1805 Apart from some naval clashes and the peripheral Battle of Maida in southern Italy in July 1806 (though these actions are considered part of the tail end of the War of the Third Coalition), the main conflicts between Britain and France during the Fourth Coalition would involve no direct general military confrontation. Rather, there was an escalation in the ongoing economic warfare between the two powers. With Britain still retaining its dominance of the seas, Napoleon looked to break this dominance (after his defeat of Prussia) with his issuance of the Berlin Decree and the beginnings of his Continental System. Britain retaliated with its Orders in Council several months later. William M. Sloane, \\"The Continental System of Napoleon.\\" Political Science Quarterly 13.2 (1898): 213-231 online. In the meantime, Russia spent most of 1806 recovering from defeats from the previous year's campaign. Napoleon had hoped to establish peace with Russia and a tentative peace treaty was signed in July 1806, but this was vetoed by Tsar Alexander I and the two powers remained at war. Though nominally an ally in the coalition, Russia remained a dormant entity for much of the year (giving virtually no military aid to Prussia in the main battles that October, as Russian armies were still mobilising). Russian forces would not fully come into play in the war until late 1806 when Napoleon entered Poland. The participants of the War of the Fourth Coalition. Blue: The Coalition and their colonies and allies. Green: The First French Empire, its protectorates, colonies and allies. Finally, Prussia had remained at peace with France the previous year, though it did come close to joining the Allies in the Third Coalition. A French corps led by Marshal Bernadotte had illegally violated the neutrality of Ansbach in Prussian territory on their march to face the Austrians and Russians. Anger by Prussia at this trespass was quickly tempered by the results of Austerlitz, and a convention of continued peace with France was signed two weeks after that battle at Sch√∂nbrunn. This convention was modified in a formal treaty two months later, with one clause in effect promising to give Hanover to Prussia in exchange for Ansbach's being awarded to France's ally Bavaria. In addition, on 15 March 1806 Napoleon elevated his brother-in-law Marshal Joachim Murat to become ruler of the Grand Duchy of Berg and Cleves (acquired from Bavaria in return for its receiving Ansbach). Murat exacerbated Prussian enmity by tactlessly ejecting a Prussian garrison that was stationed in his newly acquired realm, prompting a stern rebuke from Napoleon. Relations between France and Prussia quickly soured when Prussia eventually discovered that Napoleon had secretly promised to return sovereignty of Hanover back to Britain during his abortive peace negotiations with the British. This duplicity by the French would be one of the main causes for Prussia declaring war that autumn. Another cause was Napoleon's formation in July 1806 of the Confederation of the Rhine out of the various German states which constituted the Rhineland and other parts of western Germany. A virtual satellite of the French Empire with Napoleon as its \\"Protector\\", the Confederation was intended to act as a buffer state from any future aggressions from Austria, Russia or Prussia against France (a policy that was an heir of the French revolutionary doctrine of maintaining France's \\"natural frontiers\\"). The formation of the Confederation was the final nail in the coffin of the moribund Holy Roman Empire and subsequently its last Habsburg emperor, Francis II, changed his title to simply Francis I, Emperor of Austria. Napoleon consolidated the various smaller states of the former Holy Roman Empire which had allied with France into larger electorates, duchies and kingdoms to make the governance of non-Prussian and Austrian Germany more efficient. He also elevated the electors of the two largest Confederation states, his allies W√ºrttemberg and Bavaria, to the status of kings. The Confederation was above all a military alliance: in return for continued French protection, member states were compelled to supply France with large numbers of their own military personnel (mainly to serve as auxiliaries to the Grande Arm√©e), as well as contribute much of the resources needed to support the French armies still occupying western and southern Germany. Understandably, Prussia was indignant at this increasing French meddling in the affairs of Germany (without its involvement or even consultation) and viewed it as a threat. Napoleon had previously attempted to ameliorate Prussian anxieties by assuring Prussia he was not adverse to its heading a North German Confederation, but his duplicity regarding Hanover dashed this. A final spark leading to war was the summary arrest and execution of German nationalist Johann Philipp Palm in August 1806 for publishing a pamphlet which strongly attacked Napoleon and the conduct of his army occupying Germany. After giving Napoleon an ultimatum on 1 October 1806, Prussia (supported by Saxony) finally decided to contend militarily with the French Emperor. F. L. Petre, Napoleon's Conquest of Prussia--1806 (1914) pp v-vii online. Prussian campaign Queen Louise Influenced by his wife Queen Louise and the war party in Berlin, in August 1806 the Prussian king Friedrich Wilhelm III made the decision to go to war independently of any other great power, save the distant Russia. Another course of action might have involved openly declaring war the previous year and joining Austria and Russia in the Third Coalition. In fact, the Tsar had visited the Prussian king and queen at the tomb of Frederick the Great in Potsdam that very autumn, and the monarchs secretly swore to make common cause against Napoleon. Had Prussian forces been engaged against the French in 1805, this might have contained Napoleon and prevented the eventual Allied disaster at Austerlitz. In any event, Prussia vacillated in the face of the swift French invasion of Austria and then hastily professed neutrality once the Third Coalition was crushed. When Prussia did eventually declare war against France in 1806, its main ally the Russians still remained far away remobilising. The electorate of Saxony would be Prussia's sole German ally. Napoleon could scarcely believe Prussia would be so foolish to take him on in a straight fight with hardly any allies at hand on its side, especially since most of his Grande Arm√©e was still in the heart of Germany close to the Prussian border. He drummed up support from his soldiers by declaring that Prussia's bellicose actions had delayed their phased withdrawal back home to France to enjoy praise for the previous year's victories. Once hostilities seemed inevitable in September 1806, Napoleon unleashed all French forces east of the Rhine, deploying the corps of the Grande Arm√©e along the frontier of southern Saxony. In a preemptive strike to catch the Prussians unaware, the Emperor had the Grande Arm√©e march as a massive bataillon carr√© (battalion square) in three parallel columns through the Franconian Forest in southern Thuringia. Each corps would be in mutual supporting distance of each other, both within the column and laterally to the other columns (once through the difficult passage of the forest), thus allowing the Grand Arm√©e to meet the enemy at any contingency. This strategy was adopted due to Napoleon's lack of intelligence regarding the Prussian main army's whereabouts and uncertainty over his enemy's puzzling manoeuvres in their march to face him. The reason for this stemmed mainly from the mutual mistrust within the Prussian high command that had resulted in division among the Prussian commanders over which plan of action for the war would be adopted. Despite the deficiency in pinpointing the main Prussian army's exact position, Napoleon correctly surmised their probable concentration in the vicinity of Erfurt and formulated a general plan of a thrust down the Saale valley, enveloping the left flank of where he believed the Prussians were located and thus cutting off their communications and line of retreat to Berlin. Jena-Auerstedt Campaign, October 1806 In the first clash on 9 October 1806, a Prussian division was brushed aside in the Battle of Schleiz. The following day, Marshal Lannes crushed a Prussian division at Saalfeld, where the popular Prince Louis Ferdinand was killed. At the double Battle of Jena- Auerstedt on 14 October, Napoleon smashed a Prussian army led by Frederick Louis, Prince of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen and Ernst von R√ºchel at Jena, while his Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout routed Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick's main army at Auerstedt. At Jena, Napoleon fought only a contingent of the Prussian army. At Auerstedt a single French corps defeated the bulk of the Prussian army, despite being heavily outnumbered. Victory at Auerstedt was all but secured once the Duke of Brunswick (as well as fellow commander Friedrich Wilhelm Carl von Schmettau) were mortally wounded, and the Prussian command devolved to the less able King. Matters were worsened once the vanquished remnants of the Prussian army from Jena stumbled onto the clash at Auerstedt, further plunging the Prussians' morale and triggering their precipitous retreat. For this conspicuous victory, Marshal Davout was later created the Duke of Auerstedt by Napoleon. On 17 October, Marshal Jean- Baptiste Bernadotte (redeeming himself somewhat for his inexplicable absence from either battle on the 14th) mauled Eugene Frederick Henry, Duke of W√ºrttemberg's previously untouched Reserve corps at the Battle of Halle and chased it across the Elbe River. The Siege of Danzig, 1807 Some 160,000 French soldiers fought against Prussia (increasing in number as the campaign went on, with reinforcements arriving across the Wesel bridgehead from the peripheral theatre surrounding the recently formed Kingdom of Holland) advancing with such speed that Napoleon was able to destroy as an effective military force the entire quarter of a million-strong Prussian army. The Prussians sustained 65,000 casualties (including the deaths of two members of the royal family) lost a further 150,000 prisoners, over 4,000 artillery pieces, and over 100,000 muskets stockpiled in Berlin. The French suffered around 15,000 casualties for the whole campaign. Napoleon entered Berlin on 27 October 1806 and visited the tomb of Frederick the Great, telling his marshals to show their respect, saying, \\"If he were alive we wouldn't be here today\\". In total, Napoleon and the Grande Arm√©e had taken only 19 days from the commencement of the invasion of Prussia until essentially knocking it out of the war with the capture of Berlin and the destruction of its principal armies at Jena and Auerstedt. Most of the shattered remnants of the Prussian army (and the displaced royal family) escaped to refuge in Eastern Prussia near K√∂nigsberg, eventually to link up with the approaching Russians and continue the fight. Meanwhile, Saxony was elevated to a kingdom on 11 December 1806 upon allying with France and joining the Confederation of the Rhine, thereby leaving the Allied Coalition. In Berlin, Napoleon issued the Berlin Decree on 21 November 1806 to bring into effect the Continental System. This policy aimed to control the trade of all European countries (without consulting their governments). The ostensible goal was to weaken the British economy by closing French- controlled territory to its trade, but British merchants smuggled in many goods and the Continental System was not a powerful weapon of economic war.Schroeder, The Transformation of European Politics 1763‚Äì1848 (1994) pp 305‚Äì10 Polish, Russian and Swedish campaigns Aftermath of the Battle of Eylau Towards the end of 1806, the French entered Poland and Napoleon created a new Duchy of Warsaw, to be ruled by his new ally Frederick Augustus I of Saxony. The area of the duchy had already been liberated by a popular uprising that had escalated from anti-conscription rioting. Napoleon then turned north to confront the approaching Russian armies Maps of Napoleon's Campaign In Poland 1806‚Äì7. and to attempt to capture the temporary Prussian capital at K√∂nigsberg. A tactical draw at Eylau (7‚Äì8 February) forced the Russians to withdraw further north. Napoleon then routed the Russian army at Friedland (14 June). Following this defeat, Alexander sued for peace with Napoleon at Tilsit (7 July 1807). Meanwhile, Swedish involvement was primarily concerned with protecting Swedish Pomerania. Despite being defeated at L√ºbeck, the Swedes successfully defended the fort of Stralsund during its first siege in early 1807. On 18 April, France and Sweden agreed to a ceasefire, which led to the withdrawal of all French troops. However, Swedish refusal to join the Continental System led to a second invasion of Swedish Pomerania led by Marshal Brune. Stralsund fell on 24 August after a second siege and the Swedish army surrendered at R√ºgen, completing the occupation of Swedish Pomerania. The resulting peace treaty agreed by Marshal Brune and Swedish general Johan Christopher Toll, however, allowed the Swedish army to withdraw with all its munitions of war. Results Prussia (orange) and its territories lost at Tilsit (other colours) Following the Treaties of Tilsit, Britain and Sweden remained the only two major coalition members still at war with France. Russia soon declared war against Britain and after a British attack on Copenhagen, Denmark‚ÄìNorway joined the war on the side of Napoleon (Gunboat War), opening a second front against Sweden. A short British expedition under Sir John Moore was sent to Sweden (May 1808) to protect against any possible Franco-Danish invasion. At the Congress of Erfurt (September‚ÄìOctober 1808) Napoleon and Alexander agreed that Russia should force Sweden to join the Continental System, which led to the Finnish War of 1808‚Äì1809 (meaning Sweden played no role in the next coalition against Napoleon) and to the division of Sweden into two parts separated by the Gulf of Bothnia. The eastern part became the Russian Grand Duchy of Finland. Due to the Continental System, Britain was yet again still at war with Napoleon and was not affected by the peace treaty. In negotiations with captured Swedes after the Battle of L√ºbeck, Marshal Bernadotte first came to the attention of the Swedish authorities. This would set in motion a chain of events that eventually led to him being elected heir to the Swedish throne, and later King Charles XIV John of Sweden. As for the French, after the Treaty of Tilsit, the Empire was seemingly at its zenith. Flush with triumph and deeming France free from any immediate obligations in Central and Eastern Europe, Napoleon decided to capture the Iberian ports of Britain's long-time ally Portugal. His main aim was to close off another strip of the European coast and a major source for British trade. On 27 October 1807, Spain's Prime Minister Manuel de Godoy signed the Treaty of Fontainebleau with France, by which in return for the alliance and passage of French armies through its realm, Spain would receive Portuguese territory. In November 1807, after the refusal of Prince Regent John of Portugal to join the Continental System, Napoleon sent an army into Spain under General Jean-Andoche Junot with the aim of invading Portugal (as well as the secret task of being the vanguard for the eventual French occupation of Spain). Napoleon soon embroiled himself and France in Spain's internal power struggles within its royal family, eventually leading to the Spanish populace turning on the French occupiers and the beginning of the Peninsular War.

Literature, painting and travel were subjects particularly dear to Butor. Part of the fascination of his writing is the way it combines the rigorous symmetries that led Roland Barthes to praise him as an epitome of structuralism (exemplified, for instance, by the architectural scheme of Passage de Milan or the calendrical structure of L'emploi du temps) with a lyrical sensibility more akin to Baudelaire than to Robbe-Grillet.

Early life in Rhode Island Baldwin was born to John and Margaret (Williams) Baldwin in Coventry, Rhode Island and attended the common schools. He worked as a store clerk in Pawtucket from age 12 to age 20, after which he engaged in his own business for several years in Woonsocket. In 1835, he married Harriet M. Day (deceased 1862). He married his second wife, Sibyle Lambard, in 1864, who survived him. Life and politics in Michigan Baldwin moved to Detroit, Michigan, where he established a wholesale business in boots and shoes in 1838. He was a member of the convention which organized the U.S. Republican Party in Jackson, Michigan in 1854. He was influential in organizing the sixth Episcopal parish in the northern outskirts of Detroit on December 27, 1858, and in building St. John's Episcopal Church for the parish. Baldwin donated the church lot and underwrote a large portion of the cost of building a chapel to seat 125 persons (completed November 1859) and paid for the construction of the rectory. He also contributed in large part to the building of the larger 1300 seat nave, completed in 1861. He was the Senior Warden from the parish's founding until his death. He was director of the Michigan State Bank and president of the Second National Bank of Detroit, 1863-1887. For several years, he was also the director of the Eastern Asylum in Pontiac. He was a member of the Michigan State Senate, 2nd District, 1861-1862. He married his second wife, Sibyle Lambard, on November 21, 1866. In 1868, Baldwin was elected Governor of Michigan, serving from 1869 to 1873. He was appointed and subsequently elected as a Republican to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Zachariah Chandler, serving from November 17, 1879 to March 4, 1881 alongside Thomas W.

Erstwhile coalition members Prussia and Russia did not participate. Major engagements between France and Austria unfolded over much of Central Europe from April to July, with very high casualty rates for both sides. Britain, already involved on the European continent in the ongoing Peninsular War, sought to further assist the Austrian intervention by launching the Walcheren Campaign, although this effort had little impact on the outcome of the conflict.Paul W. Schroeder, The Transformation of European Politics, 1763-1848. p. 360. After much campaigning in Bavaria and across the Danube valley, the war ended favourably for the French after the bloody struggle at Wagram in early July. The resulting Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn was the harshest that France had imposed on Austria in recent memory. Metternich and Archduke Charles had the preservation of the Habsburg Empire as their fundamental goal, and to this end the former succeeded in making Napoleon seek more modest goals in return for promises of Franco- Austrian peace and friendship.Todd Fisher & Gregory Fremont-Barnes, The Napoleonic Wars: The Rise and Fall of an Empire. p. 144. Nevertheless, while most of the hereditary lands remained part of Habsburg territories, France received Carinthia, Carniola, and the Adriatic ports, while Galicia was given to the Poles and the Salzburg area of the Tyrol went to the Bavarians. Austria lost over three million subjects, about one-fifth of her total population,David G. Chandler, The Campaigns of Napoleon. p. 732. as a result of these territorial changes. After Austria's departure, Britain, Spain and Portugal remained at war with France in the ongoing Peninsular War. There was peace in central and eastern Europe until Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812, which led to the formation of the Sixth Coalition, which ended Napoleon's ten-year reign in 1814. Background Europe had been embroiled in warfare, pitting revolutionary France against a series of coalitions, nearly continuously since 1792. After five years of war, the French Republic subdued the First Coalition in 1797. A Second Coalition was formed in 1798, only to be defeated. In March 1802, France (now under Napoleon, as First Consul) and Great Britain, its one remaining enemy, agreed to end hostilities under the Treaty of Amiens. For the first time in ten years, all of Europe was at peace. However, many disagreements between the two sides remained unresolved, and implementing the agreements they had reached at Amiens seemed to be a growing challenge. Britain resented having to turn over all of its colonial conquests since 1793 when France was permitted to retain most of its conquered territory in Europe. France, meanwhile, was upset that British troops had not evacuated the island of Malta.Chandler p. 304. In May 1803, Britain and France resumed hostilities. =Third Coalition (1804‚Äì1805)= With the resumption of hostilities, Napoleon (proclaimed Emperor in 1804) planned an invasion of England, spending the better part of the next two years (1803‚Äì05) on this objective. In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish agreement led to the creation of the Third Coalition. British Prime Minister William Pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity geared towards forming a new coalition against France and neutralising the threat of invasion. Mutual suspicion between the British and the Russians eased in the face of several French political mistakes, and by April 1805, the two had signed a treaty of alliance.Chandler p. 328. The Baltic was dominated by Russia, a situation with which Britain was uncomfortable as the region provided valuable commodities like timber, tar, and hemp, crucial supplies to Britain's Empire. Additionally, Britain supported the Ottoman Empire against Russian incursions towards the Mediterranean. Meanwhile, French territorial rearrangements in Germany occurred without Russian consultation and Napoleon's annexations in the Po valley increasingly strained relations between the two. Alarmed by Napoleon's consolidation of northern Italy into a kingdom under his rule, and keen on revenge for having been defeated twice in recent memory by France, Austria would join the coalition a few months later.Chandler p. 331. In August 1805, the French Grande Arm√©e invaded the German states in hopes of knocking Austria out of the war before Russian forces could intervene. On 25 September, after great secrecy and feverish marching, 200,000Richard Brooks (editor), Atlas of World Military History. p. 108. French troops began to cross the Rhine on a front of 160 miles (260 km).Andrew Uffindell, Great Generals of the Napoleonic Wars. p. 15. Mack had gathered the greater part of the Austrian army at the fortress of Ulm in Bavaria. Napoleon hoped to swing his forces northward and perform a wheeling movement that would find the French at the Austrian rear. The Ulm Maneuver was well executed, and on 20 October Mack and 23,000 Austrian troops surrendered at Ulm, bringing the total number of Austrian prisoners in the campaign to 60,000. The French captured Vienna in November and went on to inflict a decisive defeat on a Russo-Austrian army at Austerlitz in early December. Austerlitz led to the expulsion of Russian troops from Central Europe and the humiliation of Austria, which signed the Treaty of Pressburg on 26 December. =Fourth Coalition (1806‚Äì1807)= Austerlitz incited a major shift in the European balance of power. Prussia felt threatened about her security in the region and, alongside Russia, went to war against France as part of the Fourth Coalition in 1806. One hundred and eighty thousand French troops invaded Prussia in the fall of 1806 through the Thuringian Forest, unaware of where the Prussians were, and hugged the right bank of the Saale river and the left of the Elster.David G. Chandler, The Campaigns of Napoleon. p. 469. The decisive actions took place on 14 October: with an army of 90,000, Napoleon crushed Hohenlohe at Jena, and Davout, commander of the III Corps, outdid everyone when his 27,000 troops held off and defeated the 63,000 Prussians under Brunswick and King Frederick William III at the Battle of Auerstadt.Chandler pp. 479‚Äì502. A vigorous French pursuit through Northern Germany finished off the remnants of the Prussian army. The French then invaded Poland, which had been partitioned among Prussia, Austria, and Russia in 1795, to meet the Russian forces that had not been able to save Prussia. The Russian and French armies met in February 1807 at the savage and indecisive Battle of Eylau, which left behind between 30,000‚Äì50,000 casualties. Napoleon regrouped his forces after the battle and continued to pursue the Russians in upcoming months. The action in Poland finally culminated on 14 June 1807, when the French mauled their Russian opponents at the Battle of Friedland. The resulting Treaty of Tilsit in July ended two years of bloodshed and left France as the dominant power on the European continent. It also severely weakened Prussia and formed a Franco-Russian axis designed to resolve disputes among European nations. =Iberian Peninsula (1807‚Äì1809)= After the War of the Oranges, Portugal adopted a double policy. On the one hand John, Prince of Brazil, as regent of Portugal, signed the Treaty of Badajoz with France and Spain by which he assumed the duty to close the ports to British trade. On the other hand, not wanting to breach the Treaty of Windsor (1386) with Portugal's oldest ally, Britain, he allowed for such trade to continue and maintained secret diplomatic relations with them. However, after the Franco-Spanish defeat in the Battle of Trafalgar, John grew bold and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with Britain. Unhappy with this change of policy of the Portuguese government, Napoleon sent an army to invade Portugal. On 17 October 1807, 24,000Todd Fisher & Gregory Fremont-Barnes, The Napoleonic Wars: The Rise and Fall of an Empire. p. 197. French troops under General Junot crossed the Pyrenees with Spanish cooperation and headed towards Portugal to enforce Napoleon's Continental System. This was the first step in what would become the six-year-long Peninsular War, a struggle that sapped much of the French Empire's strength. Throughout the winter of 1808, French agents became increasingly involved in Spanish internal affairs, attempting to incite discord between members of the Spanish royal family. On 16 February 1808, secret French machinations finally materialised when Napoleon announced that he would intervene to mediate between the rival political factions in the Spanish royal family.Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 198‚Äì99. Marshal Murat led 120,000 troops into Spain and the French arrived in Madrid on 24 March,Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 199. where wild riots against the occupation erupted a few weeks later. The resistance to French aggression soon spread throughout the country. A surprise French defeat at the Battle of Bail√©n in July gave hope to Napoleon's enemies and partly persuaded the French emperor to intervene in person. A new French army commanded by Napoleon crossed the Ebro in autumn and dealt blow after blow to the opposing Spanish forces. Napoleon entered Madrid on 4 December with 80,000 troops.Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 205. He then unleashed his troops against Moore's British forces. The British were swiftly driven to the coast, and, after a last stand at the Battle of Corunna in January 1809, withdrew from Spain entirely. =Austria rejoins the fight= Austria sought another confrontation with France to avenge the recent defeats, and the developments in Spain only encouraged its attitudes. However she lacked allies in central Europe; Russia, her main ally in 1805, had made peace with Napoleon at Tilsit and was engaged in wars with erstwhile allies Britain, Sweden and the Ottoman Empire in 1809. This also left Sweden pre-occupied and unable to rejoin the fight against Napoleon. Some in the government of Frederick William III of Prussia initially wanted to help Austria, but their hopes were dashed when Stein's correspondence with Austria, planning such a move, was intercepted by the French and resulted in Prussia being compelled to sign the crushing Convention of September 1808.Napoleon ‚Äì Felix Markham, p. 179 The British had been at war with the French Empire for six years. A report from the Austrian finance minister suggested that the treasury would run out of money by mid-1809 if the large army that the Austrians had formed since the Third Coalition remained mobilised. Although Charles warned that the Austrians were not ready for another showdown with Napoleon, a stance that landed him amidst the so-called \\"peace party\\", he did not want to see the army demobilised. On 8 February 1809, the advocates for war finally succeeded when the Imperial Government secretly decided to make war against France. =Austrian reforms= Austerlitz and the subsequent Treaty of Pressburg in 1805 had indicated that the Austrian army needed reform. Napoleon had offered Charles the Austrian throne after Austerlitz, an act that aroused deep suspicion from Charles' brother, Austrian emperor Francis II. Even though Charles was allowed to spearhead the reforms of the Austrian army, Francis kept the Hofkriegsrat (Aulic Council), a military advisory board, to oversee the activities of Charles as supreme commander.Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 108. In 1806, Charles issued a new guide for army and unit tactics. The main tactical innovation was the concept of the \\"mass\\", an anti-cavalry formation created by closing up the spacing between ranks. However, Austrian commanders disliked the innovation and rarely used it unless directly supervised by Charles. Following the failures at Ulm and Austerlitz, the Austrians went back to using the six- companies-per-battalion model, abandoning the four-company-per-battalion that had been introduced by Mack on the eve of war in 1805. Problems persisted despite the reforms. The Austrians lacked sufficient skirmishers to successfully contend with their French counterparts, the cavalry was often sprinkled into individual units throughout the army, preventing the shock and hitting power evident in the French system, and even though Charles imitated the French corps command structure, leaders in the Austrian military establishment were often wary of taking the initiative, relying heavily on written orders and drawn-out planning before they came to a decision.Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 108‚Äì09. Another reform was that Austria, having lost many officers, veteran and elite troops, and regulars, and unable to call on allies, embraced the Lev√©e en masse used earlier by the French. By this time, the French were moving from the Lev√©e en masse in favour of forming a regular army based on a core of battle-hardened and elite veterans. In a strange reversal of the earlier Napoleonic Wars, where Frenchmen with little experience and often pressed into service fought against the professional Austrian army, a massive amount of Austrian conscripts, with no experience and only basic training and equipment would be sent into the field against a highly trained, campaign-hardened, and well-equipped French Grande Arm√©e. =Austrian preparations= Charles and the Aulic Council were divided about the strategy with which to attack the French. Charles wanted a major thrust from Bohemia designed to isolate the French forces in northern Germany and lead to a rapid decision.David G. Chandler, The Campaigns of Napoleon. p. 676. The greater part of the Austrian army was already concentrated there, so it seemed like a natural operation. The Aulic Council disagreed on account of the Danube River splitting the forces of Charles and his brother John. They instead suggested that the main attack should be launched south of the Danube so as to maintain safer communications with Vienna. In the end, they had their way, but not before precious time had been lost. The Austrian plan called for the Bohemian corps, the I under Bellegarde, consisting of 38,000 troops, and the II of 20,000 troops under Kollowrat, to attack Regensburg (Ratisbon) from the Bohemian mountains by way of Cham, the Austrian center and reserve, comprising 66,000 men of Hohenzollern's III, Rosenberg's IV, and Lichtenstein's I Reserve Corps, to advance on the same objective through Scharding, and the left wing, made up of the V of Archduke Louis, Hiller's VI, and Kienmayer's II Reserve Corps, a total of 61,000 men, to move forward toward Landshut and guard the flank.Chandler pp. 676‚Äì77. =Congress of Erfurt (1808)= At Tilsit, Napoleon had made Tsar Alexander of Russia an admirer, but by the time of the Erfurt Congress from September to October 1808 anti- French sentiment at the Russian court was beginning to threaten the newly forged alliance. Napoleon and his foreign minister Jean-Baptiste Nomp√®re de Champagny sought to reaffirm the alliance once more in order to allow Napoleon to settle affairs in Spain, as well as prepare for the looming war with Austria. Working at cross-purposes to Napoleon was his former foreign minister Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P√©rigord who had by this time come to the conclusion that Napoleon and his war policies were leading France to destruction, and who secretly advised Alexander to resist Napoleon's demands. Out of the meetings came an agreement, the Erfurt Convention (in 14 articles) calling upon Britain to cease its war against France, recognizing the Russian conquest of Finland from Sweden, and stating that in case of war with Austria, Russia should aid France \\"to the best of its ability\\". The two emperors departed for their homelands on 14 October. Six months later, the expected war with Austria began, and Alexander barely lived up to his agreement, aiding France as little as possible (though in the resulting Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn Russia did receive a portion of Austrian Polish territory, namely the district of Tarnopol, for at least maintaining neutrality). By 1810, due mainly to the economic pressures of enforcing the Continental System, both emperors were considering war with one another. Erfurt was the last meeting between the two leaders. =French preparations= Napoleon was not entirely certain about Austrian planning and intentions. He had just returned to Paris at the time (from his campaigns in Spain in winter 1808‚Äì09) and was instructing the main French field commander in southern Germany, Berthier, on planned deployments and concentrations for this likely new second front. His rough ideas about the possible upcoming campaign included the decision to make the Danube valley the main theatre of operations, as he had done in 1805, and to tie down any Austrian forces that might invade northern Italy by positioning some of his own forces that would be commanded by Eug√®ne and Marmont.Chandler p. 671. Faulty intelligence gave Napoleon the impression that the main Austrian attack would come north of the Danube.Chandler p. 672. On 30 March, he wrote a letter to Berthier explaining his intention to mass around 140,000 troops in the vicinity of Regensburg (Ratisbon), far to the north of where the Austrians were planning to make their attack.Chandler p. 673. Napoleon also expected the Austrian offensive to commence no earlier than 15 April (it would in fact begin on 9 April) and his two contingency orders relayed to Berthier were based heavily on this supposition. These misconceptions about Austrian thinking left the French army poorly deployed when hostilities commenced. Course of war Strategic situation in Europe in February 1809 The war pitted a reformed Austrian army against a collection of French veterans and conscripts. With major engagements of the war lasting from April to July 1809, Napoleon achieved the quick victory that characterised his previous campaigns. However, the War of the Fifth Coalition would also mark the last time in which Napoleon and the French Empire would emerge as decisive victors. =Austria strikes first= The general situation from 17 to 19 April involved the Austrians moving towards the strategic city of Regensburg in hopes of attacking the isolated French III Corps. In the early morning of 10 April, leading elements of the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria. Bad roads and freezing rain slowed the Austrian advance in the first week, but the opposing Bavarian forces gradually retreated. The Austrian attack occurred about a week before Napoleon anticipated, and in his absence Berthier's role became all the more critical. Berthier (whose fort√® was staff work) proved to be an insufficient field commander, a characteristic made worse by the fact that several messages from Paris were being delayed and misinterpreted when they finally arrived at headquarters.Chandler pp. 678‚Äì79. Whereas Napoleon had written to Berthier that an Austrian attack before 15 April should be met by a general French concentration around Donauw√∂rth and Augsburg, Berthier focused on a sentence that called for Davout (the Iron Marshal) to station his III Corps around Regensburg and ordered him to move back to the city despite massive Austrian pressure. The Grande Arm√©e d'Allemagne was now in a perilous position of two wings separated by and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Berthier, the French marshals, and the rank-and-file were all evidently frustrated at the seemingly pointless marches and counter marches.Chandler p. 679. At midnight on 16 April, Berthier wrote the following to Napoleon: \\"In this position of affairs, I greatly desire the arrival of your Majesty, in order to avoid the orders and countermands which circumstances as well as the directives and instructions of your Majesty necessary entail.\\" On the 16th, the Austrian advance guard had beaten back the Bavarians near Landshut and had secured a good crossing place over the Isar by evening. Napoleon finally arrived in Donauw√∂rth on the 17th after a furious trip from Paris. Charles congratulated himself on a successful opening to the campaign and planned to destroy Davout's and Lefebvre's isolated corps in a double-pincer manoeuvre. When Napoleon realised that significant Austrian forces were already over the Isar and were marching towards the Danube, he insisted that the entire French army deploy behind the Ilm River in a bataillon carr√© within 48 hours, all in hopes of undoing Berthier's mistakes and achieving a successful concentration.Chandler p. 681. His orders were unrealistic because he underestimated the number of Austrian troops that were heading for Davout; Napoleon believed Charles only had a single corps over the Isar, but in fact, the Austrians had five corps lumbering towards Regensburg, a grand total of 80,000 men. Napoleon needed to do something quickly to save his left flank from collapsing. =Landshut Maneuver= The Landshut Maneuver and the expulsion of Austrian forces from Bavaria Davout anticipated the problems and withdrew his corps from Regensburg, leaving a garrison of only 2,000 for defence.Chandler p. 682. The northbound Austrian columns in the Kelheim‚ÄìAbbach zone ran into the four French columns heading west towards Neustadt in the early hours of the 19th. The Austrian attacks were slow, uncoordinated, and easily repulsed by the experienced French III Corps. Napoleon knew there was fighting in Davout's sector and had already devised a new strategy that he hoped would beat the Austrians: while the Austrians attacked to the north, Mass√©na's corps, later augmented by Oudinot's forces, would strike southeast towards Freising and Landshut in hopes of rolling up the entire Austrian line and relieving the pressure on Davout.Chandler p. 683. Napoleon was reasonably confident that the joint corps of Davout and Lefebvre could pin the Austrians while his other forces swept the Austrian rear. The attack began well as the central Austrian V Corps guarding Abensberg gave way to the French advance. Napoleon, however, was working under false assumptions that made his goals difficult to achieve.Chandler p. 686. Massena's advance towards Landshut required too much time, permitting Hiller to escape south over the Isar. The Danube bridge that provided easy access to Regensburg and the east bank had not been demolished, allowing the Austrians to transfer themselves across the river and rendering futile French hopes for the complete destruction of the enemy. On the 20th, the Austrians had suffered 10,000 casualties, lost 30 guns, 600 caissons, and 7,000 other vehicles, but were still a potent fighting force.Chandler p. 687. Later in the evening, Napoleon realised that the day's fighting had only involved two Austrian corps. Charles still had a good chance of escaping east over Straubing if he wished. On the 21st, Napoleon received a dispatch from Davout that spoke of major engagements near Teugen-Hausen. Davout held his ground, and although Napoleon sent reinforcements, about 36,000 French troops had to face off against 75,000 Austrians.Chandler p. 689. When Napoleon finally learned that Charles was not withdrawing to the east, he realigned the Grande Arm√©e's axis in an operation that became known as the Landshut Maneuver. All available French forces, except 20,000 troops under Bessieres that were chasing Hiller, now hurled themselves against Eckm√ºhl in another bid to trap the Austrians and relieve their beleaguered comrades.Chandler p. 690. For 22 April, Charles left 40,000 troops under Rosenburg and Hohenzollern to attack Davout and Lefebvre while detaching two corps under Kollowrat and Lichtenstein to march for Abbach and gain undisputed control of the river bank. At 1:30 pm, however, the sound of gunfire from the south could be heard‚ÄîNapoleon had arrived. Davout immediately ordered an attack along the entire line despite numerical inferiority; the 10th Light Infantry Regiment successfully stormed the village of Leuchling and went on to capture the woods of Unter-Leuchling with horrific casualties.Chandler p. 691. Napoleon's reinforcements were soon crippling the Austrian left. The Battle of Eckm√ºhl ended in a convincing French victory, and Charles decided to withdraw over the Danube towards Regensburg. Napoleon then launched Massena to capture Straubing to the east while the rest of the army pursued the escaping Austrians. The French managed to capture Regensburg after a heroic charge led by Marshal Lannes, but the vast majority of the Austrian army fled successfully to Bohemia. Napoleon then turned his attention south towards Vienna, fighting a series of actions against Hiller's forces, most famously, at the Battle of Ebersberg on 3 May. Ten days later, the Austrian capital fell for the second time in four years. =Aspern-Essling= The strategic situation and the Battle of Aspern-Essling on 22 May 1809 On 16 May and 17, the main Austrian army under Charles arrived in the Marchfeld, a plain northeast of Vienna just across the Danube that often served as a training ground for Austrian military forces. Charles kept the bulk of his forces several miles away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross. On the 20th, Charles learned from his observers on the Bissam hill that the French were building a bridge at Kaiser-Ebersdorf,Andrew Uffindell, Great Generals of the Napoleonic Wars. p. 174. just southwest of the Lobau island, that led to the Marchfeld. On the 21st, Charles concluded that the French were crossing at Kaiser-Ebersdorf in strength and ordered a general advance for 98,000 troops and the accompanying 292 guns, which were organised into five columns.Uffindell, p. 175. The French bridgehead rested on two villages: Aspern to the west and Essling to the east. Napoleon had not expected to encounter opposition, and the bridges linking the French troops at Aspern- Essling to Lobau were not protected with palisades, making them highly vulnerable to Austrian barges that had been set ablaze.Uffindell, p. 177. The Battle of Aspern-Essling started at 2:30 pm on 21 May. The initial and poorly coordinated Austrian attacks against Aspern and the Gemeinde Au woods to the south failed completely, but Charles persisted. Eventually, the Austrians managed to capture the whole village but lost the eastern half. The Austrians did not attack Essling until 6 pm because the fourth and fifth columns had longer marching routes. The French successfully repulsed the attacks against Essling throughout the 21st. Fighting commenced by 3 am on the 22nd, and four hours later the French had captured Aspern again. Napoleon now had 71,000 men and 152 guns on the other side of the river, but the French were still dangerously outnumbered.Uffindell, p. 178. Napoleon then launched a massive assault against the Austrian center designed to give enough time for the III Corps to cross and clinch the victory. Lannes advanced with three infantry divisions and travelled for a mile before the Austrians, inspired by the personal heroics of Charles with his rally of the Zach Infantry Regiment (No. 15), unleashed a hail of fire on the French that caused the latter to fall back.Uffindell, pp. 178‚Äì79. At 9 am, the French bridge broke again. Charles launched another massive assault an hour later and captured Aspern for good, but still could not lay claim to Essling. A few hours later, however, the Austrians returned and took all of Essling except the staunchly defended granary. Napoleon replied by sending a part of the Imperial Guard under Jean Rapp, who audaciously disobeyed Napoleon's orders by attacking Essling and expelling all Austrian forces.Uffindell, p. 179. Charles then kept up a relentless artillery bombardment that counted Marshal Lannes as one of its many victims. Fighting diminished shortly afterwards, and the French pulled back all of their forces to Lobau. Charles had inflicted the first major defeat in Napoleon's military career. =Wagram= The strategic situation and the Battle of Wagram in early July 1809 After the defeat at Aspern-Essling, Napoleon took more than six weeks in planning and preparing for contingencies before he made another attempt at crossing the Danube.David G. Chandler, The Campaigns of Napoleon. p. 708. The French brought in more troops, more guns, and instituted better defensive measures to ensure the success of the next crossing. From 30 June to the early days of July, the French recrossed the Danube in strength, no less than 188,000 troops marching across the Marchfeld towards the Austrians. Immediate resistance to the French advance was restricted to the outpost divisions of Nordmann and Johann von Klenau; the main Habsburg army was stationed five miles (8 km) away, centred on the village of Wagram.Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 134. After a successful crossing, Napoleon ordered an attack along the entire line so as to prevent the Austrians from escaping during the night. Furious assaults by the \\"Terrible 57th\\" Infantry Regiment and the elite 10th Light Infantry Regiment against the village of Baumersdorf led to an almost immediate French victory, but ultimately, the Austrians did not budge and kept the French from pressing further. Incessant attacks by the heroic Austrian Vincent Chevaulegers' cavalry forced the 10th and the 57th to retreat, leaving the French with no gains. Further attacks to the left of the line by Eug√®ne and MacDonald also produced nothing. Bernadotte's troops attacked later with equally disappointing results, and on the right Davout decided to disengage in the darkness of the night. The first day ended with the French on the Marchfeld but with little results to show for their efforts. For 6 July, Charles planned a double-envelopment that would require a quick march from the forces of his brother John, then a few kilometres to the east of the battlefield. Napoleon's plan envisaged an envelopment of the Austrian left with Davout's III Corps while the rest of the army pinned the Austrian forces. Klenau's VI Corps, supported by Kollowrat's III, opened the fighting in the second day at 4 am with a crushing assault against the French left, forcing the latter to abandon both Aspern and Essling.Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 139. Meanwhile, a shocking development had occurred overnight. Bernadotte had unilaterally ordered his troops out of the key and central village of Aderklaa, citing heavy artillery shelling, an act that seriously compromised the entire French position. Napoleon was livid and sent two divisions of Massena's corps supported by some cavalry to regain the critical village. After difficult fighting in the first phase, Massena sent in Molitor's reserve division, which slowly but surely grabbed all of Aderklaa back for the French, only to lose it again following fierce Austrian bombardments and counterattacks. To buy time for Davout's materialising assault, Napoleon sent 4,000 cuirassiers under Nansouty against the Austrian lines,Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 141. but their efforts led to nothing. To secure his center and his left, Napoleon formed a massive artillery battery of 112 guns that began pounding at the Austrians and tearing gaping holes through their lines.Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 142. As Davout's men were progressing against the Austrian left, Napoleon formed the three small divisions of MacDonald into a hollow, oblong shape that marched against the Austrian center. The lumbering phalanx was devastated by Austrian artillery but managed to break through the center, although the victory could not be exploited because there was no cavalry in the immediate area. Nevertheless, when Charles sized up the situation, he realised it was only a matter of time before the Austrian position broke completely and ordered a retreat toward Bohemia a few hours after noon. His brother John arrived on the battlefield at 4 pm, too late to have any impact, and accordingly ordered a retreat to Bohemia as well. The French did not pursue the Austrians immediately because they were exhausted from two straight days of vicious fighting. After recuperating, they chased the Austrians and caught up with them at Znaim in mid-July. Here Charles signed an armistice with Napoleon and agreed to end the fighting. Military conflict between France and Austria was effectively ended, although a few more months of diplomatic wrangling were required to make the result official. =Other theatres= Italy and Dalmatia In Italy, Archduke John went up against Napoleon's stepson Eug√®ne. The Austrians beat back several bungled French assaults at the Battle of Sacile in April, causing Eug√®ne to fall back on Verona and the Adige River, but Eug√®ne regrouped and launched a more mature offensive that expelled the Austrians from Northern Italy again. By the time of Wagram, Eug√®ne's forces had joined Napoleon's main army.Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 122. In Dalmatia, Marmont, under the nominal command of Eug√®ne, was fighting against General Stoichewich. Marmont launched a mountain offensive on 30 April, but this was repulsed by the Grenzer troops.Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 123. Like Eug√®ne, however, Marmont did not let an initial setback dictate the tempo of the conflict. He went back on the offensive and joined Napoleon at Wagram. Poland In the Duchy of Warsaw, Poniatowski defeated the Austrians at Raszyn on 19 April, prevented Austrian forces from crossing the Vistula river, and forced the Austrians to retreat from occupied Warsaw. Afterward, the Poles went on to invade Galicia, with some success, but the offensive quickly stalled with heavy casualties. The Austrians also won a few battles but were hampered by the presence of Russian troops whose intentions were unclear and that did not allow them to advance.1809: thunder on the Danube, Jack Gill Eventually, the defeat of the main Austrian army at Wagram decided of the fate of the war. After the Austrian invasion of the Duchy of Warsaw, Russia, bound by the treaty of alliance with France, reluctantly entered the war against Austria. The Russian army under the command of General Sergei Golitsyn crossed into Galicia on 3 June 1809. Golitsyin advanced as slowly as possible, with instructions to avoid any major confrontation with the Austrians. There were only minor skirmishes between the Russian and Austrian troops, with minimal losses. The Austrian and Russian commanders were in frequent correspondence and, in fact, shared some operational intelligence. A courteous letter sent by a Russian divisional commander, General Andrey Gorchakov, to Archduke Ferdinand was intercepted by the Poles, who sent an original to Emperor Napoleon and a copy to Tsar Alexander. As a result, Alexander had to remove Gorchakov from command. Furthermore, there were constant disagreements between Golitsyn and Poniatowski, with whom the Russians were supposed to cooperate in Galicia. As a result of the Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn, Russia received the Galician district of Tarnopol.Mikaberidze pp. 4‚Äì22. Germany Encouraged by the Austrians to throw off the yoke of Napoleon's Bavarian allies, the people of the alpine region of Tyrol took up arms in 1809 in an act of resistance that ultimately failed. In Tyrol, Andreas Hofer led a rebellion against Bavarian rule and French domination that resulted in early isolated victories, but the uprising was suppressed after the French won at Wagram. Hofer was executed in 1810 by a firing squad. In Saxony, a joint force of Austrians and Brunswickers under the command of General Kienmayer was far more successful, defeating a corps under the command of General Junot at the Battle of Gefrees. After taking the capital, Dresden, and pushing back an army under the command of Napoleon's brother, J√©r√¥me Bonaparte, the Austrians were effectively in control of all of Saxony. But by this time, the main Austrian force had already been defeated at Wagram and the armistice of Znaim had been agreed.F. Loraine Petre, Napoleon and the Archduke Charles. p. 318. The Duke of Brunswick however, refused to be bound by the armistice and led his corps on a fighting march right across Germany to the mouth of the River Weser, from where they sailed to England and entered British service.Haythornthwaite p.147 Holland In the Kingdom of Holland, the British launched the Walcheren Campaign to relieve the pressure on the Austrians. The British force of over 39,000, a larger army than that serving in the Iberian Peninsula, landed at Walcheren on 30 July. However, by this time the Austrians had already lost the war. The Walcheren Campaign was characterised by little fighting but many casualties nevertheless, thanks to the popularly dubbed \\"Walcheren Fever\\". Over 4,000 British troops were lost, and the rest withdrew in December 1809. Iberian peninsula The beginning of 1809 saw the French in control of central Spain, through their client kingdom of Spain ruled by Napoleons brother, King Joseph. However, substantial opposition forces remained, and there was much hard fighting ahead. Operations in the Iberian peninsula during 1809 absorbed the efforts of six French army corps, over 100,000 men, and a dozen of Napoleon's marshals. In the west, After the success at Corunna, Soult followed up by taking Ferrol in January, together with a squadron of the Spanish fleet and hoard of supplies. In March he invaded Portugal from the north, defeating the Portuguese army and capturing their second city, Porto. In April the Portuguese, bolstered by a British army under Wellesley, retook the city, driving Soult out of the country. Also in March Ney was driven from Vigo, and was defeated in June at Puente Sanpayo. By July he had been driven from Galicia completely. In the east Saragossa fell in February after a brutal three month siege, and in Catalonia Saint-cyr took Barcelona, but the Spanish fought on at Girona, holding out there until December. In the south the French under Victor inflicted several crushing defeats on the Spanish, at Ucl√©s, in January, and at Cuidad Real and Medellin, in March. in July (coincidental with the battle of Wagram) the allies advanced on Madrid, winning a victory against Jourdan at Talavera, but were unable to build on their success, and Wellesley was forced to withdraw back into Portugal. In October, as the war in central Europe petered out, the Spanish fielded three armies to advance on Madrid, but with mixed success. On the left del Parque beat Marchand at Tamanes, and took Salamanca, but was driven from there by Kellermann. In the centre Albuquerque reached Talavera, but his advance came to nothing. In November del Parque won again at Carpio, but Ariezaga was crushed by Soult outside Madrid at Oca√±a, and all three Spanish armies had to withdraw. The end of the year the strategic situation was little altered; the French still held Castile, but Spanish and allied forces around the periphery continued to resist, while growing guerilla activity in the countryside made the simplest French operations hazardous. Aftermath All the participants of the War of the Fifth Coalition. Blue: The Coalition and their colonies and allies. Green: The First French Empire, its protectorates, colonies and allies. Although France had not completely defeated Austria, the Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn, signed on 14 October 1809, nevertheless imposed a heavy political toll on the Austrians. As a result of the treaty, France received Carinthia, Carniola, and the Adriatic ports, while Galicia was given to the Poles, the Salzburg area of the Tyrol went to the Bavarians, and Russia was ceded the district of Tarnopol. Austria lost over three million subjects, about 20% of her total population. Emperor Francis also agreed to pay an indemnity equivalent to almost 85 million francs, gave recognition to Napoleon's brother Joseph as the King of Spain, and reaffirmed the exclusion of British trade from his remaining dominions. The Austrian defeat paved the way for the marriage of Napoleon to the daughter of Emperor Francis, Marie Louise. Dangerously, Napoleon assumed that his marriage to Marie Louise would eliminate Austria as a future threat, but the Habsburgs were not as driven by familial ties as Napoleon thought. The impact of the conflict was not all positive from the French perspective. The revolts in Tyrol and the Kingdom of Westphalia during the conflict were an indication that there was much discontent over French rule among the German population. Just a few days before the conclusion of the Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn, an 18-year- old German named Friedrich Staps approached Napoleon during an army review and attempted to stab the emperor, but he was intercepted in the nick of time by General Rapp.Chandler p. 736. The emerging forces of German nationalism were too strongly rooted by this time, and the War of the Fifth Coalition played an important role in nurturing their development. By 1813, when the Sixth Coalition was fighting the French for control of Central Europe, the German population was fiercely opposed to French rule and largely supported the Allies. The war also undermined French military superiority and the Napoleonic image. The Battle of Aspern-Essling was the first major defeat in Napoleon's career and was warmly greeted by much of Europe. The Austrians had also shown that strategic insight and tactical ability were no longer a French monopoly.Richard Brooks (editor), Atlas of World Military History. p. 115. The French themselves were actually suffering from tactical shortcomings; the decline in tactical skill of the French infantry led to increasingly heavy columns of foot soldiers eschewing all manoeuvre and relying on sheer weight of numbers to break through, a development best emphasised by MacDonald's attack at Wagram. The Grande Arm√©e lost its qualitative edge partly because raw conscripts replaced many of the veterans of Austerlitz and Jena, eroding tactical flexibility.Brooks (editor) p. 114. Additionally, Napoleon's armies were more and more composed of non-French contingents, undermining morale. Although Napoleon manoeuvred with customary brilliance, as evidenced by overturning the awful initial French position, the growing size of his armies stretched even his impressive mental faculties. The scale of warfare grew too large for even Napoleon to fully cope with, a lesson that would be brutally repeated during the invasion of Russia in 1812.

The treaty ended the Fifth Coalition during the Napoleonic Wars, after Austria had been defeated at the decisive Battle of Wagram on 5-6 July. Prelude During the Peninsular War and the Spanish resistance against Napoleon, Austria had tried to reverse the 1805 Peace of Pressburg by sparking national uprisings in the French-occupied territories of Central Europe (most notably the Tyrolean Rebellion against Napoleon's Bavarian allies). These attempts ultimately failed, after French forces occupied Vienna in May 1809. The Austrians under Archduke Charles were able to repulse them at the Battle of Aspern on 21-22 May; however, Napoleon withdrew his forces and crushed Charles' army at Wagram a few weeks later. The archduke had to sign the Armistice of Znaim on 12 July. In October, Austrian Foreign Minister Johann Philipp Stadion was superseded by Klemens von Metternich. Terms Europe on the eve of Napoleon's Russian campaign, 1812 France imposed harsh peace terms: Austria had to cede the Duchy of Salzburg to Bavaria and lost its access to the Adriatic Sea by waiving the Littoral territories of Gorizia and Gradisca and the Imperial Free City of Trieste, together with Carniola, the March of Istria, western (\\"Upper\\") Carinthia with East Tyrol, and the Croatian lands southwest of the river Sava to the French Empire (see Illyrian provinces). West Galicia was ceded to the Duchy of Warsaw, and Tarnopol district to the Russian Empire. Austria recognized Napoleon's previous conquests from other nations as well as the rule of his brother Joseph Bonaparte as King of Spain. Austria also paid to France a large indemnity and the Austrian army was reduced to 150,000 men - a promise not fulfilled. The Graz Schlossberg fortress, whose garrison had firmly resisted the French occupation forces, was largely demolished. Austria also had to apply Napoleon's Continental System, as Britain remained at war with France. One contemporary British view on the treaty was: Though considerably weakened, Austria remained a European great power. Emperor Francis I approached to the French by marrying his daughter Marie Louise off to Napoleon (whom she at first detested) in 1810. As a result of Metternich's change of policies, the Austrian forces joined the French invasion of Russia in 1812. Assassination attempt Staps is interrogated by Napoleon and his physician Jean-Nicolas Corvisart, 1866 depiction During the negotiations at Sch√∂nbrunn, Napoleon narrowly escaped an attempt on his life. On 12 October, shortly before signing the treaty, the emperor exited the palace with a large entourage to observe a military parade. Seventeen year old Friedrich Staps, son of a Lutheran pastor from Naumburg, had arrived in Vienna and demanded an audience to present a petition. He was refused by the emperor's aide General Jean Rapp, who shortly thereafter observed Staps in the courtyard pushing through the crowd towards Napoleon from a different direction, and had him arrested. Taken to the palace, Staps was found to be carrying a large kitchen knife inside his coat, concealed in the petition papers. Interrogated, Staps frankly revealed his plans to kill the emperor, calling him the misfortune of his country. Brought forward to Napoleon, he asked whether Staps would thank him if he was pardoned, to which Staps replied: \\"I would kill you none the less.\\" Napoleon left Vienna on 16 October and the next day Staps was shot by W√ºrttemberg fusiliers outside the palace. At this execution, he is said to have shouted \\"Long live freedom! Long live Germany!\\"Stammbaum der Familien Wislicenus: Friedrich Staps L'attentat de Staps Napoleon, impressed and fearing a greater conspiracy, instructed his police minister Joseph Fouch√© to keep the incident secret. Soon after the German campaign of 1813, Staps came to be seen as a martyr of the burgeoning German nationalism. He was the subject of a poem by Christian Friedrich Hebbel and a play by Walter von Molo.

Potrƒç's interdisciplinary practice includes on-site projects, research, architectural case studies, and series of drawings. Her work documents and interprets contemporary architectural practices (in particular, with regard to energy infrastructure and water use) and the ways people live together. Background and early career Potrƒç was born in Ljubljana, the capital of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia, which was then part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Her parents were both writers. Potrƒç's father, Ivan Potrƒç, was a well-known Slovene social realist novelist and playwright from the Styria region, and the main editor at the publishing house Mladinska Knjiga. Her mother, Branka Jurca, was a teacher and magazine editor and also a well-known author of children's literature, who was born in the Karst region of western Slovenia but moved to Maribor, where she met Marjetica's father. Marjetica Potrƒç received degrees in architecture (1978) and sculpture (1986, 1988) from the University of Ljubljana. In 1990, she moved to the United States. Her installations from this period often involved walls of various kinds; for example, Two Faces of Utopia (1993, made for the Slovene Pavilion at the Venice Biennial), and the series Theatrum Mundi: Territories (1993‚Äì1996). A statement she made at the time‚Äî\\"I don't make objects. I build walls\\"‚Äîpositions her work against object-based sculpture.Discussed in Goran Tomƒçiƒá, \\"The Sheltering Connection,\\" in L√≠via P√°ldi, ed., Next Stop, Kiosk (Ljubljana: Moderna galerija, 2003), 15-16 In 1994, she moved back to Ljubljana. Since then, Potrƒç's work has developed at the intersection of visual art, architecture, and social science. Participatory design and sustainable solutions Dry Toilet, 2003, La Vega barrio, Caracas. In 2003, Potrƒç was invited to spend six months in Caracas, Venezuela, as part of the Caracas Case Project, and carry out research on the informal city. There, in collaboration with the Israeli architect Liyat Esakov and the residents of the La Vega barrio, she developed the project Dry Toilet: an ecologically safe, waterless toilet was installed in the upper part of the La Vega barrio, a district in Caracas that has no access to the municipal water grid.See Marco Scotini, \\"Dry Toilet\\", Domus, no. 891 (April 2006): 88-91 Dry Toilet is one of a series of community-focused on-site projects by Potrƒç that are characterized by participatory design and a concern with sustainability issues, particularly in relation to energy and water infrastructures. Other important projects are Balcony with Wind Turbine (Liverpool, 2004), Power from Nature (Barefoot College, Rajasthan, India, and the Catherine Ferguson Academy, Detroit, Mich., USA, 2005),Ginger Danto, \\"ART/ARCHITECTURE; The Nobel Garden Prize Winner\\", The New York Times, June 27, 2004 and A Farm in Murcia: Rainwater Harvesting (Murcia, Spain, 2007).http://www.potrc.org/project2.htm In Potrƒç's view, the sustainable solutions that are implemented and disseminated by communities serve to empower these communities and help create a democracy built from below.See Marjetica Potrƒç, \\"Frontier Power: Human Bodies, Building Facades and Fragmented Territories,\\" in Islands + Ghettos, exhibition catalog (Heidelberg: Heidelberger Kunstverein, 2008), pp. 50-67. Since 2011, Marjetica Potrƒç has been a professor at the University of Fine Arts/HFBK in Hamburg, Germany, where she teaches the course Design for the Living World. She and her students have carried out participatory design projects in various parts of Europe (Germany, Austria, Norway, Sweden, and Serbia), as well as in the United States and South Africa. The Soweto Project (2014) is of particular note. She and her class spent two months in the Soweto district in Johannesburg, where, among other things, they worked with the residents of the Orlando East neighborhood to turn a degraded public space, which was being used as a dumping ground, into a community park.The project was carried out in conjunction with the umbrella project Nine Urban Biotypes ‚Äì Negotiating the Future of Urban Living. For more information on The Soweto Project, see the Design for the Living World website. Since 2010, Potrƒç has also made a number of projects with the architectural and design practice Ooze (Eva Pfannes and Sylvain Hartenberg), based in Rotterdam. These projects, which focus largely on water purification, include Between the Waters: The Emscher Community Garden in Essen, Germany (2010), where they constructed a complete sustainable water supply system on an island in the Emscher River,See Nico Saieh, \\"Between the Waters: The Emscher Community Garden / Marjetica Potrc and Ooze\\", Arch Daily. and Of Soil and Water: King's Cross Pond Club, in London (2015), where they created a natural swimming pond with its own micro-ecological environment on a construction site.See the description of the project on Potrƒç's website. Hybrid House: Caracas, West Bank, West Palm Beach, 2003, the Palm Beach Institute of Contemporary Art, Lake Worth, Fla. Potrƒç's large gallery installations, which she calls \\"architectural case studies,\\" are a unique practice and have long been a central part of her work; they aim to translate into the gallery space her view of contemporary architectural practices and their relationship to issues of energy, water use, and communication.Potrƒç has documented her most important architectural case studies and exhibitions on her website. For example, soon after the Dry Toilet project, she created Hybrid House: Caracas, West Bank, West Palm Beach at the Palm Beach Institute of Contemporary Art in Lake Worth, Florida, in 2003 (the following year, the installation traveled to the List Visual Arts Center of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts). The installation represents a case study of three contemporary communities in conflict‚Äîthe Caracas barrio, the West Bank, and West Palm Beach, Florida‚Äîand illustrates how they negotiate issues of space, security, energy, water, and communications, bringing to the fore the uneasy coexistence of different communities in 21st-century societies.See Marjetica Potrƒç: Urgent Architecture, ed. Michael Rush (Lake Worth, FL: Palm Beach Institute of Contemporary Art, 2003). In one of her most controversial and most often quoted statements, Potrƒç has observed: \\"There are two urban forms in the global city that I consider to be most successful‚Äîafter all, they are growing the fastest‚Äînamely, gated communities and shantytowns.\\"Marjetica Potrƒç, \\"Five Ways to Urban Independence,\\" in L√≠via P√°ldi, ed., Next Stop, Kiosk (Ljubljana: Moderna galerija, 2003), 77. Beginning with her six-month-long research in Caracas in 2003, Potrƒç's practice has been distinguished by extended research projects in regions that are reinventing themselves after the decline of 20th- century modernism. Most significant have been her projects in the Amazonian state of Acre in western Brazil in 2006 (in conjunction with the S√£o Paulo Art Biennial);See Potrƒç's essay \\"New Territories in Acre and Why They Matter\\" The Acre project was the subject of Potrƒç's exhibitions Forest Rising, at the Curve, Barbican Art Gallery, in London, May 24 - Sept. 2, 2007, and Florestania, at the Temple Bar Gallery in Dublin, Nov. 6 - Dec. 9, 2007. the Lost Highway Expedition in nine cities in the Western Balkans (Ljubljana, Zagreb, Novi Sad, Belgrade, Skopje, Pristina, Tirana, Podgorica, and Sarajevo), which she co-organized in collaboration with School of Missing Studies and a group of artists and architects;See Katherine Carl and Srdjan Jovanoviƒá Weiss, eds., Lost Highway Expedition Photobook (Rotterdam: Centrala Foundation for Future Cities and School of Missing Studies and Ljubljana: ≈†KUC Gallery, 2007). Also, Potrƒç discusses this project on the video Networked Cultures (A Conversation between Marjetica Potrƒç and Peter Moertenboeck and Helge Mooshammer) (London: Goldsmiths College, 2007). and her research project on water issues in post-Katrina New Orleans, in which she collaborated with the design consultancy FutureProof in 2007-2008.The New Orleans project resulted in, among things, an exhibition by Potrƒç at the Max Protetch Gallery in New York, Future Talk Now: The Great Republic of New Orleans. See Joshua Decter's review, \\"Marjetica Potrƒç at Max Protetch Gallery,\\" Artforum International, April 2008, 371-372. Collaboration with local individuals, groups, and organizations is a significant aspect of nearly all her research projects. These research projects provide the basis for later drawing series and architectural case studies, which translate her findings to wider audiences. Potrƒç constructs her drawings as narratives that present and interpret with simple images and text the challenges and strategies of the communities she has studied. Her drawing series include, among others, The Struggle for Justice (2005), Florestania (2006), and The Great Republic of New Orleans (2007).http://www.potrc.org/drawings.htm Exhibitions and awards Potrƒç's work has been exhibited extensively throughout Europe and the Americas, including in such important international shows as the S√£o Paulo Biennial (1996 and 2006), and the Venice Biennial (in the exhibitions The Structure of Survival, 2003, and \\"Making Worlds\\", 2009). She also participated in the 5th Gwangju Biennale in Gwangju, South Korea (2004). She has shown her work regularly at the Nordenhake Gallery in Berlin and Stockholm since 2003, and, formerly, at the Max Protetch Gallery (2002‚Äì2009) and the Meulensteen Gallery (2009‚Äì2012) in New York. She has also had solo exhibitions at the Guggenheim Museum in New York (2001),Hugo Boss Prize 2000, Marjetica Potrc, at the Guggenheim Museum, New York February 9 - April 29, 2001 the List Visual Arts Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2004), the Portikus in Frankfurt am Main (2006), and the Curve at the Barbican Art Gallery in London (2007), among others. Other important exhibitions of her work include Caracas: Growing Houses, which she presented as part of the exhibition Architektonika 2 at the Hamburger Bahnhof ‚Äì Museum for Contemporary Art in Berlin (2012) and The School of the Forest: Miami Campus at the P√©rez Art Museum in Miami, FL (2015); in both exhibitions, she revisits and recontextualizes issues she explored in earlier research projects in Caracas and the Amazonian state of Acre, in Brazil.See the descriptions on Potrƒç's website. Potrƒç has received numerous grants and awards, including two grants from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation (1993 and 1999); the Hugo Boss Prize in 2000,'Hugo Boss Prize website' .

Though the original hospital is more than 200 years old, the medical college was formally established on 2 July 1938. The medical college and the hospital include a Centre of Excellence for Hand and Reconstructive Microsurgery and a separate cadaver maintenance unit, the first in the country. By legacy, the hospital's anatomy department receives corpses for scientific study from the Monegar Choultry from which the hospital historically descended. History Hand Rehabilitation / Plastic Surgery Institute Stanley Medical College and Hospitals is one of the oldest centers in India in the field of medical education. The seed for this institution was sown as early as 1740 when the East India Company first created the medical department. The Stanley Hospital now stands on the old site of the Monegar Choultry established in 1782. In 1799, the Madras Native Infirmary was established with Monegar Choultry and leper asylum providing medical services. In 1830, philanthropist Raja Sir Ramasamy Mudaliar endowed a hospital and dispensary in the Native Infirmary. In 1836, Madras University established M.B. & G.M. and L.M & S Medical Courses in the Native Infirmary. In 1903, a hospital assistant course was introduced with the help of the East India Company. In 1911, the first graduating class was awarded their Licensed Medical Practitioner (LMP) diplomas. In 1933, a five-year D.M. & S (Diploma in Medicine & Surgery) course was inaugurated by Lt. Colonel Sir George Fredrick Stanley, a British parliamentarian. The school was named after him by the Governor of Madras Presidency on 2 July 1938. In 1941, three medical and surgical units were created. This was expanded to seven medical and surgical units in 1964. In 1938, 72 students studied, and then from 1963, 150 students were admitted each year. In 1990, the Institute of Social Paediatrics was established. Initially established as a centre for children and for improving research programmes. The institute houses several departments of the hospital including nephrology, dermatology, and neurology and provides treatment for adult patients from Stanley. Hospital The College is associated with the Government Stanley Hospital which has 1580 beds for in-patient treatment. The hospital has an out-patient attendance of around 5000 patients per day. It has an 8-storey surgical complex equipped to perform up to 40 surgeries simultaneously, and a separate pediatrics block with all specialities under one roof. Admissions Admissions to Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MBBS) and post-graduate (MD, MS, other diplomas and higher specialties) are through state (85% seats) and national (15%) entrance examinations. Reservations of seats and reduced tuition are available to reserved communities. Admissions are open only to Indian citizens, and are highly competitive. Admissions to the MBBS program (about 250 seats per year) are based on NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test). Several seats in post-graduate programs are reserved for physicians in Government service.  Stanley Medical Journal  Stanley Medical Journal is an official publication of the colleges. It was launched in September 2014 and is a quarterly online publication. Its ISSN is P-ISSN 2394-3637 & E-ISSN 2455-5088. The journal publishes original research including articles, case reports and scientific papers and invites annotations, comments, and review papers on recent advances, editorial correspondence, news and book reviews.

In order to prevent an attacker from reliably jumping to, for example, a particular exploited function in memory, ASLR randomly arranges the address space positions of key data areas of a process, including the base of the executable and the positions of the stack, heap and libraries.  History  The Linux PaX project first coined the term \\"ASLR\\", and published the first design and implementation of ASLR in July 2001 as a patch for the Linux kernel. It is seen as a complete implementation, providing also a patch for kernel stack randomization since October 2002. The first mainstream operating system to support ASLR by default was the OpenBSD version 3.4 in 2003, followed by Linux in 2005.  Benefits  Address space randomization hinders some types of security attacks by making it more difficult for an attacker to predict target addresses. For example, attackers trying to execute return-to- libc attacks must locate the code to be executed, while other attackers trying to execute shellcode injected on the stack have to find the stack first. In both cases, the system obscures related memory-addresses from the attackers. These values have to be guessed, and a mistaken guess is not usually recoverable due to the application crashing. = Effectiveness = Address space layout randomization is based upon the low chance of an attacker guessing the locations of randomly placed areas. Security is increased by increasing the search space. Thus, address space randomization is more effective when more entropy is present in the random offsets. Entropy is increased by either raising the amount of virtual memory area space over which the randomization occurs or reducing the period over which the randomization occurs. The period is typically implemented as small as possible, so most systems must increase VMA space randomization. To defeat the randomization, attackers must successfully guess the positions of all areas they wish to attack. For data areas such as stack and heap, where custom code or useful data can be loaded, more than one state can be attacked by using NOP slides for code or repeated copies of data. This allows an attack to succeed if the area is randomized to one of a handful of values. In contrast, code areas such as library base and main executable need to be discovered exactly. Often these areas are mixed, for example stack frames are injected onto the stack and a library is returned into. The following variables can be declared: : E_s (entropy bits of stack top) : E_m (entropy bits of \`mmap()\` base) : E_x (entropy bits of main executable base) : E_h (entropy bits of heap base) : A_s (attacked bits per attempt of stack entropy) : A_m (attacked bits per attempt of \`mmap()\` base entropy) : A_x (attacked bits per attempt of main executable entropy) : A_h (attacked bits per attempt of heap base entropy) : \\\\alpha (attempts made) : N (total amount of entropy: N = (E_s-A_s) + (E_m-A_m) + (E_x-A_x) + (E_h-A_h)\\\\,) To calculate the probability of an attacker succeeding, we have to assume a number of attempts carried out without being interrupted by a signature-based IPS, law enforcement, or other factor; in the case of brute forcing, the daemon cannot be restarted. We also have to figure out how many bits are relevant and how many are being attacked in each attempt, leaving however many bits the attacker has to defeat. The following formulas represent the probability of success for a given set of attempts on bits of entropy. : g \\\\left ( \\\\alpha\\\\, \\\\right ) = 1 - { \\\\left ( 1 - {2^{-N}} \\\\right ) ^ \\\\alpha\\\\,} \\\\,\\\\text{ if } 0 \\\\le \\\\, \\\\alpha\\\\, (isolated guessing; address space is re-randomized after each attempt) : b \\\\left ( \\\\alpha\\\\, \\\\right ) = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\,} \\\\,\\\\text{ if } 0 \\\\le \\\\, \\\\alpha\\\\, \\\\le \\\\, {2^N} (systematic brute forcing on copies of the program with the same address space) In many systems, 2^N can be in the thousands or millions; on 64-bit systems, these numbers typically reach the millions at least, Hector Marco-Gisbert and Ismael Ripoll showed in 2014 how to bypass the ASLR in 64-bit systems in less than one second under certain circumstances. For 32-bit systems at 2004 computer speeds which have 16 bits for address randomization, Shacham and co-workers state \\"... 16 bits of address randomization can be defeated by a brute force attack within minutes.\\" The authors' statement depends on the ability to attack the same application multiple times without any delay. Proper implementations of ASLR, like that included in grsecurity, provide several methods to make such brute force attacks infeasible. One method involves preventing an executable from executing for a configurable amount of time if it has crashed a certain number of times. Android, and possibly other systems, implement Library Load Order Randomization, a form of ASLR which randomizes the order in which libraries are loaded. This supplies very little entropy. An approximation of the number of bits of entropy supplied per needed library appears below; this does not yet account for varied library sizes, so the actual entropy gained is really somewhat higher. Note that attackers usually need only one library; the math is more complex with multiple libraries, and shown below as well. Note that the case of an attacker using only one library is a simplification of the more complex formula for l = 1. : (number of libraries loaded) : (number of libraries used by the attacker) : E_m = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\log_2 \\\\left (l \\\\right ) &\\\\text{ if } \\\\beta\\\\, = 1, l \\\\ge \\\\, 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sum_{i=l}^{l - \\\\left ( \\\\beta\\\\, - 1 \\\\right )} \\\\log_2 \\\\left (i \\\\right ) &\\\\text{ if } \\\\beta\\\\, \\\\ge \\\\, 1, l \\\\ge \\\\, 1 \\\\end{cases} These values tend to be low even for large values of , most importantly since attackers typically can use only the C standard library and thus one can often assume that \\\\beta\\\\, = 1. However, even for a small number of libraries there are a few bits of entropy gained here; it is thus potentially interesting to combine library load order randomization with VMA address randomization to gain a few extra bits of entropy. Note that these extra bits of entropy will not apply to other mmap() segments, only libraries.  Reducing entropy  Attackers may make use of several methods to reduce the entropy present in a randomized address space, ranging from simple information leaks to attacking multiple bits of entropy per attack (such as by heap spraying). There is little that can be done about this. It is possible to leak information about memory layout using format string vulnerabilities. Format string functions such as printf use a variable argument list to do their job; format specifiers describe what the argument list looks like. Because of the way arguments are typically passed, each format specifier moves closer to the top of the stack frame. Eventually, the return pointer and stack frame pointer can be extracted, revealing the address of a vulnerable library and the address of a known stack frame; this can completely eliminate library and stack randomization as an obstacle to an attacker. One can also decrease entropy in the stack or heap. The stack typically must be aligned to 16 bytes, and so this is the smallest possible randomization interval; while the heap must be page-aligned, typically 4096 bytes. When attempting an attack, it is possible to align duplicate attacks with these intervals; a NOP slide may be used with shellcode injection, and the string can be replaced with for an arbitrary number of slashes when attempting to return to system. The number of bits removed is exactly \\\\log_2\\\\\\\\!\\\\left (n \\\\right ) for intervals attacked. Such decreases are limited due to the amount of data in the stack or heap. The stack, for example, is typically limited to and grows to much less; this allows for at most , although a more conservative estimate would be around 8‚Äì corresponding to 4‚Äì of stack stuffing. The heap on the other hand is limited by the behavior of the memory allocator; in the case of glibc, allocations above 128 KB are created using mmap, limiting attackers to 5 bits of reduction. This is also a limiting factor when brute forcing; although the number of attacks to perform can be reduced, the size of the attacks is increased enough that the behavior could in some circumstances become apparent to intrusion detection systems. = Limitations = ASLR-protected addresses can be leaked by various side channels, removing mitigation utility. Recent attacks have used information leaked by the CPU branch target predictor buffer (BTB) or memory management unit (MMU) walking page tables. It is not clear if this class of ASLR attack can be mitigated. If they cannot, the benefit of ASLR is reduced or eliminated.  Implementations  Several mainstream, general-purpose operating systems implement ASLR. = Android = Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich provides address space layout randomization (ASLR) to help protect system and third party applications from exploits due to memory-management issues. Position-independent executable support was added in Android 4.1. Android 5.0 dropped non-PIE support and requires all dynamically linked binaries to be position independent. Library load ordering randomization was accepted into the Android open-source project on 26 October 2015, and was included in the Android 7.0 release. = DragonFly BSD = DragonFly BSD has an implementation of ASLR based upon OpenBSD's model, added in 2010.mmap - add mmap offset randomization, DragonFly Gitweb, 25 November 2010. It is off by default, and can be enabled by setting the sysctl vm.randomize_mmap to 1. = FreeBSD = Support for ASLR will appear in FreeBSD 13.0 (currently in development). It is disabled by default. = iOS (iPhone, iPod touch, iPad) = Apple introduced ASLR in iOS 4.3 (released March 2011).Pwn2Own day 2: iPhone, BlackBerry beaten; Chrome, Firefox no-shows, Ars Technica, 11 March 2011 KASLR was introduced in iOS 6. The randomized kernel base is 0x01000000 + ((1+0xRR) * 0x00200000), where 0xRR is a random byte from SHA1 (random data) generated by iBoot (the 2nd-stage iOS Boot Loader). = Linux = Linux kernel enabled a weak form of ASLR by default since the kernel version 2.6.12, released in June 2005.The NX Bit And ASLR, Tom's Hardware, 25 March 2009. The PaX and Exec Shield patchsets to the Linux kernel provide more complete implementations. The Exec Shield patch for Linux supplies 19 bits of stack entropy on a period of 16 bytes, and 8 bits of mmap base randomization on a period of 1 page of 4096 bytes. This places the stack base in an area 8 MB wide containing 524,288 possible positions, and the mmap base in an area 1 MB wide containing 256 possible positions. Position-independent executable (PIE) implements a random base address for the main executable binary and has been in place since 2003. It provides the same address randomness to the main executable as being used for the shared libraries. The PIE feature is in use only for the network facing daemons ‚Äì the PIE feature cannot be used together with the prelink feature for the same executable. The prelink tool implements randomization at prelink time rather than runtime, because by design prelink aims to handle relocating libraries before the dynamic linker has to, which allows the relocation to occur once for many runs of the program. As a result, real address space randomization would defeat the purpose of prelinking. The randomization can be disabled for a specific process by changing its execution domain, using \`personality(2)\`. Kernel address space layout randomization Kernel address space layout randomization (KASLR) enables address space randomization for the Linux kernel image by randomizing where the kernel code is placed at boot time. KASLR was merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 3.14, released on 30 March 2014. When compiled in, it can be disabled at boot time by specifying as one of the kernel's boot parameters. There are several side-channel attacks in x86 processors that could leak kernel addresses. In late 2017, kernel page-table isolation (KPTI aka KAISER) was developed to defeat these attacks. However, this method cannot protect against side-channel attacks utilizing collisions in branch predictor structures. = Microsoft Windows = Microsoft's Windows Vista (released January 2007) and later have ASLR enabled only for executables and dynamic link libraries that are specifically linked to be ASLR-enabled. For compatibility, it is not enabled by default for other applications. Typically, only older software is incompatible and ASLR can be fully enabled by editing a registry entry \\"HKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\Session Manager\\\\Memory Management\\\\MoveImages\\",Windows Internals: Including Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista, Fifth Edition (PRO-Developer) or by installing Microsoft's Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit. The locations of the heap, stack, Process Environment Block, and Thread Environment Block are also randomized. A security whitepaper from Symantec noted that ASLR in 32-bit Windows Vista may not be as robust as expected, and Microsoft has acknowledged a weakness in its implementation. Host-based intrusion prevention systems such as WehnTrust and Ozone also offer ASLR for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 operating systems. WehnTrust is open-source. Complete details of Ozone's implementation are not available. It was noted in February 2012 that ASLR on 32-bit Windows systems prior to Windows 8 can have its effectiveness reduced in low memory situations. Similar effect also had been achieved on Linux in the same research. The test code caused the Mac OS X 10.7.3 system to kernel panic, so it was left unclear about its ASLR behavior in this scenario. = NetBSD = Support for ASLR in userland appeared in NetBSD 5.0 (released April 2009), and was enabled by default in NetBSD-current in April 2016. Kernel ASLR support on amd64 was added in NetBSD-current in October 2017, making NetBSD the first BSD system to support KASLR. = OpenBSD = In 2003, OpenBSD became the first mainstream operating system to support a strong form of ASLR and to activate it by default. OpenBSD completed its ASLR support in 2008 when it added support for PIE binaries. OpenBSD 4.4's malloc(3) was designed to improve security by taking advantage of ASLR and gap page features implemented as part of OpenBSD's \`mmap\` system call, and to detect use-after-free bugs. Released in 2013, OpenBSD 5.3 was the first mainstream operating system to enable Position-independent executables by default on multiple hardware platforms, and OpenBSD 5.7 activated position-independent static binaries (Static-PIE) by default. = macOS = In Mac OS X Leopard 10.5 (released October 2007), Apple introduced randomization for system libraries. In Mac OS X Lion 10.7 (released July 2011), Apple expanded their implementation to cover all applications, stating \\"address space layout randomization (ASLR) has been improved for all applications. It is now available for 32-bit apps (as are heap memory protections), making 64-bit and 32-bit applications more resistant to attack.\\" As of OS X Mountain Lion 10.8 (released July 2012) and later, the entire system including the kernel as well as kexts and zones are randomly relocated during system boot. = Solaris = ASLR has been introduced in Solaris beginning with Solaris 11.1 (released October 2012). ASLR in Solaris 11.1 can be set system-wide, per zone, or on a per-binary basis.Controlling Access to Machine Resources, Oracle Information Library, 26 October 2012. Exploitation A side-channel attack utilizing branch target buffer was demonstrated to bypass ASLR protection. In 2017, an attack named \\"ASLR‚äïCache\\" was demonstrated which could defeat ASLR in a web browser using JavaScript.AnC VUSec, 2017  See also  * Buffer overflow * Stack buffer overflow * Stack- smashing protection * NX bit  References   External links  * Exploit Mitigation Techniques: an Update After 10 Years in OpenBSD * PaX documentation on ASLR * Comparison of PaX to Exec Shield and W^X * Address Space Layout Randomization in Windows Vista - Michael Howard's Web Log * ASLR for Windows 2000/XP/2003 (WehnTrust) * Bypassing PaX ASLR protection * On the effectiveness of address space layout randomization * Test Applications (or libraries) for their ASLR and DEP support * ASLR Smack & Laugh Reference Category:Operating system security ","title":"Address space layout randomization"},{"id":"866517","text":"Inventor Norman L. Dean beside one of his \\"Dean drive\\" apparatuses. The Dean drive was a device created and promoted by inventor Norman Lorimer Dean (1902‚Äì1972) that he claimed to be a reactionless drive. Dean claimed that his device was able to generate a uni-directional force in free space, in violation of Newton's third law of motion from classical physics. His claims generated notoriety because, if true, such a device would have had enormous applications, completely changing human transport, engineering, space travel and more. Dean made several controlled private demonstrations of a number of different devices; however, no working models were ever demonstrated publicly or subjected to independent analysis and Dean never presented any rigorous theoretical basis for their operation. Analysts conclude that the motion seen in Dean's device demonstrations was likely reliant on asymmetrical frictional resistance between the device and the surface on which the device was set (\\"stick and slip\\"), resulting in the device moving in one direction when in operation, driven by the vibrations of the apparatus. Early publicity The Dean drive obtained a good deal of publicity in the 1950s and '60s via the columns and conference presentations of John W. Campbell, the longtime editor of Astounding Science Fiction magazine. At that time, Campbell believed that his magazine had to change society by helping breakthrough research that was rejected by \\"mainstream\\" science, and he promoted a series of far-reaching ideas that had dubious scientific bases, like Dianetics, dowsing, the Hieronymus machine, and the Dean Drive. Campbell believed that the device worked and claimed to have witnessed it operating on a bathroom scale. The weight reading on the scale appeared to decrease when the device was activated. He subsequently published photographs of the scale with the drive stopped and running. The June 1960 cover of Astounding magazine featured a painting of a United States submarine near Mars, supposedly propelled there by a Dean drive. Cover picture by John Schoenherr; the submarine is designated \\"USSS-1\\" and 578, so presumably modeled on . Dean, who was trying to find potential buyers for his technology, was secretive about the details of how it was supposed to work, but it was said to contain asymmetrical rotating weights and to generate a great deal of vibration. Dean and Campbell claimed that Newton‚Äôs laws of motion were only an approximation, and that Dean had discovered a fourth law of motion. This has been described as a nonlinear correction to one of Newton‚Äôs laws, which, if correct, would allegedly have rendered a reactionless drive feasible after all. One result of the initial articles in Campbell's magazine was that two other researchers, William O. Davis and G. Harry Stine, visited Dean and witnessed a demonstration. Results of this visit were published in the May 1962 and June 1976 issues of the magazine, the name of which had been changed by Campbell from Astounding to Analog. Davis witnessed a demonstration by Dean, and wrote: \\"It was the conclusion of both Harry Stine and myself that we had witnessed a real anomaly and that the possibility of fraud in the demonstration was slim.\\" Aerospaec researcher Jerry Pournelle ‚Äî who, like Stine, was also a science fiction writer ‚Äî pointed out that Stine was well qualified to make a judgment on the device, but that he was more gullible than other persons. Davis's 1962 article was titled, \\"The Fourth Law of Motion\\", and described a hypothesis in which Dean's device (and others) could conserve momentum invisibly via \\"gravitational-inertial radiation\\". One detail of Davis's hypothesis involved the forces of action and reaction ‚Äî physical bodies can respond to those forces nonsimultaneously, or \\"out of phase\\" with each other. \\"Detesters, Phasers and Dean Drives\\", a 1976 article by Davis, reported his tests with Stine, an engineer who built devices to test that aspect of the hypothesis. Stine said they were able to reliably create and reproduce a 3-degree phase angle in a linear system, which was not possible according to ordinary physics. But then they failed to reproduce the effect in a pendulum system, using a rocket-powered ballistic pendulum. The pendulum test would have proved beyond doubt that the Drive worked, but Dean refused to subject the original Dean Drive to a pendulum test. Campbell reported that he had seen the Drive subjected to a pendulum test, but Davis and Stine suspect that he only reported what Dean had told him and had never seen the actual test. Davis says the question can't be settled until the pendulum test is made. Their research was terminated in 1965 when the national economy took a downturn, and was never resumed. The 1976 article was an attempt to get research restarted, but apparently failed. In 1984, physicist Amit Goswami wrote that \\"Dean's machine made such a splash with readers of science fiction that it is now customary in SF circles to refer to a reactionless drive as a Dean drive.\\" = Purported weight loss = Dean made a demonstration for a representative of the magazine Popular Mechanics of one of his \\"Dean drive\\" devices. The witness reported that \\"While suspended above the ground, was able to pull a load to itself without itself being pulled toward the load\\". Another version of the machine was reported to be \\"able to apply a force to a hand, without moving‚Äîyet when the machine was turned off an equivalent force applied by the hand easily moved the machine\\". William O. Davis, who witnessed the latter demonstration, wrote in his notebook about Dean's explanation of how the device worked, \\"... does not strike me as valid ... For this reason I have decided to undertake a theoretical study of dynamic systems to see if a concept can be evolved which will describe a world in which Dean's Drive can exist and yet where other known facts are not contradicted.\\" Davis produced a hypothesis and it was published in Analog in 1962. Later analysis has revealed that the interactions of vibration, friction, and resonance with the springs of the scale are likely the root cause of the apparent weight loss reported by Campbell and others of apparent \\"anti-gravity\\" and \\"reactionless thruster\\" effects.. Research conducted in conjunction with academia and industry has resulted in analytical equations identifying initial and rotational speed of the eccentric masses of the mechanism as key parameters of the inertial effects of the drive. An electromagnetic analog of the drive was also introduced. Similar results hold for other eccentric profiles. =Interested parties= In the 1950s Jerry Pournelle, working for an aerospace company, contacted Dean to investigate purchasing the device. Dean refused to demonstrate the device without pre- payment and promise of a Nobel prize. Pournelle's company were unwilling to pay for the right to examine the device and never saw the purported model. 3M sent representatives about the same time, and obtained similar results. Pournelle eventually was convinced that Dean's device never worked. Patents Dean was granted two U.S. patents on mechanical devices presumably related to his Dean drive claims. His first patent for a \\"System for converting rotary motion into unidirectional motion\\" was granted on May 9, 1959. Another patent for a \\"Variable oscillator system\\" was granted on May 11, 1965. These two patent designs were the only ones where Dean revealed the design details with an explanation for operation. However, the details were incomplete, and it is not possible to build a Dean Drive just from the explanations in the patent. Dean's patents, as well as patents for many other similar devices, have been analyzed and it has been determined that none can produce net directional thrust in free space or violate Newton's Third Law. Dean also demonstrated other mechanical devices that were clearly different from his patent designs but apparently never sought patents for them nor otherwise revealed their design details or theory of operation. In 1978 physicist Russell Adams wrote an article in Analog. Searching in the US patent office he had found at least 50 patents for similar reactionless drives. After studying the mechanisms, he concluded that they all relied on friction against the floor they were placed on, and they would be useless in space, where there isn't friction against any surface.Russell E. Adams, Jr, \\"The Bootstrap Effect\\", Analog, April 1978 Dean's patented devices, and his explanation of how his Drive was supposed to work, were later shown to develop no net weight loss over time and do not violate Newton's third law of motion. Many other inventors claim to have invented similar devices, and they all still remain unproven, and lacking a solid theoretic basis. Later developments After Dean's death, neither the demonstration devices nor any working devices were found among his experiments. The demonstration devices were clearly different from the devices patented by Dean, and no diagrams were ever found for them. Consequently, it is impossible to test Dean's reported designs or devices to see if they worked as he claimed. In 1997 physicist John G. Cramer mentioned the Dean Drive in Analog in his column \\"Alternate View\\". He said that the demonstration made to Campbell was faulty, and the drive had turned out to be bogus, like many other claims of antigravity devices. In 2006 a NASA technical memorandum presented the Dean Drive as the most famous example of an \\"oscillation thruster\\" and examined its theoretical basis and feasibility as a space drive. It said that \\"Regrettably, such devices are not breakthroughs, since they still require a connection to the ground to create net motion. The ground is the reaction mass and the frictional connection to the ground is a necessary component to its operation.\\" NASA regularly receives proposals of similar devices, and the memo recommended that future reviews of said proposals \\"should require that submitters meet minimal thresholds of proof before engaging in further correspondence.\\" In 2012 a researcher attempting to characterize the Woodward effect, another proposed reactionless drive effect, has stated that she carefully designed her experiments to specifically exclude any \\"Dean drive\\" effects: the unintended interaction with the environment in, around or touching the apparatus. She considered these effects \\"spurious noise\\".

Jeoly was exhibited in London in 1691 for money as a one-man human zoo, until he died of smallpox three months later in London. Human zoos, also known as ethnological expositions, were 19th- and 20th-century public exhibitions of humans, usually in an erroneously labeled \\"natural\\" or \\"primitive\\" state. One-man human zoos also existed as early as the 17th century in Europe. The displays often emphasised the cultural differences between Europeans of Western civilization and non-European peoples or with other Europeans who practiced a lifestyle deemed more primitive. Some of them placed indigenous populations in a continuum somewhere between the great apes and Europeans. Ethnological expositions are now seen as highly degrading and racist, depending on the show and individuals involved.  First human zoos  A caricature of Saartjie Baartman, called the Hottentot Venus. Born to a Khoisan family, she was displayed in London in the early 19th century. = Key influences = Carl Hagenbeck was a German exotic animal businessman who became famous for his dominating the animal trade market during the mid- to late 1800s. Due to the costs of acquiring and keeping animals, the financial implications started to worry Hagenbeck, and he began looking for other ways to alleviate the company‚Äôs monetary strains. Heinrich Leutemann, an old friend of Hagenbeck's, suggested bringing along the people from the foreign lands to accompany the animals. The idea struck Hagenbeck as brilliant and he had a group of Laplanders accompany his next shipment of reindeer. They set up traditional houses and went about their business as usual on the Hagenbeck property. The display was so successful that Carl was organizing his second show before the first one was over. Although the concept of parading peoples captured from conquered lands goes back to the Romans, Hagenbeck claimed to have the first shows displaying ‚Äúcultures‚Äù from foreign lands. Carl Hagenbeck continued to bring indigenous people along with the animals that he was importing from across the globe. The people would come with their hunting equipment, homes, and other facets of their daily life. Hagenbeck‚Äôs displays evolved in complexity as the years went by. In 1876, Hagenbeck had a group of 6 Sami accompany a herd of reindeer, and by 1874 his acts included close to 67 men, women, and children in his Ceylon show performing with 25 elephants. The performances also expanded from showing everyday activities such as milking reindeer and building huts, to displaying some of the more extravagant parts of the cultures such as magicians, jugglers, and devil dancers The notion of the human curiosity has a history at least as long as colonialism. In the Western Hemisphere, one of the earliest-known zoos, that of Moctezuma in Mexico, consisted not only of a vast collection of animals, but also exhibited humans, for example, dwarves, albinos and hunchbacks.Mullan, Bob and Marvin Garry, Zoo culture: The book about watching people watch animals, University of Illinois Press, Urbana, Illinois, Second edition, 1998, p.32. During the Renaissance, the Medici developed a large menagerie in the Vatican. In the 16th century, Cardinal Hippolytus Medici had a collection of people of different races as well as exotic animals. He is reported as having a troupe of so-called Savages, speaking over twenty languages; there were also Moors, Tartars, Indians, Turks and Africans.Mullan, Bob and Marvin Garry, Zoo culture: The book about watching people watch animals, University of Illinois Press, Urbana, Illinois, Second edition, 1998, p.98.

In the 1870s, exhibitions of exotic populations became popular in various countries. Human zoos could be found in Paris, Hamburg, Antwerp, Barcelona, London, Milan, and New York City. Carl Hagenbeck, a merchant in wild animals and future entrepreneur of many zoos in Europe, decided in 1874 to exhibit Samoan and Sami people as \\"purely natural\\" populations. In 1876, he sent a collaborator to the Egyptian Sudan to bring back some wild beasts and Nubians. The Nubian exhibit was very successful in Europe and toured Paris, London, and Berlin. In 1880, Hagenbeck dispatched an agent to Labrador to secure a number of Esquimaux (Eskimo / Inuit) from the moravian mission of Hebron; these Inuit were exhibited in his Hamburg Tierpark... Hagenbeck would also employ agents to take part in his ethnological exhibits, with the aim of exposing his audience to various different subsistence modes and lifestyles. northwestern Somalia, who in the process accumulated much wealth, which they later reinvested in real estate in their homeland. The viceroy of India likewise gave Hagenbeck permission to hire local inhabitants for an exhibit, on the condition that Hagenbeck would first have to deposit funds into the royal treasury. Ethnology studies in Germany took a new approach in the 1870s as human displays were incorporated into zoos. These exhibits were lauded as educational to the general population by the scientific community of the time, because they were informative of the way that people lived across the world. Very quickly, the exhibits were used as a way to show that Europeans had evolved into a superior cosmopolitan life. Geoffroy de Saint-Hilaire, director of the Jardin d'acclimatation, decided in 1877 to organize two ethnological spectacles that presented Nubians and Inuit. That year, the audience of the Jardin d'acclimatation' doubled to one million. Between 1877 and 1912, approximately thirty ethnological exhibitions were presented at the Jardin zoologique d'acclimatation. Both the 1878 and the 1889 Parisian World's Fair presented a Negro Village (village n√®gre). Visited by 28 million people, the 1889 World's Fair displayed 400 indigenous people as the major attraction. The 1900 World's Fair presented the famous diorama living in Madagascar, while the Colonial Exhibitions in Marseilles (1906 and 1922) and in Paris (1907 and 1931) also displayed humans in cages, often nude or semi- nude. The 1931 exhibition in Paris was so successful that 34 million people attended it in six months, while a smaller counter-exhibition entitled The Truth on the Colonies, organized by the Communist Party, attracted very few visitors‚Äîin the first room, it recalled Albert Londres and Andr√© Gide's critiques of forced labour in the colonies. Nomadic Senegalese Villages were also presented. In 1883, native people of Suriname were displayed in the International Colonial and Export Exhibition in Amsterdam, held behind the Rijksmuseum. In 1886, the Spanish displayed natives of the Philippines in an exhibition, where pinunsulares, or Spanish people born in Spain, gawked at the natives who they perceived as people who they \\"civilized\\". This event added flame to the 1896 Philippine revolution. In the late 1800s, Hagenbeck organized exhibitions of indigenous populations from various parts of the globe. He staged a public display in 1886 of Sinhalese autochthones from the Sri Lanka. In 1893/1894, he also put together an exhibition of Sami/Lapps in Hamburg-Saint Paul. In the late 19th century, German ethnographic museums were an attempt at empirical study of human culture. They contained artifacts from cultures around the world organized by continent allowing visitors to see the similarities and differences between the groups and form their own ideas. The ethnographic museums of Germany were explicitly designed to steer away from projecting certain principles or instructing its viewers to interpret the material in a particular manner. They were instead left open for museum guests to form their own opinions. The directors of Germany's ethnographic museums intended to create a unifying history of mankind, to show how humans had progressed to the cosmopolitan creatures that walked the halls of these museums. At the 1901 Pan-American ExpositionSee Charles Dudley Arnold's photo similar human displays had been seen of six men dressed in Native-American costume, in front and on top of a reconstruction of a Six-Nations Long House. and at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, where Little Egypt performed bellydance, and where the photographers Charles Dudley Arnold and Harlow Higginbotham took depreciative photos, presenting indigenous people as catalogue of \\"types\\", along with sarcastic legends.Anne Maxell, \\"Montrer l'Autre: Franz Boas et les soeurs Gerhard\\", in Zoos humains.

The exhibition of Koreans and Okinawans in \\"primitive\\" housing incurred protests from the governments of Korea and Okinawa, and a Taiwanese woman wearing Chinese dress angered a group of Chinese students studying abroad in Tokyo. An Ainu schoolteacher was made to exhibit himself in the zoo in order to raise money for his schoolhouse, as the Japanese government refused to pay. The fact that the schoolteacher made eloquent speeches and fundraised for his school while wearing traditional dress confused the spectators. An anonymous front-page column in a Japanese magazine condemned these examples and the \\"Human Pavilion\\" in total, calling it inhumane to exhibit people as spectacles. In 1896, to increase the number of visitors, the Cincinnati Zoo invited one hundred Sioux Native Americans to establish a village at the site. The Sioux lived at the zoo for three months.Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden, Ohio Historical Society. S√°mi in Hamburg-Saint Paul In 1904, Apaches and Igorots (from the Philippines) were displayed at the Saint Louis World Fair in association with the 1904 Summer Olympics. The US had just acquired, following the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, new territories such as Guam, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico, allowing them to \\"display\\" some of the native inhabitants. In 1906, Madison Grant‚Äîsocialite, eugenicist, amateur anthropologist, and head of the New York Zoological Society‚Äîhad Congolese pygmy Ota Benga put on display at the Bronx Zoo in New York City alongside apes and other animals. At the behest of Grant, the zoo director William Hornaday placed Benga displayed in a cage with the chimpanzees, then with an orangutan named Dohong, and a parrot, and labeled him The Missing Link, suggesting that in evolutionary terms Africans like Benga were closer to apes than were Europeans. It triggered protests from the city's clergymen, but the public reportedly flocked to see it.Bradford, Phillips Verner and Blume, Harvey. Ota Benga: The Pygmy in the Zoo. St. Martins Press, 1992. Ad for a Carl Hagenbeck show (1886) Benga shot targets with a bow and arrow, wove twine, and wrestled with an orangutan. Although, according to The New York Times, \\"few expressed audible objection to the sight of a human being in a cage with monkeys as companions\\", controversy erupted as black clergymen in the city took great offense. \\"Our race, we think, is depressed enough, without exhibiting one of us with the apes\\", said the Reverend James H. Gordon, superintendent of the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum in Brooklyn. \\"We think we are worthy of being considered human beings, with souls.\\" New York City Mayor George B. McClellan Jr. refused to meet with the clergymen, drawing the praise of Hornaday, who wrote to him: \\"When the history of the Zoological Park is written, this incident will form its most amusing passage.\\" As the controversy continued, Hornaday remained unapologetic, insisting that his only intention was to put on an ethnological exhibition. In another letter, he said that he and Grant‚Äîwho ten years later would publish the racist tract The Passing of the Great Race‚Äîconsidered it \\"imperative that the society should not even seem to be dictated to\\" by the black clergymen. On Monday, September 8, 1906, after just two days, Hornaday decided to close the exhibition, and Benga could be found walking the zoo grounds, often followed by a crowd \\"howling, jeering and yelling.\\" Between 1 May and 31 October 1908 the Scottish National Exhibition, opened by one of Queen Victoria‚Äôs grandsons, Prince Arthur of Connaught, was held in Saughton Park, Edinburgh. One of the attractions was the Senegal Village with its French-speaking Senegalese residents, on show demonstrating their way of life, art and craft while living in beehive huts. In 1909, the infrastructure of the 1908 Scottish National Exhibition in Edinburgh was used to construct the new Marine Gardens to the coast near Edinburgh at Portobello. A group of Somalian men, women and children were shipped over to be part of the exhibition, living in thatched huts. Grand Colonial Exhibition (Meiji Memorial Takushoku Expo) at Tennoji Park, Osaka in 1913 (ÊòéÊ≤ªË®òÂøµÊãìÊÆñÂçöË¶ß‰ºöÔºàÂè∞ÊπæÂúü‰∫∫„Éé‰ΩèÂÆÖÂèäÂÖ∂È¢®‰øóÔºâ) In 1925, a display at Belle Vue Zoo in Manchester, England, was entitled \\"Cannibals\\" and featured black Africans depicted as savages.Paul A. Rees, An Introduction to Zoo Biology and Management, Wiley- Blackwell, John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester (West Sussex), 2011, p.44. By the 1930s, a new kind of human zoo appeared in America, nude shows masquerading as education. These included the Zoro Garden Nudist Colony at the Pacific International Exposition in San Diego, California (1935-6) and the Sally Rand Nude Ranch at the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco (1939). The former was supposedly a real nudist colony, which used hired performers instead of actual nudists. The latter featured nude women performing in western attire. The Golden Gate fair also featured a \\"Greenwich Village\\" show, described in the Official Guide Book as ‚ÄúModel artists‚Äô colony and revue theatre.‚Äù As Ethnogenic expositions were discontinued in Germany around 1931, there were many repercussions for the performers. Many of the people brought from their homelands to work in the exhibits had created families in Germany, and there were many children that had been born in Germany. Once they no longer worked in the zoos or for performance acts, these people were stuck living in Germany where they had no rights and were harshly discriminated against. During the rise of the Nazi party, the foreign actors in these stage shows were typically able to stay out of concentration camps because there were so few of them that the Nazis did not see them as a real threat.‚Äú‚ÄòYou Better Go Back to Africa‚Äô Interview.‚Äù \\"You Better Go Back to Africa\\" Interview, DW English, 18 June 2017, www.youtube.com/watch?v=baGXUsOKBcU. Although they were able to avoid concentration camps, they were not able to participate in German life as citizens of ethnically German origin could. The Hitler Youth did not allow children of foreign parents to participate, and adults were rejected as German soldiers. Many ended up working in war industry factories or foreign laborer camps. After World War II ended, racism in Germany became more concealed or invisible, but it did not go away. Many people of foreign descent intended to leave after the war, but because of their German nationality, it was difficult for them to emigrate.  1940s to the present  Congo village exhibition in Oslo (2014) A Congolese village was displayed at the Brussels 1958 World's Fair.

(French) In July 2005, the Augsburg Zoo in Germany hosted an \\"African village\\" featuring African crafts and African cultural performances. The event was subject to widespread criticism. ; ; ; ; Critical analysis of the Augsburg human zoo (\\"Organizers and visitors were not racist but they participated in and reflected a process that has been called racialization: the daily and often taken-for-granted means by which humans are separated into supposedly biologically based and unequal categories\\", etc.) Defenders of the event argued that it was not racist since it did not involve exhibiting Africans in a debasing way, as had been done at zoos in the past. Critics argued that presenting African culture in the context of a zoo contributed to exoticizing and stereotyping Africans, thus laying the ground work for racial discrimination. In August 2005, London Zoo displayed four human volunteers wearing fig leaves (and bathing suits) for four days.London Zoo official website ;;; In 2007, Adelaide Zoo ran a Human Zoo exhibition which consisted of a group of people who, as part of a study exercise, had applied to be housed in the former ape enclosure by day, but then returned home by night. The inhabitants took part in several exercises, and spectators were asked for donations towards a new ape enclosure. Also in 2007, pygmy performers at the Festival of Pan-African Music (Fespam) were housed at a zoo in Brazzaville, Congo. Although members of the group of 20 people‚Äîamong them an infant, age three months‚Äîwere not officially on display, it was necessary for them to \\"collect firewood in the zoo to cook their food, and [they] were being stared at and filmed by tourists and passers-by\\". In August 2014, as part of the Edinburgh International Festival, South African theatre-maker Brett Bailey's show Exhibit B was performed in the Playfair Library Hall, University of Edinburgh; then in September at The Barbican in London. This explored the nature of Human Zoos and raised much controversy both amongst the performers and the audiences. With a view to tackling the morality of Human Zoo exhibits, 2018 saw the poster exhibition, Putting People on Display, tour Glasgow School of Art, the University of Edinburgh, the University of Stirling, the University of St Andrews and the University of Aberdeen. Additional posters were added to a selection from the French ACHAC's exhibition, Human Zoos: the Invention of the Savage, in relation to the Scottish dimension in hosting such shows.

Among its various provisions, it established the Southeastern Power Administration and the Southwestern Power Administration, and led to the establishment of the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program. The Pick-Sloan legislation managed the Missouri River with six intents: hydropower, recreation, water supply, navigation, flood control and fish and wildlife. Over 50 dams and lakes have been built due to this legislation, not just on the mainly affected river but also on tributaries and other connected rivers. Nebraska, as an example, has seen more than eight new lakes created due to the damming of the Missouri and tributaries. The Act also recognized the legitimate rights of states, through the Governor, to impact flood control projects. See 33 US section 701-1 which declared it to be the policy of the Congress > to recognize the interests and rights of the States in determining the > development of the watersheds within their borders and likewise their > interests and rights in water utilization and control. 33 USC section 701 The Act was signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on December 22, 1944. It was named for General Lewis A. Pick, head of the Army Corps of Engineers, and W. Glenn Sloan of the Interior Department's Bureau of Reclamation. Effects The Lakota, Dakota and Nakota tribes lost . The Three Affiliated Tribes, specifically, lost in their Fort Berthold Reservation due to the building of the Garrison Dam. The project caused more than 1,500 Native Americans to relocate from the river bottoms of the Missouri river due to the flooding. The project has successfully controlled flooding throughout the Missouri River basin, provided water for irrigation and municipalities, generated baseload power throughout the central US. However, the Missouri River dumped millions of cubic feet of soil into the Mississippi River every year, which, deposited the silt into the gulf and formed a string of barrier islands. When the silt was eliminated, the island-building stopped. Biologists sounded the alarm in the 1970s. By the 1990s, the barrier islands were almost gone, and Louisiana was left unprotected from storm surges and oil spills.

Conger was born in Cooperstown, New York and moved with his father, the Rev. E. Conger, to Huron County, Ohio in 1824. He pursued academic studies at the Huron Institute in Milan, Ohio, and graduated from Western Reserve College (now Case Western Reserve University) in Hudson, Ohio in 1841. He engaged in mineral explorations of the Lake Superior copper and iron regions in connection with the Michigan State Geological Survey 1845-1847. He engaged in the practice of law in Port Huron, Michigan in 1848 and was elected judge of the St. Clair County Court in 1850. He was a member of the Michigan State Senate 1855-1859, and served as President pro tempore in 1859. He was a member of the State military board during the Civil War, holding the rank of colonel. He was a Presidential Elector for Michigan in 1864 and a member of the State constitutional convention in 1866. He was elected as a Republican to the United States House of Representatives for the 41st United States Congress and to the five succeeding Congresses, serving from March 4, 1869, until March 4, 1881. He represented Michigan's 5th congressional district from 1869 to 1873 and became the first person to represent the 7th district from 1873 to 1881. Conger was re-elected to the House for the 47th Congress in the general election on November 2, 1880. He was subsequently elected by the Michigan Legislature to the United States Senate on January 18, 1881. Conger served the remainder of his term in the House for 46th Congress and resigned from the House for the next term to serve in the Senate. John T. Rich was elected in a special election April 4, 1881, to fill the vacancy in the House. While in the House, Conger served as chairman, Committee on Expenditures in the State Department in the 42nd Congress, and the Committee on Patents in the 43rd Congress. Conger was elected in 1880 as a Republican to the United States Senate and served from March 4, 1881 to March 4, 1887. He was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1886. He served as chairman, Committee on Manufactures in the 47th Congress, the Committee on the Revision of the Laws in the 48th Congress, and the Committee on Post Office and Post Roads in the 49th Congress. After leaving Congress, he engaged in the practice of law in Washington, D.C. and died in Ocean City, Maryland. He is interred in Lakeside Cemetery, Port Huron, Michigan. Conger also played an important role in the establishment of the American Red Cross. On May 12, 1881, Clara Barton, who became the first president of the organization, organized a meeting at Sen. Conger's home. The 15 people present at this meeting include Barton, Conger, and Rep. William Lawrence (R, OH). Senator Conger is the namesake for Fort Conger, the pioneering Arctic outpost established by Augustus Greeley's 1881 expedition and named by the explorer in gratitude for the senator's support. Conger's legacy can also be seen in the street names in Port Huron, Michigan. The two streets closest to the lake are named Omar Street and Conger Avenue, and are just a few blocks away from Lakeside Cemetery where he is interred. Additionally, there was a short-lived settlement established in the Thumb called \\"Omard\\", which was named in honor of the senator using his first name \\"Omar\\" and his middle initial \\"D\\". The Library of Congress lists a single published work by Conger in its catalog. This is the 15 page pamphlet titled A Plain Review, published in Washington, DC in 1892. Its subject is French spoliation claims. The call number there is E321 .C74. His grandson was also named Omar Dwight Conger and graduated from Harvard University before being killed in San Diego during World War II.

The intended beneficial uses of these water resources include flood control, aids to navigation, irrigation, supplemental water supply, power generation, municipal and industrial water supplies, stream-pollution abatement, sediment control, preservation and enhancement of fish and wildlife, and creation of recreation opportunities. It derives its name from the authors of the program‚ÄìLewis A. Pick, director of the Missouri River office of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and William Glenn Sloan, director of the Billings, Montana office of the United States Bureau of Reclamation.Bureau of Reclamation (July 29, 2004) Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program History =The Pick Plan= In May 1943, the House Flood Control Committee chose the United States Army Corps of Engineers to create a solution for extreme flooding in the Missouri Basin. Lewis A. Pick developed a proposal for the corps called the Pick Plan, which was finished in August of the same year. The Pick Plan introduced three different projects to be carried out by the Army Corps of Engineers. The first undertaking involved the construction of 1,500 miles of levees from Sioux City to the Mississippi River to protect from Missouri River flooding. The second proposal called for the construction of eighteen dams on Missouri's tributaries. Eleven of those dams had been previously approved by Congress. Five dams were planned to be located on tributaries of the Republican River in the lower basin. Of the remaining dams, the Pick Plan recommended construction of one on the Bighorn River in Wyoming and another on Montana's Yellowstone River. The Pick Plan's third project was the creation of five multi-purpose dams on the Missouri River. Initially, the plan's total cost was estimated to be $490 million. The original Pick Plan was supported by the National Rivers and Harbors Congress, the Mississippi Valley Association, the Propeller Club of the United States, the American Merchant Marine Conference, the Mississippi Valley Flood Control Association, and other lower-basin residents. Senators Joseph O'Mahoney and Eugene Millikin offered amendments to the plan that would also provide for the interests of people in the upper basin. The amendments created an emphasis on irrigation over river navigation and gave precedence to arid states for the use of basin water. O'Mahoney and Millikin's amendments also called for Congress to inform any states associated with proposed watershed development. The amendments were later added to the Pick Plan. =The Sloan Plan= The Sloan Plan was developed by William G. Sloan, the assistant director at the Bureau of Reclamation's regional office who had previously worked for the Corps of Engineers. The plan was submitted on May 4, 1944, to Congress. In contrast to the Pick Plan, Sloan's strategy was more intricate. His 211-page program involved plans for ninety irrigation and power development projects. It was proposed with a budget of $1.26 billion. The Sloan Plan pushed for reservoir storage in upper tributaries of the Missouri River located in smaller dams, which would provide irrigation for 4.8 million acres in areas where the land suffered from drought. The Sloan Plan allotted 1.3 million acres of irrigated land in North Dakota. South Dakota, Montana, and Nebraska were allotted about 1 million acres each. The plan picked up support from the National Reclamation Association and the National Grange. =The Omaha Conference= On October 17, 1944, the Omaha Conference was scheduled for the consolidation of the Pick and Sloan plans. In total, the plans had proposed 113 different projects. Once the plans were merged, 107 of those projects remained. The combined Pick-Sloan Plan allowed the Corps of Engineers jurisdiction over flood control, navigation projects and five main-stem dams. The Bureau of Reclamation was granted permission to build 27 dams in the Yellowstone Basin. In addition, the Corps of Engineers and the Reclamation Bureau were both given authority to develop hydroelectric power on the Missouri River. The newly merged Pick Sloan Plan was accepted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944. It was officially titled as the Missouri River Basin Development Program and was presented in conjunction with the Flood Control Act of 1944. President Roosevelt authorized $200 million for the program. In its entirety, the Pick- Sloan Plan arranged for 107 dams, 1,500 miles of protective levees, 4.7 million acres of irrigation systems, and 1.6 million kilowatts of electric power. =Early Critics= Many early critics of the Pick-Sloan plan were in favor of creating a Missouri Valley Authority (MVA). They claimed that the MVA would provide a more unified solution to water development on the Missouri River than the merged ideas of opposing bureaucracies. Ideas for the MVA were influenced by the success of the Tennessee Valley Authority. Senator James E. Murray of Montana and Congressman John J. Cochran from Missouri developed bills for the Missouri Valley Authority. The MVA bills planned to navigate Missouri into a number of stairstep lakes linked together by locks. They would also arrange for giant reservoirs to supply irrigation and cheap hydroelectricity power, arguing that this would produce more public power and leave less condemned private land. The bills were presented in the 79th Congress, but they were later brought down. Interventions Several water- control measures were introduced through the Pick-Sloan Legislation that variously affected the Missouri River Valley and its environs. The Pick-Sloan Program dams built between 1946 and 1966 are: * Canyon Ferry Dam and Lake in Montana * Garrison Dam and Lake Sakakawea in North Dakota * Oahe Dam and Lake Oahe in South Dakota * Big Bend Dam and Lake Sharpe in South Dakota * Fort Randall Dam and Lake Francis Case in South Dakota * Gavins Point Dam and Lewis and Clark Lake in South Dakota and Nebraska Based on Pick-Sloan legislation, the Reclamation Project Authorization Act of October 20, 1972 authorized the Bureau of Reclamation to built additional dams at the North Loup River and Middle Loup River in Nebraska: Six dams were constructed between 1976 and 1994:Bureau of Reclamation: Resource Management Plan: Calamus Reservoir, Nebraska Great Plains Region. In: U.S. Bureau of Land Management Papers. Paper 39, 2010 (Bureau of Reclamation: '#Resource Management Plan: Calamus Reservoir, Nebraska, June 2010) * Davis Creek Dam * Virginia Smith Dam and Calamus Lake (formlery Calamus Dam and Reservoir) at the Calamus River * Kent Diversion Dam * Sherman Dam and Reservoir * Milburn Diversion Dam * Arcadia Diversion Dam Other dams along the Missouri River that were not part of the Sloan-Pick Program are Toston Dam (1940), Hauser Dam (1907), Holter Dam (1908), Black Eagle Dam (1927), Rainbow Dam (1912), Cochrane Dam (1958), Ryan Dam (1915), Morony Dam (1930) and Fort Peck Dam (1940), all located in Montana.  Native American relocation  Over 200,000 acres on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation and the Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota were flooded by the Oahe Dam, forcing Native Americans to relocate from flooded areas. In South Dakota, politicians and other proponents of the Pick- Sloan Program and dam construction had promised 1 million acres of irrigation as ‚Äúappropriate compensation‚Äù for lost land. As of 2016, poverty remains a problem for the displaced populations in the Dakotas, who are still seeking compensation for the loss of the towns submerged under Lake Oahe, and the loss of their traditional ways of life. The construction of main-stream dams also affected other Native American tribes living along the Missouri River on the Fort Berthold, Cheyenne River, Standing Rock, Crow Creek, and Lower Brule Indian reservations. The Garrison, Oahe, and Fort Randall dams created a reservoir that eliminated 90 percent of timber and 75 percent of wildlife on the reservations. According to Native American historian Vine Deloria Jr., the \\"Pick-Sloan Plan was, without doubt, the single most destructive act ever perpetrated on any tribe by the United States.\\"  References  Category:Missouri River Category:Flood control in the United States Category:Irrigation in the United States ","title":"Pick‚ÄìSloan Missouri Basin Program"},{"id":"866561","text":"Pond Creek may refer to: *Pond Creek (Mill Creek), a stream in Missouri *Pond Creek (Sac River), a stream in Missouri *Pond Creek (Little Wapwallopen Creek), in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania *Pond Creek, Oklahoma, a city in USA *Pond Creek, West Virginia, an unincorporated community in USA *Pond Creek (West Virginia), a stream in USA *Pond Creek National Wildlife Refuge in Arkansas, USA *Pond Creek Station, stagecoach station in Wallace, Kansas, USA *Ponds Creek, a creek in New South Wales, Australia See also * Pond (disambiguation) ","title":"Pond Creek"},{"id":"866565","text":"The alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) is an anadromous species of herring found in North America.

(HTML abstract) As an adult it is a marine species found in the northern West Atlantic Ocean, moving into estuaries before swimming upstream to breed in freshwater habitats, but some populations live entirely in fresh water. It is best known for its invasion of the Great Lakes by using the Welland Canal to bypass Niagara Falls. Here, its population surged, peaking between the 1950s and 1980s to the detriment of many native species of fish. In an effort to control them biologically, Pacific salmon were introduced, only partially successfully. As a marine fish, the alewife is a US National Marine Fisheries Service \\"Species of Concern\\". Description Alewife reach a maximum length of about 40 cm (16 in), but have an average length of about 25 cm (10 in). The front of the body is deep and larger than other fish found in the same waters, and its common name is said to come from comparison with a corpulent female tavernkeeper (\\"ale- wife\\").Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition Etymology and folklore In southwestern Nova Scotia, alewife are referred to as kiacks (or kyacks). In Atlantic Canada it is known as the gaspereau, from the Acadian French word gasparot, first mentioned by Nicolas Denys. William Francis Ganong, New Brunswick biologist and historian, wrote: > Gaspereau, or Gasparot. Name of a common salt-water fish of Acadia (also > called alewife), first used, so far as I can find, by Denys in 1672\\\\. > Nowhere can I find any clue to its origin. It seems not to be Indian. Acadians named two rivers after the fish, the Gaspereau River in Nova Scotia and the Gaspereau River in New Brunswick. In eastern Massachusetts, Alewife Brook flows through Arlington, Cambridge, and Somerville to the Mystic River. The brook gives its name to the Alewife Brook Parkway and the Alewife Brook Reservation. The Red Line (MBTA) of Boston's T ends at the Alewife station, so the name of this fish adorns the front of every northbound Red Line train. An extensive habitat restoration and education project, combined with a fish ladder with monitoring cameras, is yielding increasing numbers of Alewife back in the improving Mystic River watershed.Mystic River Herring Monitoring project In the Southeast US, when sold and used as bait, the fish is often referred to as \\"LY\\". Both anadromous and landlocked forms occur. The landlocked form is also called a sawbelly or mooneye (although this latter name is more commonly applied to Hiodon spp.). Adult alewife are caught during their spring spawning migration upstream by being scooped out of shallow, constricted areas using large dip nets. They are the preferred bait for the spring lobster fishery in Maine, and are eaten by humans, usually smoked. In the North American Great Lakes Alewife are known for their invasion of the Great Lakes by using the Welland Canal to bypass Niagara Falls. Alewife colonized the Great Lakes and became abundant mostly in Lake Huron and Lake Michigan. They reached their peak abundance from the 1950s through the 1980s. Alewife grew in number unchecked because of the lack of a top predator in the lakes (lake trout were essentially wiped out around the same time by overfishing and the invasion of the sea lamprey). For a time, alewife, which often exhibit seasonal die-offs, washed up in windrows on the shorelines of the Great Lakes. Various species of Pacific salmon (first coho, and later the Chinook salmon) were introduced as predators. Though marginally successful, this led to the development of a salmon/alewife fishery popular with many sport anglers. In spite of such biological control methods, alewife remain implicated in the decline of many native Great Lakes species. It is also a common predator of numerous native and non-native zooplankton taxa (Bythotrephes longimanus, Leptodiaptomus ashlandi, Leptodiaptomus minutus, Leptodiaptomus sicilis, and Leptodora kindtii). Conservation Alewife populations have seen big declines throughout much of their range. Several threats have most likely contributed to their decline, including loss of habitat due to decreased access to spawning areas from the construction of dams and other impediments to migration, habitat degradation, fishing, and increased predation due to recovering striped bass populations. In response to the declining population trend for alewives, the states of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Virginia, and North Carolina have instituted moratoria on taking and possession. The alewife is a US National Marine Fisheries Service Species of Concern,http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/species/concern/ about which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, has some concerns regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient information is available to indicate a need to list the species under the US Endangered Species Act.

Established in 1907 by the German government together with German physicians in Shanghai, Tongji is one of the oldest and most selective, most prestigious universities in China. It is a Chinese Ministry of Education Class A Double First Class University. Tongji University is especially renowned for its engineering, business and architecture programs. The university possesses a faculty of more than 2,803 scholars, including 27 members from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Currently, Tongji University owns 29 colleges, 8 affiliated hospitals, and 6 affiliated primary and secondary schools. The College of Civil Engineering has consistently ranked first in China for decades. The School of Economics and Management (Tongji SEM) is one of 74 business schools in the world being triple accredited by the European Quality Improvement System (EQUIS), the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and the Association of MBAs (AMBA). Tongji University is a member of the Yangtze Delta Universities Alliance and Asian-European Laotse Universities Network. According to the 2018 QS World University Rankings and the 2018 Times Higher Education Rankings, Tongji University ranked 10th nationally. History The history of Tongji University can be traced back to 1907 when the German Medical School for the Chinese in Shanghai was founded by the German government together with the German physicians Erich Paulun, Oscar von Schab and Paul Krieg. The school was affiliated with the Tongji-Hospital the German physicians had established in Shanghai on the initiative of Paulun.See Roswitha Reinbothe (ed.), Tongji- Universit√§t in Shanghai. Dokumente zur Gr√ºndungsgeschichte, Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz 2009. The name Tongji, which is a phonetic approximation in Shanghainese of German deutsche (\\"German\\"), suggests cooperating by riding the same boat. The school was expanded to include engineering in its programs and got its new name as German Medical and Engineering School for the Chinese in Shanghai in 1912.The degrees granted by the German Medical College in Shanghai corresponded to the degrees granted by medical schools in Germany. It was formally established as a Chinese university under the name of Tongji University in 1923/1924 and was renamed as National Tongji University in 1927. During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937‚Äì1945), the university campus was moved from Shanghai first to Zhejiang Province, then to Jiangxi Province and Yunnan Province and later to Sichuan Province. It was eventually moved back to Shanghai in 1946.With a few exceptions, the German members of the Faculty of Medicine stayed behind in Shanghai and established in 1940 in the International Settlement the Shanghai German Medical Academy (Deutsche medizinische Akademie Shanghai; alternative spelling Schanghai). The school functioned at 82 Tongfu Road (later Shimenyi Road) and at #10, 100 Changshu Road, continuing medical and educational activities throughout the war. Upon the return of the National Tongji University to Shanghai, the Academy, with all its students, was re-integrated in the Faculty of Medicine. See (History of) #10, 100 Changshu Road (Shanghai) , in Chinese. It then grew to be a comprehensive university which offered programs in science, engineering, medicine, arts, and law. Following a nationwide campaign of reorganizing schools and departments between universities in 1952, Tongji University became a university knowns for its civil engineering and architecture programs. Tongji is also the first university that introduced Urban Planning into China. In 1952, the first twelve full professors of Tongji are: Li Guohao, Âë®ÂøµÂÖà (Zhou Nianxian), Èí±‰ª≤ÊØÖ (Qian Zhongyi), ÈôàË∂Ö (Chen Chao), Âë®ÊñπÁôΩ (Âë®Âú≠), ÊùéÂØøÂ∫∑, et al. As a university which had established a reputation for its research, Tongji became one of the first batch of universities which were authorized by the China State Council to establish its Graduate School. As one of the leading universities, it was successful in its application for the 211 Program which provided universities with substantial government fund. In 1995, the university became one to be jointly supported by the State Education Commission and the Shanghai Municipal Government. In 1996 the university merged with Shanghai Institute of Urban Construction and Shanghai Institute of Building Materials. The merger was acknowledged by the State Council as \\"Tongji Model\\" in the system renovation of higher institutions in China. In April 2000, the expanded Tongji merged again with Shanghai Railway University. Now Tongji University has become a comprehensive university which offers a wide range of programs in science, engineering, medicine, arts, law, economics and management.tongji history =Timeline= *November 2010 - Signed a cooperation agreement with Instituto Superior T√©cnico making IST the Portuguese Campus of Tongji University *July 2005 - Signed a cooperation agreement with Politecnico di Milano and Politecnico di Torino concerning the development of Sino-Italian University Campus in Shanghai and establishment of a Sino-Italian House, one year later a dual bachelor's degree project in engineering, called PoliTong, was launched *2002 - Listed in Project 985 *April 2000 - Merged with Shanghai Railway University (a merge between Shanghai Railway College and Shanghai Railway Medical College in May 1995) *August 1996 - Merged with Shanghai Institute of Urban Construction and Shanghai Institute of Building Materials *November 1995 - Listed in Project 211 *October 1995 - Declared to be jointly built by the former State Education Commission and the Shanghai Municipal Government *December 1978 - Upon consent by the State Council, resumed connection with Germany and became the window of the cultural, technology and science exchanges between China and Germany *February 1972 - Tongji University merged with the Marine Geology Department of East China Normal University *1952 - The Departments of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry in College of Science merged into Fudan University, the Departments of Machinery, Electrical Engineering and Ship Manufacture merged into Shanghai Jiaotong University.

Gravity dams are designed so that each section of the dam is stable and independent of any other dam section. Design of Gravity Dams, Bureau of Reclamation, 1976 Design of Small Dams, Bureau of Reclamation, 1987  Characteristics  Gravity dams generally require stiff rock foundations of high bearing strength (slightly weathered to fresh); although in rare cases they have been built on soil foundations. The bearing strength of the foundation limits the allowable position of the resultant force, influencing the overall stability. Also, the stiff nature of the gravity dam structure is unforgiving to differential foundation settlement, which can induce cracking of the dam structure. Gravity dams provide some advantages over embankment dams, the main advantage being that they can tolerate minor over-topping flows without damage, as the concrete is resistant to scouring. Large over-topping flows are still a problem, as they can scour the foundations if not accounted for in the design. A disadvantage of gravity dams is that due to their large footprint, they are susceptible to uplift pressures which act as a de- stabilising force. Uplift pressures (buoyancy) can be reduced by internal and foundation drainage systems. During construction, the setting concrete produces an exothermic reaction. This heat expands the plastic concrete and can take up to several decades to cool. While cooling the concrete is stiff and susceptible to cracking. It is the designer's task to ensure this does not occur.  Design  Gravity dams are built by first cutting away a large part of the land in one section of a river, allowing water to fill the space and be stored. Once the land has been cut away, the soil has to be tested to make sure it can support the weight of the dam and the water. It is important to make sure the soil will not erode over time, which would allow the water to cut a way around or under the dam. Sometimes the soil is sufficient to achieve these goals; however, other times it requires conditioning by adding support rocks which will bolster the weight of the dam and water. There are three different tests that can be done to determine the foundation's support strength: the Westergaard, Eulerian, and Lagrangian approaches. Once the foundation is suitable to build on, construction of the dam can begin. Usually gravity dams are built out of a strong material such as concrete or stone blocks, and are built into a triangular shape to provide the most support.  Classifications  The most common classification of gravity dams is by the materials composing the structure: * Concrete dams include ** mass concrete dams, made of: *** conventional concrete: Dworshak Dam, Grand Coulee Dam *** Roller-Compacted Concrete (RCC): Willow Creek Dam (Oregon), Upper Stillwater Dam ** masonry: Pathfinder Dam, Cheesman Dam ** hollow gravity dams, made of reinforced concrete: Braddock Dam Composite dams are a combination of concrete and embankment dams. Construction materials of composite dams are the same used for concrete and embankment dams. Gravity dams can be classified by plan (shape): * Most gravity dams are straight (Grand Coulee Dam). * Some masonry and concrete gravity dams have the dam axis curved (Shasta Dam, Cheesman Dam) to add stability through arch action.Gravity Dam Design, US Army Corps of Engineers, EM 1110-2-2200, June 1995 Gravity dams can be classified with respect to their structural height: * Low, up to 100 feet. * Medium high, between 100 and 300 feet. * High, over 300 feet.  Earthquakes and ecosystems  Gravity dams are built to withstand some of the strongest earthquakes. Even though the foundation of gravity dams are built to support the weight of the dam and all the water, it is quite flexible in that it absorbs a large amount of energy and sends it in the earth's crust. It needs to be able to absorb the energy from an earthquake because, if the dam were to break, it would send a mass amount of water rushing downstream and destroying everything in its way. Earthquakes are the biggest danger to gravity dams and that is why, every year and after every major earthquake, they must be tested for cracks, durability, and strength. Although gravity dams are expected to last anywhere 50‚Äì150 years, they need to be maintained and regularly replaced. Another problem with gravity dams involves ecosystems. Because the flow and amount of water changes when a dam is built, it generally has an impact on the area of the dam and everything afterwards. If water that normally flows two weeks out of the year in an area is now flowing constantly, new life is going to start living and growing there. Similarly, if you cut off water to somewhere that has water flow year round, things are going to start dying. Many environmentalists have problems with dams because of their effects on the environment.

The Morrow Point Dam is a double-curvature arch dam. An arch dam is a concrete dam that is curved upstream in plan. The arch dam is designed so that the force of the water against it, known as hydrostatic pressure, presses against the arch, causing the arch to straighten slightly and strengthening the structure as it pushes into its foundation or abutments. An arch dam is most suitable for narrow canyons or gorges with steep walls of stable rock to support the structure and stresses. Since they are thinner than any other dam type, they require much less construction material, making them economical and practical in remote areas. Classification In general, arch dams are classified based on the ratio of the base thickness to the structural height (b/h) as: * Thin, for b/h less than 0.2, * Medium-thick, for b/h between 0.2 and 0.3, and * Thick, for b/h ratio over 0.3. Arch dams classified with respect to their structural height are: * Low dams up to , * Medium high dams between , * High dams over .  History  ShƒÅh AbbƒÅs Arch near Kurit Dam ‚Äì 14th century The development of arch dams throughout history began with the Romans in the 1st century BC and after several designs and techniques were developed, relative uniformity was achieved in the 20th century. The first known arch dam, the Glanum Dam, also known as the Vallon de Baume Dam, was built by the Romans in France and it dates back to the 1st century BC. from archive.org The dam was about high and in length. Its radius was about , and it consisted of two masonry walls. The Romans built it to supply nearby Glanum with water. The Monte Novo Dam in Portugal was another early arch dam built by the Romans in 300 AD. It was high and , with a radius of . The curved ends of the dam met with two winged walls that were later supported by two buttresses. The dam also contained two water outlets to drive mills downstream. The Dara Dam was another arch dam built by the Romans in which the historian Procopius would write of its design: \\"This barrier was not built in a straight line, but was bent into the shape of a crescent, so that the curve, by lying against the current of the river, might be able to offer still more resistance to the force of the stream.\\" The Mongols also built arch dams in modern-day Iran. Their earliest was the Kebar Dam built around 1300, which was high and long, and had a radius of . Their second dam was built around 1350 and is called the Kurit Dam. After was added to the dam in 1850, it became tall and remained the tallest dam in the world until the early 20th century. The Kurit Dam was of masonry design and built in a very narrow canyon. The canyon was so narrow that its crest length is only 44% of its height. The dam is still erect, even though part of its lower downstream face fell off. The Elche Dam in Elche, Spain was a post-medieval arch dam built in the 1630s by Joanes del Temple and the first in Europe since the Romans. The dam was high and long, and had a radius of . This arch dam also rests on winged walls that served as abutments. In the 20th century, the world's first variable-radius arch dam was built on the Salmon Creek near Juneau, Alaska. The Salmon Creek Dam's upstream face bulged upstream, which relieved pressure on the stronger, curved lower arches near the abutments. The dam also had a larger toe, which off-set pressure on the upstream heel of the dam, which now curved more downstream. The technology and economical benefits of the Salmon Creek Dam allowed for larger and taller dam designs. The dam was, therefore, revolutionary, and similar designs were soon adopted around the world, in particular by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. In 1920, the Swiss engineer and dam designer Alfred Stucky developed new calculation methods for arch dams, introducing the concept of elasticity during the construction of the Montsalvens arch dam in Switzerland, thereby improving the dam profile in the vertical direction by using a parabolic arch shape instead of a circular arch shape. The Enguri Dam in the Caucasas of Georgia. Pensacola Dam, completed in the state of Oklahoma in 1940, was considered the longest multiple arch dam in the United States. Designed by W. R. Holway, it has 51 arches. and a maximum height of above the river bed. The total length of the dam and its sections is while the multiple-arch section is long and its combination with the spillway sections measure . Each arch in the dam has a clear span of and each buttress is wide.National Register of Historic Places. Pensacola Dam\\". Accessed January 3, 2016. Arch dam designs would continue to test new limits and designs such as the double- and multiple-curve. The Swiss engineer Alfred Stucky and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation would develop a method of weight and stress distribution in the 1960s, and arch dam construction in the United States would see its last surge then with dams like the 143-meter double-curved Morrow Point Dam in Colorado, completed in 1968. By the late 20th century, arch dam design reached a relative uniformity in design around the world. Currently, the tallest arch dam in the world is the Jingpin-I Dam in China, which was completed in 2013. The longest multiple arch with buttress dam in the world is the Daniel-Johnson Dam in Quebec, Canada. It is high and long across its crest. It was completed in 1968 and put in service in 1970. Pensacola Dam was one of the last multiple arch types built in the United States. Its NRHP application states that this was because three dams of this type failed: (1) Gem Lake Dam, St. Francis Dam (California), Lake Hodges Dam (California). None of these failures were inherently caused by the multiple arch design.  Design  The design of an arch dam is a very complex process. It starts with an initial dam layout, that is continually improved until the design objectives are achieved within the design criteria. =Loads= The main loads for which an arch dam is designed are: * Dead load * Hydrostatic load generated by the reservoir and the tailwater * Temperature load * Earthquake load Other miscellaneous loads that affect a dam include: ice and silt loads, and uplift pressure. The Idukki Dam in Kerala, India. Most often, the arch dam is made of concrete and placed in a \\"V\\"-shaped valley. The foundation or abutments for an arch dam must be very stable and proportionate to the concrete. There are two basic designs for an arch dam: constant-radius dams, which have constant radius of curvature, and variable-radius dams, which have both upstream and downstream curves that systematically decrease in radius below the crest. A dam that is double-curved in both its horizontal and vertical planes may be called a dome dam. Arch dams with more than one contiguous arch or plane are described as multiple-arch dams. Early examples include the Roman Esparragalejo Dam with later examples such as the Daniel- Johnson Dam (1968) and Itaipu Dam (1982). However, as a result of the failure of the Gleno Dam shortly after it was constructed in 1923, the construction of new multiple arch dams has become less popular. Contraction joints are normally placed every 20 m in the arch dam and are later filled with grout after the control cools and cures.  Types of Arch Dam  # Constant Radii Arch Dam # Variable Radii Arch Dam # Constant Angle Arch Dam * Constant Radii Arch Dam ‚Äì the upstream face of the dam has a constant radius making it a linear shape face throughout the height of the dam. But the inner curves their radius reduces as we move down from top elevation to bottom and thus in cross- section it makes a shape of the triangle. * Variable arch dam ‚Äì the radius of both inner and outer faces of the dam arch varies from bottom to top. The radius of the arch is greatest at the top and lowest at lower elevations. The central angle of the arch is also widened as we move upside. * Constant angle arch dam ‚Äì this is the most economical in construction. However, for the third type of arch dam stronger foundation is required as it involves overhangs at the abutment sections. The constant angle arch dam is that in which the central angles of the horizontal arch rings are of the same magnitude at all elevations.

It refers to the make up of a firm's capitalisation. It is the mix of different sources of long term funds such as equity shares , preference shares , long term debt , retained earnings etc. Overview A firm's capital structure is the composition or 'structure' of its liabilities. For example, a firm that has $20 billion in equity and $80 billion in debt is said to be 20% equity- financed and 80% debt-financed. The firm's ratio of debt to total financing, 80% in this example, is referred to as the firm's leverage.Fernandes, pN.. Finance for Executives: A Practical Guide for Managers. 2014; chapter 5. In reality, capital structure may be highly complex and include dozens of sources of capital. Leverage (or gearing) ratios represent the proportion of a firm's capital that is obtained through debt which may be either bank loans or bonds. In the event of bankruptcy, the seniority of the capital structure comes into play. A typical company has the following seniority structure listed from most senior to least: *Senior debt *Subordinated (or junior) debt *Preferred stock *Common stock The Modigliani‚ÄìMiller theorem, proposed by Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller in 1958, forms the basis for modern thinking on capital structure, though it is generally viewed as a purely theoretical result since it disregards many important factors in the capital structure process factors like fluctuations and uncertain situations that may occur in the course of financing a firm. The theorem states that, in a perfect market, how a firm is financed is irrelevant to its value. This result provides the base with which to examine real world reasons why capital structure is relevant, that is, a company's value is affected by the capital structure it employs. Some other reasons include bankruptcy costs, agency costs, taxes, and information asymmetry. This analysis can then be extended to look at whether there is in fact an optimal capital structure: the one which maximizes the value of the firm. Theory =Modigliani‚ÄìMiller theorem= Consider a perfect capital market (no transaction or bankruptcy costs; perfect information); firms and individuals can borrow at the same interest rate; no taxes; and investment returns are not affected by financial uncertainty. Assuming perfections in the capital is a mirage and unattainable as suggested by Modigliani and Miller. Modigliani and Miller made two findings under these conditions. Their first 'proposition' was that the value of a company is independent of its capital structure. Their second 'proposition' stated that the cost of equity for a leveraged firm is equal to the cost of equity for an unleveraged firm, plus an added premium for financial risk. That is, as leverage increases, risk is shifted between different investor classes, while the total firm risk is constant, and hence no extra value created. Their analysis was extended to include the effect of taxes and risky debt. Under a classical tax system, the tax-deductibility of interest makes debt financing valuable; that is, the cost of capital decreases as the proportion of debt in the capital structure increases. The optimal structure would be to have virtually no equity at all, i.e. a capital structure consisting of 99.99% debt. In the real world If capital structure is irrelevant in a perfect market, then imperfections which exist in the real world must be the cause of its relevance. The theories below try to address some of these imperfections, by relaxing assumptions made in the Modigliani‚ÄìMiller theorem. =Trade-off theory= Trade-off theory of capital structure allows bankruptcy cost to exist as an offset to the benefit of using debt as tax shield. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, namely, the tax benefits of debt and that there is a cost of financing with debt the bankruptcy costs and the financial distress costs of debt. This theory also refers to the idea that a company chooses how much equity finance and how much debt finance to use by considering both costs and benefits. The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing. Empirically, this theory may explain differences in debt-to-equity ratios between industries, but it doesn't explain differences within the same industry. =Pecking order theory= Pecking order theory tries to capture the costs of asymmetric information. It states that companies prioritize their sources of financing (from internal financing to equity) according to the law of least effort, or of least resistance, preferring to raise equity as a financing means \\"of last resort\\". Hence, internal financing is used first; when that is depleted, debt is issued; and when it is no longer sensible to issue any more debt, equity is issued. This theory maintains that businesses adhere to a hierarchy of financing sources and prefer internal financing when available, and debt is preferred over equity if external financing is required (equity would mean issuing shares which meant 'bringing external ownership' into the company). Thus, the form of debt a firm chooses can act as a signal of its need for external finance. The pecking order theory has been popularized by Myers (1984) when he argued that equity is a less preferred means to raise capital, because when managers (who are assumed to know better about true condition of the firm than investors) issue new equity, investors believe that managers think the firm is overvalued, and managers are taking advantage of the assumed over-valuation. As a result, investors may place a lower value to the new equity issuance. =Capital structure substitution theory= The capital structure substitution theory is based on the hypothesis that company management may manipulate capital structure such that earnings per share (EPS) are maximized. The model is not normative i.e. and does not state that management should maximize EPS, it simply hypothesizes they do. The 1982 SEC rule 10b-18 allowed public companies open-market repurchases of their own stock and made it easier to manipulate capital structure. This hypothesis leads to a larger number of testable predictions. First, it has been deducted that market average earnings yield will be in equilibrium with the market average interest rate on corporate bonds after corporate taxes, which is a reformulation of the 'Fed model'. The second prediction has been that companies with a high valuation ratio, or low earnings yield, will have little or no debt, whereas companies with low valuation ratios will be more leveraged. When companies have a dynamic debt-equity target, this explains why some companies use dividends and others do not. A fourth prediction has been that there is a negative relationship in the market between companies' relative price volatilities and their leverage. This contradicts Hamada who used the work of Modigliani and Miller to derive a positive relationship between these two variables. =Agency costs= Three types of agency costs can help explain the relevance of capital structure. * Asset substitution effect: As debt-to-equity ratio increases, management has an incentive to undertake risky, even negative Net present value (NPV) projects. This is because if the project is successful, share holders earn the benefit, whereas if it is unsuccessful, debtors experience the downside. * Underinvestment problem or debt overhang problem: If debt is risky e.g., in a growth company, the gain from the project will accrue to debt holders rather than shareholders. Thus, management have an incentive to reject positive NPV projects, even though they have the potential to increase firm value. * Free cash flow: unless free cash flow is given back to investors, management has an incentive to destroy firm value through empire building and perks etc. Increasing leverage imposes financial discipline on management. =Structural corporate finance= An active area of research in finance is that which tries to translate the models above as well as others into a structured theoretical setup that is time-consistent and that has a dynamic set up similar to one that can be observed in the real world. Managerial contracts, debt contracts, equity contracts, investment returns, all have long lived, multi-period implications. Therefore, it is hard to think through what the implications of the basic models above are for the real world if they are not embedded in a dynamic structure that approximates reality. A similar type of research is performed under the guise of credit risk research in which the modeling of the likelihood of default and its pricing is undertaken under different assumptions about investors and about the incentives of management, shareholders and debt holders. Examples of research in this area are Goldstein, Ju, Leland (1998) Goldstein, Ju, Leland, (1998) and Hennessy and Whited (2004).Hennessy and Whited (2004) = Capital structure and macroeconomic conditions = In addition to firm-specific characteristics, researchers find macroeconomic conditions have a material impact on capital structure choice. Korajczyk, Lucas, and McDonald (1990) provide evidence of equity issues cluster following a run-up in the equity market. Korajczyk and Levy (2003) find that target leverage is counter- cyclical for unconstrained firms, but pro-cyclical for firms that are constrained; macroeconomic conditions are significant for issue choice for firms that can time their issue choice to coincide with periods of favorable macroeconomic conditions, while constrained firms cannot. Levy and Hennessy (2007) highlight that trade-offs between agency problems and risk sharing vary over the business cycle and can result in the observed patterns. Others have related these patterns with asset pricing puzzles. =Other= * The neutral mutation hypothesis‚Äîfirms fall into various habits of financing, which do not impact on value. * Market timing hypothesis‚Äîcapital structure is the outcome of the historical cumulative timing of the market by managers. * Accelerated investment effect‚Äîeven in absence of agency costs, levered firms invest faster because of the existence of default risk.Lyandres, Evgeny and Zhdanov, Alexei,Investment Opportunities and Bankruptcy Prediction(February 2007) * In transition economies, there have been evidences reported unveiling significant impact of capital structure on firm performance, especially short-term debt such as the case of Vietnamese emerging market economy. Capital gearing ratio Capital gearing ratio = (Capital Bearing Risk) : (Capital not bearing risk) * Capital bearing risk includes debentures (risk is to pay interest) and preference capital (risk to pay dividend at fixed rate). * Capital not bearing risk includes equity shares capital. Therefore, one can also say, Capital gearing ratio = (Debentures + Preference share capital) : (shareholders' funds) Arbitrage A capital structure arbitrageur seeks to profit from differential pricing of various instruments issued by one corporation. Consider, for example, traditional bonds, and convertible bonds. The latter are bonds that are, under contracted-for conditions, convertible into shares of equity. The stock-option component of a convertible bond has a calculable value in itself. The value of the whole instrument should be the value of the traditional bonds plus the extra value of the option feature. If the spread (the difference between the convertible and the non-convertible bonds) grows excessively, then the capital-structure arbitrageur will bet that it will converge.

Guest dreamed of establishing a small boarding school in the country, and did so with the support and financial assistance of his father-in-law, Sir Byron Edmund Walker, a prominent Canadian businessman and patron of the arts. Today, Appleby is a co-educational day and boarding university-preparatory school, with a curriculum based around the liberal arts. It is situated on Lake Ontario in Oakville, Ontario, roughly 50 kilometres west of Toronto. Students are drawn primarily from Oakville, Burlington and Mississauga, but boarding students come from other parts of Canada and throughout all continents of the world. Appleby is the only Canadian member of the G30 Schools. It is also a member of the International Round Square Organisation and the Canadian Independent Schools Athletic Association. Appleby is accredited by the Canadian Educational Standards Institute. On October 13, 2006, Maclean's Magazine named Appleby one of Canada's Top 100 Employers. Appleby is the first high school ever to receive this distinction.  Pillars of Strength and academics  Appleby has identified six \\"Pillars of Strength\\" upon which to concentrate: Community Spirited, Technologically Empowered, Universally Diverse, Academically Vital, Globally Responsible, and Actively Engaged. Appleby students and faculty use technology in virtually every aspect of student life (currently Fujitsu Lifebook T4410 tablets and SMART Boards). Appleby was the second school in North America to fully utilize laptops and other technology in all areas of the school, after Cincinnati Country Day School. Each boarding room and classroom is equipped with internet ports and power outlets. A large portion of the assignments are done on the computer and subsequently emailed to the teacher. The academic program of Appleby College gears students towards writing AP examinations with a broad range of AP courses. Students at Appleby College generally take several AP courses in the Senior 1 and Senior 2 years. Currently, the AP courses offered at Appleby College include: AP Art History, AP Biology, AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, AP Chemistry, AP Computer Science, AP English Literature, AP French Language (AP French Literature was offered until the exam was discontinued in 2009), AP German, AP Human Geography, AP Macroeconomics, AP Music Theory, AP Physics B, AP Psychology, AP Statistics, AP United States History, and AP World History.  Boarding  As well as being a day school, boarding is offered from Grades 9 though 12 (7 and 8 can board but they live with faculty who live near campus) and there are numerous international students from over 20 countries attending Appleby. When the school first opened in 1911, boarding was mandatory. Over time as the Greater Toronto Area grew, Appleby became less of a \\"school in the country\\" as originally envisioned by John Guest, and more of a mixed day and boarding school in the suburbs. Less than half of students now board. However, in keeping with a tradition that has been maintained since 1911, all students in their \\"Senior Two\\" (Grade 12) year are required to go into residence. Approximately 240 students are currently in residence, the majority of whom are in Senior Two. There are four houses in which Appleby's boarding students reside, and with which the day students are affiliated: Baillie House; Walker House; Colley House; and Powell's House. Baillie House is a girls' residence and named after a prominent family that has attended and supported Appleby for several generations. Walker House was one of three boys' residences before co-education and is now a girls' residence, and is named for the school's original benefactor, Sir Byron Edmund Walker. Colley and Powell's are boys' residences and are named for former Appleby Masters. T.B. Colley taught at Appleby for 35 years and was housemaster of School House, which was renamed in his honour in 1949. Vernon Powell received the Military Cross and died during World War I.  Campus facilities  The school has spacious grounds with a main classroom building, dining hall, arena, five playing fields (one football size), five tennis courts, three squash courts, a gymnasium, a 20m swimming pool, four boarding houses and the Anglican John Bell Chapel, designed in the Westminster style. The chapel houses the first ever Inuit-designed stained glass window, created on commission by Kenojuak Ashevak, O.C. As well, the south boundary of the campus runs along the shores of Lake Ontario, and a creek runs through the west side of campus, bordered by playing fields and forest. A view of Appleby College's Creek Field at the southern end of the campus. Powell's House and Colley House can be seen in the distance and the Appleby College Forest is shown on the left Lake Ontario, visible from the campus of Appleby College Marker stone for Topher Point Topher Point, campus of Appleby College Benches at Appleby located behind the headmaster's residence Inukshuk on the campus of Appleby College Campus of Appleby College Creek passing through campus of Appleby College = Residences = There are four residences at Appleby: Walker, Baillie, Colley, and Powell's, each with its own distinct structure and style. Both Colley and Powell's house are boys' residences and are on the west side of campus while Walker and Baillie are girls' residences and are closer to the east side of the campus. Colley House is housed in the original Appleby School building (School House) which dates from 1911. Throughout the year each house is responsible for hosting charitable events as well as open houses, for other boarders to attend, and chapel weeks, for the entire school to attend. Each house has three designated faculty members who reside within it (Housemaster, Asst. Housemaster, and the Residential Don) as well as a house prefect and house executive committee composed of students that are responsible for keeping dialogue between faculty and students within the house open. Students are assigned affiliation with a boarding house in the third term of Middle Two (grade 8) or prior to entry into Upper One (grade 9). Students in Middle School are in the Nightingale house, which houses only Middle Twos and Ones. Membership of the houses can be distinguished by house ties, which depict the house colours and are worn by students as an optional substitute for the school tie. Each house is represented by an animal that is displayed prominently by a large mural in each of the residences. Baillie House is represented by a tiger and the color green, Colley House by a bulldog and the color red, Powell's House by a lion and the color yellow, and Walker House is represented by a grizzly bear and the color light blue. = Athletic facilities = In order to accommodate the various sports teams that Appleby offers the campus is equipped with four full size soccer/rugby fields, an astro-turf field for field hockey and lacrosse, full sized ice rink equipped with private dressing rooms for both varsity boys' and girls' teams with new stands, a fitness room, three squash courts, a climbing wall, a full size gym, one outdoor basketball courts, a beach volleyball court, a 50-yard swimming pool, as well as a fully equipped athletic therapy centre open to all students. With the new AWB Alumni Athletics centre built, Appleby now offers 3 more gyms, a new climbing wall, new yoga/meditation rooms, new squash courts, new spinning room, new weight room, and a new athletic therapy clinic. = Academic facilities = Due to the growth of the College, the Memorial Classroom Building is no longer the only area offering classroom space. There are four science labs located by the Appleby Arena and several more located on the science wing. Each of the houses, Walker being the exception, are also home to classrooms that are located on the basement level of the houses. All classrooms at Appleby are equipped with internet and power supply ports for students as well as a SMART Board. The Samuel Academic Resource Centre is home to the Williams IT Centre, the Raymond Massey Reading Room and the Appleby Archives. The SARC has collaborative spaces, small meeting rooms and comfy chairs. When not booked for meetings the Raymond Massey Reading Room is available for silent study and has Raymond Massey's personal library. = Chapel = The John Bell Chapel has been an important aspect of the Appleby community since its erection, and students attend chapel several times each week. Each Wednesday a student delivers a chapel speech, and other services are organized by Houses or other student groups. Rev. Craig Luccock is the current Chaplain and though an Anglican chapel, many other faiths' religious texts and teachings are incorporated in the spirit of inclusiveness and religious education. The Chapel serves as a gathering place for the Appleby College community, especially in times of great joy or great sorrow. The chapel features several stained glass windows including 'Iggalaaq' (2004) by Kenojuak Ashevak and Sue Obata. Window of John Bell Chapel, designed by late Canadian artist Kenojuak Ashevak (Appleby College, Oakville near Toronto; designed in 2004) Special events held in the Chapel include the Opening Service for the boarding community, the Carol Services for each grade, the Christmas Eve Service featuring an Alumni Choir, the Remembrance Day Service, the Ash Wednesday Service, and the Leaving Service on Closing Day. = Northern Campus = The McLaughlin Northern Campus, located at the school's private island, Rabbitnose, in Temagami, Ontario, hosts two sets of trips annually. In the winter months, January and February, Upper Two students take part in five-day winter survival trips that are based on the island. These trips are led by both Senior One and Two instructors and are overseen by faculty members. In the summer months, September and October, Upper One students take part in seven-day canoe trips that are also based on the island. An optional trip utilizing the campus's facilities is also offered the week following Closing Day.  Athletics  In addition to co-curricular activities and the Northward Bound program, each Appleby student is required to participate in the school's athletic program. Grade nines and tens (Upper Ones and Twos) must have three full terms of sport, and grade elevens and twelves (Senior Ones and Twos) must have two (the other term must be spent doing community service or engaging in a full-time arts activity). Interscholastic competition is offered in soccer, field hockey, swimming, basketball, hockey, tennis and rugby, among others. Ironically, two of the longest standing and formerly most prominent Appleby team sports are no longer offered. Cricket was played since the school opened, and was discontinued in 1992. There was a movement within the student body to re-instate cricket as an instructional sport in the 2004‚Äì2005 year. Football was also played since early in the school's history, and was discontinued in 2005. = Football = Appleby's greatest period of success in football was during the 1960s when the first team achieved a string of almost unbroken winning seasons. The best seasons were 1966 and 1967 when the team went undefeated in inter-scholastic play. The success of the 1967 team, in particular, who defeated not only Appleby's Old Boys in an exhibition game, but each of the first teams of the \\"Little Big Four\\" schools, Upper Canada College, St. Andrew's College, Ridley College and Trinity College School, led to Appleby joining the CISAA, where all of Appleby's different sports teams have competed since. David Smith coached the first football team from 1957 to 1980. He was himself a former Appleby student and taught English and coached football at Appleby for a total of 34 years, retiring as a teacher in 1991. Appleby's first football team achieved its next and last undefeated season in 1985, under the coaching of alumnus Dave Singer. This was the school's only CISAA championship for first-team football. The school had also fielded strong teams in the early 1980s when former CFL star Jeff Fairholm played. Beginning in the mid-1990s, the program's senior team, then coached by Jim Mackay, began contending for the Don Sutherin Gray Cup against Hillfield Strathallan College. Appleby and Hillfield would play on each school's homecoming weekend, with the overall winner being decided by total points for and against. The rivalry ended in 2002 when Hillfield discontinued their program. During the same period, the program's junior team experienced great success, which peaked in 2000 when Appleby finished in second place with a five wins and one loss record. The team made and hosted the championship game; however, the juniors lost to Ridley College 7 to 6. With the switch to a four-year high school program in 1987, Appleby struggled to field competitive football teams, eventually withdrawing from CISAA competition. In 2003, the senior team re-entered the CISAA conference, when all Ontario high schools switched to the four-year high school program. After the 2004 season, the school elected to end the program. = Ice hockey = Ice hockey has been played at Appleby since the school's inception, and is considered to be one of the most important core programs, if not the most important, offered at Appleby. Appleby currently fields four teams, three boys' and one girls'. In recent years Appleby had extremely strong competitive teams, winning gold at the aa/a boys' and girls' tournaments in 2011. = Rugby = Rugby union has been a prominent spring sport since the early 1970s, and continues to be popular for both boys and girls. The school's period of greatest success for rugby was under the coaching of former physics teacher Jim Washington, who coached the first rugby team from 1970 to 1989, achieving a winning record every season during that period. The years between 1973 and 1985 were particularly dominant, with the first team going undefeated almost every year and winning 11 out of 13 CISAA championships. More recently, the first boys' team won the 2005 Canadian Association of Independent Schools tournament held at Bishop's College School in Lennoxville Quebec. = Soccer = Soccer remains a popular sport for boys and girls, played in the fall for boys and spring for girls. The boys' first soccer team has also enjoyed considerable success in CISAA competition, winning consecutive CISAA championships in 1982 and 1983 under coach Colin Revill. Under the coaching of Tosh MacFarlane, Appleby again won the CISAA championship in 1986 and then three straight championships between 1990 and 1992. They also won the Championship in 1997 and again in 2013. = Squash = During the late 1970s, Appleby also won a number of championships for first team squash, coached by the late Ned Larsen, Appleby's fourth headmaster. In recent history, the varsity squash program has regained much of its former prominence winning team championships as well as an individual distinction for players. = Swimming = Appleby enjoyed tremendous success in swimming in the 1970s winning four out of a possible five CISAA first team championships between 1976 and 1980 under coach and longtime Appleby geography teacher John Berriman. The swim team was also extremely successful more recently winning the CISAA co-ed championships each year between 1997 and 2000, as well as 2004‚Äì2007, under coach Sheila Kuyper and Brooke Millman. It is considered one of the main core sports at Appleby. The team travelled during the 2008-2009 season to Costa Rica for a training camp. The Appleby swim team is the most successful team on campus with six consecutive CISAA championships over the past six years. No other team has done this at Appleby. = Rivalries = Though officially no rivalries exist between Appleby College and other schools, Ridley College in St. Catharines, Ontario is often viewed as a potent rival of the Blue Dogs. The Ridley Tigers are viewed as among the top teams in CISAA Athletics, and thus matches against this rival are met with heightened intensity. Boys' athletic teams at Appleby tend to have stronger rivalries with schools stemming from Appleby's history as an all-boys school. Upper Canada College in Toronto, Trinity College School in Port Hope, and St. Andrew's College in Aurora are deemed as important rivals of the Blue Dogs in boys' competition.  Arts  In addition to both athletic and Northern Campus commitments, Appleby College students are expected to pursue interests in the arts. Several options are available to students in this regard, as many students have artistic interests that go beyond the conventional arts of visual, vocal, and dance. Arts co-curriculars are varying and many hold a deep rooting in Appleby's storied history. One such co-curricular is the Appleby College Model United Nations club, having participated for many years in various local and international competitions, in recent years the school has gained international recognition for the success of their programme. In 2007 a small delegation from Appleby attended the Lake Erie International Model United Nations Conference (LEIMUN) and were awarded the top prize for small delegations in attendance with six of the seven student delegates receiving awards of distinction in their councils. Appleby College students have also found much success on the university Model United Nations circuit with several students winning awards of distinction at the 2007 York University Model United Nations Conference (YMUN). Appleby students also annually attend the North American Invitational Model United Nations (NAIMUN), the Students' League of Nations (SLN) in Geneva, Switzerland, the Stanford University Model United Nations (SMUN), Harvard University Model United Nations, Secondary School United Nations Symposium (SSUNS), and the UNAUSA Model United Nations Conference in New York. Many Appleby students have been recognized for distinction at these conferences. Since 2005, Appleby College has hosted its own Model United Nations conference each year in April, the Appleby College Model United Nations (ACMUN). Over 400 students attend the conference from around the GTA. The conference is organized annually under student leadership and is headed by the elected ACMUN Secretary General. Further to the success of the Model United Nations program, the debating team of Appleby College has also been noted for its wide-ranging success with several debaters ranked provincially, nationally and internationally. In some aspects of the College, debating is mandatory either as part of a course (particularly in Upper 1, and Senior 1) and as an evaluation tool and competition (S1 Joan Schoeffel Debating Competition); however, debating is purely optional at the inter- scholastic level. Appleby students have consistently placed high in local, national and international debating competitions. An Appleby student won the Canadian National Debating Championships for the first time in 1985 (Michael Raynor '86, Harvard '90, Ivey '94, HBS '00). In 2008, an Appleby student came second in the World Debating Championship (Sulaiman Hakemy '08, now at London School of Economics). In 2009, an Appleby student came first in the parliamentary debating component of the Canadian National Debating Championships (Kosaluchi Mmegwa '10, then Princeton University). In 2010, Appleby students took the 1st and 5th places in all of Ontario in the Qualifiers for the national championships to take place in February. Another avenue students are welcome to pursue their interest in the Arts is through Musicals and multiple choirs. Those students in grades 7 and 8 have the opportunity to participate in a musical that is held on property every spring. Students in grades 9-12 are welcomed to the Oakville Center for Performing Arts where they put together a Musical and present to the school and surrounding community. Appleby also boasts a chapel choir made up of students from all years and all skill sets. They perform regularly in chapel, in Christmas Carol Services, and participate in choral competitions. In addition, the auditioned Cantus choir (for students in grades 9-12) performs regularly and has toured in North America and beyond.  History  *Originally called Appleby School when it opened in 1911 (the school had 29 students), it was renamed Appleby College in 1941. 1912 School Prefects An Appleby School crest c. 1915. *The first Argus (the school yearbook) was published in 1916. *The school chapel was completed after seven years of construction, and dedicated in November 1929. *Ferdinand Herbert Marani (architect) of Marani & Paisley designed several buildings on campus including: the gymnasium, swimming pool, administration building, and classroom building (1948‚Äì49) *In 1956 the memorial entrance to the classroom building was completed, in commemoration of the Appleby boys and master who had been killed in World War I and World War II. *Appleby marked its 50th anniversary in 1961 with a significant building expansion. A dining hall was built and named after John Guest, the founder and first headmaster. A third boarding residence, \\"New House\\" was opened, later renamed Walker House after the school's original benefactor. *In 1968 the school chapel, formerly the Memorial Chapel, was expanded to its present size and renamed the John Bell Chapel in honour of the third headmaster, who retired that year. The first Appleby Quarterly, Appleby's alumni newsletter, was also published this year. *In 1970 the swimming pool and J.S. Gairdner hockey arena were opened. Previously Appleby hockey was played at the Oakville Arena. *In 1971 with enrollment rising, Appleby was split into a Junior and Senior School. Junior School consisted of grades 4 through 8. Previously the school had admitted boys as young as grade 1. Senior School consisted of grades 9 through 13. *In 1973, Appleby introduced the innovative Northward Bound outdoor education program at the school's \\"Northern Campus\\" on Rabbitnose Island, Lake Temagami. *In 1976, participation in the Senior School Cadet Corps became optional for students in grades 11 through 13. In 1984, it became a completely voluntary corps. Appleby maintained #440 Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps for 93 years, until 2008, and it was open to both boys and girls. *In 1979, the school cook, Hilda Chattaway, reached a remarkable milestone of 50 years of continuous service to Appleby. She continued to run the school's kitchen until her death in 1985. In 1982 the Junior School boarding dormitory located on the top floor of Colley House was named after her. However, boarding for the Junior grades was discontinued in 1990. *September 1980 marked the first time day students outnumbered boarders *Appleby commemorated its 75th anniversary during the 1985‚Äì1986 school year. Memorable events from that year included the first football team's undefeated season and first and only CISAA championship, and the visit of Lady Mountbatten to officially open the new wing to the classroom building. The new facility was called Nicholas Court and housed facilities for art, music and debating, in addition to new classrooms. *Appleby was one of the first high schools in Ontario to eliminate Grade 13, moving to a four-year program with a \\"double cohort\\" graduating class in 1987. All high schools in Ontario moved from a five-year to a four-year program . *In 1990, Saturday classes were eliminated. Previously, a chapel service and classes were held on Saturday mornings and sports were played in the afternoon. Up until the 1970s, boarders had also attended a Sunday church service at St. Jude's Anglican Church in Oakville. *Prior to becoming co-educational in 1991, Appleby was a school for boys only. Girls were admitted in grades 6 to 11. Before then, Appleby's sister school was St. Mildred's-Lightbourn School, an Oakville private school for girls. Appleby and St. Mildred's often collaborated in drama, for example. *At the same time that girls were admitted, grades 4 through 6 were phased out and the Junior School/ Senior School division was eliminated. Michael Nightingale was the Director of the Junior School for all twenty years that it was in existence. *In 1993 Appleby saw its first co-educational graduating class. By that fall, the school had taken on its present character of a completely co-educational school for students in grades 7 through 12. A fourth boarding residence, Baillie House, was also built for female students.

He served as an artillery officer in the Great War with the 15th and 13th Batteries, Canadian Field Artillery, and commanded the 53rd Battery, CFA. He received the Military Cross for gallantry under fire. Major Powell died of his wounds in London in early January 1918. Robert Snowden taught English at Appleby from 1975 to 1985, and is now Headmaster of St. Michaels University School in Victoria, British Columbia. He taught at Ridley College after leaving Appleby, and served as Dean of Students of that school as well. He is an Appleby alumnus, and was the Head Prefect during the 1969‚Äì1970 school year. David Howie taught History at Appleby in the 1980s and 1990s, and was formerly President of Athol Murray College of Notre Dame in Saskatchewan and Head of School of St. John's Ravenscourt School in Winnipeg. Christopher Shannon, another History teacher of the same time, is Headmaster of Lower Canada College in Montreal. Catherine Raaflaub, former Appleby Assistant Headmaster (School & Community Relations), became Headmaster of Strathcona Tweedsmuir School near Calgary, Alberta, between 2004 and 2006, but then returned to Appleby to assume the role of Assistant Headmaster (School & Community Relations) and Director, Advancement.

Overview Madsen Pirie defines the term \\"false precision\\" in a more general way: when exact numbers are used for notions that cannot be expressed in exact terms. For example, \\"We know that 90% of the difficulty in writing is getting started.\\" Often false precision is abused to produce an unwarranted confidence in the claim: \\"our mouthwash is twice as good as our competitor's\\". In science and engineering, convention dictates that unless a margin of error is explicitly stated, the number of significant figures used in the presentation of data should be limited to what is warranted by the precision of those data. For example, if an instrument can be read to tenths of a unit of measurement, results of calculations using data obtained from that instrument can only be confidently stated to the tenths place, regardless of what the raw calculation returns or whether other data used in the calculation are more accurate. Even outside these disciplines, there is a tendency to assume that all the non-zero digits of a number are meaningful; thus, providing excessive figures may lead the viewer to expect better precision than exists. However, in contrast, it is good practice to retain more significant figures than this in the intermediate stages of a calculation, in order to avoid accumulated rounding errors. False precision commonly arises when high-precision and low-precision data are combined, and in conversion of units.  Examples  False precision is the gist of numerous variations of a joke which can be summarized as follows: A tour guide at a museum says a dinosaur skeleton is 100,000,005 years old, because an expert told him that it was 100 million years old when he started working there 5 years ago. If a car's speedometer indicates the vehicle is travelling at 60 mph and that is converted to km/h, it would equal 96.5606 km/h. The conversion from the whole number in one system to the precise result in another makes it seem like the measurement was very precise, when in fact it was not. Measures that rely on statistical sampling, such as IQ tests, are often reported with false precision. Chapter 4.

The Huron Institute owed its existence to the extensive revivals of religion in the churches of Huron Presbytery in the years 1830 and 1831. The Institute was incorporated by act of the Ohio General Assembly in 1832. With the local people being eager for the school to open, the first term was begun in April 1832 several months before the school building was completed in December 1832. Construction costs were $4,000, with $2,000 being raised by the Huron Presbytery and the balance being raised by the village of Milan. Reverend Elded Barber was the first Principal and the purpose of the school as stated in the Board of Trustees minutes was to provide \\"instruction to youth of both sexes in the higher branches of English education, the learned languages and the liberal arts and sciences.\\" It was the desire of the trustees of the institute to place education within the reach of all who would avail themselves of it, and in this they succeeded as nearly as was possible. The tuition was fixed at four dollars per quarter in the classical department, and at three dollars in the English and female department, and the principal took it upon himself to furnish instruction from the avails of the tuition bills. Board was furnished by many of the best families in Milan at merely nominal rates. No student was ever refused admission or dismissed because too poor to pay his way in the institute. At the time it was established, it was the only school on the Western Reserve west of Hudson where young men could be prepared for college. The Huron Institute closed in 1857 and re-opened as the Western Reserve Normal School in the next year. The Normal School continued to operate until 1889 when it closed. The building remained standing until 1910 when it was razed. Notable alumni *Omar D. Conger, U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator from Michigan *Moses K.

During his life, he tried to reconcile revolutionary Marxism and Catholicism. Camilo Torres (center, looking sideways) marching with students As part of the academic staff of the National University of Colombia, he was a co-founder of the Sociology Faculty together with Orlando Fals Borda in 1960. His involvement in several student and political movements during the time won him an large following as well as many detractors, especially from the Colombian government and the church itself. Due to the growing pressure to back down from his radical politics, Camilo Torres saw himself persecuted and went into hiding (leaving his job as an academic) by joining the guerrillas in Colombia. He served as a low- ranking member of the ELN to whom he also provided spiritual assistance and inspiration from a Marxist-Christian point of view. He was killed in his first combat experience, when the ELN ambushed a Colombian Military patrol.SDS Regional Newsletter, Mar. 8, 1966, Vol. 1, no. 8 Winter 1966 MFU Catalog After his death, Camilo Torres was made an official martyr of the ELN.

From approximately 1610 to 1635, during the reign of Louis XIII, this was the predominant form of secular vocal composition in France, especially in the royal court. Features The first use of the term air de cour was in Adrian Le Roy's Airs de cour miz sur le luth (Book on Court Tunes for the Luth),Robin, et all, 2007, p. 82 a collection of music published in 1571. The earliest examples of the form are for solo voice accompanied by lute;Buelow, 2004, p. 156 towards the end of the 16th century, four or five voices are common, sometimes accompanied (or instrumental accompaniment may have been optional); and by the mid-17th century, most airs de cour were again for solo voice with accompaniment. Beginning in 1608, airs de cour were often taken from ballets de cour, a form of ballet which was quickly becoming popular at the French court. Musically they were strophic, i.e. successive verses of the text were set with similar music. While the earlier music, especially that for multiple voices, was polyphonic, after about 1610 the music usually was homophonic, sung syllabically and without meter, with a clear influence from the musique mesur√©e which developed in Paris around 1570. Collections exist which deviate considerably from these trends, however; several printers specialized in polyphonic airs de cour throughout the early 17th century, and there are eight volumes published by Le Roy & Ballard which are monophonic ‚Äì for a single voice with no accompaniment. Airs de cour show surprisingly little influence from the Italian early Baroque trends of monody and the madrigal, either in its polyphonic or its concertato form. This is all the more surprising as Italian musicians often worked in France, and the polyphonic and concertato forms of madrigal were being deeply influential in Germany at the same time. Emotional expression in the airs de cour, compared to that of the contemporary Italian madrigalists, is cool, classical and reserved, in keeping with contemporary French taste. Vocal range of the music is usually limited to one octave; dissonance and chromaticism are rare; and the overall simplicity of expression is striking. The influence of the air de cour extended beyond France. Collections were published in Germany, and more importantly in England, where translations were rather popular, as attested by the several publications and copies. There exists a delightfully titled publication: French Court-airs, with their Ditties Englished, (Edward Filmer, 1629), The air de cour had considerable influence on the development of the English ayre. The atmosphere of these songs is very different from the English lute song, and the lute technique employs some novel features. There are notated strummings with the 1st finger, both up and down. There have been several articles on the finer points of this, as well as the exact meaning of the notation, in the English and French Lute Society Journals. Composers Composers of airs de cour included: * Adrian Le Roy (c.1520 - 1598) * Nicolas de La Grotte (1530 - c.1600) * Charles Tessier (ca.1550 - after 1604) * Jacques Mauduit (1557 - 1627) * Pierre Gu√©dron (c.1570 - c.1620) * Fran√ßois Richard (c.1585-1650) * Antoine Bo√´sset (1586 - 1643) * √âtienne Moulini√© (c.1600 - c.1669) * Jean de Cambefort (c.1605 - 1661) * Jacques de Gouy (c.1610‚Äìafter 1650) * B√©nigne de Bacilly (c.1625-1690) * Joseph Chabanceau de La Barre (1633-1678) * Gabriel Bataille (c.1575 - 1630) * Michel L'Affilard (c.1656-1708) * Jean-Baptiste Drouard de Bousset (1662-1725) Media  Discography  * Etienne Moulinie: Airs with lute tablature First Book (Musica Viva B000003XT6) * Etienne Moulini√©, Airs de Cour (L'empreinte digitale, ed 13010) * Airs de Cour, La dispute des bergers/La pierre philosophale Les Arts Florissants/William Christie (Erato 3984-25485-2) * Airs de Cour Orinda: French renaissance songs, featuring Jennifer Lane can be listened to online (free and legally!) at this site * Antoine Boesset: Air Qui Produit Tant Des Choses : Boesset by Monique Zanetti, Ensemble A Deux Violes Esgales * Amour Cruel: airs by Michel Lambert et Sebastien Le Camus / Suzie LeBlanc, Stephen Stubbs, Les Voix Humaines (ATMA ACD2 2216) * C≈ìur, airs de cour fran√ßais de la fin du XVIe si√®cle, Vincent Dumestre, Le Po√®me Harmonique, (Alpha 213) Footnotes References and further reading * John H.

Early life and career He Zizhen with Mao Zedong He Zizhen was born in Yunshan (‰∫ëÂ±±, now Yongxin County), Jiangxi, during the Qing dynasty and joined the Communist Youth League of China in 1925. She graduated from the Yongxin Girls' School and joined the Communist Party of China in 1926. Revolutionary life He Zizhen was introduced to Mao Zedong at Jinggangshan by Yuan Wencai, a classmate of her elder brother, in the spring of 1928. An expert in guerrilla warfare and a capable fighter, He Zizhen was also an excellent shooter who earned the nickname of \\"Two-Gunned Girl General.\\"Karl, 37 - 38 When they married, Mao had not divorced his second wife Yang Kaihui, whom he had wed in 1920. Yang was arrested and executed in 1930 by the Kuomintang . He Zizhen had three daughters and three sons with Mao Zedong, but except for their daughter, Li Min, all of them either died young or were separated from the family. Their eldest daughter, who was left to a local family in Fujian, was found and recognized by He Zizhen's brother in 1973, but never had the chance to meet Mao or He. Two English researchers who retraced the entire Long March in 2002‚Äì2003 located a woman whom they believe might be a missing child left in the care of others by Mao and He in 1935. In 1937, He Zizhen traveled to the Soviet Union to treat a wound sustained earlier in battle, later attending the Moscow East University. While He Zizhen was in Russia, Mao met and married his fourth wife, Jiang Qing. Upon her return to China in 1947, she found she could not hope to fulfill any sort of political role in Beijing. She later became the chair of Zhejiang Province Women's Union. In 1984, He Zizhen died alone in Shanghai.A Tribute to He Zizhen, Abandoned Wife of Mao Zedong by Wen Hua in 'The Epoch Times' http://www.theepochtimes.com/news/6-9-12/45882.html Legacy In 2007, a memorial hall was opened in Yongxin for He Zizhen with her daughter, Li Min, present as a guest.

She is best known for her 1985 hit duet with Phil Collins, \\"Separate Lives\\", her only Number 1. Early life Marilyn Martin was born on May 4, 1954, in Tennessee but raised in Louisville, Kentucky. She was exposed to different genres of music as a child. Her father was a country and bluegrass fan, her mother liked R&B; and her grandmother sang gospel. At age 18 she started singing with different bands, eventually joining one from Akron, Ohio. After five years of gigs in clubs, they had an opportunity to tour with Joe Walsh, who was headlining with Stevie Nicks. Also on the tour were Michael McDonald, Boz Scaggs, and Kenny Loggins. After this tour, Martin moved to Los Angeles, California, and gained a prolific career as a backing vocalist for artists including Stevie Nicks, Joe Walsh, Don Henley, Tom Petty and Kenny Loggins. Career Martin became a protegee of Doug Morris, the then-head of Atlantic, who had heard her backing vocals on Nicks' album Rock a Little and was impressed enough to ask for a demo. She recorded the Nicks song \\"Sorcerer\\" (on which Nicks features on backing vocals) for the Jim Steinman soundtrack of the 1984 film Streets of Fire. Morris signed Martin to a two album recording contract and connected her with Phil Collins for \\"Separate Lives,\\" part of the soundtrack for the 1985 film White Nights. The song was a number one hit in the U.S. and a Top 5 hit in the United Kingdom. Martin's self-titled debut album was released in January 1986, reaching number 72 on the Billboard 200, with the single \\"Night Moves\\" reaching number 28 on the Billboard Hot 100. Two other singles were also released from the album, \\"Body and the Beat\\" and \\"Move Closer,\\" but neither made the charts. Her second album, This is Serious, was released in 1988, with its lead single \\"Possessive Love\\" written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard. A second single, \\"Love Takes No Prisoners,\\" was released as well, with the haunting ballad \\"Quiet Desperation\\" as the B-side. The same year, Martin also recorded a duet with David Foster, \\"And When She Danced,\\" which was used as the \\"love theme\\" for the film Stealing Home. Neither the singles nor the album were commercially successful, and Atlantic dropped her. She continued her career as a backing vocalist into the 1990s. In 1993, Martin moved to Nashville where she recorded a country album, Through His Eyes, for Atlantic in 1994. The album was never released, but is available through Martin's official Website. In 1997 Martin recorded a duet \\"I Live for Love\\" with David Hasselhoff, which appears on his album Hooked on a Feeling. On September 14, 2012, Martin released a new album, Trust, Love, Pray, a Christian music album featuring songs written by Martin, including \\"Every Way and Always\\" which received a lot of airplay on Christian and Praise and Worship stations. Marilyn reunited with Stevie Nicks in October 2016, singing backup vocals for the 24 Karat Gold Tour and filling in for Lori Nicks, who decided to spend time with her daughter. She continued working with Stevie, touring as a backing vocalist with Fleetwood Mac in 2019.Introduced by Mick Fleetwood at the Toyota Center in Houston February 5, 2019 Personal life Martin currently has a day job as a real estate agent in Nashville where she lives with her husband (guitarist, music producer, and engineer) Greg Droman.

The term is usually capitalized to distinguish it from the use of \\"flora\\" to mean the plants rather than their descriptions. Some classic and modern Floras are listed below. Traditionally Floras are books, but some are now published on CD-ROM or websites. The area that a Flora covers can be either geographically or politically defined. Floras usually require some specialist botanical knowledge to use with any effectiveness. A Flora often contains diagnostic keys. Often these are dichotomous keys, which require the user to repeatedly examine a plant, and decide which one of two alternatives given in the Flora best applies to the plant. Floras produced at a local or regional level rarely contain identification keys. Instead they aim to impart more detailed understanding of the local status and distribution of that area's plants. Maps showing species distribution may be included, and nowadays are computer- generated from biological databases. Specific reference may be made to new arrivals and historic records in order to impart understanding of the changes in an area's vegetation over time.

Not all masters carry the honorary title; it must be either officially bestowed by royalty (similar to a knighthood) or unofficially by commonfolk. The latter is most common today, especially outside Southeast Asia. In modern usage, the title is often adopted by the founder of a new style and is used much like the term grandmaster. Etymology A theory says that it is a compound of the Indonesian words pandai, meaning clever or skilled, and akar meaning root. It may be related to the Kawi terms upakara which means teacher, and kekarepan which means ethos or ambition. A variant of pendekar is the word pakar which can mean any kind of expert. Attributes of a pendekar A genuine silat guru must have mastered every aspect of the art. These are the forms and techniques, their combat application, internal methods and traditional medicine. Therefore, a pendekar must be more than merely an instructor or expert, she/he must be a fighter, a traditional doctor, and a receptacle of their discipline's culture and wisdom. The emphasis given to each of these varies from one style to another. Some systems are more sport-oriented while others focus on spiritual development. Traditional masters, however, only consider a style to be \\"true silat\\" if it can be used in battle. Every movement is deliberate and has its function in a fight. Meditation and internal training serves as a counterbalance for a warrior's martial skills. In northern Malaysia and southern Thailand, this balance is symbolised by the concept of jantan betina (male-female), equivalent to the Chinese yin and yang. In Indo-Malay folklore, esoteric knowledge is only gained by fasting and then meditating under a tree. Silat practitioners of the past would meditate and fast at length, often in such locations as caves, jungles and even graveyards so they would not fear death. With this mentality, a pendekar is always prepared for combat, whether they are unarmed or outnumbered. This is encapsulated in the Malay saying \\"From the tips of the hair to the tips of the toes\\" (Dari hujung rambut ke hujung kaki) meaning that all are potential weapons to be used at the right moment. Purportedly, a pendekar of the highest skill needs no weapon aside from their mind to subdue the opponent. By focusing their energy, masters were said to be able to attack an opponent without physically touching them, strike a vital point from afar, or stop someone's heart without them noticing they've been hurt. Silat folklore is replete with tales of fighters possessing such skills as the ability to run very rapidly, vanish in a puff of smoke and reappear, change form, dash across the surface of water, turn invisible, or leap to the roof of a house. Finally, a pendekar must be familiar with traditional healing methods. Massage is commonly taught alongside silat because of its relation to sentuhan or the art of striking pressure points. Sentuhan could also be applied to other aspects of healing such as stopping a wound from bleeding or stimulating energy flow. Some masters might also have knowledge of herbalism or bone-setting. It was once considered necessary for anyone teaching silat to be able to nurse injured students back to health.

Due√±o took music classes with \\"Maestro\\" Aruti, with whom he learned about composition and harmony.

When Due√±o was a young man he would be hired to play the flute in many of these orchestras.Braulio Due√±o Col√≥nPopular Culture Musical career In 1879, he composed the music for the zarzuela \\"Los Ba√±os de Coamo\\" (\\"The Baths of Coamo\\") which was originally written by Genaro de Arazamendi, in honor of the hot springs in the town by the same name. Due√±o participated in many literary-musical contests in the Ateneo Puertorrique√±o. He won many prizes and honors for his compositions. Among the pieces honored were: * La Amistad (Friendship, an overture), 1877; * Sinfon√≠a Dram√°tica (Dramatic Symphony); * Noche de Oto√±o (An Autumn Night), 1887; * Estudio sobre la Danza Puertorrique√±a (A Study of the Puerto Rican Danza), 1914. However, it was the series of Canciones Escolares (School Songs, 1912), which were co-written with Virgilio D√°vila and Manuel Fern√°ndez Juncos, that would give him lasting recognition as one of Puerto Rico's greatest composers. The Canciones Escolares not only won the highest honors in the Ateneo but was also acclaimed and honored at the Pan-American Exposition of 1901. The Canciones Escolares became an important part of Puerto Rican culture. Later years Braulio Due√±o Col√≥n lived most of his life in the city of Bayam√≥n, where he died on April 4, 1934.

Until recently, there were 7 known species to exist within the genus Nashia.Marx, H. E., et al. (2010). A molecular phylogeny and classification of Verbenaceae. American Journal of Botany 97(10), 1647-63. However, the seven species placed in the genus Nashia were revised, based on the near totality of the (scant) material found in the world's herbaria. A morphological analysis of, in particular, the calyx and fruit reveals the heterogeneity of the genus. As a result, Nashia was reduced to its single original species, N. inaquensis, described from Great Inagua, Bahamas (where it's considered to have been introduced), and recently found in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands (St. Croix). N. Spinifera, of Hispaniola, was placed in the genus Isidroa, a monotypic new genus. The five Cuban endemics, plus two newly described here, make up the new genus Diphyllocalyx, formerly Lippia sect.

The prominent 14,271-foot (4,350 m) fourteener is located southwest by south (bearing 214¬∞) of Idaho Springs in Clear Creek County, Colorado, United States, on the drainage divide between Arapaho National Forest and Pike National Forest. The peak is one of the characteristic Front Range peaks, dominating the western skyline of the Great Plains along with Pikes Peak, Longs Peak, and nearby Mount Bierstadt. Mount Evans can be seen from over to the east, and many miles in other directions. Mount Evans dominates the Denver metropolitan area skyline, rising over above the area. Mount Evans can be seen from points south of Castle Rock, up to ( south) and as far north as Fort Collins ( north), and from areas near Limon ( east). In the early days of Colorado tourism, Mount Evans and Denver were often in competition with Pikes Peak and Colorado Springs. Mount Evans, along with Echo Lake, was designated as a historic site by the American Physical Society in 2017, commemorating the many cosmic-ray physics experiments conducted on the mountain between 1935 and 1960.Mount Evans and Echo Lake, Colorado, part of the APS Historic Sites Initiative; accessed Oct, 2019.  Geography  Mount Evans is the highest peak in a massif. The peak is west of Denver, \\"as the crow flies\\", and approximately by road, via Idaho Springs. Other peaks in the massif are: * Mount Spalding (), northwest * Gray Wolf Mountain (), north-northwest * The Sawtooth (), west * Mount Bierstadt (), west-southwest * Mount Warren (), north-northeast * Rogers Peak (), northeast. At least 7 deep glacial cirques cut into the massif. The cirques around Mount Evans are the deepest cirques in the Colorado Rockies. The bottoms of many of these contain tarns, the most notable being: * Summit Lake at the head of Bear Creek, 0.5 miles north * the Chicago Lakes at the head of Chicago Creek, 2 miles north * Abyss Lake at the head of Lake Fork, 1 mile west-southwest The Mount Evans Scenic Byway consists of State Highway 103 from Idaho Springs, Colorado on I-70 about to Echo Lake, and Colorado 5 from Echo Lake , ending at a parking area and turnaround just below the summit. The latter has long been the highest paved road in North America (5th highest in the world) and is only open in the summer. Colorado 103 continues east from Echo Lake to Squaw Pass, from which it connects, via Clear Creek County Road 103 and Jefferson County Road 66, to Bergen Park from which Colorado 74 leads to Evergreen Colorado. The Guanella Pass Scenic Byway passes within west of Mount Evans, linking Georgetown and I-70 with Grant and US 285, to the south. A marked hiking trail roughly parallels the highway from Echo Lake to the summit, and a second marked trail links Guanella Pass to Mount Bierstadt. A difficult side route of the latter climbs to the northeastern peak of The Sawtooth, from which an easy ridge leads to the summit of Mount Evans. Most of the Mount Evans massif is now part of the Mount Evans Wilderness area in Arapaho National Forest and Pike National Forest. The exception is a narrow corridor along the highway from Echo Lake that is excluded from the wilderness. Summit Lake Park and Echo Lake Park, are part of the historic Denver Mountain Parks system.  History  Looking west along ridge from summit Mount Evans was originally known as Mount Rosa or Mount Rosalie. Albert Bierstadt named it for the wife of Fitz Hugh Ludlow, whom he later married. The name is also a reference to Monte Rosa, the highest peak in Switzerland. Bierstadt and his guide, William Newton Byers, approached the mountain along Chicago Creek from Idaho Springs in 1863, and spent several days painting sketches of the mountain from the Chicago Lakes before climbing to Summit Lake and onward to the summit. Bierstadt's sketch, Mountain Lake, accurately portrays the view of Mount Spalding over the Chicago Lakes.Albert Bierstadt, Mountain Lake , 13 by 19 inch oil on paper, no date. His painting, A Storm in the Rocky Mountains, Mt. Rosalie, is based on that and other sketches.Albert Bierstadt A Storm in the Rocky Mountains , 1866, in the American Art collection of the Brooklyn Museum. A second claim to be the first to ascend is attributed to Judge Lunt and a friend in 1872. William Henry Jackson, attached to the Hayden Survey, visited the Chicago Lakes in 1873, where he took numerous photographs; the summit of Mount Evans is barely visible in several of these, peeking over the col between upper Chicago Lake and Summit Lake.William Henry Jackson, Chicago Lakes, Mount Rosalie, ID. Jackson, W.H. 1435 , ID. Jackson, W.H. 1436 ID. Jackson, W.H. 1437 U.S. Geological Survey Photographic Library , 1873. The Hayden survey reported that Mount Rosalie was 14,330 feet above sea level, measured by triangulation.W. H. Jackson, F. V. Hayden, 1873 Series, Descriptive Catalog of the Photographs of the United States Geological Survey of the Territories for the years 1869 to 1875, Inclusive, Second Ed., Washington, 1875; page 63.H. Gannett, F. V. Hayden, Lists of Elevations principally in That Portion of the United States West of the Mississippi River, Fourth Ed., Washington, 1877; page 125. In 1895, 30 years after he was forced to resign as governor because of his part in the infamous Sand Creek Massacre and its subsequent cover-up, Colorado's legislature officially renamed the peak in honor of John Evans, second governor of the Colorado Territory from 1862 to 1865.Federal Writers' Project, Tour 15A, Colorado -- A Guide to the Highest State, Hastings House, New York, 1941; page 403. The history of the Mount Evans Scenic Byway is part of a larger story of the Denver Mountain Parks system. It ultimately began when the City and County of Denver initiated the construction of a series of automobile \\"scenic loops\\" to allow Denverites to explore the mountains. One road circuit, Circle G, was to traverse the ridge to Squaw Pass on to Echo Lake, culminate in a climb up Mt. Evans, and loop down to Idaho Springs. In order to achieve this goal, Denver Mountain Parks acquired a series of land parcels, including the acquisition of Bergen Park in 1915. The Bear Creek segment from the Genesee saddle to Bergen Park was finished in 1915, while the Denver Mountain Parks committee worked to make Mt. Evans a National Park, going as far as getting support in Congress for the construction of a \\"cement road\\" to the mountain. The first mile was paid for by Denver with the understanding that the State Highway Commission would do the rest.Downing, William M. 1931 How Denver Acquired Her Celebrated Mountain Parks, a Condensed History of the Building of America's Most Unique Park System. In Municipal Facts. Volume 13, numbers 3‚Äì4 March‚ÄìApril. The Denver Mountain Parks committee was not without disagreement and setbacks, however. $30,000 was acquired early in 1916 to construct the Bergen Park to Squaw Pass segment and all seemed to be flowing towards the goal of Mount Evans when the mayor of Denver, Robert W. Speer, appointed W.F.R. Mills as the Commissioner of Improvements, who summarily stopped the construction of the road, stating that \\"It is a road that starts nowhere, ends nowhere, and never gets there\\". After studying the issue, Mills later recanted and became a supporter of the park system, and the segment between Bergen Park and Squaw Pass was constructed beginning in the spring of 1918. The next act was to get Mount Evans classified as a National Park, but 1916 was a tumultuous time between the National Park system and the U.S. Forest Service, who currently held claim to the mountain. Already in bitter struggle to prevent the formation of a National Park Service, Chief Forester Graves adamantly blocked the relinquishment of this area of National Forest, in exchange for Forest Service development of the area including the immediate construction of a road between Squaw Pass and Echo Lake (Colorado). This joint exercise between the City and County of Denver, the U.S. Congress, the State Highway System, and now the Forest Service would be completed with help of a newly formed Federal Agency, the Bureau of Public Roads. In 1918, the Bureau of Public Roads provided the plan to construct 9.41 miles of road from Soda Pass (now called Squaw Pass) to Echo Lake beginning in 1919. By 1920, the road had only managed to be constructed to Chief Mountain.\\"Car and Camera\\" 1920 The Mountain Parks. In Municipal Facts. Volume 3, numbers 3‚Äì4 March‚ÄìApril. By October 1 of 1921, the Bureau of Public Roads had completed construction to Echo Lake.No Author 1921 Echo Lake Purchased. In Municipal Facts. Volume 4, numbers 9‚Äì10 September‚ÄìOctober. The first survey for the road from Echo Lake to the peak of Mount Evans was made in 1923, finishing the layout by January 1924 despite a flu outbreak in the camp, damaging windstorms, and nearly insurmountable environmental hardships.Sampson, Edith 1931 The Giant Highway. In Municipal Facts, Volume 13, numbers 3‚Äì4 March‚ÄìApril. Battling the unusual problems that come with high-altitude construction (steam shovels performing only half as effective at high altitude, difficulty of hauling coal and water, horse suicide, etc.) the last 600 feet were finally built by hand, being completed in 1930.Sampson, Edith 1930 Along the World's Highest Automobile Road. In Municipal Facts, Volume 13, numbers 9‚Äì10 September‚ÄìOctober. The ruins of the Crest House (1941‚Äì1942) sit nearby. Once containing both a restaurant and a gift shop, it burned down on September 1, 1979 and was not rebuilt, but remains as a place of contemplation today. The rock foundation and walls remain as a windbreak for mountain travelers, and the viewing platform is one of Colorado's premier scenic overlooks. Mt. Evans also hosts the annual Mt. Evans Hill Climb, a bicycle race with a total of of climbing.  Environment  = Climate = The atmospheric pressure on the summit is around 460 torr (610 mb), while a standard atmosphere (sea level) is 760 torr (1013 mb). At this pressure, many people suffer from altitude sickness.Erling Asmussen and Frank C. Consolazio, The Circulation and Rest and Work on Mount Evans (4,300 M.), [ajplegacy.physiology.org/cgi/reprint/132/2/555.pdf American Journal of Physiology], Vol 132, No. 2 (Feb. 1941); page 555. Summit Lake Park on Mount Evans The climate on the summit of Mount Evans can be extreme. The mean annual temperature on the summit is 18 ¬∞F (-8 ¬∞C).Jack D. Ives and Barry D. Fahey, Permafrost Occurrence in the Front Range, Colorado Rocky Mountains, U.S.A. Journal of Glaciology , Vol. 10, No. 58 (Spring 1971); pages 105-111. Temperatures rarely fall below 0 ¬∞F (-18 ¬∞C), but occasionally fall as low as -40 ¬∞F (-40 ¬∞C). The highest temperature recorded on the summit was 65 ¬∞F (18 ¬∞C), and below freezing temperatures may occur at any time of year. The maximum wind speed measured was 107 knots (123 mph or 198 km/h), while the average is from 25 to 30 knots (28 to 35 mph or 46 to 56 km/h). When the wind speed is over 15 knots (17 mph or 28 km/h), the wind is almost always from the west-southwest.Robert E. Stencel, Challenges and Opportunities in Operating a High-Altitude Site, Organizations and Strategies in Astronomy, Vol. 6, Springer, 2006; page 97 (for weather data, see sections 2 and 3.2). =2012 Tornado= At 2:51 pm on July 28, 2012, a weak, short-lived tornado touched down northeast of Mount Evans' summit at an elevation estimated by the National Weather Service of above sea level. The tornado was the second highest recorded in the United States but did not cause any damage because it was above tree line. =Flora= The slopes of Mount Evans include several distinct environments. Below Echo Lake, the montane forest is dominated by lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and in some areas, blue spruce (Picea pungens), with patches of quaking aspen. Echo Lake is high enough to be in the subalpine forest, where Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and bristlecone pine (Pinus aristata) dominate. At tree line, the trees are reduced to krummholz, battered and twisted by wind and frost. The bristlecone pine grove on the east slope of Mount Goliath () contains at least one tree that sprouted in the year 403 AD. For many years, these were the oldest known trees in Colorado, but in 1992, trees dating to 442 BC were found in the southern Front Range and South Park.F. Craig Brunstein, David K. Yamaguchi, The Oldest Known Rocky Mountain Bristlecone Pines (Pinus aristata Engelm.), Arctic and Alpine Research , Vol. 24, No. 3 (Aug. 1992); pages 253-256. The Mount Goliath Natural Area, jointly managed by the United States Forest Service and the Denver Botanic Gardens protects this grove of old trees.Maryann Gaug, 8 Mount Goliath Natural Area, Hiking Colorado: An Atlas of Colorado's Greatest Hiking Adventures, Morris Book Publishing, 2003; pages 61-66. Above tree line, the landscape is mostly alpine tundra. In the lower tundra, dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) is common, along with a wide variety of flowering plants such as Rocky Mountain Columbine (Aquilegia saximontana) and various species of dwarf alpine sunflowers. Toward the summit, the vegetation shrinks until the largest plants are little more than compact green cushions in the cracks between the rocks. Here, Alpine Forget-me-not (Myosotis alpestris) plants with hundreds of blossoms occupy areas of only a few square centimeters and rise only centimeters above the soil surface. The tundra around Summit Lake, particularly in Summit Lake Flats, the gently sloping area east of the lake, is frequently described as the southernmost area of arctic tundra in the world because it is water saturated and underlain by an extensive area of permafrost. =Fauna= Mt Evans - mountain goats The top predators found in the area are mountain lions (Puma concolor), anywhere on the mountain, and black bears (Ursus americanus) as well as grizzly bears, generally below tree line. These prey on bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) and mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus),John Axelson, Region 2, Big Game Hunter's Guide to Colorado, Wilderness Adventure Press, 2008; page 245, 259. as well as one of the highest densities of yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris) in the region. Above tree-line, pikas (Ochotona princeps) are common. Below tree line, elk (Cervus canadensis) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) are common. Among birds, the white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucurus) are present on the mountain, but so well camouflaged that they are difficult to see even when almost underfoot.Mary Taylor Gray, Herbert Clarke, White-Tailed Ptarmigan, The Guide to Colorado Birds, Westcliffe, 1998; page 74. Brown-capped rosy finches (Leucosticte australis), pipits and rock wrens (Salpinctes obsoletus) are also seen near the summit.Hugh E. Kingery, Mount Evans, Birding Colorado Morris Book Publishing, 2007; page 131.  Geology  Mount Evans was carved from the rock of the Mount Evans Batholith, formed by an intrusion of magma into the earth's crust about 1.4 billion years ago (in the Mesoproterozoic Era of the Precambrian Eon). Much of the rock is granodiorite, a close relative of granite, modified by later intrusions of quartz and pegmatite.Ralph L. Hopkins and Lindy B. Hopkins, Hike 7: Chicago Lakes -- The Mount Evans Batholith, Hiking Colorado's Geology, The Mountaineers, Seattle, 2000; page 67. The body of this batholith has been deeply cut by glacial cirques and canyons. Each of the nearby lakes, Summit Lake, the Chicago Lakes, Lincoln Lake and Abyss Lake are tarns located in cirques or glacial canyons surrounding Mount Evans.Scott S. Warren, Mount Evans Wilderness Area, Exploring Colorado's Wild Areas, 2nd ed, Mountaineers Books, Seattle, 2002; page 91. Echo Lake was dammed by a lateral moraine of the glacier that formed Chicago Canyon. Prior to glaciation, Mount Evans, Long's Peak and several other summits were monadnocks in an upland Peneplain. Glaciation has not entirely destroyed the ancient Flattop Peneplain, named for Flattop Mountain in Grand County. The peaks of these mountains are all remnant features of this peneplain.Willis T. Lee, Peneplains of the Front Range and Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado United States Geological Survey Bulletin 730; page 15.  Scientific research  View from the summit of Mount Evans of the end of the Mount Evans Scenic Byway, Crest House and the Meyer‚ÄìWomble Observatory, 2010. The easy access to the summit provided by the Mount Evans Highway has made it a popular location for scientific research. Arthur H. Compton conducted pioneering research on cosmic rays on the mountain in 1931, shortly after the road to the summit was completed. The University of Denver built a pair of A-frame buildings on the summit to house cosmic-ray researchers.Ben Fogelberg and Steve Grinstead, Hike 25: Mount Evans ‚Äì A Peak with a Past, Walking into Colorado's Past, Westcliffe, Englewood Colo,; page 119.Arthur H. Compton, Chapter 19, The Cosmos of Arthur Holly Compton, Knopf, 1968; page 206. By the 1950s, Mount Evans, the Aiguille du Midi, the Pic du Midi and the Jungfrau were considered the premier locations for high-altitude physics experiments.Val L. Fitch, The œÑ-Œ∏ puzzle: an experimentalist's perspective, Pions to Quarks: Particle Physics in the 1950s Cambridge University Press, 1989; page 460. The first accurate measurement of the lifetime of the muon (originally called the mesotron) by Bruno Rossi in 1939, used sites at Mount Evans, Echo Lake, Denver and Chicago. This experiment verified the reality of time dilation, one of the key predictions of Einstein's theory of relativity.Laurie M. Brown, Abraham Pais, Brian Pippard, Section 5.5, 20th Century Physics, AIP Press, 1995; Pages 394‚Äì399.Bruno Rossi, Norman Hilberry, J. Barton Hoag, The Variation of the Hard Component of Cosmic Rays with Height and the Disintigration of Mesotrons, Physical Review, Vol. 57, No. 6 (March 1940); page 491. In the summer of 1948, MIT, Cornell, Princeton, NYU and the universities of Michigan and Chicago and Denver conducted an intensive experimental program on the mountain and at Echo Lake. Bruno Rossi and Giuseppe Cocconi were among those involved.Johnny Florea, Cosmic Ray Research: Seven Colleges Join to Study Nature's Mightiest Force (photoessay), Life, Vol. 25, No. 19 (Nov. 8, 1948); pages 119‚Äì125. In 1965, the Midwestern Universities Research Association began doing high-energy physics experiments on the summit using cosmic rays to explore energies above those accessible with the most powerful particle accelerators of the day. The first experiments were conducted in a semi-trailer, and then in 1966, a temporary laboratory building was erected near the summit. This building was moved to Echo Lake that fall, where research continued until 1972.Lawrence W. Jones, The History, Highlights and Outcome of the Michigan ‚Äì Wisconsin Echo Lake Cosmic Ray Program, 1965‚Äì1972: An Informal Review, UM-HE 73-9, University of Michigan, February 1973. The University of Denver erected the 0.6m (24 inch) Ritchey‚ÄìChr√©tien telescope in its summit laboratory in 1972. This was used to observe comets Kohoutek and Halley in 1972 and 1986. In 1996, the University finished construction on the Meyer‚ÄìWomble Observatory, near the site of the A-frame laboratory buildings. At 14,148 feet (4,312 m) this was, from 1972 to 1999, the world's highest optical observatory. It is now the third-highest. Mount Evans has also been the site of significant research in the life sciences. In 1940, for example, it was the site of a significant study of high-altitude physiology. Pioneering studies on the effects of altitude training on track athletes were conducted on Mount Evans in 1966.Elsworth Buskirk , from the Living History of Physiology web site of the American Physiological Society, 2008. Mount Evans Road is also noteworthy as a high-altitude vehicle testing venue for auto manufacturers. With full visibility on a public road, most manufacturers' road test teams tend to conceal their designs with various creative styles of camouflage, e.g. wild zebra paint motif, possibly paired with other temporary body coverings.  Naming Controversy  Mount Evans is named after territorial Governor John Evans, instigator of the Sand Creek Massacre, which resulted in the death of between 150-500 Cheyenne and Arapaho Native Americans. Attempts have been made to change the name in Colorado due to the history and actions of Governor Evans. In 2020, Governor Polis established The Colorado Geographic Naming Advisory Board, which includes Mount Evans for a possible renaming.

Although this condition predominantly affects females, up to 16% of males suffer as well. Symptoms include pelvic pain, pressure, pain during sex, incontinence, incomplete emptying of feces, and visible organ protrusion. Tissues surrounding the pelvic organs may have increased or decreased sensitivity or irritation resulting in pelvic pain. Underlying causes of pelvic pain are often difficult to determine. The condition affects up to 50% of women who have given birth. Pelvic floor dysfunction may include any of a group of clinical conditions that includes urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, sensory and emptying abnormalities of the lower urinary tract, defecatory dysfunction, sexual dysfunction and several chronic pain syndromes, including vulvodynia in women and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) in men. The three most common and definable conditions encountered clinically are urinary incontinence, anal incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. Causes Mechanistically, the causes of pelvic floor dysfunction are two-fold: widening of the pelvic floor hiatus and descent of pelvic floor below the pubococcygeal line, with specific organ prolapse graded relative to the hiatus. Associations include obesity, menopause, pregnancy and childbirth.Abbey Hospitals Gynaecology and Vaginal Repair information Some women may be more likely to developing pelvic floor dysfunction because of an inherited deficiency in their collagen type. Some women may have congenitally weak connective tissue and fascia and are therefore at risk of stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. By definition, postpartum pelvic floor dysfunction only affects women who have given birth, though pregnancy rather than birth or birth method is thought to be the cause. A study of 184 first-time mothers who delivered by Caesarean section and 100 who delivered vaginally found that there was no significant difference in the prevalence of symptoms 10 months following delivery, suggesting that pregnancy is the cause of incontinence for many women irrespective of their mode of delivery. The study also suggested that the changes which occur to the properties of collagen and other connective tissues during pregnancy may affect pelvic floor function. Pelvic floor dysfunction can result after pelvic radiation, as well as treatment for gynegological cancers. Diagnosis Pelvic floor dysfunction can be diagnosed by history and physical exam, though it is more accurately graded by imaging. Historically, fluoroscopy with defecography and cystography were used, though modern imaging allows the usage of MRI to complement and sometimes replace fluoroscopic assessment of the disorder, allowing for less radiation exposure and increased patient comfort, though an enema is required the evening before the procedure. Instead of contrast, ultrasound gel is used during the procedure with MRI. Both methods assess the pelvic floor at rest and maximum strain using coronal and sagittal views. When grading individual organ prolapse, the rectum, bladder and uterus are individually assessed, with prolapse of the rectum referred to as a rectocele, bladder prolapse through the anterior vaginal wall a cystocele, and small bowel an enterocele. To assess the degree of dysfunction, three measurements must be taken into account. First, an anatomic landmark known as the pubococcygeal line must be determined, which is a straight line connecting the inferior margin of the pubic symphysis at the midline with the junction of the first and second coccygeal elements on a sagittal image. After this, the location of the puborectalis muscle sling is assessed, and a perpendicular line between the pubococcygeal line and muscle sling is drawn. This provides a measurement of pelvic floor descent, with descent greater than 2 cm being considered mild, and 6 cm being considered severe. Lastly, a line from the pubic symphysis to the puborectalis muscle sling is drawn, which is a measurement of the pelvic floor hiatus. Measurements of greater than 6 cm are considered mild, and greater than 10 cm severe. The degree of organ prolapse is assessed relative to the hiatus. The grading of organ prolapse relative to the hiatus is more strict, with any descent being considered abnormal, and greater than 4 cm being considered severe. Treatment There are various procedures used to address prolapse. Cystoceles are treated with a surgical procedure known as a Burch colposuspension, with the goal of suspending the prolapsed urethra so that the urethrovesical junction and proximal urethra are replaced in the pelvic cavity. Uteroceles are treated with hysterectomy and uterosacral suspension. With enteroceles, the prolapsed small bowel is elevated into the pelvis cavity and the rectovaginal fascia is reapproximated. Rectoceles, in which the anterior wall of the rectum protrudes into the posterior wall of the vagina, require posterior colporrhaphy. Pelvic floor dysfunction is common for many women and includes symptoms that can affect all aspects of everyday life and activities. Pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training is vital for treating different types of pelvic floor dysfunction. Two common problems are uterine prolapse and urinary incontinence both of which stem from muscle weakness. Without the ability to control PFM, pelvic floor training cannot be done successfully. Being able to control PFM is vital for a well functioning pelvic floor. Through vaginal palpation exams and the use of biofeedback the tightening, lifting, and squeezing actions of these muscles can be determined. In addition, abdominal muscle training has been shown to improve pelvic floor muscle function. By increasing abdominal muscle strength and control, a person may have an easier time activating the pelvic floor muscles in sync with the abdominal muscles. Many physiotherapists are specially trained to address the muscles weaknesses associated with pelvic floor dysfunction and through intervention can effectively treat this. Common physical therapy interventions in male pelvic floor rehabilitation include myofascial trigger point release of both the internal and external pelvic floor and abdominal musculature, therapeutic exercises, biofeedback, and neuromodulation. Epidemiology The condition is widespread, affecting up to 50 percent of women at some point in their lifetime. About 11 percent of women will undergo surgery for urinary incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse by age 80. 30 percent of those undergoing surgery will have at least two surgeries in trying to correct the problem.

The , 17 station Green Line running from Ballard to West Seattle via Seattle Center would have been the first of the five lines to be built. From 1997 to 2005 the monorail project was a highly contentious political issue in the Seattle area. In November 2005, following the fifth voter initiative on the monorail in eight years, the monorail authority agreed to dissolve itself after having spent $124.7 million in taxpayer funds without beginning any monorail construction. Origins The effort to extend the monorail began in 1997 with the 53% to 47% passage of Initiative 41 by Seattle voters. The initiative proposed a X-shaped monorail system extending the line constructed for the 1962 Seattle World's Fair. The system's construction and operation was to be carried out by a new agency, the Elevated Transportation Corporation (ETC), using private funding. The ETC quickly determined that private entrepreneurs were not going to build a monorail system without public financial support, leading to a second monorail initiative, allowing the ETC to spend $6 million for additional studies to determine an improved monorail plan with full cost estimates and a funding package to pay for construction. This initiative passed 56% to 44% in 2000. By 2002, the ETC had developed the five-line system plan that came to be called the Seattle Monorail Project. This proposal was put before the voters as Citizens Petition #1 in November 2002 which would propose to dissolve the ETC, create a new monorail agency, construct the Green Line as the first part of the system, and enact an annual 1.4% motor-vehicle excise tax (MVET) on Seattle vehicles to fund the project. The 2002 petition drew opposition from groups who argued that: the Green Line ridership would not be significantly different from that already achieved by Metro buses; that building an elevated line with deep concrete beams on Second Avenue in downtown would create a \\"wall\\" through the urban core; and that the monorail line should be built along the I-5 freeway corridor, among other complaints. Reflecting the increased opposition, Citizens Petition #1 passed by just 877 votes, 50.2% to 49.7%. With this November 2002 passage, construction was expected to begin in autumn 2005, and be completed in 2009. Just two years later in November 2004, a recall initiative, I-83, was put forth seeking to halt the project by forcing the city to deny the monorail agency the right to use the air space above public city streets. This fourth initiative in seven years proved unpopular with Seattle voters however, and lost 64% to 36%. Financing troubles and defeat The tax to fund the project began effective June 2003, and was levied annually on each car registered in the city based on the MSRP of the vehicle and a fixed depreciation table. In 2005, the average monorail tax per vehicle was $130 annually. The project soon fell under intense public scrutiny, when actual revenue from the motor vehicle excise tax came in 30% under projections while projected costs rose by 10%. To bridge the shortfall, the SMP initially proposed extending the tax and bond repayments over a 50-year time horizon, resulting in nearly $9 billion in interest paid on the $2 billion construction. The plan proved highly controversial and five days later the SMP withdrew its financial plan and the director and board chairman resigned under pressure. The then-Mayor Greg Nickels gave the board an ultimatum to create a new plan or lose city support for the project. A new plan was not developed, and on September 16, 2005, Nickels withdrew city support for the project. While the city of Seattle could not officially stop the project, it could withhold permission to build on or above city land, as had been proposed under I-83 a year earlier. Nickels also called on the Seattle Monorail Project to put a measure on the November 2005 ballot to determine whether or not to continue with the project, marking the fifth time Seattleites had voted on the issue. This measure shortened the initial phase of the Green Line to with the remaining to be added later, and the SMP said it would dissolve itself if the measure failed. Proposition 1 was defeated, 65% to 35%, and in response the SMP reduced staff, terminated the annual motor vehicle excise tax on Seattle vehicles effective June 30, 2006 (three years after it was first implemented) and began liquidating properties already purchased for the Green Line. The Seattle Monorail Authority was formally dissolved on January 17, 2008, after liquidating all of its assets, repaying its debts, and transferring its remaining $425,963.07 to the King County Metro system. The monorail project ultimately cost Seattle taxpayers $124.7 million.

Biography His earliest work known to the public was for one of New York City's top urban radio station WRKS 98.7 Kiss FM, and later as remixer/producer for the disco/dance label Salsoul Records. His prowess at production and mixing led him to work with such artists as Madonna and George Michael in the late 1980s during the height of these artists' popularity. Together with Arthur Baker, he helped to popularize many aspects of dance and hip-hop culture, such as scratching.

It is native to the east Caribbean islands, in particular the island of Inagua in the Bahamas, after which the species is named. In its native environment, the plant crawls along sunny, rocky outcroppings, semi-protected from steady high winds. It is a loose, spreading shrub with many branches up to 2 m high, with mature trunks of 5‚Äì10 cm diameter. The leaves are aromatic, simple, opposite (or fascicled), elliptic to obovate or spatulate, 5‚Äì10 mm long, with revolute margins. The flowerheads are axillary, sessile, few-flowered, with a strigose calyx; the corolla is whitish, about 2 mm long, four-lobed, and with four stamens. The fragrant foliage and tiny white flowers are highly attractive to pollinators, in particular the Atala butterfly. Cultivation and uses It is often used as a bonsai plant due to its miniaturized features. The flowers form in clusters and are followed by reddish orange berries. It prefers full sun, warmth (a minimum temperature of 5 ¬∞C) and must be kept under high humidity. Even a brief spell of dryness can kill the plant. It can be propagated from cuttings, preferably in the spring and early summer during warm nights. A decoction of the fragrant leaves, variously described as having the scent and flavor of citrus, vanilla, or pineapple, is used as an herbal tea.

It is a description of what happens when a system embraces specialization and trade and \\"constitutes an information gathering process, able to call up, and put to use, widely dispersed information that no central planning agency, let alone any individual, could know as a whole, possess or control.‚ÄùHayek, F.A. \\"The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism\\". The University of Chicago Press. 1991. The result is an interconnected web where people can benefit from the actions and knowledge of those they don't know. This is possible and efficient because a proper legal framework replaces trust, which is only practical in small circles of people who know each other socially. The extended order is at the heart of Hayek's thesis, in The Fatal Conceit, where he argues that \\"our civilization depends, not only for its origin but also for its preservation, on what can be precisely described only as the extended order of human cooperation, an order more commonly, if somewhat misleading, known as capitalism.‚Äù Development of the extended order in society The extended order \\"is a framework of institutions ‚Äì economic, legal, and moral ‚Äì into which we fit ourselves by obeying certain rules of conduct that we never made, and which we have never understood in the sense of which we understand how the things that we manufacture function.‚Äù This \\"order resulted not from human design or intention but spontaneously: it arose from unintentionally conforming to certain traditional & largely moral practices, many of which men tend to dislike, whose significance they usually fail to understand, whose validity they cannot prove, and which have nonetheless fairly rapidly spread by means of an evolutionary selection ‚Äì the comparative increase in population & wealth ‚Äì of those groups that happened to follow them.‚Äù The adoption of these practices, by these groups, ‚Äúincreased their access to valuable information of all sorts, & enabled them to be 'fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it' (Genesis 1:28). This process is perhaps the least appreciated facet of human evolution.‚Äù The extended order's formation ‚Äúrequired individuals to change their ‚Äònatural‚Äô or instinctual‚Äô responses to others, something strongly resisted\\", whereas any & all \\"constraints on the practices of the small group, it must be emphasized & repeated, are hated.‚Äù This is because man ‚Äúknows so many objects that seem desirable but for which he is not permitted to grasp, and he cannot see how other beneficial features of his environment depend on the discipline to which he is forced to submit ‚Äì a discipline forbidding him to reach out for these same appealing objects. Disliking these constraints so much, we can hardly be said to have selected them; rather, these constraints selected us: they enabled us to survive.‚Äù The evolutionary process of the extended order can be stimulated by increases in individual freedom and has even realized some of its greatest advances during times of anarchy, however it can (and quite often has throughout history) been hindered by government constraint, as Hayek says, \\"Protection of several property, not the direction of its use by government, laid the foundations for the growth of the dense network of exchange of services that shaped the extended order.\\" The extended order is \\"not a creation of man's reason but a distinct second endowment conferred on him by cultural evolution.\\" Not being genetically transferred, the continuing cultural evolution of the extended order requires teaching & passing on to each new generation the prevailing traditions, customs, morality & rules. This cultural evolutionary requirement was also analyzed by Will and Ariel Durant who said: \\"Civilization is not inherited; it has to be learned and earned by each generation anew; if the transmission should be interrupted for one century, civilization would die, and we should be savages again.\\"Will Durant and Ariel Durant, \\"The Lessons of History\\".

It is a process in social networks including economics, though the term \\"self-organization\\" is more often used for physical changes and biological processes, while \\"spontaneous order\\" is typically used to describe the emergence of various kinds of social orders from a combination of self-interested individuals who are not intentionally trying to create order through planning. The evolution of life on Earth, language, crystal structure, the Internet and a free market economy have all been proposed as examples of systems which evolved through spontaneous order. Spontaneous orders are to be distinguished from organizations. Spontaneous orders are distinguished by being scale-free networks, while organizations are hierarchical networks. Further, organizations can be and often are a part of spontaneous social orders, but the reverse is not true. Further, while organizations are created and controlled by humans, spontaneous orders are created, controlled, and controllable by no one. In economics and the social sciences, spontaneous order is defined as \\"the result of human actions, not of human design\\". Spontaneous order is an equilibrium behavior between self-interested individuals, which is most likely to evolve and survive, obeying the natural selection process \\"survival of the likeliest\\".

The philosopher rejected the authoritarianism of Confucianism, writing that there \\"has been such a thing as letting mankind alone; there has never been such a thing as governing mankind [with success].\\" He articulated an early form of spontaneous order, asserting that \\"good order results spontaneously when things are let alone\\", a concept later \\"developed particularly by Proudhon in the nineteenth [century]\\".Rothbard, Murray. Concepts of the Role of Intellectuals in Social Change Toward Laissez Faire, The Journal of Libertarian Studies, Vol. IX No. 2 (Fall 1990) The thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment developed and inquired into the idea of the market as a spontaneous order. In 1767, the sociologist and historian Adam Ferguson described society as the \\"result of human action, but not the execution of any human design\\".Adam Ferguson on The History of Economic Thought Website However, the term ‚Äúspontaneous order‚Äù seems to have been coined by Michael Polanyi in his essay, ‚ÄúThe Growth of Thought in Society,‚Äù Economica 8 (November 1941): 428‚Äì456.Straun Jacobs, ‚ÄúMichael Polanyi‚Äôs Theory of Spontaneous Orders,‚Äù Review of Austrian Economics 11, nos. 1‚Äì2 (1999): 111‚Äì127. The Austrian School of Economics, led by Carl Menger, Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek made it a centerpiece in its social and economic thought. Hayek's theory of spontaneous order is the product of two related but distinct influences that do not always tend in the same direction. As an economic theorist, his explanations can be given a rational explanation. But as a legal and social theorist, he leans, by contrast, very heavily on a conservative and traditionalist approach which instructs us to submit blindly to a flow of events over which we can have little control.Barry, Norman (University of Buckingham) - Literature of Liberty; Vol. v, no. 2, pp. 7-58. Arlington, VA: Institute for Humane Studies Pub. Date 1982 Examples =Markets= Many conservative theoristsMACCORMICK, D.N. (1989), Spontaneous Order and the Rule of Law: Some Problems. Ratio Juris, 2: 41-54. doi:10.1111/j.1467-9337.1989.tb00025.x, such as Hayek, have argued that market economies are a spontaneous order, \\"a more efficient allocation of societal resources than any design could achieve.\\"Hayek cited. Petsoulas, Christian. Hayek's Liberalism and Its Origins: His Idea of Spontaneous Order and the Scottish Enlightenment. Routledge. 2001. p. 2 They claim this spontaneous order (referred to as the extended order in Hayek's The Fatal Conceit) is superior to any order a human mind can design due to the specifics of the information required.Hayek, F.A. The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism. The University of Chicago Press. 1991. p. 6. Centralized statistical data, they suppose, cannot convey this information because the statistics are created by abstracting away from the particulars of the situation.Hayek cited. Boaz, David. The Libertarian Reader. The Free Press. 1997. p. 220 For Hayek, prices in a market economy are the aggregation of information acquired when the people who own resources are free to use their individual knowledge. Price then allows everyone dealing in a commodity or its substitutes to make decisions based on more information than he or she could personally acquire, information not statistically conveyable to a centralized authority. Interference from a central authority which affects price will have consequences they could not foresee because they do not know all of the particulars involved. According to Barry this is illustrated in the concept of the invisible hand proposed by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations. Thus in this view by acting on information with greater detail and accuracy than possible for any centralized authority, a more efficient economy is created to the benefit of a whole society. Lawrence Reed, president of the Foundation for Economic Education, describes spontaneous order as follows: > Spontaneous order is what happens when you leave people alone‚Äîwhen > entrepreneurs... see the desires of people... and then provide for them. > They respond to market signals, to prices. Prices tell them what's needed > and how urgently and where. And it's infinitely better and more productive > than relying on a handful of elites in some distant bureaucracy.Stossel, > John (2011-02-10) Spontaneous Order, Reason Hayek, or at least his followers on the contemporary British and American political scene ‚Äê have wrongly inferred strong conclusions from these theories which are inimical to the welfare state by failing to reconcile the rule of law to social justice.MACCORMICK, D.N. (1989), Spontaneous Order and the Rule of Law: Some Problems. Ratio Juris, 2: 41-54. doi:10.1111/j.1467-9337.1989.tb00025.x =Game studies= The concept of spontaneous order is closely related with modern game studies. As early as the 1940s, historian Johan Huizinga wrote that \\"in myth and ritual the great instinctive forces of civilized life have their origin: law and order, commerce and profit, craft and art, poetry, wisdom and science. All are rooted in the primeval soil of play.\\" Following on this in his book The Fatal Conceit, Hayek notably wrote that \\"a game is indeed a clear instance of a process wherein obedience to common rules by elements pursuing different and even conflicting purposes results in overall order.\\" =Anarchism= Anarchists argue that the state is in fact an artificial creation of the ruling elite, and that true spontaneous order would arise if it was eliminated. Construed by some but not all as the ushering in of organization by anarchist law. In the anarchist view, such spontaneous order would involve the voluntary cooperation of individuals. According to the Oxford Dictionary of Sociology, \\"the work of many symbolic interactionists is largely compatible with the anarchist vision, since it harbours a view of society as spontaneous order.\\" =Sobornost= The concept of spontaneous order can also be seen in the works of the Russian Slavophile movements and specifically in the works of Fyodor Dostoyevsky. The concept of an organic social manifestation as a concept in Russia expressed under the idea of sobornost. Sobornost was also used by Leo Tolstoy as an underpinning to the ideology of Christian anarchism. The concept was used to describe the uniting force behind the peasant or serf Obshchina in pre-Soviet Russia.Faith and Order: The Reconciliation of Law and Religion By Harold Joseph p. 388 Berman Wm.

In addition to arguing the economy is a spontaneous order, which he termed a catallaxy, he argued that common lawThe Constitution of Liberty; Law, Legislation and Liberty and the brainThe Sensory Order are also types of spontaneous orders. In \\"The Republic of Science,\\"http://fiesta.bren.ucsb.edu/~gsd/595e/docs/41.%20Polanyi_Republic_of_Science.pdf Michael Polanyi also argued that science is a spontaneous order, a theory further developed by Bill Butos and Thomas McQuade in a variety of papers. Gus DiZerega has argued that democracy is the spontaneous order form of government,Persuasion, Power, and Polity David Emmanuel Andersson has argued that religion in places like the United States is a spontaneous order, and Troy Camplin argues that artistic and literary production are spontaneous orders. Paul Krugman too has contributed to spontaneous order theory in his book The Self-Organizing Economy,The Self-Organizing Economy in which he claims that cities are self-organizing systems. Credibility thesis suggests that the credibility of social institutions is the driving factor behind the endogenous self-organization of institutions and their persistence. The competitions between huge numbers of self-interested individuals will lead to many possible income distributions. Among all possible income distributions, exponential income distribution will occur with the highest probability. Following the natural selection process \\"survival of the likeliest\\", the exponential income distribution is most likely to evolve and survive, and hence is called the \\"Spontaneous Order\\" by Tao. By analyzing datasets of household income from 66 countries and Hong Kong SAR, ranging from Europe to Latin America, North America and Asia, Tao et al found that, for all of these countries, the income distribution for the great majority of populations (low and middle income classes) follows an exponential income distribution.

Win4Lin was based on Merge software, a product which changed owners several times until it was bought by Win4Lin Inc. Citing changes in the desktop virtualization industry, the software's publisher, Virtual Bridges, has discontinued Win4Lin Pro. Products and technology In 2006, Win4Lin came in three different versions, depending on the virtualization requirements of the user. * Win4Lin 9x allowed the user to run a full copy of Windows 98 or Windows Me inside a virtual machine. * Win4Lin Home allowed users to only emulate applications. * Win4Lin Pro offered users the ability to install a fully virtualized Windows 2000 or Windows XP. The Win4Lin 9x/Pro (henceforth the only technology discussed in this section) operates by running Windows applications in a virtual machine. Unlike Wine or CrossOver which are emulation-based, virtualization-based software such as VMware or Win4Lin require users to have a Windows license in order to run applications since they must install a full copy of Windows within the virtual machine. Unlike VMware, however, Win4Lin provides the virtual guest operating system with access to the native Linux filesystem, and allows the Linux host to access the guest's files even when the virtual machine is not running. In addition to the convenience this offers, Computerworld found in their 2002 review that Win4Lin gained significant performance over VMware by using the native Linux filesystem, but also noted that this approach (unlike VMware's) limited the installation of only one version of Windows on a Win4Lin machine. When the Win4Lin application starts it displays a window on the Linux desktop which contains the Windows desktop environment. Users can then install or run applications as they normally would from within Windows. Win4Lin supports Linux printers, internet connections, and Windows networking, but , does not support DirectX and by extension most Windows games. They also offered Win4BSD for FreeBSD.http://www.freebsdsoftware.org/emulators/win4bsd.html History Win4Lin was initially based on Merge software originally developed at Locus Computing Corporation, and which changed hands several times until it ended in the assets of NeTraverse, which were purchased in 2005 by Win4Lin Inc., which introduced Win4Lin Pro Desktop.So You Want To Run Windows 2000 and Windows XP Apps On Linux? Win4Lin Out From Under Windows 98 Bondage, 2005 This was based on a 'tuned' version of QEMU and KQEMU, and it hosted [Windows NT]-versions of Windows. In June 2006, Win4Lin released Win4VDI for Linux based on the same code base. Win4VDI for Linux served Microsoft Windows desktops to thin clients from a Linux server. Virtual Bridges discontinued support for Win4Lin 9x in 2007. The Win4Lin Pro Desktop product ceased to be supported in March 2010. Reception Many users reported that the 9x version ran windows software at near-native speed, even on quite low-powered machines, such as Pentium-IIs.

It would have been launched at sea, from an amphibious assault ship beyond the horizon, able to transport a full Marine rifle squad to shore. It would maneuver cross country with an agility and mobility equal to or greater than the M1 Abrams. The EFV was designed to replace the aging AAV-7A1 Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV), which entered service in 1972, and was the Marine Corps' number one priority ground weapon system acquisition. It was to have had three times the speed in water and about twice the armor of the AAV, as well as superior firepower. The vehicle was to be deployed in 2015; however, on 6 January 2011, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates recommended the EFV program be canceled. The program, which was projected to cost $15 billion, had already cost $3 billion. The Marines asked for the EFV to be canceled in favor of the Assault Amphibian Vehicle Service Life Extension Program and the Marine Personnel Carrier, which itself became phase one of the Amphibious Combat Vehicle.Kuiper, Jahn R. \\"EFV ousted for less costly triumvirate.\\" USMC, 22 March 2011. History In the 1980s, the US Marine Corps developed an \\"over the horizon\\" strategy for ocean-based assaults. The intention was to protect naval ships from enemy mines and shore defenses. It included the MV-22 Osprey, the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC), and the EFV. Development for the AAAV began in August 1974 with Landing Vehicle Assault (LVA) prototypes that continued in the early 1980s at the command at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton. The AAAV's predecessor, the LVTP7, had its life expectancy extended in 1983‚Äì84 by use of a service life extension program, which modified and upgraded many of the key systems, creating the LVTP7A1 and re-designated it the AAVP7A1. At the time these vehicles were released, the USMC had anticipated and communicated delivery of the AAAV by 1993. As a result of delays, the AAVP7A1 has received another service life extension-type upgrade in the mid 1990s while the USMC still awaits final development and delivery of the AAAV, 14 years behind original projected time frames. In 1988, defense officials authorized the concept exploration and definition phase. In 1995, the program entered into the definition and risk reduction phase, where it won two DOD awards for successful cost and technology management. In June 1996, a contract was awarded to General Dynamics Land Systems to begin full-scale engineering development of their design. Based on the aforementioned early success of the program, the Marine Corps awarded a cost-plus contract to General Dynamics in July 2001 for the systems development and demonstration phase of the program, expected to be completed by October 2003. The AAAV was renamed to EFV in September 2003. The Government Accountability Office would later state that the development phase of three years was insufficient, causing delays and prototype failures, particularly in reliability. After the 2006 Operational Assessment was plagued by reliability issues and maintenance burdens, the Corps began a redesign of the EFV, requiring a new contract for an additional in February 2007. That June, a reset of the development phase delayed completion an additional four years. Instead of initiating production as planned, the corps asked for seven new prototypes, to address the current deficiencies, which have caused an average of one failure for every four and a half hours of operation. On 7 April 2009, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said that the EFV program will \\"continue as-is\\", pending an amphibious review in the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. The vehicle was called \\"exquisite\\", which Gates usually reserved for programs he intends to cancel. He later questioned the EFV as the proper ship-to-shore platform on 3 May 2010, the day before the initial prototype was rolled out at a ceremony at Marine Corps Base Quantico. The USMC had reduced the number to be purchased from 1,013 to 573 AAAVs by 2015 due to escalation in unit cost estimated at $22.3 million in 2007. The EFV might be a baseline vehicle for the Army's BCT Ground Combat Vehicle Program, however it is more likely that the army will start a new program. Low rate initial production (LRIP) was projected to begin in January 2012.USMC Anticipates EFV LRIP in 2012 Projected total program development cost of the type until first quarter of 2010 has been estimated at 15.9 billion dollars.Exhibit P-40, Budget Item Justification Sheet February 2007 http://www.finance.hq.navy.mil/FMB/08PRES/PROC/PMC_Book.pdf = Controversy = Robert O.

In a joint report, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group and the National Taxpayers Union called the EFV program wasteful spending and asked for its cancellation.\\"Left and Right Unite against Government Waste\\". AllGov, 5 November 2010 The co-chairs of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform have also supported the cancellation of the EFV. During a Pentagon briefing, on 6 January 2011, revealing budget efficiencies and reinvestment possibilities, Secretary of Defense Gates announced his intention to cancel the EFV program. In a statement released after Gates' press conference, USMC Commandant General Amos said that he supports the cancellation of the EFV: Loren B.

However, Hunter has predicted that his committee will reject the cancellation. According to Lieutenant General George J. Flynn of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command, the USMC will use funding from the cancelled EFV for other tactical ground vehicles over the next five years.

Design Diagram of EFVP1 variant The EFV, designed by General Dynamics Land Systems, was an amphibious armored tracked vehicle with an aluminum hull. The engine is a custom MTU Friedrichshafen diesel (MT883) with two modes of operation; a high power mode for planing over the sea, and a low power mode for land travel. It has a crew of three and can transport 17 marines and their equipment. The EFV would have been the first heavy tactical vehicle with a space frame structure. The hull had a hydraulically actuated bow flap to aid planing with a maximum waterborne speed of . Shrouded Honeywell waterjet propulsors are integrated into each side of the hull, which create over 2,800 horsepower of thrust. It was also outfitted with hydraulically actuated chines to cover the tracks while in seafaring mode. The vehicle uses an Ethernet network connected by the Tactical Switch Router, based on the COTS DuraMAR Mobile IP router for its internal and external communications. =Armament= The electrically powered two-man MK46 turret on the personnel variant accommodated the commander on the right and gunner on the left, a fire control system, and the main and coaxial weapons. The standard version was to have had a Mk44 Bushmaster II 30 mm cannon, which fired up to 250 rounds per minute with single, burst, and fully automatic capabilities up to in all weather conditions. A general purpose M240 7.62 mm machine gun with 600 rounds of ready-to-use ammunition was to be mounted coaxially with the main gun. =Countermeasures= EFVP1 engineering prototype undergoing shock testing The EFV was fitted with composite armor, mine-blast protection, and a nuclear, biological and chemical defense system. The aluminum hull caused some concern due to protection issues. However, aluminum hulls have been used for decades in military ground vehicles and watercraft. In June 2007 members of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces sent a letter to the Commandant of the Marine Corps urging that the EFV be redesigned to give troops better protection against roadside bombs. The Marines suggested that underbelly armor appliqu√© could be applied after the EFVs come ashore and before they encounter IEDs. The limited protection the EFV offers is an improvement on that offered by the AAV so the replacement is an advantage, given the current doctrine of using landing craft for land patrols. However, tests in January and February 2010 at Aberdeen Test Center demonstrated that the EFV offers blast protection equal to a category-2 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle, including two simulated improvised explosive devices under its belly and tracks. Tests also show that it has superior protection from direct and indirect fire. The flat hull, which has endured persistent criticism for not being the more blast-resistant V-shape, was necessary for the EFV to plane across the surface of the water and reach its high speed, while dealing with sea states of Category 4. On 13 October 2010 the navy awarded M Cubed Technologies a contract to develop new armor for the EFV to offer better protection and lighter weight.M Cubed Technologies, Inc. Wins Contract To Develop Armor For U.S. Marine Corps Fighting Vehicles M Cubed Technologies, Inc. press release, 13 October 2010 =Mobility= Given the increasing ranges of shore launched anti-ship missiles, the EFV's range for amphibious landing may no longer provide the anticipated protection predicted for an over the horizon launch. The U.S. Navy began reconsidering the over the horizon approach, and is considering 10‚Äì18 miles appropriate for amphibious launches. This shift in doctrine has made the EFV's high water speeds unnecessary. The EFV's need for high water speed has resulted in an engine that is 1,200 hp more powerful than the M1 Abrams, even though the EFV weighs far less.Craig Hooper, Proceedings, 2008 Variants =Personnel variant= The EFVP1 with a three-man crew would have conducted the signature mission of the United States Marine Corps, expeditionary maneuver warfare from seabases by initiating amphibious operations from 20 to 25 miles over-the- horizon and transporting 17 combat-equipped Marines to inland objectives. The fully armored, tracked combat vehicle would have provided firepower to disembarked or mechanized infantry with its own fully stabilized MK46 weapon station with the 30 mm cannon and 7.62mm machine-gun. =Command variant= EFVC1 The EFVC1 was to have provided the same survival and mobility capabilities found in the EFVP1. The EFVC1 would have been employed as a tactical command post for maneuver unit commanders at the battalion and regimental level. The EFVC1 would have provided the supported commander and selected staff with the ability to communicate, via on-board communications, with senior, adjacent, and subordinate maneuver units. The EFVC1 was to be armed with only a 7.62mm machine gun.

This style had its heyday from the mid-1920s to the mid-1930s. By the 1950s however, the trend of designing structures in the shape of the product sold there had changed to focus on signs rather than architecture itself. Randy's is represented by a giant doughnut on the roof of an otherwise ordinary drive-in that is a dedicated doughnut bakery. The building was designed by Henry J. Goodwin. There are actually two different sized doughnuts. Most locations used a 32 1/5 ft (9.8 meters) -diameter version that straddles the building and is aimed at the intersection. In Roadside Giant by Brian and Sarah Butko, the Weintraubs climbed on top of the doughnut with a tape measure and confirmed this for the authors. The Bellflower and Reseda locations, however, feature a small version of the doughnut on a pole out in front the building. This may be 23 feet (7 meters) in diameter, as is widely reported. The 24-hour drive-in is at 805 West Manchester Boulevard where it intersects with La Cienega Boulevard, and is near the Manchester Boulevard off-ramp of the San Diego Freeway (I-405). The shop's exterior has made numerous television and film appearances, including Arrested Development, Masked Rider, Entourage, The Golden Child, Get Shorty, Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles, Californication, Earth Girls Are Easy, Iron Man 2, Dope, 2012 and the pilot episode of The Bernie Mac Show, as well as the music videos of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' \\"Californication\\", Justin Timberlake's \\"Can't Stop The Feeling!,\\" Becky G's \\"Becky from the Block\\" and \\"Zooted\\" and Randy Newman's \\"I Love L.A.\\".  History  Randy's was built in 1953 (and first appears in the 1954 edition phone book) as the second location of the now-defunct Big Donut Drive-In chain by Russell C. Wendell, a doughnut machine salesman. There were 10 locations, built over the course of the 1950s. At least four other Big Donuts survive: they are Kindle's Donuts in unincorporated Westmont (this is the original location, built in 1950), the Donut King II in Gardena (3), Dale's Donuts in Compton (5), and Bellflower Bagels in Bellflower (8). Each features the distinctive giant doughnut constructed of rolled steel bars covered with gunite, a material used in swimming pools. Five Big Donuts have been demolished. They were located in Culver City (4), North Hollywood (6), Inglewood (on Imperial Hwy, 7), Van Nuys (9) and Reseda (10). In the 1970s Wendell sold off the individual stores to concentrate on his Pup 'N' Taco chain (which he sold to Taco Bell in 1984). Robert Eskow purchased the La Cienega location and later the Century and Normandie location in 1976 and named them \\"Randy's Donuts and Sandwiches\\" after his son. In 1977 a baker named Gary Kindle purchased the store on Normandie, which is still operating under the name Kindle's Donuts. In 1978, brothers Ron and Larry Weintraub, cousins to the Eskows, purchased the Randy's on Manchester and kept the name. Recently, they decided to retire, and sold the business to Mark Kelegian (reportedly for US$2 million), who is expanding the brand by opening a branch in the Westfield Century City Mall. Similar to the Big Donut chain is The Donut Hole of La Puente, California, the last of a chain of five stores featuring two drive-through fiberglass donuts on either side of a small bakery building. A number of Angel Food Donut stores in Long Beach also feature oversized doughnuts; these appear to have been manufactured out of metal duct work. Randy's Donuts opened a new store in El Segundo on September 10, 2018. Randy's Donuts is also planning to open locations throughout California, and internationally in South Korea and the Philippines.

In traditional artillery tactics, either a cannon, a howitzer or occasionally a mortar would fire a shot that would just clear the outer parapet of a fortification, and then would bounce or ricochet inside the fortification's bounds. One of the primary purposes of ricochet fire was to dismount artillery and guns positioned on an enemy's fortifications. Additionally, ricochet fire could also be used to cause chaos behind an enemy army's fortifications, as the ricocheting cannonball would devastate logistical structures not fortified to withstand cannon fire.

The London Clay is well known for its fossil content. The fossils from the lower Eocene rocks indicate a moderately warm climate, the tropical or subtropical flora. Though sea levels changed during the deposition of the clay, the habitat was generally a lush forest ‚Äì perhaps like in Indonesia or East Africa today ‚Äì bordering a warm, shallow ocean. The London Clay is a stiff bluish clay which becomes brown when weathered. Nodular lumps of pyrite and crystals of selenite (sometimes called \\"waterstones\\") frequently exist in the clay, and large septarian concretions are also common. These have been used in the past for making cement. They were once dug for this purpose at Sheppey, near Sittingbourne, and at Harwich, and also dredged, off the Hampshire coast. The clay is still used commercially for making bricks, tiles, and coarse pottery in places such as Michelmersh in Hampshire. Distribution and geology The London Clay is well developed in the London Basin, where it thins westwards from around in Essex and north Kent to around in Wiltshire. though it is not frequently exposed as it is to a great extent covered by more recent Neogene sediments and Pleistocene gravel deposits. One location of particular interest is Oxshott Heath, where the overlying sand and the London Clay layers are exposed as a sand escarpment, rising approximately . This supported a thriving brick industry in the area until the 1960s. The London Clay is also well developed in the Hampshire Basin, where an exposure thick occurs at Whitecliff Bay on the Isle of Wight and around is spread along of foreshore at Bognor Regis, West Sussex. The clay was deposited in a sea up to deep at the eastern end. Up to five cycles of deposition (representing transgression followed by shallowing of the sea) have been found, most markedly at the shallower, western end. Each cycle begins with coarser material (sometimes including rounded flint pebbles), followed by clay which becomes increasingly sandy. The final cycle ends with the Claygate Beds. =Claygate Beds= The youngest part of the London Clay, known as the Claygate Beds or Claygate Member forms a transition between the clay and the sandier Bagshot Beds above. This is shown separately on many geological maps, and often caps hills. It is up to thick at Claygate, Surrey. It is now believed to be diachronous, with the formation at Claygate for example being the same age as the end of the fourth cycle of deposition further east. Engineering The presence of a thick layer of London Clay underneath London itself, providing a soft yet stable environment for tunnelling, was instrumental in the early development of the London Underground, although this is also the reason why London had no true skyscraper buildings, at least to the same degree as many other cities throughout the world. Erecting tall buildings in London required very deep, large and costly piled foundations. This has changed in recent decades due to the development of 'plunge piles'. London's skyscrapers float on rafts embedded in the clay. London Clay is highly susceptible to volumetric changes depending upon its moisture content.Buildings on Clay The effects of geology, climate and vegetation on heave and settlement, Derek Clarke and Joel Smethurst During exceptionally dry periods or where the moisture is extracted by tree root activity, the clay can become desiccated and shrink in volume, and conversely swell again when the moisture content is restored. This can lead to many problems near the ground surface, including structural movement and fracturing of buildings, fractured sewers and service pipes/ducts and uneven and damaged road surfaces and pavings. Such damage is recognised to be covered by the interpretation of subsidence in buildings insurance policies, and the periods of dry weather in 1976/77 and 1988/92, in particular, led to a host of insurance claims. As a result, many insurance companies have now increased the cost of premiums for buildings located in the most susceptible areas where damage occurred, where the clay is close to the surface. London clay is also used to line a quarry that has finished. This is because old quarry holes are generally refilled with waste material and by lining it with London clay (which is virtually impermeable) it prevents waste and hazardous material and substances from entering the groundwater. =Tunnels in London Clay= London Clay is an ideal medium for driving tunnels, which is why the London Underground railway network expanded quickly north of the River Thames, but south of the Thames the stratum at tube level is water-bearing sand and gravel (not good for tunnelling) with London Clay below, which is why there are few tube tunnels there. London Clay has a stand-up time long enough to enable support to be installed without urgency. It is also almost waterproof, resulting in virtually no seepage of groundwater into the tunnel. It is over-consolidated, which means that it is under pressure, and expands upon excavation, thus gradually loading the support, i.e. it is not necessary to stress the support against the ground. Uses Due to its impermeability especially when exposed by ploughing, London clay does not make good agricultural soil. In Middlesex, ploughing London Clay land so deep that it brings up clay has historically been called \\"ploughing up poison\\".View of the Agriculture of Middlesex: With Observations on the Means of Its Improvement, and Several Essays on Agriculture in General. By Board of Agriculture (Great Britain), John Middleton. Published by G. and W. Nicol, second edition, 1807, p. 20. It was also disliked for building houses on, though inevitably most of Greater London is built on it. Jane Ellen Panton in her Suburban Residences and How To Circumvent Them (1896), remarks: \\"I do not believe clay is or even can be fit for anyone to reside upon ... though roses flourished magnificently children didn't, and coughs and colds [lasted through autumn and winter, this at Shortlands]\\".Quoted in Aslet, Clive and Powers, Alan, The National Trust book of the English House, p. 174, Penguin/Viking, 1985, Many London buildings have ultimately been constructed with London clay. When burnt and compressed, London clay can be fashioned into brick known as London stock, identifiable by its yellowish brown hue. Fossil flora and fauna Plant fossils, especially seeds and fruits, are found in abundance and have been collected from the London Clay for almost 300 years.Chandler, M. E. J. 1961. The lower Tertiary floras of southern England I. Palaeocene floras, London Clay flora. London: British Museum (Natural History). Some 350 named species of plant have been found, making the London Clay flora one of the world's most diverse for fossil seeds and fruits. The flora includes plant types found today in tropical forests of Asia and demonstrates the much warmer climate of the Eocene epoch, with plants such as Nypa (Nipah palms) and other palms being frequently encountered. Notable coastal exposures from which fossils can be collected are on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent and Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex, in the London Basin, and Bognor Regis in the Hampshire Basin.

Osedax is Latin for \\"bone- eating\\". The name alludes to how the worms bore into the bones of whale carcasses to reach enclosed lipids, on which they rely for sustenance. Scientists from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute using the submarine ROV Tiburon first discovered the genus in Monterey Bay, California, in February 2002. The worms were found living on the bones of a decaying gray whale in the Monterey Canyon, at a depth of . Anatomy and physiology Lacking stomach and mouth, Osedax rely on symbiotic species of bacteria that aid in the digestion of whale proteins and lipids and release nutrients that the worms can absorb. Osedax have colorful feathery plumes that act as gills and unusual root-like structures that absorb nutrients. The Osedax secrete acid (rather than rely on teeth) to bore into bone to access the nutrients. Between 50 and 100 microscopic dwarf males live inside the tube surrounding a single female and never develop past the larval stage. Reproduction Female Osedax worms have been observed spawning both in the wild and in laboratory aquaria (Rouse et al., 2009). Osedax rubiplumus can spawn hundreds of oocytes at a time. They are already fertilized when they're released from the female worm. The worms' endosymbionts, species of bacteria in the order Oceanospirillales, were not observed in the spawned oocytes, which suggests that they are acquired after the worms settle on the bones. In the adult, the bacteria are localised in the root-like structures that grow into the whale bone.Piper, Ross (2007), Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, Greenwood Press. This worm appears to be highly fecund and reproduces continuously. This may help explain why Osedax is such a diverse genus, despite the rarity of whale falls in the ocean. Male Osedax are microscopic dwarfs that live as \\"harems\\" inside the lumen of the gelatinous tube that surrounds each female. An individual female can house hundreds of these males in her tube. Following its discovery in 2002 by researchers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, the genus was announced in Science in 2004. In late 2005, an experiment by Swedish marine biologists resulted in the discovery of a species of the worm in the North Sea off the west coast of Sweden. In the experiment, a minke whale carcass that had been washed ashore had been sunk to a depth of and monitored for several months. Biologists were surprised to find that, unlike the previous discoveries, the new species, colloquially known as \\"bone-eating snot flower\\" after its scientific name (Osedax mucofloris), lived in relatively shallow waters. In November 2009, researchers reported finding as many as 15 species of boneworms living in Monterey Bay on the California coast. Niche Osedax frankpressi The role of Osedax in the degradation of marine vertebrate remains controversial. Some scientistsGlover et al. 2005; Dahlgren et al. 2006; Fujijura et al. 2006 think that Osedax is a specialist on whalebones while others think that it is more of a generalist.Jones et al. 2008 This controversy is due to a biogeographic paradox: despite the rarity and ephemeral nature of whale falls, Osedax has a broad biogeographic range and is surprisingly diverse. One hypothesis advanced to explain this paradox is that Osedax are able to colonize a variety of vertebrate remains besides whalebones. This hypothesis is supported by an experiment involving cow bones suspended above the sea floor. A variety of Osedax species successfully colonized these bones. Osedax have also been observed colonizing terrestrial mammal bones mixed in with galley waste from a surface vessel. Other scientists have countered this hypothesis by pointing out how the cow bone experiment does not match any natural habitat and also the low probability of terrestrial mammal bones arriving at the ocean floor in significant quantities. They also point out other cases of food falls in which the remains disappeared too swiftly for Osedax colonization and the lack of any observed colonization in similar cases. The true role of Osedax in the degradation of marine vertebrate remains is important to marine vertebrate taphonomy. Burrows closely similar to those made by Osedax species have been found in the bones of ancient marine birds and plesiosaurs, suggesting that the genus may once have had a wider range of foods.

Part of a musical family, De Lory has been performing since a young age. Her voice can be heard on albums by Carly Simon, Ray Parker Jr., Kim Carnes, Santana, Martika, Laura Branigan, Belinda Carlisle, Selena, Bette Midler, Barry Manilow, Myl√®ne Farmer, Alisha and Madonna. De Lory accompanied Madonna as backing vocalist and dancer on every concert from the Who's That Girl Tour in 1987, up to the Confessions Tour in 2006. Her performance with Madonna at the Live Earth 2007 concert in London was their final professional collaboration to date. Early life Donna De Lory was born on 10 September 1964 in Calabasas, California to record producer/musician Al De Lory and Mary Helyn Soncini. De Lory has been surrounded by music ever since she was born. The De Lory family is very musical and is well known in the music industry. Her father played piano, electronic organ, and harpsichord on The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds album. He was a producer at Capitol Records and was responsible, among other things, for producing Glen Campbell's '\\"golden era\\". In addition, he co-wrote the 1960 Billboard Hot 100 #1 novelty hit for Larry Verne, Mr. Custer. Her grandfather played upright bass and cello for the Warner Bros. Studios Orchestra, recording the scores of classic movies such as Casablanca and Gone with the Wind. Her mother was a singer and dancer. Donna's older brother Alan, known as A.D. DeLory, is also a singer and songwriter. De Lory's late older sister Jolene sang background vocals on the 1973 Carpenters single \\"Sing\\". De Lory made her professional singing debut at age eight singing a Recipe dog food commercial. She sang on children's albums for Walt Disney and was heard on the tune \\"It's a Small World\\", featured on a ride at Disneyland and Disney World. She also sang on commercials for McDonald's, Mattel, and Eastman Kodak. In addition, she contributed vocals to projects by Kim Carnes, Barry Manilow, Santana and the Rocky II soundtrack. She moved to Nashville with her father and brother at the age of 16 following the death of her mother from breast cancer in 1980. Her father found a professional home in Nashville's Music Row area as a producer for Capitol Records. She started working at a vegetarian restaurant and from there, became a vegetarian. De Lory made friends with a few songwriters and became inspired by seeing how much effort they put into their work. She started spending a lot of her time on writing songs and recording demos before going back to California after finishing Hillsboro High School to study dancing, singing and acting. Career =Madonna= De Lory first came to the public's attention as Madonna's backup singer. In 1985, Gardner Cole, then De Lory's boyfriend, wrote the song \\"Open Your Heart\\" which Madonna would later record. At the time Madonna's management was looking for material for her True Blue album, and Cole submitted three songs, including \\"Open Your Heart\\". Madonna's manager heard the song and thought it would be a hit for Madonna, so he asked Cole to re-record the song with a female voice. De Lory recorded the song, and Cole then submitted the recording to Madonna's producer Patrick Leonard. Madonna listened to the recording and decided to record the song. Leonard liked De Lory's voice and hired her to sing backup on future projects he produced. When Madonna was looking for backup singers for her 1987 Who's That Girl Tour, De Lory asked Leonard to take her to the auditions. De Lory got the job and toured with Madonna on all her world tours until 2007. De Lory also sang backup on many of Madonna's songs. =Solo career= In 1990, she recorded the song \\"Always Thinking of You\\" for the film Three Men and a Little Lady. Her self-titled debut album was released on MCA Records in late 1992. The first single off the album, \\"Praying For Love\\", was released 20 October 1992 and went to #1 on the charts in Japan. The second single, \\"Just A Dream\\", was released 9 March 1993 and was a top 10 hit on the Hot Dance Club Play chart. It peaked at #71 in the UK Singles Chart in July 1993. \\"Just A Dream\\" was written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard and was originally recorded by Madonna for her 1989 Like a Prayer album. De Lory's version incorporated backing vocals by Madonna. The third and final single off the album, \\"Think It Over\\", was released 27 July 1993. She recorded a second album titled Songs '95 and had plans to release it in 1995, but it remained unreleased until 2002. She left the MCA label in late 1994 because her growing interest in world music was starting to show in her own music, much to the dismay of her label who wanted her to keep making pop music.http://www.donnadelory.com/press_media/copy/articles/DonnaWholeLifeMag.pdf At around this time she was introduced to the Harmonium, an instrument she has been using ever since. She was given the instrument at a party and she learned to play it by herself.http://stuffboston.com/2010/04/30/donna-de-lory-music- meditation-and-life-with-madonna She toured France as a backup singer and dancer for Myl√®ne Farmer in 1996 and appears on the live CD/DVD Live √† Bercy. She formed the band Bliss together with cellist Cameron Stone in 1997, whom she was introduced to at the recommendation of her drummer, and released the album Love Never Dies. However, they decided to rename the album to Bliss and bill it to De Lory's name because there already were too many other bands with Bliss in their name and De Lory already had name recognition from her first album and her work with Madonna. The second version of the album billed to Donna's name included new album artwork and the song \\"Where I've Never Been\\" which was not on the first version. The name Bliss came from the saying \\"follow your bliss\\" which is from one of Donna's favorite authors, Joseph Campbell. De Lory and Stone built a fully equipped 24-track digital studio in her garage, then packed it up and took it in a U-Haul to a cabin in Taos, New Mexico, where most of the material for the album was created. They spent most of 1997 working on the album and finished it by the end of the year. The album was released in early 1998. Cameron Stone also worked on all of her subsequent albums, such as the 2003 album In The Glow. De Lory's 2004 album, The Lover & The Beloved, was a Sanskrit and English CD released on the Ajna Music label. De Lory performed Elise's theme, \\"My Destiny\\", in the 2006 game Sonic the Hedgehog. Her reinterpretation of Joseph Arthur's, In the Sun was featured at the end of episode 5 of NBC's drama Life. Her version of Madonna's song \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" appeared in the 2010 film, The Switch. In 2010, De Lory contributed the song \\"Bathe in These Waters\\" to the Yoga Revolution compilation album, a benefit release supporting yoga and fitness programs for underserved schools.http://www.donnadelory.com/press_media/copy/press_releases/YogaRevolution.pdf In 2013, De Lory announced via her Twitter account that she would be releasing a new album titled The Unchanging. It was released worldwide on iTunes on 27 August 2013https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-unchanging/id680990656 and made #2 on the World Music Album chart. De Lory combines her melodic vocals and world music influences, but predominantly sings in English. Her former singing partner Niki Haris also features on the track \\"Kinder\\" along with Tina Malia. The album also includes a reinterpretation of her single \\"Praying for Love\\" and her take on \\"Amazing Grace\\". In 2016, De Lory teamed up with Haris to record a cover version of Madonna's 1993 single \\"Rain\\", to which they originally had sung backing vocals.

It lies approximately north of Virgin Gorda. Anegada is the only inhabited British Virgin Island formed from coral and limestone,Arguably Saba Rock, with a part- time hotel on it, is also inhabited. The only other significant coral and limestone island in the Territory is Sandy Spit. rather than being of volcanic origin. While the other islands are mountainous, Anegada is flat and low. Its highest point is only about above sea level, earning it its name, which is the Spanish term for the flooded land, \\"tierra anegada\\".\\"Anegada, a world apart\\" BVI Tourist Board website. Accessed: December 11, 2014 At about 15 square miles (38 square kilometers), Anegada is the second largest of the British Virgin Islands, but it is also the most sparsely populated of the main islands, with a population of 285 as at the 2010 Census.The BVI Beacon \\"Portrait of a population: 2010 Census published\\" pg. 4, 20 November 2014 Most of the population on Anegada live in the only village, The Settlement. From 2008 to 2013 Anegada was home to one of the tallest Christmas trees in the Caribbean and had an official tree lighting ceremony and party each year. https://www.mainstayinsurance.ca/mainlinkimages/Anegadaflyer09.pdf The tree donated by Adrian Johnson was intended to help bring visitors to the island and provided a flotilla destination for many sailors. Economy Horseshoe Reef extends southeastward from Anegada The primary business of Anegada is tourism. On a typical day during the tourist season, the island will have an additional 200 or so visitors. Commercial fishing is also a substantial business on Anegada, with local fishermen providing the majority of the fresh fish and lobster catch for the rest of the British Virgin Islands. Its miles of south shore flats have a large population of bonefish, making Anegada a popular destination for fly fishing. Access Access to the island is via the small Auguste George Airport (NGD), thrice-weekly ferries, and private boat. Charter flights run directly to Anegada from Tortola and Virgin Gorda, in the BVI, as well as San Juan, St. Thomas, Antigua and St. Maarten.\\"More on the island of Anegada BYI Tourist Borad website. Accessed: December 11, 2014 Horseshoe Reef Anegada is known for miles of white sand beaches and the -long Horseshoe Reef, one of the largest barrier coral reefs in the Caribbean. The reef makes navigation to Anegada difficult. While charter boats freely sail among most of the other Virgin Islands, charter companies often forbid clients to sail to Anegada to avoid running aground on the reef. The reef has caused hundreds of shipwrecks, including HMS Astraea in 1808, the Donna Paula (1819), and the MS Rocus (1929)Better known as the \\"Bone Wreck\\" As such, it was once an important scuba diving destination. In an effort to protect the reef, the BVI government has made anchoring on Horseshoe Reef illegal. Fauna Anegada is also known for the large salt ponds that cover much of the west end of the island, These ponds, which support unique fauna, were designated a Ramsar Site on 11 May 1999. In the 1830s, thousands of Caribbean flamingos lived in these ponds, but they were hunted for food and feathers throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries and disappeared by 1950. They have been reestablished. As of 2016, the flamingo flock numbers approximately 200 birds. The birds are another tourist draw, but officials are trying to keep the number of visitors to the flamingo areas at a level that allows the birds to flourish. Other rare or endangered animals include the Anegada rock iguana (Cyclura pinguis) and several species of turtles. Conch, Caribbean lobster (Metanephrops binghami), and many species of fishes can be found near Anegada, particularly in the deep waters off the North Drop to the north of the island. The Ft. Worth Zoo now maintains an Anegada Rock \\"Headstart\\" facility in the Settlement. Newly hatched iguanas are caught in the wild, brought to the facility, and raised until they are large enough to be able to defend themselves against the feral cats that are their only predator on Anegada. As of 2016, over 200 iguanas have been released from the headstart program back into the wild. In addition, an annual Iguana Festival is held outside the Iguana Headstart Facility to celebrate the island's native species. The reef adjacent to the Settlement was once one of the more fertile conch grounds in the Caribbean, but overfishing has wiped out the conch population there. Visitors to the settlement are greeted by the sight of mountains of empty conch shells on the shore when they arrive. There are also populations of feral cattle, donkeys, goats, cows, and sheep that live in all areas of the island. Hurricanes Anegadians traditionally endured hurricanes by tying their dories to the trunks of mangroves with rope and covering with a tarp. Today, given sufficient warning, few leave the island and go to Tortola until after the storm passes. On August 30, 2010, the eye of Hurricane Earl passed just 15 to 20 miles north of Anegada at category 4, with winds in excess of 135 mph. The close passage led to significant damage on the island, with major flooding on the south side from the storm surge and breaking waves. The north side of the island experienced no storm surge, and Horseshoe Reef protected the north side of the island from breaking waves. 24 hours before the storm arrived, the forecast was for the storm to pass well to the north. By the time that it was apparent that the hurricane was going to have a major impact, all transportation service from Anegada (air and ferry) had been suspended. There were no reported serious injuries to anyone on the island. Education Approximately 70 students attend school at the Claudia Creque Educational Centre, formerly Anegada Primary and Secondary School. This self-contained school is the only school on Anegada and handles pre-school, primary, and secondary levels. It is funded and operated by the British Virgin Islands government.

One of the early American abolitionists, Benezet founded one of the world's first anti-slavery societies, the Society for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage (after his death it was revived as the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery); the first public school for girls in North America; and the Negro School at Philadelphia, which operated into the nineteenth century. He was a vegetarian and advocated for the kind treatment of animals; integrating this in his teachings. Biography Antoine was born in Saint-Quentin, France, on 31 January 1713, to Jean-√âtienne de B√©n√©zet (later known as John Stephen Benezet) and his wife Judith de la M√©janelle, french Protestants or Huguenots. The Protestants had been persecuted and suffered violent attacks since the Crown's revocation in 1685 of the Edict of Nantes, which had provided religious tolerance. For a while his family had received protection owing to their powerful connections. However in 1715 his father's goods were seized, like so many others, decided to leave France rather than give up their religion. They moved first to Rotterdam, Netherlands; then briefly to Greenwich before settling in London, England, where there was a sizeable Huguenot refugee community. In 1727 Benezet joined the Religious Society of Friends (also known as Quakers). In 1731 the Benezet family migrated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, founded by Quakers and one of the English colonies of North America. Then 18 years old, Anthony Benezet joined John Woolman as one of the earliest American abolitionists. Like Woolman, Benezet also advocated war tax resistance.Gross, David M. American Quaker War Tax Resistance (2008) pp. 95-96, 174, 178-9 In Philadelphia, Benezet worked to persuade his Quaker brethren that slave-owning was not consistent with Christian doctrine. He believed that the English ban on slavery in the British Isles should be extended to the North American and Caribbean colonies. (After the Americans gained independence in the Revolutionary War, Benezet continued to urge the United States to ban slavery, and the state of Pennsylvania legislated slavery's gradual abolition in 1780.) After several years as a failed merchant, in 1739 Benezet began teaching at a Germantown school, then a separate jurisdiction northwest of Philadelphia. In 1742, he moved to the Friends' English School of Philadelphia (now the William Penn Charter School). In 1750 he added night classes for black slaves to his schedule. In 1755, Benezet left the Friends' English School to set up his own school, the first public girls' school on the American continent. His students included daughters from prominent families, such as Deborah Norris and Sally Wister.Vaux (ed), Benezet, 1817, p. 15 In 1770, he founded the Negro School at Philadelphia for black children. There was a growing free black community in Philadelphia, which increased after the state abolished slavery. Abolitionist sympathizers, such as Abigail Hopper Gibbons, continued to teach at Benezet's Negro School in the years before the American Civil War. In 1775, he helped found the first anti-slavery society, the Society for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage. After Benezet's death, Benjamin Franklin and Dr. Benjamin Rush reconstituted this association as the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery.

Deoxycholic acid is one of the secondary bile acids, which are metabolic byproducts of intestinal bacteria. The two primary bile acids secreted by the liver are cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. Bacteria metabolize chenodeoxycholic acid into the secondary bile acid lithocholic acid, and they metabolize cholic acid into deoxycholic acid. There are additional secondary bile acids, such as ursodeoxycholic acid. Deoxycholic acid is soluble in alcohol and acetic acid. When pure, it comes in a white to off-white crystalline powder form. Applications Deoxycholic acid has been used since its discovery in various fields of human medicine. In the human body deoxycholic acid is used in the emulsification of fats for absorption in the intestine. It has, in some countries (including Switzerland) been licensed as an emulsifier in food industry,Streuli, H. et al. (1992) SLMB ‚Äì Schweizer Lebensmittelbuch, chapter 58, 4/3 but it is no longer common. Outside the body it is used in experimental basis of cholagogues and is also in use to prevent and dissolve gallstones. In research deoxycholic acid is used as a mild detergent for the isolation of membrane associated proteins. The critical micelle concentration for deoxycholic acid is approximately 2.4‚Äì4 mM.Neugebauer, J.M. (1990) \\"Detergents: An Overview\\" in M.P. Deutscher, Guide to Protein Purification (Methods in Enzymology Vol. 182), Academic Press, San Diego Sodium deoxycholate, the sodium salt of deoxycholic acid, is often used as a biological detergent to lyse cells and solubilise cellular and membrane components.Sodium deoxycholate. nzp.co.nz Sodium deoxycholate mixed with phosphatidylcholine, is used in mesotherapy injections to produce lipolysis, and has been used as an alternative to surgical excision in the treatment of lipomas. Deoxycholates and bile acid derivatives in general are actively being studied as structures for incorporation in nanotechnology. They also have found application in microlithography as photoresistant components. In the United States, deoxycholic acid, under the trade name Kybella, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for reducing moderate-to-severe fat below the chin. When injected into submental fat, deoxycholic acid helps destroy fat cells. Kybella is produced by Kythera Biopharmaceuticals.  Research in immunology  Its function as a detergent and isolating agent for membrane proteins also suits it for production of outer membrane protein (OMP) vaccines such as MenB, a Norwegian vaccine developed in the early 1990s. The MeNZB vaccine was produced using the same method.MeNZB‚Ñ¢ ‚Äì Use science not opinion!. scoop.co.nz (10 June 2005) Deoxycholic acid binds and activates the membrane enzyme NAPE-PLD, which catalyzes the release of the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide and other N-acylethanolamines. These bioactive signaling molecules play important roles in several physiological pathways including stress and pain response, appetite, and lifespan. Some publications point towards the effect of deoxycholic acid as an immunostimulantVlƒçek B.: Potentiation of the immune response with DCA (Czech), Prakt.Lekar 52, 326‚Äì30 (1972)Chyle M., Chyle P.: Regulation of the immune response with DCA (Czech, engl. summary), Sbornik lek. 84, 212‚Äì18 (1982) of the innate immune system, activating its main actors, the macrophages. According to these publications, a sufficient amount of deoxycholic acid in the human body would correspond with a good immune reaction of the non-specific immune system. Clinical studies conducted in the 1970s and 1980s confirm the expectation that deoxycholic acid is involved in the natural healing processes of local inflammations,Vlƒçek B.

Research in cancer Colonic epithelium from a mouse not undergoing colonic tumorigenesis (A), and a mouse that is undergoing colonic tumorigenesis (B). Cell nuclei are stained dark blue with hematoxylin (for nucleic acid) and immunostained brown for 8-oxo-dG. The level of 8-oxo-dG was graded in the nuclei of colonic crypt cells on a scale of 0‚Äì4. Mice not undergoing tumorigenesis had crypt 8-oxo-dG at levels 0 to 2 (panel A shows level 1) while mice progressing to colonic tumors had 8-oxo-dG in colonic crypts at levels 3 to 4 (panel B shows level 4) Tumorigenesis was induced by adding deoxycholate to the mouse diet to give a level of deoxycholate in the mouse colon similar to the level in the colon of humans on a high fat diet. The images were made from original photomicrographs. Deoxycholate and other secondary bile acids cause DNA damage. Secondary bile acids increase intracellular production of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species resulting in increased oxidative stress and DNA damage. As shown in the figure in this section, deoxycholate added to the diet of mice increased the level of 8-oxo-dG, an oxidative DNA damage, in the colonic epithelium of mice. When the level of deoxycholate-induced DNA damage is high, DNA repair enzymes that ordinarily reverse DNA damage may not be able to keep up. DNA damage has frequently been proposed as a major cause of cancer. DNA damage can give rise to cancer by causing mutations. When deoxycholate was added to the food of mice so that their feces contained deoxycholate at about the same level present in feces of human on a high fat diet, 45% to 56% of the mice developed colon cancer over the next 10 months. Thus, exposure of the colon to deoxycholate may cause cancer in mice. In humans, higher levels of colonic deoxycholate are associated with higher frequencies of colon cancer. As an example, the fecal deoxycholate concentrations in African Americans (who eat a relatively high fat diet) is more than five times higher than fecal deoxycholate of Native Africans in South Africa (who eat a low fat diet). Male African Americans have a high incidence of colon cancer of 72 per 100,000,American Cancer Society. Cancer Facts and Figures 2009. while Native Africans in South Africa have a low incidence rate of colon cancer of less than 1 per 100,000, a more than 72-fold difference in rates of colon cancer. Factors affecting deoxycholate levels A number of factors, including diet, obesity, and exercise, affect the level of deoxycholate in the human colon. When humans were switched from their usual diet to a meat, egg and cheese based diet for five days, deoxycholate in their feces increased by factors of 2 to 10 fold. Rats fed diets with 30% beef tallow (high fat) had almost 2-fold more deoxycholate in their feces than rats fed 5% beef tallow (low fat). In the same study, adding the further dietary elements of curcumin or caffeic acid to the rats' high fat (30% beef tallow) diet reduced the deoxycholate in their feces to levels comparable to levels seen in the rats on a low fat diet. Curcumin is a component of the spice turmeric, and caffeic acid is a component high in some fruits and spices. Caffeic acid is also a digestive break-down product of chlorogenic acid, high in coffee and some fruits and vegetables. In addition to fats, the type or amount of protein in the diet may also affect bile acid levels. Switching from a diet with protein provided by casein to a diet with protein provided by salmon protein hydrolysate led to as much as a 6-fold increase in levels of bile acids in the blood plasma of rats. In humans, adding high protein to a high fat diet raised the level of deoxycholate in the plasma by almost 50%. Obesity has been linked to cancer, and this link is in part through deoxycholate. In obese people, the relative proportion of Firmicutes (Gram-positive bacteria) in gut microbiota is increased resulting in greater conversion of the non-genotoxic primary bile acid, cholic acid, to carcinogenic deoxycholate. Exercise decreases deoxycholate in the colon. Humans whose level of physical activity placed them in the top third had a 17% decrease in fecal bile acid concentration compared to those whose level of physical activity placed them in the lowest third. Rats provided with an exercise wheel had a lower ratio of secondary bile acids to primary bile acids than sedentary rats in their feces. There is a positive association of exercise and physical activity with cancer prevention, tolerance to cancer-directed therapies (radiation and chemotherapy), reduction in recurrence, and improvement in survival.

She was the winner of Femina Miss India Universe 1997 and was a finalist in the Miss Universe 1997 pageant in Miami Beach.  Early life  Nafisa Joseph was born on 28 March 1978 in Delhi, and was brought up in Bangalore, Karnataka. She was the younger of two daughters born to father Nirmal Joseph, and mother Usha Joseph, a Bengali, who was a descendant of Tagore. Nafisa studied at Bishop Cotton Girls' School and St. Joseph's College, both at Bangalore. She owed her Islamic first name to the fact that her paternal grandmother may have been Muslim.  Career  Joseph started modelling at age 12 when her neighbour got her an opportunity to model for a Wearhouse ad. She was groomed as a model by Prasad Bidapa. Joseph was the youngest participant at the Miss India pageant in 1997, which she won. Joseph participated in the Miss Universe Pageant in Miami Beach, Florida on 16 May 1997, and was among the 10 semifinalists in the pageant. In 1999, she was a judge for the MTV India VJ Hunt and was also a VJ for MTV. A week later she was called for a screen test to host a show on MTV . She ran the MTV House Full show for close to five years. She also acted in a television series C.A.T.S, an Indian version of Charlie's Angels for Sony Entertainment Television. In 2004, she hosted a show Style on Star World. She also launched a television programming unit 2's Company with the help of her fianc√©, Gautam Khanduja. She edited a magazine called Gurlz. She also had a brief cameo in the Subhash Ghai film Taal. In addition to modeling and hosting duties, Joseph was a lover of animals and campaigned for Welfare of Stray Dogs (WSD), People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and People for Animals (PFA), organizations for animal protection, and wrote a weekly column called Nafisa for Animals in the Bangalore edition of the Times of India.  Death  Joseph hanged herself in her flat in Versova on 29 July 2004. She was to marry businessman Gautam Khanduja in a few weeks' time. According to her parents, Joseph took the step because her marriage was called off. This was due to Joseph having discovered that Khanduja was still married, although having told her he had been divorced for two years. When confronted, Khanduja refused to answer questions about his marital life or produce divorce papers that he had previously claimed he had filed. Instead, press reports at the time mention that he then threatened her with blackmail, probably after she threatened to confront his wife.Goshwami, Kanta. \\"Nafisa Joseph - murder or suicide? The behind the scene real story.\\" India Daily. 30 July 2004. Joseph's parents filed a police report accusing her fianc√© for her death, claiming that Khanduja had been desperate to get out of the wedding for some time, and sought his custodial interrogation. In November 2005, the trial against Khanduja was stayed by the Bombay High Court until January 2006. Khanduja claimed that there was no evidence to prove that breaking off the engagement had led to Joseph's suicide. He pointed out that Joseph's earlier engagements to Sameer Malhotra and Samir Soni had also ended.  Trivia  Nafisa was signed on to play the lead antagonist role of Mallika Seth in Jassi Jaisi Koi Nahin a fictional TV show on Sony Entertainment Television. She even shot for the pilot episode but was later replaced by TV actress and host Rakshanda Khan. This was confirmed by Rakhshanda herself in a social media post.

These names have applied to a part or the whole of the Levant. On occasion, two or more of these names have been used at the same time by different cultures or sects. As a natural result, some of the names of the Levant are highly politically charged. Perhaps the least politicized name is Levant itself, which simply means \\"where the sun rises\\" or \\"where the land rises out of the sea\\", a meaning attributed to the region's easterly location on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.  Antiquity  = Retenu = Ancient Egyptian texts (c. 14th century BC) called the entire coastal area along the Mediterranean Sea between modern Egypt and Turkey r·πØnw (conventionally Re·πØenu). In the Amarna letters, written in Akkadian cuneiform, Re·πØenu is subdivided into five regions: * kn ønw (Kananu) or Canaan proper (Idumea, Judea, Samaria); **p-kn øn (pe-Kanan), city of Gaza; name used in reference to being the administrative centre of Canaan. * ·∏éahy (·∏èÍú£hy;·πÆahi, ·∏éahi), roughly Galilee and coastal plain to Ashkelon dominated by Hazor; * Rmnn, coast of Lebanon; * Amurru, (the Amurru kingdom of the Amorites); * Kharu (·∏•Íú£-rw), the chief city of which was Ugarit.Sir Alan Gardiner, Egypt of the Pharaohs, Clarendon Press, Oxford (1961) 1964 pp.131, 199, 285, n.1. = Canaan = * Akkadian: íÜ≥íÜ†íàæíÑ¥íàæ (Kina·∏´nu) Phoenician: ê§äê§çê§èê§ç (Kn øn) * or ŒßŒΩ·æ∂ (Khana√°n or Khna) * Hebrew :* Israeli :* Tiberian * (K√¶naan) Prior to (and for some time after) the formation of the Israelite/Hebrew identity and polities in the region, the land was referred to natively as Canaan (first attested in Assyrian Akkadian as Kina·∏´nu). Though it was once thought that the Hebrews were foreign settlers in Canaan, the modern consensus of most scholars is that Hebrew identity developed in situ as a direct indigenous evolution of earlier Canaanite tribes; the continuity from Bronze Age Canaanite civilization to Iron Age Israelite/Judean civilization is indeed so seamless that many scholars stress that any dichotomy between the two is essentially arbitrary‚Äîwith culture, language, etc., being indistinguishable during the transition from Bronze Age to Iron Age. The Phoenicians‚Äîalso descended from the Bronze Age Canaanites, and close relatives and neighbors of the Israelites‚Äîlikewise continued to speak a Canaanite language and practice Canaanite religion at their Mediterranean ports, and referred to themselves natively as \\"Canaanites\\", and their land as \\"Canaan\\". = Phoenicia = (Phoin√≠kƒì) * Hebrew :* Israeli (Finiqiyah) :* Tiberian In ancient times, the Greeks called the whole of Canaan Phoin√≠kƒì, literally \\"[land] of the purple[-producing shell]\\". Today, general consensus associates the Phoenician homeland proper with the northwest coastal region of the Levant, centered at Phoenician cities such as Ugarit, Tyre, Sidon, and Byblos. Today, this place is usually equated with modern Lebanon and the coast of modern Syria. Also there is a modern town in Turkey called Finike which is thought to have derived by the Lycians who traded with Phoenicians in ancient times. = Israel and Judea = Israel: *Egyptian: ysr·ªâÍú£r (/iÀêsri…ër/)i-i-z:Z1s*Z1s:r-i- A-r:Z1*T14-A1*B1:Z2 Canaanite: ê§âê§îê§ìê§Äê§ã (j.s.r. î.l) * Ugaritic: êéäêéåêéóêéõêéç (y≈°r æil) * (Israƒìl) * Hebrew :* Israeli (Yisrael) :* Tiberian :* Biblical Hebrew: ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú  Middle Persian: Adƒìr / Adƒìl * (Esrajil) Judea: Akkadian: íÖÄíåëíÅïíÄÄíÄÄ (ia-u2-da-a-a) * (Iudaea) * Hebrew :* Israeli (Yeh√ª·∏èƒÅh) :* Tiberian Hebrew: Yeh√ª·∏èƒÅh * (J√¶hudije / J√¶hudija) The kingdoms of Israel and Judah were Iron Age Semitic nations spanning from Edom to Assyria. Today the modern State of Israel controls much of the former territory of the ancient Israelite/Judean kingdoms. According to the Deuteronomic history in the Bible, the polities of Israel and Judah originally split off from an earlier, united Kingdom of Israel, ruled by illustrious kings such as David and Solomon; though modern archaeology, biblical scholarship, and historians are generally somewhat skeptical of the historicity of the alleged united monarchy of Israel, suggesting instead that the two kingdoms developed separately, with the southern kingdom of Judah probably dependent on the northern kingdom of Israel as a satellite state at first. The term Judaea is used by historians to refer to the Roman province that extended over parts of the former regions of the Hasmonean and Herodian kingdoms. It was named after Herod Archelaus's ethnarchy of Judea of which it was an expansion, the name being derived from the earlier provincial designations Yehud Medinata (Achaemenid) and Yehud (Neo-Babylonian): all ultimately referring to the former Hebrew kingdom of Judah. = Assyria and Syria = During Persian rule of the Near East, the Greeks and Romans came to call the region \\"Syria\\", believed to have been named after Assyria and the Aramaic language they spread over the entire region. However, Herodotus used the combined name \\"Syria Palaistinƒì\\". \\"Greater Syria\\" refers to a larger area that is supported by some nationalists. During the Syrian Wars between the Seleucid dynasty and the Ptolemaic dynasty (274-168 BC), the region was known as Coele-Syria traditionally given the meaning 'hollow' Syria. The later Hellenistic term Koile Syria that appears first in Arrian's Anabasis Alexandri (2.13.7) in AD 145 and has been much discussed, is usually interpreted as a transcription of Aramaic kul, \\"all, the entire\\", identifying all of Syria.M. Sartre, \\"La Syrie creuse n'existe pas\\", in G. L. Gatier, et al. G√©ographie historique au proche- orient (1988:15-40), reviving the explanation offered by A. Schalit (1954), is reported by Robin Lane Fox, Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer (2008, notes p378f): \\"the crux is solved\\". = Palestine = Palestine: (Palaistinƒì) - from ; or perhaps Greek œÄŒ±ŒªŒ±ŒπœÉœÑŒÆœÇ (palaistƒìs, \\"wrestler\\"), in reference to Israel * Hebrew :* Israeli (Palestina), or Israeli (Falastin) :* Tiberian , or Tiberian - from Arabic Filistin * (Felestin) * - same word as Philistia * An early version of the name Palestine was first recorded by the ancient Egyptians as Peleset. Herodotus later called the whole area Syria Palaistinƒì in his Histories (c. 450 BC), and included the entire territory of ancient Israel and Judea (which he noted for the practice of circumcision), not specifically the coastal Philistine territory (whose people notably did not practice circumcision). The Romans applied the term Syria Palaestina to the southern part of the region‚Äîbeginning in AD 135, following the Bar Kokhba revolt‚Äîto complete the disassociation with the former identity of Judaea. The name continued to be used for the province throughout later Byzantine and Islamic rule. ‚Ä†As a side note, Standard Hebrew has two names for Palestine, both of which are different from the Hebrew name for ancient Philistia. The first name Palestina was used by Hebrew speakers in the British Mandate of Palestine; it is spelled like the name for Philistia but with three more letters added to the end and a Latin pronunciation given. The second name Falastin is a direct loan from the Arabic form, and is used today specifically to refer to the modern Palestinians and to political aspirations for a Palestinian state. = Philistia = Philistia: * Canaanite: ê§êê§ãê§îê§ï (p.l. É.t) * Hebrew :* Israeli (Pleshet) :* Tiberian * - from Greek = Eber-Nari and Transeuphratia = Eber-Nari was the name of a satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire which roughly corresponded with the southern Levant. It means \\"Beyond the River\\" or \\"Across the River\\" in both Akkadian and Aramaic (that is, the western side of the Euphrates from a Mesopotamian and Persian viewpoint). It is also sometimes referred to as Transeuphratia (French Transeuphrat√®ne) by modern scholars.  Medieval and modern history  = Ash-Shaam = The name Ash-ShƒÅm () comes from an Arabic root meaning \\"left\\" or \\"north\\" -- became the name of the Levant (Byzantine Syria) after the Islamic conquest.Article \\"AL- SHƒÄM\\" by C.E. Bosworth, Encyclopaedia of Islam, Volume 9 (1997), page 261. See also Name of Syria. In ancient times, Baalshamin or Ba'al ≈†amem (), was a Semitic sky-god in Canaan/Phoenicia and ancient Palmyra. Hence, Sham refers to heaven or sky. = Levant = Medieval Italians called the region Levante after its easterly location where the sun \\"rises\\"; this term was adopted from Italian and French into many other languages. = Outremer = Frankish Crusaders called the Levant Outremer in French, which means \\"overseas.\\" In France, this general term was colloquially applied more specifically to the Levant because of heavy Frankish involvement in the Crusades and the foundation of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem and other Latin settlements scattered throughout the area. = Eastern Mediterranean = Eastern Mediterranean is a term that denotes the lands or states geographically in the eastern, to the east of, or around the east of the Mediterranean Sea, or with cultural affinities to this region. The Eastern Mediterranean includes Cyprus, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and Jordan.Lands Of The Eastern Mediterranean Map By National Geographic The Eastern Mediterranean in the Late Bronze Age The Eastern Mediterranean 1600-1200 BC Eastern Mediterranean By National Geographic Countries Surrounding the Eastern Mediterranean Sea The term Mediterranean derives from the Latin word mediterraneus, meaning \\"in the middle of earth\\" or \\"between lands\\" (medius, \\"middle, between\\" + terra, \\"land, earth\\"). This is on account of the sea's intermediary position between the continents of Africa and Europe.entry ŒºŒµœÉœåŒ≥Œ±ŒπŒøœÇ at Liddell & Scott = Holy Land = In different languages: * (Al-Ar·∏ç al-Muqaddasah in the Islamic holy book, the Quran) * (Hagioi Topoi, modern ), literally: \\"Holy Places\\") * Hebrew :* Israeli (Erets ha-Kodesh) :* Tiberian The Holy Land is a term used in Abrahamic tradition to refer to sacred sites of the Levant -- such as Shiloh, Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Nazareth -- but is also often used to refer to the Levant (and historical Canaan) as a whole.

The school was founded in 1954 by the Archdiocese of Seattle, and named for the first bishop of the diocese, A.M.A. Blanchet (1797‚Äì1887). Originally named Blanchet High School, in 1999 the title Bishop was added to make the school easily identified as Catholic. Bishop Blanchet has an enrollment of approximately 850 students, 80% of whom are Catholic. The school employs 73 teachers, 69 of them full-time. Most students come from Archdiocesan elementary and middle schools. Academics Approximately 50% of students attend Honors or Advanced Placement classes. To graduate, a student must have 52 credits. This school does not offer a Running Start program. According to the Blanchet Admissions Office, approximately 99% of Bishop Blanchet graduates continue on to higher education.  History  The school was founded in February of 1954, and opened in 1955. The school underwent minor renovations in 2002 and 2013.  Extracurricular activities  Blanchet has a range of sports, clubs, and activities. Most students at Blanchet partake in some kind of extracurricular activity. Several student retreats are offered, including a four-day Kairos retreat. =The Miter = Bishop Blanchet's student newspaper, The Miter, is published every month during the school year. Articles are published on the newspaper's website. (school newspaper) = Athletics = Blanchet has 36 teams in 17 interscholastic sports, and as of March 2016 had won 164 League Championships. Sports played include cross country, football, basketball, track, soccer, swimming, lacrosse, baseball, bowling, and ping pong. Athletic scholarship scandal In 2015, the Bishop Blanchet athletics program was investigated by the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association for self-reported violations to the association's recruiting policies. The head coach of the Blanchet football team had set up a scholarship program funded by the school to provide scholarships to Blanchet athletes to stay at the school, even if they did not qualify for normal scholarships or financial aid. As part of the WIAA's sanctions against the school, the school's girls' basketball and football teams' records in several previous seasons were expunged and the school's athletic program was put on a two-year probation, and the head football coach was fired. = Arts = Band, choir, drama and visual arts courses are available for students. The Drama department has a \\"black box\\" theater in the school where the fall play, one acts, improv, classes and rehearsals take place.

He was best known for his local and network children's television show Lunch with Soupy Sales (1953‚Äì1966), a series of comedy sketches frequently ending with Sales receiving a pie in the face, which became his trademark. From 1968 to 1975 he was a regular panelist on the syndicated revival of What's My Line? and appeared on several other TV game shows. During the 1980s, Sales hosted his own show on WNBC-AM in New York City. Early life and career Milton Supman was born in Franklinton, North Carolina, to Irving Supman and Sadie Berman. His father, a Jewish dry goods merchant, had emigrated from Hungary in 1894. His was the only Jewish family in the town; Sales joked that local Ku Klux Klan members bought the sheets used for their robes from his father's store.Carlson, Michael. (October 31, 2009). \\"Soupy Sales: Anarchic and pioneering children's TV personality\\", The Independent; accessed October 22, 2018. Sales got his nickname from his family. His older brothers had been nicknamed \\"Ham Bone\\" and \\"Chicken Bone.\\" Milton was dubbed \\"Soup Bone,\\" which was later shortened to \\"Soupy\\". When he became a disc jockey, he began using the stage name Soupy Hines. After he became established, it was decided that \\"Hines\\" was too close to the Heinz soup company, so he chose Sales, in part after vaudeville comedian Chic Sale. He graduated from Huntington High School in Huntington, West Virginia in 1944. He enlisted in the United States Navy and served on the in the South Pacific during the latter part of World War II. He sometimes entertained his shipmates by telling jokes and playing crazy characters over the ship's public address system. One of the characters he created was \\"White Fang\\", a large dog that played outrageous practical jokes on the seamen. The sounds for \\"White Fang\\" came from a recording of The Hound of the Baskervilles. Sales enrolled at Marshall College, where he earned a master's degree in journalism. While at Marshall, he performed in nightclubs as a comedian, singer and dancer. After graduating, Sales began working as a scriptwriter and disc jockey at radio station WHTN (now WVHU) in Huntington. He moved to Cincinnati, Ohio in 1949, where he worked as a morning radio DJ and performed in nightclubs. Sales began his television career on WKRC-TV in Cincinnati with Soupy's Soda Shop, TV's first teen dance program, and Club Nothing!, a late-night comedy/variety program. Lunch with Soupy Sales Sales is best known for his daily children's television show, Lunch with Soupy Sales. The show was originally called 12 O'Clock Comics, and was later known as The Soupy Sales Show. Improvised and slapstick in nature, Lunch with Soupy Sales was a rapid-fire stream of comedy sketches, gags, and puns, almost all of which resulted in Sales receiving a pie in the face, which became his trademark. Sales developed pie-throwing into an art form: straight to the face, on top of the head, a pie to both ears from behind, moving into a stationary pie, and countless other variations. He claimed that he and his visitors had been hit by more than 20,000 pies during his career. He recounted a time when a young fan mistakenly threw a frozen pie at his neck and he \\"dropped like a pile of bricks.\\" =History of the show= Detroit A hand puppet featuring a likeness of Sales Lunch with Soupy Sales began in 1953 from the studios of WXYZ-TV, Channel 7, located in the historic Maccabees Building, in Detroit. Sales occasionally took the studio cameras to the lawn of the Detroit Public Library, located across the street from the TV studios, and talked with local students walking to and from school. Beginning no later than July 4, 1955, a Saturday version of Sales' lunch show was broadcast nationally on the ABC television network. His lunchtime program on weekdays was moved to early morning opposite Today and Captain Kangaroo. During the same period that Lunch with Soupy Sales aired in Detroit, Sales also hosted a nighttime show, Soup's On, to compete with 11 O'Clock News programs. The guest star was always a musician, often a jazz performer, at a time when jazz was popular in Detroit and the city was home to twenty-four jazz clubs. Sales believed that his show helped sustain jazz in Detroit, as artists would regularly sell out their nightclub shows after appearing on Soup's On. Coleman Hawkins, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, Charlie Parker, and Stan Getz were among the musicians who appeared on the show; Miles Davis made six appearances. Clifford Brown's appearance on Soup's On, according to Sales, may be the only extant footage of Brown, and has been included in Ken Burns' Jazz and an A&E; Network biography about Sales. Sales briefly had a third dinner time show filmed largely in the Palmer Park section of Detroit. Sales' three shows were rumored to have earned him in excess of $100,000 per year. One of his character puppets was Willy the Worm, a \\"balloon\\" propelled worm that emerged from its house and used a high pitched voice to announce birthdays or special events on the noontime show; but the character never appeared when Soupy moved to Los Angeles. In his lunchtime show, Sales always wore an orlon fabric sweater. In many of his shows, he appeared in costume, performed his dance, the Soupy Shuffle, introduced many characters such as Nicky Nooney, the Mississippi Gambler, etc., and took \\"zillions\\" of pies in the face. Los Angeles In 1960, Sales moved to the ABC-TV Studios in Los Angeles. ABC-TV cancelled the show in March 1961, but it continued as a local program on KABC- TV until January 1962. The show briefly went back on the ABC network as a late night fill-in for The Steve Allen Show in 1962 but was canceled after three months. All of the puppets on the show during its Los Angeles run were also operated by Clyde Adler. A 1962 TV Guide listing refers to him as \\"West Coast disk jockey and comedian\\". His fame was significant enough to warrant utilizing him as a \\"Tonight\\" show guest-host in the period between Jack Paar and Johnny Carson. New York As Sales' guest, Frank Sinatra was no more immune to a pie in the face than his host. On September 7, 1964, Sales found a new weekday home at WNEW-TV in New York City. This version was seen locally until September 2, 1966. Screen Gems syndicated 260 episodes to local stations outside the New York market during the 1965‚Äì66 season. This show marked the height of Sales' popularity. It featured guest appearances by stars such as Frank Sinatra, Tony Curtis, Jerry Lewis, Judy Garland and Sammy Davis Jr., as well as musical groups like the Shangri-Las, The Supremes and The Temptations. =The New Soupy Sales Show: Los Angeles= The New Soupy Sales Show appeared in 1978 with the same format, and ran for one season. 65 episodes were briefly syndicated, through Air Time International, to local stations in early 1979. It was taped in Los Angeles at KTLA, with Clyde Adler returning to work as a puppeteer with Sales. =Characters on the show= Sales with White Fang in 1957 Clyde Adler, the show's floor manager and a film editor at Detroit's WXYZ-TV, performed in sketches and voiced and operated all puppets on Sales' show in Detroit in the 1950s and in Los Angeles from 1959 to 1962, as well as in 1978. Actor Frank Nastasi, who played the part of Gramps on WXYZ-TV's other kids show \\"Wixie Wonderland\\", assumed the role of straight man and puppeteer when Sales took the show to New York from 1964 to 1966. Nastasi was originally from Detroit and had worked with Sales at WXYZ. Appearing on the show were both puppets and live performers. The puppets were: * White Fang, \\"The Biggest and Meanest Dog in the USA\\", who appeared only as a giant white shaggy paw with black triangular felt \\"claws\\", jutting out from the corner of the screen. Fang spoke with unintelligible short grunts and growls, which Soupy repeated back in English, for comic effect. White Fang was often the pie thrower when Soupy's jokes bombed. * Black Tooth, \\"The Biggest and Sweetest Dog in the USA\\", also seen only as a giant black paw with white triangular felt claws, and with more feminine, but similarly unintelligible, dialogue. Black Tooth's trademark was pulling Soupy off-camera to give loud and noisy kisses. * For a short time there was a third dog character that became White Fang's girlfriend, Marilyn Monwolf. She caused some rivalry of affections between Black Tooth and White Fang, but later jilted them both for Joe Dogmaggio. * Pookie the Lion, a lion puppet appearing in a large window behind Soupy (1950s), was a hipster with a rapier wit. For example: Soupy: \\"Do you know why my life is so miserable?\\" Pookie: \\"You got me!\\" Soupy: \\"That's why!\\" One of Pookie's favorite lines when greeting Soupy was, \\"Hey bubby... want a kiss?\\". In the Detroit shows, Pookie never spoke but communicated in whistles. That puppet also was used to mouth the words while pantomiming novelty records on the show. * Hippy the Hippo, a minor character who occasionally appeared with Pookie the Lion. Frank Nastasi gave Hippy a voice for the New York shows. Clyde Adler also voiced Hippy in the shows done in the late 1970s. =New Year's Day incident= On January 1, 1965, miffed at having to work on the holiday, Sales ended his live broadcast by encouraging his young viewers to tiptoe into their still-sleeping parents' bedrooms and remove those \\"funny green pieces of paper with pictures of U.S. Presidents\\" from their pants and pocketbooks. \\"Put them in an envelope and mail them to me\\", Soupy instructed the children. Several days later, substantial amounts of money had begun arriving in the mail; Sales stated that the total amount received was in the thousands of dollars but qualified that by stating that much of that was in play money. Sales said he had been joking and that whatever real money had been sent would be donated to charity, but as parents' complaints increased, WNEW's management suspended Sales for two weeks. Records One of the fans of the Soupy Sales show was Frank Sinatra. When Sinatra started his own record label, Reprise Records, he signed Sales to a recording contract. He produced two albums with Reprise, The Soupy Sales Show in 1961 and Up In The Air in 1962.Hot List, CrazyCollege.org; accessed August 30, 2015. Sales' novelty dance record, '\\"The Mouse\\", dates from the mid-1960s period of his career, when his show was based in New York. The single, released on the ABC-Paramount label, peaked at #76 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in May 1965. Sales performed \\"The Mouse\\" on The Ed Sullivan Show in September 1965, just prior to The Beatles' segment on the show. Sales signed with Motown Records in 1969, releasing the single \\"Muck-Arty Park\\" (a play on the 1968 hit \\"MacArthur Park\\"), as well as the album A Bag of Soup. Soupy and Frank Nastasi also cut and recorded a comedy and song story disk \\"Spy with a Pie\\" for ABC-Paramount. \\"Spy with a Pie\\" was re-released by \\"Simon Says\\" children's records. Game shows From 1968‚Äì75, Sales was a regular panelist on the syndicated revival of What's My Line?. (He had been a guest panelist on one episode of the original version in 1965.) Sales usually was the first panelist introduced and occupied the chair on the far left side (facing the camera), next to Arlene Francis. In 1969, Sales appeared on Storybook Squares, a children's version of Hollywood Squares, as Henry VIII. In 1976, Sales was the host of Junior Almost Anything Goes, ABC's Saturday morning version of their team-based physical stunt program. Sales was also a panelist on the 1980 revival of To Tell the Truth; he had appeared as a guest on the show during the mid- to late 1970s. Other game show appearances included over a dozen episodes of the original Match Game from 1966 to 1969 as well as one week of the revived version in 1976, a week of shows on the 1970s edition of The Gong Show, a couple guest spots on Hollywood Squares (December 12, 1977 and April 4, 1978) as well as a few appearances on the combined version (Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour) in 1983‚Äì84 and a recurring role in all versions of Pyramid from 1973 to 1988 and 1991; in one famous episode, he repeatedly uttered the word \\"bacon\\" in an attempt to get a confused contestant to say \\"greasy things\\". He was considered for the role of host in Nickelodeon's game show, Double Dare, but was deemed too old. He also made an appearance on Pictionary in 1997. Radio show Sales hosted a midday radio show on WNBC in New York from March 1985 to March 1987. His program was between the drive time shifts of Don Imus (morning) and Howard Stern (afternoon), with whom Sales had an acrimonious relationship. An example of this was an incident involving Stern telling listeners that he was cutting the strings in Sales' in-studio piano at 4:05 p.m. on May 1, 1985. On December 21, 2007, Stern revealed this was a stunt staged for \\"theater of the mind\\" and to torture Sales; in truth, the piano was never harmed. Sales' on- air crew included his producer, Ray D'Ariano, newscaster Judy DeAngelis, and pianist Paul Dver.

Personal life Sales was married twice: first to Barbara Fox, from 1950 until their divorce in 1979. They had two sons, both of whom are rock musicians: bassist Tony Sales and drummer Hunt Sales (who were in the band Tin Machine with David Bowie). In 1980, Sales married dancer Trudy Carson, who survives him. Sales died on October 22, 2009, at Calvary Hospice in Bronx, New York, aged 83, from cancer.The New York Daily News, October 23, 2009. He is buried at Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, New York. thumb Legacy *ABC replaced The Soupy Sales Show in 1961 with Cynthia Pepper's short-lived sitcom, Margie. Sales and Pepper later became good friends. *Howard Stern named Sales as one of his childhood heroes, and in an interview on the 2007 Sirius Satellite Radio program \\"The History of Howard Stern\\", he expressed regret over his harsh words and actions towards Sales. *Cited as an influence by Iggy Pop in the movie Gimme Danger. Pop included both of Sales' sons Hunt and Tony as part of his backing band. Reruns Janet Oseroff was Soupy Sales' manager in the last years of his life and continues to represent his estate along with Sales' wife Trudy. They have made a number of deals and represent the package of Soupy Sales reruns that includes over 100 shows, including the entirety of The New Soupy Sales Show and the extant episodes from Sales' earlier black-and-white shows. Soupy Sales shows have aired since 2011 on Jewish Life Television and since 2013 on Retro Television Network, the latter airing the show once a week.Retro Television Network schedule References Further reading =Articles= * Fields, Sidney (May 4, 1965). \\"Only Human: Clown Prince of TV\\".

Accessed 28 December 2007. that was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The school's student body includes approximately 500 day and boarding students, in grades 6-12, some 16% of whom are from outside the United States. The school has attracted international students for decades, and international opportunities for domestic students range from Central America to Ethiopia. As of 2020, school review website Niche ranks The Northwest School as the third best boarding high school, eleventh best private high school, and the twelfth best college prep private high school in Washington state. History The Northwest School was founded in 1980 by Ellen Taussig, Paul Raymond, and Mark Terry. Alongside the historic Summit School building and the school's dormitory for boarding students, modern additions to the Northwest campus were completed in 2006 (expanded photography studio, library, and computer lab) and 2014 (gymnasium, fitness mezzanine, dining room, kitchen, black-box theater and a roof-top sports field). Academics The school's Humanities program encompasses history, literature and art history in a lecture and discussion format. All high school students take a three-year Humanities core program, one year each of Physical Science, Biology, and Chemistry, and a minimum of three years each of mathematics and a foreign language. Students take two fine art classes each year, and must complete at least one class each of theater, visual art, music, and dance before graduation. Fine Arts classes are taught by recognized practitioners. The school's seniors undertake one advanced seminar in writing, philosophy or literature, and another in the social studies‚Äîsuch as an introductory law seminar, post-colonial studies, Latin American studies, Asian studies, and women's studies. The social studies seminar requires completion of two senior projects: volunteer activity with a political campaign during the fall and a written thesis during the second half of the year. Seniors simultaneously continue with a full academic course load that includes 2-3 courses from the mathematics, science, or language departments and at least one arts course. Athletics Sports played at Northwest include Soccer, Cross country running, Track and Field, Basketball, Volleyball, Ultimate Frisbee, and Fitness Team. The school's administration also works to facilitate student participation in city, regional and other intramural sports, such as golf, swimming, water polo and crew. The Northwest School is very competitive in Ultimate Frisbee. The upper school's varsity men have won Western National Championships in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2011, and Northwest students made up half of the team that captured the Club National Championship in the summers of 2005 and 2007. In fall 2011, the boys' varsity team had a perfect record of 23-0, winning the inaugural Seattle Invite and the Washington State Championship along the way. That year, both the male and female varsity teams won the Western National Championships and the Washington State Championships. Middle school and high school participation combined is over 30% of the student population. Notably, Maddie Meyers placed first in the WIAA 1A state cross country championships in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011, first in the 1600m and 3200m at the state track championships in 2009, 2010, and 2011, and first in the 800m at the state track championships in 2010 and 2011.

After attending art schools in Melbourne, he travelled to Europe in 1881 to further his training, and returned home in 1885, \\"primed with whatever was the latest in art\\".Diggins, Lauraine. The Australian Impressionists. Melbourne: Lauraine Diggins Fine Art, 1988. , back cover A leading proponent of painting en plein air, he joined Frederick McCubbin in founding the Box Hill artists' camp, the first of several plein air camps frequented by members of the Heidelberg School. He also encouraged other artists to capture the national life of Australia, and while he is best known today for his \\"national narratives\\"‚Äîamong them Shearing the Rams (1890), A break away! (1891) and Bailed Up (1895)‚Äîhe earned a living as a portraitist, and in 1903 completed the commissioned work The Big Picture, the most famous visual representation of the first Australian Parliament. Life Roberts painting The Big Picture, 1903 Roberts was born in Dorchester, Dorset, England, although some mystery surrounds his actual birthdate: his birth certificate says 8 March 1856, whereas his tombstone is inscribed 9 March. Roberts migrated with his family to Australia in 1869 to live with relatives. Settling in Collingwood, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. He worked as a photographer's assistant through the 1870s, while studying art at night under Louis Buvelot and befriending others who were to become prominent artists, notably Frederick McCubbin. During this period, his mother had remarried to a man whom Roberts did not get on with. He hence decided to further his art studies, and returned to England for three years of full-time art study at the Royal Academy Schools from 1881 to 1884. He traveled in Spain in 1883 with Australian artist John Russell, where he met Spanish artists Laureano Barrau and Ramon Casas who introduced him to the principles of Impressionism and plein air painting. While in London and Paris, he took in the progressing influence of painters Jules Bastien-Lepage and James Abbott McNeill Whistler. From 1884 and through the 1890s Roberts worked again in Victoria, in his studio at the famous studio complex of Grosvenor Chambers at 9 Collins Street, Melbourne. In 1885 he started painting and sketching excursions to what would later become outer suburbs, creating camps at Box Hill and Heidelberg, where he worked alongside McCubbin, Arthur Streeton and Charles Conder, working on representing Australia's light, heat, space and distance. In 1896 he married 36-year-old Elizabeth (Lillie) Williamson and they had a son, Caleb. Many of his most famous paintings come from this period. Roberts was an expert maker of picture frames, and during the period 1903‚Äì1914, when he painted relatively little, much of his income apparently came from this work. Roberts spent World War I in England assisting at a hospital. In Australia, he built a house at Kallista, near Melbourne. Elizabeth died in January 1928, and Roberts remarried, to Jean Boyes, in August 1928. He died in 1931 of cancer in Kallista near Melbourne. His ashes are buried in the churchyard at Illawarra near Longford, Tasmania . Work Holiday sketch at Coogee, 1888, Art Gallery of New South Wales Shearing the Rams, 1890, National Gallery of Victoria Roberts painted a considerable number of fine oil landscapes and portraits, some painted at artist camps with his friend McCubbin. Perhaps the most famous in his time were two large paintings, Shearing the Rams, now displayed in the National Gallery of Victoria and The Big Picture, displayed in Parliament House, Canberra. The Big Picture, a depiction of the first sitting of the Parliament of Australia, was an enormous work, notable for the event depicted as well as the quality of Roberts' work. Shearing the Rams was based on a visit to a sheep station at Brocklesby in southern New South Wales, depicted the wool industry that had been Australia's first export industry and a staple of rural life. When it was first exhibited, there were immediately calls for the painting to enter a public gallery, with a Melbourne correspondent for the Sydney press stating, \\"if our national gallery trustees were in the least patriotic, they would purchase it.\\"\\"Melbourne Gossip\\". The Sydney Mail and New South Wales Advertiser (Sydney). 19 July 1890. p. 145. Retrieved 18 March 2016. Some critics did not feel that it fitted the definition of 'high art'. However, since the wool industry was Australia's greatest export industry at the time, it was a theme with which many Australian people could identify. In this painting, as one modern reviewer has said, Roberts put his formal art training to work, translating \\"the classical statuary into the brawny workers of the shearing shed\\". Roberts made many other paintings showing country people working, with a similar image of the shearing sheds in The Golden Fleece (1894), a drover racing after sheep breaking away from the flock in A break away!, and with men chopping trees in Wood splitters (1886). Many of Roberts' paintings were landscapes or ideas done on small canvases that he did very quickly, such as his show at the famous 9 by 5 Impression Exhibition in Melbourne, \\"9 by 5\\" referring to the size in inches of the cigar box lids on which most of the paintings were done. Roberts had more works on display in this exhibition than anyone else. In 1888 Roberts met Conder in Sydney and they painted together at Coogee beach. The younger Conder found these painting expeditions influential and decided to follow Roberts to Melbourne later that year to join him and Streeton at their artists' camp at Heidelberg. While Conder painted Coogee Bay emphasising on the decorative qualities of form and colour, Roberts' Holiday sketch at Coogee(1888) embodies his primary focus on the landscape's natural effects. It is an early testament to Roberts' plein-air 'impressionist' technique, which brought out the sun's glare on the bright blue sea, bleached white sand, dry grass and spindly seaside vegetation. Legacy Roberts' life was dramatised in the 1985 Australian mini series One Summer Again. A \\"lost\\" painting titled Rejected was featured in a 2017 episode of the BBC series Fake or Fortune?. It was determined by experts to be a genuine Roberts, dating from his student years in London. Roberts' granddaughter considered it a self- portrait. If so, it would make it his oldest surviving self-portrait.

It is named after Louis Pasteur, who made some of the greatest breakthroughs in modern medicine at the time, including pasteurization and vaccines for anthrax and rabies. The institute was founded on June 4, 1887, and inaugurated on November 14, 1888. For over a century, the Institut Pasteur has been at the forefront of the battle against infectious disease. This worldwide biomedical research organization based in Paris was the first to isolate HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, in 1983. Over the years, it has been responsible for breakthrough discoveries that have enabled medical science to control such virulent diseases as diphtheria, tetanus, tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, influenza, yellow fever, and plague. Since 1908, ten Institut Pasteur scientists have been awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine and physiology‚Äîthe 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was shared between two Pasteur scientists. History Institut Pasteur in Bandung, Dutch East Indies Institut Pasteur in Tunis, ca.1900 The Institut Pasteur was founded in 1887 by Louis Pasteur, the famous French chemist and microbiologist. He was committed both to basic research and its practical applications. From the start, Pasteur brought together scientists with various specialties. The first five departments were directed by two normaliens (graduates of the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure), √âmile Duclaux (general microbiology research) and Charles Chamberland (microbes research applied to hygiene), a biologist, Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov (morphological microbe research), and two physicians, Jacques-Joseph Grancher (rabies) and Emile Roux (technical microbe research). One year after the inauguration of the Institut Pasteur, Roux set up the first course of microbiology ever taught in the world, Cours de Microbie Technique (Course of microbe research techniques). Pasteur's successors have sustained this tradition, which is reflected in the Institut Pasteur's unique history of accomplishment: * Emile Roux and Alexandre Yersin discovered the mechanism of action of Corynebacterium diphtheriae and how to treat diphtheria with antitoxins * Alexandre Yersin discovered in 1894 the pathogen of bubonic plague, Yersinia pestis * Paul-Louis Simond discovered in 1898 the role of the flea in the transmission of plague * Albert Calmette and Camille Gu√©rin discovered how to culture the tuberculosis bacillus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (so called BCG or Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin) at Institut Pasteur de Lille, and developed in 1921 the first effective anti-tuberculosis vaccine * Alphonse Laveran received the 1907 Nobel Prize for his research on the role of protozoans as disease agents (notably, his discovery of the malaria hematozoon) * Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov received the Nobel Prize in 1908 for contributions to scientific understanding of the immune system * Constantin Levaditi and Karl Landsteiner demonstrated in 1910 that poliomyelitis is due to a filterable virus * F√©lix d'Herelle discovered in 1917 the bacteriophage, a virus that spread only inside bacteria * Jules Bordet received the Nobel prize in 1919 for his discoveries on immunity, especially the implication of antibodies and the complement system‚Ä≤s mechanisms of action * Charles Nicolle received the Nobel prize in 1928 for unravelling the mystery of how typhus is transmitted, especially the role of the louse * Jean Laigret developed in 1932 the first vaccine for yellow fever * Andr√© Lwoff established in 1951 the existence of proviruses, a work honored by the 1965 Nobel Prize * Jacques Monod and Francois Jacob discovered the mechanism of genes' transcription regulation, a work honored by the 1965 Nobel Prize * Pierre L√©pine developed in 1955 one of the first anti-polio vaccines * Jean-Pierre Changeux isolated in 1970 the first receptor to a neurotransmitter, the acetylcholine receptor. * Luc Montagnier, Fran√ßoise Barr√©-Sinoussi and colleagues discovered the two HIV viruses that cause AIDS in 1983 and 1985; Montagnier and Barr√©-Sinoussi were honored by the 2008 Nobel Prize The Institute's biggest mistake was ignoring a dissertation by Ernest Duchesne on the use of Penicillium glaucum to cure infections in 1897. The early exploitation of his discovery might have saved millions of lives, especially in World War I. A new age of preventive medicine in France was made possible by the Institut Pasteur's (early 20th century) development of vaccines for tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, yellow fever and poliomyelitis. The discovery and use of sulfonamides in treating infections was another of its earlier breakthroughs. Some researchers won fame by discovering antitoxins, while Daniel Bovet received the 1957 Nobel Prize for his discoveries on synthetic anti-histamines and curarizing compounds. Since World War II, Pasteur researchers have focused sharply on molecular biology. Their achievements were recognized in 1965, when the Nobel Prize was shared by Fran√ßois Jacob, Jacques Monod and Andr√© Lwoff for their work on the regulation of viruses. In 1985, the first human vaccine obtained by genetic engineering from animal cells, the vaccine against hepatitis B, was developed by Pierre Tiollais and collaborators. The building hosting the Museum and the funeral chapel of Pasteur =The Institute's opening= Although the center against rabies, directed by Jacques-Joseph Grancher and √âmile Roux was more than functional, it became so overcrowded that it became necessary to build a structure that Pasteur had been calling with the name ‚ÄúInstitute Pasteur‚Äù long before it was even built. Since Pasteur could not, for health reasons, do it himself, he delegated the task of the project and of creating the new building, situated on rue Dutot, to two of his most trusted colleagues, Grancher and Emile Duclaux. From the beginning the Institute experienced some economical difficulties that it was able to overcome thanks to the help of the government, some foreign rulers and Madame Boucicaut, but this aid would not in any way restrain its independence, therefore respecting Pasteur's most important prerogative. The million francs left unused would not be sufficient to provide for the institute's needs for long, but the prestige and the social benefits it would bring to France justified and motivated the subsidy it would receive; also the money brought in from selling the vaccines in France and in the rest of the world would help in supporting it. In 1888 this foundation, which had obtained the full approval from the government, began to function, and from the beginning it was involved in the development and changes that France underwent during the last decades of the 19th century. The statutes drawn by Pasteur and later approved by Duclaux and Grancher define, besides its absolute freedom and independence, the institute's internal structure: a rabies division controlled by Grancher, an anthrax one in Chamberland‚Äôs hands, who also supervised the department of microbiology, while Emile Roux dealt with microbial methods applied to medicine. =The Institute during World War I and World War II= Men and woman working in classroom at the Institut Pasteur, ca. 1920 During the First World War the institute was not only involved in the prevention of sanitary risks but also had to deal with the demands of the moment. The most urgent matter was to vaccinate the troops against typhoid fever, easily contracted by the soldiers who often had no choice but to drink from small streams or puddles from the last rain. By September 1914, the institute was able to provide 670,000 doses of the needed vaccine and continued to produce it throughout the conflict. It is important to note that the war brought to light germs that during times of peace were concealed deep within the soil or in pockets of putrefaction and therefore it revealed the true nature and severity of some types of pathogens that would otherwise have remained unknown. That's how Michel Weinberg, Metchnikoff's scholar, disclosed the complex etiology of gas gangrene and created a vaccine for each one of the anaerobes associated with it.M. Weinberg, La Gangr√®ne gazeuse, Masson, 1918. The First World War involved science in warfare: a movement of active participation arose among researchers who felt the need to help France win the war. This is why Gabriel Bertrand, with Roux's authorization, crafted a grenade based on chloropicrin and Fourneau discovered the chemical reaction that led to the formation of methylarsine chloride, whose effects are even worse than the ones of other poisonous gases used during the war. In 1938 the institute, despite its relative poverty, built a biochemical division and another one dedicated to cellular pathology, whose direction was entrusted to the hands of Boivin (who went on to discover endotoxins that are contained in the germ's body and are freed after its death). During the same period, Andre Lwoff assumed the direction of a new microbial physiology branch built on rue Dutot. The general mobilization after France's declaration of war against Germany, in September 1939, emptied the Institute and significantly reduced its activities, as members of appropriate age and condition were recruited into the army, but the almost total absence of battles during the first months of the conflict helped maintain the sanitary situation on the front. After the occupation of France, the Germans never tried to gather information from the institute's research; their confidence in Germany's advantage in this field decreased their curiosity, and their only interest was in the serums and vaccines that it could provide to their troops or the European auxiliaries they recruited. This relative freedom allowed the institute to become, during the two years after the occupation, a great pharmacy for the Resistance thanks to the initiative of Vallery-Radot, Pasteur's nephew. The Germans became suspicious of the institute's staff only after an outbreak of typhoid in a Wehrmacht division that was stationed near Paris before being sent to the Russian front. The cause of the epidemic was later found to be due to a member of the Institute stealing a culture of the germ responsible for the disease and, with the collaboration of an accomplice, infecting a large quantity of butter used to feed German troops. The fact that the epidemic spread after the Germans sold some of the butter to civilians was proof that the illness's breakout was not caused by local water quality. Afterwards, the German authorities ordered that the institute's stores containing microbial cultures could be opened only by authorized members; similar security problems also induced them to demand complete lists of the staff's names and functions; missing names caused the Germans to send two very valuable biologists, Dr. Wolmann and his wife, as well as other three lab assistants, to a concentration camp. The institute was not a location for German entrenchment even during the battles for Paris's liberation because of the honor and respect it commanded, as well as out of fear that involving it in any type of conflict might ‚Äúfree the ghosts of long defeated diseases‚Äù. =The Institute's economical difficulties during the Seventies= At the end of 1973 the institute's economic status was so worrisome that its troubles aroused the public's interest: no one could believe that an institution which was to provide vaccines and serums for more that fifty million people could be undergoing such big financial problems, an institution that furthermore was believed to be under government protection ‚Äì like the Bank of France ‚Äì and therefore shielded from bankruptcy. The causes of the decadence that brought the institute to financial ruins were numerous, but most of them were associated with its commercial and industrial activities and its management. Both the research and production branch had to endure the recoil caused by financial issues: the research branch didn't receive enough funds and the production branch, which was losing market ground to the new private labs, was immobilized by the antiquated mechanical equipment. When in 1968, after disappearing for a long period, rabies reappeared in France, the institute, which owed its original celebrity to this disease's vaccine, was replaced by other pharmaceutical industries in the production of the vaccines; yet, despite the deficiencies in the organization's production branch, its members were able to produce, in 1968, over 400,000 doses of vaccine against the Hong Kong influenza. In 1971 Jacques Monod announced a new era of modernization and development: this new awakening was symbolized by the construction of a new factory where all the production departments were to be reunited. Its construction cost forty-five million francs and the Government, impressed by the institute's will to change, granted it a sum of twenty million francs to bridge the deficit, followed by the people's initiative to also accept a role in the division of the financial responsibilities. The accomplishments of the Institute's members =Roux's cure against diphtheria and studies on syphilis= Production of antiserum at the Institut Pasteur in Paris Not long after the institute's inauguration, Roux, now less occupied in the fight against rabies, resumed in a new lab and with the help of a new colleague, Yersin, his experiments on diphtheria. This disease used to kill thousands of children every year: an associated condition was commonly called croup, which created fake membranes in the small patients' throats, therefore killing them by suffocation. It was deservedly called ‚ÄúHorrible monster, sparrowhawk of the shadows‚Äù by Victor Hugo in his Art of being a grandfather. The painter Albert Gustaf Aristides Edelfelt made a famous painting portraying Pasteur in his laboratory while he was trying to cure this illness, which was fought at the times through procedures that were just as cruel as the illness itself. Roux and Yersin grew the bacillus that causes it and studied, thanks to various experiments they did on rabbits, its pathogenic power and symptoms, like the paralysis of the respiratory muscles. It is this last consequence of the diphtheria that provided the two researchers with a valuable clue of the nature of the disease, since it is caused by an intoxication due to a toxin introduced into the organism by the bacillus, that while secreting this particular venom is able to multiply itself: they were therefore inclined to think that the bacillus owed its virulence to the toxin. After filtrating the microbial culture of the Corynebacterium diphtheriae and injecting it into the lab animals, they were able to observe all the typical signs of the sickness. Roux and Yersin established that they were dealing with a new type of bacillus, not only able to proliferate and abundantly reproduce itself, but also capable of spreading at the same time a powerful venom, and they deduced that it can play the role of antigen, that is if they could overcome the delicate moment of its injection, made especially dangerous by the toxin. Some German researchers had also discovered the diphtheria toxin and were trying to immunize some guinea pigs through the use of a vaccine: one of them, Von Behring, Robert Koch's student, stated that he was able to weaken small doses of the toxin. Nonetheless Roux was not convinced by this result, since no-one knew the collateral effects of the procedure, and preferred to use serotherapy since more than one lab study ‚Äì like the one accomplished by Charles Richet ‚Äì demonstrated that the serum of an animal vaccinated against the disease included the antibodies needed to defeat it. The anti-diphtheria serum which was able to agglutinate the bacteria and neutralize the toxin was supplied by a horse inoculated with the viral germs, and it was separated from the blood drawn from the horses‚Äô jugular vein. Like it happened for his teacher with the anti-rabies vaccine, Roux needed to test the effectiveness of the product he elaborated, and endured all the stress and ethical dilemmas that the first use of such a risky but also groundbreaking procedure implied. To test the serum two groups of children were chosen from two different hospitals: in the first one, which received the serum, 338 out of 449 children survived, in the latter one, treated with the customary therapies, only 204 out of 520 survived. Once the results were made public by Le Figaro newspaper, a subscription fund was opened to raise the money needed to provide the Institute the number of horses necessary to produce enough serum to satisfy the national demand. After Duclaux's death, Roux took his place as head of the institute, and the last research he carried out was the one on syphilis, a dangerous disease because of its immediate effects and the hereditary repercussions that result from it. Despite Fournier‚Äôs considerable work, van Swieten‚Äôs liquid mercury was still the only known cure, although its results were doubtful and uncertain. The search for a stronger remedy against this disease was made more difficult because most animals are immune to it: it was thus not possible to experiment possible cures and study their likely side effects. The sexually transmittable Treponema pallidum (the syphilis germ), detected by two German biologists, Schaudinn and Hoffmann, affects only the human racewhere it resides in sperm, ulceration and cancers that it is able to causeand, as it will be later discovered, some anthropoid apes, especially chimpanzees. Both Roux and Metchnikoff, consequent to the discovery that this type of ape can be contaminated with the illness, contributed with their research in creating a vaccine, while Bordet and Wassermann elaborated a solution that was able to expose the germ‚Äôs presence in human blood. Even though it was not yet a completely reliable solution, it represented a noteworthy evolution compared to the previous medicines used against syphilis. =Metchnikoff‚Äôs phagocytosis theory= Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov already announced the ‚Äúprinciple of immunization‚Äù during his voluntary exile in Italy, where he went to undertake some studies, the results of which he had promptly communicated to Pasteur. The phagocytosis theory is based on the notion that phagocytes are cells that have the power to englobe foreign bodies ‚Äì and above all bacteria ‚Äì introduced inside an organism. German biologists opposed to his doctrine the humoral theory: they claimed to have found in Roux's serum some substances able to reveal the presence of microbes, and to ensure their destruction if properly stimulated. The German scientist Eduard Buchner referred to these substances as ‚Äúalexine‚Äù and two other biologists, Von Behring and Kitasato, demonstrated their lytic power towards bacteria. In 1894 one of these scientist published the result of an experiment that appeared to completely refute Metchnikoff's ideas: using the cholera vibrio, discovered ten years before by Robert Koch, as an antigen, Richard F. J. Pfeiffer introduced it in the abdomen of a guinea pig already vaccinated against this disease, and was able to observe the destruction of the vibrio in the local blood plasma, without the participation of the phagocytes. Not even this study was able to shake Metchnikoff's belief and faith in his theory, and his ideas, as well as Pfeiffer's and Buchner's, would all contribute to the elaboration of the current theory of the immune system. =Yersin's studies on the plague= Yersin, after his research with Roux, abruptly left the Institute for personal reasons, without losing Pasteur's benevolence, who never doubted that the young man was destined to great things in the scientific area and would contribute in spreading Pasteur's discoveries around the world. The news of a violent plague outburst in Yunman enabled Yersin to truly show and reach his potential as he was summoned, as Pasteur's scholar, to conduct a microbiological research of the disease. The plague he had to deal with was the bubonic plague, which is recognizable most of the time through the abscesses, known as buboes, it provokes in its victims. Yersin looked for the germ responsible for the infection specifically in these plague-spots, tumors caused by the inflammation of the lymphatic glands which become black because of the necrosis of the tissue. After many microscopic exams he was able to state that in most of the cases the bubonic plague bacterium was located in these buboes; but in the meanwhile the Japanese scientist Kitasato also declared that he had isolated the bacterium, even though the description he provided was dissimilar to the one given by Yersin. Therefore, although at first named ‚ÄúKitasato- Yersin bacillus‚Äù by the scientific community, the microbe will later assume only the latter's name because the one identified by Kitasato, a type of streptococcus, cannot be found in the lymphatic glands. However it is Paul- Louis Simond who was the first to understand and describe the etiology of the plague and its modality of contamination: he observes all over the bodies of the people affected by it small flea-bites, which he also found on the bodies of the dead rats that were always linked to the plague, and then deduced that the fleas which carried the bacteria were its true vector or source, and that they transmitted the illness by jumping from the dead rats' bodies to the human ones and biting them. Paul-Louis Simond injecting a plague vaccine on the 4th of June 1898 in the Vishandas Hospital, Karachi =Calmette's and Guerin's anti-tuberculosis vaccine= By the beginning of the 20th century, the improvement of the general life conditions and the development of a more extensive conception of hygiene produced in France a slight regression in tuberculosis cases: nonetheless the institute's labs, like many other ones, kept trying to find among the Koch's bacillus many singularities the one that would allow them to find an antidote to its terrible consequences. Right after he had discovered the bacillus, Koch had tried in vain to create a vaccine against it, however the injection of the filtrate he had prepared, later called tuberculin, had the effect of revealing who was phthisic from who wasn't by causing in the latter--and not in the former--fever and light trembling. The institute's newspaper was filled at the time with articles regarding tuberculosis, some of which written by Albert Calmette, who extended his research to a socio-professional category which was extremely affected by it, that is the miners in whom this disease is often anticipated or accompanied by silicosis and anchylostomiasis (caused by a small intestinal worm that creates a state of anemia propitious to tuberculosis). After finding a better solution to anchylostomiasis, he focused on creating a vaccine using the bacillus responsible for bovine tuberculosis, very similar to the human one, as it caused almost the same symptoms. Having observed that most actinomycetales are saprophytes, that is able to survive outside of living organisms, with the help of a veterinary, Camille Guerin, he attempted to create a special nutritious environment for the bacillus that, in time, altered its features by eliminating the virulence and leaving only the antigenic power. Both of the scientist knew that this arduous task would require a lot of effort and time, because it was necessary to act on a large number of generations to change the genetic foundation of a species, nevertheless the velocity of the bacteria's reproduction allowed, since it was constantly monitored, to interfere with an important phase of its evolution. The environment deemed appropriate for the denaturation of the Mycobacterium bovis was a compost of potatoes cooked in the bile of an ox treated with glycerine, and Calmette re-inseminated it every three weeks for thirteen years, while checking for an enfeeblement of the pathogenic power of the bacillus. Having finally lost completely its virulence, the bovine tuberculosis germ grown with their method was the principal prophylactic weapon against human tuberculosis, and it helped to reduce considerably the frequency of this disease. While experimenting on chimpanzees in Kindia, on which he was able to test exhaustively his vaccine, Calmette also discovered that it can notably weaken some leprosy manifestationsits bacillus presents some similarities with Koch's. =Calmette's work in Saigon= In Saigon Albert Calmette also created the first overseas branch of the institute, where he produced an amount of smallpox and rabies vaccines sufficient to satisfy the needs of the population, and started a study on venomous snakes, particularly cobras. During these studies Calmette discovered that the power of the venom, as well as that of tetanus, could be annihilated by the use of alkaline hypochlorites, and was able therefore to create a serum, effective if injected right after the cobra's bite. Back in France, he acquired enough snakes to continue his work and create serum for the local population. =Nicolle's work on epidemic typhus= The scientist and writer Charles Nicolle while in Tunis studied how epidemic typhus ‚Äì known for the red spots it left on sick people that disappeared before their death ‚Äì was transmitted. His insight into the mode of transmission occurred while he was visiting the hospital: patients were washed and given clean clothes on admission, and no new cases occurred within the hospital. This made him realise that the vector of the disease were lice that were discarded with the patient's own clothes. Nicolle managed to attract H√©l√®ne Sparrow to be Laboratory Chief in Tunis. She had worked with Rudolf Weigl who had developed a vaccine, and she was able to introduce this to Tunisia as the start of a public health programme to control the disease. Nevertheless, three other scientists identified the bacterium responsible for the disease: Ricketts, Russell Morse Wilder (1885‚Äì1959), and Prowazek, who called it Rickettsia prowazekii. =Chantemesse's typhoid vaccine= During the summer of 1900, the extremely hot weather and scarcity of the water supply in Paris, usually ensured by the Ourcq channel and by the de la Dhuis aqueduct, forced the authorities to pump water directly from the Seine, which, despite filtering, led to a sudden and alarming outbreak of typhoid cases in Paris. The cause of the disease, a bacillus that was discovered almost twenty years before by the German bacteriologist Karl Joseph Eberth and that looks like a bodyless spider, was constantly present in this river and not even pouring extensive quantities of ozone and of lime permanganate into its water was enough to exterminate the bacteria. The difficulty in creating a vaccine is caused by the nature of the germ's endotoxins. Unlike diphtheria, which releases toxins via exocytotic secretion, typhoid pathogens encapsulate endotoxins which survive even after the death of the bacillus. After working in the rabies division of Rue Vaquelin and studying the microbe that causes dysentery, Andr√© Chantemesse collaborated with a younger bacteriologist, Georges-Fernand Widal. Together they were able to immunize guinea pigs by inoculating them with heat-treated dead bacteria, calling into question the notion that only weakened, not dead, bacteria can be used to immunize. They concluded that a series of three or four early injections of such heat-inactivated bacteria can effectively inoculate against development of the disease, as the endotoxins alone are sufficient to trigger the production of antibodies. =Fourneau and the Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry= Regarding curative medicine, it was in 1911 that it took off at the Institut Pasteur, when Ernest Fourneau created the Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, which he directed until 1944, and from which emerged numerous drugs, among which one can mention the first pentavalent arsenical treatment (Stovarsol), the first synthetic alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonist (Prosympal), the first antihistamine (Piperoxan), the first active drug on heart rate (Dacorene) or the first synthetic no-depolarising muscle relaxant (Flaxedil). The discovery of the therapeutic properties of sulfanilamide by Tr√©fou√´l, Nitti and Bovet, in the laboratory of Fourneau, paved the way for the sulfamidotherapy.Jean-Pierre Fourneau, ¬´ Ernest Fourneau, fondateur de la chimie th√©rapeutique fran√ßaise : Feuillets d'album ¬ª, 1987, Revue d'histoire de la pharmacie, n¬∞ 275, pp. 335-355.Marcel Del√©pine, ¬´ Ernest Fourneau (1872-1949) : Sa vie et son ≈ìuvre ¬ª, extrait du Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© chimique de France, Paris, Masson, s.d. (ca 1950). The Hospital Pasteur The Hospital Pasteur was built during the first years of the 20th century in front of the institute, and was employed for a long time by the members as a field for clinical observation and experimentations of therapeutical processes elaborated by themselves. Since in the beginning it was provided with only 120 beds, every patient was so well isolated in his private room that each room could be almost considered a small pest house, ideal for quarantine. The construction of the hospital was enabled by the gift of a rich benefactor, Madame Lebaudy, while the money offered by another rich woman, the baroness Hirsch, was used to build a vast pavilion that accommodated the Department of Chemical Biology of the institute. =Duclaux work in the chemical biology department= The work done in the new pavilion by Duclaux clarified how the human body accomplished some of its vital functions, and brought to light the role of a diastase. It was critical in resolving a controversy aroused between Pasteur and Berthelot after the publication of Claude Bernard‚Äôs posthumous essay regarding the nature of the agents implicated in some transformations that happen inside plants, like fermentation. While Pasteur believed that the only substance implied in the process of fermentation was yeast, Bernard ‚Äì and Berthelot in his own way ‚Äì believed that some other soluble ferment was involved: the German chemist Eduard Buchner later demonstrated the existence of this ‚Äúferment‚Äù, an intracellular diastase which he called ‚Äúzymase,‚Äù what we know now as enzymes. Duclaux's study on the metabolism of nutrients did not have immediate practical applications, but later revealed how extensive is the field of enzymes and opened new roads that would lead biology to extend the knowledge on life's mechanisms on a molecular level.  Pasteur's museum and tomb  The Mus√©e Pasteur (Pasteur Museum) is located in the south wing of the first building occupied by the Institut Pasteur, which was inaugurated on November 14, 1888. Established in 1936, this museum preserves the memory of Louis Pasteur's life and work in the vast apartment where he lived during the last seven years of his life, from 1888 to 1895. This museum also includes the collection of scientific objects illustrating the scientist's work, as well as the Neo-Byzantine funeral chapel where Pasteur is buried. Institut Pasteur today Today, the Institut Pasteur is one of the world's leading research centers; it houses 100 research units and close to 2,700 people, including 500 permanent scientists and another 600 scientists visiting from 70 countries annually. The Institut Pasteur is also a global network of 24 foreign institutes devoted to medical problems in developing countries; a graduate study center and an epidemiological screening unit.

In addition to the isolation of HIV-1 and HIV-2, in the recent past researchers at the Institut Pasteur have developed a test for the early detection of colon cancer, produced a genetically engineered vaccine against hepatitis B and a rapid diagnostic test for the detection of the Helicobacter pylori bacterium which is implicated in the formation of stomach ulcers. Other research in progress includes the study of cancer and specifically the investigation of the role of oncogenes, the identification of tumor markers for diagnostic tests and the development of new treatments. One area of particular interest is the study of human papilloma viruses (HPV) and their role in cervical cancers. Researchers are currently focusing on the development of various vaccines against many diseases including AIDS, malaria, dengue fever and the Shigella bacterium. Currently, an extensive line of research aims at determining the complete genome sequences of several organisms of medical importance, in the hope of finding new therapeutic approaches. The institute has contributed to genome- sequencing projects of the common yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an organism which was so important for Louis Pasteur's history), completed in 1996, Bacillus subtilis completed in 1997, Mycobacterium tuberculosis completed in 1998. Teaching center Since its founding, the Institute Pasteur has brought together scientists from many different disciplines for postgraduate study. Today, approximately 300 graduate students and 500 postdoctoral trainees from close to 40 different countries participate in postgraduate study programs at the institute. They include pharmacists and veterinarians, as well as doctors, chemists and other scientists. Epidemiological reference center Strains of bacteria and viruses from many different countries are sent to the institute's reference center for identification. In addition to maintaining this vital epidemiological resource, the Institute serves as advisor to the French government and the World Health Organization (WHO) of the United Nations. Pasteur scientists also help to monitor epidemics and control outbreaks of infectious diseases throughout the world. These activities have created a close collaboration between the Institute and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Vaccines and diagnostic products Production and marketing of diagnostic tests developed in the Institute laboratories are the responsibility of Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur, a subsidiary of the French pharmaceutical firm Sanofi, while production and marketing of vaccines are the responsibility of Pasteur M√©rieux, S√©rums et Vaccins. Structure and support As a private, non-profit organization, the Institut Pasteur is governed by an independent Board of Directors, currently chaired by Fran√ßois Ailleret. The Director general of the Pasteur Institut is Stewart Cole. By drawing financial support from many different sources, the Institute protects its autonomy and guarantees the independence of its scientists. The institute's funding includes French government subsidies, consulting fees, licensing royalties, contract revenue and private contributions. In popular culture The book The Paris Option by Robert Ludlum and Gayle Lynds begins with four men blowing up the Institut Pasteur, as a cover for stealing a molecular computer project being done there. The Institut Pasteur in Paris features prominently in the terrorist- fiction eBook, The Madness Analog, as the location for clandestine experiments in biochemical weaponry.

The event exists to show appreciation for the work of sysadmins and other IT workers. It is celebrated on the last Friday in July.  History  The first System Administrator Appreciation Day was celebrated on July 28, 2000. Kekatos was inspired to create the special day by a Hewlett-Packard magazine advertisement in which a system administrator is presented with flowers and fruit-baskets by grateful co-workers as thanks for installing new printers. Kekatos had just installed several of the same model printer at his workplace. The official SysAdmin Day website includes many suggestions for the proper observation of the holiday. Most common is cake and ice cream. There are many international websites which celebrate the holiday. Many geek and Internet culture businesses, such as O'Reilly Media, also honor the holiday with special product offerings and contests. Various filk songs have been written to commemorate the day. The songs have reached a level of popularity where they are also covered by other performers. Attempts to have Hallmark Cards recognize the holiday as a Hallmark Holiday have yet to be realized. Many e-card websites already have special SysAdminDay cards available. The holiday has been recognized and promoted by many IT professional organizations, the League of Professional System Administrators, SAGE/USENIX and SNIPhub.

Its design was derived from the F-22 Raptor. The FB-22 was canceled following the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review. Design and development In 2001, Lockheed Martin began studies on the feasibility of the FB-22 as the company sought to leverage the design and capabilities of the F-22 Raptor. Experience gleaned from Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan demonstrated the value of a bomber that could remain in theatre in the absence of surface-to-air missiles. The F-22, while designed as an air superiority fighter, embodied some degree of air-to-ground attack ability. One primary objective of the internal studies was to exploit the F-22's air-to-ground capability while keeping costs to a minimum. To this end, the company devised several concepts that saw significant structural redesigns with respect to the fuselage and wings, while retaining much of the F-22's avionics. With an early design, Lockheed Martin lengthened and widened the fuselage to increase the internal weapons load; it was later found that doing so would have incurred a cost penalty of 25‚Äì30% in weight, materials and development. Instead, the company left the fuselage intact as it enlarged the wing to a more delta shape. The wing, which was around three times that of the F-22, enabled the storage of a much larger amount of weapons and fuel. Various figures give the payload of the FB-22 to be 30 to 35 Small Diameter Bombs; this is compared to the F-22's payload of eight of such weapons. Unlike the F-22, the FB-22 was designed to be able to carry bombs up to in size. With stealth, the aircraft's maximum combat load was to have been ; without stealth, . Range was almost tripled from to more than , which could have been extended by external fuel tanks. This placed the aircraft in the category of a regional bomber, comparable to that of the F-111, as it was intended to replace the F-15E Strike Eagle and take over some of the missions of the B-1 and B-2. According to Air Force Magazine, the combination of range and payload of the FB-22 would have given the concept a comparable effectiveness to that of the B-2 armed with bombs. The design could also have been adapted to use a more powerful engine, such as the F-35 Lightning II's Pratt & Whitney F135, or the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136. While an early FB-22 concept featured no tailplanes, the design incorporated twin tailplanes and likely would have fixed engine nozzles as opposed to the thrust vectoring nozzles on the F-22.Miller 2005, pp. 76‚Äì77. The FB-22 was to have a maximum speed of Mach 1.92. Because the aircraft was to emphasize air- to-ground capability while maintaining stealth characteristics, the FB-22 would have lacked dogfighting capability. One aspect that arose during the early stages of the design process was the consideration that Boeing would be responsible for the final assembly of the aircraft. At the time, Lockheed Martin was making the mid-fuselage at its plant in Fort Worth, Texas, while assembling the plane in Marietta, Georgia. However, since Boeing was responsible for the manufacturing of parts of the fuselage and more crucially, the wings‚Äîas well as integrating the avionics‚Äîit was considered prudent to give final assembly to Boeing. Other than the wings, the aircraft would have retained much of the design of the F-22. This included 80% of the avionics, software, and flight controls. This commonality would have also significantly reduced the costs of software integration. In February 2003, during a session with the House Committee on Armed Services, Air Force Secretary James Roche said that he envisioned a force of 150 FB-22s would equip the service. In 2004, Lockheed Martin officially presented the FB-22 to the Air Force to meet its requirement for a potential strategic bomber as an interim solution to become operational by 2018. Because of the work already done on the F-22, the cost of developing the FB-22 was estimated to be as low as 25% of developing a new bomber, with development expected to be US$5‚Äì7 billion (2002 dollars), including the airframe cost of US$1 billion (2003 dollars). It was later revealed that six different versions of the bomber were submitted, as targets, payload and range had yet to be defined. In addition, as a stealth bomber, the FB-22 was designed to carry weapons externally while maintaining stealth with the assistance of detachable and faceted pods dubbed \\"wing weapons bay\\"; previously, an aircraft could only remain stealthy if it carried its weapons internally. However, the FB-22 in its planned form appears to have been canceled in the wake of the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review and subsequent developments as the Department of Defense favored a bomber with much greater range.

Gulmit is a centuries-old historic town, with mountains, peaks and glaciers. It is a tourist spot and has many historic places, hotels, shops and a museum.  Etymology  Gulmit, according to the locals means \\"the valley of flowers\\".  History  The nearby Gulmit Glacier is named after the town and surrounding region. Before 1974, when Hunza was a state, Gulmit used to be the Summer Capital of the state. After the abolition of the state it became the Tehsil's seat of government. The oldest intact house in Gulmit is more than six centuries old. Most of People in the entire Gojal Valley have Central Asian ancestral backgrounds. The people speak Wakhi language and belong to the Shia Imami Ismaili sect of Islam. Population of Gulmit, according to 2016 survey, consists of around 5000 individuals. Fifty-one percent of the population is female. There are many forts and fortresses in Gojal valley, such as Qalanderchi fort in Misghar valley and Rashit fort in Chipursan valley, but Ondra fort is the most prominent. This fort is perched on Ondra hill, which overlooks Gulmit and Ghulkin villages. The fort is believed to have been built by Qutlug Baig in the 16th century. He was the first Wakhi ruler to establish rule in Gulmit, threatening the Mirs of Hunza. Before him, Gulmit was under the control of Hazur Jamshid (1550-1556), who was the ruler of Gilgit. His sons Su Malik and Mir Malik were deputed to collect the tax from Gojal. Once, returning from a visit to collect tax from Yishkook in Chipursan valley, the two stopped in Gulmit and liked it. They decided to live in Gulmit. After the death of Hazur Jamshid, Su Malik, the elder son, rushed to Gilgit to sit on his father's throne. He became the new ruler of Gilgit (1556-1578). According to Muhammad Zia, celebrated genealogy-keeper (zon) of Gulmit, Mir Malik also eventually left for Hunza. Taking advantage of the absence of Su Malik and Mir Malik, Qutlug Baig with the help of locals captured Gulmit and the surrounding villages. Qutlug Baig belonged to the Charshambi Kator lineage of the Wakhis of Gulmit. The territory of Qutlug Baig started from Khyber village and ended at Shishkat. In order to secure his territory from invaders, he built two gates, one at Khyber and the other at Shishkat. The gates were closed at night and opened during the day. In wartime, these gates remained closed, thus keeping the enemies away from his dominion. The remains of both gates and fortification walls can still be seen at Khyber as well as in Shishkat. In order to rein in the probable advance of the enemies from North and south, Quitlug Baig built the Ondra fort. To the north lay the State of Hunza, and to the South the power of Kirghiz invaders who used to attack Gulmit to control the pastures for their livestock. The height of the fort's ramparts ranges from 6 to 13 feet above the ground. There were many living quarters inside the fort. One can still find them at two places, one on the southern side and the other on the northern side. These living quarters were separated by a central wall of the fort that runs east- west. The central rampart is higher than the southern and northern fortification walls. The northern quarters were constructed for the army of Qutlug to keep an eye on the enemy advancing from the north, while the southern quarters were built to keep check on the enemy coming from the south, particularly the army of the Mir of Hunza. The fortification walls have been provided embrasure and merlons. Only the northern and southern fortification walls have been provided embrasure. All the ramparts of the fort are still in a good condition. However, the eastern and western fortification walls are in a crumbling condition. View of Gulmit village In order to secure his territory from invaders, he built two gates which were closed at night and opened during the day The Ondra fort reflects the power of the Wakhi ruler Qutlug who was never defeated by the Mirs of Hunza. He was known for his gallantry and swordsmanship in the battlefield. Mirs of Hunza were scared by the rising power of Qutlug. They never dared to cross his territory. Qutlug was poisoned to death by one of his elderly female servants. She was sent by then Mir of Hunza Mir Malik. She administered poison in the food of Qutlug and his courtesans. After the death of Qutllug, Gulmit was recaptured and Ondra fell into hands of the Mir of Hunza. Qutlug Baig was buried in Gulmit along with his courtesans. According to Afzal Khan, one of the notables of Gulmit, the grave of Qutlug was located where there is now the Government Girls High School in Gulmit. Qutllug ruled over Gulmit and its adjoining areas for twelve years. During his rule, land and life was safe and secure. He pushed the advancing Kirghiz back to their land and never let them succeed in their mission and goals. The heroic stories of Qulug still dominate the daily discourse of the Wakhi people living in Gulmit, Shimshal, Chipursan, the valleys of Gojal. Many storytellers still amuse both audience and themselves by narrating the stories of their ruler Qutlug Baig. This fort is still a destination for domestic and international tourists. From Ondra fort one has a panoramic view of Gulmit. From the south one can see Gulmit and as far as Shishkat villages and from the north one can view the Ghulkin village. From the north one can enjoy seeing Ghulkin glacier, Tupopdan and Qaroon peak. From the west, there are views of Gulmit Glacier, Gulmit Tower, Shisper Peak and Utlar Sar. Climate Retreating Attabad lake at Gulmit With virtually no rainfall during the year, Gulmit features a cold desert climate (BWk) under the K√∂ppen climate classification. The average temperature in summer is 18 to 24¬∞C, while the annual precipitation averages 113 mm. November is the driest month with 2 mm of rainfall, while May, the wettest month, has an average precipitation of 24 mm. July is the warmest month of the year with an average temperature of 21.8 ¬∞C. The coldest month January has an average temperature of -5.5 ¬∞C.  Buildings  There are five Jamaat-khanas or religious community centres in Gulmit. One notices their presence in every ward of the village. The old Summer Palace of Mir of Hunza stands at the northern edge of Gulmit's historic Polo Ground. Old places of worship, now used as libraries, also adorn the Gulmit valley. Among new buildings constructed by the government in Gulmit are Tehsil Headquarters, Federal Government's Boys High School, Civil Hospital, Diamond Jubilee Girls Middle School and Government Girls Higher Secondary School. Al- Amyn Model School, a community-based organization, has a building with a hostel facility standing next to the Health Center of Aga Khan Health Services.

Recipe The basic recipe calls for milk and onion with breadcrumbs and butter added as thickeners, seasoned with nutmeg, clove, bay leaf, pepper, and salt. History A survivor of the medieval bread-thickened sauces, the traditional British bread sauce is made with milk, butter or cream, and bread crumbs, flavoured with onion, salt, cloves, mace, pepper, and bay leaf, with the fat from roasting often added as well. It typically accompanies domestic fowl such as turkey or chicken. The use of slightly stale bread is optimal, making it an economical way of using up leftover bread. The sauce is easy to make and uses readily available ingredients. Bread sauce can be traced back to at least as early as the medieval period, when cooks used bread as a thickening agent for sauces. The utilisation of bread in this way probably comes from cooks wanting to use up their stale bread who discovered that it could be incorporated within sauces to make them thicker.

This peltast holds three javelins, one in his throwing hand and two in his pelte (shield) hand as additional ammunition. A peltast ( ) was a type of light infantry, originating in Thrace and Paeonia, who often served as skirmishers in Hellenic and Hellenistic armies. In the Medieval period, the same term was used for a type of Byzantine infantryman. Description =Pelte shield= Peltasts carried a crescent-shaped wicker shield called a pelte (; Latin: ) as their main protection, hence their name. According to Aristotle, the pelte was rimless and covered in goat- or sheepskin. Some literary sources imply that the shield could be round, but in art it is usually shown as crescent-shaped. It also appears in Scythian art and may have been a common type in Central Europe. The shield could be carried with a central strap and a handgrip near the rim or with just a central hand-grip. It may also have had a carrying strap (or guige), as Thracian peltasts slung their shields on their backs when evading the enemy. =Weapons= Peltasts' weapons consisted of several javelins (akontia), which may have had straps to allow more force to be applied to a throw. Development A peltast with the whole of his panoply (on a red-figure kylix) In the Archaic period, the Greek martial tradition had been focused almost exclusively on the heavy infantry, or hoplites. The style of fighting used by peltasts originated in Thrace, and the first Greek peltasts were recruited from the Greek cities of the Thracian coast. They are generally depicted on vases and in other images as wearing the typical Thracian costume, which includes the distinctive Phrygian cap made of fox-skin and with ear flaps. They also usually wear a patterned tunic, fawnskin boots and a long cloak, called a zeira, decorated with a bright, geometric, pattern. However, many mercenary peltasts were probably recruited in Greece. Some vases have also been found showing hoplites (men wearing Corinthian helmets, greaves and cuirasses, holding hoplite spears) carrying peltes. Often, the mythical Amazons (women warriors) are shown with peltast equipment. Peltasts gradually became more important in Greek warfare, in particular during the Peloponnesian War. Xenophon in the Anabasis describes peltasts in action against Persian cavalry at the Battle of Cunaxa in 401 BCE, where they were serving as part of the mercenary force of Cyrus the Younger. > Tissaphernes had not fled at the first charge (by the Greek troops), but had > instead charged along the river through the Greek peltasts. However he did > not kill a single man as he passed through. The Greeks opened their ranks > (to allow the Persian cavalry through) and proceeded to deal blows (with > swords) and throw javelins at them as they went through. Xenophon's description makes it clear that these peltasts were armed with swords, as well as javelins, but not with spears. When faced with a charge from the Persian cavalry, they opened their ranks and allowed the cavalry through while striking them with swords and hurling javelins at them.Xenophon. Anabasis. [1.10.7]. They became the main type of Greek mercenary infantry in the 4th century BCE. Their equipment was less expensive than that of traditional hoplites and would have been more readily available to poorer members of society. The Athenian general Iphicrates destroyed a Spartan phalanx in the Battle of Lechaeum in 390 BCE, using mostly peltasts. In the account of Diodorus Siculus, Iphicrates is credited with re-arming his men with long spears, perhaps in around 374 BCE. This reform may have produced a type of \\"peltast\\" armed with a small shield, a sword, and a spear instead of javelins. Some authorities, such as J.G.P. Best, state that these later \\"peltasts\\" were not truly peltasts in the traditional sense, but lightly armored hoplites carrying the pelte shield in conjunction with longer spears‚Äîa combination that has been interpreted as a direct ancestor to the Macedonian phalanx.Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica, XV.44 However, thrusting spears are included on some illustrations of peltasts before the time of Iphicrates and some peltasts may have carried them as well as javelins rather than as a replacement for them. As no battle accounts actually describe peltasts using thrusting spears, it may be that they were sometimes carried by individuals by choice (rather than as part of a policy or reform). The Lykian sarcophagas of Payava from about 400 BCE depicts a soldier carrying a round pelte, but using a thrusting spear overarm. He wears a pilos helmet with cheekpieces, but no armour. His equipment therefore resembles Iphicrates's supposed new troops. Fourth-century BCE peltasts also seem to have sometimes worn both helmets and linen armour. Alexander the Great employed peltasts drawn from the Thracian tribes to the north of Macedonia, particularly the Agrianoi. In the 3rd century BCE, peltasts were gradually replaced with thureophoroi infantrymen. Later references to peltasts may not in fact refer to their style of equipment as the word peltast became a synonym for mercenary. Anatolian peltasts A tradition of fighting with javelins, light shield and sometimes a spear existed in Anatolia and several contingents armed like this appeared in Xerxes I's army that invaded Greece in 480 BCE. For example, the Paphlagonians and Phrygians wore wicker helmets and native boots reaching halfway to the knee. They carried small shields, short spears, javelins and daggers.Herodotus. Histories [7:70] Peltasts in the Persian army From the mid-5th century BCE onwards, peltast soldiers began to appear in Greek depictions of Persian troops.Head, Duncan (1992), p40 They were equipped like Greek and Thracian peltasts, but were dressed in typically Persian army uniforms. They often carried a light axe, known as a sagaris, as a sidearm. It has been suggested that these troops were known in Persian as takabara and their shields as taka.Sekunda, Nicholas V (1988), p69. The Persians may have been influenced by Greek and Thracian peltasts. Another alternative source of influence would have been the Anatolian hill tribes, such as the Corduene, Mysians or Pisidians.Sekunda (1992), p. 24 In Greek sources, these troops were either called peltasts or peltophoroi (bearers of pelte). \\"Peltasts\\" in the Antigonid army In the Hellenistic period, the Antigonid kings of Macedon had an elite corps of native Macedonian \\"peltasts\\". However, this force should not be confused with the skirmishing peltasts discussed earlier. The \\"peltasts\\" were probably, according to F.W. Walbank, about 3,000 in number, although by the Third Macedonian War, this went up to 5,000 (most likely to accommodate the elite agema, which was a sub-unit in the 'peltast' corps). The fact that they are always mentioned as being in their thousands suggests that, in terms of organization, the 'peltasts' were organized into chiliarchies. This elite corps was most likely of the same status, of similar equipment and role as Alexander the Great's hypaspists. Within this corps of 'peltasts' was its elite formation, the Agema. These troops were used on forced marches by Philip V of Macedon, which suggests that they were lightly equipped and mobile. However, at the battle of Pydna in 168 BCE, Livy remarks on how the Macedonian 'peltasts' defeated the Paeligni and of how this shows the dangers of going directly at the front of a phalanx. Though it may seem strange for a unit that would fight in phalanx formation to be called 'peltasts', 'pelte' would not be an inappropriate name for a Macedonian shield. They may have been similarly equipped with the Iphicratean hoplites or peltasts, as described by Diodorus. Deployment Attic white- ground mug, 5th century BCE) Peltasts were usually deployed on the flanks of the phalanx, providing a link with any cavalry, or in rough or broken ground. For example, in the Hellenica, Xenophon writes 'When Dercylidas learned this (that a Persian army was nearby), he ordered his officers to form their men in line, eight ranks deep (the hoplite phalanx), as quickly as possible, and to station the peltasts on either wing along with the cavalry.Xenophon. Hellenica. [3.2.16]. They could also operate in support of other light troops, such as archers and slingers. Tactics When faced by hoplites, peltasts operated by throwing javelins at short range. If the hoplites charged, the peltasts would retreat. As they carried considerably lighter equipment than the hoplites, they were usually able to evade successfully, especially in difficult terrain. They would then return to the attack once the pursuit ended, if possible, taking advantage of any disorder created in the hoplites' ranks. At the Battle of Sphacteria, the Athenian forces included 800 archers and at least 800 peltasts. Thucydides, in the History of the Peloponnesian War, writes > They (the Spartan hoplites) themselves were held up by the weapons shot at > them from both flanks by the light troops. Though they (the hoplites) drove > back the light troops at any point in which they ran in and approached too > closely, they (the light troops) still fought back even in retreat, since > they had no heavy equipment and could easily outdistance their pursuers over > ground where, since the place had been uninhabited until then, the going was > rough and difficult.History of the Peloponnesian War [4.33] When fighting other types of light troops, peltasts were able to close more aggressively in melee, as they had the advantage of possessing shields, swords, and helmets. Medieval Byzantine peltast A type of infantryman called a peltast (peltastƒìs) is described in the Strategikon, a 6th-century AD military treatise associated with the early Byzantine emperor Maurice.Birkenmeier, p. 64. Peltasts were especially prominent in the Byzantine army of the Komnenian period in the late 11th and 12th centuries. Although the peltasts of Antiquity were light skirmish infantry armed with javelins, it is not safe to assume that the troops given this name in the Byzantine period were identical in function. Byzantine peltasts were sometimes described as \\"assault troops\\".Birkenmeier, p. 123. Byzantine peltasts appear to have been relatively lightly equipped soldiers capable of great battlefield mobility, who could skirmish but who were equally capable of close combat.Birkenmeier, p. 241. Their arms may have included a shorter version of the kontarion spear employed by contemporary Byzantine heavy infantry.Dawson, p. 59.

His archives and work materials have been acquired by the Fales Library at New York University (NYU). Early life and education  Richard Foreman was born in New York City, but he spent many of his formative years in Scarsdale, New York. At Scarsdale High School (SHS), from which he graduated in 1955, Foreman was heavily involved in the theater department. Two years after Arthur Miller‚Äôs original production premiered on Broadway, Foreman produced and directed The Crucible at SHS. A 2018 documentary produced by the Lower East Side Biography Project exposes Foreman's early motivations for pursuing work in the theater. Foreman suffered from extreme shyness as a child. According to the documentary, Foreman was too shy say his line, \\"oh here comes the Yule log,\\" in a second grade Christmas play, so the line was taken from him. Of this experience, Foreman says, \\"...I swear, at that point I said I'm going to show them. I'm going to do theater. I'm going to show them I can do it.\\"Penny Arcade, and Steve Zehentner. Richard Foreman, 28 Minute Biography from The Lower East Side Biography Project. Vimeo, Lower East Side Biography Project, 22 May 2018, vimeo.com/271303009. The documentary also reveals that Foreman was adopted -- a fact he did not discover until he was in his 30s. The name given to him by his birth mother was Edward L. Friedman. Foreman admits that his adoption might have contributed his feelings of being uncomfortable in his body and in the world. He says, \\"...my parents were very supportive, but nevertheless, I didn't feel that close to them in certain ways.\\" Richard Foreman went on to study at Brown University (B.A. 1959), and received an MFA in Playwriting from Yale School of Drama in 1962. As an undergraduate, he was instrumental in the formation of Production Workshop, Brown University's student theatre group, while taking part in other student theatre, including set-designing Brownbrokers' 1958 production of Down to Earth.Ellen Shaffer. \\"'Down to Earth' Offers Gaiety and Diversity\\", Pembroke Record [Providence, RI] 18 April 1958: 4. Web. 2 December 2011. In 1993, Brown presented him with an honorary doctorate.Gerald Rabkin, Richard Foreman, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999, p. 240. At Yale, Foreman studied under John Gassner, the drama critic and former literary manager at The Theatre Guild. In the Lower East Side Biography Project documentary, Foreman describes Gassner as a \\"very rigorous, wonderful teacher.\\" Although Gassner acknowledged Foreman's talents, he criticized his pupil for the repetitive nature of his work. Foreman has told this story on multiple occasions as a defining moment that led him to be able to reject the theatrical expectations of his teachers and predecessors and to take ownership of his writing style. In 1988, Foreman recalled, \\"He [Gassner] said that my one problem was that I tended to go for a big dramatic effect and would then repeat it and repeat its and repeat it. For a long time I tried to correct that until I realized, 'How silly. If that's what I want, I should turn it into an asset, or at least try to.'\\"In Their Own Words: Contemporary American Playwrights (New York: Theatre Communications Group, 1988), 39  Career  = Early career and artistic influences = Richard Foreman moved to New York City directly after graduating from Yale School of Drama and worked as a manager of apartment complexes. Before finding his footing as a theater practitioner, Foreman became an avid patron of New York's downtown experimental theater and film scene. Foreman described feeling \\"overwhelmed\\" upon seeing The Living Theatre's productions of The Connection and The Brig. Foreman also attended screenings of avant-garde filmmaker Jonas Mekas at The Living Theatre. Mekas' early cinematic work had a profound impact on Foreman. In The Lower East Side Biography Project documentary, Foreman states, \\"those [films] really got to me. I thought this is the most poetic, beautiful, creative art that I've seen Americans producing.\\" Foreman claims that, for a long time, he was too shy to introduce himself to Judith Malina and Julian Beck (the founders of The Living Theatre) or to Jonas Mekas, but fascinated by Mekas' work, Foreman and his wife, Amy Manheim, began following Mekas as he filmed various projects in New York. Foreman finally inserted himself into the avant-garde scene when police interrupted a screening and seized a copy of the 1963 film, Flaming Creatures, and charged Jonas Mekas, Ken Jacobs, and Florence Karpf for violating New York's obscenity laws. Foreman called Mekas, offering his help, and over the following years, Foreman and Mekas became close friends and collaborators. Through his connection to Jonas Mekas, Foreman became acquainted with architect and artist, George Maciunas. Foreman began working for Mekas and Maciunas, overseeing their movie theater, Film- Maker's Cinematheque at 80 Wooster Street. Foreman also became heavily involved in the development of Maciunas' Fluxhouse Cooperatives, which consisted of converted SoHo lofts designed to be living and working spaces for artists.‚ÄúRichard Foreman (SHS 1955).‚Äù Scarsdale Alumni Association, www.scarsdalealumni.org/richard_foreman_shs_1955. During the 1960s, Foreman also got to know theater director Robert Wilson, filmmaker and actor Jack Smith, and theater director and scholar Richard Schechner, all of whom encouraged Foreman to start producing his own work. With Schechner, Foreman formed a theater collective in 1968 called \\"A Bunch of Experimental Theaters of New York Inc,\\" which included seven theater companies: Mabou Mines, The Manhattan Project, Meredith Monk/The House, The Performance Group, The Ridiculous Theatrical Company, Section Ten, and Foreman's company, Ontological-Hysteric Theatre. From this point on, Foreman began producing works under the moniker \\"Ontological-Hysteric.\\"  Influence of Gertrude Stein  A number of scholars have called attention to the parallels between the theories of Gertrude Stein and Richard Foreman's theatrical aesthetics. Foreman himself has spoken about the significance of her writings to his work. In 1969, Foreman declared, \\"Gertrude Stein obviously was doing all kinds of things we haven't event caught up to yet.\\"Davy, Kate. ‚ÄúRichard Foreman's Ontological-Hysteric Theatre: The Influence of Gertrude Stein.‚Äù Twentieth Century Literature, vol. 24, no. 1, 1978, pp. 108‚Äì126. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/441069. Kate Davy analyzes Stein's influence on Foreman in her article, Richard Foreman's Ontological-Hysteric Theatre: The Influence of Gertrude Stein. The primary connection between the works of Stein and Foreman, she proposes, is the writers' conception of consciousness in writing. Stein preferred \\"entity writing\\" over \\"identity writing.\\" According to Stein's model, \\"entity writing\\" is \\"the 'thing-in-itself' detached from time and association, while identity is the 'thing-in-relation,' time-bound, clinging in association.\\" \\"Entity writing\\" is free from any notion of remembering, relationships, or narratives, and it expresses what Stein called the \\"continuous present.\\" Stein's method of writing is meditative practice that requires the writer's \\"deliberate detachment of oneself from the external world while documenting one's own consciousness in the act of writing.\\" Therefore, this type of writing is said to reflect the workings of the writer's mind in its presentation. Stein adopted this theory of the \\"continuous present\\" to her work as a playwright. She abandoned the theatrical conventions of narrative structure in favor of a theatrical experience that focuses on the real-time consciousness -- one in which \\"the spectator can move 'out' of the composition, or stop, at any moment without creating syncopated emotional time.\\" Foreman's theatrical experiences invoke Stein's theories in that they both abandon narrative, focusing on the here-and-now, and they seem to include Foreman's \\"process of making the play\\" in the presentation of the play. In his essay, \\"How I Write My (Self: Plays),\\" Foreman explains his process of taking text to performance: \\"The writing tending towards a more receptive, open, passive receiving of 'what wants to be written' and the staging tending towards more active organization of the 'arrived' elements of the writing -- finding ways to make the writing inhabit a constructed environment.\\"Richard Foreman, \\"How I Write My (Self: Plays),\\" The Drama review, 21, no. 5 (Dec 1977), 6. The text, therefore, creates a sense that the writer's consciousness, or process of writing, never leaves the work, throughout the staging and performance process. Davy notes that like Stein, Foreman tends to avoid \\"'emotional traps' or the intentional manipulation of an audiences emotional responses by eliminating the 'lifelike' qualities of drama (clearly developing situation involving imaginary people in imaginary places), thereby creating a world into which the spectator has great difficulty projecting himself.\\" Davy gives the example of Foreman's characters often referring to themselves in the third person, which creates an alienating effect for the audience member who cannot project themself into the experience of the character. Through Foreman's alienating characterization, the audience is made to look at Foreman's actors as \\"self-enclosed units,\\" or theatrical props, rather than characters. Therefore, Foreman's aesthetics demand that the spectator not escape into the play, but become conscious of their own process of interpretation. In Foreman's essay, \\"14 Things I Tell Myself,\\" he elaborates, \\"Our art then = a learning how to look at 'A' and 'B' and see not them but a relation that cannot be 'seen.' You can't look at 'it' (that relation) because it IS the looking itself. That's where he looking (you) is, doing the looking.\\"Richard Foreman, \\"14 Things I Tell Myself,\\" Tel Quel, No. 2 (Fall 1976), 87. Davy points out that \\"by eliminating internal punctuation in long complicated sentences,\\" Stein's writing produces a similar effect for her readers who have to actively take part in discerning Stein's words. = Ontological-Hysteric Theatre = The Ontological-Hysteric Theater (OHT) was founded by Foreman in 1968. Foreman mounted his first productions with OHT at the Film-Maker's Cinematheque on Wooster Street, where he worked under George Maciunas. The theater's current home is 131 E 10th St. at St. Marks in Manhattan. According to OHT's website, the company was founded with the mission \\"of stripping the theater bare of everything but the singular and essential impulse to stage the static tension of interpersonal relations in space. The OHT seeks to produce works that balance a primitive and minimal style with extremely complex and theatrical themes. The core of the company's annual programming is Richard Foreman's theater pieces, of which he has made over 50 in the last 42 years.\\" OHT's first productions, Angelface (1968) and Ida-Eyed (1969), received almost no critical attention. By the mid 1970s, however, OHT gained traction with relatively popular works such as Sophia = (Wisdom) Part 3: The Cliffs (1972). In his 1973 essay, \\"Richard Foreman's Ontological-Hysteric Theatre,\\" Michael Kirby aptly breaks down the aesthetics of OHT through the case study of Foreman's important play, Sophia = (Wisdom) Part 3: The Cliffs. He uses the elements of setting, picturization, speech, written material, control, movement and dances, sound, objects, relation to film, structure, content, and effect to analyze Foreman's theatrical vocabulary.Kirby, Michael. ‚ÄúRichard Foreman's Ontological-Hysteric Theatre.‚Äù The Drama Review: TDR, vol. 17, no. 2, 1973, pp. 5‚Äì32. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1144806. Among his observations, Kirby notes that although \\"Sophia\\" is a play without a plot, it produces its own kind of structure of \\"thematic webs of visual and verbal ideas and references.\\" Foreman achieves this visual structure through \\"picturization.' By picturization, Kirby means that Foreman's staging is presented as \\"sequences of static pictures\\" in which the actors adjust themselves into tableaux as opposed to moving continuously throughout the play. Kirby also notes that Foreman makes use of written text that is projected on screens on the set. These projected words, Kirby describes, are both direct addresses to the spectator and \\"expository information\\". Kirby also writes about how Foreman literally controlled the pace and tempo of every performance of \\"Sophia.\\" During the performance, Foreman would sit at a table in front of the stage, controlling the projections and sound cues. By acting as stage manager, Foreman was able to insert himself into he performance as it unfolded. Kirby also discusses the role of sound in Foreman's plays. He writes, \\"Noise, too, serves as both background and as an explicit part of the action.\\" At times, recordings of lines take over for the actors' actual voice, creating a sense of alienation.  Ontological-Hysteric Incubator  The Ontological- Hysteric Theater prides itself on nurturing the talents of young and emerging theater practitioners. According to their website, \\"the OHT was a starting point for many artists making their mark in New York City and internationally including David Herskovitz, Artistic Director of Target Margin Theater, Damon Keily Artistic Director of American Theater in Chicago, Radiohole, Elevator Repair Service, Pavol Liska, NTUSA, as well as Richard Maxwell, Sophie Haviland, Bob Cucuzza, DJ Mendel, Ken Nintzle and Young Jean Lee.\\" In 1993, OHT began their emerging artists program by initiating the Blueprint Series for emerging directors. In 2005, OHT reorganized their emerging artists program under the name INCUBATOR, \\"creating a series of linked programs to provide young theater artists with resources and support to develop process- oriented, original theatrical productions.\\" The INCUBATOR programs include a residency program, two annual music festivals, a regular concert series, a serial work-in-progress program called Short Form, and roundtables and salons. The program received an OBIE grant in 2010. = Collaborations and work outside of the Ontological-Hysteric Theatre = Foreman's work has been primarily produced by and performed at the Ontological-Hysteric Theater in New York, though he has gained acclaim as director for such productions as Bertolt Brecht's The Threepenny Opera at Lincoln Center and the premiere of Suzan-Lori Parks's Venus at the Public Theater. Foreman's plays have been co-produced by The New York Shakespeare Festival, La Mama Theatre, The Wooster Group, the Festival d'Autumn in Paris and the Vienna Festival. He has collaborated (as librettist and stage director) with composer Stanley Silverman on 8 music theater pieces produced by The Music Theater Group & The New York City Opera. He wrote and directed the feature film Strong Medicine. He has also directed and designed many classical productions with major theaters around the world including, The Threepenny Opera, The Golem and plays by V√°clav Havel, Botho Strauss, and Suzan-Lori Parks for The New York Shakespeare Festival, Die Fledermaus at the Paris Opera, Don Giovanni at the Opera de Lille, Philip Glass's Fall of the House of Usher at the American Repertory Theater and The Maggio Musicale in Florence, Woyzeck at Hartford Stage Company, Moli√®re's Don Juan at the Guthrie Theater and The New York Shakespeare Festival, Kathy Acker's Birth of the Poet at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the RO theater in Rotterdam, Gertrude Stein's Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights at the Autumn Festivals in Berlin and Paris. Seven collections of his plays have been published, and books studying his work have been published in English, French, and German. In 2004, Foreman established the Bridge Project with Sophie Haviland to promote international art exchange between countries around the world through workshops, symposiums, theater productions, visual art, performance and multimedia events.

It borders China at the Khunjerab Pass and Afghanistan at the Chipurson valley. In 2019, Gojal Valley became the second Sub-Division within the Hunza District. It is geographically the largest Sub-Division of the Gilgit- Baltistan region of Pakistan. Gojal, also known as Upper Hunza, is composed of a number of large and small valleys sharing borders with Central Hunza in the South, China in the north-east and Afghanistan in the north-west. Aeenabad is the first village of Gojal, Upper Hunza. Except for the Shimshal, Misgar and Chipursan valleys, all the villages of Gojal, Upper Hunza can be seen from the Karakorum Highway (KKH), which crosses Gojal, entering China at the Khunjerab Pass. The Gojal region has 20,000 Ismaili residents.  History  The valleys and villages of Gojal were settled over time by people from surrounding regions. Kirghiz nomads initially used the areas in Upper Gojal as winter pastures. Wakhis migrated from Wakhan to this region, the Yishkuk (Chipursun) valley, the Avgarch area of Gircha and Sost villages were settled in the upper Gojal while in the lower Gojal is considered an ancient settlement. When Hunza was under the Central Government of Gilgit the Ishkook settlement was wealthy and paid cattle and other dairy products to the Raja of Gilgit. As Hunza emerged as an independent state during the early 15th century so it can be inferred that different valleys in upper Gojal were inhabited by the Wakhi speaking migrants prior to the emergence of the Hunza state. Later, the oral history holds, a catastrophic flood destroyed the Ishkook settlement during the 18th century. The dominance of Central Hunza or Kanjud became significant during Mir Shah Salim Khan's period (1790-1824). Mir Shah Salim Khan was raised by his foster mother lady Gulbahar wife of Ashoor of the Buduley family of Gulmit Gojal. Lady Gulbahar was the daughter of the Qazi of Wakhan Qazi Makhtum. When Shah Salim Khan became the Mir of Hunza he paid attention to expansion of the settlements of Gulkin and Gulmit and initiated the resettlement of Chipusan to increase revenue. One of the wives of Mir Salim Khan Princes Khushal Begum was the daughter of Qalam Ashqagha of Siriqol. Khushal Begum was gifted agriculture and grazing land and rights over collection of taxes from settlements in Siriqol by her father. Through this the state of Hunza extended its control to the areas of Siriqol. From Khushal Begum Mir Salim Khan had a son named Shah Abdullah Khan who was the youngest amongst five other sons of the Mir. Mir Shah Salim Khan died in 1824 in Gulmit. After the death of Mir Shah Salim Khan his elder son Shah Ghazanfar Khan (1824-1864) became the Mir of Hunza. Mir Shah Ghazanfar deputed his younger brother Shah Abdullah Khan as the Governor of Gojal and also assigned him the additional responsibility of the Commander of the forces of Hunza. It was this time when the resettlement of Chipursan valley was materialized by moving families from Gulmit, Gulkin, Hussaini and Passu villages and bringing major parcels of land under irrigation. Other new areas in Gojal that were brought under irrigation were Abdullah Khan Abad, Zar Khan and Zar Abad. Shah Abdullah Khan was based in Gulkin and the adjacent areas of Jalalabad, Shah Abad, Shah Mal and Yashbandan were part of his personal jagir. During this period Hunza emerged as a regional power and extended its borders to Siriqol, Yarqand and Wakhan. The Wakhi people of Gojal emerged as warriors and took part in many wars. The forces of Hunza fought and won wars against Khojas, Kyrghiz and Badkhshan. During Abdullah Khan's period Gojal emerged as a strong hold and the center became increasingly dependent both for its revenue and military power on Gojal. This increasing dependency on Gojal and increasing power of Abdullah Khan was seen as a threat by many in the center which resulted the murder of Abdullah Khan by prince Ghazan Khan, the elder son of Mir Shah Ghazanfar with support from a group of killers from Altit and Karimabad. Ghazan Khan later murdered his father Mir Shah Ghazanfar also and became the Mir of Hunza. Abdullah Khan had five children including one daughter and four sons. The daughter named Mirona was the eldest amongst all and was married in his father's lifetime in Siriqol. Amongst his sons the eldest was Ali Parast who was married to Princes Bi Bi Aftab, the daughter of Mir Shah Ghazanfar and was given Jagir in Hyderabad Hunza by Mir Shah Ghazafar however later during Ghazan Khan II's period migrated to Passu, others were Muhammad Bari, Ali Fatah and Abdullah Beg. Muhammad Bari migrated to China with Mir Safdar Khan during the British invasion of Hunza in 1891. Ali Fatah was settled in Ghulkin and Abdullah Beg in Chipusan. After the death of Mir Shah Salim Khan who was the first ever Ismaili in Hunza, Shah Ghazanfar and Abdullah Khan were amongst the few people in Hunza who got exposure to the Ismaili faith and became Ismaili during the first half of the 1800s. Mir Shah Salim Khan accepted the Ismaili faith as a result of the discussions with an Ismaili missionary Said Shah Ardabil during his visit to Gulmit. Mir Shah Salim was the first person in Hunza whose funeral was performed as per the Ismaili Tariqah and Chiragh-i-Roshan was performed for the first time in history of Hunza for him in Gulmit. In the later part of the 1800s a major land slide near Sarat village blocked river Hunza and in three years time a major lake was formed which inundated major parts of the villages of Gulmit, Hussaini and Passu. Major portion of the fertile land and orchards came under the lake. Most recently in 2010 another major land slide occurred in the same area in Attababad village which again inundated parts of Shiskat, Ayeenabad and Gulmit. = Shishkat = Shishkat is also known as Nazimabad Shishkat is the first village of Gojal valley which borders Gojal with Hunza. The total population of the village is 2,160 individuals living within 220 households. This is dominantly a Burushaski speaking village. However, a sizable population of Wakhi and Domaaki speakers also live in the village. The village was settled down in 1903 during the reign of Mir Nazim Khan. Before this the barren lands were used as grazing land of the Gulmit village. Some Wakhi households from Gulmit also permanently settled down in Shishkat while the Burushaski and Domaaki people migrated from Central Hunza. The village also has historical significance because this was the battle ground between the Wakhi population above Gulmit and the state of Nagar and Hunza. = Gulmit - The Sub-Division Headquarters = Gulmit is the administrative headquarters of the Gojal Sub-Division. Gulmit is a centuries-old historic town, with mountains, peaks and glaciers. It is a tourist spot and has many hotels, shops and a museum. It is located above the sea level. Gulmit consists of small hamlets called Kamaris, Odver, Dalgiram, Laksh, Kalha, Shawaran, Khor Lakhsh, Chamangul and Goze. Gulmit is home to around 4,000 people, all of them Wakhi- speakers and followers of the Ismaili school of thought of Shia Islam. A view of Gulmit during autumn season Before 1974, when Hunza was a state, Gulmit used to be the Summer Capital of the state. After the abolition of the state it became the Tehsil's seat of government. The oldest intact house in Gulmit is more than six centuries old. There are six Jama'at Khana or religious community centres in Gulmit. One notices their presence in every ward of the village. The old Summer Palace of Mir of Hunza stands at the northern edge of Gulmit's historic Polo Ground. Old mosques, now used as libraries, also adorn the beautiful physique of Gulmit valley. Among new buildings constructed by the government in Gulmit are Tehsil Headquarters, Federal Government's Boys High School, Civil Hospital, Diamond Jubilee Girls Middle School and Government Girls Higher Secondary School. Al- Amyn Model School, a community- based organization, has a beautiful building standing next to the Health Center of Aga Khan Health Services. = Settlement of Passu = Passu is located with 125 km from Gilgit on the KKH near the border of China and is surrounded by the mountains of the Karakoram range. Its neighbourhood also includes two large glaciers: Batura and Passu Glacier. It is one of the most dangerous places to live in due to the continuous threat of floods and has been flooded four times in the past. Passu is also one of the most ancient villages in the area. According to archeologists, the first human settlement in the area dates back to 3000 BC or 5000 BC. There are many ancient rock carvings of ibex and zebra on several rocks, showing that ibexes have been around in the valley for many millennia, but the area no longer houses zebras. the only other wildlife here are snow leopards and yaks. In the second settlement era, Chinese Buddhists lived here. The buddhists of Gandahara, Swat, Gilgit, and Passu travelled from via this valley to go to China. Records of this settlement and subsequent migration are found in Karga Gilgit and Khurramabad Passu. The third settlement in the history of this valley is the Islamic era. Islam came to this area in the ninth century when Arab soldiers and traders ventured to these parts of the world. Quranic verses were etched in the mountains around the valley during this era. The fourth era was also Islamic, which was settled here in the 18th century. This time, the area boasted a vibrant populace of 315 families. However, this village was destroyed by a natural disaster with a landslide and the nearby river was blocked. Only a few families remained safe by the landslide. This village was destroyed once again in 1964 when the population was forced into migration by the flooding of the Shimshal river and erosion around the river bank. This time around too, the village had some 300 houses. The majority of Passu's native population recognises its ancestor as a man named Quli, who had come from Wakhan in the 15th century. In his memory, the people of Passu are also known as Quli-kuts or kutor. The quli-kuts tribe has also inhabited Karimabad, Murtazabad and many other villages of central Hunza. The quli-kuts in central Hunza later adopted the Burushu way of life and now speak the Burushaski language. Most of the families migrated to chapurson and Khyber. Among the current inhabitants of Passu are seven families: the Alvi, Mughani, Dinali, Sakhi, Quba, and Parasti also called Miron. Parasti or Miron are descendants of Shah Abdullah Khan son of Mir Shah Salim Khan of Hunza. The family is named after Ali Parast, the elder son of Shah Abdullah Khan, who moved to Passu from Shahabad Hyderabad in the 1870s. During Mir Shah Ghazanfar's time Abdullah Khan was deputed as the governor of gojal and commander in chief of the forces of Hunza to protect the northern frontiers. In 1941 the people of Passu under the leadership of Muhammad Adab Khan son of Ali Parast mobilised a revolt against the heavy taxes imposed by Mir Ghazan Khan II on the people of Gojal. The government of India intervened and through the local administration of Gilgit agency the issue was resolved by reducing the taxes to the minimum level. The latest figures put the population of Passu around 1,000. = Ghulkin Gojal = Ghulkin Village is located in Gojal. It is reached by following the Karakoram Highway (KKH) 140 km north of Gilgit. This trip takes 3‚Äì4 hours by van. From a turn-off just beyond Gulmit, a winding jeep track leads upwards for 3 km, until the ground flattens out and the first houses of the village come into view.Ghulkin Glacier Ghulkin occupies the site of an old glacier fed lake, which has been silted up by continuous sedimentation. Many of the 140 traditional dwellings that constitute Ghulkin village are arranged in a circular form, facing the one-time shores of the lake, creating a wonderfully communal atmosphere. The central area now supports several dwellings and fields, including a strip of land often used as a cricket pitch. There is no accurate historical record of the origin of the village, though it is estimated to be around 700 years old. According to local folklore, there were settlements here while the lake was still in existence, this area being used as pastureland in summer. The name is derived from two words of the local Wakhi dialect, 'Ghulk', meaning 'well' and 'kin', meaning 'whose'. Being an area of low rainfall, the most vital requirement is water for irrigation, livestock, drinking and domestic use. Khawaja Ahmed, and Ismaili Muslims who came here with the Mir of Hunza, asked him for land. After the Mir agreed, Khawaja Ahmed mobilised the people of the area to construct a water-channel to irrigate the land. This made cultivation possible and the Ismaili settlement flourished. Now small scale health and educational institutions, electricity and water-sully facilities are available in the village. Through the involvement of capacity-building NGOs, there is also a handicraft production centre and opportunities for other vocational training. The Jama'at Khana, the central religious institution for all Ismaili Muslims, holds a strong position in the community. Apart from its religious functions, it provides a central location for community meetings, festivals, celebrations, resolution of disputes and other community activities. In Upper Hunza, winters are long and can become bitterly cold. Snowfall brings with it the Siberian ibex, descending in search of grass under the snow cover. Summers are hot in the north, though more pleasant than the harsh temperatures in summer are around 30 ¬∞C. In winter the temperature remains below freezing point, further dropping at night. = Hussaini = Hussaini village on Attabad Lake village is one of the new settlements of the Wakhi people in the Gojal valley. Hussaini is surrounded by the Ghulkin Glacier and the Khunjarav River and the Karakorum Highway passes through the middle of the village. People: The residents of Hussaini are ethnically Wakhi and speak Xikwor or Wakhi language. Most of the residents are from the passu village of Sahki family and few are from Broghil chitral known as Musofeer,s - Religion: The people of Hussaini like all other people in Gojal are followers of the Ismaili school of thought in Islam. Tourist Attractions: Hussaini Suspension Bridge, Borith Lake Ghulkin, Zarabod and Sultan e Shahtalib (decades old shrine of a saint) are famous tourist attractions of the Hussaini village of Gojal valley. =Avgarch= One of the oldest strongholds of the Wakhis against the Kirghiz and other invaders is located in a valley starting at Murkhun. There are two forts, namely Pasth Qlha and Wuch Qlha, an Ismaili mosque and Watch towers in Avgarch. These historic sites are still in use. Baba Sufi is considered one of the first to settle in Gojal along with his wife. He settled by the spring of Gircha but abandoned it from the fear of looters, his clan later kept using Gircha as a fertile land and took the crops back to Avgarch. The settler of Shimshal, Mamu Singh also went through the Avgarch and Qorun Pass. Legends say his wife was also from Avegarch. Later Mir Silum Khan of Hunza convinced people to settle Gircha and use Avgarch for one season. During the invasion of the British the people from all lower Gojal and Hunza, took shelter in Avgarch. Later British came to Avgarch and asked people to go back to their home with assured safety. Avgarch is one a tourist attraction with a 1.5 hour hike from the KKH, She offers beautiful pastures and hamlets, glaciers and peaks, yosinband, Old graves of Kirghiz, the oldest Juniper tree of Hunza the Baltar Yarz, Boibar valley, Priyar and the famous Qorun pass. =Gircha= A spring village, by the KKH is one of the first settled lands in Gojal. Settled by Wakhi legend Bobo e Sufi, his generation used this land to just to grow crops for long, then a fort was built in Gircha which became the centre of political activities for Mirs, sarai for travelers/explorers and Ismaili Missionaries. Gircha has a geographical significance as there are proofs that provide unique litho- and biofacies which has led to the termGircha formation. Gircha has been flooded multiple times, woods etc. can be seen in the sediments made visible by recent erosion. A flood from Dilboy stopped the Khunjerav River which eroded the old village and fort. People relocated the fort but the erosion continued and people had settle new villages nearby, namely; Sost, Nazimabad, Murkun, Jamalabad and Ghalapan. Residents include the Bobo Sufi clan, further divided into Rumi kutor, Posh kutor and Arbob kutor, some Wakhi later inhabited the place and are called khik kutor, in era of Mir Nazim Burushaski families were also settled. Gircha remains a centre of interest for visitors around the world, there are various springs which run the villages activities, fossils, corals, sea shells, the oldest mosque and school of the region, historic houses, and traditions. The village is self sufficient due to its own electric power house, vocational center, and the first and only veterinary and trout fish farm are also found in here. =Sost= Sost is the last border town of Pakistan which leads the KKH to China through Khunjerab. Sost is the center of activities in upper Gojal with office of Assistant Magistrate, an established bazaar, a dry port, customs and other official setups. Sost is also an old village, with a diverse population. An old house related to Bobo e Sufi is visitable, a Shrine of Saint Baba Sheikh Farid, brother of Shah Shams and Shah Talib is a place of interest for visitor. In 1985 a long tunnel was dug by locals with the supervision of AKRSP to irrigate the pasture of Sost, which was named Hussainabad. Sost comprises four settlements known as Nazimabad, Center Sost, Afiyatabad (Known as Sost Bazar) and Hussainabad. Nazimabad Nazimabad is a village in Sost settled in 1910. The initial settlement started with the orders of Mir of Hunza, Mir Nazim Khan and hence the name Nazimabad was emerged. This village is a diverse population of nearly 800 inhabitants including Burushaski and Wakhi speakers. Chapursan (Wakhi: ⁄ÜŸæŸàÿ±ÿ≥ŸÜ; also spelt Chipurson, Chipurson, Chaporsan, Chupurson) is a valley containing some eight scattered villages within the Hunza District of Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. It is the most Northern part of Pakistan, bordering Afghanistan and China. The majority of the people in the valley speak the Wakhi Language, but the villagers of Raminj speak the Burushaski language and belong to the Ismaili sect of Islam.[citation needed] Chipurson Valley hosts over 500 households with a population of 3,000.  Geography  Geographically Gojal, Upper Hunza is located between 70 latitude and 61 and is spread over an area of 10,873 km2 of land, at an elevation ranging from 2,340m to 4,877m above sea level. Gojal is a mountainous region forming the western part of the Karakoram and Eastern Pamir mountain range. This area also hosts the 56 km long Batura glacier the third longest of Pakistan (after Hispar and Biafo). The region is home to lofty ice-capped peaks, roaring rivers, lush green pastures and long glaciers.  Villages  The main villages of this district include: Shishkat (now Nazeemabad, also called Trapur), Gulmit, Ghulkin, Husseini (older names Sisoni/Ghusani), Borith, Passu, Shimshal, Khyber, Ghalapan, Morkhoon, Jamalabad, Gircha, Sost, Khudaabad, Misgar, Yarzerech, Raminj, Kirmin, Khill, Rasht, Shersabz, Ispenj, Shitmerg and Zoodkhoon.  Administration  Gulmit, the winter-capital of the then Hunza state until 1974, is the main town (tehsil headquarters) and seat of government, while Sost is the border check-post and gateway for Pakistan- China overland trade. The entire region is governed by bureaucrats, sitting in Gilgit. Law and order is supported by two police stations and a magistrate.  Poets  Upper Hunza is home to some amazing poets. Among the poets are Nazir Ahmad Bulbul, Saif uddin Saif, Rehmat Ullah Mushfiq, Afzal Karim and many more. Most of these poets write in the Wakhi language.  Tourist sites  =Shishkat= Shishkat is one of the beautiful places in Gojal. It is the first village of Gojal valley, coming from the South. The famous Attabad lake, also known as Gojal Lake is also located in Shishat and Gulmit village. The Attabad Lake came into being after the village of Attabad was destroyed by a massive landslide on 4 January 2010. The landslide blocked the Hunza River gorge and formed a lake which, at its peak, stretched from the Attabad barrier to Passu, almost 24 kilometers long. The people of Shishkat are also famous for their hospitality. Lupghar Sar is 109th on the list of world tallest mountains. It is located in Shishkat village of the Gojal valley. It is part of the Momhail Sar cluster of mountains and has an elevation of 7,200 metres (23,622 ft) above sea level. In the Wakhi language Lupghar Sar translates as \\"the top of the big rock\\".

In normal use, a much smaller section of the lens is used, so that the distortion is much smaller. Progressive lenses, also called multifocal lenses, progressive addition lenses (PAL), varifocal lenses, progressive power lenses, graduated prescription lenses, or progressive spectacle lenses are corrective lenses used in eyeglasses to correct presbyopia and other disorders of accommodation. They are characterised by a gradient of increasing lens power, added to the wearer's correction for the other refractive errors. The gradient starts at the wearer's distance prescription at the top of the lens and reaches a maximum addition power, or the full reading addition, at the bottom of the lens. The length of the progressive power gradient on the lens surface depends on the design of the lens, with a final addition power between 0.75 and 3.50 dioptres. The addition value prescribed depends on the level of presbyopia of the patient. In general the older the patient, the higher the addition. History The first patent for a PAL was British Patent 15,735, granted to Owen Aves with a 1907 priority date. This patent included the manufacturing process and design which was however never commercialized. Unlike modern PALs, it consisted of a conical back surface and a cylindrical front with opposing axis in order to create a power progression. While there were several intermediate steps (H. Newbold appears to have designed a similar lens to Aves around 1913), there is evidenceBennett A. (1973) Variable and Progressive power lenses. Manufacturing Optics Int. Mar, 137‚Äì141. to suggest that Duke Elder in 1922 developed the world's first commercially available PAL (Ultrifo) sold by \\"Gowlland of Montreal\\". This was based on an arrangement of aspherical surfaces. The Carl Zeiss AG & Varilux lenses were the first PAL of modern design. Bernard Maitenaz, patented Varilux in 1953, and the product was introduced in 1959 by Soci√©t√© des Lunetiers (Now Essilor). The first Varilux lenses' surface structure was however still close to a bifocal lens, with an upper, aberration-free half of the surface for far vision and a rather large \\"segment\\" for clear near vision. The breakthrough in user adaptation and comfort, as well as peripheral and dynamic vision however occurred in 1972 with the introduction of Varilux 2, for which Maitenaz created a totally aspheric design and manufacturing process.\\"Progressive Memories & Calculus\\" Carl Zeiss AG developed freeform technology in 1983 with its own patented progressive series Gradal HS Early progressive lenses were relatively crude designs. Right and left were identical variable power lenses with distance and reading power centers in the upper and lower part of the lens, respectively. The glazing was made to accommodate eye position changes from distance viewing to reading. The point of reading is about 14 mm below and 2 mm to the nasal side in comparison to distance viewing. By tilting the reading power towards the nasal side in perfect symmetry, appropriate reading power was given to the wearer. The symmetric design, however, was difficult to accept for patients, because the eyes in general work asymmetrically. When you look right, your right eye view distal and left nasal. Modern sophisticated progressive lenses are designed asymmetrically for greater patient acceptance and include special designs to cater to many separate types of wearer application: for example progressive addition lenses may be designed with distance to intermediate or intermediate to near prescriptions specifically for use as an occupational lens, or to offer enlarged near and intermediate view areas. The typical progressive lens is produced from a so-called semi-finished lens. The semi- finished lens is molded with an asymmetrical power pattern on the front. On the back side a custom surfacing is made to adjust the power for each patient. This method is however problematic, especially for astigmatic prescriptions. The reason being that the semi-finished front pattern is designed for a spherical prescription. Freeform designs are tailored to each prescription and do not have this problem. Since the 1980s, manufacturers have been able to minimize unwanted aberrations by: * Improvements in mathematical modeling of surfaces, allowing greater design control. * Extensive wearer trials. * Improved lens manufacturing and measurement technology. Today the complex surfaces of a progressive lens can be cut and polished on computer-controlled machines, allowing 'freeform surfacing', as opposed to the earlier casting process, thus explaining the difference in price. In short, the price is based on the technology used and the year the lens came to market. Advantages and use * Compared to single vision lenses, progressive lenses provide the correction required for a presbyopic patient to see clearly at all viewing distances, typically adjusted by tilting the head slightly. * Progressive addition lenses avoid the discontinuities (image-jumps) sometimes found with bifocal and trifocal lenses * Some people find them more cosmetically attractive. Because bifocals and related designs are associated with old age, proponents have suggested the lack of visible lines makes a progressive lens appear similar to the single vision lenses worn before the onset of presbyopia. Disadvantages Peripheral Distortion: Progressive lenses suffer regions of aberrations and geometric distortions in the periphery, leading to poor vision when turning the eyes down and to the sides. Different brands of progressive lenses have more or less of this distortion. Fitting: Progressive lenses require careful placement relative to the wearer's pupil centre for a distance-viewing reference position. Incorrect specification of the fitting location can cause problems for the wearer including (depending on the design of the lens) narrow fields of view, clear vision in one eye only, on-axis blur, and the need to alter the natural head position in order to see clearly. Cost: Progressive lenses are more expensive than bifocal and single-vision lenses due to higher manufacturing and fitting costs. Some research has been conducted to reduce the fabrication cost by precision injection molding. When recommending a progressive lens design, an eyecare practitioner will usually ask the customer some questions about their lifestyle, which coupled with prescription restrictions or recommendations and cost can establish the suitability of various models of progressive lens. Different lenses have different glazing restrictions, lens material availabilities, maximum and minimum fitting heights, prescription ranges and as such the variation in quality between higher and lower end varifocal lenses is considerable.  Miscellaneous  *For those new to progressive lenses, an accommodation period is often required because the brain needs to learn to adapt to them.Aves O. (1908) Improvements in and relating to Multifocal lenses and the like, and the method of Grinding Same. GB Patent 15,735. This period varies from a few hours for some individuals up to around two weeks.Progressive Addition Lenses: History, Design, Wearer Satisfaction and Trends Pope, D R OSA TOPS Vol. 35, Vision Science and Its Applications, 2000 During this period, side effects can include headache and dizziness. It is advised that, when these symptoms set in, the progressive lenses be removed for a short period and replaced after symptoms have subsided. Returning to an older prescription or different type of lens design (bifocal, trifocal) only serves to increase the adaptation period to the progressive lenses. Some wearers find the visual discomfort caused by these distortions outweigh the benefits of wearing PALs; this is known as progressive non-tolerance. However, manufacturers claim acceptance rates of 90%‚Äì98%. *Depth perception and distance estimation can be influenced during the adaptation period.

Mojo originated in the Canary Islands, where the main varieties are red mojo (mojo rojo) and green mojo (mojo verde). Other countries have recipes similar to mojo, where acid ingredients such as vinegar, lemon, orange, or lime juice may be used.  Canarian mojo  = Typology = Green mojo, or mojo containing green spices, is commonly used for fish, especially the proper green mojo (made with green pepper) but also coriander mojo (mojo de cilantro) and parsley mojo (mojo de perejil). As coriander mojo and parsley mojo contain some water, they need to be kept in the fridge and have to be consumed within the two days after preparation. Red mojo, made of small red peppers from La Palma (called pimienta picona) and paprika, is usually eaten with meat. Red and green mojo can be used interchangeably to season some dishes, prominently papas arrugadas con salsa mojo, or potatoes with mojo. Mojo is also commonly served with fresh bread rolls at the beginning of a meal. = Preparation = To prepare red mojo it is necessary to dry the peppers. Once dry, peppers can be kept for a long time before preparation. Before making mojo, peppers are soaked in water so they lose their spiciness. Then, grains and fibers are removed but for a few that will make the mojo spicy. In the case of green mojo, spiciness will be regulated by the amount of garlic, and can be also intensified by adding ground coriander seeds. = Canarian variations = Local variations of mojo include recipes with cheese such as mojo con queso (mojo with cheese) from La Palma and El Hierro, as well as almogrote from La Gomera, where it is turned it into a paste that can be spread over bread. Every Canarian family has its own recipe for mojo, so it can vary greatly in flavour, spiciness and texture. There is also almond mojo which is an ideal accompaniment to various roasted dishes. Saffron mojo, whose main ingredient is Canarian saffron, tastes excellent with all kinds of fried cheese. Garlic mojo is ideal to put on pizza. Herb mojo is made of mixed spices and is ideal for all kinds of salad.  International variations  Similar sauces, also known as mojo, are also popular in Cuba and throughout the islands of the Caribbean, Hispanic or non-Hispanic, due to heavy Canarian emigration to the Caribbean, and have even influenced some barbecue sauces in the Deep South region of the United States, particularly the states of Florida, Texas, and Louisiana. The flavor can be made of almost everything, from tomato or pepper to avocado. In Cuban cooking, mojo applies to any sauce that is made with garlic, olive oil or pork lard, and a citrus juice, traditionally bitter orange juice. It is commonly used to flavor the cassava tuber and is also used to marinate roast pork. Without oregano, the sauce is typically called 'mojito' and used for dipping plantain chips and fried cassava (yuca). To create the marinade for pork, the ingredients are bitter orange juice, garlic, oregano, cumin, and salt. In Puerto Rico, mojo is a herb sauce of finely chopped cilantro or parsley with salt, plenty of crushed garlic and olive oil. Black pepper, butter, grated onion, vinegar and any citrus fruit can also be added. It is commonly used on the island as a marinade for chicken roast and a dip for tostones, fried cassava, and sometimes mashed with mofongo. Puerto Rican Chef Jose Enrique mojo mixed with papaya and avocado topped on fish has become a part of Puerto Ricos gastronomic. In the Dominican Republic, it is called wasakaka and is used as a sauce for roasted chicken and boiled cassava. Wasakaka is a mix of garlic, olive oil, and sour orange or lemon juice.

Her albums Into a Secret Land (1988) and Close to Seven (1992) have won Sandra high critical acclaim. Prior to embarking on a solo career, Sandra was the lead singer of the all-female disco trio Arabesque, which had a massive following in Japan and the Soviet Union. Also, between 1990 and 2001, she provided vocals on album releases of the very successful musical project Enigma, which had top 10 hits in North America and the United Kingdom. A cult star with a devoted fan base, Sandra remains one of the most popular singers of the 1980s in Continental Europe. During the height of her popularity, she even managed to outsell Madonna in a number of countries around the world. With sales in excess of 30 million records worldwide, Sandra has established her position as the most successful German disco/pop female vocalist. Biography =1962‚Äì1984: Early life and Arabesque= Sandra Ann Lauer was born in the German town of Saarbr√ºcken, close to the French border. Her father, Robert Lauer, who owned a wine store in Saarbr√ºcken, is French and her mother, Karin (n√©e Eltern), who worked in a shoe store, is German. She also had an older brother, Gaston, a paraplegic who died in 1995. Sandra showed an early interest in music and dancing, starting to learn classical ballet at the age of 5, which she would continue for ten years, and receiving guitar lessons when she was 10 years old. In 1975, at the age of thirteen, Sandra went with her mother to see Young Star Festival, a Saarbr√ºcken talent competition. She was only a member of the audience, but when all participants had finished performing and the jury was discussing the results, Sandra walked onto the stage, persuaded the DJ to put on the German version of a song made famous by Olivia Newton-John and started singing. The impromptu performance gained considerable recognition and led to the release of her first single, which was a children's song about a pet dog, \\"Andy mein Freund\\". The single, however, performed poorly on charts at that time dominated by disco mania. In 1979, now seventeen, Sandra joined Arabesque, a disco group consisting of Michaela Rose and Jasmine Vetter, and would become the band's lead singer. At that time Sandra met a keyboardist named Michael Cretu. They found that they share the same birthday, albeit five years apart, and became good friends. Arabesque became successful with their cheerful music and flamboyant, sometimes daring costumes, winning a massive following in Japan and scoring a top 10 hit in Germany in 1981 with \\"Marigot Bay\\". After nine albums, emerging differences in musical interests of group members and decreasing popularity of disco music signaled the group's break-up. Sandra and Michael Cretu, at that point already romantically involved, moved to Munich, where Michael created his own studio, Data-Alpha, named after a song from his solo album Legion√§re. Their first single together was 1984's \\"Japan ist weit\\", a German cover of the Alphaville song \\"Big in Japan\\". However, the song failed to enter any charts and only 125 copies of the single were sold. =1985‚Äì1992: Peak of international career= Sandra won international success in 1985 with a song \\"(I'll Never Be) Maria Magdalena\\", which topped the charts in 21 countries worldwide and reached top 10 in further five. Her first album, The Long Play (1985), reached number 12 in her home country of Germany and was a top 10 success in Scandinavia. The follow-up single, \\"In the Heat of the Night\\", continued her international success, reaching number two in Germany and top 10 positions in many European countries. The song also earned Sandra second place at the Tokyo Music Festival in 1986. \\"Little Girl\\" became the third single from the album in 1986, with the music video filmed in Venice, but met with moderate success. Shortly after the release of The Long Play, Sandra moved to London for six months, where she worked with singing teacher Helena Shelen and took drumming lessons to practice her timing. She also enrolled at the London Berlitz School of Languages to improve her English, and went back to Germany on weekends to record new songs. Sandra's second studio album, Mirrors, was released in October 1986, with \\"Innocent Love\\" chosen as the first single, followed by \\"Hi! Hi! Hi!\\". Both songs were synthpop up-tempo offerings and met with considerable charts success in Europe. Two further singles from the album, ballad \\"Loreen\\" and another danceable song \\"Midnight Man\\" met only with moderate success. In 1987, Sandra released a cover version of \\"Everlasting Love\\", which had been her favourite song since childhood, to a great international success. The single was a top 10 hit in German-speaking countries and charted within top 20 internationally. The song was included on Sandra's first retrospective album, Ten on One (The Singles), which met with success and spawned another top 10 single, \\"Stop for a Minute\\". Sandra and Michael married in January 1988 and relocated from Munich to the Spanish island Ibiza to work on what would be Sandra's third studio album. Into a Secret Land moved from electro-pop to more sophisticated areas of pop, what was showcased by the first single, \\"Heaven Can Wait\\", a top 20 European hit. Second single, \\"Secret Land\\", met with even greater success and is now considered one of Sandra's biggest hits while \\"We'll Be Together\\", released as the third single to a big success, was the first song co-written by Sandra. In order to promote Sandra's music in the English-speaking world, another compilation was released at the end of 1988, Everlasting Love. The album failed to enter charts, but included a PWL remix of the title track which charted at number 45 in the UK. 1989 saw the release of the final single from Into a Secret Land, \\"Around My Heart\\", which became another chart hit, while at that point the album itself was her best-selling offering. With animal rights and nature conservation high on her personal agenda, Sandra took part in recording a song \\"Yes We Can\\" together with 15 other musicians as a part of the project Artists United for Nature. Sandra's fourth album, Paintings in Yellow, was released in March 1990 and became her highest-charting album in her home country. \\"Hiroshima\\" was released as the lead single and eventually became one of her biggest chart hits. Danceable \\"(Life May Be) A Big Insanity\\" and ballad \\"One More Night\\" were released as the second and third single off the album, respectively, but met with modest success. At the end of 1990, Sandra accepted an award for the best-selling German artist at the World Music Awards in Monte Carlo. Also in 1990, the singer contributed vocals to four songs for her husband's musical project Enigma, including a worldwide number 1 hit \\"Sadeness (Part I)\\". In early 1992, Sandra's fifth album was released, Close to Seven, which continued more mature, less dance-oriented musical style. The album was a remarkable international success as was its lead single, \\"Don't Be Aggressive\\". However, the second single, \\"I Need Love\\", was Sandra's first since 1984 to fail to enter charts. Later in 1992, a new compilation was released, titled 18 Greatest Hits. It included most of her previous single songs and a re-recording of \\"Johnny Wanna Live\\", originally from Paintings in Yellow, which was released as a single and became a minor hit in Germany and the Netherlands. 18 Greatest Hits was another commercial success and marked the end of Sandra's most successful period of her career. =1993‚Äì2006: Comeback attempts= In 1993, Sandra released a new version of \\"Maria Magdalena\\" with a techno arrangement and futuristic music video. The re-recording turned out a flop, signaling her declining popularity. Nonetheless, she sang in three songs on Enigma's next album, The Cross of Changes, including the hit single \\"Return to Innocence\\". While pregnant with twins, Sandra recorded and released Fading Shades in 1995. The album saw a new writer-producer Jens Gad working alongside Michael Cretu and consisted of mostly pop-oriented material. A cover version of \\"Nights in White Satin\\" by The Moody Blues was released as the first single, becoming one of Sandra's lowest-charting singles in Germany, although it was a hit in Israel. The album met with lukewarm commercial and critical reception, and the second single, \\"Won't Run Away\\", failed to make any impact on music charts. After giving birth to twin sons Nikita and Sebastian in a Munich hospital through Caesarean section in July 1995, Sandra decided to put her career on hold to raise children. However, the following year she participated in recording two songs for Enigma's third album. 1999 saw the release of My Favourites, a double disc album featuring remixes of Sandra's older songs and some of her favourite ballads. It was a success, charting within the top 20 in some European countries. A new version of \\"Secret Land\\" was released as a single, accompanied by a music video in which Sandra sported a new, shorter hair. Her vocals again appeared in two songs on Enigma's 2000 album The Screen Behind the Mirror as well as the project's 2001 single \\"Turn Around\\". 2001 also saw the release of Sandra's brand new single, a ballad \\"Forever\\", which was a minor chart success in Germany. It foreshadowed her next studio album, The Wheel of Time, eventually released in spring 2002, after several delays. The album was a chart success and met with positive critical response, producing two more singles, \\"Such a Shame\\", originally performed by Talk Talk, and another ballad \\"I Close My Eyes\\". In 2003, the DVD The Complete History was released, featuring all of her music videos, and was a commercial success. The same year, Sandra contributed vocals for Enigma's Voyageur album, which would mark the last time she worked with the project. After several years break, in 2006 Sandra teamed up with Swiss singer DJ BoBo for a duet \\"Secrets of Love\\" on his Greatest Hits album. The single was a big hit, reaching top 5 in Switzerland and top 20 in Germany. Sandra subsequently took up performing live again and began working on her next album. In late 2006, Reflections was released, an album consisting of remixes of Sandra's biggest hits, and met with minor commercial success. A new ballad version of \\"Everlasting Love\\", with re-recorded vocals, was released as a promotional single in Germany while the remix of \\"Around My Heart\\" proved to be a big radio hit in Poland. =2007‚Äìpresent: A new musical direction= The highly anticipated new studio album, The Art of Love, was released in February 2007, charting within top 20 in German charts and enjoying a minor success internationally. For the first time, Michael Cretu did not participate in recording the album, as he was reportedly busy with new Enigma recordings, instead letting Jens Gad produce the entire work. Sandra now participated actively in composing and writing the album, therefore lyrics were more personal and reflected struggles in her personal life. \\"The Way I Am\\" was the album's lead single, peaking at number 50 in Germany, while the second single, \\"What Is It About Me\\", failed to chart. However, her version of The Hooters' \\"All You Zombies\\" became a big radio hit in Poland. In November 2007, it was announced that Sandra and Michael were getting divorced and Sandra spent the following year touring Europe. A new Sandra album, titled Back to Life, was released in March 2009, showcasing an up-tempo material, influenced by Latin pop, dance and R&B.; \\"In a Heartbeat\\" and \\"The Night Is Still Young\\", the latter featuring Thomas Anders of Modern Talking, were released as singles and both met with modest success in Germany. The album itself was moderately successful too and generated mixed reviews. Later in 2009, a three-disc compilation album titled The Platinum Collection was released, featuring all of Sandra's hit singles as well as some album tracks and extended versions. The release did not chart. 2012 saw the release of Stay in Touch, Sandra's tenth studio album. Produced by German DJ duo Blank & Jones, the album incorporated 1980s sound into songs, reproducing the pattern of Sandra's early albums. \\"Maybe Tonight\\" was released as the first single, peaking only at number 77 in Germany, while the second single, \\"Infinite Kiss\\" failed to enter charts. However, the album was a modest chart success internationally and received warm response. In August 2014 the management has been taken over by Alexei Perschukewitsch until today. Personal life Sandra and Michael Cretu were married on 7 January 1988 and, in July 1995, became parents of twin sons. They separated in November 2007, citing \\"personal and professional differences\\". While Cretu has been living in Germany since May 2009, Sandra has continued to reside in Ibiza and married music producer Olaf Menges in 2010. As of 2014 they are separated.

His full Chinese name is Chen-tse Jin Arn. Jin-Qua was a Cohong who possessed a monopoly on all the foreign trade in China during the early 19th century era of the Canton System. With the arrival of the British merchants and the establishment of Hong Kong, he began cultivating a relationship with Dirk Struan, the Tai-pan of the Noble House, the chief trading company in Hong Kong. He arranged for two of his own descendants to become Struan's mistresses. The first, Kai-sung, was Jin-Qua's daughter. She was the mother by Dirk Struan of Gordon Chen. The second was T'Chung Jin May-may, Jin-Qua's granddaughter. She was secretly assigned the task of teaching Struan \\"civilized\\" (Chinese) ways. In 1841, Struan & Company was on the brink of ruin, about to be destroyed by rival Tyler Brock. In desperation, Dirk Struan turned to Jin-Qua, who lent him one million sterling in specie. Six hundred thousand of the million cleared out the Cohong's debt to Struan's. In return, Struan agreed that a member of the Chen family would forever be compradore of the Noble House, the first being Gordon Chen. Additionally, four bronze coins were split in half with Dirk Struan given one half of each coin. Struan agreed that whenever anyone presented the Tai-pan with the other half-coin, the Tai-pan would be obliged to grant that person one favor, whether legal or illegal. Furthermore, this obligation was handed down to all successive tai-pans (who could only become tai-pan after first blindly swearing to uphold these agreements). Of the four coins, one was kept by Jin-Qua, one given to the warlord Wu Fang Choi, one given to Gordon Chen, and one given out in secret. The character's biography has similarities with the historical merchant Howqua.

The most common types of refractive error are near-sightedness, far-sightedness, astigmatism, and presbyopia. Near-sightedness results in far away objects being blurry, far-sightedness and presbyopia result in close objects being blurry, and astigmatism causes objects to appear stretched out or blurry. Other symptoms may include double vision, headaches, and eye strain. Near-sightedness is due to the length of the eyeball being too long, far-sightedness the eyeball too short, astigmatism the cornea being the wrong shape, and presbyopia aging of the lens of the eye such that it cannot change shape sufficiently. Some refractive errors occur more often among those whose parents are affected. Diagnosis is by eye examination. Refractive errors are corrected with eyeglasses, contact lenses, or surgery. Eyeglasses are the easiest and safest method of correction. Contact lenses can provide a wider field of vision; however they are associated with a risk of infection. Refractive surgery permanently changes the shape of the cornea. The number of people globally with refractive errors has been estimated at one to two billion. Rates vary between regions of the world with about 25% of Europeans and 80% of Asians affected. Near-sightedness is the most common disorder. Rates among adults are between 15-49% while rates among children are between 1.2-42%. Far-sightedness more commonly affects young children and the elderly. Presbyopia affects most people over the age of 35. The number of people with refractive errors that have not been corrected was estimated at 660 million (10 per 100 people) in 2013. Of these 9.5 million were blind due to the refractive error. It is one of the most common causes of vision loss along with cataracts, macular degeneration, and vitamin A deficiency. Classification Top: farsighted corrected using convex lens Bottom: nearsighted corrected using concave lens. An eye that has no refractive error when viewing distant objects is said to have emmetropia or be emmetropic meaning the eye is in a state in which it can focus parallel rays of light (light from distant objects) on the retina, without using any accommodation. A distant object, in this case, is defined as an object located beyond 6 meters, or 20 feet, from the eye, since the light from those objects arrives as essentially parallel rays when considering the limitations of human perception. An eye that has refractive error when viewing distant objects is said to have ametropia or be ametropic. This eye cannot focus parallel rays of light (light from distant objects) on the retina, or needs accommodation to do so. The word \\"ametropia\\" can be used interchangeably with \\"refractive error\\". Types of ametropia include myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism. They are frequently categorized as spherical errors and cylindrical errors: * Spherical errors occur when the optical power of the eye is either too large or too small to focus light on the retina. People with refractive error frequently have blurry vision. ** Nearsightedness: When the optics are too powerful for the length of the eyeball one has myopia or nearsightedness. This can arise from a cornea or crystalline lens with too much curvature (refractive myopia) or an eyeball that is too long (axial myopia). Myopia can be corrected with a concave lens, which causes the divergence of light rays before they reach the cornea. ** Farsightedness: When the optics are too weak for the length of the eyeball, one has hyperopia or farsightedness. This can arise from a cornea or crystalline lens with not enough curvature (refractive hyperopia) or an eyeball that is too short (axial hyperopia). This can be corrected with convex lenses, which cause light rays to converge prior to hitting the cornea. **Presbyopia: When the flexibility of the lens declines, typically due to age. The individual would experience difficulty in near vision, often relieved by reading glasses, bifocal, or progressive lenses. * Cylindrical errors cause astigmatism, when the optical power of the eye is too powerful or too weak across one meridian, such as if the corneal curvature tends towards a cylindrical shape. The angle between that meridian and the horizontal is known as the axis of the cylinder. **Astigmatism: A person with astigmatic refractive error sees lines of a particular orientation less clearly than lines at right angles to them. This defect can be corrected by refracting light more in one meridian than the other. Cylindrical lenses serve this purpose. Other terminology include anisometropia, when the two eyes have unequal refractive power, and aniseikonia which is when the magnification power between the eyes differ. The optical powers (in units of diopter) of glasses can be used to describe an individual's eyes; or a more subjective quantity visual acuity (expressed as a fraction) may be used, but there is no direct or exact conversion between the two. Risk factors =Genetics= Fundus of person with retinitis pigmentosa, early stage There is evidence to suggest genetic predilection for refractive error. Individuals that have parents with certain refractive errors are more likely to have similar refractive errors. The Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database has listed 261 genetic disorders in which myopia is one of the symptoms. Myopia may be present in heritable connective tissue disorders such as: Knobloch syndrome (OMIM 267750); Marfan syndrome (OMIM 154700); and Stickler syndrome (type 1, OMIM 108300; type 2, OMIM 604841). Myopia has also been reported in X-linked disorders caused by mutations in loci involved in retinal photoreceptor function (NYX, RP2, MYP1) such as: autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB; OMIM 310500); retinitis pigmentosa 2 (RP2; OMIM 312600); Bornholm eye disease (OMIM 310460). Many genes that have been associated with refractive error are clustered into common biological networks involved in connective tissue growth and extracellular matrix organization. Although a large number of chromosomal localisations have been associated with myopia (MYP1-MYP17), few specific genes have been identified. =Environmental= In studies of the genetic predisposition of refractive error, there is a correlation between environmental factors and the risk of developing myopia. Myopia has been observed in individuals with visually intensive occupations. Reading has also been found to be a predictor of myopia in children. It has been reported that children with myopia spent significantly more time reading than non-myopic children who spent more time playing outdoors. Socioeconomic status and higher levels of education have also been reported to be a risk factor for myopia. Diagnosis A doctor uses a trial frame and trial lenses to measure the person's refractive error. Blurry vision may result from any number of conditions not necessarily related to refractive errors. The diagnosis of a refractive error is usually confirmed by an eye care professional during an eye examination using a large number of lenses of different optical powers, and often a retinoscope (a procedure entitled retinoscopy) to measure objectively in which the person views a distant spot while the clinician changes the lenses held before the person's eye and watches the pattern of reflection of a small light shone on the eye. Following that \\"objective refraction\\" the clinician typically shows the person lenses of progressively higher or weaker powers in a process known as subjective refraction. Cycloplegic agents are frequently used to more accurately determine the amount of refractive error, particularly in childrenRoque, B. Refractive errors in children. November 2, 2005. An automated refractor is an instrument that is sometimes used in place of retinoscopy to objectively estimate a person's refractive error. Shack‚ÄìHartmann wavefront sensor and its inverse can also be used to characterize eye aberrations in a higher level of resolution and accuracy. Vision defects caused by refractive error can be distinguished from other problems using a pinhole occluder, which will improve vision only in the case of refractive error. Management How refractive errors are treated or managed depends upon the amount and severity of the condition. Those who possess mild amounts of refractive error may elect to leave the condition uncorrected, particularly if the person is asymptomatic. For those who are symptomatic, glasses, contact lenses, refractive surgery, or a combination of the three are typically used. Strategies being studied to slow worsening include adjusting working conditions, increasing the time children spend outdoors, and special types of contact lenses. In children special contact lenses appear to slow worsening of nearsightedness. A number of questionnaires exist to determine quality of life impact of refractive errors and their correction. Epidemiology DALYs per 100,000 people due to refractive errors in 2004. The number of people globally with refractive errors that have not been corrected was estimated at 660 million (10 per 100 people) in 2013. The number of people globally with significant refractive errors has been estimated at one to two billion. Rates vary between regions of the world with about 25% of Europeans and 80% of Asians affected. Near-sightedness is one of the most prevalent disorders of the eye. Rates among adults are between 15-49% while rates among children are between 1.2-42%. Far-sightedness more commonly affects young children, whose eyes have yet to grow to their full length, and the elderly, who have lost the ability to compensate with their accommodation system. Presbyopia affects most people over the age of 35, and nearly 100% of people by the ages of 55-65. Uncorrected refractive error is responsible for visual impairment and disability for many people worldwide. It is one of the most common causes of vision loss along with cataracts, macular degeneration, and vitamin A deficiency. Cost The yearly cost of correcting refractive errors is estimated at 3.9 to 7.2 billion dollars in the United States.

Legal psychologists typically take basic social and cognitive principles and apply them to issues in the legal system such as eyewitness memory, jury decision- making, investigations, and interviewing. The term \\"legal psychology\\" has only recently come into usage, primarily as a way to differentiate the experimental focus of legal psychology from the clinically-oriented forensic psychology. Together, legal psychology and forensic psychology form the field more generally recognized as \\"psychology and law\\". Following earlier efforts by psychologists to address legal issues, psychology and law became a field of study in the 1960s as part of an effort to enhance justice, though that originating concern has lessened over time.Dennis R. Fox (1999). Psycholegal Scholarship's Contribution to False Consciousness About Injustice.Law and Human Behavior, 23, 9-30. The multidisciplinary American Psychological Association's Division 41, the American Psychology-Law Society, is active with the goal of promoting the contributions of psychology to the understanding of law and legal systems through research, as well as providing education to psychologists in legal issues and providing education to legal personnel on psychological issues. Further, its mandate is to inform the psychological and legal communities and the public at large of current research, educational, and service in the area of psychology and law. There are similar societies in Britain and Europe. Areas of research Generally speaking, any research that combines psychological principles with legal applications or contexts could be considered legal psychology (although research involving clinical psychology, e.g., mental illness, competency, insanity defense, offender profiling, etc., is typically categorized as forensic psychology, and not legal psychology). For a time, legal psychology researchers were primarily focused on issues related to eyewitness testimony and jury decision-making; so much so, that the editor of Law and Human Behavior, the premier legal psychology journal, implored researchers to expand the scope of their research and move on to other areas.Michael J. Saks (1986). The Law Does Not Live on Eyewitness Testimony Alone. Law and Human Behavior, 10, 279-280. There are several legal psychology journals, including Law and Human Behavior, Psychology, Public Policy and Law, Psychology, Crime, and Law, and Journal of Psychiatry, Psychology and Law that focus on general topics of criminology, and the criminal justice system. In addition, research by legal psychologists is regularly published in more general journals that cover both basic and applied research areas. In March 1893 J. McKeen Cattell posted questions to fifty-six of his students at Columbia University, the questions he asked his students were comparable to those asked in a court of justice. What he found was that it was reasonable to conclude eyewitness accounts of events were unreliable. His students were all sure they were mostly correct, even when they weren't, and some were hesitant when they were in fact correct. He could not figure out specifically why each student had inaccurate testimonies. Cattell suggested that ‚Äúan unscrupulous attorney‚Äù could discredit a witness who is being truthful by asking ‚Äúcunningly selected questions‚Äù. Although a jury, or the judge, should know how normal errors are in eyewitness testimonies given different conditions. However, even Cattell was shocked by the level of incorrectness displayed by his students. Cattell's research has been depicted as the foundation of forensic psychology in the United States. His research is still widely considered a prevailing research interest in legal psychology. It has been thought that in America psychologists have been used as expert witnesses in court testimonies since the early 1920s. Consultation within civil courts was most common, during this time criminal courts rarely consulted with psychologists. Psychologists were not considered medical experts, those who were like, physicians and psychiatrists, in the past were the ones consulted for criminal testimonies. This could be because in criminal cases, the defendant's mental state almost never mattered \\"As a general rule, only medical men‚Äîthat is, persons licensed by law to practice the profession of medicine‚Äîcan testify as experts on the question of insanity; and the propriety of this general limitation is too patent to permit discussion\\". Training and education Legal psychologists typically hold a PhD in some area of psychology (e.g., clinical psychology, social psychology, cognitive psychology, etc.), and apply their knowledge of that field to the law. Although formal legal training (such as a JD or Master of Legal Studies degree) can be beneficial, most legal psychologists hold only the PhD. In fact, some argue that specialized legal training dilutes the psychological empiricism of the researcher. For instance, to understand how eyewitness memory \\"works\\", a psychologist should be concerned with memory processes as a whole, instead of only the aspects relevant to the law (e.g., lineups, accuracy of testimony). A growing number of universities offer specialized training in legal psychology as either a standalone PhD program or a joint JD/PhD program. A list of American universities that offer graduate training in legal psychology can be found here on the website of the American Psychology-Law Society. Roles of a legal psychologist =Academics and research= Many legal psychologists work as professors in university psychology departments, criminal justice departments or law schools. Like other professors, legal psychologists generally conduct and publish empirical research, teach various classes, and mentor graduate and undergraduate students. Many legal psychologists also conduct research in a more general area of psychology (e.g., social, clinical, cognitive) with only a tangential legal focus. Those legal psychologists who work in law schools almost always hold a JD in addition to a PhD =Expert witnesses= Psychologists specifically trained in legal issues, as well as those with no formal training, are often called by legal parties to testify as expert witnesses. In criminal trials, an expert witness may be called to testify about eyewitness memory, mistaken identity, competence to stand trial, the propensity of a death-qualified jury to also be \\"pro-guilt\\", etc. Psychologists who focus on clinical issues often testify specifically about a defendant's competence, intelligence, etc. More general testimony about perceptual issues (e.g., adequacy of police sirens) may also come up in trial. Experts, particularly psychology experts, are often accused of being \\"hired guns\\" or \\"stating the obvious\\". Eyewitness memory experts, such as Elizabeth Loftus, are often discounted by judges and lawyers with no empirical training because their research utilizes undergraduate students and \\"unrealistic\\" scenarios. If both sides have psychological witnesses, jurors may have the daunting task of assessing difficult scientific information. =Policy making and legislative guidance= Psychologists employed at public policy centers may attempt to influence legislative policy or may be called upon by state (or national) lawmakers to address some policy issue through empirical research. A psychologist working in public policy might suggest laws or help to evaluate a new legal practice (e.g., eyewitness lineups).Examples of legal psychologists in these positions can be found at the American Bar Foundation (Website) and Federal Judicial Center (Website), among others. =Advisory roles= Legal psychologists may hold advisory roles in court systems. They may advise legal decision makers, particularly judges, on psychological findings pertaining to issues in a case. The psychologist who acts as a court adviser provides similar input to one acting as an expert witness, but acts out of the domain of an adversarial system.See, e.g., Court Appointed Scientific Expert Program , American Association for the Advancement of Science =Amicus briefs= Psychologists can provide an amicus brief to the court. The American Psychological Association has provided briefs concerning mental illness, retardation and other factors. The amicus brief usually contains an opinion backed by scientific citations and statistics. The impact of an amicus brief by a psychological association is questionable. For instance, Justice PowellBallew v. Georgia once called a reliance on statistics \\"numerology\\" and discounted results of several empirical studies. Judges who have no formal scientific training also may critique experimental methods, and some feel that judges only cite an amicus brief when the brief supports the judge's personal beliefs. =Trial consulting= Some legal psychologists work in trial consulting. No special training nor certification is needed to be a trial consultant, though an advanced degree is generally welcomed by those who would hire the trial consultant. The American Society of Trial Consultants does have a code of ethics for members, but there are no legally binding ethical rules for consultants.An overview of the trial consulting process is provided by the American Society of Trial Consultants, ASTC Website Some psychologists who work in academics are hired as trial consultants when their expertise can be useful to a particular case. Other psychologists/consultants work for or with established trial consultant firms. The practice of law firms hiring \\"in- house\\" trial consultants is becoming more popular, but these consultants usually can also be used by the firms as practicing attorneys. Trial consultants perform a variety of services for lawyers, such as picking jurors (usually relying on in-house or published statistical studies) or performing \\"mock trials\\" with focus groups. Trial consultants work on all stages of a case from helping to organize testimony, preparing witnesses to testify, picking juries, and even arranging \\"shadow jurors\\" to watch the trial unfold and provide input on the trial. There is some debate on whether the work of a trial consultant is protected under attorney-client privilege, especially when the consultant is hired by a party in the case and not by an attorney.

It was formed when the Collins Radio Company, facing financial difficulties, was purchased by Rockwell International in 1973. In 2001, the avionics division of Rockwell International was spun off to form the current Rockwell Collins, Inc., retaining its name. The company was acquired by United Technologies Corporation on November 27, 2018, and now operates as part of Collins Aerospace, a subsidiary of Raytheon Technologies.  History  Arthur A. Collins founded Collins Radio Company in 1933 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. It designed and produced both shortwave radio equipment and equipment for the burgeoning AM Broadcast industry. Collins was solicited by the military, the scientific community and by the larger AM radio stations for special equipment. Collins supplied the equipment to establish a communications link with the South Pole expedition of Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd in 1933. In 1936, Collins had begun production of the 12H audio console, 12X portable field announcers box, the 300E and 300F broadcast transmitters. Throughout World War II, the 212A1 and 212B1 replaced the 12H design. Collins became the principal supplier of radio and navigation equipment used in the military, where uncompromising performance was required. In the post war years, the Collins Radio Company expanded its work in all phases of the communications field while broadening its technology. This moved Arthur Collins into a more active role as CEO guiding department leaders holding significant responsibilities. New developments such as flight control instruments, radio communication devices and satellite voice transmissions created great opportunities in the marketplace. Collins Radio Company provided communications for the United States' role in the Space Race, including equipment for astronauts to communicate with earth stations and equipment to track and communicate with spacecraft. Collins communications equipment was used for Projects Mercury, Gemini and Apollo, providing voice communication for every American astronaut traveling through space. In 1973, the U.S. Skylab Program used Collins equipment to provide communication from the astronauts to earth. = Rockwell Collins = Rockwell Collins avionics demonstrator aircraft After facing financial difficulties, the Collins Radio Company was purchased by Rockwell International in 1973. In 2001, the avionics division of Rockwell International was spun off to form the current Rockwell Collins, Inc., retaining its name. Rockwell Collins is highly concentrated in the defense and commercial avionics markets and no longer markets receivers to the public. The Collins mechanical filter is still in production and does, however, find consumer and commercial use. On April 28, 2000, Rockwell International Corp and its Rockwell Collins unit agreed to acquire Sony Corp's Sony Trans Com (Irvine, Calif) for undisclosed terms. Sony had purchased the business from Sundstrand Corporation in 1989. On December 20, 2000, Rockwell Collins expanded its services to commercial and executive aviation in Mercosur countries. The company had acquired several companies, including Hughes- Avicom's in-flight entertainment business (1998), Sony Trans Com (2000), Intertrade Ltd., Flight Dynamics, K Systems, Inc. (Kaiser companies), Communication Solutions, Inc., Airshow, Inc. (2002), NLX (Simulation Business) in 2003, portions of Evans & Sutherland, TELDIX GmbH, IP Unwired, Anzus Inc. in 2006, Information Technology & Applications Corporation in 2007, Athena Technologies, Datapath Inc. (divested in 2014), SEOS Displays Ltd., Air Routing International in 2010, Computing Technologies for Aviation (CTA) in 2011, ARINC in 2014, and BE Aerospace in 2017. The company was among the major suppliers of in-flight entertainment. Rockwell Collins' key competitors in this industry included Panasonic Avionics Corporation, Thales Group, and JetBlue's IFE subsidiary LiveTV which was later purchased by Thales in 2014 for $400M . In 2010 the company employed over 20,000 people and had an annual turnover of 4.665 billion US dollars. Its non-executive chairman was Anthony Carbone following the retirement of Clayton M. Jones. In September 2012, Kelly Ortberg was appointed as president of the company. In August 2013, Kelly Ortberg was appointed CEO of Rockwell Collins. Acquisition by United Technologies On September 4, 2017, United Technologies of Farmington, Connecticut agreed to acquire the company for $30 billion. The transaction closed on November 26, 2018.  Past Products  = Broadcast transmitters = In the mid-1930s, the Collins Radio Company constructed and sold transmitters and audio mixing consoles to the broadcast industry. In 1939, the model 12 Speech Input Console, in addition to the 26C limiter amplifier, was licensed to Canadian Marconi Co. for both sales in Canada and His Majesties Service for the war effort. Collins success in constructing broadcast transmitters continued to grow, selling well over a thousand up to the start of World War II. During World War II, Collins expertise grew in higher power transmitters producing designs which ran well over 15 kilowatts of RF power on a continuous basis. After the war a limited number of AM transmitters were produced called the 300G and remain the finest in low power AM transmitters (300W) ever produced. Collins remained an important manufacturer of AM and FM broadcast radio transmitters for the commercial market surviving the drastic cost cutting market of the 1960s and 1970s. The transmitter line was later sold to Continental Electronics, which continued to produce a number of Collins designs under its own nameplate before phasing them out in the 1980s. = Shortwave transmitters = Collins produced several shortwave transmitters to the commercial market. A \\"30\\" Series production catered to the growing need of state highway patrol agencies and Department of Commerce aviation needs. During World War II, Collins produced high power transmitters for aircraft, notably the ART-13 equipped with automatic tuning circuits, which represented an important enhancement for airborne radio communications. After World War II, Collins supported both broadcast and the growing post-war amateur radio market. The United States Coast Guard Cutter USCGC Courier was employed as seagoing relay station for Voice of America programming using two Collins 207B-1 transmitters.U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Courier. United States Coast Guard. 2010-06-04. URL:http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Courier_WAGR410_Photos.asp. Accessed: 2010-06-04. (Archived by WebCite at https://www.webcitation.org/5qEcH1yCd) Amateur radio transmitters included the 32V-1, -2, and -3, KWS-1 and the rack mounted KW-1.W0YVA Web Site, ‚ÄúCollins KW-1 Registry‚Äù = Receivers = Around 1947, the company introduced their first amateur radio receiver, the 75A-1 (called the 75A). This set achieved excellent stability for the time due to high build quality and the use of a permeability tuned oscillator (PTO) in its second conversion stage. It was one of the few double conversion superheterodynes on the market and covered only the amateur bands. With the experience gained in the design of the 75A-1, Collins released the 51J-1 receiver, a general coverage HF set covering .5 to 30 MHz. It would be produced in somewhat updated versions (51J-2, 51J-3, 51J-4) for about a decade. It was known as the R-388 and was used in multiple receiver diversity RTTY installations. The 75A amateur line was updated throughout the early 50s, finishing with the 75A-4, which was released in 1955. The Collins mechanical filter was introduced to consumers in the 75A-3, and the 75A-4 was one of the first receivers marketed specifically as a single sideband receiver. Collins R-390A radio receiver Around 1950, Collins began designing the R-390 (.5‚Äì30 MHz) for the US military. This was intended to be a receiver of the highest performance available, with the ruggedness and serviceability required for military duty. It featured direct mechanical digital frequency readout. The set is composed of several modules for easy field repair‚Äîa bad module could simply be swapped out and repaired later, or junked. Sets built during the original 1951 contract cost the government about $2500 each and around 16,000 were produced. Concurrently, Collins developed the R-389, a long-wave version with fewer than 1000 made. The R-391, another variant of the R-390, allowed choice of 8 different auto-tuned channels. Three years later, Collins delivered the R-390A to the military. About 54,000 were produced and the set was a military workhorse until the 1970s. Like the R-390, it can outperform many modern radios, to the point that it was designated top secret until the late 1960s. In 1958 Collins replaced the 75A series with the much smaller 75S series, part of the S/Line, discussed in the next section. These featured mechanical filters, very accurate frequency readout, and excellent stability. At the request of the US government, Collins designed the 51S-1 general coverage set, which was essentially (in intended use) a physically smaller replacement for the 51J series. It was not intended as a replacement for the higher performance R-390A, and unlike the R-390A, it was extensively marketed for commercial use. Collins produced a few high performance solid state receivers in the 1970s, such as the 651S-1. Like their tube predecessors, these are coveted by collectors today. = Transceivers and systems = With the introduction of the S/Line in 1958, Collins moved from designing individual products that could be used together, to ones that were designed to integrate and operate together, in various combinations, as a system. They were the first equipment maker to take this approach. Collins was also the first to introduce a compact HF transceiver, the KWM-1, the year before. Together, these two innovations put Collins temporarily ahead of its competition and set the stage for other manufacturers and the next generation of amateur (and military) HF radio equipment. The 75S-1 receiver and 32S-1 transmitter, comprising the heart of the S/Line, operated separately or together to transceive. The units included crystal bandpass filters and a new compact PTO design that provided stable, highly linear tuning across 200 kHz band segments. The S/Line tuning dial mechanism was unique when introduced. It used concentric dials and a gear mechanism that provided precise dial resolution, better than 1 kHz. Collins S/Line ‚Äì 516F-2 power supply, 75S-3B receiver, 32S-3 transmitter, 312B-4 console, SM-1 microphone, circa 1969 Within a few years Collins had introduced additional S/Line components, including the 30S-1 kilowatt power amplifier, the 30L-1 desktop power amplifier, and the 62S-1 transverter, which provided coverage of the 6 meter (50 MHz) and 2 meter (144 MHz) amateur bands. The KWM-2 transceiver replaced the KWM-1 using many of the S/Line's design features and matching its styling. Other accessories included speakers, microphones and control consoles. Illustrating the uniqueness of their new, smaller units in the market, Collins advertisements in the 1950s and early 1960s emphasized the S/Line's physical styling and size as often as they did its performance.WA3KEY Virtual Collins Radio Museum, ‚ÄúAdvertisement Archive‚Äù Collins continued to improve the S/Line, first introducing the S-2, then the S-3 units, the 75S-3 (and -3A, -3B and -3C) receiver, and the 32S-3 and -3A transmitters. The -3A and -3C units were identical to the -3 and -3B units, respectively, except they provided an extra set of heterodyne oscillator crystals enabling them to cover extra bands ‚Äì useful for military, amateur and MARS operation, where operation just outside the regular amateur bands was necessary. Collins 30L-1 Amplifier ca. 1970 Among amateur radio operators, the S/Line established its reputation as perhaps the most solidly engineered equipment available ‚Äì and the most costly. As a result, S/Line equipment, and the A-Line and other predecessors, are restored, prized, and operated on the air by collectors today. Collins continued to produce the S/Line well into the late 1970s and after its acquisition by Rockwell. In 1978, with the move to solid state design, the S/Line came to an end after a two decade production run. The KWM-380 transceiver was introduced the next year ‚Äì a break with the past both in its use of transistors and digital technology, and its styling. It would be Collins‚Äô final entry in the amateur radio market until it was discontinued in the mid-1980s.WA3KEY Virtual Collins Radio Museum, ‚ÄúCollins Amateur Equipment‚Äù = Computers = In the 1960s, the company designed and sold C-System computerized message switching equipment, built an intranet, and began implementing computer storage of design data for circuit boards and assemblies. They had a goal of automating all functions from parts ordering and inventory to factory scheduling to generation of maintenance provisioning. With products technically successful and far ahead of their time in many respects, Mr. Collins continued to invest in development at a rate that could not be supported by sales when a downturn occurred, and began to have financial problems. = Network Transmission Systems = In 1991, Rockwell sold its Richardson, TX based Network Transmission Systems division to Alcatel.  Acquisitions  In 2008, Rockwell Collins acquired Athena Technologies for $107 million. =ARINC Acquisition= In August 2013 Rockwell Collins announced the agreement to purchase ARINC. On December 23, 2013 Rockwell Collins announced it had completed its acquisition of ARINC for $1.4 billion. The purchase of ARINC allowed Rockwell Collins to shift their balance in commercial aviation. = B/E Aerospace Acquisition = In April 2017, Rockwell Collins entered the aircraft cabin interiors market through the acquisition of B/E Aerospace for $8.3 billion. Based in Wellington, Florida, B/E products included seating, food and beverage preparation and storage equipment, lighting and oxygen systems, and modular galley and lavatory systems for commercial airliners and business jets. B/E benefits of rival Zodiac Aerospace delivery troubles. Retrofit opportunities are provided by its $12 billion installed base. B/E shareholders received 20% of the new Rockwell which then had $8.1 billion in revenues and $1.9 billion in pre-tax earnings with nearly 30,000 employees. Rockwell Collins filed for regulatory approval for its intended acquisition of B/E Aerospace, a manufacturer and supplier of aircraft cabin interior products, including cabin seating, lighting, oxygen systems, food and beverage preparation and storage equipment, galleys and lavatories, before the Philippine Competition Commission since the latter has a branch in the Philippines operating a manufacturing plant in Tanauan, Batangas. As a result of the acquisition, a newly created direct or indirect subsidiary of Rockwell, Quarterback Merger Sub Corp., will merge with and into B/E Aerospace, with the latter surviving the merger as a direct or indirect subsidiary of Rockwell Collins.  Organizational structure  Rockwell Collins has five main divisions: * Commercial Systems (CS) * Government Systems (GS) * International and Service Solutions (I&SS;) * Information Management Services (IMS) * Interior Systems (IS) The CS division services the commercial airline industry and business aircraft, providing navigation, communication, Synthetic vision, other cockpit products such as autoland autopilots, and cabin products such as In Flight Entertainment (IFE). The GS division services primarily the US government and military, but also provides some products and services to foreign governments with close ties to the United States. Notable government related projects that Rockwell Collins has involvement with are Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS), Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT), Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR), and Future Combat Systems. The I&SS; division is an amalgamation of (IB) International Business organization whose responsibility is sales, engineering and human resource of personnel outside of North America and Service Solutions who provides support services such as customer support, simulation and training and technical publications. I&SS; provide a common service to both CS and GS divisions and its formation was announced on the Rockwell Collins press release web page on February 19, 2010.  Donald R. Beall Advanced Technology Center  The Donald R. Beall Advanced Technology Center (ATC) is a research and development center within Rockwell Collins that focuses on creating, identifying, and maturing technologies targeted at driving business growth. ATC maintains a portfolio that balances shorter term deliverables focused on core and adjacent markets with technologies for long term growth. ATC has three departments: Advanced Radio Systems, Communications and Navigation Systems, and Embedded Information Systems. Collector community As with several other brands of vintage radio equipment, there is an active community of Collins radio enthusiasts, with clubs, web sites and on-line discussions dedicated to restoring and operating the equipment. The Collins Collectors Association (CCA) and the Collins Radio Association (CRA) are two examples of such organizations. Groups of Collins users also organize meetings, gatherings at hamfests and regularly scheduled on-air discussions called ‚Äúnets‚Äù. Tax avoidance In December 2019, CNBC listed Rockwell Collins along with 378 additional Fortune 500 companies that \\"paid an effective federal tax rate of 0% or less\\" as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

Sir Samuel Garth FRS (1661 ‚Äì 18 January 1719) was an English physician and poet. Life Garth was born in Bolam in County Durham and matriculated at Peterhouse, Cambridge in 1676, graduating B.A. in 1679 and M.A. in 1684. He took his M.D. and became a member of the College of Physicians in 1691. He settled as a physician in London and soon acquired a large practice. He was a zealous Whig, the friend of Addison and, though of different political views, of Pope. He ended his career as physician to George I, who knighted him in 1714. The politician John Garth was a nephew of Samuel Garth. In 1699 Samuel Garth was called to give evidence in what became known as the Sarah Stout Affair. Spencer Cowper, a lawyer and member of a prominent Hertfordshire family, was accused with some friends of the murder of a Quaker woman called Sarah Stout. The prosecution asserted that because the body was floating when found, that it must have been put in the water after death. Opinions was given at the trial by Samuel Garth and Hans Sloane. It appears that aside from the fact that the body was floating when found, there was no other evidence to support the charge. The defendants were acquitted.Stephen, Leslie (1887). \\"Cowper, Spencer (1669-1728)\\". In Stephen, Leslie. Dictionary of National Biography. 12. London: Smith, Elder & Co. pp. 386‚Äì387. but the case remains interesting as an early example of attempts to use 'expert testimony' and forensic science evidence in a trial.Forensic Criminology, Andy Williams, Routledge 2015 He was notably sharp-tongued: \\"God help the country where St Leger is made a judge\\"! he exclaimed in 1714, on hearing that Sir John St Leger, an Irish Whig barrister, had been appointed a High Court judge in Ireland. For a while, he owned the manor of Edgcott in Buckinghamshire. He died on 18 January 1719. Works In 1697 he delivered the Harveian Oration, in which he advocated a scheme dating from some ten years back for providing dispensaries for the relief of the sick poor, as a protection against the greed of the apothecaries. In 1699 he published a mock-heroic poem, The Dispensary, in six cantos, which had an instant success, passing through three editions within a year. In this he ridiculed the apothecaries and their allies among the physicians. Garth‚Äôs work is a satirical take on the traditional epic poem, and is perhaps one of the better examples of the ‚Äúmedical poetry‚Äù genre. thumb > Long has he been of that amphibious fry, > Bold to prescribe, and busy to apply; > His shop the gazing vulgar's eyes employs, > With foreign trinkets and domestic toys. > Here mummies lay, most reverently stale, > And there the tortoise hung her coat of mail; > Not far from some huge shark's devouring head > The flying-fish their finny pinions spread. > Aloft in rows large poppy-heads were strung, > And near, a scaly alligator hung. > In this place drugs in musty heaps decay'd, > In that dried bladders and false teeth were laid. An inner room receives > the num'rous shoals > Of such as pay to be reputed fools; > Globes stand by globes, volumes on volumes lie, > And planetary schemes amuse the eye. > The sage in velvet chair here lolls at ease, > To promise future health for present fees; > Then, as from tripod, solemn shams reveals, > And what the stars know nothing of foretells. > Our manufactures now they merely sell, > And their true value treacherously tell; > Nay, they discover, too, their spite is such, > That health, than crowns more valued, cost not much; > Whilst we must steer our conduct by these rules, > To cheat as tradesmen, or to starve as fools. He is also remembered as the author of Claremont, a descriptive poem. He translated the Life of Otho in the fifth volume of Dryden's Plutarch, and also edited a translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses, to which Addison, Pope, and others contributed. His intervention ensured an honourable burial for John Dryden and he pronounced a eulogy at the funeral in Westminster Abbey. In 1704 he wrote the prologue for the play Squire Trelooby which his fellow Kit-Cat Club members Congreve, Vanbrugh and William Walsh had created.

Oranmore is east of Galway City on the edge of Oranmore Bay, an inlet of Galway Bay. Etymology Oranmore is the anglicisation of Uar√°n M√≥r. The first written record of Oranmore is in the Annals of the Four Masters. It was originally called Fuar√°n M√≥r (\\"Great Spring\\" in Irish). The name refers to a spring to the northwest of the main village. A bi-lingual information sign was erected by Oranmore Community Development Association in 2010 outlining the history of the spring.  History  = Pre-history = Evidence of prehistoric settlement in the Oranmore Parish area include a number of fulacht fiadh (at Frenchfort townland), ringforts (Rinn townland) and a megalithic structure (at Garraun South townland). Griffith's Valuation, a land survey completed in 1957, shows several such structures (sometimes colloquially and collectively known as fairy forts) in the area. = Medieval church ruins = The ruin of a medieval Roman Catholic church is one of the oldest buildings in Oranmore town. Its northern wall forms part of the enclosure which encompasses the church and its graveyard. The church is believed to date to the 13th century. If true, this means it was built no later than one and half century's after the initial Anglo-Norman Invasion of 1169 AD. The existing remains measure approximately 32 feet by 72 feet, however, there is evidence that the church was larger at one time. Some grave markers in the adjoining cemetery have no discernible name or date. Other graves have been marked with pieces of the fallen church walls. The oldest grave stone, with a discernible date inscription, is a Celtic cross dated 1661. It is no longer in its original location, but is instead lying on top of another, newer stone slab. There is a gated section within the graveyard set aside for the Presentation Sisters, an order of teaching sisters who established a convent in Oranmore in 1861. Some interments occurred within the ruined walls of the actual church. = Oramore Castle = Oranmore Castle is a tower house which was originally associated with the Norman Clanricarde family. It was built around the 15th century, reputedly on the site of an earlier structure. = St. Mary's Church = Oranmore's public library is in the deconsecrated St Mary's Church building Completed in 1803, St. Mary's is a large church building with a bell-cote above the front door and an elaborate ceiling. In 1972, it was replaced as the local parish church with the newer, larger Church of the Immaculate Conception. St. Mary's was deconsecrated and converted to become the town's public library. Its carved baptismal font was moved to the new church, but the graveyard was left intact. Economy The focus of industry has shifted from dairy agriculture to tourism, manufacturing and logistics.Rural Economic Development in Ireland, L Delheure, M Heneghan, R Jackson, D Meredith, 2014 Oranmore has four hotels and 23 restaurants. Railways Oranmore railway station opened on 1 August 1851, closed on 17 June 1963. A new station was built 1.4km west of the original station and was opened on 28 July 2013.Transport Minister to open Oranmore rail station - connacht tribune 23/06/13 Trains connect directly with Galway, Athenry, Athlone, Portarlington, Kildare and Dublin Heuston, as well as on the Western Rail Corridor to Ennis and Limerick. Education Oranmore has three primary schools, Scoil Iosaif Naofa, Scoil Mhuire and Gaelscoil de h√çde. Calasanctius College, founded in 1861 by the Presentation Sisters, is the secondary school in Oranmore. Transport Oranmore village is near the old N6 Galway to Dublin road and the old N18 from Galway to Limerick. The M6 Motorway connects to the existing road at Doughiska, as well as connecting with the M18 at Glenascaul. The former N6 leading into Oranmore has been reclassified as the R338 regional road. The M18 motorway was officially opened on 27 September 2017 and connects to the M6 at Rathmorrissey at a three-level interchange. This road runs close to Oranmore but does not connect directly to it, and instead, motorists have to access it using the R381 at Kiltiernan or the M6 at Rathmorrissey. Bus √âireann, Citylink, and Nestor Bus services through Oranmore serve Galway, Dublin, Cork, and Dublin and Shannon Airports. Oranmore aerodrome was a Royal Air Force base in World War I. It later became a civil airfield serving the city of Galway. It was the site where many British and Irish troops lost their lives and there is a ceremony in Oranmore each year to remember them.

So for example, the classical polynomial x^3 + 2xy + y^4 would become \\\\min\\\\\\\\{x+x+x,\\\\; 2+x+y,\\\\; y+y+y+y\\\\\\\\}. Such polynomials and their solutions have important applications in optimization problems, for example the problem of optimizing departure times for a network of trains. Tropical geometry is a variant of algebraic geometry in which polynomial graphs resemble piecewise linear meshes, and in which numbers belong to the tropical semiring instead of a field. Because classical and tropical geometry are closely related, results and methods can be converted between them. Algebraic varieties can be mapped to a tropical counterpart and, since this process still retains some geometric information about the original variety, it can be used to help prove and generalize classical results from algebraic geometry, such as the Brill‚ÄìNoether theorem, using the tools of tropical geometry.  History  The basic ideas of tropical analysis have been developed independently in the same notations by mathematicians working in various fields.See and references therein. The leading ideas of tropical geometry had appeared in different forms in the earlier works. For example, Victor Pavlovich Maslov introduced a tropical version of the process of integration. He also noticed that the Legendre transformation and solutions of the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation are linear operations in the tropical sense. However, only since the late 1990s has an effort been made to consolidate the basic definitions of the theory. This has been motivated by the applications to enumerative algebraic geometry, with ideas from Maxim Kontsevich and works by Grigory Mikhalkin among others. The adjective tropical in the name of the area was coined by French mathematicians in honor of the Hungarian-born Brazilian computer scientist Imre Simon, who wrote on the field. Jean-√âric Pin attributes the coinage to Dominique Perrin, whereas Simon himself attributes the word to Christian Choffrut. Quite independently of the use of the term \`\`tropical by the Brazilian school concerning the new mathematics, V.P. Maslov, in connection with the situation that occurred in the USSR during the 1980's (the \`\`perestroika years) and the opening of the \`\`iron curtain between the communist and capitalist countries, used this term repeatedly beginning from the mid 1980's. In numerous oral presentations (e.g. at the General Meetings of the USSR Academy of Sciences) and articles in the Soviet press, he warned that the opening of the curtain between the two groups of countries would inevitably lead to a situation similar to the one that arose in the 17th century when the ocean ceased to be boundary between Europe and the Americas, on the one hand, and Africa on the other. At that time cheap European and American goods were exchanged for expensive Africa ressourses and the slave trade began. This unequal exchange could be described by the rules of the new arithmetic, which Maslov and his followers first called \`\`idempotent (tropical) analysis or \`\`Min; + algebra. The term \`\`idempotent did not survive in the literature, while the term \`\`tropical, being more expressive and pleasant to the ear, became more popular, although different schools gave it somewhat different meanings.https://arxiv.org/pdf/1005.1247.pdfhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0001434615110085  Algebra background  Tropical geometry is based on the tropical semiring. This is defined in two ways, depending on max or min convention. The min tropical semiring is the semiring (\\\\R \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{+\\\\infty\\\\\\\\}, \\\\oplus, \\\\otimes), with the operations: : x \\\\oplus y = \\\\min\\\\\\\\{x, y \\\\\\\\}, : x \\\\otimes y = x + y. The operations \\\\oplus and \\\\otimes are referred to as tropical addition and tropical multiplication respectively. The unit for \\\\oplus is +\\\\infty, and the unit for \\\\otimes is 0. Similarly, the max tropical semiring is the semiring (\\\\R \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{-\\\\infty\\\\\\\\}, \\\\oplus, \\\\otimes), with operations: : x \\\\oplus y = \\\\max\\\\\\\\{x, y \\\\\\\\}, : x \\\\otimes y = x + y. The unit for \\\\oplus is -\\\\infty, and the unit for \\\\otimes is 0. These semirings are isomorphic, under negation x \\\\mapsto -x, and generally one of these is chosen and referred to simply as the tropical semiring. Conventions differ between authors and subfields: some use the min convention, some use the max convention. The tropical semiring operations model how valuations behave under addition and multiplication in a valued field. Some common valuated fields encountered in tropical geometry (with min convention) are: * \\\\Q or \\\\Complex with the trivial valuation, v(a) = 0 for all a e 0. * \\\\Q or its extensions with the p-adic valuation, v(p^n a/b) = n for a and b coprime to p. * The field of Laurent series \\\\Complex(\\\\\\\\!(t)\\\\\\\\!) (integer powers), or the field of (complex) Puiseux series \\\\Complex\\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\{t\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\}, with valuation returning the smallest exponent of t appearing in the series.  Tropical polynomials  A tropical polynomial is a function F\\\\colon \\\\R^n\\\\to \\\\R that can be expressed as the tropical sum of a finite number of monomial terms. A monomial term is a tropical product (and/or quotient) of a constant and variables from X_1,\\\\ldots , X_n. Thus a tropical polynomial F is the minimum of a finite collection of affine-linear functions in which the variables have integer coefficients, so it is concave, continuous, and piecewise linear. : \\\\begin{align} F(X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n) &= \\\\left(C_1 \\\\otimes X_1^{\\\\otimes a_{11}} \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes X_n^{\\\\otimes a_{n1}}\\\\right) \\\\oplus \\\\cdots \\\\oplus \\\\left(C_s \\\\otimes X_1^{\\\\otimes a_{1s}} \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes X_n^{\\\\otimes a_{ns}}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\min \\\\\\\\{C_1+a_{11}X_1+\\\\cdots+a_{n1}X_n,\\\\; \\\\ldots,\\\\; C_s+a_{1s}X_1+\\\\cdots+a_{ns}X_n\\\\\\\\}. \\\\end{align} Given a polynomial f in the Laurent polynomial ring K[x_1^{\\\\pm 1},\\\\ldots ,x_n^{\\\\pm 1}] where K is a valued field, the tropicalization of f, denoted \\\\operatorname{Trop}(f), is the tropical polynomial obtained from f by replacing multiplication and addition by their tropical counterparts and each constant in K by its valuation. That is, if : f = \\\\sum_{i=1}^s c_i x^{A_i} \\\\quad \\\\text{ with } A_1,\\\\ldots,A_s \\\\in \\\\Z^n, then :\\\\operatorname{Trop}(f) = \\\\bigoplus_{i=1}^s v(c_i) \\\\otimes X^{\\\\otimes A_i}. The set of points where a tropical polynomial F is non- differentiable is called its associated tropical hypersurface, denoted \\\\mathrm{V}(F) (in analogy to the vanishing set of a polynomial). Equivalently, \\\\mathrm{V}(F) is the set of points where the minimum among the terms of F is achieved at least twice. When F = \\\\operatorname{Trop}(f) for a Laurent polynomial f, this latter characterization of \\\\mathrm{V}(F) reflects the fact that at any solution to f = 0, the minimum valuation of the terms of f must be achieved at least twice in order for them all to cancel.  Tropical varieties  = Definitions = For X an algebraic variety in the algebraic torus (K^{\\\\times})^n, the tropical variety of X or tropicalization of X, denoted \\\\operatorname{Trop}(X), is a subset of \\\\R^n that can be defined in several ways. The equivalence of these definitions is referred to as the Fundamental Theorem of Tropical Geometry.  Intersection of tropical hypersurfaces  Let \\\\mathrm{I}(X) be the ideal of Laurent polynomials that vanish on X in K[x_1^{\\\\pm 1},\\\\ldots ,x_n^{\\\\pm 1}]. Define :\\\\operatorname{Trop}(X) = \\\\bigcap_{f \\\\in \\\\mathrm{I}(X)} \\\\mathrm{V}(\\\\operatorname{Trop}(f)) \\\\subseteq \\\\R^n. When X is a hypersurface, its vanishing ideal \\\\mathrm{I}(X) is a principal ideal generated by a Laurent polynomial f, and the tropical variety \\\\operatorname{Trop}(X) is precisely the tropical hypersurface \\\\mathrm{V}(\\\\operatorname{Trop}(f)). Every tropical variety is the intersection of a finite number of tropical hypersurfaces. A finite set of polynomials \\\\\\\\{f_1,\\\\ldots,f_r\\\\\\\\}\\\\subseteq \\\\mathrm{I}(X) is called a tropical basis for X if \\\\operatorname{Trop}(X) is the intersection of the tropical hypersurfaces of \\\\operatorname{Trop}(f_1),\\\\ldots,\\\\operatorname{Trop}(f_r). In general, a generating set of \\\\mathrm{I}(X) is not sufficient to form a tropical basis. The intersection of a finite number of a tropical hypersurfaces is called a tropical prevariety and in general is not a tropical variety.  Initial ideals  Choosing a vector \\\\mathbf{w} in \\\\R^n defines a map from the monomial terms of K[x_1^{\\\\pm 1},\\\\ldots ,x_n^{\\\\pm 1}] to \\\\R by sending the term m to \\\\operatorname{Trop}(m)(\\\\mathbf{w}). For a Laurent polynomial f = m_1 + \\\\cdots + m_s, define the initial form of f to be the sum of the terms m_i of f for which \\\\operatorname{Trop}(m_i)(\\\\mathbf{w}) is minimal. For the ideal \\\\mathrm{I}(X), define its initial ideal with respect to \\\\mathbf{w} to be :\\\\operatorname{in}_{\\\\mathbf{w}}\\\\mathrm{I}(X) = (\\\\operatorname{in}_{\\\\mathbf{w}}(f) : f \\\\in \\\\mathrm{I}(X)). Then define :\\\\operatorname{Trop}(X) = \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{w} \\\\in \\\\R^n : \\\\operatorname{in}_{\\\\mathbf{w}}\\\\mathrm{I}(X) eq (1)\\\\\\\\}. Since we are working in the Laurent ring, this is the same as the set of weight vectors for which \\\\operatorname{in}_{\\\\mathbf{w}}\\\\mathrm{I}(X) does not contain a monomial. When K has trivial valuation, \\\\operatorname{in}_{\\\\mathbf{w}}\\\\mathrm{I}(X) is precisely the initial ideal of \\\\mathrm{I}(X) with respect to the monomial order given by a weight vector \\\\mathbf{w}. It follows that \\\\operatorname{Trop}(X) is a subfan of the Gr√∂bner fan of \\\\mathrm{I}(X).  Image of the valuation map  Suppose that X is a variety over a field K with valuation v whose image is dense in \\\\R (for example a field of Puiseux series). By acting coordinate-wise, v defines a map from the algebraic torus (K^{\\\\times})^n to \\\\R^n. Then define :\\\\operatorname{Trop}(X) = \\\\overline{\\\\\\\\{(v(x_1),\\\\ldots,v(x_n)) : (x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) \\\\in X \\\\\\\\}}, where the overline indicates the closure in the Euclidean topology. If the valuation of K is not dense in \\\\R, then the above definition can be adapted by extending scalars to larger field which does have a dense valuation. This definition shows that \\\\operatorname{Trop}(X) is the non-Archimedean amoeba over an algebraically closed non-Archimedean field K. If X is a variety over \\\\Complex, \\\\operatorname{Trop}(X) can be considered as the limiting object of the amoeba \\\\operatorname{Log}_t(X) as the base t of the logarithm map goes to infinity.  Polyhedral complex  The following characterization describes tropical varieties intrinsically without reference to algebraic varieties and tropicalization. A set V in \\\\R^n is an irreducible tropical variety if it is the support of a weighted polyhedral complex of pure dimension d that satisfies the zero-tension condition and is connected in codimension one. When d is one, the zero-tension condition means that around each vertex, the weighted-sum of the out-going directions of edges equals zero. For higher dimension, sums are taken instead around each cell of dimension d-1 after quotienting out the affine span of the cell. The property that V is connected in codimension one means for any two points lying on dimension d cells, there is a path connecting them that does not pass through any cells of dimension less than d-1. = Tropical curves = The study of tropical curves (tropical varieties of dimension one) is particularly well developed and is strongly related to graph theory. For instance, the theory of divisors of tropical curves are related to chip-firing games on graphs associated to the tropical curves. Many classical theorems of algebraic geometry have counterparts in tropical geometry, including: * Pappus's hexagon theorem. * B√©zout's theorem. * The degree-genus formula. * The Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem. * The group law of the cubics. Oleg Viro used tropical curves to classify real curves of degree 7 in the plane up to isotopy. His method of patchworking gives a procedure to build a real curve of a given isotopy class from its tropical curve.  Applications  A tropical line appeared in Paul Klemperer's design of auctions used by the Bank of England during the financial crisis in 2007. Yoshinori Shiozawa defined subtropical algebra as max-times or min-times semiring (instead of max-plus and min-plus). He found that Ricardian trade theory (international trade without input trade) can be interpreted as subtropical convex algebra. This is a digest of Y. Shiozawa, \\"Subtropical Convex Geometry as the Ricardian Theory of International Trade\\" draft paper. Moreover, several optimization problems arising for instance in job scheduling, location analysis, transportation networks, decision making and discrete event dynamical systems can be formulated and solved in the framework of tropical geometry. A tropical counterpart of the Abel‚ÄìJacobi map can be applied to a crystal design. The weights in a weighted finite-state transducer are often required to be a tropical semiring. Tropical geometry can show self-organized criticality.

A crest is a component of a heraldic display, consisting of the device borne on top of the helm. Originating in the decorative sculptures worn by knights in tournaments and, to a lesser extent, battles, crests became solely pictorial after the 16th century (the era referred to by heraldists as that of \\"paper heraldry\\"). A normal heraldic achievement consists of the shield, above which is set the helm, on which sits the crest, its base encircled by a circlet of twisted cloth known as a torse. The use of the crest and torse independently from the rest of the achievement, a practice which became common in the era of paper heraldry, has led the term \\"crest\\" to be frequently but erroneously used to refer to the arms displayed on the shield, or to the achievement as a whole. Origin Sir Geoffrey Luttrell, with fan crests displaying his arms on both his helmet and his horse's head. From the Luttrell Psalter, c. 1330. The word \\"crest\\" derives from the Latin crista, meaning \\"tuft\\" or \\"plume\\", perhaps related to crinis, \\"hair\\". Crests had existed in various forms since ancient times: Roman officers wore fans of feathers or horsehair, which were placed longitudinally or transversely depending on the wearer's rank, and Viking helmets were often adorned with wings and animal heads. They first appeared in a heraldic context in the form of the metal fans worn by knights in the 12th and 13th centuries. These were primarily decorative, but may also have served a practical purpose by lessening or deflecting the blows of opponents' weapons (perhaps why their edges came to be serrated). These fans were generally of one colour, later evolving to repeat all or part of the arms displayed on the shield. The fan crest was later developed by cutting out the figure displayed on it, to form a metal outline; this evolved in the late 13th and early 14th centuries into a three-dimensional sculpture. These were usually made of cloth, leather or paper over a wooden or wire framework, and were typically in the form of an animal; also popular were wings, horns, human figures, and panaches of feathers. These were probably worn only in tournaments, not battle: not only did they add to the already considerable weight of the helm, they could also have been used by opponents as a handle to pull the wearer's head down. Laces, straps, or rivets were used to affix the crest to the helm, with the join being covered by a circlet of twisted cloth known as a torse or wreath, or by a coronet in the case of high-ranking nobles. Torses did not come into regular use in Britain until the 15th century, and are still uncommon on the Continent, where crests are usually depicted as continuing into the mantling. Crests were also sometimes mounted on a furred cap known as a chapeau, as in the royal crest of England. Later development By the 16th century the age of tournaments had ended, and physical crests largely disappeared. Their illustrated equivalents consequently began to be treated as simply two-dimensional pictures. Many crests from this period are physically impossible to bear on a helm, e.g. the crest granted to Sir Francis Drake in 1581, which consisted of a disembodied hand issuing from clouds and leading a ship around the globe (representing God's guidance). In the same period, different helms began to be used for different ranks: sovereigns' and knights' helms faced forwards (affront√©), whereas those of peers and gentlemen faced to the right (dexter). In the medieval period crests would always have faced the same way as the helm, but as a result of these rules, the directions of the crest and the helm might be at variance: a knight whose crest was a lion statant, would have the lion depicted as looking over the side of the helm, rather than towards the viewer. Torses also suffered artistically, being treated not as silken circlets, but as horizontal bars. Heraldry in general underwent something of a renaissance in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and many of the illogicalities of previous centuries were discarded. Crests are now generally not granted unless they could actually be used on a physical helm, and the rules about directions of helms are no longer rigidly observed. Usage Margrave of Brandenburg- Ansbach, with fifteen crested helms. The use of crests was once restricted to those of 'tournament rank', i.e. knights and above, but in modern times nearly all personal arms include crests. They are not generally used by women (with the exception of reigning queens) and clergymen, as they did not participate in war or tournaments and thus would not have helms on which to wear them. Some heraldists are also of the opinion that crests, as personal devices, are not suited for use by corporate bodies, but this is not widely observed. In continental Europe, particularly Germany, crests have a far greater significance than in Britain, and it is common for one person to display multiple crests with his arms; certain high-ranking noblemen are entitled to as many as seventeen. This practice did not exist in Britain until the modern era, and arms with more than one crest are still rare. In contrast to Continental practice, where a crest is never detached from its helm, a Briton with more than one crest may choose to display only one crested helm, and have the other crests simply floating in space. Though usually adopted through marriage to an heiress, examples exist of secondary crests being granted as augmentations: after defeating the Americans at the Battle of Bladensburg, Robert Ross was granted, in addition to his original crest, the crest of an arm holding the US flag with a broken flagstaff. Crest-badge of a member of the house of Douglas. British crests in an 1817 book. After the 16th century, it became common for armigers to detach the crest and wreath from the helm, and use them in the manner of a badge, displayed on crockery, carriage doors, stationery, etc. This led to the erroneous use of the term \\"crest\\" to mean \\"arms\\", which has become widespread in recent years. Unlike a badge, which can be used by any amount of relatives and retainers, a crest is personal to the armiger, and its use by others is considered usurpation. In Scotland, however, a member of a clan or house is entitled to use a \\"crest- badge\\", which consists of the chief's crest encircled by a strap and buckle inscribed with the chiefly motto. Marks of cadency are generally not used with crests, though it is not incorrect to do so, and the British royal family continue this practice. It is, however, widely observed in England that no two families may use the same crest. This is in contrast to Scottish practice, in which crests are less significant, and are often borne in the same form by a great many unrelated people. As a result of this lack of need for differentiation, Scottish crests tend to be less ornamental than their English counterparts. The usual torse around the crest is frequently replaced by some kind of coronet, known as a \\"crest-coronet\\". The standard form is a simplified ducal coronet, consisting of three fleurons on a golden circlet; these are not, however, indications of rank, though they are not generally granted nowadays except in special circumstances. In some modern examples, the crest features both a crest-coronet and a torse, though this practice is deprecated by purists. Orders of chivalry Perhaps the only places physical crests are still seen are the chapels of Britain's orders of chivalry: the Order of the Garter's St George's Chapel, the Order of the Thistle's Thistle Chapel, and the Order of the Bath's Henry VII Chapel. Within each chapel are rows of stalls for use by the knights; above these stalls are placed each knight's sword and crested helm. These are carved out of lime wood and painted and gilded by Ian Brennan, the official sculptor to the royal household.

It was once believed to be bottomless, and according to local legend the parishioners of Walkhampton (or Sheepstor) brought up the bell ropes from the parish church to test its depth. Even after tying the ropes together‚Äîa total length of over 500 feet‚Äîand weighting the end, it was claimed they were still unable to reach the bottom. This legend was disproved in the dry summer of 1844 when the pool was almost completely pumped out by the Plymouth Dock Water Company to supplement the water supply of Devonport Leat which runs along the hillside not far above the pool. The reality is that the pool is about deep at the western end and considerably less at the eastern end. The ancient cross next to the pool Crazywell Pool is the subject of other Dartmoor superstitions. The water level was said to rise and fall with the tides at sea, and it was claimed that at dusk the waters call out the name of the next parishioner to die and that their face can be seen in the surface of the pool at midnight on Midsummer's Eve. The pool was also said to be haunted during the Middle Ages by the Witch of Sheepstor, who gave people bad advice. Legend says she advised Piers Gaveston, who owned the Forest of Dartmoor from 1308, and who was in hiding here after being banished from the king's court, telling him to return to court, predicting that \\"his humbled head shall soon be high\\". Instead, he was captured by the king's enemies and beheaded and his head was set up on high battlements.

It lies at the end of the B3357 road, about east of Two Bridges. From here, the road continues eastwards as a minor road with restrictions on the size of vehicles, past Poundsgate and over Holne Bridge and New Bridge to Ashburton on the edge of the moor. Immediately east of the river crossing, this road ascends Dartmeet Hill, a long steep hill that climbs up the valley side. As the name suggests, Dartmeet is the meeting point of the two major tributaries of the River Dart: the East Dart and West Dart. The road bridge, built in 1792, spans the East Dart; just above it, at the side of the large carpark is an earlier, possibly medieval, clapper bridge, now partially collapsed. The actual confluence of the two rivers is just downstream of the bridge. Dartmeet is the official put in for the Upper Dart section of the River Dart for whitewater kayakers and canoeists. History Dartmeet is at the centre of an internationally important archaeological landscape mainly due to its prehistoric field systems, delineated by reaves, which are among the best preserved in north west Europe. Dartmeet was one of the boundary points mentioned (though not by name) in the 1240 Perambulation of the Forest of Dartmoor, the boundary coming down the East Dart from the Wallabrook, and continuing up the West Dart to the foot of the O Brook. The first documentary reference to the name (as Dartameet) was in a Duchy of Cornwall document dated 1616. Halfway up Dartmeet Hill, close to the road, lies the Coffin Stone on which coffins would be placed to allow the bearers to take a rest on the way to taking bodies for burial at Widecombe-in-the-Moor. The rock is split in two, along its length. Local legend has it that the body of a particularly wicked man was laid there. God took exception to this, and struck the stone with a thunderbolt, destroying the coffin and splitting the stone in two.

The term was coined by the tabloid press in the late 1990s and sees particular usage in mass media when the pound sterling is strong, as this drives down other states' prices in pounds. Origin In 1999, the Consumers' Association hired a stand at the British International Motor Show, only revealing on press day its true purpose in doing so‚Äîto highlight high British car prices. The organizers of the show, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, decided not to fan the media flames by ejecting the Consumers' Association. By this point, the phrase had already taken hold in the mass media, and it became a term in frequent use to describe anything that was wrong with Britain. It also proved to be one of the elements leading to a tipping point in the harmonisation of car prices within the EU. The campaign was devised by UK advertising agency Claydon Heeley, who are known for such \\"guerrilla marketing\\" work. Possible causes =Taxation= The level of indirect taxation applied to some products such as alcoholic drinks, tobacco, and petroleum may serve to disguise high profit margins by the retailer, but it may also work in the opposite direction, squeezing profits when there are other legal markets with lower taxation. While the standard UK rate of Value Added Tax (VAT) of 20% is generally triple or more that of US sales taxes, differences in prices can be far greater than this could account for.. The Crown Dependencies of Jersey and Guernsey are not part of the EU and Low Value Consignment Relief applied to imports. Retailers such as Play.com and Specsavers operated from Jersey or Guernsey specifically as a means of avoiding VAT. In the UK, imported commercial goods valued up to ¬£15 are exempt from VAT; for personal gifts, the exemption rises to ¬£36. As of July 2014, imports up to the value of ¬£135 are not liable for UK customs duty. =Business costs= Companies sometimes argue that some of their fixed costs are higher in the United Kingdom than elsewhere, such as for storage and distribution. The truthfulness of this defence varies from case to case. For example, the UK has around the fiftieth-highest population density of any country in the world, eight times that of the US and over twice that of France,List of countries by population density so transportation distances are unlikely to be a factor, and a parliamentary report concluded there was no great difference across EU states. Differences in storage costs are difficult to quantify, since many goods are shipped just in time directly from the manufacturer to the consumer, or in the case of electronic goods and services, they may not be physically shipped at all, but delivered via the Internet. =Over-regulation= Quality and safety regulations are roughly comparable between the markets discussed in this article, although some businesses argue that increasing safety regulation increases costs, which must be passed to the consumer. Retailers and manufacturers sometimes argue that legal requirements for guarantees and warranties differ between markets, and this must be factored into prices. =Easy Conversion= Simply converting $1 to ¬£1 is one reason for the price increase. For example, Wikipedia donations page asking for donations gives the following options, US customers: \\"This year, please consider making a donation of $5, $20, $50 or whatever you can to protect and sustain Wikipedia.\\" UK customers: \\"This year, please consider making a donation of ¬£5, ¬£20, ¬£50 or whatever you can to protect and sustain Wikipedia.\\" This also applies to digital downloads where the price is not a round number and where the costs are the same. > \\"The ever popular method of simply swapping the $ sign for a ¬£ sign sees a > monthly subscription to Spotify priced at $9.99 in the US and ¬£9.99 in the > UK.\\" Says UK consumer magazine Which? At its launch, Microsoft Windows Vista had a suggested retail price of $249 (¬£127) in the United States and ¬£249 ($487) in the United Kingdom. This made it almost twice as expensive to buy in the UK than in the U.S. Remedies =Shipping from abroad= Perceived or actual higher prices in the UK often have the effect of encouraging British consumers to order goods from the Internet, whether from UK businesses claiming to break a price cartel or directly from abroad, including via eBay and other online auction sites. Most American Internet retailers ship directly to consumers in the UK which, assuming customs provisions are met, can provide a worthwhile alternative to higher UK prices. Many believe that competition from the Internet and the Eurozone general free trade will tend to normalize retail prices and put an end the UK being known as \\"Treasure Island\\". However, \\"customer not present\\" transactions can generally not be made for legally controlled products such as alcohol, tobacco, solvents, fuels, or medication. Electrical and electronic products designed for the North American market may have to be converted to run on EU voltage and TV systems, annulling any benefit in reduced prices. Other products may also differ in specification, or they may not come with the same warranties or guarantees, making returning faulty goods difficult, or at least not cost effective. Furthermore, products for sale in the European Union should carry the CE mark for safety, but products purchased in the United States or designed for the US market are often supplied with other safety designations such as the UL listing. =Internet delivery= Products and services delivered over the Internet do not face physical barriers for shipping the goods, so one might expect Internet-based markets to normalize across free trading countries. Apple's iTunes Store formerly operated a model in which purchases can only be made in a domain where the users' means of payment is registered. UK customers were therefore tied to the offerings in the UK iTunes Store, proving a disadvantage both in price and selection. On 9 January 2008, however, Apple conceded that this was unfair practice and promised to harmonise prices with Europe within six months, citing record labels' wholesale music prices as the reason.

It is a eutectic alloy of 50% bismuth, 26.7% lead, 13.3% tin, and 10% cadmium by mass. The alloy is named for Barnabas Wood.  Applications  Wood's metal is useful as a low-melting solder, low-temperature casting metal, high-temperature coupling fluid in heat baths, and as a fire-melted valve element in fire sprinkler systems in buildings. Medical gas cylinders in the United Kingdom have a Wood's metal seal, which melts in fire, allowing the gas to escape and reducing the risk of gas explosion. Wood's metal is commonly used as a filler when bending thin- walled metal tubes. For this use the tubing is filled with molten Wood's metal. After this filler solidifies, the tubing is bent. The filler prevents the tube collapsing. The Wood's metal is then removed by heating, often by immersion in boiling water. Other uses include making custom-shaped apertures and blocks (for example, electron-beam cutouts and lung blocks) for medical radiation treatment, making casts of keys that are hard to duplicate otherwise and making metal inlays in wood. Wood's metal is useful in machine shops and technical laboratories when alternative means of holding delicate parts become necessary. It is used as an additional hardened layer to allow the proper gripping and machining of an object. The object is immersed in melted Wood's metal to completely or partially coat it, forming a layer from a few millimeters up to few centimeters thick, depending on how the object will be held in place. After cooling, the new assembly is clamped by conventional means. This method is most useful for one-off or limited-production workpieces, when construction of a special clamping or holding jig would be neither cost-effective nor offer maximum holding capability. Wood's metal is also useful for repairing antiques. For example, a bent piece of sheet metal may be repaired by casting a Wood's metal die from an intact example: The low melting temperature of Wood's metal makes it unlikely to harm the original, and the damaged piece can then be clamped in the die and slowly tightened to form it back into shape. Wood's metal has long been used by model railroad enthusiasts to add weight to locomotives, increasing traction and the number of cars that can be pulled. Wood's metal is also used in the making of extracellular electrodes for the electro-physiological recording of neural activity.Frank K., Becker M. C. Microelectrodes for recording and stimulation. In: Physical techniques in biological research, edited by Nastuk W. L. New York: Academic Press, 1964, p. 23‚Äì84. Like other fusible alloys, e.g. Rose's metal, Wood's metal can be used as a heat-transfer medium in hot baths. Hot baths with Rose's and Wood's metals are not in routine use but are employed for temperatures above . Wood's metal has a modulus of elasticity of 12.7 GPa and a yield strength of 26.2 MPa.  Toxicity  Wood's metal is toxic because it contains lead and cadmium, and contamination of bare skin is considered harmful. Vapour from cadmium-containing alloys is also known to pose a danger to humans. Cadmium poisoning carries the risk of cancer, anosmia (loss of sense of smell), and damage to the liver, kidneys, nerves, bones, and respiratory system. Field's metal is a non-toxic alternative. The dust may form flammable mixtures with air.  Related alloys  Several other alloys with similar low melting points are listed here.

Most notable amongst his works are the seminal arcade video games Defender and Robotron: 2084 in the early 1980s, and the Cruis'n series of driving games for Midway Games in the 1990s. He co-founded Vid Kidz in the early 1980s and currently leads his own development studio, Raw Thrills Inc. In 2008 Eugene Jarvis was named the first Game Designer in Residence by DePaul University's Game Development program. His family owns the Jarvis Wines company in Napa, CA. Early life and education Jarvis was born in Palo Alto, California in 1955 and grew up in Menlo Park. He has an older sister, Diane, and a younger sister, Helen. His first game was chess, which he played as a young child; he was one of the best players at Bellarmine College Preparatory in San Jose. Jarvis's first encounter with computers came while he was in high school attending a one-day course on FORTRAN programming given by IBM. Jarvis originally intended to become a biochemist but decided on studying computers instead. At the University of California, Berkeley, Jarvis did FORTRAN programming on mainframes. At Berkeley he got his first taste of computer gaming, playing Space War in the basement of the physics lab. He received his B.S. in EECS in 1976 from Berkeley. In his last days before graduation, he interviewed with Atari, but did not receive a call back. Career Having an interest in natural language processing, Jarvis was hired by Hewlett Packard to help create a COBOL compiler. He disliked the boring HP culture and quit after only three days into the six-year project. A few days later, three months after his interview, Atari finally called him back, interested in hiring him. He joined them and started programming some of the first pinball games that used microprocessors. Atari's pinball development branch failed a few years later, so he moved to Chicago to continue programming pinball games for Williams Electronics. =Video arcade games= As Jarvis worked on pinball games at Williams in the late 1970s, Space Invaders was released, sparking great interest in microprocessor video games. Jarvis wanted to try making a video game. When thinking of design ideas with famed pinball designer Steve Ritchie, they developed the concept for Defender ‚Äì a side-scroller with the player flying over the surface of a planet. Defender (1980) was Jarvis's first video game and turned out to be a huge hit, helping kick off the golden age of arcade games and eventually becoming one of the highest grossing video games ever. Williams expanded greatly with the success of Defender, but Jarvis left to found an independent game development firm called Vid Kidz with Larry DeMar in February 1981. After four months of tag-team programming between DeMar and Jarvis, they produced Vid Kidz's first game: Stargate (1981), an enhanced sequel to Defender that they sold to Williams. Jarvis's next hit with Vid Kidz was the high-action game Robotron, which was produced by Williams in 1982. It took 6 months to develop. He then designed Blaster, a sort-of Robotron sequel set in 2085 ‚Äî after the robots destroyed humanity ‚Äî but with different, 3D gameplay. Though a marvel to look at, Blaster was not quite as successful or remembered as his previous video games. The video game crash of 1983 hit Williams hard, forcing them to cut back and reverting to much of their pre-Defender business. Jarvis left Vid Kidz in 1984 to attend Stanford University, where he gained an MBA in 1986. He continued making games, designing Narc (1989) and helping develop Smash TV (1990), which drew comparisons to Robotron. The next big leap for Jarvis was 3D. He had been interested in virtual reality since attending Berkeley in the 1970s. He and a group of others left Midway (which Williams had purchased in 1988) to experiment with VR, but disappointingly came to the realization that VR headsets were not catching on. They did find potential in multi-screen cockpit simulators though. He helped create 3D texture mapping hardware which ended up being used in his Cruis'n series of games. Next Generation listed Jarvis in their \\"75 Most Important People in the Games Industry of 1995\\", both for the massive success of Defender and for Cruis'n USA, which they said is \\"arguably neck-and-neck with Daytona USA as the most popular driving game of 1994.\\" He now works for his own studio, Raw Thrills Inc., and his more recent work has returned him to the coin-op arcade game world with Target: Terror, a first-person perspective shooting game based on the \\"war on terror\\", introduced in Spring of 2004. The second game from his studio, The Fast and the Furious debuted in the Fall of 2004 at the same time as the Target: Terror Gold update kit. Since the release of Target Terror, the company has experienced strong growth, developing or releasing titles including Nicktoons Nitro, Guitar Hero Arcade, H2Overdrive, the Big Buck series of games and Jurassic Park Arcade among others. In 2006, Raw Thrills purchased game developer Play Mechanix which is led by his friend George Petro. Together the two companies have developed arcade and video redemption games for ICE and Bandai Namco Amusements America. In 2008 Jarvis was named DePaul University's first Game Designer in Residence. His involvement at DePaul's Game Development program includes lectures, supervision of game projects, and input on curriculum. He was recognized as the NY-AMOA Man of the Year in 2009 and he received the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Pioneer Award in 2013 Jarvis is the only video game designer to have his work featured on a U.S. Postage Stamp - two 80's era children are depicted playing Defender on the video games stamp for the \\"Celebrate the Century\\" series. He also appeared in a cameo on the TV series NewsRadio (in the 3rd season episode \\"Arcade\\") as \\"Delivery Man #3\\", a character who delivers a distracting arcade video game machine to the office. That arcade game is his own creation Stargate, which within the episode is called Stargate Defender and is described as being about \\"saving the humanoids\\" while avoiding the \\"Yllabian Space Guppies\\". In 2018 Defender was included in the Chicago New Media 1973-1992 exhibition, that was curated by jonCates.

Such eutectic alloys are liquids at room temperature, typically melting at , while commercial Galinstan melts at . Galinstan is composed of 68.5%Ga, 21.5%In, and 10.0%Sn (by weight). Due to the low toxicity and low reactivity of its component metals, galinstan finds use as a replacement for many applications that previously employed the toxic liquid mercury or the reactive NaK (sodium‚Äìpotassium alloy). Name The name \\"Galinstan\\" is a portmanteau of gallium, indium, and stannum (Latin for \\"tin\\"). The brand name \\"Galinstan\\" is a registered trademark of the German company Geratherm Medical AG, but \\"galinstan\\" is in common use for any eutectic alloy of gallium, indium, and tin. Physical properties Galinstan from a broken thermometer, easily wetting a piece of glass *Boiling point: >1300¬∞C *Melting point: ‚àí19¬∞C *Vapour pressure: <10‚àí8Torr (at 500¬∞C) *Density: 6.44g/cm3 (at 20¬∞C) *Solubility: Insoluble in water or organic solvents *Viscosity: 0.0024Pa¬∑s (at 20¬∞C) *Thermal conductivity: 16.5W¬∑m‚àí1¬∑K‚àí1 *Electrical conductivity: 3.46√ó106 S/m (at 20¬∞C) *Surface tension: s = 0.535‚Äì0.718 N/m (at 20¬∞C, dependent on producer) *Specific heat capacity: 296 J¬∑kg‚àí1¬∑K‚àí1 Galinstan tends to be \\"wet\\" and adhere to many materials, including glass, which limits its use compared to mercury. Uses Galinstan is commercially used as a mercury replacement in thermometers due to its nontoxic properties, but the inner tube surface must be coated with gallium oxide to prevent the alloy from wetting the glass surface. Galinstan has higher reflectivity and lower density than mercury. In the field of astronomy it is considered as a replacement for mercury in liquid-mirror telescopes. Extract of page 48.4 Galinstan may be used as a thermal interface for computer hardware cooling solutions, though major obstacles for widespread use are its cost and aggressive corrosive properties (it corrodes many other metals such as aluminium by dissolving them). It is also electrically conductive, and so needs to be applied more carefully than regular non-conductive compounds. Two thermal interfaces have already been developed: Thermal Grizzly Conductonaut and Coolaboratory Liquid Ultra, with thermal conductivities of 73 and 38.4 W/mK respectively. However, they must be carefully applied with a Q-tip (unlike ordinary thermal compounds, where no manual spreading is needed), and cannot be used on aluminum heatsinks as aforementioned. Galinstan is difficult to use for cooling fission-based nuclear reactors, because indium has a high absorption cross section for thermal neutrons, efficiently absorbing them and inhibiting the fission reaction. Conversely, it is being investigated as a possible coolant for fusion reactors. Unlike other liquid metals used in this application, such as lithium and mercury, the nonreactivity makes galinstan a safer material to use. =X-ray equipment= Extremely high-intensity sources of 9.25 keV X-rays (gallium K-alpha line) for X-ray phase microscopy of fixed tissue (such as mouse brain), from a focal spot about 10 Œºm √ó 10 Œºm, and 3-D voxels of about one cubic micrometer, may be obtained with an X-ray source that uses a liquid-metal galinstan anode. The metal flows from a nozzle downward at a high speed, and the high-intensity electron source is focused upon it. The rapid flow of metal carries current, but the physical flow prevents a great deal of anode heating (due to forced-convective heat removal), and the high boiling point of galinstan inhibits vaporization of the anode.

He was known as the Ruhr Cannibal (Ruhrkannibale), Ruhr Hunter (Ruhrj√§ger) and the Duisburg Man-Eater (Duisburger Menschenfresser). He was convicted of eight murders but confessed to a total of 14 which he committed in and around the Ruhr metropolitan region. Early life Born the son of a miner in Hindenburg (Zabrze), Province of Upper Silesia, Kroll was the sixth of nine children. After the end of World War II, during which his father was a prisoner of war, Kroll's family moved to North Rhine-Westphalia. Crimes He began killing in 1955, after his mother died. Around 1960, Kroll went to Duisburg and found work as a toilet attendant for Mannesmann. Afterwards he worked for Thyssen Industries and moved to Friesenstrasse 24, Laar, a district of Duisburg. At that time he resumed killing people. =List of victims= * 8 February 1955 - Irmgard Strehl, 19, raped and stabbed to death. Her disemboweled body was found in a barn in L√ºdinghausen. * 1956 - Erika Schuletter, 12, raped and strangled in Kirchhellen which is now part of Bottrop. * 16 June 1959 - Klara Frieda Tesmer, 24, murdered in the meadows of the Rhine, near Rheinhausen. A mechanic, Heinrich Ott, was arrested for the crime. He hanged himself in jail. * 26 July 1959 - Manuela Knodt, 16, raped and strangled in the City Park of Essen. Slices of flesh were carved from her buttocks and thighs. * 23 April 1962 - Petra Giese, 13, raped and strangled in Dinslaken-Bruckhausen. Vinzenz Kuehn was arrested and convicted. * 4 June 1962 - Monika Tafel, 12, killed in Walsum, slices of flesh carved from her buttocks. Walter Quicker was arrested for the crime. He was later released, but was driven by neighbors to suicide in October. * 3 September 1962 - Barbara Bruder, 12, abducted in Burscheid. Her body was never found. * 22 August 1965 - Hermann Schmitz, 25, and his girlfriend Marion Veen were attacked as they sat in a car in a lover's lane in Duisburg-Gro√üenbaum. Hermann--Kroll's only male victim--was killed, but Veen escaped. * 13 September 1966 - Ursula Rohling, 20, strangled in Foersterbusch Park near Marl. Her boyfriend Adolf Schickel committed suicide after being falsely accused of the crime. * 22 December 1966 - Ilona Harke, aged 5, raped and drowned in a ditch in Wuppertal. * 12 July 1969 - Maria Hettgen, 61, raped and strangled at H√ºckeswagen. * 21 May 1970 - Jutta Rahn, 13, strangled walking home from a train station. Peter Schay was arrested and eventually released. He confessed to the crime in 1976 after being hounded by his neighbors. * 8 May 1976 - Karin Toepfer, 10, raped and strangled in Voerde. * 3 July 1976 - Marion Ketter, 4. Parts of her body were in the process of being simmered when Kroll was arrested. =Method= Kroll was very particular about where he killed, only killing in the same place on a few occasions years apart. This, and the fact that there were a number of other killers operating in the area at the time, helped him to evade capture. Kroll would surprise his victims and strangle them quickly. Afterward he would strip the body and have intercourse with it, often masturbating over it again. He would then mutilate and cut off pieces to be eaten later. Upon returning home, he would have intercourse again with a rubber sex doll he had for this purpose. =Capture= On 3 July 1976, Kroll was arrested for kidnapping and killing a four-year-old girl named Marion Ketter. As police went from home to home, a neighbor approached a policeman and told him that the waste-pipe in his apartment building had blocked up, and when he had asked his neighbor, Kroll, whether he knew what had been blocking the pipe, Kroll had simply replied, \\"guts\\". Upon this report, the police went up to Kroll's apartment and found the body of Marion Ketter cut up: some parts were in the refrigerator, a small hand was cooking in a pan of boiling water and the entrails were found stuck in the waste-pipe. Kroll was immediately arrested. =Trial and death= He admitted killing Marion Ketter and gave details of 13 other murders and one attempted murder over the previous two decades. Kroll said that he often sliced portions of flesh from his victims to cook and eat them, claiming that he did this to save on his grocery bills. In custody, he believed that he was going to get a simple operation to cure him of his homicidal urges and would then be released from prison. Instead he was charged with eight murders and one attempted murder. In April 1982, after a 151-day trial, he was convicted on all counts and was given a life sentence.

It has about 3000 inhabitants. Gas explosion On July 30, 2004 a high-pressure natural gas pipeline operated at a pressure of 70 bar ruptured following recent third party damage. Twenty-four people died as a result and 150 survivors were hospitalised, most with severe burns. It is thought that damage to the pipeline occurred during the final stages of a car park construction project. Notice of the work had been given to the pipeline operator, Fluxys, and one of their operatives had regularly attended the site through the course of the project. Damage to the pipeline probably occurred as a mechanical soil stabiliser was driven over it or near by. This resulted in several evenly spaced (but not full depth) gouges in the steel wall of the pipeline. Two weeks after the completion of the car park gas pressure was increased in the pipeline, which then ruptured with the fault centred on a 350 mm long gouge. Other contributing factors to the accident may have been a reduced cover over the pipeline as a result of levelling, the way information was passed down the sub-contracting chain to workers and the frequency and adequacy of supervision by the pipeline operator at the site. 250px References Category:Ath Category:Populated places in Hainaut (province) Category:Man-made disasters in Belgium Category:Pipeline accidents Category:2004 in Belgium Category:2004 industrial disasters ","title":"Ghislenghien"},{"id":"867108","text":"Low power may refer to: * Radio transmitters that send out relatively little power: ** QRP operation, using \\"the minimum power necessary to carry out the desired communications\\", in amateur radio. ** Cognitive radio transceivers typically automatically reduce the transmitted power to much less than the power required for reliable one-way broadcasts. ** Low-power broadcasting that the power of the broadcast is less, i.e. the radio waves are not intended to travel as far as from typical transmitters. ** Low-power communication device, a radio transmitter used in low-power broadcasting. * Low-power electronics, the consumption of electric power is deliberately low, e.g. notebook processors. * Power (statistics), in which low power is due to small sample sizes or poorly designed experiments See also * Power (disambiguation) ","title":"Low power"},{"id":"867111","text":"Jack Davis may refer to: *Mildirn, also known as Jack Davis (1835‚Äì1914), Aboriginal leader, translator and merchant *Jack Davis (actor) (1914‚Äì1992) *Jack Davis (guard, born 1932) (1932‚Äì2013), American football player *Jack Davis (guard, born 1933) (1933‚Äì2015), American football player *Jack Davis (athlete) (1930‚Äì2012), Olympic hurdler *Jack Davis (Canadian politician) (1916‚Äì1991) *Jack Davis (cartoonist) (1924‚Äì2016) *Jack Davis, engineer who worked on the ENIAC computer in the 1940s *Jack Davis (footballer) (1908‚Äì1991), Australian rules footballer *Jack Davis (industrialist) (born 1933) *Jack Davis (playwright) (1917‚Äì2000), Australian playwright and poet *Jack Davis (prospector) (1879‚Äì1949) *Jack Davis (Illinois politician) (1935-2018) *Jack E.

He was a leading figure in the Harlem Renaissance. Aside from the artistic merits of his work, Van Der Zee produced the most comprehensive documentation of the period. Among his most famous subjects during this time were Marcus Garvey, Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson and Countee Cullen. Biography Born in Lenox, Massachusetts, Van Der Zee demonstrated an early gift for music, and was initially aspired to career as a professional violinist. Van Der Zee's second interest was in photography. He bought his first camera when he was a teenager, and improvised a darkroom in his parents' home. He took hundreds of photographs of his family as well as his hometown of Lenox. Van Der Zee was one of the first people to provide an early documentation of his community life in small town New England. In 1906, he moved with his father and brother to Harlem in New York City, where he worked as a waiter and elevator operator. By now Van Der Zee was a skilled pianist and aspiring professional violinist. He would become the primary creator and one of the five performers in a group known as the Harlem Orchestra. In 1915, he moved to Newark, New Jersey, where he took a job in a portrait studio, first as a darkroom assistant and then as a portraitist. He returned to Harlem the following year, just as large numbers of Black immigrants and migrants were arriving into that part of the city. He set up a studio at the Toussaint Conservatory of Art and Music with his sister, Jennie Louise Van de Zee, also known as Madame E Toussaint, who had founded the conservatory in 1911. \\"Evening Attire,\\" 1922, by Van Der Zee, in the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum In 1916, he and his second wife, Gaynella Greenlee, launched the Guarantee Photo Studio on West 125th Street in Harlem. His business boomed during World War I, and the portraits he shot from this period until 1945 have demanded the majority of critical attention. In 1919, he photographed the victory parade of the returning 369th Infantry Regiment, a predominantly African American unit sometimes called the \\"Harlem Hellfighters.\\" During the 1920s and 1930s, he produced hundreds of photographs recording Harlem's growing middle class. Its residents entrusted the visual documentation of their weddings, funerals, celebrities and sports stars, and social life to his carefully composed images. Quickly Van Der Zee became the most successful photographer in Harlem. Among his many renowned subjects were poet Countee Cullen, dancer Bill (\\"Bojangles\\") Robinson, Charles M. \\"Daddy\\" Grace, Joe Louis, Florence Mills, and black nationalist leader Marcus Garvey. By the early 1930s Van Der Zee found it harder to make an income from his work in photography, partly because of the strained economic circumstances of many of his customers and partly because the growing popularity of personal cameras reduced the need for professional photography. Van Der Zee worked predominantly in the studio and used a variety of props, including architectural elements, backdrops, and costumes, to achieve stylized tableaux vivant in keeping with late Victorian and Edwardian visual traditions. Sitters often copied celebrities of the 1920s and 1930s in their poses and expressions, and he retouched negatives and prints heavily to achieve an aura of glamour. He also created funeral photographs between the wars. These works were later collected in The Harlem Book of the Dead (1978), with a foreword by Toni Morrison. James Van Der Zee died in Washington, D.C. on May 15, 1983. Ten years later the National Portrait Gallery exhibited his work as a posthumous tribute to his remarkable genius.  Works  = Commission from UNIA = In the spring and summer of 1924, Van Der Zee worked to document the members and activities of Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). He took thousands of photographs on this assignment, some of which were featured in a calendar issued to members in 1925. Fulfilling Garvey's wishes, Van Der Zee's job was to project a positive image of the Association, especially to emphasize the strength and social standing of its membership, the so-called Garveyites. Nowhere in Van Der Zee's visual record was there any hint of the controversy surrounding Garvey in the early 1920s, a period when the leader was subject to public interrogation, quarrels with the writer and philosopher W.E.B. DuBois, and legal proceedings against him on charges of mail fraud. = Harlem on My Mind = In 1969, Van Der Zee gained worldwide recognition when his work was featured in the exhibition Harlem on My Mind at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. His inclusion in the exhibition was somewhat by accident. In December 1967, a researcher for the exhibition (and a photographer in his own right), Reginald McGhee, came across Van Der Zee's Harlem studio and asked if he happened to have any photographs from the 1920s and 30s. In a story recounted by photo historian Rodger C. Birt, Van Der Zee showed him the boxes and boxes of negatives he had kept from this period. These photographs would become the core of Harlem on My Mind‚Äîand the feature of the exhibit that critics routinely praised as the show's biggest revelation. As art historian Sharon Patton observed, Van Der Zee not only documented the Harlem Renaissance, but also helped create it. Harlem on My Mind marked a controversy between the Met and a number of practicing artists then living and working and Harlem. Painters including Romare Bearden and Benny Andrews protested the show for its emphasis on social history and experience, at the expense‚Äîas they viewed it‚Äîof interest in the artistic legacy of black New York artists. On opening day, a picket line formed in front of the Met. Andrews carried a sign reading: \\"Visit The Metropolitan Museum of Photography.\\" Photographic techniques and artistry Works by Van Der Zee are artistic as well as technically proficient. His work was in high demand, in part due to his experimentation and skill in double exposures and in retouching negatives of children. One theme that recurs in his photographs was the emergent black middle class, which he captured using traditional techniques in often idealistic images. Negatives were retouched to show glamor and an aura of perfection. This affected the likeness of the person photographed, but he felt each photo should transcend the subject. His carefully posed family portraits reveal that the family unit was an important aspect of Van Der Zee's life. \\"I tried to see that every picture was better-looking than the person ... I had one woman come to me and say 'Mr. VanDerZee my friends tell that's a nice picture, but it doesn't look like you.' That was my style\\", said VanDerZee. Van Der Zee sometimes combined several photos in one image, for example by adding a ghostly child to an image of a wedding to suggest the couple's future, or by superimposing a funeral image upon a photograph of a dead woman to give the feeling of her eerie presence. Van Der Zee said, \\"I wanted to make the camera take what I thought should be there.\\" Van Der Zee was a working photographer who supported himself through portraiture, and he devoted time to his professional work before his more artistic compositions. Many famous residents of Harlem were among his subjects. In addition to portraits, Van Der Zee photographed organizations, events, and other businesses.

The Balto-Slavic languages are a branch of the Indo- European family of languages. It traditionally comprises the Baltic and Slavic languages. Baltic and Slavic languages share several linguistic traits not found in any other Indo-European branch, which points to a period of common development. Although the notion of a Balto-Slavic unity has been contested (partly due to political controversies), there is now a general consensus among specialists in Indo-European linguistics to classify Baltic and Slavic languages into a single branch, with only some details of the nature of their relationship remaining in dispute. A Proto-Balto-Slavic language is reconstructable by the comparative method, descending from Proto-Indo-European by means of well-defined sound laws, and out of which modern Slavic and Baltic languages descended. One particularly innovative dialect separated from the Balto-Slavic dialect continuum and became ancestral to the Proto-Slavic language, from which all Slavic languages descended. Historical dispute The nature of the relationship of the Balto-Slavic languages has been the subject of much discussion from the very beginning of historical Indo-European linguistics as a scientific discipline. A few are more intent on explaining the similarities between the two groups not in terms of a linguistically \\"genetic\\" relationship, but by language contact and dialectal closeness in the Proto-Indo-European period. Various schematic sketches of possible alternative Balto-Slavic language relationships; Van Wijk, 1923. Baltic and Slavic share many close phonological, lexical, morphosyntactic and accentological similarities (listed below). The early Indo-Europeanists Rasmus Rask and August Schleicher (1861) proposed a simple solution: From Proto-Indo-European descended Balto-German-Slavonic language, out of which Proto-Balto-Slavic (later split into Proto-Baltic and Proto-Slavic) and Germanic emerged. ‚Äî xii \\\\+ 312 s. Schleicher's proposal was taken up and refined by Karl Brugmann, who listed eight innovations as evidence for a Balto-Slavic branch in the Grundriss der vergleichenden Grammatik der indogermanischen Sprachen (‚ÄúOutline of the Comparative Grammar of the Indo-Germanic Languages‚Äù). The Latvian linguist JƒÅnis Endzelƒ´ns thought, however, that any similarities among Baltic and Slavic languages resulted from intensive language contact, i.e. that they were not genetically more closely related and that there was no common Proto- Balto-Slavic language. Antoine Meillet (1905, 1908, 1922, 1925, 1934), a French linguist, in reaction to Brugmann's hypothesis, propounded a view according to which all similarities of Baltic and Slavic occurred accidentally, by independent parallel development, and that there was no Proto-Balto-Slavic language. In turn, the Polish linguist Rozwadowski suggests that the similarities among Baltic and Slavic languages are a result of both a genetic relationship and later language contact. Thomas Olander corroborates the claim of genetic relationship in his research in the field of comparative Balto-Slavic accentology. Even though some linguists still reject a genetic relationship, most scholars accept that Baltic and Slavic languages experienced a period of common development. This view is also reflected in most modern standard textbooks on Indo-European linguistics. Gray and Atkinson's (2003) application of language-tree divergence analysis supports a genetic relationship between the Baltic and Slavic languages, dating the split of the family to about 1400 BCE. Internal classification The traditional division into two distinct sub-branches (i.e. Slavic and Baltic) is mostly upheld by scholars who accept Balto-Slavic as a genetic branch of Indo- European. There is a general consensus that the Baltic languages can be divided into East Baltic (Lithuanian, Latvian) and West Baltic (Old Prussian). The internal diversity of Baltic points at a much greater time-depth for the breakup of the Baltic languages in comparison to the Slavic languages. \\"Traditional\\" Balto-Slavic tree model This bipartite division into Baltic and Slavic was first challenged in the 1960s, when Vladimir Toporov and Vyacheslav Ivanov observed that the apparent difference between the \\"structural models\\" of the Baltic languages and the Slavic languages is the result of the innovative nature of Proto-Slavic, and that the latter had evolved from an earlier stage which conformed to the more archaic \\"structural model\\" of the Proto-Baltic dialect continuum.–ë–∏—Ä–Ω–±–∞—É–º –•. –û –¥–≤—É—Ö –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è—Ö –≤ —è–∑—ã–∫–æ–≤–æ–º —Ä–∞–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∏–∏ // –í–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å—ã —è–∑—ã–∫–æ–∑–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è, 1985, ‚Ññ 2, —Å—Ç—Ä. 36 Frederik Kortlandt (1977, 2018) has proposed that West Baltic and East Baltic are in fact not more closely related to each other than either of them is related to Slavic, and Balto-Slavic therefore can be split into three equidistant branches: East Baltic, West Baltic and Slavic. Alternative Balto-Slavic tree model Although supported by a number of scholars, Kordtlandt's hypothesis is still a minority view. Some scholars accept Kordtlandt's division into three branches as the default assumption, but nevertheless believe that there is sufficient evidence to unite East Baltic and West Baltic in an intermediate Baltic node. The tripartite split is supported by glottochronologic studies by V. V. Kromer, whereas two computer-generated family trees (from the early 2000s) that include Old Prussian have a Baltic node parallel to the Slavic node. ‚Äî the so- called \\"Pennsylvania Tree\\" (pg. 12) and the so-called \\"New Zealand Tree\\" (pg. 19) Area of Balto-Slavic dialect continuum (purple) with proposed material cultures correlating to speakers Balto-Slavic in Bronze Age (white). Red dots= archaic Slavic hydronyms. Historical expansion The sudden expansion of Proto-Slavic in the sixth and the seventh century (around 600 CE, uniform Proto-Slavic with no detectable dialectal differentiation was spoken from Thessaloniki in Greece to Novgorod in Russia) is, according to some, connected to the hypothesis that Proto-Slavic was in fact a koin√© of the Avar state, i.e. the language of the administration and military rule of the Avar Khaganate in Eastern Europe.cf. with references In 626, the Slavs, Persians and Avars jointly attacked the Byzantine Empire and participated in the Siege of Constantinople. In that campaign, the Slavs fought under Avar officers. There is an ongoing controversy over whether the Slavs might then have been a military caste under the khaganate rather than an ethnicity.Controversy discussed in Their language‚Äîat first possibly only one local speech‚Äîonce koin√©ized, became a lingua franca of the Avar state. This might explain how Proto-Slavic spread to the Balkans and the areas of the Danube basin,Until the year 800 Slavic languages were spoken all the way to the Trieste‚ÄìHamburg line. Later, they were pushed back to the east. and would also explain why the Avars were assimilated so fast, leaving practically no linguistic traces, and that Proto-Slavic was so unusually uniform. However, such a theory fails to explain how Slavic spread to Eastern Europe, an area that had no historical links with the Avar Khanate.: It is possible that the expansion of the Avar khanate during the second half of the eighth century coincided with the spread of... Slavic into the neighbouring areas of Bohemia, Moravia and southern Poland. (but) could hardly explain the spread of Slavic into Poland, Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, all regions that produced so far almost no archaeological evidence of Avar influence That sudden expansion of Proto-Slavic erased most of the idioms of the Balto-Slavic dialect continuum, which left us today with only two groups, Baltic and Slavic (or East Baltic, West Baltic, and Slavic in the minority view). This secession of the Balto-Slavic dialect ancestral to Proto- Slavic is estimated on archaeological and glottochronological criteria to have occurred sometime in the period 1500‚Äì1000 BCE.cf. with references. \\"Classical glottochronology\\" conducted by Czech Slavist M. ƒåejka in 1974 dates the Balto- Slavic split to -910¬±340 BCE, Sergei Starostin in 1994 dates it to 1210 BCE, and \\"recalibrated glottochronology\\" conducted by Novotn√° & Bla≈æek dates it to 1400‚Äì1340 BCE. This agrees well with Trzciniec-Komarov culture, localized from Silesia to Central Ukraine and dated to the period 1500‚Äì1200 BCE. Hydronymic evidence suggests that Baltic languages were once spoken in much wider territory than the one they cover today, all the way to Moscow, and were later replaced by Slavic. Shared features of the Balto-Slavic languages The degree of relationship of the Baltic and Slavic languages is indicated by a series of common innovations not shared with other Indo-European languages, and by the relative chronology of these innovations which can be established. The Baltic and Slavic languages also share some inherited words. These are either not found at all in other Indo-European languages (except when borrowed) or are inherited from Proto-Indo-European but have undergone identical changes in meaning when compared to other Indo-European languages. This indicates that the Baltic and Slavic languages share a period of common development, the Proto-Balto-Slavic language. =Common sound changes= * Winter's law: lengthening of vowels before Proto-Indo-European (PIE) non- breathy voiced consonants (*b, *d, *g). * PIE breathy-voiced consonants (*b ∞, *d ∞, *g ∞, *«µ ∞) merge into plain voiced consonants (*b, *d, *g, *«µ). This also occurred in several other Indo-European branches, but as Winter's law was sensitive to the difference between the two types of consonants, the merger must have happened after it and so is a specific Balto-Slavic innovation. * Hirt's law: retraction of the PIE accent to the preceding syllable, if that syllable ended in a laryngeal (*h‚ÇÅ, *h‚ÇÇ, *h‚ÇÉ, see Laryngeal theory). * A high vowel is inserted before PIE syllabic sonorants (*lÃ•, *rÃ•, *mÃ•, *nÃ•). This vowel is usually *i (giving *il, *ir, *im, *in) but in some occasions also *u (*ul, *ur, *um, *un). Proto-Germanic is the only other Indo-European language that inserts a high vowel (*u in all cases), all others insert mid or low vowels instead. * Emergence of a register distinction on long syllables, between acute (probably glottalized) and circumflex. The acute arose primarily when the syllable ended in a PIE voiced consonant (as in Winter's law) or when it ended in a laryngeal. The distinction is reflected in most Balto-Slavic languages, including Proto-Slavic, as an opposition between rising and falling tone on accented syllables. Some Baltic languages directly reflect the acute register in the form of a so-called \\"broken tone\\". * Shortening of vowels before word-final *m. * Word-final *-mi > *-m after a long vowel. This followed the preceding change, as the preceding long vowel is retained. * Raising of stressed *o to *u in a final syllable. * Merging of PIE short *o and *a into *a or *o. This change also occurred in several other Indo-European branches, but here too it must have happened after Winter's law: Winter's law lengthens *o to *≈ç and *a to *ƒÅ, and must therefore have occurred before the two sounds merged. It also followed the raising of *o to *u above. Both vowels merged differently in both groups: Baltic languages have a in both cases, but Slavic ones have o (compare Lith. a≈°√¨s with old. Sl. –æ—Å—å (from Ide. *a: Latin axis, Greek ·ºÑŒ∂œâŒΩ); Lith. av√¨s, old Slavic –æ–≤—å—Ü–∞ (from Ide. *≈è: Latin ovis, Greec ·ΩÑŒπœÇ). The Indo-European long vowels *ƒÅ and *≈ç merged only in the Slavic group, and later only in old Prussian.Zigmas Zinkeviƒçius. Lietuvi≈≥ kalbos kilmƒó [Origin of the Lithuanian Language]. Vilnius, 1984, page 120 Common Balto-Slavic innovations include several other changes, which are also shared by several other Indo-European branches. These are therefore not direct evidence for the existence of a common Balto-Slavic family, but they do corroborate it. * Satemization: The PIE palatovelar consonants *·∏±, *«µ, *«µ ∞ become palatal sibilants *≈õ, *≈∫, *≈∫, while the PIE labiovelar consonants *k ∑, *g ∑, *g ∑ ∞ lose their labalization and merge with the plain velar *k, *g, *g ∞. The palatal sibilants later become plain sibilants *s, *z in all Balto-Slavic languages except Lithuanian. * Ruki sound law: *s becomes *≈° when preceded by *r, *u, *k or *i. In Slavic, this *≈° later becomes *x (variously spelled , or in the Slavic languages) when followed by a back vowel. =Common grammatical innovations= * Replacement of the original PIE genitive singular ending of thematic (o-stem) nouns, which is reconstructed as *-osyo, with the ablative ending *-ƒÅd (Proto-Slavic *v—ålka, Lithuanian vilÃÉko, Latvian v√¨lka). Old Prussian, however, has another ending, perhaps stemming from the original PIE genitive: deiwas \\"god's\\", tawas \\"father's\\". * Use of the ending *-ƒÅn (from earlier *-ƒÅmi) of the instrumental singular in ƒÅ-stem nouns and adjectives. This contrasts with Sanskrit -ayƒÅ, archaic Vedic -ƒÅ. Lithuanian rank√† is ambiguous and could have originated from either ending, but the correspondence with East Lithuanian runku and Latvian r√πoku point to Balto-Slavic *-ƒÅn. * Use of the ending *-mis in the instrumental plural, e.g. Lithuanian s≈´num√¨s, Old Church Slavonic syn—ämi \\"with sons\\". This ending is also found in Germanic, while the other Indo-European languages have an ending with -b ∞-, as in Sanskrit -bhis. * Creation of a distinction between definite (meaning similar to \\"the\\") and indefinite adjectives (meaning similar to \\"a\\"). The definite forms were formed by attaching the corresponding form of the relative/demonstrative pronoun *jas to the end of the adjective. For example, Lithuanian ger√†sis 'the good' as opposed to g·∫Ωras 'good', Old Church Slavonic dobr—äj—å 'the good' as opposed to dobr—ä 'good'. These forms in Lithuanian, however, seem to have developed after the split, since in older Lithuanian literature (16th century and onwards) they had not yet merged (e. g. naujamƒôÃÅjame  Ωin the new one‚Äô from *naujam√©n + *jam√©n). In Lithuanian, the pronoun merged with the adjective having a modern (secondary) pronominal inflection; in Slavic, the pronoun merged with an adjective, having an ancient (primary) nominal inflection. * Usage of the genitive case for the direct object of a negative verb. For example, Russian –∫–Ω–∏ÃÅ–≥–∏ (—è) –Ω–µ —á–∏—Ç–∞–ª, Lith. knygos neskaiƒçiau 'I haven't read the book'. \\"Navedimo najva≈ænije baltoslavenske izoglose...Upotreba genitiva za izricanje objekta zanijekanog glagola\\" =Shared vocabulary= Some examples of words shared among most or all Balto-Slavic languages: * *l√©iÀÄpƒÅÀÄ 'tilia' (linden tree): Lithuanian l√≠epa, Old Prussian lƒ´pa, Latvian li·∫Ωpa, Latgalian lƒ´pa, Common Slavic *lipa (Old Church Slavonic –ª–∏–ø–∞, Russian –ª–∏ÃÅ–ø–∞, Polish lipa, Czech l√≠pa) * *r√°nkƒÅÀÄ 'hand': Lithuanian rank√†, Old Prussian rƒÅnkan (acc. sg.), Latvian ruÃÄoka, Latgalian r≈´ka, Common Slavic *r«≠k√† (Old Church Slavonic —Ä—´–∫–∞, Russian —Ä—É–∫–∞ÃÅ, Polish rƒôka, Czech ruka) * *galÀÄwƒÅÃÅÀÄ 'head': Lithuanian galv√†, Old Prussian galwo, Latvian galÃÇva, Latgalian golva; Common Slavic *golv√† (Old Church Slavonic –≥–ª–∞–≤–∞, Russian –≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–∞ÃÅ, Polish g≈Çowa, Czech hlava) Despite lexical developments exclusive to Balto-Slavic and otherwise showing evidence for a stage of common development, there are considerable differences between the vocabularies of Baltic and Slavic. Rozwadowski noted that every semantic field contains core vocabulary that is etymologically different between the two branches. Andersen prefers a dialect continuum model where the northernmost dialects developed into Baltic, in turn, the southernmost dialects developed into Slavic (with Slavic later absorbing any intermediate idioms during its expansion). Andersen thinks that different neighboring and substratum languages might have contributed to the differences in basic vocabulary.

Biography =Early years in Hokkaido= Akira Ifukube was born on 31 May 1914 in Kushiro, Japan as the third son of a police officer Toshimitsu Ifukube. The origins of this family can be traced back to at least the 7th century with the birth of Ifukibe-no-Tokotarihime. He was strongly influenced by the Ainu music as he spent his childhood (from age of 9 to 12) in Otofuke near Obihiro, where was with a mixed population of Ainu and Japanese. His first encounter with classical music occurred when attending secondary school in Sapporo city. Ifukube decided to become a composer at the age of 14 after hearing a radio performance of Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, also cited the music of Manuel de Falla as a major influence. Ifukube studied forestry at Hokkaido Imperial University in Sapporo and composed in his spare time, which prefigured a line of self-taught Japanese composers. His first piece was the piano solo, Piano Suite (later the title was changed to Japan Suite, arranged for orchestra), dedicated to George Copeland who was living in Spain. Ifukube's friend Atsushi Miura at university sent a letter to Copeland. Copeland replied, \\"It is wonderful that you listen my disc in spite of you living in Japan, the opposite side of the earth. I imagine you may compose music. Send me some piano pieces.\\" Then Miura, who was not a composer, presented Ifukube and this piece to Copeland. Copeland promised to interpret it, but the correspondence was unfortunately stopped because of the Spanish Civil War. Ifukube's big break came in 1935, when his first orchestral piece Japanese Rhapsody won the first prize in an international competition for young composers promoted by Alexander Tcherepnin. The judges of that contest‚ÄîAlbert Roussel, Jacques Ibert, Arthur Honegger, Alexandre Tansman, Tibor Hars√°nyi, Pierre-Octave Ferroud, and Henri Gil-Marchex were unanimous in their selection of Ifukube as the winner.liner notes: Naxos 8.555071 (Morihide Katayarna) Ifukube studied modern Western composition while Tcherepnin was visiting Japan, his Piano Suite received an honourable mention at the I.C.S.M. festival in Venice in 1938. Japanese Rhapsody was performed in Europe on a number of occasions in the late 1930s. On completing University, he worked as a forestry officer and lumber processor in Akkeshi, and towards the end of the Second World War was appointed by the Imperial Japanese Army to study the elasticity and vibratory strength of wood. He suffered radiation exposure after carrying out x-rays without protection, a consequence of the wartime lead shortage. Thus, he had to abandon forestry work and became a professional composer and teacher. Ifukube spent some time in hospital due to the radiation exposure, and was startled one day to hear one of his own marches being played over the radio when General Douglas MacArthur arrived to formalize the Japanese surrender. =From 1946 to 2006 in Tokyo= He taught at the Tokyo University of the Arts (formerly Tokyo Music School), during which period he composed his first film score for The End of the Silver Mountains, released in 1947. Over the next fifty years, he would compose more than 250 film scores, the high point of which was his 1954 music for Ishir≈ç Honda's Toho movie, Godzilla. Ifukube also created Godzilla's trademark roar ‚Äì produced by rubbing a resin-covered leather glove along the loosened strings of a double bass ‚Äì and its footsteps, created by striking an amplifier box. Despite his financial success as a film composer, Ifukube's first love had always been his general classical work as a composer. In fact his compositions for the two genres cross-fertilized each other. For example, he was to recycle his 1953 music for the ballet Shaka, about how the young Siddhartha Gautama eventually became the Buddha, for Kenji Misumi's 1961 film Buddha. Then in 1988 he reworked the film music to create his three-movement symphonic ode Gotama the Buddha. Meanwhile, he had returned to teaching at the Tokyo College of Music, becoming president of the college the following year, and in 1987 retired to become head of the College's ethnomusicology department. He trained younger generation composers such as Toshiro Mayuzumi, Yasushi Akutagawa, Akio Yashiro, Teizo Matsumura, Sei Ikeno, Minoru Miki, Maki Ishii, Kaoru Wada, Yssimal Motoji and Imai Satoshi. He also published Orchestration, a 1,000-page book on theory, widely used among Japanese composers. He died in Tokyo at Meguro-ku Hospital of multiple organ dysfunction on 8 February in 2006, at the age of 91 and buried at the Ube shrine in Tottori. =Honors= The Japanese government awarded Ifukube the Order of Culture.

The conflict formed part of the Norwegian expedition against Scotland in 1263, in which Haakon Haakonsson, King of Norway attempted to reassert Norwegian sovereignty over the western seaboard of Scotland. Since the beginning of the 12th century this region had lain within the Norwegian realm, ruled by magnates who recognised the overlordship of the kings of Norway. In the mid-13th century, two Scottish kings, Alexander II and his son Alexander III, attempted to incorporate the region into their own realm. Following failed attempts to purchase the islands from the Norwegian king, the Scots launched military operations. Haakon responded to the Scottish aggression by leading a massive fleet from Norway, which reached the Hebrides in the summer of 1263. By the end of September, Haakon's fleet occupied the Firth of Clyde, and when negotiations between the kingdoms broke down, he brought the bulk of his fleet to anchor off the Cumbraes. On the night of 1 October, during a bout of stormy weather, several Norwegian vessels were driven aground on the Ayrshire coast, near present-day Largs. On 2 October, while the Norwegians were salvaging their vessels, the main Scottish army arrived on the scene. Composed of infantry and cavalry, the Scottish force was commanded by Alexander of Dundonald, Steward of Scotland. The Norwegians were gathered in two groups: the larger main force on the beach and a small contingent atop a nearby mound. The advance of the Scots threatened to divide the Norwegian forces, so the contingent on the mound ran to rejoin their comrades on the beach below. Seeing them running from the mound, the Norwegians on the beach believed they were retreating, and fled back towards the ships. There was fierce fighting on the beach, and the Scots took up a position on the mound formerly held by the Norwegians. Late in the day, after several hours of skirmishing, the Norwegians recaptured the mound. The Scots withdrew from the scene and the Norwegians reboarded their ships. They returned the next morning to collect their dead. With the weather deteriorating, Haakon's fleet sailed to Orkney to overwinter. The battle of Largs has been romanticised by later historians as a great Scottish victory, but it only involved a small part of the Norwegian fleet. With his fleet and forces intact, Haakon planned to continue to campaign after spending the winter in Orkney, but he was unexpectedly taken ill and died there. With Haakon's death, his successor, Magnus Haakonarson, King of Norway, signed the Treaty of Perth three years after the battle, leasing Scotland's western seaboard to Alexander III in return for a yearly payment. This lease became permanent, but the Kingdom of Scotland eventually stopped paying the Norwegian crown for the islands when Norway became distracted by civil wars. Although the Battle of Largs was apparently not considered a significant event by contemporaries, later historians transformed it into an event of international importance. Today, most scholars no longer subscribe to such a view, and instead accord it just an important place in the failed Norwegian campaign. The battle is commemorated in Largs by an early 20th-century monument, and festivities held there annually since the 1980s. Sources The main source for the battle is Hakonar saga Hakonarsonar,Alexander; Neighbour; Oram 2000: pp. 17-22. a contemporary account of the life of Hakon Haakonarson, King of Norway (d. 1263), composed by the Icelandic historian Sturla Thordarson (d. 1284).Cowan 1990: pp. 103-104, 106. Although the saga describes the events purely from the Norwegian perspective, its narrative of the battle appears to have been drawn from eye- witness accounts, and it is the most detailed source available for the Scottish‚ÄìNorwegian conflict. A contemporary Scottish perspective of the events is preserved in a brief entry within the Chronicle of Melrose. First penned at Melrose Abbey in the last quarter of the 12th century, the chronicle was further extended and supplemented from time to time into the late 13th century. It is an important historical source for the mediaeval Scottish realm.Doherty 2011: p. 101. Background Viking depredations have been recorded in the British Isles since the late 8th century,McDonald 1997: p. 25. and Scandinavian settlement on Scotland's western-seaboard may have begun before the turn of the 9th century.McDonald 1997: p. 27. Claims to this region by Norwegian kings date to the turn of the 12th century, when Magnus Olafsson, King of Norway (d. 1103) established himself in the Hebrides and the Isle of Man (Mann). Direct Norwegian control ended with Magnus' death, after which the Hebrides and Mann,Woolf 2004: p. 101. See also: Crawford 2001: pp. 556-558. known to the Norwegians as the \\"Southern Isles\\",Williams 2007: pp. 130-132 fn 8. were controlled by local dynasties for over a century and a half. In the first half of the 13th century, the seaboard was controlled by two main power- blocks: one consisting of the Mann, Lewis and Harris, and Skye‚Äîcontrolled by the patrilineal descendants of Godred Crovan (d. 1095); the other consisting of mainland territories in Argyll, and the islands of Islay, Jura, Mull, and possibly Uist‚Äîcontrolled by the descendants of Somerled (d. 1164). As part of the far-flung, early 13th century Norwegian realm, these island rulers recognised the overlordship of Haakon Haakonarson, King of Norway (d. 1263).Beuermann 2007: pp. 99-123. The Norwegian realm in 1263, at about the time of the Battle of Largs The first half of the 13th century was a period of consolidation for both Scottish and Norwegian kings.Cowan 1990: p. 124. The Norwegians, under Haakon, overcame a period of internal strife, from 1161 to 1208,Barrow 1981: p. 101. and oversaw the submission of the Faroe Islands, the Greenland settlements, and Iceland, in the mid 13th century.Power 2005: p. 50. The Scots, under Alexander II, King of Scots (d. 1249), extended royal authority into the northern Highlands, Argyll, and Galloway.Stringer 2004. The king also had wanted to incorporate the western seaboard into the Scottish realm.Forte; Oram; Pedersen 2005: pp. 253-254\\\\. See also: Stringer 2004. See also: Alexander; Neighbour; Oram 2000: pp. 17-22. In 1230, Scottish aggression against the Isles and interference forced the Norwegian king to pacify the region. In 1249, after attempting to purchase the Isles from Haakon, Alexander II launched a campaign of his own, deep into Argyll and into the Hebrides. Unfortunately for the Scots, their king died suddenly on the verge of conquest.Stringer 2004. Since his son and successor, Alexander III (d. 1286), was only a boy at the time, the Scottish realm suffered through a lengthy and troubled minority.Reid 2004. See also: Stringer 2004. In consequence, it wasn't until the 1260s that the king looked west, and attempted to finish what his father had so nearly accomplished. In 1262, a year after another unsuccessful attempt to purchase the Isles, Scottish forces launched an attack upon Skye. Haakon's response to the invasion was to mastermind a massive military expedition of his own.Reid 2004. See also: Alexander; Neighbour; Oram 2000: pp. 17-22. Described by the Icelandic Annals as the largest force to have ever set sail from Norway,McDonald 1997: p. 107. See also: Anderson 1922: p. 607. the fleet reached the Isles in the summer of 1263. After receiving only a lukewarm reception from his vassals in the region, Haakon's forces reached the Firth of Clyde, after his men had secured several castles, and undertook raids into the surrounding mainland. With the Norwegian fleet anchored off Arran, the Norwegians and Scottish embassies fiercely debated the sovereignty of the Islands of the Clyde. When talks broke down, Haakon dispatched a fleet of Islesmen to raid into Loch Lomond, and to ravage Lennox. Meanwhile, the main Norwegian fleet repositioned itself between the Cumbraes and the Ayrshire coast.Forte; Oram; Pedersen 2005: pp. 257-258\\\\. See also: Alexander; Neighbour; Oram 2000: pp. 17-22. Events Haakon's ships depicted on William Hole's mural in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery While lying off the Cumbraes, on the night of 30 September, Haakon's fleet was battered by stormy weather. During the night, the saga records that a merchantman dragged its anchor and was driven aground. The following morning, it and four other vessels were floated off by the rising tide but carried by the current towards the Scottish mainland where they ran aground again. The crews of the beached vessels were soon harassed by a small force of Scots armed with bows. After the Norwegians had suffered some casualties, Haakon sent reinforcements ashore, and the Scots fled the area. Haakon's reinforcements remained ashore for the night, and the Norwegian king himself came ashore to oversee the salvage operation the next morning.Forte; Oram; Pedersen 2005: pp. 258-259\\\\. See also: Alexander; Neighbour; Oram 2000: pp. 17-22\\\\. See also: Anderson 1922: pp. 626-628. According to the saga, the main Scottish force, consisting of heavily armoured cavalry and infantry, arrived on 2 October. The saga numbers the mounted troops at about 500, and states that they rode high- quality horses protected by mail.Barrow 1990: p. 139. See also: Anderson 1922: pp. 628-630. The use of a substantial force of mounted knights or sergeants appears to be corroborated in contemporary records of payments made to troops.Barrow 1990: pp. 139, 141-142. For example, Walter Stewart, Earl of Menteith had to maintain 120 sergeants‚Äîwhich could include knights, mounted men-at-arms, archers, or other footsoldiers‚Äîat Ayr Castle for three weeks.Brown 2004: p. 57. See also: Barrow 1990: pp. 139, 141-142. Although surviving records fail to mention the number of knights assembled at Ayr, the record of wages suggests that it was \\"more than a mere handful\\". According to the saga, the Scottish infantry were armed with bows and \\"Irish axes\\", and since at one point the Scots are said to have thrown stones at the Norwegians,Barrow 1990: p. 139. See also: See also: Anderson 1922: p. 630. the Scottish army must have also included slingers. The Latin Chronicle of Melrose simply describes the Scottish infantry as pedisequi patrie (the \\"foot-sloggers of the locality\\").Duncan 1996: pp. 379, 579-580\\\\. See also: Barrow 1990: p. 139. See also: Stevenson 1835: p. 190. If this description refers to the men of the surrounding countryside, the Scottish infantry would have been made up of men from the 'common army', drawn only from Strathgryffe, Cunninghame and Kyle. These levies would have been mustered by the Sheriff of Ayr, the Sheriff of Lanark, and the local magnates.Barrow 1990: p. 138. At the time of Largs, the Scottish king thus had at his disposal men from the 'common army' (lesser men who owed service to their king), the feudal host (greater men who owed military service for their lands), and also paid troops.Brown 2004: p. 57. Area of conflict There is evidence to suggest that the main Scottish force arrived from the south, rather than from the west or the north. For example, Alexander III is recorded to have been south at Ayr in September,Forte; Oram; Pedersen 2005: pp. 259-260\\\\. See also: Alexander; Neighbour; Oram 2000: pp. 17-22. and the power centre of Alexander of Dundonald, Steward of Scotland (d. 1282), who is thought to have commanded the Scottish forces at the battle,Forte; Oram; Pedersen 2005: pp. 259-260\\\\. See also: Barrow 2004. See also: Alexander; Neighbour; Oram 2000: pp. 17-22\\\\. See also: Young 1990: p. 15. was also located to the south. Furthermore, at the time of the battle, the Sheriff of Ayr was probably a member of the steward's family‚Äîprobably his younger brother, the Earl of Menteith.Brown 2004: pp. 56-57\\\\. See also: Barrow 1990: p. 138. See also: Cowan 1990: p. 121. If the Scots had indeed arrived from the south, then they would have also assembled at a muster site to the south, possibly somewhere near Ayr. The saga indicates that the Norwegians were divided into two groups. The smaller force, numbered at 200 men, was stationed on a mound, somewhat inland from the beach, under the command of Norwegian nobleman Ogmund Crouchdance. The main Norwegian force, numbered at about 700 to 800 men (including Haakon himself), was stationed on the beach below.Forte; Oram; Pedersen 2005: p. 259. See also: Alexander; Neighbour; Oram 2000: pp. 17-22. These two detachments were likely only a fraction of the total number of forces at Haakon's disposal. The numbers that the saga allots to either side may be exaggerated. A more likely number may be only about one hundred or several hundred men per side with the number of knights present may have been closer to 50 than the saga's 500.Duncan 1996: pp. 579-580, 580 fn 20. The forces which Haakon had mustered in Norway formed part of his realm's leidang,Derry 2000: p. 49. a naval levy in which districts contributed men, ships, and provisions for military service.Derry 2000: p. 25. seal illustrates the armament of a contemporary mounted knight. As the Scots advanced towards the Norwegians, the saga indicates that Ogmund withdrew his troops from the mound to avoid being cut off from his comrades on the beach below.Forte; Oram; Pedersen 2005: p. 260. See also: Alexander; Neighbour; Oram 2000: pp. 17-22\\\\. See also: Anderson 1922: pp. 630-632. If the Scots had indeed marched northwards, their advance would have threatened to drive a wedge between the Norwegians on the mound and those on beach.Forte; Oram; Pedersen 2005: p. 260. See also: Alexander; Neighbour; Oram 2000: pp. 17-22. Once the Scottish vanguard came into contact with Ogmund's men, the saga indicates that his orderly withdrawal disintegrated into a chaotic scramble. On the beach below, Haakon followed the advice of his men and retired to the safety of his ships. To the men on the beach, the rapid descent of Ogmund's men towards them looked like an all-out retreat; they turned and fled. The Norwegian army was thus routed, and in the mad dash back to their ships they suffered substantial casualties. Some of the Norwegians may have used the beached vessels as makeshift fortifications, since the saga notes that a group of them made a valiant stand by their ships, out-numbered ten to one, in a fierce engagement in which a particularly valiant Scottish knight was slain.Forte; Oram; Pedersen 2005: p. 260. See also: Alexander; Neighbour; Oram 2000: pp. 17-22\\\\. See also: Barrow 1990: p. 139. See also: Anderson 1922: pp. 630-632. This entry confirms that at least some of the Scottish knights present were able to engage their foes on horseback. According to the saga, the Scots then withdrew from the beach and consolidated atop the mound abandoned by Ogmund's men. Minor skirmishing followed in which both sides attacked each other with arrows and stones. Before nightfall, the saga maintains that the Norwegians made one last determined assault, and forced the Scots from the mound, before making an orderly withdrawal to their ships. On the morning of 3 October, the Norwegians returned ashore to collect their dead and burn their beached vessels.Forte; Oram; Pedersen 2005: p. 260. See also: Alexander; Neighbour; Oram 2000: pp. 17-22\\\\. See also: Anderson 1922: pp. 633-634. For several days, Haakon's forces laid off the coast of Arran. After rendezvousing with the returning fleet that had plundered Lennox, Haakon's entire forces made for the Hebrides. At Mull he rewarded a number of his Norse-Gaelic vassals with grants of lands. By the end of October, the Norwegian fleet reached Orkney.McDonald 1997: p. 114. See also: Anderson 1922: pp. 634-639. In mid December, the Norwegian king fell ill and died at the Bishop's Palace, and was temporarily buried in nearby St Magnus Cathedral.Forte; Oram; Pedersen 2005: pp. 261, 262 caption. See also: McDonald 1997: p. 114. See also: Anderson 1922: pp. 639-642. Aftermath Neolithic chambered cairn near Largs is sometimes known as \\"Haco's Tomb\\". Local tombs, such as this, were once believed to have been erected as grave markers for warriors slain during the battle.Alexander; Neighbour; Oram 2000: pp. 19 caption, 21. The saga described the Norwegian campaign as a triumph. In reality, it had not achieved anything,Forte; Oram; Pedersen 2005: pp. 260-261\\\\. See also: McDonald 1997: p. 115. See also: Cowan 1990: pp. 104, 122. See also: Barrow 1981: pp. 118-119\\\\. See also: Anderson 1922: p. 635. though the expedition was not lost at Largs. Haakon simply sailed to Orkney to overwinter with his forces. He unexpectedly fell ill and died there before he had the chance to resume operations. The campaign had started too late, and the Scottish king had successfully prolonged negotiations to his own advantage. As the summer turned to autumn, and the royal envoys parleyed back and forth, Alexander III had further strengthened his forces in the defence of his realm, and left Haakon's fleet to the mercy of the deteriorating weather.McDonald 1997: p. 115. In the end, the Scottish realm had successfully defended itself from Norwegian might, and many of Haakon's Norse-Gaelic vassals had been reluctant to support the Norwegian cause.McDonald 1997: p. 115. See also: Barrow 1981: pp. 118-119. Within months of the abortive campaign, embassies were sent from Norway to discuss terms of peace. Meanwhile, Alexander III seized the initiative and made ready to punish the magnates who had supported Haakon. By the end of the year the Hebrideans and Manx were forced to submit to the Scots.McDonald 1997: pp. 115-116\\\\. See also: Duncan 1996: pp. 580-581. In 1266, almost three years after the battle, terms of peace were finally agreed upon between the Scottish and Norwegian kings. On 2 July 1266, with the conclusion of the Treaty of Perth, the Hebrides and Mann were leased to the King of Scots, in return for an annual payment. As it happened, Norwegian rule over the Hebrides would never return, with the Kingdom of Scotland eventually discontinuing their payments to the Norwegian crown.McDonald 1997: pp. 120-121. The treaty also entailed Scottish acceptance of Norwegian rule over Orkney and Shetland. Historiography The battle does not appear to have been regarded as a significant event, as the contemporary sources are relatively silent about it.Forte; Oram; Pedersen 2005: pp. 263-264\\\\. See also: Alexander; Neighbour; Oram 2000: pp. 17-22. The Chronicle of Melrose offers only a brief description, and does not record its location. It ascribes the campaign's failure more to the power of God than to that of the Scots.Forte; Oram; Pedersen 2005: pp. 263-264\\\\. See also: Alexander; Neighbour; Oram 2000: pp. 17-22\\\\.

But by the 14th and 15th centuries, the battle was being portrayed as part of an epic struggle between an invading force of Norwegians and an idealised Scottish king defending his realm. By the 17th century, the battle had lost its attributed significance, but in the 19th century it was rediscovered by antiquarians and historians who transformed it into a conflict of international importance. Although the battle's upsurge in popularity at this time may be due to the tapping of Largs' tourism potential, it was also influenced by the general heightening of interest in Scotland's history and culture. The battle became associated with Scotland's proud military past and linked to the great mediaeval victories of national heroes such as Wallace and Bruce.Alexander; Neighbour; Oram 2000: pp. 17-18. Most modern academics do not subscribe to such a view, though they regard the battle as a significant part of the failed Norwegian campaign. But even today, to the locals of Largs, the battle represents a glorious Scottish victory over invading Vikings.Magnusson 2003: p. 100. See also: .

The Pencil has been protected as a listed building since 1971, and stands about south of Largs, at , overlooking the local marina. Although the monument marks the traditional site of the battle, it stands nowhere near the probable battle site. Its erroneous placement appears to be due to the discovery of prehistoric burials, consisting of both chambered tombs and cist burials. Nearby Bronze Age standing stones may have been interpreted as memorials to slain warriors, as was a nearby Neolithic tomb. The location of this tomb has led to the erroneous association between the battle and the two parks situated at and . The Ordnance Survey also locates the battle too far south, at .

The second British squadron to receive the Eurofighter Typhoon, it is currently the Operational Conversion Unit (OCU) for the Typhoon. History =First World War= This unit was first raised as a reserve squadron, initially equipped with the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c, in November 1915. In early 1916 however No. 29 became the fourth squadron to receive the Airco DH.2 \\"pusher\\" fighter, and arrived in France on 25 March 1916Jones 1928, p. 147. ‚Äì helping to end the Fokker Scourge and establish Allied air superiority in time for the Battle of the Somme.Jones 1928, pp. 158‚Äì160. By late 1916 the DH.2 was outclassed by new German fighters, but No. 29 kept its pushers until March 1917, when it was re-equipped with Nieuport 17s. These were replaced with later Nieuport types, such as the Nieuport 24bis, as these became available. Due to a shortage of the Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a the squadron retained its Nieuports until April 1918. At this time the squadron finally received the S.E.5a, which it retained for the rest of the war. The award of a Victoria Cross ‚Äì the highest award for valour \\"in the face of the enemy\\" in the British Empire ‚Äì to Captain James McCudden of 29 Squadron was gazetted on 2 April 1918, for McCudden's \\"conspicuous bravery, exceptional perseverance and a high devotion to duty\\", between August 1917 and March 1918. October 1918 was a bitter month for the squadron; four of its members died within a fortnight. Claude Melnot Wilson was the first to fall, on 14 October. Lieutenant Henry Coyle Rath collided with another pilot from the same squadron on the 26th. Even as Rath was succumbing to his injuries, Guy Wareing was shot down on the 27th. After a short period with the army of occupation in Germany, the Squadron returned to the UK in August 1919 and was disbanded on 31 December 1919. The squadron ended the war having claimed 385 victories. Apart from those already mentioned, the 26 aces who served with the squadron included: *Edgar O. Amm *Norman Brearley *Sydney Brown *Edgar G. Davies *Francis James Davies *Thomas Sinclair Harrison *D'Arcy Fowlis Hilton *Ernest Charles Hoy *Arthur G. Jones-Williams *Camille Lagesse *William Molesworth *James Dennis Payne *Arthur Reed *Charles G. Ross *Reginald H. Rusby *Alfred Shepherd *Christoffel Venter *Walter Bertram Wood =Inter-war years= A line-up of 29 Squadron Siskins, in the late 1920s. The squadron was reformed on 1 April 1923, initially equipped with Sopwith Snipes. These were replaced by Gloster Grebes in January 1925, In turn, these were replaced by the Armstrong Whitworth Siskin IIIA in March 1928 and Bristol Bulldogs in June 1932. In March 1935, nearly twenty years after it was first raised as a single-seat fighter squadron, the squadron received two-seater Hawker Demons, which it operated until 1938. This included service in Egypt from October 1935 to 1936, during the Abyssinian crisis. As part of the Royal Air Force‚Äôs modernisation and expansion in the late 1930s, No. 29 received Bristol Blenheim IF heavy fighters in December 1938. =Second World War= A Beaufighter Mk IF (B-RO) of No. 29 Squadron. No 29 began the Second World War with its Blenheims, which at the period operated as day fighters ‚Äì especially on convoy protection patrols. From June 1940 it became a night fighter squadron, receiving some of the first Beaufighters in November, though it was February 1941 before the squadron was fully equipped with the new fighter. Various marks of the de Havilland Mosquito were flown by the squadron from May 1943 culminating in the Mosquito NF30. =Post-war= During the immediate post-war years the squadron remained a night/all weather fighter unit. The Mosquitoes continued to serve until replaced by Gloster Meteor NF11s in August 1951. In November 1957 the squadron moved to RAF Acklington in Northumberland where it was re-equipped with Gloster Javelins. In July 1958 to RAF Leuchars in Scotland. In February 1963 No 29 moved to Cyprus and in December 1965 went to Zambia for nine months on detachment during the Rhodesian crisis.

In May 1982, a detachment of 3 Phantom FGR2‚Äôs were deployed at Wideawake airstrip on Ascension Island during the Falklands War. On completion of repairs to the runway at Stanley in August 1982, the squadron deployed 9 aircraft south to the islands, the first arriving on 17 October 1982 flown by the then officer commanding Wing Commander Ian Macfadyen. In 1987, 29 Squadron was one of the first RAF units to receive the Tornado F3, deploying to Saudi Arabia after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 and participating in Operation Desert Storm. No. 29 flew the Tornado until disbanding in 1998, as part of the Strategic Defence Review. The squadron was reformed in 2003, this time as the Typhoon operational conversion unit (OCU). Badge The badge of the squadron shows an eagle in flight preying on a buzzard, symbolising air combat. The motto in Latin is Impiger et acer - 'Energetic and keen'. Squadron markings and the \\"misspelled Roman numeral\\" tradition Since the late 1920s, the squadron marking has been three (red) Xs (XXX). Since this closely resembles the Roman numeral for \\"29\\" (XXIX) there is a belief among current squadron personnel that this originated as a \\"misspelling\\" of the Roman numeral. Although various versions of the tradition are put forward, the most common explanation is that a mis-understood instruction to ground crew to paint \\"2 X's in front of the roundel and IX behind it\\" meaning \\"X,X,(roundel), and 'IX' or 'one-X'\\" resulted in \\"XX(roundel)'one times' X\\". In fact, the marking was always applied as \\"XXX(roundel)XXX\\" or as \\"XXX(roundel)\\" on smaller types, such as Siskins. It seems probable that the original adoption of \\"XXX\\" for the 1930s squadron marking was nothing to do with Roman numerals, but was a reference to the brewers' mark for \\"extra strong\\", frequently applied to kegs of beer, and that it is only a coincidence that this resembles the numeral for \\"29\\" (XXIX).Robertson 1957, p. 68.

Internationally, for the purposes of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, \\"regional or minority languages\\" means languages that are: #traditionally used within a given territory of a State by nationals of that State who form a group numerically smaller than the rest of the State's population and #different from the official language(s) of that State Recognition of regional or minority languages must not be confused with recognition as an official language. Influence of number of speakers There are many cases when a regional language can claim greater numbers of speakers than certain languages which happen to be official languages of sovereign states. For example, Catalan (a regional language of Spain, Italy and France, albeit the national language of Andorra) has more speakers than Finnish or Danish. A similar situation exists in China, where Wu, spoken in southern Jiangsu, northern, and the general area of Shanghai Zhejiang by more than 90 million speakers, is spoken natively by more speakers than French; Yue Chinese, a Chinese regional variety spoken in Guangdong, Hong Kong and nearby areas in China with more than 60 million local and overseas speakers (North America, parts of Malaysia), outnumbers Italian in number of speakers. Dialects of the Min dialect group have over 70 million speakers, mainly in Fujian and in nearby Taiwan, but also in the Southeast Asian countries of Malaysia and Singapore. Relationship with official languages In some cases, a regional language may be closely related to the state's main language or official language. For example: *The Frisian languages spoken in the Netherlands and Germany, which belong to the Germanic family. *The Gutnish language, a regional language spoken in Gotland and related to the Swedish language. *Westrobothnian is another Swedish regional language native to historical Westrobothnia. *Kurdish in Kurdistan, which is an autonomous region in Northern Iraq, Northwestern Iran and southeastern Turkey. *Assyrian Neo- Aramaic in northern Iraq, northeastern Syria, southeastern Turkey and northwestern Iran. *The several hundred Sinitic languages are nearly always replaced by Standard Chinese (based on the Beijing dialect) in writing. **Wu, in Shanghai, southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang and eastern Jiangxi. **Yue Chinese, in Guangdong, parts of Guangxi, Hainan, Hong Kong and Macau, Cantonese is the regional standard variety for Yue-speaking areas **Hakka, in parts of Guangdong, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Taiwan **Min, in Fujian, Taiwan, eastern Guangdong and Hainan. **Xiang, in Hunan. **Gan, in Jiangxi. *Kashubian, a regional language of Poland. *Limburgish, a regional language in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, has around one million speakers and is closely related to Luxembourgish, South Guelderish and Ripuarian. *Low German (also referred to as Low Saxon), an officially recognized regional language in Germany and the Netherlands, the direct descendant of Old Saxon.

The Royal Air Force and Royal Australian Air Force, among others, practise this method of training. The United States Navy calls its units in this role \\"fleet replacement squadrons\\". An example of an OCU is No. 29 Squadron RAF, which was the second RAF squadron to receive the Eurofighter Typhoon. The Royal Australian Air Force has a number of OCUs. These include No. 2 Operational Conversion Unit, No. 6 Squadron and No. 292 Squadron. These units are responsible for converting aircrews to the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet, F/A-18F Super Hornet and Lockheed AP-3C Orion aircraft, respectively.

He is the brother of the trombonist Johannes Bauer. As a student at senior high school in Sonneberg between 1957 and 1961, he was enthusiastic about modern music and dance genres such as swing, boogie-woogie, blues and rock 'n' roll, and taught himself to play guitar and piano. After leaving school with A-levels, he tried to play his music in several bands and was nicknamed \\"Conny\\" by his friends. After recognizing that he did not know enough about music to become a professional musician, Bauer studied modern dance music from 1964 to 1968 at the Carl Maria von Weber-Music school Conservatory in Dresden. Because too many students wanted to study guitar, he entered the trombone class, having had some experience of playing the instrument. In 1968 he left the conservatory for Berlin to improve his skills with private lessons. From 1969 until 1971 he started his career as guitarist and singer in the band of Ernst-Ludwig Petrowsky. He also began a career as a trombone soloist in 1970. During the second half of the 1970s Bauer became a prominent jazz player in European free jazz. He helped found numerous groups which influenced the development of jazz in East Germany: these included FEZ and its successive quartet and trio formations, the Doppelmoppel quartet, and Synopsis/Zentralquartett with Ernst-Ludwig Petrowsky, Ulrich Gumpert and G√ºnter \\"Baby\\" Sommer. In 1986 he toured Japan for several weeks, encountering numerous Japanese musicians. From 1988 to 1989 he directed the National Jazz Orchestra of the former East Germany. Since 1983 he has worked with artists such as Tadashi Endo, Sheryl Banks, Tony Oxley, Derek Bailey, Maggie Nicols, Theo J√∂rgensmann, Peter Br√∂tzmann, Barre Phillips, Peter Kowald, Han Bennink, Barry Altschul, Jay Oliver, Louis Moholo, Gerry Hemingway, George Lewis. In 2004 Bauer was awarded the German SWR jazz prize especially for his solo recordings Hummelsummen. As unaccompanied soloist Bauer uses multiphonics, with matchless \\"circular breathing techniques\\" he conjures his own loops.

Jenkins. Beginning service during World War II, the destroyer saw action in the Pacific theatre. Jenkins was placed in reserve following the end of the war, remaining in this state until 1951, when the ship was reactivated for the Korean War. She served in the western Pacific until 1969 when the destroyer was taken out of service and sold for scrap in 1971. Construction and career Jenkins was laid down by Federal Shipbuilding & Drydock Co., Kearny, New Jersey on 27 November 1941 and launched on 21 June 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Marion Parker Embry. The destroyer was commissioned on 31 July 1942, Lieutenant Commander H. F. Miller in command. After a training period during the summer of 1942, Jenkins departed Casco Bay, Maine on 24 October as escort to a convoy headed for the North African campaign. She screened heavy ships during the shore bombardment, as the attack force arrived off Casablanca on 8 November. Following the Naval Battle of Casablanca, the destroyer returned to New York on 19 November to prepare for action in the Pacific. Arriving at Noum√©a, New Caledonia on 4 January 1943, she immediately began escort and patrol duty among the Solomon Islands and in the Coral Sea. Her first Pacific landing operation began on 29 June, when she joined other units in supporting the invasion of New Georgia Island. Jenkins splashed several enemy planes, as the Japanese fought back with considerable air strength. Assigned to Rear Adm. Walden L. Ainsworth's Task Group 36.1, Jenkins departed Tulagi on 5 July and steamed up the Slot to intercept a Japanese destroyer and transport force carrying reinforcements to Kolombangara. Radar detected the enemy during mid-watch; and during the Battle of Kula Gulf 6 July, American gunfire sank one destroyer and drove another ashore. Japanese torpedoes sank the cruiser . Following this operation, Jenkins was dispatched on 18 July to a position south of the Santa Cruz Islands to assist damaged seaplane tender . Although under attack from enemy bombers, the destroyer escorted Chincoteague back to Espiritu Santo. During the next four months Jenkins engaged in escort duty, training exercises, and preparations for the Gilbert Islands campaign. She joined the screen of Rear Adm. Arthur W. Radford's Northern Carrier Group which bombed Makin and Tarawa during the landings 15 November. Then the destroyer sailed with the carrier force to attack Kwajalein and Wotje in the Marshalls on 4 December. During these raids the aircraft carrier was hit by a torpedo, and Jenkins was assigned to escort her back to Pearl Harbor where she arrived 9 December. Jenkins departed Hawaii 25 January 1944 with a tanker unit to fuel fast carriers and ships covering the Marshall Islands campaign. She operated with the refueling group through February, and conducted shore bombardment on Bougainville during March. She departed Seeadler Harbor 20 April to rendezvous with Task Force 77 for amphibious operations at Hollandia and Aitape. The landings took place 22 April, and their successful conclusion gave American Pacific forces another base from which to unleash further attacks on remaining enemy-held islands. After escort duty and anti-submarine patrols, Jenkins made a search in early June to thwart any attempt by the Japanese to reinforce their Biak garrison. She then covered and provided shore bombardment for the invasions of Noemfoor, Sansapor, and Morotai, as well as patrolling and escorting reinforcements for these operations throughout the summer. Jenkins once again departed Manus, Admiralties, 12 October for the Leyte invasion scheduled 20 October. Upon arrival, the destroyer was assigned to radar picket duty, from which she performed fighter director duties. As the main fleet engaged in Battle for Leyte Gulf, Jenkins continued her services on the picket station until 27 November. On 28 December Jenkins sortied from Aitape to provide close cover for the Luzon Attack Force. After receiving some damage from the enemy shore battery, the destroyer returned to Leyte 12 January 1945. Ten days later she departed to assist in hunter-killer operations in the Lingayen Gulf area. She remained on anti-submarine patrol until proceeding to cover minesweeping and shore bombardment on Corregidor 13 February. She continued to support the landings in the islands, giving valuable fire support and anti-submarine assistance until late April. She departed Subic Bay 24 April to cover minesweeping and amphibious operations in the Celebes Sea off Borneo. Jenkins struck a mine off Tarakan Island on 30 April and sailed into Subic Bay for repairs. On 18 June she sailed for the United States to complete repairs, arriving at San Pedro, California 8 July. She remained on the West Coast through the duration of the war. The destroyer decommissioned at San Diego on 1 May 1946. The outbreak of the Korean War necessitated additional naval strength to maintain America's worldwide commitments. Jenkins recommissioned as DDE-447 on 2 November 1951 under the command of Commander C. F. McGivern. She departed San Diego on 25 February 1952 for a training period at Pearl Harbor. Upon completion of training, she arrived at Japan on 12 June; and during the summer she operated with Task Force 77 which furnished air support for the ground forces in Korea. She also engaged in patrol duties off Korea and Taiwan before returning to her homeport Pearl Harbor on 5 December. She operated out of Pearl until 10 November 1953 when she sailed for another Far Eastern tour. This cruise was highlighted by Korean and Formosan patrols before returning to Pearl Harbor 15 June. From 1954 through 1963, Jenkins sailed annually to the Far East for peacekeeping operations with the 7th Fleet. In her 1958 deployment the 7th Fleet was on ready alert, as the Chinese Communists commenced harassment of the Chinese Nationalist islands of Quemoy and Matsu. During the sixties, the 7th Fleet deployments were of greater importance because of the Communist insurgency in Laos and Vietnam. For the greater part of 1964 and 1965, Jenkins operated out of Pearl Harbor. Jenkins sailed for the Far East 9 February 1966 and on 21 February was assigned to gunfire support duty and effectively shelled enemy troop concentrations to assist Marines fighting in Vietnam. But for breathers in the Philippines and Japan, she continued this duty until returning to Pearl Harbor on 22 July. Jenkins operated in Hawaiian waters until entering U.S. Naval Shipyard at Pearl Harbor on 11 September for a major overhaul which was completed early in 1967. The destroyer then prepared for another deployment in the war zone. Honors Jenkins received 14 battle stars for World War II service and 1 star for Korean War service.

He also served as Nashville's city attorney in the early 1900s, and as Tennessee's state treasurer in the 1920s and early 1930s. Inaugurated as governor at the height of the Great Depression, McAlister enacted massive spending cuts in an attempt to stabilize state finances. He coordinated federal programs in the state aimed at providing Depression-era relief.Dan Pierce, \\"Hill McAlister,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 11 December 2012. McAlister withdrew from state politics in 1936 following a quarrel with powerful Memphis political boss E. H. Crump. He spent the last two decades of his life as a Referee in Bankruptcy in Nashville's district court.Phillip Langsdon, Tennessee: A Political History (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 305-309, 319-325. Early life McAlister was born in Nashville, Tennessee in 1875, the son of William McAlister, a lawyer and judge, and Laura (Dortch) McAlister. He attended Vanderbilt University, graduating with a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B) in 1897. He was admitted to the bar, and began practice in Nashville in 1899. McAlister became Nashville's assistant city attorney in 1901, and was elevated to city attorney in 1905. He was elected to the Tennessee Senate in 1910, and served two terms (1911-1915). As a state senator, he sought stricter enforcement of laws regarding education and child labor, and advocated better food and drug inspections. He also sought funding for a tuberculosis hospital for Nashville. McAlister was an elector for President Woodrow Wilson in 1916, and served on the state Democratic Executive Committee from 1918 to 1920. The Tennessee General Assembly appointed McAlister state treasurer in 1919. He served in this position until 1927, and again from 1931 to 1933. During the 1920s, he consistently warned that the state faced an impending financial crisis, and assailed Governor Austin Peay's reforms. Governor In the governor's race of 1926, McAlister sought the Democratic Party's nomination against the incumbent, Austin Peay. Peay had radically transformed the state government, and had angered numerous members of his own party in the process, among them political bosses E. H. Crump of Memphis and Hilary Howse of Nashville. With the help of Crump and Howse, McAlister was able to win Shelby and Davidson counties, but Peay won the state's rural areas and East Tennessee, and defeated McAlister for the nomination by 7,000 votes. In 1928, McAlister again sought the nomination, this time against incumbent Henry Horton, who had become governor following Peay's death the previous year. McAlister had the support of Crump and Howse, while Horton had the support of powerful publisher Luke Lea. A third candidate, Lewis S. Pope, also sought the nomination. Though the primary campaign was hard-fought, McAlister fell short, losing to Horton 97,333 votes to 92,017 (Pope tallied just 27,779 votes). By late 1930, the effects of the stock market crash of 1929 had reached Tennessee. A few days after Horton's victory in the general election, numerous banks controlled by Lea's business associate, Rogers Caldwell, failed, wiping out over $6 million in state deposits. Horton faced impeachment, and Lea was indicted on charges of bank fraud. While the motion calling for Horton's impeachment failed in the state House, both Caldwell and Lea were eventually convicted on charges of bank fraud. McAlister, who had warned of the impending crisis, was reappointed state treasurer, and sought the party's nomination for governor again in 1932. Although Horton had survived impeachment, he did not seek further reelection, and McAlister's main competitors were Pope and former governor Malcolm R. Patterson. Crump's support, which gave McAlister a 25,000-vote advantage in Shelby County, proved to be the deciding factor, as McAlister won the nomination, 117,400 votes to 108,400 for Pope, and 60,520 for Patterson. Pope accused Crump of voter fraud, and ran against McAlister in the general election as an independent. On election day, McAlister won easily, with 169,075 votes to 117,797 for the Republican candidate, John E. McCall, and 106,990 for Pope.Our Campaigns - TN Governor, 1932. Retrieved: 11 December 2012. Facing a $6 million state debt and an economy ravaged by business and bank failures, McAlister immediately began trimming the state government. He slashed over 2,300 jobs from the government workforce, and cut $7 million in state spending. These cuts included the cost of the governor's mansion, which McAlister reduced from $35,000 per year to just $1,000. McAlister supported the Tennessee Valley Authority and other Depression-era federal programs. The construction of Norris Dam and Pickwick Landing Dam began during his tenure. In April 1933, shortly after the beginning of McAlister's term, the state adopted the iris as the state flower, and the mockingbird as the state bird. In 1934, Pope, determined to break Crump's power, again challenged McAlister for the Democratic nomination, but came up short, winning just 137,253 votes to McAlister's 191,460.Our Campaigns - TN Governor, 1934. Retrieved: 11 December 2012. In the general election, Pope once again ran as an independent, and tried to form a fusion ticket with former Republican governor Ben W. Hooper, similar to the one that had elected Hooper more than two decades earlier. Hooper called on Republicans to support Pope in the gubernatorial election, while Pope called on independent Democrats to support Hooper in his Senate campaign against Crump ally, Kenneth McKellar. The plan failed, however, with Pope losing to McAlister, 198,743 votes to 122,965, and McKellar soundly defeating Hooper.Our Campaigns - TN Governor, 1934. Retrieved: 11 December 2012. During his second term, McAlister angered Crump by proposing a state sales tax. Crump's allies in the state house defeated the tax, and he broke off support for McAlister, calling him \\"our sorriest governor.\\"Stanley Folmsbee, Robert Corlew, and Enoch Mitchell, Tennessee: A Short History (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1969), p. 501. McAlister angered Crump further when he refused to allow the sale of liquor in Memphis (federal prohibition had ended with the repeal of the 18th Amendment, but state prohibition remained in effect). Realizing he had little chance of winning without Crump's support, McAlister did not seek reelection to a third term. Later life Following his second term, McAlister retired to his home in Nashville, and continued to practice law. He was appointed field counsel for the Bituminous Coal Commission in Washington, D.C., in 1936. In 1940, he was appointed Referee in Bankruptcy for Nashville's federal district court, and remained in this position for the rest of his life. He died on October 30, 1959, and was buried in Nashville's Mount Olivet Cemetery. Family McAlister was descended (via his mother) from two former Tennessee governors, Willie Blount (1768-1835), his great-great-grandfather, and Aaron V. Brown (1795-1859), his great-grandfather. Willie Blount was the younger half-brother of territorial governor, William Blount. McAlister married Louise Jackson, daughter of U.S. Supreme Court justice Howell E. Jackson, in 1901. They had two daughters.

As is the case with all Philippine tarictic hornbills, it has been considered a subspecies of P. panini. The Samar hornbill is often included as a subspecies of the Mindanao hornbill.  Subspecies  There are two subspecies: * P. a. affinis (the nominate subspecies). Found on the islands of Mindanao, Dinagat and Siargao. * P. affinis basilanica. Found on the island of Basilan.  Behavior  It is social and often seen in pairs or small groups. These birds are noisy, emitting an incessant ta-rik-tik call, hence the name. Despite their noise they are difficult to find, being well camouflaged by the dense foliage. = Diet = The principal food of Mindanao hornbill is fruit. It also eats insects, beetles, ants and earthworms (rarely). In captivity The Mindanao hornbill is often labelled as Penelopides panini in zoos, due to the taxonomic complications of this genus. London Zoo used to keep a bird labeled in this way. There are now very few Mindanao hornbills outside the Philippines. Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens keep an elderly female.

Richard Onslow donated the first 6 acres of land on which the cathedral stands, with Viscount Bennett, a former Prime Minister of Canada, purchasing the remaining land and donating it to the cathedral in 1947. Designed by Edward Maufe and built between 1936 and 1961, it is the seat of the Bishop of Guildford. Construction The Diocese of Guildford was created in 1927, covering most of Surrey. Work began nine years later on its cathedral. Following a design competition, The Cathedral Committee chose Edward Maufe (later Sir Edward Maufe) as its architect and the foundation stone was laid by Cosmo Lang, Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1936.Maufe, Edward. Guildford Cathedral. Pitkin Pictorals Ltd, 1966. The brief for the competition specified that construction costs for the entire building should be ¬£250,000. Work began in 1937 but had to be suspended during the Second World War. From 1927 until the dedication of the cathedral in 1961 Guildford's restored Georgian Holy Trinity Church served as pro-cathedral. In 1952 Walter Boulton, who had ministered mostly in India, was made Rector of Holy Trinity and provost (head priest at the pro-cathedral) and revitalised the fund-raising for the new cathedral. The building was consecrated in the presence of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth on 17 May 1961. Much to the disappointment of people in Guildford town and diocese the first Dean of Guildford was not Walter Boulton but The Right Reverend George Clarkson. The building was finally completed in 1965. By the time that building restrictions were lifted after WW2 there was little left of the original ¬£250,000 previously raised to build the cathedral. The Cathedral Committee, and its formidable secretary, Miss Eleanor Iredale, launched the 'Buy-a Brick' campaign 1952. Between 1952 and 1961 more than 200,000 ordinary people paid 2s 6d (roughly ¬£6 in today's money) to sign their name, or the name of another person on a brick. Elizabeth II and Prince Philip both signed bricks, which are on display inside the cathedral, along with bricks signed by other members of the Royal Family. Before the war, the bricks themselves were made from the clay removed during the installation of 778 piles, driven 50 feet into the hill. They were made by the brickworks at the bottom of Stag Hill. After the war, the brickworks ceased to trade, and bricks were then bought from a brickmakers in Beare Green, Sussex. There is a slight colour variation between the local bricks (forming the eastern end of the cathedral) and the Sussex bricks, forming the western end, tower, garths and Lady Chapel. Location Where to put the cathedral for the new diocese of Guildford was a vexing question until Richard, Lord Onslow donated 6 acres atop Stag Hill -- so named because the Kings of England used to hunt there. Its solid red brick outline is visible for miles around. Whilst in 1932 this was far outside the town of Guildford, the growth since then has already begun to wrap around the cathedral to the west and south. Guildford Cathedral shares Stag Hill with the main campus of the University of Surrey. Description Guildford Cathedral The vaulting of the South Nave side aisle Writing in 1932, Maufe said: ‚ÄòThe ideal has been to produce a design, definitely of our own time, yet in the line of the great English Cathedrals; to build anew on tradition, to rely on proportion, mass, volume and line rather than on elaboration and ornament.' Pevsner Architectural Guides described the building as 'sweet-tempered, undramatic Curvilinear Gothic', and the interior as 'noble and subtle.' Maufe was influenced by the Continental cathedrals, notably Albi Cathedral in France, and favoured clean modern design in a Gothic Revival style. It is said that the design for Guildford Cathedral in turn influenced the design of Auckland Cathedral in New Zealand. The tower is high, and contains twelve bells, ten of which were cast by Mears and Stainbank in 1965. The bells were augmented to 12 with two Whitechapel trebles in 1975. The largest bell weighs 30cwt (just over 1.5 tonnes) and is tuned to the key of D. At the top of the tower stands a gilded angel, which turns in the wind. Inside, the cathedral appears to be filled with light, with pale Somerset limestone pillars and white Italian marble floors. It is a Grade II* listed building. The angel on the top of the tower was given in memory of Sgt. Reginald Adgey-Edgar of the Intelligence Corps, who died on active service in 1944 during World War II. It was designed by William Pickford and created by four silversmiths, before being positioned in Spring 1963. The supporting pole for the angel houses mobile phone antennas. The wooden cross which stands outside the eastern end of the cathedral was erected in 1933 before construction work began in order to mark the site of the new cathedral. Known as the Ganges Cross, it is made from timbers of Burma teak from the battleship . The ship's emblem ‚Äî an elephant ‚Äî is embedded in the wood. Sir Edward Maufe's wife, Lady Prudence Maufe - an internal designer, Director of Heal and Sons Ltd. and noted broderer - was instrumental in the design of the textiles within the cathedral. Unusually, Maufe's contract included complete control over the internal fittings and colour scheme of the cathedral. This colour scheme references Guildford's wool trade past, notably the blue colour that Guildford wool was famous for. The 1,447 kneelers, using a combination of standard and individual designs, were each reviewed and approved by Lady Maufe and her committee. They were made by over 400 individuals, mainly from the British Isles, but including people from other countries, such as Australia and New Zealand. Whilst most were made during the late 1950s and early 1960s, there are examples dating back to the late 1930s, and they collectively form a fascinating record of society and life at that time. 20th-century sculptors and artists are well represented at Guildford Cathedral, notably Eric Gill, Vernon Hill, Mary Spencer Watson, Dennis Huntley, Alan Collins and local artists John Cobbett and Douglas Stephen. Charles Gurrey created a series of sculptures above the West Front, to mark the Millennium, whilst Canadian sculptor Nicholas Thompson completed a sculpture of a WWI mother and child in 2016. There are three side chapels. The Children's Chapel is dedicated to children who have died, and holds a book of remembrance for children of any age. The Chapel of the Queen's Royal Surrey Regiment holds the regimental colours and was dedicated in 1959 to the Honour of King Charles the Martyr. The Queen's Royal Regiment was founded in 1661 as the Tangiers Regiment on the marriage of King Charles II and Catherine of Braganza. The Lady Chapel was built using funds donated by the Canadian people, in recognition of the support for Canadian troops stationed in the area during both world wars. It contains a figure of the Madonna and Child, carved in lignum vitae by Douglas Stephen, the then manager of Barclays Bank, Chelsea. The altar and altar rails were originally used in the chapel in the crypt, the place of worship for the original parish, during the construction of the cathedral. The crypt chapel is now used as the choir room. Stained glass Guildford cathedral contains fewer stained glass windows than average, having predominantly a clear glazing scheme (using opaque glass to soften the light) to complement the modernist architectural style of the building. However it includes works by Moira Forsyth, William Wilson, James Powell and Sons, Ninian Comper and Lawrence Lee.  Carved glass  One of three etched glass angels above the south porch doors at Guildford Cathedral, by John Hutton The cathedral has etched glass works by New Zealand-born artist John Hutton. One set adorns the panel at the west entrance; the other is above the internal doors to the south porch.

He was tried for the murder of Millie Gee, his cousin and ex-lover. The trial took place in the Old Carleton County Court House, and he was hanged in the Woodstock Gaol.  The murder  George and Millie had been seeing each other for three or four years, when Millie lost interest and asked him not to see her anymore. Shortly thereafter, she was hired to look after the house and children of Bennie Gee because his wife had left him. She stayed in the house next door with Bennie's sister Catherine and her husband Daniel Crane. On Saturday, 12 March 1904, George arrived at Bennie's residence with a Lee‚ÄìEnfield Rifle that he had borrowed from a Lt. Weldon W. Melville. He had been drinking steadily for most of the afternoon, but was friendly enough when he arrived, and left the rifle at the door. He stayed late, playing cards with Bennie and continuing to drink until three in the morning, when George announced that he should leave and was helped to the door by Millie. As he was going out he uttered his later famous words, \\"I suppose you don't know that this is the night you're going to die.\\" He then turned around, picked up the rifle and fired. The bullet ricocheted off the frame of the door and entered Millie's chest, knocking her to the floor. Hearing the shot, Bennie ran to the door. George fired twice in his direction but missed. He then fled. After a time he walked the long distance to a phone and called Dep. Sheriff Foster to turn himself in. Three doctors were called to attend Millie, but they could not save her life. She died the following Wednesday a short time after giving her deposition to Dep. Sheriff Foster.  The trial  After a preliminary hearing, the trial was set for 26 April 1904 with Judge Tucker presiding. Attorney General Pugsley was for the Crown. J. Chipman Hartley and T C L Ketchum were for the defense. Gee pleaded not guilty and the calling of witnesses began. In all, 23 were called, most of them close friends and relatives. In his closing arguments Ketchum pleaded with the jury that Gee was insane, drunk, and too poor to mount a proper defense. He claimed a charge of manslaughter would be more appropriate. His full argument lasted a full hour and left Gee in tears. The crown argued that the crime was premeditated and that Gee couldn't have been insane, as he had obviously realized his crime when he turned himself in. The jury deliberated for only 45 minutes before they returned a verdict of guilty. Judge Tucker sentenced Gee to hang on the grounds of the (then) new jail.  The execution  The hanging went forward as planned, on July 22, although there was a delay for the rope to be shipped in from out of town, since no one from the town would sell it. He was baptized into the Adventist Church before his death. The executioner, Radcliffe, was swift in the hanging, and the rope snapped Gee's neck. He was pronounced dead 12 minutes afterward.

He was elevated to the position when Governor Austin Peay died in office, and as Speaker of the Tennessee Senate, he was first in the line of succession. He was subsequently elected to two full terms, then of only two years each. Horton's tenure as governor was marred by a scandal after the Stock Market crash in 1929. The related collapse of the financial empires of his political allies, Luke Lea and Rogers Caldwell, cost the state more than $6 million (the equivalent of over $86 million in 2017) in funds deposited in their banks by Horton's administration. The legislature voted to impeach the governor, but the measure did not carry and he served out his term.Jeanette Keith, \\"Henry Horton,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 9 December 2012. He retired from politics and returned to his farm in Marshall County. Early life Horton was born in 1866 in the Princeton community of Jackson County, Alabama, one of twelve children of Henry Hollis Horton, a Baptist minister, and Anne (Moore) Horton.Phillip Langsdon, Tennessee: A Political History (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 312-318. He attended Scottsboro Academy in Scottsboro, Alabama, before graduating from Winchester College in Winchester, Tennessee, in 1888. He moved to Hillsboro, Texas, to teach school, but returned to Tennessee after about a year. He attended the University of the South in Sewanee in the early 1890s to study law. Horton was admitted to the bar in 1894, and practiced law in Franklin County.Nancy Capace, Encyclopedia of Tennessee (North American Book Dist. LLC, 2000), pp. 139-140. He held various local offices, including school director and election commissioner, and worked as director of the Home Bank of Winchester. Marriage and family Horton married Adeline Wilhoite in 1896. They had one son. Early political career Horton was elected to represent Franklin County for one term in the Tennessee House of Representatives, from 1907 to 1909.Ed Speer, The Tennessee Handbook (McFarland, 2000), p. 142. He was a supporter of prohibition. In 1911, Horton and his family moved to Marshall County, Tennessee. He operated a farm and mill that had been established by his in-laws, the Wilhoites, on the Duck River near Chapel Hill. Governor Horton was elected to the Tennessee Senate in 1926 for the district of Marshall and Lincoln counties. When the senate convened early the following year, he was chosen as Speaker of that body, which in Tennessee is the governor's constitutional successor. Following Governor Austin Peay's death in office on October 2, 1927, Horton thus became governor. Unfamiliar with running a statewide campaign, Horton turned to Peay's longtime adviser, Luke Lea, publisher of the Nashville Tennessean, to help him win reelection in 1928. Lea's rivals, Memphis political boss E. H. Crump and Nashville political boss Hilary Howse, both endorsed Hill McAlister, who had been defeated by Peay in 1926. A third candidate, Lewis S. Pope, also sought the Democratic nomination, and had the backing of Peay's widow. After a hard-fought primary campaign, Horton won the nomination with 97,333 votes to 92,017 for McAlister, and 27,779 for Pope. In the general election, he defeated the Republican candidate, Raleigh Hopkins, 195,546 votes to 124,733.Our Campaigns - TN Governor, 1928. Retrieved: 10 December 2012. Because of Unionist whites in Eastern Tennessee and numerous freedmen and their descendants in Middle and especially Western Tennessee, who aligned with the Republican Party, Tennessee had competitive elections for a longer period than most of the Confederate states. They had disenfranchised most blacks and were one-party states from the turn of the 20th century. During Horton's second term, he and Lea began using state patronage to distribute jobs in Memphis in an attempt to weaken Crump's influence there. Crump, who was running for Congress and wanted to focus on his own campaign, agreed to support Horton in the 1930 governor's race if he and Lea would stop providing patronage to his foes. With Crump out of the way, Horton defeated his chief opponent, Lambert Estes Gwinn, 123,642 to 88,416 in the Democratic primary. He defeated the Republican candidate, C. Arthur Bruce, in the general election, winning 144,995 votes to Bruce's 101,285. While the stock market had crashed in 1929, its effects had not fully reached Tennessee by the 1930 elections. Four days after Horton was reelected governor, however, the Bank of Tennessee, which was controlled by Lea and his business associate, Rogers Caldwell, was declared insolvent, and numerous banks controlled by Caldwell across the South soon followed. Horton had deposited more than $6 million (the equivalent of over $86 million in 2017) in state funds in Caldwell's banks, all of which was lost. Crump and his allies, sensing an opportunity, assailed Horton for depositing state funds in the banks of his political allies. They also attacked Horton for awarding no-bid contracts to Caldwell's road-paving company, Kyrock. A motion calling for Horton's impeachment was voted on by the state House in June 1931, but the motion failed, 58 to 41. Horton was allowed to finish out his term, but did not seek further reelection. At the time, the term limit provision in the Tennessee State Constitution limited an incumbent to three consecutive full two-year terms. Both Lea and Caldwell were eventually convicted of bank fraud. During Horton's tenure as governor, he continued most of Peay's reform initiatives. He abolished a land tax that had been unpopular with farmers, established a parole board, created a state division of aeronautics, and developed a secondary state highway system. He also had statues of Andrew Jackson and John Sevier placed in Statuary Hall in Washington, D.C. Later life and legacy Following his final term as governor, Horton retired to his farm in Marshall County. He died from an apparent stroke on July 2, 1934. He was buried in Lewisburg, Tennessee.National Governors Association *In 1961, the state purchased Horton's Marshall County farm from his heirs.

A Dean, 1864 The geology of Hertfordshire describes the rocks of the English county of Hertfordshire which are a northern part of the great shallow syncline known as the London Basin. The beds dip in a south-easterly direction towards the syncline's lowest point roughly under the River Thames. The most important formations are the Cretaceous chalks, which are exposed as the high ground in the north and west of the county, and the Cenozoic rocks made up of the Paleocene age Reading beds and Eocene age London Clay that occupies the remaining southern part.Hertfordshire Geological Society The Cretaceous Barkway Chalk Pit, a nature reserve in Barkway in Hertfordshire managed by the Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust. The exposed chalk is a block displaced by an ice sheet which once covered the area On the northern boundary and just inside the county, at the foot of the chalk Chiltern Hills, near Tring and Ashwell, there is a small strip of exposed Cretaceous Gault Clay and Upper Greensand. At 100 million years old, these are the oldest rocks in the county. Rocks get progressively younger as one moves in a south easterly direction through the county. The lowest layer of the chalk is the Chalk Marl, which, with the Totternhoe Clunch Stone above it, lies at the base of the Chiltern Hills escarpment. This is visible as a terrace projecting north-westwards, near Whipsnade and Ivinghoe. Above these beds, the Lower and Middle Chalk, without flints, rise up sharply to form the steepest part of the Dunstable Downs, which are the easterly continuation of the Chiltern Hills. Next comes the Chalk Rock, which, being a hard bed, caps the hilltops by Boxmoor, Apsley End and near Baldock. The Upper Chalk slopes southward towards the Paleogene boundary to the south. All the chalk was deposited between 100 million and 66 million years ago when the area was at the bottom of a shallow sea and some distance from the nearest land. The chalk is often covered by a clay-with-flints deposit, which is formed of the weathered remnants of Cenozoic rocks and chalk.Dacorum Landscape Character Assessment 2002 The Cenozoic The Palaeocene Reading beds consist of mottled and yellow clays and sands, the latter are frequently hardened into masses made up of pebbles in a siliceous cement, known locally as Hertfordshire puddingstone. Examples of Reading Beds outliers occur in what are otherwise chalky areas at St Albans, Ayot Green, Burnham Green, Micklefield Green, Sarratt, and Bedmond. The Reading Beds were laid down about 60 million years ago when the area was a river estuary receiving river sediment from land to the west. The London Clay is a stiff, blue clay that weathers to brown and rests nearly everywhere upon the Reading beds. It represents the time 55 to 40 million years ago when Hertfordshire was once again under a deeper sea but was near enough to land to receive fine mud deposits. =The Ice Age= Tyttenhanger: Gravel pit workings. Flooded gravel pits to the left with a conveyor belt bringing material into a central batching plant from more distant active workings, the River Colne to the right. The gravel was deposited here by the primordial River Thames as it flowed through Hertfordshire. About 478,000 to 424,000 years ago during the ice age period known as the Anglian Stage, glaciers approached from the North Sea and reached as far south-west as Bricket Wood. Glacial gravels and boulder clays cover a great deal of the whole area to the north east of the county and the Upper Chalk itself has been disturbed at Reed and Barley by glaciation. Prior to the ice ages the River Thames followed a path through the southern part of Hertfordshire, running from the area of modern Staines up the valley of the Colne to Hatfield and then eastward across Essex originally towards the primeval Rhine but later down the valley of the modern River Lea. This path was blocked by a mass of ice near Hatfield and a lake ponded up to the west of this around St Albans. Waters eventually overflowed near Staines to cut the path of the modern Thames through central London. When the ice retreated about 400,000 years ago the river bed along the new route followed the lower path and so the river remained on its present-day course. The flow in the Colne valley reversed, now flowing south as a tributary into the modern Thames. Superficial gravel deposits from the primordial Thames, are found throughout the Vale of St. Albans. At the retreat of the glaciers, wind blown powdered rock known as loess was deposited over the whole county, forming thin layers under a metre thick. This reddish clay is easily formed into bricks at the lowish temperatures attainable in a wood-fired kiln and gained the name brickearth. It gave rise to rural brick-making industries scattered throughout the county. It also makes for fine, easily cultivated and fertile soils.

Some of the Norwich diagrams (the day's operating schedule for a locomotive) required two return trips a day to London totalling 460 miles. The introduction of the Britannia Pacifics revolutionised express services in East Anglia. From 1958, diesel-electric locomotives began to replace steam locomotives. 70013 remained at Norwich until w/e 16 September 1961 when transferred to March depot (shed code 31B), having covered 698,000 miles in just over ten years, an excellent figure. Norwich depot, under the shedmaster Bill Harvey, was renowned for the fine mechanical condition of its locomotives.

On 3 October 1966, 70013 entered Crewe Works and became the last BR-owned steam locomotive to undergo routine heavy overhaul, being out- shopped after a special ceremony in February 1967. 70013 was selected to operate the last steam passenger train prior to the abolition of steam traction on British Railways lines, and in the summer of 1968 Oliver Cromwell hauled several specials, culminating in the Fifteen Guinea Special which ran between Liverpool and Carlisle on 11 August that year and which 70013 hauled on the Manchester to Carlisle leg of the trip. Preservation Welham Green pulling the Great Northern from Cleethorpes to King's Cross on 28 February 2009 70013 Oliver Cromwell approaching Weybourne on the North Norfolk Railway on 11 March 2010 Oliver Cromwell became part of the National Railway Museum's National Collection immediately after the end of the Fifteen Guinea Special (70000 Britannia, later preserved privately, had previously been earmarked for this move). Despite a steam ban after 11 August 1968, 70013 moved under its own steam on 12 August to its old shed at Norwich and then, on 13 August, to Diss whence it was transported by road to Bressingham Steam & Gardens. At Bressingham, 70013 was in service to provide footplate rides until the 1980s, before retiring into the museum exhibition. In 2004, it was announced that Oliver Cromwell would be restored to main-line standard in preparation for the 40th anniversary of the end of steam, with significant financial assistance from the readers of Steam Railway magazine. The locomotive was overhauled at the Great Central Railway (GCR) to mainline standards which included the fitting of the train protection warning system, overhaul of 70013's automatic warning system and the fitting of a train event recorder. On the weekend of 3 May - 4 May 2008, the locomotive hauled its first revenue-earning passenger services since being restored on the GCR's eight-mile route. The locomotive made an appearance at the National Railway Museum's 1968 and All That event celebrating 40 years since the end of steam. Its first mainline passenger charter since 1968 was on 10 August 2008 when the locomotive took part in a re-run of the Fifteen Guinea Special. It then went on to operate on the Scarborough Spa Express later in the month. On 9 September 2008, Oliver Cromwell completed a re-run of The Norfolkman running from Liverpool Street station to Norwich railway station and return, visiting the site of its former home of Norwich shed (32A). 70013 carried a 32A shed plate on the smokebox to complete the image. On 8 November 2008, the locomotive was temporarily re-numbered as 70048 and renamed \\"The Territorial Army 1908 - 2008\\" to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Territorial Army. The naming was performed by The Duke of Gloucester at station on the preserved GCR. 70048 was a sister member of the BR Standard Class 7 Britannia class and was named \\"The Territorial Army 1908 - 1958\\". During the 2008 renaming, 70013 carried this name on the right-hand-side smoke deflector as a reminder of the original name and as a link with the past association with the Territorial Army. On 14 March 2009 Oliver Cromwell hauled a special on what was said to be the very last train (of any sort) to use the branch line down to Folkestone Harbour, where main line trains used to meet with cross channel ferries. On 23 May 2009, the locomotive hauled a railtour from Norwich to Poole in Dorset, and then travelled to the Swanage Railway under its own power, via Wareham and the re-instated link between the main-line and the Swanage Railway at Motala. On 11 March 2010, Oliver Cromwell hauled the opening railtour over the newly re-instated level crossing at Sheringham on the North Norfolk Railway, arriving from King's Cross, via Cambridge and Norwich. On 3 May 2010, Oliver Cromwell was used for a private charter by Girlguiding UK, as part of the celebration of 100 years of Guiding. Brownies Take Over the Tracks ran between London Victoria and Windsor & Eton Riverside. On Saturday 15 May 2010, two years after its previous overhaul, Oliver Cromwell suffered from cracks in the firebox and was moved to the GCR for an inspection which led to the locomotive being withdrawn from service. During 2010, 70013 Oliver Cromwell underwent firebox repairs at Crewe Heritage Centre. The cab was removed before the rest of the locomotive was sent for repairs to the boiler. Following these repairs, on 17 December 2010 the locomotive had a successful steam test at Crewe. On 8 March 2011, the locomotive was taken to Southall, and on 12 March 2011 hauled \\"The Lincoln Imp\\" from London Victoria to Lincoln, returning to Kings Cross. On 27 May 2012, the locomotive was involved in a blowback incident at Wood Green tunnel near New Southgate station in North London on a Railway Touring Company railtour called 'The Peak Forester'. Two of the three crew on board the locomotive had to attend hospital as a result. A Rail Accident Investigation Branch investigation was conducted after the accident. On 11 August 2013, 70013 took part in the 45th anniversary train of The Fifteen Guinea Special along with three LMS Black 5s, 44932, 45305 and 45231. 70013 took the train from Longsight to Carlisle traveling via Farington Junction, Blackburn and Hellifield while traveling along the Settle and Carlisle line.http://www.uksteam.info/tours/t13/t0811b.htm On 3 March 2018, 70013 hauled its final main line charter from Ealing Broadway to York via the Midland Main Line prior to the expiry of its boiler certificate. It then moved to the GCR. 70013 later had a boiler inspection which enabled it to run on the GCR until 31 December 2018. It ran GCR services for the last time on that date before being withdrawn for overhaul. In 2019 it moved to the GCR to be overhauled.Great Central secures overhaul agreement for Oliver Cromwell The Railway Magazine issue 1421 August 2019 page 70GCR awarded custody of Oliver Cromwell by NRM Heritage Railway issue 257 August 2019 page 21 References External links * 5305 Locomotive Association (which currently cares for 70013) 7 70013 Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1951 Category:4-6-2 locomotives Category:Individual locomotives of Great Britain Category:Standard gauge steam locomotives of Great Britain ","title":"BR Standard Class 7 70013 Oliver Cromwell"},{"id":"867241","text":"HMS Umbra (P35) was a Royal Navy U-class submarine built by Vickers- Armstrong at Barrow-in-Furness.

It was the headquarters of Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain and throughout the Second World War. During the war, two enemy bombs destroyed a wooden hut near the married quarters, a blast from a V1 flying bomb broke a few windows, and the windows in the Officers' Mess were shattered by a V2 rocket. The Royal Air Force station closed its operations on 30 May 2008, with all units relocating to new accommodation at RAF Northolt, a few miles away. The station incorporated Bentley Priory, which was originally built in 1766. The house was significantly extended in 1788, by Sir John Soane, for John Hamilton, 1st Marquess of Abercorn. It was the final home of the Dowager Queen Adelaide, queen consort of William IV, before her death there in 1849. Afterwards the building was used as a hotel and girls' school before being acquired by the RAF in 1926. The site includes a Grade II* listed Officers' Mess and Italian Gardens. These, together with the park, are designated a Registered Garden Grade II. The land south of the house is the Bentley Priory Nature Reserve, a Site of Special Scientific Interest maintained by Harrow Heritage Trust.Bentley Priory Nature Reserve, Harrow Heritage Trust Since its closure, the Officers' Mess has converted into the Bentley Priory Museum with exhibits focusing on the house's role during the Battle of Britain. The grounds have been redeveloped as a private residential housing estate. History The Priory building and 40 acres (comprising the present grounds) were sold to the Air Ministry for a sum thought to be about ¬£25,000. The remainder of the estate, about , were sold to a syndicate who divided it into plots for building purposes. Middlesex County Council bought , including the farm in front of the Priory which formed part of the Green Belt and the present Bentley Priory Open Space. On 26 May 1926, Inland Area (Training Command), a part of the organization of the Air Defence of Great Britain (ADGB) moved into the Priory from Uxbridge. In July 1926, it was renamed 'Training Command' and moved to Market Drayton in Shropshire. As the RAF grew in size the organizational base expanded with it and the foundations were laid for an air defence system which proved to be well in advance of the force it was shortly to oppose. The service was drastically reorganized with the creation of Bomber, Coastal, Fighter and Training Commands. The existing ADGB was dissolved and RAF Fighter Command emerged on 14 July 1936. It left Hillingdon House, at RAF Uxbridge on this date and moved to Bentley Priory with its first Air Officer Commanding Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding. Fighter Command Headquarters remained at the Priory until its merger with the other operational commands in 1968. A poem translated from Gray's 'Luna Habitabilis' Cambridge 1797 is associated with the Priory. A copy of the poem was given to AOC 11 Gp on 22 November 1989 by the Rt Hon The Lord Harvington, who stated that he had intended reading it out to the House of Commons at the end of the Battle of Britain, but the copy had been lost. At the time Harvington was Wing Commander R G G F Harvington RAuxAF and Conservative member for North St Pancras. He felt it appropriate to quote this 18th-century prophecy: :\\"The time will come, when thou shalt lift thine eyes, :To watch a long drawn battle in the skies, :While aged peasants, too amazed for words, :Stare at the flying fleets of wond'rous birds, :England so long the mistress of the sea, :Where winds and waves confess her sovereignty, :Her ancient triumph yet on high shall bear, :And reign, the sovereign of the conquered air.\\" However the quotation is misleading and based on selective editing of the original in which 'the battle' is a fleet of ships invading the moon and the aged peasants are moon-dwellers. =Royal Observer Corps= Observer Corps aircraft spotter in central London during World War II, stood on a Fleet Street rooftop with St Paul's Cathedral in the background. The Observer Corps moved to RAF Bentley Priory from its original location at RAF Uxbridge, along with Dowding and Fighter Command, during July 1936 and would remain at the Priory until it was stood down in December 1995. The Observer Corps was one of the cornerstones of Lord Dowding's air defence system and he said later in his despatch after the Battle of Britain: :\\"It is important to note that at this time they (the Observer Corps) constituted the whole means of tracking enemy raids once they had crossed the coastline. Their work throughout was quite invaluable. Without it the air-raid warning systems could not have been operated and inland interceptions would rarely have been made.\\" As a result of their efforts during the Battle of Britain the Observer Corps was granted the title Royal by King George VI and became a uniformed volunteer branch of the RAF from April 1941 for the remainder of its existence. Throughout its service the Royal Observer Corps was commanded by an RAF Air Commodore, each of whom served a tour of between three or four years. When the Corps' first Commandant Air Commodore Edward Masterman CB CBE AFC RAF(R‚Äôtd) had stood down in April 1936, Air Commodore Alfred Warrington-Morris CB CMG OBE AFC MiD RAF(R‚Äôtd) replaced him and took control of the Observer Corps during the important period immediately prior to the Second World War. He oversaw the move of HQ Observer Corps to Bentley Priory and the Corps‚Äô adoption by RAF Fighter Command. He also controlled the Corps during the memorable events of the Battle of Britain and was still at the helm when the Observer Corps was granted the title Royal to become the Royal Observer Corps and became a uniformed branch of the RAF. Warrington-Morris was Mentioned in Despatches in July 1940. The corps was created to provide a system for detecting, tracking and reporting aircraft over Britain. During World War II it was complementary to and often replaced the radar system in that it provided an 'over land' element while radar handled the 'over water approach' requirement. In 1955 the detection and reporting of nuclear blasts and fall-out was introduced. By 1965 the aircraft role was no longer needed and the corps formed the field force for the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation (UKWMO) until both organisations were disbanded after the Cold war ended. Initially the Observer Corps' presence at Bentley Priory included not only the small headquarters‚Äô staff of a dozen officers and support staff but also around sixty spare time observers who filled essential plotting tasks in the Bentley Priory operations rooms. In 1955 the observers relocated to a new dedicated ROC operations centre in nearby Watford. By 1968 the ROC headquarters consisted of its Air Commodore, 9 full-time ROC officers and around 15 MoD civilian support staff. The ROC officers, several of whom ‚Äòlived in‚Äô, took a full and active role in the life of the officers‚Äô mess and frequently filled mess committee positions. In 1992, a Royal Observer Corps stained glass window to mark the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, was installed in the officers‚Äô mess at RAF Bentley Priory. The window is located by the main door, just inside the corridor leading to the dining room and depicts two observers on duty at an Observer Corps post in central London with contrails overhead. The colourful window was constructed from an original design and drawing by Observer Lieutenant Commander A P Angove FBIM FITD, the Operations Training Officer (Ops Trg) at HQ ROC. The arched window was designed to balance a Royal Air Force stained glass window already located on the other side of the front door. The 10,000 member main field force of the ROC were stood down on 30 September 1991, and the ROC's original 1966 Royal Banner was laid up at St Clement Danes Church in the Strand, London where it remains on display, a new banner having been presented by HM The Queen in July 1991 during a Royal Review of the ROC and garden party at Bentley Priory. The Corps was dismantled following what was described by the Queen at the Royal Review as \\"the end of the Cold War\\" and linked to a Government press release that referred to \\"possible future developments and improvements in automated nuclear explosion and fallout detection from remote sensors\\". ROC Banner is marched into St Clement Danes church, London for laying up on 29 September 1991. The S Ad O, retitled as Senior ROC Officer (SROCO), Observer Commander N A Greig OBE and his adjutant Observer Lieutenant P Proost remained in post to administer the reduced ROC contingent under a revised RAF structure. Only the Nuclear Reporting Cell (NRC) elements of the Corps remained in service, working alongside major armed forces headquarters and they entered a new and highly- uncertain phase. Reduced to less than 300 members in total over the whole UK, the retained NRCs now found themselves tasked with the daunting challenge of providing a comprehensive Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) warfare analysis and warning service for the Military Home Commands, on a reserve- manned basis as NBCCs but without the previous flow of data from posts and controls. From 1991 onwards the \\"Remnant Elements\\" became a single reserve Directly Administered Unit within RAF Strike Command (RAFSTC). The position of Commandant ROC became a secondary appointment for the Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) of No. 11 Group RAF at Bentley Priory. All members were required to remove their original ROC Group designations from their RAF uniforms, and to accept moves towards a change in conditions of service during any Transition- To-War (TTW) that would make them effectively members of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force (RAuxAF), with protected rights, and closer links were made with the war-appointable flights of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR). Despite having successfully built upon the extensive NBC reporting trials, undertaken with the RAF Regiment and meeting full NATO standards and evaluations (STANAGs and OPEVALs), the conclusion reached by the UK MoD was that retention of the Corps in its NBC Cell role was \\"desirable, but not essential in the existing format\\". As a consequence, the remaining part-time members of the ROC were stood-down on 31 December 1995, after a laying-up ceremony for the 1991 ROC Banner in the Rotunda at RAF College Cranwell in Lincolnshire on 8 Dec 1995. The ROC Banner remains on display in the RAFC Cranwell rotunda alongside other stood-down Air Force units and squadrons that are subject to liability for reactivation in the future. Headquarters ROC at RAF Bentley Priory finally closed on 31 March 1996 after all administrative winding-up tasks were completed. The last Commandant of the Corps was Air Commodore Martin Widdowson. =Fighter Command= Fighter Command's Spitfire gate guardian. The aircraft was replaced by this fibre glass replica in 1992 when the original Spitfire was sold by the RAF into private ownership to be restored to flying condition RAF Fighter Command, under Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding with Air Commodore A D John Cunningham as his Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) and Air Commodore N J Gill as Air Officer Administration (AOA), consisted of 76 officers, 71 airmen and 84 civilians (including the 70 Observer Corps personnel). The units administered directly by HQ Fighter Command were No 11 (Fighter) Group, No 77 (Air Co-operation) Group and the Royal Observer Corps (from April 1941). In November 1938, No 3 Balloon Centre RAuxAF under command of Group Captain A. E. Bald was formed at RAF Stanmore Park and came under the operational umbrella of Dowding. The location details for the 'barrages' were planned at Bentley Priory. Prior to the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the Priory underwent many changes. Chief among these was the hurried adaptation of the two largest rooms (now the anteroom and the Ladies room) into the Operations Room and the Filter Room - moved from its original location in the Crypt bar; the classrooms in the east Wing were converted into accommodation. Externally, brown and green paint were sprayed over the outside of the building including the clock face, and many of the windows were blacked out. Dug-outs were built and sandbags deployed to protect the more important officers. In 1939, the magnificent conservatory was pulled down and replaced by the Operations staff wooden offices. The scene was now set for the wartime era, which is in a national context considered to be the most interesting and significant part of the Priory's history, and that of the RAF. In January 1939, work started on the underground Operations Block which was occupied and commenced operations on 9 March 1940. The average depth of the excavations was . In the Spring of 1940 Air Officer Commanding RAF Fighter Command, Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding, by then a widower, lived a very quiet domestic life with his sister Hilda at a house called Montrose (no longer standing) in Stanmore. He rarely went out socially and with an immense work load was happy to forgo all but duty functions. Every morning he would walk through the grounds to his office in the Priory. Dowding would often meet General Frederick Alfred Pile, who was the General Officer Commanding Anti- Aircraft Command, who was walking from his home, Glenthorn. The pair, who were firm friends, would use the time to talk about the war and other subjects. Dowding left visits to other stations in Fighter Command to his Staff Officers as he was much occupied with the work in his Priory office. However, he did pay regular night-time visits to research establishments and the air defences around London when The Blitz started in earnest in September 1940. These visits often followed periods of up to 48 hours at his desk leaving Dowding exhausted. Lord Beaverbrook and Winston Churchill made Dowding unwillingly relinquish command of Fighter Command on 24 November 1940 after he only approved some recommendations in a report to improve night air defences created by a committee of enquiry chaired by Sir John Salmond. Dowding's time leading Fighter Command left a lasting legacy on the organisation. His creation of the Operations and Filter Rooms, the essential elements of the Command, Control and Communications system, became the cornerstone of the Air Defence System. The system he developed gave air controllers the best chance of scrambling fighter squadrons to intercept Luftwaffe raids before they reached their targets. This rapid, flexible approach was essential because there were insufficient aircraft and crews to keep fighter patrols continuously airborne in 1940. He also played a significant part in encouraging research into night-fighter equipment and tactics. Historian and Dowding biographer, Robert Wright, who served as Dowding's personal assistance during the Battle of Britain, wrote in his book, Dowding and the Battle of Britain, that even when faced with threats of retirement and constant rebuttal, Dowding continued to give his all to those under him and the RAF service. Dowding noted in a letter Air Ministry in early March 1940, that: > \\"Apart from the question of discourtesy, which I do not wish to stress, I > must point out the lack of consideration involved in delaying a proposal to > this nature until ten days before the date of retirement. I have had four > retiring dates given to me and now you are proposing a fifth. Before the > War, as I told S of S, I should have been glad to retire: now I am anxious > to stay, because I feel that there is no one else who will fight as I do > when proposals are made which would reduce the Defence Forces of the Country > below extreme danger point.\\" Bentley Priory continued to act as the Headquarters of Fighter Command throughout the Second World War. It assumed additional importance as the Air planning headquarters for D-Day as the planning for the full operation was conducted at HMS Dryad near Portsmouth with Montgomery Eisenhower and Churchill attending a nearby church the evening before the assault. Much of the detailed air planning work was carried out at Kestrel Grove just a few hundred yards away (this building still stands and is now a retirement home). On D-Day, the landings were monitored by King George VI, Winston Churchill and U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower in the Allied Expeditionary Air Force War room in the Priory's underground bunker. The German artillery binoculars on display in the Dowding room were brought back on the C-in-C's orders, having been captured from positions overlooking the beaches in France. In September 1955 the Fighter Command Silver Band performed the first Beating the Retreat ceremony by the RAF in front of the Priory. Dowding's leather-topped desk, many of his papers and other effects still occupy the room in the Officers' Mess which he used as his office, with its views across a stone balcony to the formal Italian garden below. These will remain as part of the building for its future as a museum. =Anti-Aircraft Command= On 1 April 1939, HQ Anti- Aircraft Command (AAC) was formed under General Alan Brooke, but on 28 July 1939, he was suddenly moved to command the British Forces and General Sir Frederick Alfred Pile took over. Anti-Aircraft Command then moved to 'Glenthorn', and the Gordon crest was adopted as the badge of Anti-Aircraft Command. This crest, the 'flexed bow and arrow', can still be seen on a silver bowl, presented to the mess when AAC closed, and is displayed in the Dowding Room. A Plotters School existed in one of the local houses where trainees used bicycles and megaphones to learn how to map incoming enemy aircraft. =Airstrip= With the requirement for frequent high-level meetings the need for an airstrip at Bentley Priory grew. Air Commodore Richard 'Batchy' Atcherley undertook this project and dismayed, but probably not surprised, by Air Ministry War Department advice that it would take six months to construct two strips, he approached the Americans. The cinder T-strips were laid approximately east-West just south of the bunker with the leg of the T pointing south in just four days. A Bellman hangar was erected adjacent to the present Mess building. Flight Sergeant Geoff Elphick RAuxAF, a Battle of Britain pilot with 32 Sqn at Biggin Hill, flew out of the Priory from April 1944. During a recent visit he clearly recalled the day that he unceremoniously pulled Air Commodore Atcherley out of an Auster which he had rolled onto its back while landing. He also recalled quietly cutting down some birch trees which were making the landings a little too exciting. Bomber Harris also made some exciting landings and was apparently always complaining about 'those confounded balloons' which were not far away from the strip. Ironically, it was an aircraft of Bomber Command that came closest to destroying the Priory. A Wellington bomber of No 311 (Czech) Sqn returning to its base attempted to land on the lawns in front of the Priory. It narrowly missed the Priory and crashed outside the Sergeants' Mess; there was one survivor. =Post-war operations= After the war, the Priory gradually returned to something of its former self. However, on the night of 10 March 1947, the centre portion of the building, including the room above the Ante- Room and the offices on the floor above, were destroyed by a fire. Two years later, a new bar was built in the sub-basement under the Ante-Room. HRH Princess Elizabeth first visited the Priory in 1950. At some stage the wooden accommodation block was replaced with the three-storey building immediately to the west of the Mess and in 1953 a Conference Room was constructed on the second floor. Further restoration of the exterior of the building followed in 1954, together with the extension and modernisation of the Officers' Mess kitchen and servery. In 1955, the dining room was enlarged and rebuilt with a new roof. All this renovation was complete by 1958 when the Queen and other members of the Royal Family attended the RAF 40th Anniversary celebrations which were held at Bentley Priory. Despite the considerable work undertaken, it became apparent that deterioration was still taking place. In 1964, a surveyor's report showed that the Ante-Room rebuilt in 1947 was suffering from dry-rot. However, it was not until ten years later that the full extent of the decay was thoroughly investigated. In 1966, the clock face received an extensive overhaul. Made by John Moore in 1864, the clock was one of the last to be made before the gravity escapement principle was introduced. It was wound weekly and had a pendulum with a two and a quarter second beat. The clock was lost in the fire of 1979 but the original bells survived. On 30 April 1968, Fighter Command was amalgamated with other operational commands to form Strike Command. The Fighter Command badge remains above the main entrance Headquarters No 11 (Fighter) Group. The Officers' Mess remained in the Priory building and much of the Mess silver still proudly bears the Fighter Command Badge. Bentley Priory also became the Administrative Headquarters for RAF Strike Command (although this function moved to High Wycombe in 1972). It was also proposed that the Officer and Aircrew selection at RAF Biggin Hill should move to the Priory and Stanmore itself closed. All these plans required a large Officers' Mess and in 1974 the Department of the Environment ordered a thorough investigation into the priory building. Their findings were extremely disturbing; the spread of dry-rot in the timbers meant that the only safe parts of the Mess were the kitchens and dining room, and these would only last until March 1975 when they too would have to be closed. From this period dates the large underground nuclear hardened bunker to the East of the Mansion, built in 1982Battle of Britain Bentley Priory Trust which replaced the previous World War II bunker on the site, which had been continually upgraded from 1940 up to the 1980s. The decision that the Mess would have to close came at a particularly bad time as, some four months earlier, the Royal Air Force Association had been given permission to hold a Fighter Command Commemorative Ball at the Priory and invitations had already been sent out. Given the serious concern about the integrity of the building's structure it was decided to use marquees for the majority of the function; the lower floors were temporarily strengthened. The ball was of course, a resounding success and caused HM the Queen Mother, who has a long association with the Mess, to be particularly interested in the Priory's future. It was from that night that the campaign to save the Priory really began and it was eventually decided that the Priory should be renovated at a cost of approximately ¬£1 million. Most of the paintings and other valuables were taken to RAF Quedgeley for safe storage, and Cubitts, sub-contractors of the Department of the Environment, started work. =Fire= On the evening of 21 June 1979 at 8:27 pm, smoke was seen coming from the Priory. The London Fire Brigade fortunately arrived in good time and tried to fight the fire. Several teams went inside and tried to get the fire under control. Unfortunately, the electricity had not been switched off and as the firemen advanced to the seat of the fire, they were surrounded by great sparks and had to beat a hasty retreat. The firemen spent the next morning damping down the smouldering remains and looking for the cause. It was quickly established that the fire was an accident and not arson. The fire devastated most of the main staircase, but luckily jumped over the Adelaide Room, by-passing the Rotunda, but destroying the rooms down the other side, including the Dowding Room. Initially, this fire was thought to be the final tragedy. However, after legal ramifications were resolved, Cubitts's insurance covered most of the cost of rebuilding and renovations went ahead at a cost of approximately ¬£3.1 million. Despite two fires and substantial Victorian rebuilding of the house, externally, Soane's part in the design is still evident on the garden side and in the house. The five pilasters (columns) set against the original Duberley house still survive, though they have lost most of their entablature (the ornate area above the column) and carry instead a steeply projecting slate roof. Although several of the rooms were built during the 18th century, alterations to most of them have led to the loss of their original character. Only the entrance hall remains virtually intact with its eight 'Roman Doric' columns supporting a shallow vaulted ceiling. The 1979 fire peeled off the whitewash paint cover of the ceiling revealing the intricate painted pattern (as designed by Sloane). Although the finances did not allow this pattern to be restored at the time, it has since been returned to its former glory by Mess members. A second small fire was started while restoration was under way in 1980 cause of the fire was work lights left on over night. =Closure= RAF Bentley Priory was latterly home to the Defence Aviation Safety Centre, Air Historical Branch (AHB) and RAF Ceremonial. As there was no enduring operational use for RAF Bentley Priory, however, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) released the site as part of its Greater London estate consolidation project, Project MoDEL (Ministry of Defence Estates London). This despite the fact there was a significant lack of military accommodation in the London Area. Project MoDEL is making a major contribution to the consolidation of the Defence Estate in Greater London through the delivery of three key outputs: the development of an integrated 'core site' at RAF Northolt; the re-location of the London-based units; and the disposal of surplus sites. Accordingly, DASC, AHB and RAF Ceremonial relocated to RAF Northolt in 2008 following the completion of their new accommodation. A total of ¬£180 million GBP ($295 million US in 2008) of the ¬£300 million GBP released from Project MoDEL has been re-invested back into RAF Northolt. A final dinner was held for the Battle of Britain veterans in July 2007 to celebrate the role of the building and those who worked in it in preventing Hitler's planned air invasion of Britain in 1940. The sunset ceremony was carried out by the Queen's Colour Squadron and there was a flypast by the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight and a Eurofighter Typhoon. The salute was taken by the Station Commander Squadron Leader Phil Reid, the Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Sir Glenn Torpy and Air Commodore (Ret) Pete Brothers, Chairman of the Battle of Britain Fighter Association. The final closure Sunset ceremony took place on 30 May 2008, when the RAF ensign was lowered at RAF Bentley Priory for the last time. The station officially closed the following day, and all remaining lodger units moved to RAF Northolt. Bentley Priory Museum The former Bentley Priory Officers' Mess, which became the Bentley Priory Museum in September 2013, includes the original office of Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding (later Lord Dowding), Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain, preserved with its original furniture. Other Battle of Britain historic artefacts are kept in the Museum, including one of the few remaining Battle of Britain Lace Panels. Other items in the Museum include a number of \\"trophies\\" taken by the Royal Air Force from the Luftwaffe at the end of World War II, including an eagle statue and a bust of Hermann G√∂ring. The Officers' Mess was also notable for the number of Royal Portraits hanging in the building; there were two of HM The Queen, one in the Dining Room as a young woman and a second that hung in the Ladies' Room that was commissioned and paid for by the Royal Observer Corps to mark their 50th Jubilee Year, painted at Bentley Priory depicting Her Majesty in her ROC Commandant in Chief regalia and with a background of the Italian Gardens. There was also a portrait of His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh (dressed in a flying suit, hanging in the Dining Room on the wall facing the Queen), one of George VI (in RAF No 1 uniform wearing a 'chip bag' and wings, which hangs in the Abercorn Bar) and one of The Queen Mother (gifted to the Mess by the Queen Mother after she paid for refurbishment following the fire). The portrait of The Queen Mother hung in the rotunda and was surrounded by portraits and sketches of many Battle of Britain Pilots. These portraits have now all been preserved in the Museum. Redevelopment Following the closure of the RAF station the site was handed over to Defence Estates, who in turn passed it to the prime plus contractor for Project MoDEL, VSM Estates, a company formed by developers Vinci PLC and St. Modwen Properties PLC, who are responsible for developing proposals and the subsequent disposal of the site to developers who will realise the scheme. Under Supplementary planning guidance agreed in 2007 by London Borough of Harrow the site will include a museum open to the public in the main rooms of the house, recording and interpreting the history of the site and in particular the Battle of Britain and Cold War heritage. The plans were put on hold in 2009 as a result of the economic climate in Britain, although in 2010 it was agreed that the museum would go ahead and be run by the Bentley Priory Battle of Britain Trust, with support from the charity The Prince's Regeneration Trust. The latest plans for the site include the conversion of the grade II* listed mansion into luxury flats, above the museum. The restoration and classical style development for the site is being designed by Nigel Anderson of ADAM Architecture. On 12 September 2013, the Bentley Priory Museum was officially opened by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall. The Cold War bunker was surveyed by English Heritage, who concluded there were other examples of similar bunkers across the country in better condition. In March 2010 the bunker was filled in, leaving only the exterior doors and walls. The RAF Bentley Priory Battle of Britain Trust supported VSM Estates in the decision to fill in the bunker on the grounds of maintenance costs. The bunker had replaced the Second World War bunker in the 1980s.

The Hamburg cell () or Hamburg terror cell () was, according to U.S. and German intelligence agencies, a group of radical Islamists based in Hamburg, Germany, that included students who eventually came to be key operatives in the 9/11 attacks. Important members included Mohamed Atta, who led the four hijacking teams in 2001 and piloted American Airlines Flight 11; Ramzi bin al-Shibh, who conspired with the other three members but was unable to enter the United States; Marwan al-Shehhi, who piloted United Airlines Flight 175; and Ziad Jarrah, who piloted United Airlines Flight 93 and failed to hit a target in Washington, D.C. (claimed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to have been the Capitol). Other members included Said Bahaji, Zakariya Essabar, Mounir el-Motassadeq, and Abdelghani Mzoudi. Background On November 1, 1998, future-hijackers Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, and Ramzi bin al-Shibh moved into an apartment (two bedrooms, one living room, one kitchen) together on Marienstra√üe. Here they formed the secretive Hamburg cell, which also included other minor participants in the 9/11 plot. They met together three or four times a week to discuss their anti-American and anti-Israeli views, and to decide how best to fight for their cause. As late as 1999, the four core members of the group had intended to wage jihad in Chechnya, where Islamic jihadists were then and are now rebelling against the parent country of Russia. The 9/11 Commission Report notes in Chapter 5 that \\"according to bin al-Shibh [who is now in U.S. custody], a chance meeting on a train in Germany caused the group to travel to Afghanistan instead. An individual named Khalid al Masri (or Khalid al-Masri) approached bin al-Shibh and Shehhi (because they were Arabs with beards, bin al-Shibh thinks) and struck up a conversation about jihad in Chechnya. When they later called Masri and expressed interest in going to Chechnya, he told them to contact Abu Musab in Duisburg, Germany. Abu Musab turned out to be Mohamedou Ould Slahi, a significant al-Qaeda operative who, even then, was well known to U.S. and German intelligence, though neither government apparently knew he was operating in Germany in late 1999.\\" Bin al-Shibh, Shehhi and Jarrah visited Slahi in Duisburg, where he convinced them that it would be best to train in Afghanistan first, because further experience would be useful, and anyway it was difficult at that time to get into Chechnya. Slahi instructed them to travel to Karachi, Pakistan, then to the Taliban office in Quetta, Pakistan, where they were to contact a man named Umar al Masri. Atta and Jarrah left Hamburg during the last week of November 1999. Shehhi left by himself around the same time; bin al-Shibh followed two weeks later. \\"Umar al Masri\\" turned out to be a nonexistent person. The name was a code word that instructed members of the Taliban office to escort the men to Kandahar, Afghanistan, where they were convinced to join the al-Qaeda network and wage jihad against America. They met with Osama bin Laden himself and swore their loyalty to him. Mohamed Atta was chosen by Bin Laden as the leader of the group that would attack America; Atta would contact Bin Laden several more times before the attacks. The men then returned to Germany to enroll in flight training school, and later moved on to flight training schools in the United States at the recommendation of one of their instructors based in Germany. The members of the Hamburg Cell were a boon to the 9/11 plot, which Khalid Shaikh Mohammed had proposed to Bin Laden in 1996. The Hamburg students were fluent in English, educated, accustomed to the Western lifestyle, radically Islamic, and capable of learning to pilot aircraft. \\"Bin Laden and Mohammed Atef wasted no time in assigning the Hamburg group to the most ambitious operation yet planned by al-Qaeda,\\" the 9/11 Commission Report says. Many al-Qaeda members lived in the Hamburg apartment at various times. In all, 29 men listed the apartment as their home address while Mohamed Atta's name was on the lease. Reportedly, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed visited the apartment repeatedly. German intelligence monitored the apartment, but did not find any evidence against the residents. Both the United States' Central Intelligence Agency and German Intelligence have received criticism for failing to share information on these and other al-Qaida members. Hamburg Cell film The film Hamburg Cell is a docudrama on the planning and execution of the attacks. A co-production between Channel 4 in the UK and CBC in Canada, it was shown in the UK during September 2004, amid criticism that this was too close to the anniversary of the attack. Using computer-generated imagery, the film's producers were able to show the twin towers of the World Trade Center, before the attack, in the background. Ziad Jarrah is featured calling his girlfriend, Aysel Seng√ºn, from a public telephone at the airport, repeating the words 'I love you' over and over.

In Ford sales literature, it was referred to as the EAO or OHC engine and because it was designed to the metric system, it was sometimes called the \\"metric engine\\". The internal Ford codename for the unit was the T88-series engine. European Ford service literature refers to it as the Taunus In-Line engine (hence the TL codenames). In North America it was known as the Lima In-Line (LL), or simply the Lima engine. It was used in many European Ford cars and was exported to the United States to be used in the Ford Pinto, a successful subcompact car of the 1970s, hence the name which is used most often for the unit. In Britain, it is commonly used in many kit cars and hot rods, especially in the 2-litre size. Pinto OHC (TL) In Europe, the Pinto OHC was introduced in 1970 to replace the Essex V4 used in the Corsair as that range was subsumed into the Mk3 Cortina and Taunus V4 for the German Fords range (mainly the new Taunus TC). It was the first Ford engine to feature a belt-driven overhead camshaft (thus the name). Applications: * Ford Taunus * Ford Escort Mk1 RS2000 * Ford Escort Mk2 RS2000, Mexico * Ford Cortina * Ford Capri * Ford Sierra * Ford Granada * Ford Scorpio * Ford Transit van * TVR Tasmin 200 The Pinto engine was available in five displacements: , earlier , later , and the . Later . Due to emission requirements, it was phased out towards the end of the 1980s to be replaced by the CVH engine and DOHC engine, the latter being (contrary to popular belief) a completely new design and not a twin-cam development of the Pinto unit. The only DOHC direct derivative of Pinto engine is the Cosworth YB 16-valve engine, powering Ford Sierra and Ford Escort RS Cosworth variants. The final Pinto engines used in Ford of Europe production vehicles were the litre versions used in the Sierra until 1991, and the last units were used in the Transit until 1994. =1.3 (TL13)= The smallest member of the family was the which had a bore and stroke. It was produced in two compression ratio versions: * TL13L ‚Äì the low compression (LC) variant, which developed / depending on carburetor model, had a compression ratio of 8.0:1 and the engine codes started with 'JA' * TL13H ‚Äî the high compression (HC) variant, which developed / depending on carburetor model had a compression ratio of 9.0:1 and the engine codes started with 'JC' The fuel was supplied by the Motorcraft single-barrel (1V) carburettor in the early models (until April 1979), and Motorcraft VV (\\"variable venturi\\") carburetor for the vehicles built after April 1979. Applications: * 1970‚Äì1982 Ford Taunus (engine codes JAA/JCA, JAC/JCC, JAR/JCR) * 1972‚Äì1974 Ford Capri (engine code JCE) * 1982‚Äì1984 Ford Sierra (engine code JCT) = 1.6 (TL16)= Early low compression variant (TL16L) Initially, the had a bore of and shared the crankshaft with the 1.3 L model with a stroke of giving the displacement of . The TL16L had a compression ratio of 8.2:1 and developed of power and of torque depending on the carburettor and application. As the 1.3 L model, it used the Motorcraft 1V and, later, the Motorcraft VV carburetors. The engine code of the low compression variant started with 'LA'. Applications: * 1970‚Äì1982 Ford Taunus / Ford Cortina (engine codes LAA, LAD, LAR) * 1979‚Äì1986 Ford Transit (engine code LAT) * 1975‚Äì1985 Ford Capri (engine codes LAC, LAN) Early high compression variant (TL16H) The HC version of the early had the same bore and stroke as the LC version, but the compression ratio was higher (9.2:1), allowing it to produce of power and of torque. It used the same carburetor models as the low compression version (Motorcraft 1V and Motorcraft VV). Applications: * 1970‚Äì1982 Ford Taunus / Ford Cortina (engine codes LCA, LCJ, LCR) * 1982‚Äì1984 Ford Sierra (engine codes LCT, LCS) * 1975‚Äì1985 Ford Capri (engine codes LCE, LCN) * 1981‚Äì1985 Ford Granada (engine code LCK) * 1983‚Äì1984 Anadol A8-16 SL Increased performance (GT) variant (TL16G) From the beginning of the production run, the had a special, 'sporty' version which featured: * modified cylinder head (larger inlet valves and 2.0 L camshaft with higher valve lifts) * DGAV 32/36 Weber carburetor * tubular exhaust manifold With such an improvement package, the engine produced of power and of torque. Applications: * 1970‚Äì1973 Ford Taunus GT (engine code LEA) * 1970‚Äì1976 Ford Taunus GXL (engine code LEA) 1970-1976 Ford Cortina GT (engine code LEA) * 1970‚Äì1976 Ford Cortina GXL (engine code LEA) * 1976‚Äì1982 Ford Taunus / Ford Cortina S / GLS / Ghia S (engine codes LEC, LEE) * 1975‚Äì1978 Ford Escort Mexico * 1972‚Äì1976 Ford Capri GT (engine codes LEC, LEE) Late variant (TL16E) At the beginning of 1984, Ford Pinto engine displacement range switched from 1.3/1.6/2.0 to 1.6/1.8/2.0. The newly introduced 1.8 L engine used the 2.0 L crankshaft, so to uniform engine parts for the whole range after dropping the 1.3 L ‚Äî the 1.6 L was redesigned to also take the 2.0 L crankshaft which had a stroke. This of course led to bringing the bore down to to keep the displacement within range ‚Äî it was now . The TL16E became now the only available 1.6 L engine of the Pinto range. Although the compression ratio was raised to 9.5:1, the power figures did not differ much from the earlier TL16H version ‚Äî the engine developed of power and of torque. This engine is sometimes referred to as 1.6 E-Max engine. Applications: * 1984‚Äì1989 Ford Sierra (engine codes LSE, LSD) =1.8 (TL18H)= The Pinto engine was introduced in 1984 as a replacement for the \\"old\\" 1.6 L. The engine had an bore and stroke giving the displacement of . Output was of power and . Fuel was supplied by the Pierburg 2E3 28/32 carburetor.

Due to its robustness and high tuning potential, it was often used as an aftermarket engine upgrade or base for building race and rally engines ‚Äî not exclusively in Ford cars. The engine has bore of and stroke giving the displacement of . It was manufactured in several variants: Low compression variant (TL20L) Three completely different LC variants of the 2.0 L were produced. One was used on the 1970‚Äì1982 Ford Taunus export version to Sweden ‚Äî fitted with the Weber DGAV 32/32 carburetor and compression ratio lowered to 8.2:1 to meet the rigorous emission specifications; it delivered of power and of torque. The second one was used on 1978‚Äì1991 Ford Transits and P100 models. With modified induction and Motorcraft 1V carburetor, it produced of power and of torque available at only 2800 rpm. The compression ratio in this case was also 8.2:1. The Transits also used the third variant called the \\"Economy\\" engine. The power figure of this one was even lower ‚Äî it developed only . Applications: * 1970‚Äì1982 Ford Taunus Sweden export version (engine code NA) * 1978‚Äì1994 Ford Transit (engine codes NAT, NAV, NAW, NAX, NBA) * 1988‚Äì1993 Ford P100 (engine code NAE) * 1977‚Äì1986 Ford Transit \\"Economy\\" version (engine code NUT) Standard (high compression) variant (TL20H) Although Ford marked its standard 2.0 L engine as HC, it actually uses engine codes meant for the 'increased performance variant' engines (coding starting with 'NE'), these have a compression ratio of to 9.2:1. This engine used different carburettor models across the years: * Weber DGAV 32/36 - on all cars up to 1987 * Weber DFTH 30/34 - from 1987 until the end of production run (1989) * Weber DFAV 32/36 - on engines exported to USA The engine produced of power and of torque, though a few models with a higher output were produced (for example an version used in 1976 Ford Escort RS2000). Applications: * 1973‚Äì1980 Ford Escort RS2000 (engine codes NEA, NE) * 1974‚Äì1982 Ford Taunus / Ford Cortina (engine codes NEG, NER) * 1975‚Äì1985 Ford Capri (engine codes NEE, NEN) * 1973‚Äì1984 Ford Granada (engine codes NEB, NEH, NEK) * 1983‚Äì1989 Ford Sierra (engine codes NES, NET, NEJ, NE5) * 1985‚Äì1989 Ford Granada and Ford Scorpio (engine code NEL, NER, NE4) * 1971‚Äì1974 Ford Pinto Injection variant (TL20EFI) The injected 2.0 L used the Ford EEC-IV engine control system which brought the output up to of power and http://www.ultimatespecs.com/car- specs/Ford/7281/Ford-Scorpio-I-20i.html of torque, although much of this increased performance can be attributed to the improved design of the EFI variants cylinder head. As the EEC-IV installation on most of those engines contains some Bosch parts that are easily visible in the engine compartment (air flow meter of the electromechanical \\"flap\\" type, injectors, fuel pressure regulator etc.), it is often - but falsely believed that they are fitted with the Bosch L-Jetronic injection system. Some of the TL20EFI engines have closed-loop lambda control, while others are lacking that feature.

The power output was . Applications: * 1985‚Äì1992 Ford Transit (engine code N6T) Cosworth YB (CH20EFI) In the beginning of the 1980s, Cosworth developed a 16-valve performance head conversion for the Pinto engine. This was seen by a Ford executive who asked Cosworth to develop it with a turbo for use in the new Ford Sierra RS Cosworth. The engine is therefore based on a modified Pinto block topped with the Cosworth-developed alloy head and Garrett turbo. Lima OHC (LL) =2.0= The 2.0 litre version was a narrower-bore version of the original 2.3 liter \\"Lima\\" four. Bore and stroke are , respectively, for an overall displacement of . This engine was installed in the 1983-1988 Ford Rangers and in some Argentinian Ford Taunuses. ;Applications: * Ford Ranger (North America) * Ford Taunus Argentina models =2.3 (LL23)= The Ford Pinto used the OHC version, a unit introduced in 1974 which has a bore and stroke. This version lasted until 1997 in various guises. The earliest units produced and . This engine has also been known as the Lima engine, after the Lima Engine plant in Lima, Ohio, where it was first manufactured (it was also manufactured in Brazil starting in 1974). In 1979-80, a draw-through, non intercooled turbo version was produced for Mustang Cobras and some Capris. Lack of dealership and owner training resulted in many stuck turbochargers and other maintenance problems. They were limited to of boost, though Ford Motorsport sold a wastegate with an adjustable rod which allowed an increase up to . It was used in this carbureted form in a number of passenger cars, from the Fairmont Futura Turbo to the 1979 Indy Pace Car edition Mustang. In 1983, Ford introduced a fuel-injected version of the turbocharged engine, which was used in the Thunderbird Turbo Coupe and the Turbo GT trim of the Mustang. In 1984, the Mustang SVO was introduced with an intercooler, initially producing and later increased to in 1985¬Ω. After the SVO was discontinued, the intercooler was added to the Turbo Coupe. Output for this turbo/intercooled version was and for the 1987-88 models with the five- speed (T-5) manual transmission. In addition to the 1983-1984 Mustang Turbo GT and 1983-1986 Turbo Coupe, the nonintercooled version of the engine was also used in the 1985-89 Merkur XR4Ti and 1984-1986 Mercury Cougar XR7, producing and . A dual-spark version (with two spark plugs per cylinder, distributor- less ignition, and reduced main bearing sizes) was introduced in the 1989 Ford Ranger and 1991 Ford Mustang.

He served as Governor of Tennessee from 1921 to 1923, one of three Republicans to hold the position from the end of Reconstruction to the latter half of the 20th century. He also served three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, from 1889 to 1895. In 1886, Taylor ran for governor against his younger brother, Democrat Robert Love Taylor (1850‚Äì1912), in a memorable campaign known as the \\"War of the Roses.\\" Canvassing the state together, the brothers often engaged in light-hearted banter and played fiddles, in contrast to previous gubernatorial campaigns, which involved fierce debates.Paul Deresco Augsburg, Bob and Alf Taylor: Their Lives and Lectures (Morristown, Tenn.: Morristown Book Company, 1925). Taylor ran for governor again in 1910, but lost his party's nomination to Ben W. Hooper. He was victorious in 1920 due in large part to divisions within the Democratic Party over taxes and women's suffrage.Phillip Langsdon, Tennessee: A Political History (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 300‚Äì303. Early life Taylor was born in the Happy Valley community of Carter County, Tennessee, the second son of Nathaniel Green Taylor, a congressman, Methodist minister, and poet, and Emaline Haynes Taylor, an accomplished pianist. Nathaniel Taylor was a Whig (many of whom later became Republicans), while his wife's family, among them her brother, Landon Carter Haynes, were Democrats. Alfred followed his father into the Republican Party, while his brother, Robert, followed their mother's family into the Democratic Party. Taylor attended Duffield Academy in Elizabethton, Tennessee and Buffalo Institute (modern Milligan College) in Carter County, Tennessee. Following the outbreak of the Civil War, Nathaniel Taylor supported the Union, and the Taylors were forced to move to the North. During this period, Alfred attended Pennington Seminary in Pennington, New Jersey. In 1867, Taylor accompanied his father, then Commissioner of Indian Affairs under President Andrew Johnson, to join the Indian Peace Commission in Kansas in an effort to end the Plains Wars. The commission negotiated the Medicine Lodge Treaty with the southern Plains Indians, bringing about their removal to reservations in Indian Territory. In 1924, Taylor wrote an account of this trip and published it in the Chronicles of Oklahoma.A.A. Taylor, \\"MEDICINE LODGE PEACE COUNCIL\\" , Chronicles of Oklahoma, Volume 2, No. 2, June 1924, accessed 21 January 2011 After his study of law, Taylor was admitted to the bar in 1870 and commenced practice in Jonesborough, Tennessee.Finding Aid for Governor Alfred A. Taylor Papers , Tennessee State Library and Archives, 1968. Retrieved: 6 December 2012. Early political career Taylor was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1874, and served one term. Among his initiatives was the creation of Unicoi County in 1875. He would later refer to the county as, \\"my baby.\\" Taylor served as an elector for Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876, and would serve as an elector in the three subsequent presidential campaigns.John Allison, Notable Men of Tennessee (Southern Historical Association, 1905), pp. 326‚Äì327. Taylor, c. 1886 In 1878, Taylor sought his party's nomination for the 1st district congressional seat held by Augustus Pettibone. Although Taylor had popular support, Pettibone managed to win the nomination at the party's convention, angering Taylor's supporters. Taylor's brother, Robert (a Democrat), ran against Pettibone in the general election, and with the support of both Democrats and his brother's disgruntled supporters, captured the seat. He was defeated for reelection by Pettibone after just one term, however. In Tennessee's 1886 gubernatorial race, Republicans, hoping to exploit divisions within the Democratic Party, nominated Alfred Taylor as their candidate. Democrats nominated his brother, Robert, believing him the best person to unite the party and counter Alfred's popular appeal. The brothers canvassed the state together, drawing large crowds, and engaging in light-hearted political debate and playing fiddles while the crowd danced. At a stop in Madisonville, Robert stated that he and Alfred were both roses, though he was a white rose while Alfred was a red rose. When their respective supporters wore white and red roses, the contest became known as the \\"War of the Roses\\" (the name also hearkened to the 15th- century English conflict). On election day, Robert won by about 16,000 votes. The 1886 campaign boosted Alfred Taylor's popularity. In 1888, he successfully ran for the 1st district congressional seat, defeating Democrat David P. Wilcox by 7,000 votes.Our Campaigns ‚Äì TN District 01, 1888. Retrieved: 6 December 2012. He was reelected in 1890, edging Roderick R. Butler (who ran as an independent) by less than a thousand votes.Our Campaigns ‚Äì TN District 01, 1890. Retrieved: 6 December 2012. He was reelected to a third term in 1892. During his congressional tenure, Taylor supported the McKinley Tariff, a protectionist measure that raised tariffs on imports by 50%. He also supported the Lodge Bill, which would have provided protections for black voters in the South. After leaving Congress, Taylor joined his brother, Robert, on the lecture circuit. They cowrote and presented a popular lecture entitled \\"Yankee Doodle and Dixie.\\" The tour was a major financial success, netting the brothers tens of thousands of dollars. In 1906, Taylor ran as an independent for the 1st district seat against state Republican Party boss, Walter P. Brownlow, but was defeated by a substantial margin. In 1910, Taylor sought the Republican nomination for governor, but was defeated by Ben W. Hooper. Hooper then proceeded to defeat Alfred's brother, Robert, in the general election. Governor Taylor's foxhound, \\"Old Limber\\" In 1920, the 71-year-old Taylor was nominated by Republicans for governor. His opponent was the Democratic incumbent, Albert H. Roberts, who had alienated a significant portion of his party by enacting unpopular tax reforms and helping ratify the 19th Amendment (which gave women the right to vote). On the campaign trail, Taylor travelled with a four-piece quartet (consisting of three of his sons and their friend), and told the story of \\"Old Limber,\\" a foxhound who, in spite of his old age, could still outrun the pack. As he also supported the 19th Amendment, he campaigned primarily against Roberts' tax reforms. On election day, he defeated Roberts 229,143 votes to 185,890. It was the state's first gubernatorial election in which women could vote. Following his inauguration, Taylor focused on what he termed the \\"Big Four\\" issues: tax reform, rural school reform, highways, and the economy. Although most of his agenda was blocked by the state legislature (which was controlled by Democrats), he created the position of tax commissioner, obtained funding for a state historical commission, and resolved several labor disputes. He also helped convince the federal government to convert a nitrate plant built for World War I at Wilson Dam in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, into an electrical power plant for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Tennessee Valley. In 1922, the Democratic Party nominated former party leader Austin Peay to oppose Taylor for governor. Peay lacked the charisma of Taylor, and resorted to delivering basic stump speeches, in contrast to Taylor's entertaining rallies. Peay had the support of entrepreneur Clarence Saunders (the founder of Piggly Wiggly), and with the Democratic Party once again unified, he defeated Taylor on election day, 141,002 votes to 102,586. Later life Following his defeat in the 1922 governor's race, Taylor returned to his farm near Johnson City, Tennessee. He died on November 25, 1931, and was buried in the city's Monte Vista Cemetery. Family Taylor's great-grandfather, General Nathaniel Taylor (1771‚Äì1816), served during the War of 1812. Another great-grandfather, Landon Carter (1760‚Äì1800), was a Revolutionary War veteran for whom Carter County was named.W. Calvin Dickinson, \\"Landon Carter,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture. Retrieved: 6 February 2014. Taylor's uncle, Landon Carter Haynes, was a leading East Tennessee Democrat during the Civil War, and served in the Confederate Senate. Taylor was a cousin of Nathaniel Edwin Harris, who served as Governor of Georgia from 1915 to 1917. Taylor married Jennie Anderson in 1881, and they had ten children together. Their son, Robert Love Taylor (1899‚Äì1987), named for Alfred's brother, became a United States federal judge.Clinton J.

Selection and criteria The BBC produced 70 of the 100 programmes on the list. Granada Television produced 7 of the 100 programmes on list‚Äîthe largest by a commercial broadcaster. The British Film Institute television programme poll was conducted in the year 2000, and its results are reflected in the list that appears in a following section. Initially, a 'big list' of 650 programmes was drawn up by BFI personnel. Television programmes no longer extant in the archives were excluded from consideration. The provisional list was split into six categories: Single Dramas, Drama Series and Serials, Comedy and Variety, Factual, Children's/Youth, and Lifestyle & Light Entertainment. Some programmes were represented in the list by an entire series; however, for some series‚Äîe.g., the anthology The Wednesday Play and the current affairs programme This Week‚Äîindividual episodes were listed. News stories were mostly excluded, with exceptions such as the coverage of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales (on the basis that it would be impossible to determine whether it was the coverage or the news itself that made them important). Sport was excluded for similar reasons, and also because many events such as the 1966 World Cup, while important to those in England, would not necessarily matter to those in other areas of the United Kingdom. The provisional list of 650 was then distributed to 1,600 television industry professionals in the UK, who were each given 30 votes. Each voter was required to cast a minimum of three votes in every category. The judges were also asked to name their top overseas programme (where the U.S. sitcom, Frasier, was chosen).  Full list  The following are the results of the poll, as reported by the BFI and other sources. Because the list reports decisions made in the year 2000, programmes and series are presented as they were perceived in that year; as such, ones not yet having concluded by the year 2000 are presented as having an open- ended date span in the \\"Year(s)\\" column, even if they have subsequently ended. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" !

It occupies a Grade I listed building. The school has been fully co- educational since 1999. The college was founded in 1593 by Father Robert Persons SJ at St Omer, at a time when penal laws prohibited Catholic education in England. After moving to Bruges in 1762 and Li√®ge in 1773, the college moved to Stonyhurst in 1794. It provides boarding and day education to approximately 450 boys and girls aged 13‚Äì18. On an adjacent site, its preparatory school, St Mary's Hall, provides education for boys and girls aged 3‚Äì13. The school combines an academic curriculum with extra-curricular pursuits. Roman Catholicism plays a central role in college life, with emphasis on both prayer and service, according to the Jesuit philosophy. The school's alumni include three Saints, twelve Beati, seven archbishops, seven Victoria Cross winners, a Peruvian president, a Bolivian president, a New Zealand prime minister, a signatory of the American Declaration of Independence and several writers, sportsmen, and politicians. History =Stonyhurst Hall= The earliest deed concerning the \\"Stanihurst\\" is held in the college's Arundell Library; it dates from approximately 1200. In 1372, a licence was granted to John de Bayley for an oratory on the site. His descendants, the Shireburn family, completed the oldest portion of the extant buildings. Richard Shireburn began building the hall, which was enlarged by his grandson Nicholas who also constructed the ponds, avenue and gardens. Following his death, the estate passed to his wife and then to their sole heir, Mary, the Duchess of Norfolk. In 1754, it was inherited by her cousin Thomas Weld (of Lulworth). A former pupil of the English Jesuit Colleges of St Omer, Bruges and Li√®ge, he donated the buildings, with of land, in 1794 to the Society of Jesus for the purpose of settling them and their evacuated charges from Northern France and the Austrian Netherlands. =The college= Fr Robert Persons SJ Map of the Spanish Netherlands in 1590 The story of the school starts at St Omer in what was then the Spanish Netherlands in 1593, where a college, under the Royal Patronage of Philip II of Spain, was founded by Fr Robert Persons SJ for English boys unable to receive a Catholic education in Elizabethan England. As such it was one of several expatriate English schools operating on the European mainland. In 1762, the Jesuits were forced to flee and re-established their school at Bruges. The school was moved in 1773 to Li√®ge, where it operated for two decades before moving to Stonyhurst on 29 August 1794. Schooling resumed on 22 October that year. The college flourished during the 19th century: the Society of Jesus was re-established in Britain at Stonyhurst in 1803, and over the century, student numbers rose from the original twelve migrants from Li√®ge. By the turn of the following century, it had become England's largest Catholic college. Stonyhurst Hall underwent extensive alterations and additions to accommodate these numbers; the Old South Front was constructed in 1810, only to be demolished and replaced with much grander buildings in the 1880s. A seminary was constructed on the estate, and an observatory and meteorological station erected in the gardens. The 20th century saw the gradual hiring of a mostly lay staff, as the number of Jesuits declined. The seminary at St Mary's Hall was closed, and the school discontinued its education of university-aged philosophers. With the closure of Beaumont College in 1967 and the transfer away from the Society of Jesus of Mount St Mary's College, Spinkhill, Derbyshire, in 2006, Stonyhurst became the sole Jesuit public school in England. Since the Second World War, the buildings have been refurbished or developed. Additions include new science buildings in the 1950s and 1960s, a new boarding wing in the 1960s, a new swimming pool in the 1980s and Weld House in 2010. The school became fully co- educational in 1999. Hodder Place, St Mary's Hall and Hodder House The original preparatory school to Stonyhurst, Hodder Place, came into the hands of the Jesuits as part of the estate donated by alumnus Thomas Weld. Originally used as a novitiate, it became a preparatory school to the college in 1807. St Mary's Hall, on an adjoining site to Stonyhurst, was built as a Jesuit seminary in 1828 (extended in the 1850s) and functioned until 1926, when the seminarians moved to Heythrop Hall. The poet Gerard Manley Hopkins, and John Tolkien, son of J. R. R. Tolkien, trained as priests there. During World War II, the English College left Benito Mussolini's Italy and occupied the hall. After their return to Rome, St Mary's Hall opened as a middle school in 1946. At the same time, Hodder Place continued to educate those aged eight to eleven, until its closure and conversion into flats in 1970. Hodder Place pupils moved up to St Mary's Hall to form Hodder Playroom. As successor to Hodder Place, St Mary's Hall has a claim to being the oldest surviving preparatory school in Britain. In 2004, the old gymnasium at St Mary's Hall was converted into new nursery and infant facilities named Hodder House, for those aged three to seven. Religious life The Lady Statue at the top of the Avenue, erected in 1882 The college is Roman Catholic and has had a significant place in English Catholic history for many centuries (including controversial events such as the Popish Plot and Gunpowder Plot conspiracies). It was founded initially to educate English Catholics on the continent in the hope that, through them, Roman Catholicism might be restored in England. Finally, the school settled in England in 1794 and the Society of Jesus was officially re-established in Britain in 1803. Stonyhurst remained the headquarters of the English Province until the middle of the century; by 1851, a third of the Province's Jesuits were based there. Until the 1920s, Jesuit priests were trained on site in what is today the preparatory school. There was a drop in vocations after World War I and the seminary was closed. The number of Jesuits teaching at Stonyhurst fell to a third of the staff within a decade. Since then, the Jesuit presence has been in decline, but the school continues to place Roman Catholicism and Jesuit philosophy at its core under the guidance of a Jesuit-led chaplaincy team and the involvement of the Jesuits in its governance. =Chapels= The school has one main church, St Peter's, and five chapels: the Boys' Chapel, the Chapel of the Angels, the Sodality Chapel, the St Francis Chapel and the St Ignatius Chapel. The last two are both within the towers of St Peter's Church, and are not normally used by pupils. The Sodality Chapel is the home of the relics of the 3rd-century Roman convert St Gordianus. The Jesuits brought his remains from the College of St Omer and held them beneath the altar since 1859. His bones were temporarily removed in 2006 while the chapel underwent restoration, but they have since been returned. The chapel is again used by the re-established Sodality. Adjacent to the Old Infirmary is the Rosary Garden, a place for spiritual contemplation, at the centre of which is a stone statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary. St Peter's Church underwent extensive repair and refurbishment in 2010‚Äì11. Most of the Victorian stencilling was not restored, although the whitewash was removed from the stencilling above the altar.Refurbishment of St Peter's ; retrieved 30 November 2011 =Traditions= It is a long-standing practice, as with many Jesuit schools around the world, that pupils write A.M.D.G. in the top left hand corner of any piece of work they do. It stands for the Latin phrase Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam which means For the Greater Glory of God. At the end of a piece of work they write L.D.S. in the centre of the page. It stands for Laus Deo Semper which means Praise to God Always.

Robot Battle takes strategy rather than reflexes, accuracy, or timing to succeed. What differentiates one robot from the next is its programming, for which the player is responsible. The game is inspired by the similar game RobotWar. History Robot Battle was created by Brad Schick in 1994 and released to the public for free in the same year, when it reached version 1.2. It went through many versions until seeming to peak at 1.3 in 1995, until in 1997 David Finch released 1.33. The community was at that time held together by the Robot Battle Mailing List (RBML) (which was closed in February 2004 when the Robot Battle Registry, an Internet forum, opened), where tournaments were held, new players could be helped and complicated coding questions could be posed and answered. Early in 2001 Brad began work on Robot Battle 1.4, which promised to be a massive upgrade. The RBML was alive with ideas, suggestions and offers to help, which resulted in the Robot Battle that new players will know, including new features such as: *3D robot graphics (created by Emmanuel Athans ‚Äì http://www.manopolis.com/) *New sound effects (created by Steve Simmons) *New robot coding features **Sliding (originally a bug, but now an important feature for many robots) **XY Coordinates **Radio **Author and Version variables **Arrays **Loops *Team setup options Then in mid-2001 a small company called GarageGames showed an interest in Robot Battle and Brad agreed to sell the game through them. Soon after the first official 1.4 release in December 2002 work began on the Robot Battle Registry, a forum and a way of storing robots so that other people can download them, as well as a way to organise and advertise tournaments. The registry opened in May 2003. Robot Battle has a steadily growing user base with communications over the Registry forums and IRC. At first the Registry was only available for people who had purchased the game but it has since been opened up to anybody. Robot Battle is distributed under the MPL open-source license, allowing anybody to read the code to help design robots or programs which interact with the game somehow. The Robot Battle full version was published for free on November 23, 2004. The Robot The robots in Robot Battle have three separate parts. The body contains the tracks, is a square of size 33x33, and rotates at a speed of 5 degrees per turn. The gun has the ability to shoot energy missiles which will damage robots, and destroy missiles, mines and cookies on collision, and can rotate 10 degrees per turn. The radar has the ability to scan for cookies, mines, robots, and walls, and can rotate 15 degrees per turn. Robot scripting language Robots are programmed in Robot Scripting Language (RSL), and can be created in all text editors such as Notepad. Robots are usually worked on and distributed in .prg format, but some coders choose to scramble their robots and distribute them as .dst files. The scrambling software was created by Brad for Robot Battle 1.3 and later edited by Joseph Fowler (aka Sorcerer) and Mark Duller to give two separate programs both compatible with Robot Battle 1.4. RSL has been said to resemble many programming languages including Basic, C, and JavaScript. Each robot has one or many sections, separated by section names and curly brackets, \\"init\\" being the only required section and where other sections are defined by an event and a priority. The Core section does not need a priority, and contains the details of what the robot will do when it isn't doing anything else. The Ascan, when used, usually has the lowest priority (least important) and takes place whenever the robot is moving. The other events take place when an object is detected with the radar or collided with by the body. The parts of the robot are controlled by commands. The easiest way to make a robot is to look at the ones which come free with the game, Combo, Smart Corner, Events, Fire, Rammer, Shell, Side Liner, Target, Walls II and Zag. These robots demonstrate uses of the simple commands above, as well as some more advanced tactics such as the use of radio and the differences when creating a robot with \\"command blocking\\" turned off.

It was built in the 1220s by Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, (1170‚Äì1232), on his return from the Crusades. In 1237, Henry III took over the ownership of Beeston, and it was kept in good repair until the 16th century, when it was considered to be of no further military use, although it was pressed into service again in 1643, during the English Civil War. The castle was slighted (partly demolished) in 1646, in accordance with Cromwell's destruction order, to prevent its further use as a bastion. During the 18th century, parts of the site were used as a quarry. The castle is a Scheduled Ancient Monument owned and managed by English Heritage. The walls of the outer bailey and the gatehouse and curtain walls of the inner bailey are recorded separately in the National Heritage List for England as designated Grade I listed buildings. A legend states that the royal treasure of Richard II was buried in the castle grounds but many searches have failed to discover the hoard. Location The castle is built on Beeston Crag which is in the southerly part of the Mid Cheshire Ridge, a chain of low sandstone hills that stretches from the River Mersey down to the central region of the Cheshire Plain. The low-lying area between the southerly and the northern ranges of the ridge is known as the Beeston Gap. It was formed by a meltwater channel at the end of the Ice age. The crag, just like the neighbouring Peckforton Hills, is part of a thicker sequence known as the New Red Sandstone. It was formed from easterly dipping layers of Triassic sandstone. The lower slopes are formed from Wilmslow Sandstone Formation while the upper strata are part of the Helsby Sandstone Formation which is around 245 million years old. The hillock is capped by a small outcrop of sandstones assigned to the Tarporley Siltstone Formation (and formerly known as the Keuper Waterstones). Both types of sandstones were once quarried at multiple sites within the castle grounds. Along the eastern margin of the hill is the Peckforton Fault, a major north-south aligned geological fault which downthrows the strata to the east.British Geological Survey England and Wales sheet 109 Chester (solid edition)1986 A low ridge of glacial moraine extending east from the castle lodge is interpreted as marking an ice front during the retreat (or stagnation in situ) of the Irish Sea ice sheet which had invaded Cheshire from the northwest during the last ice age. Prehistory A model showing Beeston's Iron Age settlement Pits dating from the 4th millennium BC indicate the site of Beeston Castle was inhabited or used as a communal gathering place during the Neolithic period. Archaeologists have discovered Neolithic flint arrow heads on the crag, as well as the remains of a Bronze Age community, and of an Iron Age hill fort. The rampart associated with the Bronze Age activity on the crag has been dated to around 1270‚Äì830 BC; seven circular buildings were identified as being either late Bronze Age or early Iron Age in origin. It may have been a specialist metalworking site. History =Construction= Beeston was built for Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester in the early 13th century. The siting of the castle's outer bailey walls was chosen to take advantage of the fortifications remaining from the earlier Iron Age rampart. In medieval documents the castle is described as Castellum de Rupe, the Castle on the Rock. It is one of three major castles built by Ranulph in the 1220s, shortly after his return from the Fifth Crusade. The others are Bolingbroke in Lincolnshire, and Chartley, Staffordshire, both of which share similar architectural features with Beeston; in particular the design of the towers. Ruins of Bolingbroke Castle Ruins of Chartley Castle Buck Brothers, showing Beeston Castle from the south Unlike many other castles of the period, Beeston does not have a keep as its last line of defence. Instead the natural features of the land together with massive walls, strong gatehouses, and carefully positioned towers made the baileys themselves the stronghold. The defences consisted of two parts. Firstly, a rectangular castle on the summit of the hill, with a sheer drop on three sides and a defensive ditch up to deep in places cut into the rock on the fourth side. Secondly, an outer bailey was built on the lower slopes, with a massive gatehouse protected by a wide and deep ditch. The outer bailey was roughly rectangular, with thick walls faced in sandstone and infilled with rubble. The walls, parts of which still remain, contain a number of D-shaped towers, an innovation in English castles at that time. The towers allowed defenders to shoot across the walls as well as forwards, and their open-backed design meant that they would not offer cover to any attackers who gained access to the outer bailey. The inner bailey was situated on the rocky summit at the western end of the crag. To provide the castle's inhabitants with a supply of fresh water two wells were dug into the rock, one of them, at deep, one of the deepest castle wells in England. =Royal castle= Beeston Castle is built on a rocky summit 350 feet (110 m) above the Cheshire Plain. Although most of the defences were in place by the time of Ranulph's death in 1232, there were no living quarters, and neither were there on the death of Ranulph's successor John in 1237. John died without a male heir, allowing King Henry III to take over the Earldom of Cheshire. Henry enlarged Beeston Castle during his wars with Wales, and used it as a prison for his Welsh captives. No attempt was made to equip the castle as a permanent residence with halls and chambers; garrisons were probably housed in wooden structures within the outer bailey. In 1254 Henry gave Beeston, together with other lands in Cheshire, to his son Prince Edward. He also gave the title Earl of Chester to the prince, a title that has been conferred on the heir to the throne of England ever since. Edward succeeded Henry as King of England in 1272, and completed the conquest of Wales. In the middle of the 14th century there are references to men of Cheshire who were made constables of the royal castle. The constable would probably have lived in or near the gatehouse. The habitation was described in an account of the castle in 1593 by Sampson Erdeswicke, which describes, \\"a goodly strong gatehouse, and strong wall with other buildings, which when they flourished were a convenient habitation for any great personage.\\" Beeston was kept in good repair and improved during Edward's reign, and throughout the 14th century. However, by the 16th century, the castle was considered to be of no further use to the English Crown, and in 1602 it was sold to Sir Hugh Beeston (c. 1547‚Äì1626) of Beeston Hall. There have been persistent rumours of a treasure hidden by Richard II somewhere in the castle grounds. Richard is supposed to have hidden part of his personal wealth at Beeston on his journey to Chester in 1399, before boarding a ship to Ireland to suppress a rebellion there. On his return, Richard was deposed by Henry, Duke of Lancaster, the future Henry IV, and his treasure is said to have remained undiscovered. Many searches have been carried out, most of them focusing on the deep well in the inner bailey, but nothing has ever been found. The rumour of hidden treasure may not be well-founded, as Henry IV is recorded as having recovered Richard's gold and jewellery from its various hiding places.  Civil War During the English Civil War many neglected castles were pressed into service. Beeston was seized on 20 February 1643 by Parliamentary forces commanded by Sir William Brereton. The walls were repaired and the motte was cleaned out. During 1643 part of the royal army of Ireland landed at Chester. On 13 December 1643 Captain Thomas Sandford and eight soldiers from that army crept into Beeston at night (possibly aided by treachery) and surprised the castle governor, Captain Thomas Steele, who was so shaken by the event that he surrendered on the promise that he would be allowed to march out of the castle with honours. Steele was tried and shot for his failure to hold the castle. The Royalists survived a siege by parliamentary forces from November 1644 until November 1645, when their lack of food forced them to surrender. The castle was partially demolished in 1646, to prevent its further use as a stronghold. Later history The 19th-century gatehouse Quarrying was carried out in the castle grounds during the 18th century, and the gatehouse leading into the outer bailey was demolished to build a track for the stones to be removed from the site. In 1840 the castle was purchased by John Tollemache, 1st Baron Tollemache, at that time the largest landowner in Cheshire, as part of a larger estate. In the mid-19th century the castle was the site of an annual two-day fete, raising money for local widows and orphans and attracting more than 3,000 visitors a day. Preservation The castle is owned by English Heritage, and although in ruins, enough of the walls and towers are still in place to provide a clear picture of how it would have looked in its prime. It is open to visitors and has a small museum and visitor's centre. A lodge house was built by Tollemache in the 19th century, and was expanded in the 20th century. The lodge is two storeys high, with two circular towers either side of a central archway. It is designated as a Grade II listed building. The views from Beeston stretch across eight counties from the Pennines in the east to the Welsh mountains in the west.

Anderson was born in Hillsborough, North Carolina, where he worked as a shoemaker at an early age. By 1824 he was living in Bedford County, Tennessee, where he became deputy sheriff in 1826 and sheriff in 1830; he was a colonel in the militia by 1832. In 1837, he and his family moved to San Augustine, Texas, where his wife's brother-in-law Joseph Rowe had lived for five years. In 1838 Anderson served successively as deputy sheriff and sheriff. It was probably after he arrived in Texas that he studied to become a lawyer. President of Texas Mirabeau B. Lamar appointed him collector of customs for the district of San Augustine, and he was confirmed on November 21, 1839. He served as collector until he became a candidate from San Augustine County for the Texas House of Representatives of the Sixth Congress in 1841; he won with the largest majority in San Augustine County's history at that time. As a partisan of Sam Houston, Anderson was elected Speaker of the House on November 1, 1841. He immediately led an unsuccessful attempt to impeach President Lamar and Vice President David G. Burnet. Anderson had for a time been considered for secretary of the treasury of the republic, a post that went to William Henry Daingerfield. In 1842 he helped convince President Houston to veto the popular but dangerous war bill, which sought to force an invasion of Mexico. After one term, and despite Houston's pleas, Anderson retired later in 1842 to practice law in San Augustine with Royall T. Wheeler; he eventually formed a partnership with J. Pinckney Henderson and Thomas Jefferson Rusk. In December, Anderson became district attorney of the Fifth Judicial District. In 1844, Anderson was frequently mentioned as a candidate for president of the republic, but eventually he became the candidate for vice president, on a ticket headed by Anson Jones. Anderson's opponent, Patrick Jack, died before the election, and Anderson won nearly unanimously. He presided over the Senate at Washington-on-the-Brazos, Texas in June 1845, when the Texas Congress approved the Texas Annexation by the United States. After the annexation vote, he immediately left for home despite being sick. After only twenty miles, at the Fanthorp Inn in modern-day Anderson, Texas, his fever flared and he died in office at age 39. The Vice President had been considered the leading candidate to become the first governor of Texas. His law partner, Pinckney Henderson, was instead elected governor in December. Both Anderson County and the town of Anderson in Texas are named after him.

The German V4 was built in the Cologne plant and powered the Ford Taunus and German versions of the Consul, Capri, and Transit. Design Balance shaft In common with other V4 and V6 engines, but unlike longer V engines with more cylinders, the connecting rods do not share a crankpin on the crankshaft. The V4 was later expanded into the Ford Cologne V6 engine that was used in the Ford Capri, Ford Taunus, Ford Cortina, Ford Consul, Ford Granada, Ford Sierra, Ford Scorpio, Ford Ranger, Ford Explorer, Ford Mustang, Mercury Capri, and many other cars. The V4 engine was also used in industrial applications: pumps, electrical generators, and in agricultural machinery and snowcats. In automobiles, the Taunus V4 was replaced by the Ford OHC/Pinto engine. Initially the V4 engine was designed by Ford for a new entry compact car intended for the US market to be called the Ford \\"Cardinal\\", which eventually evolved into the Taunus 12m P4. Ford abandoned the \\"Cardinal\\" project and instead built the Ford Falcon for North America. Ford then sought other uses for the V4 engine which was initially tested in the Saab 96. Ford bought several Saab 96s for testing and eventually sold the cars back to Saab with the V4 engines in them. Saab tested the V4s at their Trollh√§ttan test track which stimulated Saab to acquire the V4 engine for their 95, 96, and 97 (Sonett) introduced in August 1966 (1967 production model).

Coach House publishes innovative and experimental poetry, fiction, drama and non-fiction. The press is particularly interested in writing that pushes at the boundaries of convention. History The company was founded as Coach House Press in 1965 by artist Stan Bevington. It is known for publishing early works by writers such as Fred Wah, Daphne Marlatt, Margaret Atwood, Michael Ondaatje, Ann-Marie MacDonald, George Bowering, Nicole Brossard, Gwendolyn MacEwen, Christopher Dewdney, bpNichol and Anne Michaels, Darren O'Donnell, Sean DixonSean Dixon, Greg MacArthur, Matthew Heiti and Amiel Gladstone. Coach House was at the centre of a number of innovations in the use of digital technology in publishing and printing, from computerized phototypesetting to desktop publishing. Notably, the pioneering SGML/XML company, SoftQuad, was founded by Coach House's Stan Bevington and colleagues Yuri Rubinsky and David Slocombe. In 1991, Coach House was split into two separate companies: the printing house Coach House Printing, headed by Bevington, and the book publisher Coach House Press, headed by Margaret McClintock. Bevington subsequently tried, unsuccessfully, to reacquire the publishing company. Ultimately, the book publisher declared bankruptcy in 1996, and later the same year Bevington moved the printing company back into book publishing. The company is located in several former coach houses on bpNichol Lane, near Spadina and Bloor, which were rented from Campus Co- operative Residence Incorporated. In 2004, controversy arose when the media reported that the cooperative would be demolishing the coach house buildings, and politicians and public interest groups campaigned to have the buildings declared a heritage site.\\"Tearing down the House\\". Now, July 22, 2004. In 2009, the company directly acquired the buildings for the first time in its history.Q, August 12, 2009. Operations Coach House is one of the few Canadian publishing companies that prints its own titles; the printing operations also print books for several other small Canadian publishers and literary magazines, including Acta Victoriana and the Hart House Review. The reputation of the new Coach House has been growing steadily since its rebirth in 1997, but it skyrocketed with the publication of Christian B√∂k's Eunoia. This work of experimental poetry won the Canadian Griffin Poetry Prize in 2002 and has sold over 19,000 copies. Coach House books have been the recipients of dozens of other awards and nominations, including the Governor General's Award, the City of Toronto Book Award, the Commonwealth Writers' Prize, the Lambda Literary Award, the Books in Canada/Amazon.ca First Novel Award and the Trillium Book Award. Its most recent successes have been a series of books of collected essays by Toronto writers on various aspects of their city. The first, uTOpia (2005), about various writers' notions of a perfectible Toronto, was a surprise hit and was followed by The State of the Arts (2006), GreenTOpia (2007) and HtO (2008) about water in the city.http://www.chbooks.com/catalogue/browse/category/SOC Frequent contributors to the volumes include John Lorinc, Shawn Micallef, Derek McCormack, Dylan Reid, Bert Archer, St√©phanie Verge, Chris Hardwicke, Mark Fram, Liz Forsberg, Dale Duncan and Darren O'Donnell.

It was passed as a United States Public Law () on August 22, 1940, and is codified at . Along with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and extensive rules issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, it forms the backbone of United States financial regulation. It has been updated by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. Often referenced as the Investment Company Act, the 1940 Act or simply the '40 Act, it is the primary source of regulation for mutual funds and closed-end funds, an investment industry now in the many trillions of dollars.Lemke, Lins and Smith, Regulation of Investment Companies (Matthew Bender, 2013). In addition, the '40 Act impacts the operations of hedge funds, private equity funds and even holding companies. History Following the founding of the mutual fund in 1924, investors invested in this new investment vehicle heavily. Five and a half years later, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 occurred in the stock market, followed shortly thereafter by the United States entry into the Great Depression. In response to this crisis, the United States Congress wrote into law the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In 1935, Congress requested that the SEC report on the industry, and the Investment Trust Study was reported between 1938 and 1940. The law as originally introduced was different from the law which passed; the original draft granted more broad power to the SEC, while the final bill was a compromise between the SEC and industry which was drafted and submitted to Congress by joint members of the SEC and industry, and Congress ultimately passed a similar version. David Schenker, who became the head of the Investment Company Division at the SEC, was one of the original drafters. By 1992, the act had remained largely unchanged aside from amendments in 1970 to provide additional protections particularly around independent boards and limiting fees and expenses. Scope The act's purpose, as stated in the bill, is \\"to mitigate and ... eliminate the conditions ... which adversely affect the national public interest and the interest of investors.\\" Specifically, the act regulated conflicts of interest in investment companies and securities exchanges. It seeks to protect the public primarily by legally requiring disclosure of material details about each investment company. The act also places some restrictions on certain mutual fund activities such as short selling shares. However, the act did not create provisions for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to make specific judgments about or even supervise an investment company's actual investment decisions. The act requires investment companies to publicly disclose information about their own financial health. Jurisdiction The Investment Company Act applies to all investment companies, but exempts several types of investment companies from the act's coverage. The most common exemptions are found in Sections 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7) of the act and include hedge funds. =Scale= When Congress wrote the act into federal law, rather than leaving the matter up to the individual states, it justified its action by including in the text of the bill its rationale for enacting the law: > The activities of such companies, extending over many states, their use of > the instrumentalities of interstate commerce and the wide geographic > distribution of their security holders, make difficult, if not impossible, > effective state regulation of such companies in the interest of investors. =Type= The act divides the types of investment company to be regulated into three classifications: *Face-amount certificate company: an investment company in the business of issuing face-amount certificates of the installment type. *Unit investment trust: an investment company which is organized under a trust indenture, contract of custodianship or agency, or similar instrument, does not have a board of directors, and issues only redeemable securities, each of which represents an undivided interest in a unit of specified securities; but does not include a voting trust. *Management company: any investment company other than a face-amount certificate company or a unit investment trust. The most well-known type of management company is the mutual fund. Contents *Sec. 1. Findings and Declaration of Policy. *Sec. 2. General Definitions. *Sec. 3.

The definition of investment company also includes some exemptions. In addition to exemptions in the definitions, section 6 describes additional exemptions, with 6(c) notably giving the SEC broad discretion to \\"conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person ... from any provision\\". One of the original drafters, David Schenker (who became the head of the Investment Company Division at the SEC), explained the provision in 1940 by pointing to the complexities of the industry. This was notably used to exempt venture capital firms in the 1970s, which preceded changes to the statute, ultimately including a section 3(c)(7) which exempts issuers of non-public securities to qualified purchasers. Section 3(c)(11) generally exempts collective trust funds. Section 7 prohibits investment companies from doing business until registration, including public offerings; in 2018, the SEC acted against a cryptocurrency hedge fund for allegedly violating section 7. Section 7(d) is notable in that it restricts foreign investment firms from offering securities, and by 1992 no foreign firms had registered since 1973. Section 9 outlines disqualification provisions which restrict people who have committed misconduct from practice in the industry; in practice, the SEC has historically granted waivers to allow such persons to remain involved. Various provisions restrict the powers of investment companies in corporate governance over management particularly in transactions with affiliates, including section 10. These laws were passed as a reaction to self-dealing excesses in the 1920s and 1930s, where funds would, for example, dump worthless stocks into certain funds, saddling investors with their losses.  Filings  To register, a firm initially files a notification with Form N-8A, followed by a form which depends on the type of fund. Among others, firms with open-end funds must file Form 24F-2.

The name comes from the local word for a sheep pen, \\"tor\\". The foundation stock is made up from genetically homogeneous landrace shepherding dogs dispersed in the mountains and valleys of the region. They are a molosser-type mountain dog, similar to other livestock guardian breeds of the region, the ≈†arplaninac and the Bucovina Shepherd Dog. History Tornjak belongs to the rare livestock protection breeds and share many characteristics with other livestock guarding dogs. The Tornjak is an old breed first mentioned in the 11th then 14th century. Descriptions of the Tornjak were found in the writings of Peter Horvat, bishop of ƒêakovo, Croatia, which date back to the year 1374, those descriptions were also found in the writings of Peter Lukiƒá, Canon of the ƒêakovo diocese, which were written in 1752. To this day, these dogs are called Tora≈°i (Torashi) in the surroundings of the city of Sinj and on the Kame≈°nica mountain, whereas the shepherds of the Dinara-mountains call them Dinarci. Descriptions of Tornjaks from these documents are the very same as they are today, except for the name of the breed, which was Bosanski Ovƒçar, meaning Bosnian Shepherd Dog. It was also called the Hrvatski pas planinac, meaning Croatian mountain dog. The dogs in these documents were described entirely equal (in respect to their function and their appearance) as they are today: a protective guarding dog which keeps and watches all that their owners ask them, but is highly intelligent and selectively bred to be without excessive aggression. They are also pleasant toward strangers that they meet outside of their domain. It is considered that the dogs of the Tornjak's type have existed in the area around and in Dinarides (Dinaric Alps), especially in the region around Vla≈°iƒá (close to the city of Travnik, Bosnia and Herzegovina) as a central area of the region since the Roman times. The Romans used their dogs for war and as guardian dogs, as well as for fighting in the arena. Although the Tornjak is a very old breed, with the vanishing of nomadic sheep herding, the Tornjak also gradually vanished. In the early 1970s, a group of local cynologists began to collect the remaining dogs which best corresponded to the old writings about the breed. Tornjaks were first imported to the UK in 2013 with intentions of working towards UK Kennel Club Recognition.  Characteristics  A female Tornjak of Croatian breeding participating in the European Winner Show 2008 in Budapest, Hungary. = Appearance = The Tornjak is a large and powerful dog, with well proportioned, almost square-bodied features and agile movements. The dog's bones are not light, but nevertheless not heavy nor coarse. The bodies of these dogs are strong and well built, with harmonious and dignified movements, possessing a self-confident, serious and calm disposition. In general the Tornjak is a long-coated dog with short hair over the face and legs. The hair is distinctively long and abundant over the neck (mane), and on the back of the upper thighs (breeches). The tail is especially well feathered, and carried like a flag while the dog moves. The coat is very dense and can not be parted. As a rule, the Tornjak is parti-colored, with white being the dominant ground color. White markings are most commonly found around the neck, over the head and along the legs. The patches can be any color. Similar to other livestock guardian dogs, the distinct markings served an utilitarian purpose, helping shepherds distinguish their dogs from both sheep and wolves. ;Temperament Tornjak has a calm temperament. A typical adult Tornjak is very calm, peaceful, at first sight an indifferent animal, but when the situation demands it, it is a vigilant and very alert watchdog. The character is equal to the temperament; they are not nervous nor aggressive. In general, they are very tough, not too demanding, sturdy dogs. With their human family they are very emotional. When living in a pack they are highly social animals, without fighting between the pack members. Towards strangers or other animals, as a rule, Tornjak is not overly aggressive. But when the situation calls upon it, Tornjak is quite decisive and it can without any consideration attack even much stronger rivals. Shepherds used to say that a Tornjak that guards the flock is a fair match to two wolves, and that a couple of Tornjaks will confront and chase away a bear. In these situations, Tornjaks can be very tenacious.The coat is shorter in the Summer. Activities Tornjak's exercise levels are usually not demanding, especially in the first 9‚Äì12 months (during the last intensive growth period). After that they can exercise as much as possible. They prefer long walks without a leash and a lot of playing with other dogs. They will also be just as satisfied with only a 20-minute walk if its owner is in a hurry. Tornjaks learn quickly and do not forget easily; they happily perform tasks and are therefore easy to train. Strong and hardy, during the snowy winter nights, these dogs lie on the ground and often get covered with snow without freezing due to their thick coats. They are primarily used for herding and protection of livestock. Care Tornjak is not recommended for apartment life. They need space and will do best with at least a large yard. Because its thick coat protects it so well it can happily cope with living outdoors provided it has proper shelter. This breed is best suited to a family with much space surrounding the home where it can attend to its own exercise needs. Tornjak is a very healthy breed, but because they were very poorly fed in their past, they now do not need much protein in their food. For feeding Tornjaks a low protein diet is suitable. A high protein diet can lead to the development of coat problems. Climbing up and down stairs the first six months can ruin hock joints or lead to hip dysplasia (canine). Tornjak needs early socialization. Early experiences (before 9 months of age) has a very significant effect throughout the dog's life. They need to be confronted with all potentially fearful stimuli as early as possible in order to avoid later fear reactions. Traffic noise, big trucks and buses will provoke fear reactions in adulthood if the Tornjak has not previously faced these situations as a puppy. In this early age all Tornjak puppies have to meet as many unknown people as possible, and also other animals, dogs, and pets especially, for developing a good and stable behavior as an adult. Ban The dog is banned in Denmark.

The cemetery was established in 1821 after Chile's independence when Bernardo O'Higgins inaugurated the Alameda de las Delicias along the old course of the Mapocho River. O'Higgins set aside more than 85 hectares of land for the foundation of what became a magnificent grounds filled with ornate mausoleums surrounded by palm and leaf trees set amidst lush gardens and numerous sculptures, which have been estimated be 237. The cemetery, which is located northwest of Cerro Blanco, serves as a true urban park for Santiago. This cemetery is the final resting place for at least 172 of the most influential people in Chile, including all but two of the deceased Presidents of Chile, the exceptions being Gabriel Gonz√°lez Videla and Augusto Pinochet. One of the most visited memorials is that of former President Salvador Allende who had been buried in the Santa Ines cemetery at Vi√±a del Mar following his suicide in the 1973 coup d'√©tat. With the democratic changes that began in the 1990s, Allende was exhumed and his remains were transported in a solemn procession through the streets of Santiago to a place of honor in the Cementerio General de Santiago. The cemetery also has a memorial to the people that were 'disappeared' during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet that ousted President Allende. The gatehouse that serves as the main entrance to the cemetery is crowned by a dome, which acts as a terminating vista for La Paz Avenue. This entrance is preceded by the Plaza La Paz, a semicircular plaza whose curved portion is framed by two exposed brick arcades. At the center of the square stands a monument dedicated to the people who died in the Church of the Company Fire. The cemetery can be accessed via Cementerios metro station. The historical portion of the cemetery was designated as a national monument in 2010, reaching the same status as Patio 29.

It is centred on Stonyhurst College, occupying the great house, its preparatory school Stonyhurst Saint Mary's Hall and the parish church, St Peter's.Stonyhurst College website The Estate The grounds are bounded by the River Hodder, the village of Hurst Green and Longridge Fell. The Forest of Bowland Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty overlaps in places.Places of Interest in The Forest of Bowland Area Of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) The earliest deed for the estate dates back to 1200 A.D. when it was known as the \\"Stanihurst\\".A Stonyhurst Handbook for Visitors and Others, third edition, 1963 It passed through the Bayley family to their descendants, the Shireburns (\\"Sherburnes\\" etc), before passing into the hands of Thomas Weld (of Lulworth). Already possessing a large estate, he donated it to the Jesuits in 1794 as a new home for their school, of which he was an old boy when it was located at Liege.T. E. Muir, Stonyhurst A junior branch of the Sherburnes, who had earlier fled to Oxford to build and dwell in Beam Hall, subsequently emigrated to New England, where they contributed in various ways to the early history of the United States; these descendants included Henry Sherburne and John Sherburne. Buildings Stonyhurst College Stonyhurst College and Stonyhurst Saint Mary's Hall are Jesuit boarding schools with approximately 800 pupils in total, most of whom are boarders. The schools are connected by parallel footpaths through the woods, known as Brothers' Walk. The name derives from the fact that before the schools became co-educational, pupils from the college would take the route to visit their younger brothers at Saint Mary's Hall although the term could originate from when St Mary's Hall operated as a seminary for trainee Jesuits. They walked along the path reciting the Spiritual Exercises of St Ignatius. A number of teachers and Jesuit priests work and live on the site. Adjacent to the school buildings are workshops employing masons and craftsmen working on the maintenance and restoration of the buildings. There is a large mill which was once a granary but is currently used as a sawmill. The Church of St Peter is the parish church for the neighbouring village of Hurst Green.Parish details (Mass times and Websites) The Stonyhurst Observatory began operations in 1838, transferring to a new building in 1866. The records of temperature taken there are the oldest continual daily records in the world. Today, the observatory is one of four used by the Met Office to provide temperature data for central England. The estate contains the two hamlets of Stockbridge and Woodfields, both of which are inhabited by teachers from Stonyhurst College. Hodder Place, the former site of the preparatory school is now divided into residential flats which are privately owned; the grounds remain part of the estate. Richard Sherburne built an almshouse on Longridge Fell, the predecessor of the Sherburne Almshouse, which his son Sir Nicholas built in circa 1707. The latter was dismantled in 1946 and re-erected in Hurst Green. Monuments Pinfold Cross Religious monuments in the area are a reminder of the Jesuit presence and strength of CatholicismT. E. Muir, Stonyhurst, pp. 55-61, esp. p. 56: Lancashire, the \\"very Catholic county\\" in the locality. Most notably, the Lady Statue at the top of the Avenue connecting Stonyhurst College with Hurst Green. It was erected in 1882, and inscribed with the words \\"Ave Maria\\"., catholicassociation.co.uk; accessed 12 November 2013 Cromwell's rock is situated at the top of the Avenue, near St Peter's church graveyard. According to tradition, Cromwell stood on this inconspicuous stone and described the mansion ahead of him as \\"the finest half-house in England\\" (the symmetry of the building was, at that time, incomplete). Four old crosses stand at disparate locations around the estate. Pupils from the school used to visit each cross in an annual pilgrimage to mark Palm Sunday.General News The Pinfold Cross is a memorial to a former servant at Stonyhurst College and fiddler, James Wells, who fell to his death in a quarry nearby on 12 February 1834. It was erected in 1834 at Stockbridge. On the front is inscribed the legend, ‚ÄòWATCH FOR YOU KNOW NOT THE DAY NOR HOUR.' Above this is written, ‚ÄòOFT EVENINGS GLAD MAKE MORNINGS SAD'. On the left is ‚ÄòPRAY FOR THE SOUL OF JAMES WELLS' and on the right, ‚ÄòDIED FEB. 12TH, 1834'. Saint Paulinus' Cross stands at Kemple End and is a listed monument believed to date from Anglo-Saxon times. It may well mark a spot at which Saint Paulinus of York, who converted King Edwin of Northumbria and founded the See of York, preached. Stonyhurst Park Cross Cross Gills Farm Cross is thought to have come from a church and has \\"1910\\" as graffiti on it. An old wives' tale records how a farmer replaced the cross when his cattle died after he threw the original into the river. Stonyhurst Park Cross stands above the River Hodder in the woods close to the former Jesuit novitiate and preparatory school, Hodder Place. A new cross was fixed to the ancient base in 1910, and was blessed on 12 June 1910 by the Jesuit provincial, Father Sykes; the origin of the earlier monument is unknown. The grounds of St Mary's Hall contain a Marian grotto and a statue of the Sacred Heart. Tourism The Estate boundary at the River Hodder The estate is a tourist attraction.

The character was briefly a member of the X-Men. A flamboyant South African mutant who spoke in exaggerated Afrikaans slang, Maggott was advertised as one of the strangest X-Men. His digestive system took the form of two slugs which could eat through practically any substance. After feeding, the slugs reentered Maggott's abdomen and passed nourishment into him, giving him incredible power. Publication history Created by writer Scott Lobdell and Joe Madureira, he first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #345 (June 1997). Fictional character biography Maggott was first seen as a mysterious mutant who is searching out the X-Men‚Äôs adversary Magneto for an unknown reason.http://worldofblackheroes.com/2010/09/15/uncanny-x- men-345-review/ Uncanny X-Men #345 (June 1997) His search led to Antarctica where Magneto was holding the X-Men captive. Maggott then joined up with the team and returned with them to their Westchester, New York headquarters. For a short period of time, Maggott believed his companions were going off on their own and killing innocent people. He even tried to turn himself over to the police before being stopped by the X-Men. His companions turned out to be innocent, as the people had been slain by a faction of N'Garai, though they hated to be called so. These entities are a demonic-type race that the X-Men had faced many times, mainly because a regenerating magical portal lies deep in the woods on the mansion's grounds. A matter which was never resolved was why Maggott's slugs were seemingly related to the N'Garai. Maggott later was tempted by the entity Shadow King with promises of a better life in exchange for his loyalty and abandonment of the X-Men. He managed to resist the villain. Marrow and Cecilia Reyes were also propositioned by the King, but also resisted. Psylocke then rescues the X-Men after keeping Shadow King in a psionic prison, which forced her in retirement as she could not use her mind powers for anything or else the Shadow King would be released from the prison within Psylocke's mind. At first, he kept his past to himself, but Maggott eventually revealed his origin to Wolverine.X-Men vol. 2 #76 (June 1998) Maggott had been born a sickly child in Apartheid-era South Africa and was named Japheth. He was always very ill and he could not digest solid food. Feeling himself to be a burden on his family, he ran away from home with his younger brother. Having left home, hoping to die, he was found by Magneto who released the slugs from his body and revealed to Japheth his mutant power. This turned his skin blue for the first time, and he named the slugs Eany and Meany. Compassionate at heart, Japheth immediately rejected Magneto's philosophy and his offer to join him after he shortly witnessed later the Master of Magnetism brutally massacre numerous white South African soldiers who were engaged in racist atrocities against black South African civilians (despite the fact that one of these civilians was Japheth's eldest brother who died in the violence). In spite of this, he later sought out Magneto when he got older, for help in easing the pain caused by his unique mutation. After the then-current roster of the team parted ways, the X-Man Beast suggested Maggott transfer to the junior team Generation X, but his tenure there lasted only one issue and afterwards he fell out of sight. Generation X Volume 1, No.49, March 1999. Maggott reappeared as an inmate at \\"Neverland,\\" a concentration camp run by the covert government program Weapon X. Along with a number of other mutants, he was exterminated there.Weapon X vol. 2 #5 One of his slugs, which he gave away to two children at the camp after foreseeing his death (thanks to his psychometric powers) at the camp, was last seen in a container in Mister Sinister's laboratory.Weapon X #14 Maggott is later resurrected by means of the Transmode Virus to serve as part of Selene's army of deceased mutants. Under the control of Selene and Eli Bard, he takes part in the assault on the mutant nation of Utopia.X-Men: Legacy #231, January 2010 Maggott's fate is uncertain as it is unknown if he was among the mutants teleported to Genosha by Blink to serve as a sacrifice to the newly-deitious Selene or if he was among the mutants that managed to escape Utopia. Maggott was confirmed to still be alive and powered (though with only one of his slugs) as he was a guest at a superheroes and supervillains-themed costume party of New York branch of the Hellfire Club and was later apparently passed out drunk with other party guests (such as Rocket Raccoon) around an outdoor swimming pool. Wolverine and the X-Men Vol. 2 #10-11 Maggott appeared (along with both of his slugs) along with the other X-Men as part of Cyclops' Million Mutant March in Washington D.C.Uncanny X-Men #600 Most recently, Maggott briefly appeared during the X-Men Disassembled storyline as part of the last ditch battle against Nate Grey. Eventually returning to the primary Marvel Universe he and many others left behind while living separate lives in the Age of X-Man universe.Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 9-10 After the proclamation set up by X was telepathically broadcast to the whole world, Japheth was one amongst thousands to accept the invitation to the new mutant nation; Krakoa's boarders.House of X Vol 1 5 He was later seen enjoying wine & revelry on his new homeland with a great many others among the revived mutant flock.Excalibur Vol 4 1 Powers and abilities * Digestive system replaced by a hollow cavity that houses a pair of semi-sentient slugs called Eany and Meany who bore their way out of his torso and then use powerful enzymes to process and digest any solid objects in their path at super speeds, transmitting food energy back to their host to supercharge his physical size, strength, stamina, and sturdiness while turning his skin blue and his eyes red, but the slugs must re-enter through his belly and release their storage internally to feed his body properly. * Psychometric power enables him to draw psychic imprints from his environment, replaying in his mind's-eye events which once took place or will soon take place in his general vicinity. Other versions =Age of X= In the Age of X alternate reality, Maggott was shown as a prisoner of the prison camp called Camp Gorge. He was killed by that reality's Iron Man. =Ultimate Marvel= In the Ultimate Marvel universe, a version of Maggott made a cameo as a teenage mutant in Manhattan, killed by Mister Sinister acting on orders from Apocalypse.Ultimate X-Men #47 An alternate, child version of Maggott later appears in the Morlock tunnels underneath New York.

Background Born the son of an army surgeon in Darmstadt, Duesterberg entered the Prussian Army in 1893 after training in the cadet corps. In 1900, Duesterberg was part of the East Asian Expedition Corps that saw action in China during the Boxer Rebellion. Two years later, Duesterberg became an officer and held a variety of army commands prior to World War I. During the war, Duesterberg served in the Prussian War Ministry and eventually attained the rank of Oberstleutnant. Following the war, Duesterberg retired from the army in protest over the Versailles Treaty, which Duesterberg viewed as being extremely unfair to Germany. Duesterberg subsequently decided to enter politics and joined the German National People's Party (DNVP) in 1919. Der Stahlhelm After various disagreements with the party leadership, however, Duesterberg left the DNVP in 1923 and joined the nationalistic and pro-monarchy Der Stahlhelm, which largely consisted of ex-servicemen disgruntled with the Weimar Republic. Duesterberg quickly moved through its hierarchy and by 1924 was one of two of its federal leaders (the other being Franz Seldte). Together with General Georg Ludwig Rudolf Maercker, Duesterberg was one of the leaders of the extreme anti-Semitic fraction within Der Stahlhelm who wanted to ban Jews from joining, and expel all of the current Jewish members. In March 1924, Maercker and Duesterberg forced Seldte to adopt the \\"Aryan clause\\" and expel all Jews from Der Stahlhelm. The \\"Aryan clause\\" of 1924 was later to serve as the inspiration for similar \\"Aryan clauses\\" under the Third Reich, and in particular influenced the War Minister, General Werner von Blomberg in his attempts to keep the Wehrmacht \\"racially clean\\". Under Duesterberg's leadership, Der Stahlhelm became Germany's largest para-military groups. In the late 1920s, Duesterberg allied Der Stahlhelm with the Nazi Party and other right wing groups. In 1929 Duesterberg campaigned against the Young Plan in the referendum held in November 1929. In 1931, Duesterberg played a key role in forcing the referendum on early elections in Prussia, believing this would help polarize German politics by incorporating the moderate right into the \\"national\\" camp.Jones, Larry Eugene \\"Nationalists, Nazis, and the Assault against Weimar: Revisiting the Harzburg Rally of October 1931\\" pages 483-494 from German Studies Review Vol. 29, No. 3, October 2006 page 485. The leader of the German National People's Party Alfred Hugenberg had starting in 1929 embarked upon a strategy of polarization aimed at the destruction of the political center in Germany, so that the only alternatives would the Marxist parties in the form of the SPD and KPD and the right-wing \\"national\\" parties. The failure of the Prussian referendum helped to win Duesterberg away from his strategy of attempting to co-opt the moderate right into the \\"national\\" camp, and instead to work for the destruction of the moderate right as Hugenberg advocated.Jones, Larry Eugene \\"Nationalists, Nazis, and the Assault against Weimar: Revisiting the Harzburg Rally of October 1931\\" pages 483-494 from German Studies Review Vol. 29, No. 3, October 2006 pages 485-486. In October 1931, Duesterberg allied Der Stahlhelmm with the Nazis, DNVP, and other right wing groups in order to form the Harzburger Front. The Harzburger Front attempted to bring about the downfall of Heinrich Br√ºning and the Weimar Republic, but it eventually dissolved due to Adolf Hitler‚Äôs unwillingness to subordinate the Nazi Party to such a vast right wing coalition on a long term basis. After the dissolution of the Harzburger Front, Duesterberg continued to lead Der Stahlhelm and maintained the organization‚Äôs alliance with the DNVP. 1932 presidential election Der Stahlhelm propaganda car in Berlin promoting DNVP nominee Theodor Duesterberg for president of the German Reich in the 1932 election In 1932, Duesterberg was nominated by Der Stahlhelm and DNVP to run for President of Germany, but the Nazis ultimately destroyed any chance Duesterberg had of gaining mass support from the German people when they revealed he had Jewish ancestry. In April 1932, the deeply anti-Semitic Duesterberg learned for the first time that his grandfather was a Prussian Jewish doctor who converted to Lutheranism in 1818, a revelation that caused Duesterberg to suffer a nervous breakdown and to submit his resignation in shame from Der Stahlhelm. Several of Duesterberg's friends persuaded him not to resign, and in an attempt to stay on as Der Stahlhelm deputy federal leader, he suggested new requirements for every member, namely that: *That Der Stahlhelm members present notarized copies of church records proving that their parents, grand-parents and great grand-parents had no ‚ÄúJewish blood‚Äù. *That Der Stahlhelm members swear on their word of honor that they had no personal, familial or business dealings with Jews in any form or way. *That Der Stahlhelm members present proof that their ancestors had fought in the ‚Äúwars of liberation‚Äù against Napoleonic France and/or the wars of unification and on what side. *That Der Stahlhelm members present proof that they had fought in the World War and in what capacity. The revelation of Duesterberg's Jewish ancestry caused Duesterberg to poll poorly in the first ballot of the election, and he withdrew from the runoff election that followed. During the 1932 presidential elections, the Nazis went out of their way to taunt Duesterberg for having Jewish ancestry with Joseph Goebbels and Richard Walther Darr√© being especially vicious in their attacks. Duesterberg was so hurt by Darr√©'s attacks that he challenged him to a duel, a challenge that Darr√© rejected because it was beneath him to fight a man with ‚ÄúJewish blood‚Äù. Duesterberg then took up his dispute with Darr√© before the court of honor of the Former Officers of the 1st Hanoverian Field Artillery Regiment of Scharnhorst, number 10 to which Darr√© belonged. Duesterberg argued before the court of honor that Darr√© should be expelled for engaging in behavior that was unbecoming of a German officer while Darr√© argued that he had right and duty to subject Duesterberg to anti-Semitic insults. The court of honor ruled in Darr√©'s favor, stating that he was right to insult Duesterberg for having ‚ÄúJewish blood‚Äù. Ironically, Duesterberg was offered a position in Hitler's cabinet when Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, but Duesterberg flatly refused the proposal. Franz Seldte, however, did enter Hitler's cabinet, which undermined Der Stahlhelm and Duesterberg's authority over the organization, and thus he resigned his leadership position in 1933. In April 1933, Duesterberg was strongly urged to resign from Der Stahlhelm by President Paul von Hindenburg and the Defense Minister, General Werner von Blomberg who told him that he was now a liability to them with Hitler now chancellor. Arrest and later life In 1934, Duesterberg was arrested by the Nazis during the Night of the Long Knives and sent to Dachau concentration camp, where he was briefly interned. After being released, he drifted into obscurity. He was known to have had limited contacts with the anti-Nazi Carl Friedrich Goerdeler in 1943, but Duesterberg ultimately did not play any role in Goerdeler's plots against Hitler. In 1949, Duesterberg wrote The Steel Helmet and Hitler, in which he defended his pre-war political career and Der Stahlhelm and detailed the movement's independence from the Nazi Party and \\"the insane Jew hatred preached by Hitler\\". A year later, Duesterberg died in Hamelin.

The museum closed in 2015. Background The museum opened its doors on May 28, 1998. Located at the former site of the early-1900s atelier of the Russian painter, Marie Vassilieff, the museum was founded by Roger Pic and Jean-Marie Drot as a nonprofit operation. The museum provided visitors with a history of the multitude of artists who came from around the world to live and work in Montparnasse at the beginning of the twentieth century, plus the museum put on temporary exhibitions of works by Montparnasse artists, both past and present. For years, both before and during World War I, Marie Vassilieff also operated what was registered as a private club that acted as a canteen for artists where food and drink were provided as cheaply as possible to struggling painters such as, Amedeo Modigliani, Chaim Soutine, Pablo Picasso, and others. Before long it became the gathering place for many others in the area and, by 1913, Vassilieff's canteen was so widely known that painter, sculptor, and filmmaker, Fernand L√©ger, gave two lectures there on the topic of Modern art. As part of a membership program, the Mus√©e du Montparnasse offered a once-a- month evening meeting where members gathered to enjoy a variety of cultural events.

Jowett (Vintage Books, p. 118 and The Internet Classics Archive). The word that Jowett here translates as \\"effeminacy\\" is not ŒºŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ∫ŒØŒ± (malakia), which he renders as \\"softness\\", but ·º°ŒºŒµœÅœåœÑŒ∑œÇ (hemerotes). Paul Shorey's translation of the latter word in the Loeb Classical Library is \\"gentleness\\".Plato, The Republic, vol. I, p. 289 Some contributors to blogs and Internet forums paraphrase this passage as \\"too much music effeminizes the man\\" and present it as if the word malakia were used in the original text.For instance, Scouter Forum: On Effeminancy In other passages in Plato's Republic too, the words malakia or malakos are not translated as \\"effeminacy\\" or effeminate. Thus the reason given for not familiarizing the guardians with poetry that pictured an afterlife of terrors was \\"lest the habit for such thrills make them more sensitive and soft than we would have them.\\"Republic, Plato, Loeb vol 237, Bk III ii; 387 c; p. 207. The word translated as \\"soft\\" is malakoteroi, an image of softened metal that Plato used also of the effect of certain kinds of music: \\"when a man abandons himself to music to play upon him and pour into his soul as it were through the funnel of his ears those sweet, soft, and dirge-like airs of which we were just now speaking ... the first result is that the principle of high spirit, if he had it, is softened like iron and is made useful instead of useless and brittle. But when he continues the practice without remission and is spellbound, the effect begins to be that he melts and liquefies till he completely dissolves away his spirit, cuts out as it were the very sinews of his soul and makes of himself a 'feeble warrior'.\\"Republic, Plato, Loeb vol 237, Bk III xviii; 411a; p. 291. Aristotle writes that, \\"of the dispositions described above, the deliberate avoidance of pain is rather a kind of softness (malakia); the deliberate pursuit of pleasure is profligacy in the strict sense.\\";Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle, Loeb vol 73, VII vii 3; pg 415. \\"One who is deficient in resistance to pains that most men withstand with success, is soft (malakos) or luxurious, for luxury is a kind of softness (malakia); such a man lets his cloak trail on the ground to escape the fatigue and trouble of lifting it, or feigns sickness, not seeing that to counterfeit misery is to be miserable.\\" and \\"People too fond of amusement are thought to be profligate, but really they are soft (malakos); for amusement is rest, and therefore a slackening of effort, and addiction to amusement is a form of excessive slackness.\\"Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle, Loeb vol 73, VII vii 7; pg 417. A writer of the Peripatetic school (c. 1st century BC or AD) elaborated a little more on Aristotle by labeling softness as a vice. He writes that \\"Cowardice is accompanied by softness (malakia), unmanliness, faint-heartedness.\\"On Virtues and Vices, Loeb vol 285, p. 497. It was also a concomitant of uncontrol: \\"The concomitants of uncontrol are softness (malakia) and negligence.\\"On Virtues and Vices, Loeb vol 285, p. 499  Translations of ŒºŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ∫ŒØŒ± as \\"effeminacy\\"  Early editions of the Liddell and Scott A Greek-English Lexicon gave \\"delicacy, effeminacy\\" as a translation of ŒºŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ∫ŒØŒ± in passages such as Herodotus 6,11 and Thucydides 1,122.ŒúŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ∫ŒØŒ± in A Greek-English Lexicon, Harper & Brothers, 1883 Since the 20th-century revision by Jones, the same work now gives \\"moral weakness\\" as the meaning of the word in the same passages. In a passage of the famous Funeral Oration that Thucydides placed in his mouth, Pericles is translated by Crawley as saying that the Athenians \\"cultivate refinement without extravagance and knowledge without effeminacy (malakia)\\".The Peloponnesian War, Thucydides, trans. Crawley, The Modern Library, NY, 1951. Book II, 40; p. 105. Older Bible translations used \\"effeminate\\" to translate malakoi in I Corinthians. =Bible translations= In the gospels, the only instance of the word (in the adjectival form) is in Matthew and Luke, who use malakos to refer to luxurious clothing, in contrast to the attire of John the Baptist: \\"What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft (malakos) clothing?\\" In this context, the word is translated as \\"soft\\", \\"fine\\", \\"delicate\\", \\"expensive\\", \\"fancy\\". Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians uses malakos in the plural to refer to persons. This is commonly translated as \\"effeminate\\", as in the King James Version, which has: \\"Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.\\" Another common translation is \\"male prostitutes\\". Other versions have: \\"passive homosexual partners\\", \\"men who are prostitutes\\", \\"effeminate call boys\\", \\"men who let other men use them for sex\\", \\"those who make women of themselves\\". =St Thomas Aquinas in translation= In Question 138 of the Second Part of the Second Part of his Summa Theologica, St. Thomas Aquinas delves more deeply into the connotations of the Latin word mollities, used to translate the word malakia used by Aristotle (whom Aquinas calls \\"the Philosopher\\") in his Nicomachean Ethics (Book VII, 7), and which is this English translation is rendered by \\"effeminacy\\". Whether effeminacy [mollities, literally \\"softness\\"] is opposed to perseverance? Objection 1. It seems that effeminacy is not opposed to perseverance. For a gloss on 1 Cor. 6:9,10, \\"Nor adulterers, nor the effeminate, nor liers with mankind,\\" expounds the text thus: \\"Effeminate‚Äîi.e. obscene, given to unnatural vice.\\" But this is opposed to chastity. Therefore, effeminacy is not a vice opposed to perseverance. Objection 2. Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 7) that \\"delicacy is a kind of effeminacy.\\" But to be delicate seems akin to intemperance. Therefore, effeminacy is not opposed to perseverance but to temperance. Objection 3. Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 7) that \\"the man who is fond of amusement is effeminate.\\" Now immoderate fondness of amusement is opposed to eutrapelia, which is the virtue about pleasures of play, as stated in Ethic. iv, 8. Therefore, effeminacy is not opposed to perseverance. On the contrary, The Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 7) that \\"the persevering man is opposed to the effeminate.\\" I answer that, As stated above (137, 1 and 2), perseverance is deserving of praise because thereby a man does not forsake a good on account of long endurance of difficulties and toils: and it is directly opposed to this, seemingly, for a man to be ready to forsake a good on account of difficulties which he cannot endure. This is what we understand by effeminacy, because a thing is said to be \\"soft\\" if it readily yields to the touch. Now a thing is not declared to be soft through yielding to a heavy blow, for walls yield to the battering-ram. Wherefore a man is not said to be effeminate if he yields to heavy blows. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 7) that \\"it is no wonder, if a person is overcome by strong and overwhelming pleasures or sorrows; but he is to be pardoned if he struggles against them.\\" Now it is evident that fear of danger is more impelling than the desire of pleasure: wherefore Tully says (De Offic. i) under the heading \\"True magnanimity consists of two things: It is inconsistent for one who is not cast down by fear, to be defeated by lust, or who has proved himself unbeaten by toil, to yield to pleasure.\\" Moreover, pleasure itself is a stronger motive of attraction than sorrow, for the lack of pleasure is a motive of withdrawal, since lack of pleasure is a pure privation. Wherefore, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. vii, 7), properly speaking an effeminate man is one who withdraws from good on account of sorrow caused by lack of pleasure, yielding as it were to a weak motion. Reply to Objection 1. This effeminacy is caused in two ways. On one way, by custom: for where a man is accustomed to enjoy pleasures, it is more difficult for him to endure the lack of them. On another way, by natural disposition, because, to wit, his mind is less persevering through the frailty of his temperament. This is how women are compared to men, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. vii, 7): wherefore those who are passively sodomitical are said to be effeminate, being womanish themselves, as it were. Reply to Objection 2. Toil is opposed to bodily pleasure: wherefore it is only toilsome things that are a hindrance to pleasures. Now the delicate are those who cannot endure toils, nor anything that diminishes pleasure. Hence it is written (Dt. 28:56): \\"The tender and delicate woman, that could not go upon the ground, nor set down her foot for‚Ä¶ softness [Douay: 'niceness'].\\" Thus delicacy is a kind of effeminacy. But properly speaking effeminacy regards lack of pleasures, while delicacy regards the cause that hinders pleasure, for instance toil or the like. Reply to Objection 3. In play two things may be considered. On the first place there is the pleasure, and thus inordinate fondness of play is opposed to eutrapelia. Secondly, we may consider the relaxation or rest which is opposed to toil. Accordingly, just as it belongs to effeminacy to be unable to endure toilsome things, so too it belongs thereto to desire play or any other relaxation inordinately.  Malacia in Latin writers  Latin writers adopted the Greek word, Latinized as malacia, to mean, literally or figuratively, \\"a calm at sea\\", \\"dead calm\\", or to mean \\"a total want of appetite\\", \\"nausea\\".  \\"Malacia\\" in English  In English, the word \\"malacia\\" is used in medicine to mean an abnormal craving for certain kinds of food, and in pathology to mean an abnormal softening of organs or tissues of the human body. Malakia and malakas in modern Greek In modern Greek, the word ŒºŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ∫ŒØŒ± ‚Äì malakia has come to mean \\"masturbation\\", and its derivative ŒºŒ±ŒªŒ¨Œ∫Œ±œÇ ‚Äì malakas means \\"one who masturbates\\". Depending on the tone of voice, this term can be used colloquially as a friendly greeting or in a derogatory sense when angry. This word is very common in modern Greece.  Greek attitude toward effeminacy  Herodotus recounted that, when the Persian king Cyrus the Great asked Croesus, a defeated king who was now his counsellor, what he should do in view of a revolt of the Lydians, Croesus advised him to punish the leader, \\"but let the Lydians be pardoned; and lay on them this command, that they may not revolt or be dangerous to you; then, I say, and forbid them to possess weapons of war, and command them to wear tunics under their cloaks and buskins on their feet, and to teach their sons lyre-playing and song and dance and huckstering. Then, O King, you will soon see them turned to women instead of men; and thus you need not fear lest they revolt.\\"The Histories, Herodotus, trans. Robin Waterfield, Oxford University Press, NY, 1998. Book I, 155‚Äì157; pg 69. Note that the word malakia is not used in the Greek original of this text. The Greek idea that those engaged in mechanical trades incurred effeminacy was expressed by Xenophon (the word translated here as \\"effeminate\\" is unrelated to malakia): > Men do indeed speak ill of those occupations which are called handicrafts, > and they are rightly held of little repute in communities, because they > weaken the bodies of those who make their living at them by compelling them > to sit and pass their days indoors. Some indeed work all the time by a fire. > But when the body becomes effeminate (thelunomenos) the mind too is > debilitated. Besides, these mechanical occupations (banausos) leave a man no > leisure to attend to his friends' interests, or the public interest. This > class therefore cannot be of much use to his friends or defend his country. > Indeed, some states, especially the most warlike, do not allow a citizen to > engage in these handicraft occupations.

It is a part of Tata Group, an Indian conglomerate. Its products include passenger cars, trucks, vans, coaches, buses, sports cars, construction equipment and military vehicles. Tata Motors has auto manufacturing and assembly plants in Jamshedpur, Pantnagar, Lucknow, Sanand, Dharwad, and Pune in India, as well as in Argentina, South Africa, Great Britain, and Thailand. It has research and development centres in Pune, Jamshedpur, Lucknow, and Dharwad, India and South Korea, Great Britain, and Spain. Tata Motors' principal subsidiaries purchased the English premium car maker Jaguar Land Rover (the maker of Jaguar and Land Rover cars) and the South Korean commercial vehicle manufacturer Tata Daewoo. Tata Motors has a bus-manufacturing joint venture with Marcopolo S.A. (Tata Marcopolo), a construction-equipment manufacturing joint venture with Hitachi (Tata Hitachi Construction Machinery), and a joint venture with Fiat Chrysler which manufactures automotive components and Fiat Chrysler and Tata branded vehicles. Founded in 1945 as a manufacturer of locomotives, the company manufactured its first commercial vehicle in 1954 in a collaboration with Daimler-Benz AG, which ended in 1969. Tata Motors entered the passenger vehicle market in 1988 with the launch of the TataMobile followed by the Tata Sierra in 1991, becoming the first Indian manufacturer to achieve the capability of developing a competitive indigenous automobile. In 1998, Tata launched the first fully indigenous Indian passenger car, the Indica, and in 2008 launched the Tata Nano, the world's cheapest car. Tata Motors acquired the South Korean truck manufacturer Daewoo Commercial Vehicles Company in 2004 and purchased Jaguar Land Rover from Ford in 2008. Tata Motors is listed on the (BSE) Bombay Stock Exchange, where it is a constituent of the BSE SENSEX index, the National Stock Exchange of India, and the New York Stock Exchange. The company is ranked 265th on the Fortune Global 500 list of the world's biggest corporations as of 2019. On 17 January 2017, Natarajan Chandrasekaran was appointed chairman of the company Tata Group. Tata Motors increases its UV market share to over 8% in FY2019. History Tata Sierra (1991-2000) Tata Sumo (1994‚Äì2019) Tata Motors was founded in 1945, as a locomotive manufacturer. Tata Group entered the commercial vehicle sector in 1954 after forming a joint venture with Daimler-Benz of Germany. After years of dominating the commercial vehicle market in India, Tata Motors entered the passenger vehicle market in 1991 by launching the Tata Sierra, a sport utility vehicle based on the Tata Mobile platform. Tata subsequently launched the Tata Estate (1992; a station wagon design based on the earlier Tata Mobile), the Tata Sumo (1994, a 5-door SUV) and the Tata Safari (1998). Tata Indica (first generation) Tata launched the Indica in 1998, a fully indigenous Indian passenger car tailor-made to suit Indian consumer needs though styled by I.D.E.A, Italy. Although initially criticised by auto analysts, its excellent fuel economy, powerful engine, and an aggressive marketing strategy made it one of the best-selling cars in the history of the Indian automobile industries. A newer version of the car, named Indica V2, was a major improvement over the previous version and quickly became a mass favourite. Tata Motors also successfully exported large numbers of the car to South Africa. The success of the Indica played a key role in the growth of Tata Motors. In 2004, Tata Motors acquired Daewoo's South Korea-based truck manufacturing unit, Daewoo Commercial Vehicles Company, later renamed Tata Daewoo. On 27 September 2004, Ratan Tata, the Chairman of Tata Motors, rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange to mark the listing of Tata Motors. In 2005, Tata Motors acquired a 21% controlling stake in the Spanish bus and coach manufacturer Hispano Carrocera.

In 2014 the Kiribati government established a exclusion zone around each of the southern Line Islands (Caroline (commonly called Millennium), Flint, Vostok, Malden, and Starbuck). Geography Flint Island is located about northwest of Tahiti, south-southeast of Vostok Island, and southwest of Caroline Island. The island is about long and wide at its widest point (). It has a land area of and rises to a height of above sea level. The island is surrounded by a narrow fringing reef and with no safe anchorage landing is difficult. According to the U.S. Exploring Expedition (February 5, 1841), the island was thickly wooded with primeval forest, however the island is now mostly covered with planted coconut palms. History Flint island was discovered by the Spanish expedition of Ferdinand Magellan on 4 February 1521, and charted as Tiburones (Sharks in Spanish) because of the many sharks that sailors fished in it. Together with Puka-Puka (named San Pablo) they were named Islas Infortunadas (Unfortunate Islands in Spanish).Maude, H.E. \\"Spanish discoveries in the Pacific\\" Journal of the Polynesian Society, Wellington, New Zealand, 1959, Volume 68, No. 4, p 291-293. A now-discredited theory held that the island was named after Captain Keen, who visited in 1835, but an entry in Krusenstern's Hydrographie der gr√∂ssern Ozeane, published in 1819, makes it clear the island already had this name. Flint Island was claimed under the 1856 U.S. Guano Act, but it was apparently never occupied. It was leased by the British to Houlder Brothers and Co. of London who carried out guano digging in the central part of the island from 1875 to 1880 under field manager John T. Arundel. From 1881 John T. Arundel & Co. carried on the mining business. The excavated areas have since filled with brackish water, forming two or three small lagoons. Coconut palms were planted on the island by Arundel in 1881 and copra was produced until 1891. The island was leased in 1911 to S.R. Maxwell and Co., Ltd. who employed 30 men and one manager to harvest copra from the approximately 30,000 coconut palms. On January 3, 1908 a total eclipse of the sun was observed on the island by an expedition from the Lick Observatory in California. The observation point on the island was determined to be at latitude.The Lick Observatory-Crocker Expedition to Flint Island Photo gallery File:Flint Island AKK Beach.jpgBeach on Flint Island File:Flint Island AKK Fringing Reef.jpgFringing Reef on Flint Island File:Flint Island AKK Lake.jpgOne of the shallow lakes in Flint Island's interior File:Flint Island AKK Profile.jpgHeavy vegetation on Flint Island File:Flint Island AKK Pisonia.jpgStand of Pisonia on Flint Island See also * List of Guano Island claims * List of islands * Desert island References External links * National Geographic - Southern Line Islands Expedition, 2014 *Flint Island information *More Flint Island information * Krusenstern, A.

Offering three terrain parks and many glades, the resort is home to the only six-person chairlift in New Hampshire.  History  Ragged Mountain Ski Area opened in 1965, sporting seven runs, a T-bar, and a Hall double. Amidst little snowfall and the failure to install snowmaking equipment, the resort went bankrupt in 1974. That year, the state bought the area and immediately sold it to a group of people involved in the ski industry. The area closed during the 1983-84 season. Real estate developers Al and Walter Endriunas bought the area in a few years later, installed snowmaking and added a new beginner slope, along with another T-bar. Ragged opened once more for the 1988-89 season. They installed two more double lifts in the early 1990s and another trail complex, called Spear Mountain. In 2002, the area purchased the Summit Six-Pack detachable chairlift, an investment that caused the area to go bankrupt once more. The owners sold Ragged Mountain to RMR-Pacific, LLC, an affiliate of Utah resort developer Pacific Group in 2007. The new owners have invested over $3 million in renovations including lodge renovations, upgrades to the snowmaking capacity, and several new dining options, including a brick oven pizzeria and tavern located in the west lodge. In August 2013, Ragged Mountain released details on a new tubing park and beginner area called \\"Beginners Basin.\\" The new tubing park is planned to be over 650-feet in length (more than 2 football fields), with ten lanes. A new carpet lift will bring snow tubers from the base area to the top of the new tubing park. Beginners Basin will be located near the terrain park, adjacent to the Barnyard slope. A second 350-ft carpet lift will serve the new terrain. Ragged Mountain replaced the Spear Mountain triple with a Doppelmayr high speed detachable quad in the summer of 2014. In addition, significant upgrades were made to the Elmwood lodge, which included more seating and two new restaurants. Costs for both these projects amount to over $5 million. Expansion Ragged Mountain has plans to develop into a four season destination. Over the past several years, tree cutting has been witnessed on Pinnacle Peak, adjacent to the main Ragged peak. Ragged officials say they plan to add at least 10 new trails and 60 acres of new skiing terrain for all levels of ability. It is currently unknown as to when Ragged will begin the next steps of finishing the trail clearing, installing snowmaking and a new chairlift. In addition to Pinnacle Peak, Ragged has moved forward with plans to renovate the 18 hole golf course, a process that could take up to two years. The course will be diminished to nine holes, in order to accommodate the tubing park, future lodging and ski trails.

However Parkinson also brings up Querry's past not only as an architect but also as a womaniser. It is revealed that Querry's former lover committed suicide, thus prompting his journey to the village (however his journey was not the result of feelings of guilt or grief, but rather the incident acted to magnify his growing loss of faith and vocation.) When the first article is published and received at the village, Querry becomes angered by his portrayal, not only by Parkinson, but by Rycker whom Parkinson interviewed for the story. Querry travels to the provincial capital and on the way calls in to confront Rycker. Querry learns that Rycker's wife fears that she is pregnant and that her husband does not want a child (despite having refused contraception and having effectively forced her into sex numerous times). She tells Querry to ask Rycker for permission to travel to the capital Luc to see a doctor. Following a confrontation between Querry and Rycker, Querry leaves for Luc and takes with him Mrs. Rycker so she may visit the doctor, however neither of the two inform Rycker of her departure. Querry never becomes physically intimate with her. In Luc, Querry and Mrs. Rycker take rooms at the hotel. However, before going to sleep, Querry suspects that Mrs. Rycker is crying in the next room. When he investigates she informs him that she was actually laughing at the novel she is reading ‚Äì one that would be banned at her home with the pious Rycker ‚Äì and the two share a bottle of whisky. As Mrs. Rycker is going to sleep, Querry tells her a story which closely parallels his story: a man losing both faith and vocation. The following morning Parkinson informs Querry that Rycker has arrived in Luc in pursuit of his wife and, upon discovering his wife's diary with an entry stating \\"Spent the night with Q\\", Rycker accuses Querry of having an affair. Querry, after briefly meeting Mrs. Rycker and learning that she is pregnant with Rycker's child, leaves Luc and returns to the village, where the construction of the hospital is nearing completion. Days later Mrs. Rycker arrives at the convent near the village. She tells the sisters and priests that she has been having an affair with Querry and that she is pregnant with his child. When Querry visits her she claims that she thought of Querry whilst having sex with Rycker in an attempt to endure the man, and thus she became pregnant with what she views as Querry's child (despite it being Rycker's). Father Thomas, the temporary supervisor of the village, becomes angry at Querry for bringing shame and sin upon the village (as well as damaging his image as saintly ‚Äì despite strong objections to having such an image from Querry himself). Rycker arrives at the village and demands to see Querry, who has gone to stay in Dr. Colin's room for the night. Rycker begins to walk to Dr. Colin's stating that a court would never convict him, which troubles the priests ‚Äì one of whom pursues Rycker to prevent him shooting Querry. Enraged, Rycker confronts Querry. While being accused of adultery, Querry laughs at the absurdity of the accusations. Rycker misinterprets the laugh and becomes angry and shoots Querry, who then dies. Querry is buried in the village, which fulfills his wish to never return to his old life. Dedication and literary intentions in novel Greene dedicated A Burnt-Out Case to Docteur Michel Lechat, a medical doctor at a leper colony in Yonda in Africa (one of a number of such colonies Greene had visited in the Congo and the Cameroons, which had inspired his novel). In his dedication to Lechat, Greene writes: \\"Doctor Colin has borrowed from you his experience of leprosy and nothing else. Doctor Colin's leproserie is not your leproserie.... From the fathers of your Mission I have stolen the Superior's cheroots--that is all, and from your Bishop the boat that he was so generous as to lend me for a journey up the Ruki.\\" In reference to the characters in the novel, Greene writes: \\"It would be a waste of time for anyone to try to identify Querry, the Ryckers, Parkinson, Father Thomas--they are formed from the flotsam of thirty years as a novelist.\\" Commenting on his literary intentions in the work, Greene wrote that it was, \\"an attempt to give dramatic expression to various types of belief, half- belief, and non-belief, in the kind of setting, removed from world-politics and house-hold-preoccupations, where such differences are felt acutely and find expression.\\" Drawing a comparison between a leper-colony doctor's work and that of a novelist, Greene adds: \\"A doctor is not immune from 'the long despair of doing nothing well\\", the same \\"cafard that hangs around a writer's life\\".

On Matthew Carey's 1795 map the river was labeled \\"High Town River\\". On later maps, such as the 1839 Cass County map (Cass being the original name for Bartow County), it was referred to as \\"Hightower River\\", a name that was used in most early Cherokee records. The large Amicalola Creek (which flows over Amicalola Falls) is a primary tributary near the beginning of the river. The Etowah then flows west-southwest through Canton, Georgia, and soon forms Lake Allatoona. From the dam at the lake, it passes Cartersville and the Etowah Indian Mounds archaeological site. It then flows to Rome, Georgia, where it meets the Oostanaula River and forms the Coosa River at their confluence. The river is the northernmost portion of the Etowah-Coosa-Alabama- Mobile Waterway, stretching from the mountains of north Georgia to Mobile Bay in Alabama. The Little River is the largest tributary of the Etowah, their confluence now flooded by Lake Allatoona. Allatoona Creek is another major tributary, flowing north from Cobb County and forming the other major arm of the lake. The U.S. Board on Geographic Names officially named the river in 1897. The river ends at above mean sea level. The river is home to the Etowah darter, which is listed on the Endangered Species List. Country singer- songwriter Jerry Reed made the Etowah the home of the wild, misunderstood swamp dweller Ko-Ko Joe in the 1971 song \\"Ko-Ko Joe\\". The fictional character, who is reviled by respectable people but apparently dies a hero while saving a child's life, is alternately known as the \\"Etowah River Swamp Rat\\" in the song.

Cairn Gorm has a summit elevation of 1,245 metres (4,084 feet) AMSL and is the seventh-highest mountain in both the United Kingdom and the British Isles. Cairn Gorm gives its name to the mountain range and the National Park of which it is a part, The Cairngorms, despite that it is neither the highest nor the most prominent mountain in the range. These mountains were historically known as Am Monadh Ruadh (the Red Hills) rather than the Cairngorms. The domed summit of Cairn Gorm is one of the most readily identifiable mountains in the view from Aviemore. 600 hectares (6 square km or 2.3 square miles) of the north-western slopes of the mountain in Coire Cas and Coire na Ciste have, since the 1960s, been developed for alpine skiing. In 2001 a funicular railway was constructed to provide access through Coire Cas to the Ptarmigan building at 1087 m. The corrie south of Coire Cas, Coire an t-Sneachda, is separated from the ski area by a ridge known as Fiacaill a' Choire Chais. The southern slopes of Cairn Gorm overlook the remote loch known as Loch Avon (pronounced Loch A'an). There is an automated weather station (AWS) controlled by Heriot-Watt University on the summit of the mountain providing temperature and wind speed data. There is also a separate AWS run by the Met Office (synop code 03065). Hiking and climbing In clear, calm weather, the ascent of Cairn Gorm is a straightforward hike via the alpine ski area on the northern slopes. But when the mountain is stormbound, particularly in winter during blizzard and high avalanche risk conditions, any ascent or descent can be potentially lethal - particularly during white-outs when it is easy to lose one's bearings near the barren, featureless summit which is ringed in many directions by precipitous drops. In common with all the highest Cairngorm summits, ascents during winter conditions (which can and usually do extend well into springtime) will often require good navigation skills and winter climbing equipment such as crampons and ice-axes. The Windy Ridge path on Sr√≤n an Aonaich lying to the northeast of Coire Cas is a steep and direct route, and is generally recommended by local Rangers, guides and guidebooks. Another route to the summit is the access road up the centre of Coire Cas, however this route is a track used by the railway operator's vehicles, and gives an indirect route with several steep sections. It is not recommended as an ascent route, especially during the skiing season, though it gives good views of the Cairngorm Mountain Railway in its lower sections. Also in Coire Cas, Fiacaill a' Choire Chais offers a good walking route to Cairn Gorm and the adjacent plateau. A circuit of the cliff tops overlooking the Northern Corries of Cairn Gorm is highly recommended in many guide books and publications, giving one of the finest views in Scotland.Adam Watson.

There are many climbing routes at the head of Coire an t-Sneachda and Coire an Lochain, and in winter these corries form one of Scotland's major ice climbing areas. =1971 disaster= On 21‚Äì22 November 1971, five pupils from Ainslie Park High School in Edinburgh and a trainee instructor from Newcastle-under-Lyme died in a blizzard at Feith Buidhe on the Cairn Gorm plateau. It stands as the UK's worst mountaineering disaster.Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Association. 1988. Friends in High Places. ed Cliff, Peter.  Cairngorm Mountain ski resort  =History= The ski resort was developed on Cairn Gorm from 1960 onwards. A chairlift and chalet opened in December 1961. It is the second largest in Scotland (after Glenshee). By the 1980s, thousands of skiers were using the resort on busy weekends, and the slopes could become very crowded. By the 2000s, the number of skiers at Cairngorm and Scotland's other ski areas had dropped, partly as a consequence of budget airline travel making access to the Alps easier. The impact of Global Warming also emerged as a threat to the financial viability of the Scottish ski industry, with Adam Watson predicting in 2004 that there would be no more than twenty years left for the industry. Snow lie and weather conditions are unpredictable, but recent seasons, such as the winter seasons of 2005‚Äì2006, 2008‚Äì2009, 2009‚Äì2010 and 2010-2011 have resulted in good snow cover. Usage has recovered significantly resulting in improved finances for the ski area. In 2011‚Äì12 the resort was able to trial a TechnoAlpin T40 snow cannon, and in 2012‚Äì13 three more were leased from the manufacturers with an option to purchase.\\"Technoalpin continue business in Scotland \\" TechnoAlpin. Retrieved 1 December 2012. A larger TF10 cannon was added for the 2013‚Äì14 season =Funicular controversy= The funicular track By 1990, much of the resort's original infrastructure was ageing and proving increasingly difficult to maintain. The chairlifts and tows were also susceptible to the high winds to which the mountain is prone, and were frequently forced to shut in winds above 25 mph (40 km/h). The Cairngorm Chairlift Company, who operated the resort, proposed removing the chairlift and replacing it with a funicular railway. There was strong opposition to the funicular from environmental groups, who were concerned about damage to the mountain and its fragile soils and plants. The eventual compromise reached, after negotiations with Scottish Natural Heritage, allowed the Cairngorm Mountain Railway to be built, but with restrictions on its usage. Only those engaging in snow sports, or spectating, are allowed to exit from the top station. Other users can visit the restaurant and visitor centre, but are prevented from leaving the building to start a walk.Funicular railway cars passing halfway up. Further controversy mired the building project, with budget over-runs, allegations of conflicts of interest by those connected to both Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the construction company and questions raised about the use of public money. The construction was estimated to have cost around ¬£19.6 million, mostly funded by Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), a government body. ¬£2.7 million was provided by the European Union. The funicular opened in December 2001 Improved snow conditions in recent winters has increased its use by snowsports, according to Cairngorm Mountain Ltd but it is commercially dependent on other users. Recent good snow conditions helped the company record a profit of ¬£736,031 for the year ending 31 March 2010, HIE is interested in selling the resort. There are also groups campaigning to remove the restriction on walkers leaving the top station. In April 2014 Natural Retreats was chosen by HIE as the new operator of Cairngorm Mountain Ltd. Climate Cairn Gorm has a tundra climate (K√∂ppen ET) climate. The Met Office weather station only publishes temperature and frost data. Winter temperatures are not extreme when compared with other stations' record low temperatures in the UK, but the severity of the climate is illustrated by its cool summers.

Mammals inhabiting the mountain include mountain hare and red deer. Wildflowers found on the mountain include dwarf cornel, cloudberry and butterwort. For many of these species of flora and fauna, Cairn Gorm is one of their key strongholds.See, for example, Lee Evans, Ultimate Site Guide to Scarcer British Birds (1996).

He was most notable for his service as a U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator from the state of Michigan, and his political career spanned the American Civil War. Howard was a native of Shaftsbury, Vermont and attended schools in southern Vermont before attending Williams College, from which he graduated in 1830. He studied law, moved to Detroit in 1832, and attained admission to the bar in 1833. Howard practiced in Detroit and became active in politics, first as a Whig, and later as a Republican. Among the offices he held were city attorney (1834) and member of the Michigan House of Representatives (1838). In 1840 he was elected to the U.S. House, and he served one term, 1841 to 1843. In 1854 he was one of the founders of the Republican Party, and he served as Michigan Attorney General from 1855 to 1861. After Senator Kinsley S. Bingham died in 1861, Howard was elected to fill the vacancy. He was elected to a full term in 1865, and served from January 1862 to March 1871. From 1863 to 1871, Howard was chairman of the Senate's Committee on Pacific Railroads. Howard died April 2, 1871, a month after the expiration of his final Senate term. He was buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit. Early life Howard was born in Shaftsbury, Vermont on July 10, 1805, the son of farmer Otis Howard and Mary \\"Polly\\" Millington. He attended the district schools and the academies of Bennington and Brattleboro. Howard graduated from Williams College in 1830 and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He then studied law with attorney Homer Bartlett of Ware, Massachusetts. He moved to Detroit, Michigan in 1832, completed his legal studies with Charles Larned, was admitted to the bar in 1833 and commenced practice in Detroit. Start of career He was city attorney of Detroit in 1834 and joined the unofficial militia Governor Stevens T. Mason formed for the Toledo War in 1835-1836. Howard was a member of the Michigan House of Representatives in 1838. Howard was elected as a Whig to the US House of Representatives for the Twenty-seventh Congress, serving from March 4, 1841 to March 3, 1843. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1842, and resumed practicing law in Detroit. Howard became identified with the anti-slavery wing of the Whig Party, and campaigned for presidential nominees Henry Clay (1844), Zachary Taylor (1848), and Winfield Scott (1852). Convinced after the 1852 election that the Whig Party was no longer a viable organization for abolitionists, he helped draw up the platform of the first Republican Party convention, held in Jackson, Michigan in 1854. According to several sources, it was Howard who chose the name \\"Republican\\" for the new party. Howard was the first Republican nominee for Michigan Attorney General. He was elected and served from 1855 to 1861. Howard was widely read in the classics, history, law, and literature, and published the memoirs of the Empress Jos√©phine after translating them from the original French. U.S. Senator Howard was elected as a Republican to the US Senate in 1861 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Kinsley S. Bingham. In November 1861, Abraham Lincoln nominated him to serve as Minister to Honduras, but he declined so he could continue to serve in the Senate. He was re-elected in 1865 and served from January 1862 to March 1871. He was chairman of the Committee on Pacific Railroads in the 38th through 41st Congresses. In addition, he was an active member of the Judiciary, Military Affairs and Private Land Claims Committees. As a Senator, he was the chief sponsor of the False Claims Act, the \\"Lincoln Law\\", which permitted whistleblowers to file qui tam lawsuits against government contractors for fraud, with the incentive of receiving a monetary reward based on the recovery made by the federal government. Howard justified giving rewards to whistleblowers, many of whom had engaged in unethical activities themselves: > I have based the [qui tam provision] upon the old-fashioned idea of holding > out a temptation, and 'setting a rogue to catch a rogue,' which is the > safest and most expeditious way I have ever discovered of bringing rogues to > justice. Howard is credited with working closely with Abraham Lincoln in drafting and passing the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery. In the Senate, he also served on the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, which drafted the Fourteenth Amendment. In the Senate, Howard opposed presidential Reconstruction, arguing that Congress should play the lead role. He authored the final report on President Andrew Johnson's removal of Edwin M. Stanton as Secretary of War, which led to Johnson's impeachment. Speech on the proposed 14th Amendment During the debate over the first clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Howard argued for including the phrase \\"and subject to the jurisdiction thereof:\\" > ...[E]very person born within the limits of the United State, and subject to > their jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and national law a citizen > of the United States. This will not, of course, include persons born in the > United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of > ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the government of the United > States, but will include every other class of person.A Century of Lawmaking > for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875 > Congressional Globe, Senate, 39th Congress, 1st Session Page 2890 of 3840 Howard clarified his statement during the original congressional debate over the amendment describing the clause as having the same content, despite different wording, as the earlier Civil Rights Act of 1866, namely, that it excludes Native Americans who maintain their tribal ties and \\"persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers.\\" But he said about Native Americans: > I am not yet prepared to pass a sweeping act of naturalization by which all > the Indian savages, wild or tame, belonging to a tribal relation, are to > become my fellow-citizens and go to the polls and vote with me. According to historian Glenn W. LaFantasie of Western Kentucky University, \\"A good number of his fellow senators supported his view of the citizenship clause.\\"Congressional Globe, 1st Session, 39th Congress, pt. 4, p. 2893. Senator Reverdy Johnson said in the debate: > Now, all this amendment provides is, that all persons born in the United > States and not subject to some foreign Powerfor that, no doubt, is the > meaning of the committee who have brought the matter before usshall be > considered as citizens of the United States ... If there are to be citizens > of the United States entitled everywhere to the character of citizens of the > United States, there should be some certain definition of what citizenship > is, what has created the character of citizen as between himself and the > United States, and the amendment says citizenship may depend upon birth, and > I know of no better way to give rise to citizenship than the fact of birth > within the territory of the United States, born of parents who at the time > were subject to the authority of the United States. =Later interpretation= During the Trump Administration's debates over immigration policy, Trump supporters including Michael Anton, who advocate for restrictions on immigration, used the quote to claim that Howard did not intend for the amendment to apply to children born in the U.S. of foreign parents. In response, several legal scholars and commentators argued that a close reading of Howard's statement reveals that he meant one class of persons, the children of ambassadors at posts in the United States at the time their children were born because ambassadors to the U.S. would be foreigners, and since they were not permanent residents, they were aliens. In their view, Howard was describing one class, not three -- the children born of ambassadors and foreigners and aliens. Death and burial Howard died in Detroit on April 2, 1871, soon after his final Senate term expired. According to published accounts, he overexerted himself while helping take down a tree on the property line between his house and his neighbor's, and burst a blood vessel in his brain, which caused his death two days later. He was buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit. Family In 1835, Howard married Catherine Amelia Shaw (1810-1866) of Ware, Massachusetts. They were the parents of seven children: Edward Wellington, who died at age 3; Catherine Amelia, died at age 5; Mary Elizabeth, the wife of Dr. Joseph S. Hildreth; Colonel Jacob Merritt Jr., a Union Army veteran and businessman in Litchfield, Minnesota; Hamilton Gay, a lawyer in San Francisco; Charles Millington, a mining engineer in Salt Lake City; and Jennie, the wife of Samuel Brady, a grandson of Hugh Brady. Honors In 1866, Howard received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Williams College. In 1954, a historic marker commemorating Howard's career was placed on the lawn of the Baptist church in Shaftsbury, which later became the home of the Shaftsbury Historical Society.

Along with Oren Bloedow, she co-founded the New York band Elysian Fields. Her work is known for its emotional intensity, with her writing exploring nature, love, loss, death, myth, and identity, often with philosophical and literary influences. She has a contralto voice. Early life Jennifer was the first born child of Peter Charles (n√©e Zipken) and Jeri Charles (n√©e Valentine). She has a younger brother, Joshua. When Jennifer was an infant, her father had her birth name (and that of the whole family) changed from Zipken to Charles, which had been his professional name for years on the radio as a disc jockey, and which he had decided to change legally once his own father died. Charles is of Russian Jewish and Irish descent, and grew up in a mostly secular Jewish household. Her parents separated when she was four, and Jennifer and her brother were raised by their mother, seeing her father every two weeks. She grew up in houses filled with music, because her mother had been a classical music programmer at WMAL-FM, and because her father had been a late night jazz DJ at WAVZ out of New Haven, CT. Her mother also used to be a torch singer in Washington clubs, so Jennifer also learned early on the songs of √âdith Piaf, Ruth Etting, Marlene Dietrich, Billie Holiday, and Judy Garland. And from her grandmother, she absorbed most of the Tin Pan Alley and blues songs of the 1920s and 1930s. The music of popular AM radio at the time of her childhood was multiform, and Jennifer fell asleep with a transistor radio most nights. The homes Jennifer grew up in with her mother in Washington, D.C. were unconventional, and she was exposed to many cultures as her mother and her mother's good friend (another single mother) formed something of a group house, taking in writers and filmmakers (Stephen Jimenez and Henry Jaglom among them), and a French chef as boarders. As young children, she and her brothers would travel door to door, performing a kind of children's vaudeville act, singing Tin Pan Alley songs and tap dancing. Jennifer was a shy girl, so when she started doing children's theater at age 10, her stage debut at Trinity Theater was that of a cat who had no speaking lines but was a mime and dancer who was onstage the length of the play. It was an original role that the director let Jennifer create as she felt she did not fit into any of the written parts. She was also writing herself, and published her first poem, called \\"Riddle-Song Of The Sun,\\" that same year. At age 11, she started a newspaper with her best friend called The Pre-Teen Times where they sold subscriptions that came out quarterly. At age 12, she became passionate about the music of South Asia after her mother returned from a journey across India and Nepal with a bag full of cassettes for her, with Jagjit and Chitra Singh's The Gold Disc being her favorite. She took flamenco lessons as a young teen, and continued to do children's theater and community theater. She studied acting for a summer at Catholic University, and had principal roles in productions at Little Theatre of Alexandria, Olney Theatre Center, and Folger Shakespeare Theatre. She attended the Washington International School, where she studied Spanish and Latin, then the Edmund Burke School, a college prep school she left after she had begun working in professional theatre at Studio Theatre and Source Theatre, and the school could not accommodate her rehearsal schedule. For her last two years of high school, Jennifer attended Duke Ellington School of the Arts, where she was a theater major. An advanced academic program also landed her part-time at George Washington University, where she studied writing and anthropology. Jennifer's youth in the melting pot of Washington, D.C. was instrumental in her music influence and taste. Her mother had season tickets to the National Symphony Orchestra, which they attended on Friday nights, and her father would take her to hear live jazz at places like Blues Alley, One Step Down, and Charlie's Georgetown, where she saw the likes of Anita O'Day, Mel Torm√©, Dizzy Gillespie, Ahmad Jamal, Oscar Peterson, George Shearing, and Jamaican jazz pianist Monty Alexander. In her teens, Jennifer would often travel to New York and London, both with friends and on her own. She was turned on to the different sounds in each city - The Lounge Lizards, Diamanda Galas, Lydia Lunch, Blondie, and The Velvet Underground in New York; and The Specials, Gang of Four, Siouxsie, The Slits, The Buzzcocks, The Birthday Party, Cocteau Twins, and The Fall in the UK. But she was also steeped in the contemporary scenes of her own hometown, dancing at Tracks, Poseurs, and Badlands, and frequenting live music venues like D.C. Space, 9:30 Club, Fort Reno Park, and Cafe Lautrec to see punk bands like Bad Brains, Beefeater, and Rites of Spring. She also grew up going to go-go concerts, seeing Chuck Brown, Trouble Funk, Junk Yard Band, E.U., and Rare Essence, and went to hear Ethiopian music in the clubs and restaurants of DC's Adams Morgan neighborhood. As a junior in high school, Jennifer moved out on her own and supported herself with theater work and various odd jobs, including as an artist model at the Corcoran School of the Arts and as a singing waitress in a piano bar called The Top Hat Club. Career In 1987, she moved to New York to continue her theatre and academic studies, receiving her Bachelor of Fine Arts from NYU's Tisch school in just three years. Upon graduating she appeared in various off-broadway theater productions, had a stint singing in a dive piano bar and curated a performance/poetry series at the original Knitting Factory. Elysian Fields was founded in 1995 and have released eleven full-length records (including one produced by Steve Albini that was shelved). They have also contributed to many compilation albums, including the first song on John Zorn's Serge Gainsbourg tribute album. This song, their rendition of \\"Les Amours Perdues\\", also appeared in Lea Pool's film Emporte Moi. Besides Elysian Fields, Charles has other projects. She and Bloedow recorded La Mar Enfortuna for Zorn's Tzadik label, featuring renditions of Sephardic and Ladino songs.[ Allmusic.com] She has studied classical Indian singing with teacher Gulamji. In late 2007, she and Bloedow put out a second Tzadik full-length, under the band name La Mar Enfortuna, called \\"Conviviencia\\". Charles sings in five languages on the record, including Ladino, Spanish, Aramaic, Arabic, and Greek. Charles also makes up a quarter of the band Lovage, along with Dan the Automator, Mike Patton and Kid Koala. The band recorded its debut album titled Music to Make Love to Your Old Lady By in 2001. Charles co-wrote and sang most of the material on the album. She has also worked with bands like Firewater, turning in performances on \\"The Circus\\" and \\"Mr. Cardiac\\" from 1996's Get Off the Cross, We Need the Wood for the Fire, as well as Xian Hawkin's \\"Sybarite\\", the Foetus record, Love, as well as working with Matt Johnson of The The, and on several of John Zorn's records. Charles recorded in French with the French composer Jean-Louis Murat for the album A bird on a poire in 2004, which was nominated for a Victoires de la Musique award best pop album. She had a guest spot on ex-Nine Inch Nails drummer Chris Vrenna's solo project Tweaker. She sang and co-composed the track \\"Crude Sunlight\\", which appeared on the 2004 album 2 a.m. Wakeup Call. Charles co-composed music with Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heill (Run Lola Run) for the film Tangled. Elysian Fields' version of Bob Dylan's \\"Tangled up in Blue\\" can be heard in the film's credits. She produced the latest Oren Bloedow solo record She Goes With me to a Blossom World, which came out in 2008. Charles was back on stage in 2008 in the Off Broadway production \\"Lightning at Our Feet\\", inspired by poet Emily Dickinson, under the direction of Obie winner Bob McGrath, with film maker Bill Morrison and composer Michael Gordon, which was part of the Next Wave festival at Brooklyn Academy of Music in December 2008, where she sang and acted, channeling the iconic 19th century poet.

The frequently used Russian variant is Volgo-Uralye (). The term Idel-Ural is often used to designate 6 republics of Russia of this region: Bashkortostan, Chuvashia, Mari El, Mordovia, Tatarstan, and Udmurtia, especially in Tatar-language literature or in the context of minority languages. Idel-Ural is at the center of the Volga Federal District (–ü–æ–≤–æ–ª–∂—å–µ, Povolzhye). The major religions in the region are Islam and Orthodox Christianity. Before being conquered by the Tsardom of Russia in the 16th century, the region was dominated by native Uralic tribes and a succession of Turkic empires, such as Volga Bulgaria, the Khazars, the Golden Horde, and the Khanate of Kazan.

The ƒ†gantija temples are the earliest of the Megalithic Temples of Malta and are older than the pyramids of Egypt. Their makers erected the two ƒ†gantija temples during the Neolithic (c. 3600‚Äì2500 BC), which makes these temples more than 5500 years old and the world's second oldest existing manmade religious structures after G√∂bekli Tepe in present-day Turkey. Together with other similar structures, these have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Megalithic Temples of Malta. The temples are elements of a ceremonial site in a fertility rite. Researchers have found that the numerous figurines and statues found on site are associated with that cult. According to local Gozitan folklore, a giantess who ate nothing but broad beans and honey bore a child from a man of the common people. With the child hanging from her shoulder, she built these temples and used them as places of worship.  Description and design  ƒ†gantija as seen from the west The ƒ†gantija temples stand at the edge of the Xagƒßra plateau, facing toward the south-east. This megalithic monument encompasses two temples and an incomplete third, of which only the facade was partially built before being abandoned. Like Mnajdra South, it faces the equinox sunrise, built side by side and enclosed within a boundary wall. The southerly one is the larger and older one, dating back to approximately 3600 BC. It is also better preserved. The plan of the temple incorporates five large apses, with traces of the plaster that once covered the irregular wall still clinging between the blocks. The temples are built in the typical clover-leaf shape, with inner- facing blocks marking the shape. The space between the walls was then filled in with rubble. A series of semi-circular apses is connected with a central passage. Archaeologists believe that the apses were originally covered by roofing. The effort is a remarkable feat when considering the monuments were constructed when the wheel had not yet been introduced and no metal tools were available to the Maltese Islanders. Small, spherical stones have been discovered. They were used as ball bearings for the vehicles that transported the enormous stone blocks used for the temples. The temple, like other megalithic sites in Malta, faces southeast. The southern temple rises to a height of . At the entrance sits a large stone block with a recess, which led to the hypothesis that this was a ritual ablution station for purification before worshippers entered the complex. The five apses contain various altars. Researchers have found animal bones on the site that suggest the space was used for animal sacrifice. Excavations and recognition Watercolour painting of the temple ruins by Abraham-Louis-Rodolphe Ducros, 1778 Engraving of the temple made in 1848 Residents and travelers knew about the existence of the temple for a long time. In the late 18th-century, before any excavations were carried out, Jean-Pierre Hou√´l drew a plan based on that knowledge, which has been found to be highly accurate. In 1827 Col. John Otto Bayer, the Lieutenant Governor of Gozo, had the site cleared of debris. The soil and remains were lost without having been properly examined. German artist Charles Frederick de Brocktorff had painted a picture of the site within a year or two prior to the removal of the debris, so he made a record of the site before clearance. After the excavations were conducted in 1827, the ruins fell into decay. The remains were included on the Antiquities List of 1925. The land was held privately until 1933, when the Government expropriated it for public benefit. The Museums Department conducted extensive archaeological work in 1933, 1936, 1949, 1956‚Äì57 and 1958‚Äì59. Its goal was to clear, preserve and research the ruins and their surroundings. The ƒ†gantija temples were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980. In 1992, the Committee decided to expand the listing to include five other megalithic temples located across the islands of Malta and Gozo. The ƒ†gantija listing was renamed \\"the Megalithic Temples of Malta\\" The temple and the surrounding areas were restored or rehabilitated in the 2000s. Lightweight walkways were installed in the temple in 2011, to protect the floor. A heritage park was developed and opened in 2013.

He was the second son of Henry Dean, who was the manager of the Hawes Soap Factory in New Cross, London. William was educated at the Haberdashers' Company School. He became the Chief Locomotive Engineer for the Great Western Railway from 1877, when he succeeded Joseph Armstrong. He retired from the post in 1902 and was replaced by George Jackson Churchward. He designed famous steam locomotive classes such as the Duke Class, the Bulldog Class and the long-lived 2301 Class. Apprenticeship He was apprenticed at the age of fifteen to Joseph Armstrong at the Great Western Railway's Wolverhampton Stafford Road Works. During his eight-year apprenticeship he attended Wolverhampton Working Men's College in the evening, excelling in mathematics and engineering. Upon completion of his apprentice years in 1863 he was made Joseph Armstrong's chief assistant. Posts with GWR A year later, Joseph Armstrong was promoted to the position of the GWR's Chief Locomotive Engineer and moved to Swindon Works. George Armstrong, Joseph's brother, succeeded him as Northern Division locomotive superintendent, with Dean under him as Stafford Road works manager. This arrangement lasted until 1868, when Joseph Armstrong made Dean his chief assistant in Swindon. Upon Joseph Armstrong's sudden death of a heart attack in 1877, Dean became Chief Locomotive Engineer. Convertible locomotives At this time, the broad gauge was still in use, although conversion to standard gauge was well underway. Several of Dean's early designs were \\"convertible\\" locomotives, which could be easily rebuilt into standard gauge. Death Dean was ill during his final years as Chief Locomotive Engineer, and he increasingly allowed Churchward to take on the day-to-day responsibilities. He retired in June 1902 to a house that had been bought for him in Folkestone, but died there three years later. A street in Swindon, Dean Street, was named to commemorate Dean's contribution to locomotion engineering. It is located close to the Swindon Works site and would have housed G.W.R. workers.

Similar divergences took place in the Portuguese, Spanish and English language of the Americas with respect to European dialects, but in the case of French the separation was increased by the reduction of cultural contacts with France after the 1763 Treaty of Paris in which France ceded Canada to Great Britain. Although pronunciations like mo√© and to√© are today stigmatized (joual), they were the pronunciations of Early Modern French that were used by the kings of France, the aristocracy and the common people in many provinces of France. After the French Revolution, the standard pronunciation in France changed to that of the bourgeois class in Paris, but Quebec retained some pronunciations and expressions shared with modern O√Øl languages such as Norman, Gallo, Picard, Poitevin and Saintongeais. Speakers of those languages of France predominated among the settlers of New France.Thus, they spoke a popular language that was largely shared with Paris, but they had their own habits, words and pronunciations that were not known in Paris which are now part of everyday language in Quebec.. Quebec French was also influenced by the French spoken by the King's Daughters, who was of the petit-bourgeois class from the Paris area (√éle-de-France) as well as Normandy. Thus, the 18th-century bourgeois Parisian French that eventually became the national, standardized language of France after the French Revolution, but the French of the Ancien R√©gime kept evolving on its own in Canada. Indeed, the French spoken in Canada is closer idiomatically and phonetically to Belgian French, despite their independent evolution and the relatively small number of Belgian immigrants to Quebec (although it is to be remembered that the influence of the Walloon language in Belgium has influenced the language in the same way as the presence of the O√Øl speakers in Quebec). There is also the undeniable fact that Canadian-French speakers have lived alongside and among English speakers ever since the beginning of British administration, in 1763. Thus, anglicisms in Quebec French tend to be longstanding and part of a gradual, natural process of borrowing, but the unrelated anglicisms in European French are nearly all much more recent and sometimes driven by fads and fashions. Some people (for instance, L√©andre Bergeron, author of the Dictionnaire de la langue qu√©b√©coise) have referred to Quebec French as la langue qu√©b√©coise (the Qu√©b√©cois language); most speakers, however, would reject or even take offence to the idea that they do not speak French.  New France  The French language established itself permanently in North America with the foundation of Quebec City by Samuel de Champlain in 1608. However, it was after the creation of the Sovereign Council of New France in 1663 that the colonies really started to develop. Between 1627 and 1663, a few thousand colonists landed in New France, either in Acadia or Canada. The provinces that contributed the most to these migrations were those in the northern and western regions of France. The migrants came from Normandy, Aunis, Perche, Brittany, Paris and √éle-de-France, Poitou, Maine, Saintonge, and Anjou, most of those being regions where French was seldom spoken at the time (see article Languages of France). According to Philippe Barbaud (1984], the first colonists were therefore mostly non-francophone except for the immigrants from the Paris area, who most likely spoke a popular form of French; and the following dialect clash (choc des patois) brought about the linguistic unification of Quebec. Among the speakers of Norman, Picard, Aunis, Poitevin and Saintongeais and the Celtic language Breton, many might have understood French as a second language. Gradually, a linguistic transfer towards French occurred, leading to the linguistic unification of all the ethnic groups coming from France. According to Henri Wittmann (1997) (based on earlier work of his), the overwhelming similarities between the different varieties of Colonial French clearly show that the linguistic unity triggering dialect clash occurred before the colonists exported their French into the colonies of the 17th and 18th centuries; and that the koin√©-forming dialect clash must have occurred in Paris and other related urban centers of France. In any event, according to contemporary sources, the Canadians were all speaking French natively by the end of the 17th century, long before France itself outside its large urban centers.For a bibliography on that issue, see Dulong (1966).  British regime  On September 13, 1759, Quebec City, then the political capital of New France, was taken by the British Army. New France fell a year later. According to the terms of 1760 Articles of Capitulation of Montreal, the French Army was to leave the conquered territory. The ruling elite (French nobles and leading merchants) also left. Ordinary people, the Roman Catholic clergy, lesser merchants, and some members of the civil administration, the majority having born in Canada, stayed in the country. Those who stayed were to become British subjects. Soon, British General Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst, established a military government, which was to last until 1763. The military occupation led to the establishment of a provisional administration. Because the fate of the country was still uncertain, no political actions were really undertaken to transform, and the status quo prevailed. Because the population was unable to understand English, it was decided that ordinances would be published in French. To do so, numerous Canadians were permitted to participate in the administration of justice. In 1763, France ceded Canada to Great Britain in the Treaty of Paris. Rapidly, the new ruling elite planned its future for the French-speaking colonists, who were to be absorbed into the English-speaking society of British North America, but they were to be allowed the right of Catholic worship under the terms of the treaty. On October 7, the British Royal Proclamation of 1763 set the new political conditions of Canada. The territory of the colony, renamed the Province of Quebec, was reduced to the inhabited area along the Saint Lawrence River. James Murray was appointed governor and became responsible for enforcing the new policy concerning the colony. His tasks were to encourage British immigration; establish the official religion, Anglicanism; and the administrative and legal structures of England. Time brought the gradual establishment of anglophone British officials and colonists. Trade quickly passed on to British and British-American merchants, who migrated to Quebec City, Trois-Rivi√®res, and Montreal. French, until then the lingua franca in all aspects of social life, was quickly relegated to the second rank in trade and government. The educated classes began French-English bilingualism by necessity. The Quebec Act of 1774 granted many of the requests of the Canadians, who had been petitioning the British crown for the restoration of French civil laws and guarantees as to the usage of their language and faith. = American Revolution = = Union and Confederation = Notes  References  = In English = * Plourde, Michel and Pierre Georgeault, ed.

Biography Edwin Tappan Adney was born in Athens, Ohio, the eldest child of William Harvey Glenn Adney (1834‚Äì1885) from Vinton, Ohio, a professor at Ohio University, and Ruth Clementine Shaw Adney. When Edwin was five, the family moved to Washington, Pennsylvania where his father taught at Washington and Jefferson College. In 1879, his father retired from that position for health reasons and bought a tobacco farm near Pittsboro, North Carolina named Gum Spring Plantation. Edwin was exceptionally bright and entered the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill at the age of thirteen, where he remained for two years.

To earn a living, she ran a boarding house, where Edwin got to know his future wife Minnie Bell Sharp of Woodstock, New Brunswick, a piano and singing student, who was one of his mother's tenants. Edwin attended Trinity School and after leaving school he worked in a law office. In the evenings he took art classes at the Art Students League of New York.Michael Gates (Oct. 2, 2009) \\"The naked truth about Tappan Adney\\", Yukon News Illustration from Handbook of Birds of Eastern North America 1897 He graduated from art school at the age of eighteen and provided 110 illustrations for The Handbook of the Birds of Eastern North America.Michael Gates (2014) \\"Tappan Adney and the Klondike Stampede\\", Western New York Public BroadcastingFrank Michler Chapman (1897) Handbook of Birds of Eastern North America, D.

Adney intended to spend a month in Woodstock preparing for the entry examination for Columbia University. While in Woodstock, he met Peter Jo, a Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet) canoe-builder. He became interested in the language and culture and with Joseph's help, he built his first canoe, spending twenty months in Woodstock. In 1890, he wrote an article on canoe-building for a Harper's Young People supplement. He was credited with saving the art of birchbark canoe construction. He built more than 100 models of different types, which are now housed at the Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Virginia.C. T.

Although the original words are unknown, the melody was recorded c. 1615‚Äì1625 in the John Skene of Halyards Manuscript as \\"Flowres of the Forrest\\", although it might have been composed earlier.Skene mandora manuscript, Edinburgh, National Library of Scotland ms adv.5.2.15 Several versions of words have been added to the tune, notably Jean Elliot's lyrics in 1756 or 1758. Others include those by Alison Cockburn below. However, many renditions are played on the Great Highland bagpipe. Due to the content of the lyrics and the reverence for the tune, it is one of the few tunes that many pipers will perform in public only at funerals or memorial services, with play otherwise limited to private practice or to instruct other pipers. The Air The tune is a simple modal melody. Typical of old Scottish tunes it is entirely pentatonic, with the dramatic exception of the 3rd and 5th notes of the second line which are the flattened 7th. Jean Elliot's lyrics Jean Elliot (b. 1727), aided in part by popular poetry selections, framed the tune in 1756 as a lament to the deaths of James IV, many of his nobles, and over 10,000 men - the titular \\"Flowers of the Forest\\" - at the Battle of Flodden Field in northern England in 1513, a significant event in the history of Scotland. She published it anonymously and it was at the time thought to be an ancient surviving ballad. However, Burns suspected it was an imitation, and together with Ramsay and Sir Walter Scott eventually discovered its author. The song, written in Scots, is also known as The Floo'ers o' the Forest (are a' wede away) and describes the grief of women and children at the loss of their young men. In some ways the song echoes the Old Welsh poem Y Gododdin about a similar defeat in about 600. Powerful solo bagpipe versions of the song are used at services of remembrance, funerals, and other occasions; many in the Commonwealth know the tune simply as \\"The Lament\\" which is played at Remembrance Day or Remembrance Sunday ceremonies to commemorate war dead. The first verse of the song contrasts happier times with grief at the losses: ::I've heard the lilting, at the yowe-milking, ::Lassies a-lilting before dawn o' day; ::But now they are moaning on ilka green loaning; ::\\"The Flowers of the Forest are a' wede away\\". ::... ::Dool and wae for the order sent oor lads tae the Border! ::The English for ance, by guile wan the day, ::The Flooers o' the Forest, that fought aye the foremost, ::The pride o' oor land lie cauld in the clay. The song is mentioned in The Scots Musical Museum as The flowres of the Forrest, and the air (or tune) apparently survived, but several versions of the words were written down later, the most usual being by Jean Elliot published about 1755 - see links below. Alison Cockburn's lyrics In 1765 the wit and socialite Alison Cockburn published her lyrics to the Flowers of the Forest beginning \\"I've seen the smiling of Fortune beguiling\\" said to have been written before her marriage in 1731 . It concerns a financial crisis that had ruined the fortunes of a number of the Selkirk Lairds. Later biographers, however, think it probable that it was written on the departure to London of a certain John Aikman, with whom Alison appears to have had an early attachment. The first verse runs: Modern usage Both versions of the song are part of the traditional music at Selkirk Common Riding which in part commemorates the loss at Flodden. Jean Elliot's version is known in the town as \\"The Liltin\\" and is played after the Casting of the Colours ceremony. Alison Cockburn's version is played as a march by the town band but is also the version more often sung; it is the version known in Selkirk as \\"The Flo'ers o' the Forest\\". It was played at the funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901, which explains its subsequent popularity. In late 1942, according to the late Duchess of Windsor's Memoir, The Duke of Windsor asked that it be played at the funeral of his brother, the Duke of Kent, who was killed in a plane crash in the Highlands. Apparently it was a personal favourite of Prince George, Duke of Kent. The song is heavily referenced in the novel Sunset Song by Lewis Grassic Gibbon and features in the 2015 film of the same name, including a rendition by Agyness Deyn, who plays the lead character, Chris Guthrie. The song is quoted at the beginning and end of the historical novel The Flowers of the Forest by Elizabeth Byrd, which culminates in the Battle of Flodden. It is the official lament of the Canadian Forces, played to honour fallen soldiers. https://www.canada.ca/en/services/defence/caf/showcasing/music/music- commemorative-ceremonies.html The English folk-rock band Fairport Convention covered the song on their 1970 album Full House. The tune was played by a lone piper at the funeral of singer songwriter Sandy Denny. Scottish tenor Kenneth McKellar recorded a version of the song. Scots/Australian singer-songwriter Eric Bogle refers to \\"Flowers of the Forest\\" in his song \\"No Man's Land\\", in which he muses over the grave of a World War I soldier, and wonders whether \\"Flowers of the Forest\\" and \\"Last Post\\" were played at the soldier's burial. English folk singer June Tabor recorded Bogle's song followed by an instrumental version of \\"Flowers of the Forest\\" on the album Ashes and Diamonds (1977). An excerpt from J. Elliot's lyrics to this song was used in John McGrath's play Border Warfare (1989).Publ. in McGrath, Six-pack: Plays for Scotland, Edinburgh: Polygon 1996, 1-138, here 40 f. Australian singer- songwriter Graham Dodsworth recorded a version of the song with Irish/Australian singer Claire Peters on his 1998 folk music album In Good King Arthur's Day. Michael Nyman sped up and re-edited the song as part of the score of The Piano. English musician Mike Oldfield covered the song on his 1996 album, Voyager. The track 'Flowers of the Town' by the English folk band The Unthanks is based on this song but it laments the loss of young men in the First World War. The lyrics of this version are almost identical to the first of \\"Two Songs\\" by Cecil Day-Lewis.The Complete Poems of C. Day Lewis, Stanford University Press (1992) , p. 195 In 2007, Scottish singer Isla St Clair was invited to sing Flowers of the Forest at Tyne Cot Cemetery in Flanders, Belgium to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the Battle of Passchendaele, in the First World War. The ceremony was attended by Queen Elizabeth II and Queen Paola, as well as other European Heads of State and Commonwealth Representatives. She also recorded the lament in 1998, for the album When the Pipers Play and again in 2011, for the Scots Guards album From Helmand To Horse Guards. It is standard practice in the British and Canadian military to use this tune to mark the death of a soldier in Afghanistan during the official memorial service. The Australian War Memorial uses the song during its Last Post ceremony. The Forest The Forest, was a district and Royal forest comprising Selkirkshire (alternatively known as Ettrick Forest or the Shire of the Forest), large parts of Peeblesshire and parts of Clydesdale, known for its archers.

Its name derives from aurum, the Latin word for gold. In its early days, it was also known variously as Dean, Deans, Nuckollsville, and Scuffle Town.] History Thousands of settlers came to these former Cherokee lands in search of gold during the Georgia Gold Rush, and following the Gold Lottery of 1832. One of the first gold rush boom towns started here in June 1832, when William Dean built a cabin between the Chestatee River and Etowah River. The temporary seat of Lumpkin County in 1832, Nathaniel Nuckolls built a tavern, hotel, and several buildings to house the miners. Within six months of the lottery, \\"one hundred family dwellings, eighteen or twenty stores, twelve or fifteen law offices, and four or five taverns\\" were to be found in the town. The population was 1,000 by May 1833, and 10,000 were in the county. The land east of Auraria was purchased by Vice President John C. Calhoun, and there he established the Calhoun Mine. A traveling companion of Calhoun, Dr. Croft, suggested the town be renamed Aureola, in Nov. 1832. The town citizens picked Auraria, suggested by John Powell. The banks of the Etowah River, Camp Creek, and Cane Creek had many mines (Barlow Mine, Battle Branch Mine, Ralston Mine, Whim Hill Mine, Hedwig-Chicago Mine, Gold Hill Mine Etowah Mine, and others). The 40-acre gold lot on which most of Auraria stood was won by John R. Plummer, but his right to participate in the lottery was questioned. Faced with this legal challenge, the Inferior Court judges picked the site north of Auraria near the Cane Creek minining area. Auraria experienced a sharp decline as businesses and county offices relocated. The first session of the Superior Court of Lumpkin County met in what became known as Dahlonega, Georgia on Aug. 22, 1833. Due to its location and political influence, Dahlonega received a Federal Mint for gold coins. In 1848, gold was discovered in California. Former Auraria resident Jennie Wimmer, a cook in rural California, was the first person to prove the gold's authenticity,Williams, David, 1993, The Georgia Gold Rush: Twenty-Niners, Cherokees, and Gold Fever, Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, because she was the only person on the scene who knew how to perform the proper tests. This discovery led to the California gold rush of 1849. Discoveries of gold in California and soon after in Colorado caused Auraria to eventually fade into history. Gold mining in Georgia decreased and eventually all but ceased as miners went west looking for uncharted prospecting. Auraria's population quickly dwindled, and the community deteriorated. William Greeneberry Russell and a party of men of Auraria who left for Kansas Territory formed the settlement of Auraria in 1858; the town later merged with Denver, Colorado. A home in Auraria Present day There are still a few old buildings standing: the collapsing Graham Hotel (in ruins; very unsafe to enter); Woody's store at Castleberry Bridge Road, that remained open till the early 1980s; a red house that was once a bank; another house across the street; and a couple of foundations. They stand in lone testament to the 19th century gold rush. Geography Auraria is located at , at an elevation of 1401 feet (427m) To get to Auraria, go to the square in Dahlonega. Follow the west road to Dawsonville, pass the college (the gold-domed building is built on the foundation of the old mint). Turn left at the bottom of that hill and continue about 3 miles. The old red house on the left is the bank; after it, the collapsing building is the old hotel and just beyond on the left is the old Woody's store.

Discovery of water in the soil at the lunar poles by Chandrayaan-1 (ISRO) in 2008‚Äì09 renewed interest in the Moon, after NASA missions in the 1990s suggested the presence of lunar ice. Locating a colony at one of the lunar poles would also avoid the problem of long lunar nights‚Äîabout 354 hours long, half a lunar month‚Äîand allow the colony to take advantage of the continuous sunlight there for generating solar power.BBC NEWS Lunar mountain has eternal light Permanent human habitation on a planetary body other than the Earth is one of science fiction's most prevalent themes. As technology has advanced, and concerns about the future of humanity on Earth have increased, the vision of space colonization as an achievable and worthwhile goal has gained momentum. Because of its proximity to Earth, the Moon is seen by many as the best and most obvious location for the first permanent human space colony. Currently, the main problem hindering the development of such a colony is the high cost of human spaceflight. There are also several projects that have been proposed for tourism on the Moon in the near future by private space companies.  Proposals  The notion of a lunar colony originated before the Space Age. In 1638, Bishop John Wilkins wrote A Discourse Concerning a New World and Another Planet, in which he predicted a human colony on the Moon. Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (1857‚Äì1935), among others, also suggested such a step. From the 1950s onwards, a number of more concrete concepts and designs have been suggested by scientists, engineers and others. In 1954, science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke proposed a lunar base of inflatable modules covered in lunar dust for insulation. A spaceship assembled in low Earth orbit would launch to the Moon, and astronauts would set up the igloo-like modules and an inflatable radio mast. Subsequent steps would include the establishment of a larger, permanent dome; an algae-based air purifier; a nuclear reactor for the provision of power; and electromagnetic cannons to launch cargo and fuel to interplanetary vessels in space. In 1959, John S. Rinehart suggested that the safest design would be a structure that could \\"[float] in a stationary ocean of dust\\", since there were, at the time this concept was outlined, theories that there could be mile-deep dust oceans on the Moon. The proposed design consisted of a half- cylinder with half-domes at both ends, with a micrometeoroid shield placed above the base. =NASA= The United States space administration NASA has requested an increase in the 2020 budget of $1.6 billion, in order to make another crewed mission to the Moon by 2024, followed by a sustained presence on the Moon by 2028. NASA is ready to announce plans to bring together a Commercial Human Lander Awards for Artemis Missions on the Moon. This specific program, ‚ÄúThe Artemis Program,‚Äù encompasses NASA‚Äôs overview for lunar exploration plans. This announcement will go over the first in a series of many more to come complex missions. Artemis I will start off as an un-crewed flight test to demonstrate the capabilities of NASA‚Äôs Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion spacecraft. The first flight with a crew will be Artemis II, closely followed by Artemis III that will actually land crew on the moon by the end of 2024 using a new commercially-procured Human Landing System (HLS).

It was proposed that the first landing would be carried out by two \\"soldier-astronauts\\" in 1965 and that more construction workers would soon follow. It was posited that through numerous launches (61 Saturn Is and 88 Saturn C-2s), 245 tons of cargo could be transported to the outpost by 1966. = Lunex Project = Lunex Project was a US Air Force plan for a crewed lunar landing prior to the Apollo Program in 1961. It envisaged a 21-person underground Air Force base on the Moon by 1968 at a total cost of $7.5 billion. = Sub-surface base = In 1962, John DeNike and Stanley Zahn published their idea of a sub-surface base located at the Sea of Tranquility. This base would house a crew of 21, in modules placed four meters below the surface, which was believed to provide radiation shielding on par with Earth's atmosphere. DeNike and Zahn favored nuclear reactors for energy production, because they were more efficient than solar panels, and would also overcome the problems with the long lunar nights. For the life support system, an algae-based gas exchanger was proposed. = Zvezda = 3D representation of the planned Zvezda base by the Soviet Union Zvezda moonbase (, \\"star\\") was a Soviet plan and project from 1962 to 1974 to construct a crewed moonbase as successor to the N1-L3 crewed lunar expedition program. The project was ordered by the Soviet space chief Korolyov to Barmin's Spetcmash bureau. The project was named DLB Lunar Base in technical specifications and Zvezda in government documents. Unofficially, the project was called Barmingrad (Barmin's city) by its designers. The realization of the project depended on key parts of the N1-L3 program - the N-1 superheavy launcher, all 4 launches of which failed between 1969 and 1972. Zvezda moonbase was canceled with the rest of the Soviet human lunar programs. All crewed Soviet lunar programs, including a Zvezda moonbase, had been classified as top secret and were only published in the glasnost epoch since 1990. =Moon Village= Scale model of one moon base concept at the Euro Space Center in Belgium The Moon Village (fr) concept was presented in 2015.Should we build a village on the Moon? Richard Hollingham, BBC News. 1 July 2015. 'Village' in this context refers to international public and private investors, scientists, engineers, universities, and businessmen coming together to discuss interests and capabilities to build and share infrastructure on the Moon and in cislunar space for a variety of purposes. It is neither an ESA project nor a program, but being organized, loosely, by a nonprofit organization seeking to give a platform for an open international architecture and collaboration.

Instead, the concept is being organized, loosely, by a nonprofit organization established in November 2017 called the Moon Village Association. It is a non-profit organization, registered in Vienna, with the mission to create a global forum for the development of the Moon Village, and to potentially implement a permanent human settlement near the lunar south pole, taking advantage of near-continuous sunlight and nearby deposits of ice and other useful volatiles. = Other proposals = Astronauts entering a lunar outpost. NASA concept art. In 2007, Jim Burke, of the International Space University in France, said people should plan to preserve humanity's culture in the event of a civilization-stopping asteroid impact with Earth. A Lunar Noah's Ark was proposed. Subsequent planning may be taken up by the International Lunar Exploration Working Group (ILEWG).  Moon exploration  = Exploration through 2019 = Exploration of the lunar surface by spacecraft began in 1959 with the Soviet Union's Luna program. Luna 1 missed the Moon, but Luna 2 made a hard landing (impact) into its surface, and became the first artificial object on an extraterrestrial body. The same year, the Luna 3 mission radioed photographs to Earth of the Moon's hitherto unseen far side, marking the beginning of a decade-long series of robotic lunar explorations. Responding to the Soviet program of space exploration, US President John F. Kennedy in 1961 told the US Congress on May 25: \\"I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\\" The same year the Soviet leadership made some of its first public pronouncements about landing a man on the Moon and establishing a lunar base. Crewed exploration of the lunar surface began in 1968 when the Apollo 8 spacecraft orbited the Moon with three astronauts on board. This was mankind's first direct view of the far side. The following year, the Apollo 11 Apollo Lunar Module landed two astronauts on the Moon, proving the ability of humans to travel to the Moon, perform scientific research work there, and bring back sample materials. Additional missions to the Moon continued this exploration phase. In 1969, the Apollo 12 mission landed next to the Surveyor 3 spacecraft, demonstrating precision landing capability. The use of a crewed vehicle on the Moon's surface was demonstrated in 1971 with the Lunar Roving Vehicle during Apollo 15\\\\. Apollo 16 made the first landing within the rugged lunar highlands. However, interest in further exploration of the Moon was beginning to wane among the American public. In 1972, Apollo 17 was the final Apollo lunar mission, and further planned missions were scrapped at the directive of President Nixon. Instead, focus was turned to the Space Shuttle and crewed missions in near Earth orbit. In addition to its scientific returns, the Apollo program also provided valuable lessons about living and working in the lunar environment. The Soviet crewed lunar programs failed to send a crewed mission to the Moon. However, in 1966 Luna 9 was the first probe to achieve a soft landing and return close-up shots of the lunar surface. Luna 16 in 1970 returned the first Soviet lunar soil samples, while in 1970 and 1973 during the Lunokhod program two robotic rovers landed on the Moon. Lunokhod 1 explored the lunar surface for 322 days, and Lunokhod 2 operated on the Moon about four months only but covered a third more distance. 1974 saw the end of the Soviet Moonshot, two years after the last American crewed landing. Besides the crewed landings, an abandoned Soviet Moon program included building the moonbase \\"Zvezda\\", which was the first detailed project with developed mockups of expedition vehicles and surface modules. In the decades following, interest in exploring the Moon faded considerably, and only a few dedicated enthusiasts supported a return. However, evidence of lunar ice at the poles gathered by NASA's Clementine (1994) and Lunar Prospector (1998) missions rekindled some discussion,Lunar Prospector finds evidence of ice at Moon's poles, NASA, March 5, 1998 as did the potential growth of a Chinese space program that contemplated its own mission to the Moon. Subsequent research suggested that there was far less ice present (if any) than had originally been thought, but that there may still be some usable deposits of hydrogen in other forms. However, in September 2009, the Chandrayaan probe of India, carrying an ISRO instrument, discovered that the lunar soil contains 0.1% water by weight, overturning hypotheses that had stood for 40 years.Chandrayaan finds Lunar water, BBC, September 25, 2009 In 2004, US President George W. Bush called for a plan to return crewed missions to the Moon by 2020 (since cancelled ‚Äì see Constellation program). On June 18, 2009, NASA's LCROSS/LRO mission to the Moon was launched. The LCROSS mission was designed to acquire research information to assist with future lunar exploratory missions and was scheduled to conclude with a controlled collision of the craft on the lunar surface. LCROSS's mission concluded as scheduled with its controlled impact on October 9, 2009. In 2010, due to reduced congressional NASA appropriations, President Barack Obama halted the Bush administration's earlier lunar exploration initiative and directed a generic focus on crewed missions to asteroids and Mars, as well as extending support for the International Space Station. In 2019 President Trump had called for a crewed Moon mission in 2024 to be the focus of NASA instead of 2028 as in the original timetable. A plan for a 2024 landing was submitted to Congress August 2019 but has failed to get funding and plans agreed. = Planned crewed lunar missions 2021‚Äì36 = Japan has plans to land a man on the Moon by 2030,Japan wants to put a man on the moon, accelerating Asian space race by Ben Westcott and Junko Ogura.

Initial funding for Open Lunar was .The Silicon Valley Heavyweights Who Want to Settle the Moon, Ashlee Vance, Bloomberg, 5 September 2019, accessed 13 September 2019.  Lunar water ice  Video of the lunar south pole, showing areas of permanent shadow over several months (several lunar days) On September 24, 2009, Science magazine reported that the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) on the Indian Space Research Organization's (ISRO) Chandrayaan-1 had detected water on the Moon. M3 detected absorption features near on the surface of the Moon. For silicate bodies, such features are typically attributed to hydroxyl- and/or water- bearing materials. On the Moon, the feature is seen as a widely distributed absorption that appears strongest at cooler high latitudes and at several fresh feldspathic craters. The general lack of correlation of this feature in sunlit M3 data with neutron spectrometer H abundance data suggests that the formation and retention of OH and H2O is an ongoing surficial process. OH/H2O production processes may feed polar cold traps and make the lunar regolith a candidate source of volatiles for human exploration. The Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3), an imaging spectrometer, was one of the 11 instruments on board Chandrayaan-1, whose mission came to a premature end on 29 August 2009. 101004 isro.org M3 was aimed at providing the first mineral map of the entire lunar surface. Lunar scientists had discussed the possibility of water repositories for decades. They are now increasingly \\"confident that the decades-long debate is over\\" a report says. \\"The Moon, in fact, has water in all sorts of places; not just locked up in minerals, but scattered throughout the broken-up surface, and, potentially, in blocks or sheets of ice at depth.\\" The results from the Chandrayaan mission are also \\"offering a wide array of watery signals.\\" On November 13, 2009, NASA announced that the LCROSS mission had discovered large quantities of water ice on the Moon around the LCROSS impact site at Cabeus. Robert Zubrin, president of the Mars Society, relativized the term 'large': \\"The 30 m crater ejected by the probe contained 10 million kilograms of regolith. Within this ejecta, an estimated 100 kg of water was detected. That represents a proportion of ten parts per million, which is a lower water concentration than that found in the soil of the driest deserts of the Earth. In contrast, we have found continent sized regions on Mars, which are 600,000 parts per million, or 60% water by weight.\\" Although the Moon is very dry on the whole, the spot where the LCROSS impactor hit was chosen for a high concentration of water ice. Dr. Zubrin's computations are not a sound basis for estimating the percentage of water in the regolith at that site. Researchers with expertise in that area estimated that the regolith at the impact site contained 5.6 ¬± 2.9% water ice, and also noted the presence of other volatile substances. Hydrocarbons, material containing sulfur, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane and ammonia were present.PSRD CosmoSparks Report--An Icy Treat In March 2010, ISRO reported that the findings of its mini-SAR radar aboard Chandrayaan-1 were consistent with ice deposits at the Moon's north pole. It is estimated there is at least 600 million tons of ice at the north pole in sheets of relatively pure ice at least a couple of meters thick.Bill Keeter: NASA Radar Finds Ice Deposits at Moon's North Pole ‚Äì Additional evidence of water activity on moon. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, March 2, 2010, retrieved June 27, 2011 In March 2014, researchers who had previously published reports on possible abundance of water on the Moon, reported new findings that refined their predictions substantially lower.BBC News Paul Rincon: Doubt cast on evidence for wet Moon In 2018, it was announced that M3 infrared data from Chandrayaan-1 had been re-analyzed to confirm the existence of water across wide expanses of the Moon's polar regions. The Chinese lander Chang'e 4 and its rover Yutu 2 are on the lunar surface on the far side of the Moon in the South Pole-Aitken Basin, analyzing the lunar surface to assist in the search for water.  Advantages and disadvantages  Colonizing a natural body would provide an ample source of material for construction and other uses in space, including shielding from cosmic radiation. The energy required to send objects from the Moon to space is much less than from Earth to space. This could allow the Moon to serve as a source of construction materials within cis-lunar space. Rockets launched from the Moon would require less locally produced propellant than rockets launched from Earth. Some proposals include using electric acceleration devices (mass drivers) to propel objects off the Moon without building rockets. Others have proposed momentum exchange tethers (see below). Furthermore, the Moon does have some gravity, which experience to date indicates may be vital for fetal development and long-term human health. Whether the Moon's gravity (roughly one sixth of Earth's) is adequate for this purpose, however, is uncertain. In addition, the Moon is the closest large body in the Solar System to Earth. While some Earth-crosser asteroids occasionally pass closer, the Moon's distance is consistently within a small range close to 384,400 km. This proximity has several advantages: *Building observatory facilities on the Moon from lunar materials allows many of the benefits of space based facilities without the need to launch these into space. The lunar soil, although it poses a problem for any moving parts of telescopes, can be mixed with carbon nanotubes and epoxies in the construction of mirrors up to 50 meters in diameter. It is relatively nearby; astronomical seeing is not a concern; certain craters near the poles are permanently dark and cold, and thus especially useful for infrared telescopes; and radio telescopes on the far side would be shielded from the radio chatter of Earth. A lunar zenith telescope can be made cheaply with ionic liquid. * A farm at the lunar north pole could provide eight hours of sunlight per day during the local summer by rotating crops in and out of the sunlight which is continuous for the entire summer. A beneficial temperature, radiation protection, insects for pollination, and all other plant needs could be artificially provided during the local summer for a cost. One estimate suggested a 0.5 hectare space farm could feed 100 people. There are several disadvantages to the Moon as a colony site: * The long lunar night would impede reliance on solar power and require that a colony exposed to the sunlit equatorial surface be designed to withstand large temperature extremes (about to about ). An exception to this restriction are the so-called \\"peaks of eternal light\\" located at the lunar north pole that are constantly bathed in sunlight. The rim of Shackleton Crater, towards the lunar south pole, also has a near-constant solar illumination. Other areas near the poles that get light most of the time could be linked in a power grid. The temperature 1 meter below the surface of the Moon is estimated to be near constant over the period of a month varying with latitude from near at the equator to near at the poles.McGRAW-HILL ENCYCLOPEDIA OF Science & Technology, vol 11, 8th Edition, (c) 1997, p. 470 * The Moon is highly depleted in volatile elements, such as nitrogen and hydrogen. Carbon, which forms volatile oxides, is also depleted. A number of robot probes including Lunar Prospector gathered evidence of hydrogen generally in the Moon's crust consistent with what would be expected from solar wind, and higher concentrations near the poles. There had been some disagreement whether the hydrogen must necessarily be in the form of water. The 2009 mission of the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) proved that there is water on the Moon.Jonas Dino: LCROSS Impact Data Indicates Water on Moon. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, November 13, 2009, retrieved June 23, 2011 This water exists in ice form perhaps mixed in small crystals in the regolith in a colder landscape than has ever been mined. Other volatiles containing carbon and nitrogen were found in the same cold trap as ice. If no sufficient means is found for recovering these volatiles on the Moon, they would need to be imported from some other source to support life and industrial processes. Volatiles would need to be stringently recycled. This would limit the colony's rate of growth and keep it dependent on imports. Transport costs would be reduced by a lunar space elevator if and when one can be constructed. *The 2006 announcement by the Keck Observatory that the binary Trojan asteroid 617 Patroclus, and possibly large numbers of other Trojan objects in Jupiter's orbit, are likely composed of water ice, with a layer of dust, and the hypothesized large amounts of water ice on the closer, main-belt asteroid 1 Ceres, suggest that importing volatiles from this region via the Interplanetary Transport Network may be practical in the not-so-distant future. However, these possibilities are dependent on complicated and expensive resource utilization from the mid to outer Solar System, which is not likely to become available to a Moon colony for a significant period of time. * The lack of a substantial atmosphere for insulation results in temperature extremes and makes the Moon's surface conditions somewhat like a deep space vacuum with surface pressure (night) of 3 √ó 10‚àí15 bar. It also leaves the lunar surface exposed to half as much radiation as in interplanetary space (with the other half blocked by the Moon itself underneath the colony), raising the issues of the health threat from cosmic rays and the risk of proton exposure from the solar wind. Lunar rubble can protect living quarters from cosmic rays.NASA, A Tour of the Colony Shielding against solar flares during expeditions outside is more problematic. * When the Moon passes through the magnetotail of the Earth, the plasma sheet whips across its surface. Electrons crash into the Moon and are released again by UV photons on the day side but build up voltages on the dark side.NASA The Moon and the Magnetotail This causes a negative charge build up from ‚àí200 V to ‚àí1000 V. See Magnetic field of the Moon. * Moon dust is an extremely abrasive glassy substance formed by micrometeorites and unrounded due to the lack of weathering. It sticks to everything, can damage equipment, and it may be toxic. Since it is bombarded by charged particles in the solar wind, it is highly ionized, and is extremely harmful when breathed in. During the 1960s and 1970s Apollo missions, astronauts were subject to respiratory problems on return flights from the Moon, for this reason. * Growing crops on the Moon faces many difficult challenges due to the long lunar night (354 hours), extreme variation in surface temperature, exposure to solar flares, soil with almost no nitrogen and little potassium, and lack of insects for pollination. Due to the lack of any atmosphere of substance on the Moon, plants would need to be grown in sealed chambers, though experiments have shown that plants can thrive at pressures much lower than those on Earth. The use of electric lighting to compensate for the 354-hour night might be difficult: a single acre (0.405 hectare) of plants on Earth enjoys a peak 4 megawatts of sunlight power at noon. Experiments conducted by the Soviet space program in the 1970s suggest it is possible to grow conventional crops with the 354-hour light, 354-hour dark cycle. A variety of concepts for lunar agriculture have been proposed, including the use of minimal artificial light to maintain plants during the night and the use of fast-growing crops that might be started as seedlings with artificial light and be harvestable at the end of one lunar day. An experiment in the Chinese Chang'e 4 lunar lander mission demonstrated that seeds could sprout and grow in protected conditions on the Moon (January 2019). The cotton seeds were able to handle the harsh conditions, at least initially, becoming the first plants ever to sprout on the surface of another world. But without a source of heat, the plants died in the cold lunar night.  Locations  Soviet astronomer Vladislav V. Shevchenko proposed in 1988 the following three criteria that a lunar outpost should meet: * good conditions for transport operations; * a great number of different types of natural objects and features on the Moon of scientific interest; and * natural resources, such as oxygen. The abundance of certain minerals, such as iron oxide, varies dramatically over the lunar surface.Composition of the Moon's Crust by Linda M. V. Martel. Hawai'i Institute of Geophysics and Planetology While a colony might be located anywhere, potential locations for a lunar colony fall into three broad categories. = Polar regions = There are two reasons why the north pole and south pole of the Moon might be attractive locations for a human colony. First, there is evidence for the presence of water in some continuously shaded areas near the poles. Second, the Moon's axis of rotation is sufficiently close to being perpendicular to the ecliptic plane that the radius of the Moon's polar circles is less than 50 km. Power collection stations could therefore be plausibly located so that at least one is exposed to sunlight at all times, thus making it possible to power polar colonies almost exclusively with solar energy. Solar power would be unavailable only during a lunar eclipse, but these events are relatively brief and absolutely predictable. Any such colony would therefore require a reserve energy supply that could temporarily sustain a colony during lunar eclipses or in the event of any incident or malfunction affecting solar power collection. Hydrogen fuel cells would be ideal for this purpose, since the hydrogen needed could be sourced locally using the Moon's polar water and surplus solar power. Moreover, due to the Moon's uneven surface some sites have nearly continuous sunlight. For example, Malapert mountain, located near the Shackleton crater at the lunar south pole, offers several advantages as a site: *It is exposed to the Sun most of the time (see Peak of Eternal Light); two closely spaced arrays of solar panels would receive nearly continuous power. *Its proximity to Shackleton Crater (116 km, or 69.8 mi) means that it could provide power and communications to the crater. This crater is potentially valuable for astronomical observation. An infrared instrument would benefit from the very low temperatures. A radio telescope would benefit from being shielded from Earth's broad spectrum radio interference. *The nearby Shoemaker and other craters are in constant deep shadow, and might contain valuable concentrations of hydrogen and other volatiles. *At around elevation, it offers line of sight communications over a large area of the Moon, as well as to Earth. *The South Pole-Aitken basin is located at the lunar south pole. This is the second largest known impact basin in the Solar System, as well as the oldest and biggest impact feature on the Moon, and should provide geologists access to deeper layers of the Moon's crust. It is where the Chinese Chang‚Äôe 4 has landed, on the far side. NASA chose to use a south-polar site for the lunar outpost reference design in the Exploration Systems Architecture Study chapter on lunar architecture. At the north pole, the rim of Peary Crater has been proposed as a favorable location for a base. Examination of images from the Clementine mission in 1994 appear to show that parts of the crater rim are permanently illuminated by sunlight (except during lunar eclipses). As a result, the temperature conditions are expected to remain very stable at this location, averaging . This is comparable to winter conditions in Earth's Poles of Cold in Siberia and Antarctica. The interior of Peary Crater may also harbor hydrogen deposits. A 1994Clementine Bistatic Radar Experiment, NASA, April 26, 2011, retrieved June 23, 2011 bistatic radar experiment performed during the Clementine mission suggested the presence of water ice around the south pole. The Lunar Prospector spacecraft reported in 2008 enhanced hydrogen abundances at the south pole and even more at the north pole. On the other hand, results reported using the Arecibo radio telescope have been interpreted by some to indicate that the anomalous Clementine radar signatures are not indicative of ice, but surface roughness. This interpretation, however, is not universally agreed upon. A potential limitation of the polar regions is that the inflow of solar wind can create an electrical charge on the leeward side of crater rims. The resulting voltage difference can affect electrical equipment, change surface chemistry, erode surfaces and levitate lunar dust. = Equatorial regions = The lunar equatorial regions are likely to have higher concentrations of helium-3 (rare on Earth but much sought after for use in nuclear fusion research) because the solar wind has a higher angle of incidence. They also enjoy an advantage in extra-Lunar traffic: The rotation advantage for launching material is slight due to the Moon's slow rotation, but the corresponding orbit coincides with the ecliptic, nearly coincides with the lunar orbit around Earth, and nearly coincides with the equatorial plane of Earth. Several probes have landed in the Oceanus Procellarum area. There are many areas and features that could be subject to long-term study, such as the Reiner Gamma anomaly and the dark-floored Grimaldi crater. = Far side = The lunar far side lacks direct communication with Earth, though a communication satellite at the Lagrangian point, or a network of orbiting satellites, could enable communication between the far side of the Moon and Earth. The far side is also a good location for a large radio telescope because it is well shielded from the Earth. Due to the lack of atmosphere, the location is also suitable for an array of optical telescopes, similar to the Very Large Telescope in Chile. Scientists have estimated that the highest concentrations of helium-3 can be found in the maria on the far side, as well as near side areas containing concentrations of the titanium-based mineral ilmenite. On the near side the Earth and its magnetic field partially shield the surface from the solar wind during each orbit. But the far side is fully exposed, and thus should receive a somewhat greater proportion of the ion stream. = Lunar lava tubes = Sunlight reveals the terrain of a 100-meter- deep lunar pit crater, which may be a collapsed lava tube. Lunar lava tubes are a potential location for constructing a lunar base. Any intact lava tube on the Moon could serve as a shelter from the severe environment of the lunar surface, with its frequent meteorite impacts, high-energy ultra-violet radiation and energetic particles, and extreme diurnal temperature variations. Lava tubes provide ideal positions for shelter because of their access to nearby resources. They also have proven themselves to be reliable structures, having withstood the test of time for billions of years. An underground colony would escape the extreme temperatures on the Moon's surface. The day period (about 354 hours) has an average temperature of about , although it can rise as high as . The night period (also 354 hours) has an average temperature of about . Underground, both day and night periods would be around , and humans could install ordinary heaters for warmth. One such lava tube was discovered in early 2009.  Structure  = Habitat = There have been numerous proposals regarding habitat modules. The designs have evolved throughout the years as humankind's knowledge about the Moon has grown, and as the technological possibilities have changed. The proposed habitats range from the actual spacecraft landers or their used fuel tanks, to inflatable modules of various shapes. Some hazards of the lunar environment such as sharp temperature shifts, lack of atmosphere or magnetic field (which means higher levels of radiation and micrometeoroids) and long nights, were unknown early on. Proposals have shifted as these hazards were recognized and taken into consideration.  Underground colonies  Some suggest building the lunar colony underground, which would give protection from radiation and micrometeoroids. This would also greatly reduce the risk of air leakage, as the colony would be fully sealed from the outside except for a few exits to the surface. The construction of an underground base would probably be more complex; one of the first machines from Earth might be a remote-controlled excavating machine. Once created, some sort of hardening would be necessary to avoid collapse, possibly a spray-on concrete-like substance made from available materials.Tung Dju (T. D.) Lin, cited via A more porous insulating material also made in-situ could then be applied. Rowley & Neudecker have suggested \\"melt-as-you-go\\" machines that would leave glassy internal surfaces. Mining methods such as the room and pillar might also be used. Inflatable self-sealing fabric habitats might then be put in place to retain air. Eventually an underground city can be constructed. Farms set up underground would need artificial sunlight. As an alternative to excavating, a lava tube could be covered and insulated, thus solving the problem of radiation exposure. An alternative solution is studied in Europe by students to excavate a habitat in the ice-filled craters of the Moon.https://www.spacecenter.ch/igluna/  Surface colonies  Double-dome concept for habitat creation on the moon A NASA model of a proposed inflatable module A possibly easier solution would be to build the lunar base on the surface, and cover the modules with lunar soil. The lunar soil is composed of a unique blend of silica and iron-containing compounds that may be fused into a glass-like solid using microwave energy. Blacic has studied the mechanical properties of lunar glass and has shown that it is a promising material for making rigid structures, if coated with metal to keep moisture out. This may allow for the use of \\"lunar bricks\\" in structural designs, or the vitrification of loose dirt to form a hard, ceramic crust. A lunar base built on the surface would need to be protected by improved radiation and micrometeoroid shielding. Building the lunar base inside a deep crater would provide at least partial shielding against radiation and micrometeoroids. Artificial magnetic fields have been proposed as a means to provide radiation shielding for long range deep space crewed missions, and it might be possible to use similar technology on a lunar colony. Some regions on the Moon possess strong local magnetic fields that might partially mitigate exposure to charged solar and galactic particles. In a turn from the usual engineer-designed lunar habitats, London-based Foster + Partners architectural firm proposed a building construction 3D-printer technology in January 2013 that would use lunar regolith raw materials to produce lunar building structures while using enclosed inflatable habitats for housing the human occupants inside the hard- shell lunar structures. Overall, these habitats would require only ten percent of the structure mass to be transported from Earth, while using local lunar materials for the other 90 percent of the structure mass. \\"Printed\\" lunar soil would provide both \\"radiation and temperature insulation. Inside, a lightweight pressurized inflatable with the same dome shape would be the living environment for the first human Moon settlers.\\" The building technology would include mixing lunar material with magnesium oxide, which would turn the \\"moonstuff into a pulp that can be sprayed to form the block\\" when a binding salt is applied that \\"converts [this] material into a stone-like solid.\\" Terrestrial versions of this 3D-printing building technology are already printing of building material per hour with the next-generation printers capable of per hour, sufficient to complete a building in a week. = Moon Capital = In 2010, The Moon Capital Competition offered a prize for a design of a lunar habitat intended to be an underground international commercial center capable of supporting a residential staff of 60 people and their families. The Moon Capital is intended to be self-sufficient with respect to food and other material required for life support. Prize money was provided primarily by the Boston Society of Architects, Google Lunar X Prize and The New England Council of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. = 3D-printed structures = block 3Dprinted from simulated lunar dust, to demonstrate the feasibility of constructing a Moon base using local materials On January 31, 2013, the ESA working with Foster + Partners, tested a 3D-printed structure that could be constructed of lunar regolith for use as a Moon base.  Energy  = Nuclear power = A nuclear fission reactor might fulfill most of a Moon base's power requirements.Stephanie Schierholz, Grey Hautaluoma, Katherine K. Martin: NASA Developing Fission Surface Power Technology. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, September 10, 2008, retrieved June 27, 2011 With the help of fission reactors, one could overcome the difficulty of the 354 hour lunar night. According to NASA, a nuclear fission power station could generate a steady 40 kilowatts, equivalent to the demand of about eight houses on Earth. An artist's concept of such a station published by NASA envisages the reactor being buried below the Moon's surface to shield it from its surroundings; out from a tower-like generator part reaching above the surface over the reactor, radiators would extend into space to send away any heat energy that may be left over.Kathleen Zona: IMAGE FOR RELEASE 08-042. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, September 10, 2008, retrieved June 27, 2011 Radioisotope thermoelectric generators could be used as backup and emergency power sources for solar powered colonies. One specific development program in the 2000s was the Fission Surface Power (FSP) project of NASA and DOE, a fission power system focused on \\"developing and demonstrating a nominal 40 kWe power system to support human exploration missions. The FSP system concept uses conventional low-temperature stainless steel, liquid metal-cooled reactor technology coupled with Stirling power conversion.\\" , significant component hardware testing had been successfully completed, and a non-nuclear system demonstration test was being fabricated. In 2017 NASA started the Kilopower project that tested the KRUSTY reactor. Japan has the RAPID-L conceptual design. Helium-3 mining could be used to provide a substitute for tritium for potential production of fusion power in the future. = Solar energy = Solar energy is a possible source of power for a lunar base. Many of the raw materials needed for solar panel production can be extracted on site. However, the long lunar night (354 hours or 14.75 Earth days) is a drawback for solar power on the Moon's surface. This might be solved by building several power plants, so that at least one of them is always in daylight. Another possibility would be to build such a power plant where there is constant or near-constant sunlight, such as at the Malapert mountain near the lunar south pole, or on the rim of Peary crater near the north pole. Since lunar regolith contains structural metals like iron and aluminum, solar panels could be mounted high up on locally-built towers that might rotate to follow the Sun. A third possibility would be to leave the panels in orbit, and beam the power down as microwaves. The solar energy converters need not be silicon solar panels. It may be more advantageous to use the larger temperature difference between Sun and shade to run heat engine generators. Concentrated sunlight could also be relayed via mirrors and used in Stirling engines or solar trough generators, or it could be used directly for lighting, agriculture and process heat. The focused heat might also be employed in materials processing to extract various elements from lunar surface materials.  Energy storage  Fuel cells on the Space Shuttle have operated reliably for up to 17 Earth days at a time. On the Moon, they would only be needed for 354 hours (14 days) ‚Äì the length of the lunar night. Fuel cells produce water directly as a waste product. Current fuel cell technology is more advanced than the Shuttle's cells ‚Äì PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) cells produce considerably less heat (though their waste heat would likely be useful during the lunar night) and are lighter, not to mention the reduced mass of the smaller heat-dissipating radiators. This makes PEMs more economical to launch from Earth than the shuttle's cells. PEMs have not yet been proven in space. Combining fuel cells with electrolysis would provide a \\"perpetual\\" source of electricity ‚Äì solar energy could be used to provide power during the lunar day, and fuel cells at night. During the lunar day, solar energy would also be used to electrolyze the water created in the fuel cells ‚Äì although there would be small losses of gases that would have to be replaced. Even if lunar colonies could provide themselves access to a near- continuous source of solar energy, they would still need to maintain fuel cells or an alternate energy storage system to sustain themselves during lunar eclipses and emergency situations.  Transport  = Earth to Moon = Conventional rockets have been used for most lunar explorations to date. The ESA's SMART-1 mission from 2003 to 2006 used conventional chemical rockets to reach orbit and Hall effect thrusters to arrive at the Moon in 13 months. NASA would have used chemical rockets on its Ares V booster and Altair lander, that were being developed for a planned return to the Moon around 2019, but this was cancelled. The construction workers, location finders, and other astronauts vital to building, would have been taken four at a time in NASA's Orion spacecraft. Proposed concepts of Earth-Moon transportation are Space elevators.Smitherman, D. V., \\"Space Elevators, An Advanced Earth-Space Infrastructure for the New Millennium\\", NASA/CP-2000-210429 Sarmont, E., ‚ÄùAffordable to the Individual Spaceflight‚Äù, accessed Feb. 6, 2014 = On the surface = Artist's concept of a lunar rover being unloaded from a cargo spacecraft Lunar colonists would need the ability to transport cargo and people to and from modules and spacecraft, and to carry out scientific study of a larger area of the lunar surface for long periods of time. Proposed concepts include a variety of vehicle designs, from small open rovers to large pressurized modules with lab equipment, such as the Toyota rover concept. Rovers could be useful if the terrain is not too steep or hilly. The only rovers to have operated on the surface of the Moon () are the three Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicles (LRV), developed by Boeing, the two robotic Soviet Lunokhods and the Chinese Yutu rover in 2013. The LRV was an open rover for a crew of two, and a range of 92 km during one lunar day. One NASA study resulted in the Mobile Lunar Laboratory concept, a crewed pressurized rover for a crew of two, with a range of 396 km. The Soviet Union developed different rover concepts in the Lunokhod series and the L5 for possible use on future crewed missions to the Moon or Mars. These rover designs were all pressurized for longer sorties. If multiple bases were established on the lunar surface, they could be linked together by permanent railway systems. Both conventional and magnetic levitation (Maglev) systems have been proposed for the transport lines. Mag-Lev systems are particularly attractive as there is no atmosphere on the surface to slow down the train, so the vehicles could achieve velocities comparable to aircraft on the Earth. One significant difference with lunar trains, however, is that the cars would need to be individually sealed and possess their own life support systems. For difficult areas, a flying vehicle may be more suitable. Bell Aerosystems proposed their design for the Lunar Flying Vehicle as part of a study for NASA, while Bell proposed the Manned Flying System, a similar concept. = Surface to space =  Launch technology  A mass driver‚Äîthe long structure that goes toward the horizon‚Äîas part of a lunar base. NASA conceptual illustration. Experience so far indicates that launching human beings into space is much more expensive than launching cargo. One way to get materials and products from the Moon to an interplanetary way station might be with a mass driver, a magnetically accelerated projectile launcher. Cargo would be picked up from orbit or an Earth-Moon Lagrangian point by a shuttle craft using ion propulsion, solar sails or other means and delivered to Earth orbit or other destinations such as near-Earth asteroids, Mars or other planets, perhaps using the Interplanetary Transport Network. A lunar space elevator could transport people, raw materials and products to and from an orbital station at Lagrangian points or . Chemical rockets would take a payload from Earth to the L1 lunar Lagrange location. From there a tether would slowly lower the payload to a soft landing on the lunar surface. Other possibilities include a momentum exchange tether system.  Launch costs  * Estimates of the cost per unit mass of launching cargo or people from the Moon vary and the cost impacts of future technological improvements are difficult to predict. An upper bound on the cost of launching material from the Moon might be about $40,000,000 per kilogram, based on dividing the Apollo program costs by the amount of material returned. At the other extreme, the incremental cost of launching material from the Moon using an electromagnetic accelerator could be quite low. The efficiency of launching material from the Moon with a proposed electric accelerator is suggested to be about 50%. If the carriage of a mass driver weighs the same as the cargo, two kilograms must be accelerated to orbital velocity for each kilogram put into orbit. The overall system efficiency would then drop to 25%. So 1.4 kilowatt-hours would be needed to launch an incremental kilogram of cargo to low orbit from the Moon.The circular orbital speed for any central body equals the square root of the quantity (the radius of the orbit times the gravity of the central body at that point); for the lunar surface: the square root of (1,730,000 meters times 1.63 meters per second squared) is 1680 meters per second. The energy of this motion for one kilogram is one half the square of the speed, 1,410,000 watt seconds or 0.392 kilowatt-hours. With a 25% efficient accelerator, 1.6 kilowatt-hours are needed to achieve the orbital velocity. At $0.1/kilowatt-hour, a typical cost for electrical power on Earth, that amounts to $0.16 for the energy to launch a kilogram of cargo into orbit. For the actual cost of an operating system, energy loss for power conditioning, the cost of radiating waste heat, the cost of maintaining all systems, and the interest cost of the capital investment are considerations. * Passengers cannot be divided into the parcel size suggested for the cargo of a mass driver, nor subjected to hundreds of gravities acceleration. However, technical developments could also affect the cost of launching passengers to orbit from the Moon. Instead of bringing all fuel and oxidizer from Earth, liquid oxygen could be produced from lunar materials and hydrogen should be available from the lunar poles. The cost of producing these on the Moon is yet unknown, but they would be more expensive than production costs on Earth. The situation of the local hydrogen is most open to speculation. As a rocket fuel, hydrogen could be extended by combining it chemically with silicon to form silane, which has yet to be demonstrated in an actual rocket engine. In the absence of more technical developments, the cost of transporting people from the Moon would be an impediment to colonization. = Surface to and from cis-lunar space = A cislunar transport system has been proposed using tethers to achieve momentum exchange. This system requires zero net energy input, and could not only retrieve payloads from the lunar surface and transport them to Earth, but could also soft land payloads on to the lunar surface.  Economic development  For long-term sustainability, a space colony should be close to self-sufficient. Mining and refining the Moon's materials on-site ‚Äì for use both on the Moon and elsewhere in the Solar System ‚Äì could provide an advantage over deliveries from Earth, as they can be launched into space at a much lower energy cost than from Earth. It is possible that large amounts of cargo would need to be launched into space for interplanetary exploration in the 21st century, and the lower cost of providing goods from the Moon might be attractive.Tung Dju (T. D.) Lin, cited via = Space-based materials processing = In the long term, the Moon will likely play an important role in supplying space-based construction facilities with raw materials. Zero gravity in space allows for the processing of materials in ways impossible or difficult on Earth, such as \\"foaming\\" metals, where a gas is injected into a molten metal, and then the metal is annealed slowly. On Earth, the gas bubbles rise and burst, but in a zero gravity environment, that does not happen. The annealing process requires large amounts of energy, as a material is kept very hot for an extended period of time. (This allows the molecular structure to realign.) = Exporting material to Earth = Exporting material to Earth in trade from the Moon is more problematic due to the cost of transportation, which would vary greatly if the Moon is industrially developed (see \\"Launch costs\\" above). One suggested trade commodity is helium-3 (3He) which is carried by the solar wind and accumulated on the Moon's surface over billions of years, but occurs only rarely on Earth.Mining the Moon. Mark Williams Pontin, MIT Technology Review. August 23, 2007. Helium-3 might be present in the lunar regolith in quantities of 0.01 ppm to 0.05 ppm (depending on soil). In 2006 it had a market price of about $1,500 per gram ($1.5M per kilogram), more than 120 times the value per unit weight of gold and over eight times the value of rhodium. In the future 3He harvested from the Moon may have a role as a fuel in thermonuclear fusion reactors. It should require about of helium-3 to produce the electricity that Earth uses in a year and there should be enough on the Moon to provide that much for 10,000 years. = Exporting propellant obtained from lunar water = To reduce the cost of transport, the Moon could store propellants produced from lunar water at one or several depots between the Earth and the Moon, to resupply rockets or satellites in Earth orbit. The Shackleton Energy Company estimate investment in this infrastructure could cost around $25 billion. = Solar power satellites = Gerard K. O'Neill, noting the problem of high launch costs in the early 1970s, came up with the idea of building Solar Power Satellites in orbit with materials from the Moon. Launch costs from the Moon would vary greatly if the Moon is industrially developed (see \\"Launch costs\\" above). This proposal was based on the contemporary estimates of future launch costs of the Space Shuttle. On 30 April 1979 the Final Report \\"Lunar Resources Utilization for Space Construction\\" by General Dynamics Convair Division under NASA contract NAS9-15560 concluded that use of lunar resources would be cheaper than terrestrial materials for a system comprising as few as thirty Solar Power Satellites of 10 GW capacity each. In 1980, when it became obvious NASA's launch cost estimates for the Space Shuttle were grossly optimistic, O'Neill et al. published another route to manufacturing using lunar materials with much lower startup costs. This 1980s SPS concept relied less on human presence in space and more on partially self-replicating systems on the lunar surface under telepresence control of workers stationed on Earth.
