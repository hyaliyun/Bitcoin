Regulated verse is one of the most important of all Classical Chinese poetry types. Although often regarded as a Tang Dynasty innovation, the origin of regulated verse within the Classical Chinese poetic tradition is associated with Shen Yue (441‚Äì513), based on his \\"four tones and eight defects\\" (ÂõõËÅ≤ÂÖ´ÁóÖ) theory regarding tonality.Watson, 110‚Äì112 There are three types of regulated verse: the eight- lined l√ºshi, the four-lined jueju, and the linked couplets of indeterminate length pailu. All regulated verse forms are rhymed on the even lines, with one rhyme being used throughout the poem. Also, and definitionally, the tonal profile of the poem is controlled (that is, \\"regulated\\"). Furthermore, semantic and tonal parallelism is generally required of certain interior couplets. During the Tang Dynasty, the \\"Shen-Song\\" team of Shen Quanqi and Song Zhiwen greatly contributed to the development of this Classical Chinese verse form. Formal rules Regulated verse consisting of the three jintishi or \\"new style poetry\\" forms of lushi, jueju, and pailu while retaining the basic characteristics that are distinguished from the gushi or \\"old style poetry\\" by the addition of a number of formal rules, most of which they share in common, but in some of which they differ. These rules include: *Number of lines are limited to four for jueju, eight for lushi, and an unlimited, greater, even number for the pailu. In each case, the poem is arranged in paired lines in the form of couplets. *Line lengths are all the same in terms of syllables or characters throughout any given poem. Generally, the line length is fixed at five or seven or characters per line; although, there are some poems which have a six character line-length. The line length is also used for the purpose of further classifying the main three forms of regulated verse into subtypes. *Rhyme is mandatory. Rhyme, or rime, is based on a sometimes somewhat technical rhyme scheme. The rhyme of a poem can be difficult to determine, especially for older poems as pronounced in modern versions of Chinese; however, even as early as the Tang Dynasty, formal rhyme might be based upon authoritative references in a rime table or rime dictionary, rather than on actual vernacular speech. Generally level tones only rhyme with level tones, and non-level (or \\"deflected\\") tones only formally rhyme with other non-level tones. Also, the first line of the poem may also set the rhyme, more often in the seven-character form than the five- character. *The pattern of tonality within the poem is regulated according to certain fixed patterns of alternating level and deflected tones. Although there is some question as to the status of tone in older forms of Chinese, in Middle Chinese (characteristic of the Chinese of the Sui Dynasty, Tang Dynasty, and Song Dynasty), a four tone system developed. For the purposes of regulated verse, the important distinction is between the level tone (p√≠ng Âπ≥, similar to the modern Mandarin Chinese first tone) and the other three tones which are grouped in the category of deflected tones (z√® ‰ªÑ). *Parallelism is a feature of regulated verse. The parallelism requirement means that the two parallel lines must match each word in each line with the word which is in the same position in the other line, the match can be in terms of grammatical function, comparison or contrast, phonology, among other considerations: the degree of parallelism can vary and the type of parallelism is crucial to the meaning of a well-written regulated verse poem. Phonological parallelism can include various considerations, including tonality. Grammatical function parallelism examples include matching colors, actions, numeric quantities and so on. In the eight-line lushi form, which is composed of four couplets, the middle two couplets have internal parallelism; that is, the third and fourth line are parallel with each other and the fifth and sixth lines are parallel with each other. The jueju is more flexible in terms of required parallelism, although it may be present. The pailu requires parallelism for all couplets except for the first and last pair. *The caesura, or a pause between certain phrases within any given line is a standard feature of regulated verse, with the main rule being for a major caesura preceding the last three syllables within a line. Thus, in the six-line verse the major caesura divides the line into two three-character halves. Furthermore, in the seven-character line, there is generally a minor caesura between the first and second pairs of characters.

By: Dr.Khaja Muzaffaruddin M.Sc(Lond.)Ph.D.(Glasgow) in Munsif Daily Newspaper, Hyderabad, India. 13 July 1998 Teachings General teachings # God Almighty, is the creator of all things in the Universe. # God alone is the giver of profits and losses. # God the high above, fulfills the inherent needs and demands of whole of his creation to the highest pitch (directly as well as through some media or source). # God is neither a soul nor merely a power, but He is the creator of all such forces. # Nothing is self existing in reality but is subject to the act of creator i.e. God. # God is apparent by the shape of everything and is free from every shape. Everything is manifestation of God yet He is infinite and above His manifestations. # God is light and existence, whereas the creation without Him, in fact, is in the darkness of non-existence. # God is found of expression and man is in want of existence. # The human being is the everlasting bondman of the God high above (Man is the eternal and permanent slave of God). # Nothing has movement, except with the force of God. # Believe that God is with me and every act of me is in His sight. # We should worship God in a manner, as if we are seeing Him. # Man is bound to believe and accept all the previous prophets and messengers of God, with the due respect and without any prejudice. Man should also believe in the Holy Books and scriptures, revealed upon then by God. The vested interest of priest lords have, perhaps, corrupted some of the teachings. Now all human beings should follow the tenets of Islam, as enjoined in the Holy Quran and the traditions of Mohammad which cover and complete the mission of the all previous messengers of God. # The Prophet of Islam, Mohammad is the last of God's messengers. He is for the whole universe and for all time. # The Holy Principle of La-Ilaaha-illallahu Mohammadur-Rasoolullahi. (There is no God save Allah and Mohammad is his Prophet), is the guiding light from God and final and obligatory commandment. # In the light of Islam, all human beings are equal in the eyes of God irrespective of caste, creed class, colour. If there is any difference, it is on account of their good deeds. # Patriotism is part and parcel of belief (i.e., Iman). # As per one Hadees, The Islamic prophet Mohammad felt the smell of love from our motherland India. We are proud of being Indians. According to teaching of Islam one should give respect and be obedient to the ruler of his country and follow the constitution and rule of his motherland.A brief introduction of Moulana Ghousavi Shah. written by Mohammed Mubeen (Malaysia).

Origins  The term is derived from the related term conspicuous consumption, coined by economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen in his 1899 book The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study in the Evolution of Institutions. Veblen described a tendency among certain sections of the nouveau riche to uses their purchasing power to display prestige.Veblen, Thorstein. (1899) Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study in the Evolution of Institutions. New York: Macmillan. 400 pp., also: 1994 Dover paperback edition, , 1994 Penguin Classics edition, . The term conspicuous conservation was coined by University of Syracuse economics professor, Seymour Sacks, who first mentioned the term in a private conversation.  Experiments  Figure 1: Percentage of participants in each group choosing the pro-environmental products. Respective to the car (purple), soap (blue), and dishwasher (green), the control group chose the pro- environmental products 37.2%, 25.7%, and 34.5% of the time. Participants of the motive-status group were much more likely to choose the green products and choose them 54.5%, 41.8%, and 49.1% of the time, respectively. Between 2007 and 2009, Psychology professors, Vladas Griskevicius (University of Minnesota), Joshua M. Tybur (University of New Mexico), and Bram Van den Bergh (Rotterdam School of Management) conducted a series of experiments investigating conspicuous conservation. In the resulting paper, Going Green to Be Seen: Status, Reputation, and Conspicuous Conservation they argued that \\"buying such products can be construed as altruistic, since green products often cost more and are of lower quality than their conventional counterparts, but green goods benefit the environment for everyone\\". Because altruistic behavior might function as a costly signal of social status, conspicuous conservation can be interpreted as a signal of high status. Their experiments showed that activating status motives led people to choose green products over more luxurious non-green products. The status motive increases the willingness to buy green products in public (but not in private) settings and in settings where green products cost more than non-green products. According to the authors, status competition can thus be used to promote pro-environmental behavior.

The accident occurred while seven miners were working with explosives on a narrow coal seam. Following a routine blasting operation the tunnel in which the miners were working began to fill with water. Three of the miners escaped, with one being taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries, while the others were trapped underground. A search and rescue operation was launched to locate the four remaining miners, but they were found deceased the following day. The incident is the worst mining disaster to occur in Wales for three decades. Explosion and rescue operation The accident occurred in the Gleision Colliery drift mine in the valley of the River Tawe, north of Swansea, in Neath Port Talbot on 15 September 2011. Seven miners were working a narrow seam and using explosives at the coal face. After an intentional explosion, a routine blasting operation to extract coal, at 09.21, the passage in which the miners were working rapidly filled with a large quantity of water. Three miners were immediately able to escape to the surface; one of these was taken by ambulance to Morriston Hospital. The Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service requested the assistance of Mines Rescue units from Wales and across the United Kingdom, with the aim of rescuing the remaining four miners trapped at a depth of below the surface. On 16 September South Wales Police confirmed that all four of the miners had died. All family members were informed of the situation. At that stage formal identification had not yet been made, although the miners were named as Charles Breslin, 62; David Powell, 50; Garry Jenkins, 39; and Philip Hill, 44. Police officially announced the identities of the deceased miners the following day. Aftermath On 16 September the Secretary of State for Wales Cheryl Gillan announced that an inquiry would be held into events at Gleision Colliery and that lessons had to be learned. She said the investigation would initially be led by South Wales Police, then handed over to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The need for an investigation was echoed by First Minister of Wales Carwyn Jones and Labour Party leader Ed Miliband. The Health and Safety Executive issued a joint statement with the Wales Office on 17 September saying that it was too early to determine a possible cause, and that Health and Safety officials were on site at Gleision Colliery and working alongside the police. A spokesman said that the HSE would release its findings in due course. On the same day, Peter Hain, the MP for Neath, whose constituency covers the area where the Colliery is situated, said that he had spoken to the miners' families, but that none of the miners had reported any safety concerns at Gleision. On 18 October 2011, the mine manager, Malcolm Fyfield, was arrested but not charged by South Wales Police on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence. Following further investigations he was charged on 18 January 2013 with four counts of manslaughter by gross negligence. The company which owns the colliery, MNS Mining Ltd, was summonsed for four counts of corporate manslaughter. Both Mr Fyfield and the company were subsequently found not guilty. The HSE report Gleision Mine Incident 15 September 2011 on the investigation has now been published. Public response A charity, the Swansea Valley Miners Appeal Fund (Charity Registration Number 1143974), was launched on 17 September and had raised ¬£30,000 within a day of its establishment. The charity was launched by Peter Hain, but is now administered by the Coal Industry Social Welfare Organisation (CISWO, charity reg no 1015581) while Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales agreed to become its Royal Patron. On Sunday 18 September prayers were said at church services across South Wales to remember the dead. Sporting tributes were paid by Swansea City F.C. which held a minute's silence at its ground on the afternoon of 17 September, while the Welsh Rugby team dedicated their win at 18 September's World Cup match against Samoa to the families of the miners. The poem \\"Gleision\\", a reflection of the accident, was composed by Welsh Poet Laureate Gwyneth Lewis who had visited the village only the previous day.

The plot depicts the Diary Game, a deadly battle royal between 12 different individuals who are given \\"Future Diaries\\", special diaries that can predict the future, by Deus Ex Machina, the God of Time and Space, with the last survivor becoming his heir. Future Diary follows Yukiteru \\"Yuki\\" Amano, a socially awkward boy and one of the game's contestants who only wants to survive; Yuno Gasai, another one of the game's contestants and a friend, who would do anything to be with Yuki; Minene Ury≈´, another contestant who is an infamous spy with a grudge against God; and Aru Akise, a genius teen detective and a friend of Yuki who investigates the true purpose of the game and Yuno's dark secrets. Each Future Diary Holder is named after Dii Consentes or Twelve Olympians in Roman and Greek Mythology. Diary Game contestants and judges =Diary Holders= ; (The First) : :The main male protagonist of the series and the First Diary user. Also known as , he is a reclusive and shy 14-year-old middle school student, opting to be a bystander to incidents around him to write about them in this cellphone diary instead. He becomes involved as one of 12 contestants in a 90-day battle royale when, to his shock, his imaginary friend Deus turned out to be a real God of Space-Time, planning to have the sole survivor of the game succeed his throne. Yuki's ordinary diary becomes the , a diary capable of predicting future events happening around him from his point of view. While versatile in any situation, the diary does not state what happens to Yuki himself, and since it is written from his point of view personal interpretation is not always accurate. :Unlike most of the contestants, Yuki wishes for a simple, peaceful life. Because Deus considers him a personal favourite to win, he is mainly targeted by other Diary users. Knowing he is weak, cowardly and na√Øve, he quickly makes friends and allies, one of which is Yuno Gasai, an obsessive stalker who is madly in love with him and will kill to protect both of them. His goal to not kill anyone until a last resort changes when his divorced parents are killed because of the game and Yuno convinces him that becoming the God of Space-Time can bring them back, becoming a ruthless, backstabbing and dishonest player no better than the others. :Eventually he learns of Yuno's true origins and intentions, finally stepping out of his role as a constant bystander to intervene in changing her future, including those of the other Diary owners that led terrible, misfortunate lives. When trapped by her in an illusionary utopia, he breaks free through his love and force of will to meet her again. Yuno, touched, commits suicide to let him win the game. A distraught Yuki refuses to use his godly powers for 10,000 years, until the Third World Yuno returns to him with memories and love of the First World Yuno. :He is named after Jupiter, the Roman god of the sky, weather and lightning. ; (The Second) : :The main female protagonist of the series and the Second Diary user. While a perfect model student on the surface, she is actually a psychopathic yandere who is borderline obsessed with Yukiteru and kills unhesitatingly to protect him. Her Diary is the , a stalker diary that gives her explicit details on whatever Yuki is doing in the present 10 minutes. By working together with his Random Diary, they are able to solve their diaries' weaknesses. :Yuno's behaviour stemmed from her parents, who used to love her until they became abusive and demanding for their daughter to become perfect, even locking her up in a cage if she acted disobediently. Their extreme treatment drove her to insanity that she did the same to them, hoping they would understand how she felt and return to being their loving selves again, but inadvertently caused them to starve to death. She disguised their deaths under the guise of them working overseas until Aru manages to find her out. Because Yuki truly cared for her, he became her sole reason to live for. When the two were swept into the Diary game they committed double suicide after killing the rest, but Yuno lied and became the God of Space-Time thinking she could resurrect Yuki with her godly powers. After learning that it was impossible, she went back in time with agony, creating a Second World, and killed her Second World self to replace her. The Second World was where the current story took place. :Exposed in the end, Yuno returns to the past again, creating a Third World to relive everything again. Yuki and Minene follow her to change all their terrible futures, including Yuno's to prevent the Diary game from happening. Thinking she is using Yuki, she tries to rid herself of him by sealing him in an illusionary utopia, but he breaks free using his love and force will. Yuno, realising that she loves him, commits suicide to let him win the survival game. :Third World Yuno is able to find happiness with her parents, and subsequently receives the memories of First World Yuno from Murumuru.

Takao is Yuki's school teacher who is secretly a serial killer who wears a heavy bulletproof trenchcoat with a hat and mask that hides his identity. Takao's diary is the which gives him details on who his next victims are and where and how he kills them. While the diary helps him catch his victims and prevents them from escaping, it does not tell him what to do if his victims will fight back thus he can be easily defeated. Takao figured out that Yuki holds a diary as well because Yuki used his diary to improve his grades. Takao heads to Yuki's apartment to kill him but, Yuno shows up and takes him to the roof. Yuno uses her phone as a surveillance camera so Yuki can see where Takao is through his own phone while sitting on the roof's ledge. Yuno runs out of the corner to surprise and distract Takao, while Yuki pops up to attack him. He was killed by a dart Yukiteru threw at his diary. :It is revealed by Murumuru that Takao repeatedly accidentally killed himself when she was presenting him with his Future Diary. First was when he thought she was a witness to his recent killing and sliced the phone, and then thinking the phone was evidence, he destroyed it again.

Thanks to his position, he provides police intel for Yuki and Yuno. Later, he joins them to the Omekata cult's shrine where its leader, Tsubaki has held Minene prisoner. While offering Minene to the trio in exchange for help avoiding her own Dead End, they are attacked by Tsubaki's hypnotized cult under the Twelfth's control. At this point, Keigo goes to retrieve Minene, and the two are forced to watch as the Twelfth is killed and Tsubaki betrays Yuki and Yuno, only to die herself. After the battle Keigo helps Minene escape in exchange she becomes his informant and protect his son who is hospitalized due to his condition. :But upon learning that his son's condition is not improving and will die in several weeks, Keigo, desperate to save his son's life, decides to play and win the game.

Yuki and Yuno hides at the hospital where Keigo's wife and son are. Minene helps Keigo, but finds out Keigo will kill her after she does so she creates a new future diary alliance with them. Keigo soon has the hospital surrounded and personally leads the SWAT police to kill Yuki, Yuno, Minene and save his family. But unbeknownst to him, Minene was able to sneak out and tells Masumi of what Keigo really did. After a standoff between him and Yuki, Yuki shoots Keigo, wounding him. Masumi places Keigo under arrest, rendering his Investigation Diary useless. Keigo realizes he cannot kill a child and kills himself by destroying his Future Diary. Before dying, he apologizes to Yuki for betraying him and tells Minene to protect his family. Later on, Murumuru revealed that she had warned Keigo about his son's condition to \\"speed things up\\", with Deus noting that Fourth was a good candidate to be the last man standing. :Murumuru meets Keigo in a cafe where she tells him he has been chosen to receive a future diary. Keigo tells his backstory about why he became a detective and accepts the phone. :He appears in the alternate universe, being contacted by Minene about his son's cardiac illness, thus changing his future. He confronts the original Yuno when she prepares to murder her Third World counterpart and her family, and fires a bullet at her. Yuki and the Second World Murumuru appear, blocking the bullet, with Keigo silently witnessing the ending events of the survival game. Keigo is later seen two years on with his wife and son. :He alludes to the Roman god Mercury. ; (The Fifth) : :The Fifth Diary user.

However, his diary only shows three entries for the day during the morning, noon, and night. Despite this limit, Reisuke has all three entries at the same time which allows him to ample time so he can carefully plot his next move and be at the right place and time. Reisuke can draw some pictures into his Future Diary, giving him some source material other than writing. :Reisuke's parents were members of the Omekata cult who both later committed mass suicide after the police raided their temple.

After his parents' death, Mrs. Amano takes care of Reisuke for a few days, as she was a friend of his father. He had grown a fondness to Mrs. Amano, even calling her, \\"Mama Rea\\".

He lands into Yuno's chest, thinking he stabbed her, but she reveals that he stabbed a zabuton instead. After that, Reisuke planned to shower with Yuno by starting a bath, mixing it with salt, and grabbing electrical wires, in hopes to electrocute Yuno to death. With Yuki's Future Diary, he is able to stop Reisuke's plan by causing a power shortage in the house. Yuki and Yuno are on to Reisuke and try to stop him by taking away his Future Diary. Yuno planned to kill Reisuke with hammers but instead, hits Yuki's mom in the back of her neck and causes her to knock out.

Yuki agrees to help her due to her condition and Tsubaki's claim she has no interests in winning the game much to Yuno's jealousy. When the Twelfth diary user Yomotsu takes action to kill Tsubaki by hypnotizing her followers, Yuki and Yuno protects her and kills Yomotsu. However, Tsubaki betrays everyone, revealing she was using Minene as bait to lure them so she could trap and kill them and tells Yuki that she lied about not being interested in the game as she wants win and end the world as she hates it. :Her parents who were the original leaders of the cult, a religion designed to save the weak and to never give in to wicked thoughts or acts. After her parents were killed in a car crash, Tsubaki became the priestess. However, the cult's second-in-command took over and had Tsubaki locked away in a cage, allowing the male members of the cult to rape her.

Their real diaries are the which report each other's immediate future. The couple displays excellent teamwork as they use their diaries to cover each other's weaknesses.

There, she meets Marco and Kamado. As they grew older, Ai started following Marco around school. Marco got into a lot of fights while Ai kept a diary of Marco in her phone.

During the fight, Yuki's father grabs his phone and breaks it, but it was a fake. Yuno attacks Ai and grabs their real phones back. Yuki's father does not understand that they are future diaries and was given a choice that if he broke Yuki's cellphone, his debt would be cleared by Bacchus.

The diary's powers can be countered if the user of the diary changes the information that comes up, before it is viewed on the Watcher Diary. A believer in Nazi ideology, Bacchus' main goal is to create a race of superior beings with him as their leader.

The Twelfth later uses a second wave of hypnotized followers and the followers that were pretending to be dead in the shrine. However, he is shocked to learn that Yuno Gasai figured out his plan and, upon hearing that his Dead End has been triggered, he swallows a bomb and attacks Tsubaki with four hypnotized followers dressed identically to him, aside from different colors on their masks in a suicide bombing. Yuno manages to discover which Twelfth is the real one by taking advantage of his blindness by throwing a rock in one direction, but actually throwing it in the other, using his heightened hearing to her advantage. Yuno kills him by decapitating him and he praises her as victor before crashing out of sight and exploding. A running gag with him is his real face is never seen, at one point going as far as to wear two separate bags on his head so as to continue hiding it even after having it removed. :Murumuru hands Yomotsu a diary in exchange for 50 Yen. :He appears in the alternate universe and captures Takao Hiyama committing a crime. It can be guessed he continues his vigilante actions later on. :He alludes to the Roman god Pluto. His name is also a reference to the slope that descends into Yomi, the Japanese underworld. ; (The Thirteenth) : :The Thirteenth Diary Owner, who appears exclusively in the PSP visual novel, . She is seen dressed in a high school uniform and a yellow raincoat. She seeks to kill Takao Hiyama after he attacked and hospitalised her younger twin sister . She has the , a video camera which predicts what it will film before it films it. =Deities= ; : :The God of Time and Space and the Diary Game overseer and creator. Yuki always assumed that Deus was just his imaginary friend only to learn he is in fact real. Convinced by John Bacchus' partnership, Deus created the Diary Game to find a worthy successor to take over his place. The reason he creates the game is because his life is coming to an end. Deus seems to favor Yuki and most likely wants him as his successor. He also favors on Minene, transferring his knowledge and half of his power to her and thus, making his death approaching faster than anticipated. He admits that she is the only one he can rely on at that point in time, to stop First World Murumuru. He even tells her that she is correct when Minene asked if Eleventh's diary is the ability to spy on other people's diaries, since Deus believed John to create a new futuristic race. :In the Third World, the future diary survival game never happens. Deus breaks the wall of space-time, connecting a path to 10,000 years later in the future of the Second World, allowing Yuki and the Third World Yuno to succeed after him as gods. ; : :Mur Mur in the English dubbed version, she is a brown, white haired girl with a black point-tipped tail who is Deus' servant. She has an almost chibi-like appearance and is dressed rather provocatively, wearing a closed pink vest, panty-like shorts, large wide- brimmed stockings and a large open-topped nurse cap with valentine-hearts printed on each side. She has a rather playful and nonchalant attitude toward Deus and the other Diary users. Most of the time she serves as the comic relief of the series. She poses as a major antagonist towards the end of both the main series and Future Diary: Paradox, scheming behind Deus for her own personal fun. Like Yuno, Murumuru originates from the First World, having enjoyed the survival game so much that she performs a time leap with Yuno to the Second World, traps her alternate self in Yuno's illusions, and gives Yuno her second Future Diary. After Deus dies, Murumuru declares herself God until the second game is won, but the future of the Third World is altered through numerous catalysts. The Second World Murumuru escapes from Yuno's illusions with Yuki, beating down her First World self. Both Murumuru, along with her Third World self, reappear with Deus and Yuno in the Third World when Yuki and Yuno reunite. :She is named after Murmur, one of the 72 Goetic demons. Other characters =Friends= ; : :The secondary male protagonist and the protagonist of the side-story manga, Future Diary: Paradox. One of Yuki's new friends at his new school, Aru is a genius with amazing investigation skills and wants to be a great detective. He becomes involved in the Diary Game to learn the mysteries surrounding it and protect Yuki. Aru has feelings for Yuki that are beyond that of friendship, which angers Yuno. As the games continue, Aru becomes suspicious of Yuno and tries to find out what secrets is she hiding from Yuki. He soon discovers Yuno's origins but also his own when he learns about his creation by Deus as an \\"observer\\" to keep on eye on the contestant. He receives the Detective Diary from the Eighth Diary user which can make predictions based on the predictions of the other diaries. It is nearly a perfect diary, except when accounting for Aru's feelings towards Yuki, meaning he can act against what would be a perfect outcome. It also cannot detect the difference between diaries from other universes, which Yuno exploits to defeat him. Despite losing to Yuno, he continues to help Yuki and gives him the clue on Yuno's identity before she decapitates him. In the Third World, Aru is seen alive and continues as Deus' observer, with Reisuke as his detective-in-training. :Aru is the protagonist of Paradox, set in an alternate timeline after Murumuru accidentally kills Yuno and Yuki is mortally wounded by Takao Hiyama. Aru and Murumuru take their respective places as First and Second until Murumuru's alterations have been fixed. However, as the game progresses, Aru sees the horrors of it and decides to save everyone to stop the game. Altering the events of the incident with Tsubaki Kasugano, Aru is able to make allies with a majority of the diary owners. However, his attempt to stop Murumuru from erasing the timeline fails when he stumbles across Yuno and how she killed her Second World counterpart, before being cast back to the start of the survival game. :He has many parallels with Bacchus, including being created from a god and gaining supernatural insight later in life. ; : :Chief Investigator and Keigo's subordinate within the police. He is an ally of Yuki within the police force. In Mirai Nikki: Mosaic, Masumi is interested in Minene, when the latter disguised herself as a police detective she killed. Even when he learns her real identity as a terrorist, Masumi still continues pursuing a relationship with Minene, much to the latter's confusion. After the incident where Keigo commits suicide, he entrusts Masumi his role of balancing out the other Diary users. Masumi was killed by the Eleventh's men by using himself as a shield of gun shots to protect Minene. In the Third World, Masumi and the Second World Minene is shown to be living happily with their children. ; : :A classmate of Yuki's who used to bully him in the past but later became his friend during the Diary Game. He receive his \\"Kosaka King Diary\\" from the Eighth Diary user. This diary records any \\"triumphs\\" that Kosaka achieves in the future. Its usefulness is limited, however, as Kosaka views everything he does correctly as a great personal triumph, regardless of how small the task. Another serious shortcoming of his diary is that it only records when Kosaka will succeed, and therefore will not update if he is going to fail. He revealed the reason he bullies Yuki is because his 'crybaby face' reminds him of a stupid dog of his. Yuki gets mad and kills him with a pistol. In the Third World, he is seen with Karyuudo, Hinata and Mao. ; : :One of Yuki's new friends in his new school. Her father is actually Karyuudo Tsukishima, the Tenth Diary user. Although she initially attempted to kill Aru she did so under her father's promise (later revealed to be a lie) that they could be a family again. After her father's death, she helps Yuki whenever possible. She receive her \\"Friendship Diary\\" that predicts her friends' actions, from Eighth Diary user. In the Second World, she is killed by Yuki after a failed attempt to convince Yuki the fact that the resurrection of his parents would be impossible even if he were to become god. In the Third World, she is seen with her father and friends. ; : :One of Yuki's new friends in his new school. She is a quiet, polite girl who is constantly photographing the things around her, though her photos mainly center on Hinata. She is in love with Hinata and would do anything for her. She received her \\"Hinata Love-Love Diary\\", which allows her to predict Hinata's future similarly to the way Yuno predicts Yuki's, from the Eighth Diary user. In the Second World, she is killed by Yuki after calling him a coward. In the Third World, she is seen with Aru, Kosaka and Hinata. =Amano family= ; : :Yuki's mother who is rarely at home because of her work as a video game programmer. Despite this, she has a very casual and close relationship with her son and even approved Yuno as his girlfriend. However, Rea is oblivious of her son's involvement in the Diary Game and Yuno's true nature. Prior to the series, she divorced her husband, Kurou, for gaining a large debt. She later confronts her ex-husband and is killed by him, unintentionally, when he stabs her for dragging him back to the Sakurami Tower. In the alternative universe, she is seen alive along with her husband, Third World Yuki, and Yuki's new girlfriend Moe Wakaba. :She is named after Rhea, the mother of Jupiter's Greek equivalent, Zeus. ; : :Yuki's father, who is divorced from his wife for gaining a large debt. He appears later trying to reconcile with Yuki and their family. However, this is a facade as Kurou is secretly working under John Bacchus to destroy Yuki's diary without knowing it will kill Yuki, in exchange of having his debts paid. But his plans are foiled by Marco and Ai, forcing him to escape only to encounter his ex-wife whom he accidentally kills. Kurou starts to feel guilt and a desire to make up to his son for what he has done. When he is at a shrine with his son, he is stabbed in the abdomen by Bacchus' men. :He is named after Cronus, the father of Jupiter's Greek equivalent, Zeus. =Gasai family= ; : :Yuno's adoptive mother. Though dead throughout the majority of the storyline, she is shown in the past to have abused and locked Yuno in a cage, and vents her frustrations on her, claiming she is a bad daughter. Saika's abuse of Yuno seemed to be fueled by her own insecurities and self-hatred. In the alternative universe, when the First World Yuno tried to assassinate her Third World self, Saika defends her, and her viewpoint towards her daughter changes for the better. ; : :Yuno's adoptive father. He is known to run the Sakurami City bank that Bacchus uses as a shelter during the invasion where Yuki and Yuno attempt to assassinate Bacchus to win the Survival Game. Unlike Saika, Ushio was never directly abusive towards Yuno, but he intentionally worked longer hours as a means of avoiding Saika due to her ever-increasing emotional instability. Because he was not around, Saika's abuse of Yuno continued unchecked. In the alternative universe, Ushio shown to be a much more caring man to his daughter. =Minor= ; : :A member of Tsubaki's cult and a personal friend of Ai. After the Omekata cult incident, she is seen as an assistant to Kamado. Her diary is the \\"Orphanage Diary\\" which predicts Kamado's orphans actions. She speaks with a polite, yet sarcastic tone. Orin's head is sliced off by Yuno as part of the plan to kill off Kamado. In the Third World, she is seen with Tarou. ; : :Nicknamed , is one of the orphans Kamado took care of. He is very determined to make sure she succeeds in the survival game, feeling she is the only person who can make a better world for the orphans. His diary is the \\"Copy Diary\\" and can mirror the abilities of other diaries. He is very strict with Ai and Marco to the point that both dislike his attitude and think he is annoying. He is killed by Yuno, moments after realizing he was only used as a pawn. In the Third World, he is seen with Orin. ; : :The second-in-command of Tsubaki's cult. He is responsible for her parents' death as well as the constant raping she suffers at the hands of the cult members, not wanting the cult to disband, according to her parents' decision, and took over leadership. In the alternate universe, he is caught trying to bomb Tsubaki's parents' car, changing the future of the cult, including Reisuke's family. ; : :He is the secretary of Sakurami City. His diary is the \\"Secretary Diary\\", which records all of the Mayor's actions. He is killed by Bacchus for becoming a security risk when it is revealed that he will in the future be captured and give up the passwords for the vault in which they are taking shelter. In the anime, Ryuji is tortured and killed by Minene instead. ; : :Yukiteru Amano and Yuno Gasai's classmate one year prior to the events of the series. Yukiteru had a crush on her but she turns him down after he gives her a love letter, much to Yuno's relief. Moe reappears in the Third World, after Yuno traps Yuki in an illusion world in which Yuno does not exist, and Yuki can have anything he wants, and Moe is the girl Yuki wants, but Yuki denies her (while, in the anime, she even undresses to seduce him). After the Survival Game concludes, the Moe of the Third World is in a romantic relationship with the Yukiteru of the Third World, as such both are seen holding hands and smiling at one another.

The MSAR staff works in collaboration with the admissions offices at each medical school and combined B.S./M.D. program to compile information about each school and program. This data originates from a number of sources including the: * AAMC Data Warehouse, * Graduation Questionnaire (GQ), * Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) surveys, and * AAMC Tuition and Student Fees Survey. MSAR products are for sale on the AAMC‚Äôs web site, but also college book stores, Barnes and Noble.com and Amazon.com  History  The last edition of the MSAR was printed in 1947, and it was called the, ‚ÄúHandbook for Advisors to Students Planning to Enter Medicine.‚Äù Since then, the MSAR was published annually as a print guidebook for prospective medical students. The book was traditionally divided into two sections: information for entering class and school profiles. Originally, information centered around the application process (interviews, MCAT, letters of reference), but it later grew to include information about admissions decisions, diversity in medical schools, financing a medical education, deciding upon a career in medicine, and how undergraduate students can prepare for medical school. The school profile section contained information on General Information, the school‚Äôs mission, curricular highlights, selection factors, financial aid, information on diversity programs, campus setting, enrollment, special features, Regional and Satellite campuses and the application process. The 2000-2001 edition was the Special 50th Edition of the MSAR. The 2012-2013 edition of the MSAR was published as a guidebook and web site called MSAR Online. With this change, extensive school profile information was moved into an online format where students could compare information in a more accessible format. A condensed, one page version of the school profile was kept as part of the printed book. The MSAR Online site includes functions for advanced searches, data sorting, school browsing at a glance, saving favorites, comparing schools and a notes feature. Today, three versions of the MSAR are available: a printed guide book, MSAR Online, and an e-reader. In the first six months after launching the MSAR and Medical School Directory was viewed by users in 162 countries.  MSAR Print Guidebook  The MSAR guidebook is one of three MSAR products. It includes chapters with information about undergraduate course selection, taking the MCAT, applying to medical school, the AMCAS application, how admission decisions are made, financing a medical education, medical school diversity information, and how to choose the best school for you. This information is collected annually from schools and programs, and a range of data sources including: * AAMC Data Warehouse, * Graduation Questionnaire (GQ), * Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) surveys, and * AAMC Tuition and Student Fees Survey.  MSAR Online  The MSAR Online allows users to perform advanced searches, sort data, browse schools at a glance, save favorites, compare schools, save notes, and access additional data not printed in the paper version of the guidebook. The MSAR Online provides profiles of each LCME-accredited US medical school, Canadian medical schools, and combined BS/MD programs. Each medical school profile includes over 100 pieces of information and data including: * MCAT and GPA data, * Medical school class profiles, * Education costs and financial aid packages, * M.D./Ph.D. and other combined degree programs, * Data on applicant volunteer and research experiences, * Graduates‚Äô specialty choices, * Commitment to primary care, * Global health experience participation, * Affiliated hospitals, and * Research opportunities. The MSAR Online recently debuted the ‚ÄúMy Notes‚Äù feature, which allows users to write, save, edit and print messages regarding specific schools for future reference. Each user can view their own notes and print them to bring to advising sessions, campus tours, or interviews.

It is taller than its predecessor, the Singapore Flyer, which had held the record since 2008. Design High Roller was announced in August 2011 as the centerpiece of Caesars Entertainment Corporation's $550 million The LINQ. Arup Engineering, which previously consulted on the Singapore Flyer, acted as the structural engineer. The wheel rotates on a pair of custom-designed spherical roller bearings, each weighing approximately . Each bearing has an outer diameter of , an inner bore of , and a width of . The outer rim comprises 28 sections, each long, which were temporarily held in place during construction by a pair of radial struts, prior to being permanently secured by four cables. The passenger cabins (or capsules) are mounted on the wheel's outboard rim and are individually rotated by electric motors to smoothly maintain a horizontal cabin floor throughout each full rotation. Preliminary designs anticipated 32 passenger cabins, each with a 40-passenger capacity --with the final design accommodating 28 40-person cabins and a total capacity of 1,120 passengers. Each cabin weighs approximately , has a diameter of , includes of glass, and is equipped with eight flat-screen televisions. At night the wheel is illuminated by a 2,000-LED system which can display a single solid color, differently colored sections, multiple colors moving around the rim, and custom displays for special events and holidays. Construction Located on Las Vegas Boulevard, across from Caesars Palace, construction was originally scheduled to begin in September 2011 with a late 2013 completion; subsequently revised to early 2014. The outer rim of the wheel was completed on September 9, 2013. The first passenger cabin was delivered and installed in November 2013 and the final cabin was installed the following month. After preliminary testing, High Roller's lighting system was illuminated at sunset on February 28, 2014. High Roller opened to the public at 4 p.m. EST on March 31, 2014. Ticketing Tickets were originally expected to cost less than $20 per ride, but estimates had risen to \\"about $25 per person\\" by mid-2012 then \\"about $30 per person\\" in September 2013 news reports. When High Roller opened to the public in March 2014, tickets for a single 30-minute ride, the time taken for the entire wheel to rotate once, cost $24.95 (daytime) and $34.95 (nighttime). Other ticket options included a $59.95 Express Pass, allowing the holder to skip the line and ride any time. Successor as world's tallest The Ain Dubai in the United Arab Emirates will be taller than High Roller if completed as proposed. The Ain Dubai was announced in February 2013, with construction to begin in June 2013 and completion in 2015. Construction eventually began almost two years behind schedule in May 2015. Erection of the main support structure was completed in 2016. Further delays have pushed the target opening to October 20, 2020, coinciding with Expo 2020.

Planned by the North Eastern Electric Supply Company (NESCo) in 1944, it was never realised as the scheme faced stiff opposition from those who claimed it would obstruct views of the historic Durham Cathedral from the East Coast Main Line. A number of people supported the scheme as it would help meet the increasing demand for electricity and provide much needed jobs in the post- depression, post-war economy of Britain. The station, which had been designed by architect Giles Gilbert Scott, would have been operational by the late 1940s and would have generated 150 megawatts of electricity. However, following a public inquiry the plans were not approved and instead NESCo installed additional capacity at their existing power stations. Background After several years of preliminary planning, surveying sites and drawing up plans, the North Eastern Electric Supply Company (NESCo) bought the site of a large rifle range, over both sides of the River Wear, at Kepier, north east of the city of Durham, and in early 1944 publicly announced their plans to build a large coal-fired power station on the site. The station was part of a post- war plan by NESCo, and the scheme had a projected cost of ¬£3,500,000. The site was chosen in the mid-Durham area to be close to the coal supplies. It also needed to be a short distance from the River Wear, downstream of Durham, and on solid foundations. Mine workings in County Durham restricted the number of possible sites which could meet the requirement for solid foundations. The site also required good road and rail access. The estimated build time for the station was around four years, and once completed the station was expected to employ around 300 people. In June 1944, NESCo formally submitted their plans for consent of construction. Design The station's site plans and elevations were designed by Giles Gilbert Scott. He had previously designed Battersea Power Station in London, and so the designs of the Kepier station were considered to have been of a very high architectural quality. NESCo claimed that the design of the station would be considered \\"a credit to the whole district\\". The main station building was to be in height. The station would have burned between 1,500 and 2,000 tonnes of low-grade coal per week, to produce 150 megawatts (MW) of electricity. The coal was to be taken from mines in County Durham, and transported to the station by the Durham goods branch of the Leamside Line railway, which terminated at nearby Gilesgate. New sidings would have been required to reach the site from the railway line, which would have required cutting into the hillside above Kepier. Upon arriving at the station, coal would have been discharged from the wagons above the station and transported via a conveyor belt over six arches down to the station itself. The coal burnt would have had an estimated ash content of between 14% and 22%, and so at a cost of ¬£160,000, the company were to install electrostatic precipitators, to remove 97% of the dust from the smoke and waste gases from combustion, before leaving the two high chimneys. The view at the time was that the remaining dust that would leave the chimneys would not have caused \\"any appreciable pollution\\", and the waste gases, consisting of carbon dioxide, were thought not to \\"cause any injury or harm to the inhabitants of the city, to buildings or to vegetation.\\" Between 350 and 450 tonnes of bottom ash clinker would be produced by the station per week. NESCo intended to sell this on to local construction companies as a construction material and believed there was a ready market for this. Fly ash from the precipitators would also have built up, and NESCo claimed they would have spread this on land to the west of the station, and mixed it with soil to produce a high spoil tip. The station would have featured six high cooling towers. It was said that there would be provision to prevent excessive amounts of steam leaving the cooling towers, with no haze coming from the towers on 95% of days of the year. Criticism and support It was thought that the power station would interfere with views of Durham Cathedral from the railway line When the plans were first announced the county surveyor raised no objections, and it was not until October 1943 and onwards that the Ministry of Town and Country Planning began to increasingly warn of the opposition that was bound to arise against the scheme. The plans were strongly opposed by Thomas Wilfred Sharp, an urban planner from Durham, who thought that the station would intrude on the city's skyline. They were also opposed by The City of Durham Preservation Society (now the City of Durham Trust) which had been founded two years earlier. At the time the station had been given the go ahead by Durham City Council and the planning authority, but the Trust believed the station's tall chimneys and cooling towers would dwarf the nearby Durham Cathedral. NESCo argued that they thought the power station would enhance the city's attractions, with people coming to see the power station itself. At the least, they tried to assure the public that if built, the station would take as little away from the city as possible. An official statement from the company stated: > \\"Consultants of every kind will be employed in connection with the > construction, and the City Corporation can rest assured that every > precaution will be taken both in the design and the working of the station > to cause as little harm as possible to the amenities of the City.\\" NESCo also argued that they had chosen the site to protect the city's amenities, in that it was outside the city boundary, partially surrounded by higher ground, and in the lee of prevailing winds. They also said that much could be done architecturally to fit the station into its surroundings. Local trade unions, Durham County Council, and even the Farmers' Union were in support of the scheme, along with a number of private persons, the general reason being that it would bring a new form of employment to the city and surrounding areas. Opponents to the station however claimed that the new jobs at the power station would go to specialist technicians brought into the region, and that the positioning of the station near Durham would not be beneficial to the city's electricity supply or make the cost of electricity any cheaper for those living near the station. Critics also claimed that wherever in the region a new power station were to be built, County Durham coal would be used in it, and that despite NESCo's claims, there may be more suitable sites elsewhere. The critics claimed that Durham's functioning as a cultural, educational, administrative and tourist centre, would be ultimately destroyed by heavy industrialisation. At a meeting of Durham County Council on 26 July 1944, J.W. Foster, chairman of the Finance Committee of the council, spoke in favour of the proposals, claiming they would fulfill the Government's White Paper on Employment Policy, and its policy on the rehabilitation of depressed areas. At the outbreak of war, the north of the country had still not fully recovered from the Great Depression of the 1930s, and Foster believed the employment the station's construction and maintenance provided would help prevent a return to those conditions. It was also seen that the station would generally improve the supply of electricity for industry. He pointed out that the criticism of the scheme was based entirely on assumption that the station would \\"destroy the Medieval charm of the city\\", without taking into account the thoughts of the experts who designed the station. He also pointed out that the critics made their comments without any suggestion of an alternative, and that their campaign against the scheme had attracted publicity through a BBC broadcast. Foster also claimed that if any other feasible site could be found, then it should be used to avoid any violation of the view. However, he warned that the interest of the county's economy should be put in front of the concerns of \\"those ill-informed critics, who view Durham from the railway ... passing from one more fortunate district to another.\\" Durham MP Charles Grey later referred to the development as \\"vital to the well being of the County of Durham\\". British architect Frederick Gibberd published a diagrammatic comparison of Durham Cathedral alongside a power station typical of the design of the time, like the one planned at Kepier. This made clear that, although the cathedral was one of the largest in the country, it still would looked small next to the projected power station. It was argued that as long as the two structures were viewed simultaneously, the visual juxtaposition would be detrimental to the cathedral. Somewhat ironically, Gibberd's Didcot Power Station would later be voted the third worst eyesore in Britain in 2003. Although geographically located north east and lower, it was thought that Kepier power station would dominate any view into which it entered and that it would enter into most of the views in the city. A Northern Echo reader summarised these ideas in 1944: > \\"As the traveller by train approaches Kepier and Durham from the North there > would meet his eye in the foreground this vast power station. Kepier, a > local beauty spot, and the picturesque remains of Kepier Hospital, a > building of much historic interest, would be blotted out, the Castle and > Cathedral beyond would be dwarfed by an incongruous mass of concrete > buildings ill sorting with the landscape.\\" Inquiry After the suggestion by the head of the Ministry of War Transport Cyril Hurcomb to conduct a joint local hearing chaired by an outsider was turned down by the Government due to much greater means being needed, the Government agreed that a public inquiry should be opened. A public inquiry into the plans was opened in December 1944, with the hearing lasting for three days. The Ministry of Town and Country Planning appointed Hurcomb as the chairman of the inquiry. The Electricity Commissioners appointed George Pepler and C.G. Morley New. The key opponents of the scheme were the City of Durham Preservation Society, chaired by Cyril Alington. NESCo were represented by Craig Henderson and Sydney Turner. The NESCo representatives argued that although the company already supplied around 85% of the North East region, a great deal more generating capacity would need to be built to meet the demand for years to come, and that the mid-Durham area was the best place to erect a new station. Henderson claimed the only real opposition to the scheme was that it would interfere with the amenities of Durham. John Hacking, chief engineer of the Central Electricity Board, backed NESCo because if the scheme were declined, and consent and new arrangements had to be made, they would have no new plant in operation until after 1948. A Plasticine model of the station, city and surroundings was used in the inquiry. It was accompanied by a certificate of essentiality, issued by the Electricity Commissioners. Photographs of the city were also shown with the power station superimposed. During the hearing, Hurcomb pointed out a letter published in The Times in July 1944, in which the Bishop and Dean of Durham, and Warden of the Durham Colleges, had given the misleading impression that the proposed station would ruin views from the railway line, an idea compounded by the publication a few days later of a photograph taken from the proposed site. He acknowledged that a number of views from parts of the river would be ruined, and that the station would be visible from the Cathedral and church, Hurcomb emphasised that the majority of the beautiful views around the city would remain. Pepler also found that from the railway station, the power station and the Cathedral could not be viewed simultaneously. The members of the inquiry initially concluded that the station should be given the go-ahead, based on the grounds that a more suitable site could not be decided upon. The City of Durham Preservation Society, however, argued that with so many of Europe's finest monuments being destroyed in the Second World War, Durham and its cathedral was a gem which had survived both the war and the \\"industrial despoliation which had laid waste so much of the rest of the County\\". Pepler supported the view that Durham was more suited as an administrative, shopping, and tourist centre, than it was for large-scale industrial development. Legal and political difficulties caused a long delay in reaching a decision. An important issue was whether or not the inquiry was subject to the new Town and Country Planning Act of 1944. NESCo from the beginning challenged the right of the Minister of Town and Planning, W. S. Morrison, to convene an inquiry at all. The initial legal advice to the Government was that it was not subject, and the inquiry was convened with terms of reference that they were to consider whether a proposed new or extended station could supply sufficient electricity to meet the needs of consumers at no greater cost than any alternative source of supply. In Hurcomb's view the inquiry could not refuse consent if these conditions were met. A later decision by the Treasury Solicitor that the inquiry was, in fact, subject to the Act had the effect of paralysing decision making. If Hurcomb persisted in adhering to his terms of reference and approved the power station, but Durham Rural District Council then withheld planning consent on the grounds of the objections, NESCo would be entitled to compensation for their losses due to the delay and building on a new site. The District Council would be liable for this but it was out of the question that they would be able to afford the large amount involved and the Government wished to avoid stepping in to pay themselves. If the inquiry could be persuaded to find against NESCo then no compensation would be payable and Hurcomb came under pressure from Ministers to do just that. Hurcomb argued that this would be denying compensation to those entitled to it and by April 1945 the decision on the station was still being delayed. The chairman of NESCo at the time voiced his anger in The Times, and Frank Tribe, secretary of the Ministry of Fuel and Power, wrote to Hurcomb asking if anything could be done to bring the inquiry to a decision. Eventually, Hurcomb put forward at a ministerial meeting a solution whereby the members of the inquiry would inform NESCo that on purely technical grounds they would have approved the scheme, but due to the opposition of Morrison, they had decided not to proceed to a decision. Although NESCo were initially hostile, in June 1945 they agreed to drop the scheme on condition that they received a letter from Morrison agreeing that they had satisfied the commissioners on technical grounds, thus entitling them to compensation. The Government thought the site was open to well founded objections, and even if the scheme had proceeded past the inquiry stage, they would have refused consent anyway. Outcome Ultimately, the decision of the inquiry went against NESCo and those in support of the station, and the company dropped their plans. NESCo received an ex gratia payment of ¬£6,650 from the Ministry of Town and Country Planning for the expenditure incurred to that point. The site itself was inherited by the nationalised British Electricity Authority in 1948 and they eventually sold it. On 9 October 1945, Minister of Town and Country Planning Lewis Silkin made clear in the House of Commons that NESCo had begun extending their existing power stations by installing additional generating plant at sites other than Kepier, sufficing the demand for electricity, and meaning no station was needed at Kepier.

He submitted his resignation as prime minister on 24 February 2012, and was officially succeeded by Laurent Lamothe on 16 May 2012. Early life Garry Conille is the second of a family of four brothers (Serge, Pierre and Jean Conille). He is the son of Marie Antoinette Darbouze and Dr. Serge Conille, former Minister of Sports and Youth in the Duvalier government. He is married to Betty Rousseau, the step daughter of Marc Bazin, a former Prime Minister of Haiti and has twin girls, Soraya and Gaelle. Betty and her twin sister Kathy are Bazin's daughters from his wife Marie Yol√®ne ( n√©e) Sam) first mariage. At the age of 14, he played soccer in the 2nd division of Haiti. He is also a music and arts master and performed at Carnegie Hall, in New York at the age of five. Medical career After graduating from Coll√®ge Canado-Ha√Øtien and the Faculty of Medecine and Pharmacy of University of Haiti, Garry Conille obtained an MA in Political and Health Administration, as a fellow of the Fulbright Scholar Program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Afterwards, he received a certificate of specialty in Gynecology and Obstetrics at Isa√Øe Jeanty maternity and a PH.D. in Medicine at the University of Haiti. Between July 1994 and June 1998, at the Haitian Association for the National Development, he developed and implemented a primary care system that provided basic health care in poor areas of Haiti. In August 1999, as an evaluation consultant, Garry Conille was responsible for the impact assessment of the Albert Schweitzer Hospital, an NGO in the field of community development, providing community care to over 260,000 people in Artibonite. Between the years 2000 - 2004, he created and hosted at Radio Vision 2000 the first national interactive program focused on issues related to reproductive and sexual health. United Nations career Garry Conille began his career with the United Nations in 1999, as project officer (October 1999 - April 2001), then programme officer (April 2001 - October 2002) at United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Haiti. Between October 2002 and May 2004, he was technical advisor at Population Services International (PSI) Haiti. In May 2004, he became an international official inside the United Nations system. Until January 2006, he was technical advisor of countries, then sub-regional technical advisor for UNFPA, Division Africa/Ethiopia. In this capacity, he was responsible for providing technical assistance and for ensuring capacity building in key areas of population and health reproduction. In January - December 2006 he worked in a different field of the UN, as Technical Advisor for the Project Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) of the United Nations. In January 2007, Conille returned to UNFPA as Chief Technical Advisor for the Africa region and Global Program Coordinator for the security of inputs into reproductive health (UNFPA). From September 2008 until his special assignment in Haiti, Garry Conille worked as team leader of the MDG Unit (part of the Office of Development Policy, UNDP). Here he organized jointly with UNDESA the process of preparing the report of the Secretary General on the MDGs, presented at the 2010 G8 Summit and then, with the International Monetary Fund, the preparation of Gleneagles scenarios in more than a dozen African countries. In the wake of Haiti's 2010 earthquake, he was requested by the Administrator of UNDP and the UN Secretary General to assume the duties of head office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary General of the United Nations for Haiti. Conille worked with the Haitian government, the representation of the United Nations in Haiti and the main donors to develop and implement a strategic plan for the reconstruction of Haiti. He was also involved in coordinating the humanitarian response and in the establishment of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission, the central structure of the reconstruction. In June 2011 he resumed his work at UNDP as Resident Representative and Humanitarian Coordinator in Niger. Prime Minister By the end of August 2011, unofficial comments of Haitian politicians indicated that Garry Conille might be the next nomination for the post of Prime Minister. On 5 September, he received the official designation for this office from the President Michel Martelly. This would be the third nomination after Jean-Max Bellerive's resignation on 15 May 2011 and the subsequent rejections by the Senate of the nominees Daniel Rouzier and Bernard Gousse. Conille's nomination faces questions regarding his recent residency, as to whether he fulfills the requirement, prescribed in the Constitution of Haiti, of having resided in the country for five consecutive years prior to ratification. The president countered this argument by saying that Conille was exempt from the residency requirement because he had been working for the United Nations, paying taxes to the United Nations for Haiti. The review and ratification process of his nomination began on 8 September 2011. Chamber Deputies approved his appointment on September 16, in a unanimous vote. On October 5, 2011, the Haitian Parliament confirmed Garry Conille's appointment as Prime Minister, making him the 16th and the youngest Prime Minister under the current 1987 Constitution of the country. =Resignation= Conille resigned on February 24, 2012, following a loss of confidence in him from his ministers. He had clashed with ministers and Martelly over several issues, most recently a parliamentary investigation into government officials who hold dual nationality, which is illegal in Haiti. Martelly refused to comply with the investigation, stating the executive branch did not have to comply with the investigation. Some ministers cooperated with the investigation, but others refused. When Conille called a meeting with ministers to discuss the matter, none appeared. That incident demonstrated their lack of confidence and triggered the resignation. Conille remains prime minister until his successor is appointed, according to Article 165 of the constitution. He is succeeded by Laurent Lamothe after going through both parliamentary legislative branch voting results with formal appointment in May 2012; he also held before his nomination and still keeps the ministry control for Foreign Affairs and Cults (Worships).

It later appeared on a number of Cheap Trick live and compilation albums, and was covered by Scrawl on their 1991 album Bloodsucker. Cheap Trick version Although it did not appear until their third album, \\"High Roller\\" dates back to the mid-1970s and was one of the first songs the band wrote after coming together. Zander initiated writing the song and came up with the melody, and Nielsen and Petersson chipped in to fill in parts when Zander felt the song needed something more. The lyrics were inspired by a drug dealer from Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. The song's protagonist brags about being a \\"high roller\\" and that \\"I always get the things that I choose.\\" The riff was adapted from the rhythm and blues standard \\"Route 66.\\" Critic Dave Swanson describes the riff as \\"simple and dynamic\\" and praises Nielsen's guitar solo. On the other hand, critic Bryan Wawzenek is particularly effusive in praising Bun E. Carlos's drumming on the song, comparing his fills to The Rolling Stones' Charlie Watts. Wawzenek also uses the song as an example of how Carlos can \\"pound along with the best glam drummers,\\" and states that there is \\"not a beat out of place.\\" Wawzenek also calls Zander's singing \\"great,\\" remarking how he makes \\"the hot-shot lothario\\" who is the protagonist of the song \\"sound both really cool and really dangerous.\\" Bob Sled also praises the way the vocal \\"shifts convincingly\\" between rocking and introspection. Author Mike Hayes states that Tom Werman's production on Heaven Tonight softened the song compared to its live renditions. In Australia, \\"High Roller\\" was released as the B-side of Heaven Tonight's second single \\"California Man.\\" It was performed at the 1978 concerts in Japan that led to the live album Cheap Trick at Budokan but was not included on the original 1979 release of that album. That performance was, however, released on the 1994 release Budokan II, as well as on therelease of the complete concert in 1998. Hayes claims that this live version \\"eclipses the original with snarling, up front guitars.\\" Associated Press critic Steven Wine calls it one of Cheap Trick's \\"best rockers.\\" An alternate take of \\"High Roller\\" was included on the 1996 compilation album Sex, America, Cheap Trick.

Sha Tin Wai () is an area in Sha Tin District, New Territories, Hong Kong, named after Sha Tin Wai village (). Name The name of the Sha Tin area allegedly comes from the fact that British colonial officials mistook the name of Sha Tin Wai village as the name of the area. History The village was established by the Tse (), Cheng () and Lam () clans from Pok Law (Boluo County) in the mid-17th century. Each of the clans has their own ancestral hall.East Rail Extensions - Tai Wai to Ma On Shan. Environmental Impact Assessment Report. Archaeological and Cultural Resources, p 9.8, 1999 One of the branch of Tse relocated to nearby Yuen Chau Kok to establish their own village. The village was originally built on the Sha Tin Sea waterfront. As a consequence of successive land reclamation of the former estuary that started in 1905, it is now separated from the Shing Mun River by Sha Kok Estate. The Estate was built in Sha Tin New Town-era. Houses of the traditional villages were then built in front of the initial row of houses, and as a consequence, half of today's Sha Tin Wai is built on reclaimed land. Sha Tin Wai village, its surrounding area, as well as area around Sha Tin station in the opposite shore of Sha Tin Sea, were studied by HKU student in 1963 as a possible site of building Hong Kong's satellite town. Those area were indeed selected by the government to become part of Sha Tin New Town project, which included land reclamation of Sha Tin Sea. The modern day Shing Mun River was the residual of the Sha Tin Sea.

A successfully transcreated message evokes the same emotions and carries the same implications in the target language as it does in the source language. It is related to the concept of localization, which similarly involves comprehensively adapting a translated text for the target audience. Transcreation highlights the translator's creative role. Unlike many other forms of translation, transcreation also often involves adapting not only words, but video and images to the target audience. Transcreation theory was first developed in the field of literary translation, and began to be adapted for use global marketing and advertising in the early 21st century. The transcreation approach is also heavily used today in the translation of video games and mobile apps. The concept of transcreation emphasizes the translator's independent creative role. In the context of marketing, the professional translators engaging in transcreation are often referred to as \\"copywriters\\" or \\"copyeditors\\", or alternatively as \\"transcreators\\".  Background  The concept of transcreation was first developed by translators in India and Brazil in the mid-20th century. In 1964, the Indian scholar Purushottama Lal wrote, regarding contemporary translations of the Sanskrit classics, that \\"the translator must edit, reconcile, and transmute; his job in many ways becomes largely a matter of transcreation\\". In the Brazilian context, the term is associated with the work of Haroldo de Campos, who compared transcreation to the giving of a blood transfusion. The term is also recognized in China. In 2010, the Chinese design and advertising publication, Modern Advertising Magazine, discussed the term in an article for the first time. Translated article Examples In popular culture, one example of the use of a strongly transcreational approach is in the United States adaptation of the Japanese anime Doraemon, in which characters and settings were dramatically modified to suit United States sensibilities. For example, depictions of Japanese yen notes were replaced by United States currency, and a stand selling roasted sweet potato was replaced by a food truck selling popcorn. Similarly, the United States story of Spider-Man was transcreated for Indian audiences in Spider-Man: India, which is set in Mumbai. This transcreated Spider-Man features an Indian-born Spider-Man whose ‚Äúreal‚Äù name is Pavitr Prabhakar. Thus, rather than battling the Green Goblin in the canyons of New York City, Prabhakar, clad in a dhoti, fights the demon Rahshasa against backdrops such as the Taj Mahal. \\"Unlike traditional translations of American comics, Spider- Man India will become the first-ever 'transcreation', where we reinvent the origin of a Western property,\\" said Sharad Devarajan, the chief executive of the Gotham Entertainment Group. The goal in this case closely matched that of cross-cultural marketers: to make Spider-Man more relevant to the Indian audience, establish a deeper emotional connection with readers, and thus sell more comic books. The concept of transcreation has also been applied to other specialized fields such as technical and legal translation. For example, the creation of new technical vocabulary by specialized Icelandic translators in the mid-20th century has been retrospectively characterized as transcreation. Accordingly, one author has defined transcreation as a \\"holistic\\" process of \\"re-interpretation of the original work suited to the readers/audience of the target language which requires the translator to come up with new conceptual, linguistic and cultural constructs to make up for the lack (or inadequacy) of existing ones.\\"  Purpose  As markets continue to broaden, advertisers face special challenges. To be effective, advertising must reach hearts as well as minds. Thus, the ability to transcend language and cultural boundaries is paramount to achieving an effective global marketing strategy. Not only must copy be translated correctly, but other factors must also be considered, such as culture, mores, dialects, idiom, humor, and context. Any perceived lack of respect for heritage, local values, beliefs and cultures may have a negative impact on consumers. To meet these challenges, companies that market internationally are increasingly using transcreation, whether via their advertising company or with a company specializing in transcreation. The tasks of a transcreator include establishing an emotional connection between the audience and the message, and maximizing cultural relevance. Many factors may differ across cultural and linguistic boundaries and must be considered, as these differences can significantly limit the effectiveness and impact of a cross-market campaign. These factors include cultural heritage, shared values, practices, and prevalent social cueing and reception thereof, including expression of emotions, gestures, body language, and facial expressions. These factors in turn influence consumers‚Äô behavior and their reactions to advertising elements such as text, tone of voice, humor, settings, casting, and tonality.  Relationship to translation  Classically, in a schema dating from the 17th century, translation has been divided into three approaches: metaphrase (word-for-word translation), paraphrase (i.e. ‚Äúsay in other words‚Äù), and imitation. Transcreation is thus a variation on the \\"imitation\\" or \\"adaptation\\" approach to translation. Similarly, viewed in terms of the continuum between free translation and literal translation, transcreation is considered to be \\"closest to ‚Äòfree‚Äô on the literal ‚Äì free cline.\\" The validity of transcreation as a distinct form of translation, however, has been questioned. While the term has been widely embraced by translation brokers seeking new business, it has been greeted with considerably more skepticism by professional translators.  Commercial use  In the 21st century, some translation agencies began to specifically market themselves as transcreation agencies. Transcreation allows local marketers to take the essence of a global advertising message and tailor it to their market. Thus, a global advertising campaign subjected to transcreation becomes more supple, while still adhering to an overall global strategy. Accordingly, the rise of transcreation has paralleled the growth in international marketing campaigns. In 1960, international billings accounted for 6% of the gross revenues of the top ten U.S. advertising agencies. By 1991, that share had climbed to 60%, and it has been rising ever since,Ducoffe, Robert, and Andreas Grein. 1998. ‚ÄúStrategic Responses to market globalization among advertising agencies‚Äù.

Musical preferences are biased toward culturally familiar musical traditions beginning in infancy, and adults' classification of the emotion of a musical piece depends on both culturally specific and universal structural features. Additionally, individuals' musical memory abilities are greater for culturally familiar music than for culturally unfamiliar music. The sum of these effects makes culture a powerful influence in music cognition.  Preferences  = Effect of culture = Culturally bound preferences and familiarity for music begin in infancy and continue through adolescence and adulthood. People tend to prefer and remember music from their own cultural tradition. Ethnomusicologists, people who study the relationship between music and culture, never truly understand the music of the culture that they are studying, even if they spend years of their lives with that culture, they never really understand. Familiarity for culturally regular meter styles is already in place for young infants of only a few months' age. The looking times of 4- to 8-month old Western infants indicate that they prefer Western meter in music, while Turkish infants of the same age prefer both Turkish and Western meters (Western meters not being completely unfamiliar in Turkish culture). Both groups preferred either meter when compared with arbitrary meter. In addition to influencing preference for meter, culture affects people's ability to correctly identify music styles. Adolescents from Singapore and the UK rated familiarity and preference for excerpts of Chinese, Malay, and Indian music styles. Neither group demonstrated a preference for the Indian music samples, although the Singaporean teenagers recognized them. Participants from Singapore showed higher preference for and ability to recognize the Chinese and Malay samples; UK participants showed little preference or recognition for any of the music samples, as those types of music are not present in their native culture. = Effect of musical experience = An individual's musical experience may affect how they formulate preferences for music from their own culture and other cultures. American and Japanese individuals (non-music majors) both indicated preference for Western music, but Japanese individuals were more receptive to Eastern music. Among the participants, there was one group with little musical experience and one group that had received supplemental musical experience in their lifetimes. Although both American and Japanese participants disliked formal Eastern styles of music and preferred Western styles of music, participants with greater musical experience showed a wider range of preference responses not specific to their own culture. = Dual cultures = Bimusicalism is a phenomenon in which people well-versed and familiar with music from two different cultures exhibit dual sensitivity to both genres of music. In a study conducted with participants familiar with Western, Indian, and both Western and Indian music, the bimusical participants (exposed to both Indian and Western styles) showed no bias for either music style in recognition tasks and did not indicate that one style of music was more tense than the other. In contrast, the Western and Indian participants more successfully recognized music from their own culture and felt the other culture's music was more tense on the whole. These results indicate that everyday exposure to music from both cultures can result in cognitive sensitivity to music styles from those cultures. Bilingualism typically confers specific preferences for the language of lyrics in a song. When monolingual (English-speaking) and bilingual (Spanish- and English-speaking) sixth graders listened to the same song played in an instrumental, English, or Spanish version, ratings of preference showed that bilingual students preferred the Spanish version, while monolingual students more often preferred the instrumental version; the children's self-reported distraction was the same for all excerpts. Spanish (bilingual) speakers also identified most closely with the Spanish song. Thus, the language of lyrics interacts with a listener's culture and language abilities to affect preferences.  Emotion recognition  The cue-redundancy model of emotion recognition in music differentiates between universal, structural auditory cues and culturally bound, learned auditory cues (see schematic below). = Psychophysical cues = Structural cues that span all musical traditions include dimensions such as pace (tempo), loudness, and timbre. Fast tempo, for example, is typically associated with happiness, regardless of a listener's cultural background. = Culturally bound cues = Culture-specific cues rely on knowledge of the conventions in a particular musical tradition. Ethnomusicologists have said that there are certain situations in which a certain song would be sung in different cultures. These times are marked by cultural cues and by the people of that culture. A particular timbre may be interpreted to reflect one emotion by Western listeners and another emotion by Eastern listeners. There could be other culturally bound cues as well, for example, rock n' roll music is usually identified to be a rebellious type of music associated with teenagers and the music reflects their ideals and beliefs that their culture believes. = Cue-redundancy model = Schematic of the cue-redundancy model.According to the cue-redundancy model, individuals exposed to music from their own cultural tradition utilize both psychophysical and culturally bound cues in identifying emotionality. Conversely, perception of intended emotion in unfamiliar music relies solely on universal, psychophysical properties. Japanese listeners accurately categorize angry, joyful, and happy musical excerpts from familiar traditions (Japanese and Western samples) and relatively unfamiliar traditions (Hindustani). Simple, fast melodies receive joyful ratings from these participants; simple, slow samples receive sad ratings, and loud, complex excerpts are perceived as angry. Strong relationships between emotional judgments and structural acoustic cues suggest the importance of universal musical properties in categorizing unfamiliar music. When both Korean and American participants judged the intended emotion of Korean folksongs, the American group's identification of happy and sad songs was equivalent to levels observed for Korean listeners. Surprisingly, Americans exhibited greater accuracy in anger assessments than the Korean group. The latter result implies cultural differences in anger perception occur independently of familiarity, while the similarity of American and Korean happy and sad judgments indicates the role of universal auditory cues in emotional perception. Categorization of unfamiliar music varies with intended emotion. Timbre mediates Western listeners' recognition of angry and peaceful Hindustani songs. Flute timbre supports the detection of peace, whereas string timbre aids anger identification. Happy and sad assessments, on the other hand, rely primarily on relatively \\"low-level\\" structural information such as tempo. Both low-level cues (e.g., slow tempo) and timbre aid in the detection of peaceful music, but only timbre cued anger recognition. Communication of peace, therefore, takes place at multiple structural levels, while anger seems to be conveyed nearly exclusively by timbre. Similarities between aggressive vocalizations and angry music (e.g., roughness) may contribute to the salience of timbre in anger assessments. = Stereotype theory of emotion in music = The stereotype theory of emotion in music (STEM) suggests that cultural stereotyping may affect emotion perceived in music. STEM argues that for some listeners with low expertise, emotion perception in music is based on stereotyped associations held by the listener about the encoding culture of the music (i.e., the culture representative of a particular music genre, such as Brazilian culture encoded in Bossa Nova music). STEM is an extension of the cue-redundancy model because in addition to arguing for two sources of emotion, some cultural cues can now be specifically explained in terms of stereotyping. Particularly, STEM provides more specific predictions, namely that emotion in music is dependent to some extent on the cultural stereotyping of the music genre being perceived. = Complexity = Because musical complexity is a psychophysical dimension, the cue-redundancy model predicts that complexity is perceived independently of experience. However, South African and Finnish listeners assign different complexity ratings to identical African folk songs. Thus, the cue-redundancy model may be overly simplistic in its distinctions between structural feature detection and cultural learning, at least in the case of complexity. = Repetition = When listening to music from within one's own cultural tradition, repetition plays a key role in emotion judgments. American listeners who hear classical or jazz excerpts multiple times rate the elicited and conveyed emotion of the pieces as higher relative to participants who hear the pieces once. = Methodological limitations = Methodological limitations of previous studies preclude a complete understanding of the roles of psychophysical cues in emotion recognition. Divergent mode and tone cues elicit \\"mixed affect\\", demonstrating the potential for mixed emotional percepts. Use of dichotomous scales (e.g., simple happy/sad ratings) may mask this phenomenon, as these tasks require participants to report a single component of a multidimensional affective experience.  Memory  Enculturation is a powerful influence on music memory. Both long-term and working memory systems are critically involved in the appreciation and comprehension of music. Long-term memory enables the listener to develop musical expectation based on previous experience while working memory is necessary to relate pitches to one another in a phrase, between phrases, and throughout a piece. = Neuroscience = A diagram showing the locations of the lobes of the brain. Neuroscientific evidence suggests that memory for music is, at least in part, special and distinct from other forms of memory. The neural processes of music memory retrieval share much with the neural processes of verbal memory retrieval, as indicated by functional magnetic resonance imaging studies comparing the brain areas activated during each task. Both musical and verbal memory retrieval activate the left inferior frontal cortex, which is thought to be involved in executive function, especially executive function of verbal retrieval, and the posterior middle temporal cortex, which is thought to be involved in semantic retrieval. However, musical semantic retrieval also bilaterally activates the superior temporal gyri containing the primary auditory cortex. = Effect of culture =  Memory for music  A diagram showing the locations of the brain's gyri. Despite the universality of music, enculturation has a pronounced effect on individuals' memory for music. Evidence suggests that people develop their cognitive understanding of music from their cultures. People are best at recognizing and remembering music in the style of their native culture, and their music recognition and memory is better for music from familiar but nonnative cultures than it is for music from unfamiliar cultures. Part of the difficulty in remembering culturally unfamiliar music may arise from the use of different neural processes when listening to familiar and unfamiliar music. For instance, brain areas involved in attention, including the right angular gyrus and middle frontal gyrus, show increased activity when listening to culturally unfamiliar music compared to novel but culturally familiar music.  Development  Enculturation affects music memory in early childhood before a child's cognitive schemata for music is fully formed, perhaps beginning at as early as one year of age. Like adults, children are also better able to remember novel music from their native culture than from unfamiliar ones, although they are less capable than adults at remembering more complex music. Children's developing music cognition may be influenced by the language of their native culture. For instance, children in English- speaking cultures develop the ability to identify pitches from familiar songs at 9 or 10 years old, while Japanese children develop the same ability at age 5 or 6. This difference may be due to the Japanese language's use of pitch accents, which encourages better pitch discrimination at an early age, rather than the stress accents upon which English relies.  Musical expectations  Enculturation also biases listeners' expectations such that they expect to hear tones that correspond to culturally familiar modal traditions. For example, Western participants presented with a series of pitches followed by a test tone not present in the original series were more likely to mistakenly indicate that the test tone was originally present if the tone was derived from a Western scale than if it was derived from a culturally unfamiliar scale. Recent research indicates that deviations from expectations in music may prompt out-group derogation.Maher, Van Tilburg & Van den Tol, 2013 = Limits of enculturation = Despite the powerful effects of music enculturation, evidence indicates that cognitive comprehension of and affinity for different cultural modalities is somewhat plastic. One long-term instance of plasticity is bimusicalism, a musical phenomenon akin to bilingualism. Bimusical individuals frequently listen to music from two cultures and do not demonstrate the biases in recognition memory and perceptions of tension displayed by individuals whose listening experience is limited to one musical tradition. Other evidence suggests that some changes in music appreciation and comprehension can occur over a short period of time. For instance, after half an hour of passive exposure to original melodies using familiar Western pitches in an unfamiliar musical grammar or harmonic structure (the Bohlen‚ÄìPierce scale), Western participants demonstrated increased recognition memory and greater affinity for melodies in this grammar. This suggests that even very brief exposure to unfamiliar music can rapidly affect music perception and memory.

It was organized as the first battlefield surveillance brigade in the Army National Guard.  Overview  Since its inception on 1 October 2007, the brigade's mission has been to provide command and control of reconnaissance, surveillance, and intelligence operations in support of a division, corps or joint task force. The headquarters provides command, control and supervision of the tactical operations of the brigade and attached units, while the headquarters company provides unit administration and logistical support for the brigade staff sections. The 560th is authorized an estimated 1,100 soldiers with which to carry out that mission. In October 2010, the 560th BFSB changed command for the first time since its formation, with Colonel Peter VanAmburgh relinquishing full-time command of the 560th to Colonel Thomas Carden, JFHQ's former military personnel officer. An article in the June 15, 2016 edition of the Forsyth County News noted that the 506th BfSB was inactivated in a ceremony held on June 11 \\"at the Cumming Regional Readiness Center, where the unit had operated since the center opened in 2013.

This was also the first exercise where national guard, active duty, and reserve soldiers and military intelligence subject matter experts (SMEs) worked together to evaluate national guard soldiers in preparation for deployment.  Exercises The 560 BFSB has been involved in a number of exercises since its inception. =Northwind 2008= During the period of 27 Feb‚Äì18 Mar 2008, the 560th BFSB sent a command and control (C2) cell to participate in U.S. Army Japan Exercise North Wind 2008. The operation was a bilateral field training exercise with active army and ARNG soldiers training with the Japanese Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF). The 560th BFSB exercised overall command and acted as the higher headquarters for the exercise and the brigade response cell for the staff exercise and collective training. The units involved included the 35th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion; 1-297th Infantry (Alaska ARNG); various ARNG soldiers from California, Florida, and Nebraska; and the 5th Regiment/9th DIV, JGSDF. North Wind 2008 was held in the Iwatesan training area in a remote and mountainous part of north Japan. This was the first known U.S. Army exercise to employ a BFSB as a higher headquarters and as part of a bilateral operation.http://call.army.mil/news from the front[ BFSB_in_the_Attack_CALL_Oct08-6] =Natural Fire 2010= In October 2009, the 560 BFSB participated in Exercise Natural Fire 10, a 13-day exercise oriented on conducting a humanitarian assistance and disaster relief exercise from 16 ‚Äì 25 OCT 09 in the Republic of Uganda in order to enhance interoperability and the capability to respond to complex humanitarian emergencies. The exercise consisted of three events: a table top exercise (TTX) focused on pandemic influenza response, senior manager disaster response, and multinational involvement; a field training exercise (FTX) consisting of area security, entry control point, vehicle control point, convoy security, non lethal weapons, and weapons training; and a humanitarian civic action (HCA) focused on providing medical and dental assistance to the local population. During the exercise, the BFSB ‚Äì as part of Task Force Kitgum ‚Äì performed command and control operations in Kitgum, Uganda, in order to synchronize multinational forces conducting field training exercises and humanitarian civic assistance operations to enhance interoperability among participating forces. the 560 BFSB served as a joint and multinational task force headquarters of over 1000 army, navy, air force, marines and personnel from Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. This was the largest exercise of its kind in East Africa and the first test of a BFSB as a joint and multinational HQs.Center for army lessons learned Newsletter 10-51/JUL 2010/(p61-66) =Yama Sakura 57= In 30 Nov - 13 Dec 2009, 560 BFSB soldiers traveled to Kumamoto, Japan, and Joint Base Lewis-McChord, to participate in Yama Sakura 59 ‚Äì an annual bilateral joint training exercise intended to strengthen the working relationship and combat readiness of the two nations ‚Äì alongside the Japan Self Defense Force and other U.S. military forces. The simulation-based command post exercise underscores the United States‚Äô commitment to Japan's defense in accordance with a mutual defense treaty that was implemented in 1951 and revised in 1960. Yama Sakura was held first in 1982. =KFOR 13= In April 2010, 221 MI mobilized and deployed 32 soldiers as the KFOR 13 Analytical Control Element (ACE) in support of Multinational Division - East located at Camp Bondsteel. =Mulberry Tree 2010= In July and August 2010, a contingent of 100 soldiers from the 51st Scottish Brigade participated in 3-108 Cav's annual training at Camp Merrill and the Catoosa Training Area in the North Georgia Mountains. Training consisted of military operations in urban terrain, weapons familiarization and firing, drivers training, airborne operations and a wing exchange, and the Combat Tracker MTT. =Prickly Pear 2010= In August and September 2010, 3-108 CAV participated in Operation Prickly Pear in Scotland, a 14-day training exchange between the 3-108 CAV (Task Force Recce) and the 51st Scottish Brigade, consisting of weapons training, live fire training, field craft, patrolling, and platoon and below maneuver training. Training was conducted in the Otterburn Training Area and the Kirkcudbright Training Area. =MDMP training= In May 2010 and December 2010, soldiers of the 560th worked specifically with the Ugandan army to set up a military decision making process (MDMP) training event. The idea was to familiarize the Ugandans with U.S. Army Light Infantry MDMP at the tactical battalion level. Uganda's military is highly interested in understanding how the American Army conducts the MDMP based on their operational lessons learned in both the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia. The seminar assisted the process by establishing a basic understanding of roles and responsibilities of a light infantry battalion staff in the MDMP process, MDMP timelines and sequence of events, products or deliverables, and an understanding of how this product aids the field commander. This, in turn, set the foundation for a follow-on MDMP, which will familiarize the Ugandan army with the light infantry decision making process at the brigade level. Such training events also help the U.S. by enhancing awareness in the U.S. military of Ugandan infantry battalion practices, thereby improving interoperability. They also elicit lessons learned from the audience's peacekeeping operations. =KFOR 14= In December 2010, 221 MI mobilized and deployed 32 soldiers as the KFOR 14 Analytical Control Element (ACE) in support of Multinational Division - East located at Camp Bondsteel. =Eurosatory 2010= In June 2010, soldiers from the 560 BFSB participated as liaison officers for senior DOD personnel who attended the 2010 Eurosatory International Land, Airland, and Homeland Defense Exhibition, a U.S. Embassy supported Office of Defense Cooperation joint, combined, and multinational event held in Paris, France. =Yama Sakura 59= In January 2011, 28 soldiers from the 560 BFSB traveled to Kumamoto, Japan to participate in Yama Sakura 59. Exercise Yama Sakura is an annual command post exercise (CPX) that continues to further strengthen the national security interests of Japan and the Asia-Pacific region. The largest bilateral engagement event USARJ facilitates and is the Japan Ground Self Defense Force's (JGSDF) most important bilateral exercise. Particular gains achieved in Yama Sakura are the opportunity to exchange ideas on force structure, doctrine, and equipment with counterparts through: practical and realistic warfighting training in command and staff activities through the use of simulations; and continued improvement of bilateral interoperability. Yama Sakura also contributes to the success of future CPXs by providing opportunities for training and observation by other JGSDF armies. The CPX also enhances the operational readiness of U.S. forces stationed in or destined for Japan. =Atlas Drop 11= In April 2011, the 560th Battlefield Surveillance Brigade were part of a team of guardsmen and airmen who had been training and living together in the bush north of Soroti as part of Atlas Drop 11. The training conducted during the iteration of the annual exercise, sponsored by U.S. Army Africa, sought to increase the capability of both Uganda People's Defence Force and U.S. forces to resupply soldiers operating in remote areas. After completion, all military operations and training exercises were assessed to determine the successes and failures within the mission. =KFOR 15= In August 2011, 221 MI mobilized and deployed soldiers as the KFOR 15 Analytical Control Element (ACE) in support of Multinational Division - East located at Camp Bondsteel. =KFOR 15= In October 2011, 3-108 CAV mobilized and deployed soldiers as the KFOR 15 Tactical Maneuver Force in support of Multinational Division - East located at Camp Bondsteel and Camp Novo Selo. =GTST 2= In January 2012, soldiers from the 560 BFSB deployed to the Republic of Georgia to support the Georgian training mission with maintenance, medical, and communications instructors. The soldiers were deployed for a period of six months. =Eurosatory 2012= In June 2012, soldiers from the 560 BFSB participated as liaison officers for senior DOD personnel who attended the 2010 Eurosatory International Land, Airland, and Homeland Defense Exhibition, a U.S. Embassy supported Office of Defense Cooperation joint, combined, and multinational event held in Paris, France. =GTST 3= In August 2012, soldiers from the 560 BFSB deployed to the Republic of Georgia to support the Georgian training mission with maintenance, medical, and communications instructors. Additionally, personnel served as the camp commandant. The soldiers were deployed for a period of 12 months.

Eyewitness testimony is often relied upon in the judicial system. It can also refer to an individual's memory for a face, where they are required to remember the face of their perpetrator, for example. However, the accuracy of eyewitness memories is sometimes questioned because there are many factors that can act during encoding and retrieval of the witnessed event which may adversely affect the creation and maintenance of the memory for the event. Experts have found evidence to suggest that eyewitness memory is fallible. It has long been speculated that mistaken eyewitness identification plays a major role in the wrongful conviction of innocent individuals. A growing body of research now supports this speculation, indicating that mistaken eyewitness identification is responsible for more convictions of the innocent than all other factors combined. This may be due to the fact that details of unpleasant emotional events are recalled poorly compared to neutral events. States of high emotional arousal, which occur during a stressful or traumatic event, lead to less efficient memory processing. The Innocence Project determined that 75% of the 239 DNA exoneration cases had occurred due to inaccurate eyewitness testimony. It is important to inform the public about the flawed nature of eyewitness memory and the difficulties relating to its use in the criminal justice system so that eyewitness accounts are not viewed as the absolute truth.  Encoding  = During the event =  Challenges of identifying faces  People struggle to identify faces in person or from photos, a difficulty arising from the encoding of faces. When participants were given a basic memory test from an array of photos or a lineup, they struggled to accurately identify the images and had low recognition. This finding provides a starting point for estimating the accuracy of eyewitnesses' identification of others involved in a traumatic event. It can only get more challenging for a person to accurately encode a face when they themselves are experiencing a traumatic event. Because courts rely on eyewitness facial recognition, it is important to acknowledge that identification is not always accurate. Face-specific cognitive and neural processes show contributions to holistic processing and recognition in the episodic memories of eyewitnesses. Unreliability of eyewitness identifications may be a result of mismatching between how faces are holistically processed and how composite systems retrieve features in faces during an event.  Other-race effect  The other-race effect (i.e. the own-race bias, cross- race effect, other-ethnicity effect, same-race advantage) is one factor thought to impact the accuracy of facial recognition. Studies investigating this effect have shown that a person is better able to recognize faces that match their own race but are less reliable at identifying other more unfamiliar races, thus inhibiting encoding. Various explanations for this effect have been proposed. The perceptual expertise account suggests that with an increase of exposure to one's own race, perceptual mechanisms develop which allow people to be more proficient at remembering faces of their own race. The socio-cognitive account predicts that motivational and/or attentional components over focus on the race of a person. Another hypothesis is that each race pays attention to certain facial details to differentiate between faces.Brigham, J. C., Bennett, L. B., Meissner, C. A., & Mitchell, T. L. (2007). The Influence of Race on Eyewitness Memory. In R.C.L. Lindsay, D. F. Ross, J. D. Read, & M. P. Toglia (Eds.), The Handbook of Eyewitness Psychology: Memory for People (pp. 257‚Äì281). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. However, other races might not encode these same features. A final suggestion is that faces of the same race are encoded more deeply, leading a witness to have a more detailed memory for those faces; but there has not been much research to support this hypothesis. Research on the other race effect has mainly focused on the African American and Caucasian races. Most research has shown that white eyewitnesses exhibit the other-race effect, however this effect does extend to other races too. In general, memory is an individual process and that conceptualization of race causes racial ambiguity in facial recognition. Mono-racial eyewitnesses may depend on categorization more than multiracial eyewitnesses, who develop a more fluid concept of race. Perception may affect the immediate encoding of these unreliable notions due to prejudices, which can influence the speed of processing and classification of racially ambiguous targets. The ambiguity in eyewitness memory facial recognition can be attributed to the divergent strategies that are used when under the influence of racial bias. This phenomenon is not limited to race. Stereotypes of any kind (whether they be related to age, gender, etc.) can affect the encoding of information at the time of the event. For example, if one is held at gunpoint by two individuals, one of whom is a man and the other is a woman wearing a hat, the victim may quickly fall back on the belief that men are more likely to be aggressors. Consequently, the victim may encode the situation as involving two male assailants, yielding problematic effects in the process of identifying the assailants later on.  Stress and trauma  Stress or trauma during an event can affect the encoding of the memory. Traumatic events may cause memory to be repressed out of conscious awareness. An inability to access the repressed memory is argued to occur in cases involving child sexual abuse. Another way encoding a memory can be affected is when the person involved in a traumatic event experiences dissociation; he or she mentally removes themselves from the situation, which may serve as a coping mechanism. Lastly, trauma may induce a flashbulb effect; the witness believes they vividly remember significant details of a salient event, although accuracy must be determined of such memories . In legal settings the mental state of an individual at both witnessing a crime and in testimony can affect the success of their memory retrieval. Stress in small amounts is thought to aid memory, whereby stress hormones released by the amygdala promote the consolidation of emotional memories. Nevertheless, stress in high amounts may hinder memory performance. Witnesses of severe crimes or trauma can suffer from further implications, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or even psychogenic amnesia. =Post traumatic stress disorder= Explicit memory (used in legal testimony) is affected by post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); individuals diagnosed with PTSD can struggle to recall explicit events from their memory, usually those which are especially traumatic events. This may be due to the individual preferring not to think about the unpleasant memory, which they may rather forget. Implicit memory, on the other hand, does not seem to be affected in the same way that explicit memory does, rather some individuals with PTSD may score higher on implicit memory tests than non-PTSD individuals. =Psychogenic amnesia= Psychogenic amnesia (or dissociative amnesia) can affect explicit memory for a particular event. Most often cases of psychogenic amnesia occur after witnessing an extremely violent crime or trauma, such as war. =Mood- congruency effect= Everyday memory can be affected by factors such as stress or mood. The 'mood congruency' effect refers to memory being aided by a matching of mood at the encoding/learning stage to the retrieval stage. If a memory is encoded under stressful conditions it may be more likely that the memory is better recalled if stress levels at retrieval are congruent to stress levels at encoding. Mood congruency may affect a witnesses ability to recall a highly stressful crime, if conditions of encoding and retrieval are different. Moderate amounts of stress may be beneficial to memory by the release of corticosteroids. Conversely, too much stress (and therefore an extreme influx of corticosteroids) can affect function of the hippocampus and therefore hinder memory. Very high levels of corticosteroid release may be very detrimental for memory.  Weapon focus  The weapon focus effect suggests that the presence of a weapon narrows a person's attention, thus affects eyewitness memory. A person focuses on the central detail (for example, the weapon) and loses focus on the peripheral details thus resulting in worse perpetrator recall. While the weapon is remembered clearly, the memories of the other details of the scene suffer. The weapon focus effect occurs because additional items require more visual attention, therefore they are frequently not processed. This increased focus of attention on central aspects takes away attentional resources from peripheral details. For example, if a gun was brought into a school, it would attract significant amount of attention, because students are not used to seeing that item. When participants were watching a slideshow, and were seeing an unusual stimulus item, their reaction times were slower (regardless whether the stimulus was dangerous) in comparison to reaction times for more frequent stimulus. When the item was dangerous (i.e. a weapon), participants had a lower accuracy and confidence than the control group's. Another hypothesis is that seeing a weapon might cause an aroused state. In an aroused state, people focus on central details instead of peripheral ones.  Interference  The testimony of a witness can lose validity due to too many external stimuli, that may affect what was witnessed during the crime, and therefore obstruct memory. For example, if an individual witnesses a car accident on a very public street, there may be too many cues distracting the witness from the main focus. Numerous interfering stimulus inputs may suppress the importance of the stimulus of focus, the accident. This can degrade the memory traces of the event, and diminish the representation of those memories. This is known as the cue-overload principle. = After the event = Memory becomes susceptible to contamination when witnesses discuss the event with others and as time passes. This is because memory traces blend with other stories and events that the witness is exposed to after the stressful or traumatic event Because memory is subject to contamination, the most reliable test of a memory is the initial test. Police procedures can reduce the effects of contamination on memory with proper testing protocols.  Misinformation effect  Witnesses can be subject to memory distortions that can alter their account of events. It is of particular interest that the memory of an eyewitness can become compromised by other information, such that an individual's memory becomes biased. This can increase eyewitnesses sensitivity to the misinformation effect. Individuals report what they believe to have witnessed at the time of the crime, even though this may be the result of a false memory. These effects can be a result of post-event information. It is very important to provide witnesses with helpful response options on memory tests and to be warned of misleading influences that might affect how the memory of the event is recalled at a later time. Many employees, police force workers, and others are trained in post-warning in order to reduce influences on the misinformation effect, which can be predicted before crime. In their studies, many researchers use eyewitnesses to study retrieval-blocking effects, which interfere with a witness' ability to recall information. Misleading information prior to the event can also influence misinformation effects. Other studies also address how the misinformation effect seems to amplify over increasing recall. Discussing events and being questioned multiple times may cause various versions of the testimonies. However, the earliest records prove to be the most accurate due to a minimized misinformation effect.  Unconscious transference  Many mistaken identifications are the result of unconscious transference, or the inability to distinguish between the perpetrator and another person who was encountered in a different context. In many of these cases, the culprit is confused with a different person who was present at the crime scene. Implicit processing takes place during the event, in which the witness encodes the general features of innocent bystanders, creating a sense of familiarity. At retrieval, this familiarity could cause people who were merely present in the crime scene to be confused with the culprit. After viewing a video of a crime involving a thief and two innocent bystanders, participants were asked to identify the perpetrator from a lineup including the three persons present in the video and three other people never before encountered. Most participants falsely identified an innocent person from the lineup. Furthermore, participants were more likely to misidentify one of the two innocent confederates in the video than one of the three unfamiliar people. Unconscious transference occurs in this instance when the witness misattributes his or her sense of familiarity of the perpetrator to a bystander. This confusing effect of familiarity is found in the mug shot procedure as well. The presentation of mug shot arrays alone does not seem to influence identification accuracy. However, this presentation can be influential if the police lineups include individuals who were earlier featured in the mug shot array. Individuals appearing in police lineups that also appeared in previous photo arrays may be identified as quickly as identifying the actual target. Therefore, in cases where a suspect is identified from mug shots following a line-up, it is uncertain whether the line-up identification is a result of the recognition of the perpetrator or of the detection of a person seen previously in mug shots.  Retrieval  = Lineups = A police lineup is a method for an eyewitness to identify a perpetrator by viewing a series of photos, or a live group of suspects. One possible outcome of a lineup is that the eyewitness can correctly identify the criminal. Another outcome is that the eyewitness can correctly state that the criminal is not in the lineup. A third option is that the eyewitness can fail to recognize that the culprit is present. Lastly, the eyewitness can incorrectly select another suspect. The ideal result is to correctly identify the offender, and the worst outcome is to mistakenly identify an innocent. Police role in lineup There are specific guidelines for police to follow when administering a lineup, to reduce bias in the lineup and increase the accuracy of eyewitness judgements. Police must reduce the pressure that eyewitnesses feel to select a criminal from an array of photos or persons. They should make sure that the eyewitness is aware that the perpetrator might not be in the lineup. Also, police should conduct a double blind procedure that does not allow them to see the lineup. This prevents police from giving the eyewitness any information, intentional or not, about who in the lineup is a police suspect. It also prevents the police from giving any feedback to the eyewitness. Feedback can produce a false confidence in the witness' selection. When overseeing a lineup, the police can use speed of recognition to determine the validity of the identification. If the witness quickly identifies the perpetrator, then the selection is more likely to be correct. Style of lineup A sequential lineup presents a witness with a series of photos one at a time, requiring the participant to identify if each photo matches his/her memory before moving forward. The witness does not know how many photos are in the group. In a simultaneous lineup, the photos or suspects are viewed together. Sequential lineups produce fewer identifications, since they are more challenging, and require absolute judgement. This means that the decision regarding the matching of the memory to the photo is independently made. On the other hand, a simultaneous lineup requires relative judgement, as the decision is not independent of the other possibilities. An absolute judgment is a judgment that requires the person to be 100 percent certain in their choice where a relative judgment is when someone makes up their mind based on what looks the closest. However, researchers such as Dr. Gary Wells from Iowa State University claim \\"during simultaneous lineups, witnesses use relative judgment, meaning that they compare lineup photographs or members to each other, rather than to their memory of the offender.\\"Wells, G.L., and E. Seelau, \\"Eyewitness Identification: Psychological Research and Legal Policy on Lineups,\\" Psychology, Public Policy and Law 1 (1995): 765‚Äì791. Sequential lineups have been preferred historically, seeing as they do not rely on relative judgment. However, recent data suggests the preference for sequential lineups over simultaneous lineups may not be empirically supported. Individuals who participate in sequential lineups are less likely to make a selection at all, regardless if the selection is accurate or not. This suggests the sequential lineup fosters a more conservative shift in criterion to make a selection rather than an increased ability to pick the true perpetrator. Consequently, further research is needed before offering recommendations to police departments.Kornell, N. (2014). Should Police Lineups Be Sequential or Simultaneous? Psychology Today. Retrieved from . Size of lineup Lineup members should have diverse characteristics so that lineups are not biased toward or against the suspect. If the appearance of a person stands out amongst the otherwise indistinctive crowd, then an eyewitness is more likely to select that person regardless of their own recollection of the criminal. According to Schuster (2007), the suspect, if he is in the in person lineup or in a picture lineup, should not stand out from the others in the lineup. People's eyes are drawn to what is different. If you make sure that all the men or women in the pictures have a similar appearance, have the same background in their picture, race, age, and are wearing the same or similar clothing, just to name a few, then the risk of getting a false positive will decrease. Thus, this lineup is suggestive. Fillers should be added to the lineup in order to depict a broad spectrum of characteristics, but must match any known description of the offender. If lineup members do not all match the known description of the offender then the lineup is biased toward the suspect. Biased lineups have been shown to increase misidentifications, particularly in target-absent lineups.5Malpass, R.S. & Devine, P.G. (1981). Eyewitness identification: Lineup instructions and the absence of the offender\\" Journal of Applied Psychology 66 (4), 482‚Äì489. Increasing the nominal size of a lineup (the actual number of suspects that are compiled) often decreases the potential for a wrong selection. Functional size also plays a role in lineup bias. Functional size is the reciprocal of the fraction of mock witnesses that choose the suspect from a lineup. For example, in a lineup of nominal size 5, if 15 out of 30 mock witnesses (randomly chosen individuals that did not experience the offence) choose the suspect, the functional size of the lineup is the reciprocal of 15/30, which is 30/15, or 2. So although the lineup has 5 members, functionally it only has 2. Effective size is the number of probable suspects. Police use these three numbers to evaluate a lineup. Viewpoints Many studies, as well as police procedures, are dependent on photo lineups or police lineups where the eyewitness views the suspects from a distance. This procedure is done in an attempt to eliminate suspects and identify the perpetrator. These types of lineups allow only small degrees of visual information for the eyewitness, such as limited viewing angles, which restrict the level of detail compared to a computerized virtual lineup where witnesses can see the targets from multiple angles and distances. One might anticipate that examination of the suspects from unlimited viewpoints would allow for better recognition cues, than when compared to limited views. However, unlimited visual information may be disadvantageous and counterproductive if the information offered at the time of retrieval was not actually present at the time of memory encoding. For example, if an eyewitness only saw the face of the perpetrator from one angle, seeing the lineup participants from other viewpoints might be distracting. Other studies have demonstrated that unlimited viewpoints do improve accuracy in police lineups. The eyewitness accuracy improves when the distance between the suspect and witness matches the distance during the initial witnessing of the crime. Retroactive interference Another phenomenon that may interfere with an eyewitness' memory is retroactive interference. This occurs when new information is processed that obstructs the retrieval of old information. A common source of interference that may occur after the event of a crime is the reporting of the crime. Police investigations include questioning that is often suggestive. The processing of new information may disrupt or entirely replace old information. If a police officer has reason to believe that a suspect is guilty the interrogator's bias can influence the eyewitness' memory. The interrogators can also put pressure on witnesses causing them to want to select a perpetrator from a police lineup. Eyewitnesses are often unsuspecting of the interrogator bias and believe their memories to be uncontaminated. Co-witness contamination The presence of a co-witness can often contaminate memories. When witnesses confer about an event they can end up agreeing on an incorrect narrative. Research has found that 71% of witnesses changed their eyewitness accounts to include false components that their co-witnesses remembered. This makes it very difficult to reconstruct the actual account of an event. To prevent this effect, police should separate witnesses as early as possible before the reporting of the event. Unfortunately this is difficult, especially if the police do not get involved immediately after the event. Police should inform witnesses of the possibility of contamination as soon as possible. Witnesses should be interviewed as soon as possible with police noting if the witnesses have compared accounts. Once the accounts have been recorded, police should make notes of similarities or differences that could point to contaminated details or facts. Confidence A witness identifying a suspect can make a decision with little or great confidence. Level of confidence varies between different witnesses and situations. There are two types of confidence: confidence in a witness' own ability to make an identification (prior to viewing a police lineup) and confidence in having made an accurate identification or accurate rejection. It must be considered that memories are normally vulnerable to multiple influences and prone to distortions and deceptions: ‚Äúthey are never constant and never result in fully accurate representations [and] these changes occur without us being aware of them.‚Äù As a consequence, the witness' confidence in his/her ability to make a correct identification should not be used to assess the accuracy of identification. Witnesses should be asked to attempt identifications even if their confidence is low. Confidence ratings after identification of a suspect is a better ( but not perfect) predictor. In many experiments, witnesses are asked to rate their confidence in their decision after making an identification from a lineup. A number of psychologists have investigated factors that might affect the confidence accuracy relationship. In a recent review of 15 experiments, suspect identifications made with high confidence were, on average, 97 percent accurate. On the other hand, witnesses who report low confidence are highly suggestive of inaccurate identification. University of Virginia law professor Brandon Garrett analyzed trial materials for 161 DNA exonerated individuals and found that in 57 percent of those cases, it was possible to determine that, in the initial (uncontaminated) memory test, the eyewitnesses were, at best, uncertain. The optimality hypothesis states that factors influencing the optimality of information processing also influence the reliability of the confidence estimate. During situations in which information processing conditions are less than optimal (e.g. the perpetrator is disguised or duration of exposure is brief) witnesses' performance during identification decreases and they are less confident in their decision. The confidence accuracy correlation is thus estimated to be stronger in situations of optimal information processing such as longer exposure time, and weaker under conditions that are not optimal. Certain factors affect identification accuracy without influencing confidence whereas other factors influence confidence without having an effect on identification accuracy. Reconstructive processes in memory (i.e. the influence of post-event information on stored memories) can influence identification accuracy while not necessarily affecting confidence. Social influence processes (i.e. committing to a decision) might have an effect on confidence judgements while having little to no effect on the accuracy of the identification. = Interviews = The method of conducting an interview has great implication on the accuracy of the testimony. When the person being interviewed is forced to provide more information, he/she is more likely to engage in confabulation. For example, when participants were shown a video and instructed to answer all questions (answerable and unanswerable) about its content, they often fabricated information. When prodded too much to remember something, people often fall upon false memories. This effect is also seen in hypnosis: when people intensely try and are guided to remember something, they may end up mistaking a vivid imagination as a memory.Using hypnosis in eyewitness memory: Past and current issues. Mazzoni, Giuliana; Lynn, Steven Jay Toglia, Michael P. (Ed); Read, J. Don (Ed); Ross, David F. (Ed); Lindsay, R. C. L. (Ed), (2007). The handbook of eyewitness psychology, Vol I: Memory for events, pp. 321‚Äì338. Mahwah, NJ, US: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers, xii, 703 pp. Cognitive interview technique Researchers have developed a strategy, entitled the cognitive interview technique, to elicit the most accurate eyewitness memory. In this preferred protocol for conducting interviews, the interrogator should make the witness feel comfortable, ask open-ended questions, and grant the witness freedom in describing the event. In addition, the interviewer should encourage the witness to exhaust his/her memory by reinstating the context of the event, recalling the events in different orders, and viewing the event scene from different perspectives. Suggestibility Distortions in a witness's memory can be induced by suggestive questioning procedures. Asking eyewitnesses to repeatedly retrieve information in multiple interviews may enhance memory because the event is being rehearsed many times or, as in many cases, increase suggestibility. Misleading information offered by the investigators may attract more attention than the originally encoded information, so the witness' memory of the event is altered to include erroneous details suggested during the interview. In addition, repeating questions could make the witness feel pressured to change his or her answer or elaborate on an already-given response with fabricated details. Open-ended questioning can reduce the level of retrieval-enhanced suggestibility because the witness is not subjected to testing manipulation by the interviewer. Contextual reinstatement Contextual reinstatement is a common technique used to help eyewitnesses remember details about a specific environment‚Äîreviewing the initial environment in which the original information was encoded. Taking a witness back to the scene where the event occurred, for example, will help facilitate the accuracy in identifying perpetrators. Reinstatement is thought to improve recall as it provides memory retrieval cues. Research has demonstrated that pairing faces of suspects or words with contextual cues at the scene of the crime will enhance performance on recognition tasks. Therefore, it seems practical that these results can be applied to eyewitness identification. Methods commonly used to examine context reinstatement include photographs of the environment/scene, mental contextual reinstatement cues, and guided recollection. Studies show that re-exposing participants to the crime scene does enhance performance in facial recognition. There were also notable effects for context reinstatement where improvement on correct identifications while increasing false alarms. Reports also show that the magnitude of improvement via context reinstatement increased in lifelike situations compared to laboratory studies. Experimental context An alteration of context was found to be one of the most important predictors of recognition accuracy. Such changes in experimental context have been shown to have effects similar to transformations in appearance, such as disguises. Criminal identifications can be influenced by a change in context. Investigators must account for the fact that encountering an acquaintance that we usually see in one context, such as work place, alters memory generalizability when compared to encountering the same acquaintance in another environment that acts like an unassociated context, such as a grocery store. The changes in environment make it difficult to identify this acquaintance. Initially, the individual might seem familiar but because this person is not in the normal context, it might be difficult to place the face and recall the name. Researchers have begun to implement procedures for reinstating the context surrounding a specific event in an attempt to improve identification accuracy. Reinstating the crime scene is often not possible. Sometimes, however it is possible to have eyewitnesses imagine and thus mentally reinstate the surroundings with imagery instructions and other mnemonic devices. In some instances, objects from the crime scene such as guns or clothing can be used additionally to help reinstate the context. Such methods have successfully shown to improve reliability and accuracy of eyewitness recall.  Verbal overshadowing effect  The process of describing a face entails thinking about its features independently, but people process faces configurally (as a whole, encoding the features in relation to one another). So, the process of describing the face often impairs the memory of it‚Äîthis is the verbal overshadowing effect. A verbal overshadowing effect typically refers to the negative effect on memory recall as a result of giving a verbal description of a visual object. For example, a witness who gives a verbal description of a face is likely to have subsequent impaired recognition for that face. However, Perfect et al. (2002) predicted that the verbal overshadowing effect would also be seen in voice recognition; that is that verbally describing a voice should also impair subsequent recognition of that voice. They predicted this because they argued that voices were difficult to articulate and so it is likely they would be vulnerable to the verbal overshadowing effect. This was found to be the case. Moreover, a dissociation between accuracy and confidence was observed. Participants' confidence that they had identified the correct voice in the audio-lineup was not influenced by the verbal overshadowing effect; in other words, verbal overshadowing had the effect of decreasing earwitnesses' recognition ability but without their knowledge.  Child testimony  Most of the research on eyewitness memory has involved adults, despite the fact that it is not uncommon for children to have been involved in a crime or to have been the central witness of a crime. Statistics from the Crown Prosecution Service revealed that 1,116 children under the age of 10 were witnesses to a crime in England and Wales in 2008/9. Children's testimony refers to when children are required to testify in court after witnessing or being involved in a crime. In situations where a child is the main witness of a crime, the result of the hearing is dependent on the child's memory of the event. And there are several important issues associated with eyewitness memory of children. For example, the accuracy of the child's explanation, in such situations, coupled with how well the child can identify the setting of the crime and the individuals involved in the crime, influence the credibility of the child's testimony. Whilst research shows that it is possible for children to provide relevant and accurate forensic information, they appear less reliable than adult witnesses and like all witnesses, can create false memories. Moreover, children often have a limited vocabulary, a desire to please the officer, or difficulty answering questions because of trauma. Using early childhood memories in eyewitness testimony can also be challenging because for the first 1‚Äì2 years of life, brain structures such as the limbic system, which holds the hippocampus and the amygdala and is involved in memory storage, are not yet fully developed. Research has demonstrated that children can remember events from before the age of 3‚Äì4 years, but that these memories decline as children get older (see childhood amnesia). Children can be involved in testimony not only when they are witnesses, but also when they are victims. There have been several cases of children recovering false memories of childhood abuse. Children as especially suggestiblePipe, M. E., Thierry, K. L., & Lamb, M. E. (2007). The development of event memory: Implications for child witness testimony. Handbook of Eyewitness Psychology. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum, 453‚Äì478. and in cases of recovered memories, is hard to determine whether the recovered memory is accurate or imagined. Due to the sensitivity of these cases, strategic interviewing is implemented for children, which may result in the validity of the memory to suffer. Strategic interviewing must be assessed with sensitivity on an individual bases and without leading questions, as they may influence the child's answer. Additional influences may include individuals surrounding the child prior to, and during the hearing. If children hear new information from such individuals, studies show that children will more than likely agree with what the others said‚Äîregardless of the child's initial opinion. Studies on children show that the average child is at greater risk for memory loss, due to the brain's immaturity and plasticity, when compared to an average adult. Poorer memory performance in young kids was shown when youth of different ages were asked to recall a doctor's visit. Children aged 3‚Äì5 answered with much less accuracy than individuals aged 6‚Äì15, indicating developmental differences in memory capacity. Furthermore, it has been shown that information encoded and stored in memory is dependent on the extent of knowledge regarding the event. That is, if a child is exposed to an event that he or she knows little about, their memory of the event will not be as accurate when compared to a child who is more knowledgeable on event-related topics. These results of increased sensitivity, suggestibility and memory loss in children lead one to question the competency of a child to serve as an eyewitness. Researchers have determined that a child should be considered a competent witness if he or she has the capacity to observe, communicate, produce sufficient memories, differentiate truth from lies, and understand the obligation to tell the truth. However, the same caution that is taken with all eyewitnesses should be taken with child testimony, as all eyewitness testimonies are prone to inaccuracies.  Intellectual ability and testimony  Individuals with intellectual disabilities are at a higher risk for sexual abuse and exploitation because they are often dependent on others and uneducated or physically incompetent in ways of self-protection. Therefore, much research has been devoted to investigating the accountability of these individuals in eyewitness testimonies. When a group of adults chosen by the Developmental Disabilities Association was compared to a control group of college students, they performed equally well when a target was absent from a lineup. However, the control group were better at recognizing when a target was present in a lineup, leading to the determination that people with intellectual disabilities are more suggestible and likely to confabulate. Children with intellectual disabilities show similar patterns in their eyewitness accounts. After watching a video of a crime, children with these disabilities performed worse than non-disabled kids of the same age on free recall, open-ended questions, and both general and specific misleading questions. These children performed better than the age-matched control group only on leading questions with yes or no answers, suggesting that they are more likely to acquiesce in the interview. These findings indicate that individuals with intellectual disabilities could be considered competent witnesses if interrogated in a non- leading manner.  Eidetic memory  Individuals who are said to possess eidetic memories are thought to hold to an image in mind for longer and with more accuracy than the average individual. But evidence for eidetic memory is limited, and there is no evidence for photographic memory or a memory being an exact replica of an event. The memories of those who claim to have superior eidetic memories are just as flawed as the memories of individuals who have normal mnemonic abilities; people who claim to have photographic memories are not immune to flawed eyewitness testimony. Witnesses who believe that they are able to retrieve an accurate mental photograph will also be much more confident in their account of the event and may influence the trial outcome. Accuracy recall of such visual scenes is a controversial issue. In the past, eidetikers were believed to have extremely accurate recall for visual displays, but modern research findings might reveal a different story. Some research demonstrates that eidetic children have greater recall accuracy for visual details compared to non-eidetic children. Other researchers have failed to find any advantage between the two groups. It is also hypothesized that eidetic imagery is not exactly related to memory and improves recall for visual details. As such, photographic memory is not useful in the courtroom. The frequency of eidetic imagery is low in adults and shows greatest frequency in early child development. In fact, it is almost non-existent past the age of 7. When procedures are used to classify eidetic memory separate from the characteristic of afterimage and memory image, a small number of children are classified as true eidetikers. These children are still suggestible; their eyewitness testimonies may still have error. Earwitness memory Research investigating earwitness memory has only recently emerged from the shadow of the extensively investigated phenomena of eyewitness memory and eyewitness testimony, despite having been in use within the English justice system since the 1660s. Earwitness memory refers to a person's auditory memory for a crime or incriminatory information they have heard. Much of the research which has been conducted on earwitness memory focuses on speaker recognition, otherwise known as voice recognition, whilst there is less research which investigates memory for environmental sounds. The majority of the literature on voice and face recognition finds a robust face advantage; compared to voice recognition, face recognition appears to be the stronger pathway, with most individuals finding it much more difficult to recall a voice compared to recalling a face. = Eyewitness vs. earwitness accuracy = A substantial proportion of the literature into witness testimony finds a robust recall advantage for visual stimuli compared to auditory stimuli. We seem to have a profound memory advantage for visual objects and scenes whilst being poorer at remembering auditory information. This therefore has clear implications for eyewitness and earwitness memory; what is seen should be more likely to be remembered than what is heard by a witness. This finding can be extended to faces and voices; within the person recognition literature, it has been found that individuals are far better at identifying a person by their face as opposed to their voice. = Non-verbal memory: environmental sound = Researchers define environmental sounds as those that are either animate, inanimate, artificial or natural; sounds produced by real events as opposed to machine-generated sounds; sounds that are more complex than laboratory-produced sounds and those that are dynamic and convey a sense of activity. Examples include the ring of a doorbell, coughing, rain, a car engine, a railroad crossing signal, and so on. Such environmental sounds are important sources of information and provide us with knowledge of our surroundings. Research has found that recall for environmental sounds can be dependent upon the storage and retrieval of verbalizable interpretations. In one study, individuals heard a selection of ambiguous environmental sounds and attempted to label each sound as they were presented. A week later, individuals labelled the sounds again and it was found that re-labelling the sounds subsequently caused individuals to perform much better in the recognition test. Recognition of environmental sounds therefore appears dependent upon labeling both at input and in the test phase, either when labels are created by subjects as they hear the sounds, or when labels are generated by the experimenter and presented to subjects. More recent research has found that it is possible to memorize the loudness of an environmental sound. However, a lot of research investigating environmental sound and memory recall is conducted in a laboratory setting and so has limited ecological validity and generalizability. = Verbal memory: voice recognition = Compared to memory recall for faces, voice recall appears to be significantly more vulnerable to interference. These consistent findings suggest that earwitness memory is far more vulnerable to the effects of interference compared to eyewitness memory; although the weight placed on eyewitness memory in court should also be carefully considered as there is much evidence to suggest its fallibility. For example, some studies have found that eyewitness identification can be impaired by effects such as the weapon focus effect or verbal overshadowing. Nevertheless, voice recognition appears to be the pathway most significantly impaired by interfering factors. Face overshadowing effect A face overshadowing effect is often found to occur, whereby individuals' voice recognition performance is impaired with the co- presentation of a face. Visual information therefore appears to have the ability to significantly interfere with the recall of auditory information. However, research has investigated whether earwitness memory is impaired to the same extent when the face of the one speaking is concealed in some way. Research shows that when a face is covered, with a balaclava for instance, accuracy for voice identification slightly improves; however a face overshadowing effect still exists despite the earwitness being able to see fewer facial features.  Pitch of voice  Voice pitch has also been identified as a factor that can affect voice recognition performance. Individuals are likely to exaggerate their memory for pitch; upon hearing a high pitched voice in an initial presentation (such as the perpetrator's voice in a crime), individuals are likely to choose an even higher-pitched voice in the test phase (audio line-up). Similarly, upon hearing a low-pitched voice, they are likely to remember the voice as being even lower in pitch when voices are presented in an audio line-up. Comparable cognitive functions seem to operate when individuals attempt to remember faces; ambiguity surrounding the ethnicity or gender of faces is likely to result in the individual's recall of faces to be exaggerated with regards to ethnic and gender-related features. Researchers call this the accentuation effect. It is suggested that voice pitch, alongside other 'surface properties' of speech such as speech content, are instantaneously encoded into memory. This contrasts with auditory features such as amplitude and speaking rate, of which there is contrary evidence about whether they are automatically encoded into memory.  Other-accent effect  There is evidence to suggest that witnesses may find it harder to identify a perpetrator's voice if the perpetrator speaks the witness's native language with an accent compared to without one. It is thought that more cognitive effort is required to process a non-native speaker's voice. This is because a 'cost' is placed on the listener, with accented voices violating the 'speech schema' the listener is familiar with in their own geographic region. Therefore, listeners may be required to expend more effort in order to recognize and distinguish the non-native speaker's phonetic segments and words. An accent also has the potential to interfere with the witness's ability to recognize the perpetrator's appearance. It has been found that when witnesses are asked to recall a perpetrator, the perpetrator's physical appearance is remembered less well when they have an accent compared to when they do not. This appears the case with different accents, speech content and how long a listener is exposed to the speaker. One proposed explanation for why accents can negatively affect the recall of visual information and eyewitness memory draws from Wickens' (2002; 2008) multiple resource theory. Wickens' theory suggests that attentional resources are separated into distinct 'pools'. Only visual and auditory tasks have access to visual and auditory attentional resources, respectively. However, when a task arises which requires the use of attentional resources from both modalities, this leads to competition for resources, in turn leading the inability to accomplish one or both tasks or resulting in poorer performance. Therefore, fewer general resources may have been available in order to encode and remember the perpetrator's appearance after witnesses had used attentional resources for the processing of the accented voice and speech content.  Direct hearing vs. devices  Whilst many earwitness accounts are attained directly and 'in-the-moment', many will be acquired over a telephone or over other communication devices. Whether the earwitness hears a conversation or other auditory information in person or hears it over a communication device could impact their rate of accuracy. However, contrary to this prediction, research has found no significant differences between the accuracy of voice identification when the voice was heard directly or over a mobile phone, despite the sound quality seeming poorer in the latter.  Emotion  Researchers have also investigated to what extent the distinctiveness of a voice, such as heightened emotion, can aid or impair an individual's recollection of it. There is evidence that faces are better remembered if they display emotion compared to when they appear neutral; in one study healthy control participants remembered more accurately happy faces than they did neutral faces. Likewise, a host of studies have found that memories that are more emotional in nature are more complex and are less likely to be forgotten compared to memories that are more neutral. It therefore seems logical for researchers to explore whether auditory material which is emotional in nature is also remembered better. Research has produced conflicting results. Bradley and Lang (2000) found that there was a memory advantage for auditory material when it was more emotional compared to when it was more neutral. The authors also found that participants' physiological activity when they listened to emotionally arousing sounds was very similar to the physiological arousal produced when they were shown emotional images. However, studies investigating emotion in voices have found no significant differences between recall rates for emotional voices and neutral voices, with some research even demonstrating that emotion can impair memory recall for the voice. For instance, it was found that angry voices were recalled to a lesser extent compared to if they were neutral in tone. This finding has been supported by other studies which have also found that rather than enhancing voice identification, emotion may significantly interfere with it. However, ethical guidelines will confine the levels of emotionality that are appropriate to be induced in participants in a laboratory study environment.  Time-delay  The amount of time between when an individual hears incriminatory information or the voice of their perpetrator, for instance, and the time they are required to recall the auditory information as an earwitness can affect their recall accuracy rate. Memory for auditory information including voice recognition appears to decline over time; studies have found that participants can recall more correct auditory information immediately after the initial presentation than after a four-day time interval, supporting several other studies finding similar results. Furthermore, the extent to which the time-interval affects memory recall for auditory information depends upon whether the witness just heard the auditory information of whether it was accompanied by visual information too, such as the face of the perpetrator. One study has found that recall is enhanced when both auditory information is heard and visual information is seen, as opposed to just hearing auditory information. Still, when individuals are asked to remember the voice and the speech content, they are only likely to have remembered the gist of what has been said as opposed to remembering verbatim. This clearly has implications for the amount of weight that is placed upon earwitness testimony in court. Earwitnesses are not typically required to give statements or recall a voice or auditory information immediately after an event has occurred, but instead are required to recall information after a time-delay. This could significantly impair the accuracy of their recall. The testimonies of those who have only heard the voice of a suspect compared to a witness who has both seen the face and heard the voice of a suspect should also be treated with extreme caution in court. = Children's earwitness memory = It is of critical importance that research into children's earwitness memory is also conducted in order to secure justice for child victims and witnesses. Compared to adult earwitness memory, the area of child earwitness memory has been largely neglected. In one of few studies comparing adult and child earwitnesses, √ñhman, Eriksson & Granhag (2011) found that only children in the older age-group of 11‚Äì13 years performed at above chance levels for voice recognition, compared to the younger-age group of children (aged 7‚Äì9) and adults. They suggest that under the age of 10 a child may be overwhelmed by the cognitive demands of the task and so do not perform above chance levels on the task. Meanwhile, adults made the highest percentage (55%) of false identifications. They also found that voice pitch level and speaker rate was highly correlated with children's but not adults' false identification rates. Overall however, the results confirmed other studies which have also shown that in general, earwitness performance for unfamiliar voices is poor. Other research found that children aged 11 to 13 years old who were tested very shortly after exposure to a voice made more correct identifications compared with children who were tested after a time interval of two weeks. This was found not to be the case for adult witnesses. = Auditory memory in blind individuals = It has been suggested that blind individuals have an enhanced ability to hear and recall auditory information in order to compensate for a lack of vision. However, whilst blind adults' neural systems demonstrate heightened excitability and activity compared to sighted adults, it is still not exactly clear to what extent this compensatory hypothesis is accurate. Nevertheless, many studies have found that there appears to be a high activation of certain visual brain areas in blind individuals when they perform non-visual tasks. This suggests that in blind individuals' brains, a reorganization of what are normally visual areas has occurred in order for them to process non-visual input. This supports a compensatory hypothesis in the blind. = Enhancement = Research has investigated how to improve the accuracy of earwitness performance. One study investigated whether an interview called a Cognitive Interview would improve adult or child (11‚Äì13 years) voice recognition performance or speech content recall if it was administered immediately after the event. It was predicted that a cognitive interview would improve the likelihood of witnesses making a correct identification and improve recall of speech content, whether immediately after the event of after a time-delay and regardless of age. It was also predicted that adults would recall more content than children, because other studies have indicated that children provide less detail than adults during free recall. However, results revealed poor correct identification rates, regardless of the type of interview earwitnesses had received (19.8%), as well as high false identification rates; 38.7% of participants incorrectly identified an innocent suspect. It did not seem to matter if an interview had been conducted shortly after the event or not. Moreover, there did not seem to be any difference between children and adults in terms of the number of suspects they correctly identified by their voice. Many researchers would suggest that this furthers the case for children (aged 11‚Äì13) to be thought of as equally capable of proving potentially helpful earwitness accounts within court settings.  Example  In 1984, Jennifer Thompson-Cannino selected Ronald Cotton from both a photographic line-up and later a physical line-up as her rapist, leading to his conviction of rape and burglary and a sentence of life in prison plus fifty-four years. Ronald Cotton spent eleven years in prison due to faulty eyewitness memory before DNA evidence exonerated him in 1995. Despite Jennifer's strong intent to study her rapist's features during the traumatic event for the purpose of identifying him afterward, she fell victim to encoding limitations at the time of the assault. Jennifer undoubtedly experienced a great degree of stress on the night of her assault with a knife pressed to her neck and a feeling of absolute powerlessness. ‚ÄúThere in my memory, at the knife-edge of fear, time distorted‚Äù.Thompson-Cannino, Jennifer, Ronald Cotton, and Erin Torneo. Picking Cotton: Our Memoir of Injustice and Redemption. New York: St. Martin's, 2009. Print. pp 13. She also fell prey to factors after the incident that affected the accuracy of her recall. Even if memories are correctly encoded at the time of the event, interference and decay can alter these memories in negative ways. The simple passage of time entails memory loss, and any new information presented between the time of the crime and testimony can interfere with a witness's recall. When Jennifer was asked to identify her perpetrator from a series of photographs, she was told by officers that she should not feel compelled to make an identification. However, Jennifer's faith in the legal system led her to believe that the police must have had a suspect to warrant her participation in photographic identification. And when Jennifer selected the photo of Ronald, the police told her she did great. The photograph of Jennifer's true rapist, Bobby Poole, was not included in the lineup. The positive feedback Jennifer received allowed her to begin incorporating details from the photograph into her memory of the attack. The fact that Jennifer took five minutes to study the pictures before she selected Ronald Cotton's photo also allowed Jennifer ample opportunity to encode Ronald's face as her assailant and thereby interfere with her original memory. The photographs were presented simultaneously, allowing Jennifer to compare the photographs to each other as opposed to her memory of the event. As a result, when she was later asked to choose her assailant from a physical line-up, Jennifer saw Ronald in her memory and thus chose him. The police further solidified her choice by telling her ‚ÄúWe thought that might be the guy‚Ä¶it‚Äôs the same person you picked from the photos.‚Äù.Thompson-Cannino, Jennifer, Ronald Cotton, and Erin Torneo. Picking Cotton: Our Memoir of Injustice and Redemption. New York: St. Martin's, 2009. Print. pp 37. As a result, the authorities viewed Jennifer as the ideal eyewitness, one who was motivated to remember the face of her assailant during the event and subsequently confident in her identification of the target. Unfortunately, the level of confidence in an eyewitness' recall is not associated with accuracy of identification. The eyewitness' confidence in his or her recall is, however, strongly associated with the jury's belief in the accuracy of the eyewitness' testimony, thus increasing the risk of assigning guilty verdicts to innocent individuals. In conclusion, unconscious transference essentially contaminated Jennifer's memory. Even after Jennifer learned of Ronald's innocence, she still saw his face in her memory of the attack years later. It wasn't until she met with Ronald face-to-face and he gave her his forgiveness did she begin to see Ronald for himself rather than as her assailant, thus beginning a remarkable and unexpected friendship.

For example, in a study published in 1994, subjects were initially shown one of two different series of slides that depicted a college student at the university bookstore, with different objects of the same type changed in some slides. One version of the slides would, for example, show a screwdriver while the other would show a wrench, and the audio narrative accompanying the slides would only refer to the object as a \\"tool\\". In the second phase, subjects would read a narrative description of the events in the slides, except this time a specific tool was named, which would be the incorrect tool half the time. Finally, in the third phase, subjects had to list five examples of specific types of objects, such as tools, but were told to only list examples which they had not seen in the slides. Subjects who had read an incorrect narrative were far less likely to list the written object (which they hadn't actually seen) than the control subjects (28% vs. 43%), and were far more likely to incorrectly list the item which they had actually seen (33% vs. 26%). The misinformation effect is a prime example of retroactive interference which occurs when information presented later interferes with the ability to retain previously encoded information. Essentially, the new information that a person receives works backward in time to distort memory of the original event. The misinformation effect has been studied since the mid-1970s. Elizabeth Loftus is one of the most influential researchers in the field. It reflects two of the cardinal sins of memory: suggestibility, the influence of others' expectations on our memory; and misattribution, information attributed to an incorrect source. Research on the misinformation effect has uncovered concerns about the permanence and reliability of memory. Visual display of retroactive memory interference Basic methods Loftus, Miller, and Burns (1978) conducted the original misinformation effect study. Participants were shown a series of slides, one of which featured a car stopping in front of a stop sign. After viewing the slides, participants read a description of what they saw. Some of the participants were given descriptions that contained misinformation, which stated that the car stopped at a yield sign. Following the slides and the reading of the description, participants were tested on what they saw. The results revealed that participants who were exposed to such misinformation were more likely to report seeing a yield sign than participants who were not misinformed. Similar methods continue to be used in misinformation effect studies. Today, standard methods involve showing subjects an event, usually in the form of a slideshow or video. The event is followed by a time delay and introduction of post-event information. Finally, participants are retested on their memory of the original event. This original study by Loftus et al. paved the way for multiple replications of the effect in order to test things like what specific processes cause the effect to occur in the first place and how individual differences influence susceptibility to the effect. Neurological causes Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) from 2010 pointed to certain brain areas which were especially active when false memories were retrieved. Participants studied photos during an fMRI. Later, they viewed sentences describing the photographs, some of which contained information conflicting with the photographs, i.e. misinformation. One day later, participants returned for a surprise item memory recognition test on the content of the photographs. Results showed that some participants created false memories, reporting the verbal misinformation conflicting with the photographs. During the original event phase, increased activity in left fusiform gyrus and right temporal/occipital cortex was found which may have reflected the attention to visual detail, associated with later accurate memory for the critical item(s) and thus resulted in resistance to the effects of later misinformation. Retrieval of true memories was associated with greater reactivation of sensory-specific cortices, for example, the occipital cortex for vision. Electroencephalography research on this issue also suggests that the retrieval of false memories is associated with reduced attention and recollection related processing relative to true memories. Susceptibility It is important to note that not everyone is equally susceptible to the misinformation effect. Individual traits and qualities can either increase or decrease one's susceptibility to recalling misinformation. Such traits and qualities include: age, working memory capacity, personality traits and imagery abilities. =Age= Several studies have focused on the influence of the misinformation effect on various age groups. Young children are more susceptible than older children and adults to the misinformation effect. Young Children are particularly susceptible to this effect as it relates to peripheral memories and information, as some evidence suggests that the misinformation effect is stronger on an ancillary, existent memory than on a new, purely fabricated memory. This effect is redoubled if its source is in the form of a narrative rather than a question. Additionally, there are different perspectives regarding the vulnerability of elderly adults to the misinformation effect. Some evidence suggests that elderly adults are more susceptible to the misinformation effect than younger adults. Contrary to this perspective, however, other studies hold that older adults may make fewer mistakes when it comes to the misinformation effect than younger ones, depending on the type of question being asked and the skillsets required in the recall. This contrasting perspective holds that the defining factor when it comes to age, at least in adults, depends largely on cognitive capacity, and the cognitive deterioration that commonly accompanies age to be the typical cause of the typically observed decline. =Working memory capacity= Individuals with greater working memory capacity are better able to establish a more coherent image of an original event. Participants performed a dual task: simultaneously remembering a word list and judging the accuracy of arithmetic statements. Participants who were more accurate on the dual task were less susceptible to the misinformation effect. This, in turn, allowed them to reject the misinformation. =Personality traits= The Myers Briggs Type Indicator is one type of test used to assess participant personalities. Individuals were presented with the same misinformation procedure as that used in the original Loftus et al. study in 1978 (see above). The results were evaluated in regards to their personality type. Introvert-intuitive participants were more likely to accept both accurate and inaccurate post- event information than extrovert-sensate participants. Therefore, it was speculated that introverts are more likely to have lower confidence in their memory and are more likely to accept misinformation. Individual personality characteristics, including empathy, absorption and self-monitoring, have also been linked to greater susceptibility. =Imagery abilities= The misinformation effect has been examined in individuals with varying imagery abilities. Participants viewed a filmed event followed by descriptive statements of the events in a traditional three-stage misinformation paradigm. Participants with higher imagery abilities were more susceptible to the misinformation effect than those with lower abilities. The psychologists argued that participants with higher imagery abilities were more likely to form vivid images of the misleading information at encoding or at retrieval, therefore increasing susceptibility. = Paired participants = Some evidence holds that participants, if paired together for discussion, tend to have a homogenizing effect on the memory of one another. In the laboratory, paired participants that discussed a topic containing misinformation tended to display some degree of memory blend, suggesting that the misinformation had diffused among them. Influential factors =Time= Individuals may not be actively rehearsing the details of a given event after encoding. The longer the delay between the presentation of the original event and post-event information, the more likely it is that individuals will incorporate misinformation into their final reports. Furthermore, more time to study the original event leads to lower susceptibility to the misinformation effect, due to increased rehearsal time. Elizabeth Loftus coined the term discrepancy detection principle for her observation that a person¬¥s recollections are more likely to change, if they do not immediately detect the discrepancies between misinformation and the original event. At times people recognize a discrepancy between their memory and what they are being told. People might recollect, \\"I thought I saw a stop sign, but the new information mentions a yield sign, I guess I must be wrong, it was a yield sign.\\" Although the individual recognizes the information as conflicting with their own memories they still adopt it as true. If these discrepancies are not immediately detected they are more likely to be incorporated into memory. =Source reliability= The more reliable the source of the post-event information, the more likely it is that participants will adopt the information into their memory. For example, Dodd and Bradshaw (1980) used slides of a car accident for their original event. They then had misinformation delivered to half of the participants by an unreliable source: a lawyer representing the driver. The remaining participants were presented with misinformation, but given no indication of the source. The misinformation was rejected by those who received information from the unreliable source and adopted by the other group of subjects. =Discussion and rehearsal= The question of whether discussion is detrimental to memories also exists when considering what factors influence the misinformation effect. One study examined the effects of discussion in groups on recognition. The experimenters used three different conditions: discussion in groups with a confederate providing misinformation, discussion in groups with no confederate, and a no-discussion condition. They found that participants in the confederate condition adopted the misinformation provided by the confederate. However, there was no difference between the no- confederate and no-discussion conditions, proving that discussion (without misinformation) is neither harmful nor beneficial to memory accuracy. In an additional study, Karns et al. (2009) found that collaborative pairs showed a smaller misinformation effect than individuals. It appeared as though collaborative recall allowed witnesses to dismiss misinformation generated by an inaccurate narrative. In a 2011 study, Paterson et al. studied \\"memory conformity\\", showing students two different videos of a burglary. It was found that if witnesses who had watched the two different videos talked with one another, they would then claim to remember details shown in the video of the other witness and not their own. They continued to claim the veracity of this memory, despite warnings of misinformation. =State of mind= Various inhibited states of mind such as drunkenness and hypnosis can increase misinformation effects. Assefi and Garry (2002) found that participants who believed they had consumed alcohol showed results of the misinformation effect on recall tasks. The same was true of participants under the influence of hypnosis. =Other= Most obviously, leading questions and narrative accounts can change episodic memories and thereby affect witness' responses to questions about the original event. Additionally, witnesses are more likely to be swayed by misinformation when they are suffering from alcohol withdrawal or sleep deprivation, when interviewers are firm as opposed to friendly, and when participants experience repeated questioning about the event. =Arousal after learning= Arousal induced after learning reduces source confusion, allowing participants to better retrieve accurate details and reject misinformation. In a study of how to reduce the misinformation effect, participants viewed four short film clips, each followed by a retention test, which for some participants included misinformation. Afterward, participants viewed another film clip that was either arousing or neutral. One week later, the arousal group recognized significantly more details and endorsed significantly fewer misinformation items than the neutral group. =Anticipation= Educating participants about the misinformation effect can enable them to resist its influence. However, if warnings are given after the presentation of misinformation, they do not aid participants in discriminating between original and post-event information. =Psychotropic placebos= Research published in 2008 showed that placebos enhanced memory performance. Participants were given a placebo \\"cognitive enhancing drug\\" called R273. When they participated in a misinformation effect experiment, people who took R273 were more resistant to the effects of misleading post-event information. As a result of taking R273, people used stricter source monitoring and attributed their behavior to the placebo and not to themselves. = Sleep = Controversial perspectives exist regarding the effects of sleep on the misinformation effect. One school of thought supports the idea that sleep can play a magnifying role in the magnitude of individual vulnerability to the misinformation effect. In a study examining this, some evidence was found that misinformation susceptibility increases after a sleeping cycle. In this study, the participants that displayed the least degree of misinformation susceptibility were the ones who had not slept since exposure to the original information, indicating that a cycle of sleep increased susceptibility. In contrast, a different school of thought holds that sleep deprivation leads to greater vulnerability to the Misinformation effect. This view holds that Sleep Deprivation increases individual suggestibility. This view then posits that this increased susceptibility would result in an related increase in the development of false memories.Darsaud, Annabelle; Dehon, Hedwige; Lahl, Olaf; Sterpenich, Virginie; Boly, M√©lanie; Dang-Vu, Thanh; Desseilles, Martin; Gais, Stephen; Matarazzo, Luca; Peters, Fr√©d√©ric; Schabus, Manuel. \\"Does Sleep Promote False Memories?\\". Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience. 23 (1): 26‚Äì40. ISSN 0898-929X.  Attempts at and Struggles with Addressing the Misinformation Effect  The misinformation effect can have dire consequences on decision making that can have harmful personal and public outcomes in a variety of circumstances. For this reason, various researchers have participated in the pursuit of a means to counter its effects, and many models have been proposed. As with Source Misattribution, attempts to unroot misinformation can have lingering unaddressed effects that do not display in short term examination. Although various perspectives have been proposed, all suffer from a similar lack of metanalytic examination. = False Confirmation = One of the problems with countering the misinformation effect, linked with the complexity of human memory, is the influence of information, whether legitimate or falsified, that appears to support the false information. The presence of these confirmatory messages can serve to validate the Misinformation as presented, making it more difficult to unroot the problem. This is particularly present in situations where the person has a desire for the information to be legitimate. = The Hazard of Directly Oppositional Messages = A common method of unrooting false concepts is presenting a contrasting, ‚Äúfactual‚Äù message. While this would intuitively be a good means of portraying the information to be inaccurate, this type of direct opposition has been linked to an increase in misinformation belief. Some researchers hypothesize that the counter message must have at least as much support, if not more, than the initial message to present a fully developed countermodel for consideration. Otherwise, the recipient may not remember what was wrong about the information and fall back on their prior belief model due to lack of support for the new model. = The Effect of Exposure to the Original Source = Some studies suggest that the misinformation effect can occur despite exposure to accurate information. This effect has been demonstrated when the participants have the ability to access an original, accurate video source at whim, and has even been demonstrated when the video is cued to the precise point in time where video evidence that refutes the misinformation is present. Written and photographic contradictory evidence have also been shown to be similarly ineffective. Ultimately, this demonstrates that exposure to the original source is still not guaranteed to overcome the misinformation effect.  Potentially Effective Resistance to the Misinformation Effect  There are a few models for addressing the misinformation effect with evidence supporting them. Each of these, however, have their own limitations that impact their effectiveness. = Increased Self Regard = Some evidence has been shown to suggest that those suffering from the misinformation effect can often tell they are reporting inaccurate information but are insufficiently confident in their own recollections to act on this impression. As such, some research suggests that increased self-confidence, such as in the form of self- affirmative messages and positive feedback, can weaken the misinformation effect. Unfortunately, due to the difficulty of introducing increased self- regard in the moment, these treatment methods are held to not be particularly realistic for use in a given moment. = Pretesting as a Means of Preventing the Misinformation Effect = Another direction of study in preventing the misinformation effect is the idea of using a pretest to prevent the misinformation effect. This theory posits that a test, applied prior to the introduction of misleading information, can help maintain the accuracy of the memories developed after that point. This model, however, has two primary limitations: its effects only seem to hold for one item at a time, and data supports the idea that it increases the impact of the information on the subsequent point of data. Pretesting also, paradoxically, has been linked with a decrease in accurate attributions from the original sample. = The Use of Questions = Another model with some support is that of the use of questions. This model holds that the use of questions rather than declaratory statements prevents the misinformation effect from developing, even when the same information is presented in both scenarios. In fact, the use of questions in presenting information after the fact was linked with increased correct recall, and further with an increase in perfect recall among participants. The advocates of this view hold that this occurs because the mind incorporates definitive statements into itself, whereas it does not integrate questions as easily. Implications Implications of this effect on long-term memories are as follows =Variability= Some reject the notion that misinformation always causes impairment of original memories. Modified tests can be used to examine the issue of long-term memory impairment. In one example of such a test,(1985) participants were shown a burglar with a hammer. Standard post-event information claimed the weapon was a screwdriver and participants were likely to choose the screwdriver rather than the hammer as correct. In the modified test condition, post-event information was not limited to one item, instead participants had the option of the hammer and another tool (a wrench, for example). In this condition, participants generally chose the hammer, showing that there was no memory impairment. =Rich false memories= Rich false memories are researchers' attempts to plant entire memories of events which never happened in participants' memories. Examples of such memories include fabricated stories about participants getting lost in the supermarket or shopping mall as children. Researchers often rely on suggestive interviews and the power of suggestion from family members, known as ‚Äúfamilial informant false narrative procedure.‚Äù Around 30% of subjects have gone on to produce either partial or complete false memories in these studies. There is a concern that real memories and experiences may be surfacing as a result of prodding and interviews. To deal with this concern, many researchers switched to implausible memory scenarios. =Daily applications= The misinformation effect can be observed in many situations. For example, after witnessing a crime or accident there may be opportunities for witnesses to interact and share information. Late-arriving bystanders or members of the media may ask witnesses to recall the event before law enforcement or legal representatives have the opportunity to interview them. Collaborative recall may lead to a more accurate account of what happened, as opposed to individual responses that may contain more untruths after the fact. In addition, while remembering small details may not seem important, they can matter tremendously in certain situations. A jury's perception of a defendant's guilt or innocence could depend on such a detail. If a witness remembers a moustache or a weapon when there was none, the wrong person may be wrongly convicted.

Shields previously served as UK Minister for Internet Safety and Security, Under-Secretary of State, and Advisor on the Digital Economy to David Cameron. She was made a Life Peer in the House of Lords in 2014. In 2016, Baroness Shields was appointed the Prime Minister's Special Representative on Internet Safety. Before joining the government, Shields spent over 25 years building some of the world's best-known technology companies, including Electronics for Imaging, RealNetworks, Google, Aol and Facebook, as well as leading several start-ups to successful acquisitions, including Bebo, Decru and Veon. Career history Shields in 2011In 1984 as a graduate business student, Shields worked part-time at the National Affairs Office of Deloitte in Washington, D.C. Shields was assigned the task of writing a business plan for a start-up called NDC (National Digital Corporation), an early pioneer in the transmission and archival of digital media that was acquired by Gruner + Jahr. During her time there she became convinced that digital technology was going to change the way we live our lives and interact with each other. While at NDC, Shields met Israeli entrepreneur and founder of Scitex, Efi Arazi, who had formed a new venture called Efi (Electronics for Imaging, Nasdaq:EFII). In 1989 she moved to Silicon Valley and joined the company, where she began working as a product manager and over the course of eight years rose through the ranks to become VP of Production Systems, a division that designed, built and manufactured ASICs, embedded controllers and servers that connected digital printing systems to networks from companies such as HP, Canon, Ricoh, Minolta, Fuji Xerox and Kodak. In 1997 Shields became CEO of Veon, an interactive video technology company whose intellectual property included patents for adding interactive links to video streams that became part of the MPEG4 streaming video standard. Philips acquired Veon in 2000. After closing the Veon transaction, Shields was hired by the company that invented streaming audio and video, RealNetworks, to run its businesses outside the United States. Shields briefly joined former Efi CEO and colleague, Dan Avida, to build the business of a storage encryption company he founded called Decru, where she played an instrumental role in forming a partnership with Network Appliance, the company that eventually acquired Decru for $272m. Shields then became a managing director for Google Europe, Middle East and Africa where she was responsible for developing the company's advertising syndication business, AdSense, and for the acquisition of content and partnerships for such products such as Google Mail, Video (before the YouTube acquisition), Maps, Local, News and Books. In late 2006 Shields was approached by Benchmark Capital to step in as CEO of the social networking startup Bebo. At Bebo, Shields introduced Open Media, opening Bebo's platform for media companies to reach its 50M user base and enabling media owners to monetise their content, and Bebo Originals, a series of original online shows. The first Bebo Original KateModern was viewed 85M times, was nominated for two BAFTA awards and won the Broadcasting Press Guild Innovation Award for Outstanding Development in Broadcasting. After engineering Bebo's acquisition for $850m by Aol in May 2008, Shields briefly relocated to New York City to head Aol's newly created People Networks, overseeing the company's social and communications assets including AIM, Aol Instant Messenger and ICQ. Bebo's development continued under Shields with the release of Timeline in 2009, the first social network to organise and represent life events in a linear way. Timeline eventually became standard on social networks when Facebook released the feature in 2012. In 2009 Shields was recruited by former Google colleague Sheryl Sandberg to run Facebook in Europe, Middle East & Africa as VP & managing director. In her role she built EMEA into the company's largest region, focusing on making Facebook the world's most valuable marketing, communications and customer services platform for brands and leveraging Facebook's Open Graph as a growth engine for some of Europe's hottest startups and established businesses. She also presided over the growth of international presence to over one billion users. In May 2018, Shields was announced as the Group CEO of BenevolentAI, a London-based medical startup.  Industry recognition  Shields was ranked No. 1 on the Wired 100 in 2011 and No. 6 in the MediaGuardian 100 in 2012. In February 2013 she was named to the list of the 100 most powerful women in the United Kingdom by BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. In July 2013 Computer Weekly named Shields the Most Influential Woman in UK IT. In July 2013 she received the British Interactive Media Association's Lifetime Achievement Award. Government work In October 2012 Shields was recruited by Prime Minister Cameron to lead HM Government's Tech City initiative and become the UK's Ambassador for Digital Industries. She was Chair and CEO of Tech City from Jan 2013 to May 2015, during which time, she worked with the London Stock Exchange to launch the new high-growth segment and created Future Fifty, a programme to identify the 50 fastest growing businesses and support them on the path to an IPO. Future Fifty was launched by the Chancellor George Osborne in April 2013. Shields is also involved in promoting the policies and conditions that foster entrepreneurship across the EU and, along with eight other leading EU entrepreneurs, launched the EU Startup Manifesto, which aims to transform the European Union into a startup-friendly region. Shields was appointed the Prime Minister's Adviser on the Digital Economy in Summer of 2014 and she served in that role until the May 2015 General Election when David Cameron appointed Baroness Shields as the Minister for Internet Safety and Security and a Parliamentary Under-Secretary for both the Home Office and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport in the newly elected majority government. In July 2016 she was reappointed to her post by Prime Minister Theresa May. In December 2016, after 18 months at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and a year as a joint Minister, Shields became a full-time Home Office Minister and the Prime Minister's Special Representative on Internet Crime and Harms, in addition to her role as Minister for Internet Safety & Security. Shields served as Minister for Internet Safety and Security until June 2017 when she stepped down from her ministerial post ahead of the general election to focus on her work with the WeProtect Global Alliance and her role as the Prime Minister's Special Representative on Internet Crime and Harms. She currently serves the government in the following positions: * Founder and Member, WeProtect Global Alliance - End Child Sexual Exploitation Online (formerly US/UK Taskforce to combat child online abuse and exploitation) * Prime Minister's Special Representative on Internet Safety * Member, Child Protection Implementation Taskforce * Member, Tackling Extremism in Communities Implementation Taskforce Shields has formerly served in the following positions: * Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Home Office and Minister for Internet Safety and Security * Interest as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport * Co-Chair, UK Council for Child Internet Safety * Member, Inter-Ministerial Group on Violence Against Women and Girls * Member, Inter- Ministerial Group on Child Sexual Abuse Profile on parliament.uk Government Focus ‚Äì To make the internet safer by tackling online child abuse, exploitation and access to harmful content.

After being nominated as a working peeress in August 2014, Shields was elevated to the peerage on 16 September 2014 taking the title Baroness Shields, of Maida Vale in the City of Westminster. Founding of WeProtect Global Alliance On 22 July 2013, the Prime Minister David Cameron made a speech regarding the proliferation and accessibility of child abuse images on the Internet and about cracking down on online pornography. The Prime Minister announced that a new UK-US taskforce would be created to lead a global alliance of the biggest Internet companies to tackle indecent images of children online. Joanna Shields would head up this initiative, working with UK and US governments and law enforcement agencies and with industry to maximise the international efforts. In April 2014 she founded WeProtect.org. WePROTECT is a global alliance led by the UK government and supported by over 70 countries, 20 technology companies and NGOs to stop the global crime of online child sexual abuse and exploitation. In April 2014, Shields founded WePROTECT, an initiative designed to engage Internet companies in the development of technology aimed to combat online child abuse and exploitation. In December 2014, David Cameron convened the first WePROTECT global summit in London. This summit and a second hosted in Abu Dhabi by the Interior Ministry of the United Arab Emirates have unified a global multi-stakeholder coalition in commitment to Statements of Action I & II. Shields opened the UAE Summit as keynote speaker in November 2015 and at the United Nations launch of the End Violence Against Children Global Partnership & WePROTECT Initiative Fund in New York, July 2016. WePROTECT Global Alliance to End Child Sexual Exploitation Online combines two major initiatives: the Global Alliance, led by the U.S. Department of Justice and the EU Commission and WePROTECT, which was convened by the UK. This new, merged initiative has unprecedented reach, with 70 countries already members of WePROTECT or the Global Alliance, along with major international organisations, 20 of the biggest names in the global technology industry, and 17 leading civil society organisations. www.weprotect.org Board service & affiliations Shields also served on several boards as trustee, including Save the Children, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children NSPCC, There4Me board, The American School in London, and as a non-executive director on the board of the London Stock Exchange Group and on Mayor Boris Johnson's London Smart Board. She also served on the EU Web Entrepreneurs Leaders' Club[38] established by then EU Commissioner and Vice-President, Neelie Kroes. Shields also served on the Advisory Board of the philanthropy platform Elbi on an unpaid basis until early 2016. In 2017, Shields became a life member of the Council on Foreign Relations. In 2018, Shields joined the Alliance of Democracies' Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity. She participated in the Commission's summit in Copenhagen in July 2018. In October 2018, Shields was awarded the World Childhood Foundation ThankYou Award. The following month, she received the International Figures Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak Award for Motherhood and Childhood.

He participated in many theater plays, several movies (e.g. Hill 24 Doesn't Answer, Operation Thunderbolt, Rocking Horse, Hole in the Moon), and published a number of solo and non-solo albums (e.g. Le Arava Trio :he:◊ß◊ï◊ë◊•:Arava Trio.JPG). He was occasionally seen on primetime Israeli television in the days it had only one channel. Lavie had a very rich voice that allowed his band members to play simple musical roles and spend very little time on rehearsals. Thus, Lavie could give many concerts in the young state of Israel, when it had a small, poor population. In addition to Israeli folk music, Lavi was one of the first Israeli singers began to sing pop songs. His romantic song The Red Rock was about Petra, the ancient Jordanian city. Popular in the 1960s (well before Israel and Jordan had a peace treaty), the song encouraged young Israelis to sneak across the guarded border into Jordan to see the site, resulting in some deaths.IMDb: Arik Lavie James A. Michener fictionalized such a pilgrimage in the novel The Drifters. Among his famous songs are: \\"Song of the Locomotive\\", \\"Echo Song,\\" \\"Autumn Song\\" (\\"All the rivers run into the sea\\"), \\"It happens\\",\\"old tune\\", \\"I'll sing you a song\\" and more. Lavie also renewed old Hebrew songs, including songs of the Palmach, in his album \\"The Moon and Sixpence\\". Lavie appeared many times before soldiers during the wars of Israel. During the somber \\"waiting period\\" before the Six-Day War, he helped lift the national spirit by performing the song \\"Nasser's waiting for Rabin\\" with lyrics by Haim Hefer. After the war, he recorded the song \\"We will not go again\\" (\\"Rachel Rai Rai\\"), expressing the great sense of victory in the war. After the Yom Kippur War, he recorded the \\"Song is not just words\\" and during the Lebanon war, he recorded the \\"Knight\\", both songs of protest against war and in support of peace. He participated in theater productions along with his wife, actress Shoshik Shani, and both played in movies. Arik Lavie is considered one of the finest performers in Hebrew. In recent years has been recognized even by singers and young artists, who renewed many of his songs. Lavie's last cinematic roll was in \\"Prophet on the run\\" directed by Tomer Ganihar. His last album was \\"Arik Lavie - My Way: Rare Recordings\\". The album contains rare recordings from the '70s, which Lavi edited before his death in 2004. Its theme song is a Hebrew version of the song \\"My Way\\" by Frank Sinatra, translated according to Lavie's personal life story. He died in 2004 from a severe heart disease. He was buried in the Yarkon cemetery. He survived by his wife Shoshik, and two daughters. The College of Music and Production BPM, provides a scholarship in his name, to commemorate its musical legacy.

It grows to a length of SL.  Taxonomy/Etymology  Acheilognathus macropterus is the name given to this species from Greek words A (without), cheilo (lip), gnathus (jaw), Macro (long), and pterus (feather/wing) due to the fish within this genus only having a lateral, lip fold on the lower jaw and a long dorsal fin on the adult males. The common name for this species is Giant Chinese Bitterling because of its Chinese origin. There are 39 other species relating to this species at the genus level.  Genome  Mitochondrial genome was found using PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. The double stranded DNA is circular consisting of 13 protein- coding genes, 22 RNA transfer genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, and two main non-coding regions. The genetic composition is similar to other vertebrates and can be useful for future species identification and evolutionary correlations.  Description  Males have longer rays in their dorsal and anal fins, and mating males have a pale pink metallic color, dark abdomen, breeding tubercules on snout, and white spots on anal-fin. Mating females are colorless with an anal-fin being yellow and an 80 mm ovipositor. This species is only aggressive when breeding, and typically does well with fishes of the same size. This species specifically can grow up to 30 cm (12 in) in their ideal environment.  Habitat  A. macropterus species thrives in freshwater and brackish water with a subtropical temperature of 15 ¬∞C-25 ¬∞C. It is not thought to be harmful to humans. Typically in slow moving sections of rivers and can adjust well to large bodies of water including man-made reservoirs.  Life Cycle  Females have an ovipositor, which is a tube-like organ used to lay eggs inside bivalves; aquatic mollusks having a hinged shell. The young remain inside the shell until able to swim and be on their own.  Diet  A. macropterus is an omnivore that preys on insects, insect larvae, algae, and other vegetations. It has a broad diet, but A. macropterus prefers bloodworms, Daphnia spp., and Artemia spp .  Impact  Both deliberate and accidental influence is seen with native fish species in Ibaraki, Japan, specifically bitterling organisms. Deliberate impact is due to the release of pet animals into the water and accidental impact is observed from hitchhiking and pearl bivalve for aquaculture.  Distribution and Invasiveness  Although native to China and Northern Vietnam, this species is also native to southeastern Russia. This species can also be found in the Korean peninsula natively. = Invasion of Japan = Some species of bitterlings are on the decline in Japan due to habitat loss and pollution of the bivalves where the young bitterlings remain before they are able to swim. The bitterling subfamily Acheilognathinae live in Japan with 17 species and subspecies, with one exotic subspecies. In Lake Kasumigaura in Japan, the species found was Acheilognathus macropterus in 2003 and in 2007 made up more than 80% of the bitterling population, therefore other native bitterlings were driven out due to the increase in Acheilognathus macropterus. The increase in this non-native species within the Ibaraki region can be explained by the utilization of the freshwater pearl mussel that could be potentially helping Acheilognathus macropterus invade.

College career He was raised in Los Angeles, California and attended Fairfax High School. Bluntt was a standout basketball player for the school, and decided to continue playing at the college level. He chose Delaware State University, an historically black college which participates in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) of the NCAA. A 6'6\\", 220-pound shooting guard and small forward, he appeared in 61 total games through his first two seasons with the Hornets and averaged approximately 11.1 points per game during that span. During his sophomore season, however, Bluntt was responsible for tipping an offensive rebound to teammate Aaron Williams with 1.6 seconds remaining in the 2005 MEAC Men's Basketball Tournament Championship. Williams hit the jump shot to propel Delaware State past Hampton, 55‚Äì53, and into the NCAA Tournament. Delaware State won both the MEAC regular season and conference championships for the only time in school history. As a junior in 2005‚Äì06, Bluntt averaged 14.6 points, 4.8 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.1 steals per game. He also shot 41.3% from the field, 39.1% from three-point field goal range and 75.6% on the free throw line. Delaware State repeated as the MEAC regular season champions but failed to gain the automatic berth into the NCAA Tournament by winning the conference tournament championship. They were still selected to play in the 2006 National Invitation Tournament, and Bluntt was named the MEAC Player of the Year. In 2006‚Äì07, Bluntt repeated as the MEAC Player of the Year behind averages of 15.5 points, 4.9 rebounds, 1.6 assists and 1.2 steals per game. He shot 42.3% from the field, 35.0% from three-point territory and 82.1% at the free throw line. Delaware State won their third consecutive regular season championship and qualified for the NIT in back-to-back seasons. Professional career After college, Bluntt was selected 10th overall by the Yakama Sun Kings of the Continental Basketball Association as well as in the second round of the 2007 NBA Development League Draft by the Iowa Energy. Prior to playing for either team he tested the waters in a French professional league. He eventually came back and played for the Energy for only four games. The Sioux Falls Skyforce signed him in January 2008 and he then finished the season with them while appearing in 29 games. In 2008‚Äì09, Bluntt played for SO Maritime Boulogne in France while averaging 18.6 points, 5.7 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game. He switched teams once again in 2009‚Äì10, this time playing for Boulazac Basket Dordogne in the Ligue Nationale de Basketball.

Unlike many converts to the manufacture of electric cars, Paris-Rh√¥ne would have no problems producing their own electric motors in house. The Car The company produced only electric cars. The first three-wheeler, the Paris-Rh√¥ne VPR, was presented to the public in the Spring of 1941. It was just 2500 mm long and 1200 mm wide, weighing approximately 450 kg of which 210 kg was accounted for by six large batteries located under and behind the seat and mounted on a cradle that also accommodated the motor which drove the two rear wheels. The front wheel was mounted on a motor-cycle style fork, but the mechanism was concealed from view by the body work. The electric motor appears to have been an existing unit from the company‚Äôs range, and delivered 2.5 hp at 2,300 rpm. A top speed of 30 km/h (19 mph) and a range of approximately 65 kilometers (40 miles) were quoted. The three-wheeled car had one bench seat suitable for two thin people and featured a simple cabriolet body. A single seater utility version with 125 kg of load capacity was also offered, using the same basic engine type (model TA 14), but in this version the engine tension was only 24 volts as against 36 volts for the two person vehicle, and performance claims for the utility version were correspondingly more modest. The design was developed by an engineer called Henri Lanoy who the next year produced an updated version called the Baby-Rh√¥ne with a closed top body and a slightly less basic arrangement for the front wheel, now incorporating an element of suspension. An updated version of this vehicle, the Baby-Rh√¥ne II, was exhibited for the first time at the Lyon Fair in 1942. The little ‚Äúcoup√©‚Äù body was produced by a coach building company called Faurax et Chassende who had their premises on the ‚ÄúSaint-Priest Road‚Äù in Lyon, a few hundred meters along the road from Paris-Rh√¥ne‚Äôs own factory. Enthusiasts A 1942 Paris-Rh√¥ne can be seen, in 2011, at the Mus√©e Automobile de Provence at Orgon in south-east France. Sources and further reading * G.N. Georgano: Autos.

She wrote under the alias Aghabaji. Early life In her younger years, Aghabeyim agha fell in love with her cousin Muhammad bey when she was young. Muhammad bey was in charge of her father the khan's army. Returning to Shusha to Ibrahim Khalil khan for the settlement of the marriage issue, Muhammad bey had to go on a trip on that day. Aghabeyim agha wrote on this occasion: After Agha Mohammad shah Qajar's homicide in Karabakh, in 1797, Ibrahim Khalil khan married his daughter Aghabeyim agha to new the shah, Agha Mohammad shah's nephew Fath-Ali Shah to ensure the normalization of political relations and sent her to Tehran. Life as a queen-consort Fath-Ali Shah's wives had a right to choose any dress from shah's rich salon when they entered into harem. Aghabeyim agha knew that the shah's mother's dress was also there. Therefore, when she was brought to the salon she directed her steps to that dress and put it on. Seeing Aghabeyim agha in his mother's dress, Fath-Ali Shah was surprised and never touched her. Due to her intellect, Aghabeyim agha was liked by shah, and he appointed her as harem's head wife and granted her gorgeous dress with pearls. Aghabeyim agha was homesick and expressed her anguish in her poems-bayati (quatrains): Aghabeyim agha died in 1832, in Tehran and was buried in Qom.

The character was promoted as one of five new main characters to join Torchwood in its fourth series, Torchwood: Miracle Day (2011), as part of a new co-production between Torchwoods British network, BBC One, and its American financiers on US premium television network Starz. Pullman appears in eight of the ten episodes, and is credited as a series regular. Whilst reaction to the serial and Pullman's character was mixed, Pullman's portrayal was praised by critics and in 2012 he received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor on Television. Danes is a former schoolteacher who molested several of the little girls he taught, and eventually killed one of them. He was sentenced to death, but on the day of his execution - the so-called Miracle Day, when death ceases worldwide - Danes survives his own lethal injection. His survival draws global attention, and he subsequently is released from prison on a legal technicality. After being offered both exposure and protection by Public Relations expert Jilly Kitzinger (Lauren Ambrose), he becomes her client, which helps him gain more publicity. Following a series of events he ends up aiding Torchwood, a team composed of two former alien-hunters and two former CIA agents, on their mission to restore death to the world. Danes is killed off in the final episode of the series; when death is restored he takes one of the Torchwood team's enemies out in a murder‚Äìsuicide. Critics commented upon the character's resemblance both to horror film killers such as Freddy Krueger and Hannibal Lecter, as well as to American Evangelists and to the biblical Jesus Christ. The series also follows Danes' rise and fall in the public eye and the precariousness of fame. Though critics questioned the wisdom of having a pedophile as a character, the show's creative team was adamant that they had deliberately made him unlikable. In killing the character off, the creative team did not wish to suggest that the character had been redeemed for his earlier crimes, and made sure that this was emphasised even in his final act of self-sacrifice. Pullman has expressed interest in reprising the role in a future Torchwood series. Appearances The first scene of Miracle Day depicts Oswald Danes surviving execution by lethal injection due to death spontaneously ceasing. His lawyers successfully advance a force majeure argument; as a result the Governor of Kentucky is reluctantly forced to release Danes on parole. Danes accepts an offer of representation from public relations guru Jilly Kitzinger (Lauren Ambrose) after his fame leads to him being assaulted in public, leading to him becoming a spokesman for Phicorp, a drug company hoping to capitalise on the absence of death. During Torchwood's investigations into PhiCorp, Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) confronts Danes, who brags about killing his student, calling it \\"the best moment of my life\\". Tensions arise between Kitzinger and Danes when he is eclipsed in the media by Tea Party politician Ellis Hartley Monroe (Mare Winningham) and her \\"Dead is Dead\\" campaign. Danes launches an ad hoc publicity stunt; a video of Danes holding and comforting a baby girl goes viral and results in Monroe's media attention waning. At the \\"Miracle Rally\\" held by PhiCorp in Los Angeles Danes gives an impassioned speech, stating his belief that humanity had evolved into \\"everlasting angels\\" and revels in the audience chanting his name. Danes' brief media career comes to an end in \\"End of the Road\\". While at a hotel in Dallas, Texas a prostitute named Claire (Megan M. Duffy) tells him that he is due to be classified as \\"Category Zero\\". Kitzinger reveals that this is a ruling that would have convicted criminals like Danes incinerated, and that his moment of fame is over. Danes smuggles himself into Wales, where he arrives at the home of Torchwood agent Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles). Having stolen Kitzinger's laptop, Danes reveals that she left clues to the location of \\"the Blessing\\" in mistranslated news stories from China and Argentina. Fearful that Rhys (Kai Owen), Gwen's husband and father of their daughter, may murder Danes, she and Harkness take him to Shanghai. In \\"The Blood Line\\" Harkness straps Danes with explosives and uses him as insurance against his and Gwen's lives as they face the Families, the perpetrators of the 'Miracle'. When death is restored, Danes detains the Mother (Frances Fisher), the leader of the families, before detonating them both. With his last words he states that he will again pursue \\"bad little girls\\" in hell. Casting and characterisation The Torchwood production team had sought to cast Bill Pullman (pictured) because of their perception of him as \\"America's Sweetheart\\". SFX magazine noted that when the character was first announced, some members of the public questioned the morality of featuring such a character in a science fiction action series. In August 2010 a reporter from entertainment website AfterElton also stated to the shows executive producers that some of their readers had been upset and concerned about details of the storyline. Pullman's casting as Danes was announced on 15 December 2010. Prior to his role as Danes, Pullman was best known to audiences for his portrayal of the President of the United States in Independence Day. When Pullman asked executive producer Julie Gardner why the production team sought to cast him in role, she replied that it was because he was perceived as \\"America's sweetheart\\", which he interpreted to mean they were looking to destabilise viewers. Torchwoods creator, Russell T Davies, noted that upon expressing an interest in casting Pullman, he was told \\"you haven't got a chance.\\" Though Pullman was aware of Torchwood, having had a friend who'd \\"evangelized\\" the series, he had not watched the series before being cast. Upon reading the scripts, Pullman commented that he had been impressed at how well the series \\"knows itself\\" and the strength of each character's individual voice. In an interview with Zap2it, he remarked that he thought he was given the best role in the series. Pullman noted that he was prepared for the role, having played other troubled characters in the past, and re-iterated that it was the writing that attracted him to the part, adding \\"I don't think I could do a child murderer just for a child murderer's sake\\". io9 felt the character of Danes to be a cross between Freddy Krueger and Jesus. Commenting on the Christ comparison, Pullman felt that his character was sort of the \\"doppelganger of Jesus or something.\\" He stated of Danes: \\"It's like he's been out in the desert, and he comes back in, and there is a certain kind of way in which he still has pride.\\" SFX described Danes' journey as one from a Hannibal Lecter type character to a Billy Graham or messianic figure. Pullman observed that Oswald's failure to die \\"becomes the pivot for a whole world that has changed\\"; feeling that his character was an intelligent one who knows he can provide a message people want to hear. Discussing Danes' fall from grace, series writer Jane Espenson explains that \\"humanity doesn't seize on heroes for the long‚Äìterm\\", and that Danes' descent from fame was a way to make his arc more realistic. Though Danes dies helping the Torchwood team, Espenson remarked that \\"we didn't want to outright redeem this horrible, horrible man\\" commenting that his death is intended as \\"redemption and comeuppance both.\\" The Independents Neela Debnath observed that whilst the character of Danes had \\"become likeable in an odd-sort of way\\" his last scenes \\"reiterated just how despicable he was\\" and that it was the right time for him to depart the cast. Reception Charlie Jane Anders of io9 commented enthusiastically on Danes' portrayal, stating that \\"perhaps the greatest miracle in Torchwood: Miracle Day is Bill Pullman's performance.\\" Anders cited that the character's journey \\"seems bizarre and unlikely, but Pullman makes it work.\\" Mikey O'Connell from Zap2it likened Pullman's performance to that of John Lithgow as The Trinity Killer in Dexter, both having the sense of \\"the familiar, comforting actor you've watched for decades\\" being \\"hijacked by someone else.\\" In a review of the first episode, Dan Martin from The Guardian opined that Pullman \\"stole the show as manipulative psychopath Oswald Danes\\" predicting \\"his character might give us one of the most compelling narratives.\\" Reviewing the fifth episode of the series The Independents Neela Debnath said of Pullman that \\"thus far he has given an extraordinary turn as Danes, which at times has veered towards hammy territory but has never entered it.\\" However, Debnath felt that with a key sequence where Danes makes a public speech \\"the line was finally crossed\\", believing the sequence \\"clich√©d\\" and that it was \\"improbable that he could instantaneously win over an angry lynch mob in moments.\\" The Daily Telegraphs Gavin Fuller praised Pullman's portrayal of Danes, singling it out as the strongest of the series next to lead female actor Eve Myles. Fuller also felt that giving such an unlikeable character a prominent focus and allowing him a shot at redemption in the final episode \\"was certainly a brave move from Davies.\\" In a post-series review of what worked and what did not during Torchwood's fourth series, Digital Spys Morgan Jeffrey stated that \\"Bill Pullman made the most of his tenure as Oswald Danes, being both extremely charismatic and utterly repellent throughout.\\" Jeffrey stated that \\"we never like Oswald, but Pullman's layered performance ensures that we do often sympathise with him, before having the rug pulled swiftly out from under us as he commits yet another heinous crime.\\" For his performance as Danes, Pullman received a Saturn Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor In Television.

History The house was built in 1907 to designs by Detmar Blow, for Frederick Smith (the son and heir of the Conservative politician and stationery magnate William Henry Smith). By 1930 it had become a hotel operated by the Great Western Railway, known as the Manor House Hotel. In 1948 it was taken over by the British Transport Commission. Expanded under new ownership in the 1990s, the castle was purchased and refurbished by the entrepreneur Peter de Savary in 2003 and renamed 'Bovey Castle'. In 2006 de Savary sold Bovey Castle to Hilwood Resorts. In 2014 it was sold to The Rigby Group plc as part of their Eden Hotel Collection. In 2017 British Olympic diver Tom Daley and American screenwriter Dustin Lance Black got married at Bovey Castle. Architecture The main building was built in 1907 in Jacobean style, with a Great Hall into which a floor was inserted in the 1980s. The interior is of high quality, with panelled rooms and elaborately carved features. Extensions were built in the 1930s. The garden front is set above terraces overlooking a lake and the River Bovey. Golf The hotel estate includes an 18-hole championship golf course that was designed by John Frederick Abercromby in 1926.

LCCN: n85-101696. Retrieved 2018-05-24. is a British cartoonist and illustrator who has worked for D.C. Thomson, publisher of The Beano and The Dandy. Now based in Canada, he illustrates children's picture books. Parkins was born in Brighton, but moved to Grantham, Lincolnshire at the age of five. He didn't take up art until sixth form, when he also began drawing caricatures of his teachers. He studied Wildlife Illustration at Dyfed College of Art for a year, before switching to graphic design at Lincoln College of Art, specialising in illustration. Graduating in 1979, he became a freelance illustrator, working on postcards, school textbooks, newspapers and magazines as well as comics. Parkins' first work for The Beano was on \\"Billy Whizz\\" in 1989. He quickly made his mark on the strip and the character, and made several changes, the most notable of these being the introduction of Billy's new lightning bolt tracksuit in May 1992. In 1990, he started to draw \\"Fred's Bed\\" in The Beezer as understudy to Tom Paterson, although in practice Parkins drew the vast majority of strips. He drew the strip until it was forced to end when the comic folded. In 1993, he stopped drawing Billy Whizz, but Trevor Metcalfe and Vic Neill had been drawing a number of the strips for some time. By this point he was drawing \\"Desperate Dan\\" for the Dandy, along with a revival of another Beano strip, \\"The Three Bears\\". Parkins' version of the latter strip was later cited by former Beano editor Euan Kerr as one of his personal favourites. After the Beano's 60th birthday celebrations in 1998, Parkins took over the comic's long-running character \\"Dennis the Menace\\". His first Dennis strips featured the story arc which introduced Bea, Dennis' younger sister. He drew Dennis on a regular basis until 2003, but his workload meant that a number of stories were also drawn by Nigel Parkinson and later Jimmy Hansen in this time. Parkins' time on Dennis encompassed the character's 50th birthday celebrations in 2001, and to mark the occasion he drew a special one-off Dennis strip explaining how he got his famous red and black striped jumper. David Parkins is currently still drawing for DC Thomson being the new artist of Desperate Dan for The Digital Dandy. Parkins has also illustrated two of Richard Platt's books in the Pirate Diary series. He has illustrated over fifty children's books, including titles by Dick King-Smith, Julie Markes, Laura Leuck and Martin Waddell. He has drawn cartoons for The Guardian, The Observer, The Sunday Times, the Times Higher Education Supplement, The Economist, and Nature. In 2006, after his fiftieth birthday, he emigrated to Ontario, Canada. In 2013, he became an occasional editorial cartoonist for The Globe and Mail. David Parkins is also the illustrator of That Cat Can't Stay and I Always, ALWAYS Get My Way, both written by Thad Krasnesky and published by Flashlight Press.

He was a member of the Canadian Men's Alpine Ski Team nicknamed the \\"Crazy Canucks\\", and is considered to be the original Crazy Canuck. Hunter was born in Shaunavon, Saskatchewan, Canada, the son of a dairy farmer, and started skiing at the age of eleven having previously played ice hockey. Hunter had a reputation as an off-beat individual; he practiced his racing tuck position atop a rack he built and placed in a pick-up truck as his father drove at over , and tested his balance by placing himself in the wheel of a moving tractor and jumping out. Hunter joined the Canadian Men's Alpine Ski Team in 1970, and earned himself the nickname \\"Jungle Jim\\" with his aggressive style on the slopes. Hunter represented Canada at two Winter Olympics. At the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan, he placed twentieth in the downhill, eleventh in the giant slalom, and nineteenth in the slalom. Although he didn't win an Olympic medal, the Olympic competition was also that year's World Championship, and the combined results were good enough to earn him a bronze medal in the alpine combined event. This was the first World Championship medal in alpine skiing won by a Canadian male skier. At the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, he placed tenth in the downhill, twenty-second in the giant slalom, and twenty-third in the slalom. Hunter placed in the top ten at seventeen World Cup events but never won a gold medal. He did reach the World Cup podium twice, a third-place finish in the downhill at Wengen, Switzerland in 1976 and a second-place finish in the combined at Kitzbuhel. Hunter retired from the Canadian ski team in March, 1977. He then competed as a professional on the World Pro Ski Tour winning the first ever downhill event held on the tour. In the run up to the Games of the XV Winter Olympiade, Hunter managed the 88-day Olympic Torch Relay from St. John's, Newfoundland, across Canada to the games site at Calgary, Alberta. Hunter hosted \\"The Jungle Jim Hunter Show\\" on The Fan 960 radio station.

Six more of these locomotives entered service in 1924.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1945). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VII - South African Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, November 1945. p. 867. Manufacturer The first experimental model of eventually seven Class GB branch line Garratt articulated locomotives was one of altogether five Garratts which were ordered by the South African Railways (SAR) from Beyer, Peacock and Company (BP) in 1914. The rest of the order consisted of three narrow gauge Class NG G11 2-6-0+0-6-2 locomotives and a single experimental Class GA 2-6-0+0-6-2 mainline locomotive. Production was disrupted by the First World War, however, and BP was only able to deliver the narrow gauge locomotives in 1919 and the two Cape gauge locomotives in 1921, after cessation of hostilities. Characteristics The Class GB was numbered 1650, but the engine number was later changed to 2166. The locomotive was erected in the Durban shops and placed in service in June 1921. It was superheated, with a Belpaire firebox, plate frames and Walschaerts valve gear. The boiler was provided with the Gresley type air valve and mechanical lubrication was provided for the coupled wheel axle boxes. x100px In 1924, six more locomotives of this Class were placed in service, also built by BP and numbered in the range from 2160 to 2165. They embodied all the improvements which experience with the first engine had shown desirable. The main differences between these locomotives and the original were revised boiler proportions and a larger water bunker capacity. The most obvious difference was a more completely enclosed cab with side windows instead of the curved cut-outs in the cab sides of the first locomotive. They were also heavier, compared to the of the engine of 1921. Service The first locomotive was placed in service working passenger trains on the Natal South Coast line. It proved to be a successful locomotive, having good riding qualities and flexibility on light track with poor ballasting and many curves of radius. A couple of the second batch of locomotives joined the first one on the South Coast line for a brief period, but most went directly to the Eastern Cape where they were used on the Port Alfred branch and the Aliwal North to Barkly East line, famous for its reverses and its 1 in 30 (3‚Öì%) compensated ruling gradients. The Natal locomotives were soon also relocated to work there when the Class GC Garratts replaced them on the South Coast line later in 1924. They remained working on the Barkly East branch until they were withdrawn from service in 1967. Illustration The main picture shows the retired first Class GB, no. 2166, originally no. 1650, at Voorbaai near Mosselbaai on 4 September 1997. Since the top of the front bunker is only about above the railhead, these locomotives were later equipped with a pedestal between the headlight and the water inlet to enable crew members to reach the overhead equipment when taking water.

Moshe Kupferman's work links recent lyric abstraction to the modernistic.

The final result testifies to the preceding stages, and to the inherent conflicts in his work, between expressive drama and introspection, form and atmosphere, destruction and construction.

It is structured around a series of residencies for artists from across Africa and the African diaspora working in numerous media and styles, a wide range of exhibitions, installations, performances, screenings, Internet link-ups, publications, round-table discussions and workshops. Its initiatives are directed at a diverse body of the public and actively engaged local communities. About SPARCK is a triennial endeavour. Its first three- year initiative (2009‚Äì2011) was entitled \\"Net / Works: Trans-Local Cultures in the Making of African Worlds.‚Äù This initiative explores intersections between creativity in multiple fields (visual, performance and new media arts; the spoken and written words; on-the-ground and in-the-virtual-world activism) and emergent urban spaces in the African world. It brings Cape Town and South Africa into a lively exchange with networks of urban artists, activists and scholars from three countries: Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Senegal. Through its multiple projects, SPARCK aims to foster cross- disciplinary and trans-local partnerships and endeavours, to promote dialogue and exchange that transcends the boundaries of age, social class, gender, as well as spatial, professional and ethnic difference. =Arts Residencies= Diary of a Paranoid Schizophrenic SPARCK launched its first arts residency in March 2009 with artist, Kakudji. A controversial multi-media artist, Kakudji was invited to construct a two-part project in South Africa. Part 1 took place in Johannesburg, during the first half March. The project, entitled \\"Urban Scenographies,\\" brought together over 30 artists from four continents for a period of one month and gave rise to three events: a 3-day festival of performances, exhibitions and installations held in inner-city Johannesburg; a conference/performance at one of France's foremost experimental arts venues, Th√©√¢tre Paris-Villette; and a multi-disciplinary installation at Art Basel. An experimental video by Kakudjii about the Scenographies project was featured in all three settings. Part 2 of Kakudji's residency took place In Cape Town from 16 March to 16 April 2009. Alongside video and still photography documenting his encounter with the \\"Mother City,\\" Kakudji produced a body of some fifty collages. In these works, Kakudji made use of local currency to frame his perceptions of the city and more broadly of South Africa. Thematically and formally, the work focused on notions of deal- making: how things are made and un-made, done and undone and how economies of violence (monetary, political, social) are developed and implemented through such processes. Ground  Overground  Underground Mowoso, a Congolese trans-disciplinary collective, began \\"Ground  Overground  Underground\\" in July 2009 and had their first showing in November 2012 at Afropolis. The intention of the project was to tell the story of the path African man travels from his home continent to the West, the centre of 21st century digital globalisation. The project began with a series of videos filmed in Mbandaka, Kinshasa, and Mikili, and used the materials collected in these places to evolve into a performance, installation, and architecture. Using various materials, the project sought to call attention to the bombardment of electronic technology overtaking the world and, more specifically, the devastation caused in the Congo by the West's mad rush for coltan. Neoliberal Machine \\"Neoliberal Machine\\" was a product of the collaboration of Eza Possibles, an arts collective of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and OKUP, a French arts collective, over the course of three years from 2009‚Äì2012. The project incorporated a wide range of media, including web arts, cartography, video, performance, installation arts, collage and painting. The focus of the project is the \\"art of the deal\\" in the contemporary global economy. WiAiA ‚Äì World into Art into Africa \\"WiAiA\\" was a workshop that took place in 2009 to discuss how contemporary art produced in Africa and the diaspora is and should be written about. It sought to find alternatives to the shallowness and cliches that mark much writing surrounding African art, and questioned how to more adequately address the relevance of African art in global cultural exchange. South-South Conversations The South-South Conversations began in 2010‚Äì2011 as a series of one-month residencies by photographers in three cities in Africa and then three cities of the African Diaspora in Southern Asia. Though the focus was initially photography, the project quickly evolved to include also experimental video, prose, sound, and internet interventions. Photographic Journeys Photographic Journeys was a 6-city, 9-artist residency from 2009‚Äì2011 that sought to challenge preconceived notions about informal, parallel, and other undervalued economies. The philosophy of the project was that the terms \\"informal\\" and \\"parallel\\" further marginalise these economies that are actually common to the majority of people on the planet. Through this project, artists explored the global dynamics that relate to these practices and the human condition in the late capitalist world. Totems Totems is a movable installation by Herve Youmbi, a Cameroonian visual artist. The project examines the impact of globalised capitalism on African art, in two parts: an ephemeral architectural space made of travel bars, and a photo exhibition of portraits of artists from the \\"developing world.\\" In the photographs, the artists wear sunglasses whose lenses have been covered by the logos of major museums, art fairs, galleries, or auction houses, intended to suggest, among other things, admiration, envy, and alienation. Urban Scenographies Artists Mega Mingiedi and Androa Mindre held one-month residencies in Dakar, Senegal from December 2012 to January 2013 to explore issues of urban public and common space, body politics and theatricality in the neighbourhood of Ouakam. The produce of their residencies was a public performance piece in which they turned themselves into living incarnations of temporary restaurants or other meeting places on street corners in Kinshasa. =Events= In early 2009, SPARCK's directors, Kadiatou Diallo and Dominique Malaquais, were invited to participate in Transmediale, an international festival of contemporary art and digital culture held in Germany. The festival, based in Berlin, showcases cutting-edge arts projects exploring the impact of new technologies on cultures worldwide, through exhibitions and installations, film and video programmes, live performances, publications, conferences and discussion panels linking live audiences with online participants. The SPARCK team participated in two discussion sessions. The first was entitled \\"Re-Hacking Your world: Sensible Software.‚Äù It focused on emergent digital and cellular cultures in Africa and activist / artistic possibilities arising from these. The second session, entitled ‚ÄúCritical Consumer Practice,‚Äù centred on the work of one of SPARCK's collaborators, a new media collective based in Kinshasa called Mowoso. The session was a live, online collaboration between Mowoso and SPARCK, linking Kinshasa and Berlin in real time with discussants on four continents, around an experimental performance and a debate about a highly contentious subject: the trade in Coltan, a metal essential to the production of cell phones, which has had a powerful and violent impact on vast swaths of Central and Eastern Africa. In April 2009, SPARCK participated in a colloquium on African urbanism hosted by the African Centre for Cities (ACC) at the University of Cape Town. This was the first in a series of three encounters, to take place over the next three years, bringing together artists and academics around novel ways of thinking about cities in Africa. SPARCK's participation in this process grows out of a broader collaboration between SPARCK and the colloquium organisers, Edgar Pieterse, founder and director of the ACC, and AbdouMaliq Simone, Professor of sociology at Goldsmith's College, University of London, both of whom have played a key role in developing the ideas and practices that underlie SPARCK.

Musa was given the estate by Emperor Stefan Uro≈° V (r. 1355-1371). They relocated their seat to Brvenik on the Ibar, due to the swapping of fortified cities with Vojislav Vojinoviƒá (around 1355-1363).

The Musiƒá brothers founded the Nova Pavlica monastery, built after the Stara Pavlica, near Brvenik (Ibar). The ktitor inscription is preserved. At the request of their mother Dragana, the sister of Lazar Hrebeljanoviƒá, the monastery became a nunnery, in which Dragana spent the end of her life as nun.

They had to drive him themselves to Al Ainy Hospital, the largest hospital in Egypt where he would slip into a coma and die of his wounds six days later on February 4, 2011. Context At the end of the thirty years of President Hosni Mubarak's leadership, Egypt suffered from economic instability, political corruption, starvation, high unemployment rates, and the presence of a 'youth bulge'. All of these are seen as reasons for the 2011 protests.Korotayev A., Zinkina J. \\"Egyptian Revolution: A Demographic Structural Analysis.\\" Entelequia. Revista Interdisciplinar 13 (2011): 139-169. According to 2011 World Bank figures, Egypt's economy grew at a rate of 4.5 percent which was exceptionally well for a third world country. Egyptian corruption levels according to World Transparency reports were ranked 80th. Though levels of political corruption were high, they were low in comparison to almost all other third world nations. What is believed to be the true reason for the political strife is the youth bulge. Due to rapidly increasing life expectancy and rapidly decreasing infant mortality rate people aged 20‚Äì24 had doubled since 1995. Just prior to the beginning of the peaceful protests nearly half of the unemployed were part of this youth cohort aged 20‚Äì24. Large numbers of youth have been historically responsible for political conflict. In Egypt reasons such as conflicting ideologies were responsible. Of the nearly 2.5 million youth unemployed, 43 percent had university degrees. This can be seen as why the protests were non-violent and of the 300 deaths nearly all were at the hands of the security forces and none from the protestors.Korotayev A., Zinkina J. Egyptian Revolution: A Demographic Structural Analysis. Entelequia. Revista Interdisciplinar 13 (2011): 139-169 Impact Mahmoud was the first reporter killed during the uprising in Egypt between protestors and Mubarak forces. The killing of a journalist and then the unresponsiveness of the ambulance has shaken Egypt's journalism community and furthered protests against the current regime. Mahmoud's widow and fellow journalist, Inas Abdel-Alim, is demanding a full on investigation from the government and a trial for the murder of her husband. Lucas Dolega, who was the first journalist killed in the Arab Spring uprising during the Tunisian uprising, was also killed while covering a protest. Dolega was on a photojournalism assignment for European PressPhoto Agency (epa) in Tunis. Response In response to the killing, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs released a statement saying the White House continues to receive, \\"very disturbing reports\\". He continued saying, \\"direct negotiations toward orderly transition\\" should be made for the power in Egypt.\\"EGYPT: Reporter who was shot last week dies at local hospital\\" LA Times, February 4, 2011 LA Times (09/20/11).

Early years Thomas Adams was born at Worksop, Nottinghamshire on 5 February 1807. His father (also named Thomas) was a maltster, a trade in the doldrums at that time. Not long after Thomas' birth, the family moved to Ware, Hertfordshire (his father's birthplace) to try to improve their situation. Thomas Senior died shortly afterwards, and his wife took the family up to the Sheffield area, where her family originated from. In 1821, aged 14, Thomas was sent to Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire to become apprentice to a draper in the town. After serving his full seven years, he moved to London. During this time he was tricked into going over to Paris, and was robbed and abandoned there. Through the help of an English lace merchant, he was able to make his return journey. Reflecting on his stupidity in later years, Adams felt that the incident had influenced his life from then on. Safely back in London, he had a brief time in the warehouse of Messrs Boden, a Derby lace company, before moving to Nottingham.  Business beginnings Thomas arrived in Nottingham in late 1829, opening business from a small house at 9 Stoney Street. On 2 September 1830, he married Lucy Cullen, daughter of a Nottingham businessman, in St Mary's Church, just a stone's throw away. He seems to have formed business partnerships, buying made lace goods and selling them on to wholesale and retail customers. In the mid-1830s, he was shown in local business directories as a lace manufacturer. Within 4 years, the business moved the short distance to 14/15 St Mary's Gate where, with successive partners, he was to remain for the next 20 years.  Philanthropist, Christian and family man Green plaque honouring Adams' achievements Adams had some reverses in trading, the scope of his business being reduced in 1843 and 1844 through a financial crisis brought about by the failure of an agent. In 1857 there was a fluctuation in the lace trade prompted by panic in America, and the American Civil War caused a worldwide shortage of cotton for much of the 1860s. He was a hard and sharp businessman, strictly honest but often capable of striking a good bargain. Away from commerce, he was extremely generous, giving away large sums of money to charity, in particular, to religious and educational projects. For example, in 1846, he anonymously gave ¬£500 to the Bishop of Lincoln towards the building of a school for the poor. Later, after the 1870 Education Act, he gave ¬£500 and a further ¬£400 towards the site for a new school in nearby Poplar Street. He was one of a band of Christian philanthropists who succeeded in building 6 churches in Nottingham. One of these, St Luke's Church, Nottingham was of particular interest to Adams as many of its parishioners were Adams Company employees. He laid its foundation stone on 2 July 1862. After his death, the family bought land and provided several hundred pounds to build St Philip's Church, Pennyfoot Street, intended to be the Thomas Adams memorial church. St Mary's, where Thomas and Lucy married, has a large stained-glass memorial window at its West end. There is also a memorial to Thomas in St Leodegarius Church, Basford. Expansion ‚Äì the Adams and Page warehouse File:Lace Market, Adams Building principal facade from Stoney Street, April 2018.jpgPrincipal facade, Adams and Page warehouse, Stoney Street, Nottingham File:Adams-exterior-2.jpgPhase 2, Warser Gate frontage File:Adams- detail.JPGDetailing, Warser Gate facade  Employee facilities The evangelical proprietor wrote a short tract, a copy of which was given to every employee before the move into the new warehouse; outlining not only the provision for their physical well-being, but also for their spiritual side: :\\"We desire to regard you as our fellow Christians, and to do all that lies in our power to advance the interest of you as well as your bodily welfare. For this object we have set apart a room in the new warehouse, in which we invite you to meet us every morning in social worship, so that we may seek the blessing of God upon our daily labours.\\" Hine, in fact, designed a special chapel located in the basement (designated as Floor B in the ncn Adams Building). This was provided with \\"comfortable benches and kneeling\\" and had stained glass windows facing onto the main Stoney Street facade. Records show that some 400 out of a predominantly female workforce of around 600 attended chapel from 8.00 to 8.30 am, in paid work time. Thomas Adams was always present, having left home promptly at 7.45. Often he would walk in from his home at Lenton Firs, Derby Road. A chaplain was appointed on an annual salary of ¬£200 to conduct the morning service. Later, the tradition of a New Year service in the chapel was established, with (as late as the 1930s) the Bishop of Southwell or Sheffield providing the address. For the staff's physical well-being, a separate building contained an employees' dining room, men's tea room and segregated washing facilities for both sexes. Other benefits included 'Improvement Classes', Children's Classes, a 'Penny Bank', Medical Aid Society and Library.  Further business expansion The opening of the Stoney Street warehouse was inevitably the high point in Adams' career. Between 1857 and 1860, Thomas Adams & Company flourished;this in spite of recessions in the lace trade during which time nearly 60 lace firms went bankrupt. The warehouse was greatly enlarged in the mid-1860s; probably on the strength of its flotation as a limited company. A bleaching, dyeing and lace-dressing factory at Sherwood Hill in New Basford; was built to TC Hine's designs. = Nottingham Joint Stock Bank = The end of the American Civil War had brought about a general improvement in the cotton-based textile trades, and there was a need for fresh capital to expand the lace industry. With the support of businessmen from Nottingham (including Adams) and Birmingham, the Joint Stock Bank was formed with a capital of ¬£1 million and offices at 60 Bridlesmith Gate. The Bank flourished, and, not surprisingly, Thomas Adams & Company became one of its first clients. Adams became a Director of the Bank, and by 1873, Chairman. On 31 January 1873, he laid the foundation stone of the new Head Office on Victoria Street (now the Victoria Club).  Civic connections Outside of business interests, Thomas took on a range of civic responsibilities. A Tory, he was first elected as a Councillor for St Mary's Ward in 1846 and continued to represent the ward for the next 28 years. On several occasions, he was offered the position of Mayor, itself an accolade in Whig-dominated Nottingham, but declined the honour. in November 1856, Adams and Richard Birkin were both appointed as Borough Magistrates. Thomas served in the role for 15 years, also becoming a magistrate for the county of Nottinghamshire also. May 1861 saw Adams appointed as a Charitable Trustee for the Borough. He was also a member of the Lenton School Board and Radford Board of Guardians. Even in his last year, Thomas was serving on several Borough committees, namely: the Bridge Estate, Parliamentary and Free Public Libraries and Museums.  Later years The death of his eldest son, Samuel, in 1870 was a major blow, and signalled a steady decline in Thomas' health. This was also a setback for future company plans as Thomas had assumed that sons Samuel and John would at some stage take over from him. Thomas was suffering from jaundice, and in 1871, sought specialist care and treatment in Germany. His condition, however, gradually worsened and he died at Lenton Firs, for so long the family home, on 16 May 1873. It was reported that more than 10,000 people attended his funeral, held at \\"The Valley of the Rocks\\", in the Church Cemetery on Mansfield Road. The stretch of Derby Road, which nowadays climbs along the edge of the University of Nottingham Highfields campus, close to Lenton Firs is named Adams Hill to this day.  Thomas Adams' legacy Looking back at his concern for his workforce, it is interesting to pick up the provisions he made for their welfare when the company was incorporated in 1865. The Company would help in \\"the establishing, managing and assisting of churches, chapels, schools, libraries, banks, dispensaries, infirmaries, provident societies, clubs and other institutions for the benefit of persons employed by the Company and their families and others.\\" This passed a man who said \\"I can make money but I cannot make a speech.\\" He certainly \\"made money\\", but for 25 years there was not a church or school built in Nottingham to which he did not contribute. Whilst he gave small subscriptions publicly, his large gifts were anonymous and only revealed after his death. When probate was granted in July 1873, his estate was put at ¬£90,000 ().

Another scenario (known as ‚Äòflash for cash‚Äô) happens when a driver flashes their lights at a junction to let the victim out, then crashes into the victim's car deliberately.

It passes through the Vigezzo Valley (Italian side) and Centovalli (Swiss side). It touches the villages of Druogno, Santa Maria Maggiore, Malesco and Intragna and carried over 1 million passengers in 2010. It is operated by the Ferrovie Autolinee Regionali Ticinesi (FART) in Switzerland and the Societ√† Subalpina di Imprese Ferroviarie S.p.A. (SSIF) in Italy. Opened on 25 November 1923, the long railway has 30 stations and takes approximately 2 hours to traverse the whole length. The Italian-Swiss border is crossed between the towns of Ribellasca and Camedo. History Electric train ABe 4/6 of the SSIF in Intragna station Following a convention signed in Rome on 12 November 1918 between the plenipotentiaries Sidney Sonnino and De Segesser, respectively, of the King of Italy and the Federal Council of the Swiss Confederation, the construction of the railway began. The railway started with an initiative mainly due to the then Mayor of Locarno Francis Dance. The builders used part of the existing meter gauge Locarno-Bignasco railway at the start of the eastern end of the new line. This set the meter gauge of the whole line. Since then the railway has regularly performed its task of connecting the communities between Locarno and Domodossola. The line continued after the period of mass motorization, when some considered the train to be obsolete. The railway currently plays an important economic and tourist function in the area. It is the shortest and most scenic link between the major trans-Alpine railways that pass through the Simplon and Gotthard tunnels. Combined with the Simplon railway, it provides a fast connection between the Swiss Cantons of Valais and Ticino. 1978 flood On 7 August 1978, a flood struck the railway causing damage affecting almost 700 meters of track, mainly on the Italian side. Thankfully there were no injuries but reconstruction of the line lasted until the end of the year. Specifications Engine Tm 2/2 9 of the maintenance team in Intragna station The railway bridge below Intragna * Gauge: * Length: about 52.2 km (of which 32.300 is in Italian territory, 19.833 in Switzerland) * Voltage: 1,350 V DC * Electrical substations: 5 (including 3 in Switzerland) * Stations and stops with passing loops: 21 (13 in Italian territory, 8 in Switzerland) * Passengers transported annually between 1982 and 1985: ** 1982 - 896,411 ** 1983 - 917,737 ** 1984 - 852,381 ** 1985 - 869,215 Route The route, like other mountain railways, has some dramatic inclines between the Masera and Santa Maria Maggiore (Italy), and between Verdasio and Intragna (Switzerland); in some places the gradient is 60 per thousand. A trip between Domodossola and Locarno, takes slightly less than 2 hours. The railroad connects with the Swiss national railway terminals at both ends. At Locarno, trains run frequently to scenic Lugano. The name \\"Centovalli\\" (100 valleys) derives from the existence of the many valleys along the line upon which are perched small towns. The mountainous geography means that there are many bridges and viaducts to admire on a journey. The trip is exceptionally scenic and negotiates many gorges. Fares and equipment Since at least October 2012, there is new rolling stock called the \\"panoramic train\\". When taking this train, regardless of the type of ticket held, a supplement of ‚Ç¨1,50 or CHF2,00 per passenger is collected, in cash, on board by the conductor. The departure board mentions \\"supplemento\\" for runs on the panoramic train. The supplement is not collected on other trains on the route. Although it is an Italian train, the Centovalli fare (but not the supplement) is included in the scope of the various Swiss Rail flat rate and discount passes, as are journeys from Domodossola. The Swiss portion of the line is managed by Ferrovie Autolinee Regionali Ticinesi. On the Swiss side, directional signs and employees prominently display the company's acronym, FART.

As of the 2010 census, the population of the community was 213. History The Munjor community was one of six settlements founded in 1876 by Volga German immigrants from Russia. Their German ancestors had immigrated to the Volga Region of Russia around 1767 at the invitation of Catherine the Great in 1763. Catherine invited the German people to Russia to develop the vast steppes and promised them land, freedom from military conscription and religious freedom. By about 1870 these privileges were at risk. Because of impending military conscription and loss of religious freedom, the communities of German settlers along the Volga River elected five men to act as scouts to inspect the prospects of life in America. Peter Leiker (of Obermonjou), Peter Stecklien (of Zug), Anton Wasinger (of Sch√∂nchen), Nicholas Schamme (of Graf), and Jacob Ritter (of Luzern) left from Obermonjou, Russia in 1874, landed in New York City and traveled westward as far as Nebraska. They found the prospects of life in America and the farmland of Nebraska favorable and returned to Russia with their report. Encouraged by the accounts of these men, a group of colonists left Russia in 1875 and landed in Baltimore on November 23, 1875. They traveled westward, spending the winter in Topeka, Kansas and then moved on to settle in Ellis County in the spring of 1876. Other groups followed in the spring and summer months of 1876. The largest group was composed of 108 families which left from Saratov on July 8, 1876. The group divided into two parts for ocean transportation, the larger part coming on the North-German Lloyd Line, and the rest by way of the Hamburg-American Line. In this latter group were the founders of Munjor, including three of the original scouts: Peter Leiker, Anton Wasinger, and Peter Stecklein. After landing in New York August 3, they immediately headed westward traveling to Topeka and then to Herzog, Kansas, and within a few days moved to a tract of land along Big Creek and after 2 months moved to Section 25, Range 18 in Wheatland Township which is now Munjor, Kansas. Other immigrant groups arrived in Munjor in November 1876, September 1877, and July 1878. The immigrants referred to their settlement as Obermonjou, and oftentimes had difficulty with reading and writing in English, and their German pronunciation of many words provided the only guide English speaking civil authorities had to create legal documents. It is because of these types of translation errors that Munjor had six different spellings at various times: Obermonchu, Over Mancha, Obermonjour, Over Muncha, Offermoncha and Monjor. Sometime around 1880 to 1882, the name Munjor was finally accepted by the settlers as a shortened practical version of native Obermonjou. The origins for the name of the town of Munjor go back to the German people who established villages along the Volga River in Russia around 1764 to 1768. When the Germans left their homeland to settle along the Volga River, they were divided into groups of 100 families and was given a leader. Two German speaking Frenchmen with the last name of Monjou became the leaders of two of the groups. The older, Major Otto Friedrich de Monjou, became the leader of a Catholic group which settled along the Volga, north of Saratov. The younger Monjou established a colony of Lutherans further south. Both villages were named Monjou, which caused confusion and resulted in the Russian civil authorities to name the northern colony Obermonjou and the southern colony Neidermonjou. Geography Munjor is located at (38.8111231, -99.2648236) at an elevation of 1,946 feet (593 m). It lies on the southwest side of Big Creek, a tributary of the Smoky Hill River, in the Smoky Hills region of the Great Plains. Munjor is roughly 4.5 miles (7 km) south of Interstate 70, 3 miles (5 km) east of U.S. Route 183, and 5 miles (8 km) southeast of Hays, the county seat. Demographics For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Munjor as a census-designated place (CDP). As of the 2010 census, there were 213 people, 99 households, and 66 families residing in the community. There were 112 housing units. The racial makeup of the community was 98.1% White and 1.9% from some other race. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 2.3% of the population. There were 99 households, out of which 21.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 49.5% were married couples living together, 7.1% had a male householder with no wife present, 10.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.3% were non-families. 28.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.15, and the average family size was 2.59. In the community, the population was spread out, with 17.4% under the age of 18, 7.3% from 18 to 24, 22.1% from 25 to 44, 33.5% from 45 to 64, and 19.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 46.8 years. For every 100 females, there were 100.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 112.1 males age 18 and over.

The full title of the second edition combines both: Prosodia Rationalis: or, An Essay Towards Establishing the Melody and Measure of Speech, to be Expressed and Perpetuated by Peculiar Symbols. In this work Steele proposes a notation for linguistic prosody.Hatfield, p. 1. The notation is inspired by that used in music. The treatise is notable as one of the earliest works in the subject and its insight that in speech, unlike in most music, pitches slide rather than exhibit distinct tones held for lengths of time.Roth 2006 Origin and structure In 1774 James Burnett, Lord Monboddo published the second of 6 volumes of his On the Origin and Progress of Language containing, among much else, a section dealing with \\"language considered as sound\\".Omond 1921, pp 70-71. Sir John Pringle (then president of the Royal Society) asked Joshua Steele to respond to some of Monboddo's statements,Omond 1921, pp 86-87. particularly the statement: > That there is no accent, such as the Greek and Latin accents, in any modern > language. ... We have accents in English, and syllabic accents too; but > there is no change of the tone in them; the voice is only raised more, so as > to be louder upon one syllable than another. ... Now I appeal to them, > whether they can perceive any difference of tone betwixt the accented and > unaccented syllable of any word? And if there be none, then is the music of > our language, in this respect, nothing better than the music of a drum, in > which we perceive no difference except that of louder or softer.Monboddo > 1774 pp 276, 298-99; quoted in Steele 1779, pp 2-3. Steele's objection occupies most of the first 2 Parts of Prosodia Rationalis.Omond 1921, pp 87. > But as each section of Steele's argument was completed, he sent it off for > Lord Monboddo's comments, which were then incorporated along with Steele's > replies in subsequent sections of the book: \\"consequently, Prosodia > Rationalis is, in effect, an extended dialogue between the two men, to which > is appended, in the second edition, an additional series of questions from > other hands, together with the author's replies.\\" Brogan 1981, E394; in turn > incorporating a quotation from Omond. The five orders of accidents Joshua Steele's \\"peculiar symbols\\": The \\"notes\\" indicate quantity at the top and the sliding accent at the bottom; pauses are indicated by the little L-shaped marks; poize by the triangular and dotted forms; and force by both single quotes and zig-zags. Steele proposed that the \\"melody and measure\\" of speech could be analyzed and recorded by notating five distinct types of characteristics, the \\"five orders of accidents\\".Steele 1779, p 24. These are broadly analogous to the suprasegmentals of modern linguistics. The five orders are: #Accent: the pitch (melody) of the syllable, not‚Äîas in music‚Äîa fixed pitch, but rather acute (rising), grave (falling), or circumflex (both rising and falling, resulting in either a peak or dip in the middle). #Quantity: the duration of the syllable, regarded as semibrief (whole note), minim (half note), crotchet (quarter note), or quaver (eighth note); plus dotted (√ó 1.5) versions of each length. #Pause: silence or rest, measured by the same durations as quantity. (Steele marks his pauses with the accidents of both quantity and poize‚Äîbut logically not accent or force. Therefore, pause does not exist, in his practice, on the same hierarchical level as the other accidents, functioning more like a syllable.) #Poize: also emphasis or cadence, \\"a term [emphasis] Steele uses ambivalently and confusedly to denote both the absolute duration between stresses (cadence, bar), and also the stresses themselves...\\" Brogan 1981, E394. Steele notes three levels: heavy, light, lightest. \\"Heavy\\" is equivalent to the Greek thesis (essentially \\"downbeat\\"), and \\"light\\" to the Greek arsis (essentially \\"upbeat\\"), hence in his quasi-musical notation every bar begins with a heavy element; \\"lightest\\" is called into service for triple- time cadences, \\"minuet and jigg\\".Steele 1779, p 21. #Force: the loudness of the syllable, marked as loud, louder, soft, or softer; Steele also occasionally marks crescendos and diminuendos over a string of syllables.

The Director and his Motivations The director/producer of the film, Jeffrey D. King, a former resident of rural Montana in the area around Yellowstone, grew up familiar with the issue of wolf reintroduction, and was inspired to make the film by his religious convictions and his passions for wildlife and videography.Crying Wolf Movie throughout Given this background, he was well aware of the issues at hand and the arguments against reintroducing the wolves. A unique dimension to the film is the Christian concept of taking dominion (Genesis 1:28, repeating, in command form, the part of God's plan also contained in Genesis 1:26). The Dominion Mandate, the idea, is not to be confused with Dominionism or Dominion Theology, both of which are rooted in that concept.to \\"Dominion mandate\\" Cultural mandate compared to dominion mandate In Christianity, taking dominion (using the earth and its resources for the needs of man and to the glory of God) is the corollary of Biblical stewardship (conserving those resources for later use or for aesthetic reasons and to the glory of God), both concepts being primarily derived from the passage in Genesis. The preceding two verses, Genesis 1:26, 27 are the basis for Imago Dei, wherefrom Christians hold that man ultimately derives his nature, distinctiveness, value, rights, will, individuality, and sovereignty, but also his subordinate status to his Creator Content Featured in the film as interviewees are retired USFWS biologist Jim Beers, Stephen Vantassel Ph.D.,Vantassel Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation President David Allen, and Abundant Wildlife Society of North America's founder, Troy R.

It stars Carmen Miranda, with support from Michael O'Shea, Vivian Blaine, Phil Silvers, Sheila Ryan and Perry Como. The screenplay was by Robert Ellis, Helen Logan and Frank Gabrielson, based on the 1943 Broadway Musical of the same name, starring Ethel Merman with Cole Porter's songs. The film's story revolves around the adventures of three cousins who find themselves joint heirs to an abandoned mansion in Masonville, Georgia. Chiquita Hart, played by Miranda, Harry (Phil Silvers) and Blossom (Vivian Blaine) leave their jobs, and decide to reform the place and rent it for military spouses who are in the war front, combining the hostel service to performers shows. Judy Holliday can be spotted in a brief role six minutes into the film. This is her third film. Plot After cousins actress Blossom Hart (Vivian Blaine), defense plant worker Chiquita Hart (Carmen Miranda) and inventor Harry Hart (Phil Silvers) each learn that they are heirs to a large plantation in Masonville, Georgia, they travel separately to Masonville, and in the office of lawyer Col. Jefferson L. Calhoun, meet for the first time. As they are all poor, they are thrilled by the inheritance, but when Calhoun takes them to Magnolia Manor, they discover that the once glorious plantation house is now a ruin. In addition, paying the plantation's various property and inheritance taxes will put them deeply in debt. While the cousins are bemoaning their fate, Staff Sgt. Ronald \\"Rocky\\" Fulton (Michael O'Shea), who was a well-known orchestra leader before joining the military, arrives with some of his men, including Sgt. Laddie Green (Perry Como). Rockie explains that the married service men of nearby Camp Dixon want to rent rooms in the manor for their wives, who have been unable to live close to their husbands due to a lack of available housing. The men pitch in and help the cousins fix up the manor, although Chiquita is continually bothered by the fact that she can pick up radio programs on the fillings in her teeth. Rocky, who has begun a romance with Blossom, suggests that they put on a musical show to raise funds for the renovations. On the day that \\"The Old Southern Corn Revue\\" is to open, Blossom is stunned by the arrival of Melanie Walker (Sheila Ryan), a snobbish, rich woman, who Rocky is forced to admit is his fianc√©. Melanie, believing that Rocky has arranged for the manor to be let just for her, imperiously announces the changes she intends to make, and the infuriated Blossom refuses to speak to Rocky. Before the show, Rocky explains to a disapproving Chiquita that he loves only Blossom. The show is a big success, and the next morning, Chiquita advises Blossom to fight for Rocky if she loves him. The snooty Melanie ends up covered with eggs after she tries to work one of Harry's new inventions, and she seeks solace from Lt. Ashley Crothers (Glenn Langan). While the lieutenant is there, he discovers that Harry is hosting a dice game for some of the soldiers, none of whom have wives staying at the manor. Crothers arrests the soldiers and recommends that the house be posted as off-limits for all military personnel. Col. Grubbs approves Crother's suggestion, and soon the wives are packing to leave. Meanwhile, after Harry learns that carborundum from the defense plant got into Chiquita's fillings and is causing her to receive radio programs, he decides to build an invention around the idea. One afternoon, Rocky comes to the house to try to talk to Blossom, who refuses to see him. Rocky is supposed to be on duty for war games, and is captured by the \\"enemy\\" army, which has taken over the manor as its headquarters. Hoping to save both his stripes and the manor, Rocky enlists the aid of Chiquita and Harry, who begin building a transmitter to send a message to Rocky's unit via Chiquita's teeth. The message is sent, and the cousins distract the \\"enemy\\" army with a song and dance show while Rocky's army assembles for its attack. Soon after, Rocky's side has prevailed in the maneuvers, and in appreciation of Blossom, Chiquita and Harry's help, the off-limits sign is removed and the manor is once again the site of much happiness for the military men and their wives. At a celebratory party, Rocky announces that he has been selected for officer's candidate school, and the happy Blossom reconciles with him.

However, the film version uses only the title song from Porter's score, and otherwise features no music from the stage show. In addition, Chiquta's role was expanded for Miranda: in the musical, it is Blossom who receives messages from her fillings. According to information in the Twentieth Century-Fox Records of the Legal Department, located at the UCLA Library, in November 1942, the studio advanced $62,500 to Michael Todd and Savoy Productions for production of the musical, then purchased the screen rights to it in 1943. Although the legal records give the purchase price as $265,000, a 12 March 1943 The Hollywood Reporter news item lists the amount paid by Fox as $305,000. Per the agreement with Todd, Fox could not release the film until at least the summer of 1944, which, as The Hollywood Reporter noted, was to \\"enable the stage original to play the key cities and tour without competition from the celluloid version.\\" Only one of Cole Porter's songs for the musical was included in the film version. The Hollywood Reporter news items note that William Perlberg was originally slated to produce this film, Irving Cummings was to direct it and Betty Grable was to star in it. In January 1944, H. Bruce Humberstone was assigned to direct the picture and Brenda Marshall was set for the female lead. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Humberstone auditioned The Jeepers, a seven-piece novelty orchestra, but they do not appear in the finished film. Although a 23 February 1944 The Hollywood Reporter news item noted that dance director Nick Castle was working with Carmen Miranda to prepare a \\"four-movement, symphonic treatment\\" of the popular song Mairzy Doats, the number was not included in the film. In April 1944, The Hollywood Reporter noted that Scott Elliott had been tested for the film, but his participation in the finished picture has not been confirmed. Although a The Hollywood Reporter news item and studio press releases include Billie Seward, Stanley Prager, Chester Conklin, Harry Seymour and Jo-Carroll Dennison in the cast, they do not appear in the completed film. The picture marked the screen debuts of popular singer Perry Como and actor Rory Calhoun, who appeared under the name Frank McCown. Modern sources also include Judy Holliday in the cast. A studio credit sheet lists the film's running time as 78 min. According to information in the legal records and the Twentieth Century-Fox Produced Scripts Collection, the following writers worked on various versions of the screenplay: Harry Segall, Marian Spitzer, Eddie Welch, Snag Werris, Samuel Hoffenstein and Betty Reinhardt. The extent of their contributions to the completed film has not been confirmed, however. Notes from a 12 January 1944 studio conference reveal that production head Darryl F. Zanuck wanted the same writers who wrote Greenwich Village, a 1944 Twentieth Century-Fox picture starring Carmen Miranda, to write Miranda's dialogue for this film, because \\"they wrote especially for her, with mispronunciations, etc., and she is very funny when she is given this style of writing.\\" The Greenwich Village screenwriters did not contribute to Something for the Boys, but Miranda's trademark mangling of the English language is included in the film. The studio records also note that the Southland Routine, which is performed by Phil Silvers, includes excerpts from the following songs: Southland by Silvers, Harold Adamson and Jimmy McHugh; Dixie's Land by Dan Emmet; All Over God's Heaven, traditional spiritual; Shortnin' Bread, words by Jacques Wolfe, music traditional; Indian Dance by Urban Theilman; and Climin' Up Dem Golden Stairs by McHugh and Adamson. The studio records contain letters from songwriters Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn, who stated that the Southland Routine was based on their work. In early 1945, Twentieth Century-Fox paid the composers three thousand dollars not to pursue their claim. According to a 3 February 1943 The Hollywood Reporter news item, owners of the radio show The Court of Missing Heirs filed an infringement of copyright lawsuit against the producers and owners of the play Something for the Boys. The owners of the radio program alleged that the play infringed on their show's premise. The disposition of the suit is unknown. Release The film was released on November 1, 1944. In June 2008, Something for the Boys was released in DVD as part of Fox's \\"The Carmen Miranda Collection.\\"  Critical reception  On the film's release on November 1, 1944, Bosley Crowther of The New York Times said that Something for the Boys features a \\"variety of musics, much gay humor and a superabundance of beautiful girls. As for tempestuous Miss Miranda, she is still rather fearful to behold, and sings as a human radio set.\\" Time magazine wrote that the film \\"turns out to have nothing very remarkable. There is not Carmen Miranda.\\" \\"It should be more fun than it is,\\" wrote Dave Kehr in the Chicago Reader. Variety thought that it was \\"sufficiently diverting and tuneful to warrant more than moderate success at the box-office.\\" Perry Como, the magazine said, \\"makes a good appearance before the cameras\\" and his two songs were \\"quite listenable and well sold.\\" References External links  * Category:1944 films Category:1944 musical comedy films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American films Category:American musical comedy films Category:American films based on plays Category:Films directed by Lewis Seiler Category:Films scored by Leigh Harline Category:Films based on musicals Category:1944 comedy films ","title":"Something for the Boys (film)"},{"id":"33108959","text":"Jonny Kearney & Lucy Farrell were a contemporary English folk duo. Although they played some traditional songs, most of the songs they sang were their own compositions influenced by the folk tradition, but also songs by other artists such as Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, Cole Porter, Brian Wilson and The Beatles. Kearney took lead vocals, guitar, piano and ukulele; Farrell played fiddle, viola and saw and added harmony vocals. Together they produced a sparse sound described by The Guardian as \\"delicate, thoughtful and intimate\\". Career Kearney is from Hexham in Northumberland and Farrell from Maidstone in Kent. They met whilst studying on Newcastle University's Folk and Traditional Music course in 2005, where Kearney was awarded the Alan Hull prize for songwriting. Having gigged at folk clubs and festivals, including Green Man, End of the Road and Cambridge Folk Festival, they came to the attention of fellow North East England folk musicians The Unthanks. Adrian McNally from The Unthanks produced their first six-song EP entitled The North Farm Sessions after the farm belonging to Rachel Unthank and Adrian McNally, where it was recorded. The EP, released in May 2010 on Rabble Rouser Records, comprised largely their own compositions with a rearrangement of one traditional song, and met with effusive reviews from The Guardian, Uncut, Q Magazine and MTV. Tracks from the EP were featured on BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2, BBC Radio 3 and BBC 6 Music with a Campfire Special session recorded for Rob da Bank's Radio 1 show in October 2010. Support slots on tours by The Unthanks and Bellowhead followed in 2009/10, with favourable reviews. In 2010 Jonny Kearney & Lucy Farrell were nominated for the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards' Horizon award which is given to best emerging artists. They were also nominated for an award for best duo in the 2012 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. Their first full length album, Kite, also recorded at North Farm, was released on 10 October 2011. The intimacy of the duo‚Äôs sound is still at the heart of the record, but is fleshed out at times by Adrian McNally (Unthanks) on piano, Dean Ravera on double bass, Chris Hibbard on trombone, Paul Ruddick on saxophone and clarinet and Peter Tickell (Peatbog Fairies, Sting, Kathryn Tickell Band) on fiddle. The duo also contributed to a range of other people's work, including viola and vocals from Farrell on Emily Portman's album The Glamoury. Farrell is also part of the Emily Portman Trio and The Furrow Collective (the Trio joined by Alasdair Roberts). Kearney played piano on The Unthanks' autumn 2011 tour of Robert Wyatt and Antony Hegarty songs.

Bruce Humberstone and starring June Haver along with George Montgomery, Vivian Blaine, Celeste Holm, and Vera-Ellen. The 20th Century-Fox film was adapted from Stephen Powys' 1938 play Three Blind Mice and featured songs with music by Josef Myrow and lyrics by Mack Gordon. The score is notable for the first appearance of the classic song \\"You Make Me Feel So Young\\" later popularized by Frank Sinatra in 1956. Plot summary In 1902 Red Bank, New Jersey, sisters of modest means Pam (June Haver), Liz (Vivian Blaine), and Myra Charters (Vera-Ellen) inherit a chicken farm from their aunt. They soon discover that the windfall is not quite enough to finance their dreams of attracting and marrying millionaires. Reasoning that if one of them catches a rich husband, the other two will thereafter find it easier to do the same, they decide to pool their inheritances. Pam poses as a wealthy heiress, Liz poses as her social secretary, and Myra poses as her maid. The three go to Atlantic City, check into a luxurious hotel, and promptly meet millionaire Steve Harrington (Frank Latimore). When Steve sends a bottle of champagne to Pam, Myra meets Mike (Charles Smith), a waiter who becomes taken with her. A third man, Steve's friend Van Damm Smith (George Montgomery), ostensibly another millionaire, joins in the following day when the girls' plot to interest Steve by pretending to be drowning goes awry. Steve and Van both court Pam, while Myra and Mike fall in love. Although ostensibly pursuing Pam, Steve begins to be attracted to Liz. Van proposes to Pam; however, she tells him the truth about her plan to marry a rich man and he in turn reveals that he is not really rich and is also scheming to marry a rich woman. The two call off their romance, deciding to stick to their plans of marrying money. Van helps Pam by telling Steve that she is in love with him; Steve proposes to Pam and she accepts. The couples are all sorted out after a trip to Harrington's family home in Maryland, with some help from Steve's sister Miriam (Celeste Holm). Steve finally realizes he is in love with Liz, Van and Pam decide they would rather be with one another, and Mike and Myra are married. Cast * June Haver as Pam Charters * George Montgomery as Van Damm Smith * Vivian Blaine as Liz Charters * Celeste Holm as Miriam Harrington * Vera-Ellen as Myra Charters * Frank Latimore as Steve Harrington * Charles Smith as Mike Bailey (uncredited) Production Production on this movie began in November 1945 and was completed in February 1946, over 100 days of shooting at a cost of $2,335,000. The main cast members were all on contract to Fox; Celeste Holm made her Hollywood film debut as Miriam Harrington. It was reported 20th Century-Fox wanted Broadway actor/dancer Harold Lang for the role of Vera- Ellen‚Äôs boyfriend Mike but he had to refuse because of stage commitments. A great loss because he would have introduced the now-classic song \\"You Make Me Feel So Young\\". His replacement was non-singer/dancer, minor-player Charles Smith (actor). Although Lang appeared on television in the early 1950s, he made no commercial films. =Screenplay= Valentine Davies adapted the screenplay from the play Three Blind Mice by Stephen Powys (aka, Guy Bolton). Fox had acquired the American rights to the play in 1937, first making a non- musical 1938 movie (also called Three Blind Mice). It was adapted as the movie musical Moon Over Miami in 1941 before being tapped again five years later as the basis for Three Little Girls in Blue. The plot‚Äîthree fortune-hunting sisters encounter humorous difficulties‚Äîwas scarcely altered; even the character names are largely unchanged from the play. The locale was shifted to Atlantic City and the timeframe moved to 1902, reflecting a turn-of-the- century theme popular in musicals at the time. =Music= Mack Gordon, who also produced the film, wrote the lyrics and Josef Myrow composed most of the songs for Three Little Girls in Blue, including \\"On the Boardwalk (in Atlantic City)\\", \\"Somewhere in the Night\\", and \\"You Make Me Feel So Young\\". Initially, Gordon thought \\"You Make Me Feel So Young\\" too modern for the 1902 setting, but when Darryl F. Zanuck heard all the music played, he insisted on using it three times in the movie; it would go on to become a perennial standard when Frank Sinatra recorded it in 1956 (Songs for Swingin' Lovers!). \\"This is Always\\", composed by Harry Warren with lyrics by Gordon, was sung by Haver and Ben Gage (singing for Montgomery) in production, but the number did not make the final cut; however, it became a popular ballad the year the film was released, recorded by both Jo Stafford and Dick Haymes. This duet for Haver and Montgomery was set on the beach at night. It was presumably deleted because it had close-ups of Montgomery, who reportedly had demanded a salary increase after production had started. The outtake remains in the trailer (promotion). Apparently a blacklist by studio head Darryl F. Zanuck took effect since Montgomery‚Äôs subsequent films were mostly B movies, starting in 1947 with ‚ÄúThe Brasher Doubloon‚Äù. After that, there were no more Montgomery films produced by 20th Century-Fox. \\"If You Can't Get a Girl in the Summertime\\", playing in the background while Haver and Montgomery dance, was not written for the film but was composed in 1915 by Harry Tierney with lyrics by Bert Kalmar. Several of the main roles were not sung by the actors portraying them. Vera-Ellen's singing voice was dubbed by Carol Stewart, Ben Gage dubbed for George Montgomery, Bob Scott sang for Frank Latimore, and Del Porter for Charles Smith. Release Three Little Girls in Blue premiered at the Apollo Theatre in Atlantic City on September 3, 1946, opened in New York on September 26, and opened across the US in October. It was one of six films to earn over $3 million for Fox in 1946. =Reviews= Bosley Crowther of The New York Times gave the film a reserved but positive review, calling it \\"just a sprightly, happy show\\"; Holm and Vera-Ellen were singled out for praise, as was the score. The industry paper Film Daily also discounted the story but praised the score and the production; this review, too, took note of the performances of Holm and Vera-Ellen.

Completed in 1734, it is built to an unusual octagonal design in Baroque style. It is situated at Frederiksberg Runddel in front of the main entrance to Frederiksberg Gardens, on the corner of Frederiksberg All√© and Pile All√©, History =Earlier churches= Frederiksberg was founded when King Christian III transferred 20 Dutch families from Amager to the area, which became known as Ny Holl√¶nderbyen (\\"New Dutch Town\\"), or Ny Amager (\\"New Dutch Town). The residents of this community constructed a small wooden church in 1653 across the street from the present Frederiksberg Church, roughly where the Storm P. Museum stands today. It was burned down by Swedish troops in 1658 during the Assault on Copenhagen in the Second Northern War. After the war, the Dutch community returned to the area but, struck with deep poverty, a new church was not completed until 1681. After the turn of the century, the area changed dramatically when King Frederick IV built Frederiksberg Palace on a nearby hilltop. The Dutch farmers were forced away from the area which became a fashionable summer destination, from 1710 known as Frederiksberg. =The new church= Frederiksberg Churchm c. 1800 In 1732 it was finally decided to build a new church. The King contributed with 2000 rigsdaler and a piece of land to build it on, and his sister, Princess Sophie Hedevig, donated her entire income from tithe for the year of 1732. The architect Felix Dusart was charged with the design of the new church. He had come to Denmark from the Netherlands after the Copenhagen Fire of 1728 to work on the rebuilding of the city and mainly worked for Philip de Lange. The church was consecrated on 6 January 1734 by Christian Worm, the Bishop of Zealand, at a ceremony attended by King Christian VI and Crown Prince Frederick (V). The old church bells were transferred from the old to the new church but later repaired several times and finally completely replaced, save the smallest bell which has partly been preserved. The rest of the old church was sold in an auction on 23 February for the price of 211 rigsdaler and 84 skilling. Frederiksberg Church in 1864ch In 1736, through a royal resolution, it was decided that the church was to have its own pastor, and the citizens of the Vesterbro suburb were to belong under it. The first pastor was Johannes Kinast (died 1773). Up through the 19th and 20th century the church was adapted and modernized om several occasions. In 1824 the current rectory was built and in 1865 the church was expanded westward with the porch while the two original entrances, one for men and one for women, are blinded. In 1868 the church was transferred from state to municipal ownership and in 1898 it became an independent institution. Architecture The church is built in Dutch Baroque style and to an octagonal design. The slate roof is from 1876 and replaced a tile roof. Interior Furnishings Installed in 1754, the church's first organ had 10 stops and was built by Hartvig Jochum M√ºller. Its first organist was Joachim Conrad Oehlenschl√§ger, father of the poet Adam Oehlenschl√§ger. The current organ, its third, was built in 1947 by Marcussen & S√∏n in √Öbenr√• and has 34 stops, 3 manuals and pedal. The combined altar and pulpit is executed by the sculptor Johan Christopher H√ºbner and carpenter Christian Holfeldt. The altarpiece from 1841 is painted by Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg and depicts the scene from John 17:6-19. According to Dutch reformed tradition it is placed below the pulpit. There are two memorials in the church, both of which were inaugurated on 16 January 1873. One commemorates soldiers fallen in the Second Schleswig War and the other Adam Oehlenschl√§ger. Churchyard Today known as Frederiksberg √Üldre Kirkeg√•rd (en. Frederiksberg Old Cemetery), the churchyard was established at the same time as the church. It soon became too small and was expanded on a number of occasions to keep pace with the constantly growing population of Frederiksberg.

The festival made its US debut in Santa Clara, California on November 25, 2011, and drew nearly 500,000 people by the end of its run in early January 2012. Five more Global Winter Wonderland festivals followed. In 2012 Global Winter Wonderland was held again in Santa Clara, CA. In 2013 it moved to Atlanta, Georgia and in 2014 and 2015 it was held in Sacramento, California. In 2015, ICEG also produced Global Winter Wonderland in Tulare, CA ‚Äì making it the first year to produce two events at exactly the same time. The Global Winter Wonderland Festival is based on the Chinese Lantern Festival. It has distinction of being the largest lantern festival of its kind outside of China. This event enables patrons to ‚ÄúTravel the World in One Night‚Äù by viewing large replicas of the world's most famous landmarks such as India's Taj Mahal, Paris‚Äô Eiffel Tower, Mexico's Chichen Itza, San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge and more! Global Winter Wonderland's magnificent towering lanterns, some of which soar to over 50 feet high and 100 feet long, are built by Chinese engineers with modern technology. These lanterns even reflect the trendy green thinking of today, with their eco- friendly features of low voltage LEDS, fluorescent lights, and solar paneling. These elaborate lantern displays are built by the engineers of several structures showcased in the 2008 Beijing Paralympic Games. They are then shipped to the venue of the event and competed over 6 weeks prior the events start date. History of Lanterns The modern lanterns gracing the night skies of Global Winter Wonderland have a history that tracks back over two thousand years to ancient China. Paper lanterns originated from as far back as the Eastern Han Dynasty (25 AD ‚Äì 220 AD) and were used as lamps, especially in entry ways of homes. The lantern shade was practical in that it protected the flame from being extinguished in windy weather. Lanterns were most often made from paper and silk but could be made from various kinds of materials such as bamboo, wood, wheat-straw and metal. The traditional Chinese lantern is one that is red in color. Chinese monks used lanterns on the twelfth day of the first lunar moon to worship Buddha. During the Eastern Han Dynasty, the Emperor, Liu Zhuang, was a Buddhist and ordered his citizenry to light lanterns to worship Buddha as the monks did. Eventually, this lantern lighting became a grand festival among the common people. During the Tang Dynasty (618 AD ‚Äì 907 AD), lanterns symbolized and celebrated the prosperity, strength and power of China. From then on, lighting lanterns became popular throughout the entire country. Over the years, lanterns became an object of artistic expression, ornamentation and a major status symbol. Common to ancient Chinese society was its fondness for grand celebration, including the Lantern Festival, aka Little New Year, named because it is the culmination of the Chinese New Year festival. The lantern festival was where artisans competed among themselves to produce the most beautifully designed, elaborated and exquisite lantern. The emperor of China himself would hire the best lantern designers to work for him, a position which was considered to be a high honor. Today, lanterns have evolved to become less practical but more as a means of artistic expression. More types of lanterns appear in festivals now than the traditional red Chinese ones. Modern technology is being used to make the lanterns, such as the ones at Global Winter Wonderland. Lanterns can be made with music playing from them, with control panels to make them light up in various ways and times, and so forth. The shapes of modern lanterns have changed over time too. The lanterns can be created into cartoon characters, Chinese zodiac animals and architectural landmarks, such as the ones featured at Global Winter Wonderland.

Retrieved September 16, 2011. The vineyard was founded in the early 1990s by the Kingston Family.  History  Although Kingston Family Vineyards was established in the early 1990s, the land upon which it was built has a much longer history. Founded by the family's patriarch, C.J. Kingston, a copper miner from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, was drawn to Chile in a search for gold in the early 1900s. Unable to find gold, Kingston was left with a simple 7,500 acre farm in the Casablanca Valley of Chile, located between the city of Santiago and the oceanside city of Valparaiso. Since then the ranch has been owned by Kingston descendants who set up a cattle ranch and dairy.San Francisco Chronicle (2007). \\"Chile's Pinot Prospectors\\". Retrieved September 10, 2011. Though still a working cattle farm and dairy, much of the ranch's land has been re-devoted to grape growing as a result of Courtney, Tim, and Michael Kingston who founded the winery. It was Courtney Kingston, the great great granddaughter of CJ Kingston who formulated the idea to plant vineyards on the land and sell the grapes to the wineries in the region while in business school at Stanford University.Connecticut Cottages and Gardens (2011). \\"Liquid Gold\\". Retrieved September 16, 2011. After discovering that the wineries in the region did not know how to work with Pinot noir grapes, they decided to produce the wines themselves. They consulted several winemakers and eventually partnered with Byron Kosuge, a winemaker from California and Evelyn Vidal, an up-and-coming female winemaker from Chile.  Wines  Though Kingston Family Vineyards focuses on red wines, such as Syrah and Pinot noir, it has also makes Sauvignon blanc and Chardonnay. All their wines are named for family horses of years past.

Winemaking  The winemaking process at Kingston is overseen by winemakers Amael Orrego and consulting winemaker Byron Kosuge and they use 15 percent of the vineyards grapes to produce just 5,000 cases a year. To make each wine, individual lots are selected and combined to create 4 different types of wine all single varietal.

It was developed during the encyclopaedia's earliest period as a two-man operation founded by Colin Macfarquhar and Andrew Bell, in Edinburgh, Scotland, and was sold unbound in subscription format over a period of 7 years. Most of the medical and scientific articles, as well as the minor articles, were written by James Tytler. All copperplates were created by Bell. Second edition, Volume 3 Vol 1. A 1778; Vol 2. A-B 1778; Vol 3. C 1778; Vol 4. D-F 1779; Vol 5. G-J 1780; Vol 6. K-L 1780; Vol 7. M-O 1781; Vol 8. O-P 1781; Vol 9. P-S 1782; Vol 10. S-Z 1783, with a 204-page appendix, 1784. The second edition is especially interesting to the American reader, as it was written during the course of the American Revolutionary War. Volume 1 was written when New York City was occupied by the King's army and the course of the war was still quite undecided. Volume 10 was written the year after Cornwallis capitulated and sovereignty was recognized. In the article Colonies, page 2072-2080 Tytler goes into great detail about the British colonies in America and the causes of the revolution, and treats it with an unsympathetic yet neutral, scholarly viewpoint. Volumes written early, such as volume 2 in the article Boston, where mention is made of \\"the present American war,\\" and volume 4 in the article New England Scans of \\"Boston\\" and \\"New England\\" articles. (under E for England), have these places described as British colonies. In volume 10, written at the end of the war, the article Virginia describes it as \\"Late one of the British colonies, now one of the United States of North America.\\" Later in that same volume, in the article New York (listed under Y for York), the correctly named \\"United States of America\\" is mentioned. Scans of \\"Virginia\\" and \\"York\\" articles. Map of the world in Geography article Map of North America in Geography article After the success of the first edition, the second was a more ambitious project, with the addition of history and biography articles. Smellie, editor of the first edition, declined the job for the second, principally because he objected to the addition of biography. Macfarquhar took over the role himself, aided by pharmacist James Tytler, M.A.,The degree of M.A. is found after his name in the 11th edition of Britannica in the article \\"Encyclopedia\\", vol. 9., p. 378 who was known as an able writer and willing to work for a very low wage. Macfarquhar and Bell rescued Tytler from Holyrood Palace, a debtors' prison, and employed him for seven years at 17 shillings per week. Tytler was a polymath, educated by his father in classic languages and theology, and at Edinburgh in medicine, surgery, pharmacy, and chemistry. He wrote many science and history articles and almost all of the minor articles; by Robert Burns' estimate, Tytler wrote over three-quarters of the second edition. On subjects in which he was not expert, he would copy and paste from contemporary sources. For example, on articles related to Law, such as Corporation, he took large sections of text from William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England. In compiling the many biographical articles, he borrowed heavily from Biographia Britannica and other sources, often copying word-for-word. His experience and livelihood in surgery and pharmacy led to his authoring unusually long articles in those fields, as well as related subjects such as chemistry and medicine, but he also wrote long articles for, \\"Electricity\\" and \\"Optics,\\" which were outside his field. He was a gifted writer, being in charge of editing the copy and galleys himself, and helping typeset in the printing room. He would sometimes write without using any sort of manuscript, simply setting type as he wrote. In fact, Burns described him as being a printer by trade. Others contributed to the second edition as well. In the Supplement to the 3rd edition, published in 1803, the following quote appears in the article Dr. Thomas Blacklock: List of the main symbols used in chemistry before the periodic table was invented. From article \\"Chemistry\\" written by James Tytler. Compared to the 1st edition, the second had five times as many long articles (150), including \\"Scotland\\" (84 pages), \\"Optics\\" (132 pages), and \\"Medicine\\" (309 pages), the last two of which had their own indices. It was published in 181 numbers from 21 June 1777 to 18 September 1784; these numbers were bound into ten volumes dated 1778‚Äì1783, having 8,595 pages and 340 plates, again engraved by Andrew Bell. A pagination error caused page 8000 to follow page 7099. Eighteen maps are found in the \\"Geography\\" article. Other maps are found under \\"South Sea,\\" \\"Wind,\\" and The second edition improved greatly upon the 1st, but is still notable for the large amount of archaic information it contains. For example, \\"Chemistry\\" goes into great detail on an obsolete system of what would now be called alchemy, in which earth, air, water and fire are named elements containing various amounts of phlogiston. Tytler also describes the architecture of Noah's Ark in detail (illustrated with a copperplate engraving) and, following Bishop Ussher, includes a remarkably precise chronology for the Earth, beginning with its creation on 23 October 4004 B.C. and noting that the Great Flood of 2348 B.C. lasted for exactly 777 days. The 2nd edition also reports a cure for tuberculosis: and a somewhat melancholy article on \\"Love\\" that persisted in the Britannica for nearly a century (until its 9th edition): \\"Timeline\\" by Adam Ferguson that accompanied his \\"History‚Äù article. In the second edition, the article \\"History\\" was written by Adam Ferguson and/or Tytler. Folded into the article there is a plate, colored by hand, showing a timeline of history. It begins at the flood of Noah and numbers the years from the creation of the world, giving the birth of Christ the year 4004, and it includes timelines for different regions of the world. Ferguson explains the chart at the bottom. Like the first edition, the second was sold in sections by subscription at the printing shop of Colin MacFarquhar. When finished in 1784, remaining numbers were collected and sold as complete sets by book wholesaler Charles Elliot as his bookshop in Edinburgh for 10 pounds, unbound, and the second edition was enough of a financial success that a more ambitious third edition was begun a few years later. Tytler's efforts for the article \\"Brewing\\" (of beer) were so substantial that it remained unchanged until the 7th edition (1842), carried over from the 6th edition's Supplement. Sales figures for the second edition are not known precisely. Kerr, biographer of the first edition's editor William Smellie, estimated that only 1,500 copies had been produced. But Edinburgh book wholesaler Charles Elliot sold 1,500 sets alone in less than a year. On the other hand, Archibald Constable, who bought Britannica in 1812 and had been distributing them since 1788, wrote that 4,500 copies had been made. A 204-page supplement to the second edition, called the Appendix, was written in 1784 and is bound at the end of Vol. 10. It does not have its own title page, but merely follows, with pagination continuing from 8996 to 9200. The supplement introduces articles on Entomology, Ichthyology, Weather, Hindus (spelled Gentoos), and others, and contains many new biographies, including one of Captain James Cook. It curiously contains 25 new pages on Air, which give very little new information about air itself, but mainly cover hot air ballooning, one of Tytler's hobbies. The first page of the supplement begins with the words \\"Appendix containing articles omitted and others further explained or improved, together with corrections of errors and of wrong references.\\" The supplement also includes 10 plates, namely CCCXIV to CCCXXIII. Volume 10 is therefore much thicker that the others, and contains over 1100 pages, the other 9 volumes having 800 each.

Its location at Charing Cross is on the former site of the most elaborate of the Eleanor crosses erected by Edward I, which had stood for three and a half centuries until 1647. Charing Cross is used to define the centre of London and a plaque by the statue indicates that road signage distances are measured from this point. The statue faces down Whitehall towards Charles I's place of execution at Banqueting House. The first Renaissance-style equestrian statue in England, it was commissioned by Charles's Lord High Treasurer Richard Weston for the garden of his country house in Roehampton, Surrey (now in South London). Following the English Civil War the statue was sold to a metalsmith to be broken down, but he hid it until the Restoration. It was installed in its current, far more prominent location in the centre of London in 1675, and the elaborately carved plinth dates from that time. Description The statue shows Charles I of England on horseback, with the king wearing a demi-suit of armour but without a helmet. Across the chest is a scarf tied into a bow on the right shoulder. The king is holding a baton in his right hand, and the reins of the horse in his left. History The statue was commissioned by Weston in January 1630. The contract, in French with an English translation, is thought to have been drafted by the architect Balthazar Gerbier, who was then building Putney Park, Weston's country house in Roehampton. The statue was to be finished in 18 months but its execution was delayed; the date 1633 inscribed on the horse's left forefoot is probably when the work was cast. After the Parliamentary victory in the English Civil War the statue was sold to a metalsmith in the Holborn area by the name of John Rivet. Rivet received instructions from Parliament to break down the statue, but instead he hid it on his premises. He produced some broken pieces of brass as evidence that he had followed his instructions, and for some time sold brass-handled cutlery to both Royalists and Parliamentarians, which he claimed was made from the remains of the statue. The plaque added to the base after the Second World War After the Restoration, the statue was found by Jerome Weston, 2nd Earl of Portland and, following a complaint to the House of Lords, it was decreed \\"That the said John Rivett shall permit and suffer the Sheriff of London to serve a replevin upon the said Statue and Horse of Brass, that are now in his Custody.\\" It was purchased by the King and in 1675 was placed in its current location. The pedestal itself is made of Portland stone with a carved coat of arms; the work was completed by Joshua Marshall, who was mason to Charles II. On 28 October 1844, during the visit of Queen Victoria to open the Royal Exchange, the sword and the badge of the Order of the Garter were stolen. During the Second World War the statue was removed by the Ministry of Works for protection, and was stored at Mentmore Park, Leighton Buzzard. Before being returned to its plinth in Whitehall, the Ministry carried out some repairs on the statue, including adding a replacement sword and the badge of the Order of the Garter. Additionally, a bronze tablet was added to the base of the plinth, explaining the addition of the replacement items. In late 1892, the Legitimist Jacobite League of Great Britain and Ireland, led by Herbert Vivian, applied to the government for permission to lay wreaths at the statue, on the anniversary of Charles I's execution. Permission was refused by Prime Minister Gladstone, and George Shaw-Lefevre, Vivian's onetime travelling companion and now the First Commissioner of Works, enforced the order. The League attempted to lay their wreaths anyway on 30 January 1893. Police were dispatched to stop the League and after a confrontation, Vivian and other League members were allowed to complete their ceremony. Press coverage generally mocked the League for their actions. In 1977, the plinth was cleaned for the first time in three centuries. The work was conducted by the Department of the Environment and the department of conservation at the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Oil on canvas, Columbus Museum of Art. William Preston Dickinson (September 9, 1889 - November 25, 1930) was an American modern artist, best known for his paintings of industrial subjects in the Precisionist style. Biography William Preston Dickinson was born on September 9, 1889 in New York City,. a third-generation American in a working- class family.. His father was an amateur painter who made a living as a calligrapher and interior decorator;. he died when Preston was only eleven years old. By 1906, his family had relocated to Suffern, New York. Dickinson studied between 1906 and 1910 at the Art Students League of New York under William Merritt Chase, as well as under Ernest Lawson. His tuition at the art school was paid by philanthropist and art patron Henry Barbey. Barbey and art dealer Charles Daniel also financed Dickinson's trip to Europe. From 1910 to 1914, he lived in Paris, where he studied at the Acad√©mie Julian and √âcole des Beaux-Arts, and exhibited his work at the Paris Salon and the Salon des Ind√©pendants. After the start of World War I, Dickinson returned to the U.S. in September 1914. Lacking resources, he moved in with his mother, widowed sister and her son in the Bronx. He shortly participated in several group exhibitions at the Daniel Gallery, ultimately receiving his first solo gallery show there in 1923. He spent the summer of 1924 in Omaha, Nebraska, where he produced a series of drawings of the Peters Mills granaries and factory complex. He lived in Quebec from 1925 to 1926, where he painted landscapes and street scenes. By the end of the 1920s, he had established a reputation as an important American modernist and his works had entered public and private collections. In June 1930, Dickinson moved to Spain with friend and fellow painter Oronzo Gasparo, looking for a cheap place to live and paint. Dickinson's money ran out by that autumn, but before he could leave Spain he was hospitalized with double pneumonia. He died three days later, on November 25, 1930, in Irun, Spain, and was buried there. He had long been in poor health, suffering from alcoholism among other conditions. Dickinson posthumously received his first solo museum show, staged at The Phillips Collection in 1931 by its founder and director Duncan Phillips, who had admired Dickinson's work. Work Dickinson was one of the first American artists to focus on industrial subjects. He was working in the Precisionist mode by at least 1915, and his depictions of factories and granaries predate those of fellow Precisionists Charles Sheeler and Charles Demuth.. Dickinson was motivated by a reverence for the benefits of technology and industry to humanity, as well as an interest in its formal qualities. Many of his industrial scenes were imaginary (such as Factory (c. 1920), pictured at right), though his work later shifted towards a greater realism. Dickinson also produced many landscapes, depicting the Harlem River at many times during his life, though he was most interested in the cut-stone architecture that lined and crossed the river. He painted numerous still lifes of man-made objects, with table-top settings depicting \\"simple dining\\" being a recurring theme. Experimenting with a variety of techniques and styles, his work showed influence from a number of avant-garde art movements, such as Cubism, Futurism, Fauvism, and Synchromism. His use of color was expressive, showing his influence by the Post-Impressionists and Fauves. His later work, though superficially in a Precisionist style, utilizes off-balance, expressionistic compositions with jagged diagonals.. Some of his work in the 1920s was also observed by critics as having an Oriental influence, believed to derive from his studies of Japanese ukiyo-e art. Dickinson produced fewer than two hundred works during his twenty-year career. He usually did not sign or date his works, which together with his stylistic experimentation makes it difficult to place them in a chronology. References Further reading *. *. *.

Early life George Steptoe Washington was born August 17, 1771 at Harewood, his father's plantation in Berkeley County, Virginia (now Jefferson County in West Virginia) the fourth of seven children (but the eldest surviving son) born to Samuel Washington and his fourth wife, Anne Steptoe. George Steptoe Washington was named for his uncle, President George Washington, while his middle name came from that of his mother's family. George had four brothers and two sisters (as well as several half-brothers and sisters): Ferdinand Washington (1767‚Äì1788), Frederick Augustus Washington (1768‚Äì1769), Lucinda Washington (1769‚Äì1770), Lawrence Augustine Washington (1774‚Äì1824), Harriet Washington (1776‚Äì1822), and Thomas Washington (1778‚Äì1838). After his father's death, he, along with brother Lawrence Augustine and sister Harriet, went to live with their uncle George Washington for a time. The future president paid for him and his brother to be educated at Georgetown academy, where according to historian Ron Chernow, \\"they were wild and uncontrollable and a constant trial to Washington\\". Master of Harewood After his father's death in 1781, George would eventually inherit the plantation of Harewood, as well as other properties in what is now West Virginia. While, for a time, he would study law in Philadelphia with Edmund Randolph, the young George Steptoe Washington would serve as his uncle's secretary. The younger Washington was a source of some worry and much expense to his uncle (who supported him and his younger brother Lawrence, and paid for their education), who sent letters of encouragement and, occasionally of reproof.\\"I think it incumbent on me as your uncle and friend, to give you some advisory hints, which, if properly attended to, will, I conceive, be found very useful to you in regulating your conduct and giving you respectability, not only at present, but thro‚Äô every period of life.

George Washington to George Steptoe Washington, March 23, 1789, Mt. Vernon, Va., as found at http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=350 Washington was actively involved in the operation of his Harewood plantation, and bought and sold a number of parcels of land in Virginia and elsewhere. He also served in the militia, rising to the rank of Major. Personal life While in Philadelphia in 1793, George, who was twenty-two years of age, eloped with Lucy Anne Payne (1769‚Äì1846), a sister of future First Lady Dolley Madison. Lucy was only fifteen, and a member of the Society of Friends, who disowned her because of her marriage. The families reconciled, and later Lucy's mother Mary Coles Payne would bring the younger Payne children to Harewood to live with the Washingtons. The parlor of Harewood was the site of the marriage of James Madison and Dolley Payne Todd in 1794.Washington, John Augustine (Washington Family Historian), \\"The Washingtons of Jefferson County\\", August 3, 2001, as found at http://biztechsource.com/justjefferson.com/09jaw.htm Together, George and Lucy had four children: * George Steptoe Washington (1796‚Äì1796), who died in infancy. * Samuel Walter Washington (1797‚Äì1831), a medical doctor who married Louisa Clemson (b. 1805) and had three daughters. * William Temple Washington (1800‚Äì1877), who married Margaret Calhoun Fletcher (1805‚Äì1865) and had issue. * George Steptoe Washington, Jr. (1806‚Äì1831), who married Gabriella Augusta Hawkins and no children. On January 10, 1809, George Steptoe Washington died of consumption at the age of thirty-seven in Augusta, Georgia, where he had gone to establish another plantation. His widow subsequently married Judge Thomas Todd, who was an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Their wedding was the first ever to be held in the White House. Todd died in 1826, and Lucy died at the age of 74 in 1846. =Descendants= Through his son Samuel, he was the grandfather of Lucy Elizabeth Washington (b. 1823), who married John Bainbridge Packett (1817‚Äì1872) and had issue; Christian Maria Washington (1826‚Äì1895), who married Richard Blackburn Washington (1822‚Äì1910), a relative of hers and had issue; Annie S.C. Washington (1831‚Äì1911), who married Thomas Augustus Brown and had issue including Forrest Washington Brown (1855‚Äì1934), who married Emma Beverly Tucker. Richard Blackburn Washington was the great-grandson of John Augustine Washington who was a younger brother of George and Samuel Washington and the uncle of George Steptoe Washington. Richard B. Washington was therefore Christian's third cousin. After his father (John Augustine Washington II)'s death in 1832, Richard inherited the plantation of Blakeley in Jefferson County, West Virginia, but, in 1875, would sell Blakeley and move to Harewood.\\"National Register Information System\\".

Overview of works Kim specializes in writing and teaching constructive theology, feminist theology, post-colonial theology, and Asian-American theology. Her first book, The Grace of Sophia, deals with the suffering in patriarchal Korean (Confucian and Christian) families and the way in which the ancient Hebrew notion of female Wisdom, Sophia, can liberate patriarchal Christology. Her second book, The Holy Spirit, Chi, and the Other celebrates the sense in which the Chinese / Korean / Japanese notion of Chi can add substance to our understanding of the Holy Spirit and unite spiritual ideas in Christianity with those in Confucianism, Hinduism, Taoism, and Buddhism. She has contributed to more than eleven other books on several contextual theological themes, and has contributed numerous papers and symposia participations on these subjects. She is currently working on 1 & 2 Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah, in Belief: A Theological Commentary on the Bible, part of a series by Westminster John Knox Press on the theological importance of these books for the church today.

The square is part of the Yerevan Opera Theater complex, located just to the south of the main opera building, between the opera park and the Swan lake. Along with the Republic Square, the Freedom Square is one of the two main squares in central Yerevan. It is bordered with four streets: Tumanyan Street, Teryan Street, Sayat Nova Avenue and Mashtots Avenue. The statues of writer Hovhannes Tumanyan and composer Alexander Spendiaryan are located in the square. In politics Due to a tradition of demonstrations at the square, it has been described as a \\"symbol of democracy\\" in Armenia. The square can hold an estimated 40,000, 42,000‚Äì45,000 to 50,000 people. =1988: Karabakh movement= The semi-circular square is known for its prominent role in modern history of Armenia. Since the Karabakh movement in February 1988, the Freedom Square has become a center of popular demonstrations. To suppress the demonstrations the square was closed down several times within 1988 by Soviet police and military forces. =Post- election protests= After Armenia's independence in 1991 the square has been the main location of anti-government rallies, especially following presidential elections in 1996, 2003, 2008, and 2013. In the aftermath of the disputed 2008 presidential election, thousands of supporters of opposition leader and Armenia's first president Levon Ter-Petrosyan gathered in the square and began sit-ins. In the early morning of March 1, 2008 these peaceful protests were violently dispersed by the police and the square was closed down for civilians. For around 20 days, the square remained under occupation by police and armed forces to enforce the state of emergency. Subsequently, it was closed down for rallies for over three years, until March 17, 2011 when Ter-Petrosyan's Armenian National Congress staged a large rally. Underground parking lot On August 28, 2008 the Armenian government made a decision to start a construction of an underground parking lot beneath the square to relieve the surrounding streets where parked cars often complicate the traffic. The opposition claimed the decision was intended to prevent demonstration there, although the government denied these allegations. The three-storey parking lot for up to 500 cars was opened on May 24, 2010 in attendance of Mayor Gagik Beglaryan and President Serzh Sargsyan. The project cost about $10.5 million.

He is best known for the feature film drama What Alice Found, a Sundance Award-winner and New York Times \\"Critic's Pick.\\"  Biography  Bell grew up in Rochester, New York. He earned a BFA with Honors in Film from the Conservatory of Theater Arts and Film, School of the Arts at SUNY Purchase College. His 30-minute thesis film \\"I'm Only There...\\" starred classmate and future Oscar-winner Melissa Leo. The Melbourne Australia Film Festival called it a \\"brilliantly black comic look at suburban teenage malaise.\\" The film was recognized by festivals around the world and premiered on the WNYC-PBS series \\"Independent Focus.\\" Post-college, Bell's first job was as picture apprentice on the Woody Allen film \\"Broadway Danny Rose.\\" During this time he optioned screenplays to Ralph Bakshi (Fritz the Cat, Heavy Traffic) and producers Kimberly Myers and Mary Salter. He made the switch to writing and directing with the newly formed HA! channel which later became Comedy Central. On the program \\"Afterdrive\\" he directed short remote sketches with the show's co-host comedian/actor Denis Leary. Bell got his first chance to write and direct a feature film \\"BackFire!\\" (1994) for New York's \\"Corman-esque\\" low-budget film producer Chris Ingvordson. This low-brow spoof comedy, written and produced within six months, boasts an all-star cast including Robert Mitchum, Shelley Winters, Telly Savalas and Kathy Ireland. It also featured then unknowns ‚Äî Purchase schoolmate Edie Falco (\\"Nurse Jackie\\"), Kirsten Johnston (\\"Third Rock\\") and Mary McCormack (\\"Private Parts\\"). \\"BackFire!\\" aired frequently on USA Network's \\"Up All Night\\" and Comedy Central. Bell then began writing, directing and executive producing the television series \\"SportsFigures\\" for ESPN. The commercial-free program explained physics to teenage audiences using sports as the example.

Critically acclaimed, \\"What Alice Found\\" was praised by Kevin Thomas in the Los Angeles Times: \\"Sweet, suspenseful, funny, poignant and adult. Judith Ivey gives flat-out one of the year's best performances... a terrific showcase for lovely newcomer Emily Grace...an unexpected treat for sophisticated audiences.\\" \\"A. Dean Bell‚Äôs What Alice Found, qualifies as the latest example of an independent film of limited means and unlimited artistry,\\" wrote Andrew Sarris in the New York Observer. The film stars two-time Tony winner Judith Ivey, whom Variety picked as a dark horse Oscar candidate for her role as Sandra. Alongside Ivey are veteran actor Bill Raymond and newcomer Emily Grace as Alice. Bell worked again with Ivey, directing the dramatic sections of the documentary \\"Sweet Tornado: Margo Jones and the American Theater\\", produced by Kay Cattarulla and Robert Tranchin for KERA-PBS. Ms. Ivey played American theater director/entrepreneur Margo Jones opposite Richard Thomas as Tennessee Williams with Marcia Gay Harden narrating. The hour-long film aired on PBS affiliates nationwide. Bell was then commissioned by Fox Broadcasting to develop an original night time drama- comedy, \\"Stepdude.\\" A short sample of the pilot episode was produced with Bell directing.

It is widely taught in Japanese nursery schools and kindergartens as a simple melody; it is also sometimes used in elementary school moral education courses, where students learn that it is a meditation on the death of a child. Noguchi's daughter Midori died at the age of just 7 days in 1908. In the Meiji period, the infant mortality rate was quite high and 20 to 30 percent of children died before reaching schooling age. It was common to have many children to aim for success of the household, but Noguchi was divorced, and he thus mourned the loss of his only child for a long time. It is widely believed that Noguchi, seeing the girls in his village play with bubbles, was reminded of the brief existence of his daughter, and wrote this poem on that occasion. However, other than the above facts, the direct inspiration for the song is unknown. The tune is a modification of the Christian hymn \\"Jesus Loves Me, This I Know\\".

Since its formation in 2011, the key focus of STV Appeal has been the alleviation of child poverty in Scotland. The STV Children‚Äôs Appeal seeks to address long-term, sustainable change in the lives of those children most at risk by tackling the root causes as well as the effects of poverty and disadvantage. To help achieve this objective, they engage with corporate bodies, community groups, local businesses, schools, local and central government and the general public. STV has played a key role in engaging with these parties through the utilisation of its on-air and online platforms in order to stimulate public debate on issues relating to child poverty. Since 2011, over ¬£21m has been raised - every penny of which has gone to help children and young people in Scotland. 1,344 funding awards have been made to children's and young people's projects across Scotland. Over 95,000 children and young people have benefited and in each of Scotland's 32 local authority areas. The charity's costs are met by parent company STV plc and The Hunter Foundation meaning every penny raised goes to the front line. In 2020, the coronavirus pandemic has meant that children and young people living in poverty have been pushed into deeper poverty.

School hygiene or school hygiene education is a healthcare science, a form of the wider school health education. School hygiene is a study of school environment influence; it explores the impact of schooling to mental and physical health of students. The primary aims of school hygiene education is to improve behavior through useful practices connected to personal, water, food, domestic and public hygiene. Also, it aims to protect water and food supplies and to safely manage environmental factors.  History of school hygiene  School hygiene expert Fletcher B. Dresslar explained in his 1915 work School Hygiene that ‚ÄúSchool Hygiene is the branch of this science [hygiene] which has to do with the conservation and development of the health of school children.‚Äù The school was looked upon as existing ‚Äúnot only for the welfare of each child in attendance, but also for the welfare of the state and the nation.‚Äù Dresslar broke school hygiene up into two essential parts: ‚Äúthe physical environment of the child during his school life‚Äù and ‚Äúthe laws of mental hygiene as illustrated by the proper adjustment of the subjects of the curriculum to the mental powers and needs of the children.‚Äù School hygiene as a major discipline was at its zenith in the United States and England in the late 19th and early 20th century, with major works of the subject being offered by various authors, among them Sir Arthur Newsholme, Edward R. Shaw, Robert A. Lyster, and G.G. Groff. After this time period, the school hygiene discipline became part of a comprehensive look at school health education; the American School Hygiene Association became inactive, and the American School Health Association was founded. Exclusive focus on hygiene was no longer prominent. School hygiene still appears to be an active, separate discipline in other parts of the world, like Eastern Europe and developing countries where school sanitation norms are not as well established.  School environment  Secondary school main building in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, England. Schools can determine children's health and well-being by their exposure to a healthy or unhealthy school environment. There are lot of architectural and aesthetic aspects related to a school's hygienic needs, such as: school's building plan, safe water supply, disposition of waste, emergency lighting, heating and ventilation, as well as adequate school facilities (halls, classrooms, and common areas) and furniture. = School location = Due to health reasons (influence of noise, exhaust gases from vehicles, and potential risk of accident), schools in an urban and suburban areas should be located more than 100 meters away from major traffic and causeways. Some studies suggest it is best to orient and design a school building so that natural light can be a part of the lighting scheme of the school, and that buildings should avoid being placed in a valley, due to air quality issues.  Importance of school hygiene  Schools have a central place in the health of a community. Inappropriate hygiene in schools can cause many diseases. If there are no school sanitation and hygiene facilities, or if they aren't maintained and used adequately, schools become places where diseases are likely transmitted.

His abduction led to an eight-year investigation involving various suspects, until an undercover police sting in August 2011 revealed Cowan as the perpetrator. He was charged with the murder that same month and Morcombe's remains were discovered days later on 17 August. Cowan was sentenced to life imprisonment, (being eligible for parole in 2031) on 13 March 2014 in a trial that attracted worldwide attention. Cowan had two previous convictions for sexually abusing children, the earliest dating back to 1987. The investigation into Morcombe's disappearance became Queensland's highest profile crime case in the state's history. Early life and background Cowan was born on 18 September 1969 in Bunbury, Western Australia, to Marlene, a homemaker and RSL worker, and Peter Cowan, an Australian Army Major and Vietnam veteran. He was the third of four boys. The Cowans led a strict household and gave their children a Catholic upbringing, and were, by many accounts, a \\"good family\\". Further, Cowan's father was often absent due to his Army responsibilities, and suffered from PTSD. In the early 1970s, the family relocated to Brisbane, Queensland, eventually settling in the suburb of Everton Park. Cowan and his three brothers attended Marcellin College, now known as Mt Maria College, an independent Catholic high school in Mitchelton in northside Brisbane. Cowan's year nine English teacher claimed Cowan was somewhat of a \\"bully\\" who taunted other students, would proudly parade around his erections and was \\"despised by his peers\\". Conversely, other students at his school reflected on him as being an \\"ordinary guy\\" with few hobbies or social interests who \\"seemed alright\\". Cowan was also bullied in school and dropped out in year ten and began working odd jobs throughout his late teens, never holding down employment in one position for longer than a few months. Cowan also struggled to come to terms with his bisexuality. He also proved difficult for his mother: he was a \\"handful\\" as a child and progressed into a difficult teenager, occasionally stealing from her. His problems escalated as he became involved in petty crime and his first criminal conviction came at the age of 17. By that time he regularly used LSD, cocaine and methamphetamines. He later stated of his drug use: \\"They do fuck your inhibitions up ‚Ä¶ you know, your boundaries.\\"  Criminal history  = Early convictions = Cowan's theft and drug offences with the law had resulted in him performing community service duties at a public park in Brisbane. On 5 December 1987, during one of these community service sessions, an 18-year-old Cowan took a 7-year-old child from the park into a toilet cubicle and raped him. Cowan's demeanour subsequent to the attack was casual, as he proceeded to watch television inside the childcare centre where he was performing maintenance duties. Cowan had been sentenced to two years jail in 1989, but only served half of that sentence. In September 1993, while living at a Darwin caravan park with his then 18-year-old girlfriend Tracey Haneveld, Cowan lured a 6-year-old boy into an abandoned car yard and raped him. The boy was left in an abandoned car in the bush, with a punctured lung due to the force of the act and several cuts. He stumbled into a petrol station, dazed and distraught, and the police were called immediately‚Äîthey initially assumed the boy had been hit by a car because of the extent of his injuries. Cowan initially denied his involvement, even going to considerable length to portray his innocence by stating to the police, \\"I hope you catch the bastard\\". However, the officers quickly discovered that Cowan was the only man in the caravan park not to offer up a DNA sample after semen was found on the boy's discarded underwear. A background check conducted by the officers also revealed his former molestation conviction in 1987. Police contacted him once again with the evidence, and he quickly confessed to the rape. Cowan was sentenced in 1994 in the Northern Territory Supreme Court to serve seven years in jail for various charges: grievous harm, deprivation of liberty and gross indecency; however, more severe charges, such as attempted murder, were dropped prior to the trial. He was then only required to serve 3.5 years. Psychological assessments followed, and Cowan was deemed as a pathological liar who lived a \\"parasitic existence\\", relying mostly on his parents to support his living. The psychologist also discovered a gross lack of awareness on behalf of Cowan, who believed that his victim \\"would not report the case\\" because he \\"probably enjoyed\\" the experience. Haneveld confronted Cowan in prison and asked if he was involved. He did not respond, and as his guilt became clear to her, she left the prison distraught. This was her last contact with Cowan. Haneveld spoke to 60 Minutes in March 2014, prior to his sentence, about her relationship with him, which she claimed was full of infidelity on his behalf. During the trial, Cowan stated to the sentencing judge that \\"years of heavy poly drug use\\" was an explanation for his assault history. > \\"Cowan's behavior began to deteriorate at home [with his uncle and aunt], > particularly after he had his own vehicle. While still on parole, he was > staying out late and going out at unusual times of night, using the excuse > of catching up with mates or going fishing. \\"'After addressing him over some > personal issues that were of great concern to us, including lying, our > relationship began to become strained and eventually he moved out to his own > flat and the rest is history.'\\" > -Cowan's uncle, who provided him rehabilitation and a home for a period of > time in 1998 Following his release from jail in 1997, Cowan protested his desire for rehabilitation and recognised that his sexual deviancy was a problem. He was ordered to attend a sexual offenders treatment program and moved in with his pastor aunt and uncle, Jenny and Keith Philbrook, on the Sunshine Coast, becoming a reformed Christian. In 1998, 29-year-old Cowan moved into the suburb of Beerwah with Tracey Lee Moncrieff, another churchgoer. The two were married the following year and had two children. Cowan regularly attended church services and no criminal convictions were reported from this time up until 2003. During that year Cowan also stopped attending church and the couple divorced in 2004. Cowan had signed up to a number of gay dating websites, including Gaydar and Manhunt. He was using one of these profiles from Perth just before his arrest under fake names. The Sunday Mail discovered the profile, under a variation of the name \\"Shaddo N‚Äôunyah Hunter\\". Cowan sought out a long list of extreme sex acts and said he was open to meeting anyone up to the age of around mid-50s. =Disappearance of Daniel Morcombe= On 7 December 2003, 13-year-old schoolboy Daniel Morcombe left his home and planned to catch the 1:35 pm bus to the Sunshine Plaza Shopping Centre for a haircut and to buy Christmas presents for his family, but he failed to return. A bus had broken down on the side of the road and a replacement bus was later sent to pick up the passengers of the broken down bus. However, this replacement bus drove past Daniel and shortly after, in just a three-minute time span, Cowan is believed to have abducted him. Cowan was living in the town of Beerwah around the time of Morcombe's disappearance. He was approached by police because of his criminal history and his proximity to the area in which Morcombe was last seen. Just days after the disappearance, however, he denied his involvement. A former police officer involved believed Cowan to be involved from just one encounter: he stated that \\"Look, if he's not good for that, he's good for something. I left with the distinct impression of guilt.\\" A police interview with Cowan was conducted in July 2005 in the Gold Coast. Detective Tracey Barnes, who handled the interview, asked Cowan if he would admit to being involved and he responded with \\"probably not\\". Over the following years, the case shifted from Cowan to convicted sex offender Douglas Jackway. Witnesses reported seeing a blue vehicle near the location of Morcombe's disappearance and Jackway had a vehicle that very closely matched witness descriptions. Cowan was brought before the Daniel Morcombe coronial inquest six years later, where he was referred to as P7. Cowan stated he had driven along the road where Morcombe was last seen, but he was only travelling along there to pick up a mulcher. He also provided this as an alibi for the missing time, and said he had visited his cannabis dealer during the time Daniel was supposedly taken. Further police investigation revealed that Cowan's dealers were not home during the time Morcombe disappeared, meaning that Cowan could not have been with them. However, despite an unreliable alibi, police had no real forensic evidence to charge Cowan with the abduction and murder of the teenager. During this time, Cowan changed his name to Shaddo N-unyah Hunter, possibly to evade police. He later remarked that 'Shaddo' was his dog's name and 'N-unyah' a euphemism which translates to the idiom \\"none of your business\\". Moncrieff, Cowan's wife at the time, later admitted in court that she lied about her husband's whereabouts on the day of Morcombe's disappearance because she was \\"blinded by love\\". After their divorce, she revealed in court that he was gone for up to five hours that day. =Police sting= A covert police operation that was used in Canada drew the attention of an investigator involved in Morcombe's case. The procedure, known as Mr. Big, involves police officers who pose as members of a corrupt criminal gang to gain the confidence of the alleged suspect, enlisting the suspect's participation in an escalating series of often elaborate fictional crimes, particularly theft, prostitution and the drug trade. Once the suspect's trust has been gained, the police persuade the suspect to confess to the earlier, real crime. An undercover police officer, posing as a crime boss known as \\"Paul Fitzsimmons\\" or \\"Fitzy\\", befriended Cowan on a flight to Perth in April 2011. Fitzsimmons gained the trust of Cowan and the two became friends. Due to the absence of any physical evidence, a confession of Cowan was needed. Over the following months, Cowan's gang of friends initiated him through an array of fake criminal scenarios, unknown to Cowan. The gang offered Cowan a subpoena for his alibi in Morcombe's case; however, he denied any involvement. In August 2011, at an interview at the Perth Hyatt Hotel, an undercover officer gained Cowan's trust, and apprised that he \\"only wanted to help Cowan\\", re-instating that Cowan could trust him with anything. He subsequently disclosed his involvement in Morcombe's abduction and the confession was captured on video. Over the next few days, Cowan led the undercover police officers to the site of Morcombe's remains. At the site, several undercover police officers arrested Cowan. On 13 August 2011, Cowan was taken into custody and charged with Morcombe's murder and other offences, including child stealing, deprivation of liberty, indecent treatment of a child under 16, and interfering with a corpse. In 2006, Cowan had admitted to police that he travelled the road from which Morcombe disappeared on the same day of his disappearance, on his way to purchase marijuana from a drug dealer. Around this time, a white Mitsubishi Pajero was seized from a property on Russell Island. The vehicle was believed to have been involved in Morcombe's abduction after a witness at the coronial inquest in April 2011 reported seeing a vehicle of similar description parked north of the site where Morcombe was last seen. Trial Supreme and District Court of Queensland in 2014. On 7 February 2013, Cowan was ordered to stand trial. He was charged with murder, indecently dealing with a child under the age of 16 and improperly dealing with a corpse. The trial, at the Supreme Court of Queensland in the state's capital Brisbane, began on 10 February 2014 under Justice Roslyn Atkinson. Cowan stated he only confessed because of the lucrative money deal that was offered to him. Moreover, the undercover policeman posing as 'Arnold' agreed that the fake crime gang had \\"dangled a carrot in the form of big money in front of Cowan\\". The prosecution closed its case on 7 March. 116 witnesses gave evidence and over 200 exhibits were tendered in evidence. Cowan pleaded not guilty and declined to give evidence. Bruce and Denise Morcombe, as well as Daniel's brothers, gave lengthy victim impact statements. Cowan reportedly stated he had no remorse. On 13 March 2014, Cowan was found guilty of all charges. Cowan had two previous convictions for child sex offences. On 14 March 2014, Cowan was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 20 years. He was also sentenced to three-and-a-half years' imprisonment for indecently dealing with Morcombe and two years for interfering with his corpse, those sentences to be served concurrently. Judge Roslyn Atkinson said \\"I don't think you should be released in 20 years time\\" which could affect Cowan's prison term. Pathology Cowan has undergone multiple psychiatric examinations since his first offences in the late 1980s and early 90s. The psychologist who had assessed him after his second molestation conviction in 1993 claimed he was a pathological liar with low level psychopathic features or mild psychopathy indicating a severe lack of empathy. Despite this, a concrete psychiatric diagnosis on him has been elusive and inconclusive. Acquaintances of Cowan, particularly his ex- girlfriends, had described him as seeming \\"charming\\", \\"confident\\" and \\"handsome\\" initially, which made it easy for him to gain the trust of his victims. The judge of the trial remarked to Cowan that he \\"did not look like a monster or a pedophile, he looked like an ordinary person\\". Furthermore, she remarked that he was a \\"convincing and adaptable liar\\". In a psychologist's report compiled in 2007, Cowan stated: \\"I always worry, if things got bad, I could offend again. I could never do this against my own flesh and blood.\\" He has also expressed his belief that years of habitual drug use motivated or contributed to his attacks. Cowan's reputation as a charismatic, \\"every day\\" individual was of particular focus in the media during the investigations and arrest.

History The Galloping Ghost was built by North American Aviation as a P-51D-15-NA, Army Air Force serial number 44-15651, at the NAA's Inglewood, California, plant for military use during World War II. Once the aircraft was delivered, it was transferred to the then-Walnut Ridge Army Air Field in Walnut Ridge, Arkansas. It was later classified as surplus stock and offered to the public for around $3,500 ($ today). Around that time, Steve Beville and Bruce Raymond were looking to compete in the National Air Races in Cleveland, Ohio, that were to be held in September. Beville was able to secure the aircraft from the WAA on July 22, 1946, even though P-51 sales at Walnut Ridge Army Air Field had formally ended.

Raymond took fourth place on the closed-course track, winning $3,000. The following year, Beville piloted the aircraft in the Kendall Trophy race. He broke the record for fastest closed- course speed August 31, 1947, with 384.6 miles per hour (619 km/h), over the previous record of set by Alvin \\"Tex\\" Johnson in the Thompson Trophy race the previous year, winning $2,500.https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E16FD3E5E17738DDDA80894D1405B8788F1D3 The New York Times, August 31, 1947. Beville also raced for the 1947 Thompson Trophy, taking fourth. For 1948, Raymond raced in the Sohio (taking fourth), Thompson (second) and Tinnerman (first) Trophies. He won the Tinnerman by less than a second, taking $3,150 and earning a total of $11,850 for all three races. In 1949, Beville raced in the Sohio and Thompson Trophies, taking fourth for both and earning a total of $3,700. In 1963, the aircraft was purchased by Dr. Cliff Cummins as a stripped hulk.Mustang 44-15651 Retrieved September 18, 2011. He restored the aircraft and had it modified for racing, included the addition of a lower-profile canopy and reducing the wingspan four feet (120 cm). He first raced it at the Reno Air Races in 1969 as Miss Candace (named after his daughter) race number 69. At the 1970 races, he suffered an engine failure and landed short of the runway, damaging the aircraft.History of Jeannie by Denver Kissinger Retrieved September 18, 2011.* Carter, Dustin W., and Matthews, Birch J., Mustang: The Racing Thoroughbred. West Chester, Pennsylvania: Schiffer Publishing Company, 1992. . The aircraft was rebuilt again, this time with a very small canopy taken from a Formula One air racer and a smaller belly cooling scoop. In this configuration, Cummins first raced the aircraft in 1972. In 1973 he qualified the airplane in the third position for the Unlimited Class Gold Race and he took second place behind Lyle Shelton's winning Bearcat. He did win the 1976 National Air Races at Mojave, California, with a winning speed of 422 miles per hour (679 km/h). After racing the aircraft for several years with limited success, he sold the aircraft in 1979 to Wiley Sanders of Sanders Truck Lines. Sanders renamed the aircraft Jeannie, after his wife. The aircraft was rebuilt with an eye to weight reduction. In the end, 600 pounds (270 kg) were removed from the airframe. Roy \\"Mac\\" McLain flew the aircraft in 1979 at the Reno Air Races. Shortly before the 1980 air races, the aircraft was damaged in a crash at the Van Nuys Airport. In a frantic effort, the aircraft was rebuilt and again flown by McLain, winning the Gold Race at Reno just days later. At the 1981 Reno Air Races, Skip Holm piloted the aircraft to victory in the Unlimited Class Gold Race. The following year, the aircraft suffered an engine failure and did not participate in the Gold Race. The aircraft was sold to Jimmy Leeward in 1983, shortly after the aircraft's wing span had been reduced another six feet (180 cm). Leeward initially raced the aircraft as Specter, race number X.Picture of Specter Retrieved September 25, 2011. He later raced the aircraft at Reno as race number 9 and later race number 44 \\"The Leeward Air Ranch Special.\\" After an engine failure at the 1989 Reno Air Races forced Leeward to land the airplane on a dirt road, the aircraft did not appear at the races between 1990 and 2009. In 2010, the Galloping Ghost returned to the Reno races. 2011 Reno Air Races crash In 2011, Leeward flew the aircraft again in the Reno Air Races. On September 16, 2011, The Galloping Ghost crashed into spectators at the races, killing Leeward and 10 spectators and injuring 69 others. The aircraft had just rounded the last pylon when it pitched upward and then went inverted. While inverted, the plane rocked its wings and suddenly pitched downward towards the ground and grandstands, crashing into the box seating area in front of the grandstands. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) examined whether the loss of a component of the tail played a role in the crash of The Galloping Ghost. News reports included a photograph taken right before the crash while the airplane was inverted show a missing left elevator trim tab. A similar event had taken place in 1998: the left trim tab was lost by a modified P-51 Mustang named Voodoo Chile, piloted by \\"Hurricane\\" Bob Hannah, during the Reno Air Races. The 1998 incident did not lead to a crash, but Hannah reported that when the elevator trim tab came off, the airplane pitched up and subjected him to over 10 g and a loss of consciousness. When he regained consciousness, the plane had climbed to over 9,000 feet (2,750 m). In that incident, Hannah had been able to bring the damaged plane in for a safe landing. In the NTSB investigation report, the cause was attributed to extreme pitch-up to 17 g+ caused by the loss of the port elevator trim tab due to wear in the trim tab mounts, exacerbated by lock-nuts on the mounting bolts losing their self- locking ability due to use past their normal life.

Sixty-nine more people on the ground were injured. It was the third-deadliest airshow disaster in U.S. history, following accidents in 1972 and 1951. Accident James Leeward, 74, and his P-51 Mustang, The Galloping Ghost, were in third place and had just rounded pylon number 8 when the aircraft abruptly pitched up, rolled inverted, then nosedived. The aircraft hit the apron at over in front of the grandstands in an area containing box seating, disintegrating on impact. There was no fire. Seven people, including the pilot, died at the crash site; four died later in the hospital. The weekend's remaining races at the Reno Air Races were canceled. Aircraft The Galloping Ghost was a highly modified former military plane that in 2010 had come out of retirement after undergoing major modifications, including removal of the underbelly radiator and installation of a \\"boil-off\\" cooling system, as well as other modifications that the owner described as designed to make the plane more efficient. The former United States Air Force aircraft, serial number 44-15651, was owned by Aero Trans Corp in Ocala, Florida. The wings had been clipped a further each side on top of the reduction in span earlier in its life. The aircraft had a long history of successful competition in air races dating back to the National Air Races from 1946 to 1949 in Cleveland, Ohio. It was flown by a series of pilots under a variety of names, including Miss Candace from 1969 to 1978 and Jeannie in 1981. Leeward called the modifications of the plane \\"radical.\\" He said the oil system was similar to an oil cooling system in the Space Shuttle. The canopy was about the size of the ones on Formula One aircraft. The modifications were meant to improve aerodynamics by reducing drag and hence increase top speed. Previous incidents On September 18, 1970, the airplane (then known as Miss Candace) crashed while attempting an emergency landing caused by an engine failure during that year's Reno Air Races at Reno-Stead Airport. During the landing the plane's longer propeller, modified for racing, clipped the runway surface, causing the plane to drift off the edge of the runway, collapsing part of the landing gear, causing only minor injuries to pilot Dr. Cliff Cummins. In 1998, another modified P-51 Mustang, Voodoo Chile, lost a left trim tab during the Reno Air Races. The pilot, Bob \\"Hurricane\\" Hannah, reported that the airplane pitched up, subjecting him to more than 10 g and knocking him unconscious. When he regained consciousness, the plane had climbed to more than 9,000 feet (2,750 m), and he brought it in for a safe landing. This aircraft (having been renamed to Voodoo) was in attendance at the 2011 race, and nearby at the time of the accident. In 1999, another highly modified P-51 called Miss Ashley II, piloted by Gary Levitz, experienced rudder flutter during an unlimited race at the Reno Air Races. The airframe broke up, killing Levitz. Investigation NTSB photo showing part of the elevator trim tab The day after the crash, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) began examining whether part of the empennage had come off before the crash. A photograph taken just before the crash showed the airplane inverted and part of the left elevator trim tab missing. On October 21, 2011, Federal crash investigators with the NTSB said that they found no readable onboard video amid the debris of the racing plane. However, they were still attempting to extract information from an onboard data memory card found among damaged aircraft components and other debris scattered over more than two acres following the crash, as well as hundreds of photos and dozens of videos provided by spectators. The NTSB thoroughly investigated the extensive modifications made to the airplane. The modifications had made the aircraft lighter and reduced drag but decreased stability. Leeward took the plane to 530 mph (850 km/h) during the race, about 40 mph (65 km/h) faster than he had gone previously.Ritter, Ken, \\"NTSB: Trim tab failure caused 2011 race crash\\", Military Times, 27 August 2012 There was evidence of extreme stress on the airframe demonstrated by buckling of the fuselage aft of the wing and gaps appearing between the fuselage and the canopy during the flight (visible in high-resolution photographs taken by spectators). The investigation report, released in August 2012, found that the probable cause of the crash was reused single-use locknuts in the left elevator trim tab system that loosened. This led to a fatigue crack in an attachment screw and allowed the trim tab to flutter. This flutter caused the trim tab link assembly to fail which led to the loss of control of the aircraft. Untested and undocumented modifications to the airplane contributed to the accident. Particularly, the right trim tab had been fixed in place. Had both trim tabs been operational, the loss of the left trim tab alone may not have caused the loss of control. When the trim tab failed, Leeward experienced 17 g, which quickly incapacitated him and likely rendered him unconscious.Accident Brief, NTSB/AAB-12/01 PB2012-916203\\"Pilot/Race 177, The Galloping Ghost North American P-51D, N79111 Reno, Nevada September 16, 2011 Accident Brief NTSB/AAB-12/01\\" In 2012, the NTSB released seven safety recommendations to be applied to future air races. These included course design and layout further away from the spectators stands, pre-race inspections, airworthiness of aircraft modifications, FAA guidance, pilot g-force awareness, and ramp safety.

He was a member of the Oregon House of Representatives for four terms, from 1935 through 1942. He also served in the Oregon State Senate from 1955 to 1972. He held the position of Speaker of the House during the 1937 legislative session, and was President of the Oregon Senate during the 1961 and 1965 sessions. Boivin was known as \\"The Fox\\" for his expertise in parliamentary procedures and ability to build coalitions within legislature. For almost a decade in the 1960s and early 1970s, Boivin and a small group of rural conservative Democrats joined Republicans to control the state senate.  Early life  Boivin was born in Ashland, Oregon on February 7, 1904, the son of Henry and Nellie Boivin. The family moved to Klamath Falls, Oregon in 1906. He received a bachelor's degree from Santa Clara University; then went on to earn a law degree from the university.Swensen, Julie, \\"Onetime legislative leader Boivin dies\\", Mail Tribune, Medford, Oregon, 17 March 1999.Baker, Nina and Osker Spicer, \\"The Fox of legislative fame, Harry Boivin, dies at age 95\\", The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, 18 March 1999. In 1923, Boivin became an associate in a Klamath Falls law firm headed by Claude McColloch. When McColloch was appointed to the United States District Court in the 1930s, Boivin continued in a one-man law practice.\\"Boivin, Uerlings, DiIaconi, P.C.\\" , www.riverbasinlaw.com, Klamath Falls, Oregon, 4 September 2011. In 1934, Boivin married Vivian McCauley. Together they had two children.  Political career  Boivin, a Democrat, was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives in 1935, representing Klamath County. He was re-elected in 1937. At that time, he was only 33 years old.Sadler, Russell, \\"The Fox leave big political legacy\\", The Register-Guard, Eugene, Oregon, 21 March 1999, p. 3F. When his peers in the House of Representatives elected him speaker, he became the youngest speaker in Oregon history. He went on to serve two more terms as a state representative, holding his seat through 1942.\\"In memoriam: Former state Representative and state Senator Harry Dolan Boivin, 1904-1999\\" , Senate Concurrent Resolution 13, 70th Oregon Legislative Assembly, Regular Session, Salem, Oregon, 1999. During World War II, Boivin worked in the United States Attorney's office in Portland, Oregon. After the war, he resumed his private law practice in Klamath Falls. He spearheaded the drive to establish the Oregon Institute of Technology in Klamath Falls, which opened in 1947.Silling, Ed, \\"Oregon Institute of Technology\\", Oregon Encyclopedia, Portland State University, Portland Oregon, 5 September 2011. In 1955, Boivin was elected to the Oregon State Senate. He served in the senate for the next 18 years, completing his last term in 1972. During his tenure in the senate, Boivin's colleagues elected him Senate president twice, in 1961 and 1965. For almost a decade in the 1960s and early 1970s, Boivin and a small group of conservative Democrats joined the Republican minority to control the senate. During this period, various conservative Democrats were elected president of the senate with the help of Republican senators. The senate president then appointed other members of the conservative Democratic clique to chair key committees with the rest of the committee chairmanships going to Republicans. This arrangement gave Boivin great influence within the senate.\\"Harry Boivin, He Believed in Coalitions\\", The Register-Guard, Eugene, Oregon, 19 May 1999, p. 16A. In 1964, he helped move the Oregon Institute of Technology to a new campus overlooking Upper Klamath Lake. He also persuaded Republican governor Tom McCall to move the headquarters of the Oregon Air National Guard from Portland to Klamath Falls. When the United States Air Force considered closing Kingsley Field, Boivin joined forces with McCall and Oregon's representatives in the United States Congress to keep the base open.\\"Boivin named to head off field closure\\", The Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, 28 January 1971, p. 2. In 1971, Boivin played a key role in the ratification of the 26th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which lowered the national voting age to 18. This occurred during a period when Governor McCall was out of the state and the president of the senate, John D. Burns, was acting governor. As president pro tempore of the senate, Boivin presided over the senate when Burns was acting governor. Boivin and Burns were both conservative Democrats who allied themselves with the Republican minority to control the senate. However, in the case of the 26th Amendment, Burns had been holding the ratification bill in committee while Boivin wanted it brought before the full senate for a vote. When Burns became acting governor, Boivin took advantage of his position as presiding officer in the senate to appoint two new members to the committee considering the amendment. Both of the new members favored the amendment, and with their help the resolution was reported out of committee. When Burns returned to the senate, he refused to allow a vote on the bill. This prompted 14 Democratic senators to walk out of the assembly, leaving the body without a quorum. Burns directed the Oregon State Police to find the missing senators and bring them back to the capitol. Over the course of the next three days, telephone negotiations resulted in a deal to allow the senate to vote on the amendment. Oregon ratified the 26th Amendment on July 1, 1971, thanks in large part to Boivin's committee stacking maneuver.Willis, Henny, \\"18-year-old vote bill goes back to panel\\", The Register-Guard, Eugene, Oregon, 29 May 1971, p. 14B.Willis, Henny, \\"Rap of Gavel Ends Three-day Paralysis of Oregon Senate\\", The Register-Guard, Eugene, Oregon, 3 June 1971, p. C1. It was such parliamentary maneuvers that earned Boivin the nickname The Fox. After his retirement from the legislature, The Oregon Journal said: \\"Harry Boivin was a master of the art of wheeling and dealing.\\" The article also noted that Boivin took pride in his nickname because it underscored his ability to get things done.  Later life  After leaving the state Senate in 1972, Boivin continued to practice law in Klamath Falls. Over the years, he held a number of other positions including chairman of the Oregon Liquor Control Commission. He was also a member of the Klamath County Chamber of Commerce board of directors, and a member of the Oregon State Board of Higher Education and served on the Governor's Commission on Senior Services. Boivin was honored by the Klamath County Chamber of Commerce in 1980 for his contributions to the local business community. In 1992, he received an honorary doctorate of technology degree from the Oregon Institute of Technology. The college also honored him with a special service award in 1995. His wife, Vivian, died in 1985. In 1986, he married Ruth S. Padgett. Boivin died on 15 March 1999 in Medford, Oregon, at the age of 95. He was interred at the Klamath Memorial Park in Klamath Falls.\\"A Gracious lady\\", The Register-Guard, Eugene, Oregon, 25 May 1985, p. 16A.  Legacy  After his death in 1999, the 70th Oregon Legislative Assembly passed a concurrent resolution honoring Boivin for his 26 years of service as a citizen legislator. The resolution recognized his many legislative accomplishments and highlighted his ability to build coalitions across political and ideological boundaries for the benefit of the state of Oregon and its people. Throughout his life, Boivin was a great supporter of education. As a state legislator, he was the driving force behind the establishment of the Oregon Institute of Technology in Klamath Falls. He established a $1.25 million trust fund for the college in 1995. In 2000, one of the academic buildings at the Oregon Institute of Technology was renamed in his honor.\\"Renaming of South Hall to Boivin Hall\\", minutes of regular meeting, Oregon State Board of Higher Education, Clackamas, Oregon, 21 October 1999.

In Terai Indra Jatra is also observed in some districts of Terai (Nepal and Indian Northern Bihar) as Indra Puja according to the local traditions. Rituals are different than in the Kathmandu Valley but the festival is observed around the same time indicating a common origin of the festival, probably during the Lichhavi period. Mythology According to legend, Indra (Hindu god-king of heaven), disguised as a farmer, descended to earth in search of parijat (Night jasmine), a white flower his mother Basundhara needed to perform a ritual. As he was plucking the flowers at Maruhiti, a sunken water spout at Maru, the people caught and bound him like a common thief. He was then put on display in the town square of Maru in Kathmandu. (In a reenactment of this event, an image of Indra with his hands bound is put on display at Maru and other places during the festival.) His mother, worried about his extended absence, came to Kathmandu and wandered around looking for him. (This event is commemorated by the procession of Dagin (‡§¶‡§æ‡§ó‡§ø‡§Ç) through the city. Pulu Kisi (alternate name TƒÅnƒÅ Kisi), a wicker representation of an elephant, also runs around town reenacting Indra's elephant searching frantically for its master.)van den Hoek, A. W.

When the city folk realized they had captured Indra himself, they were appalled and immediately released him. Out of appreciation for his release, his mother promised to provide enough dew throughout the winter to ensure a rich crop. It is said that Kathmandu starts to experience foggy mornings from this festival onwards because of this boon.Burbank, Jon (2002). Cultures of the World: Nepal. Marshall Cavendish. . Page 115.

Early career The company that built her leased her out as SS Pennsylvania for a few months, but quickly sold her to the Minnesota Steamship Company (MSC), which renamed her SS Mataafa. Her first season with the MSC was not without difficulties; she struck a rock in the Straits of Mackinac and arrived at Chicago, Illinois, with a leak, and then ran aground above the Soo Locks on her way back to Minnesota.Mariners Weather Log Volume 50 No. 3, December 2006, U.S. Department of Commerce and NOAA In 1901, she became a part of the original Pittsburgh Steamship Division of U.S. Steel when the division was formed.Mariners Weather Log Volume 50 No. 3, December 2006, U.S. Department of Commerce and NOAA Due to fog, she ran aground again, this time on Knife Island Reef in Lake Superior, on June 2, 1902.

At three-thirty in the afternoon of November 27, 1905, she was on her way out of Duluth, Minnesota, loaded with iron ore and towing the barge James Nasmyth. According to Captain Richard F. Humble, they were rounding the Apostle Islands when a nor'easter hit. After hours of fighting the storm, Humble decided to turn back to safe port in Two Harbors, Minnesota. After five more hours of struggling with the nor'easter, the ship made it back to Two Harbors, but was unable to enter the harbor due to the darkness. Her only remaining option was to try to make port at Duluth. As she approached Duluth, it became clear that it was useless to try to bring both the steamer and the barge through the narrow Duluth Ship Canal into the harbor, so Captain Humble gave the order to cut loose James Nasmyth, after which Mataafa attempted to make it into the harbor alone. She made it about half-way between the twin concrete piers when a backwater surged out. Heavy water struck her stern, driving her prow down to the muddy bottom, and then slammed her stern against the north pier. Her rudder tore off and the water pulled her prow out toward the open lake, then smashed her stern against the south pier. She grounded in the shallow water outside the north pier,The Infamous Freighter Mataafa, The Mind of James Donahue, by James Donahue where she broke in two, her stern settling slowly into the water.Great Lakes Shipwrecks and Survivals, William Ratigan, published by Galahad Books, Book IV: DOOMED ON SUPERIOR, November 1905, pg.274 When the ship broke in two, twelve men were in the after portion. Three of the men struggled out to the forward part of the ship. The nine who remained aboard the after portion died of exposure during the night; one of the bodies in the after half had to be chopped out of solid ice.Great Lakes Shipwrecks and Survivals, William Ratigan, published by Galahad Books, Book IV: DOOMED ON LAKE SUPERIOR, Chapter 8, pg.274 The fifteen men in the fore half fared better; although rescue attempts were futile during the stormy night, the next day a small boat made it out, and all fifteen were taken off in two boatloads.GenDisasters: Duluth, MN Steamer MATAAFA Disaster, Nov 1905, by Stu Beitler Later career Mataafa was refloated and repaired.

It is part of the University of Maine, which is located in nearby Orono, Maine. The University of Maine Art Collection was established in 1946, under the leadership of Vincent Hartgen. As the initial faculty member of the Department of Art and curator of the art collection, Hartgen's goal was to provide the people of Maine with significant opportunities to experience and learn about the visual arts and their diverse histories and cultural meanings. In the early 1980s, the University Art Collection became the University of Maine Museum of Art. Through the cooperative effort and vision of the City of Bangor and the University of Maine, the museum relocated in December 2002 to downtown Bangor where it has taken on a new role as a regional fine arts center. The facility was designed by the Boston firm, Ann Beha Architects, and now occupies the first floor of Norumbega Hall, a historic downtown building that formerly housed a department store. The Bangor facility, while allowing the museum to showcase a greater proportion of its collection, also enhances the arts scene of the region's largest city. The museum remains the only institution owned by the citizens of the State of Maine to house a permanent fine arts collection ‚Äì one which has grown to a stature that makes it a nucleus in the state for historic and contemporary art. Consisting of more than 3500 original works of art, the collection is particularly strong in American mid-20th century works on paper. Contemporary highlights of the collection include works by David Hockney, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Edward Hopper, Knox Martin, Pablo Picasso, and Edward Burtynsky. Additionally, the museum's permanent collection includes work by artists associated with Maine such as Berenice Abbott, Marsden Hartley, Winslow Homer, John Marin, Carl Sprinchorn, and Andrew Wyeth. In addition to making the University's collection more accessible to the public, the downtown location enables the museum to expand its educational programs beyond the confines of the Orono campus. In 2011, the museum was said to have one of the finest gallery spaces in the state. The museum hosts an annual calendar of exhibitions featuring contemporary artists and ideas. In 2011, the museum hosted its first national show, Photo National 2011. The exhibit featured 76 photographs by 34 photographers, including 11 from Maine.

Playing career Rose played women's basketball for the Winthrop Eagles from 1970 to 1974. Education Rose graduated from Winthrop University in 1974 with a B.S. degree in Physical Education. She received a Masters degree in Physical Education from the University of Tennessee in 1975. Coaching career While at Tennessee, Rose was a graduate assistant under legendary women's basketball coach Pat Summitt. Rose joined the Charlotte 49ers program in 1975 as women's basketball and tennis coach. She served as UNC Charlotte's coordinator of women's athletics from 1976‚Äì82. She served as the women's basketball team's first head coach from 1975‚Äì82. Rose produced success on the AIAW Division II level and built a career record of 93‚Äì56, which included three 20-plus win seasons and two AIAW All-Americans (Paula Bennett and Patricia Walker). Athletics administrative career Rose was promoted to assistant athletic director in 1981 and was named associate director of athletics in 1985 to then-athletic director and men's basketball coach Jeff Mullins. In 1982, the 49ers women's program left the AIAW for NCAA Division I, and Rose was named assistant athletic director. In 1990, Mullins was asked by the UNC System Board of Governors to relinquish his dual role. With Coach Mullins' recommendation UNC Charlotte Chancellor Dr. James H. Woodward appointed Judy Rose director of athletics at UNC Charlotte on July 1, 1990. Dr. Woodward promoted Mullins to Associate Vice Chancellor/men's basketball coach at that time. Rose became the sixth person to head the athletics department and just the second who was not also the men's basketball coach. She was the third woman, ever, to spearhead a collegiate program. Since her appointment as A.D., Rose added a full-time Compliance Officer, revamped the athletic academic advising program, hired a full-time strength and conditioning staff and developed a goals and objectives program for head coaches, administrative staff and student-athletes. Early in her administrative career, Rose pioneered the department's most successful fundraiser, the annual Great Gold Rush Auction. It began in 1984 and has generated over nearly $3 million in its 27-year history, including more than $100,000 each of the last 20 years, a record $270,000 in 2006 and six straight years over the $200,000 plateau. She was also the creator of the 49ers' successful \\"Let Me Play\\" Luncheon that raises funds for women's athletics. 2011 will see the 8th Annual Luncheon, which has raised over $600,000 for women's athletics. In her first year as director, the program left the Sun Belt Conference and joined the Metro Conference; the athletic department's D. L. Phillips Athletic Complex, home of the varsity baseball, soccer and softball fields were expanded and plans were finalized for the James H. Barnhardt Student Activity Center and Dale F. Halton Arena. The athletic program received a construction facelift as two major projects were unveiled in 1994. In October 1994, the Wachovia Athletic Field House, a 10,000-square foot locker room and office complex for baseball, men's soccer, women's soccer and softball was opened. By 1996, the 49ers had the $5.7 million Irwin Belk Track and Field Center/Transamerica Field, a 4,000-seat stadium complex which includes a 400-meter track, Transamerica Field for soccer and 11,000-square feet in field house space. Tennis courts were relocated to make a 15-court venue in the Phillips Complex. The multi-purpose $26 million Barnhardt Student Activity Center (SAC) and the 9,105-seat Halton Arena hosted its first athletic contest December 2, 1996. Rose attracted what at the time was the largest gift in UNC Charlotte history in naming the Barnhardt Center and a second substantial gift in naming Halton Arena. The Miltimore-Wallis Athletics Center, which is an addition to the SAC, was completed in December 2003 and in the summer of 2006, the 49ers broke ground on Robert and Mariam Hayes Stadium. In 1995, Rose and Dr. Woodward led Charlotte into Conference USA and in 2003 accepted an invitation to join the Atlantic 10 Conference in the 2005‚Äì06 season. The students successfully lead the efforts to add a college football program to the Charlotte 49ers, when Chancellor Dr. Phillip Dubois and the University Board of Trustees voted to add the program in 2008. In March 2011 Rose hired the 49ers' first football coach, former Wake Forest Demon Deacons defensive coordinator Brad Lambert. In April 2011 construction began on the program's $45 million home stadium, which will debut for the inaugural game on August 31, 2013. With the addition of 63 more athletics scholarships for the football program, an offsetting amount of Title IX mandated women's sports will be added. These will most likely include Field Hockey, Women's Lacrosse and Swimming; however, Rose has been an advocate of adding Competitive Cheerleading as a Title IX compliant sport. Rose coordinated the 49ers effort as host institution of the 1991 and 1993 NCAA Men's Basketball Southeast Regionals, the 1994 NCAA Men's Final Four, the 1996 NCAA Women's Final Four and the 1999 and 2000 NCAA Men's Soccer College Cup. Charlotte joined Kentucky and Minnesota as the only programs to host both basketball Final Fours. More recently, Charlotte hosted the 2008 NCAA Men's Basketball Regional and the 2011 NCAA Second and Third Rounds as Time Warner Cable Arena. On January 4, 2018, 49ers athletics announced Rose's retirement, effective June 30, 2018. During the last four years of her tenure, the Men's Basketball and Football team did not have a winning season, with football coming off of a 1-11 season and Men's Basketball firing third year Head Coach Mark Price less than a month before she announced her retirement. She was replaced by Mike Hill, who officially assumed his duties on March 15, 2018. However, Rose will serve as a special assistant to the chancellor for intercollegiate athletics until her retirement date. Recognition and awards Rose has received several awards over her career, most notably the 2001 NACDA Southeast Region Athletic Director of the Year Award. Other awards have included the Pegasus Award in 1999, the 1996 Bob Quincy Award by the Charlotte Sportsman Club, and the 1996 Charlotte Regional Sports Commission \\"Sixth-Man\\" Award for citywide athletic achievement. She was selected the 1996 Woman of the Year in Charlotte and was named the 1997 Citizen of the Year by the University Chamber of Commerce. In 1986, she became the first female inducted into the Blacksburg (SC) Hall of Fame and she received her 25-Year Service Award from UNC Charlotte in 2000. More recently, she was inducted into Winthrop's Athletics Hall of Fame, was named one of the city's Top Businesswomen by The Business Journal and was recognized with the Judy Wilkins Rose endowment as part of the University YMCA's Y Pathways program. In 2010, she was featured by Charlotte USA Women celebrating 20 Dynamic Women and was a recipient of Business Leader Media \\"2010 Charlotte Women Extraordinaire\\". In 2011, she was inducted into the Women's History Hall of Fame (Charlotte Club). Rose was among the 2020 class for the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame. Committees and appointments Rose was active on numerous boards, NCAA and Atlantic 10 Conference Committees and is a popular guest speaker. She was chair of the Championship and Sport Cabinet for the NCAA and was recently appointed to serve on the NCAA Workgroup for Resource Allocation and her past committee involvement includes: Division I Women's Basketball Discussion Group; NCAA Diversity Leadership Planning and Division I Men's Collegiate Basketball Partnership. She was on the Board of the Charlotte Regional Sports Commission and the selection committee for the Greater Charlotte Sports Hall of Fame. She was a member of the National Advisory Board for the Intercollegiate Athletics Leadership master's degree Program at the University of Washington.

Snyder was born in Kingston, New York, the second of five children of DeWitt Clinton Snyder (1859-1919) and his wife Gertrude Louisa Wood Snyder (1869-1961). His parents were Christian missionaries who had lived in the Belgian Congo. He was a descendant of the Hasbrouck family and of Louis DuBois. His first cousin twice removed was politician William Lounsbery. Graduating from Rutgers University in 1922 with a B.S. degree, he received a doctor of science degree from Harvard University in 1926. Snyder taught at four academic institutions, all state universities: North Carolina State College (1924-1930) as professor of biology, Ohio State University (1930-1947) as professor of genetics and later chairman of the Department of Zoology and Entomology, the University of Oklahoma (1947-1958) as Dean of the graduate college and professor of medicine, and the University of Hawaii (1958-1963) as President and later professor and professor emeritus. At the University of Hawaii, Snyder presided over a great expansion in both buildings (37 new buildings built) and enrollment (doubling). He was particularly proud of the beautiful mall, shaded by monkeypod trees, stretching from Varney Circle to East West Center Road. In 1961, Snyder attempted to terminate the university's intercollegiate football program, believing it to be incompatible with the university's academic mission. However, after alumni protests, the decision was reversed. Snyder received three honorary degrees. He served terms as president of the Genetics Society of America, of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and of the American Society of Human Genetics.  Biography/Career  Laurence Hasbrouck Snyder was born on July 23, 1901. Born in Kingston NY, Snyder‚Äôs parents, DeWitt Clinton Snyder and Gertrude Wood Snyder conceived him in Africa, where they worked as Christian medical missionaries. During their time there, Snyder‚Äôs mother showed symptoms of hemoglobinuric fever, forcing them to return to the United States and end their missionary. Dewitt and Gertrude Snyder were of English and Dutch ancestry. Snyder spent his childhood in Staten Island, spending a lot of time in the woods, fields, and lakes. This inspired a deep interest in wildlife, particularly in birds. Later, in 1928, Snyder published an illustrated booklet, ‚ÄúCommon Birds of North Carolina Farms, Gardens and Orchards‚Äù, studying birds in Raleigh, North Carolina. Snyder also researched on bird songs. Snyder attended Curtis High School in New York and was later accepted into Rutgers University . In 1922, he completed his bachelor of science degree at Rutgers, graduated, and entered the Graduate School of Harvard University, where he completed his doctor of science degree in 1926. After graduating from Rutgers, Snyder married Guldborg M. Herland in 1923. Herland was born and raised in Norway, but had been living in Staten Island at the time. By 1980, Snyder and Herland had 2 daughters, 9 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren. On March 24, 1956, Snyder became the first person to be the subject of the ‚ÄúPersonality Portrait‚Äù section in the Saturday Review. He then became known as the ‚Äúfather of human genetics‚Äù and as an unorthodox but ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù piano player. He learned how to play piano entirely by ear, earning money in college by playing during silent movies while in the dark. Before 1958, Snyder worked at several universities: as a professor in biology at North Carolina State College, a professor of medicine and genetics at Ohio State University, chair of Department of Zoology and Entomology as well as the graduate dean and professor of medicine at the University of Oklahoma. Throughout his lifetime, Snyder received a plethora of honors and awards, some of which include: election into 18 honorary societies, national president of Phi Sigma from 1953 to 1963, honorary degrees from Sc.D., Rutgers, 1947; Sc.D., Ohio State, 1960; and L.H.D., North Carolina State 1962. During his tenure at the University of Oklahoma, Snyder made a stand against segregation in Oklahoma, denouncing the Oklahoma chapter of the AAUP. Snyder also became the president of the University of Hawaii from 1958-1963. By that time, he had already become a world-renowned geneticist [3]. During his time there, he published 3 books, more than 150 articles, and gave over a thousand lectures both at the school and abroad. His work included developing the science of medical genetics from its beginning to the present day, influencing the development of modern day DNA technology. Currently on the University of Hawaii campus is a major building named Snyder Hall, housing research contributing the medical field. Snyder is also credited with collaborating with other countries to bring together the East and West. For example, during his tenure as the president of the University of Hawaii, the internationally famed East-West Center was established in 1960 and was funded by the U.S. Department of State. In 1961, as president of the 10th Pacific Science Congress, which congregated in the East-West Center that year, Snyder gave the presidential address to 60 countries represented by 2054 delegates. His address was named, ‚ÄúThe Wheel Has Come Full Circle‚Äù. It became so acclaimed, it was published in both the Proceedings of the Congress, and even the Journal of the Philippine Federation of Private Medical Practitioners. Snyder also gave other lectures, such as one in 1960 in Japan during the invitational symposium on ‚ÄúScience and Civilization‚Äù. At the symposium, Snyder was one of three American scientists invited as well as three other Japanese philosophers. His talk there, entitled, ‚ÄúHuman Individuality in Modern Civilization‚Äù also became so renowned that it appeared in official Japanese proceedings in both English and Japanese. In addition to Japan, Snyder visited and spoke in the Philippines (in over twenty Universities), Hong Kong, Okinawa, Taiwan, Thailand, and India. These visits and meetings with government officials from Pacific countries sparked interest and enthusiasm for the East-West Center and for a stronger relationship between the East and West. Once retired, Snyder went back to teaching classes for medical students and local physicians. By this time, Snyder needed to update his knowledge of new findings in DNA chemistry, protein chemistry, and metabolic pathways. Snyder later finally settled in Hawaii before his death in 1986.  Scientific and medical contributions  Snyder's major contributions to genetics and the genetic approach to medicine could be viewed through three main domains: (1) utilizing genetics to identify and treat diseases; (2) integrating concepts of genetics and heredity in scientific and medical understanding; (3) advocating for the idea of preventive genetic medicine in a bid to eliminate illnesses that result from heritable unfavorable genes. Snyder's contributions also track a shift in his academic focus from racialized aspects of population genetics in the 1920s to genetic and medical concerns more centered around the individual in the 1940s and 50s. Snyder's research, between 1926 and 1949, was reported in a series of 35 papers with the overall title, \\"Studies in Human Inheritance\\". These range over subjects that include blood groups, polydactylism, hemophilia, baldness, sex ratios, Rh incompatibility, and other topics. Perhaps his most remembered work is his study of phenylthiocarbamide, a chemical that tastes bitter to some individuals but is without taste to others, depending on the inheritance of a single gene. = Blood group genetics = In the early 1920s, the debate over the ABO blood group emerged with great enthusiasm in the scientific arena. Polish bacteriologist Ludwik Hirszfeld and his wife, pediatrician Hanna Hirszfeld, proposed in 1919 that blood groups were a result of two independent genetic loci, an A gene and a separate B gene. However, in 1924, German mathematician Felix Bernstein introduced a triple-allele hypothesis, contending that population data fit better with a single blood-group gene with three alleles, A, B, O, as we know of now. This occurred during the time when Snyder was relocating to North Carolina for his assistant professorship at North Carolina State College in Raleigh. He was two years away from his doctorate and was in the midst of choosing a dissertation topic. This problem of blood group typing appealed to him and he found that Bernstein's theory explained the discrepancies Snyder had found between the results of his own research at the time and Hirszfeld's theory. In 1925, Snyder published his thesis in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, applying the triple-allele hypothesis to type humans based on racial groups. Collaborating with American physician William Allan, Snyder drew blood from North Carolina Cherokee Indians and quantitatively analyzed blood-group proportions among the various racial hybrids within this population. Through this, he developed a theory of classifying races based on the relative proportion of different blood groups in different populations. He characterized humans as six races: European, Hunan, Indomanchurian, Africo- Malaysian, Pacific-American, and Australian, with these races having radiated from a single human origin. It is important to note that although Snyder's work was racialized, he was mainly seeking to use science and genetics to trace the origins of human races, and never viewed the human race as composed of multiple species. Snyder continued to apply genetics to solve medical problems, recognizing the medical impact of blood typing in not only race classification, but also blood transfusions and paternity tests. To emphasize the utility of blood typing not just in anthropology but also in medicine, Snyder expanded these ideas in his book Blood Grouping in Relation to Clinical and Legal Medicine. = Testing of heritable conditions = In the 1920s, there were only six clearly defined human traits whose genetics were well studied: the ABO blood group, the MN blood type, eye color, the direction of the whorl of hair at the back of the head, the presence of hair on the second joint of fingers and toes, and the dominant form of migraine discovered by William Allan. Snyder discovered a seventh in 1931, and developed the first genetic test for a trait. For most people, phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) tastes really bitter, but to a significant fraction of the population, the taste is entirely undetectable. Snyder was interested in confirming whether the ability to taste PTC is a Mendelian trait and sought to understand the biological and genetic nature of this trait. In his research, Snyder collected data from 800 families with 2,843 children to cover sufficient ground on the possible genetic combinations of this allele. He found that the gene PTC is associated with acted like a classic dominant, and both alleles (the taster and non- taster ones) are common. To test for the presence of the PTC taster allele, Snyder found a simple, cost-effective and convenient way of soaking a slip of paper in a solution containing PTC and letting the paper dry. This technique opened new ground for Snyder and other geneticists to test patients with other heritable conditions for PTC sensitivity, in hope of finding linkage groups: the presence of two genes sufficiently close to each other on a chromosome such that the inheritance of one trait indicates a high probability of inheriting the other. Snyder's findings on identifying heritable diseases was another significant contribution to the clinical applications of genetics. = Professionalization of medical genetics = The reason why Snyder is the founding father of American genetics is not that much due to his numerous intellectual accolades, but his contributions to the professionalization of human and medical genetics. During the 1930s and 40s, when Snyder was at Ohio State University, he developed and designed the first required course in medical genetics for medical students in America. He also taught this course at Duke, North Carolina and Wake Forest medical schools, and at the University of Oklahoma and to practicing physicians in Honolulu when he was at the University of Hawaii. In 1935, Snyder published his own textbook, The Principles of Heredity, which had five editions and was widely used in genetics courses. Snyder went on to establish four medical genetics programs on his own and was directly involved in the founding of at least two others. He was also a founder of the first professional society in medical genetics in 1948. As observed recurring in his writing, Snyder advocated that doctors should learn about genetics due to six reasons: (1) genetics could aid in diagnosis; (2) it could elucidate ways to prevent people from suffering from genetic disease; (3) it could be useful when there are legal implications, such as during cases of disputed paternity; (4) it plays a role in genetic counseling for marriage and (5) pregnancy; (6) genetics is also the basis for eugenic and euthenics programs, \\"for the protection of society.\\" = Eugenics = Snyder strongly believed that genetics hold great medical benefit in terms of the prevention of disease, through reducing the incidence of hereditary illness or even eliminating them altogether. He felt that \\"feeble-mindedness\\" was \\"probably the outstanding problem in eugenics,\\" contending throughout the final chapter of his textbook, The Principles of Heredity, that segregation and sterilization were necessary eugenic measures to ensure that the biological inequality leading to physical and mental deficiencies were curbed.

It was one of the major military actions in the Franco- Mexican War between elements of the Mexican Army of the Republic commanded by General Porfirio D√≠az and troops in the service of the Mexican Empire composed of Mexican imperialist soldiers. The campaign of Puebla includes the siege of Puebla, the battle of April 2, and the capture of the forts of Loreto and Guadalupe. The battle, also known as the Third Battle of Puebla, was the end of a siege on the city of Puebla which started on March 9 of the same year. Despite its being one of the major campaigns in the war of intervention, the number of casualties was low due to the decision of Porfirio D√≠az not to execute all the prisoners but instead release most of them under a signed promise that they would not take up arms again against the republic. The capture of Puebla was a huge defeat for the imperialists and was decisive in the victory of the Republic.  Background  With the republican troops of the Eastern Army under his command, General Porfirio D√≠az began the siege of Puebla, capital city of the state of Puebla, on March 9, 1866. D√≠az built his headquarters on the hill of San Juan, upon the site of Marshal Elie Fr√©d√©ric Forey's in the 1863 siege of Puebla. D√≠az did not have enough men and war materials to enact a long-term campaign. The French (who were to definitively leave Mexico on March 11Jean Avenel, La campagne du Mexique (1862‚Äì1867), page 153, Economica, Paris, 1996, ,) and imperialist forces occupied an advantageous position, with a similar number of soldiers, more guns, and the forts of Loreto and Guadalupe. In order to lessen the advantage of the besieged, D√≠az deployed his soldiers to capture the points that would allow him better control of the land. The Republicans captured the streets of the suburbs one by one, fighting house to house. During this confrontation, General Manuel Gonz√°lez was hit by a bullet that shattered his right elbow, necessitating the amputation of that arm. Then, on March 31, D√≠az had an accident that almost cost him his life. The roof of a house collapsed and half-buried him; when the Imperialists realized what had happened, they shot at him through the windows. Finally, D√≠az was rescued by Luis Teran. Leonardo M√°rquez left Mexico City on March 30 with an army of 3,840 men and 17 artillery pieces. D√≠az, knowing that Marquez was going to Puebla, realized he could not keep the site any longer. He had four options: first, to end the siege of Puebla and retreat to the south in order to avoid a joint attack by Marquez and the defenders of the city; second, to abandon the city and attack Marquez before he reached Puebla, facing the possibility of being trapped between far superior forces to his front and rear; third, to leave the city to join in the siege of Quer√©taro, and face the same possible situation as in the second; finally, to attack and capture Puebla. The battle Porfirio D√≠az, called for many years \\"The Hero of 2 de Abril\\". April 2, 1867. Entrance of Porfirio D√≠az to Puebla., oil on canvas by Francisco de Paula Mendoza, 1902. On April 1, D√≠az and his staff decided to attack Puebla. D√≠az divided his army into 17 columns of assault; three columns would feign an attack on the convent of Carmen, with the intention of diverting imperialist forces from the place by which he intended to enter the city. Following the plan, the attack began at 2:45 a.m. April 2. Major Carlos Pacheco commanded the column of assault that captured one of the entrances to the city. Pacheco was severely injured and lost an arm and a leg, but survived. The attack ended at 6 a.m. Besides the city, the Republican army captured plenty of artillery and bullets. In accordance with military law, D√≠az ordered the execution of Febronio Quijano, Mariano Trujeque, and 20 other commanders and officers taken prisoner. On April 4, the forts of Loreto and Guadalupe surrendered. Unlike at Puebla, D√≠az forgave all the officers taken prisoner in the hills of Loreto and Guadalupe. He declared later:\\"The executions (at Puebla) caused me a painful impression, and since then I decided to stop them...\\" The decision of D√≠az caused him great problems with Benito Ju√°rez, with whom he had an acrimonious relationship despite his victories for the Republican cause.  Aftermath  After the capture of Puebla, Porfirio D√≠az went out to meet Leonardo Marquez who was going to Puebla. When Marquez learned of the fall of Puebla, he decided to retire, but D√≠az reached him in the Hacienda de San Lorenzo; Marquez avoided the fight and fled, but General Amado Guadarrama captured 44 Mexican imperialist soldiers and 99 Austrians, 49 carts of bullets, and the military equipment of his troop. Although D√≠az also sent a group of soldiers after Marquez, he finally reached Mexico City, which was still under the control of the empire. The victory of April 2 allowed the forces of the Republic to move toward Quer√©taro and Mexico City. Mexico City was finally taken by Porfirio D√≠az without the firing of a single bullet.

School of Medicine at the University of Puerto Rico In 1960, Garc√≠a Palmieri was named director of internal medicine of the School of Medicine at the University of Puerto Rico (RCM), a position which he held until 1995, and in 1961 director of the institution's cardiology program. During this period (1966‚Äì67), he was named by Roberto S√°nchez Vilella, the governor of Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico's Secretary of Health. He resigned from the position because of health problems and returned to the RCM. Garc√≠a Palmieri has published 178 medicine articles, 6 books, and more than 80 newspaper columns geared to orient the people concerning medical problems. He participated in two presidential medical commissions, one under the presidency of Richard Nixon and the other under the presidency of Jimmy Carter (President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research). The commissions published nine books on their investigations of which five were co-authored by Garcia Palmieri. Memberships Garc√≠a Palmieri held Fellowships in the Royal Society of Health, the American College of Chest Physicians, the European Society of Cardiology, and the American Heart Association. He is also the only person to serve twice as president of the International Society of Cardiology. In 1956 he was president of Fi Sigma Alfa fraternity. Honors Garc√≠a Palmieri was the first person on whom the University of Puerto Rico bestowed the title of Distinguished Professor. In 1980, he received the International Achievement Award of the American Heart Association. His many honors include the title of Master of the College of Physicians (1984), and the Honor and Gold Key Award (1989) for most distinguished alumnus in the University of Maryland. In 1996, the University of Puerto Rico established the Mario Garcia Palmieri endowed chair, and the main bi-annual lecture of the Interamerican Congress of Cardiology bears his name. In 2001, he was awarded the ACP Laureate Award. The award honors those members of the ACP in Puerto Rico who have demonstrated, by their example and conduct, an abiding commitment to excellence in medical care, education or research, and in service to their community and the ACP.

The first structure on the property was a stone gristmill, built by George Nixson, followed by a stone miller's residence in 1787, along with a stable. The large brick house was built between 1825 and 1850 by George Nixson's son or grandson George. The house became known as \\"Dr. Nixson's Folly.\\" A large brick bank barn dates from this time, when Woodburn had become a plantation. The brick house is two stories with five bays, backed by a two-story seven-bay ell to the rear. The brickwork is in Flemish bond on the front and west sides, and four or five course American bond on the other sides. The house has a double-pile (two rooms deep) plan, but with a single full-depth parlor on the west side of the central hall. A \\"little parlor\\" lies on the other side of the hall. The bank barn features an overhanging forebay supported by six brick arches. A small forebay barn on a stone foundation is nearby. Down the hill from the main house lies the \\"patent house,\\" whose original single-pen log structure was probably the first building on the site, erected to establish the land patent. It has since been extended twice. An additional structure, the farm manager's house, was added to the National Register of Historic Places listing in 2008. The frame house was built in 1909 on a fieldstone foundation. The house has five rooms on each level with a large stair hall on both levels. A rear staircase connects the rearmost rooms. The Woodburn property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 1976, with the farm manager's house added in 2008.

Fragments of the bowl contain eight lines of an inscription. Controversy has surrounded its translation since the 1920s but it is agreed by scholars the fragments contain the earliest mention of Hamazi. The Bowl Only two fragments of the bowl are known to exist and were unearthed in Nippur (Ianna Temple) by the archaeologist Hermann Volrath Hilprecht in 1889. The two fragments are only small in size, but contain an extant Sumerian inscription of eight lines. Hilprecht glued the fragments together (the total size being 12 x 14. 5 x 1. 7 cm) and first translated part of the inscription in his Old Babylonian Inscriptions (1893).\\"The Babylonian Expedition of the University of Pennsylvania\\". Series A: Cuneiform texts (1893), Vol. 1 pt. 2. Hilprecht, H.V. \\"Old Babylonian Inscriptions chiefly from Nippur\\", plate 46, p. 49 (Trans Am. Phil. Soc.' N.S XIIII. 8). More information on the bowl is found in Laurence Waddell's \\"Makers of Civilization in Race and History\\" (1929, p. 94 ff). A full translation was undertaken by the French Assyriologist Fran√ßois Thureau- Dangin, the chief curator at the Louvre in 1905.\\"Les inscript Sumer er d' Akkad\\", F. Paris 1905, p. 229. The inscription of eight lines reads in full as follows:Tr. Dangin and Hilprecht (Waddell, 1929). The English translation reads:Tr. Dangin and Hilprecht (Waddell, 1929). The bowl fragments were dated by Hilprecht (1893) to the beginning of the Early Dynastic III (ED IIIa) Period (or Nippur III) c. 2600 BC.\\"Old Babylonian Inscriptions chiefly from Nippur\\", plate 46, p. 49. Other scholars however have proposed a slightly earlier date, such as the Early Dynastic II (c. 2750 BC).Early Dynastic Dedication Inscriptions from Nippur, Albrecht Goetze, Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Vol. 23, No. 2 , 1970, p. 39-56. In the early 20th century, Laurence Waddell excavated the ancient temple site at Nippur where the fragments were found and claimed he could date them to c. 3245 BC.Waddell, 1929, pp. 88-101. Most Assyriologists however have rejected this date. The bowl fragments later came into the possession of Waddell who in 1929 published his own alternative translation (see below). Meaning of Inscription Hilprecht and Dangin who translated the fragments considered the inscription to refer to a \\"cult at Kish\\", referring to the reference of a Pat[esi] (priest) in line three, placed in line four at the city Ki[sh] (Kish). They also acknowledged that it contained the earliest reference to Hamazi. The reference to King Za (or Sa) they could not identify. The archaeologist C. J. Gadd in 1940 proposed that King Za had conquered Hamazi, but made no attempt to identify him.\\"Fragments of an Early Sumerian Inscribed Bowl\\", C. J. Gadd, The British Museum Quarterly, Vol. 14, No. 2, Jun., 1940, pp. 32-33. The bowl also appears mentioned in the literature of Theophilus Pinches, who in 1921 wrote a personal letter to Waddell thanking him of bringing the bowl fragments to his attention.In a typed letter dated 24 February 1921 with the address 'Sipapra, 10 Oxford Road, Kilburn, London'. Despite this, Pinches never personally attempted to crack the meaning of the inscription. The origin and meaning of the inscription remains unresolved. Waddell's Translation WaddellWaddell, L. (1929). Makers of Civilization in Race & History. London: Luzac. p. 95. in his Makers of Civilization (1929) published an alternative translation of the fragments: His translation and work has never been taken serious by Assyriologists.The Later Works of Lieutenant-Colonel Professor Laurence Austine Waddell Waddell also identified Hamazi (fragment line 7) with Carchemish in Syria, but this location is improbable.

In many jurisdictions requiring voter IDs (such as New Hampshire), voters who do not have photo ID often must sign a Challenged Voter Affidavit in order to receive a ballot to vote. Examples = Argentina = In Argentina voting is compulsory for all citizens between 18 and 70 years old, non-compulsory for those older than 70 and between 16 and 18, and citizens with domiciles in foreign countries. To vote they must present a valid Documento Nacional de Identidad at the corresponding voting center. Most countries in Latin America have similar policies. =Australia= In Australia voting is compulsory for all adult citizens, although it is not compulsory to be registered on the electoral roll and is therefore difficult to enforce. Voting is only enforceable for those on the roll. Failure to cast a ballot may result in a small fine, currently AU$20. No form of ID is required to cast a ballot at an election; instead, voters are asked three questions before being issued a ballot, so that they can be checked off the electoral roll: (1) what is your full name; (2) where do you live; and (3) have you voted before in this election?Australian Electoral Commission: Polling On election day, voters can vote at any polling place in their state of residence, and at selected polling places in other states.Australian Electoral Commission: Ways to Vote.

The card tells the individual where and when to vote. Voters must prove their identity and address with one of three options:Elections.ca * Show one original government-issued piece of identification with photo, name and address, like a driver's license or a health card. * Show two original pieces of authorized identification. Both pieces must have a name and one must also have an address. Examples: student ID card, birth certificate, public transportation card, utility bill, bank/credit card statement, etc. * Take an oath and have an elector who knows the voter vouch for them (both of whom must make a sworn statement). This person must have authorized identification and their name must appear on the list of electors in the same polling division as the voter. This person can only vouch for one person and the person who is vouched for cannot vouch for another elector. Provincial elections However, in some provinces a voter must establish their identity by presenting a health insurance card, driver‚Äôs license, Canadian passport, certificate of Indian status, or a Canadian Forces ID card. =France= In France, you have to prove your identity to vote: at the registration (proof of address ‚Äî A phone, water or electricity invoice... ‚Äî and an identity document that proves your nationality ‚Äî National Identity Card or Passport ‚Äî and on the day of the vote, in towns larger than 1000 inhabitants, an identity document is required. =Germany= Germany uses a community-based resident registration system. Everyone eligible to vote receives a personal polling notification by mail, some weeks before the election. The notification indicates the voter's precinct polling station. Voters must present their polling notification and if asked a piece of photo ID (identity card (compulsory in Germany), passport, form of identification). As a rule identification is not required other than by the polling notification. If the voter cannot present the notification, a valid ID and an entry in the register of voters can qualify for voting.https://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/glossar/texte/Ausweispflicht.htmlBundeswahlordnung ¬ß 56, paragraph 3 = Greece = Voters identify themselves by their ID cards and are given the full number of ballot papers for the constituency plus a blank ballot paper and an empty envelope.

To prevent double-voting fraud, every voter is checked against the national voter database before their ballot is placed into the ballot box.http://www.althingi.is/lagas/148b/2000024.html =India= The Indian voter ID card is an identity document issued by the Election Commission of India to adult domiciles of India who have reached the age of 18, which primarily serves as an identity proof for Indian citizens while casting their ballot in the country's municipal, state, and national elections. It also serves as general identity, address, and age proof for other purposes such as buying a mobile phone SIM card or applying for a passport. It also serves as a Travel Document to travel to Nepal and Bhutan by Land or Air It is also known as Electoral Photo ID Card (EPIC). It was first introduced in 1993 during the tenure of the Chief Election Commissioner TN Seshan. There are 11 other types of alternative identification documents specified that can be accepted for voting =Israel= Similar to Germany, there is a national voters database and photo ID is required (identity card, passport or driving license).https://www.knesset.gov.il/elections18/heb/cec/NoticeIdentification.aspx =Italy= Italy has ID cards, which you present when voting. =Mexico= In Mexico voting is a voluntary right and is exercised protected by secrecy. Electoral laws are created by the federal government through the INE: National Electoral Institute (formerly IFE: Instituto Nacional Electoral 1990-2014). A free photo ID or elector's card is issued by right to all citizens of Mexico over 18, but sometimes months prior. Being allowed to commence paperwork before turning 18 is decided upon the day and month of birth, and how it plays in the current year's electoral calendar, as the institute suspends all new registries several months prior to any election. This action allows young Mexicans turning 18 within an inactive period to still enroll and guarantee their right to participate in the coming election. Full legal age in Mexico is 18 for both born and naturalized citizens. The voting ID card was introduced in 1990 by the now inactive IFE as a tool to \\"properly identify electors in a country with a history of voters casting multiple ballots and curious vote counts resulting in charges of fraud.\\" After 2014 the IFE was deemed permanently inactive due to minor constitutional reforms, therefore the INE was simultaneously created. Although both institutes carry out almost exactly the same tasks and duties, this change allowed for yet further homogenization of elections in the country and opening way to what many Mexicans and members of the international community call the first ever legal elections in the country, in 2017. The INE elector's card is currently used in Mexico as the main mean of age and identity validation for legal, commercial and financial purposes, making this a vital document for all Mexicans over the age of 18, and consequently broadening the chance for more citizens participating on election day. =Netherlands= The registration office of each municipality in the Netherlands maintains a registration of all residents. Every eligible voter receives a personal polling notification by mail some weeks before the election, indicating the polling station of the voter's precinct. Voters must present their polling notification and a piece of photo ID (passport, identity card, or drivers license (a passport or ID is compulsory from the age of 14)). Such photo ID may be expired but not by more than five years. =Norway= Voting in Norway is voluntary for citizens 18 years or older (16 in some municipalities). Every person who is eligible to vote are sent a polling card in the mail a while before the election. The polling card recommends the closest voting location to you, but you are not required to vote there, but you are required to vote within your municipality. The polling card contains the date(s) of the election, opening times of polling locations and information on how to vote. While it is not mandatory to bring the polling card on the day(s) of the election, it generally makes the process smoother. However, a photographic ID, such as a passport or a driver's license, is required to vote. During the election day after you pick your party, you present your photographic ID and optionally your poll card to the poll attendants who verifies the information against a database, and record that you have voted. =Sweden= When physically voting on election day, every voter must provide a valid identification document (such as a passport, drivers license, or an ID card from the Swedish Tax Agency). If a voter is missing valid identification, another person with valid ID-documents can certify the identity of the documentless voter.https://www.val.se/svenska- valsystemet/satt-att-rosta/rosta-pa-valdagen-i-din-vallokal.html =Switzerland= In Swiss cantons (i.e. the subnational political level in Switzerland) that still use the Landsgemeinde or cantonal assembly; Historically, or in Appenzell until the admission of women, the only proof of citizenship necessary for men to enter the voting area was to show their ceremonial sword or Swiss military sidearm (bayonet); this gave proof that you were a freeman allowed to bear arms and to vote. Women, and men who choose to do so, may show their voting card instead.Appenzell.info =United Kingdom= Photographic identification is mandatory to vote in elections in Northern Ireland. There is currently no requirement to have identification to vote in elections in England, Scotland and Wales, before any election all eligible voters are sent a Poll card by their local authority although it is not a requirement to be in possession of a Poll card to vote. A trial was held for the 2018 United Kingdom local elections - voters in 5 local authorities in England (Bromley, Gosport, Swindon, Watford and Woking) were required to show ID before voting as part of a pilot program to combat Electoral fraud. The legal basis for the trial has been contested. =United States= The Twenty- fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the conditioning of the right to vote in federal elections on payment of a poll tax or other types of tax for citizens of the United States. Many states have some form of voter ID requirement, which have been allowed to stand by the Supreme Court. Fourteen states have a strict requirement for a photo ID.

Pickens and her husband Robert. The farm property has become the Janelia Research Campus of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which surrounds the house. Property The property was purchased in 1934 by Vinton and Robert Pickens, who were living at the time in Switzerland. Robert Pickens was a correspondent for the Associated Press and had written a book on current affairs in 1934, Storm Clouds over Asia. Vinton Pickens was a professional artist and chairman of Loudoun County's first planning commission, established in 1941. The property was named for the Pickens' daughters, Jane and Cornelia. Design The house was designed by architect Philip Smith of the Boston firm of Smith and Walker in the Normandy Manor style at the specific requirement of Vinton Pickens, who wished to avoid references to Georgian and Federal style houses that were prevalent in the Loudoun County area. The house is unusual for the area, since it was more common for the affluent in Northern Virginia to remodel Georgian or Federal houses as the center of their estates, rather than to build new. Smith designed the house in a French country-influenced modernist style, using a reinforced concrete structure faced with brick. The house is irregularly massed with hipped slate roofs, with six prominent chimneys and a number of dormers. The brick exterior was originally painted white, but has exhibited considerable weathering. The house is entered through a heavy, somewhat recessed wood door, with a service entrance to one side. The entrance hall is paved with rubber tiles resembling marble. A curving staircase leads to the second floor. A parlor opens off the entry hall through double doors, continuing on to French doors giving onto a screened porch overlooking the swimming pool. A large marble-faced fireplace dominates the parlor. Another set of double doors opens onto the dining room, with a view of the Potomac River through large windows. Another large fireplace dominates the dining room. A service corridor runs to the kitchen and pantries. The kitchen is outfitted with rubber tiles and has a modernistic design. A service stair is nearby, running from the basement to the third floor. Two offices are close to the service stair. The service wing contains a summer kitchen, a laundry, bathroom and further pantries. The second floor is defined by a long corridor, leading to five bedrooms, all of which have fireplaces, and three of which have bathrooms. The master bedroom has views to the north and west. The third floor comprises the servants' quarters, with four bedrooms accessible by the service stair. A large bathroom and storage room complete the level. The basement includes a servants' recreation room, another servant's room, three storage rooms, a large library, a walk-in refrigerator and utility rooms.

Biography Kryski was a Polish nobleman of the line of Mazovian dukes that first came to power in 1429. He was born in 1562 in Drobin, the son of Stanislav Kryski and Margaret Uchanska and brother to Wojciech Kryski. Kryski was speaker in the sejms of 1603 and 1607. He was an ardent supporter of king Sigismund III, supporting him in his clashes with Jan Zamoyski's party. Kryski was a close associate of Grand Marshal of the Crown, Zygmunt Myszkowski and through these connections he became one of the closest advisers of Sigismund III. He held the title of Wojski of Zakroczym. During the Zebrzydowski Rebellion he stood faithfully by the monarch. His polemical writing Deklaracja pana wojewody krakowskiego refuted allegations by rebels. In 1609 he became the Deputy Chancellor of the Crown.

He was an uncompromising advocate of the annexation of Russia. In 1611 he organized a solemn homage to Sigismund III captured the tsar Vasily Shuiski and his family. In 1612 he accompanied the king in his siege of Moscow. In 1613 he became the Grand Chancellor of the Crown.

Description The conservation park occupies a parcel of land that extends across the localities of Karte, Kringin and Peebinga from west to east and consists of all of the land in sections 19, 21, 22, 30, and 31 of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Peebinga. The conservation park contains much land that was previously cleared for agriculture. It is characterised by remnants of mallee woodland on low, stabilised dunes. with regenerating open shrubland and grassland on sand plains. The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category Ia protected area. History The land under protection was first proclaimed as a flora and fauna reserve under the Crown Lands Act 1929 on 14 March 1940 in respect to sections 21, 22, 30, and 31 in the Hundred of Peebinga. On 30 September 1965, sections 19 and 30 were proclaimed under the Crown Lands Act 1929 as the Peebinga Wildlife Reserve. On 9 November 1967, the Peebinga National Park was proclaimed under the National Parks Act 1966 in respect to sections 19, 21, 22, 30, and 31. On 27 April 1972, the national park was reconstituted as the Peebinga Conservation Park upon the proclamation of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972. In 1982, the conservation park was listed on the now- defunct Register of the National Estate. Flora and fauna As well as grasses, the vegetation features ridge-fruited and slender-leaved mallee with warty cypress pine over broombush; the higher areas have square-fruited, red and white mallees. Fauna found in the conservation park includes western grey kangaroos and short-beaked echidnas. =Peebinga Important Bird Area= The conservation park has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports a relatively large population of malleefowl. It previously had a population of the eastern mallee subspecies of the western whipbird (Psophodes nigrogularis leucogaster), which is now locally extinct. Purple-gaped honeyeaters are present.

Kurt G√∂del showed how to find explicit examples of statements in formal systems that are provable in that system but whose shortest proof is unimaginably long. For example, the statement: :\\"This statement cannot be proved in Peano arithmetic in fewer than a googolplex symbols\\" is provable in Peano arithmetic (PA) but the shortest proof has at least a googolplex symbols, by an argument similar to the proof of G√∂del's first incompleteness theorem: If PA is consistent, then it cannot prove the statement in fewer than a googolplex symbols, because the existence of such a proof would itself be a theorem of PA, a contradiction. But simply enumerating all strings of length up to a googolplex and checking that each such string is not a proof (in PA) of the statement, yields a proof of the statement (which is necessarily longer than a googolplex symbols). The statement has a short proof in a more powerful system: in fact the proof given in the previous paragraph is a proof in the system of Peano arithmetic plus the statement \\"Peano arithmetic is consistent\\" (which, per the incompleteness theorem, cannot be proved in Peano arithmetic). In this argument, Peano arithmetic can be replaced by any more powerful consistent system, and a googolplex can be replaced by any number that can be described concisely in the system. Harvey Friedman found some explicit natural examples of this phenomenon, giving some explicit statements in Peano arithmetic and other formal systems whose shortest proofs are ridiculously long . For example, the statement :\\"there is an integer n such that if there is a sequence of rooted trees T1, T2, ..., Tn such that Tk has at most k+10 vertices, then some tree can be homeomorphically embedded in a later one\\" is provable in Peano arithmetic, but the shortest proof has length at least A(1000), where A(0)=1 and A(n+1)=2A(n). The statement is a special case of Kruskal's theorem and has a short proof in second order arithmetic. If one takes Peano arithmetic together with the negation of the statement above, one obtains an inconsistent theory whose shortest contradiction is unimaginably long.

Its criminal procedure code, the Kitab Undang-Undang Hukum Acara Pidana (\\"KUHAP\\"), determines the procedures and rights of individuals at different stages of the trial process.  History of Indonesia's criminal procedure  = Colonial times = Before 1910, ‚ÄúHukum Adat‚Äù or Adat laws applied in Indonesia. When the Dutch colonized Indonesia in 1910, they set up a civil law system that took precedence over the Adat laws. In terms of the criminal procedure, for example, the Dutch enacted two statutes to govern different parts of Indonesia. The Herziene Inlandsch/Indonesisch Reglement (\\"HIR\\")http://www.ladvolaw.com/indonesian- overview.html (accessed 15 September 2011) applied to Jawa and Madura, while the Rechtsreglement Buitengewesten (\\"Rbg\\") applied to the rest of Indonesia. The Adat laws applied to the natives only if it did not clash with the Dutch statutory provisions.IDE Asian Law Series No. 8, Achmad Ali, Law and Development in Changing Indonesia = Japanese occupation = When the Japanese occupied Indonesia in March 1942, they applied their Japanese Martial Law. This superseded all existing laws in Indonesia at that time. = Present = Today, Indonesia‚Äôs legal system is based on Dutch Colonial Law, Adat Law and National Law.http://www.lu.se/images/Syd_och_sydostasienstudier/working_papers/mason.pdf at p4 (accessed 14 September 2011) After Indonesia gained independence in August 1945, it adopted the Dutch HIR as its code of criminal procedure. In 1981, Indonesia replaced HIR with the KUHAP. The KUHAP improved upon the HIR by adding adversarial features to the criminal procedure. However, the KUHAP does not sufficiently protect human rights and its safeguards are often ignored in practice because there are no penalties for failing to comply with the Act. In response to dissatisfaction with the formal procedures in the Act, a working group drafted a new statue to replace the KUHAP in 2000. However, Indonesia has not adopted the working group's recommendations to date.  Steps involved in an ordinary criminal trial  left = Arrest = The police must produce a warrant upon arrest if the suspect is not \\"caught in the act\\". They must also send a copy of such warrant to the suspect‚Äôs family. = Detention = Suspects must be released within one day of arrest unless the investigator, prosecutor, or judge orders a detention. Detention is limited to offences liable to imprisonment of 5 years or more, and crimes under Art 21(4)(b). Suspects may be detained for a maximum of 60 days without judicial consent. = Investigation = Investigators must inform the public prosecutor before they begin their investigations. If the investigation is terminated due to insufficient evidence or if the event does not constitute an offence, investigators must inform the prosecutor and suspect. During investigation, investigators have the authority to summon witnesses for examination. When the investigation is completed, investigators must promptly submit the dossier of the case to the public prosecutor. If the public prosecutor believes that the investigation is incomplete, he will return the dossier and order for a supplementary investigation. The dossier is then resubmitted. = Prosecution = After examining the dossier of the case, the public prosecutor will determine if the case meets the requirements to be brought to court. If he decides to prosecute, he must prepare a Bill of Indictment and bring the action before an appropriate district court. Summonses will then be issued to the suspect and witnesses, if any, to attend trial. If the public prosecutor decides to cease prosecution, he must produce a written decision to be sent to suspect, investigator, and the judge. Please refer to the appendix for more information about the structure of Indonesia's Public Prosecution Service. = Pre-trial proceedings = Pre-trial proceedings are limited to examining whether the arrest and/or detention was legal and to decide whether the district court has the jurisdiction to try the case. = Trial procedures = At the outset of trial, the prosecutor will read out the Bill of Indictment. The judge will then summon the accused and witnesses to give their testimonies, which will then be examined. The head judge will lead the examination at trial. The prosecutor and the legal counsel may question the witnesses through the head judge. If an accused refuses to answer a question, the head judge will suggest that he answer and thereafter continue the examination. After examination, the prosecutor will submit his charges before the accused submits his defence. The prosecutor may reply to the defences put up, provided that the accused has a right to reply. The head judge will then consult other judges on the bench before he reaches a decision. = Judgment = The court will acquit the accused if guilt has not been legally and convincingly proven or dismiss all charges if the acts do not constitute an offence. If the court concludes that the accused is guilty of committing the offence, it will impose a punishment. The public prosecutor will then execute the judgment.  The appeal process  = Ordinary legal remedies = 400px Once a decision has been reached and read by the judge in a General Court of first instance, the aggrieved party may file an appeal to the relevant court of appeal within seven days. No appeal can be filed against a: # Judgment of acquittal that relates to an inappropriate application of law; or # Judgment of dismissal of all charges that relates to an inappropriate application of law; or # Judgment under express procedure. A judgment is made under express procedure when only one judge adjudicates the case because it is clear and minor. There are three grounds for appealing to the High Court: # Where a law of procedure has been negligently applied; # Where a mistake is found in the examination at first instance; # Where something is incomplete in the examination at first instance. After the High Court passes a judgment on an appeal, the aggrieved party can appeal to the Supreme Court as a matter of cassation. There are three grounds for appealing to the Supreme Court: # Where a legal rule has not been applied or has been applied in an improper manner; # Where the method of adjudication was not concluded according to the provisions of law; # Where the court has exceeded the limits of its competence. = Extraordinary legal remedies = Judgments are final and binding at the last appellate level. However a convicted person or his family may seek a final extraordinary remedy by submitting a request to the Supreme Court for reconsideration of the judgment, except when it is a judgment of acquittal or the dismissal of charges. Such a request is not time-barred and may only be made once. A request for reconsideration of a judgment may be made when: # New circumstances give rise to a strong presumption that had such circumstances been known during the trial, there would have been an acquittal or dismissal of all charges, or the charges of the public prosecutor would not have been acceptable, or that a less severe criminal provisions would have applied to the case. # Matters or circumstances that form the basis and reasoning of the judgment are declared contradictory. # A judgment clearly displays a mistake made by the judge or a manifest error. # An alleged act which has been declared proven in the judgment, but has not been followed up by the imposition of a penalty.  Role of the judge  240px The role of judges in the Indonesian criminal justice system is to impose a proper punishment on offenders based on a sufficient means of legal proof. Judges are generally only involved in the trial proceedings. When a judge receives a Bill of Indictment from the Public Prosecutor, he will determine a trial date and order the latter to summon the accused and witnesses to attend the trial. During the trial proceedings, the judge is obliged to ensure that the defendant or witness remains free to answer the questions posed. If the judge fails to do so, his decision will be annulled. At the end of the trial proceedings, the judge can only convict a person if he has at least two pieces of legal evidence supporting the conviction. Based on the evidence presented, the judge can punish, acquit or dismiss the charges against the accused. If the accused is convicted and he is sentenced to a punishment that deprives him of his liberty, the judge will assist the head judge to supervise the execution of the punishment.  Role of the prosecutors  The Public Prosecution Service of Indonesia is the only agency that has state powers to prosecute offenders. As such, there is no private prosecution in the Indonesian criminal justice system. Prosecutors are involved in the whole trial process, from the investigations, to trial proceedings and the execution of punishment. At the investigation stage, the prosecutor supervises the police‚Äôs investigations. The prosecutor only personally investigates cases when there are special crimes, such as corruption. Once the police complete investigations, they hand the evidence to the prosecutor. If the evidence is satisfactory, the prosecutor will prosecute the offender at an appropriate court. He will prepare a Bill of Indictment for the judge to begin the trial proceedings. During the trial proceedings, the prosecutor must ensure that the defendant, witnesses and experts are all present. The prosecutor must also present all evidence concerning the crime.\\"http://www.unafei.or.jp/english/pdf/RS_No53/No53_22PA_Zaimaru.pdf\\" (accessed 15 September 2011) In practice, the prosecutor usually presents three or more pieces of legal evidence to support the defendant‚Äôs guilt. After the judge has passed judgment on the case, the judge‚Äôs clerk will send a copy of the execution of punishment to the prosecutor. The prosecutor will then execute the punishment.  Legal protections for the accused  = Rights to counsel = A suspect has a right to obtain legal assistance from one or more legal counsels at every stage of the examination. At the start of the investigations, the police will inform the suspect of his right to receive legal assistance during examination at trial. If the suspect does not have legal assistance, he will receive free legal aid if he faces the death penalty, or imprisonment of fifteen years or more. The suspect will also receive free legal aid if he is destitute and faces imprisonment of five year or more. Once the suspect obtains legal assistance, the counsel has a right to contact him from the moment he is arrested or detained. The counsel also has a right to be present at, and listen to, interrogations. This ensures that the police do not carry out unfair interrogation techniques. = Rules of evidence = The court only admits five types of legal evidence. They are: # The testimony of a witness # The testimony of an expert # A document # An indication # The testimony of the accused In terms of the witness' testimony as a means of legal proof, the judge will compare a witness‚Äô testimony against other witness testimonies or other means of proof to determine whether the testimony is true. In the process, he also considers all other factors that affect the witness‚Äô credibility. A witness usually makes a testimony under oath. However, a testimony not made under oath can still be admitted as supplemental legal evidence if it is consistent with a testimony made under oath. As for an indication as a means of legal proof, an indication is an act, event, or situation that is consistent with other facts. It can only be obtained from the testimony of a witness or accused, or from a document. To convict an accused, a judge must have at least two means of legal proof to support the charge. This ensures that a suspect cannot be convicted merely because he confessed his guilt.  Current controversies and debates  = Problems concerning evidence = Indonesian courts only acc have a clear provision on the admissibility of illegally obtained evidence. Hence, the prosecution can present evidence that was obtained through torture, ill- treatment, or contrary to any provision in the KUHAP. Furthermore, there is no judicial avenue for an accused to seek redress if illegal evidence were presented at trial. This undermines the legal safeguards in the KUHAP. = Restricted rights to counsel = Counsel has a right to contact his client ‚Äúat every moment.‚Äù However, this right is undermined because a 1983 Ministry of Justice regulation interprets the phrase to mean that the client has a right to communicate with his counsel ‚Äòat every moment during office hours‚Äô. Based on this, police stations mysteriously close when lawyers visit their clients. This prevents the counsel from communicating with his client, undermining the suspect‚Äôs right to counsel. = Abuse of detention powers = The police can abuse its powers to detain a suspect by using threats of detention to pressure a suspect to confess that he is guilty. In addition, the KUHAP does not ensure that detainees are brought to court promptly. Under the KUHAP, a suspect can be detained for up to 60 days without judicial intervention. For example, if the police detains a suspect for 20 days under Art24(1), a prosecutor can extend this detention for another 40 days under Art 24(2). Please refer to the appendix for more information about how long a suspect can be detained without judicial intervention. = Fictional right to silence = Finally, it is unclear whether an accused has a right to remain silent during examination. Although an accused ‚Äúshall not be burdened with the duty of giving evidence‚Äù, Art 175 seems to undermine this right. Under Art 175, the head judge can suggest that the accused answers the question. The examination will continue after the head judge makes this suggestion. However, since there is a high respect for authority in Indonesia, the head judge's ‚Äúsuggestion‚Äù will probably persuade the accused to answer the question. This undermines the right to remain silent during examination.

Joining at age 11, as an ensign, he fought campaigns against the Meskwaki tribe in Illinois, and the British in Acadia. In 1759, during the Seven Years' War, as the King's lieutenant; he signed, in the name of Louis XV, the Articles of Capitulation of the City of Quebec, for which he was later criticised. Early life Jean- Baptiste Nicholas Roch was the youngest son of Claude de Ramezay and Marie- Charlotte Denys de la Ronde, daughter of Pierre Denys de La Ronde (1631 - 1708) and Catherine Le Neuf. He was born on 4 September 1708 and raised in the family chateau in Montreal. On 7 May 1720, he became an ensign of the colonial regulars, in which his older brother, Charles Hector de Ramezay, was a lieutenant. When his brother died, in August 1725, Jean's mother, Charlotte Denys de Ramezay, purchased the lieutenancy for him.Snow (pp.72-73) Career After his promotion was confirmed, on 23 April 1726, he served under Gaspard- Joseph Chaussegros de L√©ry, an engineer employed in the rebuilding of Fort Niagara. The fort, near Youngstown, was designed to protect French interests from the British, who had recently settled at Oswego. Ramezay spent the spring of 1728 campaigning against the Fox tribe in Illinois, under Constant le Marchand de Lignery, then, in 1731, was assigned to make peace with the Ojibwas tribe by Governor Beauharnois. He was promoted to captain in 1734, then, in 1742, is noted as commanding a fort at the mouth of the Onaman river. =King George's War= In 1744 War broke out between France and Britain, and in 1746 the French launched a massive counterattack in an attempt to overturn British gains in Acadia. More than 7,000 troops under Jean-Baptiste Louis Fr√©d√©ric de La Rochefoucauld de Roye, duc d'Anville, were sent in ships to recapture Louisbourg and Annapolis Royal then, if the first two objectives were achieved, to launch an attack on Boston. Ramezay was to provide ground support and was given command of a force of 1,800 French-Canadian militia and a number of Native Americans.Grenier (p.129)Jobb (pp.74-75) On 10 July, he landed with 700 men at Baie Verte in New Brunswick, stationing himself in Beaubassin, he began gathering troops before laying siege to Fort Anne. D'Anville's fleet was broken up by Atlantic storms however. Some ships were forced to return to France while the rest sought refuge in Chebucto Harbour, now Halifax. Ramezay was therefore forced to withdraw to Minas. Massacre at Grand-Pre Hearing of Ramezay‚Äôs retreat, the fort‚Äôs commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Noble led an expedition of 400-500 men to drive Ramezay out. Ramezay again had to retreat, this time to Beaubassin, leaving Noble to billet his men in Grand-Pre for the winter. Noble failed to take precautions against a counterattack however, believing the distance and inhospitable weather to be sufficient defence. Ramezay planned a surprise assault, sending a detachment of 300 men under Captain Nicolas Antoine II Coulon-de-Villiers across the mountains in hostile conditions. While staying overnight in the Gaspereau Valley, they learned of the precise positions of Noble and his troops from their Acadian hosts. This important information, coupled with the attack taking place at 3:00 am in a snowstorm, meant that many of the British died in their beds. Noble refused an offer to surrender and was shot dead. The massacre at Grand-Pr√©, as the battle became known, was in vain, however, as the French once more withdrew, allowing the British to recapture it the following spring. Nevertheless, Ramezay returned a hero and was decorated with the Cross of St Louis on 15 February 1748. In 1749 Ramezay was promoted to Major of Quebec, a post he held for nine years, until being appointed King's Lieutenant. In the spring of 1759 he was given responsibility for defense of the upper town against an expected attack by British forces under Major General James Wolfe. =Siege of Quebec= It was generally agreed that the city of Quebec was not able to withstand a siege: Its chief engineer, Nicholas Sarrebource de Pontleroy stated that, \\"The city is not capable of useful defence in case of a siege, having neither ditches nor counterscarps nor covered way, and being dominated by heights behind which there is cover for approach\\"; the French commander, Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, wrote in his journal, \\"...an army that can get near its walls is sure to compel its surrender sooner or later\\", and his Aide de Camp, Louis Antoine de Bougainville, also recorded, \\"If the approaches to the city were not defended, the city would have to surrender\\".Snow (p.71) The main strategy for the defence of Quebec therefore was to oppose the British landing, specifically between the Saint-Charles River and the Montmorency Falls.Snow (p.76) Nevertheless, some steps were taken to fortify the city and prepare for a siege. Ramezay describes in his diary how for two weeks thousands of men, soldiers and sailors, carried, dug and hacked at the earth.Snow (p.73) Houses with their backs to the water had their walls strengthened, and those along the Beauport shore were punched through with loopholes. Warehouses were demolished to improve fields of fire, and footpaths were rendered impassable.Snow (p.75) To lessen the burden on the city‚Äôs rations, Montcalm sent all the women, children, magistrates and all those not contributing to the defence of the city, to Trois-Rivi√®res. He also planned for defeat, hiding supplies, ammunition and food along the banks of the St Lawrence River; his proposed route of retreat, and sending the colony‚Äôs supply ships fifty miles upstream to Batiscan to prevent their possible capture.Snow (pp.77-78) After being defeated on the Plains of Abraham on 13 September 1759, the French troops were dispersed; Montcalm, mortally wounded, managed to retire to Quebec with some of his troops, Bougainville and the remainder retreated in the direction of Montreal whilst the governor of New France, Lieutenant General Pierre de Rigaud de Vaudreuil de Cavagnal abandoned the Beauport shore and marched west in order to rendezvous with him.Snow (p.389) Vaudreuil sent word to Ramezay notifying him of his withdrawal and instructing him to defend the city until \\"he shall fall short of provisions\\", at which point he was to select the most capable officer to propose its capitulation. The British, now in control of the plains, brought up heavy artillery including twelve 24 pound cannons, large mortars and four inch howitzers, with which to bombard the city.Snow (p.392) A battery on the opposite shore at Point Levi had already made it impossible for the defenders of the city to remain on its wallsSnow (p.291) and Vice-Admiral Saunders who had hitherto kept his largest ships downstream, now brought seven of the most powerful to join the frigates already in the basin.Snow (p.394) The British were keen to settle things quickly before the onset of winter, and this show of strength was to facilitate a prompt surrender.Snow (pp.392-394) A review on 14 September revealed Ramezay to have 2,200 men comprising 330 French and colonial regulars, 20 artillery men, 500 sailors and 1,300 militiamen. Together with the 4,000 inhabitants, Ramezay reasoned he had enough rations for eight days.Snow (pp.389-390) On 15 September, he received a remonstrance from some of the most important townspeople asking him to capitulate rather than risk the sacking of the city.Snow (pp.392-393) Ramezay called a council of war, giving everyone an opportunity to air their views. Only one, Louis-Thomas Jacau de Fiedmont, was against surrender. In summing up, Ramezay declared, \\"Considering the instructions I have received from the Marquis de Vaudreuil and the scarcity of provisions, proved by the returns to me furnished and the searches I have made, I conclude to endeavour to obtain from the enemy the most honourable capitulation\\". Two days after the meeting, Ramezay composed a letter to Vaudreuil telling how the town had been left without sufficient provisions following the retreat, how the citizens feared an assault and how the sailors and militiamen had lost the will to fight, the Plains of Abraham were now occupied by enemy batteries and he was not hopeful that Vaudreuil‚Äôs army, which was now scattered, would come to the rescue. Furthermore, a promise of flour from Vaudreuil had failed to arrive. Ramezay finished by saying that his duty was to save the garrison and the citizens of the city. Ramezay then sent the Mayor of Quebec, Armand de Joannes, under a flag of truce to discuss the terms of surrender. Vaudreuil, who had received reinforcements and was marching from Jacques-Cartier with the intention of expelling the British from the plains, sent a second set of instructions asking Ramezay to hold out but these arrived after Ramezay had returned a signed document of capitulation.Snow (p.395) The British took control of the city on the afternoon of 18 September 1759.Snow (p.396) Ramezay received some criticism for his actions not least from Vaudreuil and BougainvilleSnow (p.398) but others were quick to defend him; Francois Daine, lieutenant general for civil and criminal affairs at the court of Quebec, wrote a letter to Versailles stating that Ramezay had surrendered in order not to, \\"...expose the garrison and the people to a general assault, and thereby the fury of the avenger, according to the laws of war\\". He also told how they were on the brink of dying from hunger. Later life Ramezay was returned to France. His wife sold their possessions in Canada and left with her daughter, son in law and their two children to join him in 1765. He died in Blaye on 7 May 1777.

The public sector is funded through the Ministerio de Salud, (MINSA) and the Social Security Fund (Caja de Seguro Social), which operate separate facilities. The Caja de Seguro Social is both a health care provider and a pension fund administrator. It is funded by contributions from employers and employees. About 3.47 million people of the population of roughly 3.9 million were covered by its provisions in 2013. This included both the contributors and their dependents. MINSA provides low cost facilities for those not covered. In 2014 it operated 830 health facilities. Problems with the public health care system are in the countryside where lack of funding creates a shortage of beds for their number of patients. The majority of doctors prefer to live in Panama City where there are higher patient loads and more economic opportunity. Panama City and David have become medical tourism destinations, especially for aesthetic and orthopaedic procedures. Private healthcare There are four major private hospitals. Private expenditure was 31.4% of total health spending in 2012, mostly directly out of pocket spending. Cl√≠nica Hospital San Fernando is the oldest, dating from 1949. The law entitles retirees to a 20-25% discount on medical services. A medical franchise, MiniMed, started in 2011 and has seven walk-in primary care facilities. Hospitals Emergency medical services are primarily in Panama City where 911 service is available. Outside Panama City and David, they drop off dramatically. Boquete, Chiriqu√≠ has limited capability despite a large ex- pat population. In the indigenous comarcas MINSA is the only provider and there are very limited hospital facilities. From 2009 to 2014 a medical city, Ciudad Hospitalaria in Panama City, a network of smaller health care facilities and five regional hospitals were initiated: * Anita Moreno Hospital in Los Santos District, * Manuel Amador Guerrero Hospital in Col√≥n Province, * Metet√≠ General Hospital in Dari√©n Province * Bugaba Hospital, slated for Chiriqu√≠ Province. * Luis ‚ÄúChicho‚Äù Fabrega hospital in Veraguas See also List of hospitals in Panama.

One of the most significant periods is the Gandharan art made between the 1st and 7th centuries developing out of Greco-Buddhist art. With the arrival of Islam, modern Afghanistan was for long periods part of Persian states, and its art was often an important part of Persian art and Islamic art in general. Since the 1900s, the nation began to use Western techniques in art. Afghanistan's art in many media was originally almost entirely done by men, although women were greatly involved in other media, but recently women are entering the arts programs at Kabul University. Art is largely centered at the National Museum of Afghanistan, the National Gallery of Afghanistan and the National Archives of Afghanistan in Kabul. There are a number of art schools in the country. The Center for Contemporary Arts Afghanistan (CCAA) in Kabul provides young people an opportunity to learn contemporary painting. In recent decades, war and deliberate iconoclasm have caused a great amount of destruction of Afghanistan's artistic heritage. Metalwork right A collection of over 20,600 gold ornaments, some of them dating back to the Bronze Age, was discovered in Afghanistan in the late 1970s. Known as the Bactrian Hoard, these coins, necklaces and other pieces of jewelry were found in burial mounts in Sheberghan in Jowzjan Province. They have been displayed in museums in the US and Europe.\\"Afghanistan: Hidden Treasures from the National Museum, Kabul\\" The Oxus Treasure, with objects probably of about 400-200 BCE, was found immediately across the border with Afghanistan, on the opposite bank of the Oxus River. Greco-Buddhist Art Afghanistan, the core territory of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (c. 250-125 BCE) was a key centre of Greco-Buddhist art from the 4th Century BCE to around the 7th Century CE, when it ceased after the Islamic Conquest. Large numbers of artworks have been found at the archaeological site of Hadda, Afghanistan.See image The 6th- century Buddhas of Bamiyan are a well-known example of Gandhara art from this period. They were destroyed by the Taliban in 2001. Taller Buddha in 1963 and in 2008 after destruction Islamic Art After the Islamic conquest of Afghanistan, Afghan art changed dramatically from previous Greco-Buddhist works, due to the adoption of Islam. Afghan local materials such as lapis lazuli were adapted for use in Islamic Art. Mosques built in Afghanistan and in the Arab world are built with elaborate tiling styles. Many of these styles were influenced from Chinese ceramics Canby, 120-123, and see index; Jones & Michell, 206-211 Afghanistan served as a conduit for introduction to these Chinese ceramic styles and techniques due to its strategic location on the Silk Road. Performance Art Buz-baz is a form of musical puppetry found in Afghanistan. The puppeteer manipulates a markhor marionette while simultaneously playing a dambura. Fine Art Afghanistan fine art was protected during the Taliban times by art masters at the Senai Art School. The professors often hid \\"un-Islamic\\" paintings from the Taliban when they would visit and inspect. Other artists used water color over oil paintings to conceal faces and images not approved by the Taliban. Since 2002, the Afghan fine art master painters have been able to conduct many more exhibitions within Central Asia and Europe. Their oil and water color paintings are often found in the realism style, as that is what most Afghans prefer. One of the most famous artists of that time was Sackin Nuqud. Afghanistan Art History , Modern Art Since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, contemporary art has seen a resurgence in Afghanistan. Beginning in 2009, international funding for the arts has flowed into Afghanistan from the United States and Europe. In 2012, Kabul-based artist Aman Mojadidi curated a 2012 Documenta exhibit in Kabul which showcased 12 contemporary Afghan artists whose work includes digital photography, textiles, abstract painting, filmmaking and mixed media.

Goodsell, is an associate professor at the Scripps Research Institute and research professor at Rutgers University, New Jersey (joint appointment). He is especially known for his watercolor paintings of cell interiors.  Education  David Goodsell studied a BSc in biology and chemistry at University of California Irvine. After this, he did a PhD in X-ray crystallography of DNA at the University of California Los Angeles, completed in 1987.  Research  Since completing his PhD he as worked as a structural biologist at the Scripps Research Institute (with a 2-year period in University of California in 1992-94). His research topics have included the use of structural biology and molecular dynamic simulations to investigate symmetry in protein oligomers, protein-protein interactions and for computer- aided drug design. In particular he is a developer of AutoDock, the most widely-used program used for molecular docking. His main research focus areas are HIV drug resistance and structure and function of bacterial cells.  Illustration  Goodsell has developed a signature style of scientific drawing. He started painting early in his childhood but did not study art in college. In graduate school, Goodsell became interested in scientific illustration while writing molecular graphics programs to visualize protein and DNA structures. Goodsell's signature style uses generally very flat shading, with strong and simple colour-schemes. As is typical in medical illustration, the images are simplified representations of the subject that still retain accuracy of the important features. His illustrations fall broadly into two categories: individual proteins, and cellular panoramas. His images of individual proteins are typically computer generated, cell-shaded space-filling representations of proteins, often with cut-aways to show internal binding sites and cofactors. Conversely, his illustration of cell interiors (sometimes called molecular landscapes) are hand-painted in watercolours. They are typically slices through a cell with highly simplified protein structures in a flat style in order to capture overall organisation without overwhelming detail. These cell interiors are often displayed at an effective 1,000,000x magnification for consistency. The paintings therefore share a consistent style, aiming to make interpretation easy and as intuitive as possible. His illustrations are published in the \\"Molecule of the Month\\" series by the Protein Data Bank, an archive of protein structures. His illustrations are used as teaching tools, in textbooks, in scientific publications, and as journal cover art. = Process = For individual proteins, Goodsell's illustrations are directly generated from solved protein structures deposited in the PDB using custom computer renderings that he wrote in Fortran (now released as an online illustration tool). Representations of large macromolecular complexes or crowded cellular environments require interpretation and synthesis of multiple different types of scientific imaging. These include X-ray crystallography and NMR for protein components, cryo electron tomography for larger complexes, and super-res light microscopy and electron microscopy for the cellular environment. In these cases, the focus in on portraying the relative scales, orientations and interactions between the components. In order to portray an accurate degree of crowding background gaps are filled with approximate sized generic proteins so that artistic license used to increase the accuracy of the overall representation.

The river is ephemeral and flows following winter and spring rains. The water discharged is saline. The river rises east of Corriging Hill and flows in a north westerly direction crossing the York to Quairading road twice before it finally discharges into the Avon River of which it is a tributary between York and Gwambygine. The Mackie has four tributaries of its own: Pitt Brook, Doctors Brook, Mungerding Brook and Bailey Bailey Brook. There were once permanent pools along the course of the river, most notably Marley Pool and Wonnobing Pool, but these are now shallow as a result of sediment deposition. The area was first explored by Europeans in 1830 when Ensign Dale travelled east from Guildford. York was settled in 1831 and Beverley in 1838, the land around York was sub-divided in 1842 with the land being primarily used for agricultural purposes.

Carey is an American author and historian who specializes in military aviation topics. Biography Carey was born in Orange County, California to Robert Watson Carey (1926-2004) and Joyce Kathleen Haynes (1928-1991). He holds dual citizenship with the United States and Great Britain. Carey is a graduate of Southwest Texas State University (now Texas State University) with a master's degree in public administration and a bachelor's degree in history and political science. Early life Carey was born while his father was stationed at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro. His father served as an aviation radioman, air gunner, and navigator serving from World War II to the Vietnam War. Carey's childhood as a military dependent consisted of living in three states and three foreign countries before the age of five. His father's retirement and subsequent second career in the construction industry resulted in the family moving to several more states before settling in Texas in 1975. His writing career began as an intern with the Texas State Historical Commission in 1992 where he co-authored Historic Preservation Easements in Texas. Military Service Like his father, a veteran of the Navy and Marine Corps, Carey enlisted in the military serving in the U.S. Marine Corps as a machine gunner/team leader and in the U.S. Army Reserve as a nuclear, biological, and chemical defense specialist and weapons instructor. Career Carey's early interest in military aviation history stems from his father's career as an aviation radioman and air gunner with Navy Bombing Squadron 109 (VB-109) and reading the works of such military historians as Edwin P. Hoyt, Steve Birdsall, Barrett Tillman, and Samuel Eliot Morison. In 1995, after researching VB-109's history, he was able to obtain the Distinguished Flying Cross and several additional Air Medals to his father's surviving crew members with the help of Congressman Lamar Smith (R). He is also noted for aiding veterans and families in a variety of issues related to military service. He began writing his first book, The Reluctant Raiders, after conducting research regarding his father's military service. Carey's early works traced relatively unknown aspects of military aviation primarily related to the Navy's use of the Consolidated B-24 Liberator and North American B-25 Mitchell.

The naval vessel, usually identified as of the United States Navy or Royal Navy and generally described as a battleship or aircraft carrier, requests that the other ship change course. The other party (generally identified as Canadian or often Irish and occasionally Spanish) responds that the naval vessel should change course, whereupon the captain of the naval vessel reiterates the demand, identifying himself and the ship he commands and sometimes making threats. This elicits a response worded as \\"I'm a lighthouse. Your call\\" (or similarly), a punchline which has become shorthand for the entire anecdote. It has circulated on the Internet and elsewhere in particular since a 1995 iteration that was represented as an actual transcript of such a communication released by the office of the U.S. Chief of Naval Operations. There appears to be no evidence that the event actually took place, and the account is implausible for several reasons. It is thus considered an urban legend, a variation on a joke that dates to at least the 1930s, sometimes referred to as \\"the lighthouse vs. the carrier\\" or \\"the lighthouse vs. the battleship\\". The U.S. Navy has a webpage debunking it, although this did not stop the former U.S. Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell using it as a joke in a 2008 speech. Other speakers have often used it simply as a parable teaching the dangers of inflexibility and self- importance, or the need for situational awareness. In 2004 a Swedish company dramatized it in an award-winning television advertisement.  Example  A commonly circulated version goes thus: Other vessels sometimes named in the transcript include the carriers Enterprise, Coral Sea and Nimitz, and the Missouri, a battleship. The location of the exchange has also sometimes been claimed to be Puget Sound, or off the coast of North Carolina, some other times the lighthouse is located at Cape Finisterre (Spain).Youtube: Hilarious Radio Conversation between US Naval Ship and Spanish Authorities (The Spanish version expands the joke by having the lighthouse keeper respond to the aircraft carrier's inventory of the fleet by saying he's accompanied by \\"our dog, our food, two beers, and a canary that's currently asleep.\\") Some versions relocate it to the Irish or Scottish coasts; in the former case the ship is sometimes identified as British, with the conversation taking place off the coast of Kerry in 1998. There is sometimes an additional line of dialogue where the lighthouse keeper tells the ship captain he is a Seaman First Class before the final exchange. The prefatory information sometimes notes it was released in response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act, and/or names Jeremy Boorda, the incumbent Chief of Naval Operations on the stated date.  Debunking  The Virginian-Pilot, the daily newspaper in Norfolk, Virginia, a city with a large naval presence, investigated the story after it had begun circulating extensively on and off the Internet in 1995. A spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet called it \\"a totally bogus story\\". Boorda's office said it had not released any such transcript on the date in question. And not only was the story an old one, the ships commonly named in it were mostly either out of service by 1995 (the Coral Sea, for example, had been scrapped two years before) or not aircraft carriers. Cited by Mikkelson. Other sources the paper consulted found more flaws with the story. A spokesman for the Coast Guard, which operates all American lighthouses, said that they had all long since been automated, so there would have been no one in one to talk to a ship, if the incident had taken place in US waters. He speculated that it had been circulated by members of the Coast Guard to make fun of the Navy. Four years later, in response to a report that a consultant continued to tell the story at speeches as if it were a true occurrence, Fast Company talked to Wayne Wheeler, a former Coast Guardsman who was then head of an enthusiasts' group called the US Lighthouse Society. He confirmed that it was an old story, and that in his experience with lighthouses was highly unlikely: A Canadian lighthouse keeper, Jim Abram of British Columbia, agreed. \\"I've been lighthouse keeping for 21 years,\\" he told the magazine, \\"and no one's ever thought that I was in anything but a lighthouse.\\" The Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) calls it \\"easily believable if you are not familiar with how the Navy operates or simple things such as GPS.\\" In addition to the historical inaccuracies with most of the ships named, the organization notes on its blog the extreme improbability that an aircraft carrier's crew would not realize they were off the coast of a landmass such as Newfoundland. The MOAA claimed, in 2009, to receive it in forwarded email an average of three times a day. \\"[After] fifty times the only interesting part about it is to see which details have been changed.\\"  History  The earliest known version of the joke appeared in a single-panel cartoon, reproduced from the London tabloid weekly The Humorist by the Canadian newspaper The Drumheller Review in 1931. It showed two men standing by their rails, shouting through megaphones: \\"Skipper: Where are you going with your blinking ship? / The Other: \\"This isn't a blinking ship. It's a lighthouse!\\"\\" In August 1934, the London weekly Answers, founded by Alfred Harmsworth, expanded the cartoon into a humorous anecdote, which was reprinted on both sides of the Atlantic. This version read: Variants appeared in humor books and periodicals over the next several decades. In 1943, Raphael Tuck & Sons issued a postcard version, with an illustration of the prow of an ocean liner and passing a uniformed man at the rail of a similar object: \\"Where the ell are you going on your perishin' ship? / This ain't no ship, it's a lighthouse!\\" Steven Covey told his own version in his 1989 bestseller The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, Cited by Mikkelson and Covey in turn cited an issue of Proceedings published two years earlier. Cited by Mikkelson. Isaac Asimov included it in a 1992 humor anthology. Cited by Mikkelson. Since 1995, the story continues to be told, albeit with some awareness that it is probably fictional. In 2004 Silva compass, a Swedish maker of marine navigational equipment, dramatized it in a television ad called \\"The Captain\\". Its version was set in the Irish Sea, with the ship called the USS Montana and an Irish lighthouse keeper. The advertisement, filmed in English with Swedish subtitles, won a Bronze Lion at that year's Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival., retrieved September 20, 2011; p. 4. Four years later, in 2008, retired Admiral Mike McConnell, then Director of National Intelligence, used the anecdote at the beginning of a speech at Johns Hopkins University. He insisted it was a true story. \\"I was in the signals intelligence business where you listen to the people talk and so on\\" he told his listeners beforehand. \\"This is true. It's an actual recording.\\" When he was later questioned on this, a spokesman said those statements were meant merely to set the audience up. \\"It's a technique‚Äîcomedians use it all the time to get the audience to buy in\\".  Interpretations  Most commentators who have used it in speeches or books point to it as Mikkelson does, \\"a lesson in the unimportance of self-importance\\". Felix Dennis, in whose retelling the story, represented as true, takes place off the coast of British Columbia, calls it his \\"favorite story about the 'infallibility' of power\\". He comments: Others, particularly those writing about management for business audiences, see it as demonstrating the need for flexibility. Barry Maher calls the intractability of some listeners the Abraham Lincoln Syndrome after the ship named in his version of the anecdote, which he also represents as true. \\"When the person you're dealing with refuses to let you go where you want to go, divert your course\\", he advises salespeople, echoing the language in the story. \\"Smashing into lighthouses is not a successful navigational strategy‚Äîno matter how pushy those lighthouses might be.\\" Within a marital context, Gary Smalley uses it to advise husbands trying to reconcile with their wives that \\"like the navy captain's attempts to manipulate the lighthouse, your attempts to control the situation could cause your wife to become an immovable rock and resent you more deeply\\". Another exegesis of the story is the importance of situational awareness. Christian media consultant Phil Cooke tells the story, conceding that it's fictional, and uses it to demonstrate the importance of the research he reads, and knowing one's audience in particular. \\"We're blind unless we know who we're talking to.\\" \\"[W]hile it is [the captain']s ship, it's most definitely not his ocean\\" writes Russ Linden, a columnist at Governing, of the lesson offered. Some speakers think the anecdote is an overused clich√©. Alan Stevens, president of the Global Speakers Federation, noted that Covey was still using it in speeches in 2010, and reported that the same week he heard him use it a client emailed him that two speakers at a political event she attended had used it. He tells those giving speeches to avoid not only the lighthouse story, but the boiling frog story and the story about a young boy throwing beached starfish back into the sea. \\"They may have happened once, but they won't have happened to the storyteller. What's worse, they are used so often, they have lost their impact.\\" They should instead follow his example and tell stories of things that actually happened to them or that they did themselves.

She is currently the advocacy director for the Committee to Protect Journalists and author of Cyberactivism and Citizen Journalism in Egypt: Digital Dissidence and Political Change. She has written and been interviewed extensively about digital activism and social media in the Middle East since 2006. Work Dr. Radsch is an internationally recognized expert on social media, citizen journalism, and activism and is frequently invited to comment about new media and the Middle East. She has appeared on CNN, Al Jazeera, MSNBC among other international outlets. Radsch also appeared in the PBS Frontline documentary Revolution in Egypt.https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/revolution-in-cairo/ She is the author of Cyberactivism and Citizen Journalism in Egypt: Digital Dissidence and Political Change (Palgrave Macmillan 2016). Radsch's work on cyberactivism in the Egypt and the Middle East has been widely published and she is frequently asked to speak on the subject.http://www.stimson.org/events/seismic-shift-understanding-change-in- the-middle-east/ Radsch is one of the earliest proponents of the political impact of cyberactivism in the Middle East and analysts of Arab media. As early as 2006 Radsch was writing about the revolutionary impact of blogging and social media in Egypt; in 2006 she presented a paper entitled ‚ÄúThe Revolution Will be Blogged: New Media Cultural Configurations‚Äù at a conference in Cairo. Radsch's Arab Media blog, started in 2006, is one of the longest- running blogs on the topic.Courtney Radsch's Arab Media Blog Radsch is the author of several book chapters about cyberactivism, social media and the Middle East.https://www.amazon.com/Surviving-Field-Research-Difficult- Situations/dp/0415489350/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1316148269&sr;=1-3 In Core the Commonplace she traced the development of cyberactivism in Egypt, arguing that there were three distinct phases in the development of blogging: experimentation, activism and diversification and that blogging was having a significant political impact. Her extensive ethnographic research on Egyptian cyberactivism provides a unique insight into the antecedents of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. In her chapter on the blogosphere and social media in a study by the Stimson Center, Seismic Shift: Understanding Change in the Middle East she argues that between 2005 and 2010 Middle Eastern blogs and social media showed rising dissatisfaction with the status quo, declining levels of fear and visible capability to mobilize large political protests. Career Radsch began working as a professional journalist in 2003 when she worked as a news editor at The Daily Star (Lebanon). She then worked for the New York Times in the Washington Bureau where she covered the 2004 elections, Abu Ghraib, politics and culture. In 2005, Radsch left the Times to pursue a Ph.D. in international relations at American University, where her research focused on cyberactivism in Egypt. Her dissertation, Digital Dissidence and Political Change: Cyberactivism and Citizen Journalism in Egypt, provides the first scholarly examination of the development of the youth movement in Egypt and the role that technology played in reconfiguring what she calls \\"the potentiality for expression and participation\\" and thus contributes to understanding how ICTs are implicated in processes of political change. In 2008, Radsch was hired by the Saudi-owned, Dubai-based Arabic satellite channel Al Arabiya as the English website managing editor. As a journalist and editor at Al Arabiya she oversaw the expansion of the English website and its integration into the broader newsroom. In October 2009 she published an article about safety problems on Emirates Airlines, whose president Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum is also the head of the Civil Regulatory Authority and the uncle of Dubai's ruler, H.H. Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum.http://www.dubai.ae/en.portal?topic,Article_000783,1,&_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=home According to Reporters Without Borders, she lost her job at Al Arabiya as a result of the article. The Australian newspaper, which originally broke the story about the safety problems, covered her dismissal. The article quoted an Emirates Airlines official denying that it had pressured the station and its PR firm claimed inaccuracies in the article, but did not specify what they were. Radsch worked for Al Arabiya from 2008 to 2009. Dr. Radsch also ran the Freedom of Expression Campaign at Freedom House from 2010 to 2012 and was interim managing editor at the Development Executive Group in 2008. She received her PhD from American University.

After an engagement in which the Austrians suffered twice as many casualties as the French, Kray withdrew to the east. The combat occurred during the War of the Second Coalition, part of the French Revolutionary Wars. Biberach an der Riss is located southwest of Ulm. In late April 1800, a French army under the command of Jean Victor Marie Moreau crossed the Rhine river near Basel. At Stockach and Engen on 3 May, Moreau captured Kray's base of supplies and forced him into retreat. Two days later, Kray confronted his pursuers at Battle of Messkirch but was beaten again. On the 9th, the corps of Gouvion Saint-Cyr caught up with a part of Kray's army and the two sides battled again. Background Although the First Coalition forces achieved several initial victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and W√ºrzburg, the efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces back and resulted in the negotiation of the Peace of Leoben (17 April 1797) and the subsequent Treaty of Campo Formio (October 1797).Timothy Blanning, The French Revolutionary Wars, New York, Oxford University Press, pp. 41‚Äì59. This treaty proved difficult to administer. Austria was slow to give up some of the Venetian territories. A Congress convened at Rastatt for the purposes of deciding which southwestern German states would be mediatised to compensate the dynastic houses for territorial losses, but was unable to make any progress. Supported by French republican forces, Swiss insurgents staged several uprisings, ultimately causing the overthrow of the Swiss Confederation after 18 months of civil war.Blanning, pp. 200‚Äì280. By early 1799, the French Directory had become impatient with stalling tactics employed by Austria. The uprising in Naples raised further alarms, and recent gains in Switzerland suggested the timing was fortuitous to venture on another campaign in northern Italy and southwestern Germany.Blanning, p. 200. The Battles of Stockach and Engen in May 1800, followed by a larger battle at Messkirch, followed the Hohentwiel capitulation to the French At the beginning of 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced each other across the Rhine. Feldzeugmeister P√°l Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz, and 7,000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of Lake Constance (Bodensee) to protect the Vorarlberg. Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the L-shaped angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France. Unwisely, Kray set up his main magazine at Stockach, near the northwestern end of Lake Constance, only a day's march from French-held Switzerland.Arnold, 197-199 The Battle of Messkirch was won from the high ground. General of Division Jean Victor Marie Moreau commanded a modestly-equipped army of 137,000 French troops. Of these, 108,000 troops were available for field operations while the other 29,000 watched the Swiss border and held the Rhine fortresses. First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte offered a plan of operations based on outflanking the Austrians by a push from Switzerland, but Moreau declined to follow it. Rather, Moreau planned to cross the Rhine near Basel where the river swung to the north. A French column would distract Kray from Moreau's true intentions by crossing the Rhine from the west. Bonaparte wanted Claude Lecourbe's corps to be detached to Italy after the initial battles, but Moreau had other plans.Arnold, 199-201 Through a series of complicated maneuvers in which he flanked, double flanked, and reflanked Kray's army, Moreau's army lay on the eastern slope of the Black Forest, while portions of Kray's army was still guarded the passes on the other side.W.M. Sloane, Life of Napoleon. France, 1896, p. 109. Battles at Engen and Stockach were fought on 3 May 1800 between the army of the French First Republic under Jean Victor Marie Moreau and the army of Habsburg Austria led by P√°l Kray. The fighting near Engen resulted in a stalemate with heavy losses on both sides. However, while the two main armies were engaged at Engen, Claude Lecourbe captured Stockach from its Austrian defenders under the Joseph, Prince of Lorraine-Vaudemont. The loss of this main supply base at Stockach compelled Kray to order a retreat to Messkirch, where they enjoyed a more favourable defensive position. It also meant, however, that any retreat by Kray into Austria via Switzerland and the Vorarlberg was cut off.Sloane, 109 Jean Victor Moreau commanded the French Army of the Rhine. On 4 and 5 May, the French launched repeated and fruitless assaults on the Messkirch. At nearby Krumbach, where the Austrians also had the superiority of position and force, the 1st Demi-Brigade took the village and the heights around it, which gave them a commanding aspect over Messkirch. Subsequently, Kray withdrew his forces to Sigmaringen, followed closely by the French. Forces At the beginning of March, Bonaparte ordered Moreau to form his army into several all-arms army corps. By 20 March 1800, Moreau organized four corps, with the last one serving as an army reserve. The Right Wing was led by Lecourbe and included four divisions. These units were General of Division Dominique Vandamme's 9,632 infantry and 540 cavalry, General of Division Joseph H√©lie D√©sir√© Perruquet de Montrichard's 6,998 infantry, General of Division Jean Thomas Guillaume Lorge's 8,238 infantry and 464 cavalry, and General of Division √âtienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty's 1,500 grenadiers and 1,280 cavalry.Smith, 177 The Center was led by General of Division Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr and comprised four divisions. These were General of Division Michel Ney's 7,270 infantry and 569 cavalry, General of Division Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers' 8,340 infantry and 542 cavalry, General of Division Jean Victor Tharreau's 8,326 infantry and 611 cavalry, and General of Brigade Nicolas Ernault des Bruslys' 2,474 light infantry and 1,616 cavalry.Smith, 178 The Left Wing was commanded by General of Division Gilles Joseph Martin Brunteau Saint-Suzanne and included four divisions. These units were General of Division Claude-Sylvestre Colaud's 2,740 infantry and 981 cavalry, General of Division Joseph Souham's 4,687 infantry and 1,394 cavalry, General of Division Claude Juste Alexandre Legrand's 5,286 infantry and 1,094 cavalry, and General of Division Henri Fran√ßois Delaborde's 2,573 infantry and 286 cavalry. fields outside Biberach an der Ris, where much of the fighting took place. In the background is the Zugspitze, the highest mountain in Germany, which lies on the border with Austria and Bavaria. Moreau personally directed the Reserve which was made up of three infantry and one cavalry divisions. These were General of Division Antoine Guillaume Delmas de la Coste's 8,635 infantry and 1,031 cavalry, General of Division Antoine Richepanse's 6,848 infantry and 1,187 cavalry, General of Division Charles Leclerc's 6,035 infantry and 963 cavalry, and General of Division Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul's 1,504 heavy cavalry. There were additional troops under Moreau's overall leadership. These included General of Division Louis-Antoine- Choin de Montchoisy's 7,715 infantry and 519 cavalry, detached to hold Switzerland. Fortresses in Alsace and along the Rhine were defended by forces under Generals of Division Fran√ßois Xavier Jacob Freytag, 2,935 infantry; Joseph Gilot, 750 cavalry; Alexandre Paul Guerin de Joyeuse de Chateauneuf- Randon, 3,430 infantry and 485 cavalry; Antoine Laroche Dubouscat, 3,001 infantry and 91 cavalry; and Jean Fran√ßois Leval, 5,640 infantry and 426 cavalry.

It is the doctrine that God created the world in seed form, with certain potentialities, which then developed or unfolded accordingly over time; what appears to be change is simply the realization of the preexisting potentialities. The theory is a metaphor of the growth of a plant: much like a planted seed eventually develops into a tree, so when God created the world he planted rationes seminales, from which all life sprung. It is intended to reconcile the belief that God created all things, with the evident fact that new things are constantly developing. The roots of this idea can be found within the Greek philosophy of the Stoics and Neoplatonism.Christoph Helmig,Forms and Concepts: Concept Formation in the Platonic Tradition, Walter de Gruyter (2012), p. 194) The idea was incorporated into Christian thought through the writings of authors such as Justin the Martyr, Athenagoras of Athens, Tertullian, Gregory of Nyssa, Augustine of Hippo, Bonaventure, Albertus Magnus, and Roger Bacon. Contemporary theistic evolutionists look to this doctrine for inspiration on the consistency of Judeo-Christian creation and the modern biological theory of evolution.

It has mostly smooth bluish grey or white bark, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds arranged in groups of seven, white flowers and cup-shaped, bell-shaped or conical fruit.flower budsfruithabit Description Eucalyptus benthamii is a tree that grows to a height of with a trunk diameter attaining and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth bluish grey or white bark which is shed in ribbons, except for about of rough brownish bark at the base of the trunk. The leaves on young plants and on coppice regrowth are arranged in opposite pairs, egg-shaped to heart-shaped, long, wide and sessile. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to curved, long, wide on a petiole long and the same colour on both sides. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven on a peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on a pedicel up to long. Mature buds are oval, long, wide with a rounded operculum. Flowering occurs between March and September and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped, bell- shaped or conical capsule long and wide. Camden white gum is related to E. viminalis. Eucalyptus dorrigoensis is a species from the Dorrigo Plateau that was previously classified as a subspecies of E. benthamii, but does not appear especially related. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus benthamii was first formally described by Joseph Maiden and Richard Hind Cambage in 1915 from a specimen collected \\"from the banks of the Nepean River near Cobbity\\". The description was published in Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales. Maiden and Cambage did not give a reason for the specific epithet (benthamii) but it is assumed to honour George Bentham. Distribution and habitat Camden white gum grows on alluvial plains on sand or loam over clay along the Nepean River and its tributaries, in tall open forest, where it either forms a pure stand or is found with other eucalypts such as mountain blue gum (E. deanei) and river peppermint (E. elata). Other associated trees include grey box (E. moluccana), forest red gum (E. tereticornis), grey gum (E. punctata), cabbage gum (E. amplifolia), narrow-leaved ironbark (E. crebra) and broad-leaved apple (Angophora subvelutina), while associated understory species include blackthorn (Bursaria spinosa), bracken (Pteridium esculentum) tantoon (Leptospermum polygalifolium) and fern-leaved wattle (Acacia filicifolia). Conservation This eucalypt is classified as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the New South Wales Government Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016. It is known from two main populations, one near the Kedumba River in the Blue Mountains National Park, the other at Bents Basin State Recreation Area south of Wallacia. Scattered trees are found around Camden, Cobbity and in Nattai National Park. Some 10,000 trees are estimated to grow at Kedumba and about 400 at Bents Basin. Land clearing and the flooding of most of its distribution to create Warragamba Dam have severely impacted its population. Use in horticulture Camden white gum is a fast- growing and adaptable tree in cultivation and is being investigated in South Africa and South America for pulpwood plantations.

In the early 17th century it was acquired by Niccol√≤ dell'Antella, together with a nearby one: he commissioned the repainting of the two fa√ßades, executed in 1619-1620 by a group of artists (including Domenico Passignano, Matteo Rosselli, Ottavio Vannini and others) under the direction of Giovanni da San Giovanni, and the design of architect Giulio Parigi. The painted decoration consists of a series of panels with allegorical representations, puttos, flowers, vegetable motifs and arabesques. At the centre is the bust of Cosimo II de' Medici. As they become closer to the church of Santa Croce, the windows are nearer to each other, in order to provide an illusory enlargement of the fa√ßade.

Similar to the agreement with the Lakers, the Galaxy also has supplementary programming featured on the networks, including a weekly team magazine, and possible classic matches. Prior to the network launch, Anaheim-based independent station KDOC-TV (channel 56) televised 18 Galaxy matches for the 2012 MLS season, with production handled by Time Warner Cable SportsNet. The new network then televised the remainder of the Galaxy's schedule beginning in October 2012. (KDOC also televised select matches featuring the Galaxy's former stadium-mate and crosstown rival, Chivas USA, until that team was folded after the 2014 season.) Much like the Lakers, the Galaxy formerly maintained a long-standing broadcast agreement with Fox Sports West and Prime Ticket. =Los Angeles Sparks= On March 14, 2012, it was announced that the channel had signed a multi-year deal with the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks franchise.Time Warner Cable Sports Dunks Multiyear Rights Deal with WNBA's LA Sparks Multichannel News, March 14, 2012 Although the deal was reported as being non-exclusive, all of the televised games during the 2013 season aired on TWC SportsNet, except for those that were nationally broadcast on ABC, ESPN or ESPN2 (as with the Galaxy, KDOC aired the 2012 schedule in preparation for the launch of the new channels). Since the 2018 WNBA Season, because of the Las Vegas Aces hold territorial rights for all of Southern Nevada, Los Angeles Sparks games are blacked out in the Las Vegas Valley on Spectrum SportsNet regardless of the cable or satellite provider, requiring a subscription to the WNBA League Pass out-of-market sports package to view those telecasts. All other sports programming, with the exception of Sparks basketball games carried on Spectrum SportsNet, is available in Southern Nevada. =Los Angeles Dodgers= On January 23, 2013, Time Warner Cable and the Los Angeles Dodgers reached a deal to create a new channel called SportsNet LA, which would become the exclusive local carrier of the Major League Baseball franchise's games starting with the 2014 season. Time Warner Cable outbid Fox Sports Net for the contract, which runs for 25 years through 2039 and is estimated to be worth $8.35 billion. At the time of the announcement, the team was supposed to be considering offering a package of games to be aired over Fox Television Stations' two Los Angeles outlets, Fox owned-and-operated station KTTV (channel 11) and MyNetworkTV owned-and- operated station KCOP-TV. =Los Angeles Chargers= On August 2, 2018, Spectrum SportsNet announced a content and programming partnership agreement with the NFL's Los Angeles Chargers to deliver a new documentary series, Backstage: Chargers. A bi-weekly all-access half-hour series chronicling the LA Chargers games, players and executives from a behind-the-scenes perspective during the team's season. Bi-weekly episodes will also re-air on the Chargers local TV partner, KCBS-TV (CBS 2) and on Facebook Watch. Starting with the 2020 NFL Season, because of the Las Vegas Raiders hold territorial rights for all of Southern Nevada, Los Angeles Chargers‚Äô programming and preseason games are blacked out in the Las Vegas Valley on Spectrum SportsNet regardless of the cable or satellite provider. =Other sports programming rights= Spectrum SportsNet also airs live broadcasts of the football and boys' basketball championship games of the California Interscholastic Federation and Los Angeles City Section, the CIF state championship games in boys' and girls' basketball, and the regional and state bowl games in football. It also carries select games of the Lakers-owned NBA G League team, the South Bay Lakers. Spectrum Deportes also aired Pro Footvolley Tour. For the 2012‚Äì13 athletic season, Spectrum SportsNet aired select football and men's basketball games from the Mountain West Conference that were not televised on a national basis; one or both of the teams playing in nearly all of the telecasts that the network aired that season involved the San Diego State Aztecs and the University of Nevada Las Vegas Rebels, both universities are in the network's primary service area. It lost the rights to Mountain West games beginning with the 2013-14 season due to new broadcast agreements signed by the conference; some SDSU games that are not nationally televised are now carried on Fox Sports San Diego, while some UNLV games are seen on AT&T; SportsNet Rocky Mountain. Since the 2012-13 athletic season, Spectrum SportsNet aired select men's basketball games from the West Coast Conference that were not televised on a national basis. Three universities (Loyola Marymount Lions, Pepperdine Waves, and San Diego Toreros) are in the network's primary service area. Spectrum SportsNet has also aired the NBC program Poker After Dark and some action sports events, while airs a weekly lucha libre card taped in Mexico City. For the 2014 MLS season, Spectrum Deportes agreed to carry Chivas USA matches in Spanish that are not televised on a national network in their final season before the team disbands.

Leadership style  Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak was a very strong leader whose word was generally accepted by the French. However, sometimes he had his reasons for giving very limited protection to the French merchants and even less protection to the French missionaries, whom he regarded as spies of the French administration in Senegal and the French government in Paris. This rumour was first circulated by his predecessor ‚Äî Maad a Sinig Ama Joof Gnilane Faye Joof,Klein, p 51 who stopped the French from building any bricked chapel or church in his Kingdom. During the first few years of Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak's reign, the Mission at N'Gasobil faced constant harassments designed to force their departure. The people were not only ordered not to sell anything to the mission, but also not to send their children to Christian schools in fear that the mission would corrupt the minds of the young.Klein, Martin A., Islam and Imperialism in Senegal Sine-Saloum, 1847‚Äì1914, p. 52. Edinburgh University Press (1968) In 1856, Father Lamoise and Kobes (accompanied by French officers) went to Sine to see Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak. They presented their complaints to the king about the constant harassments which began during the reign of Maad Ama Joof Gnilane Faye Joof. Lamoise also used the meeting to seek the king's permission to build a brick chapel. Permission was not granted. Lamoise threatened to build a brick chapel with or without the king's permission. Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak threatened to kill Lamoise if he dared to disobey his orders. Nothing was achieved by the French in that meeting.Klein, p 53 Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene was related to the other Senegambian royal families (Jolof, Cayor, Baol, Waalo and Saloum) and was known for giving asylum to the royal families of those kingdoms, so much so that the French governor of Senegal at the time‚ÄîPinet Laprade used to refer to him as \\"the King of Kings.\\"le Quotidien, La communaut√© s√©r√®re face √† la Commission nationale charg√©e de la r√©daction de l‚Äôhistoire du S√©n√©gal (18 September 2019)  Siege of Kaolack  In 1866, the French governor √âmile Pinet-Laprade tried to encourage resettlement around Kaolack (a province of the Kingdom of Saloum) and promised to restore order and trade there. He failed to achieve that. Kaolack which was previously sacked by the Muslim marabouts in 1865 falls within the jurisdiction of Saloum, ruled by the Maad Saloum (king of Saloum), and not by the Maad a Sinig (king of Sine). It was part of the jurisdiction of Maad Saloum Fakha Boya Latsouka Fall. The King of Sine (Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak) was not willing to persuade his people to settle in a war zone.Klein, p 87 Laprade (and his predecessors Faidherbe and Jaur√©guib√©ry) who previously had nothing good to say about the Serers, referring to them \\"drunkards\\" and \\"violent against the Muslims\\" now needed Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak's assistance to solve the problem in Kaolack. He wrote several letters to Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak begging him to do something.Klein, pp 79, 87 To secure the support of Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak, Laprade changed his strategy by calling the Muslim marabouts \\"thieves\\". When Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak tried to offer help to the King of Saloum (Fakha Boya Latsouka Fall), the King of Saloum turned him down and refused to listen to him. According to some (such as Klein, B√¢, etc.), Fakha Boya was a weak king who was unwilling or unable to solve the Kaolack problem, his own province. However, the consensus is that, the sacking of Kaolack by the marabout forces would not have happened without Laprade. It was Laprade who initially asked Fakha Boya whether he could withdraw his army from the Kaolack post for a short period so that trade could resume with the marabouts. That was after he tried and failed to conquer the Kingdom of Saloum. When King Fakha Boya withdrew his army from the Kaolack post, Laprade immediately informed Maba Diakhou Ba in July 1864 that the army of Fakha Boya had left and he can come back. When the marabout came, they ransacked and looted Kaolack and virtually control it. As the situation worsened in Kaolack, Maad Fakha Boya lost all control in Kaolack, and the marabouts were no longer willing to listen to Laprade. As such, Laprade lost all influence he had on the marabouts and needed Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak's assistance to deal with the problem.Klein, pp 82, 87  Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak against the Muslim marabouts  Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak resisted against French expansionism, and the strategy of the French to use him against Maba Diakhou B√¢. According to some, had he accepted the French's terms and strategy, Maba would have been killed in the 1850s. √âmile Pinet-Laprade mistook that for cowardice which was not the case.Klein, p 89 However in 1867, Maba Diakhou who had avoided the animist Kingdom of Sine for six years decided to launch a jihad in the Sine. The British administration in the Gambia and the French administration in Senegal had both tried to get rid of Maba Diakhou when relations broke down, but failed. Governor George Abbas Kooli D'Arcy (the British governor in the Gambia) was arming Maba and the marabout forces with British weapons.Klein, pp 82, 87-88 He also planned and executed the invasion of the Mandinka animist State of Baddibu in the Gambia in a revenge attack against the British traders by animist Baddibu. D'Arcy planned his invasion to coincide with the French's unsuccessful invasion of animist Serer Saloum in 1861.Klein, pp 71, 146-147 Almost a week after Maba's victory in Kaolack, a large group of his disciples entered Sine. Maba himself did not enter Sine. The battle was indecisive as the marabout forces withdrew when they realised that they could not penetrate Sine.Klein, p 90 = The surprise of Mbin o Ngor (Mbetaan Keur Ngor) = Mbin o Ngor (var: Mbon o NGOOR) is a small Serer village in Sine. The Surprise of Mbin o Ngor in 1867 was not an open battle. It was a surprise attack by the marabouts against the Serer community of this village. The Wolof term for it is \\"Mbetaan Keur Ngor\\" which means \\"the surprise attack of Keur Ngor\\". \\"Mbetaan\\" means surprise. In the Serer language, the incident is known as \\"Mbin o Ngor\\".L'epopee de Sanmoon Fay. Ethiopiques n¬∞54 revue semestrielle de culture n√©gro-africaine Nouvelle s√©rie volume 7 2e semestre 1991Sarr, pp 37-38 In the Serer oral tradition, the incident occurred on a Wednesday. In those days taxes were collected on Wednesdays. That day Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak also attended the funeral of one of his warriors. It was the funeral of Dy√© Tyass, one of the warriors of Sine. Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak and his entourage were also later obliged to participate in the final phase of the ceremony of the newly circumcised young boys of Somb. This festival is one of the last phases of the initiation were they perform a dance before the king and the rest of the royal family who in turn give them gifts for their courage. The funeral of Dy√© Tyass coincided with this ceremony and the King's secretary was told by the King to inform the initiates he will meet them later at Mbin o Ngor after the funeral at Dielem.L'epopee de Sanmoon Fay.

Tome 38, S√©rie B, n¬∞ 4, octobre 1976,pp 20-22 Lat Dior who is reported to have had a long grudge against Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak after his defeat and exile by the French administration at the Battle of Loro (January 12, 1864) sought refuge in Sine. Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak granted him asylum. Oral tradition says Lat Dior was well received in Sine. Lat Dior also needed military support from Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak in order to launch a war against the French and regain his throne. Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak was unable to provide military support to Lat Dior, because he was involved in a long battle against the French administration regarding the sovereignty of Joal (a province of Sine). Lat Dior sought military support from Maba. Maba promised to help Lat Dior if he converts to Islam. Lat Dior converted to Islam, and in 1867, persuaded Maba to launch a jihad in the Kingdom of Sine.Diouf, Niokhobaye. pp 726-727 There is no consensus as to whether Maba went to Mbin o Ngor or not. Serer oral sources gives detailed account of the incident, incriminating several prominent members of the marabout movement some of which include Lat Dior and Gumbo Gaye. Serer oral tradition says that Maba went to Mbin o Ngor and it was he who killed Boucary Ngoneh Joof (many variations: Boucar Ngon√© Diouf - a cousin of Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak who is reported to have sacrificed his life in the incident in order to preserve the honour of Sine). Muslim marabout oral sources agree pretty much with Serer sources, except that Maba did not go to Mbin o Ngor (Keur Ngor, in Wolof). When Maat Kumba Ndoffene Famak finally managed to mobilize the army of Sine, the marabout army retreated. However, before their retreat, they had managed to cause serious damage in Sine and kidnapped some prominent princesses of Sine including the daughter of Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak (Lingeer Selbeh Ndoffene Joof). During her abduction, Lingeer Selbeh Ndoffene was given in marriage to Abdoulaye Wuli B√¢ (brother of Maba). A 19th-century royal war drum, called junjung in Serer. It was played when Serer kings and warriors went to war. From the Kingdom of Sine, now part of Senegal. = The Battle of Fandane- Thiouthioune (Somb) = After the surprise attack at Mbin o Ngor, Maad Kumba Ndoffene Famak wrote a letter to Maba Diakhou B√¢ telling him that the surprise attack he launched in Sine was undignified and invited him to an open battle. On 18 July 1867, Maba and his army came. In this battle - The Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune (commonly known as the Battle of Somb), Maba Diakhou B√¢ was defeated. He died in this battle and his body was decapitated. Maba's brother (Abdoulaye Wuli B√¢) was not killed in this battle. He was castrated.Sarr, pp 37-40Diouf, Niokhobaye. pp 726-730Diouf, Cheikh.

Process monitoring falls under the overall evaluation of a program. Program evaluation involves answering questions about a social program in a systematic way. Examples of social programs include school feeding programs, job training in a community and out-patient services of a community health care facility. Questions about a social program can be asked by program sponsors, developers, policymakers and even taxpayers who want to determine whether or not a particular program is effective.O‚ÄôSullivan, R. G. (2004). Practicing Evaluation: A Collaborative Approach. London: Sage Publications More specifically, purposes of social programs include identifying a programs‚Äô strengths and weaknesses, assessing the impact of a program, justifying the need for additional resources and responding to attacks on a program, among others.  Process monitoring  Apart from measuring the needs, inputs and outcomes of a program, evaluations also monitor the process of a program. According to Rossi, P. H., Lipsey, M. W. & Freeman, H. E. (2004). Evaluation: A Systematic Approach (7th ed.) London: Sage Publications(p. 171), program process monitoring \\"is the systematic and continual documentation of [the] key aspects of program performance that assesses whether the program is performing as intended or according to some appropriate standard.\\" Therefore, program process monitoring involves a systematic and continuous way of monitoring certain aspects of a program's process which would indicate how well the program is performing, if at all. These activities help to facilitate the effective management of the program because continuous assessment allows for regular feedback about the program's performance. to  Tools for data gathering  Management Information Systems (MIS) are tools often used by evaluators to monitor the performance of the program. An MIS is a compilation of data regarding the services that are routinely provided by the program, the staff that have provided the services, the treatments that have been provided and the costs involved in the program. Many evaluators use MISs as their major source of data when monitoring the process of a program because MISs contain all the relevant information about the program that is needed for an assessment.  Process monitoring from various perspectives  The specific activities that form part of the monitoring process are aimed at generating information that is appropriate from the perspective of the consumer group, who the monitoring is for. Three key consumer groups are discussed below: = From an accountability perspective = Due to outside funding, program managers need to provide regular information to funders and program sponsors about the implementation of the program, problems that have been encountered and how these were handled. Program managers are accountable for and how the program is run, which leads to either the success or failure of the program. = From a management perspective = From a management perspective, process monitoring is not only aimed at finding out how the program is going, but it is also aimed at putting in place corrective measures to ensure that the program performs as it should. In this case, process monitoring can take place during the pilot testing of the program in order to find ways of dealing with unexpected problems. Management-oriented monitoring can also take place in already-developed programs in order to obtain information about the performance of the program and whether or not the target population is being reached by the planned intervention. = From an evaluators perspective = In order to evaluate the outcomes of a program, the evaluator first needs to monitor the process in order to assess the implementation of the intervention. The reason for this is that many program failures are due to failures in the implementation of the program. Therefore, in order to determine whether or not the planned outcomes have been reached, the evaluator needs to assess how the intervention was implemented.  Program process evaluation  Program process evaluation is an assessment of how the program is performing in terms of service utilisation and program organisation. Service utilisation examines program coverage in terms of intended services for the intended target population whereas program organisation looks at whether services provided are the ones actually laid down in the program.  Monitoring service utilisation  According to Valadez, J., Bamberger, M. (1994). Monitoring and Evaluating Social Programs in Developing Countries: A Handbook for Policymakers, Managers, and Researchers EDI Development Studies, The World Bank: USA(p. 136), an objective of many program projects is to ensure that project services or benefits reach a certain target population - defined in terms of its geographic, economic, or demographic characteristics. What is critical in program process monitoring is determining whether intended targets actually receive program services intended for them in the plan. This is of paramount importance especially in programs that are voluntary, that involve behaviour change, taking of instructions or learning of new procedures. = Coverage and bias = Coverage refers to the extent to which a program reaches its intended target population whereas bias is the extent to which subgroups of a target population are reached unequally by a program (p. 200). The aim of all programs is total coverage but very few social programs ever achieve total coverage, making bias an issue. Causes of bias are, among others,: * self- selection: participation of some groups more frequently than others; * program actions: acting favourably to some subgroups while rejecting others; and * creaming: selecting most success-prone targets. Some programs can experience overcoverage, whereby the program captures numbers far exceeding the intended targets (e.g. feeding schemes). Depending on the nature of the program, overcoverage can be costly and problematic (e.g. social grants). However, most programs fail to achieve high target participation, either because of bias in the way targets are recruited or retained or because potential clients are unaware of the program, are unable to use it, or reject it.(p. 185). = Measuring and monitoring coverage = Overcoverage and undercoverage are basic concerns in program implementation and should be measured and monitored to ascertain the extent of their effect on service utilisation. Efficient service utilisation requires that the program serve as many people as possible who are in need and very few who are not in need. A drawback to this exercise is that people may distort information so as to be eligible for the project . identified three sources of information that can be used to assess the extent to which a program is serving the appropriate target population: * program records; * surveys of program participants; and * community surveys. = Assessing bias = In assessing bias, questions like: Do all eligible individuals participate in the program? Are there any dropouts? What is the dropout rate? What are the causes of non-participation or dropout?, could be asked. Information obtained from answers to these questions is valuable in judging the effectiveness, worth and possible modification of the program to suit the needs of the target population. The same methods of data collection mentioned under 'measuring and monitoring coverage' could be used to assess bias.

Public education in Honduras is provided free for children aged 6 to 15 where it is mandatory for children to attend at the primary level (Age 6 to 12). The Honduran Constitution moreover stipulates that parents have the right to choose the education ; whether free or private, of their children. World Bank statistics put the adult literacy rate (% of people ages 15 and above) of Honduras at 83.6%. However, UNESCO statistics reveal a 12% repeater rate, and only an 80% progression and completion rate in primary education. Moreover, only 64.5% enroll for secondary education.  Poverty  Poverty is rife in Honduras, with the poverty headcount ratio at national poverty line standing at 60% as of 2010. In typical situations, children have to quit school permanently to work at an early age to help support their families. Even though school is fully state-subsidized up till the 5th grade, many children are still unable to attend school because their families can not afford to buy uniforms and school supplies. A study conducted in 2006 by National Institute of Statistics estimated that as many as 368,000 of the 1.7 million children ages five to 12 did not receive schooling in that year.  Gender inequality  Honduras is a patriarchal society, and males are favoured over females when it comes to education. While parents may send both genders to primary school; the females are likely the first to be withdrawn to help at home and made to work to provide income. This is further supported by the belief that occupational opportunities resulting from education are greater for males, as females have greater difficulty in finding jobs that match their academic credentials even if they have the same education level. Both genders have equal access to the limited available educational facilities; however, attendance rates for females were slightly lower than for males.  Education infrastructure  The quality of the curriculum in Honduran public schools is poor, evidenced by the fact that for much of the last century, Honduran students were required to memorize useless or impractical data at the expense of sharpening their reasoning powers and critical thinking skills. Teachers are paid low wages, they do not have access to effective teaching materials, and they are not trained in the latest technologies and current teaching methods. In addition, there is a scarcity of teachers, with a teacher:student ratio of 1:33 in 2008. The destruction of over 3000 schools nationwide caused by Hurricane Mitch further weakened the country‚Äôs poor education infrastructure.

Specific coins mentioned in the Bible include the widow's mite, the tribute penny and the thirty pieces of silver, though it is not always possible to identify the exact coin that was used. Widow's mite The coin referred to in the lesson of the widow's mite was a lepton, the smallest and least valuable coin in circulation in Judea. A denarius of Tiberius Tribute penny The tribute penny was the coin that was shown to Jesus when he made his famous speech \\"Render unto Caesar...\\" It is usually thought that the coin was a Roman denarius with the head of Tiberius. However, it has been suggested that the coin may have instead been an Antiochan tetradrachm bearing the head of Tiberius, with Augustus on the reverse or the denarius of Augustus with Caius and Lucius on the reverse. Coins of Julius Caesar, Mark Antony and Germanicus are also considered possibilities. Coin in the fish's mouth The coin in the fish's mouth mentioned in Matthew 17 is usually thought to be a Tyrian shekel. Thirty pieces of silver According to the Gospel of Matthew 26:15, the price for which Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus was thirty pieces of silver. Scholars disagree on the identity of the coins involved. Donald Wiseman suggests two possibilities for the identity of the coins used to pay Judas. They may have been tetradrachms of Tyre, usually referred to as Tyrian shekels (about 1.38 troy ounces), or they may have been staters from Antioch, which bore the head of Augustus.D. J. Wiseman, Illustrations from Biblical Archaeology (London: Tyndale Press, 1958), 87‚Äì89. Alternatively, they may have been Ptolemaic tetradrachms.

Frizis and his wife, Victoria Costi Frizis was born in Chalcis, on the island of Euboea, to a Romaniote-Jewish family, one of 12 children born to Jacob and Iopi Frizis. After studying law at Athens University, he enlisted in the Greek Army in 1916, and went to officer training school. He fought in World War I on the Macedonian front, and participated in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, and becoming a Second Lieutenant in 1919. In 1922, as a newly promoted First Lieutenant, he took part in the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922). He was taken prisoner, and as the only non-Christian Greek officer taken prisoner by the Turks during the campaign, was offered his freedom, but refused and elected to remain with his comrades, enduring eleven months of captivity. Memorial to Mordechai Frizis After the war, Frizis was promoted to Captain, and was sent to Paris to study at √âcole Militaire. Upon his return to Greece, he was promoted to Major and posted to the Third Army Corps based in Thessaloniki. During World War II, Frizis, now a Colonel, participated in the Greco-Italian War, and succeeded in repelling an Italian attack on the bridge of the Thyamis River, followed up by a Greek counterattack. When the Italians countered with aerial bombing, his men dismounted and took cover in trenches, while he continued riding his horse throughout the battlefield and shouting \\"courage\\" to rally his men, but was severely wounded in the stomach, but continued trying to rally his men. When the Italian aircraft withdrew, it was discovered that he had died of his injuries.A Jewish Soldier In Greece Following his death in action, the King of Greece, its then leader, Ioannis Metaxas, and a national newspaper left tributes for the officer. A spokesman for King George II of Greece wrote to Frizis' family: \\"On the glorious death for his country of your beloved husband, the heroic Colonel Mordechai Frizis, His Majesty the king has instructed me to convey to you and your family his deepest condolences\\". Ioannis Metaxas, then Prime Minister of Greece, wrote the following letter to Frizis' wife: \\"I learnt of the death on the field of honour of your husband, before you knew of it and I did not know how to inform you. You and your family as well as those families, who have lost their protectors, will become the families of this state of ours. Please be assured that the protection of Greece will never leave you or your children. The children of Colonel Frizis will be revered by our nation's youth. With feelings of honour and love\\". The Greek state has honoured his memory by erecting busts of his at the War Museums of Kalpaki and Athens, in his birth town of Chalcis, and by giving his name to an Athens street.

Movie World on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. The ride is themed after DC Comics' Green Lantern and is located within the park's DC Comics superhero hub. The ride is an El Loco roller coaster manufactured by S&S; ‚Äì Sansei Technologies, characterised by a tight circuit featuring a beyond-vertical drop and an outward banked turn. When it opened in 2011, it held the record for having the second steepest drop in the world among roller coasters, and the steepest drop in the Southern Hemisphere, the latter of which is a record it still holds as of 2020. Green Lantern Coaster officially opened on 23 December 2011. History In May 2011, preliminary groundwork began on a plot of land in front of Warner Bros. Movie World. On 31 July 2011, the firm announced a multimillion-dollar attraction coming before Christmas 2011. In early September, pieces of S&S; ‚Äì Sansei Technologies roller coaster track began appearing in the car park. On 13 September 2011, Warner Bros. Movie World began releasing cropped images of the ride's concept art. } } } On 17 September 2011, the final clues were released before the official announcement that evening. It was announced that the Green Lantern Coaster would feature the steepest drop in the Southern Hemisphere. Also on 17 September 2011, the DC Super Heroes Store opened adjacent to Batman Adventure: The Ride 2, Batwing Spaceshot and Green Lantern Coaster. By early October, most of the support structure and the lift hill were complete. By the end of October, the ride's construction was complete and work had begun on the entrance pathway. In early November, six trains arrived on site. Another was showcased by S&S; ‚Äì Sansei Technologies at the 2011 IAAPA Attractions Expo. Kevin Rohwer, an S&S; ‚Äì Sansei Technologies spokesman, stated that the ride would be ready on 15 December 2011. On 28 November 2011, testing began. The ride entered a soft opening phase on 16 December 2011, before its official opening on 23 December 2011. =Drop angle= When the Green Lantern Coaster was announced, few details were released about the ride's drop angle other than it would be the Southern Hemisphere's steepest. On 2 November, Warner Bros. Movie World announced via Facebook that the ride would have a drop angle of 120¬∞. On 27 November, Warner Bros. Movie World released the television commercial, which promoted that the ride would have the steepest drop in the world. Later that day they confirmed the drop would be 122.4¬∞ instead of the originally announced 120¬∞. Following the soft opening television commercials began advertising the ride. On 20 December, Warner Bros. Movie World revised the angle yet again to 120.5¬∞; this was the final measurement given. Only Takabisha exceeded it with a drop of 121¬∞. Characteristics Green Lantern Coaster is an El Loco roller coaster manufactured by S&S; ‚Äì Sansei Technologies. Warner Bros. Movie World collaborated with S&S; ‚Äì Sansei Technologies to develop an coaster that was unlike the previous models (Mumbo Jumbo, Steel Hawg and Timber Drop). =Trains= The coaster's seven trains double the capacity of the traditional El Loco ride from 4 seats per train to 8 seats per train. The trains are articulated in such a way that the first row of four riders moves independently from the second row. Each seat features a pair of stereo speakers in the head rest. These speakers are capable of playing multiple tracks for up to 9 minutes on a single charge. Riders are harnessed to the ride through the use of lap bars. The front of each car features a pulsing LED Green Lantern logo while the back of each car features the Green Lantern oath. All of these operational and thematic characteristics are new for this type of ride and were developed specifically for this coaster. =Statistics= Green Lantern Coaster features of track on which riders reach speeds of up to and experience 3.5 Gs. The ride features a first drop with an angle of 120.5¬∞ ranking it the steepest drop in the Southern Hemisphere and the second steepest in the world. The track and structure, which weigh approximately , were shipped to Australia from Italy and China, respectively, in twenty-five shipping containers. =Theme= The Green Lantern Coaster is themed around the Green Lantern series of comic books that originated in 1940. This theme is showcased throughout the ride's queue and the station. The ride's theming was developed by Sculpt Studios. Experience Green Lantern Coaster from the Warner Bros. Movie World car parking lot. One of the trains can be seen near the top of the ride about to proceed down the first drop. =Queue= The queue begins adjacent to the DC Super Heroes Store, opposite Batwing Spaceshot. The queue weaves its way alongside the park's original boundary wall. Along this route several billboards inform guests of the story behind the Green Lantern. Riders turn left and enter a courtyard featuring 2D cutouts of villains as well as a 3D model of the Green Lantern. The queue turns left again and follows an upwards path to the station. =Ride= Green Lantern Coaster begins with a U-turn out of the station. It ascends a chain lift hill before going down a small dip and into an s-bend followed by a U-turn. After a slight ascent, the car enters a 120.5¬∞ drop ‚Äì the steepest in the southern hemisphere. The track then returns to approximately two thirds of its original height before entering the first set of block brakes. These brakes lead into a left turn with reverse or outward banking. It then drops under the block brakes and into the first inversion ‚Äì a Dive Loop. The inversion begins with half of an inline twist which transitions into half of a vertical loop. Upon exiting the inversion the track inclines into a second set of block brakes. The train then goes around a right U-turn and into the second inversion ‚Äì a downwards inline twist. This leads into a cutback-style turnaround before entering the final brake run and returning to the station. =Exit= Upon the completion of the ride, guests exit via a path that runs under the lift hill and alongside the park's boundary before returning to the DC Super Heroes Store. Inside guests can purchase a variety of merchandise related to Green Lantern, Batman and Superman. Reception Village Roadshow Theme Parks, the owners of Warner Bros. Movie World attributed a rise in attendance to the opening of the Green Lantern Coaster. The company labelled the launch of the ride as a success. The attraction's downtime has been reported several times by local media, however, this behaviour is not unusual for amusement rides. Green Lantern Coaster, along with other El Loco roller coasters, ranked 182 out of the 365 steel roller coasters in the worldwide Best Roller Coaster Poll for 2012. Incidents On 15 March 2015, one car of a train became detached from rails when a wheel mechanism broke. A Queensland Fire Service Inspector described it as \\"a fairly catastrophic failure of the carriage\\" that was the \\"first time we'd ever seen the actual failure of the machinery\\". An investigation revealed that there was a design flaw in the wheel assembly dealing with a bolted joint, and that there was \\"really nothing that Movie World could have done to prevent it. S&S; ‚Äì Sansei Technologies redesigned the flawed components, and tested the ride, before it reopened to the public on 16 December 2015.

Its modern name is a name shared with the neighbouring province of the Netherlands, with which it was for a while politically united (under French and then Dutch rule from 1794 until 1839). And in turn both of these provinces received their modern name only after 1815, based upon the name of the medieval Duchy of Limburg, which had actually been in what is now neighbouring Wallonia, centred upon the town of Limbourg on the Vesdre. 350px For much of its recorded history, most of what is now called Belgian Limburg was known as Loon (French Looz). Loon was a medieval county, and when the line of the Counts died the county became a lordship held by the Prince-bishop of Li√®ge. It was still often referred to as the \\"land of Loon\\" (land van Loon in Dutch). The original capital of medieval Loon is today officially called Borgloon, but the capital of the modern province is now Hasselt. The medieval connection between Limburg and Li√®ge was influenced by old Roman administrative divisions. In Roman times, Belgian Limburg, and probably also the Dutch province of Limburg and the medieval Duchy of Limburg, were in the Civitas Tungrorum, which had its original capital in Tongeren, which is in Belgian Limburg. As in neighbouring regions, the Roman regional capital became the church capital in the middle ages, but this was then moved to a more defensive position on a river, in this case to Li√®ge. Prehistoric Belgian Limburg in the ice ages is assumed, like neighbouring areas of Europe, to have been home to dispersed populations of nomadic hunter gatherers including Neanderthals and later waves of \\"Anatomically modern humans\\". Upper and middle paleolithic finds in Limburg are not common compared to findings to the south in the Wallonian province of Li√®ge. In the upper paleolithic archaeological finds also become more common in Limburg. In general terms, the area was part of the broadly defined cultural group known as the Magdalenian (17,000 BP to 9,000 BP), and then the Azilian. The particular type of Azilian was known as the Tjongerian, which is in turn part of the Federmesser group of Azilian cultures. Tjongerian finds have been made in Lommel, Zolder, and Zonhoven, on the southern edge of the sandy Campine lowlands in the north of the province. In the younger Dryas, Limburg was inhabited first by the Ahrensburg culture, evidence of which has been found in Zonhoven. Later, the Tardenoisian culture was shared with all neighbouring areas (Brabant, the Netherlands, and Wallonia). It apparently arrived from France. One such site is in Ruiterskuil in Opglabbeek. The Neolithic begins with the first farmers in the area who belonged to the LBK culture, arriving around 5000 BCE from the east, and remaining mainly in the south of Belgian Limburg, especially the southeastern corner of the province, between Tongeren and Maastricht. The sandy northern Campine lowlands were clearly not successful for them. Finds in neighbouring Dutch Limburg and Wallonia are more widely distributed. This was one of the westernmost colonizations of this first wave of farmers in northern Europe, and also a point of contact between farming and local non-farming cultures. So called Limburg pottery is a particular style associated with this western LBK culture, which is also associated with La Hoguette pottery and stretches into northern France. It has sometimes been argued that these technologies are the result of pottery technology spreading beyond the original LBK farming population, and being made by hunter gatherers. Another remarkable aspect of this version of the LBK culture is that some settlements show signs of being fortified, implying the threat of violence. The sandy north of Limburg appears to have become a contact area for hunter gatherers of the Swifterbant culture, who traded with the farmers. The LBK culture appears to have disappeared from the area around 4000 BCE. Around 500 years later, in a second phase of the Neolithic of the area, the Michelsberg culture appeared in the region. It was a relatively less sedentary culture, which once again showed signs of concerns with fortification. A similar Michelsberg culture appeared in the Rhineland of Germany, and it also appears to be related to the Chass√©en culture in northern France. But the Michelsberg in Belgium had distinct local features. If it developed locally, local hunters and gatherers may have played a role, but archaeological evidence is so far inconclusive about what happened. This culture was apparently able to spread into the Campine, or at least influence it more. During this period, there are stronger signs that the hunter-gatherer Swifterbant cultures of these areas were becoming involved in pottery and farming themselves. In the third and late fourth millennia BCE, the whole of Flanders shows relatively little evidence of human habitation. Although it is felt that there was a continuing human presence, the types of evidence available make judgement about the details very difficult. To the south of Belgian Limburg, the Seine-Oise-Marne culture spread into the nearby Ardennes, and is associated with megalithic sites there. To the north and east, in the Netherlands, a semi-sedentary culture group has been proposed to have existed, the so-called Vlaardingen-Wartburg-Stein complex, which possibly developed from the above-mentioned Swifterbant and Michelsburg cultures. The same pattern continues into the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age. In the last part of the Neolithic, evidence is found for the Corded Ware and Bell Beaker cultures in neighboring Dutch Limburg, but much less in Belgian Limburg. During the early and middle Bronze Age, Belgian Limburg is often considered to have been in the zone where the Hilversum culture lived, but finds are not in Belgian Limburg itself. This was a culture found in the southern and central Netherlands, and the Belgian coast, and is considered to be related to the contemporary Wessex culture of southern England. During the late Bronze Age, Belgian Limburg received immigrants belonging to the Urnfield culture. These cremation practicing farmers caused a population increase which included the sandy north of Limburg, where pastoralism was also practiced. It is possible that these people brought the first Indo-European languages to Belgium. As in other areas of Europe where this culture arrived, the Urnfield culture was followed by the Iron Age Halstatt and La T√®ne cultures, both associated with Celtic languages and culture. It has been suggested that the original Urnfield population of the area stayed, and that the Halstatt and La T√®ne cultures were the result of new elites moving in, with new dialects of early Indo-European. Rich La T√®ne urn burials have been found in Eigenbilzen in Haspengouw and Wijshagen (Meeuwen-Gruitrode) in the Kempen. It is likely that the various peoples and languages that the Romans found in the region had to a large extent arrived during the Bronze and Iron Ages. The Eburones who were in this area when Caesar conquered it, are associated by archaeologists with a material culture which has its roots in local variations of the Urnfield culture. It is during the late Iron Age that there is archaeological evidence for the development of a \\"Celtic field\\" system in the less fertile Campine, and increasingly social stratification and centralization, even though the area remained relatively un-developed compared to other nearby parts of Europe. Compared to surrounding areas of Europe, one remarkable thing about this pre-Roman period is the lack of hill forts, a pattern throughout all of Flanders. Only one is known in Limburg, at Caster or Castaert in Riemst, right in the southeastern corner of Limburg. In the rest of Flanders only one more is known, at Asse. The \\"Germani\\" and the \\"Belgae\\" A statue of Ambiorix faces a medieval basilica, in the main square of modern Tongeren. The only surviving written source of information which is specifically about Belgian Limburg before it became part of the Roman empire is Julius Caesar, who left a famous Commentary of his wars in the region, which were part of his Gallic campaign. In this period, this whole area, together with other areas towards the Ardennes in the south, and the Rhine to the north and east, was the homeland of one large tribal grouping known as the Germani cisrhenani, as well as a distinct tribe known as the Aduatuci. The Germani cisrhenani tribes which Caesar named where the Eburones, the Condrusi, the Paemani (or Caemani), the Caeroesi, and the Segni.\\"Gallic War\\" VI.32 The biggest and most important tribe were the Eburones, and it is they who appear to have dominated all or most of modern-day Belgian Limburg, with a territory probably stretching into the flat Campine (Dutch Kempen) northern part of this region, and also stretching into neighbouring regions of the Netherlands and Germany. The other tribes are thought to have lived further south, in what is today Wallonia, or else just over the border in Germany. The term Germani for these Belgic tribes requires explanation in order to avoid confusion. Caesar also referred to other tribes living over the east of the Rhine as Germani, and he called that region Germania, the source of the modern word Germany. He may have been the first to extend the term in this way, apparently because he was told that this is where such people came from. (Something archaeologists have not been able to confirm.) So he distinguished the Germani in the Belgic area as \\"Germani cisrhenani\\", and treated the other \\"Germani\\" as the ones living in their real homeland. Confusingly, Caesar also treated the Germani cisrhenani as Belgic Gauls, a type of people he contrasted with the Germani, and his reports suggest that they also treated themselves this way. In fact he said that not only the Germani cisrhenani, but the biggest part of the Belgae where descended from Germani from over the Rhine, so possibly he saw other northern Belgic tribes such as the neighbouring Nervii as Germani cisrhenani in a broad \\"racial\\" sense. And Tacitus, some generations after Caesar, says that the Nervii of his time still claimed such a link (see below). Concerning the question of when this supposed immigration from across the Rhine happened, it was at least some generations before Caesar. He reports that the Germani cisrhenani in the Limburg region were the only people in Gaul who had defended themselves successfully from the migrations of the Cimbri and Teutones in the second century BCE. The Aduatuci on the other hand, were descendants of those Cimbri who had been allowed to settle in a particular area within the region. So in effect Caesar used the term two different ways, and it is likely that the original narrow meaning of the word was specific to the people living in and around modern Limburg, in the later Roman Civitas Tungrorum. Whether or not any of the Belgian Germani, or indeed the Aduatuci, spoke a Germanic language is uncertain. The names of their leaders and their tribes for the most part appear to have Celtic origins, which is in fact also true of the neighbouring tribes across the Rhine in \\"Germania\\" at that time, such the Tencteri and Usipetes. On the other hand, it has been argued by Maurits Gysseling and others that placename analysis shows that a Germanic language was being spoken in this region by the 2nd century BCE, and there are also signs of an older substrate language in the Belgic region. (See Nordwestblock.) So Celtic, while influential culturally, may never have been the main language of the area. The Aduatuci and the Germani cisrhenani participated in an alliance of Belgic tribes against Caesar in 57 BCE, which was defeated at the Battle of the Sabis. Before that battle, information from the Remi, a tribe allied with Rome, stated that the Germani (the Condrusi, the Eburones, the Caeraesi, and the Paemani; but apparently not the Segni) had collectively promised, they thought, about 40,000 men. The Aduatuci had promised 19,000.\\"Gallic Wars\\" II.4 This alliance was defeated after a series of events culminating in the Battle of the Sabis. In 54 BCE, the Eburones and the Aduatuci rebelled again in alliance with the Gaulish tribes to their south and west, the Treveri and Nervii. Also concerning these powerful tribes it is difficult to be certain what language they spoke, although the Treveri are generally thought to have spoken a Celtic language. (Tacitus says of these two tribes that they were not originally Germani, but that they wished to be associated with that name and not the softer name of the Gauls.) The capital of the Eburones is named by Caesar as Aduatuca, and the capital of the region in later Roman times was Aduatuca Tungrorum (modern Tongeren). It is possible that these were the same place, except that the term \\"Aduatuca\\" may simply mean \\"fortification\\". One reason for doubt is that Caesar seems to indicate that Aduatuca was near the centre of the Eburone territory, and that the main part of this territory lay between the Meuse (Dutch Maas) and the Rhine, while Belgian Limburg lies entirely to the west of the Maas.\\"Gallic War\\" V.24 Apart from the Eburones, the Aduatuci may have lived in Belgian Limburg. Because they had a fort on large hill, and their name may even mean \\"fort people\\" it is thought that the Aduatuci lived in hilly Wallonia, but they may also have lived in southeastern Limburg, which is moderately hilly. Ambiorix, one of the two kings of the Eburones, complained to Caesar that he had to pay tribute to the Aduatuci, and that his own son and nephew were kept as captive slaves by them.\\"Gallic War\\" V.27 But once in revolt against the Romans, he rode first to the Aduatuci, and then to the Nervii, seeking their alliance.\\"Gallic War\\" V.38 After some initial success, the revolt against Caesar failed, and he conquered the area. He states that he tried to annihilate \\"the race and name of the state of the Eburones\\", for their \\"crime\\" which triggered the revolt, of having killed his lieutenants Quintus Titurius Sabinus and Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta when they demanded to be quartered amongst them for winter.\\"Gallic War\\" VI.34 Ambiorix escaped into the Ardennes, with some horse.\\"Gallic War\\" VI.33 Many others escaped towards the forests, morasses, and tidal islands of the coast. Caesar decided not to risk men in trying to pursue the rebels into such difficult countryside, and instead tried to encourage other tribes to pillage the area - a plan which back-fired when the Sicambri crossed the Rhine and decided the Roman baggage would be a much richer target than any refugees. The other king of the Eburones, Cativolcus, killed himself \\"with the juice of the yew-tree, of which there is a great abundance in Gaul and Germany\\".\\"Gallic War\\" VI.31 The name \\"Eburones\\" (like other similar Celtic-based tribal names around Europe) is based on the Celtic word for the yew tree. Roman empire This map shows the old Diocese of Li√®ge (in yellow) which evolved from the Civitas Tungrorum and probably had similar boundaries. The modern Belgian provinces of Li√®ge and Limburg are also shown. The red boundary which separates them is the modern language frontier between Dutch and French. The orange lines are modern national frontiers. Belgian Limburg in Roman times formed the central part of the large district of Civitas Tungrorum, with its capital in modern Tongeren. This district took its name from a new tribal name, the Tungri. However, according to Tacitus, writing some generations after Caesar, this tribe had originally been the first to be called the Germani, and had started using a new name, while many other tribes are started to be called Germani. This would indicate that they were the same group of tribes which had included the Eburones.\\"Germania\\" chapter 2 On the other hand, it is known that during this period, the Romans settled numerous people from across the Rhine, and these may also have made up a significant part of the ancestry of the Tungri. Under the Romans, the Tungri civitas was first a part of Gallia Belgica, and later split out, unlike their western Belgian neighbours the Menapii and Nervii, to join with the territories which lay along the militarized Rhine border to become part of Germania Inferior \\"Lower Germania\\", and still later this was reorganized to become Germania Secunda. Many of the tribal groups which inhabited the west bank of the Rhine were dominated by immigrants from the east bank. To the north of the Tungri, in the Rhine‚ÄìMeuse‚ÄìScheldt delta in the modern Netherlands were the Batavians and Frisiavones and possibly still some of the Menapii who had been there in Caesar's time. To the northeast, in the bend of the Rhine, were the Cugerni, who were probably descended from a division of the Sicambri, and probably the Baetasi also. To the east of the Tungri were the Sunici and on the Rhine the Ubii, whose city was Cologne, the provincial capital. The Tungri, along with many of the tribal states of Germania Inferior, participated in the Revolt of the Batavi. Tongeren was a major town on several notable east-west Roman routes including Amiens-Bavay-Tongeren-Maastricht-Heerlen-Cologne, which was a very important route, and Boulogne-Kortrijk-Tienen-Tongeren, which ran just to the south of the modern main road running Tienen-St Truiden-Borgloon-Tongeren, through the villages of Overhespen, Helshoven, and Bommershoven. The more fertile areas south of these roads were more heavily populated and more fully Romanized. In the sandy north of Belgian Limburg, the Romanized population thinned out dramatically in late Roman times, under pressure from constant plundering from Germanic tribes over the Rhine. Within the civitas Tungrorum, some information survives about sub-districts (pagi), each with apparent tribal names. Most of this information comes from military records, concerning units recruited from such areas. Two of the Germani tribal groups which survived from Caesar's time are that of the Condrusi, who lived in the Condroz of Wallonia, and the Caerosi who lived in the Eifel forest just over the border in modern Germany. But the only surviving name pagus which can be clearly associated with areas in and around Belgian Limburg in that of Toxandria, the district of the Toxandri, which appears to have been a large part of the civitas containing all or most of the sandy Campine region in the north. This is not one of the tribe names Caesar mentions, but some have suggested could be a Latin translation of the name Eburones, both apparently referring to Yew (Latin taxus). Others propose that this group were mainly made up of immigrants from east of the Rhine. It has also been proposed that the Baetasi might have lived near Geetbets, on the Brabant-Limburg border, but it seems more likely that they lived in an area closer to the Rhine in modern Germany. Two other pagi which appear in records for the first time under the empire, and which may have been in the civitas, are the pagus Vellaus, apparently corresponding to the forest of Veluwe in the Netherlands, and the pagus Catualinus, apparently in or near Heel on the Meuse, which corresponds with Catvalium in the Tabula Peutingeriana map. Franks In late Roman and early medieval times, the northern or \\"Kempen\\" part of Belgian Limburg once again became very distinct from the southern part. It became virtually empty because of Germanic plundering, and was then settled and ruled by Salian Franks coming over the Rhine and Maas from the north, apparently from the eastern Netherlands (which was itself under pressure from Saxons). These were amongst the first Germanic tribes to become strongly established within the Roman empire, and the ancestors of the Merovingians. They took up an older name of one of the districts of the civitas, \\"Toxandria\\", even though the original Toxandri may not have lived there any more. The southern or \\"Haspengouw\\" part of Belgian Limburg remained more heavily Romanised, but eventually also became a core land of the Franks. The two east-west Roman routes through Tongeren, mentioned above, became a front line of defense for a while, and are sometimes referred to as the Limes Belgicus. Gregory of Tours reports that it was from the area of Toxandria bordering Tongeren that Chlodio, in the 5th century, launched the Franks into military campaigns of conquest in northern Gaul, soon to become France or \\"Francia\\", the country of the Franks. In Merovingian times, Belgian Limburg was part of Austrasia, and in particular it appears that parts of the Haspengouw were under the control of the Pippinid family, and later their Carolingian descendants. This family were \\"mayors\\" of the Merovingian court until they eventually took over rule more openly. Pepin the short became the first Pippinid King of the Franks in 752. The founder of the Pippinids was Pepin of Landen, who was probably born in Landen in Belgian Limburg. Under the Franks, the region begins to be referred to with new placenames, which last into the Middle Ages and in some cases into modern times. A gouw or gau was a Frankish administrative region, translated into Latin as pagus, and roughly corresponding to English \\"county\\" or \\"shire\\". The ruler of a gouw, if it had one ruler, was typically a count or graaf, but some of the larger gouws came to be divided into smaller counties. Toxandria, in the Kempen, remained one such region. The eastern part of Belgian Limburg, bordering the river Maas or Meuse, was sometimes referred to as the \\"Maasgau\\" or Maasau. The southern part, received its modern name of Haspengouw, found in forms such as Haspinga, pagus Hasbaniensis or Hasbania, in old documents such as the Treaty of Meersen (870), but it was divided into four counties, which the treaty does not name. There were counts of Hesbaye in Carolingian times, but their exact territories are not known with certainty. By the 9th century, the Frankish Carolingian empire eventually included not only the region of Belgium and northern France, but also eventually much of Western Europe. After the death of Charlemagne, Limburg was part of the Lotharingian division of frankish Europe which lay between France and Germany and stretched to Italy. After the death of its first ruler, King Lothair I, it was only slowly integrated into Eastern Francia, which was to become the Holy Roman empire. In the period around 881 and 882 the areas along the Maas and in the Haspengouw were plundered by Norse Vikings, who established a base at Asselt on the Maas, today in Roermond in Dutch Limburg. The emperor Charles the Fat tried to negotiate with them. In 1891, the Vikings were back fought several times with forces of Arnulf of Carinthia, who had taken control of most of the eastern Frankish empire at that time. As a central part of Lotharingia, the area of modern Limburg was still deeply involved in Frankish politics at this time. Zwentibold, claimant to the kingdom of Lotharingia, died in Susteren in 900, and had his support in the Kempen area. He was opposed by the local House of Reginar, who had also changed sides during the Viking incursions. Despite their continuing conflicts with the emperors, it is from the house of Reginar that the medieval counts of Loon are thought to descend, although the exact genealogy of this house is highly uncertain. The area of Belgian Limburg underwent two periods of conversion to Christianity. The first period was that of St Servatius, before the domination of the Franks. This was only lasting in the romanised area to the southeast of Limburg, around Tongeren, and including nearby Maastricht and Li√®ge. A second period of missionary activity started around 700AD, after the coming of the pagan Franks, Lambert of Maastricht and Willibrord and others preached the gospel to the pagans who were still dominant to the north of this region. Out of these three romanised and early Christian cities, Li√®ge became the eventual seat of the bishop in the Middle Ages, taking over this position from Maastricht, which had taken it over from Tongeren. Another early saint in the south of Limburg was St Trudo. Middle Ages This map shows the medieval County of Loon in red, behind modern provincial borders. The light red zones were under Loon and another lord jointly. Belgian Limburg corresponds closely to the medieval territory of the County of Loon (French Looz), which originally centred on the fortified town of Borgloon, which had somehow become the centre of power in the Haspengouw during the early Middle Ages, taking over from earlier counties such as Hocht, near the Maas (Hocht itself is in Lanaken today), and Avernas, near St Truiden (Avernas itself being in Hannut today). It expanded from this territory into the Kempen to eventually encompass a similar territory to that of modern Belgian Limburg. The counts then moved their courts and residences from Borgloon, which was close to the border to Li√®ge, to more central positions in and around Hasselt, which has remained the capital of the region until today. As part of Loon, Belgian Limburg eventually became subject, not only spiritually but also politically, to the Prince Bishops of Li√®ge. Modern history A monument in Hasselt to the \\"boerenkrijgers\\", peasants who revolted against the absorption of Belgium into revolutionary France, and lost Loon, and the rest of the prince-bishopric of Li√®ge, were not joined politically with the rest of what would become Belgium until the French revolution. Nevertheless, in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries the population of Loon was constantly and badly affected by the wars involving neighbouring Brabant and Dutch Limburg, including the Eighty Years' War, the War of the Spanish Succession, the War of the Austrian Succession, the Seven Years' War, and even the Brabant Revolution against the unpopular reforms of the Emperor Joseph II. During this period the region's episcopal government was often unable to maintain law and order, and the economy of the area was often desperately bad, affected by plundering by soldiers and gangs of thieves such as the \\"Bokkenrijders\\". Nevertheless, the population contained strongly conservative catholic elements, and not only supported the Brabant revolution, but also rebelled unsuccessfully against the revolutionary French regime in the Peasants' War of 1798. Almost none of the modern Belgian or Dutch provinces of Limburg were ever part of the nearby Duchy of Limburg. Nevertheless, Limburg's modern name derives from this Duchy, which originally centred upon the fortified castle town known as Limbourg, situated on the river Vesdre in the Ardennes, now in the Wallonian province of Li√®ge. The modern Limburg region, containing the Belgian and Dutch provinces of that name, were first united within one province while under the power of revolutionary France, and later the Napoleonic empire, but then under the name of the French department of the Lower Meuse (Maas). Limbourg the town was not in this region, but was neighbouring it, and there had been a political association. Following the Napoleonic Era, the great powers (the United Kingdom, Prussia, the Austrian Empire, the Russian Empire and France) granted the region to the new United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815. A new province was formed and was to receive the name \\"Maastricht\\", after its capital. The first king, William I, who did not want the name Limbourg to be lost, given its high status of being an ancient Duchy, insisted that the name be changed to the \\"Province of Limburg\\". When both the Dutch- and the French- speaking Catholic regions in the south of the new kingdom split away from the mainly Calvinist, Dutch north in the Belgian Revolution of 1830, the province of Limburg was at first almost entirely under Belgian rule, and the status of both Limburg and Luxembourg became unclear. Leopold I took the oath as King of the Belgians on 21 July 1831. During the \\"Ten days campaign\\", 2‚Äì12 August 1831, Dutch armies entered Belgium and took control of several cities, including Antwerp, in order to negotiate from a stronger position. Several Belgian militias and armies were easily defeated including the Belgian Army of the Meuse near Hasselt, on 8 August. A French army entered Belgium on 9 August, and the British also began to intervene, while the Netherlands' Prussian and Russian allies could not send support, leading to a ceasefire. In 1831 the Treaty of the Eighty Articles in London established that both Limburg and Luxemburg would be split between the two states. In 1832 Antwerp was finally forced from Dutch hands. Finally, in 1839, under a new \\"Treaty of London\\" Limburg and Luxemburg were split, Limburg being split into so-called Dutch Limburg and Belgian Limburg. This shows the two modern provinces called Limburg, one in Belgium, and one in the Netherlands, next to the medieval Duchy they are both named after. The small overlap is Teuven and Remersdaal, in eastern Voeren, a detached part of modern Belgian Limburg since 1977. It is only in border areas near Maastricht that either of the two modern Limburgs have any strong historical connection to the old Duchy. For the most part this connection is only indirect, in the sense that a part of this area came to form a single detached territory under the Duchy of Brabant, thus ruled from its capital in Brussels, the so-called \\"States (Staten) of Limburg and Overmaas\\". However, one small part of Belgian Limburg was really in the Duchy of Limburg: in the extreme east of Voeren, the villages of Teuven and Remersdaal. Twentieth century Like other parts of eastern Belgium, Belgian Limburg came under German domination in the early phases of both the First World War and the Second World War. In the Second World War, Limburg and the rest of Belgium was joined together with some \\"Germanic\\" parts of Northern France under the military administration of \\"Belgium and Northern France\\". This was unlike the Netherlands and Norway, where non-military puppet governments were installed. The eventual Nazi plan was that Limburg would become part of the Greater Germanic Reich. Belgian Limburg became officially Flemish when all provinces in Belgium came under control of linguistically defined institutional regions in 1962. In the case of Voeren, surrounded by French speaking parts of Belgium, and having a significant population of French speakers, this was not without controversy. Only in 1967, the Catholic Church created a bishopric of Hasselt, separate form the bishopric of Li√®ge.

Television and DC Entertainment for NBC, based on the DC Comics character of the same name. David E. Kelley wrote the pilot, which was directed by Jeffrey Reiner. Adrianne Palicki starred as the main character. The Wonder Woman pilot was expected to debut in 2011, but NBC opted not to buy the series. Pedro Pascal, who played Ed Indelicato in the pilot, was later cast in another Wonder Woman related project, the 2020 movie Wonder Woman 1984. Plot In an inner city home a teenager tells his family that he has been accepted to college moments before he begins convulsing and bleeding from the eyes and ears. Meanwhile, Wonder Woman is in a foot chase with a super-strength criminal on Hollywood Blvd and, after knocking him out, takes a sample of his blood and leaves him to the police. Wonder Woman returns to the headquarters of Themyscira Industries, a large corporation which she runs as the CEO in her alter-ego of Diana Themyscira. Themyscira Industries owns and operates the concept of Wonder Woman as both a privately run crime fighting operation and for marketing the image of Wonder Woman as a role model to the outside world. Diana has trouble balancing her life as both the CEO of the corporation and as Wonder Woman. Diana's frustration with having to maintain a perfect image to the outside world in both these capacities leads her to create a third identity for herself, \\"Diana Prince,\\" so that she can have an element of normalcy in her life and sit at home with her cat watching romantic comedies and surfing the internet. At Themyscira Industries Diana grows suspicious of evil businesswoman Veronica Cale for distributing an illegal performance- enhancing drug that gives users super-human strength and endurance, but can cause death through repeated use. The blood sample she draws from the Hollywood Blvd fight and the story of the college-bound teen confirm Diana's suspicions. Without enough hard evidence to bring Cale to justice as Wonder Woman, Diana holds a press conference and airs her beliefs about Cale to the world. Cale in turn confronts Diana in person to intimidate her and threaten legal action. In a flashback, Diana ends up breaking it off with her boyfriend Steve Trevor because of her busy life. Back in present day, the college-bound teenager dies from his drug sickness and Diana is galvanized to confront Cale as Wonder Woman. She arrives at Cale's facilities, defeats all of her super- powered henchmen and confronts Cale face-to-face. Cale threatens legal action and to release security footage of Wonder Woman killing the henchmen, but Wonder Woman responds by pulling Cale down with her lasso and throwing her against the wall. Later Cale is put in jail and a Justice Department representative comes to meet Diana. This turns out to be Steve Trevor, who says that he will be working with Diana in her capacity as Wonder Woman but also reveals that he has married another woman.

Nancy Grace and Phil McGraw make cameo appearances as themselves. Design Adrianne Palicki as Wonder Woman In the pilot's first two acts, Wonder Woman wears a new version of her classic comic book uniform: the familiar red top with gold \\"W\\" insignia chestplate (formerly an eagle symbol chestplate) is still used, as are her golden belt and Lasso of Truth; but these are now worn with blue slacks that have gold stars running along the sides, rather than with shorts. Her boots are blue with gold trim (whereas the traditional boots were red and had white, vertical trim). Her bulletproof bracelets/gauntlets are more stylized, and her tiara is much thinner. During the final act of the pilot, when Wonder Woman flies to Cale's hidden laboratory for the final showdown with the villain, her clothing switches from the blue pants to the more recognizable shorts. Though Wonder Woman's Magic Golden Lasso is referred to as the \\"Lasso of Truth\\" by a reporter in the episode, she never uses it to magically compel anyone to tell the truth. For instance, in the first act, she uses the Lasso to end a pursuit of a man down city streets at night. In a later scene, she breaks the arm of one of Cale's henchmen to \\"make him talk,\\" instead of using the Lasso's magic. In this interpretation of Wonder Woman, the Lasso is only employed as an entangling weapon; Wonder Woman snaps it round a target (usually the neck) then jerks it roughly, throwing the target off-balance. Her bracelets can still stop bullets (as in the Lynda Carter-starring, 1975-1979 TV series). For example, she uses them to protect herself from a security guard's gunfire during the episode's climax (and retaliates by hurling a steel pipe at the hapless guard, impaling him through the neck and killing him instantly). One of this interpretation's greatest departures from Wonder Woman canon might be its version of her invisible plane/\\"the Invisible Jet.\\" Here, she gets around Los Angeles in a very small, one-seater aircraft that is reminiscent of a shuttlecraft in a sci-fi space TV show. While highly sophisticated, the plane is also highly visible (painted an opaque white). Production Reports surfaced in October 2010 that Warner Bros. Television was teaming with writer- producer David E. Kelley to pitch a new Wonder Woman television series to networks. The major networks all turned down the series, but NBC, the final network to initially pass on the project, announced that they had ordered a pilot on January 21, 2011. In February 2011, Jeffrey Reiner was hired to direct the pilot. A few days later, it was announced that Adrianne Palicki was selected to play the title role. Lynette Rice of Entertainment Weekly commented that compared to Lynda Carter's costume, Palicki's costume de- emphasized patriotism and played up the character's Greek mythological origin. Lynda Carter herself said Palicki looked gorgeous. Kyle Buchanan of New York stated the costume, \\"looked less like a superhero outfit and more like a Project Runway challenge gone awry, the kind of thing Nina Garcia would dismiss by sniffing, 'Shiny, cheap, and tacky'.\\" Borys Kit of The Hollywood Reporter pointed out that the costume was causing a divide, with many exclaiming it was \\"too trashy and too bad porn-y\\". After the first official images of Palicki in costume were revealed, Fox News republished a story criticizing the loss of Wonder Woman's American symbolism. Warner Bros. later changed the costume, replacing the blue boots and rubbery pants, due to fan criticism. But in the episode \\"Gorilla My Dreams\\" of Kelley's show Harry's Law, Erica Durance (best known as Lois Lane from the television series Smallville) as Annie Bilson, wears the original costume now with red boots. In March 2011, Elizabeth Hurley and Tracie Thoms were cast as villain Veronica Cale and Diana's personal assistant Etta Candy, respectively. Pedro Pascal was cast as Ed Indelicato, Wonder Woman's liaison to the police department and Cary Elwes as Henry Detmer, who runs the day-to-day operations of Diana's company. Actor Justin Bruening was cast to play Steve Trevor. A few weeks later, while the pilot was still in production, a photograph of Palicki as Wonder Woman was featured on the cover of the April 11‚Äì17, 2011, edition of TV Guide as part of its \\"Fall Sneak Peek\\" feature. The plot is described as \\"a reinvention of the iconic DC Comic in which Wonder Womanaka Diana Themyscirais a vigilante crime fighter in L.A., but also a successful corporate executive and a modern woman, trying to balance all of the elements of her extraordinary life.\\" No clear reference is made to Diana or her superhero persona of Wonder Woman being a true Amazon or coming from the legendary island of Themyscira, except one vague line of dialog during a board room scene. Within the pilot's own self-contained narrative, Wonder Woman's origins appear to be without any of the mystical elements from her comic book origins. On May 12, 2011, NBC announced that it would not be picking the project up for a series. Reception After watching the pilot, television critic Alan Sepinwall described it as \\"embarrassing ... [I]t was all I had feared, and more\\". See the comments for Sepinwall's description Writing about the show for Flickering Myth in 2017, Neil Calloway said \\"it has its moments ... but it was probably dated in 2011 ...

Palazzo Cocchi-Serristori is a Renaissance-style palace in Piazza Santa Croce, Florence, Italy. It presently houses offices of a regional council of Florence. History It is situated opposite to the church of Santa Croce, in the place where the city's 12th-century walls passed. Facing the church, on the right side of the piazza is the frescoed facade of the Palazzo dell'Antella. The Cocchi-Serristori palace is a reconstruction of a pre-existing medieval edifice (owned by the Peruzzi), attributed to Giuliano da Sangallo, Baccio d'Agnolo or Simone del Pollaiolo. It has a cubic shape, built with polished stone, with three arcades in the fa√ßade enclosed in the original 14th-century piers. At the two upper floors are pilasters with finely sculpted capitals. In the interior are a frescoed private chapel and, in the staircase, 18th-century frescoes attributed to Atanasio Bimbacci, Dionisio Predellini, and Giuseppe Collignon.

The organisation develops and improves health and education programs, aiming to help poor Hondurans achieve quality health care and sustained social development. To date, StoS has created and continued to provide some notable educational programs. Library Program Reading materials in Honduran schools are very limited and students are prohibited from even touching the few storybooks which must be kept in the possession of the teacher at all times. To address this situation, the StoS library program was started in 2007. With around 75 donated books housed in the Santa Lucia clinic, StoS sought to provide an avenue for children to engage in creative learning through books. Eventually, the library expanded to include an exercise class, English lessons, movie night, and a book club for young adults. A newer and bigger library was subsequently built in the same area in March 2009, which contains storage closets, bathrooms, a computer lab with online research capabilities, crafts, games, toys and books. A borrowing system was also established. Activities such as story hour, geography club and a life skills course for scholarship students are conducted weekly. Overall, the StoS library program has and will continue to benefit the cognitive learning abilities of the Honduran community. Girls‚Äô Leadership Project (Yo Puedo) The aim of this project was to help promote the role of females in Honduran society. StoS first trained a group of Honduran teachers, using Training of Trainers (TOT) sessions that emphasized enhancing the socio- economic capital of poor women in the surrounding poorest communities. The women are seldom educated beyond third grade and almost never beyond sixth grade. The teachers would impart their knowledge to, and guide, the selected Honduran girls, so that the girls could apply this knowledge to the initiation and undertaking of small-scale, home-based businesses that meet community needs. This helps to develop the girls‚Äô self-esteem and groom their potential as leaders. The results of Yo Puedo were very encouraging. In addition to the gains in specific skills from the different projects that girls undertook, they also became more outgoing and spontaneous. Expressing more interest and performing better in their academics, almost all showcased a desire to continue their education beyond sixth grade. Communication between the community and the school increased too, due to the enhanced social involvement of the female students. Most importantly, there was a change in gender perceptions by the males: boys, who were initially upset about the program, gradually supported and even volunteered for it. Sustained effort and interest in the project is achieved through ongoing one-on-one consultations between teachers and girls in various schools, as well as continuous participation from US volunteers. Girls are also re-investing their earnings to continue the program. Limitations of Projects StoS‚Äôs projects focus mainly on tackling the issue of quality and quantity of education in Honduras, but other major obstacles to obtaining education in the country still remain, namely family poverty, indigenous discrimination and gender inequality.

It is a pale yellow solid. It is one of three isomers of nitrotoluene. Synthesis and reactions Together with other isomers, 4-nitrotoluene is prepared by nitration of toluene. It undergoes the reactions, e.g. hydrogenation gives p-toluidine. Applications The principal application involves its sulfonation to give the 4-nitrotoluene-2-sulfonic acid (with the -SO3H group adjacent to methyl). This species can be oxidatively coupled to produce stilbene derivatives, which are used as dyes. Representative derivatives include the molecular and salt forms of 4,4'-dinitroso- and the 4,4'-dinitro-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acids, e.g. disodium 4,4'-dinitrostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate.

Elis Guri; July 6, 1983, Shkoder, Albania) - Bulgarian Greco-Roman style wrestler of Albanian descent, 2011 World Champion, two-time bronze medalist of European championships, participant in three summer Olympic Games. Biography Elis Guri began to participate in wrestling in early childhood under the guidance of his father, Eliyaz - a multiple time champion of Albania in Greco-Roman wrestling. Guri began performing at major international youth competitions since 2002. In 2003, Elis took part in the adult World Cup, unfortunately finished on 37th place. Guri also tried to qualify for the 2004 Summer Olympics, but lost in the qualifying tournament. For the first time, the Albanian managed to break into the top ten in 2007, when he became the 7th at the world championship in Baku. This result also brought Guri an Olympic license to participate in the Beijing Games. In April 2008, Elis won his first significant award, winning the bronze of the European Championship. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, Guri competed in the 96 kg category. In the first round, Guri sensationally defeated the current Olympic champion Egyptian Karam Gaber. In the quarter-finals Elis lost to the future finalist German Mirko Englich and went into the consolation round. In the semi-final of the bronze tournament, Guri lost to South Korean wrestler Han Tae Young and took the final 8th place. After the end of the Games, Guri decided to move to Bulgaria in order to have more opportunities to improve his skills there. Due to the change of citizenship, Elis could not participate in international competitions for two years [1]. Guri began officially participating under the flag of Bulgaria since 2011 and immediately achieved great success. In one year, Elis was able to become bronze medalist of the European Championship, and then won the World Championship, defeating Swede Jimmy Lidberg in the final. In 2012, Guri performed at his second summer Olympic Games. Like four years ago, Elis fought in the category up to 96 kg. Once again, Guri was able to get to the quarter finals, but there he lost to Timofey Dzeinichenko. Since Belarus lost already in the next match, Elis did not receive the right to participate in the tournament for a bronze medal. According to the results of the competition, the Bulgarian took a high 7th place. After completing the Games, Guri suspended his sports career. Guri returned to the wrestling carpet in 2015. In September of the same year, Elis took part in the World Championships in Las Vegas. Having demonstrated high skill during the championship, the Bulgarian wrestler was able to reach the semifinals, where he lost to the Olympic champion Iranian Gasim Rezai. In the duel for the bronze medal, Guri lost to the Russian Islam Magomedov and took 5th place. Having entered the 6th strongest at the end of the championship, Elis brought the Bulgarian team an Olympic qualification to participate in the 2016 Games.

In retirement Doyle became an energy consultant with the United States Department of Energy and also an author. He lived in Honolulu from 1980 up until his death. In 1960 he had been rescued from drowning off Waikiki Beach by a life guard, which inspired him to write to his book Rescue in Paradise (2001).Katherine Nichols, Beach heroes (book review) in Honolulu Advertiser dated 24 February 2001 He spoke five languages, and his fluency in French was an especially significant influence on his career. His book Inside Intelligence / True Men and Traitors argues the continuing need for the CIA in an uncertain world. It gives a firsthand account of his own active service, including his time as chief of station in the Congo when Patrice Lumumba was assassinated, revealing exactly what happened and who the killers were. The word 'traitors' in the book's title refers to a section on a number of those who betrayed the CIA, including Aldrich Ames.David W.

They were based on folk songs Vaughan Williams had collected in the English county of Norfolk, in particular the fishing port of King's Lynn in January 1905. Only the first rhapsody survives in its entirety, having been revised by the composer in 1914. The second exists in fragmentary form, and has been completed by other hands. The third is lost. The three rhapsodies together were originally intended to form a sort of folk- song symphony. The First Rhapsody corresponded to the first movement, the Second Rhapsody combines the second and third movements of the symphony, with the scherzo occurring as an inserted episode of the slow movement. The Third Rhapsody was the finale, using four tunes formed as a quick march and trio.Anon. \\"Cardiff Music Festival\\", The Musical Times 48, no. 777 (1 November 1907): 726‚Äì28, citation on 728.

Norfolk Rhapsody No. 1 in E minor The first rhapsody was written in 1906, and revised in 1914. It was premiered in London in August 1906 conducted by Henry Wood, and was later substantially revised for a performance in Bournemouth in May 1914. It begins with an introduction based on two songs, \\"The Captain's Apprentice\\" and \\"The Bold Young Sailor\\", followed by the main allegro movement, employing three songs; \\"A Basket of Eggs\\", \\"On Board a Ninety-eight\\" and \\"Ward, the Pirate\\". Vaughan Williams had collected several of these songs in the North End of King's Lynn which was home to the majority of the port's fishing community.Chris Bishop, \\"King‚Äôs Lynn pub where fishermen sang to Ralph Vaughan Williams could be turned into a shop\\", Eastern Daily Press January 11, 2014 Norfolk Rhapsody No. 2 in D minor This rhapsody employs \\"Young Henry the Poacher\\", \\"Spurn Point\\" and \\"Ward, the Pirate\\", already presented in the First Rhapsody. Its final pages are lost, but have been reconstructed by Stephen Hogger.Michael Kennedy, Notes to Pastoral Symphony, Chandos Records 2002, 5-6 (archive from 10 October 2015, accesse 25 October 2016). The second and third rhapsodies were first performed together under the composer's baton at the Cardiff Festival in September 1907 and later in London in April 1912 but were then withdrawn. Vaughan Williams did not publish the Second Rhapsody, and appears to have withdrawn it at the time of the extensive revision of the First Rhapsody in 1914, reusing some of its material for the Six Studies in English Folk Song (1926). Nevertheless, the manuscript score survived except for the last two pages. The missing ending was reconstructed in 2002 by Stephen Hogger for a CD recording by the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Richard Hickox. Although this recording was apparently permitted by the RVW Society on the understanding that it would be a \\"one-off exhumation\\", the same orchestra and conductor gave the restored score a public performance at a Musicians' Benevolent Fund Royal Concert at the Barbican Centre in 2004.Mark Doran, \\"London, Barbican: Vaughan Williams Rarities\\", Tempo 58, no. 228 (April 2004): 70‚Äì73, citation on 72‚Äì73.

Norfolk March was premiered at the English Music Festival in 2016.Norfolk March programme note, Faber & Faber 2016 The March has since been recorded by Dutton Epoch CDLX7351, performed by the Royal Scottish Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Martin Yates.

Both his friends and parents understand and support Cameron while he decides to take a music course at Hollyoaks Community College. At college, he falls for new tenant Bella Manning (Kim Bourelle); the pair get along, but nothing becomes of it, as she had left HCC.

Records indicate that Episcopal services were conducted as early as 1815 by itinerant clergymen, but there was not a building so services were conducted in the county court. In 1843, the Rt. Rev. Wm. Meade, Bishop of Virginia, sent the Rev. Tho. Smith to be the vicar of a small congregation. The church property was given by John Snodgrass, a member of congress from this district. The first church's building began in 1846, and Rev. Smith died at age 48, before its completion. He was buried, by his request, under the front steps. He felt he was \\"a poor sinner and wanted to be trampled under the feet of all who entered.\\" The first church was completed in 1850, with the rectory built in 1863, and occupied until 1919, when it was turned into office buildings and Sunday school rooms. The old church was torn down in 1878, and the present building completed and consecrated in 1879. The church's foundation stones come from Quincy Hill quarry. In 1913, the church was flooded and pews were taken up and stored higher, but the organ, furnaces and floor was destroyed. Another flood occurred in 1937, however, this one was not as severe, yet the pews were replaced. Trinity Hall was built in 1881, financed by children via plays and bake sales, with the cost totaling $750. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Trinity Episcopal Church is locally renowned for the annual used book sale held each fall by its ECW (Episcopal Church Women). They are also well known for their Monday feeding ministry where they feed between 120 and 170 meals each Monday between 11:00 AM and noon.

He was a Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, from 1367 Duke in the Principality of G√∂ttingen.  Life  His father was Ernest I (1305‚Äì1367), who assumed power in the Principality of G√∂ttingen in 1345. After several years of co-regency in 1367, Otto took up government in this small and economically weak principality. Otto initially resided in the city of G√∂ttingen, where he also held several large jousting tournaments. Over time, however, he had a number of disputes with the citizens of the city. Otto's contemporaries called him , which is Low German for \\"the evil\\". He received this nickname due to the almost unbroken series of feuds he was involved in. Otto has been described as a prominent representative of the former knighthood. He often allied himself with noble Knights to fight against other princes or against the cities, whose burgeoning power was anathema to him. During these clashes, Otto often changed sides. Sometimes, he fought several feuds simultaneously. From 1367 onwards, he pursued hereditary claims to the Landgraviate of Hesse. He tried to enforce his claims in a military alliance with the knights in the Star League. At the same time, he fought in the L√ºneburg War of Succession. At first, he fought on the side of Magnus II against the House of Ascania. He was able to secure the reign of Brunswick from 1374 to 1381. Ultimately, he failed in both Hesse and Brunswick and had to withdraw in exchange for financial compensation. In 1387, he tried to impose his influence on the city of G√∂ttingen, but had little success. In April, the citizens of G√∂ttingen stormed the ducal castle inside the city walls. In return, Otto devastated villages and farmsteads in the area. In July, the citizens under captain Moritz von Uslar defeated him in a pitched battle between Rosdorf and Grone. In August, Otto was forced to recognize the freedom of G√∂ttingen's possessions in the area. In the final years of life, Otto resided mostly at Hardeg Castle After he was expelled from G√∂ttingen, Otto had to reside in Hardegsen, where he had acquired Hardeg Castle in 1379 from the Lords of Rosdorf. By this time, he had been excommunicated, which is why he was buried in unhallowed ground north of the church of Wiebrechtshausen monastery at Northeim. He was later posthumously released from the excommunication. After that, a tomb was erected over his burial place and a chapel was built around it. The chapel was later connected to the church. The final verdict on Otto I is negative, because he overestimated his powers and left himself weakened when he fought too many fights at once. He left a heavily indebted and politically disorganized country to his only son, Otto II.  Marriage and issue  In 1379, he married Margarete (c.1364 - 18 July 1442), a daughter of Duke William VII of J√ºlich- Berg. They had one son: Otto II, who succeeded him.

Career Asmara was born in Jakarta to a diplomat and his wife. She accompanied her father to foreign countries when he received an assignment. While overseas with her family, she attended several colleges. She first worked in advertising, but in the 1980s Asmara began writing songs, with her first released song being \\"Susie Bhelel\\", sung by Fariz RM for his 1989 album Fashionova. She entered filmmaking by producing commercials and the music video for KLa Project's \\"Tak Bisa Ke Lain Hati\\". Although she wanted to make a featured length film, she feared that the Suharto-era government would censor any film she made. As such, her initial scripts went unfilmed. She rose to prominence with the release of her directorial debut, Biola Tak Berdawai (The Stringless Violin), in 2003. She also wrote the script and assisted in the production of the film. Style In contrast to the increasingly frank depiction of sexuality by female writers such as Ayu Utami after the fall of the New Order, Asmara's works take a more conservative view. Tineke Hellwig of the University of British Columbia, Biola Tak Berdawai is anti-feminist to the point of being misogynistic. Her female characters are often pregnant or have undergone an abortion; several also have cancer of the reproductive organs. According to Hellwig, the traditional view of women being loving mothers is idealized in Asmara's works, but rarely shown. Personal life Asmara is a fan of musicals, and has noted that she has already written one that she hopes to make if there is enough money; she has already written the songs for it. She also likes the Hindu epic Mahabharata. She has stated that she writes about things that \\"other people are not producing\\".

History The Carrum Carrum Swamp was drained in 1879 when the Patterson Cut (formed in 1876), and other drainage measures were undertaken to prevent flooding of the Eumemmering Creek, which overflowed into the swamp. When the Patterson Cut was dug, the area that is now occupied by Patterson Lakes was turned to farmland with mainly dairy cattle. By the late 1960s farming activities had just about ceased, and the area became popular with fox and rabbit shooters.

My assessment was that the Ecoplan report provides no causal or supportive evidence to justify the significant conclusion it makes about the lives of kangaroos at Northern Lodge. It makes recommendations that are at variance with its own observations and remarks, is inconsistent with the learning values being advocated by the NMIT, and undertakes no benefit-cost assessment of other options.

By 1913 it had four factories in the London area including a facility in Barking and in 1939 it opened a manufacturing facility at Acre Mill near Hebden Bridge to meet the demand for gas mask filters made from blue asbestos during the Second World War. In 1976 it established a scaffolding division and in the late 1970s it developed asbestos-free products such that by 1980 it had become the world's foremost supplier of asbestos-free protection and insulation board. Although it had a full listing during the 1980s it was at that time 67.3% owned by Charter Consolidated plc. It transferred from a full listing to the Alternative Investment Market in 2002 in a bid to cut costs and it reached a settlement in 2003 to pay ¬£7.5 million to 7,500 claimants from South Africa who had been seeking compensation over many years for asbestos-related health problems. In 2006 it established a ¬£40 million fund for claimants based in the UK. In 2006 it bought DBI, an industrial cleaning specialist based in the UK, and in 2007 it acquired PCH, a scaffolding and hoist company based in Australia. In June 2011 it was transferred back to a full listing from the Alternative Investment Market and was restructured in such a way that it was ultimately Jersey-registered. The company was acquired by Altrad for ¬£332 million in September 2017. Operations Cape provides \\"non-mechanical\\" multi-disciplined integrated support services covering such disciplines as access, scaffolding, insulation, coatings, passive fire protection, refractory linings, environmental services, oil and gas storage tanks and heat exchanger replacement and refurbishment, project management and other essential services to major industrial clients in the energy sector.

History  = Construction = The proposed line received Royal Assent on 1 August 1861, authorising a single track railway line from a point near Bransford Road on the West Midland Railway, through to the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway at . Authority was also given for ¬£200,000 capital to be raised by the selling of ¬£10 shares, with a quarter to be purchased by the West Midland Railway, plus an additional ¬£65,000 in loans if necessary. The limited company was formed under the chairmanship of Sir Charles Hastings, founder of the British Medical Association. Originally authorised to be constructed in five years, it eventually took 36 years to construct the complete line, opened in four sections, finishing in 1897. In a special General meeting in March 1864, it was revealed that the company had already spent ¬£20,000, yet neither had all the land been purchased nor had the construction contract been signed. The shareholders voted for the board to apply for an extension, which was agreed until 1869. Construction work on the line ceased in December 1866 when the contractor was declared bankrupt, with the contract re-let to a Mr. Jackson for completion by January 1867. In June 1867, with only ¬£67 cash left in the company's accounts, a plea was made by the company to local farmers, tenants and landowners. By 1869, the company had made a successful application to the Board of Trade for a certificate allowing them to abandon the plans for the Bromyard to Leominster section, and a further extension to 28 June 1871. = Leominster and Bromyard Railway = In 1874, a new company was formed, the Leominster and Bromyard Railway Company, authorised to construct from to . It had to raise ¬£210,000, with authorisation for an additional ¬£70,000 via a mortgage if needed. Built by new contractor Mr Riddy, the first section ran from Bromyard Junction ( west of Bromyard), to Yearsett was opened in May 1874. The last to Bromyard were completed in 1877. Opened on Monday 22 October 1877, it had cost ¬£17,000/mile to build. With workings sub-contracted to the Great Western Railway, a special 14 carriage train left at noon, arriving in Bromyard at 1pm. At the other end of the line, a section from to was completed in 1884. = Operation = Although locally popular, the line rarely made a profit, and the operating company went into liquidation. Acquired from the liquidator in 1888 by the Great Western Railway for ¬£20,000, it completed the line and opened the remaining stations in 1897. Traffic was light, although by 1932 three trains ran the line on a Sunday, and certain events drove the traffic greatly higher. The Bromyard Races were a popular event, and in 1884 almost 7,000 people turned out to see them, most via train. The line was also used by seasonal hop-pickers in September, seeking temporary work. In 1929 was opened between Leominster and Steens Bridge. Passenger service was worked by a GWR Autocoach powered by GWR Class 517 0-4-2T locomotive, with GWR Pannier 0-6-0PT's used for freight. In later years more modern locomotives were introduced, and on occasions a GWR diesel railcar. In the late 1940s, a coal wagon was being shunted in 's yard to the down platform, the highest station on the line at above sea level. The wagon's hand brake failed, and it started to accelerate towards Leominster. Passing later through at a speed in excess of , the decision was made by the signal men to set the tracks to allow let the wagon continue to Leominster engine shed siding. When the wagon arrived, it smashed the Buffer stop, breaking the wagon itself into pieces and spilling coal down the river bank. A view of southeast towards Worcester on 13 August 1963, showing the storage of disused and soon to be scrapped vans and wagons = Closure = Post World War II, and with the greater use of the motorbus and private cars, traffic on the line fell considerably. The stations all became unstaffed as a station from September 1949, and the line between Bromyard and Leominster closed to regular passenger services on 15 September 1952 but remained open from Bromyard to Worcester. On 26 April 1958 a special train organised by the Stephenson Locomotive Society ran from Worcester via Bromyard to Leominster, calling at Rowden Mill, Fencote and Steens Bridge. Headed by ex-GWR 4500 Class 2-6-2T No.4571, the 50 society members/passengers rode on the last train that would run on the complete track before it was removed. The Worcester to Bromyard section, initially kept open for the storage of 600+ disused and soon to be scrapped railway vans and wagons, was closed under the Beeching Axe in 1964. The line was removed in 1965, with the track bed being offered for sale for ¬£54,000 but there were no takers.Smith p.155  Present  The former site of Bromyard railway station, now redeveloped as a light industrial estate After being closed, most of the line was sold off to the original private land owners. North beyond Stoke Prior Halt, the track ran parallel for over a mile to the Shrewsbury and Hereford line, which was redeveloped as part of the Leominster bypass.

It stands on a granite pedestal in Old Palace Yard outside the Palace of Westminster in London, facing south towards the entrance to the House of Lords. It was created by Baron Carlo Marochetti, an Italian sculptor whose works were popular with European royalty and the nobility, though often less well regarded by critics and the artistic establishment. The statue was first produced in clay and displayed at The Great Exhibition in 1851, where it was located outside the west entrance to the Crystal Palace. It was well received at the time and two years later Queen Victoria and Prince Albert headed a list of illustrious subscribers to a fund that aimed to raise money for the casting of the statue in bronze. Although the money was duly raised and the bronze cast of the statue was finally completed in 1856, a lengthy dispute delayed its installation for several years. The original idea had been to erect the statue as a memorial to the Great Exhibition. This prompted opposition, as did proposals to place it outside Charles Barry's newly completed Palace of Westminster. Various other locations to display the statue were initially considered before agreement was reached that it would be placed in Old Palace Yard, Marochetti's preferred location. It was installed in October 1860, though it was not until March 1867 that it was finally completed with the addition of bronze bas-reliefs on either side of the pedestal. The quality of the statue's workmanship caused problems during its first half-century; the horse's tail fell off the day after it was installed at the Great Exhibition, and forty years after its installation it was discovered to be riddled with holes and to have never been properly attached to its pedestal. It narrowly escaped destruction during the Second World War when a German bomb dropped during the Blitz landed a few metres away and peppered it with shrapnel. The pedestal and the horse's tail were damaged and Richard's sword was bent by the blast. In 2009, the Parliamentary authorities undertook a project to conserve and restore the statue. Description The statue was created by Baron Carlo Marochetti and is located in Old Palace Yard outside the Palace of Westminster, opposite Westminster Abbey in London. With its pedestal, it stands high, showing King Richard I on horseback. The king is depicted wearing a crowned helmet and a chainmail shirt with a surcoat, and lifting a sword into the air. The horse paws the ground, as if preparing for a charge into battle. Marochetti described his work as being inspired by Richard I rather than accurately depicting a 12th-century knight. It stands on a granite pedestal also designed by Marochetti and made by Freeman & Co. of Penryn, Cornwall. Bas-relief panels showing Crusaders fighting the Saracens at the Battle of Ascalon and Richard on his deathbed pardoning Bertran de Born, the archer who fatally shot him in 1199, were added to the east and west sides of the pedestal in 1866‚Äì67. As the statue cannot be accessed by the general public ‚Äì the area around it is used as the House of Lords car park ‚Äì the west- side scene showing Richard and Bertran is the only one visible from the street. According to Marochetti, the two bas-reliefs were designed in the style of Lorenzo Ghiberti's doors at the Florence Baptistry. Bronze letters on the front of the pedestal bear the inscription RICHARD I C≈íUR DE LION / 1189‚Äì1199. The great majority of the art in and around the Houses of Parliament is of British origin, due to a policy of acquiring British art for the building. Marochetti's statue thus represents one of the few examples of a non-British artist's work being selected for the Parliamentary estate. History =Creation and display at the Great Exhibition= The original clay statue on display in Hyde Park during The Great Exhibition (1851) Marochetti was born in Italy and was ennobled by the Kingdom of Sardinia but lived and worked in France, creating a number of prestigious works for the royalist French government in the 1830s. He made his name by creating equestrian statues; one, of the Duke of Wellington, was erected in Glasgow in 1840. By the 1840s, however, his popularity in continental Europe was in decline. The French Revolution of 1848, which saw the final overthrow of the French monarchy, prompted him to resettle in London and seek new patrons among the British elite. Marochetti was not popular with the Victorian artistic establishment; Punch referred to him derisively as \\"Count Marrowfatty\\", while John Timbs wrote that he \\"owed more of his success in life to royal and noble patrons than artistic merit.\\" It was certainly true that he benefited from the patronage of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. His courtly manners impressed Victoria on their first meeting in 1849, and soon afterwards he became involved with the Prince Consort's plans for what became The Great Exhibition of 1851. Several countries planned to display sculptures of romantic historical figures in their contributions to the exhibition. The genre was common in mainland Europe but relatively rare in England at the time. Marochetti was probably aware that the Belgian sculptor Eugene Simonis intended to show his statue of Godfrey de Bouillon, the leader of the First Crusade, which King Leopold I of Belgium had commissioned. The two men had a number of connections; they shared the same bronze founder, Soyer of Paris, and Simonis was influenced by Marochetti's earlier acclaimed statue of the Duke of Savoy, Emanuele Filiberto. The Italian sculptor was probably motivated by a sense of competition with the Belgian in designing his Richard I. Marochetti's creation of the clay model of the statue involved not only the sculptor himself but also the painter Victor Mottez, King Louis Philippe's personal physician Henri Gueneau de Mussy and the singers Mario and Garcia, all of whom contributed manual input. A clay model of the statue was displayed as one of two statues positioned outside the western entrance of the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park. Unfortunately it was so poorly assembled that shortly after the opening of the exhibition on 1 May 1851, the horse's tail fell off. It was repaired and the statue eventually attracted critical acclaim. The art critic John Ruskin said of the model, \\"it will tend more to educate the public with respect to art than anything we have done for centuries\\". It came to be regarded as one of the more popular items in the exhibition and Prince Albert personally took King Leopold to see it and the statue by Simonis, which now stands in the Grand Place of Brussels. The Art Journal was later to describe it as \\"unquestionably a vigorous and spirited example of the bravura class of sculpture.\\" =Casting and dispute over location= Close-up view of the statue's upper body; the close fitting of Richard's chainmail shirt was criticised as being unrealistic Major General Charles Richard Fox proposed during the exhibition that a bronze cast should be made of the statue to serve as a memorial to the exhibition, marking one end of the site of the Crystal Palace with a statue of Prince Albert at the other end. A campaign got underway two years later, in May 1853, with a variety of the great and the good signing a brochure promoting a scheme to erect the statue somewhere in London. Its supporters included the Duke of Sutherland, Lord Lansdowne, the Earl of Shaftesbury, the sculptor John Henry Foley, the novelist William Makepeace Thackeray, the ceramic manufacturer William Taylor Copeland and the Conservative MP (and future Prime Minister) Benjamin Disraeli. The Times was strongly in favour of the project due to the influence of its foreign affairs reporter Henry Reeve, who had known Marochetti since as early as 1839. The Royal Family also let it be known that they were supporters, with Queen Victoria donating ¬£200 and Prince Albert ¬£100. The future location of the statue was a contentious issue from the outset, with Fox's proposal of a site in Hyde Park being sidelined in favour of leaving the site open for future consideration. The appropriateness of its theme in relation to the Great Exhibition was also questioned. The Art Journal pointed out the contradiction between \\"the effigy of a valiant crusader\\" and \\"the great Peace congress of 1851\\" and asked why \\"a foreign sculptor alone\\" was being selected to commemorate a British exhibition. The Lord Mayor of London, Thomas Challis, was similarly critical, declaring that the statue depicted \\"muscular power and the almost savage ferocity of war ..., while ... the Great Exhibition afforded an example of the cordial amity of nations.\\" His criticism was perhaps not unrelated to the fact that he was promoting a rival scheme to commemorate the Exhibition. Others criticised the statue's lack of realism. As The Times observed after the statue's installation, the sculptor \\"sacrificed probabilities in the close fit he has given to Richard's mail shirt, which is made to display the swelling biceps and folded mass of pectoral muscle as accurately as a knitted woollen jersey.\\" Despite the criticism, ¬£5,000 (equivalent to ¬£ today) was raised by private donations for a bronze version to be created. Parliament subsequently agreed to contribute ¬£1,650 for the pedestal and a further ¬£1,500 for two bas-reliefs to be installed on its sides. In 1854 a plaster version was placed in New Palace Yard facing west outside Westminster Hall, but Charles Barry, the architect of the palace, was opposed to its placement there. The Art Journal criticised the New Palace Yard location on the grounds that the statue was merely a novelty and, worse, depicted an unworthy subject ‚Äì \\"a disobedient son and a bad governor\\". It also suffered from being lost against the architectural details of the Palace of Westminster. By early May 1854, the plaster statue had been removed. The sculpture in Old Palace Yard In 1856, Marochetti had the statue cast in bronze at the workshop that he had established in the early 1850s in Sydney Mews, off Fulham Road. The casting and the statue's gifting to the nation in the summer of 1856 made the question of its location all the more essential to resolve. Other sites were considered, including outside Buckingham Palace, Carlton Gardens near the Horse Guards and even on top of Marble Arch. Prince Albert himself suggested locating it outside the west entrance of Westminster Abbey, looking down the newly created Victoria Street. Punch mocked the ongoing search for a location in an August 1857 issue, calling Richard I \\"the Wandering Statue of London\\". The anonymous writer asked whether \\"no-one [will] find standing-room for this fugitive king? Is there no spot, no royal mews, no academic stable where his over-driven steed can be taken in to bait?\\" Marochetti proposed to install it in Old Palace Yard outside the south window of Westminster Hall. His idea was considered by the Fine Arts Commission for the Palace of Westminster and was deemed acceptable, although Sir Charles Barry again opposed it. His reasoning was that Old Palace Yard was \\"too limited in area, and too irregular and unsymmetrical in its form and approaches, to give due effect to it, as a work of art ...\\" For his part, Marochetti positively preferred the location's irregularity to the symmetry of a formally laid-out square. The dispute continued until 1859 when the Commissioner of Works, Lord John Manners, finally agreed to install the statue in Marochetti's favoured location. By this time Sir Charles Barry was seriously ill (and died on 12 May 1860) so was no longer in a position to offer opposition. =Installation and subsequent history= Side view of the statue in 2014 showing the bas-relief on the west side of the pedestal Parliament voted to fund a pedestal for the statue, carved from Cornish granite, but transportation delays meant that it was not until 26 October 1860 that the statue was placed on its pedestal and unveiled to the public. It was completely undecorated at first but a bronze shield was placed on the front end of the pedestal shortly after the installation. The Times (probably its pro-Marochetti reporter Henry Reeve) declared that with the installation of the statue \\"a great reproach had been removed from London\\", which now finally had a great equestrian monument which displayed a \\"combination of life and picturesqueness\\". It claimed that Marochetti's Richard I ranked \\"with the few great statues of that class in Europe\\". Not all critics were as fulsome; the British critic and poet Francis Turner Palgrave castigated it as \\"an essentially vulgar and low-class work precisely on the grounds that call forth the wonder of uncultivated spectators.\\" It was said to have been particularly appreciated by London's cabbies, who tethered their horses nearby. Marochetti also intended to add bas-reliefs to either side of the pedestal and had provisioned it with \\"sunk panels\\" ready for the reliefs to be installed. He proposed to create four \\"alto relievos in the style of the Ghiberti doors on the Battisterio at Florence\\", depicting the coronation of Richard in Westminster Abbey, the taking of Ascalon, Richard as a prisoner of the Saracens and Richard on his deathbed. He quoted ¬£2,500 for all four, but Parliament voted instead to grant him ¬£1,500 for two scenes ‚Äì Ascalon and the death of Richard. Detail of the bas-relief panel on the west side of the pedestal, depicting Richard on his deathbed pardoning the archer Bertrand de Gourdon Marochetti accepted the commission and created plaster models of the reliefs. He installed one of the models in his ch√¢teau in France, where it remains today, while the other was set into the wall of a gardener's cottage adjoining his French estate. The bronze relief of the deathbed scene was added to the pedestal in August 1866, while the Taking of Ascalon was installed in March 1867. The Art Journal criticised the deathbed scene as being excessively stretched lengthways and noted similarities with a painting displayed in the Houses of Parliament, created by John Cross, that depicted the same subject. Marochetti also pursued an abortive project to install a second giant equestrian statue in Old Palace Yard, this time portraying Edward, the Black Prince. He envisaged the two statues facing each other on either side of the entrance to the House of Lords. Although the scheme was reported in several journals, including the Illustrated London News, the Art Journal and the Athenaeum, and was strongly criticised for its perceived thematic inappropriateness, nothing came of it. Three different versions of the model for Marochetti's Black Prince came to light at the turn of the 21st century. They appear to have been designed at the same time as his Richard I, demonstrating their common origins; models of the two statues almost certainly would have co-existed in his workshop and Marochetti probably intended to seek a commission from Prince Albert. However, the death of the Prince Consort in 1861 deprived him of his most influential patron, and Marochetti's own death was to follow in 1867. Queen Victoria purchased one of Marochetti's statuette versions of the Black Prince following the sculptor's death and gave it to her son Edward, Prince of Wales. It is still part of the Royal Collection. The statue has required repair work on several occasions to fix damage and defects. Only a few months after it was installed, it was reported to be oscillating in strong gusts of wind. Marochetti pronounced it sound but promised to strengthen the legs if necessary. During the winter of 1908‚Äì09, frost damaged one of the forelegs of the horse part of the statue. It was found that between 60‚Äì80 leaks were letting water into the interior of the statue and causing further damage when it froze. It was also discovered that the statue had never been properly attached to the pedestal but was merely resting under its own weight on the two ends of its base. Repair work took place to remedy these problems. The statue was damaged during the Second World War when a large German bomb hit Old Palace Yard on 26 September 1940, during the Blitz. The bomb exploded only a few metres away from the statue and reportedly lifted it bodily off the ground. The upper part of the sword was bent and the tail of the horse suffered several holes from pieces of shrapnel. Vincent Massey, the High Commissioner for Canada, argued that the sword should be left unrepaired, as it symbolised \\"the strength of democracy which will bend but not break under attack.\\" The sword was replaced in 1947, and other repair work was also done. However, damage to the pedestal can still be seen. The statue received Grade II listed status in February 1970. In the summer of 2009, the Parliamentary authorities undertook a three-week conservation project to repair and restore the statue. It consisted of removing accumulated dirt and an old coating of black wax, repatinating the bronze surface to return it to its original colour and treating it with a clear wax as protection from pollution and the elements. The bas reliefs on the pedestal were also cleaned and treated, as was the pedestal itself.

Conversely, the Bootle Times reported that the group were \\"sensational\\". After the performances, a fight broke out backstage after bassist Stuart Sutcliffe was told to \\"cut [his] hair\\" as he looked like a girl. Despite this and their group's performance, Kelly booked the group for the following weekend's dance, promoting them as \\"Silver Beetles\\" in the headline slot. The group later failed to notify Kelly that they could not play at the performance, having received an offer to tour Scotland with Johnny Gentle, leaving him to explain to the audience why the advertised act would not appear. Nevertheless, the group were booked for a number of subsequent concerts in early 1961, by which time they had changed their name to The Beatles. Kelly paid the group an average of ¬£8 0s 10d per concert, equivalent to approximately ¬£120 in 2005.Calculated using The National Archives' Currency Converter The group's final appearance at the hall was on 25 February, George Harrison's 18th birthday. Stuart Sutcliffe, who was the band's bassist at this time, would go on to die of a brain aneurysm 16 months later in Hamburg. A definitive cause is unknown, but it has been linked to the traumatic head injury he received during a fight outside Lathom Hall following one of the Beatles' performances in January 1961. According to former manager Allan Williams, Sutcliffe was either kicked in the head or thrown head first against a brick wall. Lennon and Best went to his aid fighting off his attackers before dragging him to safety. Sutcliffe had a fractured skull, and Lennon broke his little finger. Sutcliffe refused medical attention at the time and failed to keep an X-ray appointment at Sefton General Hospital.  Legacy  After the popularity of Merseybeat subsided, the hall became used as a Royal Navy club before lying derelict for a number of years. In 1989, it was purchased by Brian Corrigan, who renovated the hall and reopened it as a bar and function venue decorated with Merseybeat memorabilia.

Having played in Bhutan for a number of years, he became the first Bhutanese player to become a full-time player when he moved to Royal Wahingdoh in 2010. He made his first appearance for the Bhutan national football team in 2009. Playing career =Club= Chencho began his playing career at the age of seventeen for Druk Star in the Bhutan A-Division in 2002. Druk Star had two mediocre seasons while Chencho was playing for them finishing fifth in 2003 following an unknown placing the previous season. He moved to Yeedzin in 2004. In his first four seasons with Yeedzin, the club was very much a mid table team during a period in which Transport United dominated domestic football in Bhutan. in 2008 Yeedzin produced their best performance to that point and Chencho was part of the team that won both the league and cup. They finished the league season unbeaten, four points ahead of runners-up Transport United, dropping points in only two games, including a 1‚Äì1 draw with Choden FC, the Bhutan U-19 team whilst also beating Rigzung 20‚Äì0 in the second half of the season. They won the 2008 A-Division Knock-Out Tournament, beating Royal Bhutan Army 4‚Äì3 in the final. The following season, despite scoring more goals than any other team and more than the bottom half of the table managed combined and with scorelines of 10‚Äì2, 20‚Äì0 and 16‚Äì1 against Rigzung and Druk Athletic twice respectively, they were unable to retain their league title in the 2009 season, losing three games throughout the course of the season and finishing five points behind Druk Star, who ended the season unbeaten. They were equally unfortunate in the Club Cup Championship. Despite beating Nangpa 12‚Äì0 in the quarter finals and Choden 4‚Äì1 in the semi-finals, they lost 0‚Äì1 to Druk Star in the final as the mirrored what Yeedzin had achieved the previous season. 2009 was also the first season that Yeedzin represented Bhutan in continental competition, their victory in the previous season's league competition meaning that they were awarded Bhutan's berth in the 2009 AFC President's Cup. They were drawn in Group C for the Group Stage, along with Dordoi-Dynamo Naryn of Kyrgyzstan, Kanbawza of Burma and Phnom Penh Crown of Cambodia. They travelled to Bishkek, where all the group games were played, but were beaten in all three games, conceding fourteen goals and scoring only three and did not progress. Yeedzin bounced straight back the following season with another unbeaten season, finishing nine points clear of Druk Pol to give Chencho his second championship, dropping points only once; in a 0‚Äì0 draw against Druk Pol. Following his performances both domestically and in continental football, Chencho earned himself a move to Royal Wahingdoh in the Indian I-League 2nd Division. In doing so, he became the first Bhutanese player to be able to call himself a full-time professional player, signing a contract worth Nu 1,000,000 per season. In his first season, his new club finished unbeaten in their group, but were unable to finish in the top two in the final stage and so remained in the second division. The following season, Chencho moved to Luangmual, also in the I-League Second Division. =International= Chencho has been capped ten times for the Bhutan national football team, most recently he took part in the 2013 SAFF Championship, playing in two of Bhutan's three group games; the 2‚Äì8 loss to the Maldives and the 0‚Äì3 loss to Afghanistan. Personal life Prior to his move to Royal Wahingdoh, Chencho juggled football with his job at a private company in Bhutan. While playing for Royal Wahingdoh, he studied for an MBA.
