Shaw and Katherine Roche, was born February 1, 1877, in or near Warwick, Ontario. He had a brother, Joseph. The family moved to Detroit, Michigan, then Colorado in the late 1880s and Kansas, before settling in Missouri. He went to public schools in Denver and in Joplin, Missouri. He studied business and then began clerking in a country store in Joplin and soon became a salesman with the Campbell-Redell Wholesale Grocery Company. He remained in the grocery business for thirty years, except when he was briefly with the Ozark Coal and Railroad Company at Fort Smith, Arkansas. As a representative of the Cudahy Packing Company, Shaw moved to Los Angeles in 1909. In 1919 he joined the Haas-Baruch Company in Los Angeles and left it when he was elected to the city council.Biographical Dictionary of American Mayors, 1820‚Äì1980 and Los Angeles County records, cited at the county website Los Angeles Public library biography file Original sources are given in that file.Frank L.

Shires on February 5, 1905, in Fort Smith, Arkansas, and in 1909 the couple moved to Los Angeles. They had no children. She died in 1951 at the age of 68. At age 76, Frank Shaw was secretly married in Tijuana, Mexico to Dortha Sheehan, age 22, and revealed the fact three years later, in January 1956.\\"Ex-Mayor Frank L.

Lawsuits Citizenship A major controversy erupted after Shaw's election as mayor when Charles A. Butler, former secretary of the Eagle Rock Chamber of Commerce, filed suit, alleging that Shaw was not a citizen and therefore could not be sworn into office. It developed that Shaw's Canadian- born father had taken out his first U.S. citizenship papers in Hays City, Kansas, in 1887, but no record could be found of a final disposition. The matter was finally settled on July 24, 1933, when Shaw took the oath of allegiance to the United States, and Butler withdrew his suit.\\"Shaw for Porter,\\" Time, June 19, 1933\\"Shaw Is Sworn In As Citizen,\\" Los Angeles Times, July 25, 1933, page A-1 Warner Bros.

The first article, \\"The Lid Off Los Angeles,\\" ran in installments beginning November 11, 1939, and included the statement: > Until the boodling Shaw machine was handed its hat and a decent and > unfettered man was elected Mayor in September, 1938, the city of Los Angeles > for 20 years had been, almost uninterruptedly, run by an underworld > government invisible to the average citizen.\\"Writer Balks at Shaw Hearing,\\" > Los Angeles Times, November 23, 1940, page A-14 The second article was said to have been based on material furnished by the wife of anti-vice crusader Clifford Clinton under the title \\"My Husband's Death Struggle With the Vice Czars of Los Angeles.\\"\\"Shaw and Clinton Litigation Ended,\\" Los Angeles Times, April 29, 1943, page A-2 At the same time the Shaw suits were settled, a claim by Clifford Clinton against Shaw was also laid to rest.

He played in Major League Baseball as a shortstop from to for the Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals and the Chicago White Sox. A six-time All-Star, he was a light- hitting, defensive specialist who spent the majority of his career as the Chicago Cubs starting shortstop. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he was considered one of the best shortstops in baseball. Kessinger is also notable for being the last player-manager in American League history. Baseball career A four sport All-State and All-America athlete for the Forrest City High School Mustangs, Kessinger graduated high school in 1960 and went on to the University of Mississippi. During his collegiate years, he earned All- Conference, All-SEC, and All-America honors in both basketball and baseball for the Rebels, and was initiated into the Sigma Nu fraternity. Kessinger also played for the Peoria Pacers, of the Central Illinois Collegiate League (a summer league for collegiate players) in its founding year, 1963. He was signed by the Chicago Cubs as an amateur free agent on June 19, 1964. Kessinger was assigned to play for the Double-A Fort Worth Cats before making his major league debut on September 7, 1964. He returned to the minor leagues with the neophyte Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs for the 1965 season, but was brought back by the Cubs in June of that year and became their starting shortstop. The 1965 season would mark the first of nine consecutive seasons in which Kessinger would work alongside Cubs' second baseman Glenn Beckert. He ended the season hitting for a .201 batting average and led the National League shortstops in errors but, showed some promise by leading the league in range factor. As the 1966 season got underway, Kessinger continued to struggle with his hitting when, new Cubs manager Leo Durocher encouraged him to become a switch hitter. With the help of coach Pete Reiser, his hitting began to improve, posting for a .304 batting average during the second half of the season. Durocher made Kessinger his lead off hitter, a spot he would hold for many years. He ended the year with a career-high .274 batting average and led the league's shortstops with 474 assists. Kessinger in 1969 Kessinger continued to improve his fielding and in , he was recognized as one of the top shortstops in the league when he was voted to be the starting shortstop for the National League in the 1968 All-Star Game. At the end of the season, he ranked first among the league's shortstops in range factor and, led the entire league in assists. While he also led the league in errors, he attributed this to the fact that he reached more ground balls than the average shortstop. Kessinger repeated as an All-Star in 1969, in a year which saw the entire Chicago Cubs infield join him on the 1969 All-Star team, with Kessinger and Cubs' third baseman Ron Santo in the starting line-up. In , he set a major league single-season record for shortstops by playing in 54 games without committing an error, breaking the record previously set by Chico Carrasquel in . The Cubs were in first place in the National League Eastern Division for 180 days of the 1969 season, before going 8-17 in their final 25 games, while the New York \\"Miracle\\" Mets went 37-11 in their final 48 games to clinch the Eastern Division pennant. Despite the Cubs' late-season collapse, Kessinger scored 109 runs, hit for a .273 batting average with a career-high 181 hits, including 38 doubles; second-most in the league. He led the league's shortstops in putouts, finished second in fielding percentage and once again led the entire National League in assists. He finished in 15th place in balloting for the 1969 National League Most Valuable Player Award and won his first Gold Glove Award. In his book, The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, baseball historian Bill James cited manager Durocher's method of using his regular players everyday without any rest days as a factor in the Cubs' collapse. On September 9, 1969, Kessinger was in the batters box at Shea Stadium when a black cat emerged from under the stands. After staring at Kessinger and Santo (in the on-deck circle), it headed toward the Cubs' bench, where Durocher received a raised tail and hiss. During a July 4 interview in 1969 with then St. Louis Cardinals sportscaster Harry Caray, Cubs pitcher, Ferguson Jenkins, gave a name to Kessinger's trademark play at shortstop‚ÄîThe Down Pat. Children from throughout WGN's viewing audience widely copied it on playgrounds and in Little League games, and his fellow players typically stood in awe. Carey noted that Kessinger would regularly go to his right, toward left field, spear the ground ball and then, demonstrating a unique agility, reverse while in the air as he whipped the ball toward first base. \\"Do you think it might be because Don was a great basketball player?\\" asked Caray. Without hesitation, Jenkins responded, \\"In the past five games he's made many great plays to his right. Don has this play down pat.\\" Kessinger had another good season in 1970, producing a .266 batting average while scoring 100 runs. He led the entire league in assists for the third consecutive year and claimed his second Gold Glove Award. On June 17, 1971 he went 6-for-6, becoming the first Cubs with a six hit game in nearly 34 years. He continued to be one of the cornerstones of the Cubs' infield, earning three more All-Star berths in 1971, 1972 and 1974. In October 1975, after 11 seasons with the Cubs, Kessinger was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals‚Äîfor pitcher Mike Garman and infielder Bobby Hrapmann. He was the last remaining Cub from the 1969 season when they almost won the pennant. The 33-year-old Kessinger still played well in St. Louis, ending the season with a .320 on-base percentage and was second in the league in range factor. In August 1977, he was traded to the Chicago White Sox‚Äîfor pitcher Steve Staniland‚Äîwho were seeking to bolster their infield strength. The White Sox held a \\"Don Kessinger Night\\" on September 8, 1978, where 31,000 Chicago baseball fans (said to consist, in Baseball Digest, of nearly equal numbers of Sox and Cubs fans) thanked #11 for his years of service at shortstop. On October 19, 1978, White Sox President Bill Veeck named Kessinger to be the team's player-manager (the last in AL history). He was managing at Comiskey Park on July 12, 1979 when the infamous \\"Disco Demolition Night\\" took place, and wisely locked his players in the locker room between games, avoiding the near-riot. With the White Sox languishing in 5th place in the standings, Kessinger resigned on August 2, 1979 and was replaced by Tony La Russa. Career statistics In a 16-year major league career, Kessinger played in 2,078 games, accumulating 1,931 hits in 7,651 at bats for a .252 career batting average along with 14 home runs, 527 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .314. He retired with a .965 fielding percentage. A six-time All-Star, Kessinger won the National League Gold Glove for shortstops in and . In three different seasons with the Cubs, he turned 100 or more double plays. Kessinger had 6,212 assists during his career, ranking him 14th all-time among major league shortstops. In 1977 he was named the recipient of the Danny Thomas Memorial Award, for his exemplary Christian Spirit in Major League Baseball and, the following year he was the recipient of the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award, presented annually to the Major League baseball player who both on and off the field best exemplifies the character of Lou Gehrig. Kessinger received 0.5% of the vote on the Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1985, his only appearance on the balloting. Personal Kessinger married Carolyn Crawley‚Äîalso from Forrest City‚Äîin 1965. Their son Keith Kessinger was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in 1989 and had a brief career (nine years, minors and majors, in the Reds and Cubs organizations) as a professional baseball player, and son Kevin was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in 1992, but was sidelined during his first season with the Geneva (NY) Cubs by a back injury. Prior to the 1991 season, Kessinger was hired as the head baseball coach at his alma mater, the University of Mississippi. Kessinger would spend six years as the Ole Miss skipper, leading the Rebels to four 30-win seasons. His 1995 team produced a school record for wins, going 40-22 and earning the school's first NCAA Regional bid since 1977. Ole Miss finished on the verge of its first World Series appearance since 1972, placing second at the NCAA Atlantic I Regional behind host-Florida State. Both of his sons had the opportunity to play for their father at Ole Miss. Following the 1996 season, Kessinger resigned his head coaching position to become Mississippi's Associate Athletics Director for Internal Affairs, while concurrently serving as Chair of the NCAA Baseball Rules Committee. He finished with a six-year record of 185-153. Kessinger was an honoree at the 1976 Chicago Baseball Writers Diamond Dinner, where he was presented with the Ken Hubbs Award, given for exemplary conduct both on and off the field.35th Annual Diamond Dinner Program He has also honored by the Chicago(land) Sports Hall of Fame, Chicago Cubs Hall of Fame, Wrigley Field Walk of Fame, Ole Miss Sports Hall of Fame, Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame, National High School Sports Hall of Fame and the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame. He was also recognized as the 12th Best Athlete in the history of the Southeastern Conference in 2007 and named to the Ole Miss All-Century Basketball Team in 2008. Presently, he is the President of Kessinger Enterprises, Inc. and owns a real estate business in Oxford, Mississippi. While writing his 2012 novel \\"Calico Joe,\\"‚Äîdetailing a fictional young player on the Cubs in the early 1970s‚Äîauthor John Grisham drew from Kessinger's memories. \\"But Grisham gets the baseball right ‚Äì among the people he consulted while writing the book was Don Kessinger, a longtime friend who was the Cubs' slick-fielding shortstop in the period the flashback portion covers.\\" His grandson Grae Kessinger is a minor league player.

His uncle was the biologist J.B.S. Haldane and his grandfather the physiologist John Scott Haldane. His younger brothers are the zoologists Avrion Mitchison and the late Murdoch Mitchison. In 1954 Denis Mitchison's mother wrote the fantasy book Graeme and the Dragon, in which the protagonist is her grandson, Denis's son Graeme Mitchison. He was educated at the Dragon School, Oxford and Abbotsholme School, going on to Trinity College, Cambridge where he studied Natural Science obtaining a 1st class degree and a senior scholarship. He only then changed to Medicine, qualifying from University College in 1943, and chose postgraduate training in pathology. Career His first job in Pathology was at the Brompton Hospital at the time that the first clinical trial with a randomised intake between treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) with streptomycin or with bed rest alone was run. Mitchison then continued his lifelong interest in the treatment of TB participating in the clinical trials organised by the Medical Research Council's Tuberculosis Research Unit (MRC TRU) with Director Philip D'Arcy Hart. Following the decisive importance of drug-resistant tubercle bacilli in treatment, he was appointed in 1964 as Director of a new MRC Unit on Drug Resistance in Tuberculosis (later changed to MRC Unit for Laboratory Studies of Tuberculosis) at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School. He then worked closely with D'Arcy Hart at the MRC TRU and later with Wallace Fox, Director of the MRC Tuberculosis and Chest Diseases Research Unit on developing effective treatment for TB at a cost sufficiently low to be affordable in developing countries. =Research= The framework of this work was a series of clinical trials in the UK and in larger numbers in East Africa, India, Hong Kong, Singapore and Czechoslovakia. This work passed through two stages; the first dealt with the problem of drug-resistant tubercle bacilli, which was solved by the use of regimens incorporating 2, 3 or 4 different anti-tuberculosis drugs. Starting with a publication in 1970, the second phase dealt with the shortening the treatment period from at least 12 months to 6 months by using rifampicin and pyrazinamide in so-called \\"short-course\\" regimens which have been the basis of current standard therapy with 2 months of 4 drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) followed by 4 months of rifampicin and isoniazid. He established specialist TB laboratories in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia and a central laboratory in Hong Kong. =Publications= He published about 250 papers dealing with (1) factors slowing the growth of tubercle bacilli that might account for the lengthy duration of treatment, including the first paper on the effects of anaerobic culture; (2) with Jean Dickinson on post-antibiotic effects to account for the success of intermittent drug dosage; (3) the curious characteristics of attenuated South Indian strains of TB; (4) the response to treatment when the strains were initially resistant to the drugs allowing identification of the action of individual drugs. Post-retirement After his notional retirement in 1985, he continued working first at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith and then at St George's, University of London. He developed the technique of measuring the early bactericidal activity of drugs, which is now standard practice as the initial step in the phase II of clinical development of new drugs with Amina Jindani and colleagues in South Africa. He also introduced the concept of the 8-week phase II study with the proportion of patients obtaining negative sputum culture at 8 weeks, a standard assessment in most such studies. More recently he developed a new type of phase II 8-week study using modelling of counts of TB in sputum during treatment (with Geraint Davies and the South African MRC). He worked on several new anti-TB drugs and participated in clinical trials on high dosage rifamycins. Mitchison finally stopped regular work at the age of 95.

It was released in 1996 in North America. It is part of the Advanced Daisenryaku (Advanced World War) series which was developed by Systemsoft and published by Sega. Story Iron Storm is a strategy game that takes place within the context of World War II. The game's general premise is to allow players to pick a side (United States, Nazi Germany, or Japan) and then work their way across several battles within the war. The game takes place in both the Pacific Theatre and European Theatres. In addition, if a player wins certain battles then the path of the war changes. For example, Nazi Germany winning the Battle of Britain will allow for an eventual invasion of America, as will Japan defeating the United States at the Battle of Midway. Gameplay During battles in campaign mode, the player mobilizes a large variety of customizable units (tanks, aircraft, submarines, and warships) across a hexagon-shaped grid in order to defeat the opposing Allied or Axis forces controlled by the game's AI. In addition, as time progresses players can upgrade individual units either based on experience levels or as a blanket technology upgrade. Experimental weaponry is used in some later battles, including some German jet aircraft like the Messerschmitt Me 262. The map system itself is static, but real-time 3-D animations are used to recreate encounters between various types of units, an option that can also be toggled off. Release The game's North American publisher, Working Designs, donated 50 cents of every copy sold to the National Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. Reception Iron Storm was a minor hit in Japan. The game was positively received by critics. Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the game an 8 out of 10, praising the ability to view the outcome of each battle in cinematic view and the use of experience points. A Next Generation critic found that the cinematic sequences at least initially dispel the perception of strategy games as \\"dry\\", and noted that they can be turned off once their novelty fades and they become simply a means of slowing down the gameplay. He was pleased that the gameplay is more straightforward and simple than other offerings in the genre such as P.T.O. II, and found the game overall \\"ranks with the best of its strategy companions.\\" GamePros Scary Larry also found the game more accessible than other war simulators. He complimented the ability to name the commander for each country, the numerous unit types, the sounds, and the brutal depiction of warfare. He called the game \\"the best war sim to date ... and one of the most fun sims ever.\\" Electronic Gaming Monthly named Iron Storm a runner-up for Strategy Game of the Year (behind Dragon Force).

Biography  Mitchison was born in 1928, the son of the Labour politician Dick Mitchison (Baron Mitchison of Carradale in the County of Argyll, who died 1970) and his wife, the writer Naomi (n√©e Haldane). His uncle was the biologist J.B.S. Haldane and his grandfather the physiologist John Scott Haldane. His elder brothers are the bacteriologist Denis Mitchison and the zoologist Murdoch Mitchison. He is married to Lorna Margaret Martin, daughter of Maj-Gen John Simson Stuart Martin, CSI. They have five children, Tim, Matthew, Mary, Hannah and Ellen. Two are cell biologists Tim Mitchison and Hannah M. Mitchison. He was educated at Leighton Park School and secured a Classics scholarship to Balliol College. He received his DPhil at New College, Oxford with Nobelist Sir Peter Medawar. This was followed by a long career as Professor of Zoology at University College London, where his uncle J.B.S. Haldane taught, at the National Institute of Medical Research at Mill Hill and as founding Director of the German Rheumatism Research Center Berlin (DRFZ) in Germany. He is currently a Professor Emeritus at University College London. Mitchison's contributions to immunology include the discovery of both low dose and high dose tolerance for a single antigen, a surprising result in the context of basic clonal selection theory, but which can be understood in the context of immune network theory. He was also a founder member of the British Society for Immunology alongside John H. Humphrey, Bob White, and Robin Coombs.  Research  Mitchison discovered the transference of transplantation immunity by sensitised cells, thereby providing evidence relating transplantation immunity to hypersensitivity reactions of the 'delayed' type. He devised a method for revealing mixtures of cells of different genotypes in vivo and used it to be equal first in demonstrating that the 'radiation recovery factor' is a graft of living cells and not a humoral agent. He carried out the most exact quantitative analysis of tolerance hitherto attempted in a cellular system and proved that persistence of tolerance depends on persistence of antigen.

History The middle bridge over Antietam Creek, also near Sharpsburg, photographed September 1862 The term \\"Antietam\\" is thought to derive from an Algonquian phrase meaning \\"swift-flowing stream\\". Historical and variant names include Andiedom, Andirton Creek, Ant-eat-em Creek, Anticturn Creek, Antieatum Creek, Crooked Brook, Odieta Creek and Ondieta Creek. The creek is noted for numerous well-preserved stone arch bridges dating to the 19th century that still traverse the creek, the most famous of which is the Burnside's Bridge in the Antietam National Battlefield. The creek was a major topographic feature during the Battle of Antietam or Sharpsburg, fought on September 17, 1862, near the creek's mouth. Burnside's Bridge became a major focus of combat as Union forces under General Ambrose Burnside repeatedly tried to capture the bridge from Confederate forces guarding the crossing from a high bluff overlooking the creek. The day of the battle is known as \\"the day Antietam Creek ran red\\" due to the blood of thousands of Union casualties mixing with the creek waters. Both sides lost about a fourth of their number but, despite General McClellan's refusal to press on his attacks, it served as a tactical Union victory, as Lee was forced to withdraw from Maryland. Development and water quality issues Most of the watershed area is relatively rural in nature, but the area surrounding Hagerstown is threatened by urban sprawl. The area is also heavily cultivated, and waste runoff from farms is a growing water quality concern. The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) has identified farm runoff as the largest source of sediment (loose soil) in Antietam Creek and its tributaries. The second largest source is urban runoff. MDE recommends that farmers implement best management practices on their lands to control runoff, such as installing riparian buffers.

Johnson's professional baseball career lasted for 17 seasons, and included 8 years in the majors: parts of 1960‚Äì1962 and 1965, and then the full seasons of 1966 through 1969. He threw and batted right-handed and was listed as tall and . Johnson did not establish himself as a big-league regular until he was almost 33 years of age. He had trials with the Chicago Cubs (34 games played in 1960), Los Angeles Angels (only one appearance in 1961), and Milwaukee Braves (61 games in 1962). Only after he was summoned to the Los Angeles Dodgers from Triple-A Spokane, when the Dodgers lost regular outfielder Tommy Davis to a broken ankle on May 1, 1965, did Johnson earn a foothold in the major leagues. He became the Dodgers' regular left fielder during their 1965 world championship season, started over 60 games in both left and right fields in 1966 (during which the Dodgers captured their second straight National League pennant), and started another 85 games in the Dodger outfield in 1967. He remained in the majors for two more years as a reserve player, returning to the Cubs (1968) and Angels (1969) to bookend a stint with the Cleveland Indians (1968). He was employed by the Dodgers' Community Relations Department.  Early life  Johnson was born on September 22, 1934 in Lexington, Kentucky, to Sidney Bell and Shirley Johnson. He had three brothers and one sister. At Dunbar High School in Lexington, he played both basketball as well as baseball. Johnson desired to play basketball at the University of Kentucky under coach Adolph Rupp. However, at the time, not only were members of the Southeastern Conference (of which Kentucky is an affiliate) not recruiting black athletes, most of its universities were segregated.  Early baseball career  Johnson was signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1953. After moving around from team to team in the minor leagues for about a decade, he made his major league debut with the Chicago Cubs in 1960. The Cubs traded Johnson to the Los Angeles Angels for Jim McAnany on April 1, 1961, and he played in 61 games for the 1962 Milwaukee Braves. However, after that, the Braves traded Johnson to the Detroit Tigers system, which sent him back to the minor leagues for the 1963 and '64 seasons. They then traded him to the Los Angeles Dodgers for the pitcher Larry Sherry.  Los Angeles Dodgers  Johnson made it to the major leagues to stay for a stretch beginning in 1965 with the Dodgers when a broken ankle in early May sidelined Tommy Davis, their regular left fielder, for the remainder of the season. Johnson filled in for Davis, playing in 130 games for the Dodgers that season, recording a .260 batting average, 57 runs scored, and 58 runs batted in (RBIs). In that season, Johnson also scored the only run for the Dodgers in Sandy Koufax's perfect game victory when he walked, went to second base on a sacrifice bunt, stole third base, and then scored on a throwing error by the Chicago Cubs catcher, Chris Krug. The Dodgers made it to the 1965 World Series versus the Minnesota Twins, and in this Series, Johnson had eight hits, including two home runs, the second one being the game-winning one in the decisive seventh game. With Tommy Davis back in left field, and Willie Davis in center field, Johnson played mostly in right field in 1966. Frequently batting third in the order, right ahead of the dangerous hitter Tommy Davis, Johnson set career highs by playing in 152 games, getting 526 at- bats, 143 hits, 17 home runs, scoring 71 runs, with 73 RBIs. Johnson's batting average that season was .272, and the Dodgers made it to the World Series once again. This was also Koufax's last year in baseball before retiring because of his damaged and getting-worse left arm. In this World Series, against the Baltimore Orioles, the Dodgers' offence hit rock-bottom, with the team getting shut out three times, and only scoring two runs in the four games. Johnson finished the series with four hits in 15 at-bats. He also flew out to Paul Blair for the final out of the Series.  Later baseball years  From this point on, Johnson's major league career rapidly wound down, as he broke his leg sliding into Joe Torre and played in just 104 games for the Dodgers in 1967, a combined 127 for the Chicago Cubs and the Cleveland Indians in 1968, and just 67 for the California Angels in 1969, with only a .203 batting average. In 1970, at the age of 35, Johnson was out of professional baseball for good. In his approximately eight-year-long Major League career, Johnson posted a .258 overall average with 48 home runs and 232 RBI in 677 games played. Defensively, he recorded a .981 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions. Personal life Johnson and his wife, Sarah, had three children. He died on September 30, 2020.

(¬£2.25) to the Bishop of Chester, i.e. the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, the local diocesan bishop, in 1086. The value of the manor was the same as in 1066, although it had slipped in the interim period. Its value lay in its location on the River Severn its woodland, which was useful for agricultural and farming purposes. During this time period, the village had a total population of nine households, three of villeins, five of slaves and one the reeve. Due to this the village only had a total tax assessment of one geld unit which was very small. Buildwas had resources of 200 pigs and a mill which people relied on. The manor was assigned to Buildwas Abbey, originally founded as a Savigniac monastery, in 1135 by Roger de ClintonL. Janauschek. Originum Cisterciensium, p. 104 (1129‚Äì1148), Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. The Savigniac houses were later absorbed into the Cistercian order.

The second biggest field was retail and handicrafts, which employed seven people in the village. There was one capitalist or professional person within the village and the remaining people were farmers and servants. The 1881 census of the village gave valuable insight into how the population had slowly increased and how the jobs had diversified. Agriculture was still the biggest employment sector with 41 people but other job fields had grown over the course of fifty years. There were fifteen females and eight males employed in domestic services and offices. There were twelve males employed in the extraction of mineral substances and three people who worked in transport and commerce.

In 1811 the population had declined to 226 people but then experienced a gradual increase to 240 people in 1821 and stayed at this level through to 1831. Over the next ten years, the village had experienced a rapid population increase of 33 people in 1841 and in 1851 the population had increased again to 290 people.

He went to live with his older sister, Gussie, in Chicago, Illinois. His father's business failed when he was eight, and he financed his college education at the University of Illinois with multiple jobs that included washing dishes, waiting tables, and stoking a boarding-house furnace. He graduated with a journalism degree in 1941, and immediately joined the U.S. Army. His service included a year in the U.S. and three and a half years overseas during World War II.

GAP insurance protects the borrower if the car is totaled by paying the remaining difference between the actual cash value of a vehicle and the balance still owed on the financing. GAP coverage is mainly used on new and used small vehicles (cars and trucks) and heavy trucks. Some financing companies and lease contracts require it. GAP insurance covers the amount on a loan that is the difference between the amount owed and the amount covered by another insurance policy. Some GAP policies also cover the deductible. This coverage is marketed for low down payment loans, high interest rate loans and loans with 60 month or longer terms. GAP insurance is typically offered by a finance company at time of purchase. Most auto insurance companies offer this coverage to consumers. GAP insurance is usually paid upfront and, for that reason, one is eligible for a refund if he/she sells or refinances their vehicle. There are two ways of getting GAP coverage. The first type is an insurance policy sold by a broker. The second type is a waiver agreement sold by a Finance & Insurance Manager. The first is regulated by the insurance industry, the second is unregulated. In either case coverage is usually the same and sold as a soft product through the car dealership. Coverage is usually financed along with the lease/loan. Claims are subject to a total loss. The total loss is usually determined by the primary insurance company‚Äôs third-party appraiser. Exclusions to GAP insurance vary by country or state. Some exclusions include a maximum loss limit of $50,000 while others require a loan term of less than 84 months. GAP is an optional purchase; however, many states in the US require that a car dealership offer GAP at the point of purchase. Other states require insurers to offer GAP if a client requests it. States such as Louisiana require that the purchaser sign a disclosure document as proof. Although GAP is optional, some finance companies require GAP as a condition to obtaining a loan. The Truth in Lending Act excludes GAP premiums from financial charges if GAP was not required by the creditor, the premiums were disclosed in writing, and the consumer provides a written request for the insurance. UK Gap Insurance Update In September 2015, the FCA changed the way that Gap Insurance premiums are sold by car dealers in the UK. Claims ratios for GAP insurance (the amount paid out in comparison to premiums paid) were just 10% between 2008 and 2012, meaning that just ¬£10.00 was paid out for every ¬£100.00 paid in premiums. The poor value for money being given to consumers prompted the FCA to require the following: # Ensure dealers make consumers aware that other suppliers exist. # Delay the transaction by 4 business days.

The Code's goal specifically prohibits discrimination based on race, colour, gender identity or expression, sex, sexual orientation, disability, creed, age and other grounds. The code is administered by the Ontario Human Rights Commission and enforced by the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario. History The Human Rights Code was the first law of its kind in Canada. It replaced various laws that dealt with different kinds of discrimination. The Code brought them together into one law and added some new protections. The Code came into force on June 15, 1962. June 15 was chosen as the proclamation date for the Code because it was the 747th anniversary of the signing of the Magna Carta. The Code replaced the province‚Äôs existing anti-discrimination legislation, including: * Fair Employment Practices Act, 1951 which prohibited discrimination based on race and religion in employment; * Female Employee's Fair Remuneration Act, 1951 which prohibited an employer from paying a female employee less money for the same work done by a man in the same establishment * Fair Accommodation Practices Act, 1954 which prohibited discrimination in public places on racial, religious or ethnic grounds; * Ontario Anti-Discrimination Commission Act, 1958 which created a commission to administer the above acts and develop educational programs; At the same time that the Ontario Human Rights Commission was created, the government of the day, led by Premier Leslie Frost introduced an amendment to the Fair Accommodation Practices Act to prohibit discrimination because of race, colour or creed in the renting of apartments in buildings which contain more than six units. Grounds The Code prohibits discrimination on the grounds of race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, marital status, family status, disability, the receipt of public assistance (housing only), record of offences (employment only), or by association with a person identified by any of those grounds. The most recent amendment to this list was on June 19, 2012, to add gender identity and gender expression to the list of prohibited grounds. Administration The Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario (HRTO) is the administrative, quasi-judicial tribunal tasked with hearing complaints that the Code has been violated. It has the power to grant damages and specific performance to remedy discriminatory acts. The HRTO is subject to judicial review by the Divisional Court of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Before June 30, 2008, human rights complaints were filed with the Ontario Human Rights Commission (OHRC), which investigated claims of discrimination. Since June 30, 2008, claims of discrimination are filed directly with the HRTO, leaving the OHRC to concentrate its resources on systemic discrimination, public education and policy development. Content The Code is divided into an introductory section, or \\"preamble\\", followed by seven parts. *Part I sets out basic rights and responsibilities. *Part II explains how the code is interpreted and applied. *Part III explains the role and structure of the Ontario Human Rights Commission (OHRC). *Part IV explains the role and structure of the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario (HRTO). *Part IV.1 establishes the Human Rights Legal Support Centre (HRLSC) and sets out its governance. *Part V deals with general matters such as the power to make regulations and sets out that the Human Rights Code has primacy over other provincial legislation (section 47(2)). *Part VI of the Code deals with the transition from the \\"old\\" system, where complaints were investigated by the Ontario Human Rights Commission to the 'new\\" system (which took effect on June 30, 2008) where applications are now filed directly with the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario without any investigation. Application The Code does not apply to federally regulated activities, such as banking, intra-provincial transportation, aeronautics and telecommunications, which are subject to the Canadian Human Rights Act On this day October 6 2020 it shall be known that the Code be applied to all federally regulated activities in all occupations and The Code will now apply to federally regulated activities, such as banking, intra-provincial transportation, aeronautics and telecommunications, which are subject to the Human Rights Code of Canada]Respectfully and equally.

Panyo Panyo, however, did not have wide open endings like the original did. License Panyo Panyo Di Gi Charat is licensed by ADV Films and is distributed in the United States by them. It is distributed in Australia by Madman Entertainment. Principal characters Dejiko Dejiko - „Åß„Åò„Åì (also known as Di Gi Charat) The princess of planet Di Gi Charat. After reading a book about a famous philanthropist, she made a vow to bring happiness to every person who lives on Di Gi Charat. In order to leave the castle, she had to promise her teacher that she would take Gema along as a chaperon. She wears a white hat shaped like cat ears, with a pair of gold bells on it. She ends her sentences with \\"-nyo!\\". * Puchiko - „Å∑„Å°„Åì (also known as Petit Charat) A young companion of Dejiko. She speaks very infrequently. Her cat ear-shaped hat is orange with brown stripes on it. She ends her sentences with \\"-nyu\\". * Meek (Mike) - „Åø„Åë Meek might be called a \\"tomboy\\", and also has a tendency to yell. She and Dejiko occasionally disagree. She apparently dislikes sea slugs. Meek lives with her parents at a fish shop, and ends her sentences with \\"-mya\\". Incidentally, her mother and father also end their sentences with \\"-mya\\". * Rinna - „Çä„Çì„Å™ Rinna is the owner of her own cake shop. In episode 2, the townspeople claim that she makes the most delicious cakes on the planet; however, they have no idea when her shop will open, as Rinna has a tendency to fall asleep without warning. In a later episode, it is revealed that Rinna can run at an impossible speed; she does not usually do it because she \\"doesn't like to run.\\" Rinna ends her sentences with \\"-myu\\". Rinna also starred in Di Gi Charat Nyo!. * Piyoko - „Å¥„Çà„Åì (also known as Pyocola Analogue III ) A young girl who works for Deji Devil. Apparently, she is the leader of the Black Gema Gema Gang, despite being only six years old. She addresses Deji Devil as \\"Deji Devil-sama\\" (\\"Lord Deji Devil\\"; in the dub, she refers to him as \\"Boss\\"), but according to her character profile, she has little actual respect for him. Dejiko and company do not treat her or Deji Devil as a threat, going so far as to refer to Piyoko as \\"Piyoko-chan\\" as if they were close friends. Piyoko ends her sentences with \\"-pyo\\". * Deji Devil - „Éá„Ç∏„Éá„Éì„É´ Deji Devil's mission is apparently \\"to make everyone on Di Gi Charat unhappy\\". Thus, his and Dejiko's quests are somewhat mutually exclusive. Aside from his wings and cape, his body has no substance, therefore he is able to pass through objects. He supposedly is afraid of ghosts. He ends his sentences with \\"-devi\\". In one of the final episodes, it is revealed the Deji Devil can transform into a large pink, flying, panda-like being referred to as \\"The King of Demons\\". In this \\"King of Demons\\" form, he is no more solid than he is ordinarily; however, he gains the ability to fire lasers from his mouth. According to him, he doesn't usually use this form because \\"people might start to expect it\\". * Gema - „Ç≤„Éû Gema is a perfectly round, floating, yellow creature who accompanies Dejiko everywhere as a chaperon. According to his character profile page, most of Gema's data is unknown (including what species he is). He bears a slight resemblance to Pac-Man; the most notable feature about him is his apparently upside down face. *Favorite food: Red bean jam- filled buns * Songs ;Opening theme: \\"Happy! Smile! Hello!\\" performed by Atsuko Enomoto (Rinna). ;Closing theme: \\"Jounetsu no Paradise,\\" performed by Asami Sanada (Dejiko), Miyuki Sawashiro (Puchiko), Atsuko Enomoto (Rinna), and Etsuko Kozakura (Meek). Volumes Panyo Panyo Di Gi Charat DVDs have been released in DVD format across 4 volumes. Each is named after the sound that the main characters use at the end of their sentences. #Panyo Panyo Di Gi Charat - Nyo! #Panyo Panyo Di Gi Charat - Nyu! #Panyo Panyo Di Gi Charat - Mya! #Panyo Panyo Di Gi Charat - Myu!

The name is sometimes associated by scholars with the Teresh or Tursha, one of the groups which made up the Sea Peoples, a naval confederacy which terrorized Egypt and other Mediterranean around 1200 BCE. These Sea People are referred to as \\"Tursha\\" in an inscription of Ramesses III, and as \\"Teresh of the Sea\\" on the Merneptah Stele.The Bible for Home and School Macmillan, 1909 p. 90International Standard Bible Encyclopedia (1995) p. 859 Some other scholars associate Tiras with Thrace or the Etruscans. In 1838, the German scholar Johann Christian Friedrich TuchKommentar √úber die Genesis, pp. 216-217 216-217. suggested identifying Tiras with the Etruscans -- who, according to Greek and Roman sources such as Herodotus (I, 94), had been living in Lydia as the Tyrsenoi before emigrating to Italy as early as the 8th century BC. Ancient and Medieval Identifications According to the Book of Jubilees, the inheritance of Tiras consisted of four large islands in the ocean. Josephus wrote that Tiras became ancestor of the \\"Thirasians\\" (Thracians) ‚Äî a \\"flame-haired\\" (red or blond haired) people according to Xenophanes (Antiquities of the Jews, I, 6). Tiras or Tyras in antiquity was also the name of the Dniester river, and of a Greek colony situated near its mouth; the native inhabitants of the surrounding region Tyragetae. The Getae were one of the major components of the Thracians (Herodotus 4.93, 5.3), who the Greeks held to descend from the eponymous Thrax. The Greek geographer and philosopher Strabo (63 BC ‚Äì AD 24) enumerated twenty-two ethnical groups in all the Thrace. Histories of Herodotus noticed Crobyzian Thracians (Hist. IV, 49), the Dolonci (VI, 34), the \\"Brygi a tribe of Thracians‚Äù (VI, 45), the Sinties of Lemnos (VII, 45), and others placed in the Nestus and Strymin Valley (VII, 110): Paeti, Cicones, Bistones, Sapaei, Dersaei, Edoni, and Satrae. Movses Khorenatsi, 5th century Armenian historian, attributed the founder of Armenian nation, Hayk, to being a grandson of Tiras. According to tractate Yoma, in the Talmud, Tiras is the ancestor of Persia. The Persian historian Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari (c. 915) recounts a tradition that Tiras had a son named Batawil, whose daughters Qarnabil, Bakht, and Arsal became the wives of Cush, Put, and Canaan, respectively. The mediaeval Hebrew compilation, the Chronicles of Jerahmeel, aside from quoting Yosippon as above, also provides a separate tradition of Tiras' sons elsewhere, naming them as Maakh, Tabel, Bal‚Äôanah, Shampla, Meah, and Elash. This material was ultimately derived from Pseudo-Philo (ca. 75 AD), extant copies of which list Tiras' sons as Maac, Tabel, Ballana, Samplameac, and Elaz. Another medieval rabbinic text Book of Jasher (7:9) records the sons of Tiras as Benib, Gera, Lupirion, and Gilak, and in 10:14, it asserts that Rushash, Cushni, and Ongolis are among his descendants. An earlier (950 AD) rabbinic compilation, the Yosippon, similarly claims Tiras' descendants to be the Rossi of Kiv, i.e. Kievan Rus, listing them together with his brother Meshech's supposed descendants as \\"the Rossi; the Saqsni and the Iglesusi\\". = Modern interpretations = English theologian John Gill (1697-1771) about Tiras affirmed that \\"[interpreted] better the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem, and so a Jewish chronologer, by Thracia; for the descendants of Thiras, as Josephus observes, the Greeks call Thracians; and in Thrace was a river called Athyras, which has in it a trace of this man's name; and Odrysus, whom the Thracians worshipped, is the same with Tiras, which god sometimes goes by the name of Thrax; and is one of the names of Mars, the god of the Thracians.\\"., based on the King James Bible, with ending footnotes He also appears equivalent to the Zoroastrian character Tur, who appears in the Persian epic, the Shahnameh. Tiras was also worshipped by his descendants as Taranis (Tyr), the god of war, the river Athyras was also named after him, and the ancient city of Troy (Truwisa, Troi, Troia, the Trojans) perpetuates his name Tros, as also does the Taurus mountain range. By virtue of Greek documents, the descendants of Tiras has been identified with the Thyrsenoi, \\"who raided throughout the Aegean sea\\"; and by Tursha (Turusha or Teresh) by Egyptian records at the time of pharaons Merneptah and Ramses II. There exist also a possible concern with the Hittite language Taruisa, old city of Troy.

He released a number of albums under the name Appendix Out and, following the 2001 album The Night Is Advancing, under his own name. Roberts is also known for his frequent collaborations with other musicians and writers, as well as for being a member of the folk supergroup The Furrow Collective. Early life Roberts was born in Swabia, Germany, the son of former folk guitarist (and partner of Dougie MacLean) Alan Roberts (1946‚Äì2001) and his German wife Annegret. He has two sisters. He was raised in Kilmahog, a hamlet close to the small town of Callander, near Stirling in central Scotland, where he started playing the guitar and writing music. He has long been based in Glasgow. Appendix Out In 1994 Alasdair Roberts formed Appendix Out with school friends Dave Elcock and Kenny McBride and started playing small venues. Roberts was also a classmate of Ladytron's Helen Marnie. While attending a Will Oldham concert in 1995, he offered a demo tape to the American singer, and a contract with US label Drag City soon followed. The band's first release was a double A-side single, \\"Pissed With You/Ice Age\\", and the band released its first album around a year later. Between 1997 and 2001, Appendix Out released three albums, two EPs and some limited-edition recordings that were never widely distributed. They recorded a session for John Peel's BBC radio show in 2001. The line up of the band changed frequently, with Roberts the only constant member. Solo career After three full-length albums with Appendix Out, Roberts recorded his first solo album, The Crook of My Arm. This album consisted almost entirely of solo vocals and guitar in marked contrast to the occasionally experimental sound of the Appendix Out records. All the songs are traditional, and Roberts credited the singers from whose performances he'd learnt the songs (these included his father, Alan Roberts, and Alan's sometime musical partner, Dougie MacLean). Since then, Roberts has released two further albums of traditional folk songs - No Earthly Man and Too Long in This Condition - plus three albums of original songs: Farewell Sorrow, The Amber Gatherers and Spoils. A fourth, A Wonder Working Stone, was released in January 2013, credited to Alasdair Roberts and Friends, a group of musicians which includes among others Stevie Jones, Rafe Fitzpatrick, Olivia Chaney and Alex Neilson. In 2015 Roberts released a self-titled album, a return to relative sparseness of earlier albums, and in 2017 Pangs, which was again a more collaborative album, featuring musicians with whom Roberts has previously worked - Stevie Jones, Tom Crossley and Alex Neilson - and backing vocals from Debbie Armour. Each album has a distinct character, and Roberts songwriting has shifted in recent years from the relative economy of Farewell Sorrow and The Amber Gatherers to a much denser wordplay, filled with allusions to mythology, esoteric spirituality and gnosticism, on Spoils and other recent releases. In 2012, musician Steve Adey covered \\"Farewell Sorrow\\" on his The Tower of Silence album. Collaborations Roberts is quoted as saying \\"Collaboration is extremely important to me. I reiterate ‚Äì extremely\\". His collaborations have taken many forms. =Accompanying musicians= A large number of musicians have played with Alasdair Roberts when recording or performing under his own name. These include: *Electric bass: Gerard Love, Gareth Eggie, Bill Lowman, Will Oldham, Paul Oldham *Stand-up bass: Stevie Jones *Fiddle: Rafe Fitzpatrick, Alastair Caplin, Elle Osborne, John McCusker *Drums: Alex Neilson, Shane Connolly, Rian Murphy, Tom Crossley *Guitar: Gordon Ferries, Gareth Eggie, RM Hubbert *Cello: Isobel Campbell, Christine Hanson *Piano: Tom Crossley, Isobel Campbell, Emily MacLaren *Vocals: Emily Portman, Will Oldham, Tom Crossley, Niko-Matti Ahti, Debbie Armour *Jouhikko: Pekko K√§ppi *Viol: Alison McGillivray *Harpsichord, harmonium: David McGuiness *Harp: Kirsten Koppel, Bill Lowman *Pipes: Donald Lindsay =Group, ensemble and duo work= *In 2001, Roberts collaborated with friends and label-mates Will Oldham and Jason Molina, both playing on their albums and on the one-off album, Amalgamated Sons of Rest. *With members of the Second Hand Marching Band, Roberts is part of The Robert Tannahill Project, dedicated to performing the songs of Scots poet Robert Tannahill. *Roberts took part in a week-long residency in Aldeburgh, titled \\"Revenge of the Folksingers\\" and led by Concerto Caledonia's David McGuinness, in December 2010. Other participants included the members of Concerto Caledonia, Jim Moray and Olivia Chaney. Roberts contributed an original song, as well as singing songs by Ivor Cutler, Benjamin Britten, Hamish Henderson and from the traditional repertoire. An album with the same title and selection of songs was released in 2011. *In 2010, Roberts performed a suite of songs written by the Icelandic artist Benni Hemm Hemm as part of the Reykjavik Arts Festival *Roberts collaborated with Karine Polwart on a series of performances in Stirling, London and Sidmouth Folk Week in 2010 and 2011 (also joined by Corrina Hewat in Stirling and London). The pair released a recording of the traditional song, Captain Wedderburn's Courtship, as a 7\\" single in 2011. *Roberts collaborated with Mairi Morrison, a Glasgow-based Gaelic singer from the Isle of Lewis, on an album of traditional songs, Urstan, released in March 2012. *The Fruit Tree Foundation is a mental health initiative featuring nine Scottish songwriters, writing mainly in pairs. Roberts contributed songs with James Yorkston and Rod Jones to the resulting album, First Edition. *Roberts contributed to Pumajaw's Curiosity Box album (2008), and, as writer and performer, to Jackie Oates' Hyperboreans album. *With Alex Neilson, Lavinia Blackwall and Michael Flower ‚Äì under the group name Black Flowers ‚Äì Roberts played on the album I Grew From a Stone to a Statue. *Roberts sang the lead vocals on Draughty Old Fortress on David Rotheray's album The Life of Birds. *Roberts collaborated with RM Hubbert on a version of The False Bride for Hubbert's 2012 album, Thirteen Lost & Found (Chemikal Underground, CHEM166). *Roberts appeared on tracks of the 2013 album by Lisa Knapp, Hidden Seam. *Along with Emily Portman, Lucy Farrell and Rachel Newton, Roberts is part of The Furrow Collective. They have released three albums: At Our Next Meeting (2014), Wild Hog (2016) and Fathoms (2018). =Theatre, film and literary work= *Roberts played hurdy-gurdy on the soundtrack of the 2003 film Young Adam. This was later released under the title Lead Us Not into Temptation by David Byrne. *Roberts contributed a newly written song, Dighty Burn, as soundtrack Edward Summerton and Michael Windle's 2011 short film Dighty. *In early 2011, Roberts took part in a three-month residency at the School of Scottish Studies, under the title \\"Archive Trails\\". He collaborated with puppet maker and puppeteer, Shane Connolly, on two short pieces of musical theatre: The Secret Society of Horsemen and a reworking of the Scots mummers play, Galoshins, for puppets. *Roberts has collaborated with the artist and filmmaker Luke Fowler on a video for his song Under No Enchantment (But My Own) and by contributing music to the soundtrack of Fowler's 2011 film about R.D. Laing All Divided Selves. *Roberts first worked with the Scots poet Robin Robertson on a song for the 2007 album of musician- poet collaborations, Ballads of the Book. The two have since gone on to collaborate on a song cycle based upon the archipelago of St Kilda. =Testimonials and additional contributions= Roberts has contributed to the following: *Lal Waterson ‚Äì performance at Cecil Sharp House, London, in October 2007, as part of BBC Electric Proms, plus a recording of Waterson's The Bird for the tribute album Migrating Bird, curated by Charlotte Greig *The Incredible String Band ‚Äì performance at the Barbican Centre, London, in July 2009, curated by Joe Boyd and also featuring Robyn Hitchcock, Trembling Bells, Dr Strangely Strange and others. *Neil Young ‚Äì performance at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre, Vancouver, in February 2010, curated by Hal Wilner as part of the Cultural Olympiad. *Alistair Hulett ‚Äì Roberts recorded a version of Hulett's The Dark Loch for the tribute album Love, Loss and Liberty: The Songs of Alistair Hulett, released in 2011 after the latter's death. *Jason Molina ‚Äì Roberts recorded a version of Molina's Being in Love for the benefit album Do I Have to be Alright, All of the Time?, released for download in 2012 and performed at a benefit concert in London in September 2012. *Alan Lomax ‚Äì Roberts was asked by Nathan Salsburg of the Alan Lomax Archive to curate an album of the recordings of traditional Scottish songs that Alan Lomax collected, resulting in the compilation album Whaur The Pig Gaed on the Spree (2011).

Its source is in the Totes Gebirge mountain range in Styria. It flows through the Salzkammergut area and the lakes Hallst√§tter See and Traunsee. The Traun is a right tributary of the Danube, which it meets near the city of Linz. Other towns along the river are Bad Aussee, Bad Ischl, Gmunden, Wels and Traun. Until the late 19th century, it was only possible to reach Hallstatt (at the Hallst√§tter See) by boat or via narrow trails. However, this secluded and inhospitable landscape nevertheless counts as one of the first places of human settlement due to the rich sources of natural salt, which was mined for thousands of years, originally in the shape of hearts. Some of Hallstatt's oldest archaeological finds, such as a shoe-last celt ‚Äì a long thin stone tool used to fell trees and to work wood ‚Äì date back to around 5000 B.C. One of the first blacksmith's sites was excavated there. Active trade and thus wealth allowed for the development of a highly sophisticated society, hence the term Hallstatt culture. In 1846, a large prehistoric cemetery was discovered close by the current location of Hallstatt. There is little room for cemeteries so every ten years bones used to be exhumed and removed into an ossuary to make room for new burials. A collection of elaborately decorated skulls with the owners' names, professions, death dates inscribed on them is on display at the local chapel.

An ideal differential amplifier would have infinite CMRR, however this is not achievable in practice. A high CMRR is required when a differential signal must be amplified in the presence of a possibly large common-mode input, such as strong electromagnetic interference (EMI). An example is audio transmission over balanced line in sound reinforcement or recording.  Theory  Ideally, a differential amplifier takes the voltages, V_+ and V_- on its two inputs and produces an output voltage V_\\\\mathrm{o}=A_\\\\mathrm{d}(V_+ - V_-), where A_\\\\mathrm{d} is the differential gain. However, the output of a real differential amplifier is better described as : :V_{\\\\mathrm{o}} = A_\\\\mathrm{d} (V_+ - V_-) + \\\\tfrac{1}{2} A_\\\\mathrm{cm} (V_+ + V_-) where A_\\\\mathrm{cm} is the common-\\"mode gain\\", which is typically much smaller than the differential gain. The CMRR is defined as the ratio of the powers of the differential gain over the common- mode gain, measured in positive decibels (thus using the 20 log rule): :\\\\mathrm{CMRR} = \\\\left (\\\\frac{A_\\\\mathrm{d}}{A_\\\\mathrm{cm}} \\\\right) = 10\\\\log_{10} \\\\left (\\\\frac{A_\\\\mathrm{d}}{A_\\\\mathrm{cm}} \\\\right)^2 \\\\text{dB} = 20\\\\log_{10} \\\\left (\\\\frac{A_\\\\mathrm{d}}{A_\\\\mathrm{cm}} \\\\right) \\\\text{dB} As differential gain should exceed common-mode gain, this will be a positive number, and the higher the better. The CMRR is a very important specification, as it indicates how much of the common-mode signal will appear in your measurement. The value of the CMRR often depends on signal frequency as well, and must be specified as a function thereof. It is often important in reducing noise on transmission lines. For example, when measuring the resistance of a thermocouple in a noisy environment, the noise from the environment appears as an offset on both input leads, making it a common-mode voltage signal. The CMRR of the measurement instrument determines the attenuation applied to the offset or noise.

By the late 1880s lamellar grafts were considered to have a better chance of success than full-thickness corneal grafting which invariably failed a few days after the operation. In 1905, Zirm encountered a patient Alois Glogar, a 45-year-old day farm labourer from a small town in the Czech Republic whose corneas in both eyes had tuned white- bray and opaque a year earlier while working with slaking lime. Around the same time he examined Glogar, an 11-year-old boy named Karl Brauer was brought to Zirm's clinic with penetrating eye-injury to both eyes and iron metal foreign bodies irretrievably lodged in his eyes. When attempts to save Brauer's eyes were unsuccessful, Zirm, with the boy's father's permission enucleated them and saved the corneas for transplantation into Glogar's. Although complications affected one eye, the other remained clear allowing Glogar to return to work. The operation and the consequent healing processes were difficult at that time because without a microscope and microsurgical instruments it was impossible to suture the donor cornea to the host tissue. Therefore, Zirm successfully sutured the conjunctival tissue over the graft- host junction. During the twentieth century, parallel advances in microscopy, microsurgical instrumentation anaesthesia and asepsis have led to the increasing success of keratoplasty.Centennial review of corneal transplantation. (Clin Experiment Ophthalmol. 2005) - PubMed Result at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Zirm 's method remains the basis for repairing corneal damage. Interests outside ophthalmology Zirm played the violin and in his limited spare time studied natural philosophy. His 1937 publication of Die Welt als F√ºhlen discussed ideas now called emotional intelligence for the first time. He also wrote many poems and stories. Zimr died in 1944 in Olomouc, Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Legacy At the jubilee lecture relative to corneal transplant, Prof. B√∂ck, the long-time head of the Second Ophthalmology Department at the University in Vienna said: :\\"The name of Dr. Eduard Zirm will always be connected with the great accomplishment of this medical technique. With pride the Ophthalmology Department of the University of Vienna includes him as one of its own\\". In 2006, in a review of Zirm's landmark paper on his first successful full thickness corneal transplant, three English ophthalmologists concluded in the British Journal of Ophthalmology: :\\"\\"Zirm showed undoubted skill and insight, but serendipity, as with many advances in medicine and science, must also have played some part in this remarkable achievement that paved the way for the successful treatment of many thousands of patients around the world with corneal disease\\".\\" References External links * Dr. Zirm - Die erste gegl√ºckte Organtransplantation - 1905 at www.drzirm.org =Pub med= * *.  * Category:1863 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Austrian ophthalmologists Category:Physicians from Vienna Category:University of Vienna alumni ","title":"Eduard Zirm"},{"id":"1905943","text":"Lake Tuz ( meaning 'Salt Lake'; anciently Tatta - (, )) is the second largest lake in Turkey with its surface area and one of the largest hypersaline lakes in the world. It is located in the Central Anatolia Region, northeast of Konya, south-southeast of Ankara and northwest of Aksaray. Geography Salty shores of Lake Tuz. The lake, occupying a tectonic depression in the central plateau of Turkey, is fed by two major streams, groundwater, and surface water, but has no outlet. Brackish marshes have formed where channels and streams enter the lake. Arable fields surround the lake, except in the south and southwest where extensive seasonally flooded salt-steppe occurs. For most of the year, it is very shallow (approx.). During winter part of the salt is dissolved in the fresh water that is introduced to the lake by precipitation and surface runoff (to 324‚Ä∞ salinity). During the summer the lake dries up exposing an average of 30 cm thick salt layer in August. This mechanism is used as a basis for the process of the salt mines in the lake. The three mines operating in the lake produce 63% of the salt consumed in Turkey. The salt mining generates industrial activity in the region, mainly related to salt processing and refining. In 2001, Lake Tuz was declared a specially protected area, including all of the lake surface and surrounding waterbeds and some of the important neighboring steppe areas. The main Turkish breeding colony of greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus) is present on a group of islands in the southern part of the lake. Greater white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) is the second largest breeder here. Lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) is a common breeder in surrounding villages. History Anciently, the lake was called Tatta, and was located on the frontiers between ancient Lycaonia and Galatia; it had originally belonged to Phrygia, but was afterwards annexed to Lycaonia. The ancients reported that its waters were so impregnated with brine, that any substance dipped into it, was immediately encrusted with a thick coat of salt; even birds flying near the surface had their wings moistened with the saline particles, so as to become incapable of rising into the air, and to be easily caught.Dioscorid. 5.126. Stephanus of Byzantium speaks of a salt lake in Phrygia, which he calls Attaea (·ºåœÑœÑŒ±ŒπŒ±), near which there was a town called Botieum, and which is probably the same as Lake Tatta.

After living as a hermit near Chartres for fourteen years, he made a pilgrimage to Rome. Pope Gregory II sent him to Bavaria. His opposition to the marriage of Duke Grimoald to his brother's widow, Biltrudis, caused Corbinian to go into exile for a time. His feast day is 8 September. The commemoration of the translation of his relics is 20 November. Life Corbinian was born and baptized as Waldegiso at Ch√¢tres, near Melun, in Frankish territory. He was named after his father, who may have died when Corbinian was an infant. Soon after his father's death, his mother CorbinianaSee Helmut Zenz: Heiliger Korbinian im Internet (Retrieved on 2007-01-06), in which Corbinian's mother is referred to as \\"Corbiniana\\". (German - Nach dem Tod seiner Mutter Corbiniana lebte er als Eremit bei der Kirche von Saint-Germain bei Ch√¢tres. English - \\"After the death of his mother Corbiniana he lived as a hermit in the church of Saint Germain in Ch√¢tres\\") renamed Waldegiso to \\"Corbinian\\", after herself. Nothing else is known of his childhood. The early source for Corbinian's life is the Vita Corbiniani of Bishop Arbeo of Freising.Published in Scriptores rerum Germanicarum 13, Monumenta Germaniae Historica. The writings of Arbeo are of broader significance, as all but the only examples of the Latin used in Bavaria before the Carolingian literary reforms. The modern study is Lothar Vogel, 2000. Vom Werden Eines Heiligen: Eine Untersuchung Der Vita Corbiniani Des Bischofs Arbeo Von Freising (series \\"Arbeiten Zur Kirchengeschichte\\". Walter De Gruyter). He lived in Ch√¢tres on the road to Orl√©ans as a hermit for fourteen years, near a church dedicated to Saint Germain. His reputation attracted students to him, which distracted him from his hermitage. His devotion to Saint Peter the Apostle prompted a decision to make a journey to Rome, accompanied by some of the disciples. While in Rome, Pope Gregory II admonished him to use his talents to evangelize Bavaria. Corbinian, who may already have been a bishop or who was so consecrated by Gregory, was sent to minister to Grimoald, the Frankish Duke of Bavaria. Corbinian probably arrived in Bavaria in 724. On a mountain near Freising, where there was already a sanctuary, the saint erected a Benedictine monastery and a school, which came to be governed by his brother Erembert, after his death. In 738, when Saint Boniface regulated the ecclesial structure in the Duchy of Bavaria by creating four dioceses to be governed by the archbishop of Mainz, Erembert was chosen first Bishop of Freising. Saint Corbinian of Freising and the Bear, by Cosmas Damian Asam, c. 1725 Soon after settling, Corbinian denounced Grimoald's marriage to his brother's widow, Biltrudis, though Grimoald had already repented of his incest. This incited his anger and the chagrin of his wife, who excoriated Corbinian, labeling him a foreign interloper. Finally, she arranged to have him murdered. Corbinian fled Freising until Grimoald was killed and Biltrudis carried off by invaders in 725. Corbinian returned on the invitation of Grimoald's successor, Huebert, and continued his apostolic labors at Freising until his own death in 730. Corbinian's body, buried at Merano, was translated to Freising in 769 by the aforementioned Bishop Arbeo, author of Corbinian's vita, and is now entombed in Freising Cathedral. Corbinian's bear Corbinian's symbol is the saddled bear. According to his hagiography, a bear killed Corbinian's pack horse on the way to Rome and so the saint commanded it to carry his load. Once he arrived in Rome, however, he let the bear go, and it lumbered back to its native forest. Both the heraldic element and the legend itself carry significant symbolism. One interpretation is that the bear tamed by God's grace is the Bishop of Freising himself and the pack saddle is the burden of his episcopate. The bear's submission and retreat can also be interpreted as Christianity's \\"taming\\" and \\"domestication\\" of the ferocity of paganism and, consequentially, the laying of a \\"[foundation] for a great civilization in the Duchy of Bavaria.\\" =In Catholic iconography= Papal Arms of Pope Benedict XVI Corbinian's Bear is used as the symbol of Freising in both civic and ecclesiastical heraldry. It appeared on the arms of Pope Benedict XVI, who first adopted the symbol when, still known as Joseph Ratzinger, he was appointed Archbishop of Freising-Munich in March 1977. He retained the bear in his revised coat of arms when he was elevated to Cardinal in June of the same year, and again on his papal coat of arms when he was elected in 2005. The scallop shell is a traditional reference to pilgrimage. For Pope Benedict XVI, it also reminded him of the legend according to which one day St. Augustine, pondering the mystery of the Trinity, saw a child at the seashore playing with a shell, trying to put the water of the ocean into a little hole. Then he heard the words: This hole can no more contain the waters of the ocean than your intellect can comprehend the mystery of God. The crowned Moor is a regional motif in heraldry often seen in Bavaria, Benedict's German homeland. Benedict has been quoted saying that, in addition to the obvious reference back to Saint Corbinian, the founder of the diocese where Benedict would become bishop in 1977, the bear represents Benedict himself being \\"tamed by God\\" to bear the spiritual burdens of Benedict's own ministries first as bishop, then as cardinal, and now as pope.Ratzinger, Joseph.

During 2004 they were joined by Greg Royal on bass guitar and Gerard Masters on keyboards. In August 2005 they released their debut self-titled album which provided the singles, \\"Little Miss Liar\\" (June) and \\"Free\\" (August). They disbanded late that year as Silverchair prepared to record their next album, Young Modern. In November 2008 Carr won the sixth season of Australian Idol. History Tambalane were formed late in 2003 in Sydney by Ben Gillies (Silverchair) on drums and backing vocals, and Wes Carr on lead vocals and lead guitar. In June that year Silverchair had announced an extended hiatus after touring in support the previous year's album, Diorama. The pair met in a local pub where Carr was performing solo after being introduced by Silverchair's manager, John Watson. They started as a songwriting project for Gillies, aside from his work with Silverchair, and Carr, who issued a solo folk rock extended play, Rhythm to Fly, in November. In 2005 Gillies remembered \\"Wes and I wrote a couple of tracks that first day to test the water ... Next thing you know we went into overdrive ‚Äì it wasn't long before we had 30 or 40 songs\\". In 2004 Tambalane began performing as a band, Carr and Gillies were soon joined by Greg Royal on bass guitar and Gerard Masters on keyboards. They signed with Watson's label Eleven: A Music Company. Their sound was influenced by The Beatles and Led Zeppelin. Early in 2005 they issued their debut single, \\"Little Miss Liar\\" and toured Australia supporting End of Fashion. In June they released an EP, Free, which had been recorded at Megaphon Studio, Sydney with Phil McKellar (Silverchair) producing. It was followed, on 21 August 2005, by their debut self-titled album, co-produced by McKellar and Gillies. For the studio sessions additional guitars were supplied by Steve Edmonds and Ben Nightingale. Mess+Noise website's Ben Gook warned Silverchair fans that \\"[t]hose hoping for a Silverchair Jr would be disappointed ... Over produced, under written and deceptively bland ... manages to fall in some awkward place between half-arsed and over-reaching\\". Faster Louder's reviewer observed it was \\"so sugar-coated, you feel the cavities appearing track by track ... lyrics on the album, seemingly peeled straight from a motivational poster, those annoying sayings that are plastered over high school classroom walls\\". In September Tambalane undertook a national tour to promote the album. Gillies told The Dwarf website that he looked forward to \\"[p]laying with Tambalane in small venues and really getting back to my grass roots is extremely fun\\". Faster Louder's Yasmin Wilding reviewed their mid-September gig at The Yallah Roadhouse, \\"[Carr]'s got one of the best live rock voices I've heard in a long time ... Gillies ... is an exceptional drummer ... [able] to keep ... the crowd bopping ... I've never seen a keyboardist groove as much as [Masters] ... He and bass player [Royal] gave us impressive solos during the set, proving the worth and versatility of their instruments ... Together, Tambalane were an unstoppable force of entertainment, bustin' out massive tunes\\". By November 2005 Tambalane had disbanded with Gillies returning to Silverchair and preparing for their next album, Young Modern. Carr resumed his solo career. Gillies stated that \\"It became an unpleasant power struggle\\" within Tambalane. In November 2008 Carr won the sixth season of Australian Idol. In May 2011 Silverchair announced an \\"indefinite hibernation\\", in the following month Gillies was working on a new album but denied that any new project would be similar to Tambalane.

Health, in general, is defined in the World Health Organization (WHO) constitution as ‚Äúa state of complete physical, mental, and social well being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\\". The circumstance of Chinese women‚Äôs health is highly contingent upon China‚Äôs historical contexts and economic development during the past seven decades. A historical perspective on women's health in China entails examining the healthcare policies and its outcomes for women in the pre-reform period (1949-1978) and the post-reform period since 1978. In general, women‚Äôs health in China has seen significant improvements since the foundation of People‚Äôs Republic of China in 1949, witnessed by improvements in multiple indexes such as Infant Mortality Rate(IMR), Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI), etc. However, due to traditional Chinese ideology on gender inequality and complexities of Chinese political system, challenges in terms of many aspects of women‚Äôs health, such as reproductive health and HIV/AIDS, are still mounting. History of Women's Health in China =Pre-reform China (1949-1978)= After Chinese communist party took over China in 1949, they established the first public healthcare system in China called Cooperative Medical Scheme (CMS), which devotes much attention to meeting the needs of the country‚Äôs huge rural population. The CMS was consisted of a three-tier system: barefoot doctors, township health centers, and country hospitals. In the end of the 1970s, over 90% of rural villages had set up cooperative medical schemes (CMS). The implementation of CMS has seen significant improvement in population health in China, including female health. Studies by Mei-yu Yu et al. found that the female Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) declined from 170 per 1000 in 1953 to 136 in 1957, and female average life expectancy at birth rose from 44.8 in 1949 to 67.1 in 1975. Contrary to what Chinese census has manifested, Banister‚Äôs studies have shown that female IMR is higher than male IMR in China at least since 1975. Mei Yu-yu et al. believed that such a discrepancy in IMR between female and male could be a result of preference for sons in traditional Chinese ideology, which may cause abandonment, unequal treatment or violence against female infants. =Economic reform (1979‚Äìpresent)= Since 1978 China has been systematically moving away from a socialist economy and toward a capitalist system. With the intention to increase efficiency and improve standards of living, China has implemented far-reaching reforms: decollectivization and land tenure reforms, promotion of township and village enterprises (TVEs), state sector reforms, and policies to encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) and trade liberalization. These policies were implemented as China moved to a market economy and were furthered in order to insure their membership to the World Trade Organization (WTO). These policies are hailed by many as being highly successful, producing massive economic growth while raising the standard of living by reducing poverty. China has taken a gradual and highly regulated approach to its transformation, and while China started its transformation earlier than other socialist countries. it is still undergoing that transformation. These measures have led to much growth, and as China continues to increase its GDP at breakneck pace, those same policies have led to decentralization and privatization of healthcare. Women‚Äôs health in China is among the most prevalent casualties of this economic transformation. Health and dormitory life As the market opened new employment, opportunities for women became available. Those new opportunities were primarily in the service and textile industries. The number of Chinese women working as of 2007 was 330 million which is now 46.7% of the total working population, the majority of these women are working in the agricultural or industrial sectors with a high concentration working in the garment industry. These industries lend themselves to dormitory living. These dormitories are filled with migrant workers, none of whom can stay in the urban areas without being employed. Young women have become the most prevalent demographic for migrant work, making up over 70% of those employed in the garment, toy, and electronic industries. These women now called dagongmei are typically short term laborers who are contracted for a short period of time and at the end of their contracts they either find more work or are forced to return home. That type of labor contract leaves these dagongmei with very little bargaining power as they seem to be easily replaceable. The dormitory life in China leaves women with little to no home space independence from the factory. All of the women‚Äôs time spent traveling from home to work is eliminated and working days are extended to suit production needs. Sick days and personal health are of little concern in these dormitory settings. Women will often neglect their own health out of fear of retribution from factory supervisors. Furthermore, as shown in the documentary \\"China Blue\\" if a woman becomes pregnant while working she will be either fired or forced to quit shortly after her baby is born because she will not be able to meet her work responsibilities. In 2009 alone, over 20,000 Chinese dorm workers became ill while living in these dorms, the majority being young women. While living in dormitories, women migrant workers' time is not their own. As they become assimilated into the factory life they are almost completely controlled by the paternalistic systems of these factory owners and managers. Hygiene and communicable diseases become a threat to health as women live in rooms of 8-20 people sharing washrooms between rooms and floors of the dormitories. The only private space allotted is behind the curtain that covers an individual‚Äôs bunk. Male and female workers are separated and there are strict controls placed on the sexual activity of both. These conditions pose a great threat to not only the physical but also the mental health of these women workers being away from their home and placed in a highly restrictive environment. While those changes did allow China to achieve unprecedented economic growth, the privatization of many industries also forced China to reform its healthcare policies. Wage discrimination reduces access to healthcare Another factor that limits women‚Äôs capabilities to access healthcare is their relative low wage compared to men. China promotes itself as having almost no gender bias when it comes to wages yet we see that compared to men women are making less money. The Chinese government touts their ‚Äúequal pay for equal work‚Äù mantra, however, women find that their work in the textile industries is not equal to the work done in industries requiring ‚Äúheavy‚Äù labor so in the end women make less than men because they are perceived as not being able to do the ‚Äúheavy‚Äù work. This inequitable pay leaves women more vulnerable and with less capability to pay for their individual healthcare when compared to men. While 49.6% of women are uninsured demonstrating that there is not much disparity between uninsured men and women. The lack of insurance does not affect men and women equally as women needs tend to be greater in order to provide care for child birth, family care, and security. Social security coverage has also been a factor as only 37.9% of those receiving social security are women; again this becomes an issue as elderly women are unable to pay for their growing health costs. As the cost of healthcare increases due to deregulation of trade and privatization, research has shown that the conditions mentioned above have greatly reduced women‚Äôs capability to access healthcare in China. =WTO membership (2001-present)= While China‚Äôs entry to WTO was presumed to further motivate its economic development and improve its market structure, it has also been worried that joining WTO will worsen China‚Äôs labor surplus because over-hired labor in state enterprises may be deemed ‚Äúinefficient‚Äù once China entered global market. Moreover, studies have shown that the workforce in China was made of only 40% women but 60% of those laid off were women, which demonstrated that women are much more vulnerable to these effects than man. Statistics obtained in 2008 have shown that males enjoy higher physical well-being than females. However, it is not addressed if the situation could be related to China's changing economy in any ways. Healthcare policies Health systems in China have changed considerably during the transition to a market economy. As the transformation evolved, China‚Äôs new decentralized government divided responsibility for urban health services between the ministries of Health and Labor and Social Security. As the industrial markets were liberalizing so too were the health systems, which left many Chinese citizens uninsured having to pay for their care out of pocket with cash. Under China‚Äôs new trade policies brought on by membership to the WTO, China‚Äôs open market was exposed to foreign competition. This led to the import of better drugs and more expensive medical equipment, which in turn gave way to higher cost of care. This priced out many Chinese who were in dire need of medical attention. Between the late 1970s and the late 1990s, the Chinese government transfers for health expenditure fell by 50% and are continuing to fall. The Chinese were spending more on healthcare but the share the state was spending went down from 36.4% of the total health expenditures in 1980 to 15.3 percent in 2003; conversely, individuals' contributions increased from 23.2% to 60.2% during the same time period. As stated above, women make less on average than men in China thus leaving women particularly vulnerable to the rising costs of healthcare. One elderly women interviewed by Liu stated that she knew many older women who when confronted with the prospect of an expensive medical procedure opted to commit suicide rather than burden their families with the cost. In addition to bearing gender disadvantage, rural women suffer even more from insufficient healthcare due to increasing spatial disparity in China. Based on studies by Xiaobo Zhang et al., healthcare facilities have been significantly scarcer in rural areas. In 1980, hospital beds and healthcare personnel per 1000 people in cities were 4.57 and 7.82, respectively, compared to 1.48 and 1.81 in rural areas. Such disparity has grown over years. Moreover, infant mortality rate in rural areas has been significantly higher than in cities, with the gap reaching 2.1 in 2000. The ratio of female to male IMR increased dramatically from 0.9 to 1.3 over the same period. More seriously, female IMR in rural areas rose from 34.9 to 36.7 in the period of 1990‚Äì2000, as families in rural areas often have a stronger boy preference. Women's health outcomes =Reproductive health= Prenatal health One of the aspects of women‚Äôs health to suffer the most as the economy shifts to a free market system is reproductive health. As health firm privatize those firms are less likely to provide free preventative health, and as a result they have discontinued the practice of providing regular reproductive health examinations. Due to this from 1997 to 2007 only 38 or 39 percent of women are getting the reproductive examinations that they need. There is also a widening gap between urban and rural women with regards to their respective health indicators. Health indicators show that in 2003 96.4% of urban women vs. 85.6% of rural women visited a doctor during their pregnancy. In urban areas children under 5 had a mortality rate of 14 per 1,000 again vs. 39 per 1,000 so children born in rural China were twice as likely to die before the age of 5. There are also more traditional gender values that reduce women‚Äôs access to healthcare. In one study it was shown that the majority of women still are reluctant to seek out medical help for issues concerning their gynecological needs. The unwillingness to get regular vaginal and breast examinations has led to severe vaginal infections and late detection of breast cancer. Women resist getting these vaginal exams because if they are found to have an infection their identity as a woman is called into question as her role of care giver is reversed and is labeled as a care receiver. When infections were found it was reported that women often didn't even think they were suffering from an illness, and it is speculated that they perceived these infections as part of the female condition. These attitudes are common and spread due to poor healthcare systems and health information. Postnatal health The tradition of ‚Äúdoing the month‚Äù has significant influence on women‚Äôs postnatal health in China. Denoted as ‚Äúpostpartum confinement‚Äù in western scholarship, it is a series of everyday practices from special diet to restrictive activities meant to help postnatal women to recover from the trauma of birth. It is believed that such practices can help women restore their ‚Äúharmonious equilibrium‚Äù in body and therefore prevent certain diseases later in their lives. However, it is highly debated among researchers whether the tradition is helpful or dysfunctional. Shu-Shya Heh et al. have found that ‚Äúdoing the month‚Äù makes women less likely to develop postnatal depression, because they perceive high social support from their family. Other studies have also shown that certain elements of the custom jeopardize postnatal women‚Äôs health, such as lack of exposure to sunshine or imbalance of nutrition. =HIV/AIDS= HIV in China has been on the rise as well rising from 15.3% in 1998 to 32.3% in 2004. This sharp rise is due to the lack of recognition and education, as for years in HIV was considered a western disease that would not affect the Chinese population and because of this rhetoric China found itself ill- equipped to deal with the social and health issues relating to HIV. There was some attempt at safe sex education and access to condoms for sex workers in the 90s but these were largely token gestures and had no real effect. At one point the Chinese government in some provinces went as far as to outlaw AIDS victims from marrying, or serving as teachers and doctors. This uninformed perception of AIDS victims was particularly damaging to women and homosexuals as they were perceived as the carriers of this disease. A recent sign that catches increasing attention is the rise in new infections among women compared to men. Recent estimates by the Chinese Ministry of Health and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS shows that the ratio of reported infections went from 5 men to 1 woman during 1995‚Äì1997 to 4 men to 1 woman by 2001. During 1999‚Äì2008, the proportion of women infected with HIV doubled compared to the previous decade. During 1999‚Äì2008, the proportion of women infected with HIV doubled compared to the previous decade. Analysis by Population Reference Bureau attributes such rise primarily to three aspects: physical vulnerabilities of women, soaring sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates in China, and women‚Äôs social vulnerability in China. Durin99-2008, the proportion of women infected with HIV doubled compared to the previous decade. Specifically, unprotected sex exposes women to a risk of HIV infection of 2-4 times higher than for men due to the biological structure of women‚Äôs vagina. Also, STI rates, as a marker of infection rate of HIV/AIDS, are also on the rise in China for the past few decades, and young women in migration or commercial sex industry are particularly vulnerable to STI. =Eating disorders= Studies have shown a high level of body dissatisfaction among young women across China. Like other parts of the world, reported eating disorder symptoms are also significantly higher for females than males. Among various predictors, perceptions of social pressure and teasing play a significant role in impacting young women's weight-related concerns. Sing Lee et al. have found that women‚Äôs concern with body fat is more severe in developed areas such as Hong Kong. Some interpret prevalent eating disorders among women as a side effect of the societal modernization in China. =Suicide= China accounts for 30% of the world‚Äôs suicide and it is the only country where women have a higher suicidal rate than men. According to Pin Qing‚Äôs study, approximately 56% of women who committed suicide worldwide were Chinese. Some explanations state that prevailing gender discrimination in China is a main cause of high female suicide. Many traditional concepts of Chinese society, such as an emphasis on women‚Äôs domestic and reproductive role, all put women at a vulnerable position. In August 2017, the 26-year-old pregnant woman, surnamed Ma, jumped from a hospital window, after she was not allowed to receive C-section by her husband‚Äôs family. The family declined Ma‚Äôs request to receive C-section because they believe the procedure would make it harder for her to give birth to a second child. The incident has stirred hot debate about women‚Äôs status within households and ongoing propaganda on two- child policy. In recent years, however, female suicidal rate in China has decreased significantly, from 26.1 per 100,000 to 15.7 per 100,000 in 2000. The female to male suicide rate decreased from 1.2 to 0.96 in urban areas. Paul S. F. Yip attributes such progress to rapid modernization during the 1990-2000 decade, which involves great improvement in the standard of living, education, etc. It is also important to note that the rural suicidal rate is three-fold the urban rate in China, and the decrease in female suicide rate is much less significant in rural areas. Liu Meng‚Äôs field studies in rural China indicated that women sometimes use suicide as a means of rebellion in their private space, a way to achieve the influence and power that were unattainable in their lifetime. Such is related to the more extreme forms of patriarchal oppression in rural areas. =Intimate Partner Violence= According to studies by William Parish et al. in 2004, 19% of female respondents in China reported experience of intimate partner violence while 3% of their male counterparts reported such. The study showed that duration of the relationship and low socioeconomic status both have a positive correlation with the occurrence of male-on-female violence, and respondents from inland or Northern China are also more frequently found to experience such violence. Experience of intimate partner violence was found to exert serious adverse impact on women‚Äôs physical and mental health. Multi-country studies by Henrica A F M indicated that 19-55% women who experienced intimate partner violence were actually injured by their partner and they are exposed to significantly higher risk of mental illness such as emotional distress.

Drover was educated in Hodge's Cove and at Memorial University. He taught school from 1929 until 1938, when he joined the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary. Drover tried to enlist in the Royal Air Force in 1942 but was not accepted. He then joined the Newfoundland Ranger Force, serving until 1949. He was originally elected as a Liberal member of the House of Assembly in the 1949 election, which was the first after the dominion of Newfoundland joined the Canadian confederation as a province. He was re- elected in 1951. Drover became disenchanted with Premier Joey Smallwood's government because he believed that it ignored the problems of rural poverty. He crossed the floor to the CCF in 1955, becoming the first CCF member in Newfoundland. He helped form the new party and became its leader. The CCF fielded ten candidates in the 1956 election. The party won no seats, however, and he lost his own seat in the riding now known as Trinity North. It would take three decades before the CCF's successor, the New Democratic Party, was able to win a seat in the legislature. Following his defeat, Drover started his own business in Hodge's Cove. Drover ran in the 1965 federal election as an \\"independent Liberal\\" in Trinity‚ÄîConception and in the 1972 election as an independent candidate in Bonavista‚ÄîTrinity‚ÄîConception.

Early and private life A Dubliner and Irish language speaker, he attended school at Scoil Lorc√°in and Col√°iste Eoin, before studying at University College Dublin (UCD). √ì Snodaigh joined Sinn F√©in while at university, where he was active in student politics, in 1983. He completed a Bachelor of Arts in History and Geography, and a Higher Diploma in Education. Having secured his teaching qualifications, he went on to teach at secondary level and as a literacy teacher in Dublin's inner city. He is also the editor of Feals√∫nacht, Feall agus Fuil which is a collection of historical essays concentrating on the 1798 Rebellion and several pamphlets on aspects of Irish republican history. He is a member of the board of the Ireland Institute, aimed at promoting discussion on Irish republicanism, culture and heritage which restored the Pearse brothers birthplace and original family home at 27 Pearse Street, Dublin, and joint editor of the Institute's journal, The Republic. √ì Snodaigh is the brother of the three √ì Snodaigh brothers in the band K√≠la and is the son of the writer and publisher P√°draig √ì Snodaigh and the sculptor Clio·∏ãna Cussen from Newcastlewest, County Limerick. He is married to Aisling N√≠ Dh√°laigh; they live in Bluebell with their three children. He also worked as a journalist, book reviewer and proofreader for An Phoblacht newspaper. In one incident a book-bomb was sent to the office by Ulster loyalist paramilitaries and he carried the device outside the building, where it exploded a short time later, injuring two soldiers. Political career He was first elected to D√°il √âireann at the 2002 general election, having contested a D√°il election in 1987 in Dublin South-East first and a by-election in the Dublin South-Central constituency in 1999. Seven of √ì Snodaigh's election workers were jailed for IRA membership in 2004. This included two men arrested in connection with an espionage ring at Leinster House, who worked in √ì Snodaigh's office. √ì Snodaigh criticised the non-jury anti-terror court that they were tried in. He is currently the Sinn F√©in party whip in the D√°il and is the party Spokesperson on Social Protection. He was previously the Sinn F√©in representative on the National Forum on Europe and the party's spokesperson on the Treaty of Nice. He was a member of the D√°il Committee on Procedures and Privileges and the Committee on European Affairs in the 29th D√°il. He was re- elected at the 2007 general election. He has been a member of the Sinn F√©in national executive, the Ard Chomhairle, for many years, has been on the Dublin executive of the party since 1985, and was part of the party's negotiations team during the Northern Ireland peace process. =Support for Palestine and Nazi propaganda comments= √ì Snodaigh is a well known supporter of the Palestinian cause and has in the past been highly critical of the actions of Israel. During the 2009 Gaza‚ÄìIsrael conflict √ì Snodaigh claimed that Alan Shatter, a Fine Gael TD, and the Israeli ambassador to Ireland had exposed the Oireachtas committee on Foreign Affairs to \\"propaganda, twisted logic and half truths\\". He also said that Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister, would have been proud of it. Israeli ambassador to Ireland, Dr Zion Evrony, labelled √ì Snodaigh's comments as \\"outrageous\\" and asked for an apology, which √ì Snodaigh refused. Shatter, the only Jewish member of the D√°il, said he was appalled by √ì Snodaigh's mindset that he would liken a Jewish politician to a Nazi minister. Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny demanded a retraction and described √ì Snodaigh's attack on Shatter as \\"despicable and outrageous\\". European Affairs Minister Dick Roche, a Fianna F√°il TD, said √ì Snodaigh's statement was \\"sickening and calculated to offend\\" and \\"the fact that √ì Snodaigh made his remarks in the period immediately before the National Holocaust Memorial Day makes his actions doubly reprehensible.\\" On 30 May 2010, he was one of three Irish politicians who were prevented from leaving Cyprus by authorities to join an international flotilla carrying aid to the blockaded Gaza Strip.

He served as the head football coach at East Carolina University (1974‚Äì1979), the University of Wyoming (1980), and Auburn University (1981‚Äì1992) compiling a career college football record of 153‚Äì62‚Äì5. He served as the Athletic Director at Auburn from 1981 to 1991 and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 2005. On November 19, 2005 the playing field in the stadium at Auburn University was named 'Pat Dye Field' in his honor. Playing career Pat Dye played high school football at Richmond Academy in Augusta, Georgia, from 1954-1956 where he was selected All-American and All-State while leading the team to the 1956 3A state championship, serving as team captain. He placed 2nd in the state tournament in shot-put and javelin, on the State Championship Track Team. Following this success, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution selected Dye as Georgia's 3A Lineman of the Year for 1956 before being recruited to the University of Georgia where he followed his older brothers, Wayne and Nat. While playing for the Bulldogs from 1957-1960, under head coach Wally Butts, Dye was a first-team All-SEC lineman and two-time All-American (1959 and 1960). He was a two-way starter at offensive guard and linebacker, SEC Lineman of the Year in 1960, team Co-Captain in 1960, won the William K. Jenkins Award for the Most Valuable Lineman (1959,1960), and the JB Whitworth Award for the Outstanding Georgia Lineman 1960. He helped lead the team to the SEC Championship and the Orange Bowl in 1959, undefeated as a player against Georgia Tech. He played in 3 All-Star games: the Blue Gray Classic, Senior Bowl, and Coaches All-American Game in 1960. The Atlanta Touchdown Club named him the SEC's Most Valuable Lineman in 1960 where he served as co-captain with friend and NFL Hall of Famer Fran Tarkenton. Upon graduation from Georgia, Dye played three years of professional football as a two-way starter at tight end and linebacker for the Edmonton Eskimos in the Canadian Football League. He then served from 1963-1964 in the US Army to fulfill an ROTC obligation where he played for the Ft. Benning 'Doughboys'. While playing there he received the Timmy Award for Armed Services Most Valuable Player in 1964. Coaching career =Alabama= Dye's first coaching job came as an assistant head coach at the University of Alabama in 1965, under Bear Bryant. Dye served as a defensive assistant at Alabama through the 1973 season. =East Carolina= Dye moved into his first head coaching job at East Carolina University in 1974. Over six seasons, he achieved a record of 48‚Äì18‚Äì1. He guided the Pirates to the Southern Conference championship in 1976 and posted at least seven wins in all six seasons in Greenville. In 2006, Dye was inducted into the East Carolina Athletics Hall of Fame. As of 2006, his 72.4% win rate is the second highest of any coach in East Carolina University history. =Wyoming= In 1980, Dye took over for one season as head coach at the University of Wyoming. In the decade prior to his arrival, the Cowboys had had only one winning season (winning 35% of their games). In Dye's first year, he changed the culture into a winning program going 6‚Äì5 and paving the way for future success under coaches Al Kincaid (Dye's offensive coordinator) and Dennis Erickson. In an interview many years later, Dye revealed that the athletic administration at Wyoming failed to have him sign his contract when they hired him. Consequently, when Auburn hired Dye to be their new head coach, Wyoming had no recourse to demand compensation for Auburn hiring him away. =Auburn= During Dye's interview for the head coaching job at Auburn, he was asked by a member of the search committee, \\"How long will it take you to beat Alabama?\\" Dye's reply was \\"60 minutes.\\" At Auburn, Dye achieved a record of 99‚Äì39‚Äì4 (71.1% win rate) over 12 seasons. His 99 wins are behind only Mike Donahue and Ralph Jordan for the most in school history. Under Dye's leadership, the Tigers won four Southeastern Conference championships (1983, 1987, 1988, 1989) and Dye became the fourth coach in SEC history to win three straight (1987, 1988, 1989). He received SEC Coach of the Year honors in 1983, 1987 and 1988. Dye was also Auburn's Athletic Director from 1981 to 1991, a perk Ralph \\"Shug\\" Jordan did not enjoy during his 25-year tenure (1951‚Äì75), which saw the stadium named in his honor. Dye coached 1985 Heisman Trophy winner Bo Jackson, as well as Tracy Rocker, winner of both the Outland Trophy and the Lombardi Award in 1988. The 1983 team, led by quarterback Randy Campbell and a stifling defense, is generally considered Dye's best. They bounced back from an early season loss to Texas to win 10 consecutive games, including five over bowl teams. Auburn was ranked #1 in the nation by the New York Times at the end of the 1983 season but ended up #3 in the AP and UPI polls, behind Miami and Nebraska. Auburn Database, nationalchamps.nets; accessed June 18, 2015. Dye's tenure on the Plains ended due to an NCAA investigation involving a member of the team. The NCAA found that Dye was not personally responsible for rules violations, but that he should have known about and prevented them. The fallout from the investigation eventually led Dye to step down as Athletic Director in 1991, and as head coach the following year. On November 19, 2005, the playing surface at Jordan‚ÄìHare Stadium at Auburn was named Pat Dye Field in the former coach's honor. The dedication ceremony was held immediately before the Iron Bowl, which Auburn went on to win 28‚Äì18. This was especially appropriate since Dye led the Tigers to a 30‚Äì20 victory over the Tide on December 2, 1989, in the first installment of the Iron Bowl, to be played at Auburn after 41 consecutive meetings at Legion Field in Birmingham. The permanent move of Auburn's home games against Alabama to Jordan‚ÄìHare Stadium is considered one of Dye's most important achievements as AU's Athletic Director. Dye's tenure was also notable for the November 27, 1982 victory over arch-rival Alabama, when Dye's team defeated Alabama 23‚Äì22 in Bryant's last regular-season game. That game snapped a 9-game Tide winning streak and reignited the rivalry again. Writing Dye's autobiography, In The Arena, written with John Logue, was published in 1992. In September 2006, Dye partnered with publisher Mascot Books to release his first children's book, War Eagle!. Dye's third book, After The Arena, published in 2013, details his life after leaving coaching in 1992. Life after coaching During the latter part of his life, Dye spent most of his time on his farm in Notasulga, Alabama, where he was involved in the day-to-day activities of his two businesses: Crooked Oaks Hunting Preserve and Quail Hollow Gardens Japanese Maple Farm & Nursery. Many activities on his farm are made available to the public, including Horse Boarding and trail rides, Quail Hunts, and Garden Tours. Dye's family includes 4 children and 9 grandchildren. In 2005, Pat Dye was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. In 2014, he was inducted into the Georgia-Florida Hall of Fame. From 2013 until 2020, Dye hosted \\"The Coach Pat Dye Show\\" with co-host Tim Ellen and producer Lynn Huggins. The show was a weekly sports interview and opinion program that aired on radio stations around the southeast, online and on tune-in radio. Death On May 21, 2020, Dye was hospitalized in Atlanta for kidney-related problems. He was later diagnosed with COVID-19. He died at a hospice care facility in Auburn on June 1, 2020.

The picture was taken in 1946, one year after the war ended. The ''''', literally translated from German as \\"'Schindler Jews\\", were a group of roughly 1,200 Jews who were saved by Oskar Schindler during the Holocaust. They survived the years of the Nazi regime primarily through the intervention of Schindler, who found them protected status as industrial workers at his enamelware factory in Krak√≥w and, after 1944, in an armaments factory in occupied Czechoslovakia. There, they avoided being sent to death camps and survived the war. Schindler expended his personal fortune as an industrialist to save the Schindlerjuden. Their story has been depicted in the book Schindler's Ark, by Thomas Keneally, and Steven Spielberg's film adaptation of the novel, Schindler's List. Poldek Pfefferberg, one of the survivors, persuaded Thomas Keneally to write the novel and Steven Spielberg to produce the film. In 2012, there were estimated to be over 8,500 descendants of ' living across the United States, Europe, and Israel. List The original list of ' who were transported to Schindler's Br√ºnnlitz factory in Brnƒõnec, occupied Czechoslovakia, was prepared by Mietek Pemper, Itzhak Stern and Oskar Schindler during September and October 1944. That list likely no longer exists. Another list with 1,000 names, compiled by Pemper upon the prisoners' arrival 21 October 1944 at Schindler's Br√ºnnlitz factory, was presented by him to the International Tracing Service in 1958.Sample Documents from the ITS Archives , International Tracing Service Two lists of 1,098 prisoners made by camp administration in Br√ºnnlitz on 18 April 1945 are extant, and are preserved in Yad Vashem Memorial, where Oskar and Emilie Schindler are recognized among the Righteous. The first list contains 297 female prisoners while the second list contains 801 male prisoners. There are several preserved copies and carbon copies of the list from April 1945, with some in museums while others are in private hands, mostly of families of former prisoners. In April 2009, a carbon copy of the original list, documenting 801 names, was discovered among the documentation Schindler's Ark author Thomas Keneally had donated to the State Library of New South Wales in Sydney.

It is named after Arthur Newbery, who donated the land in 1932. It is one of Reading's oldest parks and was once part of Kentwood Common. Hollows in the park are remains of chalk and clay pits. The park slopes down to the north giving views to the River Thames and across its valley. It is mainly grass, with scattered trees, although there are small wooded areas and a play area. What is now the play area was once a pool, the pool become less popular, then neglected c. 1994. The park is of 26 acres and was once owned by Arthur Newbery, who owned and ran a high class furniture shop located at the junction of Friar Street and Queen Victoria Street in Reading town centre in trade for over forty years. On 14 September 1932, Newbery gifted the park to the mayor of Reading as an open space for the people of Reading. The great and the good were gathered on the late summer afternoon, this being a Wednesday, as it was convenient for the half day closing thus allowing members of the Council who were shopkeepers and the like to attend. Following a small lunch held at Tilehurst Congregational Church at Polsted Road the party, numbering about thirty local dignitaries, walked through the park to the hill overlooking the Thames. Here Newbery made a short speech. Newbery cited the encroaching housing development in the area as his reason for the bequest. A photograph of the occasion appeared in the Reading Chronicle on 17 September, a copy of which is held at Reading Library. The Park was originally known as Hare Moor. The park had two public air raid shelters during World War II but these have since been filled in. Newbery died in 1961 at the age of 98. Rabbits can still be seen on the odd occasion running wild in the avenue of trees at the bottom bordering Oak Tree Road where Lucas Farm once stood.

Although it only ever reached the prototype stage and only a single example was built, it influenced many other tank designs. The A1E1 design can be seen as a possible influence on the Soviet T-100 and T-28 tanks, the German Neubaufahrzeug tanks, and the British Medium Mk III and Cruiser Mk I (triple turret) tank designs. The Soviet T-35 tank was heavily influenced by its design. Design The Independent was a multi-turret design, having a central gun turret armed with the 3 pounder (47 mm) gun, and four subsidiary turrets each armed with a 0.303 inch Vickers machine gun. The subsidiary turrets were mounted two at the front and two to the rear of the turret (about halfway along the hull). The gun of the left rear turret was able to elevate to engage aircraft. The tank was designed to have heavy firepower, self-defence capability, and superiority to enemy weapons. It had a crew of eight men, the commander communicating with the crew through an intercom system. The Independent was never used in combat, but other armies studied it and a few adopted designs derived from it. History The A1E1 at The Tank Museum (2008) In 1924 the General Staff of the British Army ordered the prototype of a heavy tank, which became known as the Independent. Largely designed by Walter Gordon Wilson, its V12 air-cooled engine was designed by Armstrong Siddeley. It also incorporated a new hydraulic braking system which had to be specially developed due to its weight and speed. The prototype was delivered to the War Office in 1926, and displayed to the premiers of the Dominions that year. The tank was the subject of industrial and political espionage, the plans ending up in the Soviet Union, where they may have influenced the design of the T-28 and T-35 tanks. Norman Baillie-Stewart, a British military officer, was court-martialled in 1933 and served five years in prison for providing the plans of the Independent (among other secrets) to a German contact. It remained in use for experiments until 1935 when it was worn out and retired to Bovington Tank Museum, where it is preserved.Fletcher (2014) References =Bibliography=  * External links * A1E1 Vickers Independent * Category:Interwar tanks of the United Kingdom Category:Heavy tanks of the United Kingdom Category:Multi-turreted tanks Category:Vickers Category:Abandoned military projects of the United Kingdom Category:History of the tank Category:Trial and research tanks of the United Kingdom ","title":"Vickers A1E1 Independent"},{"id":"1906068","text":"23am is the second studio album by composer Robert Miles, released in late 1997 via Deconstruction and Arista labels.

Miles has also said that the album reflects the human life cycle from birth to death. 23am also contains four vocal songs, a ratio of vocals to instrumentals that is almost equal to that of Dreamland. They seem to have been less an afterthought for this album, though, and were written in Italian and then translated into English. Two tracks on the album, including its first single \\"Freedom\\", feature vocals by disco icon Kathy Sledge of the chart- topping group Sister Sledge. The structures and instrumental arrangements on 23am are more complex than those on the earlier Dreamland, involving real instruments such as the saxophone and trumpet as an addition to the synthesizers. The music is also much less beat-driven; the main sections of a number of the vocal-based songs are structured like pop songs, while the segueing interludes between songs are generally structureless, with no beats at all. Ultimately it can be said that 23am is more artistic and less dance- oriented than its predecessor, Dreamland. At the same time, however, 23am was less successful than Dreamland.

Use The main application of sodium chlorite is the generation of chlorine dioxide for bleaching and stripping of textiles, pulp, and paper. It is also used for disinfection of municipal water treatment plants after conversion to chlorine dioxide. An advantage in this application, as compared to the more commonly used chlorine, is that trihalomethanes (such as chloroform) are not produced from organic contaminants. Chlorine dioxide generated from sodium chlorite is approved by FDA under some conditions for disinfecting water used to wash fruits, vegetables, and poultry. Sodium chlorite, NaClO2, sometimes in combination with zinc chloride, also finds application as a component in therapeutic rinses, mouthwashes, toothpastes and gels, mouth sprays, as preservative in eye drops,Blink Tears and in contact lens cleaning solution under the trade name Purite. It is also used for sanitizing air ducts and HVAC/R systems and animal containment areas (walls, floors, and other surfaces). =Chemical reagent= In organic synthesis, sodium chlorite is frequently used as a reagent in the Pinnick oxidation for the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids. The reaction is usually performed in monosodium phosphate buffered solution in the presence of a chlorine scavenger (usually 2-methyl-2-butene). In 2005, sodium chlorite was used as an oxidizing agent to convert alkyl furans to the corresponding 4-oxo-2-alkenoic acids in a simple one pot synthesis. =Acidified sodium chlorite= Mixing sodium chlorite solution with a weak food-grade acid solution (commonly citric acid), both stable, produces short-lived acidified sodium chlorite (ASC) which has potent decontaminating properties. Upon mixing the main active ingredient, chlorous acid is produced in equilibrium with chlorite anion. The proportion varies with pH, temperature, and other factors, ranging from approximately 5‚Äì35% chlorous acid with 65‚Äì95% chlorite; more acidic solutions result in a higher proportion of chlorous acid. Chlorous acid breaks down to chlorine dioxide which in turn breaks down to chlorite anion and ultimately chloride anion. ASC is used for sanitation of the hard surfaces which come in contact with food and as a wash or rinse for a variety of foods including red meat, poultry, seafood, fruits and vegetables. Because the oxo- chlorine compounds are unstable when properly prepared, there should be no measurable residue on food if treated appropriately. ASC also is used as a teat dip for control of mastitis in dairy cattle. =Use in public crises = The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center produced a portable \\"no power required\\" method of generating chlorine dioxide, known as ClO2, gas, described as one of the best biocides available for combating contaminants, which range from benign microbes and food pathogens to Category A Bioterror agents. In the weeks after the 9/11 attacks when anthrax was sent in letters to public officials, hazardous materials teams used ClO2 to decontaminate the Hart Senate Office Building, and the Brentwood Postal Facility.Natick plays key role in helping to fight spread of Ebola Retrieved: 23/01/2016 In addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has posted a list of many disinfectants that meet its criteria for use in environmental measures against the causative coronavirus. Some are based on sodium chlorite that is activated into chlorine dioxide, though differing formulations are used in each product. Many other products on the EPA list contain sodium hypochlorite, which is similar in name but should not be confused with sodium chlorite because they have very different modes of chemical action. Safety Sodium chlorite, like many oxidizing agents, should be protected from inadvertent contamination by organic materials to avoid the formation of an explosive mixture. The chemical is stable in pure form and does not explode on percussive impact, unless organic contaminants are present, such as on a greasy hammer striking the chemical on an anvil. It also easily ignites by friction if combined with a reducing agent like powdered sugar, sulfur or red phosphorus. Toxicity Sodium chlorite is a strong oxidant and can therefore be expected to cause clinical symptoms similar to the well known sodium chlorate: methemoglobinemia, hemolysis, kidney failure.Goldfrank's Toxicologic Emergencies, McGraw-Hill Professional; 8th edition (March 28, 2006), A dose of 10-15 grams of sodium chlorate can be lethal. Methemoglobemia had been demonstrated in rats and cats,Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products. Robert E. Gosselin, Roger P. Smith, Harold C. Hodge, Jeannet Braddock. Uitgever: Williams & Wilkins; 5 edition (September 1984) and recent studies by the EMEA have confirmed that the clinical symptomatology is very similar to the one caused by sodium chlorate in rats, mice, rabbits, and green monkeys. There is only one human case in the medical literature of chlorite poisoning. It seems to confirm that the toxicity is equal to sodium chlorate. From the analogy with sodium chlorate, even small amounts of about 1 gram can be expected to cause nausea, vomiting and even life-threatening hemolysis in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient persons. The EPA has set a maximum contaminant level of 1 milligram of chlorite per liter (1 mg/L) in drinking water. Sellers of ‚ÄúMiracle Mineral Solution‚Äù, a mixture of sodium chlorite and citric acid also known as \\"MMS\\" that is promoted as a cure-all have been convicted, fined, or otherwise disciplined in multiple jurisdictions around the world. MMS products were variously referred to as snake oil and complete quackery. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued multiple warnings against consuming MMS. Manufacture The free acid, chlorous acid, HClO2, is only stable at low concentrations. Since it cannot be concentrated, it is not a commercial product. However, the corresponding sodium salt, sodium chlorite, NaClO2 is stable and inexpensive enough to be commercially available. The corresponding salts of heavy metals (Ag+, Hg+, Tl+, Pb2+, and also Cu2+ and NH4+) decompose explosively with heat or shock. Sodium chlorite is derived indirectly from sodium chlorate, NaClO3. First, sodium chlorate is reduced to chlorine dioxide, typically in a strong acid solution using reducing agents such as sodium sulfite, sulfur dioxide, or hydrochloric acid. This intermediate is then absorbed into a solution of aqueous sodium hydroxide where another reducing agent converts it to sodium chlorite. Even hydrogen peroxide can be used as the reducing agent, giving oxygen gas as its byproduct rather than other inorganic salts or materials that could contaminate the desired product.

As the title indicates, they are intended not only for the acquisition of a better technique, but also for concert performance. Liszt was himself a virtuoso pianist and was able to easily play many complex patterns generally considered difficult. The Italian subtitles now associated with the √©tudes‚ÄîIl lamento (\\"The Lament\\"), La leggierezza (\\"Lightness\\"), and Un sospiro (\\"A sigh\\")‚Äîwere not in early editions.Not in the first edition, nor in Busoni's edition of 1911. √âtude No. 1, Il lamento Il lamento is the first of the √©tudes. Written in A-flat major, it is among Liszt's longest pieces in the genre. It starts with a four-note lyrical melody which folds itself through the work, followed by a Chopin-like chromatic pattern which reappears again in the coda. Although the piece opens and ends in A-flat major, it shifts throughout its three parts to many other keys, A, G, D-sharp, F-sharp and B among them. √âtude No. 2, La leggierezza La leggierezza (meaning \\"lightness\\") is the second √©tude. It is a monothematic piece in F minor with a very simple melodic line for each hand under an unusual Quasi allegretto tempo marking, usually ignored in favour of something slightly more frenetic. It starts with a fast but delicate sixteen chromatic-note arpeggio divided in thirds and sixths under an irregular rhythmic subdivision and cadenza so as to underline the atmosphere implied in its title. The technical difficulties involved in playing the piece include rapid leggiero chromatic runs, often with irregular rhythmic groupings, and passages in sixths and thirds. An ossia for the right hand involving brilliant runs in minor thirds is almost universally preferred by performers. =Alternate endings= La leggierezza often included an alternate ending written by Polish teacher Theodor Leschetizky. Two of his students, Ignacy Jan Paderewski and Benno Moiseiwitsch, performed and recorded this variation. The Paderewski recording includes the full \\"Leschetizky ending,\\" while the recording by Moiseiwitsch includes his own abbreviated version of the Leschetizky ending. Simon Barere recorded the piece with an abbreviated version of the Leschetizky coda with critical results in the press. √âtude No. 3, Un sospiro The third of the Three Concert √âtudes is in D-flat major, and is usually known as Un sospiro (Italian for \\"A sigh\\"). However, it is likely that the title did not originate with Liszt. Although there is no evidence that he actively attempted to remove the subtitle, none of the editions or subsequent printings of the Three Concert √âtudes published by Kistner during Liszt's lifetime used them; he simply ignored such subtitles in later years, always referring to the piece by key. The √©tude is a study in crossing hands, playing a simple melody with alternating hands, and arpeggios. It is also a study in the way hands should affect the melody with its many accentuations, or phrasing with alternating hands. The melody is quite dramatic, almost Impressionistic, radically changing in dynamics at times, and has inspired many listeners. The √©tude has been considered by many pianists as one of the most beautiful piano pieces ever composed. Liszt kept the √©tude in his repertoire until his final years. Un sospiro consists of a flowing background superimposed by a simple melody written in the third staff. This third staff‚Äîan additional treble staff‚Äîis written with the direction to the performer that notes with the stem up are for the right hand and notes with the stem down are for the left hand. The background alternates between the left and right hands in such a way that for most of the piece, while the left hand is playing the harmony, the right hand is playing the melody, and vice versa, with the left hand crossing over the right as it continues the melody for a short while before regressing again. There are also small cadenza sections requiring delicate fingerwork throughout the middle section of the piece. Towards the end, after the main climax of the piece, both hands are needed to cross in an even more complex pattern. Since there are so many notes to be played rapidly and they are too far away from other clusters of notes that must be played as well, the hands are required to cross multiple times to reach dramatic notes near the end of the piece on the last page. This √©tude, along with the other Three concert √©tudes, was written in dedication to Liszt's uncle, Eduard Liszt (1817‚Äì1879), the youngest son of Liszt's grandfather and the stepbrother of his own father. Eduard handled Liszt's business affairs for more than thirty years until his death in 1879. =Recordings= Un Sospiro has been recorded by many well-known pianists including Van Cliburn, Jorge Bolet, Claudio Arrau, Marc-Andr√© Hamelin, Daniil Trifonov and Jan Lisiecki. = Use in film and television = The piece has appeared in a number of films and television series, including: *The Andr√© de Toth film The Other Love (1947), in which it is played by Barbara Stanwyck's character * The Paul Gordon film Concert Magic (1948) * As the recurring musical theme in the Max Oph√ºls film Letter from an Unknown Woman (1948) * As the main theme in the Liszt biopic Song Without End (1960) * The Scott Hicks film Shine (1996), based on the life of David Helfgott * The Jun Ichikawa film Zawa-zawa Shimo-Kitazawa (2000) * The 2009 TV show Kings (in the pilot episode, twice) * The 2011 film The Green Hornet, when the character Kato is playing the piano with Lenore on their first date * The 2016 TV show \\"Easy\\" (in Season One, Episode 5, \\"Art and Life\\") References External links Recording of Concert Etude No. 2 by Boris Giltburg in MP3 format (archived on the Wayback Machine) * Recording of Un sospiro by Peter Roper-Curzon * Recording of Un sospiro by Serg van Gennip * Filmography by year of Franz Liszt Category:1848 compositions Concert Etudes ","title":"Three Concert √âtudes"},{"id":"1906081","text":"covered part of the cave Melissani Cave The Lake Melissani under noonday sun Excavations from Melissani, made under Spyridon Marinatos. Today in the Archaeological Museum of Argostoli Melissani Cave () or Melissani Lake, also Melisani is a cave located on the island of Kefalonia, northwest of Sami, about Southeast of Agia Effimia, Northeast of Argostoli and Northwest of Poros. The Ionian Sea lies to the east with the Strait of Ithaca. Forests surround the cave and the mountain slope is to the west. Near the cave is the entry to the cave with parking lots and is passed almost in the middle of the main road linking Sami and Agia Efimia especially to the northern part of the island.

It features a lake surrounded with trees and forest, and is located east of the mountains of Evmorfia and Agia Dynati. Tourism is common. The lake's bottom is covered with stones. Plants grow at the opening of the cave. The color of the stone near the opening is stucco to honey-like brown. The cave was rediscovered in 1951 by Giannis Petrocheilos. Hydrogeology Melissani cave is a typical feature of karst environment in coastal carbonate aquifer. It forms a kind of cenote, as described in the Yucat√°n peninsula (Mexico). The vertical shaft gives access to the water table (where you can do a round trip on a small boat). This groundwater is brackish, mixing between fresh water recharge inland and sea water intruded in depth in the island. Huge karst conduits have been explored by speleo-divers. The bay of Sami has many cenotes, with impressive shafts, that have been inventoried in a GIS Database [see external links]. The brackish water flowing through the cenotes outflows along the sea shore, forming brackish coastal and submarine springs. The groundwater of Melissani cave outflows at the \\"Fridi\\" beach. This brackish water is part of a famous hydrogeological phenomena : seawater is sucked in the west part of the island of Kefalonia, near Argostoli, and expelled in the bay of Sami.Salt water encroachment in the low-altitude karst water horizons of the island of Kephallinia.

In 2017, she left CNN to join sister network HLN, based in Los Angeles. In October 2018, HLN announced that Costello (and the hosts of two other news programs) would be let go, with the final broadcast of her show taking place on October 26. Early life and education Costello is a graduate of Minerva High School, a public high school in Minerva, Ohio, and Kent State University where she earned a B.A. in journalism. After attending Kent State University, Costello worked at Akron, Ohio's WAKR-TV as an award- winning police and court reporter. Following that Costello was an Emmy-award- winning anchor/reporter for WSYX, the ABC affiliate, and WBNS 10-TV, the CBS affiliate in Columbus, Ohio. She also worked as the 6 and 11pm news anchor for WBAL-TV in Baltimore between 1992 and 1995. Career =CNN= Costello worked as an anchor at CNN Headline News (now called HLN) and was also the anchor of Good Morning Washington and an investigative reporter at WJLA-TV, the ABC affiliate in Washington, D.C., during the September 11 attacks. She previously worked out of the network's New York City bureau. She was part of CNN's Peabody-winning coverage of Hurricane Katrina and the 2008 presidential election, and also covered the Virginia Tech massacre, the inauguration of Barack Obama and the Casey Anthony trial. Costello has done in-depth reporting on bullying, coal ash, and women's issues. After a CNN viewer nominated her, Costello ran with the Olympic torch through the streets of Atlanta prior to the Atlanta Olympics. As a reporter and anchor, Costello has interviewed Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and George H. W. Bush. Previously, Costello anchored the CNN early morning program CNN Daybreak and also was news reader and correspondent on American Morning. She was the anchor of CNN Daybreak, then a New York-based correspondent, and subsequently a contributor to The Situation Room. Costello hosted the 9 am‚Äì11 am slot of CNN Newsroom, based out of CNN's New York news bureau. Costello elicited criticism when she referred to audio of Bristol Palin describing an assault on her to police as \\"quite possibly the best minute and a half of audio we've ever come across.\\" Paul Bedard called Costello's \\"rude and crude enjoyment\\" an easy slap by a prominent female media star on a young woman.Bedard, Paul.

On October 16, 2018 it was announced by HLN that Costello was to be laid off, along with Michaela Pereira and Ashleigh Banfield, as part of the network's decision to scale back their live news programming. The final broadcasts for their programs took place on Friday, October 26, 2018. Although both Ashleigh Banfield and Michaela Pereira stayed to host their shows until their last days, Costello did not appear on air after October 16, 2018 with CNN correspondent Dianne Gallagher hosting the final broadcast. Since then, Costello has taken a more active role at Loyola Marymount University where she serves as first lady. She is a professor in the newly established journalism major and now also hosts a podcast developed by the university. According to Costello herself, she had been wanting to start a new venture for a while, even back on her days at CNN.https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/i-hate- your-generation/id1522765792 Personal life A former resident of Atlanta, Georgia, Costello moved to the New York area after marrying Timothy Law Snyder in 2004. She and Snyder later moved to Baltimore, Maryland. In October 2015, Snyder was named president of Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. In January 2017, Costello cited her husband's relocation as a primary factor in her decision to leave CNN for HLN and move to Los Angeles. In April 2015, Costello wrote that she became a \\"lapsed Catholic\\" after losing her younger brother Jimmy to cancer when she was 25.

The sperm and ovum unite through fertilization. The human reproductive system includes the male reproductive system which functions to produce and deposit sperm; and the female reproductive system which functions to produce egg cells, and to protect and nourish the fetus until birth. Humans have a high level of sexual differentiation. In addition to differences in nearly every reproductive organ, there are numerous differences in typical secondary sex characteristics. Human reproduction usually involves internal fertilization by sexual intercourse. In this process, the male inserts his penis into the female's vagina and ejaculates semen, which contains sperm. A small proportion of the sperm pass through the cervix into the uterus, and then into the Fallopian tubes for fertilization of the ovum. Only one sperm is required to fertilize the ovum. Upon successful fertilization, the fertilized ovum, or zygote, travels out of the fallopian tube and into the uterus, where it implants in the uterine wall. This marks the beginning of gestation, better known as pregnancy, which continues for around nine months as the fetus develops. When the fetus has developed to a certain point, pregnancy is concluded with childbirth, involving labor. During labor, the muscles of the uterus contract and the cervix dilates over the course of hours, and the baby passes out of the vagina. Human infants are completely dependent on their caregivers, and require high levels of parental care. Infants rely on their caregivers for comfort, cleanliness, and food. Food may be provided by breastfeeding or formula feeding.Sexual Reproduction in Humans. 2006. John W. Kimball. Kimball's Biology Pages, and online textbook. Structure =Male= Male reproductive systemThe male reproductive system is a series of organs located outside the body and around the pelvis region of a male that contribute towards the reproduction process. The primary direct function of the male reproductive system is to provide the male sperm for fertilization of the ovum. Penile shrinkage due to low temperatures. The scrotum is in a tense state to regulate testicular temperatures.The major reproductive organs of the male can be grouped into three categories. The first category produces and stores sperm (spermatozoa). These are produced in the testes, which are housed in the temperature-regulating scrotum; immature sperm then travel to the epididymis for development and storage. The second category are the ejaculatory fluid producing glands which include the Cowper's gland (also called bulbo-urethral gland), seminal vesicles, prostate, and vas deferens. The final category are those used for copulation and deposition of the sperm within the female; these include the penis, urethra, and vas deferens. Major secondary sexual characteristics include: larger, more muscular stature, deepened voice, facial and body hair, broad shoulders, and development of an Adam's apple. An important sexual hormone of males is androgen, and particularly testosterone. The testes release a hormone that controls the development of sperm. This hormone is also responsible for the development of physical characteristics in men such as facial hair and a deep voice. =Female= Female reproductive systemThe human female reproductive system is a series of organs primarily located inside the body and around the pelvic region of a female that contribute towards the reproductive process. The human female reproductive system contains three main parts: the vulva, which leads to the vagina, the vaginal opening, to the uterus; the uterus, which holds the developing fetus; and the ovaries, which produce the female's ova. The breasts are involved during the parenting stage of reproduction, but in most classifications they are not considered to be part of the female reproductive system. Female genitaliaThe vagina meets the outside at the vulva, which also includes the labia, clitoris and urethra; during intercourse this area is lubricated by mucus secreted by the Bartholin's glands. The vagina is attached to the uterus through the cervix, while the uterus is attached to the ovaries via the Fallopian tubes. Each ovary contains hundreds of egg cells or ova (singular ovum). Approximately every 28 days, the pituitary gland releases a hormone that stimulates some of the ova to develop and grow. One ovum is released and it passes through the Fallopian tube into the uterus. Hormones produced by the ovaries prepare the uterus to receive the ovum. The lining of the uterus, called the endometrium, and unfertilized ova are shed each cycle through the process of menstruation. If the ovum is fertilized by sperm, it attaches to the endometrium and the fetus develops. Development The development of the reproductive system and the development of the urinary system are closely tied in with the development of the human fetus. Despite the differences between the adult female and male are derived from the intermediate mesoderm. The three main fetal precursors of the reproductive organs are the Wolffian duct, the M√ºllerian ducts, and the gonads. Endocrine hormones are a well-known and critical controlling factor in the normal differentiation of the reproductive system.EDRI Federal Project Inventory: Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of Abnormal Reproductive Development US EPA. Dr. William R. Kelce. 2006. The Wolffian duct forms the epididymis, vas deferens, ductus deferens, ejaculatory duct, and seminal vesicle in the male reproductive system, but essentially disappears in the female reproductive system. The reverse is true for the M√ºllerian duct, as it essentially disappears in the male reproductive system and forms the Fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina in the female system. In both sexes the gonads go on to form the testes and ovaries; because they are derived from the same undeveloped structure, they are considered homologous organs. There are a number of other homologous structures shared between male and female reproductive systems. However, despite the similarity in function of the female Fallopian tubes and the male epididymis and vas deferens, they are not homologous but rather analogous structures as they arise from different fetal structures. Reproduction = Production of gametes= Gametes are produced within the gonads through a process known as gametogenesis. This occurs when certain types of germ cells undergo meiosis to split the normal diploid number of chromosomes (n=46) into haploid cells containing only 23 chromosomes.Development of sex cells in Reproductive system, Body Guide. Adam. Anatomy of the testis In males, this process is known as spermatogenesis, and takes place only after puberty in the seminiferous tubules of the testes. The immature spermatozoa or sperm are then sent to the epididymis, where they gain a tail, enabling motility. Each of the original diploid germ cells or primary spermatocytes forms four functional gametes which is each forever young. The production and survival of sperms require a temperature below the normal core body temperature. Since the scrotum, where the testes is present, is situated outside the body cavity, it provides a temperature about 3 ¬∞C below normal body temperature. Anatomy of the ovaryIn females, gametogenesis is known as oogenesis; this occurs in the ovarian follicles of the ovaries. This process does not produce mature ovum until puberty. In contrast with males, each of the original diploid germ cells or primary oocytes will form only one mature ovum, and three polar bodies which are not capable of fertilization. It has long been understood that in females, unlike males, all of the primary oocytes ever found in a female will be created prior to birth, and that the final stages of ova production will then not resume until puberty. However, recent scientific research has challenged that hypothesis. This new research indicates that in at least some species of mammal, oocytes continue to be replenished in females well after birth. Disease Like all complex organ systems, the human reproductive system is affected by many diseases. There are four main categories of reproductive diseases in humans. They are: *genetic or congenital abnormalities, *cancers, *infections, which are often sexually transmitted diseases, *functional problems caused by environmental factors, physical damage, psychological issues, autoimmune disorders, or other causes. The best-known functional problems include sexual dysfunction and infertility, which are both broad terms relating to many disorders with many causes. Specific reproductive diseases are often symptoms of other diseases and disorders, or have multiple, or unknown causes making them difficult to classify. Examples of unclassifiable disorders are Peyronie's disease in males and endometriosis in females. Many congenital conditions cause reproductive abnormalities, but are better known for their other symptoms. These include: Turner syndrome, Klinefelter's syndrome, Cystic fibrosis, and Bloom syndrome.Genetic Conditions > Reproductive system. 2007. Genetics Home Reference. U.S. National Library of Medicine.

He was also recording director for original cast albums, and produced LPs of such Broadway hits as West Side Story, Most Happy Fella, Gypsy, House of Flowers, and Bells are Ringing. During his time as a producer at Columbia, Ham brought more to the studio than his knowledge of music and his natural intuition for recognizing hit material. He brought an electronic knowledge that resulted in many technical studio improvements and a \\"spatial\\" sound that he put to use when he helped to create the first stereo LPs issued by Columbia. He worked with Dr. Peter Goldmark, creator of the Long - Playing record, on special circuit projects that broke new ground for stereo, multi-track recordings and broadcast signal processing. In the commercial field Al worked consistently as a composer and arranger. His commercials have won many awards for best musical theme and scoring, including CLIO Awards and four gold medal winners at the International Film and Television Festivals. As arranger, composer, or both, Al‚Äôs many commercials include State Farm Insurance (\\"Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.\\"), Breck Shampoo, McDonald's (i.e. \\"You Deserve a Break Today\\"), Gillette, Kinney Shoes, Woolco, Kodak, and Scope. Al also composed, arranged, and conducted news and station image music packages that have been broadcast by scores of TV stations across the country. They include \\"Move Closer to Your World\\", \\"Part of Your Life\\", \\"Home Country\\", \\"Bringing it Home to You\\", and \\"On Top of It All\\". Al‚Äôs film credits include the score of the Electronovision version of Harlow, which produced the song \\"I Believed it All\\", (Written with Lyricists Marilyn and Alan Bergman). An Academy Award nomination for his superb adaptation and scoring of Warner Brothers‚Äô Stop the World ‚Äì I Want to Get Off, which he also conducted. And, a Grammy award for the \\"Best Spoken Word Recording\\" for his production of James Whitmore‚Äôs Give 'em Hell, Harry! on United Artists Records. Al also acted as programmer and associate producer for T.A.M.I. (Teenage Musical International) which featured performances by The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys, James Brown, The Supremes, Marvin Gaye, Lesley Gore, Chuck Berry, and many other popular music stars. The show was a front runner of the type of concert programming that is now standard TV fare. Ham‚Äôs additional musical credits include his arrangement and production of \\"I‚Äôd Like to Teach the World to Sing\\" by his group, the Hillside Singers (which included his wife Mary and daughter Lorri) for Metromedia Records, and the recordings he produced with his group The Midas Touch on MCA records. He also received a Grammy nomination for \\"Best Spoken Word Recording\\" for \\"Senator Sam at Home\\". In 1978, after years of research, Ham created the Music of Your Life radio format, which played on over 200 radio stations in the United States. His television news music packages were syndicated through his company, Mayoham Music.

Early life Sex was born on Long Island as John McLaughlin. He attended the School of Visual Arts in New York City, where he knew Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat. He often used the print studio there to create punk-style posters for downtown bands, and later for himself. He exhibited some of his word-based art at the \\"Beyond Words\\" show at the Mudd Club - alongside artists such as Haring, Kenny Scharf, and Futura 2000 and performers Iggy Pop, Fab Five Freddy and Alan Vega - and at the \\"New York / New Wave\\" exhibition at P.S. 1, both in 1981. He soon met Klaus Nomi and Joey Arias in the downtown New York scene and gave up painting, finding he could better express himself in performance. Early in his career, McLaughlin adopted the stage name \\"John Sex\\". He claimed the surname \\"Sex\\" was an Americanization of his family's original name, Sexton, but in fact it was created for him by Arias and Nomi \\"during a period of rampant promiscuity\\".Hager, Steven (1986) Art After Midnight: The East Village Scene, New York: St. Martin‚Äôs Press Career After early work as a gay stripper, Sex became an alternative performance artist, creating a character based on an exaggerated, cheesy Las Vegas lounge singer and master of ceremonies. First, along with other SVA graduates and students and Club 57 \\"Sex developed a persona that simultaneously masked and amplified his polymorphous self, elaborating a mythic yet parodic rock-star figure of mercurial presence\\".Frank, Peter and McKenzie, Michael (1987) New, Used and Improved, New York: Abbyville Press. His \\"Acts of Live Art\\" series there brought performance art into the club context. He was able to further refine the combination of performance art, drag act, gay go-go dancer, cabaret singer, lounge MC, etc. as a performance art dancer who performed at such legendary New York clubs as Club 57, the Pyramid Club, Danceteria, The Palladium, Paradise Garage and Andy Warhol's Underground. His backup singers, \\"The Bodacious TaTa's\\" were often mistaken for drag queens but always consisted of female singers and dancers including Micki French, Wendy Wild, April Palmieri, and Myra Schiller. His costumes were designed by Katy K, who occasionally sat in with the TaTa's. In 1984, John made a cameo appearance in The Cars' music video Hello Again, directed by Warhol. For the 1986 gay pride march in New York City, he organized and helped build a float called the Go-Go Stars float which had go-go dancers from various night clubs go-go dancing on it. He performed \\"Hustle with My Muscle\\" in the 1988 film Mondo New York. His last public performance was at the Club Mars in New York in 1989. He recorded a four-song E.P. for Sire Records, produced by Mark Kamins and Ivan Ivan, as well as 12\\" singles and music videos for his songs \\"Rock Your Body\\" and \\"Hustle with My Muscle\\" and \\"Bump and Grind It\\", the latter of which were produced by video artist Tom Rubnitz. \\"Hustle with My Muscle\\" and \\"Bump and Grind It\\" were released as an A and B side single and this was one of only two releases on Varla Records, a label specialising in alternative New York artists. Sex's trademark was his long, blond hair which stood straight up, and which he claimed was kept erect by a combination of Dippity-do, Aqua Net, egg whites, beer, and semen. He also dressed in flamboyant costumes. He owned a python named Delilah that was often included in his cabaret act. Sometimes he would leave the python on stage and come down into the audience and wrestle with patrons of the club. Death On October 24, 1990, Sex died from AIDS- related complications at the age of 34. Sex's longtime partner, Wilfredo Vela, succumbed to similar complications four years later.

A Music War is a 1982 British film featuring performances by punk rock, new wave, and post-punk acts, filmed in 1980. Among the artists featured in the film are Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), Magazine, The Go-Go's, Toyah Willcox, The Fleshtones, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts, X, XTC, Devo, The Cramps, Oingo Boingo, Dead Kennedys, Gary Numan, Klaus Nomi, Wall of Voodoo, Pere Ubu, Steel Pulse, Surf Punks, 999, The Alley Cats, UB40, Echo & the Bunnymen and The Police. These were many of the most popular groups on the New Wave scene; in keeping with the spirit of the scene, the film also features several less famous acts, and one completely obscure group, Invisible Sex, in what appears to be their only public performance.  Original release  Urgh! A Music War consists of a series of performances, without narration or explanatory text. All performances are live, recorded around 1980, mainly in England and the USA. Clips were also taken from a concert in Fr√©jus, Var, France with The Police, XTC, Skafish and UB40 among others. In 1981, a year before release of the film, A&M; Records released a double-album soundtrack. The selection of songs was almost the same as the film, but there were a few minor changes and several acts featured in the film did not make it to the album (Dead Kennedys, John Cooper Clarke, Chelsea, Surf Punks, Invisible Sex, Splodgenessabounds, UB40).  Subsequent distribution  Urgh! A Music War was briefly released to theatres by Filmways Pictures, but acquired a cult following in the United States in the 1980s due to its frequent showings on the USA Network. It aired on VH1 Classic on 30 October 2006 as part of its Rock and Roll Picture series. The film has been released on videocassette, LaserDisc, and DVD. The film rights are owned by both its original producer, Miles Copeland III (founder of IRS Records), and Warner Bros. Pictures (successor-in-interest to production company Lorimar). However, the rights to distribute the film on electronic media have been, until recently, mired in red tape. A popular theory was that the rights were \\"lost\\" as a result of the collapse of the failed CED or SelectaVision videodisc format ‚Äì to promote the adoption of the format, RCA reportedly purchased exclusive rights to Urgh! such that it could not appear on any other media without re-negotiation. When Thomson Electronics acquired RCA, SelectaVision was a dead issue for them. Exhibition rights were retained by Copeland, and Urgh! has been shown on TV numerous times, including recent airings on VH1 and various cable-only channels. Portions of Urgh! appear elsewhere in film and video: The Klaus Nomi clip \\"Total Eclipse\\" appears in the 2004 documentary The Nomi Song, and details of its filming are discussed. The 1982 documentary The Police: Around The World was also filmed by Derek Burbidge and features footage used in Urgh! as well as other footage filmed at the same concert. Joan Jett's \\"Bad Reputation\\" footage was used in the 2003 Blackheart Records DVD release of \\"Real Wild Child\\" Video Anthology. \\"Bad Reputation\\" (Audio only) was also issued on Blackheart Records 2006's Reissue of \\"Flashback\\". In addition to recent cable showings, some remaining intact prints of the movie have toured the US in recent years (one tour sponsored by the humor periodical The Onion), and video showings in clubs and film houses have sparked a resurgence of interest in the film, which resulted in a DVD release by Warner Bros. as part of its \\"Warner Archive\\" series of DVD issues of their lesser-known titles from the WB vaults. It is now available via the WB website.  Official DVD release  In August 2009, Warner Archive released an official DVD-R of the movie, which is burned on a made-to-order basis. As noted on the Warner Archive Website, the movie has not been remastered or restored, but is presented in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio widescreen format. There is a trailer included, which is the only feature other than the film itself. There are no chapter indexes for the individual tracks, but rather 10-minute chapters. Splodgenessabounds' performance of \\"Two Little Boys\\" is omitted from the DVD, with the other original performances remaining. The DVD is for US distribution only.

The novel is set in the Lammermuir Hills of south-east Scotland, shortly before the Act of Union of 1707 (in the first edition), or shortly after the Act (in the 'Magnum' edition of 1830). It tells of a tragic love affair between young Lucy Ashton and her family's enemy Edgar Ravenswood. Scott indicated the plot was based on an actual incident. The Bride of Lammermoor and A Legend of Montrose were published together anonymously as the third of Scott's Tales of My Landlord series. The story is the basis for Donizetti's 1835 opera Lucia di Lammermoor. Composition and sources It is not known exactly when Scott contracted to write Tales of my Landlord (Third Series), but he began composition at the beginning of September 1818, some two months after completing The Heart of Midlothian and finished it in late April or early May the following year. During March he had to suspend work after a near-fatal attack of gallstones, but about a week into April he set about dictating the final chapters (from a little into Chapter 26 to the end), apparently to John Ballantyne and William Laidlaw.Walter Scott, The Bride of Lammermoor, ed. J. H. Alexander (Edinburgh, 1995), 271‚Äì74. Scott was acquainted with the central story of the novel from oral and printed sources, drawing on the various versions and modifying them for his fictional purposes (see 'The Ashton story' below). The presence of the Gowrie Conspiracy, familiar to him from his editorial labours in the 17th century, can be felt at a number of points in the work. For the hunting descriptions he was able to call on a work in his library, the second edition of George Turbervile's anonymous The Noble Art of Venerie or Hunting (1611).Ibid., 333‚Äì36, 340. Editions The first edition of Tales of my Landlord (Third Series), consisting of The Bride of Lammermoor and A Legend of Montrose was published by Archibald Constable in Edinburgh on 21 June 1819 and in London by Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown on the 26th.For a full account of the early editions see Ibid., 274‚Äì92. As with all the Waverley novels before 1827 publication was anonymous. The print run was probably 10,000 and the price was ¬£1 12s (¬£1.60). Scott appears to have made some small changes to the text of the Bride when it appeared later in 1819 in the octavo Novels and Tales, but his main revision was carried out in late 1829 and early 1830 for the 'Magnum' edition, including the provision of notes and an introduction: it appeared as part of Volume 13 and the whole of Volume 14 in June and July 1830. For the 'Magnum' Scott moved the action from just before the Act of Union of 1707 to the period immediately following it. The standard modern edition, by J. H. Alexander, was published as Volume 7a of the Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels in 1993: this is based on the first edition with emendations principally from Scott's manuscript; the new Magnum material is included in Volume 25a. Plot summary The story recounts the tragic love of Lucy Ashton and Edgar, Master of Ravenswood. Edgar's father was stripped of his title for supporting the deposed King James VII. Lucy's ambitious father, Sir William Ashton, then bought the Ravenswood estate. Edgar hates Sir William for this usurpation of his family's heritage, but on meeting Lucy, falls in love with her, and renounces his plans for vengeance. Sir William's haughty and manipulative wife, Lady Ashton, is the villainess of the story. She is determined to end the initial happy engagement of Edgar and Lucy, and force Lucy into a politically advantageous arranged marriage. Lady Ashton intercepts Edgar's letters to Lucy and persuades Lucy that Edgar has forgotten her. Edgar leaves Scotland for France, to continue his political activities. While he is away, Lady Ashton continues her campaign. She gets Captain Westenho, a wandering soldier of fortune, to tell everyone that Edgar is about to get married in France. She even recruits \\"wise woman\\" Ailsie Gourlay (a witch in all but name) to show Lucy omens and tokens of Edgar's unfaithfulness. Lucy still clings to her troth, asking for word from Edgar that he has broken off with her; she writes to him. Lady Ashton suppresses Lucy's letter, and brings the Reverend Bide-the-bent to apply religious persuasion to Lucy. However, Bide-the-bent instead helps Lucy send a new letter, but there is no answer. Lady Ashton finally bullies Lucy into marrying Francis, Laird of Bucklaw. But on the day before the wedding, Edgar returns. Seeing that Lucy has signed the betrothal papers with Bucklaw, he repudiates Lucy, who can barely speak. The wedding takes place the next day, followed by a celebration at Ravenswood. While the guests are dancing, Lucy stabs Bucklaw in the bridal chamber, severely wounding him. She descends quickly into insanity and dies. Bucklaw recovers, but refuses to say what had happened. Edgar reappears at Lucy's funeral. Lucy's older brother, blaming him for her death, insists that they meet in a duel. Edgar, in despair, reluctantly agrees. But on the way to the meeting, Edgar falls into quicksand and dies. Characters principal characters in bold Chapter summary Volume One Ch. 1: Peter Pattieson tells how he compiled the following tale from fragmentary notes taken by his late friend, the artist Dick Tinto, from one of the stories told by a Lammermoor farmer's wife. Ch. 2: The narrator introduces the Ravenswood and Ashton families. Edgar Ravenswood buries his father in an episcopalian ceremony, defying the authority of the local kirk session and Sir William Ashton as Lord Keeper. Ch. 3: The recollection of a medieval act of revenge by a Ravenswood leads Ashton to suspend his intended legal proceedings against Edgar. He takes his daughter Lucy for a walk in the park, encountering his forester Norman who despises him for lacking a taste for sport. Ch. 4: Ashton and his daughter visit old Alice, who warns him of the vengeful nature of the Ravenswoods. Ch. 5: Edgar rescues Lucy from a wild bull and tends her at a fountain popularly believed to be unlucky for the Ravenswoods. He reveals his identity and leaves. Lucy's imagination nourishes thoughts of Edgar, and her father tones down his report on the funeral, to the surprise of his colleagues in Edinburgh. Ch. 6: Bucklaw and Craigengelt discuss their support for Edgar in his dispute with Ashton, but on his arrival Edgar says he has decided to drop the matter, arousing the indignation of the pair. Ch. 7: Challenged to a duel by Bucklaw, Edgar defeats him before offering him shelter at his dilapidated castle of Wolfscrag, to the displeasure of his servant Caleb. Ch. 8: Edgar and Bucklaw pass several days of inactivity at Wolfscrag. A letter arrives from the Marquis of A‚Äî‚Äî advising him against travelling abroad but offering him no hospitality. Ch. 9: Surprised by a storm while out hunting the Ashtons take refuge at Wolfscrag. Ch. 10: Conscious of the lack of provisions, Caleb excludes the Ashton grooms and Bucklaw, who indignantly joins Craigengelt at the Wolfshope inn. As Edgar greets Lucy at the castle there is a fearful burst of lightning and thunder. Ch. 11: Caleb says the thunder has spoiled a lavish (fictitious) feast. Ch. 12: Caleb steals a duck from the turnspit at the house of John Girder the cooper, part of the refreshments for a christening party. Ch. 13: Girder is at first indignant at Caleb's raid, but he sends additional provisions to Wolfscrag when he sees the chance of winning promotion through the good offices of the Lord Keeper. Ch. 14: Caleb and Ashton's servant Lockhard discuss the Ravenswoods and the Ashtons. Ashton suggests to Edgar that they should reconcile their differences. Volume Two Ch. 1 (15): The narrator explains the self-seeking political reasoning behind Ashton's wish for a reconciliation with Edgar. Ch. 2 (16): Edgar declines to discuss his legal dispute with Ashton, who is planning to make use of the relationship between Edgar and his daughter for his own purposes. Craigengelt conveys a challenge from Bucklaw to Edgar and is sent packing. Ch. 3 (17): Ashton convinces Edgar that he has treated him well in sparing him the consequences of his father's funeral, and Edgar professes his friendship. Ch. 4 (18): Caleb tries to deter Edgar from visiting Ravenswood Castle, now occupied by the Ashtons, citing an old prophecy, but Edgar ignores him and on his arrival frightens young Henry Ashton with his resemblance to a portrait of his vengeful ancestor Sir Malise Ravenswood. Ch. 5 (19): Edgar and Lucy visit Alice who warns against their alliance. Ch. 6 (20): Edgar and Lucy become engaged at the fountain, dividing a gold coin between them. On their return to Ravenswood Castle they learn that the Marquis of A‚Äî‚Äî is planning a visit. Ch. 7 (21): Edgar and Lucy find they disagree on several matters but their relationship continues to grow. Craigengelt gives Bucklaw his support in his intention to marry Lucy, the match being favoured by Lady Ashton and Bucklaw's kinswoman Lady Blenkinsop. Ch. 8 (22): Craigengelt informs Lady Ashton, who is staying with Lady Blenkinsop, of Edgar's residence at Ravenswood Castle. She arrives at the Castle simultaneously with the Marquis. In spite of her husband's objection Lady Ashton writes a note requiring Edgar to leave the castle, incurring the Marquis's displeasure. Ch. 9 (23): Edgar sees an apparition of Alice at the fountain. He arrives at her cottage to find her dead, and three old women arrive to lay her out. Ch. 10 (24): Edgar arranges Alice's funeral with the sexton John Mortsheugh. Ch. 11 (25): The Marquis expresses doubts about the wisdom of Edgar's relationship with Lucy and offers him a political commission involving a period on the Continent. Caleb announces that Wolfscrag, to which Edgar and the Marquis are bound, is on fire. He is made welcome at the house of John Girder, now promoted. Ch. 12 (26): Caleb explains to Edgar that the fire was in reality not in Wolfscrag, but a device to avoid the necessity to entertain the Marquis and his entourage. Ch. 13 (27): In Edinburgh Edgar writes to Lady Ashton, Ashton, and Lucy and receives replies, uncompromising, non-committal, and distressed respectively. Volume Three Ch. 1 (28): Twelve months have passed, and Bucklaw and Craigengelt discuss Bucklaw's impending marriage to Lucy. Ch. 2 (29): Bucklaw and Lady Ashton agree with Lucy that the marriage documents will be signed if no word has been received from Edgar by St Jude's day. Ch. 3 (30): (This and the following chapter fill in developments retrospectively.) Lady Ashton exercised strict control on Lucy's movements and correspondence. Ch. 4 (31): The 'wise woman' Aislie Gourlay was brought in to act as Lucy's nurse and told her dark stories about the Ravenswoods. A strict minister was also summoned, but he agreed to forward a letter from Lucy to Edgar, reproducing one dictated by her mother but which Lady Ashton had decided not to send: this was phrased so as to appear to be a request for Edgar to renounce their engagement. Ch. 5 (32): On St Jude's day Edgar arrives just as the marriage contract has been signed. Ch. 6 (33): Edgar renounces the engagement in conformity with what he takes to be Lucy's wish, though she is almost entirely silent. Ch. 7 (34): Lucy stabs Bucklaw on their wedding night and dies the following day. Ch. 8 (35): At Lucy's funeral Colonel Ashton arranges a duel with Edgar at sunrise the following morning. On his way to the arranged meeting-place Edgar and his horse disappear in a quicksand. Reception Among reviewers only the writer in The Scotsman found The Bride of Lammermoor uniformly excellent.For a full list of contemporaneous British reviews see William S. Ward, Literary Reviews in British Periodicals, 1798‚Äí1820: A Bibliography, 2 vols (New York and London, 1972), 2.488. For an earlier annotated list see James Clarkson Corson, A Bibliography of Sir Walter Scott (Edinburgh and London, 1943), 223‚Äí25. There was a general tendency to lament the familiar stylistic carelessness and weak plotting, and some reviewers saw a distinct decline from the preceding novels, with signs of exhaustion and less interesting subject matter. Repetition of characters was mentioned more than once, though sometimes with a recognition that there were discriminations to be discerned, and in general the characterisation and the dialogue of the lower orders was appreciated. The tragic power of the final scenes was widely appreciated, but the admixture of ludicrous humour was a defect for some, as was the overall gloomy and painful atmosphere. Caleb was widely praised, but there were complaints that he was unvarying and that he perhaps outstayed his welcome. Views differed on the superstitious element, variously judged effectively employed, or foolish and unfortunately pervasive. The introductory chapter centring on Dick Tinto pleased reviewers more than the Cleishbotham openings of earlier novels. The Ashton story Viscount Stair (1619‚Äì1695) whose daughter provided the model for Lucy Ashton The story is fictional, but according to Scott's introduction to the novel for the 'Magnum' edition it was based on an actual incident in the history of the Dalrymple and Rutherford families. Scott heard this story from his mother, Anne Rutherford, and his great aunt Margaret Swinton. The model for Lucy Ashton was Janet Dalrymple, eldest daughter of James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair, and his wife Margaret Ross of Balneil. As a young woman, Janet secretly pledged her troth to Archibald, third Lord Rutherfurd, relative and heir of the Earl of Teviot, who was thus the model for Edgar of Ravenswood. When another suitor appeared - David Dunbar, heir of Sir David Dunbar of Baldoon Castle near Wigtown - Janet's mother, Margaret, discovered the betrothal but insisted on the match with Dunbar. Rutherfurd's politics were unacceptable to the Dalrymples: Lord Stair was a staunch Whig, whereas Rutherfurd was an ardent supporter of Charles II. Nor was his lack of fortune in his favour. Attempting to intercede he wrote to Janet, but received a reply from her mother, stating that Janet had seen her mistake. A meeting was then arranged, during which Margaret quoted the Book of Numbers (chapter XXX, verses 2‚Äì5), which states that a father may overrule a vow made by his daughter in her youth. The marriage went ahead on 24 August 1669, in the church of Old Luce, Wigtownshire, two miles south of Carsecleugh Castle, one of her father's estates. Her younger brother later recollected that Janet's hand was \\"cold and damp as marble\\", and she remained impassive the whole day. While the guests danced the couple retired to the bedchamber. When screaming was heard from the room, the door was forced open and the guests found Dunbar stabbed and bleeding. Janet, whose shift was bloody, cowered in the corner, saying only \\"take up thy bonny bridgroom.\\" Janet died, apparently insane, on 12 September, without divulging what had occurred. She was buried on 30 September. Dunbar recovered from his wounds, but similarly refused to explain the event. He remarried in 1674, to Lady Eleanor Montgomerie, daughter of the Earl of Eglinton, but died on 28 March 1682 after falling from a horse between Leith and Edinburgh. Rutherfurd died in 1685, without children. It was generally believed that Janet had stabbed her new husband, though other versions of the story suggest that Rutherfurd hid in the bedchamber in order to attack his rival Dunbar, before escaping through the window. The involvement of the devil or other malign spirits has also been suggested. Scott quotes the Rev. Andrew Symson (1638‚Äì1712), former minister of Kirkinner, who wrote a contemporary elegy \\"On the unexpected death of the virtuous Lady Mrs. Janet Dalrymple, Lady Baldoon, younger\\", which also records the dates of the events. More scurrilous verses relating to the story are also quoted by Scott, including those by Lord Stair's political enemy Sir William Hamilton of Whitelaw. It is said that Janet was buried at Newliston near Edinburgh, but Janet's brother John, later Earl of Stair, married Elizabeth Dundas of Newliston in 1669, and he may not have been at Newliston when Janet died. Janet may have been buried by her husband at Glenluce. Scott's biographers have compared elements of The Bride of Lammermuir with Scott's own romantic involvement with Williamina Belsches in the 1790s. The bitterness apparent in the relationship between Lucy Ashton and Edgar of Ravenswood after their betrothal is broken has been compared to Scott's disappointment when, after courting her for some time, Belsches married instead the much wealthier William Forbes. Locations The precipitous Fast Castle, identified with the \\"Wolf's Crag\\" The spelling Lammermoor is an Anglicisation of the Scots Lammermuir. The Lammermuir Hills are a range of moors which divide East Lothian to the north from Berwickshire in the Scottish Borders to the south. The fictional castle \\"Wolf's Crag\\" has been identified with Fast Castle on the Berwickshire coast. Scott stated that he was \\"not competent to judge of the resemblance... having never seen Fast Castle except from the sea.\\" He did approve of the comparison, writing that the situation of Fast Castle \\"seems certainly to resemble that of Wolf's Crag as much as any other\\". The name \\"Edgar\\" Like most Anglo-Saxon names, the name \\"Edgar\\" had fallen out of use by the later medieval period. The success of The Bride of Lammermoor had a considerable role in this name being revived and becoming widely used, up to the present.

The open-loop gain of many electronic amplifiers is exceedingly high (by design) ‚Äì an ideal operational amplifier (op-amp) has infinite open-loop gain. Typically an op-amp may have a maximal open-loop gain of around 10^5. Normally, negative feedback is applied around an amplifier with high open-loop gain, to reduce the gain of the complete circuit to a desired value. Definition The definition of open-loop gain (at a fixed frequency) is :A_\\\\text{OL} = \\\\frac{V_\\\\text{out}}{V^+ - V^-}, where V^ + -V^- is the input voltage difference that is being amplified. (The dependence on frequency is not displayed here.) Role in non-ideal gain The open-loop gain is a physical attribute of an operational amplifier that is often finite in comparison to the ideal gain. While open-loop gain is the gain when there is no feedback in a circuit, an operational amplifier will often be configured to use a feedback configuration such that its gain will be controlled by the feedback circuit components. Take the case of an inverting operational amplifier configuration. If the resistor between the single output node and the inverting input node is R_2 and the resistor between a source voltage and the inverting input node is R_1, then the calculated gain of such a circuit at the output terminal is defined, assuming infinite gain in the amplifier, is: :G = - \\\\frac{R_2}{R_1} However, including the finite open-loop gain A reduces the gain slightly, to: :G = \\\\frac{-\\\\frac{R_2}{R_1}}{1 + (1+{\\\\frac{R_2}{R_1}})\\\\frac{1}{A}} For example, if \\\\frac{R_2}{R_1} = 2 and A = 10^4, then G = ‚àí1.9994 instead of exactly ‚àí2. (The second equation becomes effectively the same as the first equation as A approaches infinity.) The open-loop gain can be important for computing the actual gain of an operational amplifier network, where the assumption of infinite open-loop gain is inaccurate. Operational amplifiers The open-loop gain of an operational amplifier falls very rapidly with increasing frequency. Along with slew rate, this is one of the reasons why operational amplifiers have limited bandwidth.

It provides recognition to universities in India, and disbursements of funds to such recognized universities and colleges. Without its recognition, no university in India can grant degrees. Its headquarters is in New Delhi, and has six regional centres in Pune, Bhopal, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Guwahati and Bangalore.University Grants Commission Govt. of India website. A proposal to replace it with another new regulatory body called HECI is under consideration by the Government of India. UGC is modelled after University Grants Committee of UK which was an advisory committee of the British government and advised on the distribution of grant funding amongst the British universities. The committee was in existence from 1919 until 1989. History The UGC was first formed in 1945 to oversee the work of the three Central Universities of Aligarh, Banaras and Delhi. Its responsibility was extended in 1947 to cover all Indian universities. In August 1949 a recommendation was made to reconstitute the UGC along similar lines to the University Grants Committee of the United Kingdom. This recommendation was made by the University Education Commission of 1948-1949 which was set up under the chairmanship of S. Radhakrishnan \\"to report on Indian university education and suggest improvements and extensions\\". In 1952 the government decided that all grants to universities and higher learning institutions should be handled by the UGC. Subsequently, an inauguration was held on 28 December 1953 by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, the Minister of Education, Natural Resources and Scientific Research. In November 1956 the UGC became a statutory body upon the passing of the \\"University Grants Commission Act, 1956\\" by the Indian Parliament. In 1994 and 1995 the UGC decentralised its operations by setting up six regional centres at Pune, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Bhopal, Guwahati and Bangalore. The head office of the UGC is located at Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg in New Delhi, with two additional bureaus operating from 35, Feroze Shah Road and the South Campus of University of Delhi as well. In December 2015 the Indian government set a National Institutional of Ranking Framework under UGC which will rank all educational institutes by April 2016. In December 2017 D.P. Singh, former director of National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), was appointed chairman for a period of five years, replacing UGC member Virander Singh Chauhan, who officiated the position since the retirement of Ved Prakash in April 2017. Types of universities The types of universities controlled by the UGC include: * Central universities, or Union universities, are established by an Act of Parliament and are under the purview of the Department of Higher Education in the Ministry of Education. , The list of central universities published by the UGC includes 49 central universities. * State universities are run by the state government of each of the states and territories of India and are usually established by a local legislative assembly act. , the UGC lists 370 state universities. The oldest establishment date listed by the UGC is 1857, shared by the University of Mumbai, the University of Madras and the University of Calcutta. Most State Universities are affiliating universities in that they administer many affiliated colleges (many located in very small towns) that typically offer a range of undergraduate courses, but may also offer post-graduate courses. More established colleges may even offer Ph.D. programs in some departments with the approval of the affiliating university. * Deemed university, or \\"Deemed to be University\\", is a status of autonomy granted by the Department of Higher Education on the advice of the UGC, under Section 3 of the UGC Act. , the UGC lists 123 deemed universities. According to this list, the first institute to be granted deemed university status was Indian Institute of Science, which was granted this status on 12 May 1958. In many cases, the same listing by the UGC covers several institutes. For example, the listing for Homi Bhabha National Institute covers the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research and other institutes. * Private universities are approved by the UGC. They can grant degrees but they are not allowed to have off-campus affiliated colleges. , the UGC list of private universities lists 282 universities. The University Grants Commission (UGC) has also released the list of 24 fake Universities operating in India. UGC has said that these 24 self-styled, unrecognized institutions functioning in contravention of the UGC Act have been declared as fake and are not entitled to confer any degrees. Professional councils UGC, along with CSIR currently conducts NET for appointments of teachers in colleges and universities. It has made NET qualification mandatory for teaching at graduation level and at post-graduation level since July 2009. However, those with Ph.D are given five percent relaxation. Accreditation for higher learning over universities under the aegis of University Grants Commission is overseen by following fifteen autonomous statutory institutions: * All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) * Distance Education Council (DEC) * Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) * Bar Council of India (BCI) * Board of Theological Education of the Senate of Serampore College (BTESSC) * National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) * Rehabilitation Council of India (RCI) * Medical Council of India (MCI)/National Medical Commission (NMC) * Pharmacy Council of India (PCI) * Indian Nursing Council (INC) * Dental Council of India (DCI) * Central Council of Homoeopathy (CCH) * Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM) * National Council for Rural Institutes (NCRI) * State Councils of Higher Education (SCHE) * Council of Architecture * Veterinary Council of India (VCI)  Future In 2009, the Union Minister of Human Resource Development, Kapil Sibal made known the government of India's plans to consider the closing down of the UGC and the related body All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), in favour of a higher regulatory body with more sweeping powers. This goal, proposed by the Higher Education and Research (HE&R;) Bill, 2011, intends to replace the UGC with a National Commission for Higher Education & Research (NCHER) \\"for determination, coordination, maintenance and continued enhancement of standards of higher education and research\\". The bill proposes absorbing the UGC and other academic agencies into this new organisation. Those agencies involved in medicine and law would be exempt from this merger \\"to set minimum standards for medical and legal education leading to professional practice\\". The bill has received opposition from the local governments of the Indian states of Bihar, Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, but has received general support. On 27 June 2018, the Ministry of Human Resource Development announced its plans to repeal the UGC Act, 1956. A bill was expected to be introduced in the 2018 monsoon session of the Parliament, which if passed would have led to the dissolution of the UGC. The bill also stipulated formation of a new body, the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI). This form of the bill was ultimately dropped in the face of strong political opposition, and was reworked in 2019 in order to gain political consensus. As of mid-2020 the UGC continues to remain in existence.

All About Collecting Boys' Series Books. Hobby House Press, Inc., 2002. In the series, teenaged Rick Brant and his ex-Marine pal, Don \\"Scotty\\" Scott live on Spindrift Island off the coast of New Jersey, where Rick's father, Hartson Brant, heads the Spindrift Foundation, a group of scientists. Rick and Scotty are involved in various adventures at home and abroad. Besides Hartson Brant, the recurring supporting characters in the series include: * Barbara \\"Barby\\" Brant, Rick's younger sister * Chahda, a resourceful youth from India, who learnt everything he knows, including how to speak English, from reading the 1950 edition of the World Almanac. * Janice Miller (Jan), daughter of Dr. Walter Miller, a Spindrift scientist; Barbara's friend * Dismal (\\"Diz\\"), the Brant family dog * Steve Ames, an agent of \\"JANIG\\", the fictional Joint Army-Navy Intelligence Group Various Spindrift scientists also appear several times: * Hobart Zircon, a physicist * Julius Weiss, a mathematician * Parnell Winston, a cyberneticist * Tony Briotti, an archaeologist * John Gordon, a rocket designer The Rick Brant series has a scientific tone and was taglined as \\"Electronic Adventures\\", \\"Science- Adventure Stories\\", and finally \\"SCIENCE Adventures\\". The science in the stories is realistic, unlike the more fantastic science of Tom Swift, Jr. Hal Goodwin was a popular science writer with a strong technical background and a sense of style unusual in the juvenile adventure-series field. The books are suspenseful, well-plotted, atmospheric, and enriched by humor and acute characterization as well as personal experience. Exotic locales such as tropical islands, the Philippine jungles, and the Himalayas were given vivid and well-researched depictions, as were a variety of specialized hobbies and professions, such as scuba diving, infrared photography, home rocketry, and the inevitable espionage work. Rick was also a private pilot who owned his own airplanes and used them in a number of the books. His first plane was apparently a Piper J-4, and in later books he flew a Cessna 180 and a Stinson 108. Like the Ken Holt mystery series, the tales appealed to a slightly older audience than did the typical Grosset & Dunlap titles. (Ken Holt had a crossover cameo in The Flying Stingaree, and Rick lent some of his gadgets to Ken in The Mystery of the Plumed Serpent, by agreement of the respective authors.) The publishers were averse to any suggestion of the supernatural in the series. An ambiguous end to The Blue Ghost Mystery was dropped, and an entire book (The Magic Talisman) was rejected due to its inclusion of ESP elements. This lost tale was eventually published in an independent edition in 1990. Beginning in the 1980s, Grosset & Dunlap began transferring the copyrights to Hal Goodwin. The rights are now held by the John Blaine/Rick Brant Trust. The Goodwin family has been working to bring the works back in print, starting with the rarer final four books. Rick Brant never graduated to any other medium of entertainment, although there are notable similarities to be found in the Jonny Quest franchise.

Meath, Ireland ‚Äì March 23, 1794 in Bonete, Spain),de Pedro, Jose Montero (2000), The Spanish in New Orleans and Louisiana, Gretna, LA: Pelican Publishing Company Inc., English: Alexander, Count of O'Reilly, Irish: Alastar √ì Raghallaigh, was an Irish-born military reformer and Inspector-General of Infantry for the Spanish Empire in the second half of the 18th century. O'Reilly served as the second Spanish governor of colonial Louisiana, and was the first Spanish official to exercise power in the Louisiana territory after France ceded it to Spain following defeat by Great Britain in the Seven Years' War. For his much-appreciated services to the Crown of Spain, O'Reilly was ennobled as a conde (count), and granted a coat of arms. Origins and military career Alexander O'Reilly (Irish: √ì Raghallaigh) was born in Baltrasna, Co. Meath, in the Kingdom of Ireland in 1723. His grandfather John Reyly was a colonel in the army of James II, whose regiment‚ÄîO‚ÄôReilly‚Äôs Dragoons‚Äîfought at the siege of Derry. The family was from Baltrasna, in County Meath. Like many so-called \\"Wild Geese\\" of his generation, O'Reilly left Ireland to serve in foreign, Catholic armies. He joined Spanish forces fighting in Italy against the Austrians. After campaigning in the Spanish invasion of Portugal, O'Reilly swore allegiance to Spain and rose to become a brigadier general. O'Reilly stayed acting for the Conde de Ricla, twice a Grandee of Spain, in Havana, Cuba, as his adjutant and second-in-command. While in Havana, Ricla and O'Reilly received the city back from the British forces that had captured it during the Seven Years' War. O'Reilly analyzed what had gone wrong with the defenses of Havana during the successful British siege. He recommended sweeping reforms to improve the fortifications, training, practices, and troop organizations, which were quickly approved by the Spanish Crown. With the help of a military engineer of the Royal Army, Silvestre de la Abarca, the works of the strategic fortress of La Caba√±a was undertaken.Foster & Reynolds Co(1905), Standard Guide to Cuba: A New and Complete Guide to the Island of Cuba, : Foster & Reynolds; Diamond news Cowww.havanabuildings.com \\"San Carlos de la Caba√±a Fortress\\" In 1765, King Carlos III sent O'Reilly to the island of Puerto Rico to assess the state of the defenses of that colony. O'Reilly, known today as the \\"father of the Puerto Rican militia,\\" took a complete census of the island and recommended numerous reforms, including instilling strict military discipline in the local troops. He insisted that the men serving the defense of the realm receive their pay regularly and directly, rather than indirectly from their commanding officers, a long-standing practice that had led to abuses.Ortiz, Altagracia (1983), Eighteenth-century Reforms in the Caribbean: Miguel de Muesas, Governor of Puerto Rico, 1769-76, : Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, Some of O'Reilly's recommendations resulted in a massive 20-year program of building up the Castle of Old San Juan, now a World Heritage Site. Returning to Cuba, O'Reilly married into a prominent Cuban family. His wife, Do√±a Rosa de Las Casas, was the sister of Luis de Las Casas, who served as Governor of Cuba.www.cervantesvirtual.com \\"Historia del reinado de Carlos III en Espa√±a Antonio Ferrer del R√≠o\\" O'Reilly was an uncle of Juan MacKenna, a hero of the Chilean War of Independence. So too was he a cousin of Hugo Ocon√≥r or Hugh O'Conor. He was a member of the noble O'Conor Don family, is the founding father of the city of Tucson, Arizona, and was later the 23rd Governor of the Spanish Colony of Texas and then the Governor of Yucat√°n. Captain General O'Reilly was appointed Governor and Captain-General of colonial Louisiana while in Spain in April 1769, with orders to immediately proceed to Havana, embark 3,000 troops there, put down the revolt in Louisiana, and re-establish order. Some French colonists, known as Creoles as they were born in the colony, had worked to expel the first Spanish governor after France ceded this territory. Arriving in New Orleans in August 1769, O'Reilly took formal possession of Louisiana. O'Reilly held trials and severely punished those French Creoles who were responsible for the expulsion of Spain's first colonial Governor Antonio de Ulloa (1716 - 1795), from the colony. He is remembered in New Orleans as \\"Bloody O'Reilly\\" because he had six prominent rebel French colonists executed, in October 1769. In December 1769 he allowed the Acadians who had settled in present-day Arkansas on the Mississippi River opposite Natchez to resettle on the Amite River near Lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain.Holmes, Jack D.L. (1970). A Guide to Spanish Louisiana, 1762-1806. New Orleans: A.F. Laborde. Other French rebels were exiled, and some were sent for life imprisonment in the Morro Castle in Havana. Having crushed the ringleaders who had led the Louisiana Rebellion of 1768 (the uprising against Ulloa and Spanish rule), O'Reilly sent most of his troops back to Cuba. He concentrated on organizing Louisiana's administration and on stabilizing the food supply. It had historically imported grains from northern French settlements along the Mississippi, as they could not be cultivated near New Orleans. O'Reilly reformed many French bureaucratic practices which were in place before Spanish rule. Again, as in his 1765 mission to Puerto Rico, O'Reilly's proclamations and rulings affected many aspects of life in Spanish Louisiana. He allowed slaves to purchase their freedom and enabled slave owners to more easily manumit slaves. He banned the trade of Native American slaves and abolished Indian slavery. He regularized the weights and measurements used in marketplaces, regulated doctors and surgeons, and improved public safety by funding bridge and levee maintenance. Having restored public order, O'Reilly assigned the post of Governor of Louisiana to the Colonel of the Havana Regiment in December 1769, retaining the post of Captain-General for himself. Louisiana was firmly placed as a dependency of the military and political establishment in Cuba. Return to Spain Back in Spain after October 1770, O'Reilly was charged to organize six new regiments to be trained near C√°diz, ready for transportation to the Caribbean should a new war between Spain and Great Britain break out. In 1775, O'Reilly was given command of a major Spanish expedition attacking Algiers. Although this North African campaign was a disaster, the high reputation of O'Reilly was not destroyed, and he continued to serve as captain-general in southern Spain. He died in the city of C√°diz in 1794, aged 72, while on his way to take command of an army in the Eastern Pyrenees that had been ordered to oppose invading French revolutionary forces, just after the beheading of Louis XVI.

Cover of Ourika Overview Ourika is a story based on the life of a woman who was purchased as a child (in or around 1786) by the Chevalier de Boufflers, the colonial administrator of Senegal, and given as a gift to the de Beauvau family. The novel marks a critical point in European literature. It is the first French text to depict a black woman character with a complex psychology.Pratima Prasad, Colonialism, Race and the French Romantic Imagination, 102. It is the first text to create \\"an articulate and educated black woman narrator,\\" Kadish, Doris Y., Ourika‚Äôs Three Versions: A Comparison, Translating Slavery: Gender and Race in French Women‚Äôs Writing, 1783-1823, √âd.

Shreve, Kent, Kent State UP, 1994 and \\"one of the most compelling works of short fiction in French and a startlingly modern commentary on race.\\"Christopher Miller, The French Atlantic The novella covers the time before, during, and after the French Revolution and addresses key themes of race, nationality, exile, interracial love and kinship and the psychological adjustment to these. It signifies an important movement from traditional notions of race, nationality, and kinship towards the identity politics of today. History of the Ourika story, and different versions In his journal, the Chevalier de Boufflers wrote of the purchase of the slave girl whose life would later be documented in Duras' novella: 'I am buying at the moment a little N√©gresse of two or three years of age in order to send her to Madame de Duchess of Orl√©ans‚Ä¶ I feel myself brought to tears in thinking that this poor child has been sold to me like a little lamb.\\" Ourika died at sixteen of a mysterious illness. The Duchess of Orl√©ans's little N√©gresse provided lively conversation in the salons of nineteenth-century Paris where Boufflers's letters were read. And these 'lively' conversations provided fodder for Claire de Duras's fictional Ourika.T. Denean Sharpley Whiting. ‚ÄúBlack Blood, White Masks, and N√®gresse Sexuality in De Pon‚Äôs ‚ÄòOurika.

The life of the real-life Ourika was a subject of much conversation in many nineteenth century Paris, and spawned many poems, plays and novels in the popular press, including La Nouvelle Ourika (1824) and La N√©gresse (1826).Prasad, Pratima. ‚ÄúThe Black Aristocrat: Ourika, or, Comment Peut-on √ätre Noire?‚Äù In Colonialism, Race, and the French Romantic Imagination. 1st ed. Routledge, 2009. pg 100 The most famous of these is the novel Ourika by Claire de Duras. Duras's story is based on a few bare bones of historical facts, and was committed (reluctantly) to the page by Claire de Duras. She only did so to prevent any possible plagiarism , as she recounted the story‚Äîwith much acclaim‚Äîto those attending her salon in post-Revolutionary Paris. She was the close friend of Fran√ßois- Ren√© de Chateaubriand, whom she had met in exile in London, and who helped her in publishing this story among others . Summary The novel opens from the point of view of a doctor, who has been called to treat a dying young nun in a convent. This nun is a young black woman called Ourika, who is dying of \\"melancholia.\\" As an effort to cure her, he asks Ourika to tell him her story. Ourika begins by relating how she was \\"saved\\" from the slave trade as an infant by the governor of Senegal, and brought back to Paris as a gift for Madame de B. She is raised well, according to the standards for white Parisian girls of high society-she is taught to sing by the best voice coaches, instructed in painting by a famous artist, is well-read and is accomplished in many languages. Ourika also says that prior to a critical moment in her life at the age of twelve, she had no consciousness of her race or any other racial barriers: \\"I reached the age of twelve without it once occurring to me that there was a way of being happy beside mine. I didn't regret being black. I was told that I was an angel. There was nothing to warn me that the color of my skin might be a disadvantage.\\" Duras, Claire de. Ourika: An English Translation. Translated by John Fowles. MLA Texts and Translations. New York: Modern Language Association of America, 1994. p.9 In order to show off Ourika's talents, Mme de B. organizes a ball to show Ourika off, in which she dances as \\"Africa.\\" Ourika does well in her dance, but later overhears an earth-shattering conversation. A friend of Mme de B., an unnamed Marquise, declares that Mme de B. has done Ourika a disgrace by raising her above her station, which means that Ourika will now be forever unhappy. The Marquise announces, to Ourika's shock, ‚ÄúWhat kind of man would marry a Negress?\\"‚ÄùDuras, Claire de. Ourika: An English Translation. Translated by John Fowles. MLA Texts and Translations. New York: Modern Language Association of America, 1994. p. 13 Ourika is then struck by the realization of her skin color, and undergoes a psychological reaction akin to Frantz Fanon's account of racial awareness in Peau Noire, Masques Blancs (Black Skin, White Masks), which has been termed \\"racial melancholia\\", \\"whereby racial identification becomes a site of ongoing trauma that is supported by loss and compensation.\\".Adeline Koh, \\"The uses of racial melancholia in colonial education: Reading Ourika and Saleh: A Prince of Malaya as cautionary tales \\" Journal of Postcolonial Writing Volume 48, Issue 4, 2012 She begins to avoid mirrors, covering up her skin with gloves and hats, and begins to see her hands as \\"monkey's paws,\\" going so far as to say that \\"this skin color of mine seemed to me like the brand of shame.\\" \\" Ourika, MLA Fowles translation, pg 15-16 Ourika also falls in love with Charles, Madame de B.'s grandson. However, he does not realize she is in love with him, and ends up marrying a young heiress, Ana√Øs de Th√®mines, whose family have been killed by the French Revolutionaries. This drives her into depression, or \\"melancholy,\\" that is so deep that she almost dies. She finally ends up retreating to the convent, where the doctor meets her.

It is based in London. It previously owned the Hilton hotel brand outside the United States, and was known as Hilton Group plc from 1999 to 2006. In November 2016, Ladbrokes acquired Gala Coral Group, and changed its name to Ladbrokes Coral. The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange, and was a member of the FTSE 250 Index, until it was acquired by GVC Holdings in March 2018. History The company was founded by Messrs. Schwind and Pennington in 1886, as commission agents for horses trained at Ladbroke Hall in Warwickshire. The name Ladbrokes was adopted in 1902, when Arthur Bendir joined the partnership, and operations were moved to London. Ladbrokes' London offices were first in the vicinity of the Strand, moved to Hanover Square in 1906 and, in 1913, to Six Old Burlington Street, Mayfair. From 1913 to 1956, Ladbrokes' clientele was exclusively drawn from the British aristocracy and upper classes, many of whom were members of the elite gentlemen's clubs in the St James's area of Central London. Unusually for the times, Ladbrokes' principal longtime representative on British racecourses was a woman, Helen Vernet. Having joined the firm in 1919, she was made a partner in 1928 and remained with the firm until shortly before her death in 1956, at the age of 80. Following the end of World War II, Ladbrokes' fortunes were in steady decline, thanks to an austere postwar economic climate, a dwindling client base, and reluctance to change the firm's specialised approach to bookmaking. As a result, in 1956 the company was acquired by Mark Stein and his nephew Cyril Stein for a reported ¬£100,000. In 1961, the government legalised betting shops under the Betting and Gaming Act. As managing director, Stein used profits from the business's traditional areas to establish a chain of betting shops. The company first diversified outside of the betting business by taking a major stake in the Dragonara Palace in Malta, a casino and hotel, which opened its first phase in 1964. In 1967, Ladbrokes was floated on the London Stock Exchange. From 1967 to 1973, Ladbrokes' retail betting business grew from less than 50 shops to 1,135, and the company expanded its ventures to include bingo clubs, hotels under the Dragonara brand, casinos in London, holiday centres, and real estate investments. In 1975 Ladbrokes moved into racecourse management by purchasing Lingfield Park. This was followed by the acquisitions in 1976 of Perry Barr Stadium and Totalisators and Greyhound Holdings, which owned six greyhound racing stadia at Brough Park, Crayford & Bexleyheath, Leeds, Gosforth, Willenhall and Monmore. Arthur Aldridge, formerly of the Greyhound Racing Association, joined Ladbrokes as Racing Director. The company was rocked by scandal in 1979 with the exposure of illegal marketing schemes at its London casinos, including the bribery of a police officer to obtain information about high rollers at competing casinos. As a result, Ladbrokes was forced to close its four casinos in London, which accounted for roughly 40% of the company's profits. Ladbrokes acquired Texas Homecare, a chain of DIY stores, in 1986. In October 1987, it acquired Hilton International from Allegis Corporation for ¬£645 million, gaining 91 hotels and the rights to the Hilton brand outside of the United States. Ladbrokes acquired Vernons Football Pools in 1989. Stein retired in January 1994, under pressure from investors because of the company's rising debts and losses. Under new management, Ladbrokes focused on its core areas of hotels and gambling, and began to divest other parts of its business. Texas Homecare was sold to Sainsbury's in January 1995 for ¬£290 million. Ladbrokes' extensive portfolio of commercial and residential real estate, valued at ¬£1 billion in 1993, was sold off in pieces and by March 1997 was down to ¬£70 million. As part of its redoubled focus on gambling, Ladbrokes returned to casinos in September 1994, with a ¬£50 million purchase of three clubs in London, which it stated was the first step in building an international casino business. In September 1998 Ladbrokes purchased Coral, a chain of betting shops with 891 locations, from Bass plc for ¬£363 million. The UK Government, however, ordered Ladbrokes to sell Coral after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that the acquisition was anti-competitive. The Coral business, except for 59 shops in Ireland and Jersey, was sold in a management buyout financed by Morgan Grenfell Private Equity for ¬£390 million in February 1999. In March 1999, the company acquired Stakis Hotels for ¬£1.3 billion, gaining 53 hotels and 22 casinos. Later that year, Ladbrokes renamed itself as Hilton Group plc, to reflect its increasing focus on the hotel business, which had come to represent over 80 percent of the company's assets. In August 1999, Hilton Group decided to dispose of its gambling operations outside of Europe due to disappointing results. Most of the assets, including racetracks and casinos in the United States and bingo and betting businesses in South America, were sold by 2001. In addition, the company sold its twenty seven casinos in the United Kingdom to the Gala Group in December 2000 for ¬£236 million. In February 2006, the company sold its hotel operations to Hilton Hotels Corporation for ¬£3.5 billion, and once more rebranded itself as Ladbrokes plc. In March 2007, the Vernons brand was sold to Sportech. Following the introduction of the Gambling Act 2005 in the United Kingdom and the subsequent relaxation of advertising laws for gambling companies in 2007, a television campaign by Ladbrokes that included a host of ex professional footballers was the first to result in complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA); the ASA eventually cleared the campaign. The company once again came under fire from the ASA in January 2009, due to complaints relating to an advertising campaign. A Ladbrokes branch in Worthing (2010) Since 2007, Ladbrokes operated in Spain through the LBApuestas brand, but in April 2014 it terminated its licence for LBApuestas and created a website, Sportium, in a joint venture with the Spanish gaming and leisure operator Cirsa.Staff, Gaming Intelligence. 14 April 2014. Ladbrokes hands back LBApuestas licence to focus on JVStaff, Reuters. 2 April 2014.UK bookmaker Ladbrokes to open 70 Spanish shops The company entered the online betting market in Australia with its acquisition of Bookmaker.com.au for ¬£13 million in September 2013, followed by a purchase of Betstar for ¬£12 million in April 2014. In June 2015, Ladbrokes announced that they were in talks with the board of Gala Coral Group over a possible merger. The combination of the two companies created Britain's biggest bookmaker, with over 4,000 betting shops and 30,000 employees.Ladbrokes and Gala Coral merger to create ¬£2.3bn gambling giant The Guardian In July 2016, the Competition and Markets Authority identified 642 areas where the merger would harm local competition, and said 350 to 400 shops would need to be sold off for the merger to be approved. The merger was completed on 2 November 2016. To effect the merger, Ladbrokes acquired the Coral Group and then changed its name from Ladbrokes plc to Ladbrokes Coral Group plc. In December 2017, GVC Holdings agreed to buy Ladbrokes Coral in a deal that could be worth up to ¬£4 billion. In January 2018, Ladbrokes Coral and the Scottish Professional Football League agreed to extend the betting company's sponsorship agreement until at 2020. The deal saw the bookmaker remain the principal sponsor of the top four divisions of Scottish football in a deal worth up to ¬£5 million. In March 2018, Ladbrokes completed their omnichannel integration strategy with software provider Playtech, offering single account functionality for all its online, mobile and retail products in the United Kingdom. Also in March 2018, GVC Holdings completed its acquisition with GVC shareholders owning 53.5% and Ladbrokes Coral 46.5% of the combined company. In December 2018, Ladbrokes paid victims ¬£1 million in compensation after it was disclosed that a problem gambler had been stealing funds from his business clients to fund his habit. The payments were made on the condition that the victims did not report the operator to the UK Gambling Commission, the regulatory body in charge of monitoring all gambling in the United Kingdom. On 31 July 2019, the UK Gambling Commission announced that Ladbrokes Coral would pay ¬£5.9m for past failings in anti money laundering and social responsibility. An investigation found that the companies failed to put in place effective safeguards, to prevent consumers suffering gambling harm and against money laundering, between November 2014 and October 2017. On February 14, 2020, the Liquor and Gaming New South Wales regulatory agency imposed a fine of AUD207,500 on Ladbrokes Australia and another GVC Holdings brand, Neds, for offering illegal gambling inducements to residents in New South Wales. The regulator called it \\"the biggest ever fine of its kind\\" in NSW.

A lode is an artificial water channel used to drain the Fens, thought to be of Roman origin. Lode also has the smaller hamlet settlement of Long Meadow as part of the parish to the east along the B1102. Lode is a comparatively new civil parish, having been separated from Bottisham in 1894.Kelly's Directory of Cambridgeshire, 1929 Anglesey Abbey Lode is the location of Anglesey Abbey, which was formerly the home of the Fairhaven family, who lived there for many years, but is now the property of the National Trust. The 1st Baron Fairhaven (1896-1966) was responsible for the unique gardens in the grounds of the former 12th-century abbey. Also part of the estate is Lode Mill, a restored watermill that is open to the public. Church Parish church of St James In the 19th century, Anglesey Abbey was owned and occupied by Reverend Hailstone who was also vicar of Bottisham. Convinced that Lode merited its own church, he built the present church of St James, which was dedicated in 1853. The Hailstone family provided a vicar for the following 80 years. Village life Children initially attend Bottisham Community Primary school and usually then go on to Bottisham Village College. After this they can go on to one of the many Further Education Sixth form colleges, located in the nearby city of Cambridge.

The significant act is not without opposition. Historically, both patrons and other librarians criticize weeding books. Some believe libraries should keep all materials in circulation no matter the condition or need for room in the facility for newer material.Johnson, P. (2013). Is Weeding an Unnatural Act? Technicalities, 33(5), 2-4. The controversial nature of collection weeding necessitates the educating of library staff. It provides them with ‚Äúthe tools they need to counter common perceptions or misperceptions regarding weeding‚Äù, especially those encountered from faculty in an academic library. Educating the staff with workshops and presentations on collection quality, maintenance and the importance and positive benefits of weeding the collection are important components for a library to consider. According to the IFLA there are four primary reasons for a written collection development policy: selection, planning, public relations, and the wider context. A written selection guidelines provide staff with the tools to access and evaluate potential additional collection materials as well as basis for denying the acceptance of materials. Beyond the addition of new materials this section can also define the parameters for weeding materials, storage standards, and preservation of unstable collection objects. Secondly, planning aids in making decisions for future improvement in library infrastructure and proper distribution of funds for the institution. Thirdly, in the current environment of limited funding and competition between departments and agencies, a written collection policy aids in the library's public relations. This document can be a tool to help potential donors or funders assess the needs of the library, including assets and services. Lastly, in terms of the wider context, the document can aid in collaboration with other institutions in an effort to fulfill the needs of their patrons and community. Each institution will have a better understanding of the plans for each and how they can assist each other in achieving these goals.Guidelines for a Collection Development Policy Using the Conspectus Model  Collection evaluation methods  Some library evaluation methods include the checklists method, circulation and interlibrary loan statistics, citation analysis, network usage analysis, vendor-supplied statistics and faculty opinion. =Selection Vs. Censorship= When acquiring new materials for a library‚Äôs collection, it can be difficult to differentiate between selection and censorship. The American Library Association speaks of collections development as selecting materials that are desired by the community as well as fulfilling other educational and recreational criteria. The organization comments that a librarian should not purposely omit the purchase of books or other items due to them being controversial in nature, the author‚Äôs religious or political views, or the librarian‚Äôs personal beliefs. From the ALA website, they continue the argument by stating that, ‚ÄúLibraries should provide materials and information presenting all points of view on current and historical issues. Materials should not be proscribed or removed because of partisan or doctrinal disapproval.‚Äù American Library Association. (2014). Diversity in Collection Development. Retrieved From: http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=interpretations&Template;=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID;=8530 = Checklists method = This method of collection evaluation is the practice of checking a library collection against a list of notable books or materials to see if the collection includes these titles. This is the oldest method of collection evaluation, and its first recorded use occurs in 1849 by Charles Coffin Jewett at the Smithsonian Institution. = Citation analysis = Citation analysis is the method most used on the college and university level. This method looks at frequently used citations from bibliographies, indexes, and references to see if the resources used are included in the learning institute's partner library. The purpose is to see if the written work produced can be done using only the library located at the college or university. Citation analysis is a good research method to use in academic libraries on the university and college level when performing a collections evaluation. This method is performed by studying bibliographies from many sources such as student papers, faculty research publications, along with theses and dissertations. This information is then used to see what percentage of the items cited in the bibliographies have come from the academic library‚Äôs collection. Citation analysis is used to see if the work produced at the university or college has been written using sources mainly from the academic library at that learning institution. =Collections grid= The collections grid is a model to discuss items in a collection in terms of their uniqueness, and the amount of care or stewardship they attract. For example, rare books and local history materials are held in few libraries and attract much care as the jewels of a collection, whereas books and DVDs are held in many libraries and don't attract as much care. =Data analysis= Open source data analysis tools like Unpaywall Journals allow to collate various sources of data and assumptions to simplify the selection of the most effective set of electronic resources for the goals of a library.

William's grandson Richard, the fifth Viscount, represented Fowey in the British Parliament. His son Richard, the sixth Viscount, was a member of both the Irish and English Privy Councils. The seventh Viscount was a benefactor and musical antiquarian. The titles became extinct on the death of the ninth Viscount in 1833. The family seat was Mount Merrion House, County Dublin: they also owned Baggotrath Castle and Merrion Castle, both of which have long since disappeared. The Viscounts FitzWilliam had no direct relationship with the Earls FitzWilliam. They are recorded in Ireland from the beginning of the thirteenth century, and through acquisition of large estates in Dublin, became within a few generations one of its dominant families.

The Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia, abbreviated as BHS or rarely BH4, is an edition of the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible as preserved in the Leningrad Codex, and supplemented by masoretic and text-critical notes. It is the fourth edition in the Biblia Hebraica series started by Rudolf Kittel and is published by the Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft (German Bible Society) in Stuttgart. Publishing history BHS is a revision of the third edition of the Biblia Hebraica, edited by Paul Kahle, the first printed Bible based on the Leningrad Codex. The footnotes are completely revised. It originally appeared in installments, from 1968 to 1976, with the first one-volume edition in 1977; it has been reprinted many times since. The fifth reprint of the BHS was revised and redistributed in 1997. Work is currently under way at the Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft to produce a completely reworked and expanded edition in 20 volumes, known as the Biblia Hebraica Quinta or Fifth Hebrew Bible, which also includes references to and comparisons with recently released material from Qumran texts. Initial volumes of the Bible Hebraica Quinta have been available for sale since 2004. Completion of the project is intended by 2020.

Weil. He also released the book Massorah Gedolah iuxta codicem Leningradensem B 19a at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in 1971, which is the very first Edition of the Masora Magna, what gives an idea of his unique expertise in relation to the Masora. A print edition of the Leningrad Codex Like many Hebrew Bible print editions the BHS omits the Rafe diacritic consistently (\\"\\" from Cant ). The Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia is meant to be an exact copy of the Masoretic Text as recorded in the Leningrad Codex. According to the introductory prolegomena of the book, the editors have \\"accordingly refrained from removing obvious scribal errors\\"Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia, 1997, page xii (these have then been noted in the critical apparatus). Diacritics like the Silluq and Meteg which were missing in the Leningrad Codex also have not been added. The only exception to that is the Rafe diacritic which has been consistently omitted in the BHS due to \\"almost insuperable technical difficulties\\" with its implementation in the typeface. This is not untypical, since almost every Hebrew Bible print edition, starting with Jacob ben Chayyim's Bombergiana omits the diacritic (because of its minor importance; it serves as a pronunciation help and is partially redundant due to the Dagesh diacritic, the \\"opposite of the Rafe\\"). Like its predecessor the Biblia Hebraica Kittel the BHS adds the letters samekh \\"◊°\\" (for ◊°◊™◊ï◊û◊î, setumah: \\"closed portion\\") and \\"◊§\\" (for ◊§◊™◊ï◊ó◊î, petuchah: \\"open portion\\") into the text to indicate blank spaces in the Leningrad Codex, which divide the text into sections. One more difference to the Leningrad Codex is the book order, the Books of Chronicles have been moved to the end as it appears in common Hebrew bibles, even though it precedes Psalms in the codex. Contents The BHS is composed of the three traditional divisions of the Hebrew Scriptures: the Torah (◊™◊ï◊®◊î \\"instruction\\"), Neviim (◊†◊ë◊ê◊ô◊ù \\"prophets\\"), and the Ketuvim (◊õ◊™◊ë◊ô◊ù \\"writings\\"). In the margins are Masoretic notes. These are based on the codex, but have been heavily edited to make them more consistent and easier to understand. Even so, whole books have been written to explain these notes themselves. Some of the notes are marked sub loco (\\"in this place\\"), meaning that there appears to be some problem, often that they contradict the text. The editors never published any explanation of what the problems were, or how they might be resolved. The sub loco notes do not necessarily explain interesting text variants; they are, in the vast majority, only notes on inaccurate word countings/frequencies. See Daniel S. Mynatt, The Sub Loco Notes in the Torah of Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (Bibal, 1994); Christopher Dost, The Sub-Loco Notes in the Torah of Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (Gorgias, 2016). Footnotes record possible corrections to the Hebrew text. Many are based on the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Dead Sea Scrolls and on early Bible translations (\\"versions\\") such as the Septuagint, Vulgate and Peshitta. Others are conjectural emendations. Book order The order of the biblical books generally follows the codex, even for the Ketuvim, where that order differs from most common printed Hebrew bibles. Thus the Book of Job comes after Psalms and before Proverbs, and the Megillot are in the order Ruth, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations and Esther. The only difference is with Chronicles.

This edition features the same Hebrew text as the regular BHS, but without the Masora on the side margins and with a \\"Lexical and Grammatical Apparatus\\" on the bottom of the page replacing the critical apparatus of the BHS. It was done as a six-year project by Donald R. Vance (Oral Roberts University), George Athas (Moore Theological College) and Yael Avrahami (Oranim Academic College). The edition defines an English translation to every word in the text: words that occur 70 times or more are listed in a glossary in the back of the book, and words that occur fewer than 70 times are listed in the apparatus. The translations were mostly taken out of the Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament, but also from DCH and the Brown‚ÄìDriver‚ÄìBriggs. Alongside with the translations it features a grammatical parsing of the words encoded in a system of abbreviations (e.g. an introductory example in the book states that the word \\"◊ï◊î◊ß◊®◊ô◊ë◊ï\\" from has the note \\"Hr10s0 ◊ß◊®◊ë\\" in the apparatus which means that the word is a \\"Hiphil suffix conjugation third masculine singular verb with a wƒÅv retentive and a third masculine singular pronominal suffix of the root ◊ß◊®◊ë\\").Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia: A Reader's Edition, 2014, page xiii It also has a 50-page appendix listing paradigm-tables for strong and weak verbal roots and noun suffixes. The BHS Reader follows a tradition of \\"reader's editions\\" of Bibles in the original languages. In March 2008 Zondervan published a similar edition done by A. Philip Brown II and Bryan W. Smith from Bob Jones University called A Reader's Hebrew Bible which is based on Westminster Leningrad Codex 4.10, virtually identical to the BHS. Their translations in the apparatus are based on the same dictionaries (with a threshold of 100 occurrences for glossary or apparatus translations instead of 70 in the BHS Reader) and a simpler parsing system.  Criticism  The bible scholar Emanuel Tov has criticised BHS somewhat for having errors, and for correcting errors in later editions without informing the reader.He states: \\"The edition of Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (BHS) originally appeared in fascicles which were corrected in the final printing, which carried the date 1967-1977. It was corrected again in the 1984 printing, yet even this printing contains mistakes\\".

He is the father of actor Timothy Hutton. Early life  Hutton was born in Binghamton, New York, the son of Helen and Thomas R. Hutton, an editor and managing editor of the Binghamton Press. Hutton's parents divorced while he was an infant, and he never knew his father. Hutton was expelled from five high schools due to behavior problems but had excellent grades and test scores. After starting his school newspaper's sports column, he earned a scholarship in journalism from Syracuse University in 1952. He was expelled from Syracuse after driving a bulldozer through a bed of tulips. Hutton then enrolled at Niagara University, where he began pursuing an acting career. He performed in summer stock in Connecticut and La Jolla, and won state oratory competitions. In 1955 he moved to New York where he became, in his own words, a \\"beatnik\\". He struggled to find acting work, and worried about being able to eat, he joined the US Army. Military service Hutton served in the United States Army from 1956 and starred in over forty Army training films before going to Berlin to serve in special services. Hutton personally founded the American Community Theater by spearheading the renovation of theaters abandoned during World War II. He established the first English-speaking theater in Berlin. \\"They turned out to be the kickiest two years of my life\\", he later said. Hutton was performing in live theater in Germany, playing Captain Queeg in a production of The Caine Mutiny Court Martial, while with the United States Army when he was spotted by American film director Douglas Sirk. Sirk offered him in a small role in a film, A Time to Love and a Time to Die (1958), if he could get leave to join the unit in Nuremberg. Hutton made his debut in the film as a neurotic Nazi who commits suicide. Universal saw footage and expressed interest in offering him a long-term contract. While in Germany, Hutton also had a small role in Ten Seconds to Hell (1959). When Hutton got out of the Army, he moved to Hollywood but discovered the offer from Universal had expired. However he got an agent and started doing auditions. Acting =Early television roles= Hutton's first notable screen appearance was in the episode \\"And When the Sky Was Opened\\" of The Twilight Zone (1959), in which he co-starred with Rod Taylor. He also guest starred on episodes of Father Knows Best and Tate. In 1959 he appeared on stage at the La Jolla Playhouse in Look Homeward Angel alongside Miriam Hopkins. =Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer= Hutton auditioned for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer executives Al Tresconi and Ben Thau. They were impressed enough to offer him a long-term contract. \\"But after that they didn't seem to know what to do with me\\", he said. \\"I don't fall easily into a mold and they tried different things.\\" MGM put him in The Subterraneans (1960), a drama about beatniks. The film was a big flop, but Hutton was then cast in a teen comedy for the same studio, Where the Boys Are (1960), where he appeared alongside a number of young players under contract to the studio, including George Hamilton, Connie Francis, Yvette Mimieux and Paula Prentiss. The movie was a huge success. Due to his tall, gangly frame and the absent-minded quality of his delivery, Hutton was viewed as a successor to James Stewart. Hutton was romantically teamed in the film with Prentiss, in part because they were the tallest MGM contract players of their time (Hutton at 6'5\\" and Prentiss at 5'10\\"), and, public feedback being positive, MGM decided to make them a regular team, along the lines of William Powell and Myrna Loy. Hutton appeared with Prentiss in The Honeymoon Machine (1960) supporting Steve McQueen, which was a hit. Then they made Bachelor in Paradise (1961) starring Bob Hope and Lana Turner, which lost money. Hutton and Prentiss were given top billing in The Horizontal Lieutenant (1962), which was a box office disappointment. \\"We're not being thrown into films together to play the same parts\\", said Hutton. \\"Paula and I have spent too much time and money on our careers and if teaming together happens to go hand and glove with advancing our careers then fine.\\" Hutton and Prentiss were announced for Away from Home to be shot in Mexico by producer Edmund Grainer but the film appears to have not been made. Neither was another announced for them, And So To Bed, to be written and directed by Frank Tashlin. Hutton was meant to play a role in How the West Was Won (1962), a soldier who tries to desert and fights with George Peppard. However Russ Tamblyn ended up playing the role. In February 1962 he and Prentiss made exhibitors list of the top ten \\"stars of tomorrow\\" alongside Hayley Mills, Nancy Kwan, Horst Bucholz, Carol Lynley, Dolores Hart, Juliet Prowse, Connie Stevens and Warren Beatty. MGM tried Hutton in a comedy-drama with Jane Fonda, Period of Adjustment (1962), directed by George Roy Hill. It was a hit at the box office. MGM announced they would re-team him with Prentiss in Follow the Boys but he was not in the final film; Prentiss' love interest was played by Russ Tamblyn. He did some stage acting at the La Jolla Playhouse in Write Me a Murder in 1962. He was Connie Francis's leading man in Looking for Love (1964) (in which George Hamilton, Mimieux and Prentiss had cameos). The movie was not a success. He was going to be Sandra Dee's leading man in The Richest Girl in Town but was replaced by Andy Williams for the final film, which became I'd Rather Be Rich. =Columbia= Hutton was tired of playing in comedies. In the words of Hedda Hopper, he turned down \\"one script after another\\" from MGM for fifteen months before the studio eventually released him from his contract. He signed a one-year contract with Universal and received an offer to make a Western at Columbia, Major Dundee. Dundee was directed by Sam Peckinpah and Hutton played the third lead after Charlton Heston and Richard Harris, an ineffective officer. Filming took place in Mexico. He followed it with another expensive Western, The Hallelujah Trail (1965) with Burt Lancaster, directed by John Sturges for United Artists. Both films were financial disappointments, although Dundee's reputation has risen in recent years. Hutton was the male juvenile in Never Too Late (1965) with Paul Ford and Connie Stevens, at Warner Bros. \\"The Major Dundee and Hallelujah Trail parts were good\\", he said in an interview around this time, \\"but they were peripheral. I'm ready for a take charge part. In all immodesty I don't believe there are many guys my age who can play comedy. Jack Lemmon is the master but who among the younger guys can you think of? A lot of them can clown and laugh at their own jokes.\\" Hutton made a pilot for a sitcom about a travelling salesman, Barney, written and directed by Shelley Berman for Screen Gems. However it was not picked up. Hutton made a cameo in The Trouble with Angels. He was the second male lead in Walk, Don't Run (1966), a comedy with Samantha Eggar and Cary Grant (in Grant's last feature-film appearance) at Columbia. Director Charles Walters says Hutton was Grant's personal choice for the role. \\"Cary identifies with Hutton\\", he said. The success of this film saw Hutton given the lead in Columbia's comedy Who's Minding the Mint? (1967) but it was not widely seen. He was announced for the lead in A Guide for the Married Man but when the script changed he ended up asking to be released from it. In November 1966 Hutton signed a non-exclusive two-year deal with 20th Century Fox. However, he did not appear in any Fox films. =John Wayne= In July 1967 Hutton signed to appear in the John Wayne war drama, The Green Berets, in which Hutton played a Special Forces sergeant in a mix of comedy and drama, with a memorable booby trap death scene. Also in 1968, Hutton appeared with John Wayne in Hellfighters, playing the role of Greg Parker. The movie was loosely based on the career of oil-well firefighter Red Adair. =Return to television= In the early 1970s, Hutton began working almost exclusively in television, guest starring on such shows as The Psychiatrist, Love, American Style (several times) and The Name of the Game. He was in two TV movies, the thriller The Deadly Hunt (1971) and a war film The Reluctant Heroes of Hill 656 (1971). Hutton played Erle Stanley Gardner's small-town district attorney hero, Doug Selby, in They Call It Murder (1971), a TV movie that was a pilot for a proposed series that never eventuated. He co-starred with Connie Stevens in Call Her Mom (1972), a TV movie that was a pilot for a series that was not picked up. He and tried three failed sitcom pilots, Wednesday Night Out, Call Holme, and Captain Newman, M.D. (the latter, written by Richard Crenna, screened as a TV movie). He starred in Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (1974) and The Underground Man (1974) and episodes of Marcus Welby, M.D., The Wide World of Mystery, and Ironside. His last theatrical film was Psychic Killer (1975) directed by Ray Danton. \\"Much of my career downfall was my own fault\\", he said around this time. =Ellery Queen= Hutton had not auditioned since Period of Adjustment but agreed to do it for the role of fictional amateur detective Ellery Queen in the 1975 made-for-television movie and 1975‚Äì1976 television series, Ellery Queen. Hutton's co-star in the series (set in 1946‚Äì1947 New York City) was David Wayne, who portrayed his widowed father, an NYPD homicide detective. Ellery, a writer of murder mysteries, assisted his father as an amateur, each week solving an \\"actual\\" murder case. Near the end of each story before revealing the solution, he would \\"break the fourth wall\\" by giving the audience a brief review of the clues and asking if they had solved the mystery. \\"It's the first opportunity I've had in a long time to show people I can give a good performance\\", he said. It ran for 23 episodes. One of Hutton's memorable television appearances was appearing as a guest star in the 1977‚Äì1978 third-season premiere of the Norman Lear sitcom One Day At A Time. The episode, titled \\"The Older Man\\", was a four-part story arc in which Hutton portrayed Dr. Paul Curran, a forty-two year old veterinarian who falls in love with seventeen-year old Julie Cooper (played by Mackenzie Phillips). =Final years= Hutton's final performances included roles in Flying High, $weepstake$, and The Wonderful World of Disney (\\"The Sky Trap\\"). His last television role was in an unsold pilot called Butterflies, based on the BBC2 sitcom of the same name. It was broadcast on NBC in August 1979 about two months after Hutton had died. Personal life Hutton was married to Maryline Adams (n√©e Poole), who was a teacher. They divorced in 1963. They had two children: a daughter, Heidi (born 1959), and a son, Timothy (born 1960). Timothy also became an actor and appeared with his father in a summer stock production of Harvey. In 1970, he married Lynni Solomon, and they had daughter Punch Hutton (former deputy fashion editor of Vanity Fair). Hutton also had an intermittent 15-year relationship with actress and model Yvette Vickers. Death On June 2, 1979, Hutton died of liver cancer, just two days after his 45th birthday. He died four weeks and one day after being diagnosed. Two years later, Hutton's son Timothy dedicated his 1981 Academy Award, which he had won for his role for the film Ordinary People, to his father.Timothy Hutton Oscar acceptance speech Filmography *A Time to Love and a Time to Die (1958) ‚Äî Hirschland *Ten Seconds to Hell (1959) ‚Äî Workman at Bomb Site (uncredited) *The Subterraneans (1960) ‚Äî Adam Moorad *Where the Boys Are (1960) ‚Äî TV Thompson *The Honeymoon Machine (1961) ‚Äî Jason Eldridge *Bachelor in Paradise (1961) ‚Äî Larry Delavane *The Horizontal Lieutenant (1962) ‚Äî Second Lt.

The goal of their faith is the reconciliation of mankind with God and the union with Jesus Christ at his return. They want to spread and promote the Christian faith on the basis of the Holy Scripture. Organization In 1956 eight apostles who have been excommunicated from the New Apostolic Church on various occasions gathered in D√ºsseldorf, Germany and founded the \\"Association of Apostles of the Apostolic Churches\\" which later became synonym with the \\"United Apostolic Church\\". Five more apostles from the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and overseas joined the union also in 1956. In fact this association has no own juridical structure and is only an association of the church leaders and not of the churches themselves. Currently the apostles of nine churches are members of the association: * Apostolic Church of Queensland (Australia) ** United Apostolic Church (India) ** United Apostolic Church (Philippines) ** United Apostolic Church (Pakistan) ** Unity Apostles Church (Kenya) ** Unity Apostles Church (New Zealand) * Apostolic Church of South Africa - Apostle Unity (South-Africa) * Apostolische Gemeinschaft (Germany) * Gemeente van Apostolische Christenen (Netherlands) * Igreja Evang√©lica Apost√≥lica (Brazil) * Union des Chr√©tiens Apostoliques (France) * Vereinigung Apostolischer Christen (Switzerland) Since 1994 the Apostolische Gemeinschaft in Germany incorporates also the Reformiert-Apostolischer Gemeindebund of the former German Democratic Republic. The United Apostolic Churches are currently led by eleven apostles: * Apostle Gro√ü, Knauth, Lieberth, Loose - Germany * (Bishop Bert Wolthuis) - Netherlands * Apostle Schaeffer - France * Apostle Baltisberger - Switzerland * Apostle JP Erasmus, PJ Erasmus, J Slabbert - South Africa * Apostle Flor and Dargusch - Australia From 1 June 2007 on Ap. Schaeffer from France is also spiritually responsible for the German congregations in the Saarland, however they still belong to the German organisation. Small congregations in S√£o Paulo, Brazil; Los Angeles, USA and Buenos Aires, Argentina do not exist any more. The Philippine congregations were founded and are administered by the Australian apostles. In London, Great Britain a new congregation of immigrated South Africans has been founded recently. After the sudden death of Apostle Vanathaian of India in 2005 these congregations were closed and the members were asked to join other Christian denominations. From 2010 on the Australian church took over the administrative structure and the remaining people and restarted the mission work. From Australia on also mission work is done on the Philippines, in Pakistan, Kenya, Myanmar and Canada. The European member churches are very close in theological and organizational matters. There are more or less loose contacts as well as theological differences to the churches in Australia and South Africa. History =Roots= The history of the denomination starts with a revival movement at the beginning of the 19th century. London banker and member of parliament Henry Drummond. In 1826 he invited about 30 clergymen and laymen for a prophetic conference at Albury Park, to discuss interpretations of prophecies concerning the apocalypse, with prayer and Bible study. This group also contacted Christians in Scotland, where it was reported that people had experienced prophecy, speaking in tongues and miraculous healing. The focus of these revelations was the imminent return of Jesus Christ. When some members of this Albury circle were excommunicated from their churches, they gathered in new congregations which were later called the Catholic Apostolic Church. They believed in the imminence of the Second Coming of Christ, in preparation for which they resolved to re-establish the early-Church offices of apostles, prophets, etc. Besides enthusiasm, the new congregations looked for order, too. Through the prophecy of members, apostles were called forth and, after further callings, some men were sent to various ministries. The first \\"apostle\\" (J. B. Cardale) was called in 1832. He became the principal liturgist and \\"Pillar of Apostles\\". In 1833 Henry Drummond became the second \\"apostles\\", and was later assigned responsibility for Scotland and Switzerland. Within two years the church's prophets called forth 12 apostles, equivalent to the original 12 apostles of the New Testament. The full college of 12 held their first council in 1835. During 1837 and 1838, they undertook missionary journeys to mainland Europe, Canada, and the United States. The new apostles set up a liturgy for their congregations. Their first aim was not the foundation of new congregations but to fight for the unity of all denominations which form the one and only church. Because of excommunications from the established churches, however, new congregations were founded in several countries. In 1836 the apostles wrote a manifest, called the Testimonium, to all church and state leaders of the Christian countries. Schisms From 1855 onwards the first apostles died and it was decided that no further apostles should be called and ordained. This decision was controversial and the German prophet Geyer called a new apostle in 1863. This was not recognized by the leaders of the Catholic-Apostolic Church and led to the excommunication of Geyer and the congregation of Hamburg, Germany. Now, new churches developed in the Netherlands which were called the Hersteld Apostolische Zendingkerk and Allgemeine christlich-apostolische Mission in Germany, from whom the New Apostolic Church evolved since 1907. The latter formed a central ruling ministry in form of the Chief Apostle. Parallel to the progress of the new apostolic denomination there occurred splittings throughout the world on several occasions. The reasons for these splittings were different but mainly related with the central ministry of the Chief Apostle and its claim for supremacy. The ministry of a Chief Apostle cannot be proved by the Bible as well as no other church leader can derive his absolute power from the special position of Peter among the disciples. The new apostolic Chief Apostle Niehaus was led more and more by emotions, dreams and visions after 1914. The Saxon Apostle Brueckner became the solicitor for all those who criticized the spiritual views of the Chief Apostle and the worshipping of his person. The different opinions led to the exclusion of Apostle Brueckner and some thousand believers in 1921. The excluded founded the Reformiert-Apostolischen Gemeindebund soon. The main reason for the great divisions of the New Apostolic Church (NAC) in Switzerland 1954 and West- Germany 1955 was the new teaching in 1951 of the then-reigning Chief Apostle J.G. Bischoff. This teaching presumed that he would not die before Jesus Christ returns and takes the predestined into His kingdom (First Resurrection). In 1954 this teaching became an official dogma. Those ministers, especially the apostles, who did not preach this message lost their offices and were excluded from the New Apostolic Church. In these times about 20.000 members left the church only in Germany; some were expressively excluded, while others left voluntarily. This was about 5-10% of the total NAC membership at this time. Not all of these people joined the UAC churches but lost faith completely or went to other churches. Chief Apostle Bischoff died in 1960, his prophecy unfulfilled. There has been no rehabilitation of the excommunicated ministers to this day, although there were first steps of reconciliation in Switzerland in 2005. Teaching In the 1950s and early 1960s the teaching and the belief was mainly that of the New Apostolic Church. Starting in the 1970s the member churches of the United Apostolic Church made important new orientations and reforms in structural and in theological questions, respectively concerning the question of church, sacraments and ministries. They tried returning to the roots of the Catholic-Apostolic Church. The first sort of catechism of 1956 was completely revised and in 1984 and 1991 a new catechism \\"Book of Faith\\" was edited in 2 editions. The parts concerning the sacraments have been updated in July 2005. Also the creed has been changed then again. From 1956 to 1984 a modified new-apostolic creed with 9 articles has been in use. Then it was shortened to six articles and actually the ecumenical version of the Apostles' Creed is in use, without any specific denominational amendments. =Nature of the Church= The members of the United Apostolic Church (UAC) consider themselves as a part of the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. Membership is acquired with baptism and on the Holy Sealing. Baptism of other churches is fully recognized as well as the apostolic baptism is normally recognized as it has been procured in the name of trinity. The European members of the church are highly involved in ecumenical cooperation and try to join ecumenical organisations and institutions locally and regionally. =Understanding of the Apostle's ministry= The word \\"apostolic\\" refers to the sending from Jesus Christ, as the word \\"apostle\\" comes from the Greek ap√≥stolos, which means \\"one sent with a message.\\" As one should not understand the word \\"Catholic\\" (universal) only in a denominational sense, so it is with the word \\"apostolic\\" (sent). Jesus Christ sent his disciples into the world to preach his gospel. \\"Apostolic\\" does not mean separation from other denominations, but correlation with the teaching of the apostles (see gospel, Acts of the Apostles). The United Apostolic Church recognizes the ministry of apostle as highest authority of responsibility and teaching. It is not considered as necessary for salvation. This unusual title in free churches does not intend any thinking of exclusivity but only describes a service ordained by Christ. It is not understood as only existing in the own church but potentially everywhere in the church of Christ even if this specific title is not used. All other ministries are supposed to be ordained by Christ directly and do not depend on the apostle's office. The general priesthood of all believers is becoming more and more popular. Besides the apostles there are bishops, elders, pastors, evangelists, priests and deacons. In 2003 the European apostles decided on female ordination and in 2004 the first three female deacons were ordained in Germany. Actually there are ten female deacons working in Germany. The one in the Netherlands has been ordained as first female priest within die UAC on July, 29th by apostle Den Haan. On March 1, 2009 the first German female priest was ordained in Bocholt by apostle Gro√ü. On August, 30th apostle Den Haan ordained the priest Ineke Ras as herder and leader of den Enkhuizen congregation in the Netherlands and meanwhile there are also two female priests working in Germany. =Sacraments= The United Apostolic Church knows and celebrates three sacraments: baptism, sealing and communion. These three are considered as different images of the one godly salvation. Baptism is the rite of initiation and the participation in the church of Christ. It is considered as rebirth with water and spirit. It is conducted with floating water and children can be baptized on the faith of their parents. Communion is celebrated in a commemorative sense and as salvation from sin and reconciliation with God. Sealing is the celebration of the Holy Spirit which came into the world on Pentecost. Through this spirit man is able to recognize Christ as his saviour and to grow in faith. It is not conducted on children before their confirmation at the age of 14 anymore. And - as a novelty among apostolic churches - it is not necessarily bound to the office of the apostle. A monthly magazine, called The Herald is published since 1954, first of the Swiss Vereinigung Apostolischer Christen, nowadays the editorial is with the Apostolische Gemeinschaft in D√ºsseldorf, Germany. There has been an online version available. From January 2010 on the \\"Herald\\" is not published any more and a new, coloured, bigger magazine called \\"Blickpunkt\\" is edited every two months.

It is the busiest shipping company of its kind in Northern Europe and one of the busiest in Europe. The company's name is an abbreviation of Det Forenede Dampskibs-Selskab (literally The United Steamship Company). DFDS was founded in 1866, when C.F. Tietgen merged the three biggest Danish steamship companies of that day. Although DFDS has generally concentrated on freight and passenger traffic on the North Sea and to the Baltic Sea, it has also operated freight services to the US, South America and the Mediterranean in the past. Since the 1980s, DFDS' focus for shipping has been northern Europe. Today, DFDS operates a network of 25 routes with 50 freight and passenger ships in the North Sea, Baltic Sea and the English Channel under the name DFDS Seaways. The rail and land based haulage and container activities are operated by DFDS Logistics. History The Beginnings Det Forenede Dampskibs-Selskab was formed on 11 December 1866 as a merger of the three biggest Danish steamship companies under the leadership of Danish financier Carl Frederik Tietgen. Operations began on 1 January 1867 with 19 ships with Copenhagen as the main starting point. The company's routes at the time were from Denmark to Norway, the Baltic, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Iceland and The Faeroe Islands, with ships carrying both freight and passengers. As the company grew, new connections were opened to Sweden, France, the Mediterranean and Black Sea, as well as North America and South America. In addition, DFDS operated various domestic services in Denmark. After continued expansion of the fleet in the 1880s, DFDS became one of the world's ten largest ship-owning companies. After the takeover of Dampskibsselskabet Thingvalla in 1898, the Scandinavian-American Line was established. The Scandinavian-American Line continued trading to the United States until 1935. The Two World Wars The First World War took a heavy toll on DFDS' fleet, with 26 ships lost. During the post-war depression, a further 30 ships were laid up. The company revived with the establishment of new routes, and by the mid-1920s, DFDS's fleet consisted of 124 ships with a combined tonnage of . The Second World War saw further losses to the company, with nine ships lost before the German invasion of Denmark in April 1940. A large number of DFDS ships fell into British hands after the German invasion, and they were used as troopships. German forces commandeered a total of 21 DFDS ships during the war. One DFDS ship, the Kronprins Frederik, was under construction when the war began. To prevent her usage by the Germans, vital engine parts were \\"lost\\", only to be discovered after the end of the war. In total, DFDS lost 31 ships during World War II, with a further three ships lost due to hitting mines after the end of the war. In 1948, 48 people drowned when KJ√òBENHAVN hit a mine. Five people lost their lives in the mine explosion of IVAR in 1949 and, as recently as 1950, FRIGGA sank, without loss of life, after having hit a mine. To replace some of the lost ships, a number of almost-completed motor ships, which had been laid up awaiting the end of the war, were made ready. Gradually, the routes that had been discontinued since the beginning of the war, were reopened. Between the Wars DFDS created a sensation when they launched the World's first motor- driven short-sea passenger ship in 1925, from the Elsinore Shipbuilding & Engineering Co. The first of four sister vessels built between 1925 and 1932, the m.v.\\"Parkeston\\" ( ) made her maiden voyage from Esbjerg to Harwich on 8 October 1925 at an average speed of 16.5 knots, burning 18 tons of oil per day compared with 55 tons of coal burnt by a similar predecessor on the route.Greenway, Ambrose (1986); A Century of North Sea Passenger Steamers ; Page 115 : Shepperton, Ian Allan ; . The Fifties & Sixties In 1950, DFDS was one of the first to introduce a door-to-door solution. Two ships were specially designed to transport small wooden containers. DFDS commenced a new service, linking Danish mainland to Greenland. This was discontinued in 1959. In 1957, Nordana Line - cargo service Gulf of Mexico-Mediterranean - began. For the first time in DFDS's history, the company played the role of cross- trader. 1964 saw the introduction of the first ro-ro passenger ferry, when M.S. England entered service on a route connecting Esbjerg to Harwich. In 1965, the Transport Rationalization Department, which later became DFDS Transport, began its activities. M.S. AKERSHUS, the first real passenger-and- car ship which could also take trucks and trailers, was entered into service on the Frederikshavn-Oslo route. In 1966, a hundred years after its start, the DFDS fleet consisted of 13 passenger ships, 53 cargo vessels, 4 tugboats and 39 barges. A comprehensive new ship programme commenced, with 25 ships on order. The passenger ships served on routes connecting Denmark to Norway, the UK, Faroe Islands, Iceland and Finland (though the Finland service was discontinued in 1966) alongside domestic services. The freight services continued, linking Denmark to the Americas and various European and Mediterranean ports. BOTNIA, the last steamship, was sold after more than 50 years of service. DFDS was no longer a steamship company. Between 1967 and 1970, four identical car-passenger ferries, originally named m.s. Kong Olav V, m.s. Prinsesse Margarethe, m.s. Aalborghus and m.s. Trekroner entered service on the Copenhagen‚ÄîOslo and Copenhagen‚ÄîAalborg routes. However, the Copenhagen‚ÄîAalborg service was closed that same year, in 1970. The Seventies & Eighties Subsequently, the Aalborghus and Trekroner were rebuilt and renamed Dana Sirena and Dana Corona, respectively, for ferry services on the Mediterranean. Confusingly, the ships' names were later reversed, with Dana Sirena becoming Dana Corona and vice versa. For the Denmark‚ÄîUK service, new ships arrived in 1974 and 1978 in the form of and , respectively. Domestic passenger traffic was discontinued in 1970 and domestic freight service in 1971. A great chapter in the history of DFDS had come to an end. The requirement for transport of cars was sharply on the rise at the beginning of the 1970s. Tonnage was designed to accommodate this, and all DFDS passenger routes were served by passenger ships with roll on/roll off facilities. The 1980s saw period of growth for DFDS, with the acquisition of Tor Line and Prinzenlinien. In addition to the ferries Tor Britannia, Tor Scandinavia and MS Prinz Hamlet that were acquired with these two deals, DFDS also purchased the Effoa ferry Wellamo in 1981, renaming her Dana Gloria. Following this brief expansion, in 1982, the Mediterranean ferry services were discontinued and in 1984 DFDS gave up its deep-sea cargo routes completely, now concentrating solely on the European market. 1982 also saw the beginning of an ambitious project of operating a large ferry/cruise ship, MS Scandinavia, on the US East Coast under the brand of Scandinavian World Cruises. However, in 1983, the Scandinavia was moved to the Copenhagen‚ÄîOslo service and sold two years later. From 1982 to 1983, DFDS's passenger operations were branded as DFDS Danish Seaways (Esbjerg‚ÄîHarwich/Newcastle upon Tyne/T√≥rshavn, Copenhagen‚ÄîOslo, Newcastle upon Tyne‚ÄîOslo), DFDS Tor Line (Gothenburg‚ÄîHarwich/Newcastle upon Tyne/Amsterdam) and DFDS Prins Ferries (Harwich‚ÄîHamburg/Bremerhaven). DFDS also operated the Fred. Olsen Bergen Line routes Newcastle upon Tyne‚ÄîStavanger/Bergen and Stavanger‚ÄîAmsterdam.. In 1987, the Transport Division and the Liner Division merged into DFDS Transport. The new division soon expanded, first in Sweden and subsequently acquired several forwarding companies, e.g. in the UK and the Netherlands. In 1988, it was decided to use Scandinavian Seaways for the DFDS passenger operations as a whole. The Nineties In 1989-1990, the tonnage on the Oslo‚ÄîCopenhagen route was renewed with the entering into service in June 1990 of Queen Of Scandinavia, a ship with a capacity of 2,000 passengers and 400 cars. Queen was followed, in 1994, by Crown Of Scandinavia, with a similar capacity. In 1999, DFDS took over Dan Transport Holding, including the Dan Transport Travel Bureau and Canal Tours Copenhagen. However, 17 months later, the whole transport division, named DFDS Dan Transport Group, was sold to transport group DSV, and the focus was once again on the former core business activities: ro-ro liner traffic and passenger shipping on overnight routes. As of 2000 In June 2001, the deal to acquire a 76.4 per cent shareholding in the Lithuanian shipping company LISCO was finalised. Lys-Line Rederi AS and Lys-Line AS were taken over 100 per cent by DFDS in 2005. In August 2005 DFDS purchased 66 per cent of the trailer-forwarding company Hall√©ns in Belgium. In 2006, DFDS acquired the container shipping company Norfolk Line Containers. In 2010, DFDS purchased Norfolkline from Maersk. In 2010, DFDS sold DFDS Canal Tours because it was not regarded as a core activity. Current operations DFDS Seaways is the shipping division of DFDS A/S operating a network of 25 shipping routes with 50 freight and passenger ships on the North Sea, Baltic Sea and the English Channel. DFDS Logistics operates land transport and logistics activities including the former DFDS Lys Line and DFDS Container Line. Below is an overview of the shipping activities that are integrated in the DFDS Group. Acquired activities now integrated in DFDS DFDS Tor Line DFDS Tor Line was the main freight-carrying division of DFDS. It operated a large number of RO-RO freighters on the North Sea as well as the Baltic Sea. It was formed as merger of DFDS' and Tor Line's freight operations after DFDS bought the latter in 1982 (until 1988 the passenger service between Sweden and the United Kingdom was also marketed as DFDS Tor Line). The operation of DFDS Tor Line were integrated into DFDS following the acquisition of Norfolkline in 2010. DFDS Lisco DFDS Lisco was a Lithuanian subsidiary acquired by DFDS in 2001. It operated five lines with seven ferries for passengers and freight connecting Germany to Lithuania, Latvia and Russia as well as Germany to Sweden. DFDS Lisco had subsidiaries in Germany (DFDS Lisco GmbH), Sweden (DFDS Tor Line AB), Latvia (DFDS Tor Line SIA) and Russia (OOO DFDS Lisco). The operation of DFDS Lisco were integrated into DFDS Seaways following the acquisition of Norfolkline in 2010. DFDS Lys Line DFDS Lys Line transported freight from Norway, Sweden and Denmark to Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Italy, offering door-to-door transportation. The company was founded in 1970. The operation of DFDS Lys Line were integrated into DFDS following the acquisition of Norfolkline in 2010. DFDS Container Line DFDS Container Line transports containers between Ireland and the Netherlands. On October 2, 2006 the acquisition of Norfolkline Containers by DFDS A/S was completed. Established in August 1997 Norfolkline Containers was set up to offer Direct Port-to-Port services between Ireland and mainland Europe. The operation of DFDS Container Line were integrated into DFDS following the acquisition of Norfolkline in 2010. As of now all of the things from 2010 were made by Raj Patel of Hanover Park Norfolkline Norfolkline was a European ferry operator and logistics company owned by Maersk. It provided freight ferry services on the English channel, Irish Sea, and the North Sea; and passenger ferry services on the English channel and Irish Sea; and logistics services across Europe. Norfolkline employed more than 2,200 employees in 13 countries across Europe, operating out of 35 different locations. It was acquired by DFDS in July 2010. Maersk received a 31.3 percent stake in DFDS as part payment. After a two-year lock-up period of the shares they were sold in September 2013. U.N. Ro-Ro U.N.

In the UK it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. The species is native to South and Central America, but is now a pantropical weed, and can be found in Southern United States, South Asia, East Asia and South Africa as well. It is not shade tolerant, and is primarily found on soils with low nutrient concentrations Mimosa pudica is well known for its rapid plant movement. Like a number of other plant species, it undergoes changes in leaf orientation termed \\"sleep\\" or nyctinastic movement. The foliage closes during darkness and reopens in light. This was first studied by the French scientist Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan. Due to Mimosa's unique response to touch, it became an ideal plant for many experiments regarding plant habituation and memory. Taxonomy Mimosa pudica was first formally described by Carl Linnaeus in Species Plantarum in 1753. The species epithet, pudica, is Latin for \\"bashful\\" or \\"shrinking\\", alluding to its shrinking reaction to contact. The species is known by numerous common names including sensitive plant, humble plant, shameplant, and touch-me-not. Description Mimosa pudica flower from Thrissur, Kerala, India Flower Mimosa pudica folding leaflets inward. Mimosa pudica seeds Mimosa pudica with mature seed pods on plant Mimosa pudica seedling with two cotyledons and some leaflets. The whole plant of Mimosa pudica includes thorny stem and branches, flower head, dry flowers, seed pods, and folded and unfolded leaflets The stem is erect in young plants, but becomes creeping or trailing with age. It can hang very low and become floppy. The stem is slender, branching, and sparsely to densely prickly, growing to a length of . The leaves are bipinnately compound, with one or two pinnae pairs, and 10‚Äì26 leaflets per pinna. The petioles are also prickly. Pedunculate (stalked) pale pink or purple flower heads arise from the leaf axils in mid summer with more and more flowers as the plant gets older. The globose to ovoid heads are in diameter (excluding the stamens). On close examination, it is seen that the floret petals are red in their upper part and the filaments are pink to lavender. Pollens are circular with approximately 8 microns diameter. Pollens The fruit consists of clusters of two to eight pods from long each, these being prickly on the margins. The pods break into two to five segments and contain pale brown seeds about long. The flowers are insect pollinated and wind pollinated. The seeds have hard seed coats which restrict germination and make osmotic pressure and soil acidity less significant hindrances. High temperatures are the main stimuli that cause the seeds to end dormancy. The roots of Mimosa pudica create carbon disulfide, which prevents certain pathogenic and mycorrhizal fungi from growing within the plant's rhizosphere. This allows the formation of nodules on the roots of the plant that contain endosymbiotic diazotrophs, which fix atmospheric nitrogen and convert it into a form that is usable by the plant. Mimosa pudica is a tetraploid (2n = 52). =Plant movement= Video of Mimosa pudica closing when touched in Hainan, China The leaflets also close when stimulated in other ways, such as touching, warming, blowing, shaking, which are all encapsulated within mechanical or electrical stimulation. These types of movements have been termed seismonastic movements. This reflex may have evolved as a defense mechanism to disincentivize predators, or alternatively to shade the plant in order to reduce water lossage due to evaporation. The main structure mechanistically responsible for the drooping of the leaves is the pulvinus. The stimulus is transmitted as an action potential from a stimulated leaflet, to the leaflet's swollen base (pulvinus), and from there to the pulvini of the other leaflets, which run along the length of the leaf's rachis. The action potential then passes into the petiole, and finally to the large pulvinus at the end of the petiole, where the leaf attaches to the stem. The pulvini cells gain and lose turgor due to water moving in and out of these cells, and multiple ion concentrations play a role in the manipulation of water movement. Ions cannot easily move in and out of cells, so protein channels such as voltage-gated potassium channels and calcium-permeable anion channels are responsible for allowing potassium and calcium, respectively, to flow through the cell membrane, making cells permeable to these ions. The action potential causes potassium ions to flow out from the vacuoles of cells in the various pulvini. Differences in turgidity in different regions of the leaf and stem results in the closing of the leaflets and the collapse of the leaf petiole. Other important proteins include H+-ATPases, aquaporins, and actin, which all aid in the redistribution of ions in the pulvini, especially during a seismonastic response. H+-ATPases and aquaporins aid in the direct movement of water molecules, while actin's role has a more biochemical explanation. Actin is composed of many phosphorylated tyrosine (an amino acid) molecules, and manipulation of how phosphorylated the tyrosine molecules are directly correlates to how much the M. pudica leaves droop. This movement of folding inwards is energetically costly for the plant and also interferes with the process of photosynthesis. This characteristic is quite common within the Mimosoideae subfamily of the legume family, Fabaceae. The stimulus can also be transmitted to neighboring leaves. It is not known exactly why Mimosa pudica evolved this trait, but many scientists think that the plant uses its ability to shrink as a defense from herbivores. Animals may be afraid of a fast moving plant and would rather eat a less active one. Another possible explanation is that the sudden movement dislodges harmful insects. The movement of calcium, potassium, and chloride ions in pulvini cells has been analyzed to better understand how ion and water flux affect M. pudica leaves drooping. A batch of M. pudica were grown and watered daily, and 10-20 pulvini were collected from each group of pulvini reactive to touch, and pulvini unreactive to touch. To further understand the movement of the ions, the upper and lower halves of all collected pulvini underwent separate ion analysis using the x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy method. This method tracked the location of the ions by coloring them each with a different color of fluorescence dye. In terms of calcium concentrations, there was a significant difference in concentration between both halves of the pulvini, in both the reactive and nonreactive pulvini. For potassium, higher concentrations were found throughout the reactive pulvini, while a high concentration difference in the top and bottom halves of the unreactive pulvini was found. Upon stimulation to the reactive pulvini, an average of a 240% increase in potassium was found in the pulvini cells. Analysis of chloride ions gave similar results where high concentrations were found throughout the reactive pulvini, except in the unreactive pulvini the difference in concentration in the top and bottom pulvini was not significant. Overall, what was found was that high concentrations of potassium, chloride, and calcium led to a rapid decrease in water in the pulvini, which results in the drooping of the M. pudica leaves. Mitigation of this gradient resulted in less reaction and movement of the leaves. Distribution and habitat Mimosa pudica is native to the Americas. It can also be found in Asian countries such as Singapore, Bangladesh, Thailand, India, Nepal, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Japan, Sri Lanka. It has been introduced to many other regions and is regarded as an invasive species in Tanzania, South and Southeast Asia and many Pacific islands. It is regarded as invasive in parts of Australia and is a declared weed in the Northern Territory, and Western Australia although not naturalized there. Control is recommended in Queensland. It has also been introduced to Uganda, Ghana, Nigeria, Seychelles, Mauritius and East Asia but is not regarded as invasive in those places. In the United States, it grows in Louisiana, Florida, Hawaii, Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, Puerto Rico, Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, Georgia, the territory of Guam, and the Virgin Islands, as well as Cuba and the Dominican Republic.Distribution of Mimosa pudica in the United States of America Natural Resources Conservation Service, United States Department of Agriculture. Predators Mimosa pudica has several natural predators, such as the spider mite and mimosa webworm. Both of these insects wrap the leaflets in webs that hinder the responsive closing. Webbed leaves are noticeable as they become brown fossilized remnants after an attack. The Mimosa webworm is composed of two generations that arise at different seasons. This makes prevention difficult and requires proper timing of insecticides to avoid aiding other predators. Once the larvae become steel-gray moths they are harmless to the plant, but lay more eggs. Agricultural impact The species can be a weed for tropical crops, particularly when fields are hand- cultivated. Crops it tends to affect are corn, coconuts, tomatoes, cotton, coffee, bananas, soybeans, papaya, and sugar cane. Dry thickets may become a fire hazard. In some cases it has become a forage plant although the variety in Hawaii is reported to be toxic to livestock. In addition, Mimosa pudica can change the physico-chemical properties of the soil it invades. For example, the total N and K increased in significantly invaded areas. = Phytoremediation = Thirty-six native Thai plant species were tested to see which conducted the most phytoremediation of arsenic polluted soils caused by tin mines. Mimosa pudica was one of the four species that significantly extracted and bioaccumulated the pollutant into its leaves. Other studies have found that Mimosa pudica extracts heavy metals such as copper, lead, tin, and zinc from polluted soils. This allows for the soil to gradually return to less toxic compositions. = Nitrogen fixation = Mimosa pudica can form root nodules that are habitable by nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The bacteria are able to convert atmospheric nitrogen, which plants cannot use, into a form that plants can use. This trait is common among plants in the family Fabaceae. Nitrogen is a vital element for both plant growth and reproduction. Nitrogen is also essential for plant photosynthesis because it is a component of chlorophyll. Nitrogen fixation contributes nitrogen to the plant and to the soil surrounding the plant's roots. Mimosa pudica's ability to fix nitrogen may have arisen in conjunction with the evolution of nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Nitrogen fixation is an adaptive trait that has transformed the parasitic relationship between the bacteria and plants into a mutualistic relationship. The shifting dynamics of this relationship are demonstrated by the corresponding improvement of various symbiotic characteristics in both Mimosa pudica and bacteria. These traits include enhanced \\"competitive nodulation, nodule development, intracellular infection, and bacteroid persistence\\". As much as 60% of the nitrogen found in Mimosa pudica can be attributed to the fixation of N2 by bacteria. Burkholderia phymatum STM815T and Cupriavidus taiwanensis LMG19424T are beta-rhizobial strains of diazotrophs that are highly effective at fixing nitrogen when coupled with M. pudica. Burkholderia is also shown to be a strong symbiont of Mimosa pudica in nitrogen-poor soils in regions like Cerrado and Caatinga.  Cultivation  In cultivation, this plant is most often grown as an indoor annual, but is also grown for groundcover. Propagation is generally by seed. Mimosa pudica grows most effectively in nutrient poor soil that allows for substantial water drainage. However, this plant is also shown to grow in scalped and eroded subsoils. Typically, disrupted soil is necessary in order for M. pudica to become established in an area. Additionally, the plant is shade intolerant and frost- sensitive, meaning that it does not tolerate low levels of light or cold temperatures. Mimosa pudica does not compete for resources with larger foliage or forest canopy undergrowth. In temperate zones it must be grown under protection, where the temperature does not fall below . Chemical constituents Mimosa pudica contains the toxic alkaloid mimosine, which has been found to also have antiproliferative and apoptotic effects. The extracts of Mimosa pudica immobilize the filariform larvae of Strongyloides stercoralis in less than one hour. Aqueous extracts of the roots of the plant have shown significant neutralizing effects in the lethality of the venom of the monocled cobra (Naja kaouthia). It appears to inhibit the myotoxicity and enzyme activity of cobra venom. Mimosa pudica demonstrates both antioxidant and antibacterial properties. This plant has also been demonstrated to be non- toxic in brine shrimp lethality tests, which suggests that M. pudica has low levels of toxicity. Chemical analysis has shown that Mimosa pudica contains various compounds, including \\"alkaloids, flavonoid C-glycosides, sterols, terenoids, tannins, saponin and fatty acids\\".Parasuraman S, Ching TH, Leong CH, Banik U (2019) Antidiabetic and antihyperlipidemic effects of a methanolic extract of Mimosa pudica (Fabaceae) in diabetic rats, Egyptian Journal of Basic and Applied Sciences, 6:1, 137-148, DOI: 10.1080/2314808X.2019.1681660 The roots of the plant have been shown to contain up to 10% tannin. A substance similar to adrenaline has been found within the plant's leaves. Mimosa pudica's seeds produce mucilage made up of D-glucuronic acid and D-xylose. Additionally, extracts of M. pudica have been shown to contain crocetin-dimethylester, tubulin, and green-yellow fatty oils. A new class of phytohormone turgorines, which are derivatives of gallic acid 4-O-(Œ≤-D- glucopyranosyl-6'-sulfate), have been discovered within the plant. The nitrogen-fixing properties of Mimosa pudica contribute to a high nitrogen content within the plant's leaves. The leaves of M. pudica also contain a wide range of carbon to mineral content, as well as a large variation in 13C values. The correlation between these two numbers suggests that significant ecological adaptation has occurred among the varieties of M. pudica in Brazil. The roots contain sac-like structures that release organic and organosulfur compounds including SO2, methylsulfinic acid, pyruvic acid, lactic acid, ethanesulfinic acid, propane sulfinic acid, 2-mercaptoaniline, S-propyl propane 1-thiosulfinate, and thioformaldehyde, an elusive and highly unstable compound never before reported to be emitted by a plant.  Research with Mimosa pudica  Flower and stems Wilhelm Pfeffer, a German botanist during the 17th century, used Mimosa in one of the first experiments testing plant habituation. Further experimentation was done in 1965, when Holmes and Gruenberg discovered that Mimosa could distinguish between two stimuli, a water drop and a finger touch. Their findings also demonstrated that the habituated behavior was not due to fatigue since the leaf-folding response returned when another stimulus was presented. Electrical signaling experiments were conducted on Mimosa pudica, where 1.3‚Äì1.5 volts and 2‚Äì10 ¬µC of charge acted as the threshold to induce closing of the leaves. This topic was further explored in 2017 by neuroscientist Greg Gage who connected Mimosa pudica to Dionaea muscipula, better known as the Venus flytrap. Both plants had electrical wiring connecting them and were linked to an electrocardiogram. The results showed how causing an action potential in one plant led to an electrical response, causing both plants to respond. Experiments were made on how anesthetics for animals could affect Mimosa pudica. These experiments showed that anesthetics cause narcosis of the motor organs, which was observed by the application of volatile ether, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, formaldehyde, and other substances. In 2018, two research groups from the Universities of Palermo (Italy) and Lugano (Switzerland) demonstrated the feasibility of using such plant as a building block for creating plant-based controllable two-color displays, exploiting air jets instead of electrical or touch-based stimulation.  Habitual learning  Plants that live in low light environments have less of an opportunity for photosynthesis compared to plants that live in high light environments where sunshine isn't a problem. When the Mimosa plant folds in its leaves as a defensive mechanism there is an energetic trade off, since folding its leaves reduces the amount of photosynthesis the Mimosa can perform during the closed period by 40%, but provides a rapid defensive mechanism against potentially harmful predators or external stimulation. In an experiment, researcher Monica Gagliano wanted to study if Mimosa plants in low light conditions would have a greater potential for learning than those grown in high light, since the low light plants were already in low energy environments and folding their leaves would be more energetically costly to the plant. The simplest form of learning is the ability of an organism to have a certain level of sensitivity to the environment that allows the organism to respond to potentially harmful stimuli as well as the capability to learn and filter out irrelevant stimuli (habituation) or increase the response due to a learned stimulus (sensitization). Researchers predicted the low light plants would have adapted to have faster habitual learning capabilities so they could filter out unharmful stimuli to increase their energy production. Plants were either grown in high light or low light conditions. The plants were stimulated by being dropped from 15 cm for either a single drop, or consecutive training sessions where the plants were repeatedly dropped. To test that the plants were suppressing their leaf folding reflex from habitual learning and not from exhaustion, the plants were shaken as a novel stimuli to see if the plants would fold their leaves (dishabituation test). The first group was tested to see if short term memory was enough for plants to modify their behaviour. Regardless of what light group the plants were in, one drop was not enough for the plants to learn to ignore the stimulation. For the groups that were dropped repetitively, the plants stopped folding their leaves and were even fully open after a drop before the end of the trainings. The low light plants learned faster to ignore the dropping stimulation than the high light plants. When the plants were shaken, they responded immediately by folding their leaves, which suggests that the plants were not ignoring the dropping stimulation due to exhaustion. This research suggests that the Mimosa has the capability for habitual learning and memory storage and that Mimosa plants grown in low light conditions have faster learning mechanisms so they can reduce the amount of time their leaves are unnecessarily closed to optimise energy production. Given that plants lack a central nervous system, the means by which they send and store information is not obvious. There are two hypotheses for memory in Mimosa, neither of which has yet been generally accepted. The first is when the plant is stimulated it releases a surge of calcium ions that are sensed by the protein calmodulin. The relationship between the ions and proteins are thought to stimulate voltage gated ion channels which cause electrical signals, which could be the base of plant long term memory. The other hypothesis is that plant cells act similarly to neural cells by creating electrical gradients by opening and closing ion channels and passing it along cell junctions. The information passed along can control which genes are turned on and which genes are turned off, which could be a mode for long term memory.

The red drum has a characteristic eyespot near the tail and is somewhat streamlined. Three- year-old red drum typically weigh 6-8 lb. The largest red drum on record weighed just over 94 lb and was caught in 1984 on Hatteras Island. Male red drum make a knocking or drumming sound during spawning by vibrating their swim bladders. The most distinguishing mark on the red drum is one large black spot on the upper part of the tail base. Having multiple spots is not uncommon for this fish, but having no spots is extremely rare. As the fish with multiple spots grow older, they seem to lose their excess spots. Scientists believe that the black spot near their tail helps fool predators into attacking the red drum's tail instead of its head, allowing the red drum to escape.Smithsonian Marine Station page on red drum The red drum uses its senses of sight and touch, and its downturned mouth, to locate forage on the bottom through vacuuming or biting. On the top and middle of the water column, it uses changes in the light that might look like food. In the summer and fall, adult red drum feed on crabs, shrimp, and mullet; in the spring and winter, adults primarily feed on menhaden, mullet, pinfish, sea robin, lizardfish, spot, Atlantic croaker, and mudminnows. Distribution Red drum naturally occur along the eastern and southern Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, and Virginia. They are a highly prized game fish in the Gulf of Mexico. Aquaculture activities involving them occur around the world.Peters Life History of Red Drum Peters, K.M., McMichael Jr., R. H.

The relationship between length (L) and weight (W) for nearly all species of fish can be expressed by an equation of the form: :W = aL^b\\\\\\\\!\\\\, Invariably, b is close to 3.0 for all species, and a varies between species. Jenkins (2004)Jenkins, J.A. Fish bioindicators of ecosystem condition at the Calcasieu Estuary, Louisiana. National Wetlands Research Center, USGS, Open-File Report 2004-1323, 2004 reported slightly different weight-length relationships for red drum caught in the spring and the fall off the western Gulf Coast of Louisiana: :Spring: W = 0.000005297L^{3.110}\\\\\\\\!\\\\, :Fall: W = 0.000015241L^{2.94}\\\\\\\\!\\\\, where weight is in grams and length is total length measured in millimeters. For example, these relationships predict that a 600-mm red drum (just under 2 ft long) would weigh about 2300 g (just over 5 lb). These relationships can be used more specifically to determine how healthy a sample of red drum is by comparing their actual weights to weights predicted by these relationships for the same length. Consumption In the early 1980s, the chef Paul Prudhomme made his dish of Cajun-style blackened redfish (red drum) popular. His seasoning was then sold commercially and the dish became so popular that redfish were overfished to the point of near extinction. On March 1, 2009, redfish was the \\"secret ingredient\\" on the television program Iron Chef America, with competitors Mourad Lahlou and Cat Cora both preparing several dishes from the fish. Red drum have a moderate flavor and are not oily. Big drum can be tricky to clean; removing the large scales can be challenging. Many fishers prefer to fillet with an electric knife, first removing the fillet from along the backbone, and then using the electric knife to cut the fillet from the skin and scales. Fish over 15 lb can become tough and have a consistency comparable with chicken, rather than the flaky texture of many species of fish. Younger fish are often indistinguishable in flavor from black drum.A Comparison of Black Drum, Red Drum, and their Hybrid in Saltwater Pond Culture Anne Henderson-Arzapalo, Robert L. Colura, Anthony F. Maciorowski, Journal of the World Aquaculture Society Volume 25 Issue 2, Pages 289 - 296 Commercial and recreational use From 1980 through 1988, commercial fishermen took an average of 28% of the redfish, while sport fishermen harvested 72%. Catch limits and size restrictions have increased the average weight of redfish caught in Louisiana coastal waters.Understanding Redfish Biology - accessed August 6, 2009 Restrictions on both sport and commercial fishermen allowed the species to rebuild. States actively vary the recreational catch limits and minimum and maximum lengths to help maintain sustainable red drum populations. Executive Order 13449 of October 20, 2007, issued by U.S. President George W. Bush, designated the red drum as a protected game fish. The order prohibits sale of red drum caught in federal waters and encourages states to consider designating red drum as a protected game fish within state waters. While they may no longer be commercially harvested in U.S. federal waters or in most state waters, they are readily caught and still enjoyed as table fare by many. In addition, farm-raised redfish are still available as a commercial product Fritchey, Robert (1994). Wetland Riders. Golden Meadow, Louisiana: New Moon Press. Commercial netting disappeared after coastal states such as Florida declared red drum prohibited for sale. Recreational size and bag limits have been highly effective, allowing daily limits to be increased in recent years. Relationship to humans The North Carolina General Assembly of 1971 designated the red drum as the official state saltwater fish.

While some simple ransomware may lock the system in a way which is not difficult for a knowledgeable person to reverse, more advanced malware uses a technique called cryptoviral extortion, in which it encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them. In a properly implemented cryptoviral extortion attack, recovering the files without the decryption key is an intractable problem ‚Äì and difficult to trace digital currencies such as Ukash or Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency are used for the ransoms, making tracing and prosecuting the perpetrators difficult. Ransomware attacks are typically carried out using a Trojan that is disguised as a legitimate file that the user is tricked into downloading or opening when it arrives as an email attachment. However, one high-profile example, the \\"WannaCry worm\\", travelled automatically between computers without user interaction. Starting from around 2012 the use of ransomware scams has grown internationally. There were 181.5 million ransomware attacks in the first six months of 2018. This marks a 229% increase over this same time frame in 2017. In June 2014, vendor McAfee released data showing that it had collected more than double the number of samples of ransomware that quarter than it had in the same quarter of the previous year. CryptoLocker was particularly successful, procuring an estimated US$3 million before it was taken down by authorities, and CryptoWall was estimated by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to have accrued over US$18 million by June 2015.  Operation  The concept of file-encrypting ransomware was invented and implemented by Young and Yung at Columbia University and was presented at the 1996 IEEE Security & Privacy conference. It is called cryptoviral extortion and it was inspired by the fictional facehugger in the movie Alien. Cryptoviral extortion is the following three-round protocol carried out between the attacker and the victim. # [attacker‚Üívictim] The attacker generates a key pair and places the corresponding public key in the malware. The malware is released. # [victim‚Üíattacker] To carry out the cryptoviral extortion attack, the malware generates a random symmetric key and encrypts the victim's data with it. It uses the public key in the malware to encrypt the symmetric key. This is known as hybrid encryption and it results in a small asymmetric ciphertext as well as the symmetric ciphertext of the victim's data. It zeroizes the symmetric key and the original plaintext data to prevent recovery. It puts up a message to the user that includes the asymmetric ciphertext and how to pay the ransom. The victim sends the asymmetric ciphertext and e-money to the attacker. # [attacker‚Üívictim] The attacker receives the payment, deciphers the asymmetric ciphertext with the attacker's private key, and sends the symmetric key to the victim. The victim deciphers the encrypted data with the needed symmetric key thereby completing the cryptovirology attack. The symmetric key is randomly generated and will not assist other victims. At no point is the attacker's private key exposed to victims and the victim need only send a very small ciphertext (the encrypted symmetric-cipher key) to the attacker. Ransomware attacks are typically carried out using a Trojan, entering a system through, for example, a malicious attachment, embedded link in a Phishing email, or a vulnerability in a network service. The program then runs a payload, which locks the system in some fashion, or claims to lock the system but does not (e.g., a scareware program). Payloads may display a fake warning purportedly by an entity such as a law enforcement agency, falsely claiming that the system has been used for illegal activities, contains content such as pornography and \\"pirated\\" media. Some payloads consist simply of an application designed to lock or restrict the system until payment is made, typically by setting the Windows Shell to itself, or even modifying the master boot record and/or partition table to prevent the operating system from booting until it is repaired. The most sophisticated payloads encrypt files, with many using strong encryption to encrypt the victim's files in such a way that only the malware author has the needed decryption key. Payment is virtually always the goal, and the victim is coerced into paying for the ransomware to be removed either by supplying a program that can decrypt the files, or by sending an unlock code that undoes the payload's changes. While the attacker may simply take the money without returning the victim's files, it is in the attacker's best interest to perform the decryption as agreed, since victims will stop sending payments if it becomes known that they serve no purpose. A key element in making ransomware work for the attacker is a convenient payment system that is hard to trace. A range of such payment methods have been used, including wire transfers, premium-rate text messages, pre-paid voucher services such as paysafecard, and the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. In May 2020, vendor Sophos reported that the global average cost to remediate a ransomware attack (considering downtime, people time, device cost, network cost, lost opportunity and ransom paid) was $761,106. Ninety-five percent of organizations that paid the ransom had their data restored.  History  = = The first known malware extortion attack, the \\"AIDS Trojan\\" written by Joseph Popp in 1989, had a design failure so severe it was not necessary to pay the extortionist at all. Its payload hid the files on the hard drive and encrypted only their names, and displayed a message claiming that the user's license to use a certain piece of software had expired. The user was asked to pay US$189 to \\"PC Cyborg Corporation\\" in order to obtain a repair tool even though the decryption key could be extracted from the code of the Trojan. The Trojan was also known as \\"PC Cyborg\\". Popp was declared mentally unfit to stand trial for his actions, but he promised to donate the profits from the malware to fund AIDS research. The idea of abusing anonymous cash systems to safely collect ransom from human kidnapping was introduced in 1992 by Sebastiaan von Solms and David Naccache. This electronic money collection method was also proposed for cryptoviral extortion attacks. In the von Solms-Naccache scenario a newspaper publication was used (since bitcoin ledgers did not exist at the time the paper was written). The notion of using public key cryptography for data kidnapping attacks was introduced in 1996 by Adam L. Young and Moti Yung. Young and Yung critiqued the failed AIDS Information Trojan that relied on symmetric cryptography alone, the fatal flaw being that the decryption key could be extracted from the Trojan, and implemented an experimental proof-of-concept cryptovirus on a Macintosh SE/30 that used RSA and the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) to hybrid encrypt the victim's data. Since public key cryptography is used, the virus only contains the encryption key. The attacker keeps the corresponding private decryption key private. Young and Yung's original experimental cryptovirus had the victim send the asymmetric ciphertext to the attacker who deciphers it and returns the symmetric decryption key it contains to the victim for a fee. Long before electronic money existed Young and Yung proposed that electronic money could be extorted through encryption as well, stating that \\"the virus writer can effectively hold all of the money ransom until half of it is given to him. Even if the e-money was previously encrypted by the user, it is of no use to the user if it gets encrypted by a cryptovirus\\". They referred to these attacks as being \\"cryptoviral extortion\\", an overt attack that is part of a larger class of attacks in a field called cryptovirology, which encompasses both overt and covert attacks. The cryptoviral extortion protocol was inspired by the parasitic relationship between H. R. Giger's facehugger and its host in the movie Alien. Examples of extortionate ransomware became prominent in May 2005. By mid-2006, Trojans such as Gpcode, TROJ.RANSOM.A, Archiveus, Krotten, Cryzip, and MayArchive began utilizing more sophisticated RSA encryption schemes, with ever-increasing key-sizes. Gpcode.AG, which was detected in June 2006, was encrypted with a 660-bit RSA public key. In June 2008, a variant known as Gpcode.AK was detected. Using a 1024-bit RSA key, it was believed large enough to be computationally infeasible to break without a concerted distributed effort. Encrypting ransomware returned to prominence in late 2013 with the propagation of CryptoLocker‚Äîusing the Bitcoin digital currency platform to collect ransom money. In December 2013, ZDNet estimated based on Bitcoin transaction information that between 15 October and 18 December, the operators of CryptoLocker had procured about US$27 million from infected users. The CryptoLocker technique was widely copied in the months following, including CryptoLocker 2.0 (thought not to be related to CryptoLocker), CryptoDefense (which initially contained a major design flaw that stored the private key on the infected system in a user-retrievable location, due to its use of Windows' built-in encryption APIs), and the August 2014 discovery of a Trojan specifically targeting network-attached storage devices produced by Synology. In January 2015, it was reported that ransomware-styled attacks have occurred against individual websites via hacking, and through ransomware designed to target Linux-based web servers. In some infections, there is a two-stage payload, common in many malware systems. The user is tricked into running a script, which downloads the main virus and executes it. In early versions of the dual-payload system, the script was contained in a Microsoft Office document with an attached VBScript macro, or in a windows scripting facility (WSF) file. As detection systems started blocking these first stage payloads, the Microsoft Malware Protection Center identified a trend away toward LNK files with self-contained Microsoft Windows PowerShell scripts. In 2016, PowerShell was found to be involved in nearly 40% of endpoint security incidents, Some ransomware strains have used proxies tied to Tor hidden services to connect to their command and control servers, increasing the difficulty of tracing the exact location of the criminals. Furthermore, dark web vendors have increasingly started to offer the technology as a service. Symantec has classified ransomware to be the most dangerous cyber threat. On 28 September 2020, the computer systems at US‚Äô biggest healthcare provider the Universal Health Services, was hit by a ransomware attack. The UHS chain from different locations reported noticing problems, with some locations reporting locked computers and phone systems from early Sunday (27 September). = Non- encrypting ransomware = In August 2010, Russian authorities arrested nine individuals connected to a ransomware Trojan known as WinLock. Unlike the previous Gpcode Trojan, WinLock did not use encryption. Instead, WinLock trivially restricted access to the system by displaying pornographic images and asked users to send a premium-rate SMS (costing around US$10) to receive a code that could be used to unlock their machines. The scam hit numerous users across Russia and neighbouring countries‚Äîreportedly earning the group over US$16 million. In 2011, a ransomware Trojan surfaced that imitated the Windows Product Activation notice, and informed users that a system's Windows installation had to be re-activated due to \\"[being a] victim of fraud\\". An online activation option was offered (like the actual Windows activation process), but was unavailable, requiring the user to call one of six international numbers to input a 6-digit code. While the malware claimed that this call would be free, it was routed through a rogue operator in a country with high international phone rates, who placed the call on hold, causing the user to incur large international long distance charges. In February 2013, a ransomware Trojan based on the Stamp.EK exploit kit surfaced; the malware was distributed via sites hosted on the project hosting services SourceForge and GitHub that claimed to offer \\"fake nude pics\\" of celebrities. In July 2013, an OS X-specific ransomware Trojan surfaced, which displays a web page that accuses the user of downloading pornography. Unlike its Windows-based counterparts, it does not block the entire computer, but simply exploits the behaviour of the web browser itself to frustrate attempts to close the page through normal means. In July 2013, a 21-year-old man from Virginia, whose computer coincidentally did contain pornographic photographs of underage girls with whom he had conducted sexualized communications, turned himself in to police after receiving and being deceived by FBI MoneyPak Ransomware accusing him of possessing child pornography. An investigation discovered the incriminating files, and the man was charged with child sexual abuse and possession of child pornography. = Exfiltration (Leakware / Doxware) = The converse of ransomware is a cryptovirology attack invented by Adam L. Young that threatens to publish stolen information from the victim's computer system rather than deny the victim access to it. In a leakware attack, malware exfiltrates sensitive host data either to the attacker or alternatively, to remote instances of the malware, and the attacker threatens to publish the victim's data unless a ransom is paid. The attack was presented at West Point in 2003 and was summarized in the book Malicious Cryptography as follows, \\"The attack differs from the extortion attack in the following way. In the extortion attack, the victim is denied access to its own valuable information and has to pay to get it back, where in the attack that is presented here the victim retains access to the information but its disclosure is at the discretion of the computer virus\\". The attack is rooted in game theory and was originally dubbed \\"non-zero sum games and survivable malware\\". The attack can yield monetary gain in cases where the malware acquires access to information that may damage the victim user or organization, e.g., the reputational damage that could result from publishing proof that the attack itself was a success. Common targets for exfiltration include: * third party information stored by the primary victim (such as customer account information or health records); * information proprietary to the victim (such as trade secrets and product information) * embarrassing information (such as the victim's health information or information about the victim's personal past) Exfiltration attacks are usually targeted, with a curated victim list, and often preliminary surveillance of teh victim's systems to find potential data targets and weaknesses. = Mobile ransomware = With the increased popularity of ransomware on PC platforms, ransomware targeting mobile operating systems has also proliferated. Typically, mobile ransomware payloads are blockers, as there is little incentive to encrypt data since it can be easily restored via online synchronization. Mobile ransomware typically targets the Android platform, as it allows applications to be installed from third-party sources. The payload is typically distributed as an APK file installed by an unsuspecting user; it may attempt to display a blocking message over top of all other applications, while another used a form of clickjacking to cause the user to give it \\"device administrator\\" privileges to achieve deeper access to the system. Different tactics have been used on iOS devices, such as exploiting iCloud accounts and using the Find My iPhone system to lock access to the device. On iOS 10.3, Apple patched a bug in the handling of JavaScript pop-up windows in Safari that had been exploited by ransomware websites. It recently has been shown that ransomware may also target ARM architectures like those that can be found in various Internet-of- Things (IoT) devices, such as Industrial IoT edge devices. In August 2019 researchers demonstrated it's possible to infect DSLR cameras with ransomware. Digital cameras often use Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP - standard protocol used to transfer files.) Researchers found that it was possible to exploit vulnerabilities in the protocol to infect target camera(s) with ransomware (or execute any arbitrary code). This attack was presented at the Defcon security conference in Las Vegas as a proof of concept attack (not as actual armed malware).  Notable examples  = Reveton = A Reveton payload, fraudulently claiming that the user must pay a fine to the Metropolitan Police Service In 2012, a major ransomware Trojan known as Reveton began to spread. Based on the Citadel Trojan (which itself, is based on the Zeus Trojan), its payload displays a warning purportedly from a law enforcement agency claiming that the computer has been used for illegal activities, such as downloading unlicensed software or child pornography. Due to this behaviour, it is commonly referred to as the \\"Police Trojan\\". The warning informs the user that to unlock their system, they would have to pay a fine using a voucher from an anonymous prepaid cash service such as Ukash or paysafecard. To increase the illusion that the computer is being tracked by law enforcement, the screen also displays the computer's IP address, while some versions display footage from a victim's webcam to give the illusion that the user is being recorded. Reveton initially began spreading in various European countries in early 2012. Variants were localized with templates branded with the logos of different law enforcement organizations based on the user's country; for example, variants used in the United Kingdom contained the branding of organizations such as the Metropolitan Police Service and the Police National E-Crime Unit. Another version contained the logo of the royalty collection society PRS for Music, which specifically accused the user of illegally downloading music. In a statement warning the public about the malware, the Metropolitan Police clarified that they would never lock a computer in such a way as part of an investigation. In May 2012, Trend Micro threat researchers discovered templates for variations for the United States and Canada, suggesting that its authors may have been planning to target users in North America. By August 2012, a new variant of Reveton began to spread in the United States, claiming to require the payment of a $200 fine to the FBI using a MoneyPak card. In February 2013, a Russian citizen was arrested in Dubai by Spanish authorities for his connection to a crime ring that had been using Reveton; ten other individuals were arrested on money laundering charges. In August 2014, Avast Software reported that it had found new variants of Reveton that also distribute password-stealing malware as part of its payload. = CryptoLocker = Encrypting ransomware reappeared in September 2013 with a Trojan known as CryptoLocker, which generated a 2048-bit RSA key pair and uploaded in turn to a command-and-control server, and used to encrypt files using a whitelist of specific file extensions. The malware threatened to delete the private key if a payment of Bitcoin or a pre-paid cash voucher was not made within 3 days of the infection. Due to the extremely large key size it uses, analysts and those affected by the Trojan considered CryptoLocker extremely difficult to repair. Even after the deadline passed, the private key could still be obtained using an online tool, but the price would increase to 10 BTC‚Äîwhich cost approximately US$2300 as of November 2013. CryptoLocker was isolated by the seizure of the Gameover ZeuS botnet as part of Operation Tovar, as officially announced by the U.S. Department of Justice on 2 June 2014. The Department of Justice also publicly issued an indictment against the Russian hacker Evgeniy Bogachev for his alleged involvement in the botnet. It was estimated that at least US$3 million was extorted with the malware before the shutdown. = CryptoLocker.F and TorrentLocker = In September 2014, a wave of ransomware Trojans surfaced that first targeted users in Australia, under the names CryptoWall and CryptoLocker (which is, as with CryptoLocker 2.0, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker). The Trojans spread via fraudulent e-mails claiming to be failed parcel delivery notices from Australia Post; to evade detection by automatic e-mail scanners that follow all links on a page to scan for malware, this variant was designed to require users to visit a web page and enter a CAPTCHA code before the payload is actually downloaded, preventing such automated processes from being able to scan the payload. Symantec determined that these new variants, which it identified as CryptoLocker.F, were again, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker due to differences in their operation. A notable victim of the Trojans was the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; live programming on its television news channel ABC News 24 was disrupted for half an hour and shifted to Melbourne studios due to a CryptoWall infection on computers at its Sydney studio. Another Trojan in this wave, TorrentLocker, initially contained a design flaw comparable to CryptoDefense; it used the same keystream for every infected computer, making the encryption trivial to overcome. However, this flaw was later fixed. By late-November 2014, it was estimated that over 9,000 users had been infected by TorrentLocker in Australia alone, trailing only Turkey with 11,700 infections. = CryptoWall = Another major ransomware Trojan targeting Windows, CryptoWall, first appeared in 2014. One strain of CryptoWall was distributed as part of a malvertising campaign on the Zedo ad network in late- September 2014 that targeted several major websites; the ads redirected to rogue websites that used browser plugin exploits to download the payload. A Barracuda Networks researcher also noted that the payload was signed with a digital signature in an effort to appear trustworthy to security software. CryptoWall 3.0 used a payload written in JavaScript as part of an email attachment, which downloads executables disguised as JPG images. To further evade detection, the malware creates new instances of explorer.exe and svchost.exe to communicate with its servers. When encrypting files, the malware also deletes volume shadow copies and installs spyware that steals passwords and Bitcoin wallets. The FBI reported in June 2015 that nearly 1,000 victims had contacted the bureau's Internet Crime Complaint Center to report CryptoWall infections, and estimated losses of at least $18 million. The most recent version, CryptoWall 4.0, enhanced its code to avoid antivirus detection, and encrypts not only the data in files but also the file names. = Fusob = Fusob is one of the major mobile ransomware families. Between April 2015 and March 2016, about 56 percent of accounted mobile ransomware was Fusob. Like a typical mobile ransomware, it employs scare tactics to extort people to pay a ransom. The program pretends to be an accusatory authority, demanding the victim to pay a fine from $100 to $200 USD or otherwise face a fictitious charge. Rather surprisingly, Fusob suggests using iTunes gift cards for payment. Also, a timer clicking down on the screen adds to the users‚Äô anxiety as well. In order to infect devices, Fusob masquerades as a pornographic video player. Thus, victims, thinking it is harmless, unwittingly download Fusob. When Fusob is installed, it first checks the language used in the device. If it uses Russian or certain Eastern European languages, Fusob does nothing. Otherwise, it proceeds on to lock the device and demand ransom. Among victims, about 40% of them are in Germany with the United Kingdom and the United States following with 14.5% and 11.4% respectively. Fusob has lots in common with Small, which is another major family of mobile ransomware. They represented over 93% of mobile ransomware between 2015 and 2016. = WannaCry = In May 2017, the WannaCry ransomware attack spread through the Internet, using an exploit vector named EternalBlue, which was allegedly leaked from the U.S. National Security Agency. The ransomware attack, unprecedented in scale, infected more than 230,000 computers in over 150 countries, using 20 different languages to demand money from users using Bitcoin cryptocurrency. WannaCry demanded US$300 per computer. The attack affected Telef√≥nica and several other large companies in Spain, as well as parts of the British National Health Service (NHS), where at least 16 hospitals had to turn away patients or cancel scheduled operations, FedEx, Deutsche Bahn, Honda, Renault, as well as the Russian Interior Ministry and Russian telecom MegaFon. The attackers gave their victims a 7-day deadline from the day their computers got infected, after which the encrypted files would be deleted. = Petya = Petya was first discovered in March 2016; unlike other forms of encrypting ransomware, the malware aimed to infect the master boot record, installing a payload which encrypts the file tables of the NTFS file system the next time that the infected system boots, blocking the system from booting into Windows at all until the ransom is paid. Check Point reported that despite what it believed to be an innovative evolution in ransomware design, it had resulted in relatively-fewer infections than other ransomware active around the same time frame. On 27 June 2017, a heavily modified version of Petya was used for a global cyberattack primarily targeting Ukraine (but affecting many countries). This version had been modified to propagate using the same EternalBlue exploit that was used by WannaCry. Due to another design change, it is also unable to actually unlock a system after the ransom is paid; this led to security analysts speculating that the attack was not meant to generate illicit profit, but to simply cause disruption. =Bad Rabbit= On 24 October 2017, some users in Russia and Ukraine reported a new ransomware attack, named \\"Bad Rabbit\\", which follows a similar pattern to WannaCry and Petya by encrypting the user's file tables and then demands a Bitcoin payment to decrypt them. ESET believed the ransomware to have been distributed by a bogus update to Adobe Flash software. Among agencies that were affected by the ransomware were: Interfax, Odesa International Airport, Kyiv Metro, and the Ministry of Infrastructure of Ukraine. As it used corporate network structures to spread, the ransomware was also discovered in other countries, including Turkey, Germany, Poland, Japan, South Korea, and the United States. Experts believed the ransomware attack was tied to the Petya attack in Ukraine (especially because Bad Rabbit's code has many overlapping and analogical elements to the code of Petya/NotPetya, appending to CrowdStrike Bad Rabbit and NotPetya's DLL (dynamic link library) share 67 percent of the same code) though the only identity to the culprits are the names of characters from the Game of Thrones series embedded within the code. Security experts found that the ransomware did not use the EternalBlue exploit to spread, and a simple method to vaccinate an unaffected machine running older Windows versions was found by 24 October 2017. Further, the sites that had been used to spread the bogus Flash updating have gone offline or removed the problematic files within a few days of its discovery, effectively killing off the spread of Bad Rabbit. =SamSam= In 2016, a new strain of ransomware emerged that was targeting JBoss servers. This strain, named \\"SamSam\\", was found to bypass the process of phishing or illicit downloads in favor of exploiting vulnerabilities on weak servers. The malware uses a Remote Desktop Protocol brute-force attack to guess weak passwords until one is broken. The virus has been behind attacks on government and healthcare targets, with notable hacks occurring against the town of Farmington, New Mexico, the Colorado Department of Transportation, Davidson County, North Carolina, and most recently, a major breach of security on the infrastructure of Atlanta. Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri (born in Qom, Iran in 1991) and Faramarz Shahi Savandi (born in Shiraz, Iran, in 1984) are wanted by the FBI for allegedly launching SamSam ransomware. The two have allegedly made $6 million from extortion and caused over $30 million in damages using the malware. = Syskey = Syskey is a utility that was included with Windows NT-based operating systems to encrypt the user account database, optionally with a password. The tool has sometimes been effectively used as ransomware during technical support scams‚Äîwhere a caller with remote access to the computer may use the tool to lock the user out of their computer with a password known only to them. Syskey was removed from later versions of Windows 10 and Windows Server in 2017, due to being obsolete and \\"known to be used by hackers as part of ransomware scams\\".  Mitigation  As with other forms of malware, security software (antivirus software) might not detect a ransomware payload, or, especially in the case of encrypting payloads, only after encryption is under way or complete, particularly if a new version unknown to the protective software is distributed. If an attack is suspected or detected in its early stages, it takes some time for encryption to take place; immediate removal of the malware (a relatively simple process) before it has completed would stop further damage to data, without salvaging any already lost. Security experts have suggested precautionary measures for dealing with ransomware. Using software or other security policies to block known payloads from launching will help to prevent infection, but will not protect against all attacks As such, having a proper backup solution is a critical component to defending against ransomware. Note that, because many ransomware attackers will not only encrypt the victim's live machine but it will also attempt to delete any hot backups stored locally or on accessible over the network on a NAS, it's also critical to maintain \\"offline\\" backups of data stored in locations inaccessible from any potentially infected computer, such as external storage drives or devices that do not have any access to any network (including the Internet), prevents them from being accessed by the ransomware. Moreover, if using a NAS or Cloud storage, then the computer should have append-only permission to the destination storage, such that it cannot delete or overwrite previous backups. Installing security updates issued by software vendors can mitigate the vulnerabilities leveraged by certain strains to propagate. Other measures include cyber hygiene ‚àí exercising caution when opening e-mail attachments and links, network segmentation, and keeping critical computers isolated from networks. Furthermore, to mitigate the spread of ransomware measures of infection control can be applied. Such may include disconnecting infected machines from all networks, educational programs, effective communication channels, malware surveillance and ways of collective participation =File system defenses against ransomware= A number of file systems keep snapshots of the data they hold, which can be used to recover the contents of files from a time prior to the ransomware attack in the event the ransomware does not disable it. :* On Windows, the Volume shadow copy (VSS) is often used to store backups of data; ransomware often targets these snapshots to prevent recovery and therefore it is often advisable to disable user access to the user tool VSSadmin.exe to reduce the risk that ransomware can disable or delete past copies. :*On Windows 10, users can add specific directories or files to Controlled Folder Access in Windows Defender to protect them from ransomware. It is advised to add backup and other important directories to Controlled Folder Access. :* File servers running ZFS are almost universally immune to ransomware, because ZFS is capable of snapshotting even a large file system many times an hour, and these snapshots are immutable (read only) and easily rolled back or files recovered in the event of data corruption. In general, only an administrator can delete (but cannot modify) snapshots. =File decryption and recovery = There are a number of tools intended specifically to decrypt files locked by ransomware, although successful recovery may not be possible. If the same encryption key is used for all files, decryption tools use files for which there are both uncorrupted backups and encrypted copies (a known-plaintext attack in the jargon of cryptanalysis. But, it only works when the cipher the attacker used was weak to begin with, being vulnerable to known-plaintext attack); recovery of the key, if it is possible, may take several days. Free ransomware decryption tools can help decrypt files encrypted by the following forms of ransomware: AES_NI, Alcatraz Locker, Apocalypse, BadBlock, Bart, BTCWare, Crypt888, CryptoMix, CrySiS, EncrypTile, FindZip, Globe, Hidden Tear, Jigsaw, LambdaLocker, Legion, NoobCrypt, Stampado, SZFLocker, TeslaCrypt, XData. In addition, old copies of files may exist on the disk, which has been previously deleted. In some cases, these deleted versions may still be recoverable using software designed for that purpose.  The growing threat of malware  Ransomware malicious software has evolved since its beginnings when it was confined to one or two countries in Eastern Europe which then spread across the Atlantic to the United States and Canada. The first versions of this type of malware used various techniques to disable the computers by locking the victims system machine (Locker Ransomware) [133]. Some examples of how this ransomware works, include; locking the screen by displaying a message from a branch of local law enforcement indicating the user's lines like ‚ÄúYou have browsed illicit materials and must pay a fine‚Äù. They were first seen in Russia by year 2009 claiming to be a message from Microsoft. They also used to request a payment by sending an SMS message to a premium rate number. The next variant displayed pornographic image content and demanded payment for the removal of it. In 2011 the tactics changed, the attackers started to use electronic payment methods and they added more languages to the messages which also changed based on the user's location which was obtained by geo-locating the user's IP addresses. Not only end users are affected by these attacks. Corporations, private entities, government, and even hospitals are also affected. For example, in healthcare (although 2015 was the year in which the largest ePHI data breaches occurred according to the ONC) 2016 was the year that ransomware started to increase exponentially in this market. According to the 2017 Internet Security Threat Report from Symantec Corp, ransomware affects not only IT systems but also patient care, clinical operations, and billing. Online criminals have found ‚Äúthere was easy money to be made in healthcare,‚Äù according to the Symantec report, which was developed with data from insurance claims and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Ransomware is growing rapidly across the internet users but also for the IoT environment which creates a challenging problem to the INFOSEC while increasing the attack surface area. They are evolving into more sophisticated attacks and, they are becoming more resistant; at the same time, they are also more accessible than ever. Today, for a cheap price, the attackers have access to ransomware as a service. The big problem is that millions of dollars are lost by some organizations and industries that have decided to pay, such as the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center and the MedStar Health. At the end, the pressure to offer services to the patients and keep their lives is so critical that they are forced to pay, and the attacker knows that. The problem here is that by paying the ransom, they are funding the cybercrime. According to Symantec 2019 ISTR report, for the first time since 2013, in 2018 there was an observed decrease in ransomware activity with a drop of 20 percent. Before 2017, consumers were the preferred victims, but in 2017 this changed dramatically, it moved to the enterprises. In 2018 this path accelerated with 81 percent infections which represented a 12 percent increase. The common distribution method today is based on email campaigns. The first reported death following a ransomware attack was at a German hospital in October 2020. Cyber awareness training is crucial to detecting attacks, whereas technology cannot protect against careless or foolish behavior.Sjouwerman, S. (2011, 2016). CYBERHEIST: The biggest financial threat facing American businesses since the meltdown of 2008. Clearwater, FL: KnowBe4. It is important for organizations to help their users recognize malicious contact whereas ransomware is typically introduced through email and social engineering techniques to either download a file, provide key sensitive information or take some action that will bring harm to the organization. According to KnowBe4 Osterman report, there are number of approaches to security awareness training that are practiced by organizations and managed by security teams. There is the break room approach which are special meetings periodically held to talk about security; monthly security videos with short snippets of security information; simulated phishing tests which target users with internal phishing messages; human firewall approach where everyone is subject to simulated phishing and those employees that are prone to attack are identified; and then there is the do-nothing approach where cyber awareness training does not exist in the organization.Osterman Research, Inc. (October 2018). \\"Best Practices for Implementing Security Awareness Training\\" [Whitepaper]. KnowBe4. Retrieved fromhttps://www.knowbe4.com/hubfs/Best%20Practices%20for%20Implementing%20Security%20Awareness%20Training%20-%20KnowBe4%20Osterman%20(1).pdf. An effective and successful cyber awareness training program must be sponsored from the top of the organization with supporting policies and procedures which effectively outline ramifications of non-compliance, frequency of training and a process for acknowledgement of training. Without sponsorship from the ‚ÄúC-level‚Äù executives the training cannot be ignored. Other factors that are key to a successful Cyber Awareness Training program is to establish a baseline identifying the level of knowledge of the organization to establish where the users are in their knowledge prior to training and after. Whichever approach an organization decides to implement, it is important that the organization has policies and procedures in place that provide training that is up to date, performed frequently and has the backing of the entire organization from the top down. Investment in technology to detect and stop these threats must be maintained, but along with that we need to remember and focus on our weakest link, which is the user.  Freedom of speech challenges and criminal punishment  The publication of proof-of-concept attack code is common among academic researchers and vulnerability researchers. It teaches the nature of the threat, conveys the gravity of the issues, and enables countermeasures to be devised and put into place. However, lawmakers with the support of law-enforcement bodies are contemplating making the creation of ransomware illegal. In the state of Maryland, the original draft of HB 340 made it a felony to create ransomware, punishable by up to 10 years in prison. However, this provision was removed from the final version of the bill. A minor in Japan was arrested for creating and distributing ransomware code. Young and Yung have had the ANSI C source code to a ransomware cryptotrojan on-line, at cryptovirology.com, since 2005 as part of a cryptovirology book being written. The source code to the cryptotrojan is still live on the Internet and is associated with a draft of Chapter 2.

It is a common plant pest endemic to the Indomalayan realm that has spread to tropical and into subtropical regions around the world, and in isolated populations to temperate climates where protective habitat such as greenhouses provide shelter for individuals inadvertently shipped in the soil of plants. Its populations are almost exclusively female, and it reproduces through parthenogenesis, having evolved several clonal strains from its sexual progenitor P. indicus.  Description  Nymph Adults are around in length, and have dark brown to black bodies with shiny paler brown wings. The front edge of the pronotum (head shield) has a pale white band. While males are rarely produced, male adults have longer wings than females, completely covering the abdomen, although both genders are poor flyers. (The article comprises the whole issue.) Nymphs are around long at birth, translucent white with orange-brown mandibles and spines, and darker eye spots than the rest of the head. The exoskeleton gradually hardens on exposure to air, becoming a glossy brown in 5 to 6 hours, while its underside and legs remain translucent. Older nymphs develop shiny black anterior abdominal segments, and roughened, dull black posterior segments.  Range  P. surinamensis originated in the Indomalayan region and is now cosmopolitan, found around the world in tropical regions, extending into subtropical regions, and temporarily establishing populations in protective habitats in temperate climates, particularly in greenhouses (also called glasshouses) or other areas heated during colder periods. It can be spread to greenhouses with shipments of tropical plants. In the United States it is common in the southeastern region from North Carolina to Texas, in addition to temporary populations in more temperate climates.  Habitat  P. surinamensis is a burrowing cockroach, commonly burrowing in loose soil, humus, mould, compost piles and lawn thatch, or hiding beneath rocks, rotten branches, trash and other debris. It is considered peridomestic, found living only near human constructions or crops in a 1996 study, and may be considered synanthropic. It has a relatively high rate of cutaneous water loss compared to non-burrowing species of cockroaches, and is nearly exclusively associated with moist soil across its range.  Pest  While the species is occasionally found inside homes, it is not a common household pest. It is a plantation and garden pest in tropical regions, and can be especially problematic in heated greenhouses, where large numbers can hide by day and emerge at night, gnawing the softer parts of plants. It is thought to be transferred into homes and businesses in potted plants or mulch used for potted plants. Indoor infestations can often be controlled using sprays or granules on potted plants. Outdoor treatment should focus on infested locations such as wood piles, mulch, and foundation plantings, and a residual barrier spray may be useful around houses.  Parthenogenesis  An unusual aspect of P. surinamensis is that the species reproduces parthenogenetically, a form of asexual reproduction in which embryos develop from unfertilized eggs. P. surinamensis reproduce by thelytokous parthenogenesis, a type of parthenogenesis in which offspring are almost exclusively female clones. Thelytokous parthenesis is known in about 1% of known animal species. Optional thelkytokous parthenogenesis occurs in several cockroach species when females are isolated from males, including in the common domestic pests Blatta orientalis, Blattella germanica, and Periplaneta americana, but in P. surinamensis it is obligatory parthenogenesis, its sole means of reproduction. Earlier taxonomy treated P. surinamensis as a species with both sexual and asexual forms, reproducing asexually in some populations, but sexually in other populations. Roth in 1967 applied the name P. indicus (Fabricius, 1775) to the sexually-reproducing taxon from which the parthenogenetic form P. surinamensis is descended. While P. surinamensis is cosmopolitan, P. indicus is endemic to the Indomalayasian region and adjacent parts of Southeast Asia, and spread just to Hawaiian and Mauritian islands. In P. surinamensis, males are rarely born and are nonfunctional with frequency varying by population. An Australian colony being studied produced several, while none were seen in a Florida colony in over 15 years of study. In a parthenogenetic moth the rate varied by how long a population was stabilized, which suggests the possibility that Australian colony may have developed parthengenesis more recently than the Florida colony. P. surinamensis has at least 21 diploid clones, born independently from sexual females, meaning the thelytokous parthenogenesis has evolved repeatedly. There are also 11 known triploid clones, produced by backcrosses between clones and P. indicus. Different clones have established populations throughout the species' range, with at least ten different clone populations present in the United States alone. Obligatory parthenogenesis was known only in P. surinamensis until 2003, when it was reported in a form of the species Phyllodromica subaptera. Asexual forms of P. subaptera, spread through most Mediterranean countries, are morphologically indistinguishable from the sexual form, found only on the Iberian peninsula, suggesting the trait was relatively recently acquired.  Gestation and birth  Reproduction is usually ovoviviparous, the ootheca carried internally during gestation until nymphs hatch within the body and are delivered, usually at night or in darkness. Occasionally stress or other factors may result in premature release of the ootheca, which can result in non-viability of the eggs. The ootheca itself measures 9x3.5x2.5 mm, housing 30-36 eggs in two rows of alternately spaced segments. Remains of the egg case are expelled around the time the nymphs are being born, sometimes pulled out with the hind limbs, and the ootheca fragments are usually quickly devoured by the newborn nymphs.  Parasite Host  P. surinamensis acts as the intermediate host for the parasitic roundworms Oxyspirura mansoni and Oxyspirura parvorum, which infect the eyes of poultry. O. mansoni, known as the chicken eyeworm among other names, can cause eye problems ranging from mild conjunctivitis to severe ophthalmia and serious vision impairment in its final hosts, which include chickens, turkeys, guineafowl and peafowl. Its life cycle involves eggs passing through a bird's lachrymal duct, being swallowed and passed in the bird's feces, a P. surinamensis cockroach eating the feces, larvae emerging in the cockroach, the bird eating the cockroach, and finally the eye worm larvae migrating up the oesophagus and pharynx to the bird's eye. While O. mansoni is not present in Europe, it is present in many areas of the world, particularly the tropical and subtropical environments where P. surinamensis is permanently established.

He also studied medicine in his youth and became a prominent anthropologist later in life. During World War I, Fejos worked as a medical orderly for the Imperial Austrian Army on the Italian front lines and also managed a theatre that performed for troops. After the war, he returned to Budapest and eventually worked for the Orient- Film production company. He began to direct films in 1919 or 1920 for Mobil Studios in Hungary until he escaped in 1923 to flee the White Terror and the Horthy regime. He made his way to New York City and then eventually to Hollywood where he started production on his first American feature film, The Last Moment, in October 1927. As a major hit, the film allowed him to sign with Universal Studios. After a number of other successful films, Fejos left America in 1931 to direct sound films in France. In 1941 he stopped making films all together and became the Director of Research and the acting head of the Viking Fund. 1897‚Äì1918: Early life Fejos was born in Budapest, Hungary, as P√°l Fej≈ës to parents Desir√© Fej≈ës and his wife Aurora, n√©e Novelly. He had one older sister, Olga Fej≈ës. Like many film directors, Fejos exaggerated or invented myths for large portions of his life story and according to him his father was a captain with the Hussars and his mother was a Lady-in-waiting for the Austrian-Hungarian Empress, and that as a youth Fejos himself was an official of the Imperial Court. The truth was that his mother's family originated from Italy but did have an aristocratic background and his father was a pharmacist in Dunaf√∂ldv√°r. Shortly before Fejos was born his father sold his business and moved the family to Budapest in order to buy a shop there, but died of a heart attack before the new shop was purchased. He was then raised by his mother in his grandparents' home. As a boy he was said to be a smart student and to have loved films from an early age. He was sent to a school run by Piarist Fathers in Veszpr√©m and later to a school in Kecskem√©t.Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 1. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1987. pp. 315‚Äì319. . He eventually studied medicine and in 1921 he received an M.D. from the Royal Hungarian Medical University of Budapest. In 1914 he married his first wife Mara Jankowsky. World War I started soon afterward and Fejos worked as a medical orderly for the Imperial Austrian Army on the Italian front lines. During the war he also managed a theatre that performed for the troops. Some additional myths about Fejos' life that surfaced a year later include that he was an officer in the Hussars, was wounded three times and that he was the first person to pilot a combat airplane in the entire war. After the war Fejos returned to Budapest and began working as a set painter for an opera company and eventually for the Orient- Film production company. He was divorced from his first wife in 1921, allegedly because of his irrational jealousy. 1919‚Äì1926: Early film career Fejos first began directing films in either 1919 or 1920 for Mobil Studios in Hungary. His earliest silent films included P√°n, a fantasy based on the mythological character, Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, based on a play by Oscar Wilde, The Black Captain, a film about police corruption in New York City, The Last of As√®ne Lupin, a remake of the popular American serial film, and The Queen of Spades, based on the novel by Alexander Pushkin. Fejos always saw film as closer to painting than to theatre and was more concerned about issues of light and shadow than story. He also stated at this time that no great film would be made until it could be shot in color. Just as other prominent Hungarian filmmakers like Michael Curtiz and Alexander Korda had done, Fejos left Hungary in 1923 to escape the White Terror and the Horthy regime. He first travelled to Vienna where he was briefly employed by Max Reinhardt, then to Berlin where he worked as an extra on a Fritz Lang's Die Nibelungen. He then moved to Paris where he staged an unsuccessful production of Walter Hasenclever's avant-garde play L'Homme. He finally emigrated to the United States in October 1923. He arrived in New York City penniless and spoke little English, but managed to get several low paying jobs at funeral parlors or piano factories. By the spring of 1924 his English had improved and he managed to get a job as a laboratory technician at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. He earned $80 a week and was employed there for two years. In 1925 he married a co-worker named Mimosa Pfalz, but the marriage lasted only 30 days. While living in New York he did manage to land one theater gig as a technical advisor to ensure the Hungarian atmosphere of an adaptation of Ferenc Moln√°r's The Glass Slipper. In the spring of 1926, Fejos spent his entire life savings of $45 on an old Buick and took a cross country trip to move to Los Angeles in pursuit of a film career there. 1927‚Äì1930: Career as a Hollywood film director When Fejos arrived in Hollywood he once again struggled to get by and only managed to land a few odd jobs working on scripts. Sometimes he would only survive by hitchhiking to Pasadena to steal fruit from orange orchards. On one of his hitchhiking trips he was picked up by a rich, young New Yorker named Edward Spitz, who had recently moved to Hollywood with ambitions to produce films. Fejos told Spitz all about his film career in Hungary and convinced Spitz to finance a film. Spitz agreed to give Fejos $5,000 to make a feature film, which was approximately only about 1% of the average film budget at that time. Fejos managed to work with this small budget and began production on his first American feature in October 1927. He was able to convince actor friends to appear in the film for free with the promise of compensation if it was successful, and even charmed Charlie Chaplin's frequent co-star Georgia Hale to appear in the film with the same promise at a time when Hale was earning $5,000 a week. He hired the inexperienced cameraman Leon Shamroy to shoot the film and rented studio space by the minute instead of by the day. Fejos also utilized sets that had been used for other films and made changes to the script when circumstances changed. When sets or actors were unavailable, Fejos had his crew film close- ups of hands, feet, cars or anything else that stuck him as interesting. Fejos was also able to get free film stock from the DuPont company, which was then trying to compete with the more established Kodak and Agfa companies. Filming lasted for 28 days. The Last Moment starred Otto Matieson as a man who commits suicide by drowning and then remembers the events of his life that lead up to his death in flashbacks. The finished film was seven reels and silent, but contained no title cards. It is currently a lost film, but a review described it as having \\"dizzying wipes, multiple superimpositions and vertiginous camera movements.\\" The Last Moment was released in 1928 and received rave reviews and was a financial hit. Charlie Chaplin praised it and writer Tamar Lane called it \\"one of the most remarkable films that has ever been presented on the screen.\\" With the film's success and Fejos's overnight celebrity status, major studios were suddenly competing for the former vagrant to sign contracts with them. Fejos settled with Universal Studios because its contract offered him complete artistic control. In 1928 Fejos quickly began production on his next and best-known film: Lonesome. The script was written by Edward T. Lowe Jr. and Tom Reed, and was based on a newspaper article about loneliness in the modern American cities. Carl Laemmle Jr. produced the film. In the film Glenn Tryon and Barbara Kent play two lonely New Yorkers who live in adjoining apartments but have never met. They meet by chance at Coney Island and begin a romance, but lose each other only to be reunited at their apartment building. The film was hand-tinted and, after the success of The Jazz Singer, \\"talkie\\" scenes were added after production had finished. The film was another box office hit and its reputation has grown throughout the years. Georges Sadoul called it a precursor to neorealism. Jonathan Rosenbaum praised the film and compared Fejos to such better known contemporaries as F. W. Murnau, Fritz Lang, Sergei Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin. Andrew Sarris has called it \\"a tender love story in its silent passages...[but] crude, clumsy and tediously tongue-tied in its talkie passages.\\" Charles Higham stated that although \\"its visual style, initially attractive, becomes a monotonous succession of busy shots, dissolving over each other in a perpetual flurry...[but] the films charm is real.\\" Fejos's third Hollywood film was The Last Performance, another box office success for Universal Studios in 1929. The film starred Conrad Veidt as a stage magician who falls in love with his assistant and was another part sound, part silent film. Later that year Fejos began production on his largest and most ambitious film: Broadway, based on the hit stage production produced by Jed Harris, George Abbott and Phillip Dunning. Fejos was given a $1 million budget, most of which was spent on the huge cubist nightclub set and on a 28-ton camera crane, which was the largest and most versatilw crane built up to that point. The film starred Glenn Tryon and Evelyn Brent. When released, the film was only a modest success and Fejos considered it a failure. It was remade by William A. Seiter in 1942. Film critic Miles Krueger said that \\"the images of the Paradise Club and the huge musical number (Final in Technicolor) have become basic screen literature.\\" Fejos then began filming the musical Captain of the Guard (AKA Marsellaise) in 1930, the year he became an American citizen. During the shooting of an ambitious sequence with over 300 extras that depicted the storming of the Bastille, Fejos fell from a high scaffolding and suffered a concussion. It took him six weeks in bed to recover and John Stuart Robinson finished the film, with Fejos receiving no screen credit. He then worked on King of Jazz, which was officially directed by John Murray Anderson. Fejos became angry with Universal that once again he did not receive screen credit for his contributions to the film. His frustration with Universal and Hollywood reached its peak when he was not hired to direct All Quiet on the Western Front and Fejos broke his contract with the studio. He signed a contract with Metro Goldwyn Mayer shortly afterwards, but only directed the German and French language versions of The Big House. 1931‚Äì1935: Career as a European film director In 1931 Fejos accepted an invitation from Pierre Braunberger to direct early sound films in France and left Hollywood for good. Fejos complained to a reporter that Hollywood was too commercial and like a drug for the public. He went on to state that the Hollywood-fantasy happy endings simply blinded working people from their hopeless lives and that \\"if the movie theaters were suddenly closed in America, there would be a revolution\\", but that in Europe he hoped for \\"films made in the name of art.\\" Fejos's career in France was short-lived and began with his supervision of Claude Heymann's American Love in 1931. Next Fejos made the ambitious Fant√¥mas, a remake of the famous serial made by Louis Feuillade in the 1910s. In 1932 Fejos returned to Hungary to direct Spring Shower (Tavaszi Z√°por), which some film critics have called his best film. The film stars Annabella as a young girl who is seduced and abandoned, has a child and dies in poverty only to have to scrub floors in Heaven. While in Heaven, she sees that her now-teenage daughter is about to make the same mistake that she made and dumps her wash bucket to cause a rain storm and prevent it. Jonathan Rosenbaum praised the film, stating that it had \\"some magical moments of its own. Much as Lonesome seems indebted to the city and amusement park scenes in Sunrise, the nocturnal lighting and sensuality of Marie's seduction and its mysterious musical aftermath recall certain rustic night scenes in the same film. But unlike the determinism of Murnau's compositions and camera movements, Fejos' anthropological distance and fairy-tale encapsulations imply a different sort of relationship to his characters: the rapid cutting between details in a brothel parlous to convey Marie's confusion before fainting encourages an identification with sensations, not thoughts or feelings. And the beauty of Annabella's performance and a violin-and-clarinet theme may help one overlook some of the more reductive aspects of the folk legend that define the films dimensions.\\" Fejos fell in love with Annabella and supposedly flew over her train back to France in a small plane and showered it with roses. Fejos's friend John W. Dodds has stated that \\"every time [Fejos] moved to another country, it was because of an ending love affair\\" and Fejos would spend the next few years throughout different European countries, often with frequent collaborators Lothar Wolff, his assistant director, and Ferenc Farkas, his composer. Fejos' second Hungarian film was The Verdict of Lake Balaton (It√©l a Balaton) in 1932. In this film Fejos used beautiful documentary-like footage of local fishermen and their everyday lives. The film was highly criticized in Hungary for its depiction of the fisherman and accused of bigotry against village life. In 1933 Fejos moved to Austria and made Ray of Sunshine (Sonnenstrahl), again starring Annabella. The film focused on unemployment and poverty in post-World War I Austria and was praised by critics as \\"the summit of Fejos' art in Europe...too often ignored by the critics.\\" Later that year Fejos made the light comedy Voices of Spring (Fr√ºhlingstimmen). In 1934 Fejos moved to Denmark and made three films for the Nordisk Film company: a light comedy in 1934 called Flight of the millions (Flugten fra millionerne), a farce about a world where there are no prisoners or police officers called Prisoner Number 1 (Fange Nr. 1) in 1935, and an adaptation of playwright Kaj Munk's The Golden Smile (Det Gyldne Smil) about the relationship between art and life in 1935. 1935‚Äì1941: Career as ethnographic filmmaker By 1935 Fejos had grown tired of narrative films and their inauthentic sets and stories. That year he was sent by Nordisk Film to scout filming locations in Madagascar and loved the country so much that he ended up staying for nine months. He filmed over 30,000 feet of footage of animals, plants, tribal societies and local customs, all of which was unusable for a narrative feature. He also collected many artifacts and eventually donated them to the Royal Danish Geographical Society. When he returned to Denmark the unusable footage that he had shot was brought to the attention Svensk Filmindustri's who commissioned a series of six short documentaries to be made from the footage. These films included Black Horizons (Svarta Horisonter), The Dancers of Esira, Beauty Salon in the Jungle, The Most Useful Tree in the World, Sea Devil and The Graves of our Father, all released between 1935 and 1936. In 1936, he married Inga Arvad, a Danish journalist, noted for a romantic relationship with John F. Kennedy and known as the mistress of Axel Wenner-Gren. Arvad had appeared in Flight of the millions and the two remained married until the early 1940s. Inspired by his newfound passion for cultures and history, Fejos studied cultural anthropology at the Museum of Copenhagen in 1936 and studied under Dr. Thompson. He was then commissioned by Svensk Filmindustri to make a series of ethnographic films in such countries as Indonesia, the Philippines, New Guinea, Ceylon and Thailand from 1937 to 1938. These films included A Handful of Rice (En Handfull Ris), Man and Woman (Man och Kvinna), The Tribe Still Lives (Stammen lever √§n), The Bamboo Age of Mentawei (Bambu√•ldern p√• Mentawei), The Chief's Son is Dead (H√∂vdingens son √§r d√∂d), The Komodo Dragon (Draken p√• Komodo) and The Village Near Pleasant Fountain (Byn vid den trivsamma brunnen). In 1938 while returning from filming in Thailand Fejos met Swedish industrialist Axel Wenner-Gren, who would change Fejos' life in the same way that Edward Spitz had ten years earlier. The two men became fast friends and Wenner-Gren agreed to finance an expedition to Peru in late 1939. While in Cusco Fejos was told by a Franciscan friar about a legendary lost city somewhere in the jungle. He immediately contacted Wenner-Gren, who agreed to give additional financing for the expedition. Fejos discovered 18 ancient Incan cities and traveled to the headwaters of the Amazon river. In total, he spent a year in Peru studying the culture and filming the Yagua tribe. His research resulted in Fejos' final series of films Yagua, released in 1940 and 1941. It also resulted in the publication of Ethnology of the Yagua, published by the Viking Fund Series of Publications in Anthropology in 1943. 1941‚Äì1963: Career as anthropologist and final years In 1941, Fejos both stopped making films and travelling to become Director of Research and acting head of the Viking Fund, a non-profit foundation based in New York City and created that same year by Axel Wenner- Gren. It was later renamed the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research. He went on to become highly respected in his field and was considered ahead of his time for calling for communication between various branches of anthropology. During this time Fejos also taught at Stanford, Yale and Columbia University. In 1958 Fejos married anthropologist Lita Binns, who would succeed him as research Director when he died on April 23, 1963. His obituary writer David Bidney said that \\"Paul Fejos had the temperament of an artist rather than a scholar or research scientist...He supported not only research projects but also, and primarily. individuals whom he trusted and considered worthy of support...His personal support of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin during the last years of the life of this eccentric genius is but one outstanding example...He leaves behind him the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research which he built, an international host of friends whom he helped, and a wife whom he cherished and appreciated.\\" Selected filmography *Lord Arthur Savile's Crime (1920) *Stars of Eger (1923) *The Last Performance (1927) *The Last Moment (1928) *Lonesome (1928) *Broadway (1929) *The Big House (1930, German and French versions) * Captain of the Guard (1930) * Men Behind Bars (1931) * American Love (1931) *Fant√¥mas (1932) *Spring Shower (1932) *The Verdict of Lake Balaton (1932) *Voices of Spring (1933) * Flight from the Millions (1934) *The Golden Smile (1935) *Prisoner Number One (1935) * Svarta horisonter (1936, series of 6 short documentaries) * Stammen lever √§n (1937 * Bambu√•ldern p√• Mantaivei (1937) * H√∂vdingens son √§r d√∂d (1937) * Draken p√• Komodo (1937) * Byn vid den trivsamma brunnen (1937) * Tambora (1938) * Att segla √§r n√∂dv√§ndigt (1938) * En handfull ris (1938) * Man och kvinna (1939) *Yagua (1941) Further reading *B√ºttner, Elisabeth (2004).

It the second book of the Homecoming Saga, a fictionalization of the first few hundred years recorded in the Book of Mormon. Plot summary The book focuses on several key events that happen after Nafai, Elemak, Issib, Mebbekew, Zdorab and the father Volemak leave for the desert. Elemak has a dream from the Oversoul, foretelling Volemak's sons going back to the city of Basilica to get wives. The sons proceed to Nafai's and Issib's mother, Rasa, who is attempting to keep order within the city. However Hushidh, a raveler under Rasa's care, makes the disastrous mistake of severing the ties between Rashgallivak and his men, leading to widespread riots across the city. At the same time, General Moozh, leader of the \\"Wetheads\\" nation (Gorayni), is attempting to conquer cities around Basilica. He sees a strategic chance, and taking only 1000 soldiers, marches across the desert to conquer the city. He arrives in time to help the local city guard quell the uprising, and slowly begins taking control of its affairs. The remainder of the book deals with Nafai and his brothers' (Elemak and Mebbekew, who had come) attempts at finding wives. In the end, they are all forced into a house arrest along with Rasa, where Elemak takes Eiadh as his wife, Mebbekew takes Dol, Nafai takes Luet, the waterseer, with Rasa and Hushidh deciding to come as wives for Volemak and Issib, respectively. Shedemei (a Basilican geneticist) is dragged along with enough plants and animals to populate the future earth with new species, also as a wife to Zdorab. The ending comes when Moozh decides to marry Hushidh to politically tie himself with the city. Hushidh's original mother arrives to stop the ceremony, since Hushidh is actually the daughter of Moozh. Nafai's party is escorted out of the city with the women and supplies for the camp. Moozh ends up conquering the \\"Wetheads\\" he had been working for, while his Basilican second-in-command defends the city against the rival nation, Potokgavan. In the end he is killed during an invasion and Basilica falls, scattering the citizens to various other nations and cities on Harmony. Earlier in the book, the Oversoul had revealed the purpose of this dispersal was to force people with a strong connection to it to breed with people who had a weak connection, and so delay the eventual time when the Oversoul loses control of the people of Harmony. Characters The characters listed here are those whose primary role is in The Call of Earth. For other characters, see Homecoming Saga. *General Vozmuzhalnoy Vozmozhno: Better known as Moozh, a leader of the army of the Imperator (a godlike figure). He engineers a takeover of Basilica, freeing it from the lordship of the remains of Gaballufix's men but surreptitiously advancing his own control. Although this starts Basilica on the path to loss of its traditional female-dominated structure, it ends up bringing stability in the short term. Moozh is sensitive to the Oversoul's communication and inducement of \\"stupidity\\", though he believes such sensations to come from God. Since he stubbornly sets himself against \\"God's plans\\", the Oversoul learns the tactic of reverse psychology and pushes Moozh to forget those things that it actually wants him to act on. *Thirsty: A holy woman of the desert, and the mother of Hushidh and Luet. She too hears the Oversoul's commands clearly, and follows them faithfully even as she rages against their unfairness. After leaving her daughters with Rasa, she is left alone by the Oversoul for many years, during which she marries and raises a family. The Oversoul then orders her back to Basilica to reveal the identity of Hushidh's and Luet's father, and deliver the announcement that seals the Oversoul's plan for the city. *General Plodorodnuy: \\"Plod\\", Moozh's 'best friend' and closest confidant. Actually a spy sent to watch him and report his actions to the Imperator, Moozh has him killed and utilizes his death to advance his own ambitions. *Smelost: A Basilican guard. Sent to Moozh's camp to recruit the help of the Gorayni, he ends up faithfully believing in Moozh's strategy - which involves his own death. Smelost takes the blame for the murder of Plod, shouting \\"For Gaballufix! Death to the Imperator!\\" This sets up the Gorayni to oppose Gaballufix.

The company's main focus is on PC accessories, and offers computer memory, computer cases and power supplies, custom cooling solutions and uninterruptible power supplies. The company attracted attention in PC publications when they produced the first modular computer power supply, the Ultra X-Connect. The history of Ultra Products dates back to 1991 with the Fletcher, Ohio based PC builder, MidWest Micro. Ultra was the brand name for MidWest Micro's white-box personal and laptop computers sold through their Infotel computer product distribution division. In late 1997, Global Industrial Products purchased Infotel and the MidWest Micro and continued to sell product under the Ultra brand name. In 1999, Global changed its name to Systemax and Global Industrial became a division of the Systemax corporation. The Ultra Products brand name was expanded to include LCD monitors. In 2002, Systemax was an exclusive U.S. importer of Chieftec brand computer cases. The cases were used for Systemax builds and to DIY users through Systemax's Tiger Direct retail outlet, but in order to move the quantity of product required to import to maintain exclusive distribution rights, Systemax would have to sell to other retails; retailers in direct competition with Tiger Direct. So later in 2002 ChieftecUSA was born. In 2003, Tiger Direct used the Ultra brand to sell computer memory and low-end graphics cards. By mid-2003, the product line expanded to light kits, hard drive, memory and CPU coolers and flash memory card readers. This proved to be successful and the decision was made to put the brand out into the retail channel. It was determined to use the existing ChieftecUSA channels to distribute product, so in late 2003 ChieftecUSA became Ultra Products and could not only be purchased at Tiger Direct, but also Fry's Electronics, Micro Center as well as a number of other retail and mail order computer components dealers. Although technical support is often handled through the Fletcher, Ohio facility, a number of support issues are actually still handled in the Tiger Direct call center in Miami, Florida. In November 2006, Ultra Products received United States Patent Number 7,133,293 for the modular interface Ultra uses on its X-Connect line of power supplies. The patent was filed for in September 2004. In August 2007, the technical support forums at Ultra Product's website was closed and a statement that they were \\"under construction\\" was made on the portal page, yet the link to the forums had been completely removed from the main page's navigation.

It was one of Norfolk's first monasteries and the only one in England to survive the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1530s. Norfolk is a rural county in the East of England. Knowledge of prehistoric Norfolk is limited by a lack of evidence ‚Äî although the earliest finds are from the end of the Lower Paleolithic period. Communities have existed in Norfolk since the last Ice Age and tools, coins and hoards such as those found at Snettisham indicate the presence of an extensive and industrious population. The Iceni tribe inhabited the region prior to the Roman conquest of Britain in 43 AD, after which they built roads, forts, villas and towns. Boudica's rebellion in 60 AD, caused by the imposition of direct rule by the Romans, was followed by order and peace, which lasted until the Roman armies left Britain in 410 AD. The subsequent arrival of the Anglo-Saxons caused the loss of much Roman and British culture in Norfolk. It is known from external evidence from excavations and place- names that by c. 800 AD all Norfolk had been settled and the first towns had emerged. Norfolk was the northern half of the Kingdom of East Anglia and was ruled by the Anglo-Saxon Wuffing dynasty. Our knowledge of several Wuffings is scant, as few historical documents of the period have survived. Under the Normans, Norwich emerged as the hub of the region. With steady growth and strong overseas links it became an important mediaeval city, but it suffered from internal tensions, unsanitary conditions and disastrous fires. Mediaeval Norfolk was the mostly densely populated and the most productive agricultural region in the country. Land was cultivated intensively and the wool trade was sustained by huge flocks. Other industries such as peat extraction were important. Norfolk was a prosperous county and possessed a wealth of monastic establishments and parish churches. Etymology The name \\"Norfolk\\" derives from terms which meant \\"the northern people\\". It is first mentioned in Anglo- Saxon wills dating from 1043‚Äì5 and later as Nor√∞folc in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (the entry for 1075) and as Nordfolc in the Domesday Book.Ekwall, p. 343 Prehistoric Norfolk =Paleolithic to Chalcolithic= Lower Paleolithic (2,500,000 to 300,000 BCE) In 2005 it was discovered that Norfolk contained one of the earliest finds of European man. The find revealed flint tools, similar to those found on the Suffolk coast at Pakefield which were dated at around 668,000 BCE and a find at Happisburgh in the \\"Cromer Forest Bed\\" has been dated as being 550,000 years old and has given us flints, bones and the oldest hand axe to be found in north-west Europe. Middle Paleolithic (300,000 to 30,000 BCE) In 2002 there was a major discovery of one of the most important sites of Neanderthal man, dated to around 58,000 BCE, in the Thetford Forest at Lynford. David Miles the chief archaeologist at English Heritage said: \\"It is extremely rare to find any evidence of Neanderthals and even rarer to find it in association with mammoth remains. We may have discovered a butchery site, or what would be even more exciting, first evidence in Britain of a Neanderthal hunting site which would tell us much about their organisational and social abilities.\\" The site was found to contain organic material and a Mousterian hand axe was found in a good state of preservation. A further 30 Mousterian hand axes were found along with reindeer bones covered in cut marks. The animal remains have revealed the presence of woolly mammoths, woolly rhinoceros, brown bears, spotted hyenas and other smaller remains such as fish jaws, frog bones and several types of mollusc. Although the site contains such exotic animals the temperatures were still below those felt today as Norfolk was still in the clutches of the remnants of an Ice-Age. The average temperature in July has been estimated as 13 ¬∞C and the area would have been below freezing for most of the winter months. From plant and insect remains it has been deduced that the area was marshy and covered with small areas of open still water similar to the modern day broads. Upper Paleolithic (40,000 to 10,000 BCE) During the last Ice age, reaching its greatest extent between 22,000 and 17,000 years ago, the so-called Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)the whole of Britain was either ice sheet or polar desert thus wiping out the entire gene pool. The return of pioneer groups, evidenced by the so-called Creswellian culture, began about 15,000 years ago.Oppenheimer p.120 Neolithic and Chalcolithic (9500 to 3000 BCE) This period covers the stages of change from the pottery of the stoneage into the age of metals. The Chalcolithic Age is the start of the Copper Age and marks the end of the time when people could only work mainly single element metals such as silver, tin, copper and gold. The Copper Age precedes the Bronze Age when metallurgy developed into a science capable of amalgamating metals into bronze and other compounds. =Bronze Age= (3000 to 600 BCE) The Snettisham Hoard, now kept at the British Museum Norfolk was a centre of metalworking and by the Late Bronze Age northern Norfolk had developed into a major area of production. There were also throwbacks to the earlier ages and one such type were the monuments. A significant find was discovered in 1998 between the high and low tidal limits off the north west coast of Norfolk at Holme-next-the-Sea. A ring of timbers was found and within it an upturned tree stump with its roots above the sand. The remains were excavated in 1999 and the samples taken dated it to 2049 BCE. A find at Sutton (near Stalham) on 7 July 1875 revealed a copper alloy shield buried under peat lying on, and covered by, white sand. There have been numerous finds from all periods of the Bronze Age but amongst the most notable were a find of 141 axes heads at Foulsham and pottery including collared urns from the Witton Wood barrow. Grimes Graves is a large and well-preserved group of Neolithic flint mines at a site near Brandon, consisting of 400 pits. It was first named Grim‚Äôs Graves by the Anglo-Saxons and was first excavated in 1870 when the pits were first identified as mines dug over 5,000 years ago.English Heritage website 'Grime's Graves ‚Äì Prehistoric Flint Mine' =Iron Age= There is evidence that much of Norfolk was intensively farmed by people during the Late Iron Age. The Cenimagni tribe who submitted to Caesar in 54 BCE were settled in both lowland and upland Norfolk by this time. They may have been centred in north-west Norfolk, where hoards of coins and torcs have been discovered such as that found at Snettisham. Coins found in the south of the county indicate that the Iceni tribe may have been centred around Thetford by the mid-1st century AD.An Historical Atlas of Norfolk, pp. 22-32 Roman Norfolk A 1905 map of Roman Britain Burgh Castle, the most impressive of the Roman ruins of Norfolk Norfolk's coastline is markedly different from the coastline that existed when the Romans first occupied what is now the county of Norfolk. The northern coast of Norfolk has eroded over the last two millennia, parts of it perhaps having retreated by up to . The eastern coast was dominated by an enormous estuary, the island of Flegg and a peninsula (modern Lothingland). The Wash was much larger in size and the area now known as the Fens was impenetrable marsh containing isolated islands surrounded by water. The River Waveney between Norfolk and Suffolk was at that time a substantial feature.The Land of Boudica The Peddars Way footpath follows the route of a major Roman road across Norfolk. After the Romans conquered Britain in 43 AD, forts and roads were constructed around Norfolk as the Roman army became established. Major Roman roads in the county included the Peddars Way and Pye Road. After a minor rebellion by the Iceni in 47 AD king Prasutagus was allowed to rule independently as a client king. On his death in 60 AD Roman rule was imposed on the territory and his widow Boudica was not allowed to succeed him as Roman law only allowed male heirs to claim a client king's title. After Boudica was humiliated and her daughters raped she led a rebellion in which the towns of Colchester (Camulodunum), London (Londinium) and St. Albans (Verulamium) were sacked. Following the defeat of Boudicca the Romans restored order on the region by establishing an administrative centre at Venta Icenorum (the present Caistor St. Edmund), a small town built at Brampton and other settlements which were developed at river crossings or road junctions. The mostly rural population lived in scattered homesteads, villages or more affluent Roman villas. The level of the sea fell during Roman times and the swamps in the west of Norfolk slowly dried out. The land was then able to be converted into fertile farmland where sheep-rearing and salt production could be established. The Saxon Shore forts were built by the Romans in the 3rd century AD as a defence against overseas raiders. In Norfolk the ruins of the forts built at Burgh Castle (Roman Gariannonum), guarding the estuary across from the island of Flegg, still exist, but there is now little remaining of the forts at Brancaster (Branodunum) built on the north coast, and at Caister-on-Sea, on the east coast and near Burgh Castle. After the last of the armies of Rome had left in 410 AD most of the visible remains of Roman Britain slowly disappeared.An Historical Atlas of Norfolk Anglo-Saxon Norfolk =Occupation and settlement= The kingdom of East Anglia during the early Saxon period The area experienced a depopulation during the fourth century, possibly due to raids from Saxons and Picts. Around 410 AD, Germanic- speaking settlers began to arrive from north-west Europe, thus placing the first phases of the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Norfolk before the supposed landing of Hengist and Horsa in Kent in 449. The migration here likely occurred on a very large scale; however, archaeologist Toby Martin has stressed that the settlers did not arrive as part of a coherent tribal group, and that the self-identification of the people of the region as Angles seems to have emerged from a later period of ethnogenesis.Toby F. Martin, The Cruciform Brooch and Anglo-Saxon England, Boydell and Brewer Press (2015), pp. 174-178 The new culture of the Anglo-Saxons replaced the culture of the Romans and ancient Britons. The number of Brittonic place names in this area is extremely low. Though the first written record of most of the place names in the county is the 11th-century Domesday Book, most were coined at a much earlier date. Places with names ending in -ham in Norfolk (but not those ending -ingham) are generally sited favourably by rivers or near fertile soil and grew in importance from large vills into the county's modern market towns. Comparatively less important settlements tended to end with the suffixes -ton, -wick or -stead.An historical atlas of Norfolk, pp. 36-45 Excavations and place-name evidence indicates that the early Anglo-Saxons (pre-800 AD) seem to have occupied the south and south-west of Norfolk most densely, with settlements concentrated along river systems. A settlement and a cemetery at Spong Hill, containing both graves and inhumation pots, is an example of one of the earliest Anglo-Saxon sites to have been found in Norfolk. During the 7th century East Anglia adopted Christianity and the custom of burying grave goods, found at numerous sites, eventually ceased. Evidence of early Anglo- Saxon settlement exists in the form of Ipswich ware pottery and coins (sceattas) that are unique to the period. Late Anglo-Saxon brooches discovered at Pentney, now on display at the British Museum The Anglo-Saxons eventually expanded across Norfolk. By 850 AD the majority of the county's current pre- Danish placenames had been created, although only two names ‚Äì Deorham (modern West Dereham) Ekwall, p. 142 and Cnobheresburgh (the site of an unidentified monastery on the east coast) ‚Äì exist in early Anglo-Saxon documents. Evidence of the importance of the emerging trade settlements of Thetford and Norwich is still being discovered. Numerous other sites in the county have revealed evidence of Anglo-Saxon settlement, for instance at North Elmham (where there is evidence of timber buildings and roadways), or at Bawsey (with finds of pottery, coins and metalwork). Six late Anglo-Saxon silver brooches were discovered at Pentney in 1978, that may have belonged to a local maker or dealer. Suggestions have been made that higher concentrations of Britons continued to live in the Fenlands. There, some place names containing putatively Celtic elements can be found, such as King's Lynn.Susan Oosthuizen, The Anglo-Saxon Fenland (2017), pp. 42-43 =The kingdom of the East Angles= The Kingdom of the East Angles in about 600 Norfolk was part of the kingdom of the East Angles during much of the Anglo-Saxon period. Its history is largely obscure: much information is based on mediaeval chronicles and often cannot be verified.England, Anglo-Saxon and Danish Kings (introduction) The history of Norfolk, the northern half of the kingdom, cannot be distinguished from the rest of East Anglia during this period. East Anglia was first ruled by semi- historical kings from the Wuffings dynasty, who, according to the 9th-century Historia Brittonum of Nennius, descended to Wuffa of East Anglia from W≈çden.Nennius, History of the Britons In the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the most important historical source for the Anglo-Saxon period, only R√¶dwald of East Anglia and his successors Eorpwald, Anna, √Üthelberht and Edmund the Martyr are mentioned.Anglo-Saxon and Danish Kings, chapter 1 An important source of information is Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, which describes events during the reigns of several East Anglian kings, including Raedwald, the first king who is known by more than a name.Bede, Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum The only surviving lists of the kings of East Anglia are those written by mediaeval sources, such as William of Malmesbury.Anglo-Saxon and Danish Kings Nothing is known about any of the kings from 664 to 747, after which the succession and genealogy of the kings of East Anglia after this time is uncertain. The Vikings attacked Norfolk in 865 and four years later killed Edmund, the last king of the East Angles. Villages on the former island of Flegg with names such as Scratby, Hemsby and Filby provide evidence of Viking settlement: other place-names of Viking origin are scattered around Norfolk. Viking settlement is thought to have stimulated the growth of towns such as Norwich and Thetford. After Edward the Elder conquered East Anglia and ended Viking domination in c. 917, the region was absorbed into the kingdom of England.Williamson (2006), pp. 44-5 Mediaeval Norfolk At the time of the Norman Conquest, Norfolk formed part of the earldom of Harold I of England and offered no active resistance to William the Conqueror, who bestowed the earldom of East Anglia on Ralph de Gael. After the Revolt of the Earls in 1075, Earl Ralph's estates were forfeited and passed to Roger Bigod. =Mediaeval Norwich= Norwich Cathedral, one of the great Norman buildings of England The arrival of the Normans in 1066 led to the destruction of much of Anglo-Saxon Norwich. After Ralph de Gael rebelled against the king, a large part of the town was burned by the Normans in retribution. They then started to develop Norwich into a prosperous international port and a centre of Norman power. Norwich Castle was built by 1075. It was of a motte and bailey type and was rebuilt in stone before 1200. Work on the cathedral precinct started in 1096. Within it was built a cathedral church, a fortified bishop's palace and other monastic buildings. The formation of the precinct turned a large part of the town into an unpopulated area of quarry pits and building yards.Atkin, chapters 5‚Äì7 A mediaeval merchant's house on Elm Hill, Norwich Early mediaeval Norwich grew into a cosmopolitan city and expanded around the waterfront and westwards along St. Benedict's Street. During the 12th century there was a thriving Jewish community, but it was unpopular with the Christian population. In 1144 the Jews were accused of the ritual murder of a young boy named William, who was subsequently canonized. Their synagogue was destroyed in 1286 and four years later all the Jews in England were expelled from the country (see Edict of Expulsion). Tensions between the cathedral priory and the citizens of Norwich (in part over the jurisdiction of land in the city) culminated in the Riot of 1272, in which thirteen members of the priory were murdered and the precinct gates and St. Ethelbert's Church were destroyed. As punishment, the main anarchists were put to death and the city lost its liberties and was forced to pay for the building of a new gate for the priory. Between 1297 and 1344 a new defensive wall was constructed on the huge banks that surrounded the city, replacing the earlier palisade and gates. The area enclosed was the largest for any city in England, although inside was a considerable amount of pasture land, which was slowly absorbed as new monastic settlements, houses, markets and industrial sites appeared. By 1400 Norwich had grown to become a major city of perhaps 10,000 inhabitants. The Black Death may have killed two fifths of the population of the city. It led to efforts to improve the unsanitary conditions, but these had little impact. Immigration from the surrounding countryside soon restored pre-plague numbers, partly as a result of the growing textiles industry. Growing civic wealth and pride was reflected in new large buildings such as the Guildhall, built from 1407 to 1453. During the later mediaeval period, Norwich's fortunes declined. Both the fires of 1412 and 1413 (which destroyed many of the city's buildings) and the Wars of the Roses, contributed to its decline. The period is characterised by a growing gap between the wealthy and the poor of Norwich. =Rural Norfolk during the Middle Ages= Hickling Broad, from Jerrold's 1910 Norwich and the Broads. The Broads were created when huge peat excavations were flooded during the Middle Ages. In the 14th century Norfolk was the most densely populated and most intensively farmed region in England. The land was predominantly arable, much more so than in previous centuries. Where land could not be ploughed easily, it was managed as pasture. The woodlands of much of Norfolk were cleared during mediaeval times. The soils of the county were variously light, heavy and ‚Äì most valuably ‚Äì moderate. The moderately heavy soils were concentrated in central and eastern parts. Crops grown included barley (for making beer), rye, oats and peas. Horses were introduced sooner in Norfolk than elsewhere and crop rotation helped to intensify cultivation. Manorial records show that the types of crops cultivated and animals stocked depended on access to markets, labour supply, freedom from communal controls and transport costs, as well as soil type. In comparison to its arable land, Norfolk's pastures and meadows were less productive.An historical atlas of Norfolk, pp. 48-51 Creake Abbey was founded by the Augustinians in the 12th centuryThe 12th-century keep at Castle Rising As with the rest of the country, the Church was central to mediaeval life in Norfolk. Far more mediaeval parish churches were built than in any other county in England ‚Äì Norwich alone once had sixty-two churches. Over time the numbers have slowly declined, due to depopulation, competition or local reorganisation. Many new monastic communities were established during the Middle Ages. Extensive remains of several religious houses can be seen around Norfolk, such as at North Creake, Binham, Little Walsingham, Castle Acre and Thetford Priory. Over twenty castles were built in Norfolk during the Middle Ages, the most impressive being Norwich Castle, built soon after the Norman Conquest. Many castles, such as those at Great Yarmouth and Lynn, no longer exist: most early castles were small in size and would have been timber-built. The remains of stone castles in Norfolk include those at Castle Rising, Castle Acre and Buckenham: numerous examples of earthwork remains still exist. The Norfolk Broads owe their existence to the large-scale extraction of peat and clay during the Middle Ages. They were once deep pits, up to in depth, from which an enormous amount of peat was dug over a period of centuries. Peat extraction may have begun during the Anglo-Saxon period, but the first evidence of the industry in Norfolk is from mediaeval abbey records. John of Oxnead is the first chronicler to record the major floods that recurred during this period, as the sea breached the vulnerable east coast and devastated the land. As a result of flooding, the extraction of peat declined and the records change from peat- digging accounts to descriptions of fen, marsh, fisheries and the importing of sea-coal from the north-east of England. Over a long period the battle to obtain peat and clay from the pits was steadily lost, as they become water- logged and then permanently flooded and all memory of the origin of the new 'broads' was lost.Malster, chapter 3 In the wars between King John and his barons Roger Bigod garrisoned Norwich Castle against the king, who in 1216 on his retreat from Lynn lost his baggage in The Wash. Norfolk returned members to parliament in 1290, and in 1298 the county and the boroughs of Kings Lynn, Norwich and Great Yarmouth returned each two members. The story of Julian of Norwich (1342 ‚Äì c. 1429) also dates to this period. She is noted as being the first woman to have written a book in English. The Battle of North Walsham occurred on 25 or 26 June 1381.Dobson, The Peasants' Revolt of 1381, 1970. It marked the end of military resistance in Norfolk during the Peasants' Revolt. The rebels led by the 'King of the Commons' Geoffrey Litster were defeated by a force led by Henry le Despenser, Bishop of Norwich: the site is one of only five known battlefields in Norfolk. Norfolk Heritage Explorer website (search results for battlefields in Norfolk) Another legend from Norfolk dating to this period is the Pedlar of Swaffham. The legacy of this tale can be seen to this day in the choir area of the church. Here stand two wooden pews. One has the carvings of a pedlar and his dog, the other of a woman looking over the door of a shop. Norfolk during the Tudors and the Stuarts =Ketts Rebellion (1549)= Norwich at the time of Kett's Rebellion After the enclosures of local landowners around Norfolk were destroyed, thousands of people joined Robert Kett in a march on Norwich, forming a large organised camp at Mousehold Heath in July 1549. The rebellion was largely in response to the enclosure of land, the theft of common resources, and the general abuses of power by the nobility. After a failed attempt by the authorities to disperse them on the offer of a general pardon, Norwich's city gates were shut to the rebels, who nevertheless managed to breach the defences and occupy the city. In London, the government responded to the crisis by sending the Marquess of Northampton to regain Norwich, who initially entered the city unopposed, but was forced by the rebels to withdraw with his army to Cambridge. From this point, Kett was less successful. He failed in an attempt to spread the rebellion to Great Yarmouth. The Earl of Warwick reached Norwich and gained entry to the city with a large force. Although outnumbered, Kett's men rejected an offer of pardon and after bloody street fighting they were forced to return to Mousehold Heath. Kett made an attempt to recapture the city, but the arrival of mercenaries in support of Warwick forced him to abandon the camp. In a bloody pitched battle outside the city on 27 August 1549, the rebels were routed and Kett was captured.https://archive.org/stream/kettsrebellioni00russgoog#page/n0/mode/2up He was later convicted of treason and hanged from the walls of Norwich Castle. https://www.britainexpress.com/History/tudor/ketts-rebellion.htm, Kett's Rebellionhttp://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/robert_ket_and_the_norfolk_risin.htm, ROBERT KET AND THE NORFOLK RISINGhttps://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/may/20/radicalism-rebellion-and- robert-kett-a-walk-through-norwichs-history, Radicalism, rebellion and Robert Kett: a walk through Norwich‚Äôs history =Norfolk during the English Civil War= A detailed map of Norfolk during the 17th century by Wenceslas Hollar The county supported Parliament during the English Civil War, although there was a strong element of Royalist support. The defences of Norwich and the main ports were strengthened and in December 1642 the Eastern Association was formed to place the region on a war footing, but little blood was shed in Norfolk, which was held by Parliament throughout the war.Norfolk in the Civil War, pp. 156-60 In September 1643, an anti-Papist mob caused considerable damage to Norwich Cathedral, which was occupied by troops the following year. According to Joseph Hall, > \\"In a kind of sacrilegious and profane procession all the organ pipes, > vestments, both copes, together with the wooden cross which had been newly > sawn down from over the Green Yard pulpit, and the service books and singing > books that could be had, were carried to the fire in the public market > place. Near the public cross all these monuments of idolatry must be > sacrificed to the fire...\\" http://www.cathedral.org.uk/learning/pupil-pages- > the-civil-war-and-the-cathedral.aspx The only serious fighting in Norfolk during the civil war was at King's Lynn, where Royalist sympathies were strongest. In April 1643 Parliament investigated King's Lynn and ordered the detention of the town's prominent Royalists. That August, on the assurance that Royalist forces would soon arrive, the town declared openly for the King. It was besieged by the Earl of Manchester and suffered damage from bombardment, but Parliament's attempts to raise sufficient forces was beset by difficulties and the town surrendered only after Manchester declared that on 16 September he would storm the defences. Any Royalist hopes of assisting the King in Norfolk ended.The Civil War in Norfolk, pages 187, 209, 215 In 1646 a series of events began that would lead to one of the Norfolk's most noteworthy disasters. Tension had been growing in the county due to rising taxation in the face of rising grain prices, coupled with increasing amounts of interference by the central government in county affairs.Scott E. Hendrix, Riot and Resistance in County Norfolk, 1646‚Äì1650: The Road to Rebellion in Seventeenth-Century Britain, chpt. 3. This led to numerous acts of resistance across the county in 1646, including rioting in Norfolk and King's Lynn.Riot and Resistance in County Norfolk, chpt. 4 The county's largest city, Norwich, was divided between supporters of the traditional culture and Puritans. In 1647 the city's citizens elected John Utting, an act that angered local Puritans, who managed to obtain orders for him to be detained in London.The Civil War in Norfolk, p. 334 Although some historians refer to Utting as a royalist, Scott E. Hendrix argues that the situation was more complicated than that. In his 2012 study of events in the county, he argues that Utting was a supporter of traditional culture rather than a supporter of the king, which included good fellowship in taverns, plays, and other traditional forms of entertainment. Furthermore, he saw no reason to ban traditional holidays, such as Christmas, a move supported by many of the city's apprentices, though it infuriated Norwich's Puritans. When a Parliamentary representative attempted to arrest Utting, the situation became literally explosive. On 24 April 1648 angry townsfolk in Norwich rioted and attacked the homes of prominent Puritans. The news of the arrival of troops to restore order incensed the people and in their search for arms they stormed the County Committee headquarters. There followed a period of great confusion, during which time rioters attached the homes of leading Puritan aldermen and that of Sheriff Thomas Ashwell. A small contingent of Parliamentary troops arrived and managed to gain entry into the city, leading to running battles along St. Stephens street. During this confused period, rioters who had taken possession of the armory contained in the Royalist Committee House on Bethel Street accidentally ignited the barrels of black powder stored there, leading to a tremendous explosion causing immense destruction to the city and great loss of life.The Civil War in Norfolk, p. 343; Riot and Resistance in County Norfolk, chpt. 4 This explosion came to be known as \\"The Great Blow,\\" bringing the rioting in the city to an abrupt standstill. 18th-century Norfolk 1785 and 1786 saw the first aviation activity in the county of Norfolk, when several manned gas balloon flights were made from Quantrell's Gardens in Norwich. 19th-century Norfolk Melton Constable Hall, was once part of a large estate, owned since the 13th century by the Astley family until it was sold in 1956. In the middle of the 19th century, over a hundred Norfolk families owned estates greater than in size, and there were numerous smaller landowners in the county. After 1875, a long depression in English agriculture and industry set in, which reduced estate incomes and put severe pressure on their owners,Barnes, pp. 12-5 a situation made worse by the accumulation of debts due to family settlements or extravagant expenditure, often sustained over generations, and the introduction of Death Duties in 1894.Barnes, p. 55 Endebted landowners were forced to sell their possessions, let their estates for shooting, reduce staff levels or take up residence elsewhere. Estates became neglected as their owners strived to save money and many estates disappeared as farms, parks and woodland were sold off and halls were left to decay. After 1880 many larger estates changed hands, were broken up or reduced in size Barnes, pp. 24, 29, 38 as land was acquired by farmers and businessmen from outside the county. A housing boon during the 1890s driven by a dramatic increase in Norfolk's population enabled some landowners on the outskirts of towns and coastal resorts to profit from the sale of their land.Barnes, pp. 62-4 the Norfolk Broads in the 1880s Norwich Castle and cattle market at the end of the 19th century 20th-century Norfolk The First World War was significant to the county of Norfolk in a number of ways. Large numbers of men of fighting age were called up to join local regiments that were sent to fight in France, virtually every Norfolk village has a war memorial that records the names of those who lost their lives. The war was the first time that significant aviation activity spread throughout the county with a large number of aerodromes and landing grounds being built. Significantly Pulham Market in the south of the county was one of the few locations where airships were stationed. Boulton and Paul in Norwich and Savages of Kings Lynn were both involved in aircraft production each company producing many hundreds of aircraft for the war effort, Boulton and Paul exists to the present time as a joinery company and remained in aviation as late as the 1960s. As well as Boulton and Paul, the firm of Lawrence Scott & Electromotors was also involved in the war effort, providing shells as well as electrical motors and other components for the Navy. The county was one of the first places on earth bombed from the air when German Zeppelin airships raided the county a number of times. Late in the war Zeppelin L70 was shot down off the Norfolk Coast by Major Egbert Cadbury of the Royal Air Force, on board the doomed Zeppelin was Fregatenkapitan Peter Strasser, commander of the German Naval Airship Service, all on board were killed, a number of the men being buried in churchyards along the coast.

Background Elizur Holyoke arrived in the Massachusetts Bay Colony from the town of Tamworth in Staffordshire, England in 1637 or 1638 at the age of 20. He and his family settled in Chelsea, Massachusetts, where his father, Edward Holyoke Jr., had a farm. His mother was Prudence Stockton. On September 20, 1640, Elizur Holyoke traveled to Springfield, Massachusetts and married Mary Pynchon, daughter of William Pynchon, the founder of Springfield. The Holyoke and Pynchon families appeared to be close friends, dating back to their days in England. Elizur and Mary Pynchon's marriage was the first for the then small community. (2) In 1642, Elizur received 10 \\"rods\\" (Properly interpreted as a rood; commonly, and confusingly, spelled as \\"rod.\\" A rod is a unit of length, while a rood is the corresponding unit of area. The area given to Elizur was roughly equivalent to 2¬Ω acres (1 hectare), near the present-day location of Chestnut Street in Springfield. In 1643, other desirable lots were given to Elizur by his father-in-law, one being between what is now Worthington and Bridge Streets. Facsimile of the 1636 deed between and 13 Pocomtuc tribesmen for the establishment of Springfield, previously Agawam Plantations, written in the hand of Elizur Holyoke, who served as the settlement's scribe Land issues In 1647, Elizur was the second largest land owner in Springfield, at . William Pynchon had . After William Pynchon's problems with the General Court of Boston and his eventual retreat to England, William's son John Pynchon and Elizur Holyoke took control of Springfield, and in 1652 Elizur was appointed commissioner to govern the town of Springfield. (2) In 1660, after the founding of Hadley and Northampton, a question arose regarding the exact borders of Springfield. The general court of Springfield sent out two surveying parties to explore the surrounding regions. Elizur Holyoke served as head of one of these parties, while Rowland Thomas headed the other party. While Holyoke traversed the east side of the Connecticut River, Thomas explored the west side of the river. Lore holds that the two held a conversation over a narrow part of the river near Hockanum. =Mount Holyoke= It is commonly stated that Holyoke and Thomas gave their names to the mountains that stood at the end of their paths. Mount Holyoke was named by Elizur Holyoke, while Rowland Thomas named Mount Tom, originally called Mount Thomas, later shortened to Mt. Tom. Career In 1661, Elizur was chosen as Springfield's deputy to the General Court; 1662, he was appointed associate county judge - recorder of all courts; 1663, made the rank of Captain, and was a selectman and deputy to the general court; in 1675, the Holyoke home was destroyed during a raid by Indians led by Wequogan. During the King Philip's War, Capt. Elizur Holyoke was in command of the successful defense of Springfield, until his death in 1676, one account says not due directly to any injury. However, there are other accounts that say he was killed by the Wampanoag Indians on 5 Feb 1676.

Among those involved in its development were prominent citizens such as Albert Ballin (Director General), Adolph Godeffroy, Ferdinand Laeisz, Carl Woermann, August Bolten, and others, and its main financial backers were Berenberg Bank and H. J. Merck & Co. It soon developed into the largest German, and at times the world's largest, shipping company, serving the market created by German immigration to the United States and later immigration from Eastern Europe. On 1 September 1970, after 123 years of independent existence, HAPAG merged with the Bremen-based North German Lloyd to form Hapag-Lloyd AG. 350x350px History =Ports served= A postcard of the view from the water of the Hamburg-American Steamship Lines docks in Hoboken, New Jersey, in about 1910. Postcard from the Hamburg-American Line steamship K√∂nig Friedrich August, issued 1911 Promotion of the Hamburg-American Line (1930) In the early years, the Hamburg America Line exclusively connected European ports with North American ports, such as Hoboken, New Jersey, or New Orleans, Louisiana. With time, however, the company established lines to all continents. The company built a large ocean liner terminal at Cuxhaven, Germany, in 1900. Connected directly to Hamburg by a dedicated railway line and station, the HAPAG Terminal at Cuxhaven served as the major departure point for German and European immigrants to North America until 1969 when ocean liner travel ceased. Today it serves as a museum and cruise ship terminal.Hapag Halle Museum Cuxhaven =Atlas Service= The Atlas Service sailed from New York to Jamaica, Haiti, Colombia, Central America. The service was described as a way to \\"escape the rigors of Northern winters\\" through taking a Caribbean cruise and was promoted to tourists. The ships Altai, Sarnia, Sibiria, Alleghany, Alene, Adirondack, Valdivia, and Graecia provided this service in 1906. =Notable journeys= In 1858, its liner sank, killing 449 people. In 1891, the cruise of the Augusta Victoria in the Mediterranean and the Near East from 22 January to 22 March, with 241 passengers including Albert Ballin and wife, is often stated to have been the first passenger cruise. Christian Wilhelm Allers published an illustrated account of it as \\"Bakschisch\\". In 1897, its steamer Arcadia was wrecked on the rocks off Newfoundland. In 1900, 1901 and 1903 its liner won the Blue Riband taking the prize from the Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse. In 1906 Prinzessin Victoria Luise ran aground off the coast of Jamaica. No lives were lost by the grounding; however, the ship's captain committed suicide after getting all the passengers safely off the ship. In 1912, its liner SS Amerika was the first ship to warn of icebergs. HAPAG's general director, Albert Ballin, believed that safety, size, comfort and luxury would always win out over speed. Thus he conceived the three largest liners yet to be built, named the Imperator, Vaterland and Bismarck. First World War The Imperator and the Vaterland were briefly in service before the First World War. In 1914, the Vaterland was caught in port at Hoboken, New Jersey at the outbreak of World War I and interned by the United States. She was seized, renamed Leviathan after the declaration of war on Germany in 1917, and served for the duration and beyond as a troopship. In 1917, its liner Allemannia was \\"torpedoed by German submarine near Alicante\\"; two people were lost. Post war reparations After the war, the Vaterland/Leviathan was retained by the Americans as war reparations. In 1919 Vaterlands sister ships ‚Äì Imperator and the unfinished Bismarck ‚Äì were handed over to the allies as war reparations to Britain. They were sold to the Cunard Line and White Star Line respectively, and renamed Berengaria and Majestic. In 1939, the HAPAG liner St. Louis was unable to find a port in Cuba, the United States, or Canada willing to accept the more than 950 Jewish refugees on board and had to return to Europe. On 9 April 1940, when German warships attacked Kristiansand, Norway, during Operation Weser√ºbung (the opening assault of the Norwegian Campaign), the HAPAG freighter Seattle sailed into the crossfire between the warships and Norwegian coastal artillery. She was holed and sunk, and her crew briefly became prisoners of war. =Later years= The Hamburg America Line lost almost the entirety of its fleet twice, as a result of World Wars I and II. In 1970, the company merged with its longstanding rival, Norddeutscher Lloyd of Bremen, to establish the present-day company Hapag-Lloyd.

Asian cockroach. Blattella asahinai Mizukubo. Featured Creatures. March 2008. Last accessed 2008-08-08 It is a small species of cockroach, and typically are 1.3 to 1.6 cm long and is tan to dark brown in colour with dark parallel stripes on the back of their head. It is commonly mistaken with the German cockroach (Blattella germenica) for their similar appearance. It is commonly found in the United States in and around houses. Characteristics and appearance The Asian cockroach is nearly identical to the German cockroach (Blattella germanica) except for a few minor morphological differences. Like the German cockroach, it is about long, is tan to brown in color, and has wings. However, its wings are longer than the German cockroach, and a difference is seen between a groove in the abdomen between the two species. The quickest way to tell the difference between the two species is that the Asian cockroach is a strong flyer (almost like a moth) and is attracted to light, unlike the German cockroach. This species tends to prefer the outdoors, whereas the German cockroach prefers living indoors. The Asian and German cockroach look identical to the naked eye as they both have tan and dark features as well as two parallel stripes behind the head. The almost identical appearance has caused concerns and issues with the pest management industries when determining the strategies of pest control as pesticides for German cockroaches are not always effective for Asian cockroaches. To differentiate between the two cockroaches with the naked eye, there are noticeable parts of each cockroach. The ventral surface of the left mandible, the vein coloration of the right tegmen, the wing size and venation as well as the setal marginal bristles on the cerci are the slight morphological differences between the Asian and German cockroach. Asian cockroach: Nymph specimen  History and distribution  The Asian cockroach was first cited and documented in Okinawa Island, Japan in 1981 by Dr. Takayuki Mizukubo, from the National Institute of Agro-Environmental Sciences. The introduction of the exotic Asian cockroach to the United States was in 1986 in Lakeland, Florida but was first believed to be German cockroach. It was believed that the Asian cockroach came to Florida through the import of goods from Japan. On March 3, 1986, Dr Louis M. Roth received cockroaches of Lakeland, Florida from Dr Philip G. Koehler of Florida Extension Services of the University of Florida for inspection. It was noted that a pest control worker referred to them as \\"German cockroaches\\" but could fly readily and were common outdoors. The only two species of Blattella present in the United States were the Field cockroach (Blattella vaga) and the German cockroach (Blattella germanica). Roth was unaware of the species Blatella asahinai but discovered it and sent several Lakeland specimens to Dr. Mizukubo and he concluded they were Blatella asahinai. Further testing was implemented by the Center for Urban and Structural Entomology from Texas A&M; University in September 2007 where they tested the two species through an ethological, morphological and genetic approach in order to confirm the presence of the Asian cockroach in Harris County, Texas. Evaluations of DNA gene sequence were tested which resulted in being similar to the German cockroach. It was evaluated that environmental factors play a significant role in determining the two species although there are slight morphological differences. It was confirmed that Asian Cockroaches were discovered in Harris County, Texas in May 2006 around the Barker Reservoir found in both urban and undeveloped areas. These cockroaches were later cited in Hunter‚Äôs Creek subdivision in Houston. The Asian cockroach has since expanded throughout much of Florida and is spreading into other southern states. In addition to Florida, it is reported in Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and Texas. In Dothan, Alabama in 2003, there were several reports that stated there were \\"flying German cockroaches\\" from Alabama Cooperative Extension System agents, where specimens were obtained for identification. Using a male specimen and comparing to the description of Dr. Mizukubo and Dr. Roth confirmed that the specimens were Asian cockroaches.  Habitat and behaviour  Asian cockroaches are predominantly found outdoors in shaded mulched, composted areas where fresh plant litter accumulates as well as in damp areas. Large areas of grass or leaf litter are what the Asian cockroach gravitates towards. When the Asian cockroach is happy with the chosen location, they are the dominant cockroach and take over the location where they tend to form hordes of 30,000 to 250,000 cockroaches per acre. Its population reaches its zenith in late August and declines rapidly with the onset of cool weather. Asian Cockroaches are the most active at dusk and are attracted to light-coloured surfaces and bright lights. This means at dusk, the Asian cockroach may fly towards the home and enter through open doors and windows but indoor invasions occur rarely. While in the home, the Asian cockroach is most likely found sitting on the TV screen or near lamps. While other cockroaches carry diseases and bacterium, as of today, research has not suggested that the Asian cockroach carries any pathogens or diseases. Although, they do come into contact with other bacteria due to their habitat preferences being around homes with outdoor pathogens, animal feces, and fungi. = Mulch preferences = Leaf litter of all kinds is where the Asian cockroach is most commonly found. In the Southern states of America, typical mulch types include cypress, oak leaf litter, pine, rubber, and topsoil. As leaf litter is used as domestic mulching for general purpose landscaping, using this type of mulch can affect how dense indoor populations of the Asian cockroach can be. They are predominantly a nocturnal species of cockroach, although they live and breed outdoors, they are attracted to light sources will find their way into buildings. These can include homes, office buildings, and restaurants. The Asian cockroach stays clear of topsoil and rubber mulch and has very little interaction with cypress mulch. During adverse weather conditions such as cold weather or dry conditions, the Asian cockroach burrows down into the leaf litter.  Diet  The Asian cockroach is similar to most cockroach species, in that these pests are omnivores and will eat anything they can find. They have been observed to eat human food, pet food, flowers and agricultural crops. Common agricultural crops such as soybeans and cotton are where the Asian cockroaches are found feeding on prey. They have also been sighted feeding on lettuce, cabbage, and strawberries.  German cockroach comparison  The Asian cockroach is the closest discovered relative of the German cockroach, the predominant cockroach pest in America and some parts of the world. = Behaviour = The Asian cockroach has longer but narrower wings than the German cockroach. It can be observed flying, predominantly its preferred choice of movement especially when disturbed, and to move around compared with the German cockroach, which can be rarely seen flying, merely fluttering its wings ineffectively. The other main difference between the two species is its reaction to light sources, the Asian cockroach is naturally attracted to light compared to the German cockroach which scatters away in the presence of bright light. = Reproduction and life cycle = Asian cockroaches and field cockroaches are similar ecologically in comparison to the German cockroach due to both these species breeding outdoors. Both the female Asian and German cockroach carry their egg capsules (oothecae) with them until the eggs hatch but female Asian cockroaches produces fewer oothecae in comparison to the German cockroach, producing approximately four oothecae in their lifetime, each averaging 35 - 40 eggs. Asian Cockroaches have longer initial and subsequent pre-oviposition periods than its German counterpart, and their eggs require slightly longer time to hatch. Asian adult females produce their first egg ootheca approximately 13 days after becoming an adult, and the period from when the ootheca first appeared to hatching is approximately 19 days. The female German cockroach can produce an Ootheca after approximately 8 days after becoming an adult with an incubation period of approximately 17 days. The oothecae of the Asian cockroach appears slightly smaller than that of the German cockroach as well as once hatched, the Asian cockroach is notably smaller than the German cockroach at the time of its first instar. The Asian cockroach is most fertile from February to May as well as in August through to September. Shortly after hatching, nymph cockroaches turn from white to brown and their skin hardens. Asian cockroach females requires 60 - 70 days to become an adult, slightly longer than the males. The lifetime of male and female Asian Cockroaches are approximately 50 and 100 days respectively, compared with the German cockroach which lives on average 130 for males and 150 days for females. An occasion where an Asian and German cockroach mate with one another is extremely rare due to the behavioural differences of the two species but can occur. On the rare occasion this does occur and produce viable offspring, it has the ability to fly and have the insecticide resistance the German cockroach possesses. Beneficial insect Asian cockroach on a soybean crop leaf In 2006, Entomologist Robert Pfannenstiel conducted research on the ecology of predators of crop pests in Texas, in particular the Asian cockroach. Asian cockroaches ventured west into Texas in 2006, and became the most common predator of bollworm eggs in the state's Rio Grande Valley region. The bollworm threatens cotton, soybean, corn, and tomato crops. Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) and Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) are leading predators of soybean crops in Southern Texas. They are part of the Lepidopteran order including butterflies, moths, and skippers. Their eggs were placed on the leaves of soybean crops, without pesticides, and were observed in 3-hour increments over 24 hours to observe both the night and day behaviour of predators towards the pests of the crops. From 2001 to 2005 similar tests were conducted on the predation of Lepidopteran eggs but no observations of the Asian cockroach were found conclude any findings. In 2006, nymph and adult Asian cockroaches were observed feeding on H. zea and S. exigua from both the canopy and leaf litter of the crops and made up 53.7% of all predators feeding on the eggs.  Pest status  The Asian cockroach is a foreign pest during the peak adult populations during summer and spring in Florida which lives in the garden where it is in contact with animal feces, soil-borne pathogens and other disease-causing microorganisms. If the Asian cockroach enters the home, they may walk upon kitchen tops and pantry, as well as any other commonly used surfaces where they can physically contaminate the food with the pathogens that an individual cockroach may carry. The German cockroach has feces and body parts that can possibly be allergic to humans and the Asian cockroach may possess similar traits and pose the same health issue to these individuals. It is important to take immediate action in the control of the Asian cockroach when found indoors. While the Asian cockroach has invaded the home, it moves from room to room, following the light source. This may cause the common misconception that the Asian cockroach is trying to attack the person.  Control and management  Although the Asian cockroach prefers to outdoors as its habitat, they are often drawn to houses due to light sources. Restaurants have implemented control measures such as Integrated Pest Management programs (IPM) which target the German cockroach. Due to the similarities to the German cockroach and if proper identification is not made of the Asian species, restaurants and homeowners may use pesticide treatments that are ineffective to the Asian cockroach, exposing the individuals to unnecessary pesticide residues and IPM programs. Indoor cockroach insecticides are generally ineffective in killing the Asian cockroach and will only control the ones that have entered the house but are difficult to contain once penetrating a location. They are fast and nimble, and are difficult to kill on the spot. In order to control and manage the Asian cockroach, garden or outdoor area maintenance of homes with excess mulch and plant debris is an effective approach to reduce further population. Preventative measures for insects including sealing cracks or crevices in the floor or walls are unnecessary as Asian cockroaches can fly into buildings through open windows or doors. The use of outdoor insecticides offers another option to Asian cockroach management. √ü-cyfluthrin and fipronil granules are insecticides that were highly toxic to the Asian cockroach taking on average 20 minutes and 11 hours respectively to kill the cockroach compared to an MotherEarth Exempt Concentrate natural essential oil which can take up to 11.45 days to kill the cockroach. Scatter baits have been purposely developed for the control of the Asian cockroach and has proven to be effective whereas indoor applications of insecticides have proven to be ineffective to control the population.

His work on dating geomagnetic reversals, with Richard Doell and Brent Dalrymple, made a major contribution to the theory of plate tectonics. Allan Cox won numerous awards, including the prestigious Vetlesen Prize, and was the president of the American Geophysical Union. He was the author of over a hundred scientific papers, and the author or editor of two books on plate tectonics. On January 27, 1987, Cox died in an apparent suicide. Biography Cox began studying chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. However, after a single quarter he left school and spent three years in the United States Merchant Marine. He returned to Berkeley, but had so little interest in chemistry that his grades were too low to avoid being drafted into the United States Army. When he returned, he switched his major to geology. His research career in geology began in 1950 when he took a position as a field assistant to Clyde Wahrhaftig studying glaciation in the Alaska Range; the pair later had a long romantic relationship. For his graduate research at the University of California, Berkeley, Cox concentrated on rock magnetism with John Verhoogen as his supervisor. Verhoogen was one of the few geologists of the time who took the hypothesis of continental drift seriously. His stance made a deep impression on Cox. After receiving his Ph.D. in 1959, Cox joined the United States Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California. There he collaborated with another geophysicist, Richard Doell, on rock magnetism. The two were particularly interested in geomagnetic reversals. At the time, very little was known about the timing of reversals. The rock specimens they collected were too young (a few millions of years) to date accurately until the potassium-argon dating method was developed. Cox and Doell arranged for the USGS to hire Brent Dalrymple, a graduate from Berkeley with expertise in this method. The three succeeded in creating the first geomagnetic polarity time scale. This work made possible the first test, by Frederick Vine and Drummond Matthews, of the seafloor spreading hypothesis. Cox was hired as a professor at Stanford University in 1967. He became Dean of the School of Earth Sciences in 1979 and demonstrated a talent for administration that was widely acknowledged by his colleagues. Cox died in a bicycle accident, colliding with a large redwood tree after falling off a cliff on Tunitas Creek road, in the mountains Northwest of Stanford University. The San Mateo County coroner concluded that Cox's death was a suicide. Cox was normally very safety conscious and had exceptionally not worn a helmet on that day. Cox's death came five days after he learned he was going to be charged with child molestation. Cox allegedly had repeatedly molested the son of one of his graduate students. Cox had told the father of the molested child that he would kill himself if the allegations were reported to the police. Honors Cox was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. In 1969 the American Geophysical Union awarded him the John Adam Fleming medal for research in geomagnetism;. In 1970 he was awarded the prestigious Vetlesen Prize, along with G. Brent Dalrymple, Richard Doell and S. Keith Runcorn, for contributions to geology and geophysics. In 1976 the Geological Society of America awarded him the Arthur L. Day Medal for the application of physics and chemistry to the solution of geologic problems. He was the president of the American Geophysical Union from 1978 to 1980. In 1984 the United States National Academy of Sciences awarded him the Arthur L. Day Prize and Lectureship. After his death, a number of memorials to him were created. The American Geophysical Union had the annual Allan Cox Lecture from 1998 to 2001; this lecture was replaced by the Edward Bullard lecture.

Biography Claire de Duras left her native France for London during the French Revolution in 1789, and returned to France in 1808 as the Duchess of Duras. She maintained a famous literary salon in post- Revolutionary Paris and was the close friend of Chateaubriand, who she had met while in exile in London, and who helped her to publish her books. Ourika was published anonymously in 1823, one of five novels Claire de Duras had written during the previous year; only two of them were published during her lifetime. The three novellas that she did publish were only done so in order to prevent any possible plagiarism. Claire de Duras treated complex and controversial subjects, primarily dealing with oppressed/marginalized characters. She explored many fundamental principles of the French Revolution, and touched upon the intellectual debates of the Age of Enlightenment, particularly the equality of all men‚Äîand women. In holding with these subjects, tragedy is a common theme. For a long time she was seen as the writer of small and unimportant sentimental novels, but recent criticism has revealed her works to be treasure troves of postmodern identity theory.

Career Born in H√∂sbach, Neumayr started his football career playing for local clubs before moving to Eintracht Frankfurt in 2003 However, within a few months, he was picked up by Manchester United. During his spell with Manchester United, he played on the right side of midfield, although on some occasions he would play in the middle of the park. In the three seasons Neumayr spent at Old Trafford, he never played in a match for the first team. He was once called into the squad on 29 March 2006 for the match against West Ham United but did not make the final sixteen.

Though productions can feature any type of ethnic group (Caucasian, Asian, Black, Native American), the most common emphasis is on relationships between white- and black-skinned individuals. Interracial pornography in the United States  Interracial pornography features performers of differing racial and ethnic backgrounds and often employs ethnic and racial stereotypes in its depiction of performers. Behind the Green Door (1972) was one of the first pornographic films to feature sex between a white actress (Marilyn Chambers) and a black actor (Johnnie Keyes). In the past, some of American pornography's white actresses were allegedly warned to avoid African American males, both on- screen and in their personal lives. One rationale was the purportedly widespread belief that appearing in interracial pornography would ruin a white performer's career, although some observers have said that there is no evidence that this is true. Adult Video News critic Sheldon Ranz wrote in 1997 that: On the other hand, some commentators have pointed out that the lack of racial divide and \\"nonsense about 'attraction' and 'preference'\\" in the European pornographic scene allowed many top European female performers to appear in American interracial pornographic films. Lexington Steele told The Root in a 2013 interview that white female performers who appear in interracial pornography may conceal their careers due to social pressure from their intimates, arguing \\"It's just an element of American culture that still exists, and that is the feeling that a white female will be deflowered or soiled, if you will, by doing a scene with a black male\\". According to a survey by Jon Millward, while 87% of porn actresses are willing to take a facial, only 53% will do interracial porn. =Alleged role of agents= Sophie Dee, prominent figure of the genre, said in a 2010 interview that she thought agents often pressure white female performers not to appear in interracial pornography. Dee said that they will be paid better for performing with black men and their careers will not be damaged in any way, pointing at positive examples of some Vivid Entertainment actresses. Aurora Snow noted in a 2013 article that the major factor preventing several white actresses from doing interracial scenes is \\"career anxiety\\" imposed by agents rather than their own racial bias. Tee Reel, male porn star and one of the few black agents in the U.S. industry, had a concurring opinion, saying, \\"In the business, some girls who say they don't do interracial, I've actually had sex with, off-camera.\\" Porn star Kristina Rose has alleged that some agents tell younger actresses that they will earn less from performing in interracial pornography to bar their involvement, although the opposite is true on a global level. Scholarly criticism Jeskaya (left) and Sebastian Barrio (right) In Chapter 3 of her book Porn Studies, Linda Williams, professor at the University of California, Berkeley, examines the film Crossing the Color Line starring Sean Michaels, a black actor, and Christi Lake, a white actress. In the interviews portion of the film, Michaels and Lake express how being \\"color-blind\\" is a progressive approach to interracial porn. Williams identifies a contradiction between these interviews and the subsequent performance, in which both actors make several references to the differences in skin color between them. For example, Lake refers to Michaels' genitalia as a \\"big black dick\\". Williams argues that by pointing out racial differences, race is being made the main point of intrigue for the audience, which perpetuates the exotification of racial differences. She argues that the eroticized sexual tension in interracial pornography dates back in American history to slavery. Mireille Miller-Young, professor of feminist studies at University of California, Santa Barbara, argues that while the porn industry hypersexualizes African-American pornographic actresses, they are often paid less, hired less, and given less attention during health checks than their white counterparts. Some scholars also argue that white women are upheld as the most-prized commodity in the industry, while black women are often devalued for their sex work, regardless of their perceived erotic abilities.

The current station occupying channel 61, now licensed to Wilmington, Delaware, signed on the air as WTGI-TV on July 9, 1986, originally operating as a general entertainment independent station. It mostly broadcast programs that the established Philadelphia stations did not desire, including drama series, old movies, reruns of old game shows, religious shows, and some ABC network shows that WPVI-TV (channel 6) chose to pre-empt. Reruns of Dynasty were WTGI's most prominent program, as well as an attempt at a local newscast entitled Delaware Valley Tonight. In addition, the station was scheduled to broadcast Philadelphia Big 5 basketball, but that idea was dropped before the season started. A lack of cable system carriage (partly because of the news program) and a transmitter located away from the heart of the Philadelphia market left the station with minimal viewership and an inability to sell advertising time at a profit.

The station continued to run some rejected ABC shows and religious programs part of the day. In the fall of 1988, WTGI adopted an ethnic-based format airing Telemundo programming during the evening hours, a few hours a day of other foreign language programs, and religious shows (in English) for part of the day. In 1993, WTGI became an affiliate of the Trinity Broadcasting Network, which made an attempt to buy the station; however, this sale fell through. In 1995, the station was sold to Paxson Communications; it then became an affiliate of the company's all-infomercial service inTV, until becoming a charter affiliate of the Pax TV network on August 31, 1998, at which time it changed its call letters to WPPX. From 2000 to 2005, WPPX-TV rebroadcast some newscasts from NBC owned-and-operated station WCAU (channel 10).

Barford is known as one of the Nadder Valley villages, named for the River Nadder which flows through the village. Grovely Wood forms the northern section of the parish. History The history of Barford can be traced back to the 11th century. It was recorded in the Domesday Book compiled in 1085/1086. The St Martin suffix, from the dedication of the church, was added by 1304 to distinguish it from Barford manor in Downton parish. Hurdcott House is from the early or mid 19th century and stands on the site of an earlier house. Grovely Wood, between Barford and Great Wishford, was an extra-parochial area. By 1839, the boundary of Barford parish had moved north to include almost all of the woodland. Religious sites An early medieval preaching cross in the centre of the village is Grade I listed. The church of St Martin is an ancient building of stone in Early English and Perpendicular styles. There has been a church here since the 13th century. The Grade I listed building has a central embattled tower within which hangs a peal of six bells; the four heavier bells date from the middle of the 18th century and the two lighter bells are from the turn of the 20th century.http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/detail.php?searchString=Barford+St+Martin&Submit;=Go&DoveID;=BARFORD+ST The benefice is part of the Nadder Valley team ministry. A Primitive Methodist chapel was built in 1902 to replace an earlier chapel. By 2012 it was in residential use. Local government Barford has an active Parish Council who are determined to improve facilities and the visual appearance of the village.

The supporting cast includes Patsy Ruth Miller, Norman Kerry, Nigel de Brulier, and Brandon Hurst. The film was Universal's \\"Super Jewel\\" of 1923 and was their most successful silent film, grossing $3.5 million. The film is based on Victor Hugo's 1831 novel, and is notable for the grand sets that recall 15th century Paris as well as for Chaney's performance and make-up as the tortured hunchback Quasimodo. The film elevated Chaney, already a well- known character actor, to full star status in Hollywood, and also helped set a standard for many later horror films, including Chaney's The Phantom of the Opera in 1925. In 1951, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication. Plot Quasimodo being offered water by Esmeralda. The story is set in Paris in 1482. Quasimodo is a deaf, half-blind, hunchbacked bell-ringer of the famous Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris. His master is a man named Jehan, the evil brother of Notre Dame's saintly archdeacon Dom Claude. One night, Jehan prevails upon Quasimodo to kidnap the fair Esmeralda, a dancing gypsy girl (and the adopted daughter of Clopin, the king of the oppressed beggars of Paris' underworld). The dashing Captain Phoebus rescues Esmeralda from Quasimodo, while Jehan abandons him and flees (later in the film, Quasimodo hates Jehan for abandoning him and is no longer loyal to him). At first seeking a casual romance, Phoebus becomes entranced by Esmeralda, and takes her under his wing. Quasimodo is sentenced to be lashed in the public square before Esmeralda and Dom Claude come to his aid. Dom Claude restrains Quasimodo from violence. To their dismay, Jehan and Clopin learn that Phoebus hopes to marry Esmeralda, despite being engaged to Fleur de Lys. Phoebus persuades Esmeralda to accompany him to a ball celebrating his appointment as Captain of the Guard by King Louis XI. He provides her with rich garments and introduces her to their hostess, Madame de Gondelaurier, as a Princess of Egypt. Clopin, accompanied by his beggars, crashes the festivities and demands Esmeralda be returned. To avoid bloodshed, Esmeralda says that she does not belong with the aristocracy. Later, however, Esmeralda sends the street poet Pierre Gringoire to give Phoebus a note, arranging a rendezvous at Notre Dame to say goodbye to him. Phoebus arrives and is stabbed in the back by Jehan. After Esmeralda is falsely sentenced to death for the crime, she is rescued from the gallows by Quasimodo and carried inside the cathedral, where he and Dom Claude grant her sanctuary. Later that night, Clopin leads the whole of the underworld to storm the cathedral, and Jehan attempts to take Esmeralda, first by guile (telling her that Phoebus's dying wish was for him to take care of her), then by force. Quasimodo holds off the invaders with rocks and torrents of molten lead. Meanwhile, the healed Phoebus is alerted by Gringoire and leads his men against the rabble. When Quasimodo finds Jehan attacking Esmeralda, he throws his former master off the ramparts of Notre Dame, but not before Jehan fatally stabs him three times in the back. Phoebus finds and embraces Esmeralda. Witnessing this, Quasimodo rings his own death toll, and Gringoire and Dom Claude enter the bell tower just in time to see him die. The last image is of the great bell swinging silently above Quasimodo's corpse. Cast  Production  Worsley observing the erection of the first set in December 1922. Long before the film was produced or shot, Lon Chaney was the industry favorite to play the role of Quasimodo. Film Daily stated it was essentially common knowledge that Chaney wanted to play the role of Quasimodo and even claimed that Chaney considered organizing a company to make the film abroad. It is known that Chaney had acquired the rights to produce the film several years prior and had been actively engaged in negotiating the production with Universal. Evidence of Chaney's seriousness included plans to do the production abroad with a German studio, the Chelsea Pictures Company. In April 1922, Chelsea Pictures announced that Lon Chaney would star in the role of Quasimodo and that Alan Crosland would direct the film. The film failed to materialize and the company seemed to have disappeared without making any releases. Irving Thalberg, who had previously worked with Chaney and Tod Browning, desired to make a production that would rise artistically above the otherwise expensive productions Universal produced. In order to convince Universal's founder, Carl Laemmle, to formally approve the production, Thalberg pitched Hunchback to him as \\"a love story\\". Bolstered by Chaney's recent box office successes, Laemmle agreed. Universal Weekly, the house publication of Universal, formally announced the production of The Hunchback of Notre Dame in August 1922. The next issue stated that the Universal Scenario Department was working on the continuity and that preliminary plans for the sets were being drafted. In September 1922, Universal Weekly announced Lon Chaney's intention for it to have him act in his final \\"cripple role\\", following the successes of both The Miracle Man and The Penalty. Chaney's ownership of the film rights allowed him contractual latitude for far more artistic approval and control of this production than he had had in previous ones; for this, he would thus serve as an uncredited, de facto producer; Thalberg was undoubtedly complicit in such an arrangement, with it serving to prevent Carl Laemmle from cutting costs on the \\"artistic\\" production. It is not known for certain, but Lon Chaney is believed to have even been influential in the selection of the director; although Wallace Worsley, the final choice for director, had previously worked successfully with Chaney on four previous films (The Penalty, The Ace of Hearts, Voices of the City, and A Blind Bargain; the last of which also featured Chaney as a hunchback) at Goldwyn, Michael Blake, a Lon Chaney scholar, states that Chaney's first choice for director was Erich von Stroheim, at that time Universal's prized \\"name\\" director after the successes of Blind Husbands and Foolish Wives. However, Stroheim was fired by Thalberg from Universal before production on Hunchback commenced‚Äîironically, due to Thalberg's fears that Stroheim would incur cost overruns on his own separate production, Merry-Go- Round. Universal Weekly thus announced Wallace Worsley, pending approval from his then-home studio Paramount, as the likely director of Hunchback in late November. Worsley's status as director, on loan from Paramount, was confirmed in the following issue, though such confirmation ran alongside an advertisement that stated Tod Browning would direct. Due to Worsley's prior commitments directing two other pictures for Paramount being extended due to the hurried replacement of their fatally ill star, Wallace Reid, with Jack Holt,Fleming 2007, p. 212. the start date on Hunchback was pushed back nearly a month in order to accommodate Worsley; in the event, the second of the two films with Holt that Worsey was to direct was eventually helmed by Joseph Henabery, in his stead.Blake 1997, p. 118. Universal announced its intentions to recreate the Notre Dame cathedral and the surrounding streets to the exacting specifications of the period. Universal staff set about creating the \\"Gallery of Kings\\", thirty five statues, each ten feet high with intended likeness of the originals. The construction of the sets was estimated to take six months to complete. The screenplay was completed by Edward T. Lowe, Jr. and Perley Poore Sheehan by the end of 1922. In the beginning of January, it was announced that film production began with the \\"Court of Miracles\\" setting. Shooting the Parisian underworld scene required a cast of some several hundred extras. The construction of the Notre Dame set and the street settings had not yet been completed. In the beginning of February filming had moved to the Madame de Gondelaurier scenes. The production reportedly required three thousand costumes for extras, requiring six weeks for Universal costume department to complete. In March, Film Daily reported Worsley had traded in his megaphone for a radio and loudspeaker to direct the large crowd of extras for the scenes. Radio Digest stated that it was a $7,000 radio and loudspeaker set up, . Film Daily reported on June 8 that the filming of the camera shots had been completed and that Universal had signed a contract to lease the Astor Theater for showing the film on September 2. At the beginning of 1923, Universal's accounts believed that the cost of the production would be between $750,000 and $1,000,000. Reception The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 91% of critics have given the film a positive review based on , with a weighted average rating of 8.08/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"A heart-rending take on the classic book, with a legendary performance by Lon Chaney.\\" =Accolades= The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2002: AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions ‚Äì Nominated Preservation The Hunchback of Notre Dame The only surviving prints of the film are 16mm \\"show-at-home\\" prints distributed by Universal in the 1920s and 1930s for home-movie purposes, and no original nitrate 35mm negatives or prints exist.

At some point, while still working at Top Taco, he got a job as a part-time roadie for X in that band's early days. At the end of a soundcheck, he sang a version of \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" by the Doors. That got the attention of the band and Doors member Ray Manzarek, who was then X's producer. In 1980, backed by the surviving members of The Doors, including Manzarek, Jimmy sang \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" at a special event. That was the publication party for the Jim Morrison biography, No One Here Gets Out Alive, at the Whisky a Go Go. Jimmy also performed the song in X concerts as an encore. One such occasion came in 1981, with Manzarek playing too, at L.A.'s Greek Theatre. Chris Morris described Jimmy's voice as \\"big, deep, raw, and throroughly unmannered.\\" He'd previously compared the \\"leather-voiced shouter\\" to Howlin' Wolf in Make The Music Go Bang!, a chronicle of the early L.A. punk scene.Make The Music Go Bang!: The Early L.A. Punk Scene, Don Snowden, ed., St. Martin's Griffin, 1997. A 1984 article had described Jimmy as a cross between Wolf and Sir John Falstaff. = Formation of band / heyday = Top Jimmy & The Rhythm Pigs began to form around 1980. They played at numerous area clubs but their gigs at one place in particular gained attention. Starting around August 1981, they had a residency playing \\"Blue Mondays\\" every Monday night at the Cathay de Grande nightclub at the corner of Argyle and Selma in Hollywood, California. They became an important part of the Los Angeles rock scene. Live, the lineup usually consisted of: * Top Jimmy: vocals * Carlos Guitarlos (Carlos Ayala): lead guitar, vocals * Gil T. (Gil Isais): bass and vocals * Dig The Pig (Richard \\"Dick\\" Aeilts): rhythm guitar * Joey Morales: drums * Steve Berlin: saxophone. (Tom Fabre, another saxophonist, also played with the group.) Top Jimmy & The Rhythm Pigs concerts often featured guest appearances by such artists as Tom Waits and Stevie Ray Vaughan. According to the Waits biography Lowside of the Road, Waits was influenced by the L.A. roots-rock scene but particularly loved the Pigs. He also formed a personal connection with Jimmy.Lowside of the Road: A Life of Tom Waits, Barney Hoskyns, Crown/Arechetype, 2009. Also joining at various times were Albert Collins, Bonnie Bramlett, and Percy Mayfield. In addition, the club included members of the aforementioned scene stalwarts, most notably X and The Blasters. Chris Morris described the \\"Blue Mondays\\" as \\"an infernal scene\\" that drew a hard-drinking crowd, and the band matched the audience's consumption. Fisticuffs were common, especially with the short-tempered Carlos Guitarlos. Yet the shows were mainly about dancing and having a good time. Another admirer and Cathay guest star was David Lee Roth of Van Halen. Thanks to Diamond Dave, the band and its frontman in particular were saluted in the song \\"Top Jimmy\\" on the album 1984. Roth frequented the Zero Zero club, where Jimmy tended bar. According to Jimmy, he and Roth had discussed working on an album of country tunes together, but that idea appears never to have gone anywhere. = Dissolution = The residency at the Cathay ended when proprietor Michael Brennan shut down the club in 1985. Top Jimmy & The Rhythm Pigs remained visible for a time at another L.A. club, Raji's. They also continued to play dates at other spots in the area, such as the Palomino Club, as seen in the fall of 1987. By that time, Steve Berlin was long gone. Gil T. had joined Dave Alvin's band in 1986. The \\"increasingly erratic\\" Carlos Guitarlos left for the Bay Area in 1988. The band never went beyond local-hero status for several reasons: internal volatility, absence of discipline, no new material, and substance abuse. = Album: Pigus Drunkus Maximus = This, the band's first and only record, was recorded in 1981 but released in 1987 -- after the group had begun to crumble. It got its belated issue on Down There Records, a label run by another L.A. musician, Steve Wynn. The album also bore the logo of Restless Records, then a division of Enigma Records. It was available on vinyl and cassette but never on CD. D.J. Bonebrake of X and Tony Morales contributed drum parts, so Joey Morales played harmonica. Gene Taylor added piano. Steve Berlin was producer. Colorful liner notes came from Chris Morris. The 11 tracks consisted mostly of cover versions of songs by Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Merle Haggard, Otis Rush, and Johnny Paycheck, among others. In its writeup, Trouser Press cited the LP's \\"enthusiastic sweaty abandon.\\"Trouser Press page on Top Jimmy & The Rhythm Pigs = Subsequent recordings by Top Jimmy = Long Distance Call by a group billed as \\"The Top Jimmy Lineup\\" came out in 1994.

Punk, John Doe and Tom DeSavia, Hachette Books, 2016. A follow-up book, More Fun in the New World (2019), went even deeper: three chapters were devoted expressly to Jimmy. The entry from Morris again compared him in voice and persona to Howlin' Wolf. John Doe and Billy Zoom also provided a wealth of anecdotes. Yet another contributor, Maria McKee, said in her chapter that when Jimmy asked her to sing with him on stage when she was just 16, it was a major turning point in her life.

This is not a physical phenomenon: the software does not actually decay, but rather suffers from a lack of being responsive and updated with respect to the changing environment in which it resides. The Jargon File, a compendium of hacker lore, defines \\"bit rot\\" as a jocular explanation for the degradation of a software program over time even if \\"nothing has changed\\"; the idea being this is almost as if the bits that make up the program were subject to radioactive decay. Causes Several factors are responsible for software rot, including changes to the environment in which the software operates, degradation of compatibility between parts of the software itself, and the appearance of bugs in unused or rarely used code. =Environment change= When changes occur in the program's environment, particularly changes which the designer of the program did not anticipate, the software may no longer operate as originally intended. For example, many early computer game designers used the CPU clock speed as a timer in their games, but newer CPU clocks were faster, so the gameplay speed increased accordingly, making the games less usable over time. =Onceability= There are changes in the environment not related to the program's designer, but its users. Initially, a user could bring the system into working order, and have it working flawlessly for a certain amount of time. But, when the system stops working correctly, or the users want to access the configuration controls, they cannot repeat that initial step because of the different context and the unavailable information (password lost, missing instructions, or simply a hard-to-manage user interface that was first configured by trial and error). Information Architect Jonas S√∂derstr√∂m has named this concept Onceability, and defines it as \\"the quality in a technical system that prevents a user from restoring the system, once it has failed\\". =Unused code= Infrequently used portions of code, such as document filters or interfaces designed to be used by other programs, may contain bugs that go unnoticed. With changes in user requirements and other external factors, this code may be executed later, thereby exposing the bugs and making the software appear less functional. =Rarely updated code= Normal maintenance of software and systems may also cause software rot. In particular, when a program contains multiple parts which function at arm's length from one another, failing to consider how changes to one part affect the others may introduce bugs. In some cases, this may take the form of libraries that the software uses being changed in a way which adversely affects the software. If the old version of a library that previously worked with the software can no longer be used due to conflicts with other software or security flaws that were found in the old version, there may no longer be a viable version of a needed library for the program to use. Classification Software rot is usually classified as being either dormant rot or active rot. =Dormant rot= Software that is not currently being used gradually becomes unusable as the remainder of the application changes. Changes in user requirements and the software environment also contribute to the deterioration. =Active rot= Software that is being continuously modified may lose its integrity over time if proper mitigating processes are not consistently applied. However, much software requires continuous changes to meet new requirements and correct bugs, and re-engineering software each time a change is made is rarely practical. This creates what is essentially an evolution process for the program, causing it to depart from the original engineered design. As a consequence of this and a changing environment, assumptions made by the original designers may be invalidated, introducing bugs. In practice, adding new features may be prioritized over updating documentation; without documentation, however, it is possible for specific knowledge pertaining to parts of the program to be lost. To some extent, this can be mitigated by following best current practices for coding conventions. Active software rot slows once an application is near the end of its commercial life and further development ceases. Users often learn to work around any remaining software bugs, and the behaviour of the software becomes consistent as nothing is changing. Examples = AI program example = Many seminal programs from the early days of AI research have suffered from irreparable software rot. For example, the original SHRDLU program (an early natural language understanding program) cannot be run on any modern day computer or computer simulator, as it was developed during the days when LISP and PLANNER were still in development stage, and thus uses non-standard macros and software libraries which do not exist anymore. = Online forum example = Suppose an administrator creates a forum using open source forum software, and then heavily modifies it by adding new features and options. This process requires extensive modifications to existing code and deviation from the original functionality of that software. From here, there are several ways software rot can affect the system: *The administrator can accidentally make changes which conflict with each other or the original software, causing the forum to behave unexpectedly or break down altogether. This leaves them in a very bad position: as they have deviated so greatly from the original code, technical support and assistance in reviving the forum will be difficult to obtain. *A security hole may be discovered in the original forum source code, requiring a security patch. However, because the administrator has modified the code so extensively, the patch may not be directly applicable to their code, requiring the administrator to effectively rewrite the update. *The administrator who made the modifications could vacate his position, leaving the new administrator with a convoluted and heavily modified forum that lacks full documentation. Without fully understanding the modifications, it is difficult for the new administrator to make changes without introducing conflicts and bugs. Furthermore, documentation of the original system may no longer be available, or worse yet, misleading due to subtle differences in functional requirements. Refactoring Refactoring is a means of addressing the problem of software rot. It is described as the process of rewriting existing code to improve its structure without affecting its external behaviour. This includes removing dead code and rewriting sections that have been modified extensively and no longer work efficiently. Care must be taken not to change the software's external behaviour, as this could introduce incompatibilities and thereby itself contribute to software rot.

It was notable for being the first game to combine both managing the team and playing as a single player. The match engine borrowed heavily from the Kick Off match engine, which was developed by Dino Dini and Anco Software, who also created Player Manager. This was the first in a series of games called Player Manager. A remake of the game was in development for iPhone. but was shelved and never released. A remake with the original graphics by Steve Screech has been developed and released on Google Play Store and elected as one of the best 3 football managerial games on Android Gameplay Players would take control of a third division side as player-manager, acting in both managing and playing aspects. The latter option was optional, since players could choose whether to control the player only or the entire team from the outset. They can opt to do neither, if they choose not to play the matches personally. The Player Manager universe is structured somewhat differently from real-life football of the same period. Many notable clubs are not featured in the game, as the programmers chose to have 10 teams in the top two divisions, and 12 in the third and fourth divisions, presumably due to memory constraints. There is also only one domestic cup competition. And, as with the majority of the football games of the time, the game is notable now for featuring no European football, due to English clubs exclusion from European competition owing to the Heysel Stadium disaster. Further reference to recent problems in real-life football come courtesy of news items that make reference to the Bradford City stadium fire, and the general problems experienced in relation to football hooliganism at the time, particularly the aforementioned Heysel. This is the first of several eccentricities in the game; if the team operated by the player attempts to hoard money, they will experience consistent fires and fines due to hooliganism, as a mechanism to keep their bank balance down.

In mathematics, he is known for his work in number theory, including the calculation of and St√∏rmer's theorem on consecutive smooth numbers. In physics, he is known for studying the movement of charged particles in the magnetosphere and the formation of aurorae, and for his book on these subjects, From the Depths of Space to the Heart of the Atom. He worked for many years as a professor of mathematics at the University of Oslo in Norway. A crater on the far side of the moon is named after him. Personal life and career Carl St√∏rmer (mid of top row) at the International Congress of Mathematicians, Z√ºrich 1932; he was accompanied by Ms. St√∏rmer (sitting left, dark clothing) and Ms. L√∂venskiold (sitting, white hat). St√∏rmer was born on 3 September 1874 in Skien, the only child of a pharmacist Georg Ludvig St√∏rmer (1842‚Äì1930) and Elisabeth Amalie Johanne Henriette M√ºlertz (1844‚Äì1916). His uncle was the entrepreneur and inventor Henrik Christian Fredrik St√∏rmer. St√∏rmer studied mathematics at the Royal Frederick University in Kristiania, Norway (now the University of Oslo, in Oslo) from 1892 to 1897, earning the rank of candidatus realium in 1898. He then studied with Picard, Poincar√©, Painlev√©, Jordan, Darboux, and Goursat at the Sorbonne in Paris from 1898 to 1900. He returned to Kristiania in 1900 as a research fellow in mathematics, visited the University of G√∂ttingen in 1902, and returned to Kristiania in 1903, where he was appointed as a professor of mathematics, a position he held for 43 years. After he received a permanent position in Kristiania, St√∏rmer published his subsequent writings under a shortened version of his name, Carl St√∏rmer. In 1918, he was elected as the first president of the newly formed Norwegian Mathematical Society. He participated regularly in Scandinavian mathematical congresses, and was president of the 1936 International Congress of Mathematicians in Oslo (from 1924 the new name of Kristiania). St√∏rmer was also affiliated with the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo, which was founded in 1934. He died on 13 August 1957, at Blindern. He was also an amateur street photographer, beginning in his student days. Near the age of 70 he put on an exhibition in Oslo of the photographs of celebrities that he had taken over the years. For instance it included one of Henrik Ibsen strolling down Karl Johans gate, the main road in Oslo. He was also a supervisory council member of the insurance company Forsikringsselskapet Norden. In February 1900 he married consul's daughter Ada Clauson (1877‚Äì1973), with whom he eventually had five children. Their son Leif St√∏rmer became a professor of historical geology at the University of Oslo. His daughter Henny married landowner Carl Otto L√∏venskiold. Carl St√∏rmer is also the grandfather of the mathematician Erling St√∏rmer. Mathematical research St√∏rmer's first mathematical publication, published when he was a beginning student at the age of 18, concerned trigonometric series generalizing the Taylor expansion of the arcsine function. He revisited this problem a few years later. Next, he systematically investigated Machin-like formula by which the number may be represented as a rational combination of the so-called \\"Gregory numbers\\" of the form . Machin's original formula, :\\\\textstyle\\\\pi = 16\\\\arctan \\\\frac15 - 4\\\\arctan\\\\frac1{239}, is of this type, and St√∏rmer showed that there were three other ways of representing as a rational combination of two Gregory numbers. He then investigated combinations of three Gregory numbers, and found 102 representations of œÄ of this form, but was unable to determine whether there might be additional solutions of this type. These representations led to fast algorithms for computing numerical approximations of . In particular, a four- term representation found by St√∏rmer, :\\\\textstyle\\\\pi = 176 \\\\arctan\\\\frac{1}{57} + 28 \\\\arctan\\\\frac{1}{239} - 48 \\\\arctan\\\\frac{1}{682} + 96 \\\\arctan\\\\frac{1}{12943} was used in a record-setting calculation of to 1,241,100,000,000 decimal digits in 2002 by Yasumasa Kanada.Associated press, 6 December 2002; letter from Kanada, 20 October 2005, online at super- computing.org . St√∏rmer is also noted for the St√∏rmer numbers, which arose from the decomposition of Gregory numbers in St√∏rmer's work. St√∏rmer's theorem, which he proved in 1897, shows that, for any finite set of prime numbers, there are only finitely many pairs of consecutive integers having only the numbers from as their prime factors. In addition, St√∏rmer describes an algorithm for finding all such pairs. The superparticular ratios generated by these consecutive pairs are of particular importance in music theory. St√∏rmer proves this theorem by reducing the problem to a finite set of Pell equations, and the theorem itself can also be interpreted as describing the possible factorizations of solutions to Pell's equation. Chapman quotes Louis Mordell as saying \\"His result is very pretty, and there are many applications of it.\\" Additional subjects of St√∏rmer's mathematical research included Lie groups, the gamma function, and Diophantine approximation of algebraic numbers and of the transcendental numbers arising from elliptic functions. From 1905 St√∏rmer was an editor of the journal Acta Mathematica, and he was also an editor of the posthumously-published mathematical works of Niels Henrik Abel and Sophus Lie. Astrophysical research Carl St√∏rmer with assistant Birkeland in 1910 From 1903, when St√∏rmer first observed Kristian Birkeland's experimental attempts to explain the aurora borealis, he was fascinated by aurorae and related phenomena. His first work on the subject attempted to model mathematically the paths taken by charged particles perturbed by the influence of a magnetized sphere, and St√∏rmer eventually published over 48 papers on the motion of charged particles. By modeling the problem using differential equations and polar coordinates, St√∏rmer was able to show that the radius of curvature of any particle's path is proportional to the square of its distance from the sphere's center. To solve the resulting differential equations numerically, he used Verlet integration, which is therefore also known as St√∂rmer's method. Ernst Br√ºche and Willard Harrison Bennett verified experimentally St√∏rmer's predicted particle motions; Bennett called his experimental apparatus \\"St√∂rmertron\\" in honor of St√∏rmer. St√∏rmer's calculations showed that small variations in the trajectories of particles approaching the earth would be magnified by the effects of the Earth's magnetic field, explaining the convoluted shapes of aurorae. St√∏rmer also considered the possibility that particles might be trapped within the geomagnetic field, and worked out the orbits of these trapped particles. St√∏rmer's work on this subject applies to what are today called the magnetospheric ring current and Van Allen radiation belts. As well as modeling these phenomena mathematically, St√∏rmer took many photographs of aurorae, from 20 different observatories across Norway. He measured their heights and latitudes by triangulation from multiple observatories, and showed that the aurora are typically as high as 100 kilometers above ground. He classified them by their shapes, and discovered in 1926 the \\"solar-illuminated aurora\\", a phenomenon that can occur at twilight when the upper parts of an aurora are lit by the sun; these aurorae can be as high as 1000 km above ground. St√∏rmer's book, From the Depths of Space to the Heart of the Atom, describing his work in this area, was translated into five different languages from the original Norwegian. A second book, The Polar Aurora (Oxford Press, 1955), contains both his experimental work on aurorae and his mathematical attempts to model them. In his review of this book, Canadian astronomer John F. Heard calls St√∏rmer \\"the acknowledged authority\\" on aurorae. Heard writes, \\"The Polar Aurora will undoubtedly remain for many years a standard reference book; it belongs on the desk of anyone whose work or interest is involved with aurorae.\\" Other astrophysical phenomena investigated by St√∏rmer include pulsations of the earth's magnetic field, echoing in radio transmissions, nacreous clouds and luminous night clouds, zodiacal light, meteor trails, the solar corona and solar vortices, and cosmic rays. Awards and honors St√∏rmer was a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) and a Corresponding Member of the French Academy of Sciences. He was also a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters from 1900. He was given honorary degrees by Oxford University (in 1947), the University of Copenhagen (1951), and the Sorbonne (1953), and in 1922 the French Academy awarded him their Janssen Medal. Three times St√∏rmer was a plenary speaker in the International Congress of Mathematicians (1908 in Rome, 1924 in Toronto, and 1936 in Oslo); he was an invited speaker of the ICM in 1920 in Strasbourg and in 1932 in Zurich. In 1971, the crater St√∂rmer on the far side of the Moon was named after him. In 1902, St√∏rmer was decorated with King Oscar II's Medal of Merit in gold. He was also decorated as a Knight, First Order of the Order of St. Olav in 1939. He was upgraded to Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav in 1954.

They are thought of being in ancient times coastal inhabitants, seafarers, maritime traders, who as well were according to at least one modern writer, described as \\"ferocious soldiers\\", claiming to be Kshatriyas.Iyengar p. 139 There are many theories as to their origins but they have since ancient times been recorded in the area of Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka In modern India, Paravars are concentrated along the coastal belt extending around the Gulf of Mannar, from Kilakarai through to Kanyakumari (Cape Comorin) and then on almost as far as Thiruvanathapuram. There are also Paravar settlements on the outskirts of inland villages, and there has been a significant number among the population of Thoothukudi, a major town, since the 1580s. In Sri Lanka, Bharathakula people are classified as a separate ethnic group, since 2001.  Etymology  The name Paravar literally means \\"dwellers on seacoast\\" and is derived from the Tamil word paravai meaning \\"sea\\" or \\"expanse\\". The Paravars may have been the Paradavar mentioned in Sangam literature, who are mentioned in the Pattinappaalai. They were also known as Minavar (lit. fishermen) and were maritime inhabitants of the littoral Sangam landscape known as Neithal, who were among other involved in fishing.Subrahmanian p. 159, 301 The name Parathavar may be derived from the same root word paravai. The Paravars prefer to call themselves Parathar also written Bharathar, which may be a corrupted form of the Tamil word padavar meaning \\"boat men\\". Another etymological theory propose the community had adopted the name of the Bharatas clan from the Hindu epic Mahabharata, who were the ancestor of the heroes in the epic, following their origin myth from Ayodhya. History =Pandyan dynasty= From the earliest recorded times the Paravars were fishers, seamen and maritime traders specialising in seasonal harvesting of pearl oysters and chank, both of which were significant exports from southern India by the first century AD.Bayly p. 322 (The pearl diving season usually lasted 20 ‚Äì 30 days, around March).Neill p. 141 The community was also involved in sea salt production,Iyengar p. 12 which was a relatively easy task on the Indian coast as the hot temperatures evaporated the water without the need for firewood. Diving for pearls and chank, as well as fishing, were thought of as being \\"low and ritually polluting occupations.\\" The Pandyan emperors allowed the Paravars to manage and operate the pearl fisheries because of their already ancient skills in that activity, which required specialist seamanship abilities, knowledge of how to tend the oysterbeds and also knowledge of their location. The emperors exempted the Paravars from taxation and allowed them to govern themselves in return for being paid tribute from the produce extracted. Cave engravings from the third century BC, found in 2003, reinforce this view as they suggest that the Paravars were the chieftains (Velirs) of the coastal region during this period, ruling as subordinates of the Pandyas. Previously, in the 1920s, Iyengar had noted that the caste name was used in ancient scripts to mean both boatmen and chiefs of the Madurai country. A report written in 1669 made it clear that in so far as they were kings, they were only kings of their own people and not of any wider constituency; furthermore, that these \\"kings\\" were referred to as such only by the Paravars. However, in the Sangam work Mathuraikkanci, the author Mankudi Maruthanar, refers to his patron, the Pandya sovereign Talaiyanganam Nedunjeliyan, as the Lord of Korkai and the Warlord of the southern Parathavar (Then Parathavar por yere).Subbarayalu, Y. 2014. 'Early Tamil Polity', in A Concise History of South India: Issues and Interpretations, ed. Noburu Karashmia, pp. 52‚Äì53. New Delhi: Oxford University Press. The 1901 Madras Census noted that the Tamil-speaking Paravars \\"claim\\" to be kshatriyas (warriors) serving under the Pandyan kings, the word used suggesting some official doubt regarding the issue.Thurston p. 143 Little is known about the Paravas during the middle ages. Indeed, Donkin has argued that with one exception, \\"there are no native literary works with a developed sense of chronology, or indeed much sense of place, before the thirteenth century\\", and that any historical observations have to be made using Arab, European and Chinese accounts.Donkin p. 152 Southern India came under the control of the Cholas in the ninth century but reverted to Pandyan control around the mid-1200s following a series of battles. They maintained control, despite several challenges, until the 16th century.Donkin p. 160 =Arab arrival= Regardless of any doubt regarding their claims to be warriors under the liege of Pandyan emperors, the Paravars certainly did have armies at a later time, these being created to protect the fisheries and their people from attack.Bayly p. 326 The Arab Muslim invasion began in 712 AD at the Sindh Valley and by around 1300 AD they had taken over the entire northern India. However, even prior to the invasion there were Arabs in southern areas such as Calicut, Quilon and Malabar, chiefly traders interested in the spices, pearls, precious stones and cottons which were available there. Another advantage of the location was that it was on a major sea trade route running through south- east Asia and on to China.Donkin pp. 129‚Äì130 Some of these Arabs were also pearl divers, having gained their experience in the waters of the Persian Gulf. Some Paravars adopted Islam, whose women also were married off to Muslim traders. These claimed to be descendants of the biblical figure Noah. The descendants of these Muslim people became known as the Lebbais and their main settlement was the town of Kayal, a presence which was noted by Vasco da Gama and Duarte Barbosa by the early sixteenth century.Neill p. 142 There is some ambiguity regarding this town: there was a harbour on the Tamraparani River in Pandyan times which was known as Korkai and when the river at this point became too silted to use (it is situated approximately 8 km inland nowadays), it was replaced by a port called Kayal, thought to be situated variously either at the mouth of the river or at the village of Palayakayal which was 4 km downstream of Korkai but is itself nowadays about 3 km inland. Marco Polo described Kayal as a bustling port and the centre of the pearl trade in 1292 but by the mid-16th century this too had probably ceased to operate and was replaced by another port, Punnaikayal (new Kayal) under the influence of the Portuguese colonists. Punnaikayal was again at the mouth of the river, which as part of an estuary was under constant change, around 4 km from Palayakayal. It is difficult to determine with any consistency which of these locations is being referred to at various times by various authors but what does appear to be a common factor is that this was until modern times a major port for the pearl trade. Kayal is the Tamil word for a backwater.Donkin p. 158 The 1901 Madras Census noted three groups who called themselves Paravars. It speculated that their common root were the mostly Christian Tamil-speaking Paravars, The other groups were the Canarese-speaking Paravars, who were umbrella makers and devil-dancers and the Malayalam-speaking Paravars, who were lime burners, gymnasts, midwives and shell collectors. It has been further speculated that the splitting of the latter two groups from the first may have been as a consequence of a desire to move away from the ancient tribal area when faced with the arrival of Muslims. The Paravar belief of being the Paravaims of the biblical scriptures and the lost tribes of Israel added to the differences with the Arabs, which is acknowledged by Fr.Henrique Henriques by his claim of kinship. =Arrival of the Portuguese and Catholicism= Conversion of the Paravas by Francis Xavier, in a 19th-century coloured lithograph There are differences of opinion regarding events up to the early 1500s. Donkin and Ray believe that the Muslims gained influence over the Paravars to the point that the latter became at best hired labour and at worst enslaved, and Neill has claimed that there was a belief among Paravars that the Muslims sought completely to exterminate them following various squabbles. However, Mannar and Chandrasekaran have said that up to the 16th century the Paravars had held almost a monopoly of the rights to exploit the pearl fisheries, having negotiated with successive kings to achieve this. By this time, Maynard has claimed, the south Indian coastal areas around Kanyakumari were \\"the greatest pearl fishery in the world\\", and that the Hindu people who fished for oysters there \\" ... were known as the Paravas, a caste sufficiently low, although not of the very lowest.\\" He says that the Hindus were essentially peaceful in nature and temperamentally unsuited to counter physical threat,Maynard pp. 111‚Äì112 although Frykenberg has described them as a \\"... proud and venturesome seafaring folk engaged in fishing, pearl diving, trading, and piracy.\\" Hastings has pointed out that the piracy (and some smuggling) was only an occasional activity and that their more normal occupations demanded courage, strength and stamina, which made them \\"hardened adventurers\\". From 1527 the Paravars were being threatened by Arab fleets offshore, headed by the Muslim supporting Zamorin of Calicut, and also by an onshore campaign of the Rajah of Madura to wrest control of Tirunelveli and the Fishery Coast from the hands of the Rajah of Travancore.Maynard pp. 138‚Äì142 This continuing situation, and the desire to be relieved of the rivalry from Lebbai divers, caused the Paravars to seek the protection of Portuguese explorers who had moved into the area. A delegation led by Vikirama Aditha Pandya visited Goa to seek talks to this end in 1532.There are discrepancies regarding the identity of Vikirama Aditha Pandya. Bayly believes him \\"apparently\\" to have been a headman or senior caste elder (p. 326), as does Kaufmann (p. 208); however, Neill is very specific in saying that he was \\"a Cheti of the merchant caste resident in Calicut, who in 1513 had been sent to Portugal as an emissary of the zamorin, and while there had been baptised and taken a Portuguese name [Jo√£o da Cruz].\\" Neill is also of the opinion that the agreement with the Portuguese arose in 1535 rather than 1532. (p. 142) Hastings broadly agrees with Neill regarding the identity (p. 167). The protection was granted on the condition that the leaders were immediately baptised as Catholics and that they would encourage their people also to convert to Catholicism; the Portuguese would also gain a strategic foothold and control of the pearl fisheries. The deal was agreed and Vikrama Aditya Pandya baptised as Joao de Cruz became the first subject of the king of Portugal and some months later 20,000 Paravars were baptised en masse, and became subjects of Portugal, during the visit of Pedro Gonsalves, Vicar of Cochin. By the end of 1537 the entire community had declared itself to be Catholics, according to Hastings, and the Portuguese proceeded to destroy the Arab fleet when they met fortuitously at Vedalai on 27 June 1538. The Portuguese state began to claim rights over the economic resources in the area due to its patronage of the Paravars. From that point the Paravar people as a whole enjoyed renewed prosperity. Their declaration of acceptance of the Catholic faith did not prevent them from continuing to worship in the manner which they had done previously because there were no translators to spread the Catholic message and also because the conversion was seen by the Paravar people as being merely a convenient arrangement to obtain protection, not a statement of belief. Bayly describes the situation as being \\"... really a declaration of tactical alliance rather than religious conversions as the term is usually understood.\\"Bayly p. 328 Francis Xavier, a Jesuit priest, had been working in Goa prior to his journey to Kanyakumari, where he arrived in October 1542. He took with him some interpreters with the intention of spreading the Gospel and bringing about further religious conversions among what Frykenberg has called \\"the lowest, most polluting segments of Tamil society\\". Maynard claims that a further 10,000 Paravars were baptised during the first month of his mission, and 30,000 in total by its end; and that \\"His conversion of the Paravas, as is pointed out by P√®re Lhande, is the only instance of an entire caste being brought into the Church.\\"Maynard pp. 119 More modest figures have been proposed, such as 15,000 people including re- baptisms. Xavier also brought about the conversion of members of other castes living in the area, for example Mukkuvars and Paraiyars. His methods of conversion were sometimes forceful; for example, it is recorded that he burned down a hut which had been used to house non-Christian religious symbols.Maynard p. 133 Xavier appointed catechists in the Paravar villages up and down the of coastline to spread and reinforce his teachings, the method for much of which was to recite repetitively (and in poorly translated Tamil) rhythmic phrases of the Creed, Pater Noster and other standard Catholic teachings regardless of whether the content was actually understood.Maynard p. 131 These appointments necessitated that he obtained funds with which to pay them, the primary source being money granted to him by the Queen of Portugal. Violence had not been completely removed from Paravar society, despite the Portuguese intervention. There were a series of bloody skirmishes involving the Badage tribe, raiding from the neighbouring area of Madura in the ongoing struggle between the rajahs. Some of the Portuguese protectors themselves were involved in duplicitous dealings with such tribes, or simply took advantage of the mayhem to make personal gains. Xavier intervened on several occasions in an attempt to right these wrongs and in March 1544 wrote a letter stating that the behaviour of the Portuguese was in fact the biggest hurdle he faced in promoting the Catholic message. In 1545 he wrote that \\"I have never ceased wondering at the number of new inflexions they have added to the conjugation of the verb to rob.\\" He left India some time in the late 1540s or early 1550s but the precise year is disputed. There is at least one source who believes that he briefly visited again in 1548, when he was paraded through Tuticorin by the Paravars. It has been suggested that his status among the Paravars was one of \\"cult worship\\".Bayly p. 329 There is a shrine to him, in a cave, which is still venerated today as the place they believe to have been his principal residence during his time among them.Bayly p. 331 Vikirama Aditha Pandya was rewarded by the Portuguese for his actions of 1532, when as part of the arrangement for protection he had offered to manage the pearl diving on behalf of the Portuguese. He became known as Senhor dos Senhores (\\"first among notables\\") Dom Jo√£o da Cruz (but see Note 1) and was recognised as headman and official intermediary by the Portuguese from 1543 until 1553. (1543 was the year that the Portuguese first settled in Tuticorin, and the point from which that port began to expand until it eventually became the hub of the pearl fishery). His title of jati thalavan (head of the caste) was passed down through 21 other members of his family. Caste elders in the various villages were also among the early beneficiaries of Portuguese recognition, perhaps because they were the first to be converted. The consequence was that a formal system of hierarchical control, based on religious authority and economic standing and extending from the jati thalavan through to the elders and then to the villagers, became established in the eyes of Paravars and non-Paravars alike. It remained in existence until the 1920s, with the elders extracting payments from villagers which were then passed on to the jati thalavan, and the latter in return managing affairs (including the fishery operations) and adjudicating in both internal and external disputes involving the community. Kaufmann has commented that these \\"highly organised caste institutions\\" including hereditary headmen and councils of elders holding sway, was a rare thing in the agrarian economy of southern India and both lasted longer and was more elaborate than most equivalent Hindu systems of the area. Another writer has said that \\" ... by the beginning of the eighteenth century the Tamil Paravas had emerged as one of south India's most highly organised specialist caste groups\\", and adds that the hierarchical system had its origins in times prior to the Portuguese intervention. Their conversion may have enabled them to participate more significantly in religious ceremonies than was the case when they were Hindus, this being because their \\"unclean\\" occupations (that is, the taking of life) would have prevented any central contribution in Hindu religious ritual.Bayly p. 346 This was certainly the outcome following Pope Clement XIV's dissolution of the Society of Jesus in 1773, which resulted in a dearth of Catholic misisonaries and priests in the area, enabling the jati thalavan and his fellow caste notables to assume the role of solemniser for rituals such as marriage.Bayly p. 351 Paravar Christianity, with its own identity based on a mixture of Christian-Catholic religious belief and Hindu caste culture, remains a defining part of the Paravar life today, the early work of missionaries and in the 1540s having been reinforced by others who succeeded them and by the jati thalavan, the latter also being known as the \\"little king\\". Kaufmann explains this Christianity as being \\"in effect a 'caste lifestyle' for the Paravas\\", whilst Zupanov gives an example of how the missionaries modified Catholic teaching to suit the Paravars by citing the example of Henrique Henriques, who told them that \\"in the beginning there were no Muslims, only Jews and Tamils\\". =Dutch control= Pearl Fishery at Tuticorin camp, 1662, by Johan Nieuhof. A report written in 1622 stated that the fisheries had been moribund for many years due to the poverty of the Paravars; it is uncertain as to what period this refers or the cause of the poverty.Thurston p. 152 Xavier had recorded that the oyster beds seemed to have an uneven cyclical pattern, with a few good years of production alternating with a rather longer period of poor production. Similarly, around 1490 Ahmad ibn MƒÅjid wrote that the fisheries \\"flourish in some years, but appear dead in others.\\" One contemporary explanation for these changes was that the beds became covered by the shifting sea sands.Donkin p. 162 A study of the period 1666‚Äì1916 showed that while the good harvests did tend to alternate between the Indian and the Sri Lankan sides of the Gulf, the latter side was more than twice as productive. Control of the fisheries passed from the Portuguese to the Dutch from 1658, along with sovereignty over the Paravars. The new rulers, who were Protestant, tried unsuccessfully to convert the Paravars to their own faith. One example of this attempt was the banning of the feast of Our Lady of Snows as a consequence of the Dutch taking over all the Catholic churches, many of which were turned into warehouses. This event had originated when a wood statuette of the Virgin Mary was moved by the Portuguese to the church of Our Lady of Mercy at Tuticorin in 1582, its installation being celebrated with a nine-day feast which was subsequently repeated annually and much enjoyed by the Paravars. The feast halted with the Dutch takeover but was reinstated from 1709, and three years later permission was granted for the building of a new church. It was the right of the jati thalavan always to make the first tug of the rope which was attached to a chariot containing the statuette and which marked the start of the festival. The veneration of the statuette has been called a \\"cult\\" and continues into modern times, although few outside the caste have such regard for it.Bayly p. 367 During the period of Catholic repression the Dutch East India Company also expelled all Catholic priests and outlawed Catholic baptisms and other rituals. Indeed, there are no surviving records to suggest that there was any evangelism at all, although they did build Tuticorin's first Protestant church in 1750. During their period of control the Dutch also established a cloth factory in Tuticorin and this was a much appreciated venture ‚Äî at some point the Paravars had also become traders in cloth.Bayly p. 357 =British control= The British took over control in 1796, after a period of gradual usurpation of Dutch authority along the coast and elsewhere by the East India Company. They had seized Tuticorin in 1785. Both sides had attempted to influence the Paravars, seeking to have their support to exploit the riches of the fishery waters. The new government continued to recognise the Paravar's hierarchical social structure, as the Dutch and Portuguese had done before them.Bayly p. 356 However, until 1813 the Company did not officially allow Christian missionaries to operate in the areas under its control, bowing only then due to pressure from religious organisations in Britain. The company was suspicious of any potential political undertones spread by the missionaries and was eager to keep trade running smoothly by operating a policy of non- interventionist conservatism in matters religious and cultural. Bayly has examined why it was that some among the low-ranking Paravars were able to rise to work in occupations that were both more prestigious and more financially rewarding than had been the case before the conversion to Christianity, She points out that the Paravars held much the same rank as the Mukkavars, who were also a maritime caste of the area and were converted but did not demonstrate the same subsequent socio-economic mobility.Bayly p. 321 (It has, however, been argued that the Mukkavars were \\"a sub-class of the Parava[r] community\\" and formed the largest group of those converted to Christianity during Xavier's time). Robinson has said When the Jesuit missionaries returned in the 1830s, following the revival of their Society, they were shocked at the lapse in formal religious observance and in general Christian morality, as well as the opulent lifestyle being led by the Paravar elite which contrasted with the dilapidated state of the churches.Bayly pp. 356‚Äì357 Around that time the elite, along with some other groups such as Nadar traders, were making significant amounts of money from a surge in export demand for processed cotton, using their existing wealth from the pearl fisheries as a means to expand their interests into this booming sector. By 1845 Tuticorin was the location of the main cotton export activities in southern India and by the end of the century it was the fifth largest port in the entire of India.Bayly pp. 361‚Äì362 The Jesuits decided in 1841 to attempt to re-assert their authority over the elite by supporting the aspirations of a rising group of lesser Paravars who had also managed to gain from the boom and had hopes of validating their success with an appropriate rank in the hierarchy. These people were traders, often spending long periods of time away from home in such places as Goa and Sri Lanka. Even lower down the ranks, the rise in ship and cargo movements, the continued development of Tuticorin harbour and town, and similar consequences of the boom (including the requirement for food by those who had moved away from working directly in fishing or on the land) was providing increasingly profitable work. The Paravar elite continued their traditional role, organising this labour as they had done for the pearl fisheries. They also absorbed into their ranks those members of the caste who had profited from independent trading, this being achieved by requiring the newcomers to pay a fee and swear allegiance to the jati thalivan. However, there were people who had been cast aside from the elite as a consequence of falling out with the jati, and others who wanted recognition more quickly than the system allowed. These disaffected people were the target of the Jesuit actions, which consisted primarily of providing them with status symbols such as the offer of additional Te Deums and bells at marriage ceremonies. The end result of this attempt to foment a new hierarchy, however, was a riot and a successful move by the jati to replace the Jesuits with Goan Padroados as ministers to his people and officiators at the church of Our Lady of Snows. The Jesuits continued trying to split the caste for a further thirty years but rarely had more than temporary successes: the ranks of the disaffected were swollen by new arrivals but also diminished by those who left as a consequence of having obtained satisfaction from the elite.Bayly pp. 361‚Äì365 The Jesuits had gone so far as to establish an alternative cathedral, the Sacred Heart, in the hope of drawing worshippers from Our Lady of Snows. That, too, failed in its purpose.Bayly p. 369 There were also several instances where the disputes ‚Äî often relating to rights in regard to religious buildings and their precincts ‚Äî were taken through the court system, and also more occasions when riots between the factions occurred.Bayly p. 370 The death of the jati thalavan in 1889 without a male heir gave rise to a power vacuum and so presented a new opportunity for the Jesuits. Combined with this was another boom in maritime trading, this time involving the plantations of Ceylon, which served to swell the ranks of those aspiring for recognition as members of the elite. The Jesuits employed various measures intended to drive a wedge between the two groups and to limit the subservience displayed towards the jati and other senior caste members which, the Jesuits believed, infringed on the true worship of God because offerings of money and goods were made to those people as part of Paravan church rituals. They went so far as to attempt to install an alternative jati and the battle for control continued for several years.Bayly pp. 372‚Äì374 The Jesuits were not helped in their aim by the British government, who in 1891 renegotiated the arrangements for sharing the fishery catches with the new, non-Jesuit appointed jati thalavan. This deal, in which it was agreed that the jati should receive the output of one boat for that of every thirty which went to the government, once again confirmed the support of the ruling power for the caste hierarchy. The new jati was himself controversial among the Paravars: his appointment to the role, being the son of the previous headman's daughter, was thought by some to be invalid because the succession had passed through the female line. In the late nineteenth century the Paravar elite tried to reconcile with the Muslim seafarers in their area, seeking to claim kinship. This went as far as the then jati thalivan declaring that the elite among these Marakkar Muslims, from towns such as Kilakarai, were in fact related to him by blood as they shared common antecedents. There was a tactical purpose to these decisions as by these actions he wanted to assert that he had authority over them. Furthermore, it was in the economic interests of the Paravars to foster these relationships because under British rule it was often the Marakkar who were granted the licences to operate the fisheries. Simultaneously, the Paravars were attempting to dissociate themselves from other Christian castes, whom they thought to be of a lower standing than themselves, such as the Nadars.Bayly pp. 350‚Äì351 Although they regarded the Nadar Christians as their equal in the past.Bayly pp. 349 The Nadars had been enthusiastic in their conversion to Christianity but did so much later than the Paravars, with surges of conversion ‚Äî both to Catholicism and Protestantism ‚Äî taking place in 1802‚Äì1803, the 1840s and the late 1870s/early 1880s. Dyron Daughrity has said that the conversions were \\"largely because of the increase in social status that could be effected\\" but adds that However, the combination of Jesuit pressure and then also that of the Goan Padroados, who came to agree that the ritual role of the jati was detrimental to belief, caused the gradual erosion of the jati's powers of patronage and organisation. This situation was assisted by the growing number of people aspiring to be members of the elite and those who disputed the validity of the succession as a consequence of the female lineage. The ceremonial role of the jati in religious observance and ceremony was gradually reduced, including the removal of status symbols such as the special seat that he occupied for Mass, and with these actions went much of his influence over the caste. By 1900 there were strikes taking place among the pearl and chank divers, often for frivolous reasons; the jati was unable to impose the discipline upon them which once had been a primary role.Bayly p. 377 As the caste hierarchy disintegrated, becoming a range of groups each seeking to assert their position, the role of the jati thalavan became more and more impossible and was eventually abandoned, the last occupant of the post having been installed in 1926. The introduction of new technologies in the post-World War II era significantly affected the entire notion of an elite, as developments such as nylon fishing nets, refrigeration and motorisation made fishing more lucrative as an occupation in its own right and removed the economic differences between those who laboured and those who either traded or lived off the organisation of labour. There is still a ritual element today surrounding certain events at Our Lady of Snows but the caste system which existed for centuries has gone.Bayly p. 378 =Post- independence= In 1947, the fisheries became a monopoly of the new independent Indian government. , Paravars were classified as a Most backward caste in most of Tamil Nadu and as a Scheduled caste in Kanniyakumari District and Shenkottai taluk of Tirunelveli District by the Government of Tamil Nadu. In 2009 the government of Tamil Nadu issued an order designating Christian Paravars within its jurisdiction as being of the Most Backward Classes (MBC), a designation regarding their socio-economic status which entitles them to various assistance measures, primarily in the form of positive discrimination, if they should require it. Prior to that decision, some Paravars in the jurisdiction had been in the Scheduled caste group, although others were already MBC. These designations are flexible and subject to change at various times, according to determined need. Occupations Historically, the Paravars were involved in sea-related activities such as pearl diving, fishing, navigation, boatbuilding and the making of salt. It is known that during the visit of Francis Xavier the Paravars were using two different types of boat for net fishing, which he called the vallam and the toni. The latter was also used for trips to other coastal settlements and for trading journeys as far away as the Maldives. They were both large, open vessels with masts as well as oars; the sails were made with cotton, stiffened by boiling with roots and cow dung, and the fishing nets were made from coconut fibre. However, Iyengar believes that the toni was a hide-covered wicker basket similar to a coracle. There is uncertainty regarding whether or not the present boats called vallam are similar to the ones described 500 years ago. Hornell's report of 1920 described the single-masted vallam in use around that time at being about long and with a cargo capacity of around 2 tons. In 1914 he had described a larger three-masted boat, called the dhoni, which was used for pearl fishing and ferrying between anchored ships and Tuticorin harbour, as well as coastal journeys. The dhoni may owe its origin to Arab designs but could equally be indigenous. The Paravars also used boats similar to catamarans and, indeed, that word comes from the Tamil katturmaran (tied tree). It would seem that the design was developed independently of those used in Polynesia. An 1895 traveller describes them as a hollowed-out tree trunk up to long which is connected to a smaller trunk acting as an outrigger using lashes and two arched lengths of bamboo. The voyager and explorer William Dampier had described seeing them in 1699. Family names The Paravars were probably a primarily endogamous societyIyengar p. 72 until the arrival of the Portuguese, marrying only within their own caste and so keeping the tribal ties strong. Subsequently, they became exogamous and from this came the use of names based on Portuguese origin. Family names such as Fernando, Costa, da Cruz and Roche are a direct consequence of these marriages, and familiar names, such as Susai (a Tamil translation of Joseph), reflect both the marriages and the general Portuguese influence. Robinson offers a different thesis, claiming that they remained endogamous even after conversion, that these family ties strengthened their ability to ascend socially and that the use of Christian family names was in fact a privilege granted to them by the Portuguese and deemed to be a sign of their superiority over other castes such as the Mukkavars. There are four family names of non-Christian origin still in common use, these being Kalingarayan, Villavarayan, Poobalarayan and Rayan. These names are thought possibly to have their origin in arayan, which was used by Tamil fishing groups as a caste title. Arayan is claimed by some modern descendants of the Paravars to be itself derived from rayya (rajah, king). Notable People *Cruz Fernandez (Legislator) *J. L. P.

Early life  Nihad Awad was born in Amman New Camp, a Palestinian refugee camp in Amman, Jordan. He studied at Second Amman Preparatory School for Boys, located at the camp and belongs to UNRWA, and at Salaheddine High School in Achrafieh in Jordan. He moved to Italy and later to the United States to pursue his university studies.  Career  After studying civil engineering at the University of Minnesota in the 1990s, he worked at the University of Minnesota Medical Center. After the Gulf War, he was Public Relations Director for the Islamic Association for Palestine (IAP). In June 1994, IAP President Omar Ahmad and others founded the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), and Awad was hired as the Executive Director. In a March 1994 speech at Barry University, future CAIR Executive Director Awad said in response to an audience question about the various humanitarian efforts in the Palestinian Occupied Territories, \\"I am in support of the Hamas movement more than the PLO... there are some [Hamas] radicals, we are not interested in those people.\\"Statement by Nihad Awad at a panel discussion, \\"The Road to Peace: the Challenge of the Middle East,\\" Barry University, March 22, 1994. According to CAIR, at the time Awad expressed support for Hamas, the group had not conducted suicide bombings and was not designated a terrorist organization by the US. Awad has said he no longer supports the group and has condemned suicide bombings. A few days after the September 11 attacks in 2001, Awad was one of a select group American Muslim leaders invited by the White House to join President Bush in a press conference condemning the attacks and acts of anti-Muslim intolerance that followed. Controversies =Fundraising Request to Muammar Gaddafi= In April 2011, Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va. cited a 2009 letter sent from Awad, to Muammar Gaddafi asking Gaddafi for funding for a project called the Muslim Peace Foundation at a U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations sub- committee hearing with Robert Mueller. The letter also said, in part, \\"I am pleased to send to Your Excellency in my name most solemn assurances of thanks and appreciation for the efforts you exert in the service of Islam, Muslims and all mankind through your initiative to teach Islam, spread the culture of Islam, and solve disputes, for which you are known internationally.\\" Steven Emerson criticized the funding request, calling it \\"hypocritical\\"., Awards & honors Nihad Awad (second from right) stands to President Bush's left, when Bush said \\"Like the good folks standing with me, the American people were appalled and outraged at last Tuesday's attacks [on Sept. 11, 2001].\\" Retrieved on Jan. 27, 2007 * The Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre's \\"500 Most Influential Muslims 2009\\"http://www.blogger.com/profile/16025605882787185339 * Among 100 of the \\"World's Most Influential Arabs\\" for 2010 by Arabian Business magazinehttp://www.arabianbusiness.com/power100-2010/list?view=profile&itemid;=150752 References External links * Official website * Category:Living people Category:Palestinian Sunni Muslims Category:American Sunni Muslims Category:Palestinian emigrants to the United States Category:University of Minnesota alumni Category:University of Minnesota faculty Category:People from Amman Category:Palestinian Muslim activists Category:American Muslim activists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Nihad Awad"},{"id":"1906538","text":"(official name: ) is a stadium in Chiba City, Chiba, Japan.

Frka also dated Todd Rundgren and Russell Mael; Frka died on November 6, 1972, of a barbiturate overdose in a house in Cohasset, Massachusetts, which at the time was being rented by Jonathan Richman and The Modern Lovers. She overdosed shortly before her 23rd birthday. * Miss Lucy was born Luz Selenia Offerrall in Puerto Rico. After moving to Los Angeles, she met two of her future bandmates, Miss Pamela Des Barres and Miss Sparky, at the house of a mutual friend (Vito Pauleukas). Miss Lucy was not an original member of The GTOs; she joined the group after the recording of Permanent Damage. She later left the group, claiming they were becoming too commercial. She was married to the late Gordon McLaren (bassist for a New York City band The Groupies) from 1975 to 1981. As an actress, Miss Lucy appeared in 200 Motels (1971), Video from Hell (1985), and Uncle Meat (1987). She died in 1991 of complications from AIDS. * Miss Sandra was born Sandra Lynn Rowe (later Sandra Leano and Sandra Lynn Harris) on January 18, 1949, in San Pedro, Los Angeles. She was in the group only a short while before becoming pregnant by Cal Schenkel, Frank Zappa's official artist-in- residence. In publicity photos for the band, she is shown late in her pregnancy, with a big star painted on her stomach. She moved back to San Pedro with her infant daughter, Raven, and, after the GTOs broke up, married Bradley Harris. They had three children together. Sandra died of cancer in Albion, California, on April 23, 1991, at age 42. * Miss Sparky was born Linda Sue Parker in 1948 and was renowned for driving a Hudson Hornet in the late 1960s on the Sunset Strip.She and Pamela Des Barres attended Cleveland High School (Los Angeles) together. She recorded a vocal track (credited under the pseudonym Sharkie Barke) on the song \\"Disco Boy\\" on Frank Zappa's album Zoot Allures (1976) and was once employed by Universal Studios and Disney's Hollywood Studios . After leaving The GTOs she moved to New York and married an actor. History Pamela Miller and Linda Parker met around 1966 while attending Cleveland High School in Los Angeles. Christine Frka traveled to Los Angeles from San Pedro with Sandra Rowe, and both lived in the basement of Frank Zappa's Log Cabin at 2401 Laurel Canyon Boulevard in the Hollywood Hills in 1968. Frka was the live-in nanny for Zappa's eldest child Moon Unit before Miller took over the following year. Judith Peters had emigrated from the Haight Ashbury to Los Angeles due to \\"boredom\\", alleging she \\"couldn't be a hippie forever.\\" Cynthia Wells was brought into the group by Peters after the nucleus of the group had been formed. This accounts for Miss Cynderella's presence in some, but not all, of the GTOs' publicity shots. Lucy Offerall also was not an original member but joined after the recording of Permanent Damage. The group initially called themselves the Cherry Sisters but soon changed to the Laurel Canyon Ballet Company. Frank Zappa later changed their name to the GTOs, which he described as \\"an acronym which, as Stanley Booth wrote, could mean Girls Together Outrageously, Orally, or anything else starting with O.\\" On their album's inner sleeve, the acronym is also defined as \\"Girls Together Occasionally\\", \\"Girls Together Often\\", and \\"Girls Together Only\\". Miss Lucy stated in an interview that the latter name is what it stood for, though it is understood by most that the name on the album, Girls Together Outrageously, is the name of the group. The members were connected by their association with Zappa, who encouraged their artistic endeavors despite their limited vocal skills. The group performed live \\"only 4 or 5 times\\", although they created a strong impression at their December 1968 performance at the Shrine Auditorium opening for The Mothers of Invention, Alice Cooper and Wild Man Fischer. A mix of theatrics, singing, dancing, wild costumes, and unusual lyrical content were staples of their act. Their only album, Permanent Damage (Straight Records), was produced in 1969 by Zappa with the assistance of Lowell George and Russ Titelman on tracks 7 and 11. The latter track also features Titelman's brother-in-law, guitarist Ry Cooder, and both appear on Captain Beefheart's Safe as Milk album. Track 5 \\"The Captain's Fat Theresa Shoes\\" is a GTO comment on Beefheart's taste in footwear (his cousin Victor Hayden had introduced him to Pamela Des Barres). The songs are mixed with conversations among the members of the group, friends, and others, including Cynthia Plaster Caster and Rodney Bingenheimer. The album features songwriting contributions from Lowell George, Jeff Beck, Craig Doerge, and Davy Jones. A young Rod Stewart is featured on track 14. Permanent Damage was re-issued on CD in 1989 by Enigma Retro.

Kabarebe was a key figure in both the First Congo War and the Second Congo War as a commanding officer. Like many officers from both sides of those wars he is accused of leading numerous atrocities against civilians. From 10 April 2010 until 18 October 2018, he was the Rwandan Minister of Defence. He served as a Rwandan Patriotic Army Commander and was an Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo strategist. In his role of Minister of Defence he was accused of being the de facto leader of the March 23 Movement, a militia in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo also accused of numerous atrocities against civilians during the Kivu conflict. Early life and education James Kabarabe was born in 1959. Raised in Ibanda-Kazo area of western Uganda, he had his early primary education at Kyamate Primary School in western Uganda and attended O-level secondary education at Kabalega Secondary School in Masindi, Bunyoro Western Uganda. He proceeded for A level education at St. Henry's College Kitovu in 1979. He later attended Makerere University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics and Political Science. He was commissioned in 1989. Rwandan Patriotic Army James Kabarebe was the private secretary and aide- de-camp (ADC) of Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame. During the Rwandan Civil War, he became Commander of the High Command Unit at Mulindi. Later, this unit became the Republican Guard under Kagame's leadership. According to reports leaked from the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to reporter and author Judi Rever, Kabarebe presided over the massacre of Hutu civilians in Byumba, north of Kigali, in late April 1994. He arrived at the Byumba stadium and massacre site, \\"talked with his military colleagues,\\" and \\"after Kabarebe left, a Lieutenant Masumbuko gave the order to 'open fire on the refugess'\\", Rever reports in her 2018 book, In Praise of Blood. According to Rever, \\"Kabarebe's presence inside the stadium has been independently confirmed by several sources interviewed by the tribunal and by me.\\" First Congo War During the First Congo War, Kabarebe was the commanding officer of a Rwandan- led army that crossed into Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo).Gerard Prunier, Africa's World War, OUP 2009, pg. 183 The aim of the army was to defeat the ex-FAR and Interahamwe, Hutu militia groups that had committed the Genocide against the Tutsi and were engaged in cross-border attacks on Rwanda, destroy the refugee camps that the militia groups and Hutu civilians were living in, and overthrow Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko. As chief military strategist in Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila's rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (ADFL), Kabarebe helped engineer the capture of Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on May 17, 1997, and the defeat of Mobutu Sese Seko. At the end of this mission, he was appointed Chief of Staff of the Congolese Army by Kabila. However, relations between Rwanda and Kabila soon deteriorated in circumstances that would eventually lead to the Second Congo War. Fearing a coup d'√©tat, around 27 July 1998, Kabila dismissed Kabarebe from his post. Kabila then appointed General C√©lestin Kifwa, a Congolese who had previously served in Angola. Second Congo War In his time as chief of staff, the 10th division, stationed in eastern Congo, began adding more Banyamulenge, Banyarwanda and ex-FAR troops who tended to oppose Kabila.Gerard Prunier, Africa's World War, OUP 2009, pg. 177 Following his dismissal as Chief of Staff in July 1998, Kabarebe and Ugandan and Congolese allies began planning an attack on western Congo, intended to quickly topple the Kabila regime. On August 4, he led an airborne assault on Kitona Air Field airlifting with him around 3,000 RPA and UPDF soldiers. His troops advanced quickly, taking major ports and infrastructure in eastern Congo in a matter of days. In their march the coalition is alleged to have raped and murdered civilians and pillaged banks. In an effort to take Kinshasa the coalition cutoff the power to the city causing according to the UN \\"the death of an unknown number of civilians, particularly children and hospital patients.\\" By August 22 he had reached Kinshasa, but Zimbabwean, Namibian, and Angolan intervention prevented his troops from taking and deposing Kabila. He was forced to withdraw to Angola until final evacuation in December 1998. During the retreat of the coalition forces, the Angolan Armed Forces are alleged to have carried out similar atrocities as the coalition did on its march towards Kinshasa. Rwandan Defence Forces In October 2002, president Paul Kagame appointed James Kabarebe to the position of Chief of Defence Staff of the Rwandan Defence Forces (formerly Rwandan Patriotic Army). Accusations Kabarebe is one of ten Rwandan officials accused in 2006 by Jean-Louis Brugui√®re, a French judge, of having taken part in the shooting down of the plane of then-president Juvenal Habyarimana. Kabarebe and other senior official have denied these claims. In 2012, a report from a United Nations Security Council group of experts accused Kabarebe and other Rwandan officials of being the de facto leaders of the M23 militia. M23 is accused of carrying out killings, rapes and other atrocities in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Kabarebe and Rwanda deny the charges. In February, 2008, a Spanish judge issued arrest warrants against 40 Rwandan officers including Kabarebe. The warrant specifies his role in \\"the mass killing of Rwandan refugees and the Congolese civilian population. The found evidence of criminal activity against President Kagame as well but could not indict him due to his immunity as a head of state. Rwanda does not have an extradition treaty with Spain.

The theory of anacyclosis is based upon the Greek typology of constitutional forms of rule by the one, the few, and the many. Anacyclosis states that three basic forms of \\"benign\\" government (monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy) are inherently weak and unstable, tending to degenerate rapidly into the three basic forms of \\"malignant\\" government (tyranny, oligarchy, and ochlocracy). According to the doctrine, \\"benign\\" governments have the interests of all at heart, whereas \\"malignant\\" governments have the interests of a select few at heart. However, all six are considered unworkable because the first three rapidly transform into the latter three due to political corruption. The idea of anacyclosis influenced theorists of republicanism. Some of them, including Aristotle, Cicero, Machiavelli, Vico and Kant suggested that mixed government might help to stabilize republics and prevent permanent anacyclosis.  Polybius' sequence  Polybius' sequence of anacyclosis proceeds in the following order: 1. monarchy, 2. kingship, 3. tyranny, 4. aristocracy, 5. oligarchy, 6. democracy, and 7. ochlocracy. According to Polybius' elaboration of the theory,Histories, Book VI (full text) the state begins in a form of primitive monarchy. The state will emerge from monarchy under the leadership of an influential and wise king; this represents the emergence of \\"kingship\\". Political power will pass by hereditary succession to the children of the king, who will abuse their authority for their own gain; this represents the degeneration of kingship into \\"tyranny\\". Some of the more influential and powerful men of the state will grow weary of the abuses of tyrants, and will overthrow them; this represents the ascendancy of \\"aristocracy\\" (as well as the end of the \\"rule by the one\\" and the beginning of the \\"rule by the few\\"). Just as the descendants of kings, however, political influence will pass to the descendants of the aristocrats, and these descendants will begin to abuse their power and influence, as the tyrants before them; this represents the decline of aristocracy and the beginning of \\"oligarchy\\". As Polybius explains, the people will by this stage in the political evolution of the state decide to take political matters into their own hands. This point of the cycle sees the emergence of \\"democracy\\", as well as the beginning of \\"rule by the many\\". In the same way that the descendants of kings and aristocrats abused their political status, so too will the descendants of democrats. Accordingly, democracy degenerates into \\"ochlocracy\\", literally, \\"mob-rule\\". In an ochlocracy, according to Polybius, the people of the state will become corrupted, and will develop a sense of entitlement and will be conditioned to accept the pandering of demagogues. Eventually, the state will be engulfed in chaos, and the competing claims of demagogues will culminate in a single (sometimes virtuous) demagogue claiming absolute power, bringing the state full-circle back to monarchy.  Origin  This theory was developed in stages by the ancient Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle, but is mainly attributable to the ancient Greek historian Polybius. Polybius' explanation of anacyclosis is found in Book VI of The Histories.  Historical references  Cicero describes anacyclosis in his philosophical work De re publica. Machiavelli references anacyclosis in Book I, Chapter II in his Discourses on Livy. Francesco Sansovino described anacyclosis his 1583 work Propositioni, Overo Considerationi in Materia di Cose di Stato Sotto Titolo di Avvertimenti, Avvedimenti Civili & Concetti Politici. John Adams described anacyclosis in Letter XXXI (Ancient Republics, and Opinions of Philosophers) of his 1787 work Defense of the Constitutions of the United States.  Modern analysis  Anacyclosis was evaluated in detail by F. W. Walbank in his A Historical Commentary on Polybius (Oxford, 1957) (see Volume I, Book VI). Anacyclosis was also analyzed at length by G. W. Trompf in The Idea of Historical Recurrence in Western Thought (University of California, 1979) (see Chapter 1: The Polybian Anacyclosis or Cycle of Governments). In 2013, The Institute for Anacyclosis, a nonpartisan, nonprofit corporation, was incorporated to research anacyclosis and related ideas. The Institute for Anacyclosis has developed an updated model of anacyclosis based on the classical Polybian version. Jean-Claude Milner in his 2016 book Rereading the Revolution uses anacyclosis to read the French Revolution and its consequences.

He was elected in May 2015 as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Croydon South. In August 2019 he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. In September 2019 he was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary for the Ministry of Justice and in February 2020 at the Home Office. Prior to his political career, he was a businessman. Early years Philp was brought up in West Wickham, close to the border of Bromley and Croydon, where his mother, Edna (n√©e Mynott) was a primary school teacher and his father, Dr Brian Philp was an archaeologist. Philp was educated at a state primary school in West Wickham, St Olave's Grammar School in Orpington, and then at University College, Oxford, graduating with a first class bachelor's degree in Physics. In 1996 he was editor of the Oxford University student newspaper, Cherwell. He then completed a master's degree in theoretical quantum mechanics. Business career Philp worked for McKinsey and Company advising the boards of FTSE 100 companies before co-founding distribution business Blueheath Holdings, in 2000. The company grew from nothing to ¬£70 million of turnover in four years, and was floated on the AIM before merging with Booker Cash & Carry as part of the Booker Group in a ¬£375 million deal. He joined forces with Sam Gyimah, from 2010 a Conservative MP, to found Clearstone Training and Recruitment Limited, a HGV training provider, which sold its assets to RCaptial in 2007. Philp also founded property development lender Pluto Finance (UK) LLP, which is registered in the UK and the charity Next Big Thing, a business plan competition for inner-city teenagers which was eventually handed over to The Mercers' Company. Philp was voted London's Emerging Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young and The Times in 2003, alongside being voted the CBI's Entrepreneur of the Future in 2005. Political career Philp was Chairman of the Bow Group, a Conservative Party think tank, from 2004 to 2005. Philp defeated the Labour Leader of Camden Council to be become a Councillor in the Gospel Oak ward of Camden in May 2006 with a swing of over 10%, the first Conservative to win the ward in over 20 years. At the 2010 general election Philp was the Conservative Parliamentary candidate for Hampstead and Kilburn, losing by 42 votes to the Labour's sitting MP Glenda Jackson and increasing the Conservative vote share of the vote by nearly 10 percentage points compared to the previous election. Philp's book Conservative Revival: Blueprint for a Better Britain was published in conjunction with the Bow Group and was co-authored by 10 Conservative MPs, or recent candidates in their 30s. The book was an important contribution to the modernisation of the Conservative Party, with a foreword written by David Cameron, the then Leader of the Opposition. Philp was also the author of \\"Work for the Dole: A proposal to fix welfare dependency\\", published by The Taxpayers' Alliance in September 2013. His report called for mandatory participation in community work and training in return for the continued payment of benefits payments. In November 2013, Philp was selected to be the Conservative parliamentary candidate for Croydon South, the seat was held by the then Conservative MP Richard Ottaway, who was retiring at the next general election. On 7 May 2015, he was elected as the Member of Parliament for Croydon South, and with a majority of over 17,000; the highest achieved in the constituency for over 20 years. Shortly after being elected to Parliament, Philp became the first of the 2015 Conservative intake to be elected by other MPs to the influential Treasury Select Committee. Philp is an outspoken critic of Govia Thameslink Railway's ownership of Southern Rail, the performance of which he has described as \\"abysmal\\". Philp has called for the Government to take control of the Southern Rail franchise and for cross-party support in ending disputes between Southern Rail and the RMT Union. He proposed a Private Member's Bill to ban 'unreasonable' and 'damaging' strikes on essential services, including trains. Philp wrote \\"Restoring Responsible Ownership\\", a report on corporate rules which recommended greater shareholder control over company directors' appointments and pay. Philp's proposals received positive coverage for mounting 'pressure' and arguing that 'asset managers had to do much more to engage with companies, in particular to exert some degree of control over executive pay.' Philp was opposed to Brexit prior to the 2016 European membership referendum. Philp has publicly declared his support for grammar schools, stating 'grammar schools have proven an excellent way to help children from poorer backgrounds achieve their full potential.' In May 2016, when debating the Government's Starter Homes Initiative, Philp was accused by housing charities of failing to understand how a couple buying a house for the first time cannot afford a ¬£10,000 deposit. Responding to criticism, he stated 'No one says it is easy, the average age of a first time buyer these days is about 30 so people have 10 years to save ¬£5,000.' In 2017 Philp published his report 'Homes for Everyone', which called for radical changes to housing policy to improve affordability. The report was described as 'containing many ideas that deserve serious consideration if we are to make home ownership the norm for young people' by Robert Colvile, the Director of the Centre for Policy Studies. Following the 2017 General Election, Philp was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to HM Treasury Ministers. Philp was made PPS to Sajid Javid then Secretary of State for the Ministry Housing, Communities and Local Government on 22 January 2018. Between December 2018 to May 2019 he was the Conservative Party Vice Chairman for Policy. Philp led a successful campaign to cut business rates for small businesses in 2018. The cut in business rates featured in the 2018 October budget, during which Philp received thanks from the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, for proposing the policy. Philp is currently focused on campaigning against \\"over development\\" in the borough of Croydon to prevent the destruction of \\"family homes\\" in favour of blocks of flats.https://www.chrisphilp.com/residents-in-protest-for-major- planning-overhaul/ He has vocally opposed Croydon Borough Council's Labour administration's level of spending and has back a campaign for a Directly Elected Mayor for Croydon.https://www.chrisphilp.com/20000-local-residents- urge-council-to-hold-referendum-for-a-directly-elected-mayor-of-croydon- on-6-may-next-year/ In July 2019, Philp voted in favour of an amendment to allow same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland. Later that week, he addressed a large crowd at Croydon Pride and criticised the countries in the world where homosexuality is illegal, saying they should be \\"named and shamed\\". In August 2019, he was appointed as PPS to Sajid Javid, Chancellor of the Exchequer. Philp had backed Javid in the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election. In September 2019, he was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary for the Ministry of Justice. Personal life Philp married Elizabeth in 2009. Their twins, a boy and a girl, were born prematurely in April 2013, and spent an extended period in intensive care following their birth.

The men within the contubernium were known as contubernales. Ten contubernia were grouped into a centuria. Soldiers of a contubernium shared a tent, and could be rewarded or punished together as a unit. Organization The contubernium was, at least very late in the period (though it is possible the title existed in the late republic and early principate) led by a Decanus, who might crudely be described as the equivalent of a junior non-commissioned officer, however there is no evidence of a decanus exercising any kind of battlefield command role, regardless of any responsibilities they may have had in garrison or camp. They were presumably appointed from within the contubernium and were most likely the longest serving legionary. Their duties would likely have included organising the erection of the marching tent and ensuring their tent- mates kept things tidy. Two auxiliary ‚Äúservants‚Äù, vaguely equivalent to modern logistical support troops, were assigned to each contubernium. They were responsible for the care of the contubernium's pack mule, making sure that the legionaries had water during the march, and may have had special skills like blacksmithing or carpentry (however legionaries often fulfilled specialist roles so it is very possible that they were simply grooms and servants.) There were 10 contubernia (8 men) each led by a decanus, in a century (100 men including 20 support staff) which was commanded by a centurion.

It is the 21st century story of an old stage actor who has become a theater janitor in order to remain near \\"show biz\\". The theater has been overtaken by robot actors, made to look like humans, which act out plays under the direction of each venue's central computer. This \\"Maestro\\" runs the show, accommodating the kinds of factors which real actors would contend with: audience reactions, failing mechanical actors (when they are broken or one of the tapes that they get their programming from is worn), and other inconstant factors. The old actor dreams up a scheme to get himself back on stage, despite the prejudice against real acting. He destroys one of the robot's tapes, and since he knows the part from his previous career, he is the only way the show can go on. The old actor's problem is that he has always been a darfsteller (likely a portmanteau of \\"Darsteller\\", German for \\"actor/actress\\", with \\"darf\\", inflected form of \\"d√ºrfen\\", \\"to be at liberty to do something\\") which the narrator explains was a \\"self-directed actor... the undirectable portrayer whose acting welled from unconscious sources with no external strings\\", generally hated by directors even when they performed excellently.

State-of-the-art NER systems for English produce near-human performance. For example, the best system entering MUC-7 scored 93.39% of F-measure while human annotators scored 97.60% and 96.95%. Elaine Marsh, Dennis Perzanowski, \\"MUC-7 Evaluation of IE Technology: Overview of Results\\", 29 April 1998 PDFMUC-07 Proceedings (Named Entity Tasks) Named-entity recognition platforms Notable NER platforms include: *GATE supports NER across many languages and domains out of the box, usable via a graphical interface and a Java API. *OpenNLP includes rule-based and statistical named-entity recognition. *SpaCy features fast statistical NER as well as an open-source named-entity visualizer. Problem definition In the expression named entity, the word named restricts the task to those entities for which one or many strings, such as words or phrases, stands (fairly) consistently for some referent. This is closely related to rigid designators, as defined by Kripke, although in practice NER deals with many names and referents that are not philosophically \\"rigid\\". For instance, the automotive company created by Henry Ford in 1903 can be referred to as Ford or Ford Motor Company, although \\"Ford\\" can refer to many other entities as well (see Ford). Rigid designators include proper names as well as terms for certain biological species and substances, but exclude pronouns (such as \\"it\\"; see coreference resolution), descriptions that pick out a referent by its properties (see also De dicto and de re), and names for kinds of things as opposed to individuals (for example \\"Bank\\"). Full named-entity recognition is often broken down, conceptually and possibly also in implementations, as two distinct problems: detection of names, and classification of the names by the type of entity they refer to (e.g. person, organization, location and other). The first phase is typically simplified to a segmentation problem: names are defined to be contiguous spans of tokens, with no nesting, so that \\"Bank of America\\" is a single name, disregarding the fact that inside this name, the substring \\"America\\" is itself a name. This segmentation problem is formally similar to chunking. The second phase requires choosing an ontology by which to organize categories of things. Temporal expressions and some numerical expressions (i.e., money, percentages, etc.) may also be considered as named entities in the context of the NER task. While some instances of these types are good examples of rigid designators (e.g., the year 2001) there are also many invalid ones (e.g., I take my vacations in ‚ÄúJune‚Äù). In the first case, the year 2001 refers to the 2001st year of the Gregorian calendar. In the second case, the month June may refer to the month of an undefined year (past June, next June, every June, etc.). It is arguable that the definition of named entity is loosened in such cases for practical reasons. The definition of the term named entity is therefore not strict and often has to be explained in the context in which it is used.Named Entity Definition. Webknox.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-21. Certain hierarchies of named entity types have been proposed in the literature. BBN categories, proposed in 2002, is used for question answering and consists of 29 types and 64 subtypes. Sekine's extended hierarchy, proposed in 2002, is made of 200 subtypes.Sekine's Extended Named Entity Hierarchy. Nlp.cs.nyu.edu. Retrieved on 2013-07-21. More recently, in 2011 Ritter used a hierarchy based on common Freebase entity types in ground- breaking experiments on NER over social media text. =Formal evaluation= To evaluate the quality of a NER system's output, several measures have been defined. The usual measures are called Precision, recall, and F1 score. However, several issues remain in just how to calculate those values. These statistical measures work reasonably well for the obvious cases of finding or missing a real entity exactly; and for finding a non-entity. However, NER can fail in many other ways, many of which are arguably \\"partially correct\\", and should not be counted as complete success or failures. For example, identifying a real entity, but: * with fewer tokens than desired (for example, missing the last token of \\"John Smith, M.D.\\") * with more tokens than desired (for example, including the first word of \\"The University of MD\\") * partitioning adjacent entities differently (for example, treating \\"Smith, Jones Robinson\\" as 2 vs. 3 entities) * assigning it a completely wrong type (for example, calling a personal name an organization) * assigning it a related but inexact type (for example, \\"substance\\" vs. \\"drug\\", or \\"school\\" vs. \\"organization\\") * correctly identifying an entity, when what the user wanted was a smaller- or larger-scope entity (for example, identifying \\"James Madison\\" as an personal name, when it's part of \\"James Madison University\\". Some NER systems impose the restriction that entities may never overlap or nest, which means that in some cases one must make arbitrary or task-specific choices. One overly simple method of measuring accuracy, is merely to count what fraction of all tokens in the text were correctly or incorrectly identified as part of entity references (or as being entities of the correct type). This suffers from at least two problems: First, the vast majority of tokens in real-world text are not part of entity names, so the baseline accuracy (always predict \\"not an entity\\") is extravagantly high, typically >90%; and second, mispredicting the full span of an entity name is not properly penalized (finding only a person's first name when their last name follows might be scored as ¬Ω accuracy). In academic conferences such as CoNLL, a variant of the F1 score has been defined as follows: * Precision is the number of predicted entity name spans that line up exactly with spans in the gold standard evaluation data. I.e. when [Person Hans] [Person Blick] is predicted but [Person Hans Blick] was required, precision for the predicted name is zero. Precision is then averaged over all predicted entity names. * Recall is similarly the number of names in the gold standard that appear at exactly the same location in the predictions. * F1 score is the harmonic mean of these two. It follows from the above definition that any prediction that misses a single token, includes a spurious token, or has the wrong class, is a hard error and does not contribute positively to either precision or recall. Thus, this measure may be said to be pessimistic: it can be the case that many \\"errors\\" are close to correct, and might be adequate for a given purpose. For example, one system might always omit titles such as \\"Ms.\\" or \\"Ph.D.\\", but be compared to a system or ground-truth data that expects titles to be included. In that case, every such name is treated as an error. Because of such issues, it is important actually to examine the kinds of errors, and decide how important they are given one's goals and requirements. Evaluation models based on a token-by-token matching have been proposed. Such models may given partial credit for overlapping matches (such as using the Intersection over Union criterion. They allow a finer grained evaluation and comparison of extraction systems. Approaches NER systems have been created that use linguistic grammar-based techniques as well as statistical models such as machine learning. Hand-crafted grammar-based systems typically obtain better precision, but at the cost of lower recall and months of work by experienced computational linguists. Statistical NER systems typically require a large amount of manually annotated training data. Semisupervised approaches have been suggested to avoid part of the annotation effort. Many different classifier types have been used to perform machine-learned NER, with conditional random fields being a typical choice. Problem domains In 2001, research indicated that even state-of-the-art NER systems were brittle, meaning that NER systems developed for one domain did not typically perform well on other domains. Considerable effort is involved in tuning NER systems to perform well in a new domain; this is true for both rule-based and trainable statistical systems. Early work in NER systems in the 1990s was aimed primarily at extraction from journalistic articles. Attention then turned to processing of military dispatches and reports. Later stages of the automatic content extraction (ACE) evaluation also included several types of informal text styles, such as weblogs and text transcripts from conversational telephone speech conversations. Since about 1998, there has been a great deal of interest in entity identification in the molecular biology, bioinformatics, and medical natural language processing communities. The most common entity of interest in that domain has been names of genes and gene products. There has been also considerable interest in the recognition of chemical entities and drugs in the context of the CHEMDNER competition, with 27 teams participating in this task. Current challenges and research Despite the high F1 numbers reported on the MUC-7 dataset, the problem of named-entity recognition is far from being solved. The main efforts are directed to reducing the annotation labor by employing semi-supervised learning,Turian, J., Ratinov, L., & Bengio, Y. (2010, July).

From 1945 to 1947 he was associated with the Surrealists in Paris (a short-lived influence that is at its strongest in his first published work, Trait√© du pianiste (1946)). But it was with the highly personal ' (On the Motion and Immobility of Douve, 1953) that Bonnefoy found his voice and that his name first came to public notice.Shusha Guppy, \\"Yves Bonnefoy, The Art of Poetry No. 69\\", The Paris Review. Retrieved 1 June 2013. Bonnefoy's style is remarkable for the deceptive simplicity of its vocabulary. Bonnefoy's work has been translated into English by, among others, Emily Grosholz, Galway Kinnell, John Naughton, Alan Baker, Hoyt Rogers, Antony Rudolf, Beverley Bie Brahic and Richard Stamelmann. In 1967 he joined with Andr√© du Bouchet, Ga√´tan Picon, and Louis- Ren√© des For√™ts to found L'√©ph√©m√®re, a journal of art and literature. Commenting on his work, Bonnefoy has said: He taught literature at a number of universities in Europe and in the USA: Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts (1962‚Äì64); Centre Universitaire, Vincennes (1969‚Äì1970); Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore; Princeton University, New Jersey; University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut;Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut; University of Geneva; University of Nice (1973‚Äì1976); University of Provence, Aix (1979‚Äì1981); and Graduate Center, City University of New York, where he was made an honorary member of the Academy of the Humanities and Sciences. In 1981, following the death of Roland Barthes, he was given the chair of comparative study of poetry at the Coll√®ge de France. Bonnefoy died on 1 July 2016 at the age of 93 in Paris. President Fran√ßois Hollande stated of Bonnefoy on his death that he would be remembered for \\"elevating our language to its supreme degree of precision and beauty\\". Awards and honours Bonnefoy was honoured with a number of prizes throughout his creative life. Early on he was awarded the Prix des Critiques in 1971. Ten years later, in 1981, The French Academy gave him its grand prize, which was soon followed by the Goncourt Prize for Poetry in 1987. Over the next 15 years, Bonnefoy was awarded both the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca and the Balzan Prize (for Art History and Art Criticism in Europe) in 1995, the Golden Wreath of Struga Poetry Evenings in 1999, and the Grand Prize of the First Masaoka Shiki International Haiku Awards in 2000. Toward the final years of his life, Bonnefoy was recognized with the Franz Kafka Prize in 2007 and, in 2011, he received the Griffin Lifetime Recognition Award, presented by the trustees of the Griffin Poetry Prize. In 2014, he was co-winner of the Janus Pannonius International Poetry Prize. Yves Bonnefoy, Coll√®ge de France, 2004 (with Joumana Haddad).

Its name comes from the Proven√ßal word for capers, tapenas (). It is a popular food in the south of France, where it is generally eaten as an hors d'≈ìuvre spread on bread, and sometimes used to stuff poultry for a main course. History of similar dishes mortar Olive- based dishes with anchovies or vinegar are ubiquitous in Italian cuisine, documented in ancient Roman cookbooks dating back more than a thousand years before the appearance of the Occitan word tapenade. One of the earliest known of such Italian recipes, Olivarum conditurae, appears in Columella's De re Rustica written in the first century AD. Cato the Elder (234‚Äì149 B.C.) also includes a recipe for epityrum, an olive spread very much like a tapenade, in chapter 119 of his On Agriculture. The use of capers is the hallmark of recipes for tapenade. Sometimes tapenade is confused with New Orleans olive salad, a critical component in the New Orleans sandwich the muffaletta. New Orleans olive salad is more properly called a giardiniera. It also does not contain capers, but does contain cauliflower, carrots, and celery. Preparation The base ingredients of tapenade are olives and capers. The olives (most commonly black olive) and capers are chopped finely, crushed, or blended. Then olive oil is added gradually until the mixture becomes a paste. In various regions tapenade is often flavoured differently, with other ingredients such as garlic, herbs, anchovies, lemon juice, or brandy. Serving Tapenade may be used as part of an appetizer served as a topping on crusty bread or crudit√©s. It may be used as a condiment, as well. Tapenade is also used in preparing fish dishes.

Its name comes from its system of chronology based on the Christian paschal cycle; its Greek author named it Epitome of the ages from Adam the first man to the 20th year of the reign of the most August Heraclius. Structure The Chronicon Paschale follows earlier chronicles. For the years 600 to 627 the author writes as a contemporary historian--that is, through the last years of emperor Maurice, the reign of Phocas, and the first seventeen years of the reign of Heraclius. Like many chroniclers, the author of this popular account relates anecdotes, physical descriptions of the chief personages (which at times are careful portraits), extraordinary events such as earthquakes and the appearance of comets, and links Church history with a supposed Biblical chronology. Sempronius Asellio points out the difference in the public appeal and style of composition which distinguished the chroniclers (Annales) from the historians (Historia) of the Eastern Roman Empire. The \\"Chronicon Paschale\\" is a huge compilation, attempting a chronological list of events from the creation of Adam. The principal manuscript, the 10th-century Codex Vaticanus gr√¶cus 1941, is damaged at the beginning and end and stops short at 627. The Chronicle proper is preceded by an introduction containing reflections on Christian chronology and on the calculation of the Paschal (Easter) cycle. The so-called 'Byzantine' or 'Roman' era (which continued in use in Greek Orthodox Christianity until the end of Turkish rule as the 'Julian calendar') was adopted in the Chronicum as the foundation of chronology; in accordance with which the date of the creation is given as 21 March 5507bc. Authorship The author identifies himself as a contemporary of the Emperor Heraclius (610‚Äì641), and was possibly a cleric attached to the suite of the ≈ìcumenical Patriarch Sergius. The work was probably written during the last ten years of the reign of Heraclius. The chief authorities used were: Sextus Julius Africanus; the Fasti consulares; the Chronicle and Church History of Eusebius; John Malalas; the Acta Martyrum; the treatise of Epiphanius, bishop of Constantia (the old Salamis) in Cyprus (fl. 4th century), on Weights and Measures.

The 1st Earl was succeeded by his son Hugh O'Donnell, 2nd Earl of Tyrconnell, but both titles were attainted in 1614.

King James also created him Duke of Tyrconnell and Marquess of Tyrconnell in 1689, but these titles were recognised only by Jacobites (see Jacobite peerage).

It is the last Don Van Vliet recorded before abruptly retiring from music to devote himself to a career as a painter. It spent two weeks in the UK album charts, reaching number 90, but failed to make the Billboard Top 200.  Production  While Ice Cream for Crow was being produced, Herb Cohen had settled his lawsuit with Frank Zappa over the latter withholding the master tapes to Captain Beefheart's unreleased Bat Chain Puller album. Don Van Vliet proposed that half of the tracks from Bat Chain Puller be included on Ice Cream for Crow, but Zappa refused Vliet's request, leading Vliet to compose mostly new material for the album (the one exception is the a cappella track \\"81 Poop Hatch\\", which Vliet included from his own copy of the Bat Chain Puller tape, although \\"The Thousandth And Tenth Day Of The Human Totem Pole\\" was rerecorded). The songs \\"Semi-Multicolored Caucasian\\", \\"The Past Sure Is Tense\\" and \\"The Witch Doctor Life\\" had been written for earlier albums but not used. \\"Skeleton Makes Good\\" was written in one evening. According to Vliet's biographer Mike Barnes, \\"the most original and vital tracks [on the album] are the newer ones.\\" Thus, Ice Cream for Crow, while rooted in past musical ideas, points toward a new musical direction for Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band. Indeed, Barnes writes that the album \\"feels like an hors-d'oeuvre for a main course that never came\\".Barnes, Mike. Captain Beefheart: The Biography. London: Quartet Books, 2000.  Release and promotion  The album cover features a painting by Van Vliet and a portrait photo of him by Anton Corbijn. A music video was made to promote the title track, directed by Van Vliet and Ken Schreiber, with cinematography by Daniel Pearl, which was rejected by MTV for being \\"too weird\\". However, the video was included in the Letterman broadcast on NBC-TV, and was accepted into the Museum of Modern Art, where it has been used in several of their programs related to music.Music Video: The Industry and Its Fringes, Museum of Modern Art, September 6‚Äì30, 1985Looking at Music, Museum of Modern Art, August 13, 2008 ‚Äì January 5, 2009 Van Vliet explained in a 1982 interview on Late Night with David Letterman that the album's title represented the contrast between the black of a crow and the white of vanilla ice cream.Don Van Vliet , IMDb ‚Äì David Letterman \\"Episode dated 11 November 1982 (1982) TV episode (as Captain Beefheart) ...

Ned Raggett of AllMusic called the album \\"a last entertaining blast of wigginess from one of the few truly independent artists in late 20th century pop music, with humor, skill, and style all still intact\\", with the Magic Band \\"turning out more choppy rhythms, unexpected guitar lines, and outr√© arrangements, Captain Beefheart lets everything run wild as always, with successful results\\". Raggett says that Beefheart's \\"entertainingly outrageous\\" spoken word performances are successfully cohered with the Magic Band's \\"insanely great arrangement\\".

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Liberal from 1985 to 1990 and was a cabinet minister in the government of David Peterson. Background The son of Albert Charles Ward and Daniella Joy Griffiths, Ward was raised in Ontario and educated in Dundas. In 1971, he married Carol Suzanne Hunter. Politics He was elected a ward councillor in Flamborough in 1978, a regional councillor in 1980 and mayor in 1982. In 1984, Ward ran for the Ontario legislature in a by-election for the constituency of Wentworth North. He lost to Progressive Conservative Ann Sloat by 169 votes, but a few months later defeated Sloat by 5,168 votes in the 1985 provincial election amid a general surge in support for the Liberal Party. He was re- elected handily in the 1987 election. Ward served as parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Health from June 26, 1985 to January 9, 1987, and as the assistant to Attorney General Ian Scott from January to September 1987. He was promoted to cabinet as Minister of Education on September 29, 1987. Following a cabinet shuffle on August 2, 1989, he was named Minister of Government Services and Government House Leader. In the 1990 provincial election, Ward lost his seat to NDP candidate Don Abel by a mere 88 votes. During the campaign, Ward was targeted by a group of local lawyers who opposed the Peterson government's no-fault auto insurance program. He attempted to return to the legislature in the 1995 election, but lost to Progressive Conservative candidate Toni Skarica by over 10,000 votes. He supported Gerard Kennedy for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party in 1996. =Cabinet positions= Later life After leaving politics, Ward became Vice-President of Strategic Planning and Communications for Canada's Research-based Pharmaceutical Companies. He now runs Ward Health Strategies, a consulting firm based in Toronto and Washington, D.C.

Located under Millennium Park, the terminal was established in the 1800s by the Illinois Central Railroad (IC) and has gone through several re- configurations. Most recently, it was rebuilt in the early 21st century and is owned by Metra through its operating arm, the Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter Railroad Corporation. Not counting commuters on the South Shore Line, over 18,000 people board Metra trains at Millennium Station each day.On the Bi-Level, October 2007. During peak periods, trains leave the terminal as frequently as twice a minute. It is the third-busiest train station in Chicago.  History  Randolph Street station, 1895 As Great Central Station, Randolph Street terminal, along with Van Buren Street a few blocks south, was IC's primary downtown Chicago terminal until the completion in 1893 of Central Station (closed 1972) just south of Grant Park at today's Roosevelt Road. It still received many trains thereafter, but was of secondary importance. Its importance increased dramatically in 1926 with the electrification of commuter services on IC's main line and its Blue Island and South Chicago branches. Commuter trains from all three branches were now routed into the Randolph Street terminal, while intercity traffic continued to terminate at Central Station. For many years, the station platforms were exposed and the ticketing facilities and the waiting room were located in the attached facility. The construction of Millennium Park gradually placed the entire station \\"underground.\\" Randolph Street Station existed in a state of perpetual construction from the mid-1980s until 2005: exposed steel girders covered in flame retardant, unpainted plywood walls, bare concrete floors, and dim utility lights created a notoriously unfriendly, cave-like environment. Skidmore, Owings and Merrill was the architect for the station redesign. With the completion of construction in 2005, the station was renamed Millennium Station. However, many longtime Chicago-area residents still call it \\"Randolph Street Terminal.\\"  Bus connections  CTA * 3 King Drive * 4 Cottage Grove (Owl Service) * 6 Jackson Park Express * 19 United Center Express * 20 Madison * 26 South Shore Express * 60 Blue Island/26th * N66 Chicago (Owl Service) * 124 Navy Pier * 143 Stockton/Michigan Express * 147 Outer Drive Express * 148 Clarendon/Michigan Express * 151 Sheridan * 157 Streeterville/Taylor Pace * 855 Plainfield-East Loop Express ChicaGo Dash *Shuttle Service between Downtown Chicago and Valparaiso (Rush Hour Only)  Pedway connections  Millennium Station serves as a nexus of several Chicago Pedway connections, which links it to several hotels, residential buildings, office buildings, \\"L\\" stations and other notable locations. The pedway itself hosts a number of shops, eateries and services.

Paul, along with his brother Thomas Elmer Braniff, was one of the original founders of Braniff Airways, Inc. d/b/a Braniff International Airways (after 1948). 1929 Braniff file photo of Paul Revere Braniff, founder of Paul Revere Braniff, Inc. in his pilot uniform. Early years and family Paul Revere Braniff was born in Kansas City, Kansas. He grew up during the early era of aviation, and, as a youngster, became fascinated with the new way of transport. His family moved to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in 1900. Paul Revere Braniff met Marie Agnes Maney and they married on April 29, 1920. Marie Maney was born on May 2, 1898, in El Reno, Oklahoma. She was the daughter of James W. Maney, who was an Oklahoma Territory Pioneer. He built thousands of miles of railroads throughout the Western United States. His occupation was Civil Engineer and was President of the Clinton and Western Oklahoma Railroad and founded a chain of grain elevators in the Enid, Oklahoma area. Marie Maney grew up at Maney House in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, that is now a historically protected property. She attended and graduated from schools in Baltimore, Maryland. Marie Agnes Braniff was highly interested in her husband's work. When he founded Paul R. Braniff, Inc. and then its successor Braniff Airways, Inc., she traveled with him scouting new routes. Mrs. Braniff's great love for Paul and his aviation interests led her to compile a very detailed archive on the history of Braniff Airways. She remained highly interested and involved in the preservation of Braniff history even after Paul Braniff's death in 1954. Paul and his wife Marie settled into a Northwest Oklahoma City home shortly after they married, that Mrs. Braniff lived in until her death on April 29, 1988. After Paul's death in 1954, Mrs. Braniff worked as a records archivist at the Oklahoma State Capital Building. She also worked at the St. Thomas More Book Store, also in Oklahoma City. She was active at her church, teaching Sunday School at it, the St. Francis Assisi Catholic Church. She was a member of the Legion of Mary at the same church. Paul and Marie had one child, a son, John Paul Braniff, who was born on October 29, 1927. John Braniff died in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on February 1, 2013, at the age of 85. Military service Paul Braniff joined the United States Army during World War I as a mechanic and private on July 6, 1917. He went to France, becoming a corporal, then a temporary sergeant. In France, he learned to shoot, becoming an avid gunman, although he never used this ability other than for warfare. After being honorably discharged from the Army, he joined brother Tom in an insurance company that carried the family's name. Paul Revere, however, kept dreaming about aviation all along and received his pilot's license in 1917. He obtained Transport License Number 690 from Orville Wright. In 1924, Mr. Braniff was able to buy his own aircraft. Oklahoma Aero Club and Paul R. Braniff, Inc. Paul Braniff founded his own flying company soon after, eventually helping convince Tom Braniff and other investors to bring money and form the Oklahoma Aero Club, in 1927. Reserved for use of the six investors, the company was registered as the Paul R. Braniff, Inc., thus marking the first birth of Braniff Airways. Paul Revere Braniff flew the company's first flight on June 20, 1928, from Oklahoma City to Tulsa, Oklahoma in a 5-passenger single engine Stinson Detroiter aircraft. Records indicate that there were flights between the two cities prior to the June 20 date. However, company records began recording flights on that date. Charles Lindbergh's monumental 1927 Atlantic crossing sparked massive interest in aviation around the nation. In Oklahoma, the interest was manifested in the Oklahoma Air Tour of 1928. Sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce of Oklahoma, it involved aviators flying to various Oklahoma town expressing an interest in aviation. The five-day tour, departing Oklahoma City on May 14, 1928, flew eighteen thousand cumulative miles and stopped at eighteen towns. An estimated 100,000 people turned out to view the twenty two aircraft and hear the pilots, that included Paul R. Braniff, promote the benefits of commercial aviation. The Oklahoma cities of Altus, Miami, and Guthrie, built airports specifically for air tour usage. The Tour was operated again in 1929, but the onslaught of the Depression ended any further air races. At the time, the airline was very involved with the National Transcontinental air race. In April, 1929 the company was sold to Aviation Corporation of America or AVCO, the predecessor of American Airlines, Inc. In Mexico In 1929, Paul Revere Braniff left the United States to go to Mexico to help someone build a struggling Mexican airline company (apparently this person was Alberto Braniff, but no evidence of this, nor of Alberto Braniff being related to the American Braniff brothers, has ever been reported). In November of that year, Paul R. Braniff, Inc., had merged with Universal Airlines, to become a real airline company, acquiring that airline's planes and setting up headquarters in St. Louis. In April, 1929 the company was sold to Aviation Corporation of America or AVCO, the predecessor of American Airlines, Inc. Paul Revere Braniff remained in Mexico until 1930. Braniff Airways, Inc. While in Mexico, he gained airline industry expertise. He returned to the United States with innovative ideas for a new Braniff, including the use of faster aircraft that he knew would help the airline by bringing quicker turn-around times and, as a consequence, enable the airline to carry more passengers. With that idea, Paul R. Braniff convinced Tom Braniff and the other four investors to buy two Lockheed Vega aircraft. Braniff Airways, Inc. was formed in November, 1930. Paul R. Braniff headed to Washington, D.C. in 1934, being called to testify before the congress, which was heading an investigation against air mail services. Paul R. Braniff returned to St. Louis with a contract for Braniff Airlines to carry mail, the first time the airline had obtained an airmail contract. Paul R. Braniff then set on exploring new markets for the company that bore his last name. In 1936, Mr. Braniff headed to Brazil, and he returned to St. Louis convinced that Braniff would do great economically if established in South America. The carrier was awarded a 7719-mile route from the Mainland US to far South America in 1946 with service beginning in 1948. Braniff Airways, Inc. began doing business as Braniff International Airways with the beginning of South America service. Paul Braniff had been running the day-to-day operations of the airline but decided to leave the carrier in 1935. Mr. Braniff was replaced by Charles Edmund Beard who would eventually become the President of Braniff Airways in 1954. Intending to retire from aviation, Paul Braniff sold the airline to his brother Tom. It was after Paul Revere Braniff left that Braniff International Airways became a major player in United States-South America travel and vice versa, as Braniff International Airways began daily flights to various points in that continent and to Europe after the jet era began, with their distinctive livery that included many colors not seen before on aircraft fuselages. Braniff Engineering Corporation Paul Revere Braniff went to Oklahoma to try to work as a mechanic, and he established the Braniff Engineering Corporation. That company was the first one to introduce the Lennox Air Conditioners and heating systems in Oklahoma. World War II Then 44 years old, Paul R. Braniff was re-called into military service as the United States entered World War II, in 1941. Paul Revere Braniff would fly aircraft, this time with the Army's ninth air troop carrier command, in England. But, after his second service in the military was over, so was his flying career. Later years and death He later worked as an advisor for the Douglas Company in Los Angeles. He decided to move to Oklahoma, where he worked another aviation-related company as salesman, selling used aircraft parts to customers. Paul Revere Braniff was diagnosed with cancer later in his life, and he went on to spend his last couple of years relatively inactive. Expected to survive his cancer, Mr. Braniff suffered a cold in the summer of 1954, which later turned into a pneumonia. He had surgery to correct the pneumonia, but the surgery aggravated his cancer disease, He died on June 15, 1954, from complications of cancer that his doctors stated was directly connected with his pneumonia and resulting surgery.

They may be annuals, herbaceous perennials or subshrubs that vary greatly in size, from small species a few centimeters tall to enormous perennials over tall. They carry yellow daisy- like composite flowerheads often with narrow ray-florets. Some common characteristics include pappus with bristles, flat capitulum, and lack of chaff. Several species are popular flowers for the garden, with cultivation going back to antiquity. The smaller species are used in rock gardens and the more common larger ones, which tend to have very coarse foliage, in borders.  Etymology  The genus name Inula, of uncertain origin, was already used by the Romans. The Latin phrase inula campana (field inula) gave rise to the English whose scientific name is Inula helenium.

On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune of Villedieu-les-Po√™les-Rouffigny.Arr√™t√© pr√©fectoral 16 October 2015 Its inhabitants are called Sourdins from the French sourd meaning deaf. Most of the people involved in the manufacturing of copper pans, which involved repeated hammering, became deaf. Geography Pont-Farcy lies to the east, Saint-L√¥ to the north, Vire to the South-East and Granville to the west. Economy It is traditionally a centre of metal-work, especially the brass and copper pans and basins from which the po√™les in its name derives. It is also famous for its artisanal manufacture of large church bells, which was started by immigrants from Lorraine around 1780. In addition to metal-work, current industries are a slaughterhouse and a cheese factory. Tourism now plays a large part in the local economy. Villedieu also provides services for the surrounding countryside, such as a hospital and a retirement home. History Villedieu owes its name to the religious order Knights Hospitaller, that later became the Knights of Malta. Henry I, King of England and Duke of Normandy, granted Villedieu to this order in the 12th century. Low taxes and good administration attracted people to Villedieu. Advanced coppersmithing technology was presumably imported from the Middle East by the Knights. By the early 14th century, the Corporation of the Coppersmiths of Villedieu was officially recognized by the Kings of France. In the years following the French Revolution, in the late 18th century, the people of Villedieu were strong supporters of the Revolution, unlike most of people in the surrounding area. A major reason of their support is that the Revolution abolished customs duties between French regions; before the Revolution, copper pans exported from Villedieu to Brittany, away, faced higher import duties than copper pans from Portugal. After a losing battle with Chouan troops, the men from Villedieu escaped thanks to their women who threw stones, flowerpots and chamber pots from second-story windows at the pursuing Chouans. The general heading the Chouan troops was getting ready to bombard Villedieu and set it on fire. A delegation of women negotiated with him: the inhabitants were given a short time to hide their valuables and the Chouan soldiers then plundered the town for food and clothing. In 1944, when the Germans withdrew from Villedieu, they left a sniper who shot some of the first US soldiers to enter Villedieu, before being neutralized. The US commander was about to request airplane bombing runs when the mayor approached him, told him that there were no Germans left in Villedieu and offered to ride through Villedieu in the front seat of a US jeep. Villedieu was thus one of the few towns in the region to escape major destruction. =Heraldry= See also *Communes of the Manche department  References  Villedieulespoeles ","title":"Villedieu-les-Po√™les"},{"id":"1906737","text":"Municipal Auditorium is a multi-purpose facility located in Kansas City, Missouri. It opened in 1936 and features Streamline Moderne and Art Deco architecture and architectural details. Background Municipal Auditorium was the first building built as part of the \\"Ten-Year Plan\\", a bond program that passed by a 4 to 1 margin in 1931. The campaign was run by the Civic Improvement Committee chaired by Conrad H. Mann. Other buildings in the plan included the Kansas City City Hall and the Kansas City branch of the Jackson County Courthouse. The plan was championed by most local politicians including Thomas Pendergast and provided Pendergast with many patronage opportunities during the Great Depression. Municipal Auditorium replaced Convention Hall which was directly across the street and was torn down for parking to create what is now called the Barney Allis Plaza. The streamline moderne architecture was designed by the lead architectural firm of Alonzo H. Gentry, Voskamp & Neville. Gentry later completed the design of the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum after the death of the original architect, Edward F. Neild. Homer F. Neville was the lead designer for Municipal Auditorium. Hoit, Price & Barnes, the associated architects were responsible for the design of the mechanical work (HVAC, electrical, plumbing). William L. Cassell directed that design effort. Cassell went on to start his own firm in 1933 which is still in business as W. L. Cassell & Associates, Inc. Henry F. McElroy, the choice of Tom Pendergast and other Democratic leaders to be City Manager, announced on January 5, 1932, that the architectural services for Municipal Auditorium would be divided between the firm of Gentry, Voskamp & Neville and the firm of Hoit, Price & Barnes. In addition, Gentry's firm would take the lead. The decision was controversial and led to lengthy contract negotiations. Gentry's firm was much smaller, while Hoit, Price & Barnes were known for their work in designing the Kansas City Power and Light Building, an Art Deco skyscraper completed in 1931; the 32-story Fidelity Bank Building at 909 Walnut; Corinthian Hall; and many more Kansas City buildings and residences. Municipal Auditorium, however, was a public project and Gentry, whose father had been a prominent Democratic politician in Independence, was the preference of the Pendergast machine. According to Neville, there was little interference with the building's design. When the building opened in 1935, the Architectural Record called it \\"one of the 10 best buildings of the world that year\\". In 2000, the Princeton Architectural Press called it one of the 500 most important architectural works in the United States. Municipal Auditorium is connected to the H. Roe Bartle Convention Center via skywalks over 14th and Central streets. An underground walkway through a public parking garage provides access to the Kansas City Marriott Downtown, and the Holiday Inn Aladdin Hotel.

During his time in C√≥rdoba Thays became infatuated with the young country and decided to spend the rest of his life in Argentina. After moving to Buenos Aires he was named the city's Director of Parks & Walkways in 1891. This position gave him significant influence over the design of the city's open spaces, and his legacy is still strongly felt in the city's open spaces today. Major projects included tree planting along streets, remodeling and designing public plazas and walkways as well as designing completely new parks and expanding older ones. Major parks and plazas that particularly show Thays influence on Buenos Aires include the parks Centenario, Lezama, Patricios, Barrancas de Belgrano and the plazas Constituci√≥n, Congreso, and Mayo. Thays' French heritage is reflected in many of his designs, in so far that Buenos Aires' parks and plazas are often compared to similar designs in Paris. One of Thays' largest undertakings was the Parque Tres de Febrero, a sweeping area of open land covering several square kilometers filled with thousands of trees, flowers, many fountains, and monuments in the barrio of Palermo. A pet project of his was the Buenos Aires Botanical Garden, for which he petitioned the city government to set aside land (almost 8 hectares), which he designed in sections to display plants organised by continent, with a large section devoted to the native plants of Argentina, which were ignored in garden-making at the time. The garden has the first Ginkgo biloba planted in Argentina. Completed in 1898, it bears his name, the Jard√≠n Bot√°nico Carlos Thays de la Ciudad Aut√≥noma de Buenos Aires. One greenhouse, was first erected at the Paris Exposition of 1889 and brought in sections from France to be reassembled, one of five in the garden. A brick house in the English Gothic Revival style, in which he lived during the construction and planting of the garden, now houses the herbarium and a small botanical library. Plaza del Congreso, Buenos Aires While Thays worked primarily in Buenos Aires throughout the years he also worked on many civic projects in other areas of Argentina, remodeling the Parque Sarmiento), C√≥rdoba, designing the Parque Urquiza in Parana, Entre Rios, Parque 9 de Julio in San Miguel de Tucum√°n, the Parque de la Independencia in Rosario, and the Parque San Martin in Mendoza. Thays also designed the grounds of the luxurious Club Hotel de la Ventana, near Sierra de La Ventana in Buenos Aires Province. Work outside Argentina included the urban planning of the residential neighborhood of Carrasco, aid in the planning of the Parque Rod√≥, and the design of the Plaza Cagancha and Plaza Independencia in Montevideo, Uruguay. Thays worked most extensively in Buenos Aires precisely at a period in the city's history where it was growing extremely fast as a result of immigration, especially from Spain and Italy. It is often noted that had Thays not insisted on high standards of design and frequent open spaces, many of the city's current open spaces would probably not exist. Next to the Perito Francisco Moreno and other prominent figures founded July 4, 1912 Boy Scouts Association of Argentina. Thays died in Buenos Aires in 1934.

The pranks are usually carried out at the end of the senior school year as a going away mark on the school, and in some cases have become something of a tradition. This is known as muck-up day in Australia and the United Kingdom. The pranks are often planned out very well before they are actually done in order to work out details such as not being caught or blamed for the disruption they cause. Often these are harmless and more often hilarious pranks, but sometimes the pranks can be taken too far, causing serious problems such as damage to school property and resulting in arrests and large fines. United States Part of a senior prank at a school in New Hampshire, in which several doorways were blocked with chairs The practice has been banned within some schools in the United States, and replaced with formal leaving activities to ensure students do not commit crimes or vandalise school or other property. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, \\"muck-up days\\" are common in independent schools and state schools, and members of staff (particularly grounds staff and porters) often unofficially assist the perpetrators. Examples of such traditions include stealing the school's clocks as makeshift trophies or removing styluses for interactive whiteboards. Australia In Australia, muck-up days are a common practice in many schools, although their nature has evolved over the years such that activities are usually pre-approved by staff (e.g., a year coordinator) and may not harm staff, students or property. Notable pranks have been dyeing the swimming pool purple and bringing pigs to school. Common pranks Common senior pranks include but are not limited to: adopting unusual or fancy dress, using water pistols, stink bombs, water bombs or shaving cream on each other or on teachers, issuing fake announcements over the public address system, starting barbecues in unusual places, imposing parking levies on the staff car park, issuing staff with detentions or uniform infringements, putting small polystyrene balls in the air conditioning, thus making it 'snow' in the building, chalk graffiti, filling elevators with hay or spreading bird seed in the staff parking lot to attract birds that then deconstruct the cars, setting up tents and making it appear that the seniors had camped overnight on school grounds, or having a party in a faculty/underclassmen parking lot to confuse the parking situation. At some schools that ordinarily have strict uniform policies, teachers turn up in full school uniform on the day, and the students in free dress. Some schools announce a day off for the rest of the school, while others conduct an assembly to formally farewell the final-year students during the day's events. More extreme examples Incidents such as graffiti, vandalism or harming other students are dealt with in a number of ways, as the students despite finishing school have not yet graduated and, in the case of students enrolled in academic subjects, have yet to sit their exams. In extreme cases, or those involving non-students who turn up on the day, the police may be called. At Scotch College in Perth, the Year 12 boys' valedictory dinner was cancelled by the school after some students vandalised and ran partially naked through two nearby girls' schools.

He was a professional athlete, Churches of Christ pastor and church planter, ceremonial officer and a pioneering campaigner for reconciliation. Nicholls was the first Aboriginal Australian to be knighted when he was appointed Knight Bachelor in 1972 (he was subsequently appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1977). He was also the first ‚Äî and to date the only ‚Äî Indigenous Australian to be appointed to vice-regal office, serving as Governor of South Australia from 1 December 1976 until his resignation on 30 April 1977 due to poor health. Early life Nicholls was born on 9 December 1906 on the Cummeragunja Reserve in New South Wales.Clark, Mavis Thorpe (1956). Pastor Doug: The Story of Sir Douglas Nicholls Aboriginal Leader (Rev. ed.). Melbourne: Lansdowne Press. SBN 8018-0017-8.Richard Broome, Sir Douglas Ralph (Doug) (1906‚Äì1988), Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, , published first in hardcopy 2012, accessed online 19 December 2015. He was the youngest of five children born to Herbert Nicholls and Florence Atkinson. His paternal grandfather was Aaron Atkinson, who was the brother of William Cooper. Schooling at Nicholls's mission was provided to Grade 3 standard and strict religious principles were emphasised. When he was eight, he saw his 16-year-old sister Hilda forcibly taken from his family by the police and taken to the Cootamundra Domestic Training Home for Aboriginal Girls where she was trained to become a domestic servant. At 13 Nicholls worked with his uncle as a tar boy and general hand on sheep stations, and he lived with the shearers. He worked hard and had a cheerful disposition. This annoyed one of the shearers so much that he challenged Nicholls to a fight, with the loser to hand over one week's pay (30 shillings ‚Äì $3). After six rounds the shearer who challenged him conceded defeat. Sporting career Northcote Football Club's 1929 premiership side. Doug Nicholls is second from right, front row. Nicholls played Australian rules football. After playing in the Goulburn Valley for Tongala, Nicholls tried out for VFL clubs and before the 1927 season; Nicholls played some seconds matches for Carlton but did not play a senior game. He subsequently joined the Northcote Football Club in the VFA, and became a regular in the Northcote team by 1929. He made his name as an energetic and speedy wingman, capable of spectacular feats, and came to be regarded as the best wingman in the VFA at the time. At 5'2\\", he was one of the shortest players in the game. He was a member of Northcote's 1929 premiership team, and finished third in the Recorder Cup voting in 1931, his final season with Northcote. In 1932, Nicholls joined the VFL's Fitzroy Football Club and in 1935, he was the first Aboriginal player to be selected to play for the Victorian interstate team, ultimately playing four interstate games. He played a total of six seasons for Fitzroy, before returning to Northcote in 1938. Knee injuries forced him to retire in 1939. He returned to Northcote as non-playing coach in 1947. During his career, particularly in the early years, Nicholls was subjected to onfield taunts or ostracised by his team-mates due to his colour. Nevertheless, he became a popular player among spectators; and, upon joining Fitzroy, when he was initially sitting by himself in the change rooms (due to this ostracism), he was befriended by Haydn Bunton, Sr. who ensured he was made welcome within the team. Like his close relative Lynch Cooper, Nicholls was also a very capable sprinter. He competed in gift races around Victoria during the athletics seasons, and in 1928 he won both the Nyah and Warracknabeal Gifts. Following this, the race organisers paid him an appearance fee, board and expenses to enter races. He was the inaugural chairman of the National Aboriginal Sports Foundation. Playing football provided employment during the winter. To earn a living during the rest of the year, he boxed with Jimmy Sharman's Boxing Troupe, a travelling sideshow in which Sharman offered his fighters for challenge against all comers. During World War II, Nicholls was an adept boomerang thrower, teaching that skill to some members of the United States military. There is a photograph depicting this in the Australian War Memorial archives.Australian War Memorial website. 1944-09-04 Doug Nicholls, an Australian Aborigine and ex-Fitzroy footballer, demonstrating the art of throwing a boomerang to Lieutenant Colonel Forrest M.Carhartt of the United States Army. He also organised and captained Aboriginal teams in football matches used for patriotic fundraisers during the war, many of which were played against Northcote. The long road to the 1967 Referendum Tom Foster, Jack Kinchela (obscured), Doug Nicholls, William Cooper, and Jack Patten reading the resolution of the Aborigines Progressive Association at the All Australian Aboriginal Conference and Day of Mourning at Australian Hall, Sydney on 26 January 1938. William Cooper, an uncle to Nicholls, mentored him in leadership, eventually placing him as the secretary of the Australian Aborigines' League. It was a founding principle of the League that Aboriginal Affairs was made a Federal matter, which would require a change in the Constitution of Australia, which could only be effected by a referendum. As early as February 1935 Cooper, Nicholls and others were lobbying Members of Parliament, such as Thomas Paterson, the Commonwealth minister for the interior on this issue. It gained national attention when Nicholls, leveraging his profile as a nationally famous athlete, participated in the Day of Mourning protest for Aborigines held in Sydney on 26 January 1938, where Indigenous leaders from across the country made the demand to change the Constitution. The proposed resolution was: > WE, representing THE ABORIGINES OF AUSTRALIA, assembled in conference at the > Australian Hall, Sydney, on the 26th day of January, 1938, this being the > 150th Anniversary of the Whiteman's seizure of our country, HEREBY MAKE > PROTEST against the callous treatment of our people by the whitemen during > the past 150 years, AND WE APPEAL to the Australian nation of today to make > new laws for the education and care of Aborigines, we ask for a new policy > which will raise our people TO FULL CITIZEN STATUS and EQUALITY WITHIN THE > COMMUNITY. Doug Nicholls rose to support the resolution on behalf of the Victorian Aborigines League that day, saying: > On behalf of Victorian Aborigines I want to say that we support this > resolution in every way. The public does not realise what our people have > suffered for 150 years. Aboriginal girls have been sent to Aboriginal > Reserves and have not been given any opportunity to improve themselves. > Their treatment has been disgusting. The white people have done nothing for > us whatever. Put on Reserves, with no proper education, how can Aborigines > take their place as equals with whites? Now is our chance to have things > altered. We must fight our very hardest in this cause. After 150 years our > people are still bossed and influenced by white people. I know that we could > proudly hold our own with others if given the chance. Do not let us forget, > also, those of our own people who are still in a primitive state. It is for > them that we should try to do something. We should all work in co-operation > for the progress of Aborigines throughout the Commonwealth. Nicholls was one of the founders of the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders The movement took 30 years to coalesce and achieve anything like its stated goal, but it soon made its focus the Constitution of Australia which, in its original form, prevented the Commonwealth from making any law that would benefit the Aboriginal people. In 1949, a letter written by Nicholls prompted the Labor MP, Kim Beazley Sr. to write to Prime Minister Ben Chifley asking him to explore how the Constitution could be amended. In 1957, Jessie Street approached Nicholls about bringing in the Victorian Aboriginal Advancement League to form a federal council to campaign for Aboriginal affairs to become a federal matter ‚Äî this would become the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. Its early work involved drafting and collecting petitions, from suburbs and town centres from across the country. By 1962 they had achieved 100,000 signatures with the stated goal of 250,000 signatures. The movement supporting a change to the constitution, which removed the block on the Federal Government making a laws regarding Aboriginal people, soon became known as the \\"yes\\" campaign.

With him are several members of (FCAATSI) ‚Äì from left to right: Gordon Bryant, Faith Bandler, Harold Holt, Doug Nicholls, Burnum Burnum, Winnie Branson, and Bill Wentworth. FCAATSI would later become the central lobby group who were able to interface with the Federal Government. During this time Pastor Doug was known to have met and negotiated with Prime Ministers Robert Menzies and Harold Holt. However, creating the political momentum involved substantial grass roots action. Nicholls' daughter, Pam recalls her father winning support from white Australians at football games: > ‚ÄúWith his friend Alick Jackomos, they used to have a card table and go and > sit outside the football giving out papers, giving speeches, beckoning > people to come sign the petitions for the ‚Äòyes‚Äô vote.\\" Nicholls interacted with the media frequently. Drawing on his abilities as a preacher, he was able to deliver pithy, persuasive messages which were effective in winning over the Australian public. One common line of argument he made was for the \\"Yes\\" vote was: > ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a matter of democratic right. And we will form a part of the > British commonwealth of nations and there should be no legislation setup to > discriminate us. The 1967 Australian referendum was an emphatic success for Nicholls and the FCAATSI leadership, with an average of 90% of Australians supporting the change they had asked for. Following the successful outcome of the referendum, Pastor Doug argued that much more than a legal change had been made, rather, it was: > ‚Ä¶ evidence that Australians recognise Aborigines are part of the nation. Community work and Christian ministry Nicholls was a minister and social worker with Aboriginal people. Following his mother's death he took a renewed interest in Christianity and was baptised at Northcote Church of Christ (now Northern Community Church of Christ) in 1935. He officiated at church and hymn services as a lay preacher at the Gore Street Mission Centre in Fitzroy. In 1941 Nicholls received his call-up notice and he joined the 29th Battalion but, in 1942, at the request of the Fitzroy police, he was released from his unit to work as a social worker in the Fitzroy Aboriginal community. He cared for those trapped in alcohol abuse, gambling, and other social problems, and those who were in trouble with the police. Indigenous people gathered to him and eventually the group was so large that he became the pastor of the first Aboriginal Church of Christ in Australia. In recognition of the ministry he was already expressing, he was ordained as a minister. In a letter to the editor, in 1953, it was noted that Opposition Leader, H. V. Evatt, had asked the Prime Minister Robert Menzies, on 26 February, in Federal Parliament, 'for an invitation to be extended to Capt. Reg Saunders or some other outstanding representative of the aborigines' to be included in the official Australian contingent to the coronation of Elizabeth II. The author suggested Nicholls, as an ordained minister, and for his community work in the areas of Fitzroy and Mooroopna. In 1957 Nicholls became a field officer for the Aborigines Advancement League. He edited their magazine, Smoke Signals, and helped draw Aboriginal issues to the attention of Government officials and the general public. He pleaded for dignity for Aboriginal people as human beings. Support for the AAL grew rapidly. Nicholls helped set up hostels for Aboriginal children, holiday homes for Aboriginal people at Queenscliff and was a founding member and Victorian Secretary of the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders (FCAATSI). In response to protests in the 1950s and 60s for an independent, Aboriginal-run farming cooperative at Lake Tyers Mission he campaigned on their behalf, but when the board moved to close Lake Tyers, Nichols resigned his position in protest.A brief history of the Lake Tyers Aboriginal community, By Jeff Waters, ABC Radio, 21 Dec 2013 Nicholls was an active Freemason.Biographies of Doug and Gladys Nicholls , Council of Melbourne (accessed 14 January 2008) Governor of South Australia Pastor Sir Douglas Nicholls is sworn in as Governor of South Australia, in front of Premier Don Dunstan and other dignitaries 1977 Nicholls was appointed Governor of South Australia on 1 December 1976, on the nomination of Premier Don Dunstan. He was the first non-white person to serve as the governor of an Australian state, and is the only Aboriginal person to have held viceregal office. Because of his race, his nomination proved controversial and attracted more attention than most viceregal appointments. A poll by ABC's This Day Tonight found that 70 percent of respondents opposed Nicholls becoming governor. The Canberra Times expressed concern that members of his family might set up camp on the grounds of Government House. However, Adelaide's main daily newspaper The Advertiser was more positive, welcoming the news \\"without reservation\\". News of the appointment was leaked in May 1976, after which he agreed to appear on A Current Affair. Nicholls took exception to a question directed at his wife, calling the interviewer a racist and requiring him to leave his house. GTV-9 aired the footage without his permission, and subsequently apologised for doing so. Nicholls' predecessor as governor, nuclear physicist Mark Oliphant, confidentially wrote to the state government expressing concerns about the appointment. He said there were \\"grave dangers\\" involved, as \\"there is something inherent in the personality of the Aborigine which makes it difficult for him to adapt fully to the ways of the white man\\". On 25 January 1977, Nicholls suffered a stroke and was admitted to the cardiac ward at Royal Adelaide Hospital. He had a history of high blood pressure and had suffered a mild heart attack some years earlier. He was not discharged until three weeks later, with Lieutenant-Governor Walter Crocker serving as Administrator of the Government in his place. Nicholls attended only one further official engagement after his stroke, hosting Queen Elizabeth II at Government House on 20 March.The Canberra Times, 21 March 1977. She subsequently awarded him a second knighthood, Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO).The Canberra Times, 24 March 1977 Nicholls' retirement due to ill health was announced on 22 April, with effect from 30 April. He held office for only 150 days, making him the shortest-serving governor in South Australian history and the only governor to serve for less than a year. Family In December 1942 Nicholls married Gladys Nicholls, the widow of his brother Howard Nicholls (1905‚Äì1942); Howard (who had married Gladys in 1927) had died in April 1942 as a result of injuries sustained in a car accident. Gladys already had three children. Douglas Nicholls and Gladys were married for 39 years and raised their combined six children: two sons, Bevan and Ralph, and four daughters, Beryl, Nora, Lilian and Pamela. Lady Gladys Nicholls died in 1981. Nicholls' great-grandson Nathan Lovett-Murray also played Australian Rules Football, playing 145 games for Essendon.

After obtaining a double doctorate in mathematics (1927) and physics (1928) he was awarded the professorship in electronic physics at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure in Paris. As a member of a Resistance group during the Second World War he flew to the UK in a small plane as part of a dangerous mission, and was able to provide British intelligence with invaluable information. There he met up with Charles de Gaulle who named him Director of Research in the Forces navales fran√ßaises libres (the Navy of Free France). He became particularly interested in the detection of solar radio emissions by British Radar, which were causing military problems by jamming detection during periods of high emission, and was able to create a new radio navigational beam station. As research director, Rocard followed the French troops entering Germany. He succeeded in finding German specialists, e.g. in infrared and wireless Pathfinding and engaged them to serve in France. As for the group of nuclear physicists around Werner Heisenberg and Otto Hahn he did not succeed because Samuel Abraham Goudsmit arrived at Hechingen earlier. At Freiburg (then also French zone) Rocard protected the solar observatory and founded a French navy-owned ionospheric prediction service with Karl Rawer as scientific director. Returned to France after the war Rocard he took up his function as head of the physics department at the ENS. Whilst there he founded a radio observatory, having obtained two German \\"Wurzburg\\" Radar mirrors from the war. From 1947 he became scientific advisor to the French military on the subject of atomic energy, eventually taking over from Fr√©d√©ric Joliot-Curie after his dismissal. In 1951, he became scientific head of the programme that eventually led to the development of nuclear arms, and is often known as the father of the French A-Bomb and H-bomb. Later in his career, he studied subjects ranging from semiconductors to seismology. Eventually, his professional reputation became tarnished by his increased research in less conventional subjects such as biomagnetism, dowsing and UFOs.

He was born in Platteville, Wisconsin. In his varied career that spanned parts of six decades, he was a catcher, scout, major league umpire, minor and major league manager, and a boisterous baseball executive. Career He started in baseball at age nine, where he earned his nickname, \\"Pants\\", from base-running antics while wearing his father's workday overalls at games of the Dubuque (Iowa) Ninth Street Blues. Rowland served as a reserve catcher in the minor leagues. Never a great player, his love of the game drove him to find other occupations. Pants worked as a scout in the Illinois‚ÄìIndiana‚ÄìIowa League‚Äîthe so-called \\"Three-I\\" League‚Äîfor the Dubuque Miners. He worked his way into a managerial job, which proved to be his early calling. He then became the manager of the Three-I League Peoria Distillers in 1914. After the 1914 season, on December 17, Charles Comiskey, possibly as much for his legendary cheapness as for Rowland's talent, surprised White Sox fans and Chicago journalists when he called on Rowland to manage the White Sox. In his first year, Rowland and the White Sox finished 93-61, third in the American League; the next year, he finished second. In 1917, he led them to a 100-54 record and a World Series title when they beat the New York Giants. Disagreements with Comiskey got him fired the following season, which, given the state of affairs on the White Sox that led up to the Black Sox Scandal, probably saved his reputation. Rowland's all-time record was 339-247 in 591 games, a .591 winning percentage. Kid Gleason succeeded Rowland as the next manager of the White Sox. Rowland served as an American League umpire for five years (1923-1927), calling games with the likes of Babe Ruth. In 1938, as a scout for the Chicago Cubs, he was tasked with the unenviable job of obeying owner Phil Wrigley's orders to buy Dizzy Dean's contract at any cost. Rowland signed the right- handed pitcher for $185,000, one of the most expensive loss leader contracts in baseball history to that point. He returned to the front office during World War II. Rowland was the president of the Los Angeles Angels in 1944, where he earned The Sporting News title of No. 1 minor-league executive. It was as president of the Pacific Coast League where Rowland came to real prominence. \\"Pacific Coast baseball men are fed up with playing Santa Claus to the major leagues\\", said a TIME magazine article in December 1944, \\"...They do not like losing their Buck Newsomes, Joe Di Maggios and Ted Williamses. They think postwar air travel may well lure some big league club to pick up a Los Angeles franchise (the St. Louis Browns nibbled at it two years ago). Above all, they await the day when they can support a third big league of their own.\\" Rowland was the cheerleader for the PCL battle cry of independence. Air travel was still primitive, and the PCL teams had near major-league standing in the rapidly growing cities of the Western United States. He took on major league baseball commissioners Kenesaw Mountain Landis and Happy Chandler, trying to free the league from losing players to the American and National League for a minuscule $7,500 buyout of their contract. He went to the 1944 winter meetings of the NABPL (National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues) in Buffalo with a two-plank agenda. He proposed that minor leagues get $10,000 (a compromise figure) instead of $7,500 when one of their players is drafted by a major-league club. He also suggested that if & when the major leagues invade minor-league territory, the incumbent minor-league owners should get first crack at the major franchise. To his surprise, Rowland won support for both of his proposals. Landis opposed the PCL proposal and threatened to \\"outlaw\\" the league if it tried to move up in the world. The former judge, who had been brought in by the owners of baseball to clean up the mess from the 1919 Chicago scandal, held anyone connected with the organization at that time in particularly low esteem. Rowland's ties to the last season of pre-Black Sox ball tarred him with the same brush in the eyes of the man called the \\"baseball tyrant.\\" Rowland tried his hand at establishing the PCL as a major league after Chandler had succeeded Landis. Chandler and his fact-finding team, which included National League and American League presidents Ford Frick and Will Harridge, begged off again. At a meeting in September 1951 in San Francisco, California, Rowland led the charge of the club owners, who voted to serve an ultimatum on the majors. If they did not receive an exemption from the player draft, the PCL would declare itself the third major league, operating as an \\"outlaw\\" league. \\"We're all living or dying together in this deal, and if the majors won't go along, to hell with 'em\\", said C. L. \\"Brick\\" Laws, owner of the Oakland team in a TIME Magazine story on the PCL. Without the blessings of major league baseball, and with the implied threat they could come into the PCL at any time with one of their clubs, or an expansion club, Rowland was not able to secure the backing for any of his teams which would bring both facilities and teams up to major league standards. Rowland stepped down as PCL president at the close of the 1954 seasons after 11 seasons in office. He then returned to the Cubs as a vice president and was VP emeritus of the club at the time of his death at age 90. Death Rowland died in Chicago, the hometown of the team he managed. He is interred in Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Worth, Cook County, Illinois. Legacy Rowland was a 1964 inductee in the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame in 2005.

The genus was named for Marcus Terentius Varro, a Roman scholar and beekeeper. The condition of a honeybee colony being infested with Varroa mites is called varroosis (also, incorrectly, varroatosis). Varroa mites are recognised as the biggest pest to honeybees worldwide due to their ability to transmit diseases such as deformed wing virus (or dwv) to larval or pupating bees, resulting in death or severe deformity of the pupae. History and behavior Varroa mites feed off the fat body tissue of adult, pupal, and larval honey bees, and may carry viruses that are particularly damaging to the bees (e.g., deformed wings, and IAPV), and accordingly they have been implicated in colony collapse disorder. Research has indicated that alone, neither Varroa mites nor deformed wing virus are particularly deadly, yet together they can pose an incredible risk to colonies. Varroa mites were first discovered in Java about 1904, but are now present in all honey bee populations except Australia, Isle of Man and northern parts of Norway. They were discovered in the United States in 1987, in New Zealand in 2000, and in the United Kingdom in 1992 (Devon). Bee-breeding efforts to develop resistance against Varroa are ongoing. The USDA has developed a line of bees which uses Varroa-sensitive hygiene to remove reproductive mites. This line is now being distributed to beekeepers to be used as part of their integrated pest management programs. Species The genus Varroa contains these species: * Varroa destructor Anderson & Trueman, 2000 is a virulent parasite that infests its natural host, Apis cerana (Asian honey bees), on mainland Asia and also Apis mellifera (western honey bee) worldwide. * Varroa jacobsoni Oudemans, 1904 is a relatively benign parasite of Apis cerana. * Varroa rindereri de Guzman & Delfinado-Baker, 1996 * Varroa sinhai (Delfinado & Baker, 1974) * Varroa wongsirii (Lekprayoon & Tangkanasing, 1991) Resistance Some honey bees strains have been bred to be resistant to Varroa, through Varroa sensitive hygiene (VSH) behavior, enabling them to detect reproducing varroa mites and diseased pupae within capped cells, which are then uncapped and the pupae removed.

Published in 1825 as the second of his Tales of the Crusaders, the first being The Betrothed, it is set during the Third Crusade and centres on the relationship between Richard I of England and Saladin. Composition and sources At the beginning of April 1824, two months before he completed Redgauntlet, Scott envisaged that it would be followed by a four-volume publication containing two tales, at least one of which would be based on the Crusades. He began composition of the first story, The Betrothed, in June, but it made slow progress and came to a halt in the second volume at some point in the autumn after criticisms by James Ballantyne. Scott then changed course and began work on the companion novel The Talisman, and the first two chapters and part of the third were set in type by the end of the year. January 1825 was full of distractions, but a decision to resume The Betrothed was made in mid-February 1825 and it was essentially complete by mid-March. The way was then clear for the main composition of The Talisman which proceeded briskly. Its first volume was completed in April and its second at the very end of May or beginning of June.Walter Scott, The Talisman, ed. J. B. Ellis, with J. H. Alexander, P. D. Garside, and David Hewitt (Edinburgh, 2009), 280‚Äì88. Five clearly identifiable sources have been located for leading elements in The Talisman. The disguised Saladin's account of the origin of the Kurds is taken from the Bibliotheque orientale by Barth√©lemy d'Herbelot (1777‚Äí79). The character of Leopold of Austria and his tearing down of Richard's standard was prompted by the Anglo- Norman romance Richard Coer de Lyon. The attempted assassination of Richard is recounted in The History of the Crusades by Charles Mills (1820). Saladin's beheading of Amaury comes from The History of the Knights of Malta by the Abb√© de Vertot (1728). And the talisman itself is the Lee Penny used to cure people and animals up to Scott's time and preserved at the Lee near Lanark in the Scottish Borders. Scott's sceptical attitude to the Crusades, and his presentation of Richard and Saladin, follow three historians: David Hume, Edward Gibbon, and Mills.Ibid., 365‚Äì74. Editions The first edition of The Talisman was published as part of Tales of the Crusaders in Edinburgh by Archibald Constable and Co. on 22 June 1825. It was advertised for publication by Hurst, Robinson, and Co. in London on the same date, but apparently not issued until 11 July. The price was two guineas (¬£2 2s or ¬£2.10).William B. Todd and Ann Bowden, Sir Walter Scott: A bibliographical History 1796‚Äì1832 (New Castle, Delaware, 1998), 605. As with all of the Waverley novels until 1827 publication was anonymous. There is no conclusive evidence that Scott returned to the novel until the spring of 1831 when he revised the text and provided an introduction and notes for the 'Magnum' edition, in which it appeared as Volume 38 in July 1832.The Talisman, ed. Ellis, 306‚Äì11. The standard modern edition, by J. B. Ellis with J. H. Alexander, P. D. Garside, and David Hewitt, was published as Volume 18b of the Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels in 2009: this is based on the first edition with emendations mainly from the manuscript; the 'Magnum' material appears in Volume 25b (2012). Plot introduction The Talisman takes place at the end of the Third Crusade, mostly in the camp of the Crusaders in Palestine. Scheming and partisan politics, as well as the illness of King Richard the Lionheart, are placing the Crusade in danger. The main characters are the Scottish knight Kenneth, a fictional version of David of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon, who returned from the third Crusade in 1190; Richard the Lionheart; Saladin; and Edith Plantagenet, a relative of Richard. Other leading characters include the actual historical figure Sir Robert de Sabl√© The One To Ever Serve As The Eleventh One To Be Known As The Grandmaster of the Order of the Knights Templar/The Grandmaster of the Templar Order and as well as Conrad Aleramici da Montferrat/Conrad Aleramici di Montferrat/Conrad Aleramici de Montferrat, referred to here whilst as \\"Conrade of Montserrat\\", due to an admitted misspelling on The Author Sir Walter Scott's respective part. Plot summary During a truce between the Christian armies taking part in the third Crusade, and the infidel forces under Sultan Saladin, Sir Kenneth, on his way to Syria, encountered a Saracen Emir, whom he unhorsed, and they then rode together, discoursing on love and necromancy, towards the cave of the hermit Theodoric of Engaddi. This hermit was in correspondence with the pope, and the knight was charged to communicate secret information. Having provided the travellers with refreshment, the anchorite, as soon as the Saracen slept, conducted his companion to a chapel, where he witnessed a procession, and was recognised by the Lady Edith, to whom he had devoted his heart and sword. He was then startled by the sudden appearance of the dwarfs, and, having reached his couch again, watched the hermit scourging himself until he fell asleep. Ruins of Ascalon, 1880s About the same time Richard Coeur de Lion had succumbed to an attack of fever, and as he lay in his gorgeous tent at Ascalon, Sir Kenneth arrived accompanied by a Moorish physician, who had cured his squire, and who offered to restore the king to health. After a long consultation, and eliciting from Sir Kenneth his visit to the chapel, the physician was admitted to the royal presence; and, having swallowed a draught which he prepared from a silken bag or talisman, Richard sank back on his cushions. While he slept Conrade of Montserrat secretly avowed to the wily Grand-master of the Templars his ambition to be King of Jerusalem; and, with the object of injuring Richard's reputation, incited Leopold of Austria to plant his banner by the side of that of England in the centre of the camp. When the king woke the fever had left him, and Conrade entered to announce what the archduke had done. Springing from his couch, Richard rushed to the spot and defiantly tore down and trampled on the Teuton pennon. Philip of France at length persuaded him to refer the matter to the council, and Sir Kenneth was charged to watch the English standard until daybreak, with a favourite hound as his only companion. Soon after midnight, however, the dwarf Necbatanus approached him with Lady Edith's ring, as a token that his attendance was required to decide a wager she had with the queen; and during his absence from his post the banner was carried off, and his dog severely wounded. Overcome with shame and grief, he was accosted by the physician, who dressed the animal's wound, and, having entrusted Sir Kenneth with Saladin's desire to marry the Lady Edith, proposed that he should seek the Saracen ruler's protection against the wrath of Richard. The valiant Scot, however, resolved to confront the king and reveal the Sultan's purpose; but it availed him not, and he was sentenced to death, in spite of the intercessions of the queen and his lady-love; when the hermit, and then the physician, arrived, and Richard having yielded to their entreaties, Sir Kenneth was simply forbidden to appear before him again. Having, by a bold speech, revived the drooping hopes of his brother Crusaders, and reproved the queen and his kinswoman for tampering with the Scot, Richard received him, disguised as a Nubian slave, as a present from Saladin, with whom he had been induced to spend several days. Shortly afterwards, as the king was reposing in his pavilion, the \\"slave\\" saved his life from the dagger of an assassin secretly employed by the grand-master, and intimated that he could discover the purloiner of the standard. A procession of the Christian armies and their leaders had already been arranged in token of amity to Richard; and as they marched past him, seated on horseback, with the slave holding the hound among his attendants, the dog suddenly sprang at the Marquis Conrade, who was thus convicted of having injured the animal, and betrayed his guilt by exclaiming, \\"I never touched the banner.\\" Not being permitted to fight the Teuton himself, the king undertook to provide a champion, and Saladin to make all needful preparations for the combat. Accompanied by Queen Berengaria and Lady Edith, Richard was met by the Saracen with a brilliant retinue, and discovered, in the person of his entertainer, the physician who had cured his fever, and saved Sir Kenneth, whom he found prepared to do battle for him on the morrow, with the hermit as his confessor. The encounter took place soon after sunrise, in the presence of the assembled hosts, and Conrade, who was wounded and unhorsed, was tended by the Sultan in the grand- master's tent, while the victorious knight was unarmed by the royal ladies, and made known by Richard as the Prince Royal of Scotland. At noon the Sultan welcomed his guests to a banquet, but, as the grand-master was raising a goblet to his lips, Necbatanus uttered the words accipe hoc, and Saladin decapitated the templar with his sabre; on which the dwarf explained that, hidden behind a curtain, he had seen him stab his accomplice the Marquis of Montserrat, obviously to prevent him from revealing their infamous plots, while he answered his appeal for mercy in the words he had repeated. The next day the young prince was married to Lady Edith, and presented by the Sultan with his talisman, the Crusade was abandoned, and Richard, on his way homewards, was imprisoned by the Austrians in the Tyrol.

Ch. 2: Kenneth and Sheerkohf are contrasted as they arrive at the oasis known as the Diamond of the Desert. They express their differing cultural views of women. Ch. 3: As they continue to debate, Sheerkohf tells of his descent from the immortal Genii. They encounter the hermit Engaddi and are afforded shelter for the night in his cell. Ch. 4: Entering a richly decorated chapel, Kenneth receives the clandestine acknowledgment of one of the choristers, his lady love Edith. Ch. 5: After the service two dwarves, Nectanabus and Guenevra, enter the chapel: Engaddi dismisses them and departs with Kenneth. Ch. 6: The fevered King Richard and Sir Thomas de Vaux discuss the inactivity of the other Crusaders and their inability to find an effective leader. Ch. 7: Kenneth arrives and tries to persuade De Vaux (who is not well disposed to the Scots) that a Moorish physician sent by Saladin, Adouban el Hakim [Saladin again in disguise], should be admitted to Richard. Ch. 8: Richard tells De Vaux that he will see El Hakim. De Vaux and the Archbishop of Tyre discuss the physician and receive a demonstration of his skill. The Archbishop is alarmed to learn that Kenneth has returned. Ch. 9: Kenneth tells Richard that he sought Engaddi, at the behest of the Crusading council, to act as a vehicle for securing a lasting peace. Giles Amaury, Grand Master of the Templars, and Conrade of Montserrat urge Richard not to trust El Hakim, but he drinks the cup of water prepared by the physician by dipping a talisman in it. Ch. 10: Amaury and Conrade consider that their ambitions will be best served by a Crusader withdrawal, to which Richard is opposed. Amaury suggests he be assassinated, but they agree that Conrade should first attempt to stir up dissent between Austria and England. Ch. 11: Conrade arouses Leopold of Austria, who plants his banner alongside Richard's. Richard fells the Austrian flag and the Earl Wallenrode, and entrusts the care of his own standard to Kenneth. Ch. 12: Nectanabus brings a ring as a token of summons from Edith and persuades Kenneth to leave the banner unattended. Ch. 13: Kenneth overhears the royal ladies discussing him in their tent: it becomes clear that he has been enticed to leave the standard as a result of a wager by the Queen, and when he is revealed Edith urges him to return to his watch. He finds Richard's flag gone and his own dog Roswal injured. Volume Four Ch. 1 (14): El Hakim sets about tending Roswal and tells Kenneth that Tyre is to suggest to Richard a plan including the marriage of Saladin and Edith as part of a peace treaty. Ch. 2 (15): Kenneth accepts the royal sentence of death for deserting the banner. Ch. 3 (16): At Edith's urging, Queen Berengaria agrees to intercede with her husband for Kenneth's life. Ch. 4 (17): Berengaria and Edith, supported by Engaddi, obtain a temporary stay of execution for Kenneth. Ch. 5 (18): El Hakim obtains a pardon for Kenneth, who will become the physician's slave. Engaddi unveils an agreement which will deal with Leopold without involving violence and tells Richard his own sinful history. Ch. 6 (19): Tyre presents the marriage plan to Richard, who is not unreceptive but decides to make one attempt to rally his allies. This is successful. Amaury proposes to Conrade that they employ a Charegite (belonging to a fanatical Islamic sect) to eliminate Richard. Ch. 7 (20): The royal ladies decide to tell Richard the truth about Kenneth's desertion of the banner, and he pardons the Queen for her irresponsible behaviour. Edith complains to Richard about Kenneth's bondage. A mute Nubian slave, Zohauk [Kenneth in disguise], arrives with a letter from Saladin presenting him as a gift to Richard. He is followed by a dancing dervise [the Charegite]. Ch. 8 (21): Zohauk saves Richard from assassination by the dervise. He undertakes (in writing) to reveal the identity of the banner thief, and indicates that he has a message to deliver to Edith from Saladin. Ch. 9 (22): [The narrative retrogrades to follow Ch. 18] El Hakim and his slave Kenneth out-gallop a party of Templars. Ch. 10 (23): El Hakim reveals himself as the Emir of the opening chapters and arranges that Kenneth, disguised as Zohauk, will convey Saladin's message to Edith. Ch. 11 (24): Roswal attacks Conrade, identifying him as the banner thief, and arrangements are made for a duel between him and a royal champion. Ch. 12 (25): Richard, aware that Zohauk is Kenneth, hints that he may become his champion against Conrade and sends him, escorted by Sir Henry Neville, with Saladin's letter to Edith. Although she recognises him, he persists in his dumbness as agreed with Richard, and she spurns both him and the letter. Ch. 13 (26): Blondel sings the lay of 'The Bloody Vest' at Richard's request, and Edith tells the King of her intention to reject Saladin's approach for her hand. Ch. 14 (27): Richard and his followers arrive at the Diamond of the Desert where the duel is to take place. Saladin demonstrates his skill with a scimitar before revealing that he was El Hakim. De Vaux indicates to the King that Kenneth is ready to act as champion, and Edith that she has no particular interest in him. Ch. 15 (28): Preparations are made for the combat, and Amaury tries to stiffen Conrade's resolve. Kenneth defeats him and Richard announces he has discovered the Scot to be the Earl of Huntingdon. Amuray kills Conrade to prevent him from revealing his own treachery, leading Saladin to kill him in turn. Saladin's sense of his responsibility as a ruler leads him to decline Richard's impetuous offer of a combat. Huntingdon and Edith marry, Saladin sending them the talisman as a gift. Major themes David Earl of Huntingdon, frontispiece to 1863 edition by A & C Black The piece features many schemes from within the alliance against Richard the Lionheart's plans to complete the Crusade. These involve historical figures such as the Master of the Knights Templar and Conrad of Montserrat (the historical Conrad of Montferrat: Scott mistook the F for a long S in his researches). After several betrayals and a nearly fatal mistake by Kenneth, his redemption, justice for the schemers, and the peace treaty follow. An interesting feature is the character of Saladin‚Äîportrayed as virtuous and moral, in contrast to some of the despicable European nobles in the story. This is a feature of Romanticism, but perhaps also a reflection of a rising European interest in the Orient. Departures from historical fact Sir Kenneth is eventually revealed to be David of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon in disguise, and marries the Lady Edith. However, David's real wife (married in 1190) was Maud of Chester, who goes unmentioned; Edith Plantagenet is a fictional character. David was also in his late forties at the time of the Third Crusade, while Sir Kenneth appears to be considerably younger. Reception Only a handful of reviewers dissented from the overwhelmingly enthusiastic reception of The Talisman.For a full list of contemporaneous British reviews of \\"Tales of the Crusaders\\" see William S. Ward, Literary Reviews in British Periodicals, 1821‚Äí1826: A Bibliography (New York and London, 1977), 179. For an earlier annotated list see James Clarkson Corson, A Bibliography of Sir Walter Scott (Edinburgh and London, 1943), 262‚Äí64. It was generally ranked among the best of the Waverley novels, with admiration of its dazzling richness and high colouring. The plot was skilfully conducted, and the characters well discriminated and interesting, with Richard and Saladin outstandingly complex, and Edith and De Vaux both impressive. The small number of objectors tended to find the work extravagant and theatrical in a bad sense. Film and television The movie King Richard and the Crusaders (1954) was based on The Talisman. The Italian silent film Il talismano (1911) and King Richard the Lion-Hearted (1923) were also based on the novel. The Egyptian epic film El Naser Salah-Ad Din (Saladin Victorious, 1963) takes much of its inspiration from this novel. In 1980 a British miniseries was also made of The Talisman. In 1992 and 1993, Russian director Yevgeni Gerasimov adapted The Betrothed and The Talisman under the titles Richard L'vinoe Serdtse and Ritsar' Kennet. The 2005 epic film Kingdom of Heaven, directed by Sir Ridley Scott and starring Orlando Bloom, Liam Neeson and Edward Norton, while set in an earlier period, took part of its plot from The Talisman. Major elements include: the figure of Saladin as a noble ruler, a young European nobleman coming alone to the Crusades and encountering and fighting a Saracen warrior who is later revealed to be of higher birth than the viewer/reader is led to believe, his becoming a good friend of the latter, and finally a forbidden romance between the young nobleman and a young woman of royal heritage. The 2007 Swedish epic Film/Series 'Arn - Knight Templar' (based on the books by Jan Guillou) also leans heavily upon the similar themes as the above-mentioned 'Kingdom of Heaven'.

The plot is not related to that of Walter Scott's 1825 novel of the same name, although there is one oblique reference to \\"a Sir Walter Scott novel.\\" The Talisman was nominated for both the Locus and World Fantasy Awards in 1985. King and Straub followed up with a sequel, Black House (2001), that picks up with a now-adult Jack as a retired Los Angeles homicide detective trying to solve a series of murders in the small town of French Landing, Wisconsin. Plot summary Jack Sawyer, twelve years old, sets out from Arcadia Beach, New Hampshire in a bid to save his mother, who is dying from cancer, by finding a crystal called \\"the Talisman.\\" Jack's journey takes him simultaneously through the American heartland and \\"the Territories,\\" a strange fantasy land which is set in a universe parallel to that of Jack's United States. Individuals in the Territories have \\"twinners,\\" or parallel individuals, in our world. Twinners' births, deaths, and (it is intimated) other major life events are usually paralleled. Twinners can also \\"flip\\" or migrate to the other world, but only share the body of their alternate universe's analogue. When flipped, the Twinner, or the actual person, will automatically start speaking and thinking the language of where they are flipping into subconsciously. In rare instances (such as Jack's), a person may die in one world but not the other, making the survivor \\"single-natured\\" with the ability to switch back and forth, body and mind, between the two worlds. Jack is taught how to flip by a mysterious figure known as Speedy Parker, who is the twinner of a gunslinger named Parkus in the Territories. In the Territories, the beloved Queen Laura DeLoessian, the twinner of Jack's mother (a movie actress known as the \\"Queen of the B Movies\\") is dying as well. Various people help or hinder Jack in his quest. Of particular importance are the werewolves, known simply as Wolfs, who inhabit the Territories. These are not the savage killers of tradition: they serve as royal herdsmen or bodyguards, and can sometimes under stress voluntarily change to wolf form, in addition to facing an involuntary transformation that lasts about three days at the time of the full moon. A sixteen-year-old Wolf, simply named Wolf, is pulled into America by Jack Sawyer and adopts Jack as his pack, serving as his companion. Wolf is extremely likeable, kind, loyal and friendly, much like a dog, though his wolf nature shows through on occasion. On the other hand, some Wolfs have joined the malevolent faction which is trying to stop Jack. As the story goes back and forth between the Territories and the familiar United States, or \\"American Territories\\" as Jack comes to call them, Jack escapes from one life-threatening situation after another. Accompanied by Wolf and later by his childhood friend Richard, Jack must retrieve the Talisman before it falls into the hands of evil schemer Morgan Sloat, Richard's father, who, we later learn, was Jack's father's business partner before arranging to have the latter murdered. He wants to seize their business from Jack's mother. Morgan Sloat's twinner, Morgan of Orris, also plans to seize the Territories in the event of Queen Laura's death.  Publication history  The idea of writing The Talisman first took form when Stephen King moved with his family to London in early 1977. It was there he met Peter and Susan Straub, and their children. The two writers became friends, both being fans of each other's work. King and his family left London three months later to return to the United States. Straub and King had talked multiple times before about collaborating to write a book, but nothing ever surfaced until years after King returned stateside, when the Straubs also moved to the United States. According to King, after Straub moved, \\"the talk got serious,\\" and they began collaborating. Their literary friendship continued after The Talisman was published; in 1999 they began working on the sequel, Black House (2001), which deals with Jack Sawyer as an adult. A third and final book in the Jack Sawyer series is planned.  Locations  = The Territories = When Jack \\"flips,\\" he finds himself in a parallel world, which is physically smaller than the world from which he comes. Throughout the course of the novel, Jack uses the size differential as a method to travel quickly across the country. The eastern region, corresponding to the Eastern Seaboard, is the most densely populated and is governed under a feudal system headed by the Queen. The central regions, roughly corresponding to the American plains, are a grain growing area known as \\"the Outposts.\\" Beyond them the western region of the Territories is a destroyed area known as \\"the Blasted Lands\\" (analogous to the American Southwest ‚Äì primarily New Mexico, where the atomic bomb was tested). It apparently was wrecked by radioactivity and has dangerous mutants and occasional fireballs. = Alhambra Hotel = Where Jack begins his quest and meets Speedy Parker. It is a decaying building on the New Hampshire coast, at the end of the novel deserted except for Jack's mother. Its parallel in the Territories is the summer palace of the dying queen. The Alhambra was also a notable location in King's novel The Tommyknockers. = Oatley Tap = A bar in the fictional western New York town of the same name. The owner, Smokey, holds Jack as a virtual slave. Jack despises him for this mistreatment. = Sunlight Gardener's School = When Jack and Wolf are accused of mischievous \\"hitchhiking\\" and \\"trouble-making\\" by a highway police officer, they are sent by the court to a camp/school for troubled youths run by evangelist Robert \\"Sunlight\\" Gardner/Osmond. It is located in eastern Indiana and parallels a terrible open pit mine in the Territories where slaves are used to gather radioactive ore for Morgan. Jack and Wolf are held as wards of the state in Sunlight Gardener's School for one month, escaping after Wolf transforms and brutally kills a number of students in the school. Sunlight Gardener escapes during the attack and Wolf is shot four times by Sonny Singer (a prefect at the school) and dies of his injuries. = Thayer School = A boarding school for wealthy boys in Springfield, Illinois. Jack meets up with his friend Richard here. The school is shifted into another plane by Morgan, where wolves and gargoyle-like creatures try to seize Jack. = Agincourt Hotel = In the ruined town of Point Venuti on the northern California coast. It is a mysterious abandoned black structure similar to the Alhambra. It holds the Talisman and has many different incarnations depending on the alternate universe. In The Territories it appears as a black castle. It is through this building's shifting forms as Jack nears the Talisman that the reader learns of a multitude of other worlds of which the Territories and America are only two. Reception Because Straub and King were both immensely successful and popular horror and suspense writers in their own rights, anticipation of this book was extremely strong. The publisher financed a USD$550,000 promotion budget and several articles ran which hailed the collaboration of the two writers and speculated what would be ‚Äúthe greatest horror novel ever written.‚Äù Actual popular and critical reception, however, were mixed and ran the spectrum from \\"worst\\" (People: \\"Worst of Pages\\" list) and \\"best\\" (Twilight Zone: Year's Best Novel). However, with the exception of People, no critics recommended against it. According to Publishers Weekly, the final sales figure for The Talisman in 1984 was 880,287 copies. The original hardbound edition spent 12 weeks as #1 on the New York Times Best Seller List with a total of 23 weeks in total on the list. Publishers Weekly listed it as #1 for 11 weeks, with a total of 26 weeks on the list. The subsequent Berkley paperback edition spent 2 weeks as #1 on the New York Times best paperback list with a total of 14 weeks on the list. Publishers Weekly listed it as #1 for 3 weeks, with 13 weeks in total on the list.  Connection to The Dark Tower  The book's sequel Black House presents a \\"soft\\" retcon that the Territories are a parallel to All-World. This is made most clear by King's introduction to The Little Sisters of Eluria where he states the pavilion where Jack Sawyer meets Sophie is the same one in The Little Sisters.

The metaphor is historical in its connotation but continues to be used in the literature on urban higher education and in common parlance.  Origin of the term  The gown and hood worn for bachelor's graduation at Cambridge During the Middle Ages, students admitted to European universities often held minor clerical status and donned garb similar to that worn by the clergy. These vestments evolved into the academic long black gown, worn along with hood and cap. The gown proved comfortable for studying in unheated and draughty buildings and thus became a tradition in the universities. The gown also served as a social symbol, as it was impractical for physical manual work. The hood was often adorned with the colours of the colleges and designated the young scholar's university affiliation. Thus by their distinctive clothing, the students were set apart and distinguished from the citizens of the town; hence the phrase \\"town and gown\\".  Town and gown in the Middle Ages  = The university as sanctuary = The idea of a school of higher learning as a distinct and autonomous institution within an urban setting dates back to the Academy founded by Plato c. 387 BC. The Academy was established as a sacred sanctuary for learning outside the city walls of Athens. Successors of the Academy existed over nine centuries until the final iteration was closed, along with other pagan schools, by Emperor Justinian in 529 AD. In the 12th century, when the early medieval universities came into existence ‚Äì first in Italy and then across Europe ‚Äì they were founded without physical campuses. The masters simply rented lecture halls in the host cities. Early on, there were few identifiable campus buildings (other than the residential colleges that were established at some universities). Most students took lodging in the university towns. The scholars often congregated in identifiable areas of cities, most famously the Left Bank (Rive gauche) of the Seine in Paris ‚Äì what became known as the Quartier Latin (\\"The Latin Quarter\\", due to the use of spoken Latin). Thus, the medieval institutions were more integrated into the cities than in the case of the Academy. It is no accident that most medieval universities were founded within cities. The schools' existence required a permanent population and an infrastructure that included a vibrant marketplace and system of governance, but their dependence on the host towns was limited. In most instances, the endowment of the medieval universities was drawn largely, if not entirely, from the revenues of the Catholic Church. Consequently, the universities were largely independent of municipal revenues and, to a great extent, of civil authority. The medieval studium remained a sanctuary in its status as beneficiary of the Catholic Church and in the scholars' exemption from civil law. Such special jurisdictions were by no means uncommon in the Middle Ages. The applicable law varied greatly by person, organisation and area: the towns themselves had legal systems totally different from the surrounding countryside, and even inside the town, every guild usually had its own special privileges and rights. The independent jurisdiction of the universities essentially was part of this system. = Anatomy of an adversarial relationship = The initial relationship between the medieval universities and the host town was adversarial for various reasons, and over time, the universities' growing autonomy and independence from local control led to increasing tensions with host towns. Also, the steady encroachment of universities upon neighbouring areas created a point of contention between town and gown (continuing to the present). The medieval universities formed as guilds of masters (teachers) and/or students on the model established by the crafts guilds. Once the scholars were able to receive a charter, they would begin negotiations with municipal authorities to secure fair rents for lecture halls and other concessions. Because they had no investment in a physical campus, they could threaten to migrate to another town if their demands were not met. This was not an empty threat. The scholars at the University of Lisbon in Portugal migrated to Coimbra, and then later back to Lisbon in the 14th century. Scholars would also go on strike, leave the host city, and not return for years. This happened at the University of Paris after a riot in 1229 (started by the students). The university did not return to Paris for two years. Many university students were foreigners with exotic manners and dress who spoke and wrote Latin, the lingua franca of medieval higher education in Western Europe. Students often could not speak the local dialect, and most uneducated townspeople spoke no Latin. The language barrier and the cultural differences did nothing to improve relations between scholars and townspeople. The tenor of town‚Äìgown relations became a matter of arrogance on the one hand and resentment on the other. Students in the medieval universities enjoyed certain exemptions from the jurisdiction of the ordinary civil courts. These privileges were normally safeguarded by a conservator Apostolic, usually a bishop or archbishop appointed by the pope. By the Papal bull Parens scientiarum (\\"Father of the Sciences\\"In the original, unrestricted sense of \\"science\\" (from the Latin scientia: \\"knowledge\\") as \\"knowledge\\" or \\"disciplines of study\\", used in this instance of the sciences of theology, philosophy, law, and medicine, inclusive of the narrower sense the word would take during the Scientific Revolution, denoting the disciplines that were then called by the name \\"natural philosophy\\") (1231), the charter of the University of Paris, Pope Gregory IX authorised the masters, in the event of an outrage committed by anyone upon a scholar and not redressed within fifteen days, to suspend their lectures. This right of cessation of lectures was frequently made use of in conflicts between town and gown. On various occasions, the popes themselves intervened to protect the scholars against encroachments by the local civil authorities. Pope Nicholas IV in 1288 threatened to disrupt the studium at Padua unless the municipal authorities repealed within fifteen days ordinances they had framed against scholars. It became quite common for the university to lay its grievances against the city fathers before the Holy See, and its appeal was usually successful. (See The Catholic Encyclopedia for a more in-depth discussion.) Thus, medieval students were under the legal protection of the clergy, who protected them from physical harm. They could be tried for crimes only in a church court under Canon law. The protection from civil law gave students free rein in the urban environs to break secular laws with near impunity. This often led to abuses and outright criminal behaviour among students who realised they enjoyed immunity from civil authorities. The anomalous jurisdictional situation only exacerbated tensions between town and gown.Robert F. Seybolt, 1921, 1927, 1933. = Town versus gown = Conflict was inevitable in the medieval university towns, where two separately governed bodies with different priorities and loyalties shared the same restricted space. Moreover, violence was commonplace in medieval life, not only between scholars and townsmen, but also among ordinary citizens, as well as between scholars from different regions of Europe who attended the universities. Violent confrontations between town and gown erupted on a recurring basis. One of the most famous was the Battle of St. Scholastica Day, which occurred on 10 February 1355, at the University of Oxford. An argument in a tavern ‚Äì a familiar scenario ‚Äì escalated into a protracted two-day battle in which local citizens armed with bows attacked the academic village, killing and maiming scores of scholars. The rioters were severely punished, and thenceforth, the Mayor and Bailiffs had to attend a Mass for the souls of the dead every St. Scholastica's Day thereafter and to swear an annual oath to observe the university's privileges. For 500 years, Oxford observed a day of mourning for that tragedy. The University of Cambridge was originally set up after a fight between the townspeople of Oxford and scholars from the University of Oxford forced many scholars to flee to a new location in 1209. Later, the tension between the scholars at Cambridge and the townspeople forced the king to grant special privileges and protection to Cambridge University, which helped enormously in the survival and future success of the university. By the mid-15th century, kings were putting an end to student power within the universities. They ordered papal legates to reform the universities and restricted student boycotts and strikes. From then on, whether under king or revolutionary government, dictator or Parliament, European universities would customarily be ruled by the central authority ‚Äì although the degree of control varied widely over time and place. Following the upheavals of the High Middle Ages, relations between the European universities and the host towns evolved toward a pattern of mutual support. Cities, on some occasions, took over payment of salaries and provided loans, while regulating the book trade, lodgings, and the various other services students required. Eventually, cities began to take pride in their universities rather than look upon them as adversaries.  Town-and-gown relations in the post-medieval and modern eras  Over the centuries, the relationship between town and gown has remained ambivalent. There have been points where a university in crisis has been rescued by the urban dynamics surrounding it, while at other times, urban developments have threatened to undermine the stability of the university. Conversely, there have been occasions where the university provided a focus and coherence for the cultural life of the city; though at other times, it has withdrawn into itself and undermined urban culture.Thomas Bender (editor). The University and the City: From Medieval Origins to the Present. Oxford University Press, 1988. Despite generally improved relations between town and gown in the post- medieval era, disputes and conflicts were a recurring phenomenon. A brief chronicle of incidents involving Yale College students and residents of New Haven, Connecticut, illustrates the continuing strain upon town‚Äìgown relations. The nature of these disputes ranged from theological to martial. Founded in 1701, Yale moved to New Haven in 1716. In 1753, President Thomas Clap began holding separate Sunday worship services for students in the college instead of at First Church, because he felt that the minister, Joseph Noyes, was theologically suspect. (Yale was founded by Congregational ministers but currently has no religious affiliation.) This move alienated the Connecticut clergy and marked the beginning of the Yale undergraduates' ambivalent relationship with the town of New Haven. Over the course of a century, New Haven witnessed a series of violent confrontations between students and \\"townies\\" that recall the confrontations in the medieval university towns. In 1806, a full-scale riot ‚Äì the first of many ‚Äì fought with fists, clubs, and knives, broke out between off-duty sailors and Yale students. In 1841, a clash with city firefighters took place. After Yale students attacked the firehouse and destroyed equipment, a town mob threatened to burn the college. Military companies had to be called in to keep the peace. Then in 1854, bricks and bullets flew after a confrontation between students and townspeople at a New Haven theatre. When the leader of the town group was stabbed, students retreated to the college. The locals actually brought in two militia cannons and aimed them at the college but were stopped by constables before they could fire them. Things were relatively quiet until 1919, when returning local servicemen, angry over perceived insults from Yale students, attacked the Old Campus. Finding the gates locked, they broke hundreds of windows and moved on to theatres and restaurants in the town, assaulting any students they could find. In 1959, a student snowball fight on city streets got out of hand and resulted in arrests by New Haven police. Students then pelted police officers with snowballs during the St. Patrick's Day parade. The so-called \\"snowball riot\\" attracted national media attention ‚Äì a preview of the tumultuous 1960s.Yale Alumni Magazine, March 2001. A wave of student unrest took place in North America and Europe during the 1960s, from Paris to Mexico City to California. The Free Speech Movement, centred at the University of California, Berkeley, has often been cited as the starting point of the unrest. The US student movement was ostensibly about demands for more freedom and a share in decision making on campus, but it was stoked by two broader issues ‚Äì civil rights for African Americans and protest of the Vietnam War. The most violent incidents occurred when National Guard troops fired upon and killed four students at Kent State University in Ohio and when police fired on dormitories at Jackson State University in Mississippi in spring, 1970, killing two bystanders (See links below). The town-and-gown divide is visible in numerous older universities globally. In the university town of Uppsala in Sweden, clergy, royalty and academia historically reside on the western shore of the river Fyris, somewhat separated from the rest of the city, and the ensemble of cathedral (consecrated 1435), castle and university (founded in 1477) has remained mostly undisturbed until today. Since the Middle Ages, commercial activity has been geographically centred on the eastern side of the river. Many of the medieval traditions have carried into the modern era, and universities retain certain historical privileges. Two examples are illustrative: 1) Students in some universities were compelled to wear gowns up to the 1960s to make them identifiable to the university authorities. 2) Under the Russian tsars, police were forbidden to enter the universities, a tradition that was respected during the Russian repression of Prague in the summer of 1968. Post-1960s: changing climate, changing issues Cities and their universities evolved from the integrated residential patterns of the High Middle Ages to a more distinct partition. As colleges acquired physical facilities, visible campuses formed with a proximate student population. Residential colleges became a fixture in European universities, while American colleges (often located in small towns) sequestered students in dormitories under close supervision. The lines that defined the two communities were clearly drawn, but this distinction was becoming blurred by the 1970s. The doctrine of in loco parentis had developed both as a legal concept and as a custom in the United States. The Latin phrase meaning \\"in place of a parent\\" held schools to a high standard of care for the welfare of students. However, this legal concept was eroded by the Bradshaw v Rawling'‚ÄòBradshaw v. Rawlings,'‚Äô United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, 1979. and by subsequent court rulings. The pendulum would swing back toward the medieval model, where students could enjoy significant autonomy in their choice of residence and habits.College Not Expected to Assume Parental Role Toward Students , In Brief, 1998. The trend of American students living off campus had emerged during the post-World War II era. The Servicemen's Readjustment Act legislation, popularly known as the \\"G.I. Bill\\", provided large numbers of returning veterans with the financial aid to pursue college degrees. Many veterans were older than traditional students or had families to support; this further spurred the growth of off-campus housing. It was estimated that by century's end, as many as 85% of American college students lived off campus (Carnegie Commission). This residential trend ‚Äì and other factors ‚Äì would mitigate the division between town and gown (but not necessarily the tensions). Universities increasingly integrated into cities as cities absorbed and accommodated universities. Commuter colleges, such as San Francisco State University, now enroll large numbers of students who live at a distance, commute to campus for classes, and then leave at the end of each school day. Concurrently, American universities have opened branch campuses and even offer classes in storefront venues. However, the recent integration of campus and community has not been without problems. For one thing, an urban university can generate major traffic and exacerbate parking problems in adjacent neighbourhoods. The quality of neighbourhoods near a university may deteriorate. Certain industries requiring highly educated workers, such as biotechnology, may be drawn to college communities. The growth of these knowledge economies, and additional upwardly mobile residents, may increase the competition for community space or drive up land costs. The expansion of campuses has led to the razing of some neighbourhoods and the displacement of large numbers of city residents. These factors create continuing tensions between town and gown, but in some scenarios, the university and the local community work together in revitalisation projects. Local residents and members of the university community may clash over other political, economic, and demographic issues. Some localities in the Northeastern United States have tried to block students from registering to vote in elections as local residents, instead demanding that they vote by absentee ballot at their parents' residence. (Manahan, 1980) Many universities in college towns are located on unincorporated land, which prevents students living in on-campus housing from voting in town elections. As urban universities increase in size and complexity, they hire a large staff of city residents. Labor unions have formed on campuses and bargain collectively for contracts. In 1971, a 53-day strike among Yale employees was the longest in the school's history. Union leaders stated that they considered Yale's social commitment to New Haven to be a key issue in the job action. University workers in New Haven would strike again and again in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.Yale Alumni Magazine, March 2001. Municipalities and universities continue to negotiate police jurisdiction on and near campuses. Today, many universities and colleges maintain their own police forces. In cities where a significant number of students live off campus, university police may be allowed to patrol these neighbourhoods to provide an extra measure of security. Meanwhile, civil libertarians argue that school officials should only call on local law enforcement to intervene when it is necessary to protect the safety of people on campus. Such intrusion is legally mandated in some jurisdictions when school officials have reasonable suspicion to believe that a student is breaking the law. Generally, local police are reluctant to go on campus if a college maintains its own security force (the Kent State and Jackson State killings are examples of intervention turning into tragedy). Raucous off- campus parties and the excessive noise and public drunkenness associated with them can also create town‚Äìgown animosity. The University of Colorado (Boulder, Colorado, USA) and Queen's University (Kingston, Canada) provide examples where street parties have escalated into riots. In 1995, at Wilfrid Laurier University in sedate Waterloo, Ontario, the \\"Ezra Street riot\\" occurred when 1500 revellers showed up at an end-of-the-year student party on Ezra Street. The party goers drank copious amounts of beer, threw bottles, and carried on in ways that resulted in 42 arrests and two serious injuries ‚Äì one when a woman was hit by a chunk of concrete thrown at the party, the other when a man was run over by a jeep. The end result was the university's adoption of a new \\"Code of Conduct\\" to govern student behaviour. In the 1970s and 1980s, attention was often focused on off-campus fraternities and sororities, whose sometimes rowdy events were lampooned in the 1978 film Animal House. Ironically, the institution of \\"social responsibility\\" measures to restrict events at fraternity houses has exacerbated tensions, as events moved to non- Greek block and house parties farther off campus. The push of social events off campus also increases the incidents of drunk driving, as students who wish to party are pushed outside of campus. In the US, a rash of disputes between public universities and host cities have developed in regard to the cost and benefits of the town‚Äìgown connection. Universities boast that their existence is the backbone of the town economy, while the towns counter with claims that the institution is \\"robbing\\" them of tax revenue; but as universities expand their campuses, more land property is removed from local tax rolls. Attempts are being pursued to redefine the basic financial terms and conditions upon which the relationship is based. As tax-exempt institutions, universities have had no legal obligation to contribute to the coffers of city government, but some do make payments in lieu of taxes based on negotiated agreements (as is the case in Boston).Karen Baker-Minkel, Jason Moody and Walter Kieser, \\"Town and Gown,\\" Economic Development Journal, Fall, 2004, pp. 7‚Äì9. Despite the rise in legal battles, universities and host towns have an incentive to co-operate, as the schools require city services and need city approval for long-range plans while the university towns need remuneration for public services provided. The \\"engaged university\\" is a recent term describing community partnerships and joint planning with city officials. Additionally, in some college towns, local culture is constructed by students and non-students alike, such as Athens, Georgia, which was ranked as the No. 1 college music town by Rolling Stone Magazine. In Athens, local culture that students identify with and take part in is often supported or created by non-students, in this case, musicians. While some degree of misunderstanding or rivalry might persist between \\"students\\" and \\"townies\\", coexistence and co-operation take place as well. Town‚Äìgown parameters may become increasingly difficult to define in the near future. Geography is less salient as a factor in urban higher education in the Information Age. Some private institutions, such as the University of Phoenix, rely less on geographical presence, enrolling students in a broad range of online degree programs. Other courses may comprise part-time or night classes for working professionals or intensive training taking place over a group of weekends or months. Many of these non- traditional students live and work full-time in the surrounding community. Traditional brick-and-mortar universities have countered with their own distance education courses via television and the Internet. Traditional universities also recruit locally for special programs, such as executive MBA degrees. The 12th century witnessed the birth of the first predecessors of the modern university; many educational futurists argue that the division between town and gown is rapidly fading and that the 21st century is the cusp of another revolutionary educational paradigm. According to these forecasts, the 21st-century college student may well be someone sitting at his or her personal computer miles from a college campus. Graduation may or may not include the traditional commencement ceremony. These reformers argue that for graduating students, the gown may be left hanging in the closet, with the graduate interacting more seamlessly within the global community.David Kirp. Shakespeare, Einstein, and the Bottom Line: The Marketing of Higher Education. Harvard University Press, 2003. However, such views are currently dismissed to a greater or lesser extent by leading universities, who admit the importance of technology and the diminution in town/gown rivalries but stress the continuing value of traditional learning and teaching methods.  Post-2000s: University Agglomeration and Knowledge Spillovers  Post-2000s, the face of town and gown relations has changed as the effects of agglomeration have increasingly been studied and understood in urban economics. University agglomeration, or clustering, occurs when a large amount of institutions of higher education all locate in the same geographical area. This shift has been an important one for town and gown relations, as increasingly relationships between universities and their surrounding communities is no longer bilateral but multilateral; no longer town and gown but town and gowns. Prominent examples of such agglomeration in the United States include the large numbers of colleges and universities located in the San Francisco Bay Area, contributing to the development of Silicon Valley, as well as the well-known Research Triangle located in North Carolina. Colleges and universities in the Bay Area with approximate locations. These agglomerations in metropolitan areas leads to what experts call knowledge spillovers, which is simply defined as the exchange of ideas among individuals. The physical proximity of entities allows for the rapid exchange of knowledge, ideas, expertise, and people. A common example of knowledge spillovers is a business park, where many businesses that often have no relation locate in the same complex and benefit simply from each other's presence. This is extremely similar to university agglomerations ‚Äì colleges and universities that have no special relationship often benefit simply from having other institutions of higher education near them for easy exchange of ideas, resources, and opportunities between faculty and students. An extreme example of this is the Claremont Colleges, located in Claremont, California. At the Claremont Colleges, five undergraduate liberal arts colleges and two graduate institutions are all located right across the street from one another, thus enabling students from each college to interact with students from the other colleges socially and in clubs. Further, as the Claremont Colleges do cooperate with one another, students are able to cross-register in classes at the other colleges, eat in the other college's dining halls, and further benefit from enhanced shared resources like the Honnold-Mudd Library, Student Health Services, and Campus Safety. However, colleges and universities located near one another bears fruit not only for the colleges and universities themselves but also for the areas they are located in. Experts at the University of California, Merced and National Bureau of Economic Research have been able to quantify spillover effects from universities on their communities, finding that a \\"a 10% increase in higher education spending increases local non-education sector labor income by about 0.8%\\". Further, researchers at UC Berkeley also found that an increase in university researchers in a local labor market is correlated with an increase in the amount of patents granted in that area. In this way, many areas benefit from a large number of institutions of higher education within their borders. These benefits, however, often came come with their costs as a high number of students, faculty, and resources needed to support universities can put a strain on local governments. In the aforementioned city of Claremont, California, local officials have tried to raise sales taxes to level the tax burden in order to fund essential city services, as many college students do not pay taxes to the city but do shop in it.

Amravati is the administrative headquarters of the district. The district is situated between 20¬∞32' and 21¬∞46' north latitudes and 76¬∞37' and 78¬∞27' east longitudes. The district occupies an area of 12,235 km¬≤. The district is bounded by Betul District of Madhya Pradesh state to the north, and by the Maharashtra districts of Nagpur to the northeast, Chindwara district of Madhya Pradesh to the northeast Wardha to the east, Yavatmal to the south, Washim to the southwest, and Akola and Buldhana districts to the west.It is situated 150 km from district headquarter Betul MP. History In 1853, the present-day territory of Amravati district as a part of Berar Province was assigned to the British East India Company, following a treaty with the Nizam of Hyderabad. After the Company took over the administration of the province, it was divided into two districts. The present-day territory of the district became part of North Berar district, with headquarters at Buldhana. Later, the province was reconstituted and the territory of the present district became part of East Berar district, with headquarters at Amravati. In 1864, Yavatmal District (initially known as Southeast Berar district and later Wun district) was separated. In 1867, Ellichpur District was separated but in August, 1905, when the whole province was reorganized into six districts, it was again merged into the district. In 1903, it became part of the newly constituted province of Central Provinces and Berar. In 1956, Amravati district became part of Bombay State and after its bifurcation in 1960, it became part of Maharashtra state. Geography The climate is tropical and most people wear cotton clothes. In summer temperatures can go up to higher than . Economy In 2006 the Ministry of Panchayati Raj named Amravati one of the country's 250 most backward districts (out of a total of 640). It is one of the twelve districts in Maharashtra currently receiving funds from the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme (BRGF). Agriculture Amravati is the main growing region for the cotton and 'Tur' in Chandur Railway , Dhamangaon, Teosa, Nandgaon Khandeshwar, Achalpur particularly. Ellachipur Sanman Chili pepper. Anjangaon Surji and Achalpur are known for growing betel leaves, piper longum, orange and banana. Morshi, Warud, Chandur Bazaar and Achalpur are known for growing Nagpuri oranges. Soyabean has become a popular Kharip crop. =Rivers= The Wardha River forms the eastern boundary of the district, and the eastern portion of the district lies within its watershed. The Purna River drains the southwestern portion of the district, while the northwest is drained by the Tapti River. Other important rivers are Shahanoor and Chandrabhaga.*Musali and Cherry are successfully introduced and cultivated now in Chikhaldara Hills. The Purna rises near Bhainsdehi in Betul district of Madhya Pradesh in the Satpudas. After flowing for about 50 km in a general southerly and south- easterly direction enters the district. It travels across the district in a south-westerly direction dividing it into two halves, first through the Achalpur taluka and then along the boundary between the Amravati and Daryapur talukas. Finally, it turns due westwards forming the boundary of the district and continues further to join the Tapti near Muktainagar in Jalgaon district. The only significant left bank tributary of the Purna is the Pedhi. The first of the principal right bank tributaries is the Arna. The next is a small river known as the Bodi. The next tributary, the Chandrabhaga is a very important one, flowing in a general south-westerly direction to join the Purna. The principal right bank affluent of the Chandrabhaga is the Bhuleshwari. The westernmost tributary of the Purna of some significance within the district is the Shahanur, with its tributary, the Bordi. The following are some of the other rivers in Amravati District, with their tributaries. * Burshi River * Surkhi River * Tigria River * Khandu River * Khapra River * Sangiya River * Gadaga River * Vaan River * Wardha River * Vidarbha River * Bor River * Pak Nala * Maru River * Narha River * Chargar River * Shahanoor River *Bembala Divisions The district consists of six sub-divisions, which are further divided into 14 talukas. Amravati sub-division is divided into three talukas: Amravati, Bhatukali and Nandgaon Khandeshwar. Daryapur sub-division is further divided into two talukas: Anjangaon and Daryapur. Achalpur sub-division also consists of two talukas: Achalpur and Chandur Bazar. Morshi sub-division has also two talukas: Morshi and Warud. Dharni sub-division is also divided into two talukas: Dharni and Chikhaldara. Finally, Chandur (Railway) sub-division is divided into three taulkas: Chandur (Railway), Tiosa and Dhamangaon. There are eight Vidhan Sabha constituencies in this district. Six of these, Badnera, Amravati, Teosa, Anjangaon-Daryapur (SC), Melghat (ST) and Achalpur, are part of Amravati Lok Sabha constituency. The other two constituencies, Dhamangaon Railway and Morshi, are part of Wardha Lok Sabha constituency. =Major towns= Major towns include Achalpur, Paratwada, Anjangaon,.

Whale reproduction follows a K-selection strategy, with few offspring, long gestation, long parental care, and a long period until sexual maturity. In ecology, r/K selection theory relates to the selection of combinations of traits in an organism that trade off between quantity and quality of offspring. The focus on either an increased quantity of offspring at the expense of individual parental investment of r-strategists, or on a reduced quantity of offspring with a corresponding increased parental investment of K-strategists, varies widely, seemingly to promote success in particular environments. The terminology of r/K-selection was coined by the ecologists Robert MacArthur and E. O. Wilson in 1967 based on their work on island biogeography; although the concept of the evolution of life history strategies has a longer historyFor example: (see e.g. plant strategies). The theory was popular in the 1970s and 1980s, when it was used as a heuristic device, but lost importance in the early 1990s, when it was criticized by several empirical studies. A life-history paradigm has replaced the r/K selection paradigm but continues to incorporate many of its important themes. Overview A litter of mice with their mother. The reproduction of mice follows an r-selection strategy, with many offspring, short gestation, less parental care, and a short time until sexual maturity. In r/K selection theory, selective pressures are hypothesised to drive evolution in one of two generalized directions: r- or K-selection. These terms, r and K, are drawn from standard ecological algebra as illustrated in the simplified Verhulst model of population dynamics: \\\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{N}{K}\\\\right) where N is the population, r is the maximum growth rate, K is the carrying capacity of the local environment, and dN/dt, the derivative of N with respect to time t, is the rate of change in population with time. Thus, the equation relates the growth rate of the population N to the current population size, incorporating the effect of the two constant parameters r and K. (Note that decrease is negative growth.) The choice of the letter K came from the German Kapazit√§tsgrenze (capacity limit), while r came from rate. =r-selection= r-selected species are those that emphasize high growth rates, typically exploit less-crowded ecological niches, and produce many offspring, each of which has a relatively low probability of surviving to adulthood (i.e., high r, low K).For example: A typical r species is the dandelion (genus Taraxacum). In unstable or unpredictable environments, r-selection predominates due to the ability to reproduce rapidly. There is little advantage in adaptations that permit successful competition with other organisms, because the environment is likely to change again. Among the traits that are thought to characterize r-selection are high fecundity, small body size, early maturity onset, short generation time, and the ability to disperse offspring widely. Organisms whose life history is subject to r-selection are often referred to as r-strategists or r-selected. Organisms that exhibit r-selected traits can range from bacteria and diatoms, to insects and grasses, to various semelparous cephalopods and small mammals, particularly rodents. As with K-selection, below, the r/K paradigm (Differential K theory) has controversially been associated with human behavior and separately evolved populations. =K-selection= A Bald eagle, an individual of a typical K-strategist species. K-strategists have longer life expectancies, produce relatively fewer offspring and tend to be altricial, requiring extensive care by parents when young. By contrast, K-selected species display traits associated with living at densities close to carrying capacity and typically are strong competitors in such crowded niches, that invest more heavily in fewer offspring, each of which has a relatively high probability of surviving to adulthood (i.e., low r, high K). In scientific literature, r-selected species are occasionally referred to as \\"opportunistic\\" whereas K-selected species are described as \\"equilibrium\\". In stable or predictable environments, K-selection predominates as the ability to compete successfully for limited resources is crucial and populations of K-selected organisms typically are very constant in number and close to the maximum that the environment can bear (unlike r-selected populations, where population sizes can change much more rapidly). Traits that are thought to be characteristic of K-selection include large body size, long life expectancy, and the production of fewer offspring, which often require extensive parental care until they mature. Organisms whose life history is subject to K-selection are often referred to as K-strategists or K-selected.\\"r and K selection\\". University of Miami Department of Biology. Retrieved February 4, 2011. Organisms with K-selected traits include large organisms such as elephants, humans, and whales, but also smaller, long-lived organisms such as Arctic terns, parrots and eagles. =Continuous spectrum= Although some organisms are identified as primarily r- or K-strategists, the majority of organisms do not follow this pattern. For instance, trees have traits such as longevity and strong competitiveness that characterise them as K-strategists. In reproduction, however, trees typically produce thousands of offspring and disperse them widely, traits characteristic of r-strategists.Hrdy, Sarah Blaffer (2000), \\"Mother Nature: Maternal Instincts and How They Shape the Human Species\\" (Ballantine Books) Similarly, reptiles such as sea turtles display both r- and K-traits: although sea turtles are large organisms with long lifespans (provided they reach adulthood), they produce large numbers of unnurtured offspring. The r/K dichotomy can be re- expressed as a continuous spectrum using the economic concept of discounted future returns, with r-selection corresponding to large discount rates and K-selection corresponding to small discount rates. Ecological succession In areas of major ecological disruption or sterilisation (such as after a major volcanic eruption, as at Krakatoa or Mount Saint Helens), r- and K-strategists play distinct roles in the ecological succession that regenerates the ecosystem. Because of their higher reproductive rates and ecological opportunism, primary colonisers typically are r-strategists and they are followed by a succession of increasingly competitive flora and fauna. The ability of an environment to increase energetic content, through photosynthetic capture of solar energy, increases with the increase in complex biodiversity as r species proliferate to reach a peak possible with K strategies. Eventually a new equilibrium is approached (sometimes referred to as a climax community), with r-strategists gradually being replaced by K-strategists which are more competitive and better adapted to the emerging micro-environmental characteristics of the landscape. Traditionally, biodiversity was considered maximized at this stage, with introductions of new species resulting in the replacement and local extinction of endemic species. However, the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis posits that intermediate levels of disturbance in a landscape create patches at different levels of succession, promoting coexistence of colonizers and competitors at the regional scale. Application While usually applied at the level of species, r/K selection theory is also useful in studying the evolution of ecological and life history differences between subspecies, for instance the African honey bee, A. m. scutellata, and the Italian bee, A. m. ligustica. At the other end of the scale, it has also been used to study the evolutionary ecology of whole groups of organisms, such as bacteriophages. Some researchers, such as Lee Ellis, J. Philippe Rushton, and Aurelio Jos√© Figueredo, have applied r/K selection theory to various human behaviors, including crime, sexual promiscuity, fertility, IQ, and other traits related to life history theory. Rushton's work resulted in him developing \\"differential K theory\\" to attempt to explain many variations in human behavior across geographic areas, a theory which has been criticized by many other researchers. Other researchers have proposed that the evolution of human inflammatory responses is related to r/K selection. Status Although r/K selection theory became widely used during the 1970s, it also began to attract more critical attention. In particular, a review by the ecologist Stephen C. Stearns drew attention to gaps in the theory, and to ambiguities in the interpretation of empirical data for testing it. In 1981, a review of the r/K selection literature by Parry demonstrated that there was no agreement among researchers using the theory about the definition of r- and K-selection, which led him to question whether the assumption of a relation between reproductive expenditure and packaging of offspring was justified. A 1982 study by Templeton and Johnson showed that in a population of Drosophila mercatorum under K-selection the population actually produced a higher frequency of traits typically associated with r-selection. Several other studies contradicting the predictions of r/K selection theory were also published between 1977 and 1994. When Stearns reviewed the status of the theory in 1992, he noted that from 1977 to 1982 there was an average of 42 references to the theory per year in the BIOSIS literature search service, but from 1984 to 1989 the average dropped to 16 per year and continued to decline. He concluded that r/K theory was a once useful heuristic that no longer serves a purpose in life history theory. More recently, the panarchy theories of adaptive capacity and resilience promoted by C. S. Holling and Lance Gunderson have revived interest in the theory, and use it as a way of integrating social systems, economics and ecology.Gunderson, L. H. and Holling C. S. (2001) [ Panarchy: Understanding Transformations in Human and Natural Systems] Island Press. . Writing in 2002, Reznick and colleagues reviewed the controversy regarding r/K selection theory and concluded that: Alternative approaches are now available both for studying life history evolution (e.g. Leslie matrix for an age- structured population) and for density-dependent selection (e.g. variable density lottery model).

Icon has fully reformed as of 2008, currently consisting of three-fifths of the classic lineup: Dan Wexler (guitar), Stephen Clifford (lead vocals), and John Aquilino (guitar), along with Dave Henzerling (bass) and Gary Bruzzese (drums). History =Formation= Originally known as The Schoolboys in 1979 (maybe earlier), Icon was formed in 1981, in Phoenix, Arizona, United States, by high school friends Dan Wexler (guitar), Stephen Clifford (lead vocals) and Tracy Wallach (bass). They were joined by Dave Henzerling (guitar) and John Covington (drums). Schoolboys released an EP Singin' Shoutin' and had a few songs on compilation albums. In 1984, Icon was signed to Capitol Records. By this point, Henzerling and Covington had left the band and were replaced by John Aquilino (guitar) and Pat Dixon (drums) (former drummer for Loosely Tight). =Background= In 1984, Icon released their self-titled debut, Icon, and toured to support it. The tour set list featured quite a few new songs intended for the next album as well as a few Deep Purple (\\"Highway Star\\") and Judas Priest covers. In 1985, Night of the Crime was released, produced by Eddie Kramer, mixed by Ron Nevison and featuring the songwriting talent of Bob Halligan Jr. During the mixing of the album, vocalist Stephen Clifford decided to leave the band for personal reasons. Regrouping, the band tried out a few different vocalists, lost their record deal and released a local-only cassette; More Perfect Union, featuring a polished pop-rock sound, a new singer (Jerry Harrison) and a keyboardist (Kevin Stoller). Although it was only released locally, it garnered enough attention to renew major-label interest in the group. In 1989, Right Between the Eyes was released on Atlantic/Megaforce, with Jerry Harrison on vocals and Drew Bollmann on second guitar. A video for \\"Taking My Breath Away\\" was played on MTV's Headbangers' Ball. Following the release of Right Between the Eyes and a supporting tour in the US opening for Ace Frehley and in the UK for King's X, the later included David Lauser on drums (currently Sammy Hagar's drummer) replacing Dixon, Icon disbanded. Singer Harrison recorded with a new project called Harlequin. The other band members continued to be involved in music projects; guitarist Dan Wexler in particular wrote and recorded with Alice Cooper (who had performed backing vocals on \\"Holy Man's War\\" from Right Between the Eyes). In 1994, (An Even) More Perfect Union‚Äîan expanded version of A More Perfect Union, including tracks recorded for potential release on Right Between the Eyes‚Äîwas released on CD. Icon also did a project together with lead singer Randy Baker, founder of the original Strange Daze a Tribute to the Doors band which included a 4-song demo and performing live. According to Baker, the project was \\"suggested by mutual management which in retrospect was a bad idea and lost me a record deal. As they were crashing and burning they took me with them.\\" =2008 reunion= In August 2008, Icon celebrated their reunion with a re-issue of a 1984 Bootleg Concert on DVD. Original members Wexler, Aquilino and Dixon, along with former member Dave Henzerling and new singer Scott Hammons had plans to record new material potentially for a new album. On November 29, 2008, Icon opened up for Tesla at the Dodge Theatre in their home town of Phoenix, Arizona. They received a very warm reception. Copies of their 1984 DVD were signed and sold and the band promised that new material was on the way. 93.3 KDKB, the local rock station, plugged Icon as a band they love yet rarely play. In May 2009, singer Scott Hammons decided to pursue a solo career so he decided to leave the band and was replaced with former Adler's Appetite vocalist Sheldon Tarsha, with whom the band played at Rocklahoma and opened for Queensr√øche in 2010. Previous plans to record new songs‚Äîpossibly for a new album‚Äîstill exist. However, Tarsha has left the band and original singer Stephen Clifford has re-entered the picture. There is a possibility both the original self-titled album Icon and Night of the Crime will be re-released in the near future. =Side projects= Wexler participated in other musical projects after Icon's disbandment, most notably co-writing several tracks with Alice Cooper. Henzerling was one of the guitarists for Carmine Appice's band King Kobra; played on the Lizzy Borden album Master of Disguise; and later joined forces with Wexler and Dixon in the band Tomcats.

To varying degrees, Black Hebrew Israelites incorporate certain aspects of the religious beliefs and practices of both Christianity and Judaism, though they have created their own interpretation of the Bible. Many choose to identify as Hebrew Israelites or Black Hebrews rather than Jews in order to indicate their claimed historic connections.Ben-Jochannan, p. 306. Black Hebrew Israelites are not associated with the mainstream Jewish community, and they do not meet the standards that are used to identify people as Jewish by the Jewish community. They are also outside the fold of mainstream Christianity, which considers Black Hebrew Israelism to be heresy. The Black Hebrew Israelite movement originated at the end of the 19th century, when Frank Cherry and William Saunders Crowdy both claimed to have received visions that African Americans are descendants of the Hebrews in the Bible; Cherry established the Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations, in 1886, and Crowdy founded the Church of God and Saints of Christ in 1896. Consequently, Black Hebrew groups were founded in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, from Kansas to New York City, by both African Americans and West Indian immigrants. In the mid-1980s, the number of Black Hebrews in the United States was between 25,000 and 40,000.Sundquist, p. 118. Black Hebrew Israelism is a non-homogenous movement with a number of groups that have varying beliefs and practices. Various sects of Black Hebrew Israelism have been criticized by academics for their promotion of historical revisionism. According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), \\"Some, but not all [Black Hebrew Israelites], are outspoken anti-Semites and racists.\\" As of December 2019, the Southern Poverty Law Center \\"lists 144 Black Hebrew Israelite organizations as black separatist hate groups because of their antisemitic and anti-white beliefs.\\" Former KKK Grand Wizard Tom Metzger once remarked to the Southern Poverty Law Center, \\"They're the black counterparts of us.\\"  History  The origins of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement are found in Frank Cherry and William Saunders Crowdy, who both claimed that they had revelations in which they believed that God told them that African Americans are descendants of the Hebrews in the Christian Bible; Cherry established the \\"Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations\\" in 1886, and Crowdy founded the \\"Church of God and Saints of Christ\\" in 1896. The Church of God and Saints of Christ, originating in Kansas, retained elements of a messianic connection to Jesus.Chireau, p. 21. In the late 19th century, Cherry's and Crowdy's followers propagated the claim that they were the biological descendants of the Israelites,Chireau, pp. 18, 21. and during the following decades, many more Black Hebrew congregations were established. After World War I, for example, Wentworth Arthur Matthew, an immigrant from Saint Kitts, founded another Black Hebrew congregation in Harlem, claiming descent from the ancient Israelites. He called it the \\"Commandment Keepers of the Living God.\\" Similar groups selected elements of Judaism and adapted them within a structure similar to that of the Black church. Matthew incorporated his congregation in 1930 and moved it to Brooklyn, where he later founded the Israelite Rabbinical Seminary, where Black Hebrew rabbis have been educated and ordained. The group sometimes employs street preaching to promote their ideology. Sidewalk ministers may employ provocation to advance a message that is often antisemitic, racist, and xenophobic.By Sarah Maslin Nir Dec. 12, 2019 The New York TimesBy Michael Kunzelman December 12, 2019 Associated Press This primarily gained notice in the news through their street preaching that targeted students of Covington Catholic High School in January 2019. One student reported the Black Hebrew Israelites called students 'racists', 'bigots', 'white crackers', 'faggots', and 'incest kids'. The street preachers also alluded to the film Get Out, telling an African American student that they would \\"harvest his organs\\".  Groups  During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, dozens of Black Hebrew organizations were established. In Harlem alone, at least eight such groups were founded between 1919 and 1931.Parfitt, Judaising Movements, p. 96. The Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations, is the oldest known Black Hebrew group, and the Church of God and Saints of Christ is one of the largest Black Hebrew organizations. The Commandment Keepers, founded by Wentworth Arthur Matthew in New York, are noted for their adherence to traditional Judaism. The African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem are widely known for having moved from the United States, primarily Chicago, to Israel in the late 20th century. Other Black Hebrew groups include the Israelite School of Universal Practical Knowledge, based in Philadelphia, and the Nation of Yahweh, based in Miami. = Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations = The oldest known Black Hebrew organization is the Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations.Singer, \\"Symbolic Identity Formation in an African American Religious Sect\\", p. 57.Chireau, pp. 30‚Äì31. \\"The founding dates of the earliest black- Jewish congregations are in dispute. Shapiro notes that F.S. Cherry's Church of God was organized in Tennessee in 1886, but other sources do not confirm this date. Another group, the Moorish Zion Temple, founded in 1899 by a Rabbi Richlieu of Brooklyn, New York, was one of the earliest black Jewish congregations that did not combine Jewish and Christian beliefs, as did the Church of God and the Saints of Christ.\\" The group was founded by Frank Cherry in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1886, and it later moved to Philadelphia.Singer, \\"Symbolic Identity Formation in an African American Religious Sect\\", pp. 57‚Äì58. Cherry, who was from the Deep South and had worked as a seaman and for the railroads before his ministry, taught himself Hebrew and Yiddish.Parfitt, Black Jews in Africa and the Americas, p. 88. Theologically, the Church of the Living God mixed elements of Judaism and Christianity, counting the Bible‚Äîincluding the New Testament‚Äîand the Talmud as essential scriptures.Fauset, p. 34.Dorman, \\"Black Israelites\\", p. 73. The rituals of Cherry's flock incorporated many Jewish practices and prohibitions alongside some Christian traditions.Fauset, pp. 36‚Äì40. For example, during prayer the men wore skullcaps and congregants faced east. In addition, members of the Church were not permitted to eat pork. Prayers were accompanied by musical instruments and gospel singing.Fauset, pp. 36‚Äì37. Cherry died in 1963, when he was about 95 years old; his son, Prince Benjamin F. Cherry, succeeded him.Singer, \\"The Southern Origin of Black Judaism\\", p. 130. Members of the church believed that he had temporarily left and would soon reappear in spirit in order to lead the church through his son. = Church of God and Saints of Christ = The former headquarters of the Church of God and Saints of Christ in Washington, D.C. The building is now known as First Tabernacle Beth El and it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Church of God and Saints of Christ was established in Lawrence, Kansas, in 1896 by African American William Saunders Crowdy. The group established its headquarters in Philadelphia in 1899, and Crowdy later relocated to Washington, D.C., in 1903. After Crowdy's death in 1908, the church continued to grow under the leadership of William Henry Plummer, who moved the organization's headquarters to its permanent location in Belleville, Virginia, in 1921.Wynia, pp. 31‚Äì34. In 1936, the Church of God and Saints of Christ had more than 200 \\"tabernacles\\" (congregations) and 37,000 members.Wynia, n.p. Howard Zebulun Plummer succeeded his father and became head of the organization in 1931.Greene, p. 42. His son, Levi Solomon Plummer, became the church's leader in 1975. The Church of God and Saints of Christ was led by Rabbi Jehu A. Crowdy, Jr., a great-grandson of William Saunders Crowdy, from 2001 until his death in 2016. Since 2016, it has been led by Phillip E. McNeil. As of 2005, the church had fifty tabernacles in the United States and dozens more in Africa. The Church of God and Saints of Christ describes itself as \\"the oldest African-American congregation in the United States that adheres to the tenets of Judaism\\". The church teaches that all Jews were originally black and that African Americans are descendants of the lost tribes of Israel.Kidd, p. 59.Singer, \\"Symbolic Identity Formation in an African American Religious Sect\\", p. 59. Members believe that Jesus was neither God nor the son of God, but rather an adherent of Judaism and a prophet. They also consider William Saunders Crowdy, their founder, to be a prophet.Gallagher, p. 146. The Church of God and Saints of Christ synthesizes rituals from both Judaism and Christianity. They have adopted rites drawn from both the Old and New Testaments. Its Old Testament observances include the use of the Jewish calendar, the celebration of Passover, the circumcision of infant males, the commemoration of the Sabbath on Saturday, and the wearing of yarmulkes. Its New Testament rites include baptism (immersion) and footwashing, both of which have Old Testament origins. = Commandment Keepers = The founder of the Commandment Keepers, Wentworth Arthur Matthew holding a Sefer Torah. Wentworth Arthur Matthew founded the Commandment Keepers Congregation in Harlem in 1919. Matthew was influenced by the non-black Jews he met as well as by Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League. Garvey used the Biblical Jews in exile as a metaphor for black people in North America. One of the accomplishments of Garvey's movement was to strengthen the connection between black Americans and Africa, Ethiopia in particular. When Matthew later learned about the Beta Israel‚ÄîEthiopian Jews‚Äîhe identified with them.Chireau, p. 25. Today the Commandment Keepers follow traditional Jewish practices and observe Jewish holidays.Moses, p. 537. Members observe kashrut, circumcise newborn boys, and celebrate Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, and their synagogue has a mechitza to separate men and women during worship. The Commandment Keepers believe that they are descendants of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.Parfitt, Judaising Movements, p. 95. Matthew taught that \\"the Black man is a Jew\\" and \\"all genuine Jews are Black men\\",Sundquist, p. 116. but he valued non-black Jews as those who had preserved Judaism over the centuries. Matthew maintained cordial ties with non-black Jewish leaders in New York and frequently invited them to worship at his synagogue.Wolfson, p. 48. Matthew established the Ethiopian Hebrew Rabbinical College (later renamed the Israelite Rabbinical Academy) in Brooklyn. He ordained more than 20 rabbis, who went on to lead congregations throughout the United States and the Caribbean. He remained the leader of the Commandment Keepers in Harlem, and in 1962 the congregation moved to a landmark building on 123rd Street. Matthew died in 1973, sparking an internal conflict over who would succeed him as head of the Harlem congregation. Shortly before his death, Matthew named his grandson, David Matthew Dor√©, as the new spiritual leader. Dor√© was 16 years old at the time. In 1975, the synagogue's board elected Rabbi Willie White to be its leader. Rabbi Dor√© occasionally conducted services at the synagogue until the early 1980s, when White had Dor√© and some other members locked out of the building. Membership declined throughout the 1990s, and by 2004, only a few dozen people belonged to the synagogue. In 2007 the Commandment Keepers sold the building while various factions among former members sued one another. Besides the Harlem group, there are eight or ten Commandment Keeper congregations in the New York area, and others exist throughout North America as well as in Israel.Goldschmidt, p. 221. Since 2000, seven rabbis have graduated from the Israelite Rabbinical Academy founded by Matthew. = African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem = African Hebrew Israelites speak to visitors in Dimona, Israel. A sign in Dimona. Ben Ammi Ben-Israel established the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem in Chicago, Illinois, in 1966, a time when black nationalism was on the rise as a response to the Civil Rights Movement. In 1969, after a sojourn in Liberia, Ben Ammi and about 30 Hebrew Israelites moved to Israel. Over the next 20 years, nearly 600 more members left the United States for Israel. As of 2006, about 2,500 Hebrew Israelites live in Dimona and two other towns in the Negev region of Israel, where they are widely referred to as Black Hebrews. In addition, there are African Hebrew Israelite communities in several major American cities, including Chicago, St. Louis, and Washington, D.C.Michaeli, p. 75. The Black Hebrews believe they are descended from members of the Tribe of Judah who were exiled from the Land of Israel after the Romans destroyed the Second Temple in 70 CE. The group incorporates elements of African-American culture into their interpretation of the Bible. They do not recognize rabbinical Jewish interpretations such as the Talmud. The Black Hebrews observe Shabbat and biblically ordained Jewish holidays such as Yom Kippur and Passover.Michaeli, p. 76. Men wear tzitzit on their African print shirts, women follow the niddah (biblical laws concerning menstruation), and newborn boys are circumcised. In accordance with their interpretation of the Bible, the Black Hebrews follow a strictly vegan diet and only wear natural fabrics. Most men have more than one wife, and birth control is not permitted. When the first Black Hebrews arrived in Israel in 1969, they claimed citizenship under the Law of Return, which gives eligible Jews immediate citizenship.Michaeli, pp. 73‚Äì74. The Israeli government ruled in 1973 that the group did not qualify for automatic citizenship because they could not prove Jewish descent and had not undergone Orthodox conversion. The Black Hebrews were denied work permits and state benefits. The group accused the Israeli government of racist discrimination.Michaeli, p. 74. In 1981, a group of American civil rights activists led by Bayard Rustin investigated and concluded that racism was not the cause of the Black Hebrews' situation. No official action was taken to return the Black Hebrews to the United States, but some individual members were deported for working illegally. Some Black Hebrews renounced their American citizenship in order to try to prevent more deportations. In 1990, Illinois legislators helped negotiate an agreement that resolved the Black Hebrews' legal status in Israel. Members of the group are permitted to work, and they also have access to housing and social services. The Black Hebrews reclaimed their American citizenship and have received aid from the U.S. government, which helped them build a school and additional housing. In 2003 the agreement was revised, and the Black Hebrews were granted permanent residency in Israel. In 2009, Elyakim Ben-Israel became the first Black Hebrew to gain Israeli citizenship. The Israeli government said that more Black Hebrews may be granted citizenship. The Black Hebrews of Israel maintain a gospel choir, which tours throughout Israel and the United States. The group owns restaurants in several Israeli cities. In 2003 the Black Hebrews garnered public attention when singer Whitney Houston visited them in Dimona. In 2006, Eddie Butler, a Black Hebrew, was chosen by the Israeli public to represent Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest.  Extremist fringe  In late 2008, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) wrote that \\"the extremist fringe of the Hebrew Israelite movement\\" is black supremacist. It also wrote that the members of such groups \\"believe that Jews are devilish impostors and ... openly condemn whites as evil personified, deserving only death or slavery\\". The SPLC also wrote that \\"most Hebrew Israelites are neither explicitly racist nor anti-Semitic and do not advocate violence\\". The Black Hebrew groups that are characterized as black supremacist by the SPLC include the Israelite School of Universal Practical Knowledge, the Nation of Yahweh and the Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ. Also, the Anti-Defamation League has written that the \\"12 Tribes of Israel\\" website, which is maintained by a Black Hebrew group, promotes black supremacy. As of December 2019, the Southern Poverty Law Center \\"lists 144 Black Hebrew Israelite organizations as black separatist hate groups because of their antisemitic and anti-white beliefs.\\" A 1999 FBI terrorism risk assessment report stated that \\"violent radical fringe members\\" of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement hold \\"beliefs [that] bear a striking resemblance to the Christian Identity theology practiced by many white supremacists.\\" It also reported that \\"the overwhelming majority of [Black Hebrew Israelites] are unlikely to engage in violence.\\" On December 10, 2019, two people who had expressed interest in the Black Hebrew Israelite movement were killed in a shootout with police after killing a police detective at Bayview Cemetery and three people at the JC Kosher Supermarket in Jersey City, New Jersey: the Jewish co-owner of the grocery store, an employee, and a Jewish shopper. Authorities treated the incident as an act of domestic terrorism. Capers Funnye, who has been the rabbi for the past 26 years of the 200-member Beth Shalom B'nai Zaken Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation,By Zev Chafets for the New York Times, Barack Obama's Rabbi - Capers Funnye - Profile \\"Funnye, the chief rabbi of the Beth Shalom B‚Äônai Zaken Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation in Chicago\\"By Julia Lieblich for the Chicago Tribune Dec. 13, 2019 \\"Commentary: Rabbi Capers Funnye, other Black Hebrew Israelites wrongly connected to Jersey City shooters\\", \\"'I felt terrible that innocent lives were taken first and foremost,' said Funnye, rabbi for 26 years of the 200-member Beth Shalom B‚Äônai Zaken Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation of Chicago, a member of the Chicago Board of Rabbis and the chief rabbi of the International Israelite Board of Rabbis.\\" condemned the attack and said that his community was \\"gripped by sadness\\" over \\"the heinous actions of two disturbed individuals who cloaked themselves in anti-Semitism and hate- filled rhetoric\\". He also criticized the media reports by saying it was \\"unfortunate that the media uses the term ‚ÄòBlack Hebrew Israelites‚Äô without distinction as if the description is a one size fits all and it is absolutely not!\\" Funnye emphasized that \\"we don‚Äôt want to be seen as some radical fringe group with a false narrative because we are black and profess Judaism; we are Torah-oriented Jews.\\" On December 28, 2019, a man with a machete attacked several Orthodox Jewish people during Hanukkah celebrations in a house in Monsey, New York. Authorities revealed the fact that his journals included what appeared to be a reference to Black Hebrew Israelites stating that \\"Hebrew Israelites\\" have taken from \\"ebinoid Israelites\\".  Criticism of theological and historical claims  African American Christian apologetics organizations, such as the Jude 3 Project, have critiqued the theological and historical claims which have been presented by various Black Hebrew Israelite sects. Zimbabwean novelist Masimba Musodza has stated that the doctrine which is taught by Black Hebrew Israelites \\"force[s] their own ideas onto the text to promote their own agenda, which serves no purpose at all except to engender antisemitism in Black communities in western countries.\\" The historian Josephus, as well as theologians Emil Sch√ºrer and Friedrich M√ºnter, wrote of Jewish slaves who were sold and served as labourers in Egypt and the Roman Empire, contradicting the Black Hebrew Israelite claim that Egypt is a metaphor for the Americas. Additionally, contrary to what is taught by Black Hebrew Israelites, no Kingdom of Judah existed in West Africa, and the Middle Eastern state has no connection with the Kingdom of Whydah. Black Hebrew Israelites have been criticized for making historical revisionist claims that do not acknowledge the poverty that Jews experienced as immigrants in the United States. Fran Markowitz, a Professor of Cultural Anthropology at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, writes that the Hebrew Israelite view of the transatlantic slave trade conflicts with historical accounts, as does the Hebrew Israelite belief that Socrates and William Shakespeare were black.

Kaestner is a retired American diplomat and amateur ornithologist who most recently served as the chief of the Consular Section at the U.S. Consulate General in Frankfurt, Germany. From May 2013 to 2014 he was the Senior Civilian Representative in Northern Afghanistan, based at Camp Marmal, Mazar-e Sharif. From 2009 to late 2012 he was a senior inspector in the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. State Department. From 2006 to 2009 he was the Minister Counselor for Consular Affairs of the American Embassy in New Delhi, India. As Minister Counselor, he oversaw consular operations in New Delhi and the U.S. Consulates Generals in Mumbai (Bombay), Chennai (Madras), Hyderabad, and Kolkata (Calcutta). He retired from the Foreign Service in August 2016. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1953 to Benjamin Henry Kaestner, Jr. and Alice (Reed) Kaestner, he is the middle child of 10 siblings and step- siblings. After spending two years in the Peace Corps in Zaire, Kaestner entered the Foreign Service in 1980, and has been assigned in the past to India, Egypt, Brazil, Guatemala, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Colombia, Malaysia, and Namibia. In 1990 he had his first child with his wife Kimberly Vreeland Kaestner, Katherine Kaestner. In 1991 the couple had a second child, Laurel Kaestner. An avid birder, he has taken advantage of his position as an international diplomat to follow his hobby more avidly than is normally possible. By 1986, he had become the first birder to see a representative of each bird family in the world, though the list of bird families recognized by science has changed considerably since then. (He has stayed current, and has seen an example of all 239 living families of birds.) In 1989, while on a birding expedition near Bogota, Colombia, where he was a U.S. consular officer, he discovered a species new to science, the Cundinamarca Antpitta (Grallaria kaestneri), which was subsequently named after him.

Some Rhizopus species are opportunistic agents of human zygomycosis (fungal infection) and can be fatal. Rhizopus infections may also be a complication of diabetic ketoacidosis. This widespread genus includes at least eight species. Rhizopus 400x magnification Rhizopus species grow as filamentous, branching hyphae that generally lack cross-walls (i.e., they are coenocytic). They reproduce by forming asexual and sexual spores. In asexual reproduction, sporangiospores are produced inside a spherical structure, the sporangium. Sporangia are supported by a large apophysate columella atop a long stalk, the sporangiophore. Sporangiophores arise among distinctive, root-like rhizoids. In sexual reproduction, a dark zygospore is produced at the point where two compatible mycelia fuse. Upon germination, a zygospore produces colonies that are genetically different from either parent. *R. microsporus var. oligosporus is used to make tempeh, a fermented food derived from soybeans. *R. oryzae is used in the production of alcoholic beverages in parts of Asia and Africa. *Rhizopus stolonifer (black bread mold) causes fruit rot on strawberry, tomato, and sweet potato and used in commercial production of fumaric acid and cortisone.

It is an autobiographical comedy mixed in with some social commentary, and is based on the college memories of Fleming. The film was given an R rating by the Motion Picture Association of America. Plot Due to an administrative error two male college students, the shy and intellectual Eddy (Josh Charles) and the All-American jock Stuart (Stephen Baldwin), end up with a female roommate. The university thought that Alex (Lara Flynn Boyle) was a man (based on her name) and thus the three students are forced to live with each other until the university can move Alex to a female residence hall. Alex falls in love and tries unsuccessfully to seduce Eddy, who is gay; Eddy falls in love with Stuart; and Stuart is in love with Alex. The trio become good friends and scare off anyone who tries to seduce the other. Eventually, Alex, Stuart and Eddy agree to have an actual threesome that seems to destroy the friendship, and raises the possibility that Alex might have become pregnant. After the threesome, they start to drift apart. Three weeks later the semester ends; Alex moves to an apartment, and Eddy gets a single dorm. Eddy (who acts as the film's narrator) eventually finds a boyfriend, Stuart finds happiness in a monogamous relationship with a woman, and Alex remains single. While they now only see each other for lunch occasionally, they do not seem to regret the friendship they had while in college.

Its sole mission is to raise the funds and awareness necessary to operate and maintain St. Jude. ALSAC is the largest healthcare related charity in the United States. The National Executive Office is located in Memphis, Tennessee. ALSAC also has over 30 local fundraising offices located in cities throughout the United States that hold over 30,000 fundraising events annually. Purpose and activities As of 2017, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital requires more than $2.4 million in operating costs each day, and public contributions provide more than 75 percent of the funds necessary to operate the hospital. Only 14% of the money to operate the hospital comes from insurance recoveries and 9% comes from grants. To cover these costs, ALSAC has been raising more than $1 billion annually for the hospital through its more than 30,000 fund- raising activities. These include the FedEx St. Jude Classic, which is a PGA Tour event and one of the most visible fund-raising events for the hospital. Other fund-raising programs include the St. Jude Math-A-Thon, Up 'til Dawn, direct mailings, radiothons and television marketing. St. Jude also has a merchandise catalog called the Hope Catalog. The catalog contains everything from shirts to office items, and from patient art to \\"Give Thanks\\" wristbands. One of the hospital's most recent and successful fund-raising efforts has been the Dream Home Giveaway. The giveaway allows contest entrants to reserve tickets for $100 each to qualify to win homes valued up to $500,000. The Dream Home Giveaway, one of the largest national fund-raising programs, is conducted in cities across the United States. In November 2004, St. Jude launched its inaugural Thanks and Giving campaign which encourages consumers to help raise funds at participating retailers by adding a donation at checkout or by purchasing specialty items to benefit St. Jude. The campaign is supported by network television spots, advertisements in major publications, featured content on the TODAY show, interactive marketing on AOL and a movie trailer that runs on 20,000 screens nationwide. St. Jude has been named one of two International Philanthropic Projects of Epsilon Sigma Alpha International, a women's service sorority. Since 1972, ESA has raised more than $200 million for St. Jude. Fund usage From 2013 to 2016, 81 cents of every dollar received has supported the research and treatment at St. Jude. In FY2016, 72% of ALSAC and St. Jude expenses were allocated to program services (33.3% patient care, 30.8% research, 7.5% education and training). The above statement conflates ALSAC and St. Jude, however. More precisely, as a separate entity, ALSAC's FY2016 IRS Form 990 for FYE 6/30/2016 shows that of the $1.156 billion of Fundraising Revenue (that is, not including investment returns from the nearly $4.0 billion \\"Fund\\" that ALSAC has accumulated), only $807 million was granted to the St. Jude Hospital. This represents only 69.8% of Fundraising Revenue to St. Jude for FY2016 (FYE 6/30/2016). Total ALSAC Revenue for FY2016 (FYE 6/30/2016) was $1.260 billion; this includes Fundraising Revenue of $1.156 billion, Investment Returns of $104 million, and Other Revenue of $26 million.

She served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Liberal from 1986 to 1990, and was a cabinet minister in the government of David Peterson. Background Hart was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Her father was a Court of Appeal judge. She graduated from the law school at the University of Toronto in 1973 and worked for law firms Weir and Foulds, Morris/Rose/Ledgett and Lerners in Toronto. At the time of entering public life in 1986, Hart was known as one of Canada's experts in transportation law. Politics She was elected to the Ontario legislature in a by-election, held on April 17, 1986 in the Toronto riding of York East. Hart defeated her closest opponent, Progressive Conservative Gina Brannan, by 1,391 votes in a riding formerly held by the PCs. She was re-elected by a much greater margin in the 1987 provincial election. Hart was appointed Minister of Culture and Communications on August 2, 1989. Prior to that she served her apprenticeship as Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Health (Murray Elston, 1986), the Minister of the Environment (Jim Bradley, 1987) and the Treasurer (Robert Nixon, 1988). She resigned on June 4, 1990 over a possible conflict of interest with a telecommunications company that had donated to her election campaign over which her ministry had influence. The Liberals were defeated by the New Democratic Party in the 1990 provincial election. Hart was defeated by New Democrat candidate Gary Malkowski by 789 votes. =Cabinet posts= Later career Following the 1990 election, Hart continued to practice commercial and regulatory law and became accredited as a mediator (Harvard) and facilitator. In 1994 she was tapped to lead the Ontario Supreme Court's Alternative Dispute Resolution Pilot Project, which successfully provided an alternative to trial-based civil litigation, resolving more than half of the cases sent to it, before examinations for discovery. Hart joined KPMG as a partner in 1996, and in May 1997, she became president of KPMG Conflict Solutions Inc., a company specializing in conflict management services. In 1998 Hart founded Accord/hart & associates inc., a firm offering a comprehensive conflict management services across Canada, and she continues as its president resolving business and governance conflicts. Throughout her career, Hart has been an author and a teacher. Published works include \\"Bypass Court: A Dispute Resolution Handbook\\" with Genevieve Chornenki (5th ed., 2015)and \\"Freight Claims in Plain English\\", with Bill Augello (1995). She has taught transportation, regulatory, environmental, ADR, and governance subjects in the Bar Admission Course, for the Law Society, the Ontario Bar Association, and continues to teach new judges how to mediate through the National Judicial Institute. Hart has actively served as a Director and Governor of a range of not-for-profit organizations for more than 30 years. Her long-standing interest in best governance practices led her to enroll and graduate from (March, 2005) the University of Toronto Rotman School of Management's Director's Education Program, becoming an accredited Corporate Director in June, 2005. She is currently a member of the boards of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) and the General Insurance OmbudService.

(cont. updated) A List of Accepted Bromeliaceae Names . University Botanic Gardens, Utrecht (accessed: 20-12-2019). The genus is named for Giovanni Battista Brocchi, Italian naturalist (1772‚Äì1826). Brocchinia species are native primarily to the ancient Guayana Shield in southern Venezuela and Guyana, with some species extending into Colombia and northern Brazil.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families Its species are generally restricted to areas of sand and sandstone of the Roraima Formation; a few occur on granite.Givnish TJ, Burkhardt EL, Happel RE, Weintraub JW. 1985. Carnivory in the bromeliad Brocchinia reducta, with a cost/benefit model for the general restriction of carnivorous plants to sunny, moist, nutrient-poor habitats. American Naturalist 124: 479-497. Based on chloroplast DNA sequence variation, Brocchinia appears to be sister to all other bromeliads.Givnish TJ, Millam KC, Berry PE, Sytsma KJ. 2007. Phylogeny, adaptive radiation, and historical biogeography of Bromeliaceae inferred from ndhF sequence data. Aliso 23: 3-26. Calibration of the molecular family tree of bromeliads against the known ages of various fossil monocots suggests that Brocchinia lineage diverged from other bromeliads nearly 20 million years ago, and that some of the living species of Brocchinia began diverging from each other soon thereafter. The next lineage to diverge from other bromeliads included Lindmania and Connellia, which are also endemic to the Guayana Shield; at least one other subfamily Navioideae is also almost entirely restricted to that region. Consequently, it is quite likely that the family as a whole arose in the Guayana Shield. Previously, Brocchinia was thought to be a member of the bromeliad subfamily Pitcairnioideae, based on its possession of winged seeds like those seen in other members of that group.Gilmartin AJ. 1988. Phylogenetic relationships of groups of genera within the subfamily Pitcairnioideae (Bromeliaceae). Systematic Botany, 13: 283-293.Benzing DH. 1980. The Biology of the Bromeliads. California: Mad River Press.Benzing DH. 2000. Bromeliaceae: Portrait of an Adaptive Radiation, Cambridge University Press, New York. This view has now been overturned after the recognition that Pitcairnioideae as originally circumscribed more than a century ago represents several morphologically similar but independently derived groups that share only ancestral (plesiomorphic) characters, not true synapomorphies (shared derived characters). Brocchinia has undergone a spectacular adaptive radiation in mechanisms of nutrient capture, apparently in response to the unusually infertile, heavily leached substrates of the Guayana Shield.Givnish TJ, Sytsma KJ, Smith JE, Hahn WJ, Benzing DH, Burkhardt EL. 1997. Molecular evolution and adaptive radiation in Brocchinia (Bromeliaceae: Pitcairnioideae) atop tepuis of the Guayana Shield. Pp. 259-311 in TJ Givnish and KJ Sytsma, \\"Molecular Evolution and Adaptive Radiation\\", Cambridge University Press At least two species, Brocchinia reducta and B. hechtioides, appear to be carnivorous. Like most species of Brocchinia ‚Äì and indeed, of many other bromeliad genera ‚Äì these two species impound rain water in a tank formed by tightly overlapping leaves arranged in a basal rosette. In these species, however, the leaves are nearly vertical, their inner surfaces are covered with fine wax that readily exfoliates, the tank fluid is highly acid (pH 3.0) and emits a sweet, nectar- like odor, and the tank itself is full of the dead remains of ants (B. reducta) or bees and wasps (B. hechtioides). Recently, it has been shown that at least B. reducta secretes a phosphatase into its tanks.Plachno BJ, Jankun A. 2005. Phosphatase activity in glandular structures of carnivorous plant traps, International Botanical Congress Vienna, P1716, The Jagiellonian Univ., Inst. of Botany, Dept. of Plant Cytology and Embryology, Krakow, Poland. Another species, Brocchinia acuminata, is ant-fed myrmecophyte, apparently depending in part on nutrients and dead nestmates dropping into the tank from ants that live among the swollen, achlorophyllous leaf bases. The facultative epiphyte B. tatei ‚Äì together with the tree-like B. micrantha with its massive, gutter-like leaf axils that hold liters of rainwater ‚Äì captures a great deal of falling vegetable debris. One terrestrial population of B. tatei was discovered with heterocystous cyanobacteria in its tanks, suggesting nitrogen fixation. The earliest divergent members of the genus ‚Äì including Brocchinia prismatica in the Prismatica clade, and such species as B. melanacra and B. vestita in the Maguirei clade ‚Äì lack tanks entirely and appear to depend solely on soil nutrients. Acquisition of the tank habit seems likely to have been the key innovation driving the evolution of specialized mechanisms of nutrient capture in Brocchinia, and is associated with thin leaf cross- sections and the later evolution of carnivory, ant-fed myrmecophily, epiphytism, and N fixation in the Acuminata and Reducta clades. Each of the nutritionally specialized species have relatively large areas of live trichomes on the leaf bases that can absorb amino acids at high rates. Tanks and absorptive trichomes were later lost secondarily in Brocchinia steyermarkii, a terrestrial species common in wet sandy areas in the Gran Sabana.Benzing DH, Givnish TJ, Bermudes D. 1985. Absorptive trichomes in Brocchinia reducta (Bromeliaceae) and their evolutionary and systematic significance. Systematic Botany, 10(1): 81-91. Brocchinia melanacra is especially adapted to ground fires, with highly sclerotized leaf tips that protect that single bud in unexpanded leaves but appear to be useless (often dangling limply in the breeze) in fully expanded leaves. Brocchinia serrata, a highly aberrant taxon with tough, serrate leaves that is found only on a few mesetas in Colombia, has now been shown to be completely unrelated and has been described as the sole member of a new genus Sequencia, with its name reflecting its initial recognition based on DNA sequence data.

This transition to new signs is a slow process that will take years before the old signs are completely out of commission. The state will be replacing the old signs as needed, so both versions can currently be seen while driving on North Dakota roads. According to NDDOT, this change was made for a number of reasons. These include the department's centennial celebration, to demonstrate the significant spending to improve North Dakota roads in the past few years, and to keep uniformity across the United States. According to an NDDOT representative, \\"a number of different states use their state outline or symbol on the highway signs.\\" However, many states use geometric shapes or silhouettes of state symbols for their highway markers, which leads some North Dakota residents to believe NDDOT's decision to change the marker design was done to satisfy the political correctness movement.

The film is based on a story by Jack Arnold and Robert M. Fresco, with a screenplay by Fresco and Norman Jolley.Warren 1982 The Monolith Monsters tells the story of a large meteorite that crashes in a Southern California desert and explodes into hundreds of black fragments which have strange properties. When those fragments are exposed to water, they grow very large and tall. The fragments also begin to slowly petrify some of the inhabitants of a nearby small town. The story that unfolds becomes one of human survival against an encroaching unnatural disaster, that if not stopped, could become a national ecological nightmare that could pose a possible threat to all of humanity. Plot In the desert outside of San Angelo, California, a huge meteorite crashes and explodes, scattering hundreds of black fragments over a wide area. The next day, Federal geologist Ben Gilbert (Phil Harvey) brings one of the fragments to his office, where he and local newspaper publisher Martin Cochrane (Les Tremayne) examine it. That night, a strong wind blows over a full water container onto the black rock, starting a chemical reaction. When Dave Miller (Grant Williams), the head of San Angelo's district geological office, returns from a business trip, he finds Ben's corpse in a rock-hard, petrified state and the office's lab damaged by large rock fragments. Dave's girlfriend, teacher Cathy Barrett (Lola Albright), takes her students on a desert field trip; young Ginny Simpson (Linda Scheley) pockets a piece of the black meteorite rock, later washing it in a large tub outside her family's farmhouse. In town Dr. E. J. Reynolds (Richard H. Cutting) performs Ben's autopsy and cannot explain the body's condition; he informs Dave and Police Chief Dan Corey (William Flaherty) the body is being sent to a specialist. Martin returns to the wrecked office with Dave where he recognizes the large fragments as the same type of black rock Ben had been examining. Cathy joins them, also recognizing the fragments. She goes with the two men to the Simpson farm; they find the farmhouse in ruins under a large pile of black rocks and Ginny's parents dead. The girl is still alive but in a catatonic state. At Dr. Reynolds' request, they rush her to Dr. Steve Hendricks (Harry Jackson) at the California Medical Research Institute in Los Angeles. He later reports that Ginny is slowly turning to stone; her only hope lies with identifying the black rock within eight hours. Dave brings a fragment to his old college professor, Arthur Flanders (Trevor Bardette), who determines that it came from a meteorite. Back at the Simpson farm, both men notice a discoloration in the ground: The black rock is draining something from everything it touches, including people. Later, tests show that silicon is that substance; in humans it is normally just a trace element. Dr. Reynolds explains that research indicates that one possible function of silicon in the human body is to maintain human tissue flexibility. They suddenly realize that the meteorite's absorption of silicon was the cause of Ben's death, Ginny's condition, and the death of her parents; Steve then prepares and administers a silicon solution injection to the girl. Returning to the desert, Dave and Arthur trace the fragments to the crashed meteor. Arthur deduces that the meteorite's atomic structure has been radically altered by the intense heat of atmospheric friction. Back in the lab, a rainstorm blows up while Dave and Arthur continue their investigation. A piece of black rock falls into the sink and begins to react when hot coffee is poured on it; the men then realize that water is the culprit. With it raining outside, they hurriedly return to the desert and see the black fragments now growing into stories-tall monoliths that rise up and then crash back to Earth, breaking into hundreds more fragments, each fragment then repeating that cycle. Dave quickly realizes that the monoliths' advancing path will take them directly through San Angelo, and from there the monoliths could spread and possibly threaten all life on Earth. They report and explain the threat to Dan, who then makes plans to evacuate San Angelo. The governor is notified, and declares a state of emergency in the San Angelo area. At the hospital, Ginny finally revives, and Dave deduces that something in the silicon solution will check the fragments' growth. More locals are soon rushed to Dr. Reynolds' office in various stages of petrification. With little time left, and the telephone and electricity cut off, the monoliths continue to multiply and advance, soaking up water from the rain-soaked soil. Dave and Arthur struggle to find the correct formula; they finally realize the monoliths can be stopped with a simple saline solution, a part of Steve's silicon formula. Dave plans to dynamite the local dam and flood the nearby salt flats, creating a large supply of salt water. Because the dam is private property, however, Dan attempts to contact the governor for permission to blow up the dam. Knowing they must halt the monoliths at the canyon's edge, Dave acts without waiting for the governor's approval and the dynamite is detonated. The group watches as a huge torrent of water flows over the salt deposits at the canyon's edge, reaching the monoliths; their growth is finally halted when the last huge formation of monoliths crashes down into the salty water. Dan reveals to the group that he had finally reached the governor who told him not to blow up the dam, pauses, and adds unless Dave was absolutely certain of success. As they all laugh, Dave then comments, first repeating Martin's earlier assertion that the region's salt flat was \\"Mother Nature's worst mistake\\", then pointing out, ironically, that this near-disaster has just proved otherwise.

Opening narration \\"From time immemorial, the Earth has been bombarded by objects from outer space. Bits and pieces of the Universe piercing our atmosphere in an invasion that never ends. Meteor, the shooting stars on which so many earthly wishes have been born! Of the thousands that plummet toward us, the greater part are destroyed in a fiery flash as they strike the layers of the air that encircle us. Only a small percentage survives. Most of those fall into the water which covers two-thirds of our world. But from time to time from the beginning of time a very few meteors have struck the crust of the Earth and formed craters - craters of all sizes sought after, poured over by scientists of all nations for the priceless knowledge buried within them. In every moment of every day they come from planets belonging to stars whose dying light is too far away to be seen. From infinity they come. Meteors! Another strange calling card from the limitless regions of space - its substance unknown, its secrets unexplored. The meteor lies dormant in the night, waiting\\"! Production Many of the exteriors were filmed in the Alabama Hills in Lone Pine, California, whose rugged landscape has been used in films such as Gunga Din, High Sierra, Maverick, How the West Was Won, The Charge of the Light Brigade, and Gladiator. Most of the exteriors of downtown San Angelo were shot on Universal's back lot, particularly Courthouse Square. The film's \\"California Medical Research Institute\\" is the same fictional facility that also features prominently in Universal's The Incredible Shrinking Man, released eight months earlier, which also starred Grant Williams. =Special effects= The film's special effects were created by Clifford Stine, whose career began in 1933 with King Kong. Alternate takes from Universal's It Came from Outer Space (1953), which Stine also created, were used for the meteor crash in the film's opening sequence. Reception In a contemporary review, the Monthly Film Bulletin described the feature as a \\"promising idea\\" but noted that it was not supported by either the acting or the script. The film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an audience approval score of 42%. One review noted, ‚ÄúGive Hollywood a measured amount of credit for at least attempting to give us something unique and unusual, even if it comes up a little short\\". CineOutsider observed, ‚ÄúCertainly it lacks the sub textual clout that distinguishes the best of these films, but its central concept, its pacing and its impressive production design and effects still put it on a par with its more widely seen contemporaries. The performances are all solid, but my favorite comes from an uncredited William Schallert as the wrapped-up-in-his-job weatherman. For fans of 50s science fiction cinema, enthusiastically recommended‚Äù. Home media Universal released The Monolith Monsters on DVD as part of a boxed set called The Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection, which features 4 additional Universal feature films: The Incredible Shrinking Man, Monster on the Campus, The Mole People, and Tarantula. In June 2019, Shout Factory released the film on Blu- ray. The disc includes an audio commentary track by Tom Weaver and David Schecter.

He was the successor to Manfred Rommel and he is a member of the CDU. Wolfgang Schuster (2012) Career =Studies and early positions= Schuster studied law and political science in T√ºbingen, Geneva and Freiburg from 1969 to 1973. During his studies he joined Guestfalia T√ºbingen, one of Germany's largest Catholic student associations. From 1974 to 1976 he trained in Ulm before completing his doctorate in civil law. From 1976 to 1977 Schuster studied at the Paris √âcole nationale d'administration (ENA). =Political career= In 1975, he represented the CDU on Ulm city council before acting as personal assistant to Manfred Rommel from 1985 onwards. In 1986, he was elected mayor of Schw√§bisch Gm√ºnd where he was in office until 1993 before becoming burgomaster for the arts, education and sport in the Baden-W√ºrttemberg capital of Stuttgart in 1996. In elections for the post of Lord Mayor of Stuttgart, he won the office in the second ballot on 10 November 1996, defeating Rezzo Schlauch, the candidate for the Alliance '90/The Greens on a relatively narrow margin of 43.1% versus 39.3%. On 24 October 2004, Schuster was re-elected to the post in the second ballot with 53.3% of votes. His opponents were Ute Kumpf (SPD), who gained 45.2% of votes in the 2nd ballot, and Boris Palmer (Alliance '90/The Greens) ‚Äì who withdrew his candidacy after the first ballot, indirectly recommending that his supporters should back Schuster instead. On 6 December 2010 Schuster was elected president of the Council of European Municipalities and Regions. When completing his term as Lord Mayor on 6 January 2013, he was made \\"honoured citizen\\" (Ehrenb√ºrger). His successor Fritz Kuhn is member of the German Green party, thus being the first post-war Mayor of Stuttgart not member of CDU. =Political priorities= Schuster's political agenda includes the furthering of economic development and construction, intercultural dialogue and the promotion of child-friendly policies, among others. He promotes the interests of intercultural dialogue and the sharing of religious ideas and is the founder of the Stuttgart Religious Round Table. As a representative of the Deutsche St√§dtetag, a voluntary coalition of county boroughs and district-affiliated towns in Germany, Schuster is a member of the broadcasting council of SWR radio. Schuster has a declared aim to turn Stuttgart into Germany's most child-friendly city. =Achievements in office= In 2004 Schuster's re-election to office was attributed to Stuttgart's favourable economic development during his first term. The biggest and most high-profile project during his office has been Stuttgart 21 ‚Äì a major rail project to build a new underground through station for Stuttgart, also encompassing connections to existing surface and underground lines. The project was officially approved on 19 July 2007. Schuster is longlisted for the 2008 World Mayor award and was voted second most successful Mayor in Germany in a survey by Wirtschaftswoche magazine. In 2004, he was the only (active) local politician nominated for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung \\"Reformer of the Year\\" award. He was awarded a UNESCO Cities for Peace Prize for his work advancing integration of immigrant communities, and has established the EU Cities for Children network in cooperation with the Robert Bosch Foundation and Stuttgart-based carmaker Daimler. In October 2008, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel named Schuster the German member of a 12-strong reflection group called the \\"Council of Wise Men to Rethink Europe\\" which is headed by former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.http://www.euractiv.com/en/future-eu/twelve-wise-men-rethink- europe/article-176335 EurActiv.com 14 October 2008 =Criticism, controversy and setbacks= Shortly after funding was finalised for Stuttgart 21, the political opponents of Wolfgang Schuster were quick to condemn him for backtracking on a promise made during the mayor elections of 2004 ‚Äì namely that he would allow the population of Stuttgart to decide the fate of Stuttgart 21 if the additional costs of the project for the city of Stuttgart amounted to more than ‚Ç¨200 million. The agreement contained a provision that the local government would have to participate in covering a cost increases possibly up to an amount above ‚Ç¨200 million should the actual project costs significantly exceed planned costs. The Greens subsequently accused Schuster publicly of breaking his word. Schuster responded that the projected cost increase for the city of Stuttgart amounted to ‚Ç¨84 million and thus significantly less than the amount for which he had promised a referendum. In November 2007 a citizens' petition against the Stuttgart 21 project gained 67,000 signatures. After further legal wrangling appeals were submitted for a local referendum which experts subsequently deemed unlawful as contracts had already been signed and Stuttgart was not the main source (other backers include Deutsche Bahn, the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg and the EU). Failed projects pointed to by opponents during the office of Schuster include Stuttgart's last place as German candidate for the 2012 Olympic games and the stopping of a project to build a German Trump Tower in the north of Stuttgart. Personal life Schuster is married to a female doctor since 1979 and has three children and four grandchildren.

It was formed in the aftermath of the German invasion of the Soviet Union and fought on the Eastern Front as part of the German Army (Wehrmacht) and later the Waffen SS alongside similar formations from other parts of German-occupied Europe. Established in July 1941, the Walloon Legion was envisaged by L√©on Degrelle's Rexist Party as a means of demonstrating its loyalty and political indispensability in German- occupied Belgium where it had been largely ignored since the German invasion of May 1940. A similar formation had already been created by Flemish collaborators as the Flemish Legion, preventing Degrelle from being able to establish the \\"Belgian Legion\\" he had originally intended. The Walloon Legion, initially part of the Wehrmacht, remained no larger than a battalion and was joined by Degrelle himself who increasingly saw the unit as a more important political vehicle than the Rexist Party. It participated in fighting on the Eastern Front from February 1942 but struggled to find sufficient recruits in Belgium to replace its persistently heavy losses. The unit was integrated into the Waffen-SS in June 1943 as the SS-Sturmbrigade Wallonia and was almost destroyed by Soviet forces in the Korsun‚ÄìCherkassy Pocket in February 1944. It expanded slightly after the Allied Liberation of Belgium in September 1944 as Belgian, French, and Spanish collaborators were drafted in and was upgraded to the notional status of a division. After heavy losses and desertions, its remaining personnel surrendered to British forces in April 1945. Background At the time of the German invasion in May 1940, Belgium had several political parties that were broadly sympathetic to the authoritarian and anti-democratic ideals represented by Nazi Germany. In Wallonia and Brussels, the largest of these groups was the Rexist Party, led by L√©on Degrelle. This had originated as a faction of the mainstream Catholic Block, but split in 1935 to form an independent populist party. Ideologically, Rex supported Belgian nationalism, but its support for corporatism and anti- communism made it sympathetic towards aspects of Nazi ideology. It achieved some early success, peaking at the elections of 1936 in which it received 11.5 percent of the national vote. In spite of this, the party experienced a rapid decline in the years before the German invasion and polled below five percent in the 1939 elections and remained marginal. After the Belgian surrender on 28 May 1940, a German Military Administration was created to govern the occupied territory. Preferring a strategy of indirect rule, the administration preferred to work with established Belgian political and social elites, largely ignoring fringe political groups such as the Rexists. Creation of the Walloon Legion, 1941‚Äì42 Belgian nationalist and anti-communist sentiment. The caption reads \\"You defend Belgium... by fighting on the Eastern Front\\". In order to acquire more influence and German support, Rex attempted to bring itself closer to the occupation authorities. On 1 January 1941, Degrelle announced Rex's total support for the occupation authorities and for the policy of collaborationism. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, it embraced the idea of raising a military unit, seen as \\"a political opportunity to increase the importance of their movements and eliminate political competition\\". At the same time, the Flemish National Union (Vlaams Nationaal Verbond, VNV), a Flemish nationalist and rival authoritarian party in Flanders, also announced its intention to form a \\"Flemish Legion\\" to fight in the German Army in the Soviet Union. This move, combined with the Germans' favourable stance towards the VNV, meant that it would not be possible to realise Rex's preferred option of a national \\"Belgian Legion\\" on the Eastern Front. In July 1941, Rex announced that it would raise a unit of volunteers of its own, dubbed the Walloon Legion (L√©gion Wallonie). Unlike comparable Flemish and Dutch units, the Walloon Legion was established within the German Army (Wehrmacht) because Walloons were not considered sufficiently \\"Germanic\\" by Nazi racial theorists be allowed into the Waffen-SS. Recruitment initially met with little success, leading Degrelle personally to volunteer for the unit as a private as a publicity stunt. In total, some 850 men had volunteered by August 1941, bringing the unit up to the strength of a battalion. Officially designated as Infantry Battalion 373 (Infanterie Bataillon 373), it was sent for training in Meseritz in Germany. As part of Degrelle's ideal of an expanded Burgundian-style Belgium, the unit adopted the Cross of Burgundy as its insignia. Most of the Legion's initial volunteers were Rexist cadres and many had been part of the Combat Formations (Formations de Combat) which served as the party's paramilitary wing. In propaganda, Rex emphasised the anti-communist dimension of the German war effort and argued that collaboration was compatible with Belgian patriotism. The unit encountered various internal problems with some volunteers being unwilling to swear personal allegiance to Adolf Hitler and others being classed as medically unfit; almost a third of the volunteers were repatriated before October 1941. Over the winter of 1941‚Äì1942, it participated in training and anti-partisan operations near Donetsk in the Ukraine. Eastern Front =In the Wehrmacht, 1942‚Äì43= The Walloon Legion fought its first engagement against Soviet forces at Gromowaja-Balka, near Donetsk, on 28 February 1942 as part of the 17th Army. It suffered heavy losses, both from disease and combat, and was reduced to 150 men within its first months. It continued to encounter \\"enormous losses\\" throughout 1942. Its record in combat, however, was widely exploited in propaganda and increased Degrelle's legitimacy in the eyes of the German leadership, especially Heinrich Himmler who commanded the SS. In late 1942, Himmler declared the Walloons to be a Germanic race, paving the way for the unit's incorporation into the Waffen-SS on 1 June 1943. The Walloon Legion was re-organised into an brigade-sized unit of 2,000 men, known as the SS- Sturmbrigade Wallonia (SS- Sturmbrigade Wallonien). The high attrition rate within the Walloon Legion required increasing focus on recruitment. A second recruitment drive was started in February 1942, recruiting 450 new volunteers of whom many came from Rex's small youth wing. A third \\"frantic\\" campaign in November 1942 raised a further 1,700 men. These recruitment drives weakened many Rexist institutions by diverting manpower away from projects in Belgium. At the same time, it failed to secure significant numbers of recruits from among the Belgian prisoners of war held in German camps. However, Degrelle became increasingly keen on the political potential of the Walloon Legion which he saw as a more effective political tool than the Rexist Party in Belgium. As the war continued and the pool of Rexist members fell, the volunteers became \\"largely non-political 'adventurers' or desperate men\\", often drawn from the urban working class and the unemployed. =In the Waffen- SS, 1943‚Äì45= L√©on Degrelle, leader of Rex and member of the Walloon Legion, pictured in Charleroi in April 1944. Degrelle saw the Legion as a political tool to gain German support In November 1943, the new SS-Sturmbrigade Wallonia was deployed for the first time to the Ukraine in response to the Soviet Dnieper‚ÄìCarpathian Offensive. There, the brigade fought as part of the SS Wiking Panzer Division in the Korsun‚ÄìCherkassy Pocket in February 1944 and suffered 70 percent casualties. Among those killed was the unit's commander Lucien Lippert. A detachment also fought at the Tannenberg Line in Estonia in June 1944, also suffering heavy losses. Degrelle, however, was widely celebrated for his role in the battle at Cherkassy and received the Knight's Cross, becoming \\"the poster boy for all European collaborators\\" and being featured in Signal magazine. The remnants of the unit returned to Belgium where parades were held in Brussels and Charleroi in April 1944. Ahead of its return, largely to encourage more enlistments, the unit was even loaned armoured vehicles by other German units to make it seem more prestigious. In the aftermath of the Allied Liberation of Belgium in September 1944, Degrelle managed to get the brigade upgraded to division-status, after drafting Rexist refugees fleeing the Allied advance and Walloon volunteers from the paramilitary National Socialist Motor Corps (NSKK). The new 28th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division \\"Wallonia\\" (28. SS-Freiwilligen-Grenadier-Division Wallonien) was created in October 1944. It numbered fewer than 4,000 men, making it considerably understrength, and French and Spanish soldiers from the Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism (LVF) and Blue Legion were folded into the unit to increase its numbers. During the retreat, Walloon soldiers participated in the massacre of 6,000 Jewish female prisoners of Stutthof concentration camp in January 1945. The following month, the remains of the \\"division\\" saw action during Operation Solstice and were forced to retreat through Central Pomerania to Stettin on the Oder river. After mass defections in April its remaining 400 personnel fled to L√ºbeck in Schleswig- Holstein where they surrendered to the British Army to escape capture by Soviet forces. Altogether, between 7,000 and 8,000 men served in the Walloon Legion between 1941 and 1944, slightly less than the number of Flemish who served in comparable formations. Some 1,337 were killed, representing about a fifth of its total strength. However, its maximum field strength had never exceeded 2,000 men. Fearing execution for treason in Belgium, Degrelle escaped to Denmark and Norway and then fled to Francoist Spain where he remained in exile until his death in 1994.

Although resembling an actual cannon, the Quaker gun was simply a wooden log, usually painted black, used to deceive an enemy. Misleading the enemy as to the strength of an emplacement was an effective delaying tactic. The name derives from the Religious Society of Friends or \\"Quakers\\", who have traditionally held a religious opposition to war and violence in the Peace Testimony.  The original \\"Quaker gun trick\\"  During the American War of Independence, after nearly a year of brutal backcountry conflict between American Colonel William Washington and the fierce British commander Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton, Colonel Washington had retreated to North Carolina in October 1780. Ordered to leave a regular force of colonial dragoons in the North Carolina theater by Brigadier General Daniel Morgan, Colonel Washington still lacked the proper artillery to dislodge the Loyalists. On December 4, the Americans were able to trap the Loyalist Colonel Rowland Rugeley and his force of about 125 men in Rugeley‚Äôs house and barn near Camden, South Carolina. Washington told his cavalrymen to dismount and surround the barn. Out of Rugeley‚Äôs sight, Washington‚Äôs men prepared a pine log to resemble a cannon. The \\"Quaker gun trick\\" worked. Colonel Washington aimed the wooden \\"cannon\\" toward the buildings in which the Loyalists had barricaded themselves and threatened to open fire if they did not immediately surrender. Rugeley quickly surrendered his entire force without a single shot having been fired.  Use in Europe  During the Siege of Genoa in 1800, the French force's commander, Andre Massena, placed wooden dummy cannons on the city walls to confuse and divert the besieging Austrian army.  Use during the American Civil War  Quaker guns made of pine logs were mounted in a ruse to fool the Union into believing that the Confederates were much better armed at the Siege of Port Hudson, Louisiana in 1863. Black rings were painted on the end of the logs to make the muzzles look convincing. It worked. After Admiral Farragut's two vessels passed by Port Hudson, the Union chose to never attack from the river again. Quaker guns were used by both the North and South in the American Civil War. The Confederate States Army frequently resorted to them because of its shortage of artillery. The wooden guns were painted black and positioned in fortifications to delay Union assaults. Sometimes actual gun carriages were used in the deception. One notable use of a Quaker gun was by Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston, who placed them in his field works around Centreville, Virginia, in March 1862, to give the appearance that the works were still occupied, while his men were actually withdrawing to the Rappahannock River. Another example happened during the Siege of Corinth. \\"During the night of May 29, the Confederate army moved out. They used the Mobile and Ohio Railroad to carry the sick and wounded, the heavy artillery, and tons of supplies. When a train arrived, the troops cheered as though reinforcements were arriving. They set up dummy Quaker guns along the defensive earthworks. Camp fires were kept burning, and buglers and drummers played. The rest of the men slipped away undetected...\\" Quaker guns were also used to bolster Confederate fortifications during the Siege of Petersburg. They assisted in prolonging the Confederates' hold on their positions against the overwhelmingly superior numbers of Union troops.  Use during World War II  A similar idea was employed during the Doolittle Raid, which occurred in the early stages of the Pacific War of World War II, where Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle led a squadron of B-25 Mitchells to bomb Tokyo. The early model B-25B lacked any protective guns installed in the tail section, leaving them vulnerable to attacks from the rear. While modifying the bombers for the mission at Eglin Field, Florida, Doolittle had fake machine guns consisting of a pair of broomsticks painted black mounted at the tail end of the fuselage to simulate tail guns.I Could Never Be So Lucky Again, by General James H. \\"Jimmy\\" Doolittle, with Carrol V. Glines, p. 228 (Bantum paperback edition, 1991). Similarly, while preparing for the coming invasion of France, the German forces on Pointe du Hoc moved their artillery battery and replaced it with upturned logs and barrels in order to fool the invading Allied forces.The Guns of Pointe du Hoc as Remembered Dummy equipment was also used extensively by the Allies in Operation Fortitude, to persuade the Germans that a non- existent field army was preparing to attack Calais. The pre‚ÄìWorld War I British battleship HMS Centurion was obsolete and disarmed by World War II. However, from 1942 to 1944, she was fitted with wooden guns and stationed in the eastern Mediterranean, to make British naval forces in the area seem stronger than they were. Fake gun emplacements, quickly constructed from local timber, were widely employed in the Soviet Union to fool and mislead German air reconnaissance.  Wooden cannon  Unlike a Quaker gun, a wooden cannon is a functional weapon, albeit notoriously weak and only able to fire a few shots, sometimes even just one shot, before bursting. These were used by those without access to metal or the skill to construct metallic cannons.

It has a seating capacity of 12,000; this was temporarily expanded to 17,000 during 1974‚Äì75, while the Seattle Sounders, of the North American Soccer League, played at Memorial Stadium, before moving to the newly constructed Kingdome. Similarly, an A-League reincarnation of the Sounders franchise played at Memorial Stadium, before moving to Qwest/CenturyLink Field. It currently hosts Seattle School District high school football games and adult recreational leagues, and is the home field for the Seattle Cascades of the American Ultimate Disc League. History The stadium was designed by Seattle architect George W. Stoddard, also known for his work on the Green Lake Aqua Theater and the south stands of Husky Stadium. The stadium opened on September 26, 1947, during a \\"jamboree\\" featuring eight of the city's high school football teams. Memorial Stadium was dedicated later that year in memory of the Seattle youth who gave their lives in World War II. A memorial wall at the east end is inscribed with the names of over 700 fallen individuals. The following year, the stadium hosted first widespread local television broadcast in the Puget Sound region, the Turkey Day high school football game between West Seattle and Wenatchee. The stadium was the venue for much of the opening ceremonies for the Century 21 Exposition, a World's Fair held in Seattle in 1962. In 1967, it became the first high school stadium in the country to install artificial turf. In 1992, the scoreboard was replaced and the field was rededicated as \\"Leon H. Brigham Field\\", in tribute to the long-time high school football coach who pushed to build Memorial Stadium while serving as the Seattle School District's first Director of Athletics. The scoreboard was again replaced in 2018. In 2017, the Seattle School District and the city of Seattle announced plans to build a new high school and stadium at Seattle Center in response to major population growth in downtown Seattle. While no timetable has been set for construction, and no site has yet been chosen, the current Memorial Stadium site was seen as a likely location for the new project because the city and school district had agreed in 2009 that the current stadium should be torn down. In October 2018, a design studio leaked renderings of a soccer-specific stadium on the site of Memorial Stadium that was commissioned for a feasibility study. Tenants The facility is not operated by the Seattle Center itself, but is owned by the Seattle School District and still serves as the \\"home field\\" for some high school football games played within the district. Memorial Stadium also hosted the first AAA (now 4A) state championship game for high school football in 1973, the first year of the state playoff system.State poises for opening of playoffs ‚Äì Spokane Daily Chronicle ‚Äì November 9, 1973 ‚Äì p.15 The top-ranked Wenatchee Panthers were upset by the Kentridge Chargers, 26‚Äì24.

The Seattle Majestics, a women's American football team, played home games at Memorial Stadium from 2007 to 2009 before moving to French Field in nearby Kent. Seattle Reign FC, now known as OL Reign, of the National Women's Soccer League moved to the stadium in 2014 and played with a capacity limited to 6,000 for several seasons. They announced their move to Tacoma in January 2019. As of 2015, the AUDL's Seattle Cascades use the stadium for the majority of their home games. In addition, the stadium hosts adult recreational league soccer and flag football. Memorial Stadium serves as the finish for the Amica Insurance Seattle Marathon.http://www.seattlemarathon.org/amica-insurance-seattle- marathon/#marathon-course-info-maps The stadium is also used periodically for concerts, particularly in connection with festivals held at the Center, like Bumbershoot.Seattle Center, schools reach pact to tear down Memorial Stadium ‚Äì The Seattle ‚Äì November 25, 2009  References  External links *Seattle Center: Memorial Stadium Category:Seattle Sounders (1974‚Äì1983) Category:High school football venues in the United States Category:Sports venues in Seattle Category:Seattle Center Category:Soccer venues in Washington (state) Category:North American Soccer League (1968‚Äì1984) stadiums Category:National Women's Soccer League stadiums Category:OL Reign Category:Seattle Public Schools Category:Ultimate (sport) venues ","title":"Memorial Stadium (Seattle)"},{"id":"1907028","text":"Olivier is the French form of the given name Oliver.

Lyrics Its lyrics vividly tell the tale of a \\"nightmare\\", which was the title of the song when it was first introduced in Floyd's The Man and The Journey Tour shows. The lyrics include a reference to the character Doctor Strange, who was popular at the time due to the psychedelic nature of his adventures. Recording The recording of \\"Cymbaline\\" on the album is different from the one in the film (the latter version is heard on a record player in a bedroom). The vocals are a different take, though both versions are sung by David Gilmour. The lyrics are also different in one place. The song features a sparse arrangement of nylon-string guitar, bass, piano, drums, bongos, and Farfisa organ entering when Gilmour does a scat solo. The Pink Floyd website credits the woodwind parts (tin whistle or flute) to Nick Mason's wife, Lindy Mason. Pink Floyd played \\"Cymbaline\\" from early 1969 until their last show of 1971, and it was the longest-surviving More piece in the band's live shows. It was dropped from their act along with \\"Fat Old Sun\\" and \\"Embryo\\" when they began performing Eclipse: A Piece for Assorted Lunatics, an early version of The Dark Side of the Moon. Live performances When the band performed the song live, they made the following changes to the song: * The pace of the song was slower and more deliberate, creating an even more sombre atmosphere than the studio version. * Richard Wright almost always used Farfisa organ in place of piano (the exception being their performance at KQED studios in San Francisco on April 29, 1970, in which the studio had a piano for Wright to utilize). * David Gilmour played electric guitar and performed a guitar solo over where the scat solo occurred in the song. * In the spring of 1970, the key of the fadeout section was changed from E-minor to B-minor. During this section, Roger Waters would bang a gong instead of bongos as the music faded away. After the B-minor section, the band presented a selection of sound effects such as footsteps and creaking doors, courtesy of the Azimuth Co-ordinator they employed on stage. The effects represented the \\"nightmare\\", which would conclude with the sound of a loud explosion. Thanks to the panning sounds created by the Azimuth Co-ordinator, the sounds would surround the audience and the footsteps would move from left to right through the back of the venue. * By mid-1969/early 1970, the band would follow the instrumental and/or sound effects section with a repeat of the third verse (\\"The lines converging where you stand...\\").

A RecA structural and functional homolog has been found in every species in which one has been seriously sought and serves as an archetype for this class of homologous DNA repair proteins. The homologous protein is called RAD51 in eukaryotes and RadA in archaea. RecA has multiple activities, all related to DNA repair. In the bacterial SOS response, it has a co-protease function in the autocatalytic cleavage of the LexA repressor and the Œª repressor. RecA's association with DNA major is based on its central role in homologous recombination. The RecA protein binds strongly and in long clusters to ssDNA to form a nucleoprotein filament. The protein has more than one DNA binding site, and thus can hold a single strand and double strand together. This feature makes it possible to catalyze a DNA synapsis reaction between a DNA double helix and a complementary region of single-stranded DNA. The RecA- ssDNA filament searches for sequence similarity along the dsDNA. A disordered DNA loop in RecA, Loop 2, contains the residues responsible for DNA homologous recombination. In some bacteria, RecA posttranslational modification via phosphorylation of a serine residue on Loop 2 can interfere with homologous recombination. The search process induces stretching of the DNA duplex, which enhances sequence complementarity recognition (a mechanism termed conformational proofreading). The reaction initiates the exchange of strands between two recombining DNA double helices. After the synapsis event, in the heteroduplex region a process called branch migration begins. In branch migration an unpaired region of one of the single strands displaces a paired region of the other single strand, moving the branch point without changing the total number of base pairs. Spontaneous branch migration can occur, however, as it generally proceeds equally in both directions it is unlikely to complete recombination efficiently. The RecA protein catalyzes unidirectional branch migration and by doing so makes it possible to complete recombination, producing a region of heteroduplex DNA that is thousands of base pairs long. Since it is a DNA-dependent ATPase, RecA contains an additional site for binding and hydrolyzing ATP. RecA associates more tightly with DNA when it has ATP bound than when it has ADP bound. In Escherichia coli, homologous recombination events mediated by RecA can occur during the period after DNA replication when sister loci remain close. RecA can also mediate homology pairing, homologous recombination and DNA break repair between distant sister loci that had segregated to opposite halves of the E. coli cell. E. coli strains deficient in RecA are useful for cloning procedures in molecular biology laboratories. E. coli strains are often genetically modified to contain a mutant recA allele and thereby ensure the stability of extrachromosomal segments of DNA, known as plasmids. In a process called transformation, plasmid DNA is taken up by the bacteria under a variety of conditions. Bacteria containing exogenous plasmids are called \\"transformants\\". Transformants retain the plasmid throughout cell divisions such that it can be recovered and used in other applications. Without functional RecA protein, the exogenous plasmid DNA is left unaltered by the bacteria. Purification of this plasmid from bacterial cultures can then allow high-fidelity PCR amplification of the original plasmid sequence. Potential as a drug target Wigle and Singleton at the University of North Carolina have shown that small molecules interfering with RecA function in the cell may be useful in the creation of new antibiotic drugs. Since many antibiotics lead to DNA damage, and all bacteria rely on RecA to fix this damage, inhibitors of RecA could be used to enhance the toxicity of antibiotics. Additionally the activities of RecA are synonymous with antibiotic resistance development, and inhibitors of RecA may also serve to delay or prevent the appearance of bacterial drug resistance. Role of RecA in natural transformation Based on analysis of the molecular properties of the RecA system, Cox concluded that the data ‚Äúprovide compelling evidence that the primary mission of RecA protein is DNA repair.‚Äù In a further essay on the function of the RecA protein, Cox summarized data demonstrating that ‚ÄúRecA protein evolved as the central component of a recombinational DNA repair system, with the generation of genetic diversity as a sometimes useful byproduct.‚Äù Natural bacterial transformation involves the transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another (ordinarily of the same species) and the integration of the donor DNA into the recipient chromosome by homologous recombination, a process mediated by the RecA protein (see Transformation (genetics)). Transformation, in which RecA plays a central role, depends on expression of numerous additional gene products (e.g. about 40 gene products in Bacillus subtilis) that specifically interact to carry out this process indicating that it is an evolved adaptation for DNA transfer. In B. subtilis the length of the transferred DNA can be as great as a third and up to the size of the whole chromosome. In order for a bacterium to bind, take up and recombine exogenous DNA into its chromosome, it must first enter a special physiological state termed ‚Äúcompetence‚Äù (see Natural competence). Transformation is common in the prokaryotic world, and thus far 67 species are known to be competent for transformation. One of the most well studied transformation systems is that of B. subtilis. In this bacterium, the RecA protein interacts with the incoming single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to form striking filamentous structures. These RecA/ssDNA filaments emanate from the cell pole containing the competence machinery and extend into the cytosol. The RecA/ssDNA filamentous threads are considered to be dynamic nucleofilaments that scan the resident chromosome for regions of homology. This process brings the incoming DNA to the corresponding site in the B. subtilis chromosome where informational exchange occurs. Michod et al. have reviewed evidence that RecA-mediated transformation is an adaptation for homologous recombinational repair of DNA damage in B. subtilis, as well as in several other bacterial species (i.e. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Hemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mutans and Helicobacter pylori). In the case of the pathogenic species that infect humans, it was proposed that RecA-mediated repair of DNA damages may be of substantial benefit when these bacteria are challenged by the oxidative defenses of their host.

There are three types: extensions, themes, and plug-ins. Mozilla hosts them on its official add-on website. In 2017, Mozilla enacted major changes to the application programming interface (API) for extensions in Firefox, replacing the long-standing XUL and XPCOM APIs with the WebExtensions API that is modeled after Google Chrome's API. Thus Firefox extensions are now largely compatible with their Chrome counterparts. At the same time, plug-ins were deprecated, with the exception of the Adobe Flash Player. (However, applications built with the UXP fork of Firefox retain the legacy add-on capabilities.)

E. van Vogt (1912‚Äì2000) and featured in his first published short story \\"Black Destroyer\\" (1939), later incorporated in the novel The Voyage of the Space Beagle (1950). The species' appearance is comparable to a large cat, except in that its forelegs are twice as long as its hind legs, and it possesses tentacles attached to its shoulders that terminate in suction cups. Its skin coloration is not mentioned (except as implied by the title), but was depicted as black in the cover art for its original magazine appearance. It sustains itself by feeding upon a substance it calls the Id of other beings. The species appears indifferent to environment and can survive in different atmospheres. It can manipulate EM radiation (referred to as \\"electric vibrations\\" in the story) at will and seems to communicate via that method. Creation In \\"Black Destroyer\\", a sentient creature that calls itself Coeurl lives on an alien planet. When a human starship arrives, they find a Coeurl but assume it is an unintelligent animal, and even allow it to come on board. The Coeurl realizes it can feed on humans but plays along in order to learn more about them and their ship. Eventually, however, it kills and feeds on one of the ship's crew. The crew suspects the Coeurl did it and tries to prove it by feeding the creature organically bound phosphorus similar to that in the victim's bones, but the Coeurl is smart enough to pass the test. It is later found out and tries to escape, but it is no match for the humans' technology, and in the end commits suicide. When \\"Black Destroyer\\" was incorporated into The Voyage of the Space Beagle, several changes were made in Coeurl's anatomy and physiology‚Äîfor example, Coeurl's tentacles originally ended in tentacled fingers, but were changed in the novel to suction cups, and the dietary chemical was changed from phosphorus to potassium. In the novel, it is theorized that the members of Coeurl's race were pets or servants of the original inhabitants of the planet.  Other appearances  * Coeurl appear as feline enemies in the Final Fantasy series, usually with enlarged tentacle- like whiskers. They are usually associated with the \\"Blaster\\" attack, which causes dangerous status effects at random, usually paralysis or instant death. * The displacer beast in the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game was inspired by the coeurl, being a large feline with shoulder tentacles. * The Dirty Pair have a Coeurl named Mughi as a sidekick. * Coeurls inhabit Mount Zoaka in the MUD Lusternia. * A combat droid used by the lead character in David Gerrold's novel A Season for Slaughter is similarly catlike and vocalises the word \\"Coeurl\\" when it is on standby and awaiting further orders. * Also by David Gerrold in his Star Trek novel The Galactic Whirlpool, the lieutenant Kevin Riley uses holographic creatures as part of a disorientating tactic during a commandeering action, of which the \\"prowlers\\" use the same \\"Coeurl\\" vocalisation. * The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game was able to secure permission for a single use of Van Vogt's original Coeurl in the adventure booklet The End of Eternity. * In the Liar-soft visual novel Sekien no Inganock ~ What a Beautiful People, mutated \\"fantastic humans\\" whose mutations changed their body parts to those of cats are referred to as Coeurl. * In the MMORPG Guild Wars 2, colocals are a type of enemy that resembles a Coeurl and can be found in various zones across the game world. * In the anime Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse, episode 18, there is a moving van with the logo containing a red and yellow coeurl with the words COEURL EXPRESS stamped on the side.

She won the Newbery Medal for one of her books about horses and she was a runner-up for two others. One of the latter, Misty of Chincoteague (1947), was the basis for several sequels and for the 1961 movie Misty. Biography Born to Louis and Anna Breithaupt, the youngest of five children, Henry was a native of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Henry was stricken with rheumatic fever at the age of six, which kept her bedridden until the age of twelve. She was unable to attend school with other children due to her weak condition and the fear of spreading the illness to other people. While confined indoors, she discovered the joy of reading. Henry's love of animals started during her childhood. Soon afterwards, she also discovered a love for writing when her parents presented her with a writing desk for Christmas. Henry later said, \\"At last I had a world of my very own ‚Äì a writing world, and soon it would be populated by all the creatures of my imagination.\\"Marguerite Henry, Dear Readers and Riders, Rand McNally, 1969, p. 200. Henry sold her first story at the age of 11. A magazine had solicited articles about the four seasons from children, and she was paid $12 (now about $250) for \\"Hide-and-Seek in Autumn Leaves\\". She often wrote about animals, such as dogs, cats, birds, foxes, and mules, but chiefly her stories focused on horses. She studied at Milwaukee State Teachers College. On May 5, 1923, she married Sidney Crocker Henry. During their 64 years of marriage they did not have any children, but instead had numerous pets that served as the inspiration for some of Marguerite's stories. They lived in Wayne, Illinois. In 1945, Henry began a 20-year collaboration with artist Wesley Dennis. \\"I had just finished writing Justin Morgan Had a Horse,\\" she recalled, \\"and wanted the best horse artist in the world to illustrate it. So I went to the library, studied the horse books, and immediately fell in love with the work of Will James and Wesley Dennis. When I found out that Will James was dead, I sent my manuscript to Wesley Dennis.\\"Marguerite Henry, Dear Readers and Riders, New York: Rand McNally & Company, 1969, p. 207. Henry and Dennis eventually collaborated on nearly 20 books. Misty of Chincoteague was published in 1947 and was an instant success. In 1961, it was adapted for film, as were Justin Morgan had a Horse (1972) and Brighty of the Grand Canyon (1967). San Domingo, the Medicine Hat Stallion was adapted for television as Peter Lundy and the Medicine Hat Stallion in 1977. Henry's last book was Brown Sunshine of Sawdust Valley, a 93-page novel published in September 1996, when she was 94 years old. Kirkus Reviews called it \\"Vintage Henry ...a lighthearted version of the old girl-meets-horse story; only this time, the horse is a mule.\\"\\"Brown Sunshine of Sawdust Valley\\". Kirkus Reviews.

Legacy Misty features the annual Pony Penning of feral horses from Assateague Island, a two-day round-up, swim, and auction that Henry had been \\"sent to look at\\" by a hopeful editor. She created several Misty sequels including two more children's novels illustrated by Dennis, Sea Star, Orphan of Chincoteague (1949) and Stormy, Misty's Foal (1963). The beneficiaries of \\"Marguerite Henry's Legacy\\", as a Washington Post editorial termed local tourism, were the Assateague nature preserve and Chincoteague town.\\"Marguerite Henry's Legacy\\".

It originally aired December 8, 2004 as part of the series' eighth season. In the episode, local police become convinced that Eric Cartman has psychic abilities, which Cartman exploits for personal gain, much to the ire of Kyle Broflovski, other psychic detectives, and the true serial killer behind a series of murders that Cartman falsely attributes to others. The episode's story continues South Park's critical view of psychics, previously seen in the episode \\"The Biggest Douche in the Universe\\", while also acting as a parody of several films, including Red Dragon, The Gift, and The Dead Zone.Quigles (September 5, 2006). \\"South Park (S8) DVD Review\\". JoBlo.com. Though a minor part of the episode, it marks the last appearance of the seldom-seen South Park Elementary school bus driver Mrs. Veronica Crabtree. Plot Cartman attempts to fly by jumping off of his roof with cardboard wings attached to his arms, to which only Kyle roots for knowing what‚Äôs going to happen while everyone else is against it. He emerges from a brief coma in the hospital, where he shares a room with a victim of a serial killer who cuts off his victims' left hands. When Cartman makes a lucky guess and manages to deduce some obvious routine things, like the food the hospital is serving, a gullible local police detective, Sergeant Yates, believes that Cartman has developed psychic powers. Cartman plays along and is taken to the scene of one of the murders. Where Yates asks him if he is \\"seeing anything\\" Cartman closes his eyes and vocalizes his cravings for ice cream and Oreo cookies, prompting Yates to arrest ice cream shop owner Tom Johannsen with extreme brutality. Cartman receives a cash reward. At school, Kyle angrily confronts Cartman over his fraudulent psychic abilities, but Cartman defiantly insists that he has such powers, and convinces the other frightened school children of this, though not Kyle, Stan, and Kenny. The left-hand murders resume, but instead of realizing his mistake, Yates rationalizes that these are copycat killings. At the next crime scene, the boys meet a disturbed man named Michael Deets who is quite obviously the murderer, but Yates refuses to listen to Kyle's pleas, focusing instead on Cartman's fake visions. Cartman's involvement in the case makes him famous, resulting in a visit from a group of \\"psychic detectives\\" who demand he join their group and pay a fee. Cartman laughs off their pretensions, resulting in a \\"psychic battle\\" in which the \\"detectives\\" indulge in the same histrionics as Cartman, terrifying his mother. Failing to intimidate Cartman, the psychics leave with a threat of class action lawsuit. Cartman solves this problem by telling Sergeant Yates that the group is behind the copycat murders, leading the members of the group to be arrested, beaten, and in one case, fatally shot. Meanwhile, Kyle has followed Deets to his home and obtained fingerprint and blood samples and had them analyzed, but he is completely ignored by the police. Deciding the police will listen to him only if he himself claims psychic powers, Kyle imitates Cartman's attempted flight and is rendered comatose. When he awakens he claims to have psychic powers and gives the police his original findings. Yates is skeptical but goes to investigate Deets anyway, who, by this point, has abducted Cartman, furious that the self-proclaimed psychic has credited his work to others. When Yates arrives, he prepares to arrest Deets upon finding many severed hands pinned to a wall in Deets' home, but stands down upon realizing that the hands on the wall appear to be right hands, not left hands, because the thumb on Yates' own left hand points to the left, cluelessly failing to realize that he is looking at his hand with its palm facing up, in the opposite orientation of those on the wall. Yates, leaves, not knowing that Cartman is bound and gagged in Deets' basement, but he questions his own observation about the hands. He goes back to the station, and after a montage depicting running elaborate criminology tests, exercising, and even losing track of what he was doing, he figures out his mistake, and returns to Deets' house, where he shoots Deets just before Deets kills Cartman who begs Deets not kill him and confesses his sins to him. At the hospital, Johannsen and the psychics have been released from prison, and Kyle is praised as a real psychic. Kyle, however, tells them that there are no psychics, and that there is a logical explanation for every psychic story ever heard. The other \\"psychics\\", however, decide to reignite their conflict with Cartman, and engage in a \\"final battle\\". Kyle becomes annoyed and loudly yells at them to stop, at which point the light bulbs in the room explode and a shelf becomes partially detached from its wall, spilling its contents on the floor. Everyone is surprised by this, but Kyle sheepishly insists there is a logical explanation for this. Critical reception The episode has no critic-derived score at the review aggregator website Metacritic, but it does hold a user rating of 8.9 out of 10, denoting what the site calls \\"universal acclaim\\".\\"South Park: Season 8\\". Metacritic. Retrieved May 9, 2017. In its review of the Season 8 DVD, Quigles of JoBlo.com expressed a positive opinion of the episode, in contrast to its perceived reception by others, stating that he/she \\"laughed pretty much non-stop during it\\", and calling the references to Red Dragon and The Dead Zone \\"hilarious\\". Bill Gibron of DVD Talk thought the episode \\"kind of corny\\", stating that \\"Instead of being a blistering lampoon of The Dead Zone, it sort of falters, looking for an overall purpose\\".Gibron, Bill (August 28, 2006). \\"South Park - The Complete Eighth Season\\". DVD Talk. Jesse Hicks, reviewing the episode for PopMatters, called it a \\"solid\\" one, despite series co-creator Trey Parker's reference to this season as \\"the year from hell\\", due to the grueling work schedule created by producing both the season and the feature film Team America: World Police. Jonathan Barkan of Bloody Disgusting singled out as the best line of the episode Sergeant Yates' observation to Deets: \\"I see you like cutting the eyes out of photos with women.

There were eleven tropical cyclones, seven of which became tropical storms; four of those strengthened into hurricanes, and one reached major hurricane intensity. The season's first cyclone developed on April 4, while the final dissipated on November 21\\\\. The season's most intense and most devastating tropical cyclone was the final storm, known as the Jamaica hurricane. It produced heavy rainfall on Jamaica, leading to at least 100 fatalities and about $1.5 million (1912 USD) in damage. The storm was also blamed for five deaths in Cuba. Other tropical cyclones that left notable impact include the fourth and sixth hurricanes. The former brought rough seas and storm surge to portions of the Gulf Coast of the United States, leaving locally severe damage, particularly in Mobile, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida, totaling about $39,000. One fatality occurred after a barge capsized. The sixth hurricane brought rough seas and heavy precipitation to northeastern Mexico and south Texas, with flooding reported inland. The storm left 15 deaths and about $28,000 in damage. Overall, the tropical cyclones of this season collectively caused at least 122 fatalities and just under $1.6 million in damage. The season's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 57. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs.

Initially, the storm moved slowly southeastward, before turning west-southwestward late on June 8\\\\. Strengthening slightly, the cyclone turned to the northwest by June 11\\\\. Around 12:00 UTC on the following day, a ship observed a barometric pressure of , the lowest known in relation to the storm. Based on this, maximum sustained winds were estimated at 70 mph (110 km/h). Early on June 13, the storm curved northeastward and made landfall near Franklin, Louisiana, around 05:00 UTC. The system slowly weakened and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the Outer Banks of North Carolina, while still at tropical storm intensity. By 12:00 UTC on June 16, the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression. About 24 hours later, the depression dissipated about north of Bermuda. In Louisiana, heavy rainfall resulted in some flooding in inland areas. Precipitation in Georgia and South Carolina caused rivers to approach or reach flood stage, necessitating a flood stage warning at Cheraw, South Carolina, along the Pee Dee River. There, the Pee Dee River crested at , about above flood stage. Some locations in eastern North Carolina reported strong winds, particularly at Fayetteville, where there was a \\"severe local storm\\". =Tropical Storm Two= A ship initially encountered this storm about north-northeast of San Salvador Island in the Bahamas on July 12. The storm initially moved northwestward and strengthened slowly. Early on July 14, the cyclone turned west-northwestward. Later that day, a ship recorded a barometric pressure of , which was the lowest pressure in relation to the cyclone. Around 12:00 UTC on July 15, the system peaked with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h), based on an observation from Savannah, Georgia. About three hours later, the storm made landfall near Darien, Georgia. The cyclone slowly weakened inland and fell to tropical depression status by 12:00 UTC on July 16\\\\. About twenty four hours, it dissipated over Mississippi. Prior to the storm's landfall, northeast storm warnings were issued from Jacksonville, Florida, to Charleston, South Carolina. At Tybee Island in Georgia, strong winds and abnormally high tides were reported. In Savannah, a wind speed of was reported. The storm resulted in minimal damage. =Tropical Storm Three= A tropical depression formed about east-southeast of Ocean City, Maryland, early on September 2\\\\. The depression drifted southward and reached tropical storm intensity later that day. Based on observations from ships on September 3, the cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . The storm then began moving southwestward at a faster pace. Late on September 5, the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression and curved west- southwestward. Shortly after 06:00 UTC on September 6, the system made landfall near Midway, Georgia, with winds of 35 mph (55 km/h). About 12 hours later, the depression dissipated over southwest Georgia. The strongest wind speed associated with the storm was in Charleston, South Carolina. =Hurricane Four= A trough of low pressure in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico developed into a tropical depression about 60 mi (100 km) west- southwest of Cedar Key, Florida, on September 10. Shortly thereafter, the depression intensified into a tropical storm. Moving generally westward, the storm intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on the modern day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale early on September 12\\\\. The cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) at 00:00 UTC on September 13, observed by a ship. Around this time, the hurricane began to curve northwestward. While approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States, the system weakened. At 08:00 UTC on September 14, the hurricane made landfall near Pascagoula, Mississippi, with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). A barometric pressure of was observed at landfall, the lowest known in relation to the cyclone. The system quickly weakened to a tropical storm just four hours after landfall. Early on September 15, the storm weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over Tennessee. In Florida, the precursor to the hurricane brought heavy rainfall to Tampa, with falling there between September 7 and September 10\\\\. Hundreds of homes and numerous acres of agricultural lands were flooded. Throughout the area, many streets were washed out, disrupting street car service and commuting. In Pensacola, abnormally high tides caused severe damage. Wharves and small buildings used for storing fishing equipment washed away. About 20 barges were beached, strewing timber across the beach. Service via the Louisville and Nashville Railroad was briefly interrupted due to timber on a railroad bridge. Wind damage was relatively minor. A dance pavilion on Santa Rosa Island was partially deroofed, as was a hotel. Damage in Pensacola reached approximately $25,000 (1912 USD). In Alabama, the city of Mobile in particular suffered impact from the storm. Some ships and vessels capsized in the Mobile Bay and Mobile River, including a $2,000 barge, drowning a watchman. Winds destroyed a church, though wind damage was otherwise limited to downed street signs and fences. Overall, the hurricane caused $39,000 in damage. =Hurricane Five= In late September, a cold front moved into the Gulf of Mexico. By October 3, a low pressure associated with the front developed. Initially extratropical, the low moved east-northeastward and crossed Florida on October 4\\\\. After entering the Atlantic early on October 5, the low began strengthening and soon reached the equivalency in intensity to a tropical storm. Around 00:00 UTC on October 6, the system transitioned into a tropical cyclone while situated about southeast of Cape Fear in North Carolina. Already a strong tropical storm, the cyclone intensified into a hurricane about six hours later. Late on October 6, a vessel observed a barometric pressure of , the lowest in relation to the stop. Based on this, it is estimated that the hurricane peaked with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). The storm then began to execute a small cyclonic loop, which continued until early on October 8\\\\. By then, the cyclone was moving eastward and weakened to a tropical storm around 00:00 UTC on October 9\\\\. About 24 hours later, the system weakened to a tropical depression. At 18:00 UTC on October 10, the depression dissipated about northeast of Bermuda. Despite remaining well offshore during its tropical cyclone stage, a wind speed of was observed at Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. =Hurricane Six= Observations from ships first indicated the presence of a tropical storm to the southeast of the Cayman Islands on October 11. Moving west-northwestward, the storm strengthened steadily, reaching winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) before making landfall near Canc√∫n, Quintana Roo, early on October 13\\\\. The system weakened slightly over land and while situated in the Gulf of Mexico just north of the Yucat√°n Peninsula, but began re-intensifying later that day. By 12:00 UTC on October 14, the cyclone deepened into a Category 1 hurricane and then a Category 2 hurricane about 24 hours later. The hurricane made landfall on central Padre Island between Corpus Christi and Port Mansfield in Texas late on October 16 with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h), estimated based on a storm surge of . A barometric pressure of was estimated using the pressure-wind relationship. The system quickly weakened to a tropical storm early on October 17, several hours before weakening to a tropical depression. The storm dissipated early on October 18\\\\. Offshore Padre Island, the Mexican streamer SS Nicaragua capsized with a crew of 27. Thirteen people, including the captain, were rescued by personnel from the United States Life-Saving Service station in Port Aransas, though six other crew members were lost. Storm surge and abnormally high tides resulted in severe damage along the coast. Brazos and Padre islands were inundated for several hours, with several buildings being swept away. Considerable damage also occurred in due to strong winds and tides in Brownsville and Port Isabel. At the former, a number of windmills, trees, and poorly constructed buildings suffered some degree of damage. Brownsville and Raymondville broke daily rainfall records, with and observed on October 17, respectively. Many buildings were destroyed and several boats sunk after tides rose in less than 4 hours. Fifteen people died and damage reached more than $28,000 (1912 USD). =Hurricane Seven= The Jamaica Hurricane of 1912 A low pressure area in the southwestern Caribbean Sea developed into a tropical storm by 06:00 UTC on November 11. Initially, the storm moved slowly northwestward, before eventually curving north-northeastward. Late on November 13, the cyclone intensified into a hurricane, based on a ship report. Slow intensification took place after classification as a hurricane, though after recurving toward northeastward, the storm began to quicken in strengthening. Early on November 17, the hurricane reached its maximum sustained wind speed of 115 mph (185 km/h). It continued north-northeastward and made landfall near Negril, Jamaica, around 12:00 UTC. At South Negril Point, a barometric pressure of was observed, the lowest known in relation to the storm. The storm weakened after landfall and the trend continued after reentry into the Caribbean Sea. On November 20, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm north of Jamaica. The system then westward across the Caribbean, before dissipating on November 22 about southwest of Grand Cayman. Heavy rainfall was reported in Jamaica. Several bridges were severely damaged in the northern and eastern portions of the island. Strong winds generated by the storm destroyed approximately 25% of banana trees, while telegraph lines were downed in a number of places. Railway lines were also heavily damaged by the winds and rain. Rough seas also lashed the island, with Savanna-la-Mar suffering near complete destruction and 42 deaths in that city alone. Across western Jamaica, roughly a hundred homes were destroyed, while 5,000 buildings were damaged or demolished. About 100 fatalities and $1.5 million in damage occurred in Jamaica. Extensive flooding and five fatalities occurred in Cuba in the Guant√°namo Bay area. =Other systems= In addition to the seven tropical storms, four tropical depressions developed and remained below tropical storm intensity. The first formed from an extratropical cyclone well to the southwest of the Azores on April 4\\\\. The depression moved southwestward until being by a frontal boundary on April 6\\\\. By September 25, another tropical depression developed from a formerly extratropical cyclone about halfway between Bermuda and the Azores. However, on September 27, the depression lost tropical characteristics again. The next tropical depression formed on October 17 to the southeast of Bermuda. Moving generally northwestward, the depression transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by October 21\\\\. The final non- developing depression formed from an extratropical cyclone to the west of the Canary Islands on November 7\\\\. The depression tracked generally westward before being absorbed by a frontal system on November 11.

He is responsible for more than 700 mazes in 42 countries since 1979. Fisher has created 63 mirror mazes, and pioneered the extensive use of thematic chambers within mirror mazes, to achieve Mirror Maze Adventures. He has created 44 hedge mazes, and pioneered the use of Folly Towers, Tunnels, Walk-through Parting Waterfalls and Foaming Fountain Gates in mazes. He designed the world's first cornfield maize maze in 1993 and over 400 since, and has set 7 Guinness World Records. He has created water mazes, most notably the award- winning Beatles Maze (with Randoll Coate and Graham Burgess), and the Jersey Water Maze. He pioneered the genre of Path-in-Grass Mazes, and has created over a dozen around the world. Fisher has invented several brick paving and mosaic tiling systems. For the Orang Utan Pavement Maze at Edinburgh Zoo, he invented a new paver tessellation using 7-sided and 5-sided (regular pentagon) bricks. The 'Fisher Paver', his second paving system uses 7-sided and 4-sided bricks and has been installed within paving projects on both sides of the Atlantic. Its benefits include being able to achieve dynamic and intriguing designs straight off the pallet with no cutting, thus offering excellent labour productivity when laying; it only requires one new 7-sided paver shape, yet its modular scale matches all industry-standard paving systems. Adrian's third paving system is the Mitre System, which he invented and patented together with the American mathematician Ed Pegg. Used for both mosaics and paving, their distinctive angular shapes create unique and pleasing images. Notable examples of its use in England include four Historic Mosaics with the Millennium Maze in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, and the 24 ft high SciTec Mosaic at Oundle School, Northamptonshire; and in America, the Tree of Life Mosaic in a private garden in Roxbury, Connecticut. His innovative Colour Mazes have been published in Scientific American, and walk-on examples can be found in the New York Hall of Science, Eureka Children's Museum in Halifax England, The Exploratory in Bristol, Cape Coral Children's Science Center in Florida, and over 30 other locations worldwide. He designed the innovative Star Map concept for London Buses, upon which was based the Spider Map system currently in use by London Buses. Fisher designs puzzles for British newspapers and the World Puzzle Championships. The Guardian newspaper named him as one of Britain's top 50 designers. He has written over a dozen books on mazes and puzzles, in particular The Art of the Maze (Orion Books, 1990), Secrets of the Maze (Thames & Hudson) and The Amazing Book of Mazes (Thames & Hudson, 2006). A major Maze Art Exhibition on Adrian Fisher's work was held at the Norton Museum of Art, West Palm Beach, Florida, from January to March 1997; it included the creation of full-size permanent mazes in the surrounding landscape, and the publication \\"Your Land is His Canvas\\". Fisher was Director of Britain's \\"1991 ‚Äì The Year of the Maze\\" Tourism Campaign. He was the recipient of the 2003 Resorgimento Award at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, USA, on May 24, 2003, \\"in recognition of those who have demonstrated outstanding creativity, who have and will continue to change the world in which we live\\". He gave a TEDx talk in Cape May, New Jersey, USA, on the subject of \\"The Pursuit of Happiness\\". He was a judge of the 2009 International Labyrinth Competition in St Petersburg, Russia. He and his wife Marie live in the village of Durweston in North Dorset, and within their grounds have a yew hedge maze with a central Folly Tower, mirrored chamber, spiral staircase and battlement walkway. Fisher was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2020 Birthday Honours for services to international trade and the creative industry.

It is one of 13 member community colleges operated by the Tennessee Board of Regents. The Hardin Valley Campus is in western Knox County, west of the city of Knoxville, Tennessee. There are four satellite campuses in the surrounding area. Pellissippi State was named Pellissippi State Technical Community College until July 1, 2009. It is the successor to the former State Technical Institute at Knoxville (\\"STIK\\"), founded in 1974. Campus Pellissippi State Community College operates five campuses, as of Spring 2015, spread across the Knox County and Blount County area, including: *Hardin Valley Campus in Western Knox County *Division Street Campus in downtown Knoxville, Tennessee *Magnolia Avenue Campus east of downtown Knoxville, Tennessee *Blount County Campus in Friendsville, Tennessee *Strawberry Plains Campus in Strawberry Plains, Tennessee History The precursor to Pellissippi State, State Technical Institute at Knoxville, was established on September 4, 1974. The original school was added on as a wing to the Knoxville State Regional Vocational-Technical School and intended to simply provide post-educational vocational training to area residents. However, at the backing of the newly seated director Colonel John C. Mauer, the Tennessee State Board of Vocational Education soon took over governance of the school, providing three associate's degree programs in engineering technology to 45 students on the first day of classes, September 23, 1974. STIK received its initial accreditation from the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) in 1977, under the leadership of the first school president, Dr. Wayne Jones, and six years later, on July 1, 1983, STIK became a member of the State University and Community College System of Tennessee, thereby transferring governance of the school to the Tennessee Board of Regents. In 1986 the campus was moved to its current location, on a plot in west Knox County near the Pellissippi Parkway. Initially, STIK shared the campus with Roane State Community College. In 1988, however, the school's mission was broadened to include that of a technical community college, adding numerous university-parallel associate degree programs, changing its name to Pellissippi State Technical Community College, and absorbing the space occupied by Roane State.College history , Roane State Community College website (accessed February 29, 2008) A hot air balloon festival was held at the campus from 2004 to 2011. =Origin of name= Pellissippi (also spelled \\"Pelisipi\\") appears on early maps as the name of the Clinch River.

Technique Although there are many variations of the basic body position it essentially involves the skydiver moving out of the traditional face-to-earth & arched position, and straightening the legs, bringing the arms to the sides and de-arching, using the body to cup the air as a means of providing greater lift. There is debate over what exactly constitutes the most efficient tracking position (providing the best glide ratio) especially concerning how far (if at all) the skydiver's legs should be spread. Some variations of the tracking position work well for some individuals and not so well for others. Also, when a skydiver gains experience, his or her preferred body position often changes. Glide ratio Good trackers can cover nearly as much ground as the distance they fall, approaching a glide ratio of 1:1. The fall rate of a skydiver in an efficient track is significantly lower than that of one falling in a traditional face- to-earth position; the former reaching speeds as low as 90 mph, the latter averaging around the 120 mph mark. Practices Tracking is regarded as an essential life saving skill for all freefall skydivers engaging in relative work with others, allowing the jumpers to gain horizontal separation after building a formation and before opening their parachutes. Accordingly, the greater the number of skydivers on a jump, the better their tracking skills must be. In addition to having to track a longer distance after break-off (tracking away for separation before opening), they also have to be more aware of other jumpers around them and have to be able to track in a straight line away from the center of the formation. Tracking is not however purely a life saving skill; many skydivers participate in ‚Äòtracking dives‚Äô where the whole skydive until break-off will be spent tracking. On all tracking dives there should be a designated leader, usually the most proficient tracker, who will plan the horizontal trajectory of the dive. This serves several purposes; first of all, the other trackers will have a target to chase, gauge their relative horizontal speed on and potentially take grips upon. While considered an area of freeflying, tracking dives are popular amongst many skydivers across the disciplines. Tracking dives are some of the most accessible and sociable dives that everyone regardless of experience level can take part in. Tracking dives are often planned at the end of the day, and with less emphasis on quantitative results (formation skydiving), or on holding difficult and new body positions (freeflying). They are commonly viewed as the most relaxing, low pressure jumps. Atmonauti dives, a.k.a. \\"Angled flight\\", are a recently conceived variant with a significantly different body position, giving a far steeper flight angle between traditional track and head down. Tracking and Atmonauti dives are considered by most skydivers (wingsuiting notwithstanding) to go the furthest towards the feeling of ‚Äòtrue flight‚Äô due to the large horizontal distances covered, the low terminal velocity, and the fact that at such heights the ground does not appear to be approaching at all.ASM Australian Skydiver Magazine 'Atmonauti Explained' On October 5, 2012, the Swiss Marc Hauser set a first world record in speed tracking, a discipline he founded.Marc Hauser's 'Speed Tracking' website The measured ground speed was 188.9 mph (304 km/h) over the dropzone of Skydive Empuriabrava, Spain. Only a specially adapted skydiving suit was used (no wingsuit, tracking suit, nor additional weights were used).*\\"A specially-developed suit made for this speed flight will support Marc in using his body perfectly and release maximum power.\\" by Tom Naef, Skydiving Professional, Speed Tracking.com, retrieved February 25, 2014 Safety Even though inexperienced jumpers often take part on tracking dives, the risks of such dives should not be underestimated. An efficient track can reach horizontal speeds of nearly 100 mph (one experienced diver was witnessed to keep pace with a twin-engine plane as it took off from DeLand Municipal Airport in 1995 thus registering his speed in excess of 115mph). Collisions with other groups or with members of one's own group would result in serious injury or death. For this reason the number of inexperienced jumpers on a tracking dive should be limited by the organizer.

Pequod and her crew, commanded by Captain Ahab, are central to the story, which, after the initial chapters, takes place almost entirely aboard the ship during a three-year whaling expedition in the Atlantic, Indian and South Pacific oceans. Most of the characters in the novel are part of Pequods crew, including the narrator Ishmael. Ishmael encounters the ship after he arrives in Nantucket and learns of three ships that are about to leave on three-year cruises. Tasked by his new friend, the Polynesian harpooner Queequeg (or more precisely, Queequeg's idol-god, Yojo), to make the selection for them both, Ishmael, a self- described \\"green hand at whaling,\\" goes to the Straight Wharf and chooses the Pequod. It is revealed that Pequod was named for the Algonquian-speaking Pequot tribe of Native Americans, decimated and scattered in the early 1600s by the Pequot War and by the epidemic that preceded it. The Mashantucket (Western Pequot tribe) and Eastern Pequot tribe still inhabit their reservation in Connecticut. Description Pequod has endured the years and the elements, but not without sustaining damage. The ship has a quarterdeck and a forecastle and is three-masted like most Nantucket whalers of the time, but all three masts are replacements, taken on when the originals were lost in a typhoon off Japan. Pequod is not unlike Ahab in this respect, since many of the rest of these missing elements have been replaced by the bones of the whales she hunts. She is not a new vessel, and with age would usually come some veneration and respect, which Ishmael tries to convey by using several historical references in his description of her. But in Pequods case this has been negated by the thick veneer of barbarity that has been overlaid onto the ship in the form of fantastic scrimshaw embellishment. Far from enjoying mere utilitarian replacements out of available whalebone, she has been ornately decorated, even to the whale teeth set into the railing that now resemble an open jaw. Like a fingerbone necklace on a cannibal, these adornments are clear evidence of Pequods success as a hunter and killer of whales. The principal owners of the vessel are two well-to-do Quaker retired whaling captains, therefore \\"the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole management of the ship's affairs to these two.\\" Peleg served as first mate under Ahab on Pequod before obtaining his own command, and is responsible for all her whalebone embellishments. The depiction of life aboard the ship was based on Melville's own experiences in whaling (specifically aboard the Acushnet in the 1840s) and thus can be taken in many ways as representative of mid-19th-century Nantucket whaling.

The show was created and produced by Irwin Allen. Land of the Giants was the fourth of Allen's science fiction TV series. The show was aired on ABC and released by 20th Century Fox Television. The series was filmed entirely in color and ran for 51 episodes. The show starred Gary Conway and special guest star Kurt Kasznar. Five novels based on the television series, including three written by acclaimed science fiction author Murray Leinster, were published in 1968 and 1969. Show premise The travelers are trapped in a giant zoo. Set fifteen years in the then-future year 1983, the series tells the tale of the crew and passengers of a sub-orbital transport ship named Spindrift. In the pilot episode, the Spindrift is en route from Los Angeles to London, on an ultra fast sub-orbital flight. Just beyond Earth's boundary with space, the Spindrift encounters a magnetic space storm, and is dragged through a space warp to a mysterious planet where everything is twelve times larger than on Earth, whose inhabitants the Earthlings nickname \\"the Giants\\". The Spindrift crash-lands, and the damage renders it inoperable. Very little is known about the home planet of the Giants. This is partially because the Spindrift crew very seldom leave the area where their spaceship crashed in the opening episode. Only two other (unidentified) giant societies are ever seen, in the episodes \\"The Land of the Lost\\" and \\"The Secret City of Limbo\\". No name is ever established for the mysterious planet, but the inhabitants know of Earth, Venus, and Mars, referring to them by name in one episode. Exactly where the planet is located is also never made clear. In the episode \\"On a Clear Night You Can See Earth\\", Captain Steve Burton (Gary Conway) claims to have seen Earth through a set of infrared goggles invented by the giants, implying that the two planets are near enough to see one from the other. The only established method by which Earth people may reach the giants' planet is high-altitude flight, passing through what one giant calls a \\"dimension lock\\". Although various episodes establish that at least six other flights have landed on the planet, no episode confirms anyone ever returning to Earth. The first mention of other visitors from Earth was in episode 2, \\"Ghost Town\\", in which another ship was said to have crashed long ago without any survivors. In episode 4, \\"Underground\\", another Earth ship is described as crashing three years previously, again with no survivors. Several episodes show crews surviving their initial crashes, only to be killed later. The episode \\"Brainwash\\" has a crew of little people surviving long enough to build a radio station that can communicate with Earth. They are killed shortly after that. The episodes \\"Golden Cage\\" and \\"The Lost Ones\\" show there have been a few survivors of other crashes. Only the Spindrift crew seems to have survived for long with its party intact. One continent, or hemisphere, is dominated by an authoritarian government which tolerates full freedoms within a capitalist system, but it does not tolerate any effort to effect political change. Exactly what the political situation is on other continents is not known, although at least one overseas land has a despotic ruler. The Air Traffic Control tells those who venture out to sea that they should turn back, that nothing beyond that sea has been explored nor is there current contact; whether this is an official government line or the truth is not known. Culturally, the Giant society closely resembles the contemporary United States of 1968 (in various episodes it has a police force, private hospitals, prisons, a State Governor, radio and television services, a zoo, jazz clubs, even a racetrack ‚Äì and the Giants speak English, drive American cars, attend Vaudeville-style theatres, and play chess). The Earth people find themselves able to cope, and their efforts to get around are facilitated by the ubiquity of large drains leading directly from interior rooms to the pavement, in an outside wall of most buildings. The Giant government has offered a reward for the capture of the small Earth people (whom the Giants call the little people). In spite of the authoritarianism, there are several dissident movements at work that either help other dissenters (such as the Earth people) or are actively working to unseat the ruling party. The government has established the Special Investigations Department (SID) to deal with assorted dissidents but it also takes the lead in dealing with the Earth people. The Giant technology mostly resembles mid-20th century Earth, but inconsistently: significantly more advanced in some episodes (e.g. cloning, cybernetics, force fields, magnetic stunners, androids, and teleporters) and slightly behind in others (no microelectronics, hearing aids, or manned space flight). The little people's objectives are: (1) survival, by obtaining food and avoiding capture by the Giants or attacks from animals, such as cats and dogs; and (2) repair of their spacecraft, so they can attempt to return to Earth. They largely manage to survive by the help of sympathizers and stealth, making the most of their small size, plus their ingenuity in using their technology where it's superior to that of the Giants. They do not achieve the second objective, as the primary systems of the craft are severely damaged, although in some episodes (including \\"The Flight Plan\\") Burton implies that only a lack of fuel prevents the ship lifting off. The secondary systems are insufficient to enable them to achieve the sub-orbital flight required. They are unable to use Giant technology, as it is bulky and less advanced; in one episode an experimental nuclear reactor, provided by an engineering student, produces dangerous side effects and is prone to overloading. They also cannot trust the Giants, who in another episode (\\"Target: Earth\\") offer the little people a ride home in exchange for technical assistance with their space program, but then double-cross them. They are aided in their first objective, and at least somewhat hindered in the second, by the leadership of Captain Burton. He behaves as a leader and as protector to the passengers and crew, and his leadership has rescued them from some difficulties. But Burton also tries to keep the Giants from ever reaching Earth. In the episode \\"Brainwash\\", Giant police officer Ashim (Warren Stevens) says \\"Maybe we can find the home planet of these little people. It may be a very tiny world, but rich beyond our dreams.\\" In several episodes, Burton puts keeping the Giants away from Earth above the need to get his people home. At the end of those episodes, he destroys devices that would get the Spindrift back to Earth but which would probably enable the Giants to journey there too. In multiple episodes, the Giants capture one of the passengers or crew, and the rest have to rescue them. The Earth people avoid capture most of the time, because their spaceship is hidden in a wood (in several episodes, described by the Giants as a park) outside the city limits. They also occasionally form alliances with individual Giants for some common beneficial purpose. The show had no proper conclusion about the humans' attempts to return to Earth, and the final episode, \\"Graveyard of Fools\\", was a universal tale that could have taken place anytime in the second season. The penultimate episode, \\"Wild Journey\\" (guest starring Bruce Dern), has Steve and Dan using alien technology to travel back in time to Earth just a few hours before their ill-fated flight. In a storyline lifted from the Lost in Space episode \\"The Time Merchant\\", they attempt to alter the timeline but only succeed in ensuring that the events of the first episode, \\"The Crash\\", take place (footage from the pilot, where Spindrift becomes lost, is included in this episode), creating a Twilight Zone-style twist ending, with the impression of a recurring cycle of inevitable events. The first season comprised a regular 26 episodes, but season two was left one episode short. The show thus comprises only 51 episodes (or 52 episodes including the unaired pilot). Production The show was created by Irwin Allen. With a budget of US$250,000 per episode, Land of the Giants set a new record. The actors had to be physically fit, as they had to do many stunts, such as climbing giant curbs, phone cords, and ropes. Don Marshall, who played the part of Dan Ericson, credited his previous football, track, and pole vaulting work for helping him with the stunts required.Actor Database Interview with Don Marshall Elements of Allen's Lost in Space series recur in Land of the Giants, notably the relationship between foolish, greedy, on-the-run bank robber Alexander B. Fitzhugh (Kurt Kasznar) and the young boy Barry Lockridge (Stefan Arngrim), paralleling the relationship on Lost in Space between Doctor Smith and the young Will Robinson. Also, for main cast billing, Kasznar was treated contractually in the same manner as Jonathan Harris had been on Lost in Space: billed in last place on the opening credit sequence, but billed as Special Guest Star (even though he was a series regular). Apart from this, Gary Conway received solo star billing in the opening credits, with the other regulars all receiving also starring billing. The show was originally intended to premiere as a mid-season replacement in the spring of 1968, and the first 12 episodes were shot in the fall of 1967. This was changed and Giants premiered in September 1968 for a full season. The network screened the episodes in a significantly different order than the production sequence. This caused disconcerting lapses in continuity, since in the first 12 episodes filmed (but not in later episodes) the Giants moved slowly and hardly spoke. For example, \\"Ghost Town\\" was the 14th episode filmed (i.e. was not one of the original 12 episodes), but was the second episode aired. Large hand in a scene from the second season, which featured Stefan Arngrim as Barry Lockridge. The cost of production was immense, partly because of the special optical effects needed to matte the little people into shots also showing the giants; and partly because of the gigantic mechanical props needed, for the little people to interact with, in shots depicting the giant-sized world they find themselves in; plus the futuristic spacecraft sets that were needed to represent the Spindrift. Because of the enormous cost, it was more efficient and cost-effective to film episodes in pairs using the same sets; so writers were informed about what giant-size props there were available, which they could incorporate into their storylines. These episodes were filmed back-to- back. To save on production costs, Allen was not above using the same device he had employed on The Time Tunnel: re-using stock footage from 20th Century Fox's film library. For instance, in the episode Collector's Item, footage of Wayne Manor from Batman is recycled as the luxury mansion home of a rich giant. In the unaired pilot of The Crash, there is no end scene with the giant dog in the garbage dump. Once it had been confirmed that Land of the Giants had been picked up by the network, the pilot was reworked and production began on succeeding episodes. However, a break in production occurred after 12 episodes were in the can (enough for a short run as a mid-season replacement), until the show received the green light on the decision to launch it as a full season the following fall.

Episodes Music Like Allen's previous series Lost in Space and The Time Tunnel, the theme music was composed by John Williams. As with Lost in Space, Williams composed two different themes (in this case one for each season). Williams also scored the pilot episode \\"The Crash\\", and was the third composer to be attached to the project ‚Äì Williams' work replaced a rejected score and theme by Alexander Courage; Joseph Mullendore composed a second theme that was also thrown out.Jon Burlingame, pg. 115, TV's Biggest Hits: The Story of Television Themes From \\"Dragnet\\" To \\"Friends\\", Schirmer Books, 1996, Mullendore later scored five episodes and Courage did one, with other episodes scored by Richard LaSalle (seven episodes), Leith Stevens (five), Harry Geller (four), Irving Gertz, Paul Sawtell, and Robert Prince (one each). =Soundtrack= GNP Crescendo released an album as part of The Fantasy Worlds Of Irwin Allen, featuring both themes, Williams' replacement score (tracks 2‚Äì6) and Courage's thrown-out score (tracks 9 and 10) for \\"The Crash\\". # Land Of The Giants Main Title ‚Äì Season 1 (1:02) # Off Course/The Landing/Dense Fog (6:01) # Giant Eyes/Hidden Gun/The Big Cat/Bug Box (8:45) # Fitzhugh's Gun/Hiding Place (6:57) # Giants Probing/The Rescue (3:35) (note: most copies are actually missing most of Giants Probing) # Water Drain/More Garbage (2:44) # Land Of The Giants End Title ‚Äì Season 1 (:31) # Land Of The Giants Main Title ‚Äì Season 2 (1:01) # Space Storm/Through The Thing/Crash Landing/Giant Ford (6:08) # The Sniveling Sneak (6:45) # Land Of The Giants End Title ‚Äì Season 2 (:30) Home media All 51 episodes were released on DVD in Region 1 in a limited-edition 9-disc Complete Series on July 24, 2007 from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.

Season 1 was released on March 28, 2011 and season 2 on June 13, 2011. They also released a complete series set on March 12, 2012. In Region 4, Madman Entertainment released season 1 on DVD in Australia on August 20, 2014. They released season 2 on November 12, 2014. Merchandise and licensing The pilot episode was the subject of a View-Master reel and booklet set in 1968 (GAF Packet # B494). One notable difference between the aired episode and the reel set is an image of the Spindrift flying through the giant forest in apparent daylight. In the aired episode, the Spindrift arrives on the giants' planet during the night, and its flight through the forest also occurs that same night. Though the following is unconfirmed, either the daylight shot was a special effects sequence cut from the aired pilot, or a special setup for the View Master photographers. In 1968, Pyramid Books published an extended novel adaptation of the pilot (Land of the Giants, Pyramid Books, X-1846), written by famed author Murray Leinster. Among notable changes or inventions is that the Spindrift is still an operational, flying ship after the initial crash, with enough \\"atomic power\\" to last as much as several months. Another invention for the novel is the knowledge that two other ships, the Anne and Marintha, disappeared via the same mysterious phenomenon that sends the Spindrift to the giants' planet. The Spindrift castaways encounter a female survivor of the Anne, named Marjorie, who joins the castaways in this novel. Although the television series featured three episodes with other on-screen survivors from previously lost Earth-flights, the novel's character Marjorie and the ships Anne and Marintha do not appear and are not mentioned in the series. There were two further novels by Murray Leinster ‚Äî The Hot Spot and Unknown Danger (Pyramid, 1969). The first two Leinster books were reprinted in 1969 in the United Kingdom by World Distributors, the eponymous novel retitled The Trap. Unknown Danger was not published in the UK, but World Distributors also published two United Kingdom-only novels the same year, Slingshot for a David and The Mean City; both were credited to James Bradwell, a pseudonym for Arthur William Charles Kent. A hardback novel for children, Flight of Fear by Carl Henry Rathjen (1969), was published in the United States by Whitman. Also in 1968, Gold Key Comics published a comic book version of Land of the Giants, which ran to five issues. In 2010, all five issues were reprinted together as a hardcover book by Hermes Press. In 1968, Aurora Plastics Corporation produced two plastic model kits based on the series: Land of the Giants was the title of a diorama depicting a giant snake attacking characters Steve Burton, Betty Hamilton and Dan Erickson, who uses a giant safety-pin as a spear. The second kit was a model of the Spindrift, released as Land of the Giants Space Ship, instead of using the proper name for the vehicle. In 1975, Aurora re-issued the kit (now renamed Rocket Transport Spindrift), with new box art and photos of the assembled kit. It had a front top section which could be lifted off, revealing a full interior that had to be constructed by the builder, as well as a working door. Most of the model kit was molded in the same bright red-orange as the ship itself, while the interior was molded in a light green which could be painted. In 1969, Aladdin Industries released a metal, embossed lunch box based on the series. The artist, Elmer Lenhardt, used his own likeness for a giant scientist taunting the little people. A reproduction of the lunch box was later released by Fab Gear USA in a limited edition of 5000. Deanna Lund (Valerie Scott) co-wrote a series of short stories based on the series, under the collective title \\"Valerie in Giant Land\\". MeTV began airing Land of the Giants in September 2016 to complement its Saturday night sci-fi line-up of other Irwin Allen series: Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, Lost in Space, and The Time Tunnel. Prior to debuting on MeTV, Land of the Giants had aired only sporadically in syndication in recent years. The Horror Channel in the UK aired the series in full from September 19, 2016, showing one episode a day on weekdays, for ten weeks.

Early life Tong was born on April 7, 1960 in Hong Kong, and was educated in Hong Kong and Canada. Film career Encouraged by his brother-in-law in Hong Kong, who was a filmmaker, Tong started his film career there in 1979 by working behind the scenes. In 1991, Tong directed his first film, the self-funded The Stone Age Warriors (È≠îÂüüÈ£ûÈæô). The film received high praises from some famous film critics, which attracted the attention of Golden Harvest. Tong was then invited to join the company as a film director. Tong is very well known for his action movies. Working closely with Jackie Chan, Stanley directed some very popular movies in the 1990s. Their first collaboration, Police Story 3: Super Cop (Ë≠¶ÂØüÊïÖ‰∫ã3ÔºöË∂ÖÁ∫ßË≠¶ÂØü) (1992), broke box office records in many Asian countries and received a nomination for Best Film at the Golden Horse Awards. Tong's other movies with Jackie Chan, such as Rumble in the Bronx (Á∫¢Áï™Âå∫) (1995) and Police Story 4: First Strike (Ë≠¶ÂØüÊïÖ‰∫ã4ÔºöÁÆÄÂçï‰ªªÂä°) (1996), also created significant box office records, the latter grossing HK$57,518,795, the highest box office return for a local film in Hong Kong until 2001. Also, the release of Rumble in the Bronx in the United States helped Jackie Chan make a name for himself in Hollywood. Tong customarily attempts stunts himself before asking actors to risk themselves, e.g., Jackie Chan's leap from a parking garage roof to a fire escape in Rumble in the Bronx and the finale of The Stone Age Warriors. During his stay in Hollywood, Tong also filmed his only English language non-martial arts film Mr. Magoo (1997), which was a critical and commercial failure, and Martial Law (1998), which was a moderate ratings success. In 2000, Tong returned to Shanghai, in hopes to inspire the future generation of filmmakers in China. After his long presence away from home, Tong directed his first film in his homeland, China Strike Force (Èõ∑ÈúÜÊàòË≠¶). In 2005, Tong wrote and directed the film The Myth (Á•ûËØù). In the same year, Tong also wrote and directed Asia's first computer-animated film, Dragon Blood. In recent years, Tong has produced a number of films, including the films The Myth (2010) and CZ12 (ÂçÅ‰∫åÁîüËÇñ) (2012), as well as the TV series Fall in Love with You (ÂÅèÂÅèÁà±‰∏ä‰Ω†) (2012) and The Patriot Yue Fei (Á≤æÂø†Â≤≥È£û) (2013). Apart from filmmaking, Tong has been active with charity work both in USA and China. He also works as a guest lecturer in China to help cultivate the nation's future filmmakers.

Many of his films are partly financed by the company. In addition, the company has invested in a stunt performers‚Äô training program. Both local and foreign lecturers who are well known in the industry have been invited to give lessons for the program, and the best students receive opportunities to play in films invested by Tong‚Äôs company. Other work In 2012, Tong was invited by The 15th Shanghai International Film Festival's SIFFORUM as a guest speaker. At the forum titled \\"Far East Dream Factory - Future for Chinese Film Industry Upgrading,\\" Tong shared his views with other panelists in the industry. In 2011, Tong took the role of Honored Consultant for the Film and TV Association of China Public Security Ministry. The Association is established to produce films and TV series featuring crime stories. In 2008, Tong appeared as a guest judge on the China Beijing TV Station reality television series The Disciple, which aired in Mainland China and was produced by, and features, Jackie Chan. The purpose of the program was to find a new star, skilled in acting and martial arts, to become Chan's \\"successor\\", the champion being awarded the lead role in a film. It concluded on June 7, 2008, with the series winner being announced in Beijing. Philanthropy Stanley Tong has organized many charitable activities and has received numerous awards for his contributions to the charity work. Some of them include: * \\"Charity Hero\\" medal for organizing Hong Kong Yan Chai Hospital fundraising activities * The President of Fundraising Activities for the Elderly in San Francisco, USA * The Fundraising Ambassador of the Los Angeles branch of the Eastern China Flood Fundraising Committee * The Fundraising President of the Hong Kong Disabled Youth Association and the Hong Kong Blind People Association * Organized fundraising activities for the victims of China's Sichuan earthquake References External links Interview At FarEastFilms.com Category:Hong Kong film directors Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Action choreographers ","title":"Stanley Tong"},{"id":"1907221","text":"Patten Gymnasium is the name of two multi-purpose gymnasiums (one past and one present) in Evanston, Illinois, United States, on the campus of Northwestern University.

It is the capital of Najran Province. Designated a new town, Najran is one of the fastest-growing cities in the kingdom; its population has risen from 47,500 in 1974 and 90,983 in 1992 to 246,880 in 2004 and 500,000 in 2017. The population mostly originates from the ancient tribes of YƒÅm, M√°kram, and Hamdan. Najranis are Muslims, with Shia, Ismaili forming the plurality of the religious adherents. Hanbali, Shafi'i, and Maliki Sunnis form the second largest religious group in the city, while the Zaydi Shia form the smallest religious group. The Arabic term ' has at least two meanings: both the wooden frame on which a door opens and also 'thirsty'. Local tradition also has it that the land derived its name from the first man to settle in the area, Najran ibn Zaydan ibn Saba ibn Yahjub ibn Yarub ibn Qahtan. Najran was the Yemeni centre of cloth making and originally, the kiswah or the cloth of the Ka'aba was made there (the clothing of the Kaba first started by the Yemeni kings of Saba). There used to be a Jewish community at Najran, renowned for the garments they manufactured. According to Yemenite Jewish tradition, the Jews of Najran traced their origin to the Ten Tribes. Najran was also an important stopping place on the Incense Route. History Najran Museum Entrance The history of NajrƒÅn can be traced back to 4,000 years ago. It was once occupied by the Romans; in fact it was the first Yemeni city to fall to the Romans on their way to the Yemeni kingdom of Saba'. NajrƒÅn's most prosperous trading time was during the 1st and 2nd centuries BC. In ancient times it was known as Al-Ukhd≈´d. =Early history= Similarly to other ancient place names in Arabia, NajrƒÅn may have originally been the name of the whole oasis including all towns and villages. The old name of the ruins now known as \\"al-Ukhd≈´d\\", which may have been the central town, was probably Ragmat. NajrƒÅn was a focal point of the Incense Route. All routes that left ancient Yemen to the north or west had to meet at NajrƒÅn, where the routes branched into two general directions, the ones leading north through the ·∏§ijƒÅz towards Egypt and the Levant and those leading to the northeast towards Gerrha near the Persian Gulf.Description in A. F. L. Beeston \\"Some Observations on Greek and Latin Data Relating to South Arabia\\" in Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 42, No. 1 (1979), pp. 7‚Äì12; online at JSTOR NajrƒÅn was conquered around 685 BC by the Sabean Mukarrib (King) Karib'il Watar I King of Yemen. The later Sabean king Yithi'amar Bayin destroyed RagHmat around 510 BC. NajrƒÅn seems to have been under Minaean or Sabean rule at different times during the next centuries and after that it was part of Yemen till 1937. The Roman prefect of Egypt Aelius Gallus led an costly, arduous and ultimately unsuccessful expedition to conquer Arabia Felix and won a battle near NajrƒÅn in 25 BC. He occupied the city and used it as a base from which to attack the Sabaean capital at Ma'rib. According to Strabo,Strabo, Book XVI, Chapter 4, 22‚Äì24 The Geography of Strabo, published in Vol. VII of the Loeb Classical Library edition, 1932; online at Lacus Curtius who called it 'Negrana', NajrƒÅn was at this time the northernmost city of the realm of Saba'. When the ·∏§imyarites conquered the Sabeans in AD 280 they probably also took control of NajrƒÅn. Some time during the 3rd century the people of NajrƒÅn sided with the Abyssinians who sent a governor named Sqlmqlm\\" in inscriptions. The ·∏§imyar King Ilsharah Yahdib crushed this rebellion. The north Arabian Lakhmid king Imru‚Äô al-Qays ibn 'Amqu attacked NajrƒÅn in AD 328. Under the influence of Axum, the Christians in NajrƒÅn thrived and started an alliance with Aksum again at the beginning of the 6th century. =Early Christian community= Christianity must have been introduced into NajrƒÅn, as in the rest of South Arabia, in the 5th century AD or perhaps a century earlier. According to the Arab Muslim historian Ibn Is·∏•ƒÅq, Najran was the first place where Christianity took root in South Arabia. According to the contemporary sources, after seizing the throne of the ·∏§imyarites, in ca. 518 or 523 Dh≈´ NuwƒÅs, a Jewish king,http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/historians-back-bbc-over-jewish- massacre-claim attacked the Aksumite (mainly Christian) garrison at Zafar, capturing them and burning their churches. He then moved against NajrƒÅn, a Christian and Aksumite stronghold. After accepting the city's capitulation, he massacred those inhabitants who would not renounce Christianity. Estimates of the death toll from this event range up to 20,000 in some sources; a surviving letter (where he is called Dimnon) written by Simon, the bishop of Beth Arsham in 524 AD, recounts Dh≈´ NuwƒÅs's persecution in NajrƒÅn (modern al-Ukhd≈´d in Saudi Arabia).Simon's letter is part of Part III of The Chronicle of Zuqnin, translated by Amir Harrack (Toronto: Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, 1999), pp. 78-84. The persecution is apparently described and condemned in the Qur'an (al-Buruj:4). Under the reign of the Caliph ‚ÄòUmar, the Christian community of NajrƒÅn was deported to Mesopotamia, on the grounds that no non- Muslims were to live in the Arabian Peninsula.Hitti, Phillip. History of the Arabs from the Earliest time to the Present. New York: Macmillan, 1951. p. 61 The town of NajrƒÅn was already an important centre of arms manufacture during the lifetime of Muhammad. However, it was more famous for leather rather than iron. =Former Jewish community= Rabbi Salomon Halevi (Last Rabbi of Madras Synagogue) and his wife Rebecca Cohen(Najran Jew), Paradesi Jews of Madras NajrƒÅn had a Jewish community dating back to pre-Islamic times, historically affiliated with the Bnei Chorath who were Yemenite Jews that had conquered the city and ruled until the Christian invasion of Yemen.Gilbert, Martin, \\"In Ishmael's House\\", 2000, (p. 5) With the Saudi conquest of NajrƒÅn in 1934, persecution increased, and some 200 Jews of NajrƒÅn fled south to Aden between September and October 1949. The Saudi King  ªAbd al- ªAziz demanded their return, but the Yemeni king A·∏•mad bin Ya·∏•y√° refused, because these refugees were Yemenite Jews. After settling in the ·∏§ashid Camp (also called Mahane Geula) they were airlifted to Israel as part of the larger Operation Magic Carpet.Gilbert, Martin, \\"In Ishmael's House\\", 2000, (p. 271) Some groups of Najran Jews escaped to Cochin, as they had very good relationship with the rulers of Cochin and maintained trade connections with Paradesi Jews.http://www.madrasmusings.com/vol-27-no-20/the-last-family-of-pardesi- jews-in-madras/ =Najran as part of Saudi Arabia= NajrƒÅn joined the newly announced Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1934 as a result of the efforts and struggles of Sheikhs Sultan Bin Muneef and JƒÅbir Ab≈´ SƒÅq, the leaders of two large clans of the Yam tribe. Starting in 1924, the forces of the former Yemeni king launched several unsuccessful raids to annex NajrƒÅn to the Yemeni Kingdom. The king of Yemen performed some new maneuvers to strengthen his tie with some of the NajrƒÅn tribal leaders to counter the strong relations of the people of NajrƒÅn with Bin Sa ª≈´d. Then in 1932 the forces of Imam Ya·∏•y√° of Yemen attacked NajrƒÅn with more than 50,000 troops, with all kinds of new weapons. YƒÅm, as the dominant tribe in NajrƒÅn, along with some other loyalist Najranis, started strong resistance against the occupation forces. However, a strong segment of the tribal leaders in NajrƒÅn sided with the occupying power and some became passive, waiting to take a side at the end of the crisis. Sheikhs Sultan Bin Muneef and JƒÅbir Ab≈´ SƒÅq, the head of two clans of YƒÅm at the time, managed to get quick support from King  ªAbd al- ªAzƒ´z Bin Sa ª≈´d and was able to lead the YƒÅm tribe and all of the NajrƒÅnƒ´ resistance fighting the Yemeni forces in all parts of NajrƒÅn and BilƒÅd YƒÅm. Later, in the spring of 1934, the army of Bin Sa ªud under the command of Prince Sa ª≈´d son of  ªAbd al-  ªAzƒ´z carried out a massive campaign, surrounding NajrƒÅn from the north and northwest, and defeated the Yemeni army. NajrƒÅn became part of Saudi Arabia. In short, Najran has always been independent and ruled by its people (Yam) but they choose to be annexed to New Kingdom. Indeed, there was a strong treaty between King  ªAbd al- ªAzƒ´z and the people from NajrƒÅn indicating conditions to be respected by both sides. =Issues with the Ismaili community= The Ismailis, a religious and ethnic minority with historic roots in NajrƒÅn Province of southwestern Saudi Arabia, face increasing threats to their identity as a result of official discrimination. With the arrival of Mish ªal bin Su ª≈´d as the governor of NajrƒÅn in 1996, tension between local authorities and the Ismaili population increased, culminating in a confrontation between armed IsmƒÅ ªƒ´lƒ´ demonstrators and police and army units outside the Holiday Inn hotel in NajrƒÅn city on April 2000. Official discrimination in Saudi Arabia against IsmƒÅ ªƒ´lƒ´s encompasses government employment, religious practices, and the justice system. Government officials exclude IsmƒÅ ªƒ´lƒ´s from decision making, and publicly disparage their faith. The confrontation at the Holiday Inn in NajrƒÅn city on April 23, 2000, marked a watershed in IsmƒÅ ªƒ´lƒ´ relations with the central government. Three months earlier, police had closed all IsmƒÅ ªƒ´lƒ´ mosques on a religious holiday. On April 23, after security forces and religious morality police arrested an IsmƒÅ ªƒ´lƒ´ cleric, a large demonstration took place outside the Holiday Inn, where governor Mish ªal resided. After the governor refused for hours to meet the petitioners, an exchange of fire between security forces and armed demonstrators left two IsmƒÅ ªƒ´lƒ´s dead and, according to some government accounts, killed one policeman as well. Believing their religious identity to be under attack, IsmƒÅ ªili men erected defenses around Khushaywah, the seat of the IsmƒÅ ªƒ´lƒ´ religious leader, al-DƒÅ ºi ª al-Mu·π≠laq (Absolute Guide), and the spiritual capital of SulaymƒÅnƒ´ IsmƒÅ ªƒ´lƒ´s, a community with followers in India and Pakistan as well as Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Khushaywah, which is an area of NajrƒÅn city, includes the Man·π£≈´rah Mosque complex. The army surrounded the IsmƒÅ ªƒ´lƒ´ positions and placed the city under its control. The standoff ended later the same day without further bloodshed. Archaeological ruins and artifacts Traditional house in Najran NajrƒÅn city is famous for its archeological significance. Old NajrƒÅn was surrounded by a circular wall, 220 by 230 meters, built of square stone with defensive balconies. It contained several unique buildings. There is also a cemetery south of the external wall. Excavations of this site have uncovered glass, metals, pottery, and bronze artifacts. Square and rectangular buildings have also been found. At Al-Ukhd≈´d which is south of NajrƒÅn city, carvings from those days and human bones can be seen. A museum displays, among other items, a bronze lion head. NajrƒÅn's landmarks include the \\"Rass\\" stone, a 2-meter-high granite stone.The Incense Road: Najran Geography = Topography= Najran enjoys three different geographic landscapes, and they are: the oases, mountains, and desert on its east side. =Climate= The climate for Najran is a hot desert climate type, typical of the Arabian Peninsula. The rainfall is very sporadic in occurrence and consists of light individual rainfalls. The yearly average high temperatures are lower than Riyadh, despite being further south, due to Najran's elevation. Education =Colleges and universities= Najran is home of Najran University and Najran College of Technology.

It is one of the three public high schools in West Vancouver. The school has two campuses, a North Campus and a South Campus. Each campus has its own gym and a cafeteria. The school has 2 grass fields and a gravel baseball diamond. The main field has a running track around it. The main field is used for all sports, such as soccer, football, and rugby union.  History  West Vancouver Secondary was founded as Inglewood High School in 1927, located at 1735 Inglewood Avenue. The school opened with eight classrooms and a gymnasium. Further expansion over the years added extra classrooms and library facilities. Four more rooms were eventually added to the eastern end of the school to house home economics and shop classes.http://archives.westvancouver.ca/destinationstimewalk/routes/hollyburn/sites/hol_wvss.html In 1951 construction started on a new North Campus building on Mathers Avenue and by 1952 it opened as West Vancouver Secondary School. A few years later, in 1955, the building was expanded with a three-floor west wing, and in 1960 a second gymnasium was built. A further expansion added a 500-seat theatre and two music rooms in the east wing. This was followed, with some provincial funding, by a six-room shop wing referred to as the Tech Wing and located behind the north campus building. A new South Campus building was added next to the original Inglewood building to accommodate more students as the municipality grew.http://archives.westvancouver.ca/destinationstimewalk/routes/hollyburn/sites/hol_wvss.html The Inglewood building continued to be used for many years as a junior high school until all classes were moved to the main site on Mathers. By the late 1980s the building was used as a YMCA and the Kehilat Har-el (a Jewish Community Centre) until it was demolished in 1995.http://archives.westvancouver.ca/destinationstimewalk/routes/hollyburn/sites/hol_inglewoodHighSchool.html In the mid 1990s, the school went through a major renovation which included a remodelling of the exterior and interior parts of the North Campus Building. During this time period, classes were temporarily moved to portables until the completion in the 2000s. Notable changes included a third gymnasium, the relocation of the library and the administration office, a new cafeteria, redesigned classrooms and hallways, and a new west wing. The renovations ended in 2005 when the school's new east wing and new auditorium, The Kay Meek Centre, were inaugurated.  The Kay Meek Centre for the Performing Arts  In 2004, the $12 million CAD performing arts centre was built in the emplacement the school's old theatre. The Kay Meek Centre for the Performing Arts was the vision of West Vancouver resident Kay Meek who died in 2004. The centre features a main theatre with seating for 490 as well as a flexible black box studio theatre with seating up to 216 . The studio theatre was finished in February 2006. The first show in the theatre by WVSS was a very small show while the main theatre was still under construction. Kay's health was going downhill and so they created a small show just for her. The Kay Meek Centre hosts performances from The Vancouver Recital Society, Early Music Vancouver, and The Arts Club Theatre Company as well as local community organizations like Theatre West Vancouver and Theatre K.  International Baccalaureate program  WVSS is a member of the International Baccalaureate (IB) program. It is one of the three public schools on the North Shore to provide the High School program (the others being Carson Graham Secondary Schoolhttp://balmoralsecondary.ca/ and √âcole Andr√© Piolat, both located in North Vancouver). It offers a variety of IB courses, such as Biology, Chemistry, English, Film, French, Geography, History, Japanese, Mandarin, Mathematics, Physics, Spanish, Theatre, and Visual Arts. The standard Diploma programme course, Theory of Knowledge, is required in this program. WVSS is the only public high school in the West Vancouver School District to offer the IBO Diploma programme; however, Mulgrave School also offers the IBO Diploma. The other three secondary schools in the district, Rockridge, Sentinel and Collingwood, the latter being a private school, offer the Advanced Placement (AP) Program.  West Vancouver athletics  WVSS is home to up to 42 different sports, depending on how many students for each team.

It was the first album she released under the name of Wendy Carlos rather than Walter Carlos. Switched-On Brandenburgs is a collection of all six of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos performed by Carlos on her Moog modular synthesizer. Concerti #1, (most of) #2, and #6 were recorded specifically for the album. Concerti #3, #4, and #5 had been previously released on Switched-On Bach, The Well-Tempered Synthesizer, and Switched-On Bach II respectively (though the second movement of #3 was re-recorded for this release). The first movement of the Second Concerto had been recorded for the album By Request, released in 1975, however an updated mix is on this album.

He was known as el Caballero de los Mares (Spanish for \\"Gentleman of the Seas\\") for his kind and chivalrous treatment of defeated enemies and is esteemed by both Peruvians and Chileans. He is an iconic figure for the Peruvian Navy, and one of the most famous merchant marine and naval military leaders of the Americas. Early life Miguel Grau was born in Paita on 27 July 1834 in the house of Dr. Alexander Diamont Newel with the assistance of the midwife Tadea Castillo, also known as \\"The Morito,\\" both prominent figures in Paita. His father was Juan Manuel Grau y Berr√≠o, a Colombian who came to Peru with Bolivar in the fight for independence from Spain. Later, Juan bought property in Paita and worked at the Customs Office. His mother, Luisa Seminario y del Castillo, motivated Grau to love the sea from his youth. He entered the Paita Nautical School. He first went to sea when he was nine years old, going to Colombia, aboard a merchant schooner. The schooner sank in front of Gorgona Island and he later returned to Paita. However, he did not get discouraged and embarked again the following year. Grau later went on various merchant ships to ports in Oceania, Asia, America and Europe. These voyages gave Grau the seagoing experience that was the foundation for his brilliant career as a nautical officer and the beginning of a love story with Carla Ortiz (unidentified French women). Early career In 1853, at the age of 19, he left the merchant marine and became an officer candidate of the Peruvian Navy, where he developed an outstanding professional reputation. In 1854, he was Military officer of the steamer Rimac. His career was rapid and brilliant. In 1863, he was promoted a year later. In 1864, he was sent to Europe to oversee the construction of ships for the Peruvian fleet. He would be put in prison a year later, with a group of fellow officers for rejecting the idea of hiring a foreigner as supreme commander of the Peruvian navy, but was later released after a trial in which they were declared not guilty as their cause was proven worthy. Among these ships was the ironclad 'Hu√°scar', launched in 1865 by Laird at Birkenhead. Upon his return, Chile and Peru joined together in a bi- national fleet against Spanish attempts to reclaim their American colonies. In 1868, he was recalled to the Navy and was named commander of the 'Hu√°scar' with the rank of Lieutenant Commander and was later promoted to commander. By June 1, 1874, he became the commanding officer of the Peruvian Navy's fleet as Captain, and later became a member of the Congress of the Republic of Peru as an elected congressman in 1876 representing Paita. To this day his seat is preserved in congress and his name is called at the beginning of each session, being responded \\"present\\" to by all congressmen. War of the Pacific The Peruvian warship Huascar. When the War of the Pacific between Chile against Bolivia and Peru began on 5 April 1879, Miguel Grau was aboard the 'Hu√°scar', as its captain and the Commander of the Navy. In an impressive display of naval mastery, Capit√°n Grau played an important role by interdicting Chilean lines of communication and supply, damaging, capturing or destroying several enemy vessels, and bombarding port installations. Grau's Hu√°scar became famed for moving stealthily, striking by surprise and then disappearing. These actions put off a Chilean invasion by sea for six months, and as a result he was promoted to rear admiral by the government in Lima - the first Peruvian to be promoted to flag officer rank in many years. =The Gentleman of the Seas= Battle of Iquique At the Battle of Iquique, after Hu√°scar sank the Chilean corvette Esmeralda by ramming her, Grau ordered the rescue of the surviving crew from the waters. Grau also wrote condolences to the widow of his opponent Arturo Prat, returning his sword and personal effects. Letter to Carmela Carvajal de Prat (Prat's widow) :Dear Madam: :I have a sacred duty that authorizes me to write you, despite knowing that this letter will deepen your profound pain, by reminding you of recent battles. :During the naval combat that took place in the waters of Iquique, between the Chilean and Peruvian ships, on the 21st day of the last month, your worthy and valiant husband Captain Mr. Arturo Prat, Commander of the Esmeralda, was, like you would not ignore any longer, victim of his reckless valor in defense and glory of his country‚Äôs flag. :While sincerely deploring this unfortunate event and sharing your sorrow, I comply with the sad duty of sending you some of his belongings, invaluable for you, which I list at the end of this letter. Undoubtedly, they will serve of small consolation in the middle of your misfortune, and I have hurried in remitting them to you. :Reiterating my feelings of condolence, I take the opportunity of offering you my services, considerations and respects and I render myself at your disposal. : (Signed) Cpt. Miguel Grau At the port of Antofagasta, after sneaking up on an enemy ship the Matias Cousi√±o, he courteously asked the crew to abandon ship before opening fire. As her captain Castleton was abandoning the ship, the Chileans' capital ships Blanco Encalada and Almirante Cochrane showed up, forcing Grau to abandon his prey and, after seriously disabling the Matias Cousi√±o, to escape by passing in between the Chilean ironclads rendering them in an unfavourable position to pursue. These and other gestures earned him the nickname of El Caballero de los Mares (\\"Gentleman of the Seas\\") from his Chilean opponents, acknowledging an extraordinary sense of chivalry and his gentlemanly behaviour, combined with his highly efficient and brave combat career. Grau was also a determining factor in capturing the steamer Rimac. Rimac was being chased by the wooden corvette Union under command of Garcia y Garcia. When Huascar appeared and fired her twin cannons, Rimac quickly lowered her flag. The cavalry regiment Carabineros de Yungay, including its commander, was captured with the ship. This was a major blow for the Chilean Government, and the Commander of the Chilean Navy resigned his position. =Death at Battle of Angamos= Almirante Grau was killed by an armor- piercing shell fired by the ironclad Almirante Cochrane in a four against one duel during the Naval Battle of Angamos on 8 October 1879. Hu√°scar was captured by the Chileans after suffering severe casualties in the close-range artillery duel. Although most of Grau's body was not recovered, his remains, which were buried with military honours in Chile, were returned to Peru in 1958. For many years after his death, his name was called in a ceremonial roll-call of the Peruvian Navy, and the Peruvian congress continues to do so. His final resting place lies at the Escuela Militar Naval del Peru, in El Callao in an underground mausoleum. He posthumously received the rank of Gran Almirante del Per√∫ (Grand Admiral of Peru) in 1967 by order of the Peruvian Congress. A portrait of Almirante Grau is on display in the museum ship Hu√°scar. Legacy Bust of Almirante Grau Seminario in Lake Forest Park, Washington, USA In the year 2000, Miguel Grau was recognized as the \\"Peruvian of the Millennium\\" by popular vote. In December 2019, a bust of Grau was donated by the Peruvian Navy to Wirral, England in tribute to the historic naval links between Peru and Birkenhead. Birkenhead is home to the Cammell Laird shipyard that built the Hu√°scar and the bust is displayed in Birkenhead Town Hall. A metro station in Lima is named after him.

Founded by Isaac Kaufmann Funk in 1890, it eventually merged with two similar weekly magazines, Public Opinion and Current Opinion. History Beginning with early issues, the emphasis was on opinion articles and an analysis of news events. Established as a weekly newsmagazine, it offered condensations of articles from American, Canadian and European publications. Type-only covers gave way to illustrated covers during the early 1900s. After Isaac Funk's death in 1912, Robert Joseph Cuddihy became the editor. In the 1920s, the covers carried full-color reproductions of famous paintings. By 1927, The Literary Digest climbed to a circulation of over one million. Covers of the final issues displayed various photographic and photo-montage techniques. In 1938, it merged with the Review of Reviews, only to fail soon after. Its subscriber list was bought by Time. A column in The Digest, known as \\"The Lexicographer's Easy Chair\\", was produced by Frank Horace Vizetelly. Ewing Galloway as assistant editor at the publication. Presidential poll The Literary Digest is best-remembered today for the circumstances surrounding its demise. From 1916, it conducted a poll regarding the likely outcome of the quadrennial presidential election. Prior to the 1936 election, the poll had always correctly predicted the winner. In 1936, the poll concluded that the Republican candidate, Governor Alfred Landon of Kansas, was likely to be the overwhelming winner.Straw Vote Fight Arouses Interest The Pittsburgh Press; November 2, 1936 In November, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt won 46 states, while Landon only won Maine and Vermont; Roosevelt also won the popular vote by over 24%. The magnitude of the magazine's error (19.54% in the popular vote for Roosevelt v Landon) destroyed the magazine's credibility, and it folded within 18 months of the election. In hindsight, the polling techniques employed by the magazine were faulty. Although it had polled ten million individuals (of whom 2.27 million responded, an astronomical total for any opinion poll),Freedman, et al.: 335-336 it had surveyed its own readers first, a group with disposable incomes well above the national average of the time (shown in part by their ability to afford a magazine subscription during the depths of the Great Depression), and two other readily available lists, those of registered automobile owners and that of telephone users, both of which were also wealthier than the average American at the time. Research published in 1972 and 1988 concluded that as expected this sampling bias was a factor, but non-response bias was the primary source of the error - that is, people who disliked Roosevelt had strong feelings and were more willing to take the time to mail back a response. George Gallup's American Institute of Public Opinion achieved national recognition by correctly predicting the result of the 1936 election, while Gallup also correctly predicted the (quite different) results of the Literary Digest poll to within 1.1%, using a much smaller sample size of just 50,000. Gallup's final poll before the election also predicted Roosevelt would receive 56% of the popular vote: the official tally gave Roosevelt 60.8%. This debacle led to a considerable refinement of public opinion polling techniques, and later came to be regarded as ushering in the era of modern scientific public opinion research.

Biography  The band was formed in Washington D.C. around the scene of the 9:30 club. In 1989, the band relocated to New York City. The name of their first album, Hello, Betty! comes from the standard opening for all their appearances. In 1995, the band expanded by adding Tony Salvatore on lead guitar and drums to the initial line-up of vocals with electronic accompaniment, bass and cello. Betty appeared in every episode of the 1989 HBO series Encyclopedia, singing educational songs each centered on a particular word, as well as performing the opening and closing theme songs. The members involved were Alyson Palmer, Amy Ziff, and Elizabeth Ziff, although they were credited in the show's opening titles as simply \\"Betty\\". In 2002 the group starred in its own off-Broadway show Betty Rules directed by Rent's Michael Greif. The musical ran for nine months at the Zipper Theatre. The show has since been performed in Chicago at the Lakeside Theatre and sold-out three runs at Theater J in Washington, DC. Betty has appeared as a regular guest artist on the television show The L Word, for which they provided the theme song. Activist entertainers, Betty is as well known for their performances at rallies for causes in which they believe (including equality and rights for women and girls) as they are for their seven television theme songs, film appearances and commercial jingles.

They were indicted in 1957. Their case was never tried and both Zlatovskis denied the accusations. Early life Jane Foster grew up in San Francisco, California. Her father, Harry Emerson Foster, was the medical director of the Cutter Laboratories. Her mother was Eve Cody Foster. Foster attended Mills College in Oakland, California, graduating in 1935. Foster married Dutch diplomat Alleendert Kamper in October 1936. She and Kamper separated after 18 months. Foster, required to spend five months on Dutch soil in order to finalize the divorce, travelled to Bali. She remained there until September 1939, returning to the United States due to the British declaration of war on Germany. She briefly joined the Communist Party in 1938. Foster met and married Zlatovski in Washington, D.C. in 1943, then remarried him three years later. She was employed by the Board of Economic Warfare and the Office of Strategic Services from late 1943 until early 1946 in the Indonesian section. Foster was one of the first OSS agents to reach Indonesia after the Japanese surrender in 1945, where she interviewed Sukarno to discover whether he planned to align himself with Allied interests. Foster wrote in her autobiography that Soviet agent Charles Flato was one of her closest friends at the Board. Allegations of espionage Foster was allegedly recruited into espionage in 1938 by NKVD operative Martha Dodd. In 1942, Foster rented a room from Henry Collins in Washington, D.C., who likewise was active in the secret apparatus. After World War II, Foster and her husband allegedly became members of a Soviet espionage ring run by Jack Soble. She is believed to be identified in Soviet intelligence and in the Venona project files with the code name SLANG, where she is mentioned as engaged in transmitting information and in other espionage tasks. According to Gregg Herken, SLANG is named in two cables decrypted in the Venona project, one dated 21 June 1943, the other dated 30 May 1944. The Zlatovskis were indicted by a Federal grand jury on July 8, 1957, on charges of espionage. The couple were living in Paris at the time, and denied the charges in a brief interview with the New York Times. Time Magazine sensationally alleged in 1957 the Zlatovskis became part of the Soble network in January 1940. At times they dealt directly with Soble, while on other occasions they are thought to have worked with Boris Morros. According to Morros, Jane and George Zlatovski were useful espionage agents and served a crucial role in the Soble spy network. As reported in Time, \\"[I]n covert meetings in the U.S. and a dozen European cities (including Moscow) the Zlatovskis turned over to Morros a file-load of valuable information that was passed to Soviet intelligence.\\" George Zlatovski (alleged code name RECTOR) was not as active as his wife, gathering mostly information on refugees for Soviet intelligence. As a team, the two allegedly collected information on the \\"sexual and drinking habits\\" of U.S. personnel stationed in Austria, apparently for blackmail recruitment of new agents for espionage activity. After revelations of the Soble network appeared in the press in 1957, both Jane and George Zlatovski denied Morros' allegations. They remained in exile in Paris, where Foster reconnected with Julia Child and her husband, Paul, both of whom had worked with Foster in the OSS. Although the U.S. government tried to extradite the Zlatovskis, it was unable to do so. Although she continued to publicly deny her involvement in espionage, it has been reported Foster confessed to both French intelligence agents and to the Paris office of the FBI. Her autobiography, An Un-American Lady, is a colorful account of an upper-class expatriate socialite in the pre- and post-World War II era, and also recounts her involuntary detainment in the U.S., surveillance by FBI and CIA agents, and description of McCarthy-era America.

These APIs were originally designed to provide a common text handling system to support text entry fields in dialog boxes and other simple text editing within the Macintosh GUI. Over time, they were extended to provide more advanced text editing features, but its limited original scope led to fundamental limitations. Apple repeatedly stated that TextEdit was not a word processor, and therefore providing rich text editing was always left to third-party developers. Basic limitations of TextEdit include: * only provides support for 8-bit character sets * 16-bit internal indexing limits text to a maximum length of about 32,000 characters * use of QuickDraw for glyph rendering limited the maximum height of a text block to 32,767 pixels - this could be encountered well before the character limit was hit with larger font sizes. The first incarnation of TextEdit provided support for only a single style of text, which was applied to all text in the block. This was more than adequate for its intended use, supporting text entry fields. Later, support was added for styled text so that TextEdit could be used for more complex text editing tasks, such as text editing areas in web browsers, etc. TextEdit remains part of the Carbon API on macOS, but has been superseded by numerous other solutions including ATSUI in Carbon, the third party WASTE text engine, as well as NSText and related classes within Cocoa.

Backers described the proposal as necessary to assist the U.S. Border Patrol's enforcement of federal immigration laws. However, opponents pointed out that the proposed state immigration police force would not be limited to the international border area, but rather have a much broader charge of enforcing federal immigration laws throughout the state. Since federal immigration law enforcement has traditionally been the exclusive province of the federal government, there is considerable dispute regarding the constitutionality of civil immigration law enforcement by state and local authorities. The measure was sure to have faced legal challenges if approved by voters in California. Before proponents failed to get it on the state ballot, the measure faltered in the Assembly Judiciary Committee of the California State Legislature when first introduced by Assembly Member Ray Haynes (R-Murrieta). They then introduced it as an initiative proposal and had until December 12, 2005 to collect approximately 600,000 valid signatures of registered California voters in order to qualify the measure for the ballot. Proponents of the measure projected annual costs of up to $300 million for the new law enforcement department. The proposal did not make a funding allocation, but did authorize the Governor to use emergency powers to reallocate funding appropriated for other purposes in the annual state budget. It also called on the state to seek federal reimbursement for costs to the state in enforcing federal immigration laws. To date, the federal administration has not indicated whether or not it supports the aims of this proposal, or whether a federal appropriation would have been made if the measure was approved by California voters. Proponents of the measure argued that the initiative was necessary to address the rate of illegal immigration to California and its strain on state resources. The Pew Hispanic Center estimates 10,400,000 illegal immigrants reside in the United States, and somewhere between 2 and 3 million are estimated to live and work in California. Opponents of the proposal said that the state immigration police force would disrupt and interfere with the jurisdictions of local police departments around the state. They argued that the initiative would therefore undermine the ability of local police departments to protect the public if immigrant communities, especially domestic violence victims, fear reporting crimes because of potential immigration law consequences. They also argued that a state immigration police force would invite racial profiling. The chairman of the \\"California Border Police Committee,\\" the official entity responsible for raising funds and making expenditures on behalf of the proposed initiative, was Assembly Member Haynes. The predecessor to the committee is Rescue California, the leading signature-gathering group for the 2003 California Recall of former Governor Gray Davis.

He was drafted by the Oakland Raiders in the third round of the 2005 NFL Draft after playing college football at Arizona State University. He was also a member of the New England Patriots. Early years and college career Walter is an Arizona native, born in Scottsdale. He moved to Colorado at the age of 10, where he later attended Grand Junction High School in Grand Junction, Colorado. He was an all-conference selection as a junior and senior and a USA Today honorable mention All-American. Prior to his NFL career, Walter played quarterback for his hometown school, Arizona State University (ASU) where he earned a BA in Communication. Walter completed his collegiate career with numerous Pacific-10 Conference records including, most career touchdowns (85) and most yards passing in a game (536). He also set numerous school records, which include most passing yards (10,616), most completions (777), most touchdowns (85), and total offense (10,142). =2001 season= Walter's redshirt freshman season at Arizona State University saw limited playing time behind sophomore starter Jeff Krohn, including reserve duty in a losing effort against the University of Oregon. After a 4‚Äì7 record under new head coach Dirk Koetter and only one win in the Pacific-10 Conference, Krohn transferred out of ASU following the season. =2002 season= With an opening at quarterback, Walter seemed to be the favorite going into the season to start. This turned out not to be the case, however, when Walter was kept as the backup after redshirt freshman, Chad Christiansen, had impressive spring and fall practices. In September 2002 the Sun Devils fell behind the San Diego State University Aztecs 22-0. Christiansen was largely ineffective and was replaced by Walter. Walter entered the game with a protective boot due to an injury he sustained during the previous week of practice. The injury did not prove to be a factor as Walter connected with wide receiver Shaun McDonald for a 72-yard touchdown pass on his first play from scrimmage. Walter's second pass from scrimmage also ended up as a touchdown. ASU came back to beat the Aztecs, 39-28, in the largest come-from-behind win in ASU history. Later in the season, ASU put together an impressive win streak, and beat #6 Oregon at Autzen Stadium in Eugene, Oregon, where the Ducks had lost only one game at Autzen over the previous four seasons. After falling behind 21-0 in the second quarter, Walter led the Sun Devils to a 45-42 upset win over the Ducks, breaking a Pac-10 single game record for passing with 536 yards. ASU ended the regular season with an 8-5 record and nearly upset the Kansas State Wildcats, who were favored by 17 points over the Devils, in the 2002 Holiday Bowl. Although ASU narrowly lost the contest 34-27 (relinquishing the lead only once, in the closing minute of the game), Walter achieved the ASU single season passing record with 3,877 yards. =2003 season= 2003 was marked as a disappointing season for Walter and the Sun Devils. ASU started the season ranked at #15 but put up disappointing performances against traditionally weaker opponents Northern Arizona University and Utah State University. The Sun Devils suffered their first loss at the University of Iowa, losing 21-2 to the Hawkeyes. Despite the Sun Devils achieving a 5-7 record (2-6 in the Pac-10), Walter still threw for 3,044 yards, including the game-winning touchdown against North Carolina as time expired. Walter also earned the Territorial Cup MVP when ASU beat their arch-rivals the University of Arizona at Sun Devil Stadium. At the end of the 2003 season, Walter decided to forgo his opportunity to jump into the NFL and decided to stay at Arizona State for his last year of eligibility. =2004 season= Walter's senior campaign featured a number of highs and lows. Walter lead the Sun Devils to a comeback year where the Devils piled up an 8-3 record and clinched a berth in the Vitalis Sun Bowl. Walter also surpassed practically every ASU quarterback in every statistic. Walter also surpassed NFL legend John Elway as the Pac-10's all time touchdown leader. During the 2004 season, Walter helped the Devils defeat #15 Iowa 44-7. His low point of the season came when Walter went down in the fourth quarter during the regular season finale against Arizona and suffered a third degree shoulder separation, forcing him to miss the Sun Devils' post-season Sun Bowl game (a 27-23 victory over Purdue). Professional career Walter in 2008 =Oakland Raiders= Walter was selected by the Oakland Raiders in the third round (69th overall) of the 2005 NFL Draft. Walter spent his 2005 rookie season as the third-string quarterback for the Raiders behind Kerry Collins and backup quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo. Walter played in only two preseason games because of a groin injury, one that eventually required surgery at the conclusion of the 2005 season. Walter in 2009 Entering the 2006 season, Walter was expected to compete for the starting quarterback position with Tuiasosopo and Aaron Brooks. After a poor performance by Brooks in Week 1, Walter replaced him late in the game. The next week, Walter once again replaced Brooks due to poor performance including two fumbled snaps. Following the announcement that Brooks would miss 2‚Äì4 weeks with an injured pectoral muscle, Walter started the Week 4 game against the Cleveland Browns. On October 22, he led the Raiders to their first win of the year, defeating the Arizona Cardinals. However, Brooks returned in November and re-took the starting quarterback job from Walter, who would only start one more game in 2006. After the season, the Raiders drafted JaMarcus Russell with the first overall pick in the 2007 NFL Draft. Walter would begin the season as the Raiders' third quarterback, with veterans Daunte Culpepper and Josh McCown seeing time over Walter, who was only active for one game in 2007. Walter was listed as the No. 2 quarterback heading into the December 9 game against the Green Bay Packers. Walter entered the Packers game early in the fourth quarter in relief of McCown and completed 5 of 8 passes for 38 yards as the Raiders lost to the Packers by a score of 38-7. Walter was inserted into the game instead of rookie JaMarcus Russell, who had made his NFL debut a week earlier, due to head coach Lane Kiffin not wanting to play Russell when the offense was performing poorly. It was also apparently the coldest weather Russell had ever been in. With Russell taking the starting job in 2008, Walter continued to serve as the Raiders' third quarterback. He was active for just two games in 2008, starting one but posting only a 43.8 completion percentage. Walter was released by the Raiders on July 30, 2009, finishing his Oakland career with a 52.3 completion percentage. =New England Patriots= Walter was signed by the New England Patriots in August 2009 after the team waived quarterback Matt Gutierrez. He was released on September 4. Post-football career After choosing to leave the NFL at age 27, Walter was the first player to participate in the NFL Player Development Internship Program in commercial real estate at CB Richard Ellis in Phoenix. Walter then returned to Arizona State University to earn an MBA from the W.P. Carey School of Business. Walter founded and serves as the managing partner of Andrew Walter Holdings, a senior secured business lending firm. He‚Äôs undertaking another lending project called Redlands Capital, which will serve as the next generation to his start-up business. Walter has gained additional underwriting experience as a credit analyst at MidFirst Bank. Walter lost in the 2014 Republican primary election against Wendy Rogers for the House of Representatives seat in .http://www.azcentral.com/story/politicalinsider/2014/08/31/arizona-political- insider-aug30/14804919/ Personal life Walter serves on the advisory board of Veteran Tickets Foundation, a Scottsdale-based nonprofit that connects veterans with game, show, and event tickets (all gifts are tax deductible).

The main route is approximately long. It starts in the ancient part of Oslo and heads north along the lake Mj√∏sa, up the Gudbrandsdal valley, over the Dovrefjell mountains, and down the Oppdal and Gauldalen valleys to end at the Nidaros Cathedral. Route Although the Pilgrim's Route over the Dovrefjell mountains is only one of several pilgrimage routes in Norway, it is arguably the most famous. It connected the historically important Norwegian cities of Oslo and Nidaros (now Trondheim). =Oldest Known Route= The oldest known route over the Dovrefjell mountains, leaving the valley of the L√•gen at the Kongsg√•rden (King‚Äôs Farm) ar Tofte just past Dovre Church in the municipality of Dovre (slightly south of present-day Domb√•s). It followed a lower and more easterly route which followed the drainage to the east of Tofte, and then proceeded over Dovrefjell to join the route in Oppdal municipality. =King's Way= The \\"King's Way\\" traveled up through the Gudbrandsdal valley and left the valley of the L√•gen at Tofte Kongsg√•rden (King‚Äôs Farm) shortly past the Dovre Church in the municipality of Dovre (just south of present-day Domb√•s). This route went more directly over the Dovrefjell mountains into the municipality of Oppdal. Shelters The historically heavy stream of pilgrims which visited the shrine of St. Olaf in Trondheim annually prior to the Reformation resulted in the erection of mountain stations () where the pilgrims could find food and shelter. Stations were erected at Kongsvoll, Drivstuen, Fogstuen, and later at Hjerkinn. In speaking of the route, Knut Gjerset quotes Peder Clauss√∏n Friis as writing in the late 16th century, \\"But in the winter people of high estate, as well as members of the court, travel mostly this way, because however high and deep the snow may fall, it blows together on the high mountains and becomes so hard men and horses can walk on it. The bonder [farmers] run over it on skis and snow-shoes. There are three stations: Drivstuen, Herdekinn and Fogstuen built on this same mountain in order that travelers may find lodging there...at the stations there are implements and dry wood, so that the traveler may build themselves fire, and not suffer from cold, when they have to remain over night, and cannot find the way across the mountain.\\" History There is clear evidence that this route had seen heavy use in the early Norwegian Iron Age. Oppdal on the route was located at a crossroads for traffic from Trondheim, traffic over the Dovrefjell mountain range and the east coast. At Oppdal there are over 700 Viking era grave mounds indicating that Viking trade routes passed through these valleys. It is appropriately termed \\"The King's Road\\". Virtually every king of Norway traveled this road. Those for whom we easily find records of their passage range from the first King of Norway through the last King able to pass that way before the road was completely replaced with modern rail and tarmac. Harald Fairhair or Harold I was the first king of all Norway who crossed the Dovrefjell on The King's Road. Harald H√•rfagres saga describes an expedition he led up the Gudbrandsdal, and north over Dovrefjeld on his way to success at the battle of Orkadal. =Kings= *The Saga of St. Olaf says that in the year 1021 and again in 1024 King Olaf (1015-1028) travelled north through the Gudbrandsdal valley to Dovrefjell, where he crossed to Nidaros and remained there all winter. *Magnus Berrf√∏tts saga describes King Haakon Magnusson‚Äôs death in the Dovrefjell mountains in 1094. While crossing them he chased a rock ptarmigan until he got sick and died, leaving Magnus King of Norway. *Christian V (King of Denmark & Norway from 1670 to 1699) crossed the Dovrefjell mountains on horseback in 1685. *Frederik IV (King of Denmark & Norway from 1699 to 1730) crossed the Dovrefjell mountains in 1704 by cariole. The Norwegian cariole at that time only held one passenger, and the driver or attendant stood or sat behind on a narrow board above the axle. *Christian VI (King of Denmark & Norway from 1730 to 1746) crossed the Dovrefjell mountains in a 4-horse carriage in 1733. An illustrated manuscript of King Christian and Queen Sophie Magdalene's five- month-long journey through Norway is preserved in the Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen, of which a facsimile edition was published in 1992.Cf. the official website of the Amalienborgmuseet. *King Frederik V‚Äôs initials remained carved at Tofte from his passage through. *Christian Frederick passed this way, as did Karl Johan. =Railway lines= The Norwegian railway line R√∏rosbanen was opened on 13 October 1877, connecting Hamar and Trondheim via the towns of Elverum and R√∏ros. At this point, the difficult route up through the Dovrefjell mountains lost most of its appeal, compared with the relative ease of taking a train to Trondheim. The final end came on 17 September 1921, when the Dovre Line was completed. Starting at Domb√•s in Dovre municipality, it passes over the mountainous stretches of the Dovrefjell, before merging with the R√∏rosbanen again at St√∏ren. It passes close to the Old King's Road's historic route, but is to the west along a route which, although longer, has a lesser grade, as is required for rail. Present-day route Although the Pilgrim's Route fell into disuse with the arrival of the railroad, but has recently been revived. Today it is promoted and is used by modern travelers as a long-distance hiking trail. There is a Pilgrim's Office in Oslo which gives advice to travelers and a Pilgrim Centre in Trondheim, under the aegis of the Nidaros Cathedral, which awards certificates to successful travelers upon the completion of their journey.

Around 826 Frisia was given by Louis the Pious to the Danish King Harald Klak following his conversion to Christianity, Harald had sought refuge at Louis‚Äô court after being driven from his homeland. The 9th century epic Gudrunlied mentions the Danish dominion of Friesland and contains a reference to ‚ÄúGivers‚Äù in the area of Sande which is probably the first record of Jever. A further reference in 1158 notes a town by the name of \\"Geverae\\", the latinisiation of the low German Geveren or Gaveren (\\"pasture\\", or alternatively \\"Place of the Thing\\"). Coins stamped in Jever have been found as far afield as the Finnish Gulf and Warta in Poland which serves as testament to Jever importance as a trading town. during the 10th and 11th centuries Jever was a port and had access to the North Sea via both the Jade and the Harlebucht. Over time however land movements meant the access to the sea disappeared and the later construction of dikes has now left Jever well inland. Nevertheless, Jever retained importance as a trading post. In 1546 Hooksiel became an outer harbour for Jever and with the extension of paved roads from Jever to Hooksiel the need for even small ships to sail to Jever was abolished. Today in the centre of Jever a children‚Äôs playground with a climbing frame in the shape of a ship serves as a reminder of the city‚Äôs important maritime past. Saxon Dukes and subsequently the House of Welf later ruled over Jever, finally at the end of the 12th century, Jever came under the control of Oldenburg. A letter sent to King Philip III of France, details that between 1271 and 1285, the people of √ñstringer were subject to no sovereign, but that they selected their own judges and chiefs themselves (see Frisian freedom). Jever was granted rights as a town in 1347. Around the turn of the 15th century the town continued to be a prosperous trading center, this attracted not only merchants but also pirates. The most famous of the pirates was a band who were known as the \\"Likedeeler\\", and included Klaus St√∂rtebeker and Goedeke Michels. The last Baron of the Jeverland was Edo Wiemken who, in 1505, completed the reconstruction of the castle and is buried in the city church. After Edo‚Äôs death Jever came under the control of Graf Edward I. However Maria of Jever, the daughter of Edo restored the city‚Äôs independence, and in 1536 whilst under her rule Jever received its city rights which has led to the city‚Äôs unofficial title as \\"Marienstadt\\". Maria died in 1575 but her death was kept secret for fear of a return of the East Frisians. Instead, Jever became one of Oldenburg's territories by last will of Maria. In 1667 Jever was through distaff passed under control of the Anhalt-Zerbst. After Prince Frederick August, who had supported the English in the American Revolutionary War for financial reasons, died in 1793, the male-line of Anhalt-Zerbst perished and its territories were split. Jeverland was then given to Catherine II of Russia, formerly Princess Sophia of Anhalt-Zerbst and Frederick August's sole surviving sibling. It remained Russian until Napoleon's armies occupied it in 1807. Between 1808 and 1810 it was part of the Kingdom of Holland, a Napoleonic vassal state. When the French were forced to withdraw in 1813, Russia regained possession of Jever and gave it to the new grand dukes of Oldenburg in 1818. Jever was connected to the railway network in 1871 by a line from Sande. From 1881, a line connected it westwards to Wittmund, Esens and Dornum, and from 1888 there was a line northwards to Carolinensiel. The railway station in Jever still has a waiting room for the exclusive use of the Duke of Oldenburg to this day. Because Anhalt-Zerbst had guaranteed security and freedom of business for Jews, Jever became a center of Jewish life in Frisia, reaching its peak in the late 19th century. After that many youngsters left for larger cities where they hoped to find better economic opportunities (and since the 1920s also to escape growing anti- semitism). This caused the community to shrink to only half of its former size: by 1933, there were only 98 Jews left in Jever. The synagogue (inaugurated in 1802) was completely destroyed in the Night of Broken Glass, and at least 63 Jever Jews were killed in the Holocaust.

The headwaters lie in the Dovrefjell mountains in the south, from where it flows northward, downward through the Drivdalen valley in the municipality of Oppdal. When the river gets to the village of Oppdal, it turns westward and heads down the Sunndalen valley to the Sunndalsfjord at the village of Sunndals√∏ra in the municipality of Sunndal. Some of the other villages along the river include Gr√∏a, Hoelsand, L√∏nset, and Vognillan. The Norwegian National Road 70 follows the river for most of its course. Vinnufossen (waterfall); the Vinnu river is a tributary to Driva. Many of the tributaries on the west side of the Oppdal valley are dry since the waters in reservoirs formed from the many mountain lakes in that region flow in pipes through the mountain to the Driva hydroelectric power station at Fale in Sunndal. The largest lake in the reservoir system is Gjevillvatnet which is about long and about wide. History Before the last ice age, the river Driva drained northwards from Oppdal and joined the Orkla river. The uppermost part of the river in the Sunndalen valley which included the tributaries from the lake Gjevilvatnet, Dindalen, and Storlidalen then drained eastwards to Oppdal and joined the older Driva there. The ice age changed the course of the Driva and today, these three tributaries still flow eastwards until they meet the (now) westward-flowing Driva. Pilgrims followed the Driva on their way to the St. Olav shrine in Trondheim during the Middle Ages. As a result of the heavy stream of pilgrims who followed the Pilgrim's Route prior to the Reformation, king √òystein erected mountain stations where the pilgrims could find food and shelter. Kongsvoll, located along the Driva River in the upper Drivdalen valley, was one of these stations, another was Drivstua. Angling The river runs slowly the last kilometer to the fjord The Driva was formerly an excellent salmon river, but the parasite Gyrodactylus salaris has decimated the salmon stock. It is an excellent sea trout river, usually ranked number 1 or 2 in all of Norway, by total catch. Salmon and sea trout migrate up to Magalaupet (approximately ) and at optimal water discharge probably even further. Especially for sea trout this is an unusually long migration, although the majority of trout in Driva do not wander so far. The only tributary with a run of anadromous fish, is the Gr√∏vu. A river that enters from the south/west soon after Driva has reached the Sunndal valley. Gr√∏vu is also Drivas biggest tributary, and well known for the \\"√Ömotan\\".

Huntress, Jr. is an American space scientist. An astrochemist and space scientist, Huntress worked for about twenty years at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. During the 1980s he was also a video game designer, producing games for Apple computers. In 1988 Huntress moved to NASA headquarters, where he would serve in several positions, including Director of NASA's Solar System Exploration Division and Associate Administrator for Space Science. As a part of these positions, Huntress oversaw all NASA research missions to the planets and asteroids of our solar system, including missions to Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn. Following his work with NASA, he became the Director of the Geophysical Laboratory at the Carnegie Institution, and the president of The Planetary Society. He has also worked on the NASA Advisory Council, and is a public advocate for space exploration. Education and early career Wesley Huntress was interested in space exploration from a young age, describing himself as a \\"Sputnik kid\\", who entered the sciences in college out of an interest in joining the space race between the US and USSR. Huntress was awarded a B.S. in Chemistry from Brown University in 1964 and a Ph.D. in Chemical Physics from Stanford University in 1968. Following his degrees, he began a career as an astrochemist and space scientist Brown University would later bestow an honorary doctoral of sciences degree upon Huntress as well, during its 2005 convocation ceremonies. Jet Propulsion Laboratory Huntress spent much of his career at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, also teaching as a professor at the associated California Institute of Technology. He started at the lab following his PhD as a National Research Council Resident Associate, and joined the lab full-time in 1969 \\"as a research scientist specializing in ion chemistry and planetary atmospheres\\" according to NASA. His work there included research into the chemical evolution in interstellar clouds, comets and planetary atmospheres. His positions at the lab included those as \\"co-investigator for the Ion Mass Spectrometer experiment in the Giotto Halley's Comet mission, as the Coma Interdisciplinary Scientist for the Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby mission, and as JPL Study Scientist for the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite and Cassini missions\\". He was also a part of the research into molecule formation on Titan, research that was published in 1981 by Nature, as well as ion cyclotron resonance and ion-molecule reactions in off-Earth environments. Videogame programming During the 1980s, Huntress was a game programmer on the Apple II computer, creating space flight simulators. They were published through subLogic (Saturn Navigator), Edu-Ware (Rendezvous: A Space Shuttle Flight Simulation), and Electric Transit. In 1984 he then co-directed the game Wilderness: A Survival Adventure with Charles Kohlhase, a first-person computer game where you are the survivor of a plane crash and have to cross the Sierra Mountains to find a remote ranger's station in order to continue surviving. In 1986, Huntress was a producer on the computer game Lunar Explorer. NASA Administration Huntress was promoted from the Laboratory to NASA Headquarters in the late 1980s. He first worked as Special Assistant to the Director of Earth Science and Applications, and then served as the Director of NASA's Solar System Exploration Division. Upon taking the position, he became an advocate for reforming the Discovery Program for low- cost planetary exploration missions, to make it more cost-effective, including the opening of proposals from private companies to participate in the running of the program, creating a public-private partnership for solar system exploration. As director, Huntress served as the overseer and spokesperson for the development of NASA's missions to Mars that would take place over the 1990s, and the results of the Magellan probe mission to Venus as well as the Galileo mission to Jupiter. He also founded the NASA Astrobiology program. Huntress was promoted to NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Science in 1993. As Associate Administrator, Huntress was in charge of all of NASA's space science programs. Huntress worked within the agency, with White House and Congress, and as spokesperson for the press. Projects for which Huntress was responsible for included the Mars missions he had helped to develop in his prior positions, as well as the Cassini‚ÄìHuygens mission to Saturn. He remained in the position until 1998, whereupon he was the recipient of the 1998 Carl Sagan Memorial Award. Over his tenure, Huntress was also awarded the US Presidential Distinguished Executive Award, the NASA Robert H. Goddard Award, a NASA Distinguished Service Medal, and a National Endowment for the Arts design award for the Mars Pathfinder mission. Congressional testimony After leaving NASA, Huntress continued to provide testimony to Congress regarding space funding and budgetary issues, including a series of congressional hearings in October 2003 on the future of NASA. In 2001 he testified before the House Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, setting forward four \\"grand challenges\\" for American space exploration. According to the Washington Times, those challenges were: \\"(1) To seek evidence of life elsewhere in the solar system where liquid water existed in the past or exists now. (2) To study planets around other stars (the sun being the star of our planetary system). (3) To send a spacecraft to a nearby star, something we don't know how to do today - \\"but in 1900 we didn't know how to fly either.\\" (4) To develop a plan of human exploration beyond Earth orbit.\\" Carnegie Institution Following his time at NASA, Huntress became the director of the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Geophysical Laboratory in the fall of 1998, and remained in this position until his retirement in 2008. His role there continued to be strategizing and lobbying for space exploration. In 2004 he was head on a report, \\"The Next Steps In Exploring Deep Space\\", which proposed a vision for a \\"stepping stone\\" approach for incremental exploration of space by humans using the Moon, Lagrange Points, Near-Earth Objects, and Mars.The Next Steps In Exploring Deep Space from the International Academy of Astronautics (PDF document) His research has included the evolution of interstellar medium, and pre-biotic organic chemistry on early Earth. He is now Director Emeritus of the Geophysical Laboratory. While at Carnegie, he also served as the president of The Planetary Society from 2001 to 2006, having served as the society's vice-president in 2000. Neil de Grasse Tyson took over from Huntress in the position of the society's vice-president. Additional affiliations for Huntress include the International Academy of Astronautics, the Royal Astronomical Society, and the National Academies, where he is a lifetime associate. NASA Advisory Council While at Carnegie, Huntress continued to serve on the NASA Advisory Council, where he became an outspoken critic of reductions in the growth of NASA's science budget. For example, Huntress opined on the International Space Station, stating that, \\"I don't place the space station in the critical path for sending humans to the moon ... And frankly the science community will tell you it was never a very useful platform for doing science at all. It's not in the right orbit for lots of things, and it's a very noisy environment.\\" As a result of his views, he was asked by then-administrator Michael D. Griffin to resign his position with the council in August 2006. On November 2, 2009, Huntress returned to the Council, and was named by administrator Charles Bolden as chair of the NASA Advisory Council's Science Committee.NASA Announces Advisory Council Chairs and Committee Structure from NASA website Books In 2011 Huntress coauthored the book Soviet Robots in the Solar System: Mission Technologies and Discoveries with Soviet space scientist Mikhail Ya Marov.

He then joined NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) where he worked on the Mariner, Viking, and Voyager missions. French is a long-time advocate of a mission architecture for a Mars probe, known as Mars Sample Return with In-Situ Propellant Production, that would manufacture propellant from resources at the target planet to power a return trip, to dramatically reduce the size of the outbound vessel and the cost of the mission. He also published an article in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society in 1989 recommending in-situ propellant production for a manned Mars mission, though he recommended that the technique would not be feasible until a Mars base were already well-established, due to the risks of relying on fueling a spacecraft with in-situ produced propellant. Robert Zubrin credits this paper as a forerunner of the Mars Direct mission architecture, in which French's concern is resolved by devoting a separate spacecraft to the return trip, so that it can be verified as fueled and ready to launch from Mars before the crew launches from Earth. French now works as a private space systems engineering consultant, and is a Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA).

In such a process, a mixture is separated into fractions, which have compositions that vary according to a gradient. A fraction can be defined as a group of chemicals that have similar boiling points. A common fractionating process is fractional distillation. It is used to produce liquor and various hydrocarbon fuels, such as gasoline, kerosene and diesel. A fraction is the product of a fractionating column, a vast chamber designed to separate different substances (such as crude oil) based on their boiling point. Fraction could also refer to a description of the composition of a mixture, e.g. mass fraction or mole fraction.

Born in the influential Xun family of Yingchuan Commandery (around present-day Xuchang, Henan), Xun You was recruited into the civil service by the general He Jin. When the warlord Dong Zhuo hijacked and controlled the Han central government between 189 and 192, Xun You plotted with four others to assassinate him but was discovered and imprisoned. Following his release after Dong Zhuo's death, he wanted to serve as the Administrator of Shu Commandery (around present-day Chengdu, Sichuan) but eventually settled as an official in Jing Province. In 196, after Cao Cao received the figurehead Han sovereign, Emperor Xian, and reestablished the new imperial capital in Xu (Ë®±; present-day Xuchang, Henan), he summoned Xun You to the capital to serve as a Master of Writing and Military Adviser. From then on, Xun You was simultaneously a Han statesman and a subordinate of Cao Cao. He accompanied Cao Cao on his military campaigns as a tactical adviser and occasional commander. Between 198 and 207, he advised Cao Cao in the battles against rival warlords such as Zhang Xiu, L√º Bu, Yuan Shao and Yuan Shao's successors. In 207, on Cao Cao's recommendation, Emperor Xian made Xun You a village marquis to honour him for his contributions. In 213, after Cao Cao had been enfeoffed by Emperor Xian as the Duke of Wei, Xun You served as the Prefect of the Masters of Writing in Cao Cao's dukedom. In 214, while accompanying Cao Cao on a campaign against the southern warlord Sun Quan, Xun You died of illness along the way. Described as a highly profound and insightful thinker, Xun You was also known for keeping a very low profile and hiding his true talents and achievements behind the fa√ßade of a foolish, cowardly and weak person. Historical sources on Xun You's life The authoritative historical source on Xun You's life is his official biography in volume 10 of the Records of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguozhi), which was written by Chen Shou in the third century. In the fifth century, Pei Songzhi annotated the Sanguozhi by incorporating information from other sources to Chen Shou's original work and adding his personal commentary. Some alternative texts used in the annotations to the Sanguozhi include: the Wei Shu (È≠èÊõ∏; Book of Wei), by Wang Shen (), Xun Yi () and Ruan Ji; the Xun Shi Jia Zhuan (ËçÄÊ∞èÂÆ∂ÂÇ≥; Xun Family Genealogy); the Han Ji (Êº¢Á¥Ä; Annals of Han), by Zhang Fan (); the Fu Zi (), by Fu Xuan.

Xun You was orphaned at a young age. He was probably raised by his uncle Xun Qu () and his grandfather Xun Tan. When his grandfather died, a minor administrative assistant, Zhang Quan (), offered to be the tomb keeper. Xun You, who was 12 years old then, sensed that something was wrong. He told his uncle Xun Qu, \\"This man looks suspicious. I believe he's up to something.\\" Upon investigation, it was revealed that Zhang Quan was actually a murderer on the run.

Early career When the general He Jin rose to power in 189 and became regent to the child Emperor Shao, he recruited over 20 notable members of scholar-gentry background to join the civil service. Xun You was one of them. He was appointed as a Gentleman of the Yellow Gate () in the imperial capital, Luoyang. However, within the same year, He Jin was assassinated by the eunuch faction led by the Ten Attendants. The warlord Dong Zhuo took advantage of the ensuing political turmoil to hijack and control the central government. Between 190 and 191, several regional warlords formed a coalition and launched a campaign against Dong Zhuo in the name of saving the emperor. Dong Zhuo ordered Luoyang to be burnt down and relocated the capital to Chang'an. In Chang'an, Xun You secretly plotted with Zheng Tai (), He Yong, Chong Ji () and Wu Qiong () to assassinate Dong Zhuo, who was notorious for his cruelty and tyranny. However, they were discovered and Xun You was arrested and imprisoned. While he was incarcerated, Xun You spoke and behaved normally as though nothing had happened.

After the victory at Boma, Cao Cao and his forces headed west with their baggage train along the south banks of the Yellow River. Yuan Shao sent his troops across the river to raid the baggage train and they encountered Cao Cao. Cao Cao's subordinates were shocked and they asked him to head back to protect his camp. Xun You said, \\"This is an opportunity to capture the enemy! Why should we retreat?\\" Cao Cao looked at Xun You and laughed. He then ordered his troops to use their baggage as bait to lure Yuan Shao's forces into a trap. At the Battle of Yan Ford, when Yuan Shao's soldiers were scrambling for the baggage, Cao Cao sent his infantry and cavalry forces to attack them and scored a major victory; Yuan Shao's general Wen Chou was killed in action. Cao Cao then retreated to Guandu (ÂÆòÊ∏°; northeast of present-day Zhongmu County, Henan); Yuan Shao laid siege to Guandu.(ÂæåÂæûÊïëÂäâÂª∂ÊñºÁôΩÈ¶¨ÔºåÊî∏Áï´Á≠ñÊñ¨È°èËâØ„ÄÇË™ûÂú®Ê≠¶Á¥Ä„ÄÇÂ§™Á•ñÊãîÁôΩÈ¶¨ÈÇÑÔºåÈÅ£ËºúÈáçÂæ™Ê≤≥ËÄåË•ø„ÄÇË¢ÅÁ¥πÊ∏°Ê≤≥ËøΩÔºåÂçíËàáÂ§™Á•ñÈÅá„ÄÇË´∏Â∞áÁöÜÊÅêÔºåË™™Â§™Á•ñÈÇÑ‰øùÁáüÔºåÊî∏Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊ≠§ÊâÄ‰ª•Á¶ΩÊïµÔºåÊü∞‰ΩïÂéª‰πãÔºÅ„ÄçÂ§™Á•ñÁõÆÊî∏ËÄåÁ¨ë„ÄÇÈÅÇ‰ª•ËºúÈáçÈ§åË≥äÔºåË≥äÁ´∂Â•î‰πãÔºåÈô£‰∫Ç„ÄÇ‰πÉÁ∏±Ê≠•È®éÊìäÔºåÂ§ßÁ†¥‰πãÔºåÊñ¨ÂÖ∂È®éÂ∞áÊñáÈÜúÔºåÂ§™Á•ñÈÅÇËàáÁ¥πÁõ∏ÊãíÊñºÂÆòÊ∏°„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 10.

Xun You also recommended Cao Cao's general Xu Huang to lead the attack on Han Xun. Cao Cao sent Xu Huang and Shi Huan () to raid Han Xun's convoy and they burnt the supplies. Later, Yuan Shao's adviser Xu You defected to Cao Cao's side and urged Cao to attack Yuan's supply depot at Wuchao (ÁÉèÂ∑¢; southeast of present- day Yanjin County, Henan), which was guarded by Chunyu Qiong. While Cao Cao's other subordinates were suspicious about Xu You, only Xun You and Jia Xu advised Cao to heed Xu You's suggestion. Cao Cao then ordered Xun You and Cao Hong to remain behind to guard his main camp, while he personally led his forces to attack Wuchao and succeeded in destroying Yuan Shao's supplies and killed Chunyu Qiong in battle. As the tide turned against Yuan Shao, two of his generals, Zhang He and Gao Lan (), destroyed their own camps and led their men to defect and surrender to Cao Cao's side. When Zhang He and Gao Lan showed up at Cao Cao's main camp, Cao Hong felt suspicious and was reluctant to accept their surrender. Xun You told Cao Hong, \\"Zhang He was angry that Yuan Shao did not listen to him so he decided to defect. Sir, what's there to suspect about him?\\" Cao Hong then accepted their surrender.(Â§™Á•ñÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåË™∞ÂèØ‰ΩøÔºü„ÄçÊî∏Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂæêÊôÉÂèØ„ÄÇ„Äç‰πÉÈÅ£ÊôÉÂèäÂè≤Ê∏ôÈÇÄÊìäÁ†¥Ëµ∞‰πãÔºåÁáíÂÖ∂ËºúÈáç„ÄÇÊúÉË®±Êî∏‰æÜÈôçÔºåË®ÄÁ¥πÈÅ£Ê∑≥‰∫éÁìäÁ≠âÂ∞áËê¨È§òÂÖµËøéÈÅãÁ≥ßÔºåÂ∞áÈ©ïÂçíÊÉ∞ÔºåÂèØË¶ÅÊìä‰πü„ÄÇË°ÜÁöÜÁñë„ÄÇÂîØÊî∏ËàáË≥àË©°Âã∏Â§™Á•ñ„ÄÇÂ§™Á•ñ‰πÉÁïôÊî∏ÂèäÊõπÊ¥™ÂÆà„ÄÇÂ§™Á•ñËá™Â∞áÊîªÁ†¥‰πãÔºåÁõ°Êñ¨ÁìäÁ≠â„ÄÇÁ¥πÂ∞áÂºµÈÉÉ„ÄÅÈ´òË¶ΩÁáíÊîªÊ´ìÈôçÔºåÁ¥πÈÅÇÊ£ÑËªçËµ∞„ÄÇÈÉÉ‰πã‰æÜÔºåÊ¥™Áñë‰∏çÊï¢ÂèóÔºåÊî∏Ë¨ÇÊ¥™Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÈÉÉË®à‰∏çÁî®ÔºåÊÄíËÄå‰æÜÔºåÂêõ‰ΩïÁñëÔºü„Äç‰πÉÂèó‰πã„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 10. After Yuan Shao's death in June 202, Cao Cao launched a campaign against Yuan's sons Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang and defeated them at the Battle of Liyang. In the following year, when Cao Cao was planning to attack Liu Biao, he received news that Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang had started fighting over control of Ji Province. Yuan Tan sent his adviser Xin Pi to convey to Cao Cao his wish to surrender and seek aid from Cao in countering his brother. Cao Cao considered accepting Yuan Tan's surrender and sending troops to aid him, and then consulted his advisers. Most of them thought that Liu Biao was more powerful and that Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang posed no threat, so they urged Cao Cao to attack Liu Biao first. Xun You had a different opinion from them. He said, \\"The Empire has experienced so much turmoil, yet Liu Biao has holed up in the Jiang and Han regions. This shows that he has no intention of expanding his territory. The Yuans occupy four provinces and have 100,000 troops. Yuan Shao had treated his subordinates generously and hoped that his sons would cooperate harmoniously to safeguard his territories; that was why turmoil in the Empire never seemed to end. As of now, relations between the brothers have deteriorated and they seek to destroy each other. If one of them defeats and absorbs the other, he will become more powerful and more difficult to defeat. If you take advantage of their internal conflict to defeat them, you will restore stability in the Empire. You shouldn't miss this great opportunity.\\" Cao Cao agreed, accepted Yuan Tan's surrender and led his forces to attack Yuan Shang. Yuan Tan later rebelled against Cao Cao but was defeated and killed at the Battle of Nanpi in 205.(‰∏ÉÂπ¥ÔºåÂæûË®éË¢ÅË≠ö„ÄÅÂ∞öÊñºÈªéÈôΩ„ÄÇÊòéÂπ¥ÔºåÂ§™Á•ñÊñπÂæÅÂäâË°®ÔºåË≠ö„ÄÅÂ∞öÁà≠ÂÖæÂ∑û„ÄÇË≠öÈÅ£ËæõÊØó‰πûÈôçË´ãÊïëÔºåÂ§™Á•ñÂ∞áË®±‰πãÔºå‰ª•ÂïèÁæ£‰∏ã„ÄÇÁæ£‰∏ãÂ§ö‰ª•ÁÇ∫Ë°®ÂΩäÔºåÂÆúÂÖàÂπ≥‰πãÔºåË≠ö„ÄÅÂ∞ö‰∏çË∂≥ÊÜÇ‰πü„ÄÇÊî∏Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂ§©‰∏ãÊñπÊúâ‰∫ãÔºåËÄåÂäâË°®Âùê‰øùÊ±ü„ÄÅÊº¢‰πãÈñíÔºåÂÖ∂ÁÑ°ÂõõÊñπÂøóÂèØÁü•Áü£„ÄÇË¢ÅÊ∞èÊìöÂõõÂ∑û‰πãÂú∞ÔºåÂ∏∂Áî≤ÂçÅËê¨ÔºåÁ¥π‰ª•ÂØ¨ÂéöÂæóË°ÜÔºåÂÄü‰Ωø‰∫åÂ≠êÂíåÁù¶‰ª•ÂÆàÂÖ∂ÊàêÊ•≠ÔºåÂâáÂ§©‰∏ã‰πãÈõ£Êú™ÊÅØ‰πü„ÄÇ‰ªäÂÖÑÂºüÈÅòÊÉ°ÔºåÂÖ∂Âã¢‰∏çÂÖ©ÂÖ®„ÄÇËã•ÊúâÊâÄÂπ∂ÂâáÂäõÂ∞àÔºåÂäõÂ∞àÂâáÈõ£Âúñ‰πü„ÄÇÂèäÂÖ∂‰∫ÇËÄåÂèñ‰πãÔºåÂ§©‰∏ãÂÆöÁü£ÔºåÊ≠§ÊôÇ‰∏çÂèØÂ§±‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÂ§™Á•ñÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂñÑ„ÄÇ„Äç‰πÉË®±Ë≠öÂíåË¶™ÔºåÈÅÇÈÇÑÊìäÁ†¥Â∞ö„ÄÇÂÖ∂ÂæåË≠öÂèõÔºåÂæûÊñ¨Ë≠öÊñºÂçóÁöÆ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 10. =Later life and death= After pacifying Ji Province, Cao Cao wrote a memorial to Emperor Xian to recommend him to award Xun You a marquis title to honour him for his contributions.

You should treat him courteously and respectfully.\\" When Xun You was ill, Cao Pi visited him and knelt down beside his bed; such was Cao Pi's level of respect for Xun You. Zhong Yao also once said, \\"Every time I plan something, I'll carefully think through it again and again until I'm certain that I can't make any more changes.

The river originates west of the Mackenzie Mountains and flows 530 km (329 mi) long through the south central Yukon. The Pelly has two main tributaries, the Ross and Macmillan rivers. Tent camp along the Pelly River, 1898 The Selkirk First Nation (Hucha Hudan people) name for the river is Ts'enk√≠ny√§k Ch√∫, meaning 'water running between the mountains'. The river was later named by Robert Campbell in honour of Sir John Henry Pelly, governor of the Hudson's Bay Company. The restored Hudson's Bay Company trading post of Fort Selkirk is at the juncture of the Pelly and Yukon Rivers. Course The Pelly rises in glaciers on the western slopes of the Selwyn Mountains above in elevation, close to the Yukon-Northwest Territories boundary. It flows south and west through a wide valley, receiving many small tributaries from the east. It passes the Pelly Lakes, out of which flows the Woodside River, and there it turns to the west. The Pelly then assumes a northwesterly course through the Tintina Trench. It flows northwest to receive the Ross River at the town of Ross River where there is a cable ferry. Paralleling the Robert Campbell Highway, it then merges with the Lapie River from the left and passes the community of Faro which can be reached by a bridge. After Faro, it runs south of Rose Mountain and receives the Glenlyon River from the left.Course info mostly from Natural Resources Canada and U.S. Geological Survey/U.S. Forest Service topographic maps from mytopo.com At the Glenlyon River confluence, the valley narrows and the walls grow higher and steeper, and a short distance later, receives the swift-flowing Tay River from the right. Several kilometers after, it turns north and receives the Earn River, also from the right. The river soon exits out of the canyon and winds across a plain, where it receives the Tummel River from the left. It then receives the Macmillan River, its largest tributary, from the right, then turns west, looping around the town of Pelly Crossing and crossing under the Klondike Highway, one of only two bridges on its course (the other is in Faro). The river continues west for about to merge with the Yukon River near old Fort Selkirk. Watershed One of two major headwaters of the Yukon River (the other is the Stewart River), the Pelly River's drainage basin, measured above the town of Pelly Crossing, is in size. It drains a large part of the sparsely-populated Yukon Plateau of the central Yukon Territory west of the Mackenzie Mountains. The Tintina Trench, which the majority of the river's waters flow in, is the northernmost extension of the Rocky Mountain Trench, which stretches well south to British Columbia. The river is navigable by small and medium-sized craft for over , from its mouth to Hoole Rapids, except for a shallow stretch of the river in Bradens Canyon. The Yukon communities of Ross River, Faro and Pelly Crossing are all on the Pelly River. There are bridges across the Pelly in Pelly Crossing (where it crosses the Klondike Highway) and in Faro, as well as a cable ferry at Ross River on the Canol Road. The river's average discharge is about and it drains about of land. Because the river is fed primarily by glacier melt, the highest average flow is reached around June or July at up to , and the lowest is in December or January as low as . Hazards Volcanoes near the Pelly River, such as Volcano Mountain, may have once partly blocked or at least altered the Pelly River. Any future activity in this area could disrupt the course of the river and could have a serious impact on people living or working downstream.

The station is situated just under a mile to the east of the town centre. The station is located south of Bristol Temple Meads, on the Heart of Wessex Line. The station is managed by Great Western Railway, with trains being operated by them and by South Western Railway. History Semaphore signals at Pen Mill The station was opened by the Great Western Railway (GWR) as part of the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth route on 2 February 1854. The GWR opened a locomotive depot at the station in September 1856, which operated until January 1959, when it was closed and the locomotives transferred to Yeovil Town depot. Bristol and Exeter Railway line from Taunton, initially terminating at , had been extended to connect with the GWR at Yeovil Pen Mill from 2 February 1857. In June 1874, both these lines (GWR and B&ER;) were converted from their original broad gauge to what had become the standard gauge. A connection between the GWR line and the Southern Railway line to Exeter was established during World War II to allow trains direct access between and Yeovil Pen Mill. This was opened on 13 October 1943 and offered a new route for trains of war materials as well as a diversion route in the event of bomb damage. Accidents and incidents A passenger train overran a signal on 8 August 1913 and hit the rear of another passenger train. Two people were killed and ten injured.

(Photo by George Silk.) Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels was the name given by Australian soldiers to Papua New Guinean war carriers who, during World War II, were recruited to bring supplies up to the front and carry injured Australian troops down the Kokoda trail during the Kokoda Campaign. \\"Fuzzy- Wuzzy\\" was originally used by British soldiers in the 19th century as a name for Hadendoa warriors on the Red Sea coast of the Sudan, and referred to their elaborate butter-matted hairstyles. History In 1942, during the Pacific invasion, the Japanese had built up a force of 13,500 in the Gona region of Papua with the intention of invading Port Moresby. The key to the offensive was an overland trail across the Owen Stanley Ranges. The trail ranged from the small village of Buna on the north coast of Papua and went up the slopes through Gorari and Oivi to Kokoda. The trail was approximately long, folded into a series of ridges, rising higher and to and then declining again to . It was covered in thick jungle, short trees and tall trees tangled with vines. In June 1942, Australian Major General Basil Morris issued an \\"Employment of Natives Order\\", which allowed native Papuans to be recruited as carriers for three years. Between August and December that year, around 16,000 Papuans were recruited, often with false promises such as a shorter period of service or a less difficult working condition. In some occasions, the Papuans were forced into service. On 29 August 1942, the Japanese task force broke through the Australian line forcing the Australians to retreat further back to Templeton's Crossing. Eventually, the Australians were forced to retreat to Myola. Six hundred and fifty Australian lives were lost in the campaign. It is speculated that this number would have been much larger without the Papuans' service. As one Australian digger has noted: > They carried stretchers over seemingly impassable barriers, with the patient > reasonably comfortable. The care they give to the patient is magnificent. If > night finds the stretcher still on the track, they will find a level spot > and build a shelter over the patient. They will make him as comfortable as > possible fetch him water and feed him if food is available, regardless of > their own needs. They sleep four each side of the stretcher and if the > patient moves or requires any attention during the night, this is given > instantly. These were the deeds of the \\"Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels\\" ‚Äì for us! No known injured soldier that was still alive was ever abandoned by the Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels, even during heavy combat. In July 2007, grandsons of Australian World War II soldiers and grandsons of the Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels took part in the \\"Kokoda Challenge\\". The last Fuzzy Wuzzy Angel from the Kokoda Track area, Faole Bokoi, died aged 91 in 2016. He was appointed the Village Constable of his village, Manari, in the 1950s and had visited Australia as a guest of the Returned Services League in his later years. The last Fuzzy Wuzzy Angel was Havala Laula who died on 24 December 2017. Official recognition In June 2008, Australian senator Guy Barnett called for his country's Parliament to give official recognition to Papua New Guineans' courage and contributions to the war effort. > I was stunned to learn that Australia has not officially recognised these > wonderful PNG nationals who saved the lives of Australian servicemen.

He is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) as The nWo Sting, an impostor version of the original Sting aligned to the New World Order stable. Professional wrestling career =Early career (19911993)= Farmer started wrestling in 1991 as Lightning in the tag team of \\"Thunder and Lightning\\" in the IWF promotion in Florida. http://prowresblog.blogspot.com/2017/04/iwf-5271993-best-of-iwf.htmlIn August 1993, the team toured All Japan Pro Wrestling, facing teams such as Dan Kroffat & Doug Furnas, Jun Akiyama & Tsuyoshi Kikuchi, and Mighty Inoue & Takao Omori. While in the promotion, they wrestled as \\"Lightning & Thunder\\". https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr;=733&page;=4&s;=500 =World Championship Wrestling (19931994)= In 1993, Thunder and Lightning were signed by World Championship Wrestling (WCW). They made their first appearance at a WCW Worldwide taping in Orlando, FL on July 10, 1993 (in an episode that would not air until November 13th of that year), defeating Billy Brooks and Rhett Blair. Their first actual television appearance came on August 29th, 1993 on WCW's The Main Event, where they upset Chris Benoit and Bobby Eaton. Thunder & Lightning's next match saw their first defeat, as they fell to Yoshi Kwan (Chris Champion) and Bobby Eaton at a house show in Kennesaw, GA on September 28th. https://www.cagematch.net/en/?id=1&nr;=56354 Although WCW had cut back severely on house shows in Eric Bischoff's first year helming the company, they did continue to tour smaller locations to give new, younger wrestlers experience. Thunder & Lightning would wrestle on several of these events in the fall of 1993 and engaged in a house show program with Tex Slazinger and Shanghai Pierce. On the December 11th, 1993 edition of WCW Saturday Night the team called out WCW World Tag Team Champions The Nasty Boys, as well as several other teams. http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw93.htm Thunder and Lightning entered 1994 continuing to come out victorious on television against preliminary level competition, but suffered their first loss when they were defeated on February 20, 1994 by Pretty Wonderful on The Main Event. They made their first PPV appearance at SuperBrawl IV where they lost to Harlem Heat. Their losing streak on television continued into April as they suffered defeats to Bad Attitude (Steve Keirn & Bobby Eaton) and Pretty Wonderful. Thunder & Lightning's final match however was a win; they teamed with Terry Taylor to defeat Tex Slazenger, Shanghai Pierce, and Dallas Page on WCW Pro on April 30th, 1994. Farmer left WCW in the spring of 1994. http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw94.htm =Independent circuit (19941995)= In July 1994, Farmer wrestled for the National Wrestling Alliance territories in Tennessee and the Carolinas. He would later join the Global Wrestling Federation in Dallas, Texas near the end of July. In February 1995, he and fellow former WCW wrestler Jim Steele wrestled a dark match for the World Wrestling Federation. =World Championship Wrestling and New Japan Pro Wrestling= Cobra (1995) Farmer returned to WCW in July 1995 as Cobra to feud with Craig Pittman. Cobra made his WCW debut on September 9, 1995 edition of WCW Worldwide, defeating Bobby Starr with his Cobra clutch slam finisher. Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan and \\"Mean\\" Gene Okerlund explained Cobra's kayfabe back story of having served in the Gulf War. Sgt. Craig Pittman, a legit Marine sergeant, abandoned Cobra in the Jungle, then reported him AWOL back at camp. Cobra lost all rank and respect, learned to wrestle, and came to WCW seeking revenge on Pittman. The feud was short-lived, with Pittman defeating Cobra by submission in a very short match, although in a rematch the following week, Cobra won. They then would go back and forth and trade victories for a few months before the feud ended. nWo Sting (19961999) The nWo had been battling Sting, one of WCW‚Äôs most loyal supporters, since its inception in July 1996. As part of an elaborate plan, Farmer made his debut as ‚ÄúSting‚Äù on the September 9, 1996 edition of Monday Nitro when he attacked Lex Luger appearing from the nWo limousine after a tape recording of Sting speaking had been played. This led Luger, his longtime ally, friend and tag team partner, to publicly question Sting‚Äôs loyalty. At Fall Brawl, as Team WCW was being interviewed, Sting came in and told his teammates that he had nothing to do with the attack. Luger told Sting rather bluntly that he did not believe him. Later during the War Games match, the last man out for team nWo was ‚ÄúSting‚Äù, which convinced everyone (including the broadcast team) that the real Sting was part of the nWo. However, the real Sting showed up as the last man for Team WCW. After assaulting team nWo, Sting walked over to Luger, shoved him, and said, \\"Is that good enough for ya?\\" and left the ring. This showed everyone that the nWo Sting was an imposter. The imposter Sting picked up the victory in the match for team nWo when he forced Luger to submit with the Scorpion death lock. After the War Games match, the real Sting began to evolve into a much darker character with Farmer‚Äôs Imposter Sting character serving as the catalyst that started the transformation of the character from ‚ÄúSurfer‚Äù Sting to the much darker, Crow-like Sting. Farmer now referred to as the nWo Sting, became more of a comedy act in WCW. Farmer would comically mimic Sting‚Äôs classic mannerisms, while dressed as the dark Sting. He would also copy the loyalty tests and began carrying a baseball bat as the real Sting did. On occasion, nWo Sting would try to appease the real Sting when both were in the ring. Unfortunately for Farmer, this usually led to the real Sting attacking him and getting laid out with the Scorpion Death Drop. In matches, nWo Sting would lose to opponents, or need help from the entire nWo to win a match. The television announcers would refer to him as imposter, fake, or bogus Sting. Announcer Larry Zbyszko nicknamed him ‚ÄúStink‚Äù. The rest of the nWo would completely ignore him whenever the real Sting was around when they were trying to recruit him. After it was revealed that Sting had sided with WCW, Eric Bischoff promised an interview with Sting. He instead brought out nWo Sting and held a mock interview that berated the real Sting and praised Hollywood Hogan. Farmer appeared in the video game WCW vs. nWo: World Tour as nWo Sting, labeled in the game as \\"Sting\\". In March 1997, Farmer joined nWo Japan in New Japan Pro Wrestling and began to split his time between Japan and America. While in Japan, nWo Sting began to rise in popularity and became a prominent member of the group. He regularly teamed with nWo Japan leader Masahiro Chono. The nWo Sting became much more popular than the real Sting in Japan. As a result, Farmer would spend more time in Japan. In November 1997, he teamed up with Hiroyoshi Tenzan to compete in the 1997 Super Grade Tag League. The team would score three victories during the league. nWo Sting‚Äôs last appearances in WCW came in May 1998, when he joined nWo Hollywood and began teaming with The Giant. The Giant had previously won the WCW World Tag Team Championship with the real Sting, but the team imploded when Giant joined nWo Hollywood, and began feuding over control of the tag team titles they held together. On the May 25, 1998 edition of Monday Nitro, the team of nWo Sting & Giant lost to Lex Luger and Sting, which after the match saw the real Sting join the nWo as a part of the Wolfpac faction. After Farmer left, the nWo began using Sting masks and having other nWo members appear as fake Stings. He made one final appearance as Fake Sting on the July 5th 1999 edition of Monday Nitro when he interfered in a match between Kevin Nash and Sid Vicious. nWo Sting returned to Japan, where he had a run as a fan favorite. Chono, the leader of nWo Japan suffered a neck injury which led to Keiji Mutoh taking charge and changing the groups philosophy. As a fan favorite, nWo Sting teamed up with Brian Adams to challenge for the IWGP Tag Team Championship, and also teamed up with Tenzan again to compete in the 1998 Super Grade Tag League. In May 1999, Chono returned from his injury and began feuding with Mutoh over direction of nWo Japan. During this feud, nWo Sting left the group and sided with Chono. In 2014, WWE released a retrospective DVD collection titled \\"The Best of Sting\\". A picture of Farmer as nWo Sting is featured on the back cover of the set. It was later revealed that the picture of nWo Sting was actually a mistake on WWE's part.http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/513401-possible-error-on-the-best-of- sting-dvd-released-today Team 2000 & New Japan Army (19992002) After leaving nWo Japan, Farmer changed his ring name to Super J, and along with Chono, and Michael Wallstreet formed Team 2000 to feud with nWo Japan. The two factions would fight for the next seven months before the feud culminated at the Wrestling World 2000 event. At the event, Team 2000 defeated nWo Japan in a best of four series, forcing the nWo Japan to disband and become part of Team 2000. Super J was well received by the NJPW audience, and was also a prominent member of Team 2000, teaming with Chono through 2001. The team made a couple of appearances in WCW before its closure in early 2001. Super J teamed up with Scott Norton to compete in the 2001 G1 Tag League, scoring 7 victories. Super J left Team 2000 in March 2002, and joined rival group, the New Japan Army. The two groups feuded until September 2002 when Team 2000 was absorbed into the New Japan Army as well. =Return to the independent circuit (20012005)= In 2004, Farmer went back to the nWo Sting gimmick on the independent circuit in the Carolinas until he started wrestling exclusively for Ultimate Championship Wrestling on January 8, 2005 when he won the title. He retired later that year. Academic career As of late 2010, Farmer is project manager of a research program known as GEAR (Genetics, Exercise, and Research) at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. The program aims to identify how \\"people's genetic background influences their response to physical activity.\\"Munzenrieder,, Kyle Former Pro-Wrestler \\"nWo Sting\\" Now Manages Research Program at University of Miami School of Medicine Miami New Times (December 15, 2010).

Known from his Romanian youth as a Symbolist poet and columnist, he alternated Neoromantic and Expressionist themes with echoes from Tudor Arghezi, and dedicated several poetic cycles to the rural life of his native Moldavia. Fondane, who was of Jewish Romanian extraction and a nephew of Jewish intellectuals Elias and Moses Schwartzfeld, participated in both minority secular Jewish culture and mainstream Romanian culture. During and after World War I, he was active as a cultural critic, avant-garde promoter and, with his brother-in-law Armand Pascal, manager of the theatrical troupe Insula. Fondane began a second career in 1923, when he moved to Paris. Affiliated with Surrealism, but strongly opposed to its communist leanings, he moved on to become a figure in Jewish existentialism and a leading disciple of Lev Shestov. His critique of political dogma, rejection of rationalism, expectation of historical catastrophe and belief in the soteriological force of literature were outlined in his celebrated essays on Charles Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud, as well as in his final works of poetry. His literary and philosophical activities helped him build close relationships with other intellectuals: Shestov, Emil Cioran, David Gascoyne, Jacques Maritain, Victoria Ocampo, Ilarie Voronca etc. In parallel, Fondane also had a career in cinema: a film critic and a screenwriter for Paramount Pictures, he later worked on Rapt with Dimitri Kirsanoff, and directed the since-lost film Tararira in Argentina. A prisoner of war during the fall of France, Fondane was released and spent the occupation years in clandestinity. He was eventually captured and handed to Nazi German authorities, who deported him to Auschwitz-Birkenau. He was sent to the gas chamber during the last wave of the Holocaust. His work was largely rediscovered later in the 20th century, when it became the subject of scholarly research and public curiosity in both France and Romania. In the latter country, this revival of interest also sparked a controversy over copyright issues. Biography =Early life= Fondane was born in Ia»ôi, the cultural capital of Moldavia, on November 14, 1898, but, as he noted in a diary he kept at age 16, his birthday was officially recorded as November 15.Daniel, p. 595 Fondane was the only son of Isac Wechsler and his wife Adela (n√©e Schwartzfeld), who also bore the sisters Lina (b. 1892) and Rodica (b. 1905), both of whom had careers in acting.Daniel, p. 596-597, 641, 643 Wechsler was a Jewish man from Hertza region, his ancestors having been born on the Fundoaia estate (which the poet later used as the basis for his signature).Daniel, p. 596 Z. Ornea, \\"Iudaismul √Æn eseistica lui Fundoianu\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 48/1999 Adela was from an intellectual family, of noted influence within the urban Jewish community: her father, poet B. Schwartzfeld, was the owner of a book collection, while her uncles Elias and Moses both had careers in humanities.Daniel, p. 597 Adela herself was well acquainted with the intellectual elite of Ia»ôi, Jewish as well as ethnic Romanian, and kept recollections of her encounters with authors linked with the Junimea society.Daniel, p. 597; Sandqvist, p. 355 Through Moses Schwartzfeld, Fondane was also related with socialist journalist Avram Steuerman-Rodion, one of the literary men who nurtured the boy's interest in literature.Daniel, p. 596-597, 602 The young Benjamin was an avid reader, primarily interested in the Moldavian classics of Romanian literature (Ion Neculce, Miron Costin, Dosoftei, Ion CreangƒÉ), Romanian traditionalists or Neoromantics (Vasile Alecsandri, Ion Luca Caragiale, George Co»ôbuc, Mihai Eminescu) and French Symbolists.Daniel, p. 598, 601. See also Tomescu (2006), p. 122 In 1909, after graduating from School No. 1 (an annex of the Trei Ierarhi Monastery), he was admitted into the Alexandru cel Bun secondary school, where he did not excel as a student.Daniel, p. 599, 602‚Äì603 A restless youth (he recalled having had his first love affair at age 12, with a girl six years his senior), Fondane twice failed to get his remove before the age of 14. Roxana Sorescu, \\"B. Fundoianu ‚Äì anii de ucenicie\\" (II), in Observator Cultural, Nr. 501, November 2009 Benjamin divided his time between the city and his father's native region. The latter's rural landscape impressed him greatly, and, enduring in his memory, became the setting in several of his poems.Daniel, p. 599-601 The adolescent Fondane took extended trips throughout northern Moldavia, making his debut in folkloristics by writing down samples of the narrative and poetic tradition in various Romanian-inhabited localities.Daniel, p. 600-601 Among his childhood friends was the future Yiddish-language writer B. Iosif, with whom he spent his time in Ia»ôi's Podul Vechi neighborhood.Daniel, p. 598-599 In this context, Fondane also met Yiddishist poet Iacob Ashel Groper‚Äîan encounter which shaped Fondane's intellectual perspectives on Judaism and Jewish history. Roxana Sorescu, \\"B. Fundoianu ‚Äì anii de ucenicie\\" (I), in Observator Cultural, Nr. 500, November 2009 At the time, Fondane became known to his family and friends as Mielu»ôon (from miel, Romanian for \\"lamb\\", and probably in reference to his bushy hairdo), a name which he later used as a colloquial pseudonym.Daniel, p. 599 Although Fondane later claimed to have started writing poetry at age eight, his earliest known contributions to the genre date from 1912, including both pieces of his own and translations from such authors as Andr√© Ch√©nier, Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff, Heinrich Heine and Henri de R√©gnier.Daniel, p. 599, 601‚Äì602; Martin, p. VI The same year, some of these were published, under the pseudonym I. G. Ofir, in the local literary review Floare AlbastrƒÉ, whose owner, A. L. Zissu, was later a noted novelist and Zionist political figure.Daniel, p. 603 Later research proposed that these, like some other efforts of the 1910s, were collective poetry samples, resulting from a collaboration between Fondane and Groper (the former was probably translating the latter's poetic motifs into Romanian). In 1913, Fondane also tried his hand at editing a student journal, signing his editorial with the pen name Van Doian, but only produced several handwritten copies of a single issue.Daniel, p. 602‚Äì603 =Debut years= Fondane's actual debut dates back to 1914, during the time when he became a student at the National High School Ia»ôi and formally affiliated with the provincial branch of the nationwide Symbolist movement. That year, samples of lyric poetry were also published in the magazines Valuri and Revista NoastrƒÉ (whose owner, writer Constan»õa Hodo»ô, even offered Fondane a job on the editorial board, probably unaware that she was corresponding with a high school student).Daniel, p. 603, 609. Sandqvist (p. 354), who places the collaboration with Valuri in 1912, notes that it was in this context that the poet first adopted his Benjamin Fundoianu signature. Also in 1914, the Moldavian Symbolist venue Absolutio, edited by Isac Ludo, featured pieces he signed with the pen name I. Ha»ôir.Daniel, p. 603‚Äì604 Among his National High School colleagues was Alexandru Al. Philippide, the future critic, who remained one of Fondane's best friends (and whose poetry Fondane proposed for publishing in Revista NoastrƒÉ). Late in 1914, Fondane also began his short collaboration with the Ia»ôi Symbolist tribune Viea»õa NouƒÉ. While several of his poems were published there, the review's founder Ovid Densusianu issued objections to their content, and, in their subsequent correspondence, each writer outlines his stylistic disagreements with the other.Daniel, p. 604‚Äì605 During the first two years of World War I and Romania's neutrality, the young poet established new contacts within the literary environments of Ia»ôi and Bucharest. According to his brother-in-law and biographer Paul Daniel, \\"it is amazing how many pages of poetry, translations, prose, articles, chronicles have been written by Fundoianu in this interval.\\"Daniel, p. 605 In 1915, four of his patriotic-themed poems were published on the front page of Diminea»õa daily, which campaigned for Romanian intervention against the Central Powers (they were the first of several contributions Fondane signed with the pen name Alex. Vilara, later Al. Vilara).Daniel, p. 605, 609; Martin, p. X His parallel contribution to the B√¢rlad-based review Revista CriticƒÉ (originally, Cronica Moldovei) was more strenuous: Fondane declared himself indignant that the editorial staff would not send him the galley proofs, and received instead an irritated reply from manager Al. »òtefƒÉnescu; he was eventually featured with poems in three separate issues of Revista CriticƒÉ.Daniel, p. 606 At around that time, he also wrote a memoir of his childhood, Note dintr-un confesional (\\"Notes from a Confessional\\").Martin, p. V‚ÄìVI Around 1915, Fondane was discovered by the journalistic tandem of Tudor Arghezi and Gala Galaction, both of whom were also modernist authors, left-wing militants and Symbolist promoters. The pieces Fondane sent to Arghezi and Galaction's Cronica paper were received with enthusiasm, a reaction which surprised and impressed the young author.Daniel, p. 606‚Äì609 Although his poems went unpublished, his Ia»ôi-themed article A doua capitalƒÉ (\\"The Second Capital\\"), signed Al. Vilara, was featured in an April 1916 issue.Daniel, p. 608‚Äì609 A follower of Arghezi, he was personally involved in raising awareness about Arghezi's unpublished verse, the Agate negre (\\"Black Diamonds\\") cycle.Cernat, p. 15, 56 Remaining close friends with Fondane, Galaction later made persistent efforts of introducing him to critic Garabet IbrƒÉileanu, with the purpose of having him published by the Poporanist Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ review, but IbrƒÉileanu refused to recognize Fondane as an affiliate.Daniel, p. 609, 615‚Äì616; Tomescu (2005), p. 230 Fondane had more success in contacting FlacƒÉra review and its publisher Constantin Banu: on July 23, 1916, it hosted his sonnet EglogƒÉ marinƒÉ (\\"Marine Eglogue\\").Daniel, p. 609 Between 1915 and 1923, Fondane also had a steady contribution to Romanian-language Jewish periodicals (Lumea Evree, Bar-Kochba, Hasmonaea, Hatikvah), where he published translations from international representatives of Yiddish literature (Hayim Nahman Bialik, Semyon Frug, Abraham Reisen etc.) under the signatures B. Wechsler, B. Fundoianu and F. Benjamin.Daniel, p. 610 Fondane also completed work on a translation of the Ahasverus drama, by the Jewish author Herman Heijermans.Cernat, p. 274 Fondane (left) and F. Brunea-Fox, flanking Iosif Ross. 1915 photograph His collaboration with the Bucharest-based Rampa (at the time a daily newspaper) also began in 1915, with his debut as theatrical chronicler, and later with his Carpathian-themed series in the travel writing genre, Pe drumuri de munte (\\"On Mountain Roads\\"). With almost one signed or unsigned piece per issue over the following years, Fondane was one of the more prolific contributors to that newspaper, and frequently made use of either pseudonyms (Diomed, Dio, Funfurpan, Const. Meletie) or initials (B. F., B. Fd., fd.).Daniel, p. 610; Tomescu (2006), p. 122 These included his January 1916 positive review of Plumb, the first major work by Romania's celebrated Symbolist poet, George Bacovia.Daniel, p. 612 =In besieged Moldavia and relocation to Bucharest= In 1917, after Romania joined the Entente side and was invaded by the Central Powers, Fondane was in Ia»ôi, where the Romanian authorities had retreated. It was in this context that he met and befriended the doyen of Romanian Symbolism, poet Ion Minulescu. Minulescu and his wife, author Claudia Millian, had left their home in occupied Bucharest, and, by spring 1917, hosted Fondane at their provisional domicile in Ia»ôi. Millian later recalled that her husband had been much impressed by the Moldavian teenager, describing him as \\"a rare bird\\" and \\"a poet of talent\\".Daniel, p. 611 The same year, at age 52, Isac Wechsler fell ill with typhus and died in Ia»ôi's Sf√¢ntul Spiridon Hospital, leaving his family without financial support.Daniel, p. 596‚Äì597 At around that time, Fondane began work on the poetry cycle Priveli»ôti (\\"Sights\\" or \\"Panoramas\\", finished in 1923).Daniel, p. 612, 614 In 1918, he became one of the contributors to the magazine Chemarea, published in Ia»ôi by the leftist journalist N. D. Cocea, with help from Symbolist writer Ion Vinea. In the political climate marked by the Peace of Bucharest and Romania's remilitarization, Fondane used Cocea's publication to protest against the arrest of Arghezi, who had been accused of collaborationism with the Central Powers.Daniel, p. 612‚Äì613 In this context, Fondane spoke of Arghezi as being \\"Romania's greatest contemporary poet\\" (a verdict which was later to be approved of by mainstream critics).Cernat, p. 139, 149; Daniel, p. 613 According to one account, Fondane also worked briefly as a fact checker for Arena, a periodical managed by Vinea and N. Porsenna.Daniel, p. 613 His time with Chemarea also resulted in the publication of his Biblical-themed short story TƒÉgƒÉduin»õa lui Petru (\\"Peter's Denial\\"). Issued by Chemareas publishing house in 41 bibliophile copies (20 of which remained in Fondane's possession), it opened with the tract O lƒÉmurire despre simbolism (\\"An Explanation of Symbolism\\").Daniel, p. 614 In 1919, upon the war's end, Benjamin Fondane settled in Bucharest, where he stayed until 1923. During this interval, he frequently changed domicile: after a stay at his sister Lina's home in Obor area, he moved on Lahovari Street (near Pia»õa RomanƒÉ), then in Mo»ôilor area, before relocating to VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti (a majority Jewish residential area, where he lived in two successive locations), and ultimately to a house a short distance away from Foi»ôorul de Foc.Daniel, p. 614‚Äì615 Between these changes of address, he established contacts with the Symbolist and avant-garde society of Bucharest: a personal friend of graphic artist Iosif Ross, he formed an informal avant-garde circle of his own, attended by writers F. Brunea-Fox, Ion CƒÉlugƒÉru, Henri Gad, Sa»ôa PanƒÉ, Claude Sernet-Cosma and Ilarie Voronca, as well as by artist-director Armand Pascal (who, in 1920, married Lina Fundoianu).Daniel, p. 614‚Äì615. Some of these names also in RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 16 and Sandqvist, p. 354 PanƒÉ would later note his dominant status within the group, describing him as the \\"stooping green-eyed youth from Ia»ôi, the standard-bearer of the iconoclasts and rebels of the new generation\\".RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 16; Sandqvist, p. 354 The group was occasionally joined by other friends, among them Millian and painter Nicolae Tonitza.Daniel, p. 615 In addition, Fondane and CƒÉlugƒÉru frequented the artistic and literary club established by the controversial Alexandru Bogdan- Pite»ôti, a cultural promoter and political militant whose influence spread over several Symbolist milieus.Cernat, p. 34, 39, 132, 405‚Äì406 In a 1922 piece for Rampa, he remembered Bogdan-Pite»ôti in ambivalent terms: \\"he could not stand moral elevation. [...] He was made of the greatest of joys, in the most purulent of bodies. How many generations of ancient boyars had come to pass, like unworthy dung, for this singular earth to be generated?\\"Cernat, p. 44 Pressed on by his family and the prospects of financial security, Micha√´l Finkenthal, \\"M. Sebastian »ôi B. Fondane: despre identitƒÉ»õi »ôi op»õiuni literare\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 397, October 2007 Fondane contemplated becoming a lawyer. Having passed his baccalaureate examination in Bucharest, he was, according to his own account, a registered student at the University of Ia»ôi Law School, obtaining a graduation certificate but prevented from becoming a licentiate by the opposition of faculty member A. C. Cuza, the antisemitic political figure.Daniel, p. 622 According to a recollection of poet Adrian Maniu, Fondane again worked as a fact checker for some months after his arrival to the capital. His activity as a journalist also allowed him to interview Arnold Davidovich Margolin, statesman of the defunct Ukrainian People's Republic, with whom he discussed the fate of Ukrainian Jews before and after the Soviet Russian takeover. Gina Sebastian Alcalay, \\"Fundoianu, eseist, filozof »ôi profet\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 20/2001 =SburƒÉtorul, Contimporanul, Insula= Over the following years, he restarted his career in the press, contributing to various nationally circulated newspapers: AdevƒÉrul, AdevƒÉrul Literar »ôi Artistic, Cuv√¢ntul Liber, M√¢ntuirea, etc.Daniel, p. 611, 622 The main topics of his interest were literary reviews, essays reviewing the contribution of Romanian and French authors, various art chronicles, and opinion pieces on social or cultural issues.Daniel, p. 611‚Äì612 A special case was his collaboration with M√¢ntuirea, a Zionist periodical founded by Zissu, where, between August and October 1919, he published his studies collection Iudaism »ôi elenism (\\"Judaism and Hellenism\\").Oi»ôteanu, p. 28 These pieces, alternating with similar articles by Galaction, showed how the young man's views in cultural anthropology had been shaped by his relationship with Groper (with whom he nevertheless severed all contacts by 1920). Fondane also renewed his collaboration with Rampa. He and another contributor to the magazine, journalist Tudor Teodorescu-Brani»ôte, carried out a debate in the magazine's pages: Fondane's articles defended Romanian Symbolism against criticism from Teodorescu-Brani»ôte, and offered glimpse into his personal interpretation of Symbolist attitudes. One piece he wrote in 1919, titled Noi, simboli»ôtii (\\"Us Symbolists\\") stated his proud affiliation to the current (primarily defined by him as an artistic transposition of eternal idealism), and comprised the slogan: \\"We are too many not to be strong, and too few not to be intelligent.\\"Tomescu (2005), p. 229‚Äì230 In May 1920, another of his Rampa contributions spoke out against Octavian Goga, Culture Minister of the Alexandru Averescu executive, who contemplated sacking George Bacovia from his office of clerk. The same year, Lumea Evree published his verse drama fragment Monologul lui Baltazar (\\"Belshazzar's Soliloquy\\"). Around the time of his relocation to Bucharest, Fondane first met the moderate modernist critic Eugen Lovinescu, and afterward became both an affiliate of Lovinescu's circle and a contributor to his literary review SburƒÉtorul.Daniel, p. 613‚Äì614, 615; Tomescu (2005), p. 228 Irina Georgescu, \\"DezrƒÉdƒÉcinatul, scriitorul »ôi eroul\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 500, November 2009 Among his first contributions there was a retrospective coverage of the boxing match between Jack Dempsey and Georges Carpentier, which comprised his reflections on the mythical power of sport and the clash of cultures.RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 10 Although a SburƒÉtorist, he was still in contact with Galaction and the left-wing circles. In June 1921, Galaction paid homage to \\"the daring Benjamin\\" in an article for AdevƒÉrul Literar »ôi Artistic, calling attention to Fondane's \\"overwhelming originality.\\"Daniel, p. 616‚Äì617; Martin, p. V A year later, Fondane was employed by Vinea's new venue, the prestigious modernist venue Contimporanul. Having debuted in its first issue with a comment on Romanian translation projects (Ferestre spre Occident, \\"Windows on the Occident\\"),Cernat, p. 132 he was later assigned the theatrical column.Daniel, p. 617 Fondane's work was again featured in FlacƒÉra magazine (at the time under Minulescu's direction): the poem Ce simplu (\\"How Simple\\") and the essay Istoria Ideii (\\"The History of the Idea\\") were both published there in 1922.Daniel, p. 609‚Äì610 The same year, with assistance from fellow novelist Felix Aderca, Fondane grouped his earlier essays on French literature as Imagini »ôi cƒÉr»õi din Fran»õa (\\"Images and Books from France\\"), published by Editura Socec company.Cernat, p. 426; Daniel, p. 611 The book included what was probably the first Romanian study of Marcel Proust's contribution as a novelist. Iulian BƒÉicu»ô, \\"Marcel Proust »ôi rom√¢nii\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 70, June 2001 The author announced that he was planning a similar volume, grouping essays about Romanian writers, both modernists (Minulescu, Bacovia, Arghezi, Maniu, Galaction) and classics (Alexandru Odobescu, Ion CreangƒÉ, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, Anton Pann), but this work was not published in his lifetime.Daniel, p. 611. See also Cernat, p. 227 Also in 1922, Fondane and Pascal set up the theatrical troupe Insula (\\"The Island\\"), which stated its commitment to avant-garde theater. Probably named after Minulescu's earlier Symbolist magazine,Cernat, p. 272; Daniel, p. 617 the group was likely a local replica of Jean Copeau's nonconformist productions in France.Cernat, p. 272 Hosted by the Maison d'Art galleries in Bucharest, the company was joined by, among others, actresses Lina Fundoianu-Pascal and Victoria Mierlescu, and director Sandu Eliad. Other participants were writers (Cocea, PanƒÉ, Zissu, Scarlat Callimachi, MƒÉrgƒÉrita Miller Verghy, Ion Pillat) and theatrical people (George Ciprian, Marietta Sadova, Soare Z. Soare, Dida Solomon, Alice Sturdza, Ionel »öƒÉranu).Cernat, p. 272‚Äì273 Although it stated its goal of revolutionizing the Romanian repertoire (a goal published as an art manifesto in Contimporanul), Insula produced mostly conventional Symbolist and Neoclassical plays: its inaugural shows included Legenda funigeilor (\\"Gossamer Legend\\") by »òtefan Octavian Iosif and Dimitrie Anghel, one of Lord Dunsany's Five Plays and (in Fondane's own translation) Moli√®re's Le M√©decin volant.Daniel, p. 617; Tomescu (2006), p. 125, 126. See also Cernat, p. 271‚Äì274 Probably aiming to enrich this program with samples of Yiddish drama, Fondane began, but never finished, a translation of S. Ansky's The Dybbuk. The troupe ceased its activity in 1923, partly because of significant financial difficulties, and partly because of a rise in antisemitic activities, which put its Jewish performers at risk.Daniel, p. 618; Sandqvist, p. 355 For a while, Insula survived as a conference group, hosting modernist lectures on classical Romanian literature‚Äîwith the participation of Symbolist and post- Symbolist authors such as Aderca, Arghezi, Millian, Pillat, Vinea, N. Davidescu, Perpessicius, and Fondane himself.Daniel, p. 618. See also Cernat, p. 273 He was at the time working on his own play, Filoctet (\\"Philoctetes\\", later finished as Philoct√®te).Micha√´l Finkenthal, \\"Benjamin Fondane √Æn Argentina\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 299, December 2005 =Move to France= Armand Pascal's self-portrait and last known depiction (1929) In 1923, Benjamin Fondane eventually left Romania for France, spurred on by the need to prove himself within a different cultural context.Cernat, p. 36‚Äì37, 211, 408‚Äì409; Daniel, p. 598; RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 13, 131‚Äì132; Tomescu (2005), p. 228‚Äì229; (2006), p. 121, 123 Constantin Pricop, \\"B. Fundoianu »ôi literatura rom√¢nƒÉ\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 27/2004 He was at the time interested in the success of Dada, an avant-garde movement launched abroad by the Romanian-born author Tristan Tzara, in collaboration with several others.RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 14‚Äì15, 137‚Äì139 Not dissuaded by the fact that his sister and brother-in-law (the Pascals) had returned impoverished from an extended stay in Paris, Fondane crossed Europe by train and partly by foot.Daniel, p. 618‚Äì620 The writer (who adopted his Francized name shortly after leaving his native country)CƒÉlinescu, p. 864; Sandqvist, p. 354 Michel Carassou, \\"Fondane ‚Äì Maritain. Coresponden»õa\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 410, February 2008 was eventually joined there by the Pascals. The three of them continued to lead a bohemian and at times precarious existence, discussed in Fondane's correspondence with Romanian novelist Liviu Rebreanu,Daniel, p. 619‚Äì621, 623 and described by researcher Ana-Maria Tomescu as \\"humiliating poverty\\".Tomescu (2006), p. 122 The poet acquired some sources of income from his contacts in Romania: in exchange for his contribution to the circulation of Romanian literature in France, he received official funds from the Culture Ministry's directorate (at the time headed by Minulescu); in addition, he published unsigned articles in various newspapers, and even relied on handouts from Romanian actress Elvira Popescu (who visited his home, as did avant-garde painter M. H. Maxy).Daniel, p. 620‚Äì623 He also translated into French Zissu's novel Amintirile unui candelabru (\\"The Recollections of a Chandelier\\"). For a while, the poet also joined his colleague Ilarie Voronca on the legal department of L'Abeille insurance company. After a period of renting furnished rooms, Fondane accepted an offer from Jean, brother of the deceased literary theorist Remy de Gourmont, and, employed as a librarian-concierge, moved into the Gourmonts' museum property on Rue des Saints-P√®res, some distance away from to the celebrated literary caf√© Les Deux Magots.Daniel, p. 621‚Äì622, 624 In the six years before Pascal's 1929 death, Fondane left Gourmont's house and, with his sister and brother-in-law, moved into a succession of houses (on Rue Domat, Rue Jacob, Rue Monge), before settling into a historical building once inhabited by author Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (Rue Rollin, 6).Daniel, p. 624 Complaining about eye trouble and exhaustion, and several times threatened with insolvency, Fondane often left Paris for the resort of Arcachon.Daniel, p. 623‚Äì624 Claudia Millian, who was also spending time in Paris, described Fondane's new focus on studying Christian theology and Catholic thought, from Hildebert to Gourmont's own Latin mystique (it was also at this stage that the Romanian writer acquired and sent home part of Gourmont's bibliophile collection).Daniel, p. 621‚Äì622 He coupled these activities with an interest in grouping together the cultural segments of the Romanian diaspora: around 1924, he and Millian were founding members of the Society of Romanian Writers in Paris, presided upon by the aristocrat Elena VƒÉcƒÉrescu. Meanwhile, Fondane acquired a profile on the local literary scene, and, in his personal notes, claimed to have had his works praised by novelist Andr√© Gide and philosopher Jules de Gaultier. They both were his idols: Gide's work had shaped his own contribution in the prose poem genre, while Gaultier did the same for his philosophical outlook. The self-exiled debutant was nevertheless still viewing his career with despair, describing it as languishing, and noting that there was a chance of him failing to earn a solid literary reputation.Tomescu (2005), p. 228; (2006), p. 121 =Surrealist episode= The mid-1920s brought Benjamin Fondane's affiliation with Surrealism, the post-Dada avant-garde current centered in Paris. Fondane also rallied with Belgian Surrealist composers E. L. T. Mesens and Andr√© Souris (with whom he signed a manifesto on modernist music), and supported Surrealist poet-director Antonin Artaud in his efforts to set up a theater named after Alfred Jarry (which was not, however, an all-Surrealist venue).RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 136, 137, 142 In this context, he tried to persuade the French Surrealist group to tour his native country and establish contacts with local affiliates.Sandqvist, p. 217 By 1926, Fondane grew disenchanted with the communist alignment proposed by the main Surrealist faction and its mentor, Andr√© Breton. Writing at the time, he commented that the ideological drive could prove fatal: \\"Perhaps never again will [a poet] recover that absolute freedom that he had in the bourgeois republic.\\"RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 50, 154David Gascoyne, Benjamin Fondane, Roger Scott, \\"David Gascoyne & Benjamin Fondane (David Gascoyne et Benjamin Fondane v.o.)\\", in Temporel, Nr. 9, April 26, 2010 A few years later, the Romanian writer expressed his support for the anti-Breton dissidents of Le Grand Jeu magazine, and was a witness at the 1930 riot which opposed the two factions.RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 68‚Äì69, 136‚Äì137 His anti-communist discourse was again aired in 1932: commenting on indictment of Surrealist poet Louis Aragon for communist texts (read by the authorities as instigation to murder), Fondane stated that he did believe Aragon's case was covered by the freedom of speech.RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 71‚Äì75, 136 Ion Simu»õ, \\"Libertatea spiritului creator\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 29/2005 His ideas also brought him into conflict with Pierre Drieu La Rochelle, who was moving away from an avant- garde background and into the realm of far right ideas. Silvia Baron Supervielle, \\"L'Argentine n'oublie pas Benjamin Fondane\\", in Les Lettres Fran√ßaises, Nr. 67, January 2010, p. 5 By the early 1930s, Fondane was in contact with the mainstream modernist Jacques Rivi√®re and his Nouvelle Revue Fran√ßaise circle. In 1928, his own collaboration with the Surrealists took shape as the book Trois scenarii: cin√©-po√®mes (\\"Three Scenarios: Cine-poems\\"), published by Documents internationaux de l'esprit nouveau collection, with artwork by American photographer Man Ray and Romanian painter Alexandru BrƒÉtƒÉ»ôanuDaniel, p. 623. See also: Cernat, p. 287, 289; RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 16, 18, 20, 136, 138, 143 (one of his other contacts in the French Surrealist photographers' group was Eli Lotar, the illegitimate son of Arghezi).Cernat, p. 56 The \\"cine-poems\\" were intentionally conceived as unfilmable screenplays, in what was his personal statement about artistic compromise between experimental film and the emerging worldwide film industry.Andrew, p. 139‚Äì140 The book notably comprised his verdict about cinema being \\"the only art that was never classical.\\"RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 16 =Philosophical debut= With time, Fondane became a contributor to newspapers or literary journals in France, Belgium, and Switzerland: a regular presence in Cahiers du Sud of Carcassonne, he had his work featured in the Surrealist press (Discontinuit√©, Le Phare de Neuilly, Bifur), as well as in Le Courrier des Po√®tes, Le Journal des Po√®tes, Romain Rolland's Europe, Paul Val√©ry's Commerce etc.Daniel, p. 624‚Äì625. See also: RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 70, 135, 142, 159; Sitman, p. 117 In addition, Fondane's research was hosted by specialized venues such as Revue Philosophique, Schweizer Annalen and Carlo Suar√®s' Cahiers de l'√âtoile. After a long period of indecision, the Romanian poet became a dedicated follower of Lev Shestov, a Russian-born existentialist thinker whose ideas about the eternal opposition between faith and reason he expanded upon in later texts.Jordan Strump, note to Queneau, p. 214 According to intellectual historian Samuel Moyn, Fondane was, with Rachel Bespaloff, one of the \\"most significant and devoted of Shestov's followers\\".Moyn, p. 173 In 1929, as a frequenter of Shestov's circle, Fondane also met Argentinian female author Victoria Ocampo, who became his close friend (after 1931, he became a contributor to her modernist review, Sur). Fondane's essays were more frequently than before philosophical in nature: Europe published his tribute Shestov (January 1929) and his comments of Edmund Husserl's phenomenology, which included his own critique of rationalism (June 1930). Invited (on Ocampo's initiative)Cernat, p. 226; Sitman, p. 117 by the Amigos del Arte society of Buenos Aires, Fondane left for Argentina and Uruguay in summer 1929. The object of his visit was promoting French cinema with a set of lectures in Buenos Aires, Montevideo and other cities (as he later stated in a Rampa interview with Sarina Cassvan-Pas, he introduced South Americans to the work of Germaine Dulac, Luis Bu√±uel and Henri Gad).Cernat, p. 226 In this context, Fondane met essayist Eduardo Mallea, who invited him to contribute in La Naci√≥ns literary supplement. His other activities there included conferencing on Shestov at the University of Buenos Aires and publishing articles on several subjects (from Shestov's philosophy to the poems of Tzara), but the fees received in return were, in his own account, too small to cover the cost of decent living.Daniel, p. 625‚Äì626 In October 1929, Fondane was back in Paris, where he focused on translating and popularizing some of Romanian literature's milestone texts, from Mihai Eminescu's SƒÉrmanul Dionis to the poetry of Ion Barbu, Minulescu, Arghezi and Bacovia.Daniel, p. 626. See also: Cernat, p. 227; Tomescu (2005), p. 230 In the same context, the expatriate writer helped introduce Romanians to some of the new European tendencies, becoming, in the words of literary historian Paul Cernat, \\"the first important promoter of French Surrealism in Romanian culture.\\"Cernat, p. 287 =Integral and unu= In the mid-1920s, Fondane and painter J√°nos Mattis- Teutsch joined the external editorial board of Integral magazine, an avant- garde tribune published in Bucharest by Ion CƒÉlugƒÉru, F. Brunea-Fox and Voronca.Cernat, p. 222; RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 167; Sandqvist, p. 355 He was assigned a permanent column, known as Fen√™tres sur l'Europe/Ferestre spre Europa (French and Romanian for \\"Windows on Europe\\").Cernat, p. 222 With Barbu Florian, Fondane became a leading film reviewer for the magazine, pursuing his agenda in favor of non-commercial and \\"pure\\" films (such as Ren√© Clair's Entr'acte), and praising Charlie Chaplin for his lyricism, but later making some concessions to talkies and the regular Hollywood films.Cernat, p. 286‚Äì289, 292 Exploring what he defined as \\"the great ballet of contemporary French poetry\\", Fondane also published individual notes on writers Aragon, Jean Cocteau, Joseph Delteil, Paul √âluard and Pierre Reverdy.Cernat, p. 287‚Äì288; RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 17, 33‚Äì45, 53‚Äì61 In 1927, Integral also hosted one of Fondane's replies to the communist Surrealists in France, as Le surr√©alisme et la r√©volution (\\"Surrealism and Revolution\\").RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 18, 46‚Äì52, 139, 143 Ion Pop, \\"Avangarda rom√¢neascƒÉ »ôi politica\\" , in Tribuna, Nr. 76, November 2005, p. 14 He also came into contact with unu, the Surrealist venue of Bucharest, which was edited by several of his avant- garde friends at home. His contributions there included a text on Tzara's post-Dada works, which he analyzed as Val√©ry-like \\"pure poetry\\".Cernat, p. 153, 288; RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 17‚Äì18, 62‚Äì67 In December 1928, unu published some of Fondane's messages home, as Scrisori pierdute (\\"Lost Letters\\").Daniel, p. 609, 628 Between 1931 and 1934, Fondane was in regular correspondence with the unu writers, in particular Stephan Roll, F. Brunea-Fox and Sa»ôa PanƒÉ, being informed about their conflict with Voronca (attacked as a betrayer of the avant-garde) and witnessing from afar the eventual implosion of Romanian Surrealism on the model of French groups.RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 92‚Äì122 In such dialogues, Roll complains about right-wing political censorship in Romania, and speaks in some detail about his own conversion to Marxism. Micha√´l Finkenthal, \\"Ce s-a √Ænt√Æmplat cu 'algi»ôtii' √Æn 1933?\\" , in Apostrof, Nr. 1/2007; RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 94‚Äì95, 112‚Äì117 With Fondane's approval and Minulescu's assistance, Priveli»ôti also saw print in Romania during 1930. Published by Editura Cultura Na»õionalƒÉ, it sparked significant controversy with its nonconformist style, but also made the author the target of critics' interest.Daniel, p. 595, 626‚Äì627 As a consequence, Fondane was also sending material to Isac Ludo's Adam review, most of it notes (some hostile) clarifying ambiguous biographical detail discussed in Aderca's chronicle to Priveli»ôti.Daniel, p. 618, 622 His profile within the local avant-garde was also acknowledged in Italy and Germany: the Milanese magazine Fiera Letteraria commented on his poetry, reprinting fragments originally featured in Integral; Dan Gulea, \\"Activ, retroactiv\\" , in Apostrof, Nr. 8/2007 in its issue of August‚ÄìSeptember 1930, the Expressionist tribune Der Sturm published samples of his works, alongside those of nine other Romanian modernists, translated by Leopold Kosch.Grigorescu, p. 389 As Paul Daniel notes, the polemics surrounding Priveli»ôti only lasted for a year, and Fondane was largely forgotten by the Romanian public after this moment.Daniel, p. 627 However, the discovery of Fondane's avant-garde stance by traditionalist circles took the form of bemusement or indignation, which lasted into the next decades. The conservative critic Const. I. Emilian, whose 1931 study discussed modernism as a psychiatric condition, mentioned Fondane as one of the leading \\"extremists\\", and deplored his abandonment of traditionalist subjects.Cernat, p. 299, 307‚Äì308, 310 Some nine years later, the antisemitic far right newspaper SfarmƒÉ-PiatrƒÉ, through the voice of Ovidiu Papadima, accused Fondane and \\"the Jews\\" of having purposefully maintained \\"the illusion of a literary movement\\" under Lovinescu's leadership.Z. Ornea, Anii treizeci. Extrema dreaptƒÉ rom√¢neascƒÉ, Editura Funda»õiei Culturale Rom√¢ne, Bucharest, 1995, p. 439. Nevertheless, before that date, Lovinescu himself had come to criticize his former pupil (a disagreement which echoed his larger conflict with the unu group).Cernat, p. 299, 308 Also in the 1930s, Fondane's work received coverage in the articles of two other maverick modernists: Perpessicius, who viewed it with noted sympathy, and Lucian Boz, who found his new poems touched by \\"prolixity\\".Cernat, p. 324, 336 =Rimbaud le voyou, Ulysse and intellectual prominence= Back in France, where he had become Shestov's assistant, Lucian Raicu, \\"Posomor√¢ta carte\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 1/2008 Fondane was beginning work on other books: the essay on 19th-century poet Arthur Rimbaud‚ÄîRimbaud le voyou (\\"Rimbaud the Hoodlum\\")‚Äîand, despite an earlier pledge not to return to poetry, a new series of poems. His eponymously titled study-portrait of German philosopher Martin Heidegger was published by Cahiers du Sud in 1932.Daniel, p. 630 Despite his earlier rejection of commercial films, Fondane eventually became an employee of Paramount Pictures, probably spurred on by his need to finance a personal projectAndrew, p. 139‚Äì140; Cernat, p. 287 (reputedly, he was accepted there with a second application, his first one having been rejected in 1929). He worked first as an assistant director, before turning to screenwriting. Preserving his interest in Romanian developments, he visited the Paris set of Televiziune,Daniel, p. 643 a Romanian cinema production for which he shared directorial credits. His growing interest in Voronca's own poetry led him to review it for Tudor Arghezi's Bucharest periodical, Bilete de Papagal, where he stated: \\"Mr. Ilarie Voronca is at the top of his form. I'm gladly placing my stakes on him.\\"Daniel, p. 628 In 1931, the poet married Genevi√®ve Tissier, a trained jurist and lapsed Catholic. Their home on Rue Rollin subsequently became a venue for literary sessions, mostly grouping the Cahiers du Sud contributors. The aspiring author Paul Daniel, who became Rodica Wechsler's husband in 1935, attended such meetings with his wife, and recalls having met Gaultier, filmmaker Dimitri Kirsanoff, music critic Boris de Schl√∂zer, poets Yanette Del√©tang-Tardif and Th√©r√®se Aubray, as well as Shestov's daughter Natalie Baranoff.Daniel, p. 627‚Äì628, 631 Fondane also enjoyed a warm friendship with Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, the Romanian-born modern sculptor, visiting Br√¢ncu»ôi's workshop on an almost daily basis and writing about his work in Cahiers de l'√âtoile.Daniel, p. 628. See also RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 16, 20 He witnessed first-hand and described Br√¢ncu»ôi's primitivist techniques, likening his work to that of a \\"savage man\\".Sandqvist, p. 250 Rimbaud le voyou was eventually published by Deno√´l & Steele company in 1933, the same year when Fondane published his poetry volume Ulysse (\\"Ulysses\\") with Les Cahiers du Journal des Po√®tes.Daniel, p. 627‚Äì628, 641 The Rimbaud study, partly written as a reply to Roland de Ren√©ville's monograph Rimbaud le Voyant (\\"Rimbaud the Seer\\"), consolidated Fondane's international reputation as a critic and literary historian. In the months after its publication, the book earned much praise from scholars and writers‚Äîfrom Jo√´ Bousquet, Jean Cocteau, Benedetto Croce and Louis-Ferdinand C√©line,Daniel, p. 629‚Äì630 to Jean Cassou, Guillermo de TorreDaniel, p. 629 and Miguel de Unamuno. It also found admirers in the English poet David Gascoyne, who was afterward in correspondence with Fondane, and the American novelist Henry Miller. Ulysse itself illustrated Fondane's interest in scholarly issues: he sent one autographed copy to Ra√Øssa Maritain, wife of Jacques Maritain (both of whom were Catholic thinkers).Viotto, p. 111 Shortly after this period, the author was surprised to read Voronca's own French-language volume Ulysse dans la cit√© (\\"Ulysses in the City\\"): although puzzled by the similarity of titles with his own collection, he described Voronca as a \\"great poet.\\"Daniel, p. 628. For the original dispute between Fondane and Voronca, see RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 93‚Äì96 Also then, in Romania, B. Iosif completed the Yiddish translation of Fondane's Psalmul leprosului (\\"The Leper's Psalm\\"). The text, left in his care by Fondane before his 1923 departure, was first published in Di Woch, a periodical set up in Romania by poet Yankev Shternberg (October 31, 1934).Daniel, p. 598 =Anti-fascist causes and filming of Rapt= The 1933 establishment of a Nazi regime in Germany brought Fondane into the camp of anti-fascism. In December 1934, his Apelul studen»õimii (\\"The Call of Students\\") was circulated among the Romanian diaspora, and featured passionate calls for awareness: \\"Tomorrow, in concentration camps, it will be too late\\".Daniel, p. 631 √âdouard Launet, \\"Dans les petits papiers de Fondane\\", in Lib√©ration, November 16, 2009 The following year, he outlined his critique of all kinds of totalitarianism, L'√âcrivain devant la r√©volution (\\"The Writer Facing the Revolution\\"), supposed to be delivered in front of the Paris-held International Congress of Writers for the Defense of Culture (organized by left-wing and communist intellectuals with support from the Soviet Union).RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 16, 20, 136 Micha√´l Finkenthal, \\"Fundoianu »ôi duminica istoriei\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 322, May 2006 According to historian Martin Stanton, Fondane's activity in film, like Jean-Paul Sartre's parallel beginnings as a novelist, was itself a political statement in support of the Popular Front: \\"[they were] hoping to introduce critical dimensions in the fields they felt the fascists had colonized.\\"Stanton, p. 259‚Äì260 Fondane nevertheless ridiculed the communist version of pacifism as a \\"parade of big words\\", noting that it opposed mere slogans to concrete German re-armament. Writing for the film magazine Les Cahiers Jaunes in 1933, he expressed the ambition of creating \\"an absurd film about something absurd, to satisfy [one's] absurd taste for freedom\\". Fondane left the Paramount studios the same year, disappointed with company policies and without having had any screen credit of his own (although, he claimed, there were over 100 Paramount scripts to which he had unsigned contributions).Andrew, p. 140, 371 During 1935, he and Kirsanoff were in Switzerland, for the filming of Rapt, with a screenplay by Fondane (adapted from Charles Ferdinand Ramuz's La s√©paration des races novel).Andrew, p. 42, 158‚Äì161; Cernat, p. 287; Daniel, p. 628, 630 The result was a highly poetic production, and, despite Fondane's still passionate defense of silent film, the first talkie in Kirsanoff's career.Andrew, p. 42, 140, 158‚Äì161 The poet was enthusiastic about this collaboration, claiming that it had enjoyed a good reception from Spain to Canada, standing as a manifesto against the success of more \\"chatty\\" sound films.Daniel, p. 628. See also Andrew, p. 140 In particular, French critics and journalists hailed Rapt as a necessary break with the com√©die en vaudeville tradition.Andrew, p. 159 In the end, however, the independent product could not compete with the Hollywood industry, which was at the time monopolizing the French market.Andrew, p. 42 In parallel with these events, Fondane followed Shestov's personal guidance and, by means of Cahiers du Sud, attacked philosopher Jean Wahl's secular reinterpretation of S√∏ren Kierkegaard's Christian existentialism.Moyn, p. 180‚Äì181 =From Tararira to World War II= Despite selling many copies of his books and having Rapt played at the Panth√©on Cinema, Benjamin Fondane was still facing major financial difficulties, accepting a 1936 offer to write and assist in the making of Tararira, an avant-garde musical product of the Argentine film industry.Daniel, p. 630‚Äì633, 643‚Äì644 This was his second option: initially, he contemplated filming a version of Ricardo G√ºiraldes' Don Segundo Sombra, but met opposition from G√ºiraldes' widow. While en route to Argentina, he became friends with Georgette Gaucher, a Breton woman, with whom he was in correspondence for the rest of his life. Under contract with the Falma-film company, Fondane was received with honors by the Romanian Argentine community, and, with the unusual cut of his preferred suit, is said to have even become a trendsetter in local fashion.Daniel, p. 631‚Äì632 For Ocampo and the Sur staff, literary historian Rosalie Sitman notes, his visit also meant an occasion to defy the xenophobic and antisemitic agenda of Argentine nationalist circles.Sitman, p. 117‚Äì118 Centered on the tango,Sitman, p. 117 Fondane's film enlisted contributions from some leading figures in several national film and music industries, having Miguel Machinandiarena as producer and John Alton as editor; in starred, among others, Orestes Caviglia, Miguel G√≥mez Bao and Iris Marga. The manner in which Tararira approached its subject scandalized the Argentine public, and it was eventually rejected by its distributorsCernat, p. 287; RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 136 (no copies survive, but writer Gloria Alcorta, who was present at a private screening, rated it a \\"masterpiece\\"). Fondane, who had earlier complained about the actors' resistance to his ideas, left Argentina before the film was actually finished. It was on his return trip that he met Jacques and Ra√Øssa Maritain, with whom he and Genevi√®ve became good friends. With the money received in Buenos Aires, the writer contemplated returning on a visit to Romania, but he abandoned all such projects later in 1936, instead making his way to France.Daniel, p. 632‚Äì633 He followed up on his publishing activity in 1937, when his selected poems, Titanic, saw print.Daniel, p. 627, 629 Encouraged by the reception given to Rimbaud le voyou, he published two more essays with Deno√´l & Steele: La Conscience malheureuse (\\"The Unhappy Consciousness\\", 1937) and Faux trait√© d'esth√©tique (\\"False Treatise of Aesthetics\\", 1938).Daniel, p. 630, 633 In 1938, he was working on a collected edition of his Ferestre spre Europa, supposed to be published in Bucharest but never actually seeing print. At around that date, Fondane was also a presenter for the Romanian edition of 20th Century Fox's international newsreel, Movietone News.Daniel, p. 633 In 1939, Fondane was naturalized French. This followed an independent initiative of the Soci√©t√© des √©crivains fran√ßais professional association, in recognition for his contribution to French letters. Cahiers du Sud collected the required 3,000 francs fee through a public subscription, enlisting particularly large contributions from music producer Renaud de Jouvenel (brother of Bertrand de Jouvenel) and philosopher-ethnologist Lucien L√©vy-Bruhl.Daniel, p. 633‚Äì634 Only months after this event, with the outbreak of World War II, Fondane was drafted into the French Army. During most of the \\"Phoney War\\" interval, considered too old for active service, he was in the military reserve force, but in February 1940 was called under arms with the 216 Artillery Regiment.Daniel, p. 634‚Äì635 According to Lina, \\"he left [home] with unimaginable courage and faith.\\"Daniel, p. 634 Stationed at the Sainte Assise Castle in Seine-Port, he edited and stenciled a humorous gazette, L'√âcho de la I C-ie (\\"The 1st Company Echo\\"), where he also published his last-ever work of poetry, Le po√®te en patrouille (\\"The Poet on Patrolling Duty\\").Daniel, p. 634, 644 =First captivity and clandestine existence= Fondane was captured by the Germans in June 1940 (shortly before the fall of France), and was taken into a German camp as a prisoner of war.Daniel, p. 635‚Äì636; RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 133 He managed to escape captivity, but was recaptured in short time.RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 133 After falling ill with appendicitis, he was transported back to Paris, kept in custody at the Val-de-Gr√¢ce, and operated on.Daniel, p. 635‚Äì636. See also RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 124, 133 Fondane was eventually released, the German occupiers having decided that he was no longer fit for soldierly duty. He was working on two poetry series, Super Flumina Babylonis (a reference to Psalm 137) and L'Exode (\\"The Exodus\\"), as well as on his last essay, focusing on 19th-century poet Charles Baudelaire, and titled Baudelaire et l'exp√©rience du gouffre (\\"Baudelaire and the Experience of the Abyss\\").Daniel, p. 630, 639‚Äì640 In addition to these, his other French texts, incomplete or unpublished by 1944, include: the poetic drama pieces Philoct√®te, Les Puits de Maule (\\"Maule's Well\\", an adaptation of Nathaniel Hawthorne's The House of the Seven Gables) and Le F√©stin de Balthazar (\\"Belshazzar's Feast\\"); a study about the life and work of Romanian-born philosopher St√©phane Lupasco; and the selection from his interviews with Shestov, Sur les rives de l'Illisus (\\"On the Banks of the Illisus\\").Daniel, p. 641. See also Cernat, p. 274 His very last text is believed to be a philosophical essay, Le Lundi existentiel (\\"The Existential Monday\\"), on which Fondane was working in 1944.

MƒÉrturii ale unei prietenii necunoscute: Emil Cioran »ôi Benjamin Fondane\\" , in Apostrof, Nr. 8/2009 Little is known about Prov√®rbes (\\"Proverbs\\"), which, he announced in 1933, was supposed to be an independent collection of poems.Daniel, p. 641 According to various accounts, Fondane made a point of not leaving Paris, despite the growing restrictions and violence. However, others note that, as a precaution against the antisemitic measures in the occupied north, he eventually made his way into the more permissive zone libre, and only made returns to Paris in order to collect his books.Daniel, p. 636 Andrei Oi»ôteanu, \\"Editarea operei lui Fundoianu. O polemicƒÉ paguboasƒÉ (de ziua Holocaustului)\\" , in Revista 22, Nr. 970, October 2008 Throughout this interval, the poet refused to wear the yellow badge (mandatory for Jews),Chitrit, p. 60 and, living in permanent risk, isolated himself from his wife, adopting an even more precarious lifestyle. He was still in contact with writers of various ethnic backgrounds, and active on the clandestine literary scene. In this context, Fondane stated his intellectual affiliation to the French Resistance: his former Surrealist colleague Paul √âluard published several of his poems in the pro-communist Europe, under the name of Isaac Laquedem (a nod to the Wandering Jew myth).Daniel, p. 625. See also Oi»ôteanu, p. 341 Such pieces were later included, but left unsigned, in the anthology L'Honneur des po√®tes (\\"The Honor of Poets\\"), published by the Resistance activists as an anti-Nazi manifesto.Daniel, p. 640. See also RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 134 Fondane also preserved his column in Cahiers du Sud for as long as it was possible, and had his contributions published in several other clandestine journals. After 1941, Fondane became friends with another Romanian existentialist in France, the younger Emil Cioran. Their closeness signaled an important stage in the latter's career: Cioran was slowly moving away from his fascist sympathies and his antisemitic stance, and, although still connected to the revolutionary fascist Iron Guard, had reintroduced cosmopolitanism to his own critique of Romanian society. »öicu Goldstein, \\"√éntre C√©line »ôi Cioran\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 506‚Äì507, December 2009 Z. Ornea, \\"Opera rom√¢neascƒÉ a lui Cioran\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 21/2000 In 1943, transcending ideological boundaries, Fondane also had dinner with Mircea Eliade, the Romanian novelist and philosopher, who, like their common friend Cioran, had an ambiguous connection with the far right.Steven M. Wasserstrom, Religion after Religion: Gershom Scholem, Mircea Eliade, and Henry Corbin at Eranos, Princeton University Press, Princeton & Chichester, 1999, p. 101. In 1942, his own Romanian citizenship rights, granted by the Jewish emancipation of the early 1920s, were lost with the antisemitic legislation adopted by the Ion Antonescu regime, Adrian Niculescu, \\"Destinul excep»õional al lui Alexandru »òafran\\" , in Observator Cultural, Nr. 523, May 2010 which also officially banned his entire work as \\"Jewish\\".

At around that time, his old friends outside France made unsuccessful efforts to obtain him a safe conduct to neutral countries. Such initiatives were notably taken by Jacques Maritain from his new home in the United States and by Victoria Ocampo in Argentina.Sitman, p. 125 =Deportation and death= He was eventually arrested by collaborationist forces in spring 1944, after unknown civilians reported his Jewish origin.Daniel, p. 636; RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 133 Dieter Schlesak, \\"Fondane ‚Äì martor la grani»õa imagina»õiei noastre\\" , in Apostrof, Nr. 4/2009 Held in custody by the Gestapo, he was assigned to the local network of Holocaust perpetrators: after internment in the Drancy transit camp, he was sent on one of the transports to the extermination camps in occupied Poland, reaching Auschwitz-Birkenau. In the meantime, his family and friends remained largely unaware of his fate.Daniel, p. 637 After news of his arrest, several of his friends reportedly intervened to save him, including Cioran, Lupasco and writer Jean Paulhan. According to some accounts, such efforts may have also involved another one of Cioran's friends, essayist Eug√®ne Ionesco (later known for his work in drama). Ion Vianu, \\"Fragmente dintr-un jurnal de lecturƒÉ\\" , in Revista 22, Nr. 637, May 2002 Accounts differ on what happened to his sister Lina. Paul Daniel believes that she decided to go looking for her brother, also went missing, and, in all probability, became a victim of another deportation. Other sources state that she was arrested at around the same time as, or even together with, her brother, and that they were both on the same transport to Auschwitz.CƒÉlinescu, p. 864; RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 133 According to other accounts, Fondane was in custody while his sister was not, and sent her a final letter from Drancy; Fondane, who had theoretical legal grounds for being spared deportation (a Christian wife), aware that Lina could not invoke them, sacrificed himself to be by her side. While in Drancy, he sent another letter, addressed to Genevi√®ve, in which he asked for all his French poetry to be published in the future as Le Mal des fant√¥mes (\\"The Ache of Phantoms\\"). Luiza Palanciuc, \\"Benjamin Fondane: urme, scrisori, mƒÉrturii\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 410, February 2008 \\"Golden Gate »ôi fratele lui Rimbaud\\", in Dilema Veche, Nr. 170, May 2007 Optimistically, Fondane referred to himself as \\"the traveler who isn't done traveling\\". While Lina is believed to have been marked for death upon arrival (and immediately after sent to the gas chamber), her brother survived the camp conditions for a few more months. He befriended two Jewish doctors, Moscovici and Klein, with whom he spent his free moments engaged in passionate discussions about philosophy and literature. As was later attested by a survivor of the camp, the poet himself was among the 700 inmates selected for extermination on October 2, 1944, when the Birkenau subsection outside Brzezinka was being evicted by SS guards.Daniel, p. 637‚Äì638 He was aware of impending death, and reportedly saw it as ironic that it came so near to an expected Allied victory. After a short interval in Block 10, where he is said to have awaited his death with dignity and courage, he was driven to the gas chamber and murdered.Daniel, p. 638 His body was cremated, along with those of the other victims. Literary work and philosophical contribution =Symbolist and traditionalist beginnings= As a young writer, Benjamin Fondane moved several times between the extremes of Symbolism and Neoromantic traditionalism. Literary historian Mircea Martin analyzed the very first of his as pastiches of several, sometimes contradictory, literary sources. These influences, he notes, come from local traditionalists, Romantics and Neoromantics‚ÄîOctavian Goga (the inspiration for Fondane's earliest pieces), Grigore Alexandrescu, Vasile Alecsandri, George Co»ôbuc, »òtefan Octavian Iosif; from French Symbolists‚ÄîPaul Verlaine; and from Romanian disciples of Symbolism‚ÄîDimitrie Anghel, George Bacovia, Alexandru Macedonski, Ion Minulescu.Martin, p. VII‚ÄìXIV, XXIV The young author had a special appreciation for the 19th century national poet, Mihai Eminescu. Familiar with Eminescu's entire poetic work, he was one of the young poets who tried to reconcile Eminescu's Neoromantic, ruralizing, traditionalism with the urban phenomenon that was Symbolism.Cernat, p. 11, 36; Tomescu (2005), p. 230‚Äì231. Of the traditionalist poems he composed under such influences, the few explicitly patriotic ones have been deemed \\"extreme in their conventionalism\\" by Cernat: \\"Totu»ôi, poezia patrioticƒÉ\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 100, January 2002 While Fondane continued to credit Minulescu's radical and jocular Symbolism as a main influence on his own poems, this encounter was overall less significant than his enthusiasm for Eminescu;Tomescu (2005), p. 231 in contrast, Bacovia's desolate and macabre poetry left enduring traces in Fondane's work, shaping his depiction of provincial environments and even transforming his worldview.Cernat, p. 37‚Äì38, 398; Martin, p. XIII, XXXIV; Tomescu (2005), p. 228, 231‚Äì232 Gheorghe CrƒÉciun, \\"√éntre poeticitate »ôi pragmatism\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 47, January 2001 Fondane's early affiliation with Ovid Densusianu's version of Romania's Symbolist current was, according to literary historian Dumitru Micu, superficial. Micu notes that the young Fondane sent his verse to be published by magazines with incompatible agendas, suggesting that his collaboration with Viea»õa NouƒÉ was therefore incidental, but also that, around 1914, Fondane's own style was a \\"conventional Symbolism\\". Writing in 1915, the poet himself explained that his time with the magazine in question ought not be interpreted as anything other than conjectural. During his polemic with Tudor Teodorescu- Brani»ôte, he defined himself as an advocate of an \\"insolent\\" Symbolism, a category defined by and around Remy de Gourmont. This perspective was further clarified in O lƒÉmurire..., which explained how TƒÉgƒÉduin»õa lui Petru was to be read: \\"A clear, although Symbolist, book. For it is, unmistakably, Symbolist. [...] Symbolism doesn't necessarily mean neologism, morbid, bizarre, decadent, confusing and badly written. But rather‚Äîif there is talent‚Äîoriginal, commonsensical, depth, non-imitation, lack of standard, subconscious, new and sometimes healthy.\\" From a regional point of view, the young Fondane is sometimes included with Bacovia in the Moldavian branch of Romanian Symbolism, or, more particularly, in the Jewish Moldavian subsection.Cernat, p. 16‚Äì17, 37 The various stylistic directions of Fondane's early poetry came together in Priveli»ôti. Mircea Martin reads in it the poet's emancipation from both Symbolism and traditionalism, despite it being opened with a dedication to Minulescu, and against Eugen Lovinescu's belief that such pastorals were exclusively traditionalist.Martin, p. XIV‚ÄìXV According to Martin, Priveli»ôti parts from its Romantic predecessors by abandoning the \\"descriptive\\" and \\"sentimentalist\\" in pastoral conventions: \\"Everything seems designed on purpose to confound and defy the traditional mindset.\\"Martin, p. XV Similarly, writer-critic Gheorghe CrƒÉciun found the Priveli»ôti texts contiguous with other early forms of Romanian modernism. Nevertheless, much of the volume still adheres to lyricism and the conventional idyll format, primarily by identifying itself with the slow rhythms of country life.Cernat, p. 36‚Äì37, 308, 310, 324, 398; Grigorescu, p. 419‚Äì420; Martin, p. XXIII‚ÄìXXXI; Tomescu (2005), p. 229 These traits were subsumed by literary historian George CƒÉlinescu into a special category, that of \\"traditionalist Symbolism\\", centered on \\"that which brings man closer to Creation's interior life\\".CƒÉlinescu, p. 864; Grigorescu, p. 419 The same commentator suggested that the concept linked modernism and traditionalism through the common influence of Charles Baudelaire,CƒÉlinescu, p. 864, 866 whom Fondane himself credited as the \\"mystical power\\" behind Priveli»ôti. The cycle also recalls Fondane's familiarity with another pastoral poet, Francis Jammes. Of special note is an ode, Lui Taliarh (\\"At Thaliarchus\\"), described by CƒÉlinescu as the masterpiece of Priveli»ôti.CƒÉlinescu, p. 866; Martin, p. XXV Directly inspired by Horace's Odes I.9, and seen by Martin as Fondane's will to integrate death into life (or \\"plenary living\\"),Martin, p. XXVI it equates existence with the seasonal cycle: =Arghezian modernism and Expressionist echoes= From its traditionalist core, Priveli»ôti created a modernist structure of uncertainty and violent language. According to Mircea Martin, the two tendencies were so intertwined that one could find both expressed within the same poem.Martin, p. XXVII The very preference for vitalism and the energy of wilderness, various critics assess, is a modernist reaction to the drama of World War I, rather than a return to Romantic ideals.Cernat, p. 36; Grigorescu, p. 419; Martin, p. XXVII‚ÄìXXVIII; RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 137‚Äì138 In this interval, Fondane had also discovered the poetic revolution promoted by Tudor Arghezi, who united traditionalist discourse with modernist themes, creating new poetic formats. Martin notes that Fondane, more than any other, tried to replicate Arghezi's abrupt prosody and \\"tooth and nail\\" approach to the literary language, but lacked his mentor's \\"verbal magic.\\"Martin, p. XXXV The same critic suggests that the main effect of Arghezi's influence on Fondane was not in poetic form, but in determining the disciple to \\"discover himself\\", to seek his own independent voice.Martin, p. XXXVII Paul Cernat also sees Fondane as indebted to Arghezi's mix of \\"cruelty\\" and \\"formal discipline\\".Cernat, p. 36 In contrast to such assessments, CƒÉlinescu saw Fondane not as an Arghezian pupil, but as a traditionalist \\"spiritually related\\" to Ion Pillat's own post- Symbolist avatar.CƒÉlinescu, p. 866; Martin, p. XXXVII This verdict was implicitly or explicitly rejected by other commentators: Martin argued that Pillat's omnipresent \\"calm joy\\", modulated with \\"impeccable taste\\", clashed with Fondane's \\"tension\\", \\"surprises\\" and \\"intelligence superior to [his] talent\\"; Cernat assessed that Priveli»ôti was at \\"the antipode\\" of Pillat and Jammes, that its themes pointed to social alienation and a patriarchal universe gone \\"off its rocker\\".Cernat, p. 36‚Äì37 Statements made by the young Fondane, in which he explains his indifference toward the landscape as it is, and his preference for the landscape as the poet himself creates it, have been a traditional source for critical commentary.Grigorescu, p. 419; Martin, p. XVI‚ÄìXXIII, XXX, XXXVII As Martin notes, this attitude led the poet and travel writer to express an apathy, or even boredom, in regard to the wild landscape, to promote \\"withdrawal\\" rather than \\"adhesion\\", \\"solitude\\" rather than \\"communion\\".Martin, p. XVI‚ÄìXVIII However, as a way of cultivating a cosmic level of poetry, Fondane's work veered into synesthesia and vitalism, being commended by critics for its tactile, aural or olfactory suggestions.CƒÉlinescu, p. 864‚Äì865; Grigorescu, p. 419; Martin, p. XXI‚ÄìXXII, XXV‚ÄìXXVII In one such poem, cited by CƒÉlinescu as a sample of \\"exquisite freshness\\", the author imagines being turned into a ripe watermelon.CƒÉlinescu, p. 865 These works also part with convention in matters of prosody (with a modern treatment of alexandrines) and vocabulary (a stated preference for Slavic versus Romance terminologies). In addition, Martin, who declared himself puzzled at noting that Fondane would not publish some of his most accomplished poems of youth, made special note of their occasional disregard for Romanian grammar and other artistic licenses (left uncorrected by Paul Daniel on Fondane's explicit request).Martin, p. XXXI‚ÄìXXXVII Some of the Priveli»ôti poems look upon nature with ostentatious sarcasm, focusing on its grotesque elements, its rawness and its repetitiveness, as well as attacking the idyllic portrayal of peasants in traditionalist literature.Martin, p. XIX‚ÄìXXIV Martin notes in particular one of the untitled pieces about Hertza region: The Bull, 1911 painting by Franz Marc Literary historian Ovid CrohmƒÉlniceanu was the first to suggest, in the 1960s, that the underlying traits of such imagery made the post-Symbolist Fondane an Expressionist poet, who had detected \\"the fundamental anarchy of the universe\\".Grigorescu, p. 35; Martin, p. XXVII. See also Tomescu (2005), p. 232 The verdict was echoed and amended by those of other critics. Martin finds that it applies to many of Fondane's early poems, where \\"explosive\\" imagery is central, but opines that, generally toned down by melancholy, their message too blends into a new form of \\"crepuscular wisdom\\".Martin, p. XXVII‚ÄìXXXI Scholar Dan Grigorescu stresses that the Neo-romantic and Symbolist element is dominant throughout the Priveli»ôti volume and, contrary to CrohmƒÉlniceanu's thesis, argues that Fondane's projection of the self into the nature is not Expressionist, but rather a convention borrowed from Romanticism (except for \\"perhaps, [...] the exacerbated dilatation\\" in scenes in which terrified cattle are driven into town).Grigorescu, p. 419‚Äì420 In Grigorescu's interpretation, the volume has some similarities with the pastoral Expressionism of Romanian writers Lucian Blaga and Adrian Maniu, as well as with the wilderness paintings of Franz Marc, but is at \\"the opposite pole\\" from the \\"morbid hallucination\\" Expressionism of H. Bonciu and Max Blecher.Grigorescu, p. 418, 420 He indicates that, overall, Fondane's contributions confuse critics by following \\"contradictory directions\\", a mix that \\"hardly finds any grounds for comparison within [Romanian] poetry.\\"Grigorescu, p. 419 In contrast, Paul Cernat sees both Fondane's poetry and Ion CƒÉlugƒÉru's prose as \\"Expressionist √©corch√©s\\", and connects Fondane's \\"modern attitude\\" to his familiarity with the poems of Arthur Rimbaud.Cernat, p. 36‚Äì37, 398 =Avant-garde critique of parochialism= The introduction of rhetorical violence within a traditional poetic setting announced Fondane's transition into the more radical wing of the modernist movement. During his Priveli»ôti period, in his articles for Contimporanul, the poet stated that Symbolism was dead,Sandqvist, p. 196 and in subsequent articles drew a line between the original and non-original sides of Romanian Symbolism, becoming particularly critical of Macedonski.Tomescu (2005), p. 230‚Äì232; (2006), p. 123‚Äì124 Defining his programmatic approach as leading, through the avant-garde, into a Neoclassical modernism (or a \\"new Classicism\\"),Cernat, p. 36; Martin, p. XX; RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 14, 20, 159; Tomescu (2005), p. 229‚Äì230 Mircea Muthu, \\"B. Fundoianu ‚Äì Estetica 'falsului tratat' \\" , in Tribuna, Nr. 180, March 2010, p. 21 Benjamin Fondane argued: \\"To be excessive: that is the only way of being innovative.\\"Martin, p. XX. Paraphrased in RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 14 His perspective, mixing revolt and messages about creating a new tradition, was relatively close to Contimporanuls own artistic program, and as such a variant of Constructivism.Cernat, p. 36‚Äì37, 135, 143, 213, 408‚Äì410; RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 9‚Äì12, 14‚Äì15 During his own transition from Symbolism, Fondane looked on the avant-garde itself with critical distance. Discussing it as the product of a tradition leading back to St√©phane Mallarm√©, he reproached Cubism for displaying a limitation of range, and viewed Futurism as essentially destructive (but also useful for having created a virgin territory to support \\"constructive man\\"); likewise, he found Dada a solid, but limited, method of combating interwar period's \\"metaphysical despair\\".RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 14‚Äì15, 40‚Äì41, 76‚Äì82, 137‚Äì142 The affiliation to the avant-garde came with a sharp critique of Romanian culture, accused by Fondane of promoting imitation and parochialism. During a period which ended with his 1923 departure, the young poet sparked polemic with a series of statements in which, reviewing the impact of local Francophilia, he equated Romania with a colony of France.Cernat, p. 201, 208‚Äì209, 211, 213; PuicƒÉ, p. 260; RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 7‚Äì9; Tomescu (2006), p. 123 Paul Cernat, \\"Etica 'jocului secund' al criticii\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 521, April 2010 This theory proposed a difference between Westernization and \\"parasitism\\": \\"If a foreign intellectual direction is always useful, an alien soul is always a danger.\\"Cernat, p. 209; PuicƒÉ, p. 259‚Äì260 He did not cease to promote foreign culture at home, but stated a complex argument about the need to recognize differences in culture: his global conclusion about civilizations, which he viewed as equal but not identical, built on Gourmont's theory about an \\"intellectual constancy\\" throughout human history, as well as on philosopher Henri Bergson's critique of mechanism.RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 10, 16‚Äì18 In parallel, Fondane criticized the cultural setting of Greater Romania, noting that it was so Bucharest- focused that Transylvanian authors only became widely known by attending the capital's Casa Cap»ôa restaurant.Cernat, p. 203‚Äì204 In his retrospective interpretation of Romanian literature, the avant-garde essayist stated that there were precious few authors who could be considered original, primarily citing Ion CreangƒÉ, the peasant writer, as a model of authenticity.Cernat, p. 76, 143, 200‚Äì201, 208‚Äì209, 211, 213 While stating this point in his Imagini »ôi cƒÉr»õi din Fran»õa, Fondane cited in his favor a traditionalist culture critic, historian Nicolae Iorga.Cernat, p. 208‚Äì209 However, during a virtual polemic with Poporanism (hosted by SburƒÉtorul in 1922), Fondane also questioned the originality and Thraco-Roman origin of Romanian folklore, as well as, through it, historical myths surrounding the Latin ethnogenesis: \\"Present-day Romania, of obscure origins, Thraco-Roman-Slavic-Barbarian, owes its existence and present-day European inclusion to a fecund error [...]: it is the idea of our Latin origin [Fondane's italics].\\"Cernat, p. 201. Paraphrased in RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 8 Likewise, the author put forth the thesis according to which traditionalists such as Mihail Sadoveanu and George Co»ôbuc invoked literary themes present not just in Romania's archaic tradition, but also in Slavic folklore.Cernat, p. 209 Fondane went on to draw a comparison between the idea of Jewish chosenness and that of Romanian Latinity, concluding that they both resulted in positive national goals (in the case of Romania and its inhabitants, that of \\"becoming part of Europe\\").RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 8 Paul Cernat found his perspective \\"more reasonable\\" than that of his Contimporanul colleagues, who speculated about creating a modernity on folkloric roots.Cernat, p. 201 Scholar Constantin Pricop interprets Fondane's overall perspective as that of a \\"constructive\\" critic, citing a fragment of Imagini »ôi cƒÉr»õi din Fran»õa: \\"Let us hope the time will come when we may bring our personal contribution into Europe. [...] Until such time, let's keep a check on the continuous assimilation of foreign culture [...]; let's therefore return to cultural criticism.\\" Commenting at length on the probable motivations of Fondane's discourse, Cernat suggests that, like many of his avant-garde colleagues, Fondane experienced a \\"peripheral complex\\", merging Bovarysme and frustrated ambition.Cernat, p. 16, 36‚Äì38, 211, 408‚Äì410 According to Cernat, the poet surpassed this moment after experiencing success in France, and his decision to have Priveli»ôti printed at home was intended as a special tribute to Romania and its language.Cernat, p. 36, 37 There is however a pronounced difference between Fondane's French and Romanian work, as discussed by critics and by Fondane himself.Cernat, p. 226‚Äì227; RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 13, 18, 135 The elements of continuity are highlighted in CrƒÉciun's account: \\"French literature and culture signified for Fundoianu a process of clarification and self-definition, but not a change of identity.\\" =Jewish tradition and Biblical language= Several of Fondane's exegetes have discussed the links between his apparent traditionalism and the classical themes of either secular Jewish culture or Judaism, with a focus on his Hasidic roots. According to Swedish researcher Tom Sandqvist (who discusses the Jewish background of many Romanian avant-garde authors and artists), the Hasidic and Kabbalah connection is enhanced by both the pantheistic vision of TƒÉgƒÉduin»õa lui Petru and the \\"Ein Sof-like emptiness\\" suggested in Priveli»ôti.Sandqvist, p. 355 Paul Cernat too argued that the traditionalist elements in Fondane's work reflected Hasidism as it was experienced in Galicia or Bukovina, as well as the direct influence of Iacob Ashel Groper.Cernat, p. 34, 36, 398 According to George CƒÉlinescu's analysis (originally stated in 1941), Fondane's origin within the rural minority of Romanian Jews (and not the urban Jewish mainstream) was of special psychological interest: \\"The poet is a Jew from Moldavia, where Jews have almost pastoral professions, but are nevertheless prevented by a tradition of market agglomerations from fully enjoying the sincerity of rustic life.\\"CƒÉlinescu, p. 864‚Äì865 The fond memory of Judaic practice is notably intertwined with the Priveli»ôti pastorals: Fondane expanded on his interest in the Jewish heritage in his early prose and drama. The various pre-1923 articles, including his obituary pieces for Elias Schwartzfeld and Avram Steuerman-Rodion, speak at length about Jewish ethics (which Fondane described as unique and idealistic), assimilation and Jewish nationalism. They also offer his answer to antisemitism, including his case, relying on proof of Jewish exogamy, against all theories about a distinct Semitic race. In other such pieces, he comments at length on Groper's Yiddishist literature and corrects opinions expressed on the same topic by their common friend Gala Galaction. As he explains in this context, Groper quelled his adolescent identity crisis, helping him find a core Judaism, more \\"vital\\" to him than the political scope of Zionism. During these dialogues, Fondane recalled, he first discovered his interest in philosophy: he played the \\"Sophist\\", paradoxical and abstract, in front of the \\"sentimental\\" Groper. This antithesis also inspired the core essay in Iudaism »ôi elenism, where Fondane writes at length about the hostile dialogue between Jewish philosophy, in search of fundamental truths, and Greek thought, with its ultimate value of beauty. TƒÉgƒÉduin»õa lui Petru, believed by Mircea Martin to be a sample of Fondane's debt to Andr√© Gide,Martin, p. V is the first of his works to take inspiration from the Bible (in this case, looking beyond the Talmud). Also Biblical in subject, Monologul lui Baltazar has been interpreted by CrohmƒÉlniceanu as a negative comment on nihilism and the √úbermensch theory, notions embodied by the protagonist Belshazzar, legendary ruler of Babylon during the Jewish captivity. Fondane's progressive focus on Jewish Biblical sources mirrored the Christian interests of his mentor Arghezi. Like Arghezi, Fondane wrote a series of Psalms‚Äîalthough, according to Martin, his tone was \\"too cadenced and solemn for one to expect a confrontation or a touching confession\\". However, Martin notes, the Jewish author either adopted or anticipated (depending on the reliability of his manuscripts' dating) Arghezi's poetry of exhortation and curses, in which ugliness, baseness and destitution speak directly to divinity.Martin, p. XXXV‚ÄìXXXVII These sentiments are found in Fondane's Psalmul leprosului, which the same critic identifies as \\"the series' masterpiece\\": =Surrealism, anti-communism and Jewish existentialism= Throughout and beyond his participation in the Surrealist milieus (an affiliation illustrated primarily by his filmmaker and popularizer activities, rather than by his literary creation),Cernat, p. 289, 412‚Äì413; Ion Pop, \\"Domni, tovarƒÉ»ôi, camarazi!\\" , in Tribuna, Nr. 134, April 2008, p. 9; RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 18‚Äì19, 135‚Äì136 Benjamin Fondane remained an existentialist, primarily following Lev Shestov's views on the human condition. This came as a critique of the scientific method and rationalism as human explanations of the world, notably outlined in his own Faux trait√© d'esth√©tique.Queneau, p. 86‚Äì87 Probably developed independently from Shestovist thought, his overall objection toward abstract projects has been likened by essayist Gina Sebastian Alcalay to the later stances of Andr√© Glucksmann or Edgar Morin. These attitudes shaped his assessments of Surrealism. In one of Integral chronicles, Fondane himself explained that the movement, described as superior to Dada's \\"joyous suicide\\", had created a \\"new continent\\" with its rediscovery of dreams.RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 40, 139 Poet and critic Armelle Chitrit notes that, in part, Fondane's later dissidence was also motivated on an existentialist level, since Surrealism \\"had stopped asking questions\\"; instead, she notes, Fondane \\"believed neither in reason nor in any system based on it. It is folly, he wrote, to perpetuate the attempt to make man and history cohabitable. One of [S]hestov's rare disciples, he sets only the powers of life against those of chaos.\\" As Fondane wrote to Claude Sernet, Rimbaud le voyou was in part at attempt at preventing the other Surrealists from confiscating Rimbaud's mythical status.RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 68 According to Romanian-born writer Lucian Raicu, its \\"somber\\" tone and allusive language are also early clues that Fondane had a nightmarish vision of the political and intellectual climate. His Shestovist interpretation, opposing existence to ideas, was contested by intellectual figure Raymond Queneau: himself a former Surrealist, Queneau suggested that Fondane was relying on blind faith, having a distorted perspective on science, literature and the human intellect.Queneau, p. 87‚Äì88 Furthermore, he noted that, under the influence of Lucien L√©vy-Bruhl, Fondane described reality exclusively in primitivist terms, as the realm of savagery and superstition.Queneau, p. 88‚Äì89 Fondane's objection to the communist flirtations of the main Surrealist wing had roots in his earlier discourse: before leaving Romania, Fondane had criticized socialism as a modern myth, symptomatic of a generalized desecration,RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 11 suggesting that Leninist and Labor Zionist projects were economically unsound. Much admired by Emil Cioran for his rejection of all modern ideology, the poet argued that a critical distance imposed itself between artists and social structures, and, although he too reacted against \\"bourgeois\\" culture, concluded that communism carried a greater risk for the independent mind.RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 46‚Äì52, 139 In particular, he objected to the Marxist theory on base and superstructure: although his planned address for the Writers' Congress spoke of Marxian economics as being justified by reality, it also argued that economic relationships could not be used to explain all historical developments. His critique of the Soviet Union as an equally \\"bourgeois\\" society also came with the argument that Futurism, not Surrealism, could transform into art the communist version of voluntarism.RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 46‚Äì52 Fondane found himself opposed to the general trend of intellectual partisanship, and took pride in defining himself as a politically independent skeptic. Around 1936, he reacted strongly against Julien Benda's rationalist political essays, with their overall critique of intellectual passions, describing them as revived and \\"excruciatingly boring\\" versions of positivism, but ignoring their primary, anti-totalitarian, agenda. Micha√´l Finkenthal, \\"Istoria intelectualului public: repere bibliografice\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 464, March 2009 However, La Conscience malheureuse (with essays on Shestov, Edmund Husserl, Friedrich Nietzsche and S√∏ren Kierkegaard) was noted as Fondane's own contribution to the debate surrounding Popular Front activities and the rise of fascism: titled after a concept in Hegelian philosophy, which originally referred to the thinking process generating its own divisions, it referred to the possibility of thinkers to interact with the larger world, beyond subjectivity. Rallying himself with the main trends of Jewish existentialism, the poet remained critical of other existentialist schools, such as those of Martin Heidegger and Jean-Paul Sartre, believing them to be overly reliant on dialectics, and therefore on rational thought;RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 142 likewise, citing Kierkegaard as his reference point, Fondane criticized Jean Wahl for not discussing existential philosophy as an act of faith.Moyn, p. 181, 188 His dislike for secular existentialism was also outlined in a text he authored shortly before his 1944 arrest, where he spoke of the Bible as being, \\"whether or not it wants to\\", the original reference for all existential philosophy.Anne-Marie Reijnen, \\"Du juda√Øsme comme ¬´demeurre oubli√©e¬ª de l'Occident\\", in Fran√ßois Coppens (ed.), Variations sur Dieu: langages, silences, pratiques, Facult√©s universitaires Saint-Louis, Brussels, 2005, p. 52. Genevi√®ve Tissier-Fondane later recalled that her husband was \\"profoundly Jewish\\" to his death, but also that he would not abide by any formal regulation within the Halakha tradition. This approach also implied a measure of ecumenism: Jacques Maritain, who cultivated his relationship with Fondane across the religious and philosophical divides, described his friend as \\"a disciple of Shestov but one inhabited by the Gospel\\";Viotto, p. 88 Fondane himself explained to Maritain that Shestov and himself were aiming for a new Judaic philosophy that would be equally indebted to the Christianity of Kierkegaard, Martin Luther and Tertullian. He was critical of Maritain's worldview, but remained a passionate reader of his work; in contrast, Genevi√®ve attested that the Maritains' beliefs shaped her own, leasing her back into the Church. =Late poetry and drama= The spiritual crisis experienced in France was the probable reason why Fondane refused to write poems between 1923 and 1927.Cernat, p. 288; RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 18, 94, 138 As he stated in various contexts, he mistrusted the innate ability of words to convey the tragedy of existence, describing poetry as the best tool for rendering a universal \\"wordless scream\\",Chitrit, p. 61 an \\"ultimate reality\\",RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 141 or an eternal expression of things ephemeral. In his essays, he suggested that the invention of art, like the invention of theory and rhetoric, had deprived poets of their existential function; beyond letting themselves be guided by their art, he argued, writers needed to confirm that the principles of life, negative as well as positive, exist.Queneau, p. 87 He saw poets as waging an unequal battle with both scientific perspectives and moralism, urging them to place their unique faith \\"in the mysterious virtue of poetry, in the existential virtue that poetry upholds\\". Rimbaud le voyou was in part a study of how, during his self-exile to Harar, Rimbaud had not merely abandoned poetry for the sake of adventure, but rather transformed his lifestyle into a poetry of incertitude and personal ambition. Lucian Raicu, \\"Fondane ‚Äì Rimbaud\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 8/2008 As Fondane explained in his Baudelaire et l'exp√©rience du gouffre, a poet and thinker could also evidence the abyss he faced, and alleviate his own anxiety, through the use of irony: \\"Laugh in the face of tragedy, or disappear!\\" According to Cernat, his articles for Integral show Fondane as an ally of the \\"anti-political\\" and lyrical side of Surrealism, a poet placing his trust in \\"the negative-soteriological, liberating function of poetry\\". The impact of existentialist philosophy was even traced to the \\"cine-poems\\" by Martin Stanton (who called the pieces \\"amazing\\").Stanton, p. 267 In contrast to the Surrealists, Fondane did not believe in a need to circulate poems as universal messages, but rather saw them as the basis for a very personal relationship with the reader: \\"This is not a time for print. Poetry is seeking its friends, not an audience. [...] Poetry will be for the few‚Äîor it will not be at all.\\"Chitrit, p. 67 Chitrit, who parallels Fondane's definitions with the similar views of Romanian poet and Holocaust survivor Paul Celan, concludes: \\"This is probably the closest that we can come to seeing contemporary poetry.\\" Fondane's other literary works also evidence the impact of his philosophical preoccupations. With Le F√©stin de Balthazar, the writer modified his earlier Monologul by adopting Shestivist themes (introducing allegorical characters who discuss Aristotelianism, capitalism and revolution) and by introducing some elements from the burlesque.Cernat, p. 274. See also Tomescu (2006), p. 126 Originally conceived in 1918 and completed in 1933, Philoct√®te reworked Sophocles' play of the same title, interpreting it through the style of Gide's dramas. Ulysse was an epic poem in free verse, the first such work in Fondane's career, and testing a format later adopted in Titanic and L'Exode.RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 94, 141 Although quite similar to Voronca's own work, which also used Homer's Odyssey as the pretext for a comment on social alienation, it included an additional allegory of Jewishness (according to critic Petre RƒÉileanu, Voronca had stripped his own text of Jewish symbolism, in the hope of not entering a competition with Fondane).RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 94 Fondane's 1933 text echoes his earlier intertextual Homeric references (present in poems he wrote back in 1914), but, to their adventurous escapism, it opposes the Ithaca metaphor‚Äîan ideal of stability in the assumption of one's destiny. Gis√®le Vanhese, \\"Sous le signe d'Ulysse. L'errance dans l'√©criture chez Benjamin Fondane et chez Paul Celan\\" , in Caietele Echinox, Vol. 11, 2006, at the Babe»ô-Bolyai University's Center for Imagination Studies Claude Sernet referred to Ulysse as \\"painful and sober, a cry of anxiety, of revolt and resignation, a fraternal and noble song to mankind\\".RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 132 The poem is also Fondane's comment on the Wandering Jew story (the mythical figure is rescaled into an urban Ulysses), and, according to cultural historian Andrei Oi»ôteanu, reinterprets the Christian prejudice about Jews being eternal \\"witnesses\\" of Christ's Passion.Oi»ôteanu, p. 341‚Äì342 Together, such motifs intimated the writer's own experiences, leading various commentators to conclude that he too was \\"the Jewish Ulysses\\". Italian academic Gis√®le Vanhese, who connects this lyrical discourse with Fondane's \\"experience of the abyss\\" concept, notes that ocean waters are the vehicles of nomadism in Ulysse, while, in Titanic, the same environment serves as a metaphor of dying. In Cioran's account, Benjamin Fondane lived his final years permanently aware \\"of a misfortune that was about to happen\\", and built a \\"complicity with the unavoidable\\". The same is noted by German Romanian poet and Cioran exegete Dieter Schlesak, who suggests: \\"Fondane was a man who wished to bear the absolute uncertainty of the outside; that which exists is an intermittent, not continuous, reality. But [true misfortune] is the boredom of faint unliving, [...] of things implied, these being the ones [Fondane] hated.\\" Fondane's visions about history and the role of poetry were notably outlined in L'Exode, a portion of which is dedicated to the powerlessness of Jews in front of prejudice. According to Oi»ôteanu, this text, where the narrative voice speaks of sufferings and defects common in all humans, was probably inspired by the famous monologue in William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice.Oi»ôteanu, p. 439 Another part, called \\"astonishingly prophetic\\" and \\"cynical apocalyptic\\" by Chitrit,Chitrit, p. 60, 68 reads: Similar themes were being explored by the Super Flumina Babylonis cycle, described by Sernet as \\"a terrible foreshadowing of events into which peoples and continents were about to sink, into which the author himself was to be dragged without the possibility of return.\\" Writing about the entirety of Fondane's French poetry (Le Mal des fant√¥mes), poet and language theorist Henri Meschonnic argued that the Romanian author was unique in depicting \\"the revolt and the flavor of life mixed into the sense of death\\". Legacy =Family and estate= After her husband's death (of which she was for long ignorant) and the end of the war, Genevi√®ve Tissier-Fondane, aided by the Maritains, moved into Kolbsheim Castle, tutoring the children of Antoinette and Alexander Grunelius.Viotto, p. 88, 111 A devout Catholic, she eventually retreated from public life, becoming a nun in the Congregation of Notre-Dame de Sion (dedicated to Catholic missionary work among the Jews). Relocating to the Montagne Sainte-Genevi√®ve, she died, after a long battle with cancer, in March 1954.Daniel, p. 638‚Äì639; Viotto, p. 88 Fondane was also survived by his mother Adela, who died in June 1953 at age 94, and sister Rodica (d. 1967).Daniel, p. 597, 641 The writer was the subject of several visual portrayals by noted artists, some of whom were his personal friends. During his collaboration with Integral and unu, Victor Brauner and Jules Perahim both drew his vignette portraits (the former as part of a series titled film unu).RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 45, 96 He is the subject of a 1930 sketch by Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, a 1931 Surrealist painting by Brauner (who also painted one of Adela Schwartzfeld),Daniel, p. 644 and an artistic photograph by Man Ray. The 1934 edition of Psalmul leprosului featured Fondane's portrait in the hand of graphic artist Sigmund Maur (the original version of which was dated to 1921).Daniel, p. 598, 644 A posthumous image of the poet in military attire was drawn by Romanian-born artist Eugen DrƒÉgu»õescu. Benjamin Fondane was also commemorated with a mention on the Panth√©on plaque, among the Morts pour la France List of Panth√©on mentions, at the Association des √©crivains combattants site; retrieved June 7, 2020 (reportedly, his name was added upon a request from Cioran). There is a similar landmark in Ia»ôi's Eternitatea cemetery, set up by the Writers' Union of Romania near his family grave.Daniel, p. 638‚Äì639, 641 The poet-philosopher left behind a large manuscript collection, a personal library and a set of works due for publishing. His book collection was split into individual documentary funds, some located in France and others in Romania.Daniel, p. 638‚Äì640 In February 1930, Benjamin Fondane explained that he did not consider revisiting his land of birth until such time as his earlier volumes would be printed, indicating that these included (in addition to Priveli»ôti): Ferestre spre Europa, Imagini »ôi scriitori rom√¢ni (\\"Images and Romanian Writers\\"), Caietele unui inactual (\\"The Notebooks of an Outdated Man\\"), Probleme vesele (\\"Merry Problems\\"), Dialoguri (\\"Dialogues\\") and an introduction to the work of art critic Walter Pater.Cernat, p. 227 Among Fondane's other Romanian works, unpublished at the time of his death, were the prose poem Her»õa (\\"Hertza\\"), Note dintr-un confesional and many other prose fragments and poems, all preserved in Daniel's manuscript collection.Daniel, p. 599‚Äì600; Martin, p. V‚ÄìVI According to Paul Daniel, part of the poet's book collection in Romania was left in the care of literary critic Lucian Boz, who sold it upon his departure for Australia. In France, the copyright to Fondane's work was passed on in the late 20th century to scholar Michel Carassou, Carmen Mu»ôat, \\"Despre copyright »ôi onestitate\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 436, August 2008 Mihai »òora, \\"Despre √Ænt√¢lnire, onoare »ôi generozitate\\", in LuceafƒÉrul, Nr. 40-41/2008 who was personally involved in several publication projects. =Western echoes= Plaque in memory of Fondane, at his former home on Rue Rollin 6 In France, the caretaker of documentary enterprises regarding Fondane was for long Sernet (Voronca's brother-in-law), who released part of Super Flumina Babylonis and other previously unknown texts (published in various issues of Cahiers du Sud and other journals), while supervising a new edition of L'Honneur des po√®tes, where Fondane was properly credited.Daniel, p. 639‚Äì640 In 1945, philosopher Jean Grenier edited the first-ever version of Le Lundi existentiel. A Fondane reader (comprising L'Exode) was being planned around 1946, and supposed to be published by Les √âditions de Minuit, with contributions from poets Jean Lescure and Paul √âluard.RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 125‚Äì126 Baudelaire et l'exp√©rience du gouffre was eventually published by √âditions Seghers in 1947, under the supervision of Jean Cassou (second edition 1972; third edition 1973).Daniel, p. 630, 644. See also RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 130‚Äì131 Sernet was also the author of the poem √Ä Benjamain Fondane, d√©port√© (\\"To Benjamin Fondane, Upon His Deportation\\"), reportedly dated June 3, 1944.RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 125‚Äì129 Recollections of Fondane's activity and his friendship with Victoria Ocampo are also found in Ocampo's series Testimonios (\\"Testimonies\\"). With support from Culture Minister Andr√© Malraux, Sernet also published a 1965 bound version of L'Exode and Super Flumina..., reconstructed from the fragmentary manuscripts.Daniel, p. 640, 644 Also on Sernet's initiative, Le Chant du Monde record label and comedian √àve Griliquez released an LP album of public recitations from his work. Other collections of his written work were published in later years, including his √âcrits pour le cin√©ma (\\"Writings for the Cinema\\", 1984),Cernat, p. 287, 418, 422; RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 142, 143; Stanton, p. 267 Le F√©stin de Balthazar (1985),Cernat, p. 418, 422 Le Lundi existentiel (1989),RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 143 and Le Mal des fant√¥mes (1996).Chitrit, p. 68; RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 142, 143 His interviews with Shestov, left by the poet in Ocampo's care, were collected in 1982, as Rencontres avec L√©on Chestov (\\"Meetings with Lev Shestov\\").Moyn, p. 172‚Äì173, 180 Fondane's notes on Dada, as well as other documents, saw print in 1996, as Le voyageur n'a pas fini de voyager (\\"The Traveler Isn't Done Traveling\\").RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 15, 20, 142 The following year, Fondane scholar Monique Jutrin discovered and published his manuscript speech for the 1935 Congress, L'√âcrivain devant la r√©volution. Another previously unknown text, the screenplay sketch Une journ√©e d'ivresse (\\"A Day of Drunkenness\\"), was included by editors Carassou and Petre RƒÉileanu in a critical edition of 1999.RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 18, 23‚Äì26 In the Western world (including the Romanian diaspora), there were a few authors whose work was influenced directly by Fondane's, among them VoroncaCƒÉlinescu, p. 866; Oi»ôteanu, p. 341 and David Gascoyne. Gascoyne, the author of \\"I.M. Benjamin Fondane\\" poem and recollection pieces on their friendship, spoke of the Romanian as a mentor, with a \\"decisive and lasting influence\\" on his own writings. France is home to a Benjamin Fondane Studies Society, which organizes an annual workshop in Peyresq. Since 1994, it publishes the academic review Cahiers Benjamin Fondane, which has recovered and published much of Fondane's correspondence and political texts. In 2006, following a Fondane Society request, a square on Paris' Rue Rollin was renamed in honor of the Romanian-born writer. Ronald Klapka, Dominique Hasselmann, php?article1622 Une place pour Benjamin Fondane, at Remue.net, May 26, 2006; retrieved June 7, 2010 Three years later, on the 65th commemoration of Fondane's killing, the M√©morial de la Shoah museum hosted a special exhibit dedicated his life and literary work. Liana Tugearu, \\"Exil √Æn pƒÉm√¢ntul uitƒÉrii\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 51‚Äì52/2009 In Israel, a fragment from his L'Exode is engraved in English and Hebrew versions on the entrance of Yad Vashem memorial. By the late 1970s, Fondane's Romanian work was attracting researchers and authors of monographs from various other countries, in particular the United States (John Kenneth Hyde, Eric Freedman etc.) and Communist Czechoslovakia (Libu≈°e Valentov√°).Daniel, p. 641‚Äì642 In West Germany, Fondane's poetic and philosophical contributions were in focus by 1986, when exiled poet Dieter Schlesak published translated samples in Akzente journal. Preceded by Gascoyne's French-to-English translation attempts from Fondane, American film editor Julian Semilian's contribution as a translator from Romanian is credited with having played an important part in introducing the English-speaking world to the writings of Fondane and various other Romanian modernists. »òtefan Manasia, \\" 'The poets work for the future' crede Julian Semilian\\" , in Tribuna, Nr. 133, March 2008, p. 2 The first-ever volume of Hebrew translations from Fondane's verse saw print in 2003, with support from Tel Aviv University. ISRO-Press Bulletin, Vol. lV, Issue 294, Sunday October 19, 2003: Doi scriitori evrei nƒÉscu»õi √Æn Romania ‚Äì Benjamin Fondane »ôi Mihail Sebastian ‚Äì tradu»ôi pentru prima oarƒÉ √Æn limba ebraicƒÉ , at the Romanian Jewish Community site; retrieved June 7, 2010 Other international echoes include the publication of Odile Serre's Romanian-to-French translations from his early poems. \\"Scriitori rom√¢ni la meet(ing)\\" , in Tribuna, Nr. 14, April 2003, p. 23 Recognition of Fondane's overall contribution was however rare, as noted in 1989 by Martin Stanton: \\"[Fondane is] surely the most underestimated intellectual of the 1930s\\". Writing some nine years later, Chitrit also argued: \\"His works [...] are as important as they are unknown.\\" Cioran, who in 1986 dedicated a portion of his Exercises in Admiration collection to his deceased friend, mentioned that Baudelaire et l'exp√©rience du gouffre, made memorable by its study of boredom as a literary subject, had since found numerous readers.Cernat, p. 37‚Äì38 Cioran kept a fond memory of his friend, and recalled not being able to pass on Rue Rollin without experiencing \\"terrible pain\\". Awareness of Fondane's philosophy was nevertheless judged unsatisfactory by scholar Moshe Idel. Speaking in 2007, he suggested that Fondane the philosopher remained less familiar to Jewish studies academics in Israel than his various counterparts in Germanic Europe. \\"Euroiudaica 2007. Centenar Mihail Sebastian: masƒÉ rotundƒÉ\\" , in Revista 22, Nr. 908, August 2007 Argentinian director Edgardo Cozarinsky, who was inspired in his youth by Fondane's introduction of avant-garde films (preserved in the Argentine Film Archives), staged and narrated a dramatized version of his biography, performed at the Villa Ocampo. Fondane scholar Olivier Salazar- Ferrer also authored a theatrical adaptation of L'Exode (premiered by France's Th√©√¢tre de La Mouvance company in 2008). Tania Radu, \\"Altfel despre teatru (I)\\" , in Revista 22, Nr. 963, August 2008 =Romanian echoes= In his native country, Benjamin Fondane was present in the memoirs of several authors. One special case is Arghezi, who, despite his disciple's admiration, left a sarcastic and intentionally demoralizing portrayal of Fondane in his 1930 volume Poarta NeagrƒÉ.Cernat, p. 139‚Äì140 A year after the poet's death at Auschwitz, Arghezi returned with a sympathetic obituary, printed in Revista Funda»õiilor Regale. Fondane was also the subject of a Surrealist poem in prose, or \\"short-circuit\\", by Stephan Roll, where he was referred to as \\"a Don Juan of the brain's lineage from God\\".RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 157 A very hostile depiction of Fondane and other Jewish writers, noted for its antisemitic undertones, was present in the 1942 memoirs of writer Victor Eftimiu.Oi»ôteanu, p. 65 A reflection of the late 1940s communization of Romania, Sa»ôa PanƒÉ's recollection piece De la B. Fundoianu la Benjamin Fondane (\\"From B. Fundoianu to Benjamin Fondane\\"), published by Orizont review, reinterpreted some of the poet's activities, and avant-garde history in general, from a partisan Marxist vantage point. Ion Pop, \\"Din avangardƒÉ √Æn ariergardƒÉ (III)\\" , in Tribuna, Nr. 181, March 2010, p. 8 Later memoirs mentioning the writer include a piece by Adrian Maniu in the Cluj-based magazine Steaua (December 1963) and a new tribute by PanƒÉ in LuceafƒÉrul (October 1964).Daniel, p. 613, 615 PanƒÉ's recollections were later turned into a larger narrative, the 1973 autobiographical novel NƒÉscut √Æn 02 (\\"Born in '02\\").RƒÉileanu & Carassou, p. 16, 20 Fondane also features prominently in Claudia Millian's Cartea mea de aduceri-aminte (\\"My Book of Recollections\\"), published the same year as PanƒÉ's volume.Daniel, p. 611, 621 Also in 1973, the former Surrealist campaigner Geo Bogza dedicated Fondane an eponymous prose poem, centered on an existential contradiction: \\"To be born in Moldavia, in sweet, gentle Moldavia... and to end up in the furnaces at Auschwitz.\\" Among the younger Romanian poets, who debuted during communism, Nichita StƒÉnescu was influenced by Priveli»ôti in some of his own earliest works, Alexandru Condeescu, \\"Nichita StƒÉnescu ‚Äì Debutul poetic\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 14/2005 as was Andrei Codrescu. Andrei Codrescu, Andra Rotaru, \\"√én America era rock'n roll, revolu»õie, LSD »ôi culori\\", in LuceafƒÉrul, Nr. 42/2009 Posthumous Romanian editions of Fondane's works included the selection Poezii (\\"Poems\\"), edited by the former Surrealist author Virgil Teodorescu (Editura pentru LiteraturƒÉ, 1965), and Daniel's new version of Priveli»ôti (Cartea Rom√¢neascƒÉ, 1974),Daniel, p. 644; Martin, p. V‚ÄìVI followed in 1978 by the Martin and Daniel selection, and in 1980 by Teodorescu and Martin's Imagini »ôi cƒÉr»õi (\\"Images and Books\\", grouping Fondane's French literary studies, as translated by Sorin MƒÉrculescu).Cernat, p. 426; PuicƒÉ, p. 259 Translated by Romulus Vulpescu, Le po√®te en patrouille was featured in Manuscriptum review (1974). During communism, various Romanian scholars who dedicated significant portions of their work to Fondane studies; in addition to Martin, Ovid CrohmƒÉlniceanu and Dumitru Micu, they include: Paul Cornea, Nicolae Manolescu, Dan MƒÉnucƒÉ, Marin Mincu, Dan Petrescu, Mihail Petroveanu and Ion Pop.Tomescu (2005), p. 232 In the 1980s, modern classical composer Doru Popovici completed the cantata In memoriam Beniamin Fundoianu (lyrics by Victor B√¢rlƒÉdeanu). Iulia Deleanu, \\"Victor B√¢rlƒÉdeanu z.l. ‚Äì reper spiritual\\", in Realitatea EvreiascƒÉ, Nr. 266‚Äì267 (1066‚Äì1067), December 2006 ‚Äì January 2007 Writing in 1978, Martin noted that the focus of such recoveries was on Fondane's poetry, while Fondane the thinker and \\"informed commentator\\", \\"one of the most evolved critical voices in 1920s Romanian culture\\", remained unfamiliar to Romanians. The limits on Fondane's posthumous circulation were partly dictated by the policies of Communist Romania. In 1975, the censorship apparatus (who followed national communist ideas about restricting references to Judaism) removed references to Fondane's ethnic and religious background from a reprint of Arghezi's 1945 text. In 1980, a version of his M√¢ntuirea series, Iudaism »ôi elenism, was purged from Imagini »ôi cƒÉr»õi, on orders from the same institution. Martin's 1984 monograph, Introducere √Æn opera lui B. Fundoianu (\\"An Introduction to B. Fundoianu's Work\\"), was saluted as \\"penetrating\\" by his colleague Gheorghe CrƒÉciun. The same study is primarily noted by Paul Cernat as a \\"problem-oriented\\" text about the \\"complexes\\" of Romanian culture, and therefore an implicit reaction against the national communism promoted under Nicolae Ceau»ôescu. The hidden parts of Benjamin Fondane's contribution became accessible only after the anti-communist uprising of 1989. In 1999, the Jewish community publishers, Editura Hasefer, issued Iudaism »ôi elenism (with scholars Leon Volovici and Remus ZƒÉstroiu as editors).Cernat, p. 36, 422; Oi»ôteanu, p. 28, 37 The same year, the Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania published an anthology of his texts, StrigƒÉt √Æntru eternitate (\\"A Shout unto Eternity\\"),Cernat, p. 422 and Editura Echinox a concordance dictionary of his poetry (one of several such projects initiated by linguist Marian Papahagi). Solomon Marcus, \\"Un nou dic»õionar Eminescu\\" , in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Nr. 4/2007 In 2004, Mircea Martin and Ion Pop also collected Fondane's political essays as Scriitorul √Æn fa»õa revolu»õiei (titled after the Romanian version of L'√âcrivain devant la r√©volution). Writing in 2001, CrƒÉciun assessed that the poet was still \\"non-integrated\\" into his native Romanian culture, which mostly perceived him as estranged, and his work in the vernacular as traditionalist. Eight years later, comparatist Irina Georgescu assessed that interest in the more unknown aspects of Fondane's work had been rekindled by public conferences and new monographs (among which she cites the contributions of scholars Mariana Boca, Nedeea BurcƒÉ and Ana-Maria Tomescu). Le F√©stin de Balthazar was performed in its Romanian version (OspƒÉ»õul lui Baltazar), directed by Alexandru Dabija for the Nottara Theater company. \\"S-a stins un scenograf. In memoriam SicƒÉ Rusescu\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 236, August 2004 The 65th commemoration of Fondane's death was marked locally with several events, including the premiere of Andreea TƒÉnƒÉsescu's Exil √Æn pƒÉm√¢ntul uitƒÉrii (\\"Exile to the Land of Oblivion\\"), a contemporary ballet and performance art show loosely inspired by his poetry. In 2006, the Romanian Cultural Institute set up the Benjamin Fondane International Award for Francophone literature in countries outside France. In 2016, CƒÉtƒÉlin Mihuleac published a biographical short story (and eulogy), Ultima »õigarƒÉ a lui Fondane (\\"Fondane's Last Cigarette\\"). Maris Chivu, \\"Feedbook: R√Æsu' pl√Ænsu' cu evreii\\", in Dilema Veche, Nr. 648, July 2016 Fondane's literary posterity was also touched by an extended controversy, notably involving Mircea Martin and philosopher Mihai »òora. The scandal was ignited after October 2007, when »òora and poet Luiza Palanciuc set up the Restitutio Benjamin Fondane translation program, with support from Editura Limes and Observator Cultural magazine. Martin contested this initiative, arguing that he had earlier publicized his intent of editing a Romanian-language Fondane reader, and claiming legal precedence on copyrights. A parallel conflict ensued between Editura Limes and Observator Cultural, after which the Restitutio program split into separate projects.

Twelve Mile Creek (known informally as Bronte Creek) flows through the middle of town and empties into Lake Ontario. Main roads include Bronte Road (north-south), Lakeshore Road West (east-west, parallel to Lake Ontario) and Rebecca Street (east-west). Streets in the business section include Lakeshore, Jones, Marine, and Ontario Street. Bronte is also accessed via a superhighway (the Queen Elizabeth Way) located to the north of the former village. Riggs Road was planned but never opened. Other main roads include Third Line, Speers Road and Burloak Drive to the west (the latter was named after the boundary of Burlington and Oakville.) Bronte is a former fishing village which became annexed in 1962 with the former Township of Trafalgar, forming the Town of Oakville, along with the other formerly autonomous communities, including Sheridan.

The north-central part is industrialized while the west is mixed with some farmland, a former Petro- Canada refinery (which has closed and has yet to be dismantled as of 2010) and forests cover the northwest and includes Bronte Creek Provincial Park which cuts off Upper Middle Road. The park area is also used for trailers and tents. Farmland used to cover most of Bronte (except for the northwest) before suburban housing came in the 1960s and the 1970s. Lakeshore houses are situated along the shore of Lake Ontario. The narrow ravine of Bronte Creek is undeveloped, except at the mouth which serves as a harbour. Culture and neighbourhood Bronte's neighbourhood stretches from Burloak Drive in the west to Fourth Line, and from Lake Ontario in the south to the Queen Elizabeth Way. Coronation Park, which has a large playground, plentiful parking space, a field room, and sandy beaches, hosts the annual Waterfront Festival. Its greatest attraction is an outdoor stage fronting an area 256 feet deep and 152 feet wide, with a hillock at the side. During the Waterfront Festival, the east field has carnival rides such as 1001 Niches and Polar Express, and features game kiosks. The parking lot is turned into a string of kiosks offering food and product information. The stage has extra lighting installed with a projector screen, an autograph booth at the side, and a DJ booth in the middle. Rail and bus service operates from Bronte GO Station, situated on the Lakeshore West line connecting Bronte to communities along the shore, including Toronto. Originally known as Oakville West, the station became known by its current name when it was rebuilt. The station boasts having more than 1,700 parking spaces and is located off Wyecroft Road with access from the South Service Road. Bronte has a number of schools, including Queen Elizabeth Park (closed), Gladys Speers, Eastview and Brookdale (Public Elementary), St. Dominic and St. Joseph (Catholic Elementary), and Oakville Christian School, formerly John Wilson (Public Elementary). Thomas A. Blakelock (Public High) rounds out the list. Although the commercial centre is at Bronte Road and Lakeshore, the South Oakville Centre, (Hopedale Mall) located at Rebecca Street and Third Line Road provides additional retail businesses. Originally an L-shaped strip mall built in 1959 coincident with the development of the surrounding subdivision, it has undergone several expansions by which it has been enclosed with the closing of Seabourne Street between Tansley Drive and Rebecca Street. History Founded in 1834, Bronte began as a small fishing village at the mouth of Twelve Mile Creek. The name Bronte was chosen as a tribute to the British Naval hero, Horatio Nelson, who was made Duke of Bronte by King Ferdinand III of Sicily. Bronte's etymological root is the Greek word Œ≤œÅŒøŒΩœÑŒÆ which means thunder. Some of Bronte's original settlers were United Empire Loyalists and many of the streets were named for these founding fathers: Sovereign, Hixon, Nelson and Belyea. One of the early industries in Bronte was stonehooking. Boats would gather stone slabs from shallow waters near the shore by hooking them from Lake Ontario for use in construction. The building at 49 Bronte Road built circa 1840 still remains as an example of construction using material stonehooked from the lake. Its post office dates from 1851. Bronte's first harbour was completed in 1856. In the 1920s, Middle Road was built with 3 interchanges including Service Road. Middle Road became part of the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) in 1939. In the mid-20th century, Cities Service built a refinery just south of the QEW, west of Bronte Road. The refinery was later acquired by British Petroleum and subsequently, Petro- Canada. Another refinery to the west was built by Shell with its entrance off Rebecca Street. The Shell Refinery ceased operations in 198_. The Petro-Canada refinery was decommissioned in 2009 and now is a bulk storage facility. Streets in Bronte are numbered from east to west and lettered from A to L (or N?) from north to south. A housing boom started in the late 1950s south of the QEW. Starting in the late-1980s, housing developments began north of the QEW and westward towards Burlington. In the 1960s, a highway linking north to Milton (Highway 25) moved from Guelph Line to Bronte Road. Later in the 1980s, an interchange for Burloak was added. This major arterial route is now not legally a highway, but a \\"regional road\\" but is, in fact, called \\"The Veterans Highway.\\" In the 2000s, a new two-lane bridge was built to connect New Street at Mississaga Street and Rebecca Street at Bronte Road. A community called Lakeshore Woods was built where the former Shell Research Centre was located. Construction began in the 2000s and is planned for completion by 2010. In early March 2006, Stoneboats restaurant, which was partly located in one of Bronte's most historical buildings (built in circa 1840), suffered heavy fire damage and was rebuilt. A large portion of the historical part of the building was destroyed. In April 2009, the Bronte Business Improvement Association and the owners of the Bronte Village Mall presented a proposal for revitalizing the mall which includes residential, office and retail space, although it appears that the height of the new proposed structures does not conform to local bylaws.

He succeeded his brother as Earl of Shaftesbury in 2005. He also holds the subsidiary titles Baron Ashley and Baron Cooper. Early life The Earl and Countess of Shaftesbury, after their marriage in 2010 Nicholas Ashley-Cooper was born on 3 June 1979, in London, the younger son of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 10th Earl of Shaftesbury (1938‚Äì2004), and his Swedish wife Christina Eva Montan (born c. 1940), the daughter of Nils Montan, a former Swedish Ambassador to Germany. His godfathers were Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster, and Simon Elliot, later brother-in-law of Charles, Prince of Wales. He had an elder brother, Anthony Nils Christian Ashley-Cooper (1977‚Äì2005), who in 2004 became 11th Earl of Shaftesbury, and also an older half brother and half sister from Lady Shaftesbury‚Äôs first marriage. His father, the 10th Earl of Shaftesbury, was murdered in November 2004 by the brother of his third wife, Jamila, Countess of Shaftesbury, and was succeeded by his elder son. His widow, Jamila, is currently serving a twenty-year prison sentence as an accomplice to the murder. Six months later, on 15 May 2005, the 11th Earl died of a heart attack in Manhattan, New York, while visiting his younger brother, and Ashley-Cooper thus unexpectedly succeeded him in the earldom. The Daily Telegraph described the new Earl as ‚Äúa tattooed young raver‚Äù. He then relocated to his family home from New York City and assumed the responsibilities of the earldom. Career Before inheriting the family estates, Shaftesbury worked in television and music. He began as a strategic analyst with Discovery Networks Europe, a television network, then worked on Digital Strategy and Business Development for Terra Firma Capital Partners, after its acquisition of the music company EMI Group. He was then part of a team that raised over $5 million for Saatchi Online, an online forum and art gallery, and finally was the chief operating officer of GoMix, an interactive music software platform company. Marriage and children On 11 September 2010, in Dorset, Shaftesbury married Dinah Streifeneder (born 12 September 1980 in Munich), the daughter of Dr Fritz Streifeneder, a retired German orthopaedic surgeon, and Renata Leander-Streifeneder, an Argentinian physiotherapist. She spent her early life in Rome, Italy. The Countess of Shaftesbury is a veterinary surgeon by profession and has taken the lead in the restoration of St Giles House. The couple have three children. Their son Anthony Francis Wolfgang Ashley-Cooper, Lord Ashley, born on 24 January 2011, is his father's heir apparent and the only person in the line of succession to the earldom. A daughter, Lady Viva Constance Lillemor Ashley-Cooper, was born on 22 April 2012, and another daughter, Lady Zara Emily Tove Ashley-Cooper, on 17 October 2014.

St Giles House The village of Wimborne St Giles rests within the family estate itself. The Ashley family arrived in Dorset, originally from Wiltshire, where they owned the manor of Ashley, since the 11th century. The first ancestor to reside in Wimborne St Giles was Robert Ashley (born c. 1415), fifth great grandfather of Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury.Timbs, John; and Alexander Gunn.

Built in 1651, the family seat of St Giles House has fallen into disrepair and has been unoccupied for about 60 years. In 2001, St Giles House was recorded on the Register of Buildings at Risk, as a Grade I listed building, indicating neglect and decay. Buildings recorded on the Grade I list include those of \\"exceptional interest, sometimes considered to be internationally important\\". Discussions regarding future use of St Giles House and the estate have been resumed following inheritance by the 12th Earl of Shaftesbury. Work on the house began in 2011 and since then the restoration has won several national awards including the 2014 Georgian Group Awards for the Restoration of a Georgian Country House, the 2015 Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Award for Building Conservation, the 2015 Historic Houses Association/Sotheby‚Äôs Restoration Award and the Historic England Angel Award, Best Rescue of a Historic Building or Site. This has helped secure the future of the house as a family home and as a venue for a wide range of activities including weddings, concerts and corporate events. ;Mainsail Haul During World War II, St Giles House was requisitioned and used as a girls school evacuated from London called, Miss Faunce's Parents' National Union School.

Course and features Formed by the confluence of the Mackintosh River and Murchison River, the Pieman River rises in what is now known as Lake Rosebury, an artificial lake formed by the Bastyan Dam. The river flows generally west and northwest and then west again, joined by 21 tributaries including the Mackintosh, Murchison, Marionoak, Ring, Wilson, Stitt, Huskisson, Stanley, Heemskirk, Paradise, Owen Meredith, Savage, Whyte and Donaldson rivers before emptying into Hardwicke Bay and reaching its mouth in the Southern Ocean. The river descends over its course. The river is impounded at Bastyan by the Bastyan Dam (and adjacent hydroelectric power station to form Lake Rosebury; and at Reece by the Reece Dam (and adjacent hydroelectric power station to form Lake Pieman. Both reservoir and power stations from part of the Hydro Tasmania-operated Pieman River Power Development. The construction of the power development scheme also altered the route of the Emu Bay Railway, and submerged a variety of rail heritage sites in the vicinity of the river, notably parts of the Wee Georgie Wood Railway or North Farrell Tramway line. Etymology The Aboriginal Tasmanians knew the river as Corinna, which is the Peerapper word for the thylacine. The once- common suggestion that the river's English name comes from a convict \\"The Pieman\\" Alexander Pearce who was responsible for one of the few recorded instances of cannibalism in Australia, is not correct. \\"The Pieman\\" was in fact Thomas Kent of Southampton, a pastry-cook who was transported to Van Diemen's Land in 1816. After a long series of offences in the colony, he was sent to the Macquarie Harbour Penal Station in 1822 but subsequently escaped, and was recaptured near the mouth of the river which now bears his nickname.

Practice Kulaszka earned a law degree and was admitted to the Law Society of Upper Canada in 1980. She began her law practice in 1987 and acted with Doug Christie as co-counsel to Holocaust denier Ernst Z√ºndel in the 1980s, and then assisted Christie as a legal researcher in a subsequent Z√ºndel case in the 1990s. She also assisted Christie in the defence of alleged Nazi war criminal Imre Finta, who was acquitted in 1990 (see R v Finta). In 1990, she represented former Nazi rocket scientist Arthur Rudolph when he entered Canada and unsuccessfully sought visitor status when the government ruled he was inadmissible due to his suspected culpability in war crimes.Timothy Appleby, \\"Rudolph hearing adjourns Ex-Nazi seeks visitor status, The Globe and Mail, July 7, 1990 Rudolph ultimately left Canada of his own accord and an immigration hearing held in his absence, at which he was represented by Kulaszka, ruled that Rudolph could not return to Canada due to his use of slave labour to produce V-2 missiles during World War II.Robert MacLeod, \\"Former Nazi scientist is barred from Canada\\", The Globe and Mail, January 12, 1991.

His career in television began in Mississippi as a reporter at WLOX-TV in Biloxi and later WDAM-TV in Laurel, before moving to WAGA-TV in Atlanta. Scarborough's first major market anchoring job came in 1972, at WNAC- TV in Boston. He was originally hired as part of a two-man anchor team with respected New England journalist Lee Nelson, but was soon made the solo anchor of the station's news broadcasts. In addition to his anchor work, he was called on to host a weekly program called Mass Reaction, in which the public was invited to the studio to question news broadcasters and newsmakers. In his final broadcast on WNAC-TV, Scarborough ended the newscast with a commentary in which he identified the issue of race as the most important challenge facing Boston. A scant few months later, Boston erupted into racial unrest as the result of a federal court order to end its policy of de facto racial segregation in the public schools. While WNAC had been the perennial trailer among Boston's three VHF television news broadcasts, with Scarborough as anchor the station managed to best its rivals in the 6pm newscast ratings.

Kalehoff composed the musical themes to the game shows The Price Is Right and Double Dare, as well as for ABC World News Tonight and Monday Night Football. Notable pieces Kalehoff composed many television themes and musical cues using the Moog synthesizer, alone or in combination with a band of musicians. He composed The Price Is Right main theme, and the theme for the Nickelodeon game show Double Dare. He wrote a music package for ESPN on ABC that updated and expanded the Monday Night Football theme; the 1991 theme song for Labatt Blue Jays/Expos Baseball on TSN in Canada; music for WNBC-TV's famous 1992 promotional campaign \\"We're 4 New York\\"; and many news program music and television station image packages used on stations such as WEWS-TV in Cleveland, WJBK-TV in Detroit, and WNYW, WCBS-TV and WNBC-TV in New York City. The NBC Stations package composed in 1995 for WNBC was used by the station until 2003. Due to its long run as the music package for WNBC, it is widely known in the Tri-state area.Edd Kalehoff on IMDb His most recent work is the new theme for the PBS NewsHour as part of a new on-air look launched on July 20, 2015.https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/newshour-debuts- new-theme-music The main theme of The Price Is Right is officially credited to Sheila Cole,https://www.ascap.com/repertory#ace/search/workID/460335539 even though it was composed and performed by Kalehoff. At the time, Kalehoff was working for Score Productions, under composer Bob Israel. Israel assigned the theme's Broadcast Music, Inc. publishing rights to Mark Goodson, the producer of The Price Is Right, so that Goodson would benefit monetarily. Israel assigned the composer credit to Sheila Cole, his wife, explaining this fiction to Kalehoff as a \\"technicality.\\" Israel assured Kalehoff that there would be future work with Goodman. This arrangement diverted millions of dollars of residual away from Kalehoff. Kalehoff was named as composer at the end credits of the television show but he did not appear on the official BMI credits for the song.https://genius.com/a/how-the-price-is-right-theme-song-composer-lost- out-on-millions-in-royaltieshttps://www.20k.org/episodes/thepriceisright As a keyboard player and record producer Kalehoff is a noted synthesizer, being a featured performer in the documentary film Moog and keyboardist for several albums by The Roches.

Hortus third: A concise dictionary of plants cultivated in the United States and Canada. Macmillan, New York.) is the most widespread species in the genus Lycopodium in the clubmoss family. Description Lycopodium clavatum is a spore-bearing vascular plant, growing mainly prostrate along the ground with stems up to long; the stems are much branched, and densely clothed with small, spirally arranged microphyll leaves. The leaves are 3‚Äì5 mm long and 0.7‚Äì1 mm broad, tapered to a fine hair-like white point. The branches bearing strobili or spore cones turn erect, reaching above ground, and their leaves are modified as sporophylls that enclose the spore capsules or sporangia. The spore cones are yellow-green, long, and broad. The horizontal stems produce roots at frequent intervals along their length, allowing the stem to grow indefinitely along the ground. The stems superficially resemble small seedlings of coniferous trees, though it is not related to these.

XDS is used by TV stations, TV networks, and TV program syndication distributors in the US for several purposes. Here are some of the most common uses of XDS: * The \\"autoclock\\" system delivers time data via an XDS \\"Time-of-Day Packet\\" for automatically setting the clock of newer TVs & VCRs sold in the US. Most PBS stations provide this service. * Rudimentary program information which can be displayed on-screen, such as the name and remaining time of the program, * Station identification, * V-chip content ratings data. XDS is also used by the American TV network ABC for their Network Alert System (NAS). NAS is a one-way communication system used by ABC to inform and alert their local affiliate stations across the US of information regarding ABC's network programming (such as program timings & changes, news special report information, etc.), using a special decoder manufactured for ABC by EEG Enterprises , a manufacturer of related equipment for the TV broadcast industry such as closed captioning and general-purpose XDS encoders. The CBS Television Network uses a similar method to transmit three separate internal messaging services to stations: one for programming departments, one for master control operations, and one for newsrooms. Many standard definition receivers produced by Dish Network encode XDS data into their output signal. Data encoded includes time of day, program name, program description, program time remaining, channel identification, and content rating. This data is obtained from the satellite service's EPG and replaces any data which may have been present when the signal was uplinked. XDS uses the same line in the vertical blanking interval as closed captioning (NTSC line 21), and shares the available second video field bandwidth with the closed captioning channels CC3 and CC4, and with the text channels TXT3 and TXT4.

This is characterized by an immersive dream state similar to REM sleep, which can range from realistic to alien or abstract. Many dream- enhancing plants such as dream herb (Calea zacatechichi) and African dream herb (Entada rheedii), as well as the hallucinogenic diviner's sage (Salvia divinorum), have been used for thousands of years in a form of divination through dreams, called oneiromancy, in which practitioners seek to receive psychic or prophetic information during dream states. The term oneirogen commonly describes a wide array of psychoactive plants and chemicals ranging from normal dream enhancers to intense dissociative or deliriant drugs. Effects experienced with the use of oneirogens may include microsleep, hypnagogia, fugue states, rapid eye movement sleep (REM), hypnic jerks, lucid dreams, and out-of-body experiences. Some oneirogenic substances are said to have little to no effect on waking consciousness, and will not exhibit their effects until the user falls into a natural sleep state.

Nights is a \\"Nightmaren\\" who resides in Nightopia, a dream world where the dreams of all human beings are acted out every night. Creation and conception Naoto Ohshima was the original Nights creator and designer, while Kazuyuki Hoshino was the character designer for the video game Nights into Dreams. The character design incorporated Japanese, European, and American stylistics in order to give Nights as universal an appeal as possible. In the context of the games, Nights is a part of every human's subconscious, and so was purposely designed to be neither male nor female. By the time of the sequel, Nights: Journey of Dreams, Ohshima had left Sega, and Kazuyuki Hoshino was placed in charge of character design for the game. Takashi Iizuka, the lead game designer, felt that, with Hoshino, they captured the style used for the character in the original game. Nights' personality is described by Iizuka as \\"a mirror of the child's personality.\\" Nights' speaking role in Journey of Dreams was performed by Julissa Aguirre, who gave the character a British-English accent to suit the style of the game. In addition, Nights was made genderless, leaving the impression of the character \\"totally up to the player\\", according to Iizuka. Character Nights wears a purple jester-style hat and outfit, with a diamond-shaped, red jewel on the chest. In the miniseries published by Archie Comics, this was said to be a piece of a red Ideya (the personality orb which contains courage) that broke off and latched onto the character's chest. Yuji Naka and Naoto Ohshima explained that the character is \\"not a hero from the good dreams, but a hero from the nightmares. In other words, there's just a little bit of a scary element to them. They are cute but frightening. NiGHTS has a dual male/female character image. With that image in mind we then bring in the circus like element. The nightmare world is similar to the circus. In the darkness a single spot-light shines, creating the vividly coloured stage. This kind of element is included inside the nightmare's darkness to show the beauty of the place. So with the NiGHTS' character and the Nightmarens all gathered together it gives the impression of a circus group. Although NiGHTS looks a little like a jester, when you find them in your dreams wonderful things happen and a new hope is born within.\\" NiGHTS behaves childishly, never for a moment thinking of the consequences of their actions, for example sometimes scaring people just for fun, but mostly NiGHTS' actions can be considered chivalrous. NiGHTS is also merciful, as shown with Reala in Journey of Dreams. NiGHTS likes new and unusual things, but hates being bound and told what to do. NiGHTS dislikes Wizeman for confining them and denying them their freedom. Sometimes, when very relaxed, NiGHTS will pull out an invisible flute and start playing \\"Dreams Dreams\\", the game's theme song. NiGHTS has the ability to transform into just about anything, an ability that was expanded upon in the sequel with the introduction of each persona mask. Even without the persona masks, NiGHTS is still able to change forms and abilities as desired. NiGHTS can also create small portals called \\"Paraloops\\" with their Twinkle Dust if the dust is spread to form a closed circle. NiGHTS comes from the dream world of Nightopia (also referred to in-game as the Night Dimension) and takes shape according to the thoughts, ideas, personalities, and will of the Visitors (humans from the real world). NiGHTS lives alongside Owl, a brown owl who acts as elder and guide in the sequel, and the Nightopians. NiGHTS, however, is a Nightmaren and henceforth their origin is the dark realm of Nightmare. NiGHTS attempts to stop Wizeman from taking over Nightopia. NiGHTS is kind towards the children (Claris, Elliot, Will, and Helen) in both games, helping all four of them to defeat Wizeman on two separate occasions. NiGHTS shows disrespect for Owl on a regular basis, but also shows a sort of friendship with the bird. Owl often seems frustrated with NiGHTS' rambunctious behaviour, and his lectures are often to no avail. NiGHTS was once loyal to Wizeman, but eventually began to view what Wizeman was doing as wrong and in need of being stopped. NiGHTS also wished to have free will, which Wizeman didn't allow; NiGHTS therefore decided to rebel. Their hatred for each other is strong and neither show mercy in battle. NiGHTS' relationship with Reala appears complicated. NiGHTS still holds Reala as a friend, or at least a former one. Reala often plays on NiGHTS' mercy, using it as an opportunity to imprison NiGHTS. Reala sometimes refers to NiGHTS as a \\"sibling\\" and, in almost every instance in the sequel, will try and talk NiGHTS into surrendering before starting a fight. Game appearances Nights first appeared in the video game Nights into Dreams on the Sega Saturn. The second game in the series, Nights: Journey of Dreams, is on the Wii. Sega Superstars for PlayStation 2 features a game with Nights, which utilized the EyeToy peripheral. Nights also appeared in the sampler game Christmas Nights on the Sega Saturn. Takashi Iizuka reported that he is very interested in making Nights 3, but it is the management's decision whether or not to proceed. Other appearances Nights has appeared in many other games besides the series, including Sonic Adventure (in the Casinopolis level), Sonic Adventure 2 (in the City Escape and Radical Highway levels), Shadow the Hedgehog (in Lethal Highway, the title screen appears in a billboard without any text), and also in Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2, the player can raise a chao that resembles Nights. Nights also appears in Sonic Pinball Party, Sonic Shuffle, Billy Hatcher and the Giant Egg, Sega Superstars, both Sonic Riders and Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity (as a secret character) and Sega Superstars Tennis. Nights also makes a cameo appearance in Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing as the flagman, and later appears playable alongside Reala in Sonic & All- Stars Racing Transformed. The character also makes a cameo appearance in a downloadable level of Sonic Lost World. The level is named Nightmare Zone, which consists of multiple boss battles from the original game in the series. Nights has also made a guest appearance in Phantasy Star Online I & II Plus, in Episode 2. Nights has also appeared in Archie Comics' Worlds Unite crossover between its Sonic the Hedgehog and Mega Man titles, where they are one of many Sega and Capcom heroes recruited by Miles \\"Tails\\" Prower and Air Man to battle Sigma. In Sega's Shenmue series, Nights appears in the form of two capsule toys, NiGHTS 1 & NiGHTS 2, that protagonist Ryo Hazuki can collect from one of the various machines scattered throughout Shenmue and Shenmue II. Reception Nights was a runner-up for Electronic Gaming Monthlys Coolest Mascot of 1996 (behind Mario).

Ritzer suggests that in the later part of the 20th century the socially-structured form of the fast-food restaurant has become the organizational force representing and extending the process of rationalization into the realm of everyday interaction and individual identity. McDonald's of the 1990s serves as the case model. The book introduced the term McDonaldization to learned discourse as a way to describe a social process which produces \\"mind-numbing sameness\\", according to a 2002 review of a related academic text. In McDonaldization Ritzer expands and updates central elements from the work of Max Weber and produces a critical analysis of the impact of social-structural change on human interaction and identity. The central theme in Weber's analysis of modern society was the process of rationalization; a far-reaching process whereby traditional modes of thinking were replaced by an ends/means analysis concerned with efficiency and formalized social control. Weber argued that the archetypal manifestation of this process was the bureaucracy; a large, formal organization characterized by a hierarchical authority structure, well-established division of labor, written rules and regulations, impersonality and a concern for technical competence. Bureaucratic organizations not only represent the process of rationalization, the structure they impose on human interaction and thinking furthers the process, leading to an increasingly rationalized world. The process affects all aspects of everyday life.

Description The Scofield Reservoir flows into the Price River (lower right). The river originates in the Wasatch Plateau in central Utah and flows southeastward through Price Canyon, alongside U.S. Route 6, to the cities of Helper and Price. The river flows along the northeastern edge of the San Rafael Swell to the ghost town of Woodside, at which point it proceeds to the east, joining the Green River in Gray Canyon after flowing a distance of . Range Creek is one of its tributaries. The average discharge is approximately 337 cfs. It is generally believed that the Price River was named after LDS Bishop William Price of Goshen, Utah, who explored the region in 1869. The town of Price was later named after the river. The Scofield Reservoir was formed by the construction of the Scofield Dam in 1946. There are plans to build a second dam on the river, upstream from the Scofield Dam, called the Gooseberry Narrows Dam. The proposal has met with opposition out of concern for environmental impacts on trout fisheries in the Price River headwaters and the planned diversion of the water impounded by the dam out of the Colorado River basin to supplement the irrigation systems of the Sanpete Valley. As a result of the planned dam the Price River was included on the American Rivers list of the top ten endangered rivers in the United States in 2005. The Price is a small, shallow river and is normally unnavigable. However, during springtime flows, the below the Scofield Dam to Castle Gate contain Class I to V whitewater. The river has become increasingly popular with canoeists and kayakers.

During his reign, King Eystein I of Norway ordered the construction of mountain stations (fjellstue) along the route that pilgrims followed in visiting the shrine of St. Olav in Trondheim. These stations, including Kongsvoll, were inns where pilgrims crossing the mountain passes could find food and shelter. This one was built along the Driva river in Oppdal. The oldest buildings presently at the site date from 1720. The original inn was located about from where the lodge is now located. In 1701, a landslide damaged the inn. This resulted in a decision to move Kongsvold to the current location. In 1712, construction of the new Kongsvold lodge was started, but during the Great Northern War, Kongsvold and the other mountain lodges in the Dovre Region were burned.

History Located in an Armenian Church, the oldest Christian tombstone in Calcutta belongs to Rezabeebeh, who died on 11 July 1630. The earliest documented references to the mutual relationship of Armenians and Indians are found in Cyropaedia (Persian Expedition), an ancient Greek work by Xenophon (430 BC ‚Äì 355 BC). These references indicate that several Armenians traveled to India.India and Armenia Partners - Embassy of India in Armenia [ENG] An archive directory (published 1956) in Delhi, India states that an Armenian merchant-cum-diplomat, named Thomas Cana, had reached the Malabar Coast in 780 using the overland route. Armenians had trading relations with several parts of India, and by the 7th century a few Armenian settlements had appeared in Kerala, an Indian state located on the Malabar Coast. The Ottoman and the Safavid conquests of the Armenian highlands in the 15th century CE meant that many Armenians dispersed across the Ottoman and Safavid empires, with some eventually reaching Mughal India. During the period of Akbar, Armenians -- such as Akbar's wife Mariam Begum Saheba and a Chief Justice Abdul Hai -- gained prestige in the empire. While Armenians gained prestige serving as governors and generals elsewhere in the empire such as Delhi, Lahore and the Bengal, living in enclosed colonies and establishing churches. Armenians worked as merchants, gun-smiths, gunners, priests and mercenaries for some of the Islamic rulers of India, with many noted to have served in the armies of various nawabs in Bengal and Punjab, such as Khojah Petrus Nicholas and Khojah Gorgin Khan. Thomas Cana was an affluent merchant dealing chiefly in spices and muslins. He was also instrumental in obtaining a decree, inscribed on a copperplate, from the rulers of Malabar, which conferred several commercial, social and religious privileges for the Christians of that region. In current local references, Thomas Cana is known as \\"Knayi Thomman\\" or \\"Kanaj Tomma\\", meaning Thomas the merchant. An additional incentive for Armenian settlements in India was an Armenian agreement with the British East India Company. The agreement was signed in London, on 22 June 1688, and a Julfan merchant, resident in London at the time, signed the treaty on behalf of the ‚ÄúArmenian Nation.‚Äù Competing with the Portuguese and the French, the British wanted to boost the Armenian presence in India, and the agreement accorded special trading privileges to the Armenians, as well as equal rights with British subjects regarding the freedom of residence, travel, religion, and unrestricted access to civil offices. =Former settlements= Dutch-Armenian Cemetery of Surat An Armenian Jew, filmed in the Bourne and Shepherd Calcutta studio Several centuries of presence of Armenians resulted in the emergence of a number of several large and small Armenian settlements in several places in India, including Agra, Surat, Mumbai, Kanpur, Chinsurah, Chandernagore, Calcutta, Saidabad, a suburb of Murshidabad, Chennai, Gwalior, Lucknow, and several other locations currently in the Republic of India. Lahore and Dhaka ‚Äì currently respectively in Pakistan and Bangladesh, ‚Äì but, earlier part of Undivided India, and Kabul, capital of Afghanistan, also had an Armenian population. There were also many Armenians in Burma and Southeast Asia. ; Agra Akbar (1556‚Äì1605), the Mughal emperor, invited Armenians to settle in Agra in the 16th century, and by the middle of the 19th century, Agra had a sizeable Armenian population. By an imperial decree, Armenian merchants were exempted from paying taxes on the merchandise imported and exported by them, and they were also allowed to move around in the areas of the Mughal Empire where entry of foreigners was otherwise prohibited. However, for the Armenians, who were recognized by the emperors for their innovative skills, earned their exceptional status in India. In 1562, an Armenian Church was constructed in Agra. ; Murshidabad Aurangzeb (1658‚Äì1707), a Mughal Emperor, issued a decree which allowed Armenians to form a settlement in Saidabad, a suburb of Murshidabad, then the capital of Mughal subah (province) of Bengal. The imperial decree had also reduced the tax from 5% to 3.5% on two major items traded by them, namely piece goods and raw silk. The decree further stipulated that the estate of deceased Armenians would pass on to the Armenian community. By the middle of the 18th century, Armenians had become a very active, vibrant merchant community of Bengal. In 1758, Armenians had built a Church of the virgin Mary in Saidabad's Khan market. ; Surat 16th century onwards, the Armenians (mostly from Persia) formed an important trading community in Surat, the most active Indian port of that period, located on the western coast of India. The port city of Surat used to have regular sea borne to and fro traffic of merchant vessels from Basra and Bandar Abbas. Armenians of Surat built two Churches and a cemetery there, and a tombstone (of 1579) in Surat bears Armenian inscriptions. The second Church was built in 1778 and was dedicated to Mary. A manuscript written in Armenian language in 1678 (currently preserved in Saltikov-Shchedrin Library, St. Petersburg) has an account of a permanent colony of Armenians in Surat. ; Chennai Landmarks of contributions made to the city of Chennai still exist. Woksan, an Armenian merchant who had amassed a fortune from trade with the Nawab of Arcot, invested a great amount in buildings. The Marmalong Bridge, with many arches across the river Adyar was constructed by him, and a huge sum of maintenance donated to the local authorities. Besides building rest houses for pilgrims, he built the Chapel of Our Lady of Miracles in Madras. The only reminder of the bygone era is the Holy Virgin Mary church of 1772 at 2/A Armenia Street, South Black Town (this area is now called Georgetown). ; Kolkata The Armenians settled in Chinsurah, near Kolkata, West Bengal, and in 1688 built a Church there which is now known as Armenian Church of the Holy Nazareth This is the second oldest Church in Bengal and is still in well preserved on account of the care of the Calcutta Armenian Church Committee.

The company is now in the business of providing video and audio services to sports networks. It never lived up to its dream of being the nation's fourth television network, following the demise of the DuMont Television Network. HTN limited itself to broadcasting sports events, including the Stanley Cup Finals, PBA Bowling and special programming, including the Muppets special The Frog Prince, and provided facilities links to a loose network of stations, who were usually independents or affiliates of ABC, CBS, or NBC. In 2013, HTN Communications merged with The Switch. History =Sports Network Incorporated= Originally working as chief network coordinator at ABC in 1954, Richard Eugene Bailey conceived of a cost- effective means of broadcasting away Major League Baseball games to their home cities. The idea came from the BBDO advertising agency, who appealed to Bailey on behalf of advertisers, Schaefer Beer and Lucky Strike cigarettes, to save money on their broadcast of Brooklyn Dodgers games; Bailey came up with the concept of \\"streamlining transmission operations.\\" This innovation for covering away games became the basis for the Sports Network. Bailey capitalized his company with $1,000. In December 1956, Bailey met with sponsors, ad agencies and the baseball teams' representatives at Chicago's Hotel Knickerbocker to get SNI off the ground. In 1956, the first operational year, the network had 300 television and 1,200 radio broadcasts of major league baseball games. In the fall 1956, SNI started showing Cleveland Browns football games. In later years, they acquired rights to Big Ten and Atlantic Coast Conference basketball. SNI's coverage of the 1963 NCAA final, where Loyola University Chicago upset the University of Cincinnati, was a ratings smash, with a larger audience than CBS' hit westerns Have Gun ‚Äì Will Travel and Gunsmoke. By the early sixties, the Browns (still on SNI) were the only NFL team not signed to a major TV network. At the insistence of new commissioner Pete Rozelle, the Browns dropped SNI when the entire league signed a collective television contract with CBS in 1962. =Hughes Television Network= After Howard Hughes failed to purchase a controlling interest in ABC in 1968, Hughes' Hughes Tool Company purchased the Sports Network and was renamed the Hughes Television Network, with Dick Bailey continuing as president. On a staggered schedule in May 1971, The Frog Prince was shown on HTN with 150 stations including WCBS-TV and sponsored by RJR Foods. Paramount Pictures purchased the Network including its satellite time in planning for Paramount Programming Service in 1976. Paramount sold HTN to Madison Square Garden in 1979. In 1986, Joseph M. Cohen, a Madison Square Garden executive, led an investment group in purchasing HTN from Madison Square Garden. IDB Communications purchased the company in 1989. In March, 1991, HTN purchased fiber optic transmission services from Vyvx NVN to supplement its existing satellite network. In 1995, HTN was purchased by Globecast. In 2003, Cohen acquired the Network again. Programming As Sports Network, the Network broadcast on a network basis sports programming in the following sports: auto racing, baseball, basketball (pro and college), bowling, boxing, dog shows, football (pro and college), frostbite sailing, golf, gymnastics, horse racing, iceboating, ice hockey, jai alai, lacrosse, polo, skiing, soccer, swimming, tennis, track and wrestling.

HTN was reportedly offering a significantly higher price than any other network, including ABC. Reportedly, had Hughes made the deal, half of ABC's affiliates would have carried the HTN football games anyway, including at least one ABC owned-and-operated station. Ultimately, the league agreed that it would be in the NFL's best interests to sign with an established network, eventually striking a deal with ABC for a lower amount than Hughes was offering. =Cleveland Browns broadcasters= *1956 Browns ‚Äì Ken Coleman/Otto Graham *1957 Browns ‚Äì Ken Coleman/Jimmy Dudley *1958 Browns ‚Äì Ken Coleman/Jimmy Dudley *1959 Browns ‚Äì Ken Coleman/Jimmy Dudley *1960 Browns ‚Äì Ken Coleman/Jimmy Dudley *1961 Browns ‚Äì Ken Coleman/Cliff Lewis See also *KLAS-TV *The NHL Network (1975‚Äì79) *Mobil Showcase Network *Fourth television network References External links *HTN Communications ‚Äì official site *Chris Schenkel, Dumont Boxing, Dick Bailey, Howard Hughes, St. Nicholas Arena *Satellite Channel Chart - textfiles.com Category:Defunct television networks in the United States Category:Entertainment companies based in California Category:Howard Hughes Category:Television channels and stations established in 1956 Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 2013 Category:Mass media companies established in 1956 Category:Mass media companies disestablished in 2013 Category:1956 establishments in California Category:2013 disestablishments in California Category:Gulf and Western Industries Category:Defunct companies based in Greater Los Angeles ","title":"Hughes Television Network"},{"id":"1907631","text":"Nathan () was the third of four sons born to King David and Bathsheba in Jerusalem. He was a younger brother of Shammuah (sometimes referred to as Shammua or Shimea), Shobab, and Solomon. Although Nathan is the third son raised by David and Bathsheba, he is the fourth born to Bathsheba. The first son died before he could be named. [For an alternative view of this, see under 'Other Sons of David' below.] Nathan was the first child of Bathsheba that she was given the right to name. Her first child died as an infant before being given a name, and Shammuah and Shobab were given names by David and Nathan the prophet. Biblical writer Carl Hagensick suggests that she chose the name Nathan in honour of Nathan the prophet, her counselor.Hagensick, Carl, ‚ÄúNine Men in the Life of Bathsheba‚Äù, The Herald of Christ's Kingdom, accessed January 27, 2017. . Hebrew Bible Nathan is mentioned as the son of David in and in and . Throughout the Hebrew Bible Nathan is referred to when listing the sons of David. First in 2 Samuel 5:14, \\"And these be the names of those that were born to him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,\\" In 1 Chronicles 3:5 \\"And these were born to him in Jerusalem; Shimea, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, four, of Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel:\\" The last specific mention of Nathan appears in 1 Chronicles 14:4 \\"Now these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,\\" There are also instances in the Hebrew Bible where the name Nathan is mentioned, but it is unknown whether it is referring to Nathan the prophet or Nathan the son of David. One instance of this appears in the first book of the Book of Kings. In it states \\"Azariah son of Nathan‚Äîin charge of the district governors;\\" NIV when listing the chief officials of Israel under the reign of Solomon. The passage does not specify if it is the son of Nathan the prophet or Nathan the son of David. New Testament In the New Testament, the genealogy of Jesus according to the Gospel of Luke traces Jesus' lineage back to King David through the line of Nathan, which the Gospel of Matthew traces it through Solomon, the line of Joseph, his legal father.Matthew 1:6-7 Specifically, in the genealogy of Jesus according to Luke, Jesus' lineage connects to Nathan through the biblical figure Heli, the son of Matthat. Meanwhile, the Gospel of Matthew makes no mention of Nathan. Rather, in Matthew 1:16 Jesus' lineage is connected to Jacob which eventually relates Jesus to Solomon rather than Nathan. One conventional explanation for these differences, from as early as John of Damascus, is that Nathan is the ancestor of the Virgin Mary, while Solomon is the ancestor of Mary's husband Joseph. The blood curse on the line of Jeconiah who was a descendant in the line of Solomon, so the genealogy in Matthew is tainted with a blood curse from Jeconiah all the way to Joseph. No descendant of Jeconiah would qualify as King of Israel.Jeremiah 22:30 Another explanation for these differences is yibbum, as offered by St. John Damascene: \\"One ought also to observe this, that the law was that when a man died without seed, this man's brother should take to wife the wife of the dead man and raise up seed to his brother.\\"Exposition of the Orthodox Faith, chapter XIII From this he proposes it is possible that \\"on the death of Mathan, Melchi, of the tribe of Nathan, the son of Levi and brother of Panther, married the wife of Mathan, Jacob's mother, of whom he begat Heli. Therefore Jacob and Heli became brothers on tile mother's side, Jacob being of the tribe of Solomon and Heli of the tribe of Nathan. Then Heli of the tribe of Nathan died without any children, and Jacob his brother, of the tribe of Solomon, took his wife and raised up seed to his brother and begat Joseph. Joseph, therefore, is by nature the son of Jacob, of the line of Solomon, but by law he is the son of Heli of the line of Nathan.\\" ‚ÄúAn Exact Exposition of the Orthodox Faith by St John Damascene - Book 4.‚Äù Accessed February 9, 2017. http://www.orthodox.net/fathers/exactiv.html#BOOK_IV_CHAPTER_XIV. One other explanation frequently proposed by modern scholars is that biblical genealogy is often based on theology rather than factual history. For example, the title \\"Son of God\\" is used frequently. However, this title would not have been used in the earliest Gospel writings. This explains the differences in genealogies, as Matthew and Luke wrote for different audiences. Johnson, Marshall D. The Purpose of the Biblical Genealogies with Special Reference to the Setting of the Genealogies of Jesus: Eugene, Or.: Wipf & Stock Pub, 2002. Other Sons of David Nathan is a son born to David and Bathsheba. The first book of the Books of Chronicles has a passage that states the sons of David born to him in Hebron, before recounting their sons and then nine more sons and one daughter of David who were also born to him in Jerusalem. 1 Chronicles 3:1-4 states \\"These were the sons of David born to him in Hebron: The firstborn was Amnon the son of Ahinoam of Jezreel; the second, Daniel the son of Abigail of Carmel; the third, Absalom the son of Maakah daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; and the sixth, Ithream, by his wife Eglah. These six were born to David in Hebron, where he reigned seven years and six months.\\" It then lists 4 sons of David and Bathsheba. However we know that their first son died. In 2 Samuel 11 this son is never named. It is therefore possible that he was called Shimea (or Shammua and ) but equally possible, more likely even, that this is a surviving son, although the Bible does not mention him again. We also know from that Solomon was their second son. Assuming that Solomon is mentioned last as the most important, if the others are listed in order this would make Nathan the fourth or fifth son born by Bathsheba (= Bathshua) and therefore tenth or eleventh of David's sons. 1 Chronicles 3:6-9 recounts the others born in Jerusalem. \\"There were also Ibhar, Elishua, Eliphelet, Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, Elishama, Eliada and Eliphelet‚Äînine in all. All these were the sons of David, besides his sons by his concubines. And Tamar was their sister.\\" This means Nathan is one of his nineteen (or twenty) legitimate sons.

To the northwest lie the island of Pantelleria and the Strait of Sicily. All three islands are part of the comune of Lampedusa. Geographically, part of the archipelago (Lampedusa and Lampione) belongs to the African continent and it is an Italian maritime exclave in the Tunisian continental shelf; politically and administratively the islands fall within the Sicilian province of Agrigento and represent the southernmost part of Italy. Despite pockets of agriculture, the islands are unnaturally barren due to wanton deforestation and the disappearance of the native olive groves, juniper and carob plantations. Fifty years ago much of the landscape was farmland bounded by dry stone walls but today, the local economy is based on fishing - sponge fishing and canning - supplemented by tourism in Lampedusa. Marine protected area  The Loggerhead Turtle Of particular ecological concern in the islands is the protection of the Loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) which is endangered throughout the Mediterranean as a result of its nesting sites being taken over by tourism. In Italy the beaches of on Linosa and on Lampedusa are two of the last remaining sites where the turtle regularly lays its eggs, the others (larger) being in southern Calabria (close to Reggio Calabria).

Growing from a national planning effort led by the Library of Congress, the NFPF began operations in 1997. It supports activities nationwide that preserve American films and improve film access for study, education, and exhibition. The NFPF's top priority is saving orphan films, so called because are not protected by commercial interests and are unlikely to survive without public support. Through its grant programs, the NFPF has helped archives, historical societies, libraries, museums, and universities from all 50 states preserve American films and make them available to the public. Background The National Film Preservation Foundation was created by the U.S. Congress in 1996, at the recommendation of the Library of Congress, following four years of hearings and research conducted by the Library's National Film Preservation Board. The National Film Preservation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-285, Title II), signed into law on October 11, 1996, charged the NFPF to \\"encourage, accept, and administer private gifts to promote and ensure the preservation and public accessibility of the nation's film heritage\\" and authorized federal funds to advance this work. The NFPF started operations a year later in 1997 as an independent federally chartered grant-giving public charity and the nonprofit charitable affiliate of the Library of Congress's National Film Preservation Board. Since 1996 Congress has increased the NFPF's authorization twice, in 2005 via the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-9) and in 2008 via the Library of Congress Sound Recording and Film Preservation Programs Reauthorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-336). Funding received through the NFPF's authorization is secured through the Library of Congress and goes directly to the field for film preservation projects. Grant program Federal funding received by the NFPF is made available through competitive grants. The program is open to American nonprofit and public institutions of all sizes and experience levels. Awards are made by expert panels, which are recruited from the preservation and scholarly communities and serve on behalf of the NFPF Board. To receive an award, institutions must pledge to provide public access to their films and to store them under cool-and-dry conditions that will extend their useful life. Films preserved through the NFPF are made available for education and shared with the public via screenings, exhibits, DVDs, broadcasts, and the Internet. Since starting its grant program in 1998, the NFPF has assisted 239 institutions across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico and has helped save more than 1,870 films. Films preserved through NFPF grants range from silent-era films to industrials, documentaries, newsreels, culturally significant home movies, avant-garde works, and independent productions. Cooperative projects The NFPF also organizes, secures funding for, and manages cooperative projects that enable film organizations‚Äîlarge and small‚Äîto join forces on national and international projects. Some of its previous and current projects include: *Treasure of American Film Archives (1999‚Äì2000). Funded by the National Endowment for the Arts and The Pew Charitable Trusts, this project involved 18 archives and resulted in new preservation work for more than 100 films and footage collections, ranging from home movies of Duke Ellington's band on tour to the first feature film shot entirely in Alaska. The collaboration culminated in the Treasures from American Film Archives: 50 Preserved Films (2000), the first volume of the NFPF's award-winning Treasures DVD series. *Saving the Silents (2001‚Äì2002). Funded by the Department of Interior's Save America's Treasures fund and administered by the National Endowment for the Arts, this project produced new 35mm preservation masters and prints of 94 films endangered silent-era shorts, serials, and features from the collections of George Eastman House, the Museum of Modern Art, and UCLA Film & Television Archive. Also supported was a massive updating of the International Federation of Film Archives' authoritative database of surviving silent-era film titles. *The Film Connection (2008-2010). Through this project, eight short American silent films held by the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia‚Äîthat no longer survived in the United States‚Äîwere preserved and deposited at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, George Eastman House, the Library of Congress, the Museum of Modern Art, and UCLA Film & Television Archive. Six of the films can be viewed free or charge on the NFPF Web site. *The New Zealand Project (2010‚Äì2014). With funding from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and a Save America's Treasures grant administered by the National Park Service and the National Endowment for the Arts, this project will result in the preservation and repatriation of more than 130 American silent films held by the New Zealand Film Archive. Among the films are many once thought lost, such as Upstream (1927) by John Ford and The White Shadow (1924) by Graham Cutts and Alfred Hitchcock. Publications The NFPF publishes DVD sets and books that promote the preservation of American film. For more than a decade, the NFPF's Treasures from American Film Archives DVD series has made available preservation work from the archival community. Created in collaboration with archives, scholars, and musicians, the sets present long unseen American films with new musical accompaniment, onscreen program notes, and a printed catalog. Besides the Treasures DVDs, the NFPF has also published two reference books, The Field Guide to Sponsored Films (2006) and The Film Preservation Guide: The Basics for Archives, Libraries, and Museums (2004).

Film historian Peter Hames has described him as the \\"enfant terrible of the Czech New Wave.\\"  Biography  Nƒõmec's career as a filmmaker started in the late 1950s when he attended FAMU. At that time, Czechoslovakia was a communist state subservient to the USSR, and artistic and public expression was subject to censorship and government review. However, thanks largely to the failure of purely propagandist cinema in the early 1950s and the presence of important and powerful people such as Jan Proch√°zka within the Czechoslovak film industry, the 1960s led to an internationally acknowledged creative surge in Czechoslovak film that became known as the Czech New Wave, in which Nƒõmec played a part. = Professional = For graduation, Nƒõmec adapted a short story by Arno≈°t Lustig based on the author's experience of the Holocaust. Nƒõmec would return to Lustig's writing to direct the influential film Diamonds of the Night (1964), also based on the Holocaust. That film follows the fate of two boys who escape from a train taking them to a concentration camp. It is noted for its dramatic subjectivization of the experience of the Holocaust using experimental techniques including flashbacks, simulated hallucinations, and an unusual double ending that leaves the viewer in doubt as to the fate of its protagonists. It was his first major success, and while it passed the censors' reviews, it helped lay the foundation for the political movement that was coming. The film has since been called an aesthetic and technical milestone in the exploration of human experience under extreme conditions. His best known work is A Report on the Party and the Guests (1966). Its plot revolves around a group of friends on a picnic who are invited to a bizarre banquet by a charismatic sadist, played by Ivan Vyskoƒçil, who eventually bullies most of them into blind conformity and brutality while those who resist are hunted down. The film received a particularly bad reception from the authorities as Vyskoƒçil in the film had a remarkable likeness to Lenin, though according to Peter Hames this was accidental. Moreover, the cast consisted of various dissident Czechoslovak intellectuals of the day, including Josef ≈†kvoreck√Ω. The film was viewed as being so subversive to the Communist state that Anton√≠n Novotn√Ω, the president, was said to \\"climb the walls\\" on viewing it and Nƒõmec's arrest for subversion was considered. However, before the political fallout from this was able to take effect, he managed to have one more feature approved: Martyrs of Love (1966). Perhaps in consideration of the previous troubles he had suffered, the film was completely apolitical, but nevertheless its surrealist lyrical style did not endear it to the authorities. In 1967 Nƒõmec made a short film Mother and Son (1967) during three days at Amsterdam film festival. The film won an award at the Oberhausen Film Festival. He was in the middle of shooting a documentary about Prague Spring for US producer when Warsaw Pact invasion happened. He smuggled his footage of invasion to Vienna, where it was broadcast on Austrian television. He edited the footage together with the Prague Spring documentary and released the film as Oratorio for Prague. It received standing ovations in New York Film Festival in the fall of 1968. Nƒõmec's footage would eventually be used by countless international news organizations as stock footage of the invasion. Philip Kaufman's film adaptation of The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988) used footage from the film; Nƒõmec also served as an advisor. Nƒõmec was fired from Barrandov and subsequently only made a short documentary film about ambulence Mezi 4 - 5 minutou in 1972. He emigrated in 1974. He was given a warning by the government that \\"... if he came back, they would find some legal excuse to throw him in jail.\\" From 1974 to 1989, he lived in Germany, Paris, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States. He stayed in the United States for twelve years. Unable to work in traditional cinema, he was a pioneer in using video cameras to record weddings, including documenting the nuptials of the Swedish royal family. After the fall of communism in Czechoslovakia in 1989, he returned to his native country, where he had made several films, including Code Name Ruby (1997) and Late Night Talks with Mother (2000), which won the Golden Leopard at Locarno. He had been a professor at his alma mater, FAMU, since 1996. In 2014, he protested against the president of the Czech Republic Milo≈° Zeman by returning the medals given to him by the first president of the Czech Republic V√°clav Havel. =Personal life and death= He married costume designer and screenwriter Ester Krumbachov√° in 1963; they divorced in 1968. In 1970 he married singer Marta Kubi≈°ov√°; they divorced in 1973. He married his third wife Veronica Baumann, a Czech language teacher, in 1984; they divorced in 2003. He married film editor Iva Ruszelakova shortly after. In May 2003, Nƒõmec became a father. Nƒõmec died of an illness on 18 March 2016; he was 79.

It administratively belongs to Bab al-Mandab District, Taiz Governorate. The island of Perim divides the strait of Mandeb into two channels. The island was a part of the British Empire between 1857 and 1967. Etymology Perim is called the island of Diodorus (Diodori insula) by Pliny the Elderhttp://www.trismegistos.org/geo/authors_georef_list.php?tm=3616 and by the author of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. Perim possibly derives from the Arab term Barim (chain) associated with the history of the Straits and one of its Arab names, the other Arab name being Mayyun. The Portuguese called it Majun or Meho (from Mayyun), although Albuquerque had solemnly named the island Vera Cruz in 1513. On many British and French maps of the 17th and 18th century the island is called Babelmandel, as the Straits are. Some early 19th century navigation guides still call it the island of Bab-el-Mandeb although they may mention that it is also called Perim.India Directory, or Directions for Sailing to and from the East Indies,[...], London 1836. By the time the British permanently occupied the island in 1857, the name Perim had come into general usage. Geography Satellite picture showing Perim and the Bab el- Mandeb Peninsula Perim island is an eroded fragment of the southwest flank of a late Miocene volcano whose center was on the southwesternmost tip of Arabia. The volcano is the westernmost of the east‚Äìwest line of six central vent volcanoes (the Aden line) that extends 200 km (125 mi) along the coast of Arabia from Perim to Aden. It is believed that the volcanism is related to an eastward-propagating rift produced before the most recent stage of sea-floor spreading in the Gulf of Aden. Perim is crab-shaped, 5.63 km (3.5 mi) long and 2.85 km (1.77 mi) wide. It has a surface area of 13 km2 (5.0 sq mi) and rises to an altitude of 65 m (213 ft). Perim encloses a deep and comparatively large natural harbour on the southwestern coast. The fishing village of Mayyun is located at the bottom of the bay. The island divides the 32 km (20 mi) wide Bab-el-Mandeb into two: the Large Strait, with an average width of 17 km (11 mi), and the Small Strait, varying from 5 km to 2.5 km (3 mi to 1.5 mi) in width. The Large Strait is generally deep water varying from about 100 fathoms or more in the middle channel to about 3 to 6 fathoms close to the coastal reefs. The depth of the Small Strait varies from 12 to 15 ¬Ω fathoms and is free from navigational changes in the fairway but strong and irregular tidal streams make navigation hazardous. There have been frequent shipwrecks in the vicinity of Perim, particularly in the Small Strait. The absence of fresh water on the island has always been one of the major difficulties impeding permanent settlement. Although there are occasional heavy rains, there may be stretches of eight months or more without rain; the long-term average rainfall (in 1821‚Äì1912) was about 60 mm per year. Vegetation is very scarce. History Perim shown on an early Portuguese map The Ottoman fleet protecting shipping in the Gulf of Aden The straits of Bab-el-Mandeb were probably witness to the earliest migrations of modern humans out of Africa roughly 60,000 years ago. At this time the oceans were much lower because so much water was frozen in Ice Age glaciers and the straits were much shallower or dry. Despite its sheltered natural harbour and strategic location at the entrance of the Red Sea, Perim was largely bypassed by written history until the middle of the 19th century, in good part because the bare, waterless island could not easily sustain life. As a result, only fishermen and pearl divers lived there seasonally, building reed huts with material brought from elsewhere. In 1513, Afonso de Albuquerque, as part of the Portuguese bid to seize control of the trade routes to the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, attacked Aden near the entrance to the Red Sea but failed to capture the fortified city. Having failed in his main objective, he nonetheless sailed for the Red Sea. The Red Sea pilots of those days lived on an island close to Perim and one was secured by sending forward as a decoy an Indian-built ship. The passage of the first Portuguese ship through the Bab-el-Mandeb was the occasion for much ceremony. After having spent some time at the island of Kamaran in preparation for an attack on Jeddah that could not be carried out due to contrary winds, the fleet left Kamaran on its return journey. Perim, which Albuquerque named Vera Cruz, was inspected and pronounced unfit for a fortress due to lack of water. During the following years, the Portuguese tried several more times to conquer Aden and gain the mastery of the Red Sea, harassing shipping and battling the Egyptian Mamluk, then Ottoman navies, which gradually gained the upper hand. These actions as well as the sending of an annual fleet to blockade the Bab-el-Mandeb and prevent Indian merchant ships from entering the Red Sea most likely involved frequent use of Perim‚Äôs natural harbour. By the time the Ottomans captured Aden from its local ruler in 1538, the Ottoman fleet was taking control of the Red Sea, maintaining firm control of the Red Sea, the Bab-el-Mandeb and Aden until the 1630s when the Turks were expelled from Yemen and the south half of the Red Sea. A French naval squadron may have used Perim's natural harbor in the course of a punitive expedition against nearby Mocha in 1737.Some British historians reported that the French occupied and even annexed the island in 1737 but a French naval historian found nothing about such an occupation in the logbook of the expedition. In 1799, the island was briefly occupied by the British East India Company in preparation for the invasion of Egypt. =Perim under British rule= Perim and Aden Steamers being coaled at Perim circa 1910 The Perim Hotel, with its bar, billiard room and other amenities, was at the center of Perim's meager social life In 1856, seeing the French-sponsored Suez Canal project as a method to promote French power at Britain‚Äôs expense, Prime Minister Palmerston agreed to the occupation of Perim as one of many options to counter assumed French political and military ambitions in Egypt and the Red Sea. In December 1856, Lord Elphinstone, the governor of Bombay, wrote to the Resident of Aden that \\"on the subject of Perim, [..] we have been directed to occupy the island, and that it is the intention of Her Majesty's government that a lighthouse should be built there.\\" He added that since the island had already been taken possession of in the name of the East India Company in 1799, it was considered as a part of the dependencies of India, and therefore no formalities of any kind was necessary. The Resident immediately proceeded to organize a small landing party for the peaceful occupation of the uninhabited island. The actual decision to occupy might have been precipitated by an unfounded report that the French, who were said to have been surveying the area for some time, had dispatched a frigate from R√©union to annex the island..Contemporary French archives indicate that neither the French government nor the French navy showed interest in Perim. Nevertheless, the episode gave birth to a Royal Navy urban legend according to which during the frigate's stopover in Aden, the French captain and officials were wined and dined until they were too intoxicated to set sail, giving time to the British to quickly dispatch a vessel to Perim to hoist the British flag. C. R. Low, History of the Indian Navy (1613-1863), Volume 2, p. 385-386. The declared reason for the occupation, however, was the urgent need to erect a lighthouse at the entrance of the notoriously dangerous Bab el Mandeb and indeed, after much bickering about the location and other factors, an 11-meter high lighthouse was finally built and inaugurated on 1 April 1861. Despite the lighthouse's operation, the treacherous waters around Perim continued to claim many vessels..Peter Pickering & Ingleby Jefferson (2012), Perim Lighthouse, section of Perim Island - The Last Colonial Outpost. Perim was attached to Aden, itself a dependency of the Bombay Presidency, British India. For the next two decades, the only sign of British occupation was the lighthouse and a small detachment from the Aden garrison. Otherwise, the barren waterless island was left to the few fishermen and Somali herders who went there.. Occasional proposals by an Aden coaling company to open a branch on the island did not materialize. While Aden had a fine natural harbour, it became ineffective starting in the mid-19th century as iron and steel ships of greater draught were being built. Starting in the 1860s, many of the larger steamers had to stay well off Aden Harbour, making the process of coaling and taking in provisions both time-consuming and hazardous.. This deficiency was not to be overcome until dredging and re-dredging projects began in earnest in the early 1890s.. Naval repair facility c. 1900 In 1881, a complete outsider, Hinton Spalding of London, was granted permission to start a coaling station on Perim, whose inner harbour could accommodate vessels of any draught. With the backing of a number of large ship-owners, he launched the Perim Coal Company (PCC) and on 29 August 1883 the first steamer was coaled in Perim Harbour. This marked the beginning of a struggle between Aden and Perim for the Red Sea coaling business that was to be waged by the two ports until the mid-1930s.. Perim island and lighthouse in the 1880s Passengers ashore while their ship is being refuelled During those 50 years, Perim was to be entirely geared to coaling: the harbour, roads and accommodation for workers were laid out for this purpose and no other interests or activities were allowed to hinder the coaling. As for Perim‚Äôs lack of water, it was no more a drawback than at Aden: both ports supplied water from condensers to the ships since Aden water, delivered from out of town, was considered too brackish for the purpose. Before long the PCC was also able to grab the lion‚Äôs share of the salvage business due to it being very near the most dangerous waters in the area.. Between 1923 and 1927 more coal was being loaded at Perim than at Aden.. However, Perim‚Äôs decline came fast due to its failure to grab a share of the fast-growing oil fuel business that was cornered by Aden as coal- burning steamers were being retired. The PCC went bankrupt in 1935 and Perim slipped back into insignificance. During the First World War, the Turks in Arabia sent a force to threaten Aden and the British communications along the Red Sea. This included an assault on Perim on June 14 and 15 of 1915 when Turks landed on the north coast of the island. They were driven off by a detachment of the 23rd Sikh Pioneers garrisoned on the island under the command of Captain A.G.C. Hutchinson. The troops on the mainland facing the island were subsequently pushed back by troops from Aden supported by the Royal Navy and by the end of the year all threat to the island of Perim had been removed.Stephen Luscombe, \\"Perim Island\\". The British Empire. Accessed 2017-04-18. =British withdrawal and aftermath= The British presence continued until 1967 when the island became part of the People's Republic of South Yemen. Before the handover, the British government had put forward before the United Nations a proposal for the island to be internationalised as a way to ensure continued security of passage and navigation in the Bab-el- Mandeb,. but it was refused. Soon after independence in November 1967, South Yemen extended its territorial waters to 12 miles, which would include the waters between Perim and the mainland. Despite fears expressed by the British government and others, there was no interference with international shipping,. until 1971 when the new radical Marxist government of what was now the People‚Äôs Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) allowed a group of PFLP guerillas to attack an Israel-bound tanker in the Bab-el-Mandeb from Perim. During the October War, South Yemeni artillery on Perim, along with Egyptian naval units, imposed an undeclared blockade at the southern entrance of the Red Sea. However, after the 1973 blockade, there were to be no further cases of interference with international shipping.. The PDRY established close political and military ties with the Soviet Union which resulted in Soviet naval forces gaining access to the former British naval base at Aden as well as to the islands of Perim and Socotra. This strong Soviet military presence faded rapidly after the 1986 military coup in South Yemen and the advent of Perestroika under Mikhail Gorbachev. =2015 Yemen Civil War= After the Houthi takeover in Yemen, the Houthis moved to capture Perim island to consolidate their influence and gain access to the important trade route across the Bab-el-Mandeb strait. Most of Perim's native inhabitants which numbered around 4,500 were originally banished from the island during the British‚ÄìSoviet satellite states split to form the island as a military base. After the beginning of the 2015 Yemen civil war, some of the originally displaced Perim natives joined the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen to regain the island from the Houthis. The local Yemeni inhabitants launched an assault on the Houthis with the support of the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces. The native Perim islanders eventually defeated the Houthis in a violent battle that lasted a couple of hours and led to a power plant being destroyed. The Houthis accused the coalition of being \\"invaders\\". The Houthis planted multiple mines in the island and according to the local native leader, there's still a lot of obstacles to return the island to normal life. Yemen-Djibouti Bridge Project In 2008, a $200-billion mega-project for the construction of a transcontinental bridge linking Yemen and Djibouti via Perim Island, the Bridge of the Horns, was announced by a Dubai-based company, Al Noor Holding Investments. At around , it would be one of the longest bridges in the world and its suspension portion the longest. However, in June 2010 it was announced that the start of Phase I, the bridge between the mainland of Yemen and Perim, was delayed until a framework agreement between Djibouti and Yemen was signed. As of July 2020, nothing more has been heard of the project.

Copyright is 1995. No ISBN.) As indicated by the name \\"Stored Program\\", the SP-1 introduced computer control to the telephone switching market. (AT&T;'s #1ESS preceded the SP-1 by several years.) A central computer controlled the operation of the switch. Switch behavior was determined by the operation of a computer program. With its use of computer hardware and software control, the SP-1 marked an evolutionary step in telephony design. It was an intermediate form between the previous generation of electromechanical systems and the next generation of fully digital systems. Like the previous generation of systems, the SP-1 was an analog switch that used a special form of mechanical relay (Minibar crossbar switch) to provide the voice connections. The voice signal remained in the analog domain throughout the exchange, with the crossbar switches providing a metallic path to connect the end points of a call together. However the SP1 replaced the previous generation's complex relay-based controllers (markers) with a modern Harvard architecture electronic computer, with separate data and program memories. SSI DTL logic was used throughout. Two types of memory was used - ferrite sheet memory for the CPU and Piggyback Twistor memory for the storage of program and routing information. A number of variations on the base switch were available. A \\"two wire\\" version for local service, a four wire version for toll service. Two/four wire versions were also available as was a TOPS variant that was used to provide Operator services. The first four wire switch (four wire-tops, i.e., it provided toll switching and operator services) was placed in service in Thunder Bay circa 1972. The operator service consoles (CRTs) used an Intel 4004 processor. The next generation of systems evolved from the SP1 design to replace the analog switch with a digital technology. SP-1 proved the feasibility of software-controlled systems for telephony. It set the stage for the introduction of fully digital systems with the development of the DMS (Digital Multiplex Systems) by Nortel in the 1970s. (Nortel's SL-1 (PBX) was Nortel's first fully digital switching system, and it was introduced in service in 1975.)

Today they still accord the ariki respect and assist in matters concerning land, traditional ceremonies and so forth. In pre-Christian times, the mataiapo were traditionally appointed by the ariki and given their titles in recognition of bravery in warfare or service to the ariki. With their titles came land and respect. They are invested by the ariki in huge ceremonies that still take place today. A significant act in the ceremony is when the mataiapo bites the ear of a whole roasted pig (usually the largest to be found in the village) which immediately indicates that the person has become a mataiapo. After the arrival of European missionaries, women were allowed to hold the titles of ariki, mataiapo and rangatira.

It is located on a historic, beautifully landscaped 40 acre campus in Menlo Park, California, 35 miles south of San Francisco, in the heart of Silicon Valley. Since its founding, on September 20, 1898, by San Francisco Archbishop Patrick William Riordan, with a faculty from the Sulpician order and thirty-four young men, the seminary and university has grown considerably. In over 100-years, it has formed more than 2,000 priests. This school is governed by the Archdiocese of San Francisco in association with its other sponsoring western and Pacific Rim dioceses. The Archbishop of San Francisco, Most Reverend Salvatore J. Cordileone, serves as the President and Chancellor of the Seminary and University. The President- Rector is Rev. Daniel B. Donohoo. The seminary and university is fully accredited as a graduate educational institution by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, and the Congregation for Catholic Education in Rome. In the Spring 2018 semester, the seminary had an enrollment of 53 men, representing 11 dioceses. History The second Archbishop of San Francisco, Archbishop Patrick William Riordan established St Patrick's Seminary in Menlo Park in 1898, in cooperation with the Society of Saint Sulpice‚Äîa French-based order of priests dedicated to educating (forming) future priests. To thank the generous Irish laypersons and clergy who helped to fund and support the Seminary, Riordan named it in honor of Saint Patrick of Armagh, the Apostle of Ireland. By this time, the Sulpician order had committed five priests, three Frenchmen and two Americans to staff the seminary. The first rector was Rev. Father Jean-Baptiste Vuibert, S.S. On August 24, 1898, the seminary was solemnly dedicated by Riordan, joined by Bishops George Montgomery of Los Angeles and Thomas Grace of Sacramento, along with more than 100 clergy. On September 20, 1898 the seminary received 31 high school students and 3 college-level students. The first annual commencement exercises took place on May 31, 1899 and were presided over by Riordan. As the seminary continued to develop, a Department of Philosophy was established with six students. In 1903, the Little Sisters of the Holy Family arrived from Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada, to take care of the domestic services such as cooking, laundry and cleaning. They have since returned to Canada due to a lack of religious vocations, but currently working in their stead are the Oblates of Jesus the Priest. The Society of Saint Sulpice withdrew completely from St. Patrick's Seminary & University on June 30, 2017. Clerical formation Students are admitted to Saint Patrick Seminary on the recommendation of their diocesan bishop after intensive psychological testing and rigorous interviews. The program consists of four years of spiritual, academic and pastoral formation in residence. Following the second year of studies, a candidate undergoes a year of intensively supervised pastoral experience. Normally, a candidate is called to the diaconate by his bishop in the fall semester of his last year, to serve in a local parish for the remainder of that year before being called to the presbyterate. All candidates undergo formation which includes daily participation in the Liturgy of the Hours and the Eucharist, as well as spiritual exercises and special devotions. For continued studies at Saint Patrick's, all candidates must conform to the standards of moral and academic fitness required by the seminary in accordance with its directives and prescriptions for its program of priestly formation. Candidates deemed unsuitable for seminary life or for the priesthood are either put on probation or dismissed outright from the seminary community.

This geologic structure consists of the Bombay High and Surat Depression. They lie beneath the Indian continental shelf and the Arabian Sea west of Mumbai, India. Chatterjee named this structure after Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction and renewal.Chatterjee, S., N. Guven, A. Yoshinobu, and R. Donofrio.

Museum of Texas Tech University Special Publications. 50, 39pp. It is presently (2019) on the list of probable impact cratersShiva and is rated '1' based on three-step confidence level criteria of Anna Mikheeva of Russian Academy of Sciences (0 for proven, 1 for probable, 2 for potential, 3 for questionable and 4 for discredited),* , 2017 applied to the impact sites that have appeared several times in the literature and/or have been endorsed by the Impact Field Studies Group (IFSG)Impact Field Studies Group and/or Expert Database on Earth Impact Structures (EDEIS).Expert Database on Earth Impact Structures  Arguments  Chatterjee argues that the Shiva Crater was formed around 65 million years ago, about the same time as a number of other impact craters and the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event (Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene boundary / K-Pg boundary). Although the site has shifted since its formation because of sea floor spreading, the formation is approximately long by wide. It is estimated that this proposed crater would have been made by an asteroid or comet approximately in diameter. At the time of the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction, India was located over the R√©union hotspot of the Indian Ocean. Hot material rising from the mantle flooded portions of India with a vast amount of lava, creating a plateau known as the Deccan Traps. It has been hypothesized that either the crater or the Deccan Traps associated with the area are the reason for the high level of oil and natural gas reserves in the region. = Geology and morphology = Unlike typical known extraterrestrial impact structures, Shiva is teardrop shaped, roughly . It is also unusually rectangular. Chatterjee argues that the low angle of an impact combined with boundary fault lines and unstable rock led to this unusual formation. The age of the structure is inferred from the Deccan Traps which overlie part of it. = Shiva and mass extinction = The proposed Shiva Crater and other possible impact craters along with the Chicxulub have led to the hypothesis that multiple impacts caused the massive extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous period. Chatterjee is confident that Shiva was one of many impacts, stating that \\"the K-T extinction was definitely a multiple-impact scenario.\\"Rampino, M. R., and B. M. Haggerty (1996) The ‚ÄúShiva Hypothesis‚Äù: Impacts, mass extinctions, and the galaxy. Earth, Moon, and Planets. 72(1‚Äì3):441‚Äì460. Other theories have argued that since the Chicxulub impact is believed by some researchers to have occurred earlier than the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, Shiva's impact was enough to cause the mass extinction by itself.Davis, J. W. (2006) archived copy of Texas Tech Paleontologist Finds Evidence That Meteorite Strike Near Bombay May Have Wiped Out Dinosaurs. Texas Tech Today, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas. Evidence published in a 2013 Science article by Paul R. Renne at the University of California at Berkeley suggests that the Chicxulub crater is in fact within the time frame of when the mass extinction occurred.

The Franck‚ÄìCondon principle and the Slater‚ÄìCondon rules are co-named after him.Edward Condon was elected as a member of the US National Academy of Sciences in 1944. He was the director of the National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) from 1945 to 1951. In 1946, Condon was president of the American Physical Society, and in 1953 was president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. During the McCarthy period, when efforts were being made to root out communist sympathizers in the United States, Edward Condon was a target of the House Un-American Activities Committee on the grounds that he was a 'follower' of a 'new revolutionary movement', quantum mechanics; Condon defended himself with a famous commitment to physics and science. Condon became widely known in 1968 as principal author of the Condon Report, an official review funded by the United States Air Force that concluded that unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have prosaic explanations. The lunar crater Condon is named for him. Background Figure 1. Franck‚ÄìCondon principle energy diagram. Since electronic transitions are very fast compared with nuclear motions, vibrational levels are favored when they correspond to a minimal change in the nuclear coordinates. The potential wells are shown favoring transitions between v = 0 and v = 2 Edward Uhler Condon was born on March 2, 1902, in Alamogordo, New Mexico, to William Edward Condon and Carolyn Uhler. His father was supervising the construction of a narrow-gauge railroad,Morse, 125 many of which were built in the area by logging companies. After graduating from high school in Oakland, California in 1918, he worked as a journalist for three years at the Oakland Inquirer and other papers. He then attended the University of California, Berkeley, initially joining the College of Chemistry; when he learned that his high school physics teacher had joined the faculty, he switched majors to take classes in theoretical physics.Morse, 126 Condon earned his bachelor's degree in three years and his doctorate in two. His Ph.D. thesis combined work by Raymond Thayer Birge on measuring and analyzing band spectral intensities and a suggestion by James Franck.Morse, 127 Thanks to a National Research Council fellowship, Condon studied at G√∂ttingen under Max Born and at Munich under Arnold Sommerfeld. Under the latter, Condon rewrote his Ph.D. thesis using quantum mechanics, creating the Franck‚ÄìCondon principle. After seeing an ad in Physical Review, Condon worked in public relations at Bell Telephone Laboratories in fall 1927, in particular promoting their discovery of electron diffraction.Morse, 128 Career =Early career= Arnold Sommerfeld, German theoretical physicist taught Condon during the 1920s Condon taught briefly at Columbia University and was associate professor of physics at Princeton University from 1928 to 1937, except for a year at the University of Minnesota.Wang, \\"Security,\\" 242 With Philip M.

He then headed the company's research on microwave radar development. He also worked on the equipment used to isolate uranium for use in atomic bombs. He served as a consultant to the National Defense Research Committee during World War II and helped organize MIT's Radiation Laboratory. On May 11, 1940, Condon showcased his machine called the Nimatron at the 1940 New York World Fair. Condon filed for the patent on April 26, 1940 and got it on September 24, 1940 for his innovating machine, Nimatron. =Government service= J. Robert Oppenheimer (circa 1944) led the Manhattan Project, on which Condon briefly served in the early 1940s during WWII In 1943, Condon joined the Manhattan Project. Within six weeks, he resigned as a result of conflicts about security with General Leslie R. Groves, the project's military leader. General Groves had objected when Condon's superior J. Robert Oppenheimer held a discussion with the director of the project's Metallurgical Lab at the University of Chicago.Bird and Sherwin, 223-224 In his resignation letter, he explained: From August 1943 to February 1945, Condon worked as a part-time consultant at Berkeley on the separation of U-235 and U-238.Wang, \\"Security,\\" 243 Condon was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1944.Wang, \\"Security,\\" 241 Following the war, Condon played a leading role in organizing scientists to lobby for civilian control of atomic energy rather than military control under strict security.Wang, \\"Security,\\" 243-4 He worked as science adviser to Senator Brien McMahon, chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Atomic Energy, which wrote the McMahon-Douglas Act, enacted in August 1946, that created the Atomic Energy Commission, placing atomic energy under civilian control. Adopting an internationalist viewpoint, Condon favored international scientific cooperation and joined the American-Soviet Science Society.Wang, \\"Security,\\" 244, 244n15 U.S. Commerce Secretary (and former U.S. Vice President) Henry A. Wallace came to know Condon and in October 1945 recommended him as director of the National Bureau of Standards (NBS, now known as NIST). President Harry S. Truman agreed to nominate him. The Senate confirmed his nomination without opposition. Condon served as NBS director until 1951. He was also president of the American Physical Society in 1946. Condon was also either a member or associated with the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions (ICCASP). =Attacks= 1940s J.

On May 29, 1946, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover wrote a letter intended for President Truman that named several senior government officials as part of a Soviet network. It described Condon as \\"nothing more or less than an espionage agent in disguise.\\" (Decades later Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan called it \\"baseless corridor talk.\\") The Truman administration ignored Hoover's charges.Moynihan, Secrecy, 63-8 On March 21, 1947, Truman signed United States Executive Order 9835 AKA the \\"Loyalty Order.\\"Harry S.

Parnell Thomas (1939) attacked Condon's reputation in 1947 and 1948 Nevertheless, a HUAC report dated March 2, 1948 stated, \\"It appears that Dr. Condon is one of the weakest links in our atomic security\\". Condon responded: \\"If it is true that I am one of the weakest links in atomic security that is very gratifying and the country can feel absolutely safe for I am completely reliable, loyal, conscientious and devoted to the interests of my country, as my whole life and career clearly reveal\\".Wang, \\"Security,\\" 248-9 On March 3, 1948, Senator Dennis Ch√°vez (Dem-NM) read into the Congressional Record an article by Marquis Childs, which stated: > The current loyalty witch hunt is shown in its shabbiest and meanest form in > the attack on Dr. Edward U. Condon... It relies almost on guilt by > association. Because Dr. Condon, head of the National Bureau of Standards, > talked to the wife of the Polish Ambassador and to two or three attach√©s of > Soviet and satellite embassies, the committee demands his discharge. \\"It is > known,\\" said a letter quoted by the committee and purportedly from the FBI, > \\"that in February 1947 Zlotowski (an attach√© in the Polish Embassy) > purchased 270 books on atomic energy which had been published by the > Department of Commerce\\"... ‚ÄùTo fair-minded Americans it will seem clear that > Condon is being persecuted because he was appointed head of the Bureau of > Standards by Henry Wallace when Wallace was Secretary of Commerce.\\" On March 5, 1948, Representative George MacKinnon (Rep-MN) stated: \\"Mr. Speaker, today's paper carries the story that the Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Harriman, has refused to respond to a congressional subpoena to supply information with respect to one Dr. Condon. I am not presuming to pass on the facts in that case, but I do wish to point out that this follows the same pattern of Secrecy as the administration has been following with respect to congressional subpoenas throughout this entire session.\\" On March 6, 1948, a Washington Post editorial stated, \\"There is an abundance of precedent for the Secretary's refusal to turn over his department's loyalty board files on Dr. Edward U. Condon.\\" The Post also objected to an alternative proposal to send files on the Condon case to the top-level \\"Loyalty Review Board\\" in the Civil Service Commission. The Commerce Department's own loyalty board had already cleared Condon, and the Post argued that this decision should stand. On March 8, 1948, Representative Chester E. Holifield (Dem-CA) noted: \\"...calling the attention of the Members to H. R. 4641, a bill which I introduced December 4, 1947. The purpose of this bill is to prescribe the procedures of investigating committees of the Congress and to protect the rights of parties under investigation by such committees. If this bill could be enacted, it would extend to a world-famous scientist, such as Dr. E. U. Condon, the same protection which is now available to a chicken thief or a traffic violator; that is, the right of defense against his accusers. Character assassination under the cloak of congressional immunity by a Member of Congress or a Congressional committee is a dangerous and abominable travesty.\\" On March 9, 1948, Representative Glen H. Taylor (Dem-ID), then Progressive Party vice presidential candidate, stated: > It is very difficult, Mr. President, to stand up against this diabolical > Witchhunt. Witness the attack on Dr. Edward Condon the last few days. Here > is a great American scientist, one of the greatest, who had already been > cleared of suspicion; but in this witch hunt business, Mr. President, there > is such a thing as double jeopardy.

On the same day, Representative Emanuel Celler (Dem-NY) stated: > \\"I believe the attitude and the action of the Un-American Activities > Committee toward a very famous scientist, Ur. Edward U. Condon, has been > very unjust and unfair. The conduct of that committee on the Condon case is > typical. Dr. Condon has been deliberately made a victim of popular hysteria > against Russia.

The committee deliberately disregarded the > views of the FBI. which said in effect that there was no evidence of > disloyalty of Dr. Condon.\\" On the same day, Representative Leo Isacson (ALP-NY) stated, \\"It is no coincidence that this attack on Dr. Condon‚Äîan attack abhorred and shamed in all responsible opinion of press and science comes at this particular moment‚Äîat this moment when the House Committee on Un-American Activities seeks the most swollen appropriation it has ever Ventured to ask of a Congress.\\" Holifield added, \\"The technique used by the committee counsel is biased and prejudiced... We have a flagrant example... in the partial report on Dr. Condon... I want to comment here on the use of the word ‚Äúpartial‚Äù... The committee counsel omitted a line of the [FBI] letter... 'There is no evidence to show that contacts between this individual and Dr. Condon were related to this individual's espionage activities'... This man, Dr. Condon, has been pilloried before the American people now for over 8 months. He has asked for a chance to tell his story; that chance has been denied\\" Albert Einstein (1947) defended Condon Defenders included Albert Einstein and Harold Urey. The entire physics department of Harvard and numerous professional organizations wrote Truman on Condon's behalf.Wang, \\"Security,\\" 249 The Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists held a dinner on April 12, 1948, to demonstrate support, with nine Nobel Prize winners among the sponsors.Wang, \\"Security,\\" 249-50 The National Academy of Sciences, by contrast, considered only a statement criticizing HUAC's procedures rather than defending Condon. Despite widespread support among its members (275 to 35), the National Academy of Sciences' leadership did not release a statement, and instead opted to speak privately with Rep. Thomas.Wang, \\"Security,\\" 251 On July 15, 1948, the Atomic Energy Commission granted Condon a security clearance, allowing him to access classified information at NIST.Wang, \\"Security,\\" 255 In September 1948, at the Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), President Truman, with Condon sitting nearby on the dais, denounced Rep. Thomas and HUAC on the grounds that vital scientific research \\"may be made impossible by the creation of an atmosphere in which no man feels safe against the public airing of unfounded rumors, gossip and vilification\\". He called HUAC's activities \\"the most un-American thing we have to contend with today. It is the climate of a totalitarian country\\". Condon opposed any cooperation with Congressional attempts to identify security risks within the scientific community. In June 1949, in a sharply critical letter to Oppenheimer, who had provided information to HUAC about a colleague, he wrote: \\"I have lost a good deal of sleep trying to figure out how you could have talked this way about a man whom you have known for so long, and of whom you know so well what a good physicist and good citizen he is.\\" In July 1949, he testified before a Senate subcommittee that was considering rules governing the operation of Senate committees. He criticized Thomas and the HUAC for holding closed hearings and then leaking information that denigrated his loyalty and that of other scientists. He said that the committee denied his and his colleagues' requests for public hearings so they could respond. In 1949, Edward R. Murrow had colleague Don Hollenbeck contribute to the innovative media-review program, CBS Views the Press over the radio network's flagship station WCBS. Hollenbeck discussed Edward U. Condon, Alger Hiss, and Paul Robeson. Regarding Condon, Hollenbeck critiqued anti-communists for going about their business the wrong way: > Communists want nothing more than to be lumped with freedom-loving non- > Communists... This simply makes it easier for them to conceal their true > nature, and to allege that the term 'Communist' is meaningless... At the > same time, we cannot let abuses deter us from the legitimate exposing of > real Communists. (Here, Hollenbeck was placing Condon in the \\"freedom-loving non-Communist\\" camp.) 1950s President Harry S. Truman (here, signing a proclamation declaring a national emergency and authorizing U.S. entry into the Korean War) nominated Condon as NBS director in 1945 With his record finally cleared in 1951, Condon left government to become head of research and development for the Corning Glass Works. He said his $14,000 annual government salary was his reason for the move. President Truman issued a statement of praise: \\"You have served in a most critical position with continued and loyal attention to your duties as director, and by reason of your standing among scientists and the supervision you have given to the bureau's activities, you have made of it a more important agency than it has ever been before\\". Two Republican Congressmen asserted that Condon was being investigated as a security risk and was leaving \\"under fire\\", a charge the Secretary of Commerce Charles Sawyer denied. On December 27, 1951, Condon was elected to head the AAAS in 1953.Wang, \\"Security,\\" 265 In September 1952, Condon, in testimony before a Congressional committee, had his first opportunity to deny under oath all charges of disloyalty that had been made against him. The HUAC concluded in its annual report for 1952 that Condon was unsuited for a security clearance because of his \\"propensity for associating with persons disloyal or of questionable loyalty and his contempt for necessary security regulations\\".Wang, \\"Security,\\" 264-5 On December 30, 1952, Condon assumed the presidency of the AAAS at its annual meeting, where, according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, \\"The tremendous ovation by his fellow members accompanying his induction was a further affirmation of their faith in his loyalty and integrity\\". Five months later Condon's clearance was revoked as was standard when someone left government service. He was granted a security clearance once more on July 12, 1954. It was announced on October 19 and then suspended by Secretary of the Navy Charles S. Thomas on October 21. Vice President Nixon took credit for the suspension, and the Atomic Scientists of Chicago charged \\"political abuse of the national security system\\", though Secretary Thomas denied Nixon had played a role. Condon withdrew his application for clearance and in December resigned from Corning because the company was seeking government research contracts and he lacked the clearance necessary for participating in military research. After citing the security reviews he had passed over the years, he said: \\"I am unwilling to continue a potentially indefinite series of reviews and re-reviews\\". Corning had paid Condon's clearance-related legal expenses while he worked there.Bird and Sherwin, 460 In 1958, Condon wrote that his decision reflected his belief that the Eisenhower administration \\"was committed by policy to the persecution of scientists, or, at the very least, to a callous indifference toward what others were doing to attack and discredit them. I decided the situation was hopeless, and that I had done all that could be reasonably expected of me in having resisted these forces for seven long years\\".Wang, \\"Security,\\" 266 Carl Sagan recounted a Loyalty Review Board encounter with Condon Years later, Carl Sagan reported how Condon described one encounter with a loyalty review board. A board member stated his concern: \\"Dr. Condon, it says here that you have been at the forefront of a revolutionary movement in physics called...quantum mechanics. It strikes this hearing that if you could be at the forefront of one revolutionary movement...you could be at the forefront of another\\". Condon said he replied: \\"I believe in Archimedes' Principle, formulated in the third century B.C. I believe in Kepler's laws of planetary motion, discovered in the seventeenth century. I believe in Newton's laws....\\" and continued with a catalog of scientists from earlier centuries, including the Bernoulli, Fourier, Amp√®re, Boltzmann, and Maxwell.Sagan, Demon-Haunted, 248-9 He once said privately: \\"I join every organization that seems to have noble goals. I don't ask whether it contains Communists\\".Wheeler, Geons, 113 =Academia= Condon was professor of physics at Washington University in St. Louis from 1956 to 1963 and then at the University of Colorado Boulder from 1963, where he was also a fellow of the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics, until retiring in 1970. From 1966 to 1968, Condon directed Boulder's UFO Project, known as the Condon Committee. He was chosen for his eminence and his lack of any stated position on UFOs. He later wrote that he agreed to head the project \\"on the basis of appeals to duty to do a needed public service\\" on the part of the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research.Dick, Biological, 293 Its final report concluded that unidentified flying objects had prosaic explanations. It has been cited as a key factor in the generally low levels of interest in UFOs among mainstream scientists and academics. Condon was also president of the American Institute of Physics and the American Association of Physics Teachers in 1964. He was president of the Society for Social Responsibility in Science (1968‚Äì69) and was co-chairman of the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy (1970). He co-edited the Handbook of Physics with Hugh Odishaw of the University of Arizona. He received the Frederic Ives Medal awarded by the Optical Society in 1968. On his retirement, his colleagues honored him with the publication of a Festschrift. Personal life and death Condon married Emilie Honzik (1899-1974). They had two sons and a daughter. The son, Joseph Henry Condon (15 February 1935 ‚Äî 2 January 2012) was a physicist (Ph.D., Northwestern University) and engineer, who worked at Bell Labs on digital telephone switches and co-invented the Belle chess computer. Condon was a self-described \\"liberal.\\" Condon died on March 26, 1974, twenty-four days after his 72nd birthday, in Boulder Colorado Community Hospital. paywalled Legacy Condon crater from Lunar Orbiter 1 (NASA/L&PI; image) The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) gives an annual award named for Condon.

Grant High School (commonly Grant High School) is a public high school in the Grant Park neighborhood of Portland, Oregon, United States.  History  Grant opened in September 1924, with 1,191 students. Many of the schools in the Portland Public School district that were built between 1908 and 1932 were designed by architects Floyd Naramore and George Jones. However, so many schools were being built simultaneously in Portland in the early 1920s, that the district had to hire another architectural firm to design Grant High School, which was in the Classical Revival style by architects Knighton and Howell. In November 1923, the bricklayers working on Grant went on strike after the district tried to cut costs by using a maintenance worker to lay bricks. After the Vanport flood in May 1948, Grant was home to the Vanport Extension Center (now Portland State University) through the summer of that year. Three motion pictures have been filmed at Grant High School: The made-for-TV movie Reunion (1980), Mr. Holland's Opus (1995), and Nearing Grace (2005). Funded by a $482 million bond measure approved in 2012, A two-year modernization and expansion project of Grant High School began in June 2017 and was completed in the summer of 2019. The interior of the building was gutted and has been completely rebuilt. The project includes a new three-story common area, a new gymnasium, seismic retrofitting, and additional classroom space. Exterior of U.S. Grant High School in Portland, Oregon (2019) Student profile In the 2016‚Äì2017 school year, Grant's student population was 67.8% white, 8.2% African American, 6.8% Hispanic, 4.7% Asian, 0.6% Native American, 0.2% Pacific Islander, and 11.7% mixed race. About 25% of Grant's students live out of boundaries and transfer in. In 2008, 92% of the school's seniors received a high school diploma. Of 443 students, 388 graduated, 39 dropped out, six received a modified diploma, and ten were still in high school in 2009. In 2009, 27% of the students were transfers into the school.

While on the show, he made some offensive comments against Jews and Anglophones, including that bombs or Molotov cocktails could be used against Anglophone activist Howard Galganov. The following Sunday, Villeneuve published a newsletter, La Temp√™te (The Storm, in which he denounced Montreal's English speaking Jews for their longstanding opposition to the Quebec separatist movement and Bill 101 and sent this warning: \\"What will happen on the day after the victory to those communities who refused to prove conciliating towards the people of Quebec?

Although he was educated as an engineer at Cornell University, he passed the Massachusetts state bar examination and became a lawyer in 1881. Parsons was a lecturer at Boston University School of Law for more than a decade and taught at Kansas State Agricultural College from 1897 to 1899. As a leading social commentator of the Progressive Era, Parsons authored a dozen books and more than 125 magazine and journal articles on a wide range of reform topics, including currency reform, regulation of monopolies, municipal ownership, establishment of direct democracy, and other matters. Parsons is also widely regarded as the father of the vocational guidance movement. Biography =Early years= Frank Parsons was born on November 14, 1854, in Mount Holly, New Jersey, the son of an Anglo-Saxon family with American antecedents dating back to the time of the American Revolution.Arthur Mann, \\"Frank Parsons: The Professor as Crusader,\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review, vol. 37, no. 3 (Dec. 1950), pg. 472. The family was highly intellectual in proclivity, with a number of physicians, lawyers, and teachers dotting the family tree, particularly on Frank's mother's side. Intellectually talented from an early age, Frank was enrolled in Cornell University at the age of 15 and graduated after just three years with a Bachelor's degree in civil engineering. =Career= Parsons took a job as a civil engineer for a railroad located in Western Massachusetts upon graduation but he lost this position when the firm collapsed amidst the Panic of 1873. After relatively brief stints as a common laborer and a public school teacher, Parsons decided to go into the legal profession, preparing for the Massachusetts bar examination for one year before taking and passing the exam in 1881. Unfortunately, Parsons experienced a health failure shortly after passing the bar exam and found himself compelled to move the New Mexico Territory in search of recovery. Parsons would remain in that state for three years. Parsons established a legal practice in New Mexico but soon tired of the profession.Mann, \\"Frank Parsons: The Professor as Crusader,\\" pg. 473. Instead, Parsons was employed by the publishing firm of Little, Brown and Company as a writer of law textbooks. Several volumes were produced during the course of this association. With textbook publications came academic recognition, and in 1892 Parsons was added to the staff as a lecturer at Boston University School of Law. He would remain in that position for the greater part of the rest of his life, leaving only in 1905 on account of competing research interests. Parson's position at Boston University only occupied part of the academic year, leaving him free to work on other projects and in other capacities for much of the year.Mann, \\"Frank Parsons: The Professor as Crusader,\\" pg. 475. He joined the staff of Kansas State Agricultural College in 1897, in the wake of a recent Populist electoral victory in that state and the advent of a new liberal administration at that school. =Social reformer= Parsons became interested in the ideas of economic rationalization during the Progressive Era of the 1890s. It was a time of great disparity between wealthy plutocrats, often exercising monopoly power over the economy through organized associations called trusts, and a frequently impoverished working class, racked by periodic depressions such as the 1873 event which had cost Parsons his first job. With his characteristic energy, Parsons threw himself into the systematic study of many of the topics espoused by muckraking journalists and intellectuals of the day.Mann, \\"Frank Parsons: The Professor as Crusader,\\" pg. 474. A series of books followed, including tomes on monetary reform (Rational Money, 1898), market dysfunction in the communications industry (The Telegraph Monopoly, 1899), public ownership of monopoly industries (The City for the People, 1899), substitution of democracy for oligarchy (Direct Legislation, 1900), and the abuses of the railroad industry (The Trusts, the Railroads, and the People, 1906). In December 1895, Parsons ran for Mayor of Boston, as the candidate for the Municipal Reform Party‚Äî\\"a fusion of prohibitionists, labor, populists, and socialists\\". He finished third in a field of three, with 0.8% of the vote. In addition to his steady stream of books and pamphlets, Parsons wrote extensively for the periodical press, contributing more than 125 articles to B.O. Flower's progressive monthly, The Arena and other publications. In addition to his prolific work for The Arena, Parsons was named a contributing editor to the social democratic monthly The American Fabian in 1896. In addition to his writing activities, Parsons also emerged as a prominent public speaker, serving as a lecturer for the National Direct Legislation League, as head of the lecture department of the Social Reform Union, and as President of the National League for Promoting Public Ownership of Monopoly.Thomas William Herringshaw (ed.), Herringshaw's National Library of American Biography. In Five Volumes. Chicago: American Publishers' Association, 1914; vol. 4, pg. 386. In the course of his activity, Parsons came to be recognized as a national expert on public ownership of utilities. In 1906, he was commissioned by the National Civic Federation to travel to Great Britain to study the incidence of municipal ownership and its outcomes in that country. Parsons also served as dean of the extension division of Ruskin College in Trenton, Missouri. =Death and legacy= Frank Parsons died September 26, 1908, in Boston, Massachusetts. He was 53 years old at the time of his death. A memorial service in Parsons' honor was held October 25, 1908, at the People's Church in Washington, D.C..B.O. Flower, \\"Memorial Services in Memory of Professor Parsons in the Nation's Capital,\\" The Arena, vol. 40, whole no. 228 (Dec. 1908), pp. 636-638. In the eulogy by Rev. Alexander Kent, Parson's was remembered as a consistent analyst striving to advance the general weal: > There were few men whose ability was so completely devoted to the public > good.... The problem of human betterment was always uppermost in his > thought. He was continually at work tracing the evils from which men suffer > to their source, and showing how they might be avoided or at least greatly > lessened. He was a consistent opponent of that individualism which pits men > against each other in the struggle for existence, and an earnest advocate of > that individuality that fits men for useful membership in the social body, > and so draws them together in mutual fellowship and service.Alexander Kent, > quoted in B.O. Flower, \\"Memorial Services in Memory of Professor Parsons in > the Nation's Capital,\\" pg. 636. Parsons' papers are housed at Yale University Library in New Haven, Connecticut.Mann, \\"Frank Parsons: The Professor as Crusader,\\" pg. 472, fn. 6. The posthumous publication in 1911 of Parson's manuscript, Choosing a Vocation, and its so-called \\"talent-matching approach\\" proved to be massively influential with a generation of educationalists. Parson's book remains regarded as a classic in the field and Parsons is still in the 21st Century remembered as \\"the founder of the vocational guidance movement.\\"See, for example: \\"Career Theory Models: Parson's Theory,\\" CareersNZ, http://www.careers.govt.nz/ Works * The World's Best Books.

It was a subsidiary of the London-listed company Vodafone Plc. On 31 July 2019 the sale of Vodafone New Zealand Limited to a consortium comprising Infratil Limited and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. was settled.https://www.bellgully.com/about-us/firm-news/vodafone-group-plc- settles-vodafone-new-zealand-sale-to-consortium Vodafone is New Zealand's largest mobile phone operator, based in Auckland, and was formed in 1998, after Vodafone purchased BellSouth's New Zealand operations. The company employs over 3,000 people and has operations nationwide, with its main offices based in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. The company is part of New Zealand Telecommunications Forum. The company has invested millions of dollars in its 3G network, improving capacity in congested urban areas. It has New Zealand's first 4G LTE network and continues to maintain its 2G network. In February 2013, Vodafone New Zealand launched their LTE network which is currently available in 54 centres in total. In June 2014, Vodafone was ranked the fastest mobile network on the planet by speed-testing service Ookla. In October 2006, Vodafone bought ihug, New Zealand's third largest Internet service provider and now provides Internet service under the Vodafone New Zealand brand name. In 2012 Vodafone also bought TelstraClear, making it NZ's second largest ISP. In June 2016, Sky TV and Vodafone agreed to merge, with Sky TV purchasing 100% of Vodafone NZ operations for a cash payment of $1.25 billion NZD and issuing new shares to the Vodafone Group. Vodafone UK was to get 51% stake of the company. However, the proposed merger was rejected by the Commerce Commission which saw a plunge in Sky TV's shares.  Market share Vodafone has over 2.3 million customers nationwide. According to the Commerce Commission's Annual Telecommunications Monitoring Report from December 2018, Vodafone's market share in the mobile market was 41%, Spark with 32% and Two Degrees Mobile with 21%. The remainder of the market is made up of MVNO operators, Skinny with 5% and the rest with 1%. =Acquisitions= BellSouth had 138,000 customers when it was purchased by Vodafone in November 1998. The company's main rival was Telecom New Zealand (now Spark), New Zealand's second largest telecommunications company behind Vodafone. Telecom had the advantage that it had a 6-year head-start on BellSouth, however this advantage slipped away in recent years. After Vodafone took over Bellsouth, it expanded network coverage to compete more effectively with Telecom. Vodafone has constantly increased its market share and surpassed Telecom in mobile customers. On 31 October 2012, Vodafone acquired 100% of TelstraClear from Australian company Telstra. Mobile services = Coverage = Vodafone operates a GSM (2G) mobile phone network at 900 MHz and 1800 MHz, a UMTS (3G) network at 900 MHz and 2100 MHz, and a 4G LTE network at 700 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz and 2600 MHz. It states that the network provides service in \\"Our mobile network covers over 98.5% of the population, with 4G extended coverage to over 93%\\".  GSM Coverage (2G)  Vodafone operates a nationwide GSM service in the 900 MHz band. In areas with high demand there are additional GSM services operating in the 1800 MHz band, usually from existing 900 MHz cell sites, to provide more capacity. Areas with both 900 MHz and 1800 MHz service cover most major business districts and large shopping malls. In recent years Vodafone has also established some cell sites that only provide 1800 MHz service where it is difficult to release spectrum for more 900 MHz cell sites. Most phones sold since the mid-1990s support both bands. In March 2016 Vodafone New Zealand announced plans to shut down its 2G (GSM) network, beginning with voice and messaging services. Vodafone's Spokesperson Elissa Downey commented that they would keep the GSM network running until 2025, although it would only support devices using GSM data such as electricity meters that send readings over the network, and that they would be announcing the end date for its 2G voice service soon. In early August 2016, however, it was reported that Vodafone was reconsidering its choice to shut down the network, with Spokesperson Andrea Brady stating that the 2G network \\"will not be switched off anytime soon as it continues to serve customers across New Zealand\\". This announcement came following the company's criticism of rival operator Spark's billboard campaign that claimed \\"Vodafone's 2G network is shutting down\\" and invited customers to \\"switch before [they're] ditched\\", despite neither Spark, nor its child division Skinny Mobile ‚Äì whom the campaign was run under ‚Äì operating a compatible 2G network. The campaign was denounced by Vodafone as \\"pretty misleading\\", shortly followed by the announcement that 2G voice services would not be ended any time soon. As of December 2016 Vodafone has not confirmed a date for the termination of its 2G voice network.  UMTS Coverage (3G)  In the main centres, Vodafone operates UMTS (3G) service using the 2100 MHz band. UMTS service is often provided from the same cell site as 900 MHz and/or 1800 MHz GSM services. Most of the existing 900 MHz sites were built in the 1990s when it was not expected that a 2100 MHz network would be built, hence the existing 900 MHz network was not at all optimised for 2100 MHz service. Due to the fact that 900 MHz and 1800 MHz signals propagate further than 2100 MHz signals, there were many areas beyond 2100 MHz coverage where UMTS phones would have to hand down to 900 MHz or 1800 MHz GSM service. In recent years Vodafone has established many individual 2100 MHz UMTS sites to enhance 3G coverage. In rural areas, Vodafone has installed 900 MHz UMTS (3G) service alongside their existing 900 MHz GSM (2G) service. The 900 MHz UMTS service has roughly the same coverage area as 900 MHz GSM service, so instances of UMTS service being handed down to GSM should occur far less often in rural areas than in areas covered by the 2100 MHz network. However many older UMTS phones only support 2100 MHz service so these phones will hand down to 900 MHz GSM even though there is UMTS service available at 900 MHz. Rural Broadband Initiative (RBI) coverage: Vodafone have a contract with the New Zealand government to provide fixed cellular access to the internet with antennas mounted on the outside of buildings, homes and businesses at speeds of at least 5Mbit/s. Much of the coverage as of 2015 is on 900Mhz 3G (hands down to 2G as a backup). By January 2016, Vodafone has actively extended its 4G network throughout key rural areas, and was on track to deliver speeds as high as 100Mbit/s. RBI is sold by many ISPs and can include voice services and internet services designed to give similar plans and pricing as landline. Vodafone wholesales RBI services over cellular to many ISPs, any ISP may provide RBI services over cellular, ADSL and UFB fibre, what ever is the available at the customers rural property (urban areas are excluded from RBI offerings).  4G LTE Coverage (4G)  Vodafone offers 4G LTE coverage across New Zealand, claiming coverage to over 96% of the population. Vodafone uses frequencies at 700 MHz (Band 28), 1800 MHz (Band 3), and 2600 MHz (Band 7) for 4G. 4G was originally considered an \\"add-on\\" and was included in three higher level plans and the Vodafone Red plans. The 700 MHz 4G LTE frequency used in New Zealand is APT band 28 and was first launched by Vodafone in Papakura on 21 July 2014.  5G NR Coverage (5G)  Vodafone launched its 5G service in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Queenstown on 10 December 2019, with plans to roll out the service to other cities in 2020. = Mobile virtual network service = Vodafone NZ also provides services for mobile virtual network operators. This means other companies can resell Vodafone's network services (data, telephone and SMS) under their own brand name. Their customers connect to Vodafone's network as any other Vodafone customer would, but instead of seeing \\"Vodafone NZ\\" as the network operator, they will see the name of the company they pay for these services. MVNO networks do not have their own cellular equipment, so customers connect to Vodafone's network constantly, instead of jumping between networks. Current MVNOs running on Vodafone's network include: Kogan Mobile and formerly Black + White Mobile. This is different from 2degrees, who offloads customers onto the Vodafone network when they are not in a 2degrees mobile coverage zone. 2degrees has a roaming agreement with Vodafone NZ, and as such, their customers roam only on the network when they have no coverage, otherwise they connect to 2degrees' own equipment. = Phone numbers = In New Zealand all mobile phone numbers start with 02. Vodafone is allocated the 021 prefix with other networks being allocated other prefixes ‚Äì such as 022 to 2degrees, and 027 to Spark. However Number portability was introduced to the New Zealand market on 2 April 2007 which means that customers can bring, for example, their 021 prefixed number to Spark or 2degrees. Within New Zealand, the network is sometimes referred to in speech by its prefix‚Äîi.e. 'Are you 021?' instead of 'Are you with Vodafone?'.  029 Prefix  Vodafone used to operate the 029 prefix on behalf of TelstraClear, in addition to its own 021 prefix. TelstraClear customers, mostly corporates, used to be able to get mobile numbers under this prefix; these customers were billed by TelstraClear instead of being billed directly by Vodafone. In 2007 this agreement lapsed, and in 2008 some of these customers were transitioned to Telecom who serviced them initially with CDMA2000 technology. Those TelstraClear 029 customers not transitioned to Telecom New Zealand remained with Vodafone. Subsequently, TelstraClear joined Telecom as a MVNO operator, but that relationship soured and TelstraClear re- signed with Vodafone in 2009 and remains on the Vodafone network.  Comparison with 027 Prefix  Spark NZ (formerly Telecom New Zealand), Vodafone's rival, has fixed 10-digit numbers under its 0272-0279 prefix, which allows approximately 7 million possible numbers. Telecom originally had mixed 9-digits and 10-digits number using the older 025 prefix. The 027 prefix with only 10-digit numbers simplified its numbering system at the time of launching its CDMA network. The older 025 prefix was phased out with its now redundant AMPS and TDMA networks. = 3G services = On Wednesday 10 August 2005 Vodafone introduced a new 3G network employing the UMTS technology widely used in Europe and elsewhere. Using this standard, Vodafone now offers Video Calling, music downloads, SKY mobile TV and other services from its Vodafone live! portal. Vodafone began rolling out HSPA+ data services on its UMTS network in 2011; at the time of writing (May 2012), Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch have coverage. HSPA+ is capable of a theoretical maximum 168 Mbit/s download speed and 22 Mbit/s upload speed, although higher speeds are only supported in areas with an excellent radio signal. Vodafone launched HD Voice on 7 November 2013 - a high definition voice call technology. This technology works over 3G with HD Voice compatible phones on Vodafone to Vodafone voice calls. = iPhone = The first model of the iPhone (on the Vodafone network) The first iPhone 3G released on 11 July 2008 was sold by Vodafone in Auckland, New Zealand to 22-year-old student Jonny Gladwell at 12:01 am NZST. The iPhone 3G was only available to customers on the Vodafone network.{ 3G coverage for iPhone 3G was limited to major urban centres, as the phone operated on 850, 1900 and 2100 MHz bands; Vodafone's 3G network uses 900 and 2100 MHz. (The 850 MHz 3G band is used by Spark NZ). 900 MHz capability was added from the iPhone 3GS and subsequent models of iPhone. Subsequent launches of iPhone models in New Zealand have typically been a few weeks after the worldwide release. The iPhone 5, iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c are CAT3 4G devices and can be used on Vodafone's 4G LTE network on the 1800 MHz frequency. iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models are CAT4 4G devices and also support the APT 700 MHz frequency (Band 28) in addition to Vodafone's 1800 MHz frequency. Fixed- line broadband = ADSL and VDSL2 = Vodafone offers copper-based ADSL and VDSL services. (Vodafone has previously purchased two other ISPs, Paradise.net and Clearnet.) VDSL is a faster xDSL technology available to consumers and businesses based on location. This technology will only function within a certain proximity to the local copper exchange. This technology is used to deliver the BizBroadband and BizNet packages, as well as the IP Voice products (IP FeatureLine, IP Connect, IP Gateway, IP Clarity). = DOCSIS (cable) = Vodafone also offers DOCSIS cable modem broadband within the former TelstraClear's network.TelstraClear to deploy DOCSIS 3.0. Telegeography.com (3 August 2009). Retrieved on 23 July 2012. Vodafone announced plans to upgrade its cable network to DOCSIS 3.1, in order to support gigabit speeds. This upgrade is scheduled for June, 2016.Vodafone to support gigabit over cable. Teleography.com (10 November 2015). Retrieved on 12 November 2015. Vodafone currently offers many different speeds on the cable network. The standard plan provides up to 50 Mbit/s download and 2 Mbit/s upload, with a faster plan offering 900 Mbit/s download with 100 Mbit/s upload also available. Coverage Vodafone's cable network is available in the following areas: * most of Wellington City, excluding Tawa, Churton Park, Glenside, Broadmeadows, Ngauranga, Kaiwharawhara, and central Wellington (bound by State Highway 1 and Kent Terrace) * Lower Hutt, including Wainuiomata and Stokes Valley, but excluding Haywards, Manor Park, the western hill suburbs (west of State Highway 2) and eastern bay suburbs (Point Howard to Muritai, including Eastbourne) * Upper Hutt, excluding T≈çtara Park * Kapiti urban area (Waikanae to Paekakariki) * southern and eastern Christchurch, including the suburbs of Mairehau, Shirley, Richmond, Avonside, Dallington, Wainoni, Avondale, Aranui, Bexley, parts of New Brighton and North New Brighton, Bromley, Linwood, Ferrymead, Woolston, Opawa, Waltham, Sydenham, Saint Martins, Beckenham, Somerfield, Addington, Spreydon, Hoon Hay, Hillmorton, Middleton, parts of Riccarton and Upper Riccarton (south of and including Riccarton Road), Sockburn, Broomfield, Hei Hei, and parts of Islington and Hornby. = UFB = Vodafone offers a range of Ultra-Fast Broadband (fibre) products.  Television  Vodafone operates a hybrid internet television (IPTV) pay television network formerly owned by TelstraClear under the brand \\"Vodafone TV\\". It is delivered over cable and fibre broadband, available in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, Whangarei, Palmerston North and Dunedin. Customers receive Freeview channels via a Digital TV recorder and can subscribe to Sky TV channels. No content is sourced by Vodafone itself except 36 Vodafone pay-per-view channels. Selected content is available in High Definition. In September 2010 TelstraClear released their own PVR called the T-BOX. The launch followed the release by parent company Telstra (AU) of a similar product. As of June 2011, TelstraClear ceased all analogue transmission on its cable network. Vodafone TV allows customers to add Sky channel packages to their accounts and also access various OTT media streaming apps. =Interactive services= * Electronic Programme Guide (EPG) - Television listing information. * 3-day cloud buffer * Cloud storage * On- demand = Defunct channels = * TechTV was available up until May 2004, when current owner Comcast halted international broadcasts.

Vodafone NZ issued an apology for this incident  TelstraClear purchase  TelstraClear had its beginnings in New Zealand with SKY Cable in the Kapiti Coast district, It then became Kiwi Cable, Clear Communications in 1990, and Telstra New Zealand in 1996. Telstra NZ slowly expanded its operations in the business market bundling Telecom New Zealand services distributed as a reseller with its own network services. It installed switches in Auckland and Wellington to manage incoming and outgoing international traffic and maintained interconnect agreements with Telecom New Zealand, Clear Communications and some smaller service providers. In 1999 Saturn Communications was sold by its parent company, Austar United Communications, to a new joint venture with Telstra that became known as TelstraSaturn. TelstraClear was then created by the merger of Telstra's TelstraSaturn and Clear Communications in December 2001. Austar United Communications held an initial investment of 42% in TelstraClear before selling it back to Telstra. In 2004 TelstraClear made its first acquisition in the IT market with the purchase of Sytec, mainly for its IP telephony and security skills, in particular the specialist managed security subsidiary DMZGlobal. In 2007 Sytec was formally introduced into the TelstraClear's Enterprise and government division and the brand retired, but the DMZGlobal brand was retained and invested in. In July 2012 Vodafone NZ approached Telstra to purchase TelstraClear for a payment of $840 million and $450 million that TelstraClear had in its accounts. On 30 October the Commerce Commission approved the takeover bid, and on 31 October the sale was completed. The 31 March 2013 was the final trading day of TelstraClear.

History The corps was formed in April, 1943 as a headquarters for the SS Division Wiking and SS Division Nordland. The corps was placed under the control of former Wiking commander SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Felix Steiner. After training, the corps took part in operations against Yugoslav partisans. The corps was then sent to a quiet sector in Army Group North, now made up of the Nordland Division and the 4th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Brigade Netherlands. By this stage, Wiking had been sent south and came under the control of Army Group South's Eighth Army. Forced back by the 1944 Soviet winter offensive, the corps participated in the Battle for the Narva Bridgehead in the summer of 1944. It then retreated with the rest of the army group across Estonia and into the Courland Peninsula. Transferred to the Oder Front and placed under Steiner's 11th SS Panzer Army, the corps participated in Operation Solstice before being assigned as the reserve corps to 3rd Panzer Army.

According to Jewish oral traditions, he was known to the revered Talmudic sage, the Vilna Gaon (Rabbi Elijah Ben Shlomo Zalman [1720‚Äì1797]), and his ashes were interred in the relocated grave of the Vilna Gaon in Vilna's new Jewish cemetery.Singer, Evelyne. \\"The Lost Jewish World: A visit to contemporary Lithuania\\". Hamodia Magazine, 22 November 2012, pp. 10-14. Although the Orthodox Jewish community accepts the teachings about Abraham ben Abraham, including the involvement of the Vilna Gaon, current Artscroll publications include \\"secular scholars have largely concluded that it is a legend.\\" Jewish traditions The Vilna Gaon (1720-1797) was, according to the Jewish tradition, a mentor to Abraham ben Abraham. There are several versions of this story, especially among the Jews of Lithuania, Poland, and Russia, who know and still refer to Potocki as the Ger Tzedek (\\"righteous proselyte\\") of Vilna (Vilnius). Virtually all Jewish sources agree that he was a Polish nobleman who converted to Judaism and was burned at the stake by the Roman Catholic Church at Vilnius on May 23, 1749 (7 Sivan 5509, corresponding to the second day of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot in the Diaspora), because he had renounced Catholicism and had become an observant Jew. Multiple oral histories, backed up by several 19th-century and later printed versions of the story, from many Jewish communities over the past 250 years, serve as evidence of Potocki's story. Jewish oral traditions teach many more details of Avraham ben Avraham's life and death. There is also one contemporary written account from 1755, by Rabbi Yaakov Emden. ◊ï◊ô◊ß◊ù ◊¢◊ì◊ï◊™ ◊ë◊ô◊¢◊ß◊ë ◊ì◊£ ◊õ◊î, ◊ë (Vayakam Edus b'Yaakov, 1755, p. 25b). A rough translation: > A few years ago, it happened in Vilna the capital of Lithuania that a great > prince from the family of Pototska converted. They captured him and > imprisoned him for many days thinking they could return him to their > religion. He knew that he would not escape harsh tortures and a cruel death > if he would not return. They wanted to save him from the death and > punishment that would await him if he held out. He paid no attention to them > or to the begging of his mother the countess. He was not afraid or worried > about dying in all the bitter anguish they had done to him. After waiting > for him for a long time, they tried to take it easy on him for the honor of > his family.

He scorned them and > laughed at them, and chose death of long and cruel agony, to the temporary > life of this world. He accepted and suffered all from love, and died > sanctifying God's name. May he rest in peace. As to why there are few full sources, the Jewish view is reflected in this excerpt from the Shema Yisrael Torah Network website: > There are a few reasons why there are so few contemporary sources about the > ger tzedek story. It can be assumed that the noble Pototzki family, which > was a religious Polish-Catholic family, was not happy that one of their sons > defected to Judaism. The Pototzki family was said to have generally dealt > kindly with the Jews living on its lands. Mentioning the conversion would > have been interpreted as an open provocation of the area's ruler, which > would have not resulted in any good. In addition, undoubtedly the conversion > of one of the upper-class gentiles aroused great interest among the > populace, and his refusal to return to their faith caused them great > embarrassment ... Nevertheless, we believe the words of our rabbis, which > clearly indicate that there was a connection between the Gra (i.e. the Vilna > Gaon) and the Ger Tzedek. In his lecture on the topic, Prof. Sid Leiman quotes an author from a century ago who related the same reason - heard from a member of the Pototzki family. The traditional story Polish author J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski, based on the story written in Hebrew from 1766 by Judah Hurwitz, Ammudei Beit Yehuda in Amsterdam relates that young Potocki and his friend Zaremba, who traveled from Poland to study in a seminary in Paris, became interested in an old Jew whom they found poring over a large volume when they entered his wine shop. This Jew might have been their own countryman, Menahem Man ben Aryeh L√∂b of Visun, who was tortured and executed in Vilna at the age of seventy (July 3, 1749). Tradition has brought this Jewish martyr into close connection with the Ger Tzedek, but fear of the censor has prevented writers in Russia from saying anything explicit on the subject. His teachings and explanations of the Old Testament, to which they, as Roman Catholics, were total strangers, so impressed them that they prevailed upon him to instruct them in the Hebrew language. In six months they acquired proficiency in the Biblical language and a strong inclination toward Judaism. They resolved to go to Amsterdam, which was one of the few places in Europe at that time where a Christian could openly embrace Judaism. But Potocki first went to Rome, whence, after convincing himself that he could no longer remain a Catholic, he went to Amsterdam and took upon himself the covenant of Abraham, assuming the name of Avraham ben Avraham (\\"Abraham the son of Abraham\\"; \\"the son of Abraham\\" is the traditional styling of a convert to Judaism, as Abraham was the first who converted to Judaism from polytheism). Potocki's parents got word of his leave from the seminary in Paris and the rumors that he had converted to Judaism and began searching for him. Potocki then fled from France and hid in a synagogue in Vilna, wearing a long beard and peyot like the Perushim (devout Jews who separated themselves from the community to learn and pray). When the Vilna Gaon heard of his whereabouts, he advised him to hide instead in the small town of Ilye (Vilna Governorate). There a Jewish tailor who sewed uniforms for Polish bureaucrats overheard some clients talking about the fugitive divinity student and suspected that the stranger in the synagogue might be he. Later this tailor's son, who liked to disturb the men studying in the synagogue, was sharply rebuked by Potocki; some say Potocki grabbed the boy by the ear and pulled him out the door. The tailor reported him to the Bishop of Vilna, and Potocki was arrested. Potocki's parents visited him in prison and begged him to renounce his Judaism publicly, promising to build him a castle where he could practice the religion privately. According to Rabbi Ben-Zion Alfes, the Maggid of Vilna, Potocki refused his mother, saying, \\"I love you dearly, but I love the truth even more\\". After a long imprisonment and a trial for heresy, Potocki was condemned to death by being burned alive at the stake. After the decree was handed down, the Vilna Gaon sent Potocki a message offering to rescue him using Kabbalah. Potocki refused, preferring instead to die al kiddush Hashem and inquired of the Vilna Gaon which blessing he should make immediately before his death. The Vilna Gaon answered, \\"...m'kadesh es Shimcha be'rabbim\\" (Who sanctifies His Name in public) and sent Alexander S√ºsskind of Grodno as an emissary to hear and answer \\"Amen\\". His mother used all her influence to procure a pardon for him, but the execution was moved up one day so that she would not be able to deliver it in time. Potocki was executed in Vilna on the second day of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. It was unsafe for any Jew to witness the burning; nevertheless, one Jew, Leiser Zhiskes, who had no beard, went among the crowd and succeeded by bribery in securing some of the ashes of the martyr, which were later buried in the Jewish cemetery. Potocki walked proudly to the execution site, singing a song that was later sung in the Volozhin yeshiva and that was also sung by Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer after Yom Kippur. Some sources say that Rabbi Alexander Ziskind, author of Yesod VeShoresh HaAvodah, stood near Potocki and said \\"Amen\\" to the blessing he said before he died. Following Potocki's execution, the town that had furnished the firewood for the execution burned down. There was also an unusual number of fires in Vilna, and a building that stood opposite the execution site bore a black stain from the \\"smoke and fumes of the burning\\". No amount of paint or whitewashing would remove the stain, and finally, the building was taken down. The authorities would not allow a monument to be erected over Potocki's ashes, but a \\"strange tree\\" grew at the site. Those who tried to cut down the tree were mysteriously injured in the process. Around 1919 a tomb was erected over the ashes and Jews came to pray there. Following the destruction of the old cemetery of Vilna by the Nazis during World War II, a new cemetery was built and the Vilna Gaon was interred in a new ohel. Potocki's ashes were reinterred alongside the Vilna Gaon's grave, and an inscribed stone memorial to him was mounted on the wall of the ohel. Potocki's comrade Zaremba returned to Poland several years before him, married the daughter of a great nobleman, and had a son. He remained true to the promise to embrace Judaism and took his wife and child to Amsterdam, where, after he and his son had been circumcised, his wife also converted to Judaism; they then went to the Land of Israel. According to Jewish tradition, following Avraham ben Avraham's death, the Vilna Gaon believed that the spiritual constitution of the world had become altered in such a way that a Jew was no longer bound to wash his hands in the morning (netilat yadayim) within four amot (cubits) of his bed, as explicitly taught in the codes of Jewish law such as the Shulchan Aruch and other halachic works. Rather, a Jew's entire house would be considered as four amot for this mitzvah. This custom, begun at Avraham ben Avraham's death, commenced with the Vilna Gaon and later became the practice of the Slabodka yeshiva in Europe, becoming today the routine of many leading Israeli rabbis who follow the Slabodka tradition. This story was related by Rabbi Ostroff, posek and student of Rav Sternbuch of Jerusalem, as well as Rabbi Hadar Margolin and the ArtScroll biography of the Vilna Gaon.  Lack of historical evidence  Many secondary sources - encyclopaedias of Jewish culture, history and religion - include an entry on Potocki, a Polish magnate and member of the powerful Potocki family, who converted to Orthodox Judaism in 18th-century Netherlands and who, after his return to Vilna, was tried by an Inquisition court which sentenced him to burning at the stake.Janusz Tazbir, The Mystery of Walentyn Potocki, Kwartalnik Historyczny, 3/2003, online abstracts from that issue Historians (ex. Janusz Tazbir, Jacek Moskwa, Rimantas Miknys and Magda Teter) who have studied the story of Potocki, however, believe it to be invented, Jacek Moskwa, Legenda Sprawiedliwie Nawr√≥conego: Historia zatajona czy zmyslona?, Zwoje March 31, 2002, online original in Polish although it is unknown when or by whom (Moskwa points to a possibility that the author was Kraszewski himself, who is known to have invented some tales he claimed were true). Teter mentioned that the story (\\"a carefully crafted tale of conversion\\") was likely created and developed as a \\"response to a number of challenges that the Polish Jewish community faced from the mid-eighteenth century\\". =Tazbir (2003)= Polish historian Janusz Tazbir asserted that the story - he uses the term \\"legend\\" - originated at the turn of the 19th century and was published in a Jewish periodical issued in London as \\"The Jewish Expositor and Friend of Israel\\" (vol. 8, 1822). He notes that the literary version of the legend was created by J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski, a well-known Polish writer of the 19th century, author of numerous historical novels, who included the story about Potocki in the third volume of the history of Vilna (1841), Wilno od poczƒÖtk√≥w jego do roku 1750 (1840‚Äì1842), in which he claims to have followed a Hebrew original, thought by some to be from Ammudei Beit Yehudah (Judah Hurwitz, Amsterdam 1766). (However, Ammudei Beit Yehudah contains no reference to this story other than a brief mention of the execution of the elderly Rabbi Mann in Wilno). The story was then popularised through Russian translations, and there is evidence that a cult of Potocki's grave in Vilna has existed until the Jewish cemetery (at Pi√≥romont also known as Snipiszki quarter) was destroyed by Nazis during World War II and later by the Soviets. Some sources claim his remains were rescued along with those of Vilna Gaon, though it is said that there is no modern monument or grave clearly identified as Potocki's in Vilna or elsewhere. However, historian Sid Leiman has identified what he thinks is a likely Potocki's grave by examination of the gravestones near the Vilna Gaon's. Tazbir stated that the tragic fate of Potocki, passed through Jewish oral tradition, remains unconfirmed by 18th-century Polish or Jewish primary sources and that there is no evidence in any archives or genealogy tree that Potocki existed. Tazbir further notes that the Polish nobility was guaranteed the freedom of faith (by acts like Neminem captivabimus and the Warsaw Confederation), and capital punishment was extremely rare. (though see also Iwan Tyszkiewicz). He observes that the incident, if real, should have caused an uproar among the Polish nobility (like an earlier and well-documented case of the execution of Samuel Zborowski), and would be the only historical example of execution by burning of a nobleman - yet no contemporary source from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth mentions this event even in a passing reference. In addition, it is difficult to believe that the death at the stake of a Polish aristocrat, from one of the most powerful Polish magnate families, charged with a religious crime, was not echoed in any of the diaries or polemical writings concerning religion and tolerance, topics in which the Polish nobility, and the entire European Enlightenment, were particularly interested. Tazbir has concluded that \\"the court trial and death of Walentyn Potocki should be recognised as a historical legend deprived of all source‚Äìmaterial foundations\\". =Similar story of Abraham Isacowicz= Some have suggested that the Potocki legend is an embellishment of a different story. A report published in the July 1753 edition of The London Magazine describes the story of a very similar execution. The correspondent dated his report June 11, two days after the end of the Shavuot holiday. It describes \\"an apostate named Raphael Sentimany, a native of Croatia\\", who converted to Judaism at the age of 12 and adopted the name Abraham Isacowicz. The report describes his imprisonment and execution in Wilno as the Potocki legend describes. The report also states that he was executed on June 9, which was the second day of Shavuot, just as in the Potocki story. The only important differences between the Sentimany execution and the Potocki legend are that the martyr's Jewish surname was Isacowicz, called Rafael Sentimany rather than Valenty Potocki, was killed in 1753 rather than 1749, and that he was a Croatian immigrant rather than a Polish noble. Raphael Sentimany is also mentioned in the anonymous British work \\"Admonitions from the Dead, in Epistles to the Living\\", published in 1754, in a manner suggestive of the wide exposure of the original report of Abraham ben Abraham's execution.

It is home to approximately 400 upperclass undergraduates. Winthrop house consists of two buildings, Standish Hall and Gore Hall, originally freshman dormitories built in 1912. In 1931 they were joined as John Winthrop House, one of the seven original Harvard houses in which students reside from sophomore through senior years. Historically, Winthrop was also one of the first Harvard houses open to Catholic and Jewish students. Winthrop House maintains an affiliation with Davenport College at Yale University. The house's name honors two notable men who shared the name \\"John Winthrop\\"‚Äîthe first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, as well as his descendant, an 18th-century astronomer who was both a Harvard professor and president of the university. The house shield is from the Winthrop family coat of arms: a lion with three chevrons in the background. In heraldric language, the blazon of the house shield is \\"Argent three chevrons Gules overall a lion rampant Sable.\\" The current interim faculty deans of Winthrop House are Stephen Chong and Kiran Gajwani, who were appointed to replace interim deans Mark Gearan and Mary Herlihy-Gearan. Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan took over for a one-year term following the College's decision not to let go of former deans Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and Stephanie Robinson in 2019. The two John Winthrops The first John Winthrop (1588-1649) was a member of the English gentry. In 1630, at the age of 41, Winthrop sold his home and sailed for New England, recording his visions that the New World could be a \\"city on a hill.\\" He served as leader of the Massachusetts Bay Company, then later became the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, a position he held for over sixteen years. His great-great-great-grandson John Winthrop (1714-1779) was the Hollis Professor of Mathematicks and Natural Philosophy from the age of 24 until his death at 65. Regarded as the first American astronomer, Winthrop also served briefly as the president of Harvard from 1773-1774. Structure Standish Hall, John Winthrop House, Harvard University =Architecture= The two halls which would become Winthrop House were built in the same year and share many attributes. Both are four-story U-shaped buildings surrounding courtyards, with a gated open side facing the Charles River. Their facades are based on Sir Christopher Wren's late-17th-century garden wing of the Hampton Court Palace. The present Gore Hall maintains the memory of Christopher Gore, who had bequeathed funds for construction (1841) of a prior Gore Hall, which was demolished about the time the present Gore Hall was built. It contains the Winthrop House dining hall in a below-street-level space at its center. In the corresponding spot, Standish Hall contains the Winthrop House Library, which holds the largest private collection of John Singleton Copley portraits. When Standish was still a stand-alone dormitory for freshmen, what is now the library was then its dining hall. =Gates= Two gates at opposite ends of the Yellowwood Courtyard, both built in 1914, connect Gore and Standish Halls. The front entrance, facing Mill Street, is the Winthrop Gate. The house shield is welded in the front. On the river side stands the Fly Club Gate, an English Baroque structure named after one of Harvard's male-only final clubs whose members provided a grant to build it. The panther symbol of the Fly Club is centered within the ironwork above the entry, and inscribed is the dedication: \\"For Friendships Made in College the Fly Club in Gratitude has Built this Gate.\\" Traditional social events =Stein Club= Stein Club is a themed event featuring beer and snacks for Winthrop Residents every other Thursday evening. It is usually held in Winthrop's Junior Common Room. Winthrop House sells beer steins annually with the house crest on them to be used at the stein clubs, though having one is not required to partake. Recent Stein Club themes include \\"Kung Fu,\\" \\"Comedy Night,\\" \\"Oktoberfest,\\" \\"Regatta,\\" and others. Stein Club is one of the most well attended events held in the house. Although many believe that Edward Kennedy began Winthrop's Stein Club tradition, this is not true. The origin of this apocryphal story is a humorous article that appeared in the Harvard Independent. =Arbella Ball= The Winthrop Arbella Ball is the house's annual spring formal dance. It is named after the Arbella, the ship upon which the first John Winthrop ventured to the new World. The ball typically features a live band playing under a beautiful tent before a temporary dance floor set up in the Gore Courtyard, and a reception in the Winthrop Junior Common Room. =Thropstock= Thropstock is Winthrop's annual spring carnival, held in late April or early May. Thropstock typically features blow-up rides and games in the courtyard, a picnic lunch, cotton candy, and live music by Harvard student bands. Recent performers include Plan B for the Type A's, So Long Princess, and others. Alumni Winthrop House's most famous former inhabitant was President John F. Kennedy. Harvard University maintains Kennedy's former senior year dorm room in Gore Hall as a private room for guests of the university, especially political notables who visit the Kennedy School of Government. The room has been renovated and redecorated by the Institute of Politics in order to make it more accommodating to visiting guests. The study is furnished with a plaque commemorating the late President Kennedy, a leather couch, and a large rug, along with framed photographs of Kennedy. The Kennedy Suite's bedroom has two twin beds, as well as a shelf of books written by and about President Kennedy. Other notable Winthrop alumni include United States Massachusetts Senators Edward Kennedy (D) and Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr (R; He lost his seat to the aforementioned JFK. He was actually a resident of Standish Hall, which is now part of Winthrop House); Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke; CEO of Goldman Sachs Lloyd Blankfein; UCLA professor and national security expert Amy Zegart; Berkeley professor and torture expert John Yoo; Clinton administration Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin; United States Representative Barney Frank (D); conservative African-American activist Alan Keyes; conservative anti-tax lobbyist Grover Norquist; Nixon administration cabinet official and Watergate figure Elliot Richardson; Harvard Law School Professor Charles Nesson; Minnesota Speaker of the House Paul Thissen; Beauty and the Geek Season 3 winner Alan \\"Scooter\\" Zackheim; and Comedian and comedy writer BJ Novak .

Beltrami County in Minnesota is named for him. He had an extensive network of notable figures for friends and acquaintances, such as members of the powerful Medici family.  Early life  Beltrami was born in the city of Bergamo in the northern Italian region of Lombardy, the 16th of 17 children. His exact birth date is unknown because a fire in the area destroyed baptismal records in 1793. He apparently had a fair amount of schooling in literature, law, and other subjects before leaving to become a soldier for the Cisalpine Republic in 1797. The republic was an extension of France at the time, and Beltrami worked his way into the Napoleonic government after becoming a Mason. Years later, when the Marche region again came under purview of the papal government, he was questioned for his activities. Beltrami was married to the sister of Count Pietro Bastogi, a notable Italian railway financier. In 1809, Beltrami became the friend of Giulia Spada dei Medici. When she died at the age of 39 in 1820, he put together a collection of different writings in her honor. He was distraught by her death, and this, combined with pressures about his background during French occupation, led him to begin traveling. He visited a number of different cities in Europe, reaching Liverpool, England in 1822. From there, he set out to the United States on a voyage that proved to be very treacherous. He finally arrived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania after more than two months on the ocean in December 1822 or January 1823.  Exploring North America  In the U.S. he also began visiting a number of different cities. He eventually began a voyage down the Ohio River with the intention of following it to the Mississippi and then south to New Orleans, Louisiana. However, while onboard he met with the prominent United States Indian agent, Lawrence Taliaferro, who was planning to travel upriver on the Mississippi. Beltrami soon became obsessed with the idea of finding the river's source. In 1823, the two later joined with Stephen H. Long as they traveled upriver to Fort Saint Anthony. Beltrami followed Long and Taliaferro as they went about exploring and mapping, and interacting with the local Native American tribes. However, in July, after about three months of this, tension began to grow between Beltrami and the others. He eventually split from their expedition in August, when the group had reached Pembina, and instead set off with some Ojibwe Indian guides on his personal quest to find the source of the river. After only a week and a half, his guides abandoned him and he had to carry on alone, seeking help from other natives that he came across. At some point during this trip, Beltrami collected two indigenous flutes, which he later sent back to Italy along with his collection of Native American artifacts. One of these flutes provides us with the oldest extant Native American flute, and is now in the collection of the Museo Civico di Scienze Naturali in Bergamo, Italy. On August 28, he found what he believed was the source of the Mississippi, as well as the Red River of the North. He named the place Giulia after his departed friend, and named eight other nearby lakes after her children. He began the return trip downriver to Fort Saint Anthony. Beltrami then continued south to his original destination of New Orleans, finally arriving in December. In the city, he began writing an account of his travels thus far. By late January, it was completed, and it was published a few months later. By that time, Beltrami was on another voyage through Mexico where he collected Aztec objects, classified plants and animals, and observed the area's political system. Particularly because of his work with flora, he would eventually be included in several scientific societies of France. He returned to New Orleans in 1825, but soon left to return to Philadelphia where many copies of his book were being stored. The Catholic church was also displeased, and condemned him and his work. By November, he was hob-nobbing with elites at festivities surrounding the opening of New York's Erie Canal.  Return to Europe  After some trips to Haiti, Santo Domingo, and elsewhere, Beltrami made a return trip across the Atlantic in 1826, arriving in London in the late part of the year. He moved to Paris two years later, and joined several scientific societies through the early 1830s. In 1834, Beltrami moved to Heidelberg, Germany and befriended Josef Anton Mittermaier, a notable jurist of the time. A few years later he finally returned to his estate in Filottrano. He attempted to have his books published in Italy, but the church-led government denied his requests. In his final years, he patterned his life on that of Franciscan friars, and called himself \\"Fra Giacomo.\\" Most of his time was spent working in his house and garden. He died there in 1855.

He served as the third Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and is the former Leader of the Opposition and former president of the New Democratic Party (NDP) after resigning in 2016. Eustace is the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of East Kingstown in the House of Assembly of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. On 27 October 2000, Eustace, then a political neophyte, succeeded James Fitz-Allen Mitchell as the leader of the NDP, and on 28 March 2001, the NDP was defeated in the 2001 general election in which the party was reduced from 8 to 3 seats, producing a majority government for the Unity Labour Party. In the 7 December 2005 general elections, Eustace's NDP also won 3 seats. In the 13 December 2010 general election, Eustace's NDP saw an increase in the popular vote to 48.67%, winning 7 seats in a close election. The number required to form a majority in the House of Assembly of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is 8, and the incumbent ULP formed government with a one-seat majority. Education and career Arnhim Eustace is an alumnus of the St Vincent Boys' Grammar School. He attended Sir George William University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where he earned a BSc in Economics and a MSc in Development Economics from University of Windsor (now Concordia) in Ontario, Canada. At the age of 27, Eustace became the youngest permanent secretary in St. Vincent and the Grenadines when he was so assigned to the Ministry of Agriculture. His ascendancy was cut short when in 1976 he resigned from the civil service on a point of principle. For roughly one year after his departure he fished, literally, the waters off Edinboro, until Sir William Demas flew into St. Vincent to recruit the young economist into the Caribbean Development Bank. In 1977, Eustace and his family relocated to Barbados where, with the exception of roughly one year, they lived for the next 16 years, his full tour of duty with the CDB. There he rose from Administrative Officer through the ranks of the institution, ultimately becoming Director of Projects, third in the line of seniority at the regional institution, before repatriating to St. Vincent in 1993. In 1985 Eustace was for 18 months seconded by the CDB to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) which assigned him to the Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines to review and implement changes to the public finance system and to manage government finances as Director General of Finance and Planning. Upon his 1993 return to St. Vincent, Eustace was appointed Fiscal Adviser to the Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. In 1998, he resigned from the public service and ran for political office, winning the East Kingstown parliamentary seat (which he has won for the past 4 consecutive elections by increasing margins of victory). Following the 1998 general elections, he was appointed Minister of Finance, Planning and the Public Service. Later that year he was offered the post of Deputy Secretary General of the British Commonwealth Secretariat in London, which he declined. Fifty-three countries constitute the Commonwealth of Nations. From 1993 to 1998 Eustace was chairman of WIBDECO as well as the Joint Venture Holding Companies in the UK. He headed the Windward Islands negotiating team for the acquisition of GEEST Bananas (including the GEEST shipping fleet) in a joint venture with Fyffes of Ireland. Eustace was chairman of the National Insurance Scheme (NIS). He was also the Government Director on the board of the East Caribbean Group of Companies (ECGC). In 2000, Eustace was elected leader of the New Democratic Party and upon the October 2000 retirement of Sir James Mitchell, was appointed prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines until the NDP's loss at the March 2001 General Elections. Eustace remains president of The New Democratic Party and Leader of the Opposition. In the three general elections his party has contested since he took the helm, the NDP has risen from 3‚Äì12 to 7‚Äì8, within narrow reach of forming government. In 2016, Eustace resigned as both Leader of the Opposition and President of the New Democratic Party after holding the two positions for 15 years.

He is especially revered in Gujarati literature, where he is acclaimed as its Adi Kavi (Sanskrit for \\"first among poets\\"). His bhajan Vaishnav Jan To was Mahatma Gandhi's favourite and has become synonymous with him. Biography per traditional sources Bust of Narsinh Mehta in Vadodara Narsinh Mehta was born in a Nagar Brahmin family at Talaja and later moved to Junagadh in Saurashtra peninsula of modern-day Gujarat. His father held an administrative post in a royal court. He lost his parents when he was five years old. He could not speak until the age of eight. He was raised by his grandmother Jaygauri. He married Manekbai probably in the year 1429. Mehta and his wife stayed at his brother Bansidhar's house in Junagadh. However, Bansidhar's wife (Sister-in-law or bhabhi) did not welcome Narsinh very well. She was an ill- tempered woman, always taunting and insulting Narsinh Mehta for his devotion (Bhakti). One day, when Narasinh Mehta had enough of these taunts and insults, he left the house and went to a nearby forest in search of some peace, where he fasted and meditated for seven days by a secluded Shiva lingam until Shiva appeared before him in person. On the poet's request, the Lord took him to Vrindavan and showed him the eternal raas leela of Krishna and the Gopis. A legend has it that the poet, transfixed by the spectacle, burnt his hand with the torch he was holding, but he was so engrossed in the ecstatic vision that he was oblivious to the pain. Mehta, as the popular account goes, at Krishna's command, decided to sing His praises and the nectarous experience of the rasa in this mortal world. He resolved to compose around 22,000 kirtans or compositions. After this divine experience, the transformed Mehta returned to his village, touched his sister-in-law's feet as reverence, and thanked her for insulting him for had she not made him upset, the above episode would not have occurred. In Junagadh, Mehta lived in poverty with his wife and two children, a son named Shamaldas, and a daughter for whom he had special affection, Kunwarbai. He revelled in devotion to his heart's content along with sadhus, saints, and all those people who were Lord Hari's subjects ‚Äì Harijans ‚Äì irrespective of their caste, class or sex. It also seems that he must have fallen into a somewhat ill repute amongst the Nagars following incidents like accepting invitation to sing glories of Lord Krishna in association of devotees belonging to lower social strata. The Nagars of Junagadh despised him and spared no opportunity to scorn and insult him . By this time, Mehta had already sung about the rasaleela of Radha and Krishna. The compositions are collected under the category of Shringar compositions. They are full of intense lyricism, based upon pastimes of conjugal love between the Supreme Lord and His most intimate devotees - the Gopis and are not without allegorical dimensions. Soon after his daughter, Kunwarbai's marriage (around 1447) to Shrirang Mehta of Una's son, Kunwarbai conceived and it had been a custom for the girl's parents to give gifts and presents to all the in-laws during the seventh month of pregnancy. This custom, known as Mameru, was simply out of the reach of materialistically poor Narsinh who had hardly anything except intransient faith in his Lord. How Krishna helped his beloved devotee is a legend depicted in 'Mameru Na Pada'. This episode is preserved vividly in the memory of Gujarati people by compositions by later poets and films. Other famous legends include: 'Hundi (Bond)' episode and 'Har Mala (Garland)' episode. The episode in which none other than Shamalsha Seth cleared a bond written by poverty-stricken beloved, is famous not only in Gujarat but in other parts of India as well. The Har Mala episode deals with the challenge given to Mehta by Ra Mandalika (1451‚Äì1472), a Chudasama king, to prove his innocence in the charges of immoral behaviour by making the Lord Himself garland Narsinh. Mehta depicts this episode. How Sri Krishna, in the guise of a wealthy merchant, helped Mehta in getting his son married is sung by the poet in Putra Vivah Na Pada. He went to Mangrol where, at the age of 79, he is believed to have died. The crematorium at Mangrol is called 'Narsinh Nu Samshan' where one of the sons of Gujarat and more importantly a great Vaishnav was cremated. He will forever be remembered for his poetic works and devotion to Lord Krishna. He is known as the first poet of Gujarati Adi Kavi.  Study of biography  Darshana Dholakiya had studied the development of biography of Narsinh Mehta. She has divided the development in three stages; biography from his poetry which is autobiographical in nature, biography emerging from poetry of poets born between Krishnadas and Premanand, biography written by poets after Premanand. She considers second stage very important because an image of Narsinh Mehta's personality was established during this period. =Time= No year is mentioned in his compositions. So there is difference of opinions among scholars about his time. The mention of Junagadh king Mandalika is considered to establish his date. No independent poem of the event of garland is found in the biographical poems of the poets of second period like Krishnadas, Vishnudas, Govind, Vishwanath Jani or Premanand but the event of garland is mentioned in some poems. A poem on the event of garland is independently found in the autobiographical poems said to be composed by Narsinh. The oldest manuscript dated Samvat 1675 has seven poems (pada) which also mentions Mandalika. So it can be said that the contemporaneity of Mandalika and Narsinh was established by Samvat 1675. One poem on the event of garland even mentions Samvat 1512 as the date of event but the authenticity is not established. So it is known that the contemporaneity of Mandalika and Narsinh is popular in old as well as new traditions. One question emerge from that why did Mandalika tested him even though he was mentioned as a religious Vaishnava in other sources. This Mandalika must have been Mandalika III ( or Samvat 1506‚Äì1527) and was defeated by Mahmud Begada. His defeat is connected to the test of Narsinh. Other reasons for his defeat mentioned are the curse of Charan lady Nagbai and his relation with wife of his minister Vishal. =Clan and pedigree= In older traditions, there is no mention of his clan. Names of his parents or brother is not mentioned either. Narsain Mehtanu Akhyan (written after Samvat 1705) mentions one Parvat Mehta but he was not related to Narsinh Mehta and he is just mentioned as a devotee. Vallabhdas' Shamaldasno Vivah gives information about his clan and ancestry. Purushottam is mentioned as his grandfather. His gotra is Kashyap. His Veda division and his family deities (Kuladevta and Kuladevi) is also mentioned. The following family tree is mentioned in it: *Purushottam **Parvatdas ***Narbat ***Haridas ***Ram **Krishnadas ***Narsinh ***Jivan ***Narbheram Draupadi Pattavidhan composed by Rangildas, son of Trikamdas, mentions that Trikamdas was mentioned in Narsinh's clan. But it can be taken as the common Nagar clan. Several pedigrees are recorded later but they differ from each other. One pedigree even mentions Narsinh as an uncle of Parvatdas though Parvatdas is commonly mentioned as an uncle of Narsinh. So authenticity of these pedigrees are questionable. Vallabhdas' Shamaldas no Vivah has years of Narsinh arranged so it seems that he had tried to establish his biography. So Dholakiya opines that the authentic pedigree of Narsinh Mehta has not survived. =Place of worshiped Shivalinga= The exact location of the non-reverend Shivalinga worshiped by Narsinh is not mentioned in old as well as new traditions. Shamaldas No Vivah, purportedly composed by Narsinh himself, mentions the place as Gopinath. Later work Narsain Mehtanu Akhyan mentions it as Gopeshwar. Some scholars mentions Gopnath near Talaja as the place but it is dubious because Narsinh had worshiped it in forest while the Gopnath is on the seashore. It must have been near Junagadh because mention of forest. =Family tradition= As he worshiped Shiva after leaving home, it can be said that his family tradition was Shaivism. He became Vaishnava due to Shiva. It is mentioned that other Nagars opposed him due to his Vaishnava tradition. Vishwanath Jani's Mosalacharitra mentions that a Nagar opposed him saying that he is not vipra (Brahmin) because he is Vaishnava. So Dholakiya opines that the event of Shiva may have originated to make his Vaishnava devotion acceptable. Harivallabh Bhayani opines that the Vaishnava devotion was prevalent in Narshin's time and it is not unusual that he was devotee of Vaishnava. He also mentions the Vaishnava surname among Nagars. =Education and profession= No education or profession other than religious devotion is mentioned in his poetry. It is said that he became poet due to grace of god but Bhayani opines that, if we consider Chaturi as his full or partial composition, its language, style and emotion establishes Narsinh's knowledge of literary traditions and creativity. Narsinh must have known Geet Govind, Vedant etc. It works seem influenced by Marathi poets like Namdev. So he must have studied according to his Nagar family tradition. =Society and Narsinh= Narsinh was opposed in his Nagar society but the opposition was not strong as much seen in other saint-poets like Meera and Kabir of that era. The reasons behind opposition seem his acceptance of Vaishnava tradition even though his family tradition was Shaiva, his attitude towards society and poor and his friendly devotion to god in view of orthodox society. His life events matches events of several popular saint-poets like Surdas, Tulsidas, Meera, Kabir, Namdev and Sundarar. While several saint-poets are not involved in household, Narsinh was involved in household even after his commitment to devotion. He lived with his family and he did not had any followers. Works Mehta is a pioneer poet of Gujarati literature. He is known for his literary forms called \\"pada (verse)\\", \\"Akhyana\\" and \\"Prabhatiya\\" (morning devotional songs). One of the most important features of Mehta's works is that they are not available in the language in which Narsinh had composed them. They have been largely preserved orally. The oldest available manuscript of his work is dated around 1612, and was found by the noted scholar Keshavram Kashiram Shastri from Gujarat Vidhya Sabha. Because of the immense popularity of his works, their language has undergone modifications with changing times. Mehta wrote many bhajans and Aartis for lord Krishna, and they are published in many books. The biography of Mehta is also available at Geeta Press. For the sake of convenience, the works of Mehta are divided into three categories: # Autobiographical compositions: Putra Vivah/Shamaldas no Vivah, Mameru/Kunvarbai nu Mameru, Hundi, Har Mala, Jhari Na Pada, and compositions depicting acceptance of Harijans. These works deal with the incidents from the poet‚Äôs life and reveal how he encountered the divine in various guises. They consist of 'miracles' showing how god helped his devotee Narsinh in the time of crises. # Miscellaneous Narratives: Chaturis, Sudama Charit, Dana Leela, and episodes based on Srimad Bhagwatam. These are the earliest examples of akhyana or narrative type of compositions found in Gujarati. These include: ## Chaturis, 52 compositions resembling Jaydeva‚Äôs masterpiece Geeta Govinda dealing with various erotic exploits of Radha and Krishna. ## Dana Leela poems dealing with the episodes of Krishna collecting his dues (dana is toll, tax or dues) from Gopis who were going to sell buttermilk etc. to Mathura. ## Sudama Charit is a narrative describing the well-known story of Krishna and Sudama. ## Govinda Gamana or the \\"Departure of Govind\\" relates the episode of Akrura taking away Krishna from Gokul. ## Surata Sangrama, The Battle of Love, depicts in terms of a battle the amorous play between Radha and her girl friends on the one side and Krishna and his friends on the other. ## Miscellaneous episodes from Bhagwatam like the birth of Krishna, his childhood pranks and adventures. # Songs of Sringar. These are hundreds of padas dealing with the erotic adventures and the amorous exploits of Radha and Krishna like Ras Leela. Various clusters of padas like Rasasahasrapadi and Sringar Mala fall under this head. Their dominant note is erotic (Sringar). They deal with stock erotic situations like the ossified Nayaka-Nayika Bheda of classical Sanskrit Kavya poetics. See: Vaishnav jan to, his popular composition. In popular culture The first Gujarati talkie film, Narsinh Mehta (1932) directed by Nanubhai Vakil was based on Narsinh Mehta's life. It was devoid of any miracles due to Gandhian influence. The bilingual film Narsi Mehta in Hindi and Narsi Bhagat in Gujarati (1940) directed by Vijay Bhatt included miracles and had paralleled Mehta with Mahatma Gandhi. Narsaiyo (1991) was a Gujarati television series telecast by the Ahmedabad centre of Doordarshan starring Darshan Jariwala in lead role. This 27-episode successful series was produced by Nandubhai Shah and directed by Mulraj Rajda.

The main Narashima temples at each site were built or expanded by the emperors of Vijayanagara in the 15th and 16th centuries, then sacked by the Mughals in 1578, then restored and expanded at various times, up to the present day. As they stand, they are a mixture of work from all these periods.Michell, 330 History Ahobilam is traditionally regarded as the place where Vishnu in the form of Narasimha killed the Rakshasa Hiranyakashipu in order to save his devotee Prahlada. The legend says that Narasimha emerged from a rock pillar to slay the Rakshasha. The moment is represented in a number of murti in the various temples. Also, Garuda prayed for a vision of Narasimha in the form of Avathara, to fulfil his wish, and settled in nine forms across the hills in Ahobilam. Geography Ahobilam is located at . It is located in Nallamala Forest, along the Eastern Ghats. Notes References *Blurton, T.

Early years Dean Butterworth was born in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England. He moved to the United States at age 10 and started learning to play the drums at age 12. During the early years he focused on the intricacies of jazz and fusion drumming, but after experiencing the chameleon-like way in which Stewart Copeland of The Police switched fluidly from one style to another, often within the same song, he began to branch out into many different styles. His stepfather, Patrick Shanahan, was also an influence on his drumming, advising him to learn a wide variety of musical styles. It is the versatility he gained then which later allowed Butterworth to work with many different artists, including blues legend John Lee Hooker. He is a supporter of Rochdale A.F.C. Career =Good Charlotte and The Madden Brothers (2005‚Äìpresent)= In May 2005, after Good Charlotte parted with their drummer due to drug use and inability for Chris Wilson to tour, Butterworth was called in as a temporary replacement. He performed on their 2007 album Good Morning Revival. On the eve of the release of their next studio album the temporary membership was turned into a permanent one. The band released their fifth studio album, Cardiology, in November 2010. Butterworth worked with Joel and Benji Madden from Good Charlotte on their band the Madden Brothers, drumming on their album Greetings from California, released in 2014. His third album with Good Charlotte and their sixth overall Youth Authority was released in July 2016. His fourth and their seventh Generation Rx was released in September 2018. =Other projects (1997‚Äìpresent)= Between 1997 and 2001, Butterworth was one of The Innocent Criminals, the band of Ben Harper. Butterworth sang, played the piano and guitar and wrote his own songs. One of the songs he co-wrote with Harper is \\"She's Only Happy in the Sun\\", from the album Diamonds on the Inside. In 2002 Butterworth toured with Morrissey. In 2003 he worked with surfer and musician Donavon Frankenreiter, on whose self-titled album he plays the drums and sings, with fellow ex-Innocent Criminals David Leach on percussion. In the fall of 2003, Butterworth laid down drum tracks for a song with Scott Shriner, the current bassist of Weezer; Justin Shekoski, guitarist for Saosin; and Anthony Green, singer for Saosin at the time. The song, entitled \\"I've Been Dying To Reach You\\", was allegedly recorded to test out the new home studio of John Feldmann, producer and singer for Goldfinger. The song was originally released only on the internet, but a version was later released as \\"Dear Child (I've Been Dying To Reach You)\\" on Green's debut album Avalon in 2008. In 2004, Butterworth toured once more with Morrissey. Butterworth recorded drums for the Used on their third album, Lies for the Liars, after their former drummer, Branden Steineckert, was kicked out of the band. He drummed for the Cab on their album Symphony Soldier, released on August 23, 2011. He is also the drummer and band leader of the house band for the NBC game show Hollywood Game Night. In 2016, Butterworth became a permanent member of Sugar Ray along with Kristian Attard, replacing Bivona brothers, after being a touring member since 2013. In 2017, Butterworth drummed for Hollywood Undead on their album Five.

Ciresi is a prominent trial attorney and was a Democratic- Farmer-Labor Party candidate for the United States Senate from Minnesota. He dropped out on March 10, 2008. Ciresi gained his public reputation by litigating several high-profile mass tort cases. Ciresi is the former Chairman of the Executive Board of the Minneapolis firm Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi LLP, a 250-lawyer firm he joined in 1971. He left in 2015 to form his own firm.Wahlberg, Adam, \\"Mike Ciresi breaks up with himself\\", MinnPost, January 7, 2015. Role in Minnesota lawsuit against Big Tobacco He was counsel to the State of Minnesota and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota against the American tobacco industry, suing in 1994 as the second of eventually 46 states to join in the tobacco litigation. Ciresi's Minneapolis law firm, Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi, of which he was the chair, settled with the tobacco companies in 1998 with an agreement for the tobacco defendants to pay the state of Minnesota $6 billion. The law firm donated $30 million to the Minneapolis Foundation in 1998, a contribution made possible by the settlement fee; at the time, the gift was thought to be the largest contribution from a law firm to a community foundation. Ciresis has been on the Board of Trustees of his alma mater, the University of St. Thomas, and on the Board of Governors of the University of St. Thomas School of Law. He has served on the board of Regions Hospital Foundation and Minnesota Early Learning Foundation. Ciresi's law firm was mentioned in the press for the legal fees collected in the 1998 tobacco settlement, variously reported as between $440 million and $558 million . The fees were to be paid over two years , in contrast to the 25-year annual payment scheme used to pay the plaintiffs of the case, the State of Minnesota. The fees were funded directly by tobacco companies. As a result of the 1998 Minnesota tobacco settlement, Ciresi came to be known as a wealthy man and philanthropist, appearing regularly in the national and local press. According to Forbes magazine, with Ciresi among the highest-paid lawyers in the USA, \\"Cigarette money alone put these ten lawyers on the top-earning list‚Äîand it's likely to keep them there for the next 25 years.\\" The magazine listed Ciresi's personal annual income at $14.4 million in 2000. Forbes speculated that Ciresi would use his newfound wealth and prominence to run for political office, which soon proved correct. Other famous cases Ciresi served as counsel to the Government of India against Union Carbide over the Bhopal catastrophe. He was counsel to women rendered infertile by the Copper 7 IUD and to the families of women killed by the Dalkon Shield IUD. U.S. Senate run Ciresi ran in the 2000 Senate primary for the Democratic-Farmer- Labor Party (DFL), spending several million dollars of his own money on the campaign. Ciresi ran as a self-described progressive moderate, and was endorsed by the Sierra Club and the Minnesota Nurses' Association. Ciresi was handily defeated by Mark Dayton, an heir to the founders of Target Corporation, in the four-way DFL primary. Dayton then came from behind in the polls to defeat first-term incumbent Republican Senator Rod Grams in the general election. Dayton announced in early 2005 that he would not seek a second term.Michael Khoo, \\"Dayton won't seek re-election as Minnesota U.S. senator\\", Minnesota Public Radio, February 9, 2005. Although Ciresi indicated an interest in the race and registered the domain name ciresiforsenate.com within 48 hours of Dayton's announcement, he announced on February 7 that he would not seek the nomination.. He would have faced Hennepin County district attorney Amy Klobuchar and Ford Bell in the DFL primary. On April 18, 2007, Ciresi announced that he would seek the DFL endorsement] for the Senate seat held by Norm Coleman. Other Democrats in the race included author and satirist Al Franken, professor and author Jack Nelson-Pallmeyer, and Human Rights Activist Jim Cohen. On March 10, 2008, Ciresi announced his withdrawal from the primary>. On June 7, 2008, the Minnesota DFL endorsed Franken. Ciresi was widely reported on June 11 as saying he was \\"leaving all options on the table\\" when questioned about a possible primary run against Franken. But Ciresi eventually dropped out of the race without challenging Franken in the primary.

Plot The OVA focuses mostly on the girls of St Ignacio's School for girls than the mecha itself. There are two clubs to join: , where admission is said to lead to ultimate success; or , which is said to teach the values of common courtesy in the world. Three freshmen join the Etiquette club rather than the popular Debutante Club and soon discover its founding members are part of a secret task force called Exters (ExStars in the dubbed version). Fan service is a predominated feature in the transformation sequence. The battles are not only for school hierarchy, but to save the world. Story *Episode 1: The Lightning is Mine to Command! The story opens as Sayaka Kitaouji takes off from space and head towards Earth in her private shuttle where Todou briefs her on Uruyasu's stocks. On Earth, at St. Ignacio's School for Girls, two freshmen Saori Tachibana and Shihoko Sakaki head towards Orientation Day in the school's auditorium. Sayaka makes a powerful speech in order to receive more members for the already popular Debutante Club. Etiquette Club VP Rie Shibusawa tries her best to make a speech herself but ends up failing as president Reika Ayanokoji looks on in disbelief. The failed speech inspires Shihoko to join the Etiquette Club and brings Saori and their newfound friend Kanami Ezaki to the clubhouse. Once inside, arrows came flying out. Saori ducks under one, Kanami chops another in midair, but Shihoko was hit with the arrow. Luckily, it was a prop arrow. Reika and Rie explain everything about the Etiquette Club in detail to the new girls in hopes of improving their skills. At the end of the day, Sayaka heads off campus and informs Todou to take some men and rob the Mitsuido Bank, a bank that finances most of Uruyasu. Later that night, Saori, Shihoko and Kanami each sneak into the Etiquette Clubhouse and try to uncover its secret. They soon discover an underground base with Battle Skippers. Each of the girls pilot the Battle Skippers to where Reika and Rie are: the Mitsuido Bank. To the shock of Reika and Rie and even Todou's men, the new girls arrived and stopped the robbery. Todou decided to cut his losses and run, but his associates were soon captured by Reika and Rie and handed them over to the authorities. Back at base, Rie scolded Kanami, Saori and Shihoko for their reckless and foolish act, but Reika calmed her down and decided to welcome the girls as official members of Exters. *Episode 2: A Heartache Tonight With the Mitsuido Bank robbery a bust, Sayaka takes her anger out on Todou for his cowardice. In order to get back in her good graces, Todou hatches a plan to lure of the new members of Exters to deliver the AIES to Makuhari. Sayaka accepts his offer and warns him not to disappoint her again. Back at school in the Etiquette Club, Rie rides Saori, Shihoko and Kanami like a drill sergeant to make them stronger and powerful pilots. Nearby, the robbers from the Mitsuido heist are joined by another man and Todou steps out in a priest's outfit. The next day, Saori heads off to school alone and is confronted by Todo's gang who try to rape her until Todou assaults them and knocks them down. Saori is immediately awe-struck with Todo who introduces himself as \\"Brother Gilbert\\". At school, Todou becomes the substitute teacher and easily gains Saori's trust. She hoped to kiss him to repay him for saving her life, but instead Todou slips a drug into her mouth which has hypnotic effects. Soon, Saori was ordered under hypnosis to retrieve the AIES from her Battle Skipper and bring it to him and to make sure to dispose of anyone who interferes. However, the remaining Exters snap Saori out of her trance and explain Todou's deceit. Infuriated that she was used, Saori unleashes her anger on Todou, but not before his men destroy the base and rescue him. The Exters chase the Makuhari Battle Skippers all over Tokyo and Saori decides to use the AIES combat software to pay back Todou. However, Todou has tricks up his sleeve as well as his Battle Skipper and 3 other Makuhari Battle Skippers form a giant robot. Reika and Rie use their own Battle Skippers to form a powerful ring of energy to destroy the giant robot and force Todou and his men to retreat. Back at their ruined base, Reika reveals to the Exters the true base known as \\"Josephine Rose\\". *Episode 3: The Super-Radical One-Night Show Having figured out the identities of the Exters, Sayaka hopes to be rid of them once and for all. She had the principal of St. Ignacio's force the Etiquette Club to disband within 24 hours or face expulsion. Reika knows this is all a Makuhari plot and heads towards their main building. Upon arrival, she is held captive. At night, the remaining Exters hold off Sayaka's Four Divas (leaders of the sports clubs who do Sayaka's dirty work). Kanami easily disposes of the Four Divas and join Rie, Saori and Shihoko in Josephine Rose to rescue Reika. Suddenly, a large fortress appears with Sayaka and Todou at the helm hoping to bring down the Exters forever, but Josephine Rose held its own and unleashes its own power to knock out the flying fortress. As if things weren't bad for Sayaka, her mother overheard everything happening at school. She informs Sayaka that she's reinstated the Etiquette Club in order to teach her humility and modesty, and should a cowardly act be repeated, there would be consequences. Sayaka swallows her pride and accepts her loss and calls a retreat. The show ends with the Exters proud of defending their club, their honor and the rest of the world. Main characters *Reika Ayanokouji : is the President of the Etiquette Club and heiress of Uruyasu Heavy Industries. Reika is soft-spoken and always protective of the secrets of the Battle Skippers, fearing they might fall into evil hands. Reika is a blood relative of her spoiled rival Sayaka Kitaouji. *Rie Shibusawa (mispronounced as \\"Rye\\" in the English dub) : is the Vice-president of the Etiquette Club. Rie is usually brash, hot-headed and unpredictable, a foil for Reika's cool head. Rie is equally strong on the battlefield as Reika and is ever loyal to her and her family. Rie has an extreme hatred for the Debutante Club and is a struggling student at St. Ignacio's. *Saori Tachibana : is a freshman at St. Ignacio's who originally wanted to join the Debutante Club, but was coaxed by Shihoko to join the Etiquette Club instead. Saori was made to mimic Sailor Moon's hairstyle, but all similarity ends there. Most fan service is towards Saori on occasion. *Kanami Ezaki : is a meganekko and freshman at St. Ignacio's who joined the Etiquette Club for her detestment of Sayaka Kitaouji and the Debutante Club. Kanami is one of the smartest girls in Japan and secretly one of the strongest, in which Reika and Rie already know. Kanami quickly became close friends with Saori and Shihoko on her first day. *Shihoko Sakaki : is a freshman at St. Ignacio's and Saori's childhood friend. After seeing Rie's failed speech of asking people to join the Etiquette Club, Shihoko decides to join. Shihoko may be shy and frail, but she never gives up. Shihoko looks to Rie like an older sister. *Sayaka Kitaouji : is the President of the Debutante Club, heiress of Makuhari Heavy Industries and the main antagonist of the series. Sayaka wants a Japan ruled by women as powerful as her to dominate the world. Most of the income for St. Ignacio's is funded by Makuhari Industries and because of this, Sayaka and the Debutante Club feel like they can get away with everything at school. However, Sayaka's plans to eliminate the Etiquette Club backfire on her as her mother funded the Etiqutte Club in order to teach Sayaka respect and courtesy towards others. *Todou : is Sayaka's personal assistant and whipping boy. He is a bish≈çnen who would do anything for Sayaka, since he has a crush on her. On the battlefield, Todou is equally cunning and ruthless in his goals to crush the Exters and securing Makuhari as the only sole survivor of the mechanical industry war. The Battle Skippers The Battle Skippers are tank like robots each with an AIES expert system connected to enhance the pilot's movement. The manufacturers names are , , and . The Battle Skippers piloted by the Exters are Uruyasu while those piloted by the Debutante Club are Makuhari. Saori's Battle Skipper has a Kansai accent while Rie's has more of an Osaka dialect (\\"country\\" dialect in the dub). The Battle Skippers of Uruyasu * Reika's red Battle Skipper. It can form a Bifractal Circle with Sky Cats. Testa Road is adapted for high-speed chases and pursuits, which is why it was named for the look and feel of the Ferrari Testarossa. * Rie's white Battle Skipper which has an Osakan dialect (\\"country\\" dialect in the English dub). It can form a Bifractal Circle with Testa Road. Like its name suggests, Sky Cats is an aerial tactics Battle Skipper. * Saori's blue Battle Skipper with the obnoxious Kansai accent. When Saori understood the combat software within the AIES, she unleashed it on Todou and his men. Mega Diver is adapted for deep sea excavations and underwater reconnaissance. * Kanami's purple Battle Skipper. Night Walker has built-in hovercraft parts and is mostly used for stealth missions and espionage. * Shihoko's green Battle Skipper.

As it's aptly named, Grand Buster is the Battle Skipper has a fully stocked arsenal of hybrid weapons. The Battle Skippers of Makuhari * The combination of 4 Battle Skippers including Todou's to form a giant robot (named \\"Unity\\" in the English dub). Its size was gigantic but its movement was sluggish, and eventually it was destroyed by the Exters and the Bifractal Circle (a ring of electromagnetic energy).

Without virtual inheritance, if two classes \`B\` and \`C\` inherit from a class \`A\`, and a class \`D\` inherits from both \`B\` and \`C\`, then \`D\` will contain two copies of \`A\`s member variables: one via \`B\`, and one via \`C\`. These will be accessible independently, using scope resolution. Instead, if classes \`B\` and \`C\` inherit virtually from class \`A\`, then objects of class \`D\` will contain only one set of the member variables from class \`A\`. This feature is most useful for multiple inheritance, as it makes the virtual base a common subobject for the deriving class and all classes that are derived from it. This can be used to avoid the diamond problem by clarifying ambiguity over which ancestor class to use, as from the perspective of the deriving class (\`D\` in the example above) the virtual base (\`A\`) acts as though it were the direct base class of \`D\`, not a class derived indirectly through a base (\`B\` or \`C\`). It is used when inheritance represents restriction of a set rather than composition of parts. In C++, a base class intended to be common throughout the hierarchy is denoted as virtual with the \`virtual\` keyword. Consider the following class hierarchy. struct Animal { virtual ~Animal() = default; virtual void Eat() {} }; struct Mammal: Animal { virtual void Breathe() {} }; struct WingedAnimal: Animal { virtual void Flap() {} }; // A bat is a winged mammal struct Bat: Mammal, WingedAnimal {}; Bat bat; As declared above, a call to \`bat.Eat\` is ambiguous because there are two \`Animal\` (indirect) base classes in \`Bat\`, so any \`Bat\` object has two different \`Animal\` base class subobjects. So an attempt to directly bind a reference to the \`Animal\` subobject of a \`Bat\` object would fail, since the binding is inherently ambiguous: Bat b; Animal& a = b; // error: which Animal subobject should a Bat cast into, // a Mammal::Animal or a WingedAnimal::Animal? To disambiguate, one would have to explicitly convert \`bat\` to either base class subobject: Bat b; Animal& mammal = static_cast(b); Animal& winged = static_cast(b); In order to call \`Eat\`, the same disambiguation, or explicit qualification is needed: \`static_cast(bat).Eat()\` or \`static_cast(bat).Eat()\` or alternatively \`bat.Mammal::Eat()\` and \`bat.WingedAnimal::Eat()\`. Explicit qualification not only uses an easier, uniform syntax for both pointers and objects but also allows for static dispatch, so it would arguably be the preferable method. In this case, the double inheritance of \`Animal\` is probably unwanted, as we want to model that the relation (\`Bat\` is an \`Animal\`) exists only once; that a \`Bat\` is a \`Mammal\` and is a \`WingedAnimal\` does not imply that it is an \`Animal\` twice: an \`Animal\` base class corresponds to a contract that \`Bat\` implements (the \\"is a\\" relationship above really means \\"implements the requirements of\\"), and a \`Bat\` only implements the \`Animal\` contract once. The real world meaning of \\"is a only once\\" is that \`Bat\` should have only one way of implementing \`Eat\`, not two different ways, depending on whether the \`Mammal\` view of the \`Bat\` is eating, or the \`WingedAnimal\` view of the \`Bat\`. (In the first code example we see that \`Eat\` is not overridden in either \`Mammal\` or \`WingedAnimal\`, so the two \`Animal\` subobjects will actually behave the same, but this is just a degenerate case, and that does not make a difference from the C++ point of view.) This situation is sometimes referred to as diamond inheritance (see Diamond problem) because the inheritance diagram is in the shape of a diamond. Virtual inheritance can help to solve this problem. The solution We can re-declare our classes as follows: struct Animal { virtual ~Animal() = default; virtual void Eat() {} }; // Two classes virtually inheriting Animal: struct Mammal: virtual Animal { virtual void Breathe() {} }; struct WingedAnimal: virtual Animal { virtual void Flap() {} }; // A bat is still a winged mammal struct Bat: Mammal, WingedAnimal {}; The \`Animal\` portion of \`Bat::WingedAnimal\` is now the same \`Animal\` instance as the one used by \`Bat::Mammal\`, which is to say that a \`Bat\` has only one, shared, \`Animal\` instance in its representation and so a call to \`Bat::Eat\` is unambiguous. Additionally, a direct cast from \`Bat\` to \`Animal\` is also unambiguous, now that there exists only one \`Animal\` instance which \`Bat\` could be converted to. The ability to share a single instance of the \`Animal\` parent between \`Mammal\` and \`WingedAnimal\` is enabled by recording the memory offset between the \`Mammal\` or \`WingedAnimal\` members and those of the base \`Animal\` within the derived class. However this offset can in the general case only be known at runtime, thus \`Bat\` must become (\`vpointer\`, \`Mammal\`, \`vpointer\`, \`WingedAnimal\`, \`Bat\`, \`Animal\`). There are two vtable pointers, one per inheritance hierarchy that virtually inherits \`Animal\`. In this example, one for \`Mammal\` and one for \`WingedAnimal\`. The object size has therefore increased by two pointers, but now there is only one \`Animal\` and no ambiguity. All objects of type \`Bat\` will use the same vpointers, but each \`Bat\` object will contain its own unique \`Animal\` object. If another class inherits from \`Mammal\`, such as \`Squirrel\`, then the vpointer in the \`Mammal\` part of \`Squirrel\` will generally be different to the vpointer in the \`Mammal\` part of \`Bat\` though they may happen to be the same should the \`Squirrel\` class be the same size as \`Bat\`.

It is an autosomal recessive, multiple malformation syndrome caused by a mutation in the enzyme 7-Dehydrocholesterol reductase encoded by the DHCR7 gene. It causes a broad spectrum of effects, ranging from mild intellectual disability and behavioural problems to lethal malformations. Signs and symptoms SLOS can present itself differently in different cases, depending on the severity of the mutation and other factors. Originally, SLOS patients were classified into two categories (classic and severe) based on physical and mental characteristics, alongside other clinical features. Since the discovery of the specific biochemical defect responsible for SLOS, patients are given a severity score based on their levels of cerebral, ocular, oral, and genital defects. It is then used to classify patients as having mild, classical, or severe SLOS. =Physical characteristics= The most common facial features of SLOS include microcephaly, bitemporal narrowing (reduced distance between temples), ptosis, a short and upturned nose, micrognathia, epicanthal folds, and capillary hemangioma of the nose. Other physical characteristics include: Syndactyly of the second and third toes *low-set and posteriorly rotated ears *high-arched, narrow, hard palate *cleft lip/palate *agenesis or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum *cerebellar hypoplasia *increased ventricular size *decreased frontal lobe size *polydactyly of hands or feet *short, proximally placed thumb *other finger malformations *syndactyly of second and third toes *ambiguous or female-like male genitalia *congenital heart defects *renal, pulmonary, liver and eye abnormalities =Behavioural characteristics= Certain behaviours and attributes are commonly seen among patients suffering from SLOS. They may have low normal intelligence, and react negatively or with hypersensitivity to different sensory stimuli. This is particularly true for certain auditory and visual stimuli. Many patients show aggressiveness and self-injurious behaviours, and sleep disturbances are common. Specific behaviours resembling those of people with autism are often present as well as hyperactivity, which provides genetic and biological insights into autism spectrum disorders. The autistic behaviours most characteristic of SLOS patients are opisthokinesis (an upper body movement), stretching of the upper body, and hand flicking. Autism is typically diagnosed separately from SLOS using the DSM-V, and approximately 50‚Äì75% of SLOS patients meet the criteria for autism. Other behaviours associated with SLOS can be linked directly to physical abnormalities. For example, infants often show feeding problems or feeding intolerance, and patients may require increased caloric intake due to accelerated metabolism. Recurrent infections, including ear infections and pneumonia, are also common. =Biochemical phenotype= Given that SLOS is caused by a mutation in an enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis, the resulting biochemical characteristics may be predictable. Most patients have lowered plasma cholesterol levels (hypocholesterolemia). However, approximately 10% may show normal cholesterol levels, and decreased concentrations of cholesterol are not solely indicative of SLOS. Increased levels of cholesterol precursors are also common in SLOS. In particular, elevated levels of 7-dehydrocholesterol are fairly specific to SLOS. Genetics =DHCR7= The gene encoding DHCR7 (labeled as DHCR7) was cloned in 1998, and has been mapped to chromosome 11q12-13. It is 14100 base pairs of DNA in length, and contains nine exons, the corresponding mRNA is 2786 base pairs in length (the remaining DNA sequence is intronic). The structure of the DHCR7 rat gene is very similar to the structure of the human gene. The highest levels of DHCR7 expression have been detected in the adrenal gland, the testis, the liver and in brain tissue. Its expression is induced by decreased sterol concentrations via sterol regulatory binding proteins (SREBP). There is also evidence that its activity may be regulated by tissue specific transcription, and alternative splicing. As outlined above, the enzyme DHCR7 catalyzes the reduction of 7DHC to cholesterol, as well as the reduction of 7-dehydrodesmosterol to desmosterol. It requires NADPH as a cofactor for this reduction, and may involve the activity of cytochrome-P450 oxidoreductase. It is also thought to contain iron. DHCR7 is an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum, and computer models have predicted up to nine transmembrane domains. DHCR7 is most efficient at reducing 7DHC, but it is known to reduce the carbon 7 double bond of other sterols, indicating a range of substrate specificity. The human version of this enzyme is predicted to have a molecular weight of 54,489 kDa, and an isoelectric point of 9.05. The amino acid sequence that encodes DHCR7 is predicted to contain 475 amino acids, as well as several protein motifs. It contains multiple sterol reductase motifs, as would be expected given its function. It contains a potential sterol-sensing domain (SSD), whose function is unknown but thought to be necessary for binding sterol substrates. It also includes multiple sites of phosphorylation, including potential protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase sites (regulatory enzymes responsible for phosphorylation). The exact function of phosphorylating DHCR7 is yet unknown, but it is thought to be involved in the regulation of its activity. =Mutations and incidence= Missense mutations account for 87.6% of the SLOS spectrum SLOS is an autosomal recessive disorder. More than 130 different types of mutations have been identified. Missense mutations (single nucleotide change resulting in a code for a different amino acid) are the most common, accounting for 87.6% of the SLOS spectrum. These typically reduce the function of the enzyme but may not inhibit it completely. Much depends on the nature of the mutation (i.e. which amino acid is replaced and where). Null mutations are much less common, these mutations produce either a completely dysfunctional enzyme, or no enzyme at all. Thus, missense mutations may be more common overall because they are less lethal than nonsense mutations; nonsense mutations may simply result in spontaneous abortion. The IVS8-1G>C is the most frequently reported mutation in DHCR7. This disrupts the joining of exons eight and nine, and results in the insertion of 134 nucleotides into the DHCR7 transcript. This is a nonsense mutation, thus patients that are homozygous for this allele are severely affected. It is thought that this mutation first occurred in the British Isles, and it has a carrier (those that are heterozygous for the allele but not affected) frequency of 1.09% for Caucasians of European heritage. The frequency of mutations differs for various ethnicities, depending on the origin of the mutation. In all Caucasian populations, this particular mutation has an estimated carrier frequency of 3%. The next most common mutation is 278C>T, and results in a threonine at the amino acid position 93. It is a missense mutation and tends to be associated with less severe symptoms. This mutation is the most common one seen in patients of Italian, Cuban, and Mediterranean descent. The third most common mutation is 452G>A. This nonsense mutation causes protein termination, such that the enzyme DHCR7 would not be formed. It is thought to have arisen in Southern Poland and is most common in Northern Europe. Other mutations are less common, although appear to target certain protein domains more so than others. For example, the sterol reductase motifs are common sites of mutation. Overall, there is an estimated carrier frequency (for any DHCR7 mutation causing SLOS) of 3-4% in Caucasian populations (it is less frequent among Asian and African populations). This number indicates a hypothetical birth incidence between 1/2500 and 1/4500. However, the measured incidence is between 1/10,000 to 1/60,000 (it differs depending on heritage and descent). This is much lower than expected. This indicates that many cases of SLOS are undetected, and is likely due to either spontaneous abortion caused by severe mutations (miscarriage), or mild cases that are undiagnosed. Females lack the characteristic genital malformations that affected males have, and thus are less likely to be correctly diagnosed. Cholesterol metabolism and function =Metabolism= Cholesterol can be obtained through the diet, but it can also be formed by metabolism in the body. Cholesterol metabolism primarily takes place in the liver, with significant amounts in the intestine as well. It should also be noted that cholesterol cannot pass the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, thus within the brain, biosynthesis is the only source of cholesterol. Mevalonate pathway. In humans, cholesterol synthesis begins with the mevalonate pathway (see diagram), leading to the synthesis of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). This pathway uses two acetyl-CoA and two NADPH to make mevalonate, which is metabolized to isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) using three ATP. From there, three IPP are needed to make one FPP. The combination of two FPP leads to the formation of squalene; this represents the first committed step towards cholesterol biosynthesis. Squalene leads to the creation of lanosterol, from which there are multiple pathways that lead to cholesterol biosynthesis. The rate limiting step of cholesterol synthesis is the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl- CoA (HMG-CoA) to mevalonate, this is an early step in the mevalonate pathway catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase. Reaction scheme of squalene giving lanosterol. Multiple pathways leading to cholesterol from lanosterol, including the Kandutsch-Russel pathway. Highlighted in red is the double bond which is reduced by the enzyme DHCR7. Through a complicated series of reactions, lanosterol leads to the formation of zymosterol. As shown in a diagram to the right, it is at this point that the pathway diverges. In humans, the main pathway leading to cholesterol is known as the Kandutsch‚ÄìRussell pathway. Zymosterol is metabolized to 5Œ±-cholesta-7,24-dien-3Œ≤-ol, then to lathosterol, and then to 7-dehydrocholesterol, or 7-DHC. 7-DHC is the immediate precursor to cholesterol, and the enzyme DHCR7 is responsible for converting 7-DHC to cholesterol. DHCR7 reduces the double bond on carbon 7 of 7-DHC, leading to the unesterified product. Mutations in this enzyme are responsible for the wide range of defects present in SLOS. In another pathway leading to cholesterol synthesis, DHCR7 is required for the reduction of 7-Dehydrodesmosterol to desmosterol. =Regulation= Regulation of cholesterol synthesis is complex and occurs primarily through the enzyme HMG- CoA reductase (catalyst of the rate-limiting step). It involves a feedback loop that is sensitive to cellular levels of cholesterol. The four main steps of regulation are: * The synthesis of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase is controlled by sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP). This is a transcription factor that is inactive when cholesterol levels are high, and active when cholesterol levels are low. When cholesterol levels fall, SREBP is released from the nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum, it then migrates to the nucleus and causes the transcription of the HMG-CoA reductase gene. * The translation (creating the enzyme from the mRNA transcript) of HMG-CoA reductase is inhibited by derivatives of mevalonate and by dietary cholesterol. * The degradation of HMG-CoA reductase is tightly controlled. The part of the enzyme that is bound to the endoplasmic reticulum senses signals, such as increased cholesterol levels, that lead to its degradation or proteolysis. * When HMG-CoA reductase is phosphorylated, its activity decreases. This means cholesterol synthesis is reduced when cell energy (ATP) levels are low. =Function= Cholesterol is an important lipid involved in metabolism, cell function, and structure. It is a structural component of the cell membrane, such that it provides structure and regulates the fluidity of the phospholipid bilayer. Furthermore, cholesterol is a constituent in lipid rafts. These are congregations of proteins and lipids (including sphingolipids and cholesterol) that float within the cell membrane, and play a role in the regulation of membrane function. Lipid rafts are more ordered or rigid than the membrane bilayer surrounding them. Their involvement in regulation stems mostly from their association with proteins; upon binding substrates, some proteins have a higher affinity for attaching to lipid rafts. This brings them in close proximity with other proteins, allowing them to affect signaling pathways. Cholesterol specifically acts as a spacer and a glue for lipid rafts; absence of cholesterol leads to the dissociation of proteins. Given its prevalence in cell membranes, cholesterol is highly involved in certain transport processes. It may influence the function of ion channels and other membrane transporters. For example, cholesterol is necessary for the ligand binding activity of the serotonin receptor. In addition, it appears to be very important in exocytosis. Cholesterol modulates the properties of the membrane (such as membrane curvature), and may regulate the fusion of vesicles with the cell membrane. It may also facilitate the recruitment of complexes necessary for exocytosis. Given that neurons rely heavily on exocytosis for the transmission of impulses, cholesterol is a very important part of the nervous system. Functions and derivatives of cholesterol. One particularly relevant pathway in which cholesterol takes place is the Hedgehog signaling pathway. This pathway is very important during embryonic development, and involved in deciding the fate of cells (i.e., which tissue they need to migrate to). Hedgehog proteins are also involved in the transcription of genes that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. Cholesterol is important to this pathway because it undergoes covalent bonding to Hedgehog proteins, resulting in their activation. Without cholesterol, the signaling activity is disrupted and cell differentiation may be impaired. Cholesterol is a precursor for many important molecules. These include bile acids (important in processing dietary fats), oxysterols, neurosteroids (involved in neurotransmission and excitation), glucocorticoids (involved in immune and inflammatory processes), mineralocorticoids (osmotic balance), and sex steroids (i.e. estrogen and testosterone; wide range of function but involved in genital development prenatally). Finally, cholesterol is a major component of myelin, a protective layer around neurons. Myelination occurs most rapidly during prenatal development, meaning that the demand for cholesterol biosynthesis is very high. Pathogenesis Given that the function of cholesterol encompasses a very wide range, it is unlikely that the symptoms of SLOS are due to a single molecular mechanism. Some of the molecular effects are yet unknown, but could be extrapolated based on the role of cholesterol. In general, the negative effects are due to decreased levels of cholesterol and increased levels of cholesterol precursors-most notably, 7DHC. Although 7DHC is structurally similar to cholesterol, and could potentially act as a substitute, the effects of this are still being studied. Most patients with SLOS present decreased cholesterol levels, particularly in the brain (where cholesterol levels rely primarily on new synthesis). This also means that any sterol derivatives of cholesterol would also have reduced concentrations. For example, reduced levels of neurosteroids may be seen in SLOS. These are lipids which take part in signaling within the brain, and must be produced within the brain itself. They are responsible for interacting with nuclear steroid receptors, and bind to neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. Specifically, they modulate the effects of GABA and NMDA receptors, resulting in calming effects, improved memory, and more. Thus, given that some characteristics of SLOS are the opposite of these effects (hyperactivity, anxiety), a reduction in neurosteroids could influence both neurological development and behaviour. Pathogenesis of Smith-Lemli-Optiz syndrome. Furthermore, as outlined above, cholesterol is an important aspect in Hedgehog signaling. With lower levels of cholesterol, hedgehog proteins would not undergo the necessary covalent modification and subsequent activation. This would result in impaired embryonic development, and may contribute to the observed physical birth defects in SLOS. One particular hedgehog signaling protein, sonic hedgehog (SHH), is important in the pattern of the central nervous system, facial features, and limbs. Other hedghehog proteins may be involved in the development of the genital tract and the skeleon. The altered sterol levels in SLOS are particularly relevant to cell membranes, which are made primarily of lipids. SLOS patients may show cell membranes with abnormal properties or composition, and reduced cholesterol levels greatly affect the stability and proteins of lipid rafts. Despite their structural similarity, 7DHC is unable so replace cholesterol in lipid rafts. In addition, a lack of cholesterol contributes to the increased fluidity of the cell membrane, and may cause abnormal granule secretions. All of these changes in the membrane likely contribute to changes in transport functions that are observed in SLOS. They may cause defects in IgE receptor-mediated mast cell degranulation and cytokine production, which are cells involved in allergic and immune responses. The NMDA receptor is affected, as well as the binding capability of the hippocampal serotonin receptor. Cell to cell interaction, which is very important in development, may be impaired. Exocytosis in synaptic vesicles has been shown to be reduced, likely due to impaired vesicle fusion to the cell membrane, or poor vesicle recycling. Finally, cholesterol is highly prevalent in myelin, therefore SLOS patients show reduced myelination of the cerebral hemispheres, peripheral nerves, and cranial nerves. In addition to lowered levels of cholesterol, many of the symptoms shown in SLOS stem from the toxic effects of 7DHC. 7DHC is known to impair intracellular cholesterol transport. It also increases the degradation of HMG-CoA reductase (the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis). 7DHC leads to novel oxysterol and steroid derivatives, and many of their functions or effects are yet unknown. A very important finding with respect to 7DHC is that it is the most reactive lipid for lipid peroxidation, and results in systemic oxidative stress. Lipid peroxidation is known to destroy membranes of both cells and membrane-bound organelles. The derivative of 7DHC that is used to indicate oxidative stress is 3Œ≤,5Œ±-dihydroxy-cholest-7-en-6-one (DHCEO); it is formed from a primary product of 7DHC peroxidation, 7-DHC-5Œ±,6Œ±-epoxide. DHCEO is toxic to cortical neuronal and glial cells, and accelerates their differentiation and arborization. Through oxidative stress, 7DHC is thought to be responsible for the increased photosensitivity shown in SLOS patients. Normal UVA exposure may lead to oxidative stress in skin cells. Given that 7DHC is more readily oxidized, it enhances the effects of UVA, leading to increased membrane lipid oxidation and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Typically, more altered the levels of 7DHC and cholesterol lead to more severe symptoms of SLOS. The levels of these metabolites also correspond to the severity of the mutation (nonsense versus missense); some mutations of DHCR7 may still show residual cholesterol synthesis, and others may not. However, even individuals with the same mutations or genotype may still show variability in their symptoms. This may be due to maternal factors, such as the transfer of cholesterol to the fetus during pregnancy, as well as the amount of cholesterol present in the brain before the blood‚Äìbrain barrier forms prenatally. The rate of accumulation and excretion of toxic metabolites may vary from person to person. Maternal apolipoprotein E has also been implicated in individual variability in SLOS, although the exact nature of this relationship is unknown. There are likely more factors contributing to the wide spectrum of effects in SLOS which have not yet been discovered. Screening and diagnosis =Prenatally= The most characteristic biochemical indicator of SLOS is an increased concentration of 7DHC (reduced cholesterol levels are also typical, but appear in other disorders as well). Thus, prenatally, SLOS is diagnosed upon finding an elevated 7DHC:total sterol ratio in fetal tissues, or increased levels of 7DHC in amniotic fluid. The 7DHC:total sterol ratio can be measured at 11‚Äì12 weeks of gestation by chorionic villus sampling, and elevated 7DHC in amniotic fluid can be measured by 13 weeks. Furthermore, if parental mutations are known, DNA testing of amniotic fluid or chorionic villus samples may be performed. Micrograph showing chorionic vili, the tissue that is collected with chorionic villus sampling and used to test for SLOS. Amniocentesis (process of sampling amniotic fluid) and chorionic villus sampling cannot be performed until approximately 3 months into the pregnancy. Given that SLOS is a very severe syndrome, parents may want to choose to terminate their pregnancy if their fetus is affected. Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling leave very little time to make this decision (abortions become more difficult as the pregnancy advances), and can also pose severe risks to the mother and baby. Thus, there is a very large desire for noninvasive midgestation diagnostic tests. Examining the concentrations of sterols in maternal urine is one potential way to identify SLOS prenatally. During pregnancy, the fetus is solely responsible for synthesizing the cholesterol needed to produce estriol. A fetus with SLOS cannot produce cholesterol, and may use 7DHC or 8DHC as precursors for estriol instead. This creates 7- or 8-dehydrosteroids (such as 7-dehydroestriol), which may show up in the maternal urine. These are novel metabolites due to the presence of a normally reduced double bond at carbon 7 (caused by the inactivity of DHCR7), and may be used as indicators of SLOS. Other cholesterol derivatives which possess a double bond at the 7th or 8th position and are present in maternal urine may also be indicators of SLOS. 7- and 8-dehydropregnanetriols have been shown to be present in the urine of mothers with an affected fetus but not with an unaffected fetus, and thus are used in diagnosis. These pregnadienes originated in the fetus and traveled through the placenta before reaching the mother. Their excretion indicates that neither the placenta nor the maternal organs have necessary enzymes needed to reduce the double bond of these novel metabolites. =Postnatally= If SLOS goes undetected until after birth, diagnosis may be based on the characteristic physical features as well as finding increased plasma levels of 7DHC. There are many different ways of detecting 7DHC levels in blood plasma, one way is using the Liebermann‚ÄìBurchard (LB) reagent. This is a simple colorimetric assay developed with the intention of use for large scale screening. When treated with the LB reagent, SLOS samples turn pink immediately and gradually become blue; normal blood samples are initially colorless and develop a faint blue color. Although this method has limitations and is not used to give a definitive diagnosis, it has appeal in that it is a much faster method than using cell cultures. Another way of detecting 7DHC is through gas chromatography, a technique used to separate and analyze compounds. Selected ion monitoring gas chromatography/mass-spectrometry (SIM- GC/MS) is a very sensitive version of gas chromatography, and permits detection of even mild cases of SLOS. Other methods include time-of-flight mass spectrometry, particle-beam LC/MS, electrospray tandem MS, and ultraviolet absorbance, all of which may be used on either blood samples, amniotic fluid, or chorionic villus. Measuring levels of bile acids in patients urine, or studying DCHR7 activity in tissue culture are also common postnatal diagnostic techniques. Treatment Management of individuals with SLOS is complex and often requires a team of specialists. Some of the congenital malformations (cleft palate) can be corrected with surgery. Other treatments have yet to be proven successful in randomized studies, however anecdotally they appear to cause improvements. =Cholesterol supplementation= Currently, the most common form of treatment for SLOS involves dietary cholesterol supplementation. Anecdotal reports indicate that this has some benefits; it may result in increased growth, lower irritability, improved sociability, less self-injurious behaviour, less tactile defensiveness, fewer infections, more muscle tone, less photosensitivity and fewer autistic behaviours. Cholesterol supplementation begins at a dose of 40‚Äì50 mg/kg/day, increasing as needed. It is administered either through consuming foods high in cholesterol (eggs, cream, liver), or as purified food grade cholesterol. Younger children and infants may require tube feeding. However, dietary cholesterol does not reduce the levels of 7DHC, cannot cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, and does not appear to improve developmental outcomes. One empirical study found that cholesterol supplementation did not improve developmental delay, regardless of the age at which it began. This is likely because most developmental delays stem from malformations of the brain, which dietary cholesterol cannot ameliorate due to its inability to cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Simvastatin is an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase and has been used to treat SLOS. =Simvastatin therapy= HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been examined as treatment for SLOS. Given that this catalyzes the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis, inhibiting it would reduce the buildup of toxic metabolites such as 7DHC. Simvastatin is a known inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, and most importantly is able to cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. It has been reported to decrease the levels of 7DHC, as well as increase the levels of cholesterol. The increased cholesterol levels are due to simvastatin's effect on the expression of different genes. Simvastatin increases the expression of DHCR7, likely leading to increased activity of DHCR7. It has also been shown to increase the expression of other genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and uptake. However, these benefits are dependent on the amount of residual cholesterol synthesis. Because some individuals possess less severe mutations and demonstrate some amount of DCHR7 activity, these people benefit the most from simvastatin therapy as they still have a partially functioning enzyme. For individuals that show no residual DCHR7 activity, such as those homozygous for null alleles or mutations, simvastatin therapy may actually be toxic. This highlights the importance of identifying the specific genotype of the SLOS patient before administering treatment. It is still unknown if simvastatin will improve the behavioural or learning deficits in SLOS. =Antioxidant supplementation= Antioxidants are those which inhibit the oxidation of molecules or reduce metabolites that were previously oxidized. Given that some symptoms of SLOS are thought to result from the peroxidation of 7DHC and its derivatives, inhibiting this peroxidation would likely have beneficial effects. Antioxidants have been shown to increase the level of lipid transcripts in SLOS cells, these transcripts play a role in lipid (cholesterol) biosynthesis and are known to be down-regulated in SLOS. Furthermore, vitamin E specifically is known to decrease DHCEO levels, which is an indicator of oxidative stress in SLOS, as well as present beneficial changes in gene expression. Vitamin E appears to be the most powerful antioxidant for treating SLOS, and in mouse models has reduced the levels of oxysterols in the brain. However, antioxidants have only been studied in animal models of SLOS or isolated SLOS cells. Thus, their clinical significance and negative side effects are still unknown, and their use has yet to be studied in humans. =Further considerations= When treating SLOS, a recurring issue is whether or not the intellectual and behavioural deficits are due to fixed developmental problems (i.e. fixed brain malformations), or due to ongoing abnormal sterol levels that interrupt the normal function of the brain and other tissues. If the latter is true, then treatments which change the sterol levels and ratios, particularly in the brain, will likely improve the developmental outcome of the patient. However, if the former is true, then treatment is likely to help only with symptoms and not with specific developmental deficits. Research The most common animal used to study SLOS is the mouse. According to BioCyc, cholesterol biosynthesis in mice is very similar to that of humans. Most importantly, mice possess both DHCR7 (the enzyme responsible for SLOS), and HMG-CoA reductase (the rate limiting step of cholesterol synthesis. Rats are similar to mice and have also been used. There are two popular ways in which animal models of SLOS are created. The first is using teratogens, the second is using genetic manipulations to create mutations in the DHCR7 gene. =Teratogenic models= Teratogenic models are induced by feeding pregnant rats or mice inhibitors of DCHR7. Two common inhibitors are BM15766 (4-(2-[1-(4-chlorocinnamyl)piperazin-4-yl]ethyl)-benzoic acid) and AY9944 (trans-l,4-bis(2-chlorobenzylaminomethy1)cyclohexane dihydrochloride). These compounds have different chemical and physical properties, but induce similar effects. AY9944 has been shown to induce holoprosencephaly and sexual malformations similar to those seen in humans with SLOS. It is also known to cause impairments in the serotonin receptor, another defect commonly seen in SLOS patients. BM15766 has produced the lack of cholesterol and bile acid synthesis that is seen in SLOS patients with homozygous mutations. All teratogenic models can be effectively used to study SLOS; however, they present lower levels of 7-DHC and 8-DHC than are seen in humans. This can be explained by the fact that humans experience a permanent block in their DHCR7 activity, where mice and rats treated with inhibitors experience only transient blocks. Furthermore, different species of mice and rats are more resistant to teratogens, and may be less effective as models of SLOS. Teratogenic models are most commonly used to study more long-term effects of SLOS, because they survive longer than genetic models. For example, one study examined the retinal degeneration of SLOS, which in rats does not occur until at least one month after birth. =Genetic models= Genetic models of SLOS are created by knocking out the DHCR7 gene. One study used homologous recombination to disrupt DCHR7 in mouse embryonic stem cells. Similar to what is found in humans, heterozygous mice (having only one mutated allele) were phentoypically normal, and were crossed to produce pups (young mice) homozygous for the mutated allele. Although these pups died within the first day of life due to their inability to feed, they showed characteristics similar to humans with SLOS. They had decreased levels of cholesterol, increased levels of 7- and 8DHC, showed less growth and smaller birth weights, had craniofacial malformations, and less movement. Many also had a cleft palate, and decreased neuronal responses to glutamate. Overall however, the pups had fewer dysmorphic features than human patients with SLOS; they did not present limb, renal, adrenal or central nervous system malformations. This is explained by the fact that in rodents, maternal cholesterol can cross the placenta, and actually appears to be essential for the development of the fetus. In humans, very little maternal cholesterol is transferred to the fetus. In sum, the genetic mouse model is helpful to explain the neuropathophysiology of SLOS. =Discoveries= Many discoveries in SLOS research have been made using animal models. They have been used to study different treatment techniques, including the effectiveness of simvastatin therapy. Other studies have examined behavioural characteristics while attempting to explain their underlying pathogenesis. A common finding is that mouse models of SLOS show abnormal serotonergic development, which may be at least partially responsible for the autistic behaviours seen in SLOS. Mouse models have also been used to develop diagnostic techniques; multiple studies have examined biomarkers that result from the oxidation of 7DHC, such as DHCEO. It is likely that as animal models are improved, they will lead to many more discoveries in SLOS research.

The unusually small size of the warhead is apparent. The W54 was one of the smallest nuclear warheads deployed by the United States. It was a very compact implosion-type nuclear weapon design, designed for tactical use and had a very low yield for a nuclear weapon, in the range of 10 to 1,000 tons TNT equivalent. Its original use was in the Davy Crockett short-range rocket, but it was later adapted as a man-portable Special Atomic Demolition Munition (SADM), and later as the basis of nuclear- tipped air-to-air missiles. A later development was the W72, which were rebuilt W54s used with the AGM-62 Walleye guided bomb. The W72 was in service until 1979.  Development  thumbA 1958 test of the XW-54 warhead yielded 6 kilotonsSocorro (22 October 1958 13:30 PST) The W54 was designed by Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory and built by the United States Atomic Energy Commission. Around 400 units were manufactured from 1961 until early 1962 and were deployed until at least 1971. = Preproduction testing = The earliest identified nuclear tests of devices corresponding to the W54 characteristics were the Pascal-A and Pascal-B test detonations in 1957, in the Operation Plumbbob nuclear test series. These were both intended to have very low yield, but overshot to higher yields (tens and hundreds of tons of TNT). These were followed by tests of the XW-51 design, which evolved into the XW-54 in the Operation Hardtack I test series in 1958 (Hardtack Quince and Hardtack Fig). These were both described as fizzles, or test failures. A number of XW-51/XW-54 tests followed in the 1958 Operation Hardtack II test series, including Hardtack II Otero, Bernalillo, Luna, Mora, Colfax, Lea, Hamilton, Dona Ana, San Juan, Socorro, Catron, De Baca, Chavez, Humboldt, and Santa Fe. By this time, the XW-51 / XW-54 design had been test-fired more times than any preceding US nuclear weapon prior to its successful introduction in service, indicating the difficulty of successfully making this small and low-yield design work reliably and safely. Further testing followed in the 1961 Operation Nougat test series, probably including Nougat Shrew, Boomer, Ringtail, and possibly others. By this time the W-54 design was performing consistently as expected at low yields.  Variants  There were four distinct models of the basic W54 design used, each with different yield, but the same basic design. These were: * Mk-54 (Davy Crockett) ‚Äì 10 or 20 tons yield, Davy Crockett artillery warhead * B54 (SADM) ‚Äì approximate yield from 10 tons to 1 kiloton, Special Atomic Demolition Munition device * W-54 ‚Äì 250-ton yield, warhead for AIM-26 Falcon air-to-air missile * W72 ‚Äì 600-ton yield, rebuilt W-54 (Falcon warhead) for AGM-62 Walleye  Specifications  All four variants share the same basic core: a nuclear system which is diameter, about long, and weighs around or slightly over .Data from 1st Battalion, 33rd Armor: https://web.archive.org/web/20161009113302/http://www.1-33rdar.org/M388.jpg  Known and theoretical uses  The W54 would have fit into the Special Atomic Demolition Munition (\\"Backpack Nuke\\") casings These small-size devices were first intended for use by United States Army ground soldiers in battle and were in theory small enough to be delivered by a bazooka-style firing mechanism. Early known versions could destroy a two-block area, with an estimated yield comparable to approximately 10 tons TNT equivalent. Larger versions were later developed with a selectable yield of between 10 and 250 tons. The yield of 10 tons TNT equivalent was just below the largest yield for any conventional bomb built until the 1950s, T-12 Cloudmaker (designed in 1944), at a mass of close to 20 metric tons yielding a blast of 11 tons TNT equivalent. The W54 is small enough to be deployed as a SADM (Special Atomic Demolition Munition), or so-called \\"Backpack Nuke\\". It was the closest thing the U.S. is known to have developed to a so-called \\"suitcase bomb\\". The W54 style warhead was known to be used on the M-388 Davy Crockett, a tactical nuclear recoilless rifle projectile that was deployed by the United States in 1961 and decommissioned in 1971. The W54 was tested for use in a U.S. Navy SEAL project that was demonstrated as feasible in the mid-to-late 1960s, designed to attack a harbor or other strategic location that could be accessed from the sea. The SEAL version would be delivered into water by parachute along with a two-man team, then floated to the target, set in place and armed by hand. The United States Air Force also developed a project using the W54, the Hughes Electronics AIM-26 Falcon. This was a larger, more powerful version of the AIM-4 Falcon air-to-air missile. It is notable for being the only known production U.S. guided air-to-air weapon with a nuclear warhead. It was intended to destroy formations of Soviet bombers at a time when guided missiles were not accurate enough to produce high-probability kills with small conventional warheads. = W72 = After the AIM-26 Falcon was retired, 300 units were rebuilt into an improved configuration with a higher yield and redesignated the W72. These warheads were then used to produce a number of nuclear versions of the AGM-62 Walleye television-guided glide bomb system. The W72 variant had a yield of around 600 tons of TNT. The 300 W72 units were produced between 1970 and 1972 and were in service until 1979.  Documented testing  Stockpiled W54 warheads were test-fired at the Nevada Test Site on July 7 and July 17, 1962. In Little Feller II (July 7), the warhead was suspended 3 feet above the ground and had a yield equivalent to 22 tons of TNT. In Little Feller I (July 17), the warhead was launched as a Davy Crockett device from a stationary 155-millimeter launcher and set to detonate between 20 and 40 feet above the ground around 1.7 miles from the launch point, with a yield of 18 tons. This test was the last atmospheric test at Nevada Test Site and was performed in conjunction with Operation Ivy Flats, a simulated military environment. It was observed by Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and presidential adviser General Maxwell D. Taylor. Ivy Flats Film ReportDeclassified U.S. Nuclear Test Film #32 was declassified by the United States Department of Energy on December 22, 1997. Limited operational details of early SADM projects were published prior to this declassification.

The magazine had always moved with the times. As co-founder George wrote in an editorial statement in Asiaweek's first issue in December 1975: \\"Realities have changed, and so the values.

Closure George, who left Asiaweek before its troubles began, laments the death of the magazine after O'Neill was removed. With Asiaweek's demise, George said, his only regret was the way \\"the magazine was devalued by the very people who took it upon themselves to nurture it. That is why I shed no tears now as the concept itself was killed in 1994 when Mike was removed by the new management. Its closure [in 2001] is a mere burial.\\" According to Time, the reason for the closure was due to an advertising slump. Executives at Time insist their decisions were based on economic, not editorial, considerations. The New York Times columnist Thomas Crampton writes, \\"Asiaweek and the Far Eastern Economic Review were the only weekly magazines with a strong Asia focus through the 1980s. But competition grew in the 1990s when global and local media companies expanded into regional editions. In addition to several small regionally financed magazines, The Economist, Fortune, BusinessWeek and Forbes all began aggressive expansions into Asia. These global titles could rely on skeletal staffs and economies of scale.\\"Thomas Crampton, The New York Times , 1 December 2001 According to Crampton, besides the \\"brutal competition for limited advertising revenue\\", another plausible reason for the shakeout was \\"the suffocating embrace of U.S.-based media giants with an American-centric perspective.\\" For Asiaweek's founding editor, Time Warner's closure of the 26-year-old publication plays into Asian fears of a U.S.-centric world media. \\"The mandarins of Manhattan fully know Asia's potential,\\" said T. J. S. George, who is now an editorial consultant for the New Indian Express Group. \\"They want a total monopoly for Time magazine.\\" American involvement 'Asia through Asian eyes' was the slogan that helped Asiaweek rise. George is still nostalgic about the fresh and fearless style of the magazine during its heyday and is wary of American meddling in Asian affairs.

George, \\"Hail the all-American world!\\", 4 October 2009 But Singapore-based Alejandro Reyes, long-time correspondent and contributing editor of Asiaweek, insists that the magazine retained its strongly Asian voice independent of whatever the bosses in New York might have wanted. He says the magazine's demise was due to the \\"failure of a pan-Asian marketing strategy impeded by limited resources and intense competition\\" and is hopeful of the revival of a niche market for media with an Asian perspective despite globalization trends. Reyes, who was educated in the United States, initially applauded the modern, business-oriented techniques and practices of AOL Time Warner. He was not too happy when he found out that Time deleted all Asiaweek articles from its online archives, including his. \\"This is all very tragic,\\" says Reyes, \\"‚Äì misguided decisions by New York- centric media bureaucrats whose careers are probably soon to be deleted just as ruthlessly.\\"Mainstream media: killing the past May 2009 M.G.G.

It was used almost exclusively as a baseball park for over 60 years. However, since the Rowdies moved to the facility in 2011, it has been reconfigured to better host soccer. Al Lang Stadium was built in 1947 at the site of an older facility known as St. Petersburg Athletic Park. It is named in honor of Al Lang, a former mayor of St. Petersburg who was instrumental in bringing minor league and spring training baseball to the city in the early 20th century. The ballpark was reconstructed in 1976 and was extensively renovated before the Tampa Bay Devil Rays began using it as their first spring training venue in 1998. The Rays were the last of a long series of Major League Baseball clubs to conduct spring training and host an affiliated minor league team at Al Lang Stadium and St. Petersburg's previous ballparks. Before the Rays, tenants included the New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, New York Mets, and the Baltimore Orioles. The stadium hosted its last spring training game in March 2008 and hosted amateur and exhibition baseball for the next several years. The Tampa Bay Rowdies became the primary tenant in 2011, and Al Lang Stadium was incrementally modified into a soccer venue over each of the following off-seasons. Since October 2014, an agreement between the club and the city of St. Petersburg has made the stadium a soccer-only facility, and the Rowdies' ownership conducted an extensive renovation in early 2015. In 2016, Rowdies' majority owner Bill Edwards proposed expanding the stadium's capacity to 18,000 seats as part of a bid to move the club into Major League Soccer (MLS). In May 2017, a local referendum passed authorizing the city of St. Petersburg to negotiate a long-term lease with the team to make the project possible. In October 2018, the Rowdies were purchased by the Tampa Bay Rays, which gave the baseball club control of Al Lang Stadium through the transfer of the existing lease with the city of St. Petersburg. History =Background= Professional baseball grew throughout the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century, and clubs sought additional facilities to accommodate their spring training. Al Lang, a businessman in St. Petersburg, saw a huge potential to attract northeastern teams to his city to take advantage of the warm weather during the early months of the year. Lang and city officials created an incentives package that covered teams' travel expenses and other amenities, which drew in the city's first spring training tenant, the St. Louis Browns, in 1914. The club trained at Coffee Pot Park, a small ballpark located beside Coffee Pot bayou about a mile north of the current site of Al Lang Stadium. Subsequently, other Major League Baseball clubs such as the Philadelphia Phillies and the New York Yankees came to St. Petersburg for spring training, and Lang continued promoting the city when he was elected Mayor of St. Petersburg in 1916. After his term, Lang devoted his life to building a successful connection between Florida and baseball, and was instrumental in marketing St. Petersburg as a desirable sports site.Fountain, Charles (2009) Under the March Sun: The Story of Spring Training. New York: Oxford University Press, pages 23-32. With Al Lang's support, the city replaced Coffee Pot Park with St. Petersburg Athletic Park (also known as Waterfront Park) on the present site of Al Lang Stadium in 1923. It served as the spring training home for Major League Baseball teams the Boston Braves and the New York Yankees until after World War II, hosting baseball greats such as Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, and Stan Musial. The grandstand at Al Lang Stadium =Current stadium= In 1947, the city of St. Petersburg demolished Waterfront Park and constructed a modern baseball park on the same site. It was named Al Lang Stadium in honor of his many years of service to the city and his continual promotion of baseball in the area. The St. Louis Cardinals and New York Yankees shared the new ballpark in its first spring training season. The stadium underwent a major reconstruction in 1976, expanding its capacity to 7,227.Moncada, Carlos (August 28, 2006. S\\"t. Petersburg Considering Life Without Al Lang Field\\" The Tampa Tribune. Retrieved May 13, 2014. It was renovated again in 1996; the project cost $640,117 and included disability accommodations.Chick, Bob (March 1, 1996) \\"Al Lang enjoys being pampered after 20 years\\". The Tampa Tribune. Accessed May 13, 2014. When the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays began using the park for spring training in 1998, local utility Florida Power purchased the park's naming rights for $150,000 per year, and the city rechristened it Florida Power Park at Al Lang Field. When Florida Power was acquired by Progress Energy in 2003, the stadium's name was changed to Progress Energy Park. The naming rights agreement expired in 2011, and the facility's name reverted to Al Lang Stadium. Description Al Lang Stadium's grandstand faces the southeast, giving almost every seat a view of the St. Petersburg harbor and Tampa Bay beyond the left field wall. The stadium is constructed primarily of reinforced concrete, and the public portions of the facility include very few enclosed and air conditioned areas. A unique concrete cantilevered overhang shades many of the grandstand seats from the afternoon sun, and the stadium's waterfront location is often cooled by a sea breeze. During the 2015 renovation, the Rowdies replaced all of the seats in the grandstand, refreshed fan areas under the grandstand, and extensively updated many of the club and gameday operation areas. In addition, a portion of the outfield wall was removed and two banks of uncovered bleachers installed in its place, adding several hundred seats on the sideline of the soccer pitch opposite the grandstand. Tenants and events Baseball at the stadium - last pitch of the final spring game on March 28, 2008 =Baseball= Al Lang Stadium was originally designed and built for baseball, and it has hosted many thousands of major league spring training, minor league, college, high school, international. and exhibition baseball games over the decades. Professional baseball Al Lang Stadium was originally built as a spring training and minor league venue and served that purpose from 1947 until 2008. Spring training tenants included the New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, New York Giants, New York Mets, and Baltimore Orioles. Minor league tenants included the St. Petersburg Saints of the Florida International League and the St. Petersburg Cardinals of the Florida State League. Al Lang Stadium's final minor league tenant was the Class A St. Petersburg Devil Rays, who last played at the stadium in 2000. In 1998, the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays began using the stadium for spring training. Their regular season home at Tropicana Field is approximately one mile west, making the Devil Rays the first major league team to train and play regular season games in the same city in almost 90 years. In 2006, the Rays, seeking to expand their fan base across the Tampa Bay area, decided to move their spring training operations to Charlotte Sports Park in Port Charlotte, about 80 miles south of St. Petersburg. They played their last spring training ballgame at Al Lang Stadium on March 28, 2008. Amateur baseball Baseball in the Tampa Bay area has a long history, and amateur baseball has long been played in Al Lang Stadium and its predecessors in downtown St. Petersburg. Many different tournament, exhibition, practice, and regular season games have been held there, with the University of South Florida St. Petersburg club baseball program the last amateur team to call Al Lang Stadium home during their inaugural season of 2014. The 1997 and 2002 Atlantic Coast Conference Baseball Tournaments were played at the venue, as was the 2000 Conference USA Baseball Tournament. From 2010 to 2014, Al Lang Stadium hosted the St. Petersburg International Baseball Series, which involved international teams, national teams, and local college and high school teams along with minor league squads from various major league organizations that were already in the area for spring training. The event moved to other local venues in 2015. After the Tampa Bay Rowdies moved to Al Lang Stadium in 2011, the playing surface and seating arrangement had to be constantly alternated between baseball and soccer configurations, especially in the spring. The resulting poor condition of the turf led to complaints by Rowdies management and, in October 2014, an agreement that baseball would not be played at the facility. =Soccer= In 2011, the soccer team FC Tampa Bay of the North American Soccer League announced it would move to Al Lang Stadium from George M. Steinbrenner Field in Tampa. This ended three years in which the stadium had no long-term tenant. Al Lang Stadium subsequently underwent minor renovations to convert it into a soccer facility, with temporary seats added on the grass along the sidelines to increase capacity. The team played its first game at Al Lang on April 9, 2011, and later changed its name to the Tampa Bay Rowdies, after the historical team that had played from 1975 to 1993. On October 27, 2012, the Tampa Bay Rowdies became the 2012 NASL Champions by winning the two-leg Soccer Bowl against the Minnesota Stars at Al Lang Stadium. It was the first time that a major championship was held at the site. In 2013, the Rowdies signed a lease extension keeping the team at Al Lang Stadium through the 2016 season. In 2014, Rowdies majority owner Bill Edwards publicly complained that the city of St. Petersburg and the St. Petersburg Baseball Commission, which managed Al Lang Stadium, had not kept up with maintenance on the grandstand, the locker rooms, or the playing field. This was partially due to the fact that although the Rowdies have been the only regular tenant of Al Lang Stadium since 2011, it was regularly used for exhibition and amateur baseball during the spring, necessitating that the playing surface be converted for soccer use by removing the pitcher's mound and replacing the infield dirt with grass. The dispute resulted in the Rowdies filing a lawsuit against the St. Petersburg Baseball Commission in July 2014 claiming that the commission was not properly maintaining the \\"dilapidated\\" facility. Transfer of stadium management The issues were finally resolved in October 2014 when Edwards and the city of St. Petersburg brokered a deal that gave Edwards' Big 3 Entertainment company management control of Al Lang Stadium for the next four years. As part of the arrangement, the facility would no longer be used for baseball events, and Edwards agreed to complete $1.5 million in renovations as he sought to make Al Lang Stadium more soccer friendly. =Other sports= Section of the race course at Al Lang Stadium Part of the circuit for the Grand Prix of St. Petersburg curves through the parking lot of Al Lang Stadium. Lacrosse On January 29, 2013 Major League Lacrosse announced that the 2012 MLL champions the Rochester Rattlers would face the Chesapeake Bayhawks for their season opener at Al Lang stadium. It would be the first time that the league would play there. Part of this game is an effort to evaluate the Tampa Bay Area, and the state of Florida in general, for an expansion team, after MLL held the All-Star game at FIU Stadium the previous year. It was supported by the St. Petersburg/Clearwater Sports Commission who want to affirm the city's brand as a world-class destination for sports tourism. The game was played on Saturday, April 27, 2013 in front of 3,940 people (a figure higher than half the league's average attendance), with Chesapeake winning, 17‚Äì14.The FAU site would eventually become the home of the Florida Launch in 2014 until their eventual demise before the start of the 2019 season. When the original 2019 schedule was released in November 2018, they were expected to move to Central Broward Regional Park in Lauderhill, due to the later season dates overlapping with the Florida Atlantic Owls football season.Launch release schedule, new home venue  Rugby  In 2015, Al Lang Stadium hosted the Halloween Rugby 7s, a rugby sevens tournament featuring eight teams: USA Falcons, USA Hawks, Canada, Argentina, Denver, New York City, Ohio and Utah. Future =Proposed Rays ballpark= In 2006, the Tampa Bay Rays announced plans to move their spring training home to Port Charlotte, about 80 minutes south of St. Petersburg, for the 2009 season. In November 2007, Rays President Matt Silverman introduced a plan to build a $450 million new Rays Ballpark at the Al Lang Stadium site that was to be ready for the 2012 baseball season. The plan failed to garner enough political support to move forward, and it was shelved in June 2008. Subsequently, the Rays began looking at other potential locations, and in May 2009, they announced that they would not seek to build a new facility in downtown St. Petersburg. =Soccer specific replacement= In 2013, the city of St. Petersburg began the process of creating a master plan for the waterfront area that includes Al Lang Stadium. Some of the proposals suggest replacing the entire stadium and surrounding parking areas with a soccer park complex with a new soccer-specific stadium. Rowdies owner Bill Edwards has stated that \\"in a perfect world\\", Al Lang Stadium would be replaced by an 18,000-seat publicly financed soccer stadium. In March 2016, St. Petersburg mayor Rick Kriseman announced plans to hold a public referendum on extending the Rowdies' lease at Al Lang Stadium and to use tax dollars to help the club transform the facility into a \\"city showpiece\\". However, these plans were shelved in May 2016, possibly because it became known that Orlando City SC, the closest Major League Soccer (MLS) franchise, has territorial rights for the Tampa/St. Petersburg market, clouding the prospects for potentially bringing the Rowdies to MLS and delaying the need for a larger venue. In December 2016, the Tampa Bay Rowdies launched another proposal entitled \\"#MLS2StPete\\" to join Major League Soccer as an expansion team. With the announcement, plans were released for an expansion and renovation of Al Lang Stadium to accommodate an 18,000-seat capacity financed by private funding. A May 2017 referendum authorized the city of St. Petersburg to negotiate a 25-year lease with the club if MLS picks the Rowdies as an expansion team.

(2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw- Hill. . Two forms of citrullinemia have been described, both having different signs and symptoms, and are caused by mutations in different genes. Citrullinemia belongs to a class of genetic diseases called urea cycle disorders. The urea cycle is a sequence of chemical reactions taking place in the liver. These reactions process excess nitrogen, generated when protein is used for energy by the body, to make urea, which is excreted by the kidneys. Signs and symptoms Diagnosis =Type I= Type I citrullinemia (, also known as classic citrullinemia) usually becomes evident in the first few days of life. Affected infants typically appear normal at birth, but as ammonia builds up in the body, they develop a lack of energy (lethargy), poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, and loss of consciousness. These medical problems can be life-threatening in many cases. A milder form of type I citrullinemia is less common in childhood or adulthood. Some people with gene mutations that cause type I citrullinemia never experience signs and symptoms of the disorder. Investigation for diagnosis of citrullinemia type l elevated citrulline . Type I citrullinemia is the most common form of the disorder, affecting about one in 57,000 births worldwide. Mutations in the ASS gene cause type I citrullinemia. The enzyme made by this gene, argininosuccinate synthetase (), is responsible for one step of the urea cycle. Mutations in the ASS gene reduce the activity of the enzyme, which disrupts the urea cycle and prevents the body from processing nitrogen effectively. Excess nitrogen, in the form of ammonia, and other byproducts of the urea cycle, accumulate in the bloodstream, leading to the characteristic features of type I citrullinemia. =Type II= The symptoms of type II citrullinemia ( and ) usually appear during adulthood and mainly affect the central nervous system. Characteristic features include confusion, abnormal behaviors (such as aggression, irritability, and hyperactivity), seizures, and coma. Specific investigation like decrease citrulline level , increase ammonium ion . These symptoms can be life-threatening, and are known to be triggered by certain medications, infections, and alcohol intake in people with this type. Type II citrullinemia may also develop in people who had a liver disorder called neonatal cholestasis during infancy. This condition blocks the flow of bile and prevents the body from processing certain nutrients properly. In many cases, the symptoms resolve within a year. Years or even decades later, however, some of these people develop the characteristic features of adult type II citrullinemia. Type II citrullinemia is primarily found in the Japanese population, where it occurs in an estimated one in 100,000 to 230,000 individuals. Type II has also been reported in people from East Asian and Middle Eastern populations. Mutations in the SLC25A13 gene are responsible for type II citrullinemia. This gene makes a protein called citrin, which normally shuttles certain molecules in and out of mitochondria. These molecules are essential for the urea cycle and are also involved in making proteins and nucleotides. Mutations in SLC25A13 typically prevent the production of any functional citrin, which inhibits the urea cycle and disrupts the production of proteins and nucleotides. The resulting buildup of ammonia and other toxic substances leads to the symptoms of type II citrullinemia. Researchers have found many infants with neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis have the same mutations in the SLC25A13 gene as adults with type II citrullinemia. Treatment There are multiple treatment methods. Low protein diets, are intended to minimize production of ammonia. Arginine, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate help to remove ammonia from the blood. Dialysis may be used to remove ammonia from the blood when it reaches critical levels. In some cases, liver transplant has been successful.Yazaki M et al.

In the Einstein model, however, each atom oscillates independently. Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics.  Historical impact  The original theory proposed by Einstein in 1907 has great historical relevance. The heat capacity of solids as predicted by the empirical Dulong‚ÄìPetit law was required by classical mechanics, the specific heat of solids should be independent of temperature. But experiments at low temperatures showed that the heat capacity changes, going to zero at absolute zero. As the temperature goes up, the specific heat goes up until it approaches the Dulong and Petit prediction at high temperature. By employing Planck's quantization assumption, Einstein's theory accounted for the observed experimental trend for the first time. Together with the photoelectric effect, this became one of the most important pieces of evidence for the need of quantization. Einstein used the levels of the quantum mechanical oscillator many years before the advent of modern quantum mechanics. Derivation of the heat capacity For a thermodynamic approach, the heat capacity can be derived using different statistical ensembles. All solutions are equivalent at the thermodynamic limit. = In the microcanonical ensemble = 300px The heat capacity of an object at constant volume V is defined through the internal energy U as :C_V = \\\\left({\\\\partial U\\\\over\\\\partial T}\\\\right)_V. T, the temperature of the system, can be found from the entropy :{1\\\\over T} = {\\\\partial S\\\\over\\\\partial U}. To find the entropy consider a solid made of N atoms, each of which has 3 degrees of freedom. So there are 3N quantum harmonic oscillators (hereafter SHOs for \\"Simple Harmonic Oscillators\\"). :N^{\\\\prime} = 3N Possible energies of an SHO are given by :E_n = \\\\hbar\\\\omega\\\\left(n+{1\\\\over2}\\\\right) or, in other words, the energy levels are evenly spaced and one can define a quantum of energy : \\\\varepsilon = \\\\hbar\\\\omega which is the smallest and only amount by which the energy of an SHO is increased. Next, we must compute the multiplicity of the system. That is, compute the number of ways to distribute q quanta of energy among N^{\\\\prime} SHOs. This task becomes simpler if one thinks of distributing q pebbles over N^{\\\\prime} boxes ::File:Einstein solids 1.svg or separating stacks of pebbles with N^{\\\\prime}-1 partitions ::File:Einstein solids 2.svg or arranging q pebbles and N^{\\\\prime}-1 partitions :::File:Einstein solids 3.svg The last picture is the most telling. The number of arrangements of n objects is n!. So the number of possible arrangements of q pebbles and N^{\\\\prime}-1 partitions is \\\\left(q+N^{\\\\prime}-1\\\\right)!. However, if partition #3 and partition #5 trade places, no one would notice. The same argument goes for quanta. To obtain the number of possible distinguishable arrangements one has to divide the total number of arrangements by the number of indistinguishable arrangements. There are q! identical quanta arrangements, and (N^{\\\\prime}-1)! identical partition arrangements. Therefore, multiplicity of the system is given by :\\\\Omega = {\\\\left(q+N^{\\\\prime}-1\\\\right)!\\\\over q! (N^{\\\\prime}-1)!} which, as mentioned before, is the number of ways to deposit q quanta of energy into N^{\\\\prime} oscillators. Entropy of the system has the form :S/k = \\\\ln\\\\Omega = \\\\ln{\\\\left(q+N^{\\\\prime}-1\\\\right)!\\\\over q! (N^{\\\\prime}-1)!}. N^{\\\\prime} is a huge number--subtracting one from it has no overall effect whatsoever: :S/k \\\\approx \\\\ln{\\\\left(q+N^{\\\\prime}\\\\right)!\\\\over q! N^{\\\\prime}!} With the help of Stirling's approximation, entropy can be simplified: :S/k \\\\approx \\\\left(q+N^{\\\\prime}\\\\right)\\\\ln\\\\left(q+N^{\\\\prime}\\\\right)-N^{\\\\prime}\\\\ln N^{\\\\prime}-q\\\\ln q. Total energy of the solid is given by :U = {N^{\\\\prime}\\\\varepsilon\\\\over2} + q\\\\varepsilon, since there are q energy quanta in total in the system in addition to the ground state energy of each oscillator. Some authors, such as Schroeder, omit this ground state energy in their definition of the total energy of an Einstein solid. We are now ready to compute the temperature :{1\\\\over T} = {\\\\partial S\\\\over\\\\partial U} = {\\\\partial S\\\\over\\\\partial q}{dq\\\\over dU} = {1\\\\over\\\\varepsilon}{\\\\partial S\\\\over\\\\partial q} = {k\\\\over\\\\varepsilon} \\\\ln\\\\left(1+N^{\\\\prime}/q\\\\right) Elimination of q between the two preceding formulas gives for U: :U = {N^{\\\\prime}\\\\varepsilon\\\\over2} + {N^{\\\\prime}\\\\varepsilon\\\\over e^{\\\\varepsilon/kT}-1}. The first term is associated with zero point energy and does not contribute to specific heat. It will therefore be lost in the next step. Differentiating with respect to temperature to find C_V we obtain: :C_V = {\\\\partial U\\\\over\\\\partial T} = {N^{\\\\prime}\\\\varepsilon^2\\\\over k T^2}{e^{\\\\varepsilon/kT}\\\\over \\\\left(e^{\\\\varepsilon/kT}-1\\\\right)^2} or > :C_V = 3Nk\\\\left({\\\\varepsilon\\\\over k T}\\\\right)^2{e^{\\\\varepsilon/kT}\\\\over > \\\\left(e^{\\\\varepsilon/kT}-1\\\\right)^2}. Although the Einstein model of the solid predicts the heat capacity accurately at high temperatures, and in this limit \\\\lim_{T\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}C_V =3Nk, which is equivalent to Dulong‚ÄìPetit law. Nevertheless, the heat capacity noticeably deviates from experimental values at low temperatures. See Debye model for how to calculate accurate low-temperature heat capacities. =In the canonical ensemble= Heat capacity is obtained through the use of the canonical partition function of a simple quantum harmonic oscillator. :Z = \\\\sum_{n = 0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-E_n/kT} where :E_n = \\\\varepsilon\\\\left(n+{1\\\\over2}\\\\right) substituting this into the partition function formula yields : \\\\begin{align} Z = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-\\\\varepsilon\\\\left(n+1/2\\\\right)/kT} = e^{-\\\\varepsilon/2kT} \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-n\\\\varepsilon/kT}=e^{-\\\\varepsilon/2kT} \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\left(e^{-\\\\varepsilon/kT}\\\\right)^n \\\\\\\\\\\\ = {e^{-\\\\varepsilon/2kT}\\\\over 1-e^{-\\\\varepsilon/kT}} = {1\\\\over e^{\\\\varepsilon/2kT}-e^{-\\\\varepsilon/2kT}} = {1\\\\over 2 \\\\sinh\\\\left({\\\\varepsilon\\\\over 2kT}\\\\right)}. \\\\end{align} This is the partition function of one harmonic oscillator. Because, statistically, heat capacity, energy, and entropy of the solid are equally distributed among its atoms, we can work with this partition function to obtain those quantities and then simply multiply them by N^{\\\\prime} to get the total. Next, let's compute the average energy of each oscillator :\\\\langle E\\\\rangle = U = -{1\\\\over Z}\\\\partial_{\\\\beta}Z where :\\\\beta = {1\\\\over kT}. Therefore, :U = -2 \\\\sinh\\\\left({\\\\varepsilon\\\\over 2kT}\\\\right){-\\\\cosh\\\\left({\\\\varepsilon\\\\over 2kT}\\\\right)\\\\over 2 \\\\sinh^2\\\\left({\\\\varepsilon\\\\over 2kT}\\\\right)}{\\\\varepsilon\\\\over2} = {\\\\varepsilon\\\\over2}\\\\coth\\\\left({\\\\varepsilon\\\\over 2kT}\\\\right). Heat capacity of one oscillator is then :c_V = {\\\\partial U\\\\over\\\\partial T} = -{\\\\varepsilon\\\\over2} {1\\\\over \\\\sinh^2\\\\left({\\\\varepsilon\\\\over 2kT}\\\\right)}\\\\left(-{\\\\varepsilon\\\\over 2kT^2}\\\\right) = k \\\\left({\\\\varepsilon\\\\over 2 k T}\\\\right)^2 {1\\\\over \\\\sinh^2\\\\left({\\\\varepsilon\\\\over 2kT}\\\\right)}. Up to now, we calculated the heat capacity of a unique degree of freedom, which has been modeled as a quantum harmonic. The heat capacity of the entire solid is then given by C_V = 3Nc_V, where the total number of degree of freedom of the solid is three (for the three directional degree of freedom) times N, the number of atoms in the solid. One thus obtains > :C_V = 3Nk\\\\left({\\\\varepsilon\\\\over 2 k T}\\\\right)^2 {1\\\\over > \\\\sinh^2\\\\left({\\\\varepsilon\\\\over 2kT}\\\\right)}. which is algebraically identical to the formula derived in the previous section. The quantity T_{\\\\rm E}=\\\\varepsilon / k has the dimensions of temperature and is a characteristic property of a crystal. It is known as the Einstein temperature. Hence, the Einstein crystal model predicts that the energy and heat capacities of a crystal are universal functions of the dimensionless ratio T / T_{\\\\rm E}. Similarly, the Debye model predicts a universal function of the ratio T/T_{\\\\rm D}, where T_{\\\\rm D} is the Debye temperature.  Limitations and succeeding model  In Einstein's model, the specific heat approaches zero exponentially fast at low temperatures. This is because all the oscillations have one common frequency. The correct behavior is found by quantizing the normal modes of the solid in the same way that Einstein suggested. Then the frequencies of the waves are not all the same, and the specific heat goes to zero as a T^3 power law, which matches experiment. This modification is called the Debye model, which appeared in 1912. When Walther Nernst learned of Einstein's 1906 paper on specific heat, he was so excited that he traveled all the way from Berlin to Z√ºrich to meet with him.

During its run it was drawn by Doug Jensen, Jim Watson and Jimmy Hansen. The story of the strip was of two shops. The first story told the story of how all of the shops in a terrace of shops closed up, one by one, leaving Bloggs & Son General Store, a popular small corner shop that seemingly sold anything and everything, owned by Mr. Bloggs, a kindly old man wearing the traditional white coat, and his son Ted. Mr. Superstore, a bowler-hatted long-nosed man one day walked into Bloggs' shop and promptly decided to build a new superstore on the site of the demolished shops. Each episode saw him try various nefarious methods to bring customers from the small shop to his store, but would inevitably come to a sticky end. One strip drawn by Jim Watson rewrote the origins. Mr. Superstore brought a coachload of people in from a block of flats to visit the store - and then he showed them a postcard showing a terrace of houses adjacent to Bloggs' shop, whereupon the shoppers revealed themselves as the original inhabitants of the houses before he had them demolished and attacked him with their handbags - the last frame saw them all in Bloggs' shop, catching up. Yet another saw Bloggs open 24 hours a day - and Mr. Bloggs introduced his twin brother in the last two frames, covering the night shift. Others saw Mr. Superstore trying to keep up with Mr. Bloggs changing displays in a matter of minutes, and failing dismally - Mr. Bloggs always had a display ready to go whatever the weather, together with whitewash to write on the windows. After Whizzer and Chips merged with Buster, the strip was continued in said comic, ending in March 1994. From 1997, after a reader request, the strip returned to Buster, but were reprints of earlier stories as opposed to new material. This continued until the comic's last issue at the beginning of 2000.

Strange things befall on the couple: the husband experiences nightmares of his ghastly wife mutilating herself, while the wife feels as if others do not acknowledge her existence. When she finally arrives at her residence, she discovers the full truth. The man had murdered his wife after an argument and cut her into pieces. Her remains are then stored in a black bag seen at certain points in the movie. The man experiences trauma after the incident, while the reason why others ignore the wife is because no one can see her. The man is then seen driving away from New Town with his wife's remains.

He is later burned alive inside his house with the spirits of his wife and son becoming witnesses. His rival, Master Tong, a tutor for traditional Thai dance connected to Hun lakhon lek (known as Khon) attempts to steal the puppets to raise his prestige.

He is informed about Yu, a neighbor across the complex, who lives with his paralyzed wife, Hai'er, and daughter. Yu's daughter creeps Cheung, but the two become friends and later play at a photo studio. However, Chan mistakenly believes that Yu has kidnapped Cheung and attempts to break into his apartment, only to get caught and rendered unconscious. Yu takes Chan hostage and reveals that his wife has died, yet he continues to talk to her as if she is alive. He promises to release him in three days, the time when his wife would \\"wake up\\" through the help of Chinese medicine, after which the two would go back to their Changsha home in the mainland. He also reveals that he never has a daughter, for she was aborted when his wife succumbed to liver cancer three years before. On the third day, Chan's fellow cops manage to arrest Yu. However, before he is taken away, he escapes and attempts to reach Hai'er, only to get killed when a car hits him. The doctor who treated Yu and Hai'er tell Chan the full truth about her patients as well as the fact that though Hai'er has died, she does indeed shows signs of life.

This disorder is classified as a multiple carboxylase deficiency, a group of disorders characterized by impaired activity of certain enzymes that depend on biotin. Symptoms are very similar to biotinidase deficiency and treatment ‚Äì large doses of biotin ‚Äì is also the same. Symptoms and signs Genetics Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Mutations in the HLCS gene cause holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency. The HLCS gene makes an enzyme, holocarboxylase synthetase, that attaches biotin to other molecules. Biotin, a B vitamin, is found in foods such as liver, egg yolks, and milk. It is essential for the normal production and breakdown of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates in the body. Mutations in the HLCS gene reduce the activity of holocarboxylase synthetase, preventing cells from using biotin effectively and disrupting many cellular functions. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. Diagnosis The signs and symptoms of holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency typically appear within the first few months of life, but the age of onset varies. Affected infants often have immunodeficiency diseases, difficulty feeding, breathing problems, a skin rash, hair loss (alopecia), and a lack of energy (lethargy). Immediate treatment and lifelong management (using biotin supplements) may prevent many of these complications. If left untreated, the disorder can lead to delayed development, seizures, and coma. These medical problems may be life- threatening in some cases.

It takes its name from a smouldering coal seam running underground through the sandstone. Burning Mountain is contained within the Burning Mountain Nature Reserve, which is administered by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS). A trail with information panels runs from the parking lots to the site where smoke emanates from the ground. The Leyland brothers reported on Mount Wingen in the first episode of their travel programme, Ask The Leyland Brothers: * \\"The Aborigines named the mountain Wingen, which means 'fire'. Their explanation of the origin of the burning mountain was that one day, a tribesman was lighting a fire on the mountainside when he was carried off deep into the earth by The Evil One. Unable to escape, he used his fire stick to set the mountain alight, so that the smoke might warn others to keep away.\\" Coal seam fire The underground fire is estimated to be at a depth of around . It is estimated that the fire has burned for approximately 6,000 years and is the oldest known coal fire. European explorers and settlers to the area believed the smoke, coming from the ground, was volcanic in origin. It was not until 1829 that geologist Reverend C. P. N. Wilton identified it as a coal seam fire. The fire is generally moving in a southerly direction at a rate of about per year. The combustion has caused soil discolouration and an uneven ground surface in the area.

It is a resident breeder in Costa Rica, Panama, Trinidad, Venezuela, Colombia, Guyana, Suriname and the extreme north of Brazil. There are also sight records from French Guiana. It is probably a close relative of the spotted tanager (I. punctata) which replaces it to the south. These two species are generally presumably to be fully allopatric, but may actually be parapatric: in 1998 a speckled tanager was found in the Serran√≠a de los Churumbelos (Colombia), just about north of where spotted tanagers are known to occur.Salaman et al. (2002) Adult speckled tanagers are long and weigh . The upperparts are green with black spotting, and the face is yellow with a black line from the eye to the gape. The wings and tail are black edged with green, and the underparts are white spotted with black. The sexes are similar. The speckled tanager's flight call is a weak metallic chirping tsip. The Trinidadian subspecies I. g. trinitatis has brighter and more extensive yellow on the head, and the black spotting is more conspicuous. Ixothraupis guttata is more of a subtropical species than its relative and occurs in humid montane and secondary forest, with generally not very tall trees and a dense understory. Speckled tanagers are social birds which eat mainly fruit and some insects. They are often seen with bay-headed tanagers and honeycreepers. The small cup nest is built in a tree and the normal clutch is two brown-blotched white eggs. The female incubates the eggs for 13 days to hatching, with another 15 days before the chicks fledge.

There is a broad range of styles, from bluegrass, to yodeling to folk to the more popular. The genre has been influenced by Celtic and English folk music, the Australian bush ballad tradition, as well as by popular American country music. Themes include: outback life, the lives of stockmen, truckers and outlaws, songs of romance and of political protest; and songs about the \\"beauty and the terror\\" of the Australian bush. Early pioneers included Tex Morton, Smoky Dawson (touted as Australia's first singing cowboy), Buddy Williams, Slim Dusty and Johnny Ashcroft all members of the Australian Roll of Renown.  Australian Country Stars  Notable musicians include: Adam Brand, Adam Harvey, Jasmine Rae, Troy Cassar-Daley, Davidson Brothers, Slim Dusty, Steve Forde, Joy McKean, Jean Stafford, Olivia Newton-John, John Williamson, Chad Morgan, Keith Urban, O'SHEA, Lee Kernaghan, and Kasey Chambers. Others influenced by the genre include Paul Kelly and Tex Perkins. Popular songs include When the Rain Tumbles Down in July (1946), Waltzing Matilda (1895), Pub With No Beer (1957), Lights on the Hill (1973), I Honestly Love You (1974), True Blue (1981), Boys From the Bush (1992), and Not Pretty Enough (2002). Early country star Johnny Ashcroft Overview A 1905 collection of old bush songs compiled by Banjo Paterson. Australian country music is heavily influenced by American country music, but grew also out of an Australian tradition of Bush ballads and poetry. Country singer Smoky Dawson, and faithful friend Flash the Horse Australia has a long tradition of country music, which has developed a style quite distinct from its US counterpart, influenced by English, Irish and Scottish folk ballads and by the traditions of Australian bush balladeers like Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson. Country instruments, including the guitar, banjo, fiddle and harmonica create the distinctive sound of country music in Australia and accompany songs with strong storyline and memorable chorus and lyrics. The style of Australian country music evolved under the influence of rock and roll forms. While some subject matter may be constant, musical styles differ between traditional and contemporary bush ballads. Exemplars of the traditional bush ballad style include Slim Dusty's \\"When the Rain Tumbles Down in July\\" or \\"Leave Him in the Long yard\\" which have strong narrative in verses plus choruses set to a Pick n' Strum beat. Contemporary bush ballads may employ finger picking and strumming rock styles as in Lee Kernaghan's later version of Leave Him in the Longyard, or in Keith Urban reworking of the Slim Dusty/Joy McKean classic \\"Lights on the Hill\\". =Early bush music= The distinctive themes and origins of Australia's bush music can be traced to the songs sung by the convicts who were sent to Australia during the early period of the British colonisation, beginning in 1788. Early Australian ballads sing of the harsh ways of life of the epoch and of such people and events as bushrangers, swagmen, drovers, stockmen and shearers. Convict and bushranger verses often railed against government tyranny. Classic bush songs on such themes include: The Wild Colonial Boy, Click Go The Shears, The Eumeralla Shore, The Drover's Dream, The Queensland Drover, The Dying Stockman and Moreton Bay. Later themes which endure to the present include the experiences of war, of droughts and flooding rains, of Aboriginality and of the railways and trucking routes which link Australia's vast distances. Isolation and loneliness of life in the Australian bush has been another theme. For much of its history, Australia's bush music belonged to an oral and folkloric tradition, and was only later published in print in volumes such as Banjo Paterson's Old Bush Songs, in the 1890s. Waltzing Matilda, often regarded as Australia's unofficial National Anthem, is a quintessential early Australian country song, influenced more by Celtic folk ballads than by American Country and Western music. The lyrics were composed by the poet Banjo Paterson in 1895. This strain of Australian country music, with lyrics focusing on strictly Australian subjects, is generally known as \\"bush music\\" or \\"bush band music\\". Country and folk artists such as Gary Shearston, Lionel Long, Margaret Roadknight, Tex Morton, Slim Dusty, Rolf Harris, The Bushwackers, John Williamson, and John Schumann of the band Redgum have continued to record and popularise the old bush ballads of Australia through the 20th and into the 21st century - and contemporary artists including Pat Drummond, Sara Storer and Lee Kernaghan draw heavily on this heritage. =Development of modern country= Country singer Reg Lindsay and Joan Clarke on the Hour of Song radio program, 2UW Radio Theatre, Sydney in 1954. Pioneers of a more Americanised popular country music in Australia included Tex Morton (known as The Father of Australian Country Music) in the 1930s and other early stars like Buddy Williams, Shirley Thoms and Smoky Dawson. In 1932, Tex Morton arrived from New Zealand, aged 16, and humped his swag around outback stations where he began to earn a name as a performer. In 1936 he cut his first commercial records in Australia. He went on to establish a distinctly Australian bush ballad style, shifting from American songs to songs about Australia. He attained national popularity in the 1930s and formed a traveling \\"Rodeo and Wildwest Show\\" in the 1940s. In 1949 he travelled to North America and Europe enjoying great success as a stage hypnotist, working in film and with artists such as Hank Williams. He returned to Australia in the early 1960s, by which time a generation of performers had carved a place for the Australian themed country music he pioneered. Olivia Newton-John received the Country Music Association's Top Female Vocalist award in the US in 1974. Chad Morgan, the \\"clown prince\\" of Australian country music. Morgan has been performing since the 1950s. His works are peppered with colourful Australian vernacular. Smoky Dawson cut his first recording in 1941: \\"I‚Äôm a Happy Go Lucky Cowhand\\". In 1952, Dawson began a radio show, and went on to national stardom as a yodelling, whip cracking, knife throwing, singing cowboy of radio, TV and film. Known as \\"Canada's Yodelling Cowboy\\", Donn Reynolds (1921-1997) began a 40-year international career upon cutting several popular sides in 1947 on the Regal Zonophone label including \\"Old Bush Shanty of Mine\\" and \\"Stockman's Lullaby\\". He toured with Willard (Bill) Ferrier's Famous Hillbillies in what was Sydney's first all-country format variety showsEric Watson, Country Music in Australia (Rodeo Publications, 1975) p.111-120 and became the voice of Australia's iconic Peters Ice Cream as the \\"Peter's Singing Cowboy\\". Reynolds achieved notoriety through song and screen performances worldwide, and later established 2 world records for yodeling. Slim Dusty (AM) (1927‚Äì2003) was known as the \\"King of Australian Country Music\\", and helped to popularise the Australian bush ballad. His successful career spanned almost six decades and his 1957 hit \\"A Pub With No Beer\\" was the biggest-selling record by an Australian to that time, the first Australian single to go gold, and the first and only 78 rpm record to be awarded a gold disc. Dusty remains Australia's most successful and prolific performer, and won more Gold and Platinum albums than any other Australian artist. Dusty recorded and released his one-hundredth album in the year 2000 and was given the honour of singing Waltzing Matilda in the closing ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. Dusty was accorded a state funeral upon his death and with over 7 million Australian record sales he remains Australia's most successful domestic music artist.Dave\\" Laing, \\"Slim Dusty: Country singer famous for A Pub With No Beer\\", The Guardian (UK), 20 September 2003 Slim Dusty's wife Joy McKean, (OAM) penned several of his most popular songs including \\"Indian Pacific\\", \\"The Biggest Disappointment\\" and ‚ÄúLights on the Hill‚Äù. Their daughter Anne Kirkpatrick is also a successful singer-songwriter. The family began annual round Australia tours in 1964 - encompassing a 30,000-mile, 10-month journey which was the subject of a feature film, The Slim Dusty Movie in 1984. Although himself an accomplished writer of songs, Dusty had a number of other songwriters including Mack Cormack, Gordon Parsons, Stan Coster and Kelly Dixon who were typically short on formal education but big on personal experience of the Australian bush. Coster wrote popular Dusty bush ballads including \\"The Cunamulla Fella\\" and \\"Three Rivers Hotel\\" based on his own experience of working as a sheep hand and railway construction worker. Drawing on his travels and such writers over a span of decades, Dusty almost inadvertently chronicled the story of a rapidly changing post-war Australian nation. Nevertheless, the arrival of rock and roll music saw major metropolitan music radio stations abandon support for country artists like Dusty and despite record sales in the multi millions, he and other successful Australian country artists were rarely heard on air outside regional centres in Australia until the new cross-over pop-country styles of the 1990s began to be heard again on city airwaves. In 1951, country singer-songwriter Reg Lindsay, (OAM), began broadcasting on Sydney radio and remained on air for 12 years. In 1964 he took over Channel 9's \\"The Country & Western Hour\\", which was networked around Australia and ran for seven and a half years. Soon after the show was replaced with \\"Reg Lindsay's Country Homestead\\" from Brisbane. The show gave hundreds of young artists a boost and helped to boost the Australian country music industry. Another enduring talent of Australian country music has been Chad Morgan, who began recording in the 1950s and is known for his vaudeville style of comic Australian country and western songs, his prominent teeth and goofy stage persona. In reference to his first recording he is known as The Sheik of Scrubby Creek. Johnny Ashcroft (OAM) had an early country-rock chart success in Australia and New Zealand while Frank Ifield achieved considerable success in the early 1960s, especially in the UK Singles Charts. Reg Lindsay was one of the first Australians to perform at Nashville's Grand Ole Opry in 1974. His international hit Armstrong, a tribute to the historic 1969 moon landing by American astronaut Neil Armstrong is now included in a time capsule at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.Country music star Reg Lindsay dies, The Sydney Morning Herald, 6 August 2008. Ted Egan (AM) began recording in 1969 and has released 28 albums, mostly themed around outback life, history and Aboriginal affairs. Eric Bogle's 1972 folk lament to the Gallipoli campaign \\"And The Band Played Waltzing Matilda\\" recalled the Celtic origins of Australian folk-country. Statue of \\"The Cunnamulla Fella\\" erected as a tribute to songwriter, Stan Coster and singer, Slim Dusty. Singer-songwriter John Williamson, (OAM) began to build his reputation as an iconic Australian entertainer with his 1970 performance of his first song \\"Old Man Emu\\" on New Faces (influenced by novelty works of Rolf Harris such as Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport). It was the first of many popular songs employing Australian slang. In 1982 he released \\"True Blue\\" and subsequent works including Mallee Boy, the lyrical \\"Galleries of Pink Galahs\\" and reworkings of Australian bush ballads and folk songs earned him a permanent position as leading exponent of Australian country and folk music. In 1970, Tamworth's Radio 2TM organised the landmark Bicentennial Concert to mark the 200th anniversary of the voyage of Captain James Cook along the coast of Eastern Australia. The pioneers of Australian country music Slim Dusty, Joy McKean, Barry Thornton, \\"Smiling\\" Billy Blinkhorn, Smoky Dawson, Shirley Thoms and Buddy Bishop all featured in the concert which contributed to a revival of interest in Australian country music which had struggled for airplay since the arrival of rock and roll in Australia. The Tamworth Country Music Festival began in 1973 and now attracts up to a 100,000 visitors annually. In 1974, a popular cross-over artist Olivia Newton-John, (MBE), (OAM), received the Country Music Association's Top Female Vocalist award in the US, despite protest from American country purists. Her popular hits have included I Honestly Love You and Tenterfield Saddler by Australian singer-songwriter Peter Allen as well as country classics such as \\"Banks of the Ohio\\" and \\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\\". =Contemporary= Country singer, Melinda Schneider with folk-rocker Paul Kelly. In 1992, The Country Music Association of Australia was launched in Tamworth, New South Wales to encourage, develop and promote Australian Country Music. Slim Dusty was its first Chairman, John Williamson its Vice Chairman, Joy McKean was Treasurer, Max Ellis Secretary and Phil Matthews Public Officer. After negotiations, Tamworth's Radio 2TM agreed to hand over responsibility for the Golden Guitar Awards to the new body. Kasey Chambers. Lee Kernaghan. Keith Urban. In recent years, country music has consolidated its position as a popular genre in Australia, with well attended festivals and a large number of top-selling albums and songs. By the 1990s, Country music had attained cross-over success in the pop charts with artists like James Blundell, James Reyne singing \\"Way Out West\\", and country star Kasey Chambers winning the ARIA Award for Best Female Artist in 2000, 2002 and 2003 and becoming the youngest artist to ever be inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. Alternative country star Chambers is the daughter of steel guitarist Bill Chambers. Her hits include \\"Not Pretty Enough\\" (2002), \\"True Colours\\" (2003) and \\"Pony\\" (2004) which all peaked in Australia's Top Ten. The cross-over influence of Australian country is also evident in the music of successful contemporary bands The Waifs and The John Butler Trio. Singer- songwriter Paul Kelly whose music style straddles folk, rock, and country is often described as the poet laureate of Australian music. Eclectic rocker Nick Cave has been heavily influenced by the American country music artist Johnny Cash. Cave has recorded a number of country covers including several on his 1986 album Kicking Against the Pricks, which has such American country classics as \\"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\\", \\"Long Black Veil\\" and \\"The Singer\\" (a.k.a. \\"The Folksinger\\"). In 2000, Cash, covered Cave's \\"The Mercy Seat\\" on the album American III: Solitary Man. Subsequently, Cave cut a duet with Cash on a version of Hank Williams' \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\" for Cash's American IV: The Man Comes Around album (2002). Country music has been particularly popular among the Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Dougie Young and Jimmy Little were pioneers and Troy Cassar- Daley is among Australia's successful contemporary Indigenous performers. Aboriginal artists Kev Carmody and Archie Roach employ a combination of folk- rock and country music to sing about Aboriginal rights issues. The documentary, book and soundtrack Buried Country showcases significant Indigenous musicians from the 1940s to the 1990s. Popular and emerging contemporary performers of Australian country include: Lee Kernaghan (whose hits include the contemporary country classic \\"Boys From the Bush\\") and sister Tania Kernaghan, Melinda Schneider, Gina Jeffreys, Beccy Cole, Felicity Urquhart, Shannon Noll, Tracy Coster, Sara Storer, and brother Doug Storer. Sara Storer's award-winning second album Beautiful Circle prompted Melbourne's The Age newspaper to report that \\"As we lament the death of Slim Dusty, here is evidence that authentic, yet contemporary Australian bush country has not died with his passing\\". Her Australian accent, song subject matter and collaborations with established balladeers John Williamson and Paul Kelly link her to the oldest traditions of Australian country music. In the United States, Australian country music stars including Sherri√© Austin and Keith Urban have attained great success. In 1991, Urban released a self-titled debut album and charted four singles in Australia before moving to the United States in 1992 going on to chart more than fifteen singles on the U.S. country charts, including ten Number Ones. Urban has proven extremely successful internationally and has won the Country Music Association Award for Male Vocalist of the Year three times and their top Entertainer of the Year honour twice. Awards and festivals Archie Roach (right) with Ruby Hunter at the 2009 Tamworth Country Music Festival. The Tamworth Country Music Festival is an annual country music festival held in Tamworth, New South Wales (Country music capital of Australia). It celebrates the culture and heritage of Australian country music. During the festival the Country Music Association of Australia holds the Country Music Awards of Australia ceremony awarding the Golden Guitar trophies. Another important Country festival, the Gympie Muster began in near Gympie, Queensland in 1982. The non-profit community-based festival raises funds for charity and attracts around 25,000 fans to listen to stars and new talents alike. As well as mainstream Australian country the event showcases the breadth of contemporary Australian country: from folk and bush poetry, to alternative country. Indigenous country music is in evidence at the Deadly Awards, a celebration of Indigenous musicians and their music. The Mildura Country Music Festival celebrates the Australian Independent Country Music Awards every October. Other significant country music festivals include the Whittlesea Country Music Festival held north of Melbourne in February, Boyup Brook Country Music Festival held in Western Australian in February, Bamera Country Music Festival held in South Australia in June, the National Country Muster held in Gympie during August and the Canberra Country Music Festival held in the national capital during November.

He is the CEO of Gund Investment Corporation. He is the former co-owner of the San Jose Sharks (National Hockey League) and former principal owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers (National Basketball Association) and is currently a minority owner of the Cavaliers. Gund lost his sight to retinitis pigmentosa and was a co-founder of Foundation Fighting Blindness. Personal life A native of Cleveland, Ohio, Gund is a member of one of the city's prominent families. His father George Gund II was president and chairman of Cleveland Trust when it was Ohio's largest bank. Gund II was famous for hiding his wealth from his family and hiding his philanthropy. His sister, Agnes is a well known philanthropist in her own right. Gordon Gund and his wife, Llura, reside in Princeton, New Jersey; they have two children. Gund has also owned a large home on the north shore of Nantucket since 1978. Career Gordon Gund attended Harvard University, where he majored in physical sciences and sociology and played ice hockey. He served in the United States Navy, becoming department head on two destroyers. He then started a banking career, specializing in corporate finance. He gradually began going blind in the 1960s due to retinitis pigmentosa. By 1970, Gund was totally blind. In 1971, Gund co-founded the Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation (now known as The Foundation Fighting Blindness) which supports research to find cures and treatments for retinal degenerative diseases. The blindness did not prevent him from being active in business and philanthropy. Gund is the former President of the Board of Trustees of his alma mater, Groton School in Groton, Massachusetts. He has honorary doctorates from Gothenburg University in Sweden, University of Maryland, Baltimore, Whittier College and the University of Vermont. He formerly served as director of the Kellogg Company of Battle Creek, Michigan, and of Corning Incorporated in Corning, New York. Gund is chairman emeritus and a director of the board of directors of The Foundation Fighting Blindness. =Sports ownership= ;California Golden Seals and Cleveland Barons Gund's brother, George, held a minority interest in the California Golden Seals of the NHL. The Seals had never been able to find success either on the ice or at the box office, and after plans for a proposed new arena in San Francisco were cancelled in 1976, he convinced majority owner Mel Swig to relocate the franchise from Oakland to the Gunds' hometown in June of that year. Renamed the Barons after the popular former American Hockey League team, they played at The Coliseum in Richfield, which had been vacated by the Cleveland Crusaders of the World Hockey Association when they moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota to become the second incarnation of the Minnesota Fighting Saints. The Barons only drew 10,000 or more fans in seven out of their 40 home games. They were also troubled by an unfavorable lease with the Coliseum. In January 1977, Swig hinted the team might not finish the season because of payroll difficulties. The Barons actually missed payroll twice in a row in February, and only a $1.3 million loan allowed the Barons to finish the season. They finished last in the Adams Division, and Swig sold his interest in the team to the Gunds. The Gunds poured money into the team, and it seemed to make a difference at first. The Barons stunned the defending Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens on November 23 before a boisterous crowd of 12,859. After a brief slump, general manager Harry Howell pulled off several trades in an attempt to make the team tougher. It initially paid off, and the Barons knocked off three of the NHL's top teams, the Toronto Maple Leafs, New York Islanders and Buffalo Sabres in consecutive games in January 1978. A few weeks later, a record crowd of 13,110 saw the Barons tie the Philadelphia Flyers 2‚Äì2. The bottom fell out in February, however, as a 15-game losing skid knocked the Barons out of playoff contention. ;Minnesota North Stars At the end of the 1977‚Äì78 season, plans to buy the Coliseum outright fell through, and the Barons' small crowds and continuing struggles placed the franchise's viability in serious doubt. Meanwhile, the ownership of the Minnesota North Stars could no longer sustain the North Stars. Since Minnesota was perceived as the more desirable hockey market at the time, NHL President John Ziegler oversaw a merger between the two franchises, with the Gunds assuming ownership of the North Stars. Minnesota moved into Cleveland's position in the Adams Division. Within three seasons, the North Stars would make the 1981 Stanley Cup Finals, thanks to the Gunds' willingness to invest in the team and the addition of a number of talented players, including goaltender Gilles Meloche, from the Barons' roster After the NHL geographically realigned their divisions in 1981, placing the North Stars in the rough-and-tumble Norris Division, the Gunds would see attendance drop at the Metropolitan Sports Center while the team struggled on the ice. While there was a strong core of die-hard fans, the team often struggled to sell out its home games. ;San Jose Sharks By 1990, the Gunds had decided on a plan to relocate the franchise to the San Francisco Bay Area, the market they had vacated some 14 years earlier. Ziegler and the league refused to allow this move, but allowed the Gunds to sell the North Stars to Howard Baldwin and granted them an expansion team in the Bay Area, which became the San Jose Sharks, to start play in the 1991‚Äì92 season. With an expansion roster, the Sharks finished last in the NHL standings in their first two seasons, when they played out of the old Cow Palace, a facility the Seals and the NHL had rejected in 1967. With the opening of the San Jose Arena in 1993, however, the Gunds would be able to spend more on the team, and they made waves throughout the NHL with high-profile first-round upsets in the 1994 and 1995 playoffs. While the franchise could not maintain consistent success on the ice, they have enjoyed a high level of popularity, and their home arena is consistently one of the loudest in the NHL. In February 2002, the Gunds sold the Sharks to a consortium, named San Jose Sports & Entertainment Enterprises (SJSE). Gordon sold his share outright while George retained an ownership share as one of the partners in SJSE. ;Cleveland Cavaliers The Gunds bought the Cleveland Cavaliers from Ted Stepien in 1983 for $20 million, in order to keep the team in Cleveland and at Richfield Coliseum, which the Gunds owned. Stepien had threatened to move the team to Toronto. The Gunds replaced the team's logo and uniform design, replacing the \\"swashbuckling swordsman\\" with the team's nickname of 'Cavs' with a stylized 'V' made of a net and basketball. Under the Gunds' ownership, attendance figures started to rise, and the Cavaliers enjoyed a period of competitiveness on the basketball court. In the 1994‚Äì1995 season, Gund Arena was built and replaced the Coliseum, and attendance figures stayed high. According to the Cavaliers' media guide, the Cavs had the highest attendance figures in franchise history in 15 of the last 16 seasons, heading into the 2004‚Äì2005 season. His most notable achievement in the final years of his ownership was drafting high school prodigy and Akron, Ohio native LeBron James with the first-overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft, a move which helped rejuvenate interest among the fan base. In 2005, Gund sold controlling interest of the team to Quicken Loans founder and billionaire Dan Gilbert, maintaining a minority ownership stake for himself. Gund has an NBA Championship to his credit via his status as minority owner of the team during the 2015-2016 title winning season. ;Gund Arena Gund Arena (since renamed Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse) became a cornerstone of the redevelopment of downtown Cleveland, which was also bolstered by Jacobs Field (since renamed Progressive Field), the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the new Cleveland Browns Stadium (since renamed FirstEnergy Stadium). The Gunds would also operate one of the founding franchises of the WNBA, the Cleveland Rockers. They would also bring hockey to Gund Arena, in a revived version of the Cleveland Barons, who were the top minor-league affiliate of the Gunds' San Jose Sharks when the International Hockey League's Cleveland Lumberjacks folded. =Artist= Mostly working with briarwood, Gund sculpts small figures, mostly animals. These maquettes are then enlarged and cast in bronze. He also works in clay. Sculpture for Gund is a painstakingly slow process. It is not unusual for him to work on a single piece for a year or more. He is close friends with Ann Korologos, and exhibits in her art gallery, the Ann Korologos Gallery, in Basalt, Colorado.

Dr. Gerald MacDougal: Husband to Marcia MacDougal. A born-again Canadian exobiologist, Gerald was transported to the Multisystem along with the Earth. Dr. Marcia MacDougal: Wife to Gerald MacDougal. Born in Tycho Purple Penal, she was declared a refugee and escaped the Naked Purple lifestyle when the fire department burned her parents' house. A planetary engineer at VISOR, Marcia observed Earth's disappearance and later cracked Charonian communications via the Arecibo method. Dr. Hiram McGillicutty: The abrasive head physicist at VISOR. Notorious for his lack of couth when dealing with other people, he is brilliant and meticulous in gathering data, even if he tends to come to the wrong conclusions. Dr. Simon Raphael: Embittered by years of failed research into gravity manipulation, Raphael is the director of the Gravitics Research Station. He initially dismisses Larry Chao's test results as a fabrication in attempt to keep the station open, and attempts to shut down further research into the so-called Chao Effect. Following the apparent destruction of Earth, he opens the station's facilities to Larry in order to try to undo what he has done, and later comes to trust and support the young scientist in his actions. Dianne Steiger: Pilot of the cargo tug Pack Rat, Dianne is later appointed the captain of the Terra Nova following the Big Jump. Dr. Jane Webling: The aging Director of Science at the Gravitics Research Station. Coyote Westlake: A solo asteroid miner who is inadvertently transported to Mars when she lands on a Charonian G-point disguised as an asteroid. Locations =The Multisystem= The Multisystem is a huge artificial stellar system presided over by a Charonian Dyson Sphere where Earth was taken after the Big Jump. It is host to at least eight G-class stars and dozens of Earth-like planets, all stolen from their respective solar systems in the same manner as the Earth and carefully held in their orbits with artificial gravity. The planets are shepherded by a large number of Charonian COREs which destroy any potential threat to the life-bearing planets through direct physical impact, including human spacecraft. NaPurHab: The Naked Purple Habitat, owned and operated by the radical Naked Purple social movement, was brought along in the Big Jump and managed to survive the transition by orbiting around the Moonpoint black hole. Against their own philosophy, the residents of the habitat cooperated with the people of Earth, relaying messages through the Saint Anthony to the Solar System before the probe's final destruction by a CORE. Saint Anthony: A probe sent through the wormhole connecting the Solar System to the Multisystem, the Saint Anthony was used to relay messages and scientific data across the void of space prior to its destruction by a CORE. Terra Nova: Built by the United Nations and mothballed as a result of the K-crash, this ship was meant to explore another star system after a flight lasting for generations. Following the Big Jump, it was recommissioned with Dianne Steiger as the captain and Gerald MacDougal as the chief science officer. The Directorate of Spatial Investigation, formulated to investigate the cause and implications of the Big Jump, ordered the Terra Nova to investigate the Dyson Sphere, but soon after its launch it became apparent that this would be impossible due to the marauding COREs in the multisystem. Realizing that humanity had few spaceborne resources left after the Big Jump, the captain decided that the Terra Nova would not return to Earth, instead waiting a safe distance from the attack range of the COREs for the time that it would be of use to Earth. =The Solar System= The Belt Community: Being as the asteroid belt is ungovernably large, the Belt community consists of widely spread independent and corporate mining operations, with Ceres at its core as the primary trading post. Although conventional law enforcement throughout the belt is impossible, Ceres itself is governed under the just (if not heavy-handed) watch of the Autocrat. Once plagued by rock wars (vicious skirmishes which typically arose due to disputes over mining rights), the death penalty has been frequently employed to keep the population in check. Although the secrets of the Autocrat are closely guarded, the Belt Community has developed a device called the Core cracker, and quite seriously offered to blow up the planet Mercury both to create a second asteroid belt and assist VISOR in the terraforming of Venus. Gravitics Research Station: Control center for the Ring of Charon, the largest particle accelerator ever built. Slated to be mothballed by the UN following the K-crash after years of unsuccessful experimentation, a perfectly timed breakthrough by Larry Chao held off the shutdown of the facility. Located on Pluto, this was where human experiments in gravity control resulted in the accidental awakening of the Lunar Ring and the theft of Earth. The Ring was a crucial tool in the later study of Charonians and eventually to fight against them. Tycho Purple Penal: Once a UN-sanctioned prison colony buried under Tycho Crater on the moon, this converted penitentiary was declared a sovereign republic in order to release the UN of its responsibility to maintain it. Controlled by former inmates, the colony was taken under the influence of the radical Naked Purple social movement, and subsequently renamed Tycho Purple Penal. Standing restrictions on immigration forbade any resident from leaving the colony, but Marcia MacDougal was able to overcome this obstacle when she was declared a refugee following the burning of her parents' house. VISOR: Venus Initial Station for Operational Research, the human research facility built to study possible methods of terraforming the world. Following notification of Larry Chao's gravity experiment, all of the facility's instruments were focused on Earth at the time of the Big Jump. Observations made by several scientists on VISOR were later crucial to human attempts to understand and combat the Charonian invaders.

Salser was born in Emporia, Kansas, but grew up in Corvallis, Oregon after his father left his teaching assignment at Emporia State University to become Dean of Education at Oregon State University (OSU). Salser graduated from Corvallis High School in Oregon and later enrolled at Oregon State University. With the outbreak of World War II he served as a Navy Corpsman, stationed at the Naval Hospital in Corona, California before being ordered to the Pacific Theater of Operations where he participated in the Battle of Okinawa. Following the war Salser joined the Naval Reserve, from which he retired as a lieutenant commander. After the war, he graduated from Oregon State, where he also met his future wife, Barbara Anderson (1926-2000), of Lake Oswego, Oregon. They opened a men's clothing store and a restaurant that also served the training table for the OSU college football team, before joining McGraw-Hill Publishing and moving to Portland, Oregon. He received his master's degree from OSU in 1956. Also in the mid-1950s he became editor-in-chief for Allied Publishers of Portland, and in 1960 took over a college of business (then Pacific Business College, now known as Capstone English Mastery Center) before forming the 501(c)(3) nonprofit Educational Research Associates in 1965. The author or editor of more than 100 instructional titles, Salser authored two books on educational policy, A Tyrant in Cap and Gown, and Public Education from A to Z. He co-authored numerous titles in the use of the alphabetic shorthand system known as Personal Shorthand. Beginning in 1965 he led the development of the Individualized instruction system of school and classroom management. He was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the National Council on Educational Research (NCER) on 28 May 1982.http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1982/52882c.htm Confirmed by the United States Senate, he served two terms on the council. He spent almost his entire life in Oregon. A lifelong Republican, he was manager for U.S. Senator Mark Hatfield's successful 1956 campaign for Oregon Secretary of State. He twice campaigned for a position in the Oregon House of Representatives, losing once in the primary and once in the general election. He suffered a stroke in September 1991 and thereafter used a wheelchair. He died 11 April 2006. He was survived by three children, Mark Salser, Lori Fraser, and Linda Salser, and three grandchildren, Andrew Fraser, Alanna Fraser, and Matthew Salser. References 2\\\\.

His father, Tsang Kai-wing, was a former football coach and player, then served in the Royal Hong Kong Police Force from 1940 to 1972. He fled to Taiwan to escape from the Independent Commission Against Corruption in 1976 after being convicted of corruption and sentenced to three years in jail, while still free pending an appeal. In 2001, the Department of Justice seized his house in La Salle Road and later auctioned it for HK$4.35 million after 10 years of civil proceedings. Tsang Kai-wing died in Taiwan in 2011 with his son Eric and other family members around him.Tsang Kai-wing dies aged 94 after 35 years as corruption fugitive, SCMP, Danny Mok, 19 Jan 2011 Tsang is also a cousin of former Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Frederick Ma. In his youth, Tsang was a Hong Kong professional soccer player. Career Tsang began his showbusiness career as a stuntman. Due to his popularity, Tsang is often the master of ceremonies (MC) in events organised by the Hong Kong television network TVB, and he was nicknamed \\"Prize Master\\" (). He is known for being a short plump guy with a habit of speaking before thinking, often landing himself into hot water. His insults have led to him being assaulted by rumored triads over bad mouthing singer Joey Yung. As an MC in the Miss Chinese International Pageant, he often favours contestants in Hong Kong. Nevertheless, Tsang also appeared in many successful Hong Kong films, gaining actor awards and nominations. Early on in his career, he was typecast as a bumbling, ugly, and crude sidekick, and it was not until encouragement from his daughter Bowie Tsang to stop doing comedic roles that he went on to star in a film with friend Alan Tam and was awarded a Hong Kong best actor award. Perry Lam, a cinema critic from Muse, wrote that Tsang 'brings directness, straightness and a lack of nonsense to whatever role he plays, and occasionally demonstrates an uncanny ability to enter the egoless states of which only the greatest of character actors like Robert Duvall are capable.' He also was an occasional singer. Despite his high-pitched voice, he sings his parodies and theme songs to variety shows in a low-range tenor or high-range baritone of 2 octaves.[Eric Tsang singing Love of My Life with Alan Tam and Hacken Lee (dropped to D major key)] Personal life Tsang is a devout Buddhist, often leading other actors in efforts to raise money for Hong Kong Buddhist temples and events. Tsang's best friends are Natalis Chan and Alan Tam, who are also famous singers and actors from Hong Kong. Tsang has been close friends with Tam's family since childhood as their fathers were colleagues in the police force and played football together. Tsang was married two times. His first marriage was with Taiwanese actress Wang Mei Hua in 1972 and they had two daughters, Bowie Tsang and Tsang Wing Yee. Due to Tsang's sociable nature with spending more time with his friends and at work rather than at home, they divorced three years later in 1975. Wang brought their eldest daughter back to Taiwan, while their younger daughter moved to Canada. His second marriage was with Sung Lai Wah in 1989 and they had two sons, Derek Tsang, who is a famous international director who directed Better Days, and Mark Tsang. Sung and her two sons later immigrated to Toronto, Canada without him, who chose to stay in Hong Kong and they had been living in a long- distance relationship since then. =Sexual assault allegation= In December 2013, Next Magazine published an anonymously-produced interview with actress Yammie Lam where she said that she had been raped by two Hong Kong entertainment industry \\"big brothers\\" 20 years ago. According to Lam, one of the individuals had died not long ago, while the other individual is alive. She further claims that the second individual had raped her during a film production in Singapore. However, the names of the alleged perpetrators were censored out of the audio, which generated intense media speculation. It is not known who the interviewer was; in fact, the interviewer's voice shows evidence of having been digitally manipulated from a natural female voice to a male voice.JayneStars - Admitted Raped by entertainment \\"Big Brother\\" https://variety.com/2018/film/asia/hong-kong-eric-tsang-denies-rape- allegations-1202661112/ In January 2018, a mainland Chinese journalist uploaded what purported to be an uncensored recording of Yammie Lam's 2013 interview. In the new 2018 clip, the interviewer now has a natural female voice, and the formerly censored portions implicate Alan Tang (deceased in 2011) and Eric Tsang as the two alleged rapists of Lam. Media analysts have endorsed the authenticity of the newly released video; they note that the 2018 video did not have noise removal or other post-production traces that are observed in the publicly released 2013 clip; hence, whomever leaked the video must have had direct access to the original unedited video.BBC China, 2018 (traditional Chinese) Two days after the release of the January 2018 video, the sexual offense claim against Eric Tsang was corroborated by Grace Han, a talent agent who formerly headed the Ford Models agency in Asia. Han further alleged that Eric Tsang had sexually assaulted more than one woman, and claims to know of a specific incident in which a group of male Hong Kong celebrities, led by Tsang, allegedly drugged seven female models in a Hong Kong karaoke bar and raped six of them, while one girl escaped after she noticed the drugging.Sina China, 2018 (simplified Chinese)Variety, 2018 (English) Tsang rejected the authenticity of the uploaded video and did not address Grace Han's allegation. A week after the allegations surfaced, Tsang filed a defamation lawsuit against Grace Han in the Hong Kong High Court, arranged for a press event, and announced that \\"punishment\\" is needed. Tsang further claimed to the media that he had already won a defamation lawsuit in 2006 on similar grounds, but independent media sources have not been able to corroborate this claim.

It is a resident breeder from Trinidad, Tobago and eastern Venezuela south to Paraguay and northeastern Argentina. The bird's range in northern Brazil is the lower portion of the Amazon Basin and the adjacent Tocantins River drainage, with its northwestern limits from Brazil and the Guyanas, the eastern banks of the Orinoco River drainage in central Venezuela. It occurs in forests, second growth and plantations of cocoa and citrus fruit. The ball nest is built on a bank, tree stump or cavity and the normal clutch is four, sometimes three, red-blotched white eggs, which are incubated by the female. Adult violaceous euphonias are 11.4 cm long and weigh 14 g. The male has glossy blue-black upperparts and a deep golden yellow forehead and underparts. The female and immature are olive green above and greenish yellow below. These are social birds which eat mainly small fruit and only rarely take insects. The violaceous euphonia's song is a varied mix of musical notes, squeaks, chattering and imitation. Members of the genus Euphonia are prized as cage birds and several are threatened by trapping, but this species benefits from its relatively inaccessible habitat.

Following this, he attended the University of Tasmania, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with Honours in History in 1960, later gaining a Master of Arts in 1964.

He then took up an Australian Research Council post as a professorial fellow at the University of Tasmania in Launceston, and subsequently a post at the University's Riawunna Centre for Aboriginal Education.

Historical research In more than ten books and numerous academic articles Reynolds has explained the high level of violence and conflict involved in the colonisation of Australia, and the Aboriginal resistance to numerous massacres of indigenous people. Reynolds, and other historians, estimate that up to 3,000 Europeans and at least 20,000 Aboriginal Australians were killed directly in the frontier violence, and many more Aborigines died indirectly through the introduction of European diseases and starvation caused by being forced from their productive tribal lands. Geoffrey Blainey and Keith Windschuttle categorise his approach as a \\"black armband view\\" of Australian history. Reynolds has been quoted as responding to this claim as follows ‚Äì better a black armband than a white blindfold. His books are based on evidence available in archives and recorded during frontier times, and have been instrumental in overturning previously held views prevalent in the late 20th century that settlement was peaceful. He has also however shown that in earlier times ‚Äì pre 1900 ‚Äì white Australians were well aware of the violence against the Aborigines and believed they were a 'dying race'. In 2002, historian and journalist, Keith Windschuttle, in his book The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One: Van Diemen's Land 1803‚Äì1847, disputed whether the colonial settlers of Australia committed widespread genocide against indigenous Australians, especially focussing on the Black War in Tasmania, and denied the claims by historians such as Reynolds and Professor Lyndall Ryan that there was a campaign of guerrilla warfare against British settlement. He accused Reynolds of inventing evidence and making many claims without any documentary support at all. Subsequently, in Whitewash: on Keith Windschuttle's fabrication of Aboriginal history it was argued that Windschuttle failed to meet the criteria that he used to assess 'orthodox historians' and thus his accusations of deliberately and extensively misrepresenting, misquoting, exaggerating and fabricating evidence were flawed. Friendship with Eddie Mabo Reynolds struck up a friendship with Eddie Mabo, who was then a groundsman and gardener at James Cook University. In his book Why Weren't We Told?, Reynolds describes the talks they had regarding Mabo's people's rights to their lands, on Murray Island, in the Torres Strait. Reynolds writes: > Eddie [...] would often talk about his village and about his own land, which > he assured us would always be there when he returned because everyone knew > it belonged to his family. His face shone when he talked of his village and > his land. So intense and so obvious was his attachment to his land that I > began to worry about whether he had any idea at all about his legal > circumstances. [...] I said something like: \\"You know how you've been > telling us about your land and how everyone knows it's Mabo land? Don't you > realise that nobody actually owns land on Murray Island? It's all crown > land.\\" He was stunned. [...] How could the whitefellas question something so > obvious as his ownership of his land?Reynolds, Henry, Why Weren't We Told?, > 1999, , p. 188 Reynolds looked into the issue of indigenous land ownership in international law, and encouraged Mabo to take the matter to court. \\"It was there over the sandwiches and tea that the first step was taken which led to the Mabo judgement in June 1992.\\" Mabo then talked to lawyers, and Reynolds \\"had little to do with the case itself from that time\\",Reynolds, Henry, Why Weren't We Told?, 1999, p. 191 although he and Mabo remained friends until the latter's death in January 1992.

IOI is one of Malaysia's biggest conglomerates. It ventured into property development in 1984, followed by oil palm plantations and refineries in 1985. IOI was listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE)‚Äînow known as Bursa Malaysia‚Äîin 1980. The group was headed by Lee Shin Cheng, the executive chairman, until his death. Lee Yeow Chor is CEO. , IOI Group employed more than 30,000 persons from more than 25 countries. IOI Group's fiscal year runs from 1 July YYYY to 30 June of the following year. Core businesses =Palm oil plantations= Palm oil plantations are IOI's biggest income generator. As of 2015, about 67 percent of the conglomerate's profits came from its oil palm plantations. The group controls 230,000 hectares of oil palm plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia. It has 15 palm oil mills with a total milling capacity of 4.75 million tonnes of FFB (fresh fruit bunches) per year from its 90 estates throughout Malaysia and Indonesia. With oil yield of some six tonnes per hectare per year at its mature estates, IOI is the most efficient plantation company in the world. Malaysia's oil palm average yield for the last 20 years has been stagnant at four tonnes per hectare per year. Nestl√© stopped buying palm oil from IOI in 2012. Forbes 2012 #4 Lee Shin Cheng The United Nations Environment Programme says palm oil production is the leading cause of deforestation, which is occurring at a rate of about two per cent per year. Indonesia is also the world's third-largest carbon emitter, largely as a result of deforestation and the burning of peatlands. =Real estate= IOI develops real estate and makes property investments. Two resort hotels in Putrajaya, the Marriott Putrajaya Hotel and the Palm Garden Hotel belong to the IOI Group. The property segment contributes around 18 per cent of the group's earnings. =Oleochemicals and speciality fats= IOI is the largest vegetable oil-based oleochemical manufacturer in Asia‚Äîheld under wholly owned entities IOI Oleochemical Industries Bhd and Pan Century Oleochemical Sdn Bhd with a combined capacity of over 750,000 tonnes per annum.IOI to buy Aditya Birla's Pan Century for RM423 million. New Straits Times, 8 December 2006 These plants produce fatty acids and esters, glycerine, soap noodles, fatty alcohols, and metallic strearates. These have various industrial applications in the production of food, pharmaceutical, cosmetics, personal care, home care, industrial detergent-surfactants and lubricant products. IOI's speciality fats businesses are operated by IOI Loders Croklaan,IOI to buy Unilever's oils and fats division. New Straits Times, 31 August 2002 with manufacturing facilities in the Netherlands, North America, and in Malaysia (with a combined production capacity of more than a million tonnes per year). Loders Croklaan's customer base includes global food giants like Unilever, Nestle, Cadbury and Kraft. Speciality fats are used in pastries, confectionery, snack foods, and ready-to-eat meals. =Refineries= IOI owns refineries in the US and the Netherlands.Forbes 2012 No. 4 Lee Shin Cheng IOI extended its activities to Indonesia in 2005. Its associate company in Indonesia is Bumitama Gunajaya Agro. On 27 September 2016, Greenpeace blockaded the IOI refinery in the Netherlands in order to force IOI to adopt a more sustainable plantation policy. Critics Environmental and civil organizations have criticized IOI Group. Greenpeace first documented the destruction of orangutan habitat and peatland forest in the 2008 report Burning up Borneo,How Unilever palm oil suppliers are Burning up Borneo / Greenpeace followed by a second report in 2015, Under Fire.Indonesia's Forests: Under Fire. Indonesia's fire crisis is a test of corporate commitment to forest protection The company also faced allegations in 2014 from Finnish NGO Finnwatch of serious labour issues on its Malaysian plantations, including confiscating workers' passports, providing contracts in language workers could not understand, restricting freedom of association and paying salaries below the minimum wage.IOI Group suspected of serious labour rights violations IOI is a co-founder of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and has played an active role in shaping the scheme. The company has several of its estates in Malaysia certified as complying with RSPO standards. According to Friends of the Earth in March 2010, IOI Corporation failed to live up to its claims of green stewardship. For example:Too Green to be True, IOI Corporation in Ketapang District, West Kalimantan Milieudefensie and Friends of the Earth Europe, March 2010 :*Plantation development took place in forest lands without approval of the Ministry of Forestry in conflict with the Indonesian legislation :* Plantation development took place without approved environmental impact assessments :* Fraudulent statements were made :* Encroachment has taken place in forests and peatlands :* There is a significant increase in fire hot spots :* Corporate claim not to use peatland but to circumvent the issue it does not consider coastal or shallow peat as peatland. :* Corporate claim not to use \\"burning policy\\". According to the Fire Information for Management System (FIRMS), there was a significant increase in the number of hot spots after land clearing activity started in 2009. :* IOI's current land development activities may trigger significant land conflicts. After a complaint filed by AidEnvironment in April 2015, the RSPO certificates of the IOI Group are suspended as of 1 April 2016.NOTICE TO RSPO MEMBERS ON THE SUSPENSION OF IOI GROUP'S CERTIFICATION Since then, many consumer companies like Unilever, Nestl√© and Mars have cancelled contracts with the company.Unilever palm oil supplier must suspend all plantation expansion to save reputation, The Guardian IOI was reinstated in August 2016 by RSPO after it was judged to have fulfilled the group's demands to improve its environmental performance. In September 2016, Greenpeace published a damning indictment of IOI entitled, A Deadly Trade-Off; IOI's Palm Oil Supply and its Human and Environmental Costs.

Consequently, the fishery industry in the area faced a sharp fall on their fish catch and revenue. Feeling little had been done to study the impact of the spill, a group of fishermen sailed off to begin a blockade of the Valdez Narrows on August 20, 1993. While tankers must pass through Valdez Narrows to enter the port of Valdez, seven tankers were held off in the three-day blockade. As oil was continuing to pump through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, and tankers were keeping off shore, the storage tanks in Valdez would soon overflow. With the probability in interrupting the oil flow to prevent an overflow, and also facing a growing loss in profits, the government came in to settle the blockade. The blockade was called off after Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt promised to release $5 million of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill restoration funds for ecosystem-wide studies. Comprehensive studies of the effects of the spill toward the ecosystem around Prince William Sound began in the following year. References *Tanker Blockade Ends Hugh Curran.

It is the second-largest writer of U.S. commercial property casualty insurance, and the sixth-largest writer of U.S. personal insurance through independent agents. Travelers is incorporated in Minnesota, with headquarters in New York City, and its largest office in Hartford, Connecticut. Travelers also maintains a large office in St. Paul, Minnesota. It has been a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since June 8, 2009. The company has field offices in every U.S. state, plus operations in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Singapore, China, Canada, and Brazil. Travelers ranked No. 106 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations with total revenue of $28.9 billion. Travelers, through its subsidiaries and approximately 14,000 independent agents and brokers, provides commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products and services to businesses, government units, associations, and individuals. The company offers insurance through three segments: * Personal Insurance, which includes home, auto and other insurance products for individuals * Business Insurance, which includes a broad array of property and casualty insurance and insurance-related services in the United States * Bond and Specialty Insurance, which includes surety, crime, and financial liability businesses which primarily use credit-based underwriting processes, as well as property and casualty products that are predominantly marketed on an international basis.  History  Top: The familiar umbrella logo of the Travelers, used until its spinoff from Citigroup. Bottom: The logo that The St. Paul used prior to the merger with Travelers. The main predecessor companies of The Travelers Companies, Inc. are The St. Paul Companies, Inc. and Travelers Property Casualty Corporation. Saint Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co. was founded March 5, 1853, in St. Paul, Minnesota, serving local customers who were having a difficult time getting claim payments in a timely manner from insurance companies on the east coast of the United States. It barely survived the Panic of 1857 by dramatically paring down its operations and later reorganizing itself into a stock company (as opposed to a mutual company). It soon spread its operations across the country. In 1998 it acquired USF&G;, known formerly as United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, an insurance company based in Baltimore, Maryland, for $3.9 billion in stock and assumed debt. By buying USF&G;, they went from the 13th to the eighth largest property and casualty insurance company in the United States. Through economies of scale between the two companies, and a difficult business environment, they downsized the company substantially over the coming years by selling certain business units to focus on more profitable business units. The Travelers Insurance Company was founded in Hartford by James G. Batterson, a stone contractor who became aware for the first time of accident insurance for travelers (i.e., an early form of travel insurance) while traveling in England in 1859 from Leamington to London. His railway ticket included accidental death insurance coverage up to the amount of ¬£1,000, and lesser indemnities for non-fatal injuries. Batterson visited the London and Paris offices of European insurers to learn about the accident insurance business, then went home to Hartford and raised $500,000 in capital to launch a company to provide accident insurance to American travelers. Travelers obtained its official state charter on June 17, 1863. The company did not issue its first regular insurance policy until April 5, 1864, but informally entered into its first insurance agreement a month earlier. On March 1, 1864, local banker James Bolter jokingly inquired of Batterson how much it would cost to insure him up to $5,000 for accidental death for the journey from the post office to his home. Batterson replied, \\"Two cents,\\" which Bolter promptly tendered; those coins have been kept by Travelers ever since. Available via ProQuest Historical Newspapers. The original company logo was a knight's suit of armor. The now-iconic red umbrella first appeared in Travelers advertising as early as 1870, but at that time was not yet the official logo. The company changed its official logo from a suit of armor to the Travelers Tower in 1920, and then replaced that with the red umbrella in 1959. During the 20th century, Travelers was responsible for many insurance industry firsts, including the first automobile policy (1897), the first air travel policy (1919), and the first space travel policy (late 1960s, for astronauts in the Apollo program). In 1954, the company established the world's first privately owned weather research facility, the Travelers Weather Research Center, the first organization to make weather predictions using probabilities (\\"20% chance of rain\\"). By the early 1990s, Travelers was predominantly a general property and casualty insurer that also happened to do some travel insurance on the side, and in February 1994, Travelers quietly exited its original travel insurance business by selling the unit to a retiring Travelers executive. The resulting company is now known as Travel Insured International, a Crum and Forster Company. The Travelers logo, ca. 1993 In the 1990s, Travelers went through a series of mergers and acquisitions. It was bought by Primerica in December 1993, but the resulting company retained the Travelers name. In 1995 it became The Travelers Group. It bought Aetna's property and casualty business in 1996.Aetna Completes Previously Announced Sale Of Property/Casualty Operations To Travellers, Aetna press release, April 2, 1996 In April 1998, the Travelers Group merged with Citicorp to form Citigroup. However, the synergies between the banking and insurance arms of the company did not work as well as planned, so Citigroup spun off Travelers Property and Casualty into a subsidiary company in 2002,Citigroup Announces Completion of its Spin-off of Travelers Property Casualty, Citigroup press release, August 20, 2002 although it kept the red umbrella logo. Three years later, Citigroup sold Travelers Life & Annuity to MetLife.MetLife Completes Acquisition Of Travelers Life & Annuity, MetLife press release, July 1, 2005. In 2003, Travelers bought renewal rights for Royal & SunAlliance Personal Insurance and Commercial businesses.Travelers Property Casualty Corp. Buys Renewal Rights To Commercial and Personal Lines Businesses of Royal & SunAlliance, Travelers Property Casualty Press Release, September 4, 2003. In 2004, the St. Paul and Travelers Companies merged and renamed itself St. Paul Travelers, with the headquarters set in St. Paul, Minnesota. In August of that year, it was charged of misleading statements associated with the merger. Despite many assurances from CEO Jay Fishman that the newly formed company would retain the St. Paul name, the corporate name only lasted until 2007, when the company repurchased the rights to the famous red umbrella logo from Citigroup and readopted it as its main corporate symbol, while also changing the corporate name to The Travelers Companies. Many of Travelers' ancestor companies, such as St. Paul and USF&G;, are technically still around today, and still write policies and accept claims in their own names (under the overarching Travelers brand name). As is typical of most insurers in the United States, Travelers never dissolved the various companies it acquired, but simply made them wholly owned subsidiaries and trained its employees to act on behalf of those subsidiaries. This is a common risk management strategy used by U.S. insurance groups. If any one company in the group gets hit with too many claims, the situation can be easily contained to that one company (which is placed in runoff and allowed to run its policies to completion), while the remainder of the group continues to operate normally. In November 2010, Travelers entered into a joint venture agreement under which the company would invest in J. Malucelli Participa√ß√µes em Seguros e Resseguros S.A., the market leader in the surety insurance business in Brazil. The transaction closed in June 2011 with Travelers acquiring a 43.4 percent interest. Travelers' investment in newly issued shares significantly increased J. Malucelli's capital level, positioning it for substantial growth in Brazil. At the time, Travelers had the option to increase its investment to retain a 49.5 percent interest, which the company later did in 2012. In June 2013, Travelers announced the acquisition of Dominion of Canada General Insurance Company from E-L Financial Corporation Limited (TSX: ELF). The transaction later closed in November 2013. The combined organization, referred to as Travelers Canada, remains headquartered in Toronto. The company's joint venture with J. Malucelli in Brazil completed the acquisition of a majority interest in Cardinal Compa√±√≠a de Seguros, a Colombian start-up surety provider in September 2015. The business, which is based in Bogot√°, operates under the co-branded name J. Malucelli Travelers. In October 2015, Travelers acquired a majority interest in the property casualty business of its J. Malucelli joint venture in Brazil. J. Malucelli commenced writing property casualty business in 2012. The property casualty business operates under the Travelers brand and focuses on property, general liability, construction and financial insurance products. The business is based in S√£o Paulo. As a result of the transaction, Travelers now owns 95 percent of the property casualty business with Paran√° Banco, the parent company of J. Malucelli, retaining a five percent interest. Travelers‚Äô interest in the surety business of the J. Malucelli joint venture remains at 49.5 percent. In March 2017, Travelers agreed to acquire UK-based Simply Business from Aquiline Capital Partners for approximately $490 million. Simply Business is a leading U.K. distributor of small business insurance policies, offering products online on behalf of a broad panel of carriers. It has more than 425,000 microbusiness customers covering more than 1,000 classes of business, and was named ‚ÄúBest Company to Work For‚Äù by The Sunday Times in 2015 and 2016. The transaction adds to Travelers' digital capabilities. In 2018, Travelers ranked 106 on the Fortune 500 list of largest U.S. companies. On June 8, 2009, Travelers replaced its former parent Citigroup on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. On August 4, 2015, the company announced that Alan Schnitzer would succeed Jay Fishman as Chief Executive Officer effective December 1, 2015. On August 4, 2017, Travelers completed its previously announced acquisition of Simply Business, a leading provider of small business insurance policies in the United Kingdom. On August 15, 2018, Travelers acquired the majority stake of Zensurance, a digital business insurance brokerage in Canada.  Alleged anticompetitive practices  In January 2007, Travelers agreed to pay US$77 million to six states to settle a class action suit and end investigations into its insurance practices. The charges involved paying the insurance broker Marsh & McLennan Companies contingent commissions to win business without the knowledge of clients, thus creating a conflict of interest. Additionally, the investigation examined whether Travelers had created the illusion of competition by submitting fake bids, thus misleading clients into believing they were receiving competitive commercial premiums. National Football League lawsuit In August 2012, Travelers sued the National Football League for forcing the company and its subsidiaries to pay to defend the league for failing to protect players from brain injury, in a case filed in the New York State Supreme Court called Discover Property & Casualty Co. et al. vs. National Football League et al., New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 652933/2012. The league had sued over three dozen insurance companies the week before in an attempt to cover the claims that players made against the league.  Advertising  St. Paul Travelers logo used until February 2007 The logo of the red umbrella was created in 1870 when it appeared in a newspaper ad for the young insurance company. It was revived in the early 1960s, when it was given its signature red color by Harry W. Knettell, then the account executive for The Travelers and Vice President at the Charles Brunelle advertising agency. During the late 1960s Charles Brunelle was the largest advertising agency in Hartford, a city known as \\"the insurance capital of the world,\\" \\"the Hollywood of insurance,\\" or \\"America's file cabinet\\" due to the many insurance companies in that town. The Travelers was one of their many insurance company clients.Knettell family history further documented by other Hartford insurance client colleagues including former V.P. of Connecticut General Insurance In 2006, a Travelers commercial titled Snowball was nominated for an Emmy. Snowball featured a man, walking down a steep San Francisco sidewalk, who trips and knocks over a table of items at a garage sale. The man and the items roll down the street, forming a ball which gathers garbage cans, pedestrians, construction materials, motorcycles, light poles, and other items, in a manner very reminiscent of the familiar cartoon \\"snowball\\" effect or the cult video game Katamari Damacy. The creators of the ad say it is simply based on the snowball effect, they have never heard of the game, and that the resulting similarity was a surprise to them. In 2007, the company secured naming rights for an annual golf event to be called the Travelers Championship golf tournament, formerly the Greater Hartford Open, on the PGA Tour. In April 2008, The Travelers repurchased the rights to the famous red umbrella, which is featured in several commercials starring Paul Freeman as well as other advertisements. In July 2008, the spot \\"Delivery,\\" also starring Freeman, was nominated for an Emmy Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Commercial.

It is native to the mountains of Japan. Description Satsuki azaleas have a diverse range of flower forms and color patterns with multiple patterns often appearing on a single plant. Satsuki bloom from May to June; the name ‚ÄúSatsuki‚Äù in Japanese is reference to their blooming period, the fifth month of the Asian lunar calendar. They are commonly used as a subject in bonsai and many bonsai enthusiasts and shows are dedicated solely to them. There are thousands of different varieties, but some popular ones are chinzan, kaho, gyoten, osakasuki, eikan, nikko, hakurei, hakurin, kinsai, and many more.  Bonsai  Satsuki azaleas are popular bonsai plants for many reasons. It can take a hard pruning, the flowers are amazing, and they can be developed fast. Since azaleas prefer to be slightly acidic, a popular soil to grow them in is kanuma. Repotting is a big stress to any tree, and bare rooting is the biggest stress to a tree. When repotting Satsuki azaleas, it is better to do it in early to mid spring. Some people say that you should repot after flowering, but this is not the case. Probably, this is mistaken as happening in the same year. Flowering is the second biggest stress to a Satsuki. So repotting and flowering in the same year is not a healthy thing to do for a tree. That is why when repotting, do not let the Satsuki flower that year. Instead, use a three-year cycle, allowing repotting in year 1, restyling in year 2 and flowering in year 3. Kanuma is a recommended soil for Satsuki azaleas. Also, it is popular to put yamagoki moss on top of the soil to keep them moist. This will benefit the many feeder roots of the tree.

After several years playing the drums in the rock bands Apryl Fool and Happy End during the late 1960s and early 1970s, Matsumoto decided to focus on writing lyrics for others in 1974. As of 2015, he had written over 2,100 songs, 130 of which entered the top 10 on the Oricon chart. Total sales of the singles he has written exceed 49.8 million copies, making him the third best-selling lyricist in Japan. In 2017, he was awarded the Medal with Purple Ribbon from the Japanese government for his work in music. Life and career In elementary school, Matsumoto listened to Igor Stravinsky and read poetry by Jean Cocteau. However, he bought a drum kit and became obsessed with rock music because of the Beatles. Matsumoto is a Keio University graduate. Matsumoto's first band was , which covered songs like Them's \\"Gloria and Sam & Dave's \\"Hold On, I'm Comin'\\". In 1968 he joined the psychedelic rock band Apryl Fool, going by the alias Rei Matsumoto, after being invited to join by Haruomi Hosono. However, they announced their break up on the release day of their only album. In 1969, he and Hosono then formed the pioneering rock band Happy End, for which he wrote most of the lyrics. They officially disbanded on New Year's Eve 1972, before the release of their third album. Upon declaring himself a lyricist, Matsumoto told a friend that he wanted to write a \\"commercial\\" song, meaning a TV advertisement. But the friend mistakenly thought by \\"commercial\\" he meant \\"popular\\" and got him a job writing for Agnes Chan, a pop idol. Matsumoto made his debut as a lyricist in 1974 with \\"Pocket Ippai no Himitsu\\" by Chan. Matsumoto said that while in Happy End he focused on the quality of the music over its potential popularity, but upon becoming a lyricist, he vowed to focus on both quality and sales. He was most prolific in late 1970s and 1980s, offering lyrics to many idol singers such Seiko Matsuda (including 17 of her 24 consecutive 1 singles), Ky≈çko Koizumi, Miho Nakayama, Masahiko Kondo and Hiroko Yakushimaru as well as musical artists such as Yellow Magic Orchestra. The songs \\"Garasu no Shounen\\", \\"Hakka Candy\\" and \\"Boku no Senaka ni wa Hane ga Aru\\" by KinKi Kids are some of his notable recent work. Matsumoto took part in two winning works at 1981's 23rd Japan Record Awards. Akira Terao's hit song \\"Ruby no Yubiwa\\" won the Grand Prix award. Matsumoto wrote nine of the ten songs on his Happy End bandmate Eiichi Ohtaki's record A Long Vacation, which won Best Album. Matsuda's album Supreme, which Matsumoto produced, won Best Album at 1986's 28th Japan Record Awards. In 2002, he formed the independent record label . In 2015, the tribute album was created to commemorate Matsumoto's 45th anniversary as a lyricist. The album won a Planning Award at the 57th Japan Record Awards. A special two-day concert for the same anniversary was held at the Tokyo International Forum on August 21‚Äì22, 2015 featuring numerous artists such as Hiromi ≈åta, Shinji Harada, Shoko Nakagawa, Y≈´ Hayami, Junichi Inagaki, Akiko Yano. Matsumoto himself stepped behind the drum kit once again to perform songs with the surviving members of Happy End; Hosono and Shigeru Suzuki.

It maintains more than 10 research laboratories in Singapore, including a knowledge centre, an \\"innovative process development centre\\", a materials and membrane products development centre as well as advanced machining, prototyping and industrial design functions. The company was founded in 1989 by Ms Olivia Lum, Group CEO, President and Managing Director. In 2006, the company was given the 'Water Company of the Year' award, at the 'Global Water Awards', by the Global Water Intelligence, UK. History The company started initially as Hydrochem (S) Pte Ltd, in 1989 with a start-up capital of S$20,000 and three staff, selling water treatment systems. It was the first water treatment specialist to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange in January 2001. In 2004, Hyflux launched its membrane and materials technology centre - the largest in Asia, outside Japan, to spearhead its development in membrane technology and environmental engineering. In 2007, Hyflux marked another first in the Singapore Stock Exchange by listing the Hyflux Water Trust (HWT) on the mainboard in December. It is Hyflux's primary financial platform for investing in water infrastructure assets in high growth markets globally. Over the last eight years, profits and sales have fallen by a compounded average annual growth rate of -30 per cent. In 2008, the group had net profits of S$59 million. In 2016, the group had net profits of S$3.8 million. On 21 May 2018, the company, which can be rightly considered insolvent, suspended its shares and applied for court supervision to reorganise liabilities and businesses the next day. The company's earnings had been hit from \\"prolonged weakness\\" in the local power market due to the Tuaspring project, the first integrated water and power project in Asia, making losses in 2017 and first quarter of 2018, as an oversupply of gas in the Singapore market caused depressed electricity prices. On 19 October 2018, conglomerate Salim Group and energy giant Medco Group agreed to offer Hyflux a S$400 million equity injection, in exchange for a 60 per cent stake in the company once it has settled all its debts. The sale of a controlling stake in Hyflux to foreign entities will need waivers from national water agency PUB and other authorities. Under the company's restructuring proposal, a holder of Hyflux's perpetual securities and preference shares will recover S$106.54 for every S$1,000 invested, Channel NewsAsia reported on Feb 16, 2019. The Securities Investors Association Singapore (SIAS) will hold an ‚Äúindependent‚Äù town hall session on Feb 25 for retail investors of Hyflux‚Äôs perpetual securities and preferences shares to voice their concerns.

It was one of the first modern popular zoological treatise. First published in German as a six volume work that was completed in 1869 it was published by the Bibliographisches Institut of Herrmann Julius Meyer with illustration directed by Robert Kretschmer. The second edition, completed in 1879 had ten volumes. It was translated into several European languages.  Publishing history  As a freelance writer, Brehm furnished popular- scientific magazines with essays and travelogues. Because of his success in doing this, in 1860 he was commissioned to write a six-volume zoological encyclopedia. Journeys to Abyssinia, Scandinavia and Siberia both interrupted and enriched the work. The first six volumes of the encyclopedia, published under the title Illustrirtes Thierleben, appeared from 1864 to 1869, published by the Bibliographisches Institut under Herrmann Julius Meyer. Illustrated under the direction of Robert Kretschmer (1818-1872), they met with wide approval from the educated bourgeoisie. As of the second edition, which consisted of ten volumes published from 1876 to 1879, the work was already titled Brehms Tierleben. The work made Brehm famous around the world and its title is still a catchphrase today, even though science has gone far beyond Brehm. Perhaps the greatest change in the second edition was the addition of new illustrations by Gustav M√ºtzel, the brothers August and Friedrich Specht and others, which Charles Darwin said were the best he had ever seen. The second edition was reprinted from 1882 to 1884, and a third edition, published from 1890 to 1893, followed. The work has been translated into various languages. Editions have continued to appear into the 20th century, especially in the form of abridged, one-volume works.  Note on the title  The title was at its time written \\"Brehms Thierleben\\" (or respectively, \\"Illustrirtes Thierleben\\"), and is in Germany usually still cited in that way. The spelling reform of 1901 did away with the exception of writing \\"Thier\\" with th, which never means the English th sound in this context.

As a very popular bandleader in the 1940s and 1950s, Carle was nicknamed \\"The Wizard of the Keyboard\\". \\"Sunrise Serenade\\" was Carle's best-known composition, rising to No. 1 in the US in 1938 and selling more than one million copies. Early life Carle was born in Providence, Rhode Island, on March 25, 1903. Born the son of a factory worker who could not afford a piano, he practiced on a dummy keyboard devised by his uncle, pianist Nicholas Colangelo, until he found a broken-down instrument in a dance hall. In 1916, a teenage Carle began working with his uncle's band as well as a number of local bands in the Rhode Island area. To gain further popularity in an America which still held prejudices against many Italian Americans, Carle did what many singers, such as Dean Martin and Jerry Vale, did during this time period; he changed his name from Carlone to Carle. Career Carle started out working with a number of mainstream dance bands. In 1934, he played with Mal Hallett and his orchestra. In 1935, he had his own orchestra and was billed in an ad for one night club as \\"America's Greatest Pianist.\\" He received attention when he joined Horace Heidt and His Musical Knights in 1939. He later became co-leader of the band. The popularity he attained while with Heidt‚Äôs band allowed him to leave the band in 1944 and form his own band, The Frankie Carle Orchestra. When his daughter, Marjorie Hughes, sang with his band, he did not reveal their relationship until Walter Winchell published it. His band disbanded after 1955 and he performed mainly as a soloist thereafter. From the 1950s until the 1980s, Carle performed as a single artist and maintained a close following of loyal fans. Frankie Carle and Others During World War II, he participated in the V-Disc program, making recordings which were released by the U.S. War Department. He introduced V-Disc No. 210A which featured his new composition \\"Moonlight Whispers\\". \\"Sunrise Serenade\\" was released as a V-Disc by the U.S. War Department in July, 1944 as No. 230A in a new recording by Frankie Carle and his Orchestra. =Radio= Carle had early exposure on radio as pianist for The Four Belles singing group in transcribed programs distributed by the World Broadcasting System. In the mid-1940s, Carle and singer Allan Jones starred in the Old Gold Show on CBS radio. Carle also was featured in Pot o' Gold, Treasure Chest, and The Chesterfield Supper Club.DeLong, Thomas A.

He was one of the prominent figures of the Movement of Eighty and became editor in chief of De Nieuwe Gids after the editorial fracture in 1893. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature five times. Biography Kloos was one of the leaders, along with the poet Herman Gorter, the critic Lodewijk van Deyssel, and the prolific writer and psychiatrist Frederik van Eeden, of the influential group of Dutch writers known as the Movement of Eighty (Beweging van Tachtig), otherwise known simply as the Tachtigers, who interacted and worked with each other in Amsterdam in the 1880s. As part of this movement, Kloos criticized mainstream literary style as bookish and overly wrought, and instead sought to write poetry in which the form matched the content, so that intimate experiences should be conveyed with a natural intimacy of expression. Kloos also rejected art that sought to express widely shared experiences or emotions. Instead, he demanded that art must be \\"the most individualistic expression of the most individualistic emotion\\" (\\"de allerindividueelste expressie van de allerindividueelste emotie\\"). Along with the other Tachtigers, Kloos took inspiration in this effort both from Shakespeare and from the then recent Impressionist painters and Naturalist writers. The Tachtigers' primary literary vehicle was a journal co-founded by Kloos called De Nieuwe Gids (The New Guide), first published in October 1885. The title was intended as a sarcastic anti-tribute to the prevailing literary journal in Amsterdam, De Gids (The Guide), which had usually rejected submissions by Kloos and other Tachtigers. Many pieces by Kloos and others that are still very highly regarded first appeared in the early editions of De Nieuwe Gids, including most of Kloos's sonnets, his most important idiom. However, the Tachtigers had one falling out after another, until Kloos was left in 1893 as the only remaining editor from among the original five editors of De Nieuwe Gids. Although he published most of his material over several years starting in 1885 in De Nieuwe Gids, Kloos had actually written most prolifically between 1880 and 1885, and had held onto most of his poems for years before publishing them. He claimed to have lost inspiration to write later in life, and indeed almost all the writings for which he is remembered today were written during that period from 1880 to 1885, even if published later. Starting in 1888 Kloos sought psychiatric treatment from his Tachtiger friend and fellow editor at The New Guide, and psychiatrist, Frederik van Eeden. However, Kloos's mental condition deteriorated, at least partly due to his persistent effort to conceal his homosexuality, and to his increasing alcoholism. He reached his nadir in 1895 when he was picked up in a delirious state and placed temporarily in a sanitarium. He continued trying to write thereafter, although his efforts consisted of little more than ramblings of self-pity and bitter diatribes against one-time friends turned traitors. However, even while Kloos's ongoing efforts were largely ignored, his early works continued to gain an ever-wider appreciation, eventually earning him several literary honors and prizes. Kloos died in The Hague in 1938 at 79, after watching his early writings become part of the canon of Dutch literature.

Overview Relationship management is not an entirely new concept. In fact, it has taken on many forms that address specific organizational constituencies (customers, channel partners, specialized service providers, employees, suppliers, etc.). The most obvious form is CRM (customer relationship management), which focuses on improving top-line growth by maximizing an organization's ability to identify sales and business opportunities with its customers. CRM's little brother PRM (partner relationship management), focuses on optimizing opportunity and downstream order management for an organization's channel partners (e.g. CISCO and its partner lead and referral management process) On the back end, we have ERP (enterprise resource planning) to manage internal operations including manufacturing, finance, HR, sales and distribution, etc. Specialized HRM (human resource management) solutions exist to manage employee benefits, collective agreements, performance reviews and so forth. And lastly, SCM (supply chain management, either as an ERP module or as a stand-alone application) to manage the product flow, up and down a firm's value chain, with external partners/suppliers. Making the links in a business network However, according to Galbreath (2002), \\"for the most part CRM, human resources management (HRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), supply chain management (SCM), partner relationship management (PRM) and similar programs have paid very little attention to the relationships that underpin those processes, or to the intangible ‚Äì relationship ‚Äì assets embedded in them.\\" Norman and Ramirez (1993) state, \\"One of the chief strategic challenges of the new economy is to integrate knowledge and relationships ‚Äì devise a good fit between competencies (Competencies are the technologies, specialized expertise, business processes and techniques that a company has accumulated over time and packages in its offering) and customers and keep that fit current.\\" Galbraeth (2002) adds that \\"success in the relationship age requires a deliberate process of creating intangible, relationship assets, growing them and monetizing them\\". Galbreath (2002) suggests that enterprise relationship management is a process that harmonizes and synergizes different organizational relationships to realize targeted business benefits and goal. Harbison et al. (2000)did some research on the performance of alliances and cited the following statistics in their study: * \\"Strategic alliances have consistently produced a return on investment of nearly 17 percent among the top 2,000 companies in the world for nearly a decade. This return is 50 percent more than the average return on investment that the companies produced overall.\\" Harbison et al. (2000) * \\"The 25 companies most active in alliances achieved a 17.2 percent return on equity - 40 percent more than the average return on equity of the Fortune 500.\\" - Harbison et al. (2000) * \\"The 25 companies least active in alliances lagged the Fortune 500, with an average return on equity of only 10.1 percent.\\" - Harbison et al. (2000) * \\"Successful alliances recognize 20 percent profitability improvements as compared to only 11 percent for the less successful companies.\\" - Harbison et al. (2000) * \\"Revenue generation from highly successful alliances equates to 21 percent of overall firm sales as compared to 14 percent for less successful alliances.\\" - Harbison et al. (2000) In a similar study conducted for the supplier side (results of efficiently run supply chains based on electronic integration and quality processes) by Solomon Smith Barney Analyst Report, Teagarden (2000) presents the following statistics for suppliers: * Inventory levels reduced by as much as 50 percent. * Inventory turns doubled. * Stock outs reduced ninefold. * On-time deliveries increased by as much as 40 percent. * Cycle times decreased by as much as 27 percent overall. * Supply chain costs reduced by as much as 20 percent. * Revenues increased by as much as 17 percent. When looking at these numbers, collaboration with outside firms becomes very attractive. But success in business, as in many other pursuits, is dependent on motivation, investment, trust, discipline and repeatability. Tools and methodologies ERM frameworks are needed because relationships are becoming prevalent and more integral to an organization's success. Although establishing inter-enterprise links is far from a new science, Klambach and Roussel (1999) affirm that nearly 60% of business alliances do not deliver anticipated benefits while Lovallo & Kahneman (2003) and Selden & Colvin (2003) estimate M&A; ( Mergers & Acquisitions) failures range between 70% and 80%. With statistics like these, the need to improve relationship success rates seems quite obvious. Many authors have addressed these issues from varying perspectives, including technology enabling a firm, reviewing or re- designing operational & administrative processes, and transforming the culture to one that is more adapted to collaboration. As Galbreath (2002) and Norman & Ramirez (1993) state, collaboration or rather the effective leveraging of relationship resources to create new sources of value, is a process of learning and developing new mental models and competencies (Senge, 1991) as well as obtaining resources through new means/sources. ERM is still a relatively new field and few players stand-out with a complete ERM methodology and tools. Nevertheless, a host of best of breed tools and methodologies exist to carry out an ERM implementation, unfortunately they are not integrated and focus on very specialized problem areas. ERM tools can be viewed as enablers of an ERM methodology. Fundamentally adopting ERM is a cultural and change management issue more than a technology or process one. Therefore, regardless of the methodology or tools that one may elect to use when integrating with outside firms, they must maintain a focus on the human side of the equations. The figure below illustrates the benefits of focusing on the human, cultural and change aspect of a project, notably deploying ERM in this case. Practical methodologies and frameworks =RIIM and PowerScope= RIIM (Relationship Intelligence and Influence Management) is a registered method of Perfluence. It is a systemic approach based on the assumption that each relationship can be seen as a linear combination of five different kind of common relationships.

Early life Duffy was born and grew up in Manchester. He has Irish and Jewish ancestry. He began playing the guitar at the age of fourteen, being influenced by the music of Queen, Thin Lizzy, The Who, Aerosmith, Blue √ñyster Cult, and the early work of Led Zeppelin. In the late 1970s he became involved in the punk movement, being influenced by the New York Dolls, The Stooges, Buzzcocks and The Sex Pistols, as well as AC/DC (which he views as a proto-Punk group). He started playing lead guitar with a number of different punk acts whilst still in school in the late 1970s, including the Studio Sweethearts. In the Manchester scene he personally influenced Johnny Marr to start performing as a guitarist, and encouraged Morrissey to make his first foray as singer/frontman with a punk- rock act entitled The Nosebleeds. After leaving school, Duffy left Manchester when the Studio Sweethearts moved to London, working for a period as a shop assistant at Johnsons in the King's Road, in Chelsea. The Studio Sweethearts subsequently broke up and Duffy began playing lead guitar part-time with the band entitled Theatre of Hate. Shortly after he met Ian Astbury, who was at that time the frontman/lead vocalist with the Southern Death Cult, who was sufficiently impressed with Duffy's talents that he quit the Southern Death Cult to start a new band with him called Death Cult. After releasing two singles, the band shortened its name to The Cult. In The Cult's debut single \\"Spiritwalker\\", Duffy created a distinctive flanged sound using an unfashionable at the time choice of guitar - a mid 1970s Gretsch White Falcon, which became his trademark sound and image. This was followed up the album titled \\"Love\\". It featured the hit \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\". Billy Duffy is an avid Manchester City FC fan Late 1980s and 1990s Duffy helped change The Cult's sound into metal-blues for their third album, 1987's Electric. Duffy moved to Los Angeles in 1988 with Astbury, where both remain. There, the two writing partners (with longtime bassist Jamie Stewart) turned to stadium rock and recorded Sonic Temple. The Cult reached a larger, mainstream audience, but the public's attention could not be sustained with their next album, Ceremony, at the dawn of the grunge age. Following the 'Ceremonial Stomp' tour of 1992, Astbury pressured Duffy to return to their roots, with The Cult's The Cult album. This would ultimately lead to Astbury's departure from Duffy and The Cult in 1995. During The Cult's four-year hiatus, Duffy played with Mike Peters of The Alarm in a project called Coloursound. Duffy plays on the title track from Japanese musician J's 1997 debut album, Pyromania. The Cult reformation Duffy reformed The Cult with Astbury in 1999, which led to a new recording contract with Atlantic Records. This was capped off by a show at Atlanta's Music Midtown Festival in May 2001, where over 60,000 people watched them perform, leading up to the release of Beyond Good and Evil. Their single to promote it, \\"Rise\\", which reached No. 125 in the US and No. 3 for 6 weeks on the mainstream rock chart, was removed from radio rotation a week after the album's release. Disappointing sales, reviews, and tour attendance ensued. In 2002 Astbury sent The Cult onto a hiatus once more, when he accepted an offer to sing with The Doors. 2004 onward Duffy playing his White Gretsch with The Cult in Rochester, New York in 2009 In early, 2004 Duffy formed the covers band Cardboard Vampyres alongside Alice in Chains guitarist/vocalist Jerry Cantrell. Also in the band were M√∂tley Cr√ºe and Ratt vocalist John Corabi, The Cult bassist Chris Wyse and drummer Josh Howser. The band played at various venues in the United States between 2004 and 2005. They predominately played along the West Coast. No albums were released by the band. The Cult reformed in early 2006 and after playing several US concerts toured Europe. Duffy appeared in Ethan Dettenmaier's film, Sin-Jin Smyth, which was filmed in 2006, but remains unreleased. In early 2006 Duffy recorded a debut album with his new band, Circus Diablo. The album was recorded with Duffy playing lead guitar and former Cult touring bass player Billy Morrison handling lead vocals and bass guitar duties. Former The Almighty frontman, Ricky Warwick, played rhythm guitar on the CD. The former Cult, current Velvet Revolver, drummer Matt Sorum also played on the record. After the completion of the album, former Fuel member Brett Scallions was added as bassist so Morrison could focus on being the lead singer. Then Jeremy Colson, formerly with Steve Vai, was brought in to be the full-time drummer for the band. Duffy's involvement ended in 2007. In 2007, he was a judge on Bodog Music's Battle Of The Bands. In 2010, Duffy appeared on the TV-series, Married to Rock, which starred his girlfriend AJ Celi. In October 2012, he performed with Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony at the Cabo Wabo Cantina for Sammy Hagar's Birthday Bash in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. In an October 2016 interview with PopMatters journalist J.C. Ma√ßek III, Duffy spoke about his favorite Cult song, saying \\"Jonesy [former Sex Pistols guitarist turned radio host Steve Jones] on Jonesy‚Äôs Jukebox just played 'Love' from the Love album and that's my favorite Cult song,\\" he tells me proudly. \\"I actually got, I have to admit, a teeny bit of a goose bump because it just captured exactly what I wanted to say with that kind of haunting rock. Kind of swaggery but not heavy, it's got ... Duffy searches for the right words to express his emotion at hearing the song from the outside, \\"I mean nobody ... I don‚Äôt know who makes music like that!\\" Between 2012 and 2016, Duffy appeared with the Kings of Chaos.

With a drop of 133 meters (and 13 meters wide), it is the country's tallest water fall with single uninterrupted drop; however, the tallest waterfalls with multiple drops in Japan are Hannoki Falls, at 497 m (seasonal), and Sh≈çmy≈ç Falls, at 350m (year round). There are two rocks at the top of the falls that are the guardian kami of the falls and the Shinto shrine. There was also a Buddhist temple here that was destroyed during the Meiji Restoration (late 19th century). Many shugenja and star-crossed lovers have leaped from the top of the waterfall in the belief that they will be reborn into Kannon's paradise. Early each morning the Shinto priest make offerings to the waterfall in a ritual. In 1918, a Sutra mound was excavated at the base of the waterfall and found to contain many important archaeological artifacts, including statues, mirrors, altar fittings and Sutra cylinders. These are now displayed in the Ryuhoden (‚ÄúTreasure Hall‚Äù), located next to the Sanj≈´d≈ç Pagoda (the 3-story pagoda). These Sutra mounds were created by priests in times of war to hide their treasures but also many items were buried in this way as a result of the belief that the end of the world was coming at the start of the 10th century.

The seventh main installment in the Mario Party series, it was first released in North America and Japan in November 2005, in Europe in February 2006, and in Australia in June 2006. It makes use of the microphone peripheral introduced in Mario Party 6, and features twelve characters, including two new unlockable characters: Birdo and Dry Bones. Koopa Kid was omitted as a playable character, after being playable in the two previous games. Mario Party 7 was the fourth and last game in the series released for the GameCube, and was followed by Mario Party 8 for the Wii in May 2007. Gameplay The game has eight-player minigames, in which eight people can compete in four teams of two. The minigame pictured here is \\"Grin and Bar It\\". The goal of Mario Party 7 is to gather stars, but each board requires it in a different way. For the first time ever since the series' initial release in 1999, eight players may participate in either Party Cruise or Deluxe Cruise (the 8 player equivalent of the Mini-Game Cruise). Players are split into teams of two and are required to share a controller, with the first player using the L button and the Control Stick in mini-games, while the second player uses the R button and the C-stick. While a mode for a solo player itself isn't new to the Mario Party series, this game's take is very much different from any of the past six games. One player competes against another (either computer controlled or human played), trying to complete the set objective on the board map before the other can. Tasks range from collecting a set number of stars to having a set number of coins on a space. Up to ten slots of different characters with different phrases may be saved. Once a player has completed all six boards, they are added to the rankings section, where it shows the players who took the least turns to complete them. There are 88 minigames in Mario Party 7. Once again, no minigames from previous editions appear. There are nine types of minigames in the game: 4-player, 1-vs.-3, 2-vs.-2, Battle, Duel, 8-player, DK, Bowser, and Rare. For 4-player and 1-vs.-3, there are an additional five minigames that can be played with the microphone. In 8 player minigames, one player uses the Control Stick and L, and the other player uses the C stick and R. The minigame controls range from pressing a button repeatedly to using the control stick and several buttons. There are extra minigames which the player must purchase in-game to unlock. Another new addition to this game is \\"Bowser Time!\\". This is an event that only occurs every five turns during a Party Cruise match. After each minigame, the meter on the screen will increase by 20% and when the meter is full, then Bowser will appear and he will hinder the players depending on which board that the characters are currently playing. Depending on the board, Bowser may destroy bridges, take stars from players, or change star locations. On almost every board at some time, Bowser may take a photo as a \\"memento\\" of the vacation and take the players' coins. At other times, he may open a shop that sells the players useless and expensive items, which are then taken by Koopa Kid. \\"Bowser Time!\\" may only occur once, or up to nine times, depending on the number of turns played. This was also the first game in the Mario Party series to have removed the autoplay capability in Party mode (where all players can be manually set to AI, thus enabling the game to \\"play itself\\" without any human player). The game will not allow there to be less than one active human player at any time, unless a code is used. Plot Toadsworth has invited Mario and all of his friends to go on a luxury cruise around the world due to all the hard work; however, Bowser was not invited. Furious at being omitted, King Koopa vows revenge. When the cruise ship arrives at its first destination, the passengers discover that Bowser has turned their vacation paradise into a stress-filled madhouse. Mario tries to gain as many stars as possible to end this. Reception The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of two eights and two sevens for a total of 30 out of 40. IGN gave the game a 7 out of 10, stating solely it was \\"a slumber party\\". It sold 1.86 million copies worldwide.

While similar in name, it has no relations with the Ultimate Soccer Manager series, but was followed by Striker still for the Mega Drive/Genesis, Striker '96, released for DOS, Sega Saturn and the PlayStation, and Striker Pro 2000, released for PlayStation and the Dreamcast. While never published to the SNES, Rage developed other games for the Nintendo console, including Elite Soccer, Manchester United Championship Soccer (also had version named after Eric Cantona and Lothar Matth√§us) and World Soccer 94 ‚Äì Road to Glory. Focused on national teams (with a total of 64, all with fake names and individual team values), it had one of the highest option counts for 16-bit football games: up to 18 different settings can be changed, including ball weight, weather, surface, tightness of ball control, passback rule and perhaps the most remembered of all, the ability to play 6-on-6 indoor football. Several game modes are available, including friendlies, penalty shootout, Ultimate League, Ultimate Cup (group phase and knockout stage) and Knockout. However, the game lacks both passwords and battery save, and all competitions must be completed in one sitting. Up to eight players can play if two 4-player adapters are used. Ultimate Soccer is played in a field of vision similar to the Madden NFL games in the console, a second-row view behind the players' shoulders that can also be tilted to show more field depth or more detail closer to the bottom of the screen. Player sprites, while small, are well animated and with small details such as dirt or water splashing from the players' feet (which would become one of the trademark effects in Sega's own Worldwide Soccer) Gameplay Gameplay depends of how versions are tweaked: lighter balls travel farther and higher and can be given zig-zag aftertouches (perfect from long range shots), but on the other hand, are more prone to be deflected by strong winds. Heavy balls barely lift from the floor which makes them more suitable for short passing, but are affected by wet grass. It's possible to score from any situation, including direct corners and freekicks, head deflections from long passes, bicycle kicks, working around the goalkeeper or pressing the defense and try to tackle the ball in.

They interacted and worked together in Amsterdam from the 1880s. Many of them are still widely read today. The Tachtigers were so named simply because they became active around the year 1880. The movement was based on revolt against what the Tachtigers perceived as the formalistic and overly wrought style of mainstream literature in their day, particularly as favored by the predominant literary journal in Amsterdam, De Gids (The Guide). The Tachtigers instead insisted that style must match content, and that intimate and visceral emotions can only be expressed using an intimate and visceral writing style. For guidance in this effort, they tended to draw inspiration from Shakespeare, and from the then recent Impressionist painters and Naturalist writers. After De Gids continued to reject most of their submissions, the Tachtigers founded their own competing literary journal, mockingly called De Nieuwe Gids (The New Guide), first published in October 1885. Two of the founding editors and frequent contributors were the poet and critic Willem Kloos and the poet, novelist, playwright, essayist, and psychiatrist Frederik van Eeden, both of whom are widely regarded today as canonical greats of Dutch literature. The other three founding editors were F. van der Goes, Willem Paap, and Albert Verwey. Other prominent Tachtigers whose works appeared in De Nieuwe Gids include the literary critic Lodewijk van Deyssel and the poet Herman Gorter, author of the epic poem Mei, who is probably the most widely read Tachtiger. He went on to become a founding member of the Social Democratic Party and was a prominent theoretician of the social democratic and council communist movements. Another prominent novelist, Louis Couperus, published his first novel in 1889 and was deeply influenced by the Tachtigers. He is often counted as a Tachtiger, although he was outside the Amsterdam social circle of the true Tachtigers.

Biography Born to a Jewish family in New York City, the son of Polish immigrants to the United States, his father was a Marxist garment industry union organiser, and Cole was a dedicated socialist from childhood. Lester Cole began his career as an actor but soon turned to screenwriting. His first work was If I Had a Million. In 1933, he joined with John Howard Lawson and Samuel Ornitz to establish the Writers Guild of America, and in 1934 joined the American Communist Party. Between 1932 and 1947, Cole wrote more than forty screenplays that were made into motion pictures. =Blacklisting= In 1947, he became one of the Hollywood Ten, who refused to answer questions before the House Committee on Un-American Activities about their Communist Party membership. Cole was convicted of Contempt of Congress, fined $1,000 and sentenced to twelve months' confinement at the Federal Correctional Institution at Danbury, Connecticut, of which he served ten months. As a result of his refusal to testify, Cole was blacklisted by studio executives, after which just three of his screenplays were made into films - submitted under the names Gerald L.C. Copley, Lewis Copley, and J. Redmond Prior. His best-known screenplay was that for the highly successful Born Free (1966), credited to Gerald L.C. Copley. Later life In 1981, Cole published his autobiography, entitled Hollywood Red: The Autobiography of Lester Cole. In it, he recounted a 1978 incident when he called into a radio talk show on which ex-Communist Budd Schulberg was a guest. According to Cole, he berated Schulberg (who had testified before HUAC as a friendly witness) on the air as a \\"canary\\" and a \\"stool pigeon\\" before he was cut off: About this incident, Kenneth Lloyd Billingsley (Hollywood Party: How Communism Seduced the American Film Industry) comments, \\"Whether this actually happened is uncertain, but one can guess.\\" Lester Cole died of a heart attack in San Francisco, California, in 1985. Ronald Radosh, Emeritus Professor of History at City University of New York, wrote that Cole \\"remained a hardcore Communist\\" until his death.

Dutch Revolt The Dutch Revolt, also called the Eighty Years' War, of 1568‚Äì1648 was the struggle by the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands for independence from the Spanish Empire. Spain was at the height of its power and initially suppressed the rebellion, but in 1572 the Dutch rebels captured the strategic port of Brielle, providing them with a bridgehead for rapidly expanding the area under their control. Supported by France and Protestant states like England and Scotland, by 1581 the Northern provinces of the Netherlands were de facto independent. By the mid-17th century the Netherlands was the world's leading economic and maritime power, a period of economic, scientific and cultural growth later known as the Dutch Golden Age. Despite these successes, the Dutch failed to expel the Spanish from the wealthy provinces of the Southern Netherlands, modern-day Belgium, Luxembourg plus the Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Longwy regions of northern France. France had financed the Dutch for many years to weaken the Habsburgs, then the dominant power in Europe; after the Treaty of Prague in 1635 it formally declared war on Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. In 1639, the Dutch navy destroyed a Spanish fleet carrying supplies and men to the Netherlands at the Battle of the Downs while in 1643 the French defeated the Army of Flanders at the Battle of Rocroi. French intervention and internal discontent at the costs of the Dutch war led to a change in Spain's 'Netherlands First' policy and a focus on suppressing the French-backed Catalan Revolt or Reapers War. After Rocroi, France acquired large parts of the Southern Netherlands and Dutch leaders like Andries Bicker and Cornelis de Graeff grew concerned the main beneficiary of continuing the war was France. These fears were heightened by suggestions of a treaty between Spain and France that would be reinforced by a marriage between Louis XIV and a daughter of Philip IV. Such an outcome threatened the Dutch since France would acquire dynastic rights over the Southern Netherlands and potentially the Northern provinces as well. These factors increased the urgency on both sides to end the war. Negotiations and peace Negotiations between began in 1641 in the towns of M√ºnster and Osnabr√ºck, in present-day Germany. With the initiation of Spanish-Dutch peace talks, Dutch trade with the Levant and the Iberian Peninsula began to flourish. Dutch merchants, benefiting from both the availability of relatively cheap shipping and the cessation of hostilities, soon dominated the markets that had been previously dominated by English traders. Dutch merchants would also benefit from the foreign upheavals of the English Civil War and gain on English trade in their American colonies.Gijs Rommelse, \\"The Role of Mercantilism in Anglo-Dutch political relations, 1650-74\\", p.596. Economic History Review, New Series, Vol. 63, No. 3 (August 2010), pp. 591-611 While Spain did not recognise the Dutch Republic, it agreed that the Lords States General of the United Netherlands was 'sovereign' and could participate in the peace talks. In January 1646, eight Dutch representatives arrived in M√ºnster to begin negotiations; these included two delegates from Holland with one each from the other six provinces. The Spanish envoys had been given great authority by the Spanish King Philip IV who had been suing for peace for years. On 30 January 1648, the parties reached agreement and the text sent to the Hague and Madrid for approval; it was ratified by the Spanish and Dutch delegations on 15 May, with the States General narrowly approving the Treaty on 5 June 1648. The Peace of M√ºnster between the Holy Roman Emperor, France and their allies and the Treaty of Osnabr√ºck involving the Holy Roman Empire, Sweden and their allies were collectively known as the Peace of Westphalia. While European conflict continued, this marks a significant point in the transition to sovereignty based on states rather than individuals e.g. the Habsburgs. Sovereignty has been defined by historian Harry Hinsley as the idea that there is a final and absolute political authority in the political community...and no final and absolute authority exists elsewhere. Despite achieving independence, there was considerable opposition to the Treaty within the States General since it allowed Spain to retain the Southern Provinces and permitted religious toleration for Catholics. Support from the powerful province of Holland meant it was narrowly approved but these differences resulted in political conflict. An original copy of the treaty is held by the Rijksarchief (Dutch national archives) in The Hague. Footnotes References Sources * Boer, H. W. J. de, H. Bruch en H. Krol (red.)

The street is in a commercial district; the buildings all have at least several stories, and some are high rise. The buildings have elaborate signs, many of which incorporate neon lighting. There are prominent signs for Madame Tussaud's, Loew's, Empire, AMC 25 Theatre, and Modell's. Piccadilly Circus, London, 1962 Neon lighting consists of brightly glowing, electrified glass tubes or bulbs that contain rarefied neon or other gases. Neon lights are a type of cold cathode gas-discharge light. A neon tube is a sealed glass tube with a metal electrode at each end, filled with one of a number of gases at low pressure. A high potential of several thousand volts applied to the electrodes ionizes the gas in the tube, causing it to emit colored light. The color of the light depends on the gas in the tube. Neon lights were named for neon, a noble gas which gives off a popular orange light, but other gases and chemicals are used to produce other colors, such as hydrogen (red), helium (yellow), carbon dioxide (white), and mercury (blue). Neon tubes can be fabricated in curving artistic shapes, to form letters or pictures. They are mainly used to make dramatic, multicolored glowing signage for advertising, called neon signs, which were popular from the 1920s to 1960s and again in the 1980s. The term can also refer to the miniature neon glow lamp, developed in 1917, about seven years after neon tube lighting. While neon tube lights are typically meters long, the neon lamps can be less than one centimeter in length and glow much more dimly than the tube lights. They are still in use as small indicator lights. Through the 1970s, neon glow lamps were widely used for numerical displays in electronics, for small decorative lamps, and as signal processing devices in circuity. While these lamps are now antiques, the technology of the neon glow lamp developed into contemporary plasma displays and televisions. Neon was discovered in 1898 by the British scientists William Ramsay and Morris W. Travers. After obtaining pure neon from the atmosphere, they explored its properties using an \\"electrical gas-discharge\\" tube that was similar to the tubes used for neon signs today. Georges Claude, a French engineer and inventor, presented neon tube lighting in essentially its modern form at the Paris Motor Show, December 3‚Äì18, 1910.The dates of the 1910 Paris Motor Show are incorporated into this poster for the show. Claude lit the peristyle of the Grand Palais in Paris with neon tubes; this webpage includes a contemporary photograph that gives an impression of the effect. The webpage is part of an extensive selection of images of neon lighting; see Claude, sometimes called \\"the Edison of France\\", had a near monopoly on the new technology, which became very popular for signage and displays in the period 1920-1940. Neon lighting was an important cultural phenomenon in the United States in that era; As explained in this article, Claude did not discover neon. by 1940, the downtowns of nearly every city in the US were bright with neon signage, and Times Square in New York City was known worldwide for its neon extravagances. There were 2000 shops nationwide designing and fabricating neon signs. The popularity, intricacy, and scale of neon signage for advertising declined in the U.S. following the Second World War (1939‚Äì1945), but development continued vigorously in Japan, Iran, and some other countries. In recent decades architects and artists, in addition to sign designers, have again adopted neon tube lighting as a component in their works. Neon lighting is closely related to fluorescent lighting, which developed about 25 years after neon tube lighting. In fluorescent lights, the light emitted by rarefied gases within a tube is used exclusively to excite fluorescent materials that coat the tube, which then shine with their own colors that become the tube's visible, usually white, glow. Fluorescent coatings and glasses are also an option for neon tube lighting, but are usually selected to obtain bright colors. History and science Gas discharge tube containing neon, which was first displayed by Ramsay and Travers; \\"Ne\\" is the symbol for neon, one of the chemical elements. alt=Photograph of glass tube that's been bent to form the connected letters \\"Ne\\". The tube is glowing brightly with a red color. Neon is a noble gas chemical element and an inert gas that is a minor component of the Earth's atmosphere. It was discovered in 1898 by the British scientists William Ramsay and Morris W. Travers. When Ramsay and Travers had succeeded in obtaining pure neon from the atmosphere, they explored its properties using an \\"electrical gas-discharge\\" tube that was similar to the tubes used today for neon signs. Travers later wrote, \\"the blaze of crimson light from the tube told its own story and was a sight to dwell upon and never forget.\\" The procedure of examining the colors of the light emitted from gas-discharge (or \\"Geissler\\" tubes) was well-known at the time, since the colors of light (the \\"spectral lines\\") emitted by a gas discharge tube are, essentially, fingerprints that identify the gases inside. Immediately following neon's discovery, neon tubes were used as scientific instruments and novelties. Fleming used a tube of neon, without electrodes, to explore the amplitudes of radiofrequency waves by examining the intensity of the tube's light emission. He had obtained his neon directly from its discoverer, Ramsay. However, the scarcity of purified neon gas precluded its prompt application for electrical gas-discharge lighting along the lines of Moore tubes, which used more common nitrogen or carbon dioxide as the working gas, and enjoyed some commercial success in the US in the early 1900s. After 1902, Georges Claude's company in France, Air Liquide, began producing industrial quantities of neon as a byproduct of the air liquefaction business. From December 3‚Äì18, 1910, Claude demonstrated two large ( long), bright red neon tubes at the Paris Motor Show. alt=Photograph of a large painted sign in the form of a cowboy. The cowboy is winking his eye. His left hand is lifted, and he's pointing that thumb towards the building to his right. A lighted cigarette dangles from the corner of his mouth.

Display of neon lighting samples in a glass studio These neon tubes were essentially in their contemporary form. The range of outer diameters for the glass tubing used in neon lighting is 9 to 25 mm; with standard electrical equipment, the tubes can be as long as . Reproduction of a chart in the catalog of a lighting company in Toronto; the original ANSI specification is not given. The pressure of the gas inside is in the range 3-20 Torr (0.4-3 kPa), which corresponds to a partial vacuum in the tubing. Claude had also solved two technical problems that substantially shortened the working life of neon and some other gas discharge tubes, and effectively gave birth to a neon lighting industry. In 1915 a US patent was issued to Claude covering the design of the electrodes for gas-discharge lighting; See reproduction of patent. this patent became the basis for the monopoly held in the US by his company, Claude Neon Lights, for neon signs through the early 1930s. Paid access. Claude's patents envisioned the use of gases such as argon and mercury vapor to create different colors beyond those produced by neon. For instance, mixing metallic mercury with neon gas create blue. Green can then be achieved using uranium (yellow) glass. White and gold can also be created with adding argon and helium.Use of Electricity in business ‚Äì Variety and Beauty in the Neon Tube. (1934, January 13). Hong Kong Daily Press. p. 2.

By the 1930s, the colors from combinations of neon tube lights had become satisfactory for some general interior lighting applications, and achieved some success in Europe, but not in the US. Since the 1950s, the development of phosphors for color televisions has created nearly 100 new colors for neon tube lighting. Around 1917, Daniel McFarlan Moore, then working at the General Electric Company, developed the miniature neon lamp. The glow lamp has a very different design than the much larger neon tubes used for signage; the difference was sufficient that a separate US patent was issued for the lamp in 1919. A Smithsonian Institution website notes, \\"These small, low power devices use a physical principle called \\"coronal discharge.\\" Moore mounted two electrodes close together in a bulb and added neon or argon gas. The electrodes would glow brightly in red or blue, depending on the gas, and the lamps lasted for years. Since the electrodes could take almost any shape imaginable, a popular application has been fanciful decorative lamps. Glow lamps found practical use as electronic components, and as indicators in instrument panels and in many home appliances until the acceptance of Light- Emitting Diodes (LEDs) starting in the 1970s.\\" Although some neon lamps themselves are now antiques, and their use in electronics has declined markedly, the technology has continued to develop in artistic and entertainment contexts. Neon lighting technology has been reshaped from long tubes into thin flat panels used for plasma displays and plasma television sets. Neon tube lighting and signs Neon sign in Falls Church, Virginia When Georges Claude demonstrated an impressive, practical form of neon tube lighting in 1910, he apparently envisioned that it would be used as a form of lighting, which had been the application of the earlier Moore tubes that were based on nitrogen and carbon dioxide discharges. Claude's 1910 demonstration of neon lighting at the Grand Palais (Grand Palace) in Paris lit a peristyle of this large exhibition space. Claude's associate, Jacques Fonseque, realized the possibilities for a business based on signage and advertising. By 1913 a large sign for the vermouth Cinzano illuminated the night sky in Paris, and by 1919 the entrance to the Paris Opera was adorned with neon tube lighting. Neon signage was received with particular enthusiasm in the United States. In 1923, Earle C. Anthony purchased two neon signs from Claude for his Packard car dealership in Los Angeles, California; these literally stopped traffic. Claude's US patents had secured him a monopoly on neon signage, and following Anthony's success with neon signs, many companies arranged franchises with Claude to manufacture neon signs. In many cases companies were given exclusive licenses for the production of neon signs in a given geographical area; by 1931, the value of the neon sign business was $16.9 million, of which a significant percentage was paid to Claude Neon Lights, Inc. by the franchising arrangements. Claude's principal patent expired in 1932, which led to a great expansion in the production of neon signage. The industry's sales in 1939 were about $22.0 million; the expansion in volume from 1931 to 1939 was much larger than the ratio of sales in the two years suggests. Rudi Stern has written, \\"The 1930s were years of great creativity for neon, a period when many design and animation techniques were developed. ... Men like O. J. Gude and, in particular, Douglas Leigh took neon advertising further than Georges Claude and his associates had ever envisioned. Leigh, who conceived and created the archetypal Times Square spectacular, experimented with displays that incorporated smells, fog, and sounds as part of their total effect. ... Much of the visual excitement of Times Square in the thirties was a result of Leigh's genius as a kinetic and luminal artist.\\" Major cities throughout the United States and in several other countries also had elaborate displays of neon signs. Events such as the Chicago Century of Progress Exposition (1933‚Äì34), the Paris World's Fair (1937) and New York World's Fair (1939) were remarkable for their extensive use of neon tubes as architectural features. Stern has argued that the creation of \\"glorious\\" neon displays for movie theaters led to an association of the two, \\"One's joy in going to the movies became inseparably associated with neon.\\" A neon sign for Fish and chips in London, England The Second World War (1939‚Äì1945) arrested new sign installations around most of the world. Following the war, the industry resumed. Marcus Thielen writes of this era, \\"...after World War II, government programs were established to help re-educate soldiers. The Egani Institute (New York City) was one of few schools in the country that taught neon-trade secrets. The American streamlined design from the 1950s would be unimaginable without the use of neon.\\" The development of Las Vegas, Nevada as a resort city is inextricably linked with neon signage; Tom Wolfe wrote in 1965, \\"Las Vegas is the only city in the world whose skyline is made neither of buildings, like New York, nor of trees, like Wilbraham, Massachusetts, but signs. One can look at Las Vegas from a mile away on route 91 and see no buildings, no trees, only signs. But such signs! They tower. They revolve, they oscillate, they soar in shapes before which the existing vocabulary of art history is helpless.\\" Includes a reprint of a 1965 essay, \\"Las Vegas (What?) Las Vegas (Can't Hear You Too Noisy) Las Vegas!!!!\\" Overall, however, neon displays became less fashionable, and some cities discouraged their construction with ordinances.San Jose, California is one of many cities that had an anti-neon ordinance; see Nelson Algren titled his 1947 collection of short stories The Neon Wilderness (as a synonym of \\"urban jungle\\" for Chicago). Margalit Fox has written, \\"... after World War II, as neon signs were replaced increasingly by fluorescent-lighted plastic, the art of bending colored tubes into sinuous, gas-filled forms began to wane.\\" A dark age persisted at least through the 1970s, when artists adopted neon with enthusiasm; in 1979 Rudi Stern published his manifesto, Let There Be Neon. Marcus Thielen wrote in 2005, on the 90th anniversary of the US patent issued to Georges Claude, \\"The demand for the use of neon and cold cathode in architectural applications is growing, and the introduction of new techniques like fiberoptics and LED ‚Äî into the sign market have strengthened, rather than replaced, neon technology. The evolution of the 'waste' product neon tube remains incomplete 90 years after the patent was filed.\\" Neon glow lamps and plasma displays The digits of a alt=Sequence of ten photograph of a glass tube.

In neon glow lamps, the luminous region of the gas is a thin, \\"negative glow\\" region immediately adjacent to a negatively charged electrode (or \\"cathode\\"); the positively charged electrode (\\"anode\\") is quite close to the cathode. These features distinguish glow lamps from the much longer and brighter \\"positive column\\" luminous regions in neon tube lighting. The energy dissipation in the lamps when they are glowing is very low (about 0.1 W), hence the distinguishing term cold-cathode lighting. Some of the applications of neon lamps include: *Pilot lamps that indicate the presence of electrical power in an appliance or instrument (e.g. an electric coffee pot or power supply). *Decorative (or \\"figural\\") lamps in which the cathode is shaped as a flower, animal, etc.. The figures inside these lamps were typically painted with phosphorescent paints to achieve a variety of colors. *Active electronic circuits such as electronic oscillators, timers, memory elements, etc.. *Intricate electronic displays such as the Nixie tube (see photograph). alt=Photograph of a flat panel displaying an aquarium; the aquarium has several fish swimming around, a gravel bottom, and decorative rocks and plants. The small size of the negative glow region of a neon lamp, and the flexible electronic properties that were exploited in electronic circuits, led to the adoption of this technology for the earliest plasma panel displays. The first monochrome dot matrix plasma panel displays were developed in 1964 at the University of Illinois for the PLATO educational computing system. They had the characteristic color of the neon lamp; their inventors, Donald L. Bitzer, H. Gene Slottow, and Robert H. Wilson, had achieved a working computer display that remembered its own state, and did not require constant refreshing from the central computer system. The relationship between these early monochrome displays and contemporary, color plasma displays and televisions was described by Larry F. Weber in 2006, \\"All plasma TVs on the market today have the same features that were demonstrated in the first plasma display which was a device with only a single cell. These features include alternating sustain voltage, dielectric layer, wall charge, and a neon-based gas mixture.\\" As in colored neon lamps, plasma displays use a gas mixture that emits ultraviolet light. Each pixel has a phosphor that emits one of the display's base colors. Neon lighting and artists in light The mid to late 1980s was a period of resurgence in neon production. Sign companies developed a new type of signage called channel lettering, in which individual letters were fashioned from sheet metal. While the market for neon lighting in outdoor advertising signage has declined since the mid twentieth century, in recent decades neon lighting has been used consciously in art, both in individual objects and integrated into architecture. Frank Popper traces the use of neon lighting as the principal element in artworks to Gyula Ko≈°ice's late 1940s work in Argentina. Among the later artists whom Popper notes in a brief history of neon lighting in art are Stephen Antonakos, the conceptual artists Joseph Kosuth and Bruce Nauman, Martial Raysse, Chryssa, Piotr Kowalski, Maurizio Nannucci and Fran√ßois Morellet in addition to Lucio Fontana or Mario Merz. Several museums in the United States are now devoted to neon lighting and art, including the Museum of Neon Art (founded by neon artist Lili Lakich, Los Angeles, 1981), the Neon Museum (Las Vegas, founded 1996), the American Sign Museum (Cincinnati, founded 1999). These museums restore and display historical signage that was originally designed as advertising, in addition to presenting exhibits of neon art. Several books of photographs have also been published to draw attention to neon lighting as art. A collection of photographs of neon signs from cities around the world, most unannotated. In 1994, Christian Schiess has published an anthology of photographs and interviews devoted to fifteen \\"light artists\\".

The ultimate goal of creating a machine exhibiting human-like behavior or intelligence is sometimes called strong AI. An example of the first objective is the project reported by Aston University in Birmingham, England where researchers are using biological cells to create \\"neurospheres\\" (small clusters of neurons) in order to develop new treatments for diseases including Alzheimer's, motor neurone and Parkinson's disease. The second objective is a reply to arguments such as John Searle's Chinese room argument, Hubert Dreyfus's critique of AI or Roger Penrose's argument in The Emperor's New Mind. These critics argued that there are aspects of human consciousness or expertise that can not be simulated by machines. One reply to their arguments is that the biological processes inside the brain can be simulated to any degree of accuracy. This reply was made as early as 1950, by Alan Turing in his classic paper \\"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\\". The third objective is generally called artificial general intelligence by researchers. However, Ray Kurzweil prefers the term \\"strong AI\\". In his book The Singularity is Near, he focuses on whole brain emulation using conventional computing machines as an approach to implementing artificial brains, and claims (on grounds of computer power continuing an exponential growth trend) that this could be done by 2025. Henry Markram, director of the Blue Brain project (which is attempting brain emulation), made a similar claim (2020) at the Oxford TED conference in 2009.  Approaches to brain simulation  Estimates of how much processing power is needed to emulate a human brain at various levels (from Ray Kurzweil, and Anders Sandberg and Nick Bostrom), along with the fastest supercomputer from TOP500 mapped by year. Although direct human brain emulation using artificial neural networks on a high-performance computing engine is a commonly discussed approach,see Artificial Intelligence System, CAM brain machine and cat brain for examples there are other approaches. An alternative artificial brain implementation could be based on Holographic Neural Technology (HNeT) non linear phase coherence/decoherence principles. The analogy has been made to quantum processes through the core synaptic algorithm which has strong similarities to the quantum mechanical wave equation. EvBrainJung, Sung Young, \\"A Topographical Development Method of Neural Networks for Artificial Brain Evolution\\" , Artificial Life, The MIT Press, vol. 11, issue 3 - summer, 2005, pp. 293-316 is a form of evolutionary software that can evolve \\"brainlike\\" neural networks, such as the network immediately behind the retina. In November 2008, IBM received a US$4.9 million grant from the Pentagon for research into creating intelligent computers. The Blue Brain project is being conducted with the assistance of IBM in Lausanne.Blue Brain in BBC News The project is based on the premise that it is possible to artificially link the neurons \\"in the computer\\" by placing thirty million synapses in their proper three-dimensional position. Some proponents of strong AI speculated in 2009 that computers in connection with Blue Brain and Soul Catcher may exceed human intellectual capacity by around 2015, and that it is likely that we will be able to download the human brain at some time around 2050. Jaap Bloem, Menno van Doorn, Sander Duivestein, Me the media: rise of the conversation society, VINT research Institute of Sogeti, 2009, p.273. While Blue Brain is able to represent complex neural connections on the large scale, the project does not achieve the link between brain activity and behaviors executed by the brain. In 2012, project Spaun (Semantic Pointer Architecture Unified Network) attempted to model multiple parts of the human brain through large-scale representations of neural connections that generate complex behaviors in addition to mapping., A Large-Scale Model of the Functioning Brain. Spaun's design recreates elements of human brain anatomy. The model, consisting of approximately 2.5 million neurons, includes features of the visual and motor cortices, GABAergic and dopaminergic connections, the ventral tegmental area (VTA), substantia nigra, and others. The design allows for several functions in response to eight tasks, using visual inputs of typed or handwritten characters and outputs carried out by a mechanical arm. Spaun's functions include copying a drawing, recognizing images, and counting. There are good reasons to believe that, regardless of implementation strategy, the predictions of realising artificial brains in the near future are optimistic. In particular brains (including the human brain) and cognition are not currently well understood, and the scale of computation required is unknown. Another near term limitation is that all current approaches for brain simulation require orders of magnitude larger power consumption compared with a human brain. The human brain consumes about 20 W of power, whereas current supercomputers may use as much as 1 MW‚Äîi.e., an order of 100,000 more.  Artificial brain thought experiment  Some critics of brain simulation believe that it is simpler to create general intelligent action directly without imitating nature. Some commentatorsFox and Hayes quoted in Nilsson, Nils (1998), Artificial Intelligence: A New Synthesis, p581 Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, have used the analogy that early attempts to construct flying machines modeled them after birds, but that modern aircraft do not look like birds.

He was a member of the Labor Party until 1996, when he resigned to sit as an independent following a dispute over his candidacy for Deputy President of the Senate. Colston was a schoolteacher before entering politics, and held a doctorate in educational psychology from the University of Queensland. Early life Colston was born in Brisbane and joined the Labor Party at the age of 19 and held several branch positions in the party. He was unsuccessfully nominated for selection as a Senate candidate at the age of 23. He qualified as a teacher and taught in several primary schools while he completed a doctorate in educational psychology at the University of Queensland. He failed on two further occasions to gain Senate selection. He later wrote a book, The Odd One Out, about his political experiences. Political career =Role in 1975 constitutional crisis= Colston indirectly played a role in the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis. On 30 June 1975, Queensland ALP Senator Bertie Milliner died suddenly. The Labor Party nominated Colston to fill the casual vacancy in the Senate. The Constitution provides that a Senate casual vacancy is filled by a person chosen by the relevant state parliament. Although not a constitutional requirement until 1977, it was long a convention for the state parliament to choose a person nominated by the departing Senator's political party. However, the Premier of Queensland, Joh Bjelke- Petersen, claimed that Colston was a \\"dangerous socialist\\" and refused to appoint him. Officially, though, Bjelke-Petersen expressed doubts over Colston's integrity and instead appointed Albert Field, a member of the Labor Party who was staunchly opposed to the policies of the Gough Whitlam Labor government.Turncoat turned into a footnote - Obituary in the Sydney Morning Herald, 26-Aug-2003 The ALP challenged Field's appointment in the High Court, and Field was on leave from the Senate almost from the day of his appointment. That gave the Coalition a greater advantage and so was one of the crucial events that led to the dismissal of the Whitlam government. =Labor Senator= At the ensuing 1975 election, Colston was elected as a Labor senator. He continued to serve in that capacity until 1996. From 1993 to his retirement, he was a joint Father of the Senate, along with Brian Harradine. =Resignation from Labor Party= After the 1996 election, the Labor Party refused to nominate Colston to become Deputy President of the Senate, a position he had previously held from 1990 to 1993. In a bid to win him over, the Howard Coalition government offered to support him. Colston resigned from the Labor Party by fax message at 11:30 a.m., on 20 August, and he took his seat as an independent that afternoon. In the evening, he was elected Deputy President, on the nomination of the Coalition. He opposed the Coalition's industrial relations package, but he voted for the sale of a third of Telstra and some other government initiatives. Colston then sat as a \\"Queensland First\\" senator. =Travel allowances scandal= In 1997, Colston was charged by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions with 28 charges of defrauding the Commonwealth by allegedly misusing his parliamentary travel allowance. He then revealed that he was suffering from cancer. Prosecution was not pursued after medical opinion was provided that Colston was unlikely to live long enough for a trial to be completed. In the event, he survived for a further six years. He retired from the Senate at the end of his term. Death and estate Colston died of colon cancer in 2003. He had appointed his wife, Dawn Colston, as executor and trustee of his will, but she died eleven months later, before she could dispose of her husband's will. She had appointed her brother, Brian McMullen, as executor of her will. The Colstons' son, Douglas Colston, then initiated legal action against McMullen and claimed that he was entitled to half the income of his parents' estates. The case was ongoing, as of September 2011.

In the Middle Ages, the Jewish traveller Benjamin of Tudela identified Zeila (or Zawilah) with the Biblical location of Havilah.Fran√ßois-Xavier Fauvelle-Aymar, \\"Desperately Seeking the Jewish Kingdom of Ethiopia: Benjamin of Tudela and the Horn of Africa (Twelfth Century)\\", Speculum, 88.2 (2013): 383‚Äì404. Most modern scholars identify it with the site of Avalites mentioned in the 1st-century Greco-Roman travelogue the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea and in Ptolemy, although this is disputed.G. W. B. Huntingford (ed.), The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, by an Unknown Author: With Some Extracts from Agatharkhides ‚ÄòOn the Erythraean Sea‚Äô (Ashgate, 1980), p. 90.Lionel Casson (ed.), The Periplus Maris Erythraei: Text with Introduction, Translation and Commentary (Princeton University Press, 1989), pp. 116‚Äì17. Avalites may be Assab or a village named Abalit near Obock. The town evolved into an early Islamic center with the arrival of Muslims shortly after the hegira. By the 9th century, Zeila was the capital of the early Adal Kingdom and Ifat Sultanate in the 13th century; and also a capital for its successor state the Adal Sultanate, it would attain its height of prosperity a few centuries later in the 16th century. The city subsequently came under Ottoman and British protection in the 18th century. Geography Zeila is situated in the Awdal region in Somaliland. Located on the Gulf of Aden coast near the Djibouti border, the town sits on a sandy spit surrounded by the sea. It is known for its coral reef, mangroves and offshore islands, which include the Sa'ad ad-Din archipelago named after the Somali Sultan Sa'ad ad-Din II of the Sultanate of Ifat. Landward, the terrain is unbroken desert for some fifty miles. Borama lies southeast of Zeila, Berbera lies east of Zeila, while the city of Harar in Ethiopia is to the west. History =Avalites= During antiquity Zeila was part of the Somali city-states that in engaged in a lucrative trade network connecting Somali merchants with Phoenicia, Ptolemaic Egypt, Greece, Parthian Persia, Saba, Nabataea, and the Roman Empire. Somali sailors used the ancient Somali maritime vessel known as the beden to transport their cargo.Journal of African History pg.50 by John Donnelly Fage and Roland Anthony Oliver Several locations for Havilah are shown, including the Zeila region Zeila is an ancient city, and has been identified with what was referred to in classical antiquity as the town of Avalites (), situated in the erstwhile Barbara geographical region on the northern Somali coast. Along with the neighboring Habash (Habesha or Abyssinians) of Al-Habash to the west, the Barbaroi or Berber (ancestral Somalis) who inhabited the area are recorded in the 1st century CE Greek document the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea as engaging in extensive commercial exchanges with Egypt and pre-Islamic Arabia. The travelogue mentions the Barbaroi trading frankincense, among various other commodities, through their port cities such as Avalites (modern Zeila). Competent seamen, the Periplus' author also indicates that they sailed throughout the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for trade. The document describes the Barbaroi's system of governance as decentralized, and essentially consisting of a collection of autonomous city-states.Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, Culture and Customs of Somalia, (Greenwood Press, 2001), pp.13‚Äì14 It also suggests that \\"the Berbers who live in the place are very unruly\\",Wilfred Harvey Schoff, The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea: travel and trade in the Indian Ocean, (Longmans, Green, and Co., 1912) p.25 an apparent reference to their independent streak. =Adal kingdom= Islam was introduced to the area early on from the Arabian Peninsula, shortly after the hegira. Zeila's two-mihrab Masjid al-Qiblatayn dates to the 7th century, and is the oldest mosque in the city. In the late 9th century, Al-Yaqubi wrote that Muslims were living along the northern Somali seaboard. He also mentioned that the Adal kingdom had its capital in the city, suggesting that the Adal Sultanate with Zeila as its headquarters dates back to at least the 9th or 10th centuries. According to I.M. Lewis, the polity was governed by local dynasties consisting of Somalized Arabs or Arabized Somalis, who also ruled over the similarly-established Sultanate of Mogadishu in the Benadir region to the south. Adal's history from this founding period forth would be characterized by a succession of battles with neighbouring Abyssinia. Sultanate of Adal in Zeila, Somalia By the year of (1214-17), Ibn Said referred to both Zeila and Berbera. Zeila, as he tells us, was a wealthy city of considerable size and its inhabitants were completely Muslims. Ibn Said's description gives the impression that Berbera was of much more localized importance, mainly serving the immediate Somali, hinterland while Zeila was clearly serving more extensive areas. But there is no doubt that Zeila was also predominantly Somali, and Al-Dimashqi, another thirteen- century Arab writer, gives the city name its Somali name Awdal (Adal), still known among the local Somali. By the fourteen century, the significance of this Somali port for the Ethiopian interior increased so much so that all the Muslim communities established along the trade routes into central and south- eastern Ethiopia were commonly known in Egypt and Syria by the collective term of \\"the country of Zeila\\". In the following century, the Moroccan historian and traveller Ibn Battuta describes the city being inhabited by Somalis, followers of the Shafi‚Äòi school, who kept large numbers of camels, sheep and goats. His description thus indicates both the ingenious nature of the city, as indicated by the composition of its population, and, by implication through the presence of the livestock, the existence of the nomads in its vicinity. He also describes Zeila as a big metropolis city and many great markets filled with many wealthy merchants. Through extensive trade with Abyssinia and Arabia, Adal attained its height of prosperity during the 14th century.I. M. Lewis, A pastoral democracy: a study of pastoralism and politics among the Northern Somali of the Horn of Africa, (LIT Verlag M√ºnster: 1999), p.17 It sold incense, myrrh, slaves, gold, silver and camels, among many other commodities. Zeila had by then started to grow into a huge multicultural metropolis, with Somalis (Predominantly), Afar, Harari, and even Arabs and Persian inhabitants. The city was also instrumental in bringing Islam to the Oromo and other Ethiopian ethnic groups.Rayne, Henry A. Sun, sand and somals : leaves from the note-book of a district commissioner in British Somaliland. London : Witherby. (1921). https://archive.org/stream/sunsandsomalslea00raynuoft/sunsandsomalslea00raynuoft_djvu.txt I.M. Lewis gives an invaluable reference to an Arabic Manuscript on the history of to the Gadabursi Somal. \\"This Chronicle opens\\", Lewis tells us, ‚Äòwith an account of the wars of Imam ‚ÄòAli Si‚Äôid (1392), from whom the Gadabuursi today trace their descent, and who is described as the only Muslim leader fighting on the western flank in the armies of Se‚Äôad ad-Din, ruler of Zeila.‚Äô Se‚Äôad ad-Din was the joint founder of the Kingdom of Adal along with his brother Haqedin II. In 1332, the Zeila-based King of Adal was slain in a military campaign aimed at halting the Abyssinian Emperor Amda Seyon's march toward the city. When the last Sultan of Ifat, Sa'ad ad-Din II, was also killed by Dawit I of Ethiopia in Zeila in 1410, his children escaped to Yemen, before later returning in 1415. In the early 15th century, Adal's capital was moved further inland to the town of Dakkar, where Sabr ad-Din II, the eldest son of Sa'ad ad-Din II, established a new base after his return from Yemen. Adal's headquarters were again relocated the following century, this time to Harar. From this new capital, Adal organised an effective army led by Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi (Ahmad \\"Gurey\\" or \\"Gran\\") that invaded the Abyssinian empire. This campaign is historically known as the Conquest of Abyssinia (Futuh al Habash). During the war, Imam Ahmad pioneered the use of cannons supplied by the Ottoman Empire, which he imported through Zeila and deployed against Abyssinian forces and their Portuguese allies led by Crist√≥v√£o da Gama. Some scholars argue that this conflict proved, through their use on both sides, the value of firearms like the matchlock musket, cannons and the arquebus over traditional weapons.Jeremy Black, Cambridge Illustrated Atlas, Warfare: Renaissance to Revolution, 1492‚Äì1792, (Cambridge University Press: 1996), p.9. Travellers' reports, such as the memoirs of the Italian Ludovico di Varthema, indicate that Zeila continued to be an important marketplace during the 16th century,\\"There is an abundance of provisions in this city, and there are many merchants here.\\" The Travels of Ludovico di Varthema in Egypt, Syria, Arabia Deserta and Arabia Felix, in Persia, India, and Ethiopia, A.D. 1503 to 1508, translated by John Winter Jone, and edited by George Percy Badger (London: the Hakluyt Society, 1863), p. 87 despite being sacked by the Portuguese in 1517 and 1528. Later that century, separate raids by nomads from the interior eventually prompted the port's then ruler, Garad Lado, to enlist the services of 'Atlya ibn Muhammad to construct a sturdy wall around the city. Zeila, however, ultimately began to decline in importance following the short-lived conquest of Abyssinia. 16th century Zeila, along with several other settlements on the East African coast, had been visited by the Portuguese explorer and writer Duarte Barbosa, describing the city as such: \\"Having passed this town of Berbara, and going on, entering the Red Sea, there is another town of the Moors, which is named Zeyla, which is a good place of trade, whither many ships navigate and sell their cloths and merchandise. It is very populous, with good houses of stone and white-wash, and good streets ; the houses are covered with terraces, the dwellers in them are black. They have many horses, and breed much cattle of all sorts, which they make use of for milk, and butter, and meat. There is in this country abundance of wheat, millet, barley, and fruits, which they carry thence to Aden.\\" Dames, L., 1918: The Book of Duarte Barbosa London: Hakluyt Society =Yemenite period= Beginning in 1630, the city became a dependency of the ruler of Mocha, who, for a small sum, leased the port to one of the office- holders of Mocha. The latter in return collected a toll on its trade. Zeila was subsequently ruled by an Emir, whom Mordechai Abir suggested had \\"some vague claim to authority over all of the sahil, but whose real authority did not extend very far beyond the walls of the town.\\" Assisted by cannons and a few mercenaries armed with matchlocks, the governor succeeded in fending off incursions by both the disunited nomads of the interior, who had penetrated the area, as well as brigands in the Gulf of Aden. Abir defines the sahil as \\"the coast\\", which stretched from the Gulf of Tadjoura to Cape Guardafui By the first half of the 19th century, Zeila was a shadow of its former self, having been reduced to \\"a large village surrounded by a low mud wall, with a population that varied according to the season from 1,000 to 3,000 people.\\"Abir, Era of the Princes, p. 14 The city continued to serve as the principal maritime outlet for Harar and beyond it in Shewa. However, the opening of a new sea route between Tadjoura and Shewa cut further into Zeila's historic position as the main regional port.Abir, Era of the Princes, p. 16 =Ottoman period= Although part of the Ottoman Empire since 1559, between 1821 and 1841, Muhammad Ali, Pasha of Egypt, came to control Yemen and the sahil, with Zeila included.E. H. M. Clifford, \\"The British Somaliland-Ethiopia Boundary\\", Geographical Journal, 87 (1936), p. 289 Haj Ali Shermerki came to govern Zeila after the Turkish governor of Mocha and Hodeida handed governorship from Mohamed El Barr to the Shermerki. Shermerki was a successful and ambitious Somali merchant. Shermerki's governorship had an instant effect on the city, as he maneuvered to monopolize as much of the regional trade as possible, with his sights set as far as Harar and the Ogaden. In 1845, Shermerki deployed a few matchlock men to wrest control of neighboring Berbera from that town's then feuding Somali authorities. This alarmed the Emir of Harar, who, having already been at loggerheads with Shermerki over fiscal matters, was concerned about the ramifications that these movements might ultimately have on his own city's commerce. The Emir consequently urged Berbera's leaders to reconcile and mount a resistance against Shermerki's troops. Shermerki was later succeeded as Governor of Zeila by Abu Bakr Pasha, a local Afar statesman.I.M. Lewis, A Modern History of the Somali, fourth edition (Oxford: James Currey, 2002), p.43 & 49 Zeila waterfront in 1877, by an Italian visitor In 1874‚Äì75, the Egyptians obtained a firman from the Ottomans by which they secured claims over the city. At the same time, the Egyptians received British recognition of their nominal jurisdiction as far east as Cape Guardafui. In actuality, however, Egypt had little authority over the interior and their period of rule on the coast was brief, lasting only a few years (1870‚Äì84). When the Egyptian garrison in Harar was evacuated in 1885, Zeila became caught up in the competition between the Tadjoura-based French and the British for control of the strategic Gulf of Aden littoral. I. M. Lewis mentions that \\"by the end of 1885 Britain was preparing to resist an expected French landing at Zeila.\\" However, the two powers decided instead to turn to negotiations. =British Somaliland= Zeila in 1885 Buralleh (Buralli) Robleh, Sub-Inspector of Police of Zeila, and General Gordon, Governor of British Somaliland, in Zeila (1921). On 9 February 1888, France and Britain concluded an agreement defining the boundary between their respective protectorates.Simon Imbert-Vier, Fronti√®res et limites √† Djibouti durant la p√©riode coloniale (1884‚Äì1977), Universit√© de Provence, Aix- Marseille, 2008, p. 81. As a result, Zeila and its eastern neighbor Berbera came to be part of British Somaliland. The construction of a railway from Djibouti to Addis Ababa in the late 19th century continued the neglect of Zeila. At the beginning of the next century, the city was described in the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica as having a \\"good sheltered anchorage much frequented by Arab sailing craft. However, heavy draught steamers are obliged to anchor a mile and a half from the shore. Small coasting boats lie off the pier and there is no difficulty in loading or discharging cargo. The water supply of the town is drawn from the wells of Takosha, about three miles distant; every morning camels, in charge of old Somali women and bearing goatskins filled with water, come into the town in picturesque procession. ... [Zeila's] imports, which reach Zaila chiefly via Aden, are mainly cotton goods, rice, jowaree, dates and silk; the exports, 90% of which are from Abyssinia, are principally coffee, skins, ivory, cattle, ghee and mother-of- pearl\\". Buralle Robleh the subinspector of police of Zeila was described by Major Rayne as one of the most important men in Zeila along with 2 others. He is featured on the image to the right with his excellency General Gordon, Governor of British Somaliland. In August 1940, Zeila was captured by advancing Italian troops. It would remain under their occupation for over six months. =Present= In the post-independence period, Zeila was administered as part of the official Awdal region of Somaliland. Following the outbreak of the civil war in the early 1990s, much of the city's historic infrastructure was destroyed and many residents left the area. However, remittance funds sent by relatives abroad have contributed toward reconstruction of the town, as well as the local trade and fishing industries. Demographics An old map of Zeila featuring the Gadabuursi and Issa subclans of the Dir clan family. The town of Zeila is primarily inhabited by people from the Somali ethnic group, with the Gadabuursi subclan of the Dir especially well represented.Samatar, Abdi I. (2001) \\"Somali Reconstruction and Local Initiative: Amoud University,\\" , p. 132. The Issa subclan of the Dir are especially well represented in the wider Zeila District. Tim Glawion (2020) describes the clan demographics of both the town of Zeila and the wider Zeila District: > \\"Three distinct circles can be distinguished based on the way the security > arena is composed in and around Zeila: first, Zeila town, the administrative > centre, which is home to many government institutions and where the mostly > ethnic Gadabuursi/Samaron inhabitants engage in trading or government > service activities; second, Tokhoshi, an artisanal salt mining area eight > kilometres west of Zeila, where a mixture of clan and state institutions > provide security and two large ethnic groups (Ciise and Gadabuursi/Samaron) > live alongside one another; third the southern rural areas, which are almost > universally inhabited by the Ciise clan, with its long, rigid culture of > self-rule.\\" Elis√©e Reclus (1886) describes the two main ancient routes leading from Harar to Zeila, one route passing through the country of the Gadabuursi and one route passing through Issa territory. The author describes the town of Zeila and its immediate environs as being inhabited by the Gadabuursi, whereas the wider Zeila District and countryside south of the town, as being traditional Issa clan territory: > \\"Two routes, often blocked by the inroads of plundering hordes, lead from > Harrar to Zeila. One crosses a ridge to the north of the town, thence > redescending into the basin of the Awash by the Galdessa Pass and valley, > and from this point running towards the sea through Issa territory, which is > crossed by a chain of trachytic rocks trending southwards. The other and > more direct but more rugged route ascends north-eastwards towards the Darmi > Pass, crossing the country of the Gadibursis or Gudabursis. The town of > Zeila lies south of a small archipelago of islets and reefs on a point of > the coast where it is hemmed in by the Gadibursi tribe. It has two ports, > one frequented by boats but impracticable for ships, whilst the other, not > far south of the town, although very narrow, is from 26 to 33 feet deep, and > affords safe shelter to large craft.\\" References Further reading * T.

UKMA argues that the continued use of two incompatible systems of measurement causes misunderstanding, confusion and mistakes, undermines consumer protection, wastes time during children's education, results in additional costs, and is against the national interest. History Original UKMA logo used prior to 2012 with the italic m. It was changed to the upright Roman m due to style guides which forbid the use of italics for metric symbols to avoid confusion with other scientific symbols. UKMA was founded by Chris Keenan in 1999 and formally associated in 2002 as an independent, non-party political, single- issue organisation. Later, an e-mail forum was started for supporters of metrication. In 2005, a website called ThinkMetric to help and encourage the general public to think in metric units was launched. In 2006, a blog called MetricViews was launched. The current secretary of UKMA is Derek Pollard. Political patrons include Lord Kinnock (Lab), Dr Nick Palmer (Lab) and Ian Taylor (Con). Strategies One of UKMA's strategies, aimed at getting their message to a wider audience including journalists and researchers, is to use Wikipedia as a conduit for their information. In an article in their December 2008 newsletter, members were urged to \\"correct any inaccuracies\\" in Wikipedia articles. It told about the \\"bias and inaccuracy\\" in metrication related articles, including Metrication in the United Kingdom, and highlighted the importance of \\"keeping an eye on them [metrication articles], visiting them regularly and checking that nobody has reversed any changes that you have made.\\" Publications UKMA has released four major reports, aimed at stimulating discussion in Britain about completing the transition to international standard units: *very British mess (, 2004) is a survey of the use of units in the United Kingdom and the ways in which confusion can arise from the simultaneous use of two systems. It has also been used as a campaign slogan similarly. *signs ahead (, 2006) from February 2006 focuses on road signs, the last major area where current UK legislation mandates the use of miles, yards, feet and inches. The report estimates that the total cost of switching all of the UK's estimated 500,000 traffic signs from miles, yards and miles per hour to kilometres, metres and kilometres per hour would be ¬£80 million (¬£160 per sign, including installation), of which ¬£20 million would be for 200,000 speed limit signs. It argues that while, for safety reasons, all speed signs would have to be changed during a very short transition period (a few days), other road signs and markings that indicate distances or height restrictions could be changed more gradually, often in the course of routine maintenance. *a Mess was published in 2014 and shows the results of a measurement unit survey commissioned by UKMA and carried out by YouGov to explore a number of aspects of public attitudes regarding measurement units in the UK, including people's understand of the relationship between different measurement units, what units people typically use for various purposes, level of support for the completion of the metric changeover and what impact party policies on metrication would have on how people will vote in elections. *Dimension Signs Report was published in May 2014 and focuses on the progress in implementing dual signage for width, height and length vehicle dimension signs on British roads. It looks at the current situation with imperial-only and dual vehicle dimension signage, reviews of current practice and suggests improvements. It includes a survey of UK highway authorities on dimension signs and its results. It asks these authorities about current regulations, knowledge of current signage and plans for improvement. In 2009, UKMA published an update to Signs Ahead, which reflects the changes that have happened since the publication of the Metric Signs Ahead report. In the same year, UKMA published a traffic signs leaflet called Signs 2.0, which recommends changes to UK road signs to improve clarity, legibility and safety by using universally understood symbols and units of measurement. Opposition The aims of UKMA contrast with those of the British Weights and Measures Association (BWMA), which campaigns against compulsory Metrication in the United Kingdom and advocates the continued use of imperial measures.

The permanent exhibition of the Christian Museum is situated on the second floor of the Primate's Palace in Esztergom- V√≠ziv√°ros, on the bank of the Danube river. The extensive collections of Hungarian, Italian, Dutch, German and Austrian paintings make this museum the third most important picture gallery in Hungary. Many works of art come from the territory of present-day Slovakia in which area part of the archdiocese of Esztergom lay at the time of the formation of the collection (the 1870s). Besides late medieval and Renaissance works of art ‚Äî including the Calvary Altarpiece by Thomas of Coloswar, the Lord's Coffin from Garamszentbenedek, and the Passion scenes by Master MS ‚Äî the baroque and modern collections, the collection of the decorative arts, and the collection of prints and drawings are significant.

The first exhibition installed on the upper floor of the Cathedral Library included 206 pictures, mainly late medieval and 19th-century works. The Archbishop greatly enlarged his collection in the following years. His most significant purchase was that of the Bertinelli collection in Rome in 1878, when the Museum acquired sixty, mainly Italian Renaissance paintings. Further important acquisitions were the wooden sculptures and works of applied art bought in 1884 from the Schn√ºtgen Collection in Cologne. After 1882, the enlarged collection was transferred to the second floor of the newly rebuilt Primate‚Äôs Palace on the Danube bank, where it is still located. In 1887, Simor ensured the future of the collection by entrusting it to the care of the Cathedral chapter of Esztergom. After World War I, the Museum was enriched with two large collections: in 1920 with the collection of Arnold Ipolyi, Bishop of Oradea (1823‚Äì1886), which consisted mainly of late medieval Italian, German, Austrian and Hungarian paintings and sculptures, and in 1925 with Count San Marco's bequest, which primarily contained works of applied arts and paintings.

The trench extends for from a triple junction in the west with the Ulakhan Fault and the northern end of the Kuril‚ÄìKamchatka Trench, to a junction with the northern end of the Queen Charlotte Fault system in the east. It is classified as a \\"marginal trench\\" in the east as it runs along the margin of the continent. The subduction along the trench gives rise to the Aleutian Arc, a volcanic island arc, where it runs through the open sea west of the Alaska Peninsula. As a convergent plate boundary, the trench forms part of the boundary between two tectonic plates. Here, the Pacific Plate is being subducted under the North American Plate at a dip angle of nearly 45¬∞. The rate of closure is per year. Trench morphology The north side of the trench slopes 3¬∞‚Äì4¬∞ and the south side 1¬∞‚Äì4¬∞. The deepest part of the Aleutian trench has been measured at at 51.21¬∞N, 174.83¬∞E., located about SSW of Buldir Island. Center pressure: . Variations in total magnetic intensity (residual) of more than 600 Œ≥ (600 nanoteslas) were found in the center of the trench and more than 1100 Œ≥ on the southern flank. Associated seismicity The subduction of the Pacific Plate below the North American Plate along the Aleutian Trench is associated with numerous earthquakes. Several of these earthquakes are notable for their size and/or associated tsunamis. *April 1, 1946 Aleutian Islands earthquake: This magnitude 8.6 earthquake occurred offshore Unimak Island,USGS - Historic Earthquakes, Unimak Island and caused only minor damage on land.

In recent times, the physical paycheck has been increasingly replaced by electronic direct deposits to the employee's designated bank account or loaded onto a payroll card. Employees may still receive a pay slip to detail the calculations of the final payment amount. A salary statement, commonly called a payslip, pay stub, paystub, pay advice, or sometimes paycheck stub or wage slip, is a document that an employee receives either as a notice that the direct deposit transaction has gone through or that is attached to the paycheck. Each country has laws as to what must be included on a payslip, but this typically includes details of the gross wages for the pay period and the taxes and any other deductions the employer is required to make by law as well as other personal deductions such as retirement plan or pension contributions, insurances, garnishments, or charitable contributions taken out of the gross amount to arrive at the final net amount of the pay, also including the year to date totals in some circumstances. Electronic paychecks In most countries with a developed wire transfer system, payment of wages and salaries is increasingly being effected by electronic means, rather than by the use of a physical cheque. This saves the company money on printing and processing cheques and reduce the problem of fraud. However, vocabulary referring to the figurative \\"pay cheque\\" persists in some languages, but this commonly refers to a payslip or stub rather than an actual cheque. Some company payrolls have eliminated both the paper cheque and stub, in which case an electronic image of the stub is available on a website. Most of the provinces and territories in Canada allow employers to issue electronic payslips if the employees have confidential access to it and are able to print it. Payroll card For employees that do not have access to a personal bank account, most major payroll service providers can arrange for the net pay of an employee to be loaded onto a payroll card, which is a plastic card similar to a debit card. A payroll card functions like a debit card and allows an employee to access their pay. A payroll card is typically less convenient than cashing a paper paycheck, because the card can be used at participating automatic teller machines to withdraw cash (which usually requires the employee to pay a hefty fee to access their own money and always have daily limits for how much of their own money an employee can access daily) or in stores to make purchases. Most payroll cards will charge a fee if used at an ATM more than once per pay period. The payroll card account may be held as a single bank account in the employer's name. In that case, the bank account holds the payroll funds for all employees of that company using the payroll card system, and an intermediary limits each employee's draw to an amount specified by the company for a specified pay period. Some payroll card programs establish a separate account for each employee. Most payroll card accounts in the United States are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Before a company can give a payroll card to a worker, the business must first contract with a payroll card program manager. The payroll card company performs required \\"know-your-customer\\" due diligence as a condition of accepting the application. In the United States, payroll cards are regulated by state wage- and-hour-laws and by a variety of federal laws including the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and the Consumer Financial Protection Act. Businesses may elect to use a payroll card program in order to reduce payroll expense. According to VISA, it costs an employer about 35 cents to issue pay electronically but two dollars to write a paper paycheck. Payroll warrants Payroll warrants look like cheques and clear through the banking system like checks and are therefore often called paychecks by their recipients. But they are not checks because they are not drawn against a checking account. Instead they are drawn against \\"available funds\\" that are not in a bank account so the issuer can delay redemption. In the U.S., warrants are issued by government entities such as the military and state and county governments for payroll to individuals and for accounts payable to vendors. Deposited warrants are routed to a collecting bank which processes them as collection items like maturing treasury bills and presents the warrants to the government entity's treasury department for payment each business day. In the UK, warrants are issued as payment by National Savings and Investments when a premium bond is chosen.

Their name is also spelled R√°koci (in Slovakia), Rakoczi and Rakoczy in some foreign (English) sources. The family was named after R√°k√≥c (Rakovec, now Rakovec nad Ondavou, Slovakia). The family originated from the Bog√°tradv√°ny clan which had Bohemian roots, according to Simon of K√©za's chronicle. The foundations for the family's wealth and power were laid down by Sigismund R√°k√≥czi; some decades into the 17th century, the R√°k√≥czis became the wealthiest aristocrats of Hungary. Family legacy The last member of the family was Gy√∂rgy (George) R√°k√≥czi, the son of Francis II R√°k√≥czi, who died in France in 1756. The mysterious Count of St. Germain is believed by some to have been the son of Prince Francis (Ferenc) II R√°k√≥czi. The R√°k√≥czi March by J√°nos Bihari and (memorably orchestrated by Hector Berlioz) refers to them. The Hungarian Rhapsody No. 15 by Franz Liszt refers to the rebellion led by Francis II R√°k√≥czi. History =Sigismund R√°k√≥czi= Sigismund R√°k√≥czi briefly reigned as Prince of Transylvania from 1607 to 1608. =George R√°k√≥czi I= George R√°k√≥czi I (Born June 8, 1593, Szerencs ‚Äì Oct. 11, 1648) was the prince of Transylvania from 1630. In 1643, R√°k√≥czi formed an alliance with Sweden. In February 1644, leading a 30,000-man army, he launched a campaign against the Habsburgs in the Thirty Years War. Peasants who struggled for national liberation in the Kingdom of Hungary supported him. He also encouraged the development of the mining industry and commerce.George I, The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 1979 =George R√°k√≥czi II= George R√°k√≥czi II (30 January 1621, Hungary ‚Äì June 7, 1660) was a Hungarian nobleman and prince of Transylvania (1648-1660). In 1657, he led an army of 40,000 men against King John II Casimir of Poland in the third part of the Second Northern War (1655-1660). He took Krak√≥w and entered Warsaw with the Swedes, but the moment his allies withdrew, he was defeated by the Poles at Czarny Ostr√≥w. Finally, the Poles allowed him to return to Transylvania. When the Turks invaded Transylvania, he died at the battle of Gyalu (GilƒÉu) (May 1660). =Francis R√°k√≥czi I= Francis R√°k√≥czi I (February 24, 1645, Gyulafeh√©rv√°r, Transylvania ‚Äì July 8, 1676, Zbor√≥, Royal Hungary) was the elected prince of Transylvania and Hungarian aristocrat. He was the son of George II R√°k√≥czi, who was the prince of Transylvania, though George transferred his power to his son in 1652 through the Transylvanian Diet. However, Francis was never able to occupy this role because the Ottoman government prohibited R√°k√≥czi inheritance of the Transylvanian throne in 1660. Francis therefore lived as an aristocrat in Royal Hungary. In terms of religion, Francis I broke with the Calvinist R√°k√≥czi tradition by converting to Catholicism in imitation of his mother, Zs√≥fia B√°thori, which gained him favor with the Catholic Habsburg Court. Francis I married Croatian-Hungarian countess Ilona Zr√≠nyi in 1666 and had three children, Gy√∂rgy (1667); Julianna Borb√°la (1672‚Äì1717); and Francis II (1676‚Äì1735). He soon joined the Wesselenyi Conspiracy as a result of his marriage to Zr√≠nyi. He became the leader of this group and attempted to stage an uprising among Hungarian nobles, but this was poorly organized and was soon crushed by the Austrian government. =Francis II R√°k√≥czi= Francis R√°k√≥czi II (March 27, 1676, Borsi, Hungary - April 8, 1735, Rodusto, Turkey), also known as Ferenc II R√°k√≥czi, was the prince of Transylvania and leader of the last major Hungarian uprising against Austria until 1848. He is celebrated as a national hero in Hungary. Francis was raised by Austrian standards and attended a Jesuit college in Bohemia, though he was majorly influenced by the nationalist fervor of his family growing up. Francis returned to his estates in Hungary in 1694 and was elected prince of Transylvania in 1704.Ferenc R√°k√≥czi II, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, n.d. Around the turn of the 18th century, French monarch Louis XIV sought R√°k√≥czi's help in his attempt to reduce Austrian power and promised to aid R√°k√≥czi in return for an attempt at Hungarian independence. However, Rakoczi was arrested in 1700 after an Austrian spy alerted the emperor. He escaped to Poland and at the start of the War of the Spanish Succession, he led a Kuruc uprising in an attempt to gain Hungarian independence, leading to the War for Independence. However, the war failed, and Francis left Hungary forever in 1711, living in Turkey. He is commemorated by statues and monuments throughout Hungary, as well as in the R√°k√≥czi March. Major events =War for Independence= In 1678, anti- Habsburg revolutionaries led by Imre Th√∂k√∂ly and aided by Louis XIV of France and the Ottomans rose in uprising against the Habsburgs. After the failed Battle of Vienna in 1683, Th√∂k√∂ly lost support and was defeated in 1685. Around 1700, Louis XIV reached out again, this time to Francis II R√°k√≥czi, in his attempt to mitigate Austrian power. Francis was arrested for this correspondence but eventually escaped to Poland. The War of the Spanish Succession forced much of the Austrian army to leave Hungary, creating an opportunity to revolt. The Kurucs, or the anti-Habsburg rebels, began an uprising headed by R√°k√≥czi. However, very few nobles supported the revolution. Additionally, Austrian military victories over the French and the Bavarians caused aid to the revolution to falter. By 1706, R√°k√≥czi was forced to retreat. Peace negotiations were largely unsuccessful, and Hungarian defeat at the Battle of Trencs√©n solidified Austrian victory.McKay, John P. and Others.

He was appointed brigade general in 1943 and half-a-year later flew from occupied Poland to London.Rados≈Çaw \\"Butryk\\"\\" Butry≈Ñski, Stanis≈Çaw Tatar, Polska Podziemna, 2005-2007. Retrieved January 4, 2013. After the war ended, Tatar betrayed the London-based Polish government-in-exile by organising an illegal handover of its vast reserves of money and gold (donated by the nation and called the Fund of National Defense), to the communist regime. The first batch of money was stolen en route by a consul in 1945, yet Tatar went on with his plan in 1947. He came back to Poland in 1949 on the promise of military leadership with LWP, only to be arrested and falsely accused of conspiracy against the party by the Stalinist secret police (UrzƒÖd Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa). Subsequently, Tatar was tried and sentenced to life imprisonment in the so- called Trial of the Generals, but released from prison during Polish October of 1956. Biography Stanis≈Çaw Tatar was born October 2, 1896 in Bi√≥rk√≥w Wielki village in Lesser Poland. In 1915, during World War I, he was conscripted to the tsarist Russian Army. In 1917 he was transferred to the 1st Polish Corps formed in Russia. In November 1918, together with the remnants of his unit, he joined the renascent sovereign Polish Army. During the interbellum he continued serving in the military. Having finished numerous officer courses, in 1934 he became one of the tutors of artillery tactics at the Higher War School (Wy≈ºsza Szko≈Ça Wojenna) in Warsaw. He held that post until 1938, given the Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. During the Invasion of Poland he served at various posts, including the command over a military detachment named after him. After the Polish defeat he evaded being captured by the Germans and Soviets and joined the newly formed ZwiƒÖzek Walki Zbrojnej (ZWZ), the biggest resistance organisation, that eventually transformed itself into the Home Army. From 1940 to 1943 he served as the head of the 3rd detachment (Operational) of the general staff. After 1943 he also served as the deputy chief of staff of the entire Home Army. Among his most notable achievements was creation of the plans for Operation Tempest. In 1944, shortly before the Warsaw Uprising, he was transferred to London, where he assumed the post of deputy commander in chief for home matters. After the end of World War II in 1945 he became the commander of artillery of the 1st Polish Corps in the United Kingdom. After it was disbanded in 1947 he remained in the UK. =Fundusz Obrony Narodowej affair= In July 1947 Tatar organized the secret transfer to Poland from the London-based Polish government-in-exile of the treasury of the prewar Fund of National Defense (Fundusz Obrony Narodowej, FON). The new Polish government promised to use it to help veterans. Already in 1945 on advice of Jerzy Putrament, Tatar gave Polish communists 100,000 dollars and a hundred gold coins stolen en route to Poland by consul Sobolewski who vanished. The 1947 shipment consisted of gold bars (350 kg) and $2.5 million in gold and silver coins. The 10 metal containers were brought to Warsaw on the 3rd and 13 July by Col. Leon Szwajcer i Pola Landau-Leder from the embassy.

Upon his arrival to Warsaw, however, he was arrested by the Soviet NKVD, imprisoned and charged with espionage. As a victim of the Generals' Trial (show trial) of 1951 he was sentenced to life imprisonment and imprisoned in Wronki Prison. After Joseph Stalin's death and the start of a period of liberalisation in Poland in 1956 he was released from prison and rehabilitated. Tatar died in 1980.

It is found in various tissues, most prominently the corpus cavernosum and the retina. It has also been recently discovered to play a vital role in the cardiovascular system. The phosphodiesterase (PDE) isozymes, found in several tissues including the rod and cone photoreceptor cells of the retina, belong to a large family of cyclic nucleotide PDEs that catalyze cAMP and cGMP hydrolysis. The interest in PDEs as molecular targets of drug action has grown with the development of isozyme-selective PDE inhibitors that offer potent inhibition of selected isozymes without the side- effects attributed to nonselective inhibitors such as theophylline. Sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil, and avanafil are PDE5 inhibitors that are significantly more potent and selective than zaprinast and other early PDE5 inhibitors.  Action of PDE5  PDE5 is an enzyme that accepts cGMP and breaks it down. Sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil are inhibitors of this enzyme, which bind to the catalytic site of PDE5. Both inhibitors bind with high affinity and specificity, and cGMP-binding to the allosteric sites stimulates binding of PDE5 inhibitors at the catalytic site. The kinetics of inhibitor binding and inhibition of catalysis imply the existence of two PDE5 conformers, and results of native gel electrophoresis reveal that PDE5 exists in two apparently distinct conformations, i.e., an extended conformer and a more compact conformer. PDE5 activity is modulated by a rapidly reversible redox switch. Chemical reduction of PDE5 relieves autoinhibition of enzyme functions; allosteric cGMP-binding activity is increased 10-fold, and catalytic activity is increased ~3-fold. The redox effect on allosteric cGMP- binding occurs in the isolated regulatory domain. A change in the state of reduction of PDE5 or the isolated regulatory domain is associated with an apparent conformational change similar to that caused by phosphorylation. Tissue distribution of PDE5 PDE5 is expressed in human colonic cells and in intestinal tissue and its activity is regulated by intracellular cGMP levels in these cells that increase on GCC activation. This presumably occurs through binding of cGMP to the GAF domains in the N-terminus of PDE5, resulting in allosteric activation of the enzyme. The mechanism of action of E4021 on both the nonactivated and activated forms of rod PDE6 because both states are relevant to understanding how PDE5-selective inhibitors may alter signal transduction pathways in photoreceptor cells. PDE5-selective inhibitors may show good discrimination of PDE5 from most other PDE isoforms. In addition to human corpus cavernosum smooth muscle, PDE5 is also found in lower concentrations in other tissues including platelets, vascular and visceral smooth muscle, and skeletal muscle. The inhibition of PDE5 in these tissues by sildenafil may be the basis for the enhanced platelet antiaggregatory activity of nitric oxide observed in vitro, an inhibition of platelet thrombus formation in vivo and peripheral arterial-venous dilatation in vivo. Immunohistology has shown that PDE5 localizes in heart cells at the sarcomere z-disk, but can also be found in diffuse amounts in the cytosol. Increased expression of PDE5 has also been measured in hypertrophic disease and has been linked to oxidative stress, and PDE5 inhibition has shown beneficial effects in the failing heart. In an experiment, PDE5 overexpression was found to contribute to worsened pathological remodeling after mouse cardiomyocytes experienced myocardial infarction. The role of PDE5 in heart failure and cardiac treatment involving PDE5 inhibitors have been major areas of focus for both lab and clinical studies.  PDE5-inhibiting drugs  There are now four oral erectile dysfunction (ED) drugs: Viagra (sildenafil) by Pfizer, Levitra (vardenafil) by Bayer Pharmaceutical and Glaxo-Smith-Kline-Beecham/Schering Plough, Cialis (tadalafil) by Lilly-ICOS, and Stendra (avanafil) by Auxilium Pharmaceuticals. For all practical purposes, these drugs including Viagra, Levitra, and Cialis are the first line of oral treatment for males with erectile dysfunction. In certain circumstances in which the males are young, no comorbidities are recognized, and laboratory tests are normal, one should look for the underlying cause of their erectile dysfunction before instituting treatment since the disease process may be more serious than the ED itself. In some cases, treatment of the underlying cause may resolve the sexual dysfunction. Particular caution should be used when prescribing PDE5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction for patients receiving protease inhibitors, including Reyataz. Coadministration of a protease inhibitor with a PDE5 inhibitor is expected to substantially increase the PDE5 inhibitor concentration and may result in an increase in PDE5 inhibitor-associated adverse events, including hypotension, visual changes, and priapism. PDE5-inhibiting drugs are very effective. PDE5 inhibitor drugs appear to work in men regardless of why they have erectile dysfunction ‚Äî including vascular disease, nerve problems, and even psychological causes. PDE5-inhibiting drugs can cause a number of minor side-effects, including headache, lightheadedness, dizziness, flushing, nasal congestion, and changes in vision. In 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued additional guidance on regulations related to cGMP manufacture and packaging. =Sildenafil= Bulk bag of counterfeit Viagra Sildenafil (marketed as Viagra) was the first PDE5 inhibitor on the market. Originally created as a treatment for high blood pressure in 1989, it was found to have a secondary use as an effective PDE5 inhibitor, enabling men who use it to gain stronger erections after arousal. The FDA approved Viagra on March 27, 1998. Discovered by Pfizer, sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum in the penis. This means that, when sildenafil is present in the organism, normal sexual stimulation leads to increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, which leads to better erections. Without sexual stimulation and no activation of the NO/cGMP system, sildenafil should not cause an erection. Studies in vitro have shown that sildenafil is selective for PDE5. Its effect is more potent on PDE5 than on other known phosphodiesterases (10-fold for PDE6, >80-fold for PDE1, >700-fold for PDE2, PDE3, PDE4, PDE7, PDE8, PDE9, PDE10, and PDE11). The approximately 4,000-fold selectivity for PDE5 versus PDE3 is important because PDE3 is involved in control of cardiac contractility. Sildenafil is only about 10-fold as potent for PDE5 compared to PDE6, an enzyme found in the retina that is involved in the phototransduction pathway of the retina. This lower selectivity is thought to be the basis for abnormalities related to color vision observed with higher doses or plasma levels. = Vardenafil = Vardenafil (marketed as Levitra, Staxyn and Vivanza) was the second oral PDE-5 inhibitor for erectile dysfunction to be FDA approved in August 2003. =Tadalafil= Tadalafil (marketed as Cialis) is a PDE5 inhibitor commonly that, in addition to its use in erectile dysfunction is also used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension. It has a longer half life than sildenafil of 17.5 hours, allowing it to be taken once a day. Tadalafil \\"daily\\" (5 mg) is also used for treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia. In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, tadalafil improves symptoms and also slows down the progressive deterioration in breathlessness seen in this condition. Studies have shown that tadalafil is more selective for PDE5 over PDE6 than sildenafil or vardenafil.

The states of Isenburg emerged from the Niederlahngau (located in the Rhineland-Palatinate), which partitioned in 1137 into Isenburg-Isenburg and Isenburg-Limburg-Covern. These countships were partitioned between themselves many times over the next 700 years. House of Isenburg Isenburg (Lower Isenburg) The House of Isenburg was an old aristocratic family of medieval Germany, named after the castle of Isenburg in Rhineland-Palatinate. Occasionally referred to as the House of Rommersdorf before the 12th century, the house originated in the Hessian comitatus of the Niederlahngau in the 10th century. It partitioned into the lines of Isenburg- Isenburg and Isenburg-Limburg-Covern in 1137, before partitioning again into smaller units, but by 1500 only the lines of Isenburg-B√ºdingen (in Upper Isenburg) and Lower Isenburg remained. In 1664 the Lower Isenburg branch died out. The B√ºdingen line continued to partition, and by the beginning of the 19th century the lines of Isenburg-B√ºdingen, Isenburg-Birstein, Isenburg- Meerholz and Isenburg-W√§chtersbach existed. Today still exist the (Roman Catholic) princes of Isenburg (at Birstein), the (Lutheran) princes of Ysenburg (at B√ºdingen and Ronneburg) and the (Lutheran) counts of Ysenburg- Philippseich. \\"Family tree\\" of the Isenburg countships B√ºdingen Castle Castle Ronneburg, Hesse Birstein Castle W√§chtersbach Castle Meerholz Castle at Gelnhausen Philippseich Castle at Dreieich Isenburg, the original countship was divided in 1137 into: *Isenburg (or Isenburg-Isenburg), 1137‚Äì1199, eventually dividing c. 1210 into: **Isenburg-Braunsberg, 1210‚Äì1388, when it was renamed Isenburg-Wied.

When the Holy Roman Empire was defeated by Napoleon I of France in that year, the empire was abolished and the Confederation of the Rhine was established amongst the various German states. As an incentive to join the Confederation, it was stated that any state which joined could mediatise their neighbours. Prince Charles of Isenburg-Birstein joined the Confederation and was granted the mediatized Isenburgian Countships of Isenburg-B√ºdingen, Isenburg-Meerholz, Isenburg-Philippseich, and Isenburg-W√§chtersbach. His Principality was renamed to Isenburg. The Principality continued under the rule of Prince Charles through the Napoleonic era, but was mediatised by Austria in December 1813, at the insistence of King Frederick William III of Prussia, who was angered that Isenburg had raised a regiment for French service by recruiting Prussian deserters and vagabonds.Treitschke, Heinrich. History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century, Vol. I, page 609. Isenburg was one of only three original member princes of the Empire to be mediatized at the end of the Napoleonic era (the others being Leyen and prince-primate Dalberg). This decision was confirmed at the Congress of Vienna. The lands of the principality were divided between the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt and the Electorate of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel). =Princes of Isenburg (1806‚Äì1814/5)= *Charles of Isenburg, 1806‚Äì1814/5  Mediatized (1815)  * Charles, 1st Prince 1803-1820 (1766-1820) ** Wolfgang Ernst, 2nd Prince 1820-1866 (1798-1866) ** Prince Victor (1802-1843) *** Karl, 3rd Prince 1866-1899 (1838-1899) **** Prince Leopold (1866-1933) -renounced his rights in 1898 **** Franz Joseph, 4th Prince 1899-1939 (1869-1939) ***** Franz Ferdinand, 5th Prince 1939-1956 (1901-1956) ****** Franz Alexander, 6th Prince 1956‚Äì2018(1943-2018) ******* Alexander, 7th Prince 2018‚Äìpresent (1969) ‚àû Sarah Lorenz ******** Princess Alix (2015) ******** Princess Zita (2017) ******** Franz Salvator, Hereditary Prince (2019) ******* Princess Katharina (1971) ‚àû Archduke Martin of Austria ******* Princess Isabelle (1973) ‚àû Carl, Prince of Wied ******* Princess Sophie (1978) ‚àû Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia ******* Prince Viktor (1979) ‚àû Jungeun Anes Lee ******** Princess Amalia (2016) ******** Princess Victoria (2018) =Princes of Isenburg and B√ºdingen= = Notable members = * Imagina of Isenburg-Limburg, c. 1255 ‚Äì 29 September 1313?, Queen consort of Adolf of Nassau, king of Germany * Diether von Isenburg, c. 1412 ‚Äì 1482, Elector and Archbishop of Mainz * Anna of Isenburg-B√ºdingen, 1460 ‚Äì 1522 * John of Isenburg-Grenzau, Archbishop- Elector of Trier from 1547 until 1556 * Salentin IX of Isenburg-Grenzau, c. 1532‚Äì1610, Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, Bishop of Paderborn * Ernst Casimir II, 2nd Prince of Ysenburg and B√ºdingen, 1806-1861 * Bruno, 3rd Prince of Ysenburg and B√ºdingen, 1837-1906 * Princess Sophie Johanna Maria of Isenburg (born 1978), wife of Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia References External links * Official Website ‚Äì F√ºrstenhaus Isenburg (Princely House of Isenburg) County of Isenburg Category:States of the Confederation of the Rhine Category:Counties of the Holy Roman Empire Category:Former states and territories of Rhineland-Palatinate Category:Upper Rhenish Circle ","title":"County of Isenburg"},{"id":"1908544","text":"The Bayerische Oberlandbahn GmbH (BOB) is a private railway company based in Holzkirchen, Germany, and owned by Transdev Germany (formerly known as Veolia Verkehr). BOB Trains connect Munich with the alpine hamlets of Bayrischzell, Lenggries, and the spa town of Tegernsee. The routes are not electrified and are serviced with diesel-hydraulic and diesel-mechanic DMUs. Lines served The routes served by the BOB south of Holzkirchen. The three BOB lines run on part of what was the Bayerischen Maximiliansbahn as a combined train-set from M√ºnchen Hauptbahnhof via the southern ring to Holzkirchen. In Holzkirchen the combined train-set separates with one train-set heading off to the east, running through Miesbach and Schliersee to Bayrischzell. The two remaining train-sets continue on to Schaftlach where they separate again, with one train-set going to Lenggries via Bad T√∂lz, while the last train-set heads off towards the southeast to Tegernsee. The Tegernsee Line makes use of the tracks owned by the Tegernsee-Bahn, a private rail infrastructure provider. The separate train-sets travel from M√ºnchen Hauptbahnhof to Holzkirchen or Schaftlach as a single train. They then split-up and travel on to their individual destinations. On the return trip to Munich the individual units are connected again and run as a single train back to M√ºnchen Hauptbahnhof. Between Holzkirchen and Munich BOB Trains run under the M√ºnchner Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund tariff system. The Bayerische Oberland Bahn GmbH is a member of the \\"Tarifverband der Bundeseigenen und Nichtbundeseigenen Eisenbahnen in Deutschland\\" (TBNE: Tariff Association of federally and non-federally owned railways in Germany). History BOB was founded on 31 March 1998 and began service the same year. The company was launched to create more competition on the rail systems of southern Bavaria. In the early days of service BOB trains were often plagued by technical problems with the new/untested Integral train set. These initial problems have since been resolved and BOB is now considered very reliable. Since the beginning of July 2004 BOB has added three Bombardier Talent Train-sets to cover rush hour service. BOB also operates on some DB electric lines under the Meridian brand name, using FLIRT3 electric multiple units from Stadler Rail. Accidents and incidents On 9 February 2016, two Stadler FLIRTs were involved in a head-on collision near Bad Aibling. Several people were killed and approximately 100 were injured. Timetable BOB Lines are serviced at hourly/bi-hourly intervals, and with extra trains during rush hour. However, since December 2004 every other train/direction has had an increased journey time of 12 to 14 minutes. This contradicts the basic idea of a single Integrated Timetable. Utilization BOB Trains are not only highly used during weekdays, but also on the weekend by tourist and locals planning excursions to the Bavarian Alps, with walking, bike riding and skiing being favorite activities. Either a Bayern Ticket from Deutsche Bahn or a BOB weekend pass may be purchased for up to five passengers at a significantly discounted fare. Bus connections are available in Lenggries and Tegernsee to Karwendel, Achensee, Rofan and the Ski slopes on Wendelstein (not to be confused with the town Wendelstein), , Brauneck, Spitzing.

Lins's parents came from the impoverished northeastern region of Brazil, which prompted him to notice the racial profile of Brazilian society: \\"Brazil is a racist country and a racist society, but the funny thing is that nobody will admit to being a racist, and that's the problem. Blacks in Brazil are always in an inferior, subaltern position, but you can't find a white person who is a racist.\\" His literacy and verbal skill enabled Lins to start to write sambas and to contribute to local culture, which enabled him to escaped the cycle of gang violence and become a successful writer.

A successor facility called MAST Upgrade is being commissioned in 2020, with physics campaigns planned to start in late 2020. MAST followed the highly successful Small Tight Aspect Ratio Tokamak (START) experiment (1991-1998) and used the same innovative spherical tokamak design as START. Spherical tokamaks have been shown to be more efficient in use of the magnetic field than the more conventional toroidal design, adopted by Joint European Torus (JET) and ITER. START proved to exceed even the most optimistic predictions and MAST confirmed the results of its forerunner on a larger, more purpose-built experiment. It was fully commissioned by EURATOM/UKAEA and took two years to design and a further two years to construct. MAST included a neutral beam injector similar to that used on START for plasma heating, and used the same merging compression technique for plasma formation instead of the conventional direct induction. Merging compression provides a valuable saving of central solenoid flux, which can then be used to further ramp up the plasma current and/or maintain the required current flat-top. Its plasma volume was about 8 m3 and it confined plasmas with densities on the order of 1020/m3. Image to right shows plasma in the MAST device, displaying its almost circular outer profile. The extensions off the top and bottom are plasma flowing to the ring divertors, a key feature of modern tokamak designs. Timeline * ~1995 design started * ~1997 construction started * 1999 First plasma * 2013 Oct. Final plasma (#30471) before shutdown for upgrade. Operation From 1999 to 2013, MAST ran 30471 plasmas (in pulses up to 0.5 sec). It confirmed the increased operating efficiency of spherical tokamaks as shown on START ‚Äì especially demonstrating a high beta (ratio of plasma pressure to the pressure from the confining magnetic field). MAST also performed valuable experiments on controlling and mitigating instabilities at the edge of the plasma ‚Äì so-called Edge Localised Modes or ELMs. MAST Upgrade MAST Upgrade is a new tokamak fusion experiment at UKAEA‚Äôs Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, building on the success of it predecessor ‚Äì the MAST tokamak. The upgrade, which is costing ¬£45M, started in 2013 when MAST stopped operating and is designed to significantly enhance MAST‚Äôs capabilities in terms of heating power, plasma current, magnetic field and pulse length. MAST Upgrade is currently being commissioned, ready to start operation in late 2020. One of the most notable features on MAST Upgrade is the Super-X divertor. A divertor is part of the tokamak that is designed to exhaust the excess heat and impurities from the plasma. Conventional divertor designs, when scaled up to future powerplants, will experience very high heat loads and will need to be replaced every few years. The Super-X divertor should demonstrate much lower heat loads (by around a factor of 10), potentially solving one of the major challenges of commercially viable fusion power in the future.

He was originally a Marxist and an active member of the Communist Party of Germany, but after the Second World War Wittfogel was an equally-fierce anticommunist. Biography Karl August Wittfogel was born 6 September 1896 at Woltersdorf, in L√ºchow, Province of Hanover. Wittfogel left school in 1914. He studied philosophy, history, sociology, geography at Leipzig University and also in Munich, Berlin and Rostock and in 1919 again in Berlin. From 1921 he studied sinology in Leipzig. In between Wittfogel was drafted into a Signal Corps Unit (Fernmeldeeinheit) in 1917.See the useful Wittfogel page of his high school, the Johanneum, L√ºneburg and esp. Ulrich Menzel's excellent online presentation in the Personenlexikon Internationale Beziehungen virtuell. In 1921 Wittfogel married Rose Schlesinger. Wittfogel's second wife was the sociologist Olga (Joffe) Lang, a Russian sociologist who traveled with him to China and collaborated with him on a project to analyze the Chinese family. Lang later published a monograph on the Chinese family and a biography of the anarchist writer, Ba Jin.Register of Karl Wittfogel Papers Hoover Institution Anthropologist Esther Schiff Goldfrank became Wittfogel's wife in 1940.Gloria Levitas, Esther Schiff Goldfrank, p. 120- 126, in Women Anthropologists, Ute Gacs, editor, new ed., University of Illinois Press, Chicago, 1989. Wittfogel held academic positions at Columbia University from 1939 and was professor for Chinese history at the University of Washington from 1947 to 1966. He died of pneumonia on May 25, 1988 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. Political career Before the First World War, he was the leader of the L√ºneburg Wandervogel group. Walter Laqueur, Young Germany, 1962. In 1918, he set up the L√ºneburg localMathias Greffrath, Ein ernster Mensch, Die Zeit, 10. 6. 1988 (online archives). Later Wittfogel wrote under the pseudonym \\"Jungmann\\" am account of youth movements in Max Horkheimer's compilation \\"Studies in Authority and the Family.\\" Unfortunately, although Horkheimer's and Herbert Marcuse's contributions have been translated, Wittfogel's have not been. Wittfogel who had been a leader of the German Socialist Student Movement after the war beside Klaus Reichenbach liked Rudi Dutschke when they met in D√ºsseldorf in 1979 of the radical Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD). In 1920, he joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). At the Mei√ünertag 1923, a large Youth Movement gathering, Wittfogel asked the members of the Freideutsche Jugend: \\"In Wahrheit steht jedes Zeitalter unter einer gro√üen Idee. Habt ihr diese gro√üe Idee. Seid ihr bereit daf√ºr zu sterben?\\" Wittfogel asked them if they knew the need of the age, its big idea and if they had what it takes to die for their convictions. Karl-Otto Sch√ºddekopf, Linke Leute von rechts, Stuttgart, 1960 After expelling a strong radical group in the autumn of 1919, the KPD was basically a sect, until a majority of USPD delegates decided to join it at their party convention in October 1920. A third of USPD members (ca. 300,000) joined the 70,000-strong KPD. Ossip K. Flechtheim, Die KPD in der Weimarer Republik (1st edition 1948), Frankfurt, 1969 edition, pp. 35f., 156f.

Buckmiller says not only because W. taught at the Volkshochschule Schloss Tinz, but also because of Korsch's wife Dr. Hedda Korsch, who was active in the school reform movement. and was invited to the 1923 conference that helped establish the Institute for Social Research. Felix Weil financed and Richard Sorge organized this Erste Marxistische Arbeitswoche (1st marxist workweek) with Karl Korsch and Hedda Korsch, Georgy Lukacs, B√©la Fogarasi, his later wife Margarete Lissauer, Felix Jos√© and K√§the Weil (they were married 1921-1929), Richard and Christiane Sorge, Friedrich Pollock, Julian Gumperz and his later wife Hede Massing, from 1919 to 1923 married to Gerhart Eisler, Konstantin Zetkin, Fukomoto, Eduard Ludwig Alexander and Gertrud Alexander, their child, and others. Rose Wittfogel, born Schlesinger, also took part. They were married from 1921 (other sources say 1920) to 1929. She was a sculptor, later a librarian at the Frankfurt Institute. She emigrated to the Soviet Union and worked there (among other things?) as a translator at the VAGAAR, an Organisation for foreign workers. Michael Buckmiller, Die \\"Marxistische Arbeitswoche\\" 1923 und die Gr√ºndung des \\"Instituts f√ºr Sozialforschung\\", in Willem van Reijen, Gunzelin Schmid Noerr (eds.), Grand Hotel Abgrund, p. 141-182.

If he seems not to belong to the famous Frankfurt School, it may be because of his Marxism, his activism or even because he was not Jewish. He received his Ph.D. from the Frankfurter Universit√§t in 1928, where his supervisors were Wilhelm Gerloff, Richard Wilhelm and Franz Oppenheimer. His thesis was On the Economical Importance of the Agrarian and Industrial Productive Forces in China, (Die √∂konomische Bedeutung der agrikolen und industriellen Produktivkr√§fte Chinas Kohlhammer Verlag, Stuttgart. 1930, which became the first chapter of Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft Chinas, 1931. Wittfogel was an active member of the German communist party and a vocal critic of its enemies. In a short 1974 notice to a reprint of his 1929 essay on Political Geography, Wittfogel says he came out much stronger against the Nazis than the KPD and Komintern line wanted. Politische Geography, Josef Matznetter, ed., Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt, 1977, p. 230. Communist students at Jena invited him and Alfred B√§umler for a debate on the importance of Hegel for the Germany of today. B√§umler was a specialist on Kant, Nietzsche and Bachofen who soon became a leading Nazi philosopher. When Hitler came to power in 1933, Wittfogel tried to escape to Switzerland, but was arrested and interned in prisons and concentration camps.Borgermoor Moorlager Esterwegen im Emsland, a peat bog-camp in the Emsland and in Lichtenburg near Torgau. A novel Staatliches Konzentrationslager VII, Eine \\"Erziehungsanstalt\\" im Dritten Reich was first published in London, 1936 under the pen name Klaus Hinrichs. German edition: Edition Temmen, Bremen, 1991. His second wife Olga Joffe Lang worked for his release and, with the help of national bolshevist revolutionary Friedrich Hielscher, the also radical right- wing geographer Karl Haushofer, and the LSE historian R. H. Tawney, managed to get Wittfogel free in 1934.(Mathias Greffrath, Martin Jay). He left Germany for England and then the United States. Wittfogel's belief in the Soviet Union was destroyed with the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, and he began to hate the totalitarian, \\"asiatic\\" nature of Soviet and Chinese Communism from Lenin to Mao. He turned against his former comrades and denounced American scholars such as Owen Lattimore and Moses I. Finley, at the McCarran Committee hearings in 1951. He came to believe that the state-owned economies of the Soviet bloc inevitably led to despotic governments even more oppressive than those of \\"traditional Asia\\" and that those regimes were the greatest threat to the future of all mankind. Playwright and aesthetics In the early 1920s, Wittfogel wrote a number of communist, but also somewhat expressionistic, plays: \\"The Cripple\\", performed with other short plays on October 14, 1920 at Erwin Piscator's Berlin Proletarian Theatre. Piscator himself played the Cripple at the opening. John Heartfield managed a half-hour late delivery of the backdrop Erwin Piscator, Das politische Theater [new edition], Hamburg, 1963, S. 48f., note 1.

Wittfogel declined an offer to become the dramatic producer of the revolutionary Volksb√ºhne (People's Stage) in Berlin, because he wanted to concentrate on his academic studies.\\"Karl A. Wittfogel and His Provocative Theory of Oriental Despotism\\" He published Hegelian essays on aesthetics and literature in Die Linkskurve, journal of the Association of Proletarian Revolutionary Writers, and was a member of its editorial staff from April 1930. His conservative aesthetics put Wittfogel on Lukacs' side -- not what might have been expected from his plays. With the earlier Dada and Proletkult debates, the Mehring-, documentary- and proletarian-literature feud, from 1928 on became part of the long and bitter debate on literary modernism and communism, which culminated in the 1930s onslaught on Expressionism in the Moscow journal Das Wort. The debate was rekindled in the 1960s as the Brecht-Lukacs debate. At the time, Brecht had not really been able to publish his views. Helga Gallas, Marxistische Literaturtheorie, Luchterhand, Neuwied, 1971, on the 1928-1933 Bund Proletarisch Revolution√§rer Schriftsteller The Maoist Jan Myrdal in 1974 accused Wittfogel, Kurt Sauerland and George Lukacs, who were in favour of \\"culture\\" and an \\"elitist\\" aesthetics in the so-called \\"Mehring debate\\", to have turned Marxism into a theology and thus brought Hitler to power. \\"Wittfogel, Sauerland, Luk√°cs tragen eine schwere historische Verantwortung\\" (p. 95, \\"are to blame for the course of history\\"). Jan Myrdal who has written about China for nearly fifty years without knowing the language, also called Wittfogel non-intellectual, uncouth (\\"ungeschlacht\\") and a pretend professor. Lars Gustafsson and Jan Myrdal, Die unn√∂tige Gegenwart, Hanser, M√ºnchen, 1975, pp. 85- 95. First published as Den on√∂diga Samtiden, Stockholm, 1974. Jan Myrdal also called Wittfogel \\"parteikonformer...Ideologe\\", \\"spineless follower of the party line\\" Wittfogel believed in the party at least until 1933 and still sometimes fiercely defended it until at least around 1939 (he broke with Paul Massing over the Ruth Fischer revelations), even in the 1920s Wittfogel had ideas of his own, e.g. on nature, which to him could never simply be a part of human history and pure object of thinking, an idea Lukacs did not like at all. With very few others he took Marx's idea of a genuine \\"asiatic\\" way of pre-capitalist development seriously. At a Leningrad conference in 1931, all those ideas of an \\"asiatic\\" \\"mode of production\\" were shot down and buried by the Stalinist majority. They resurfaced around 1960, but by then Wittfogel was of course a non-person in communist eyes. Oriental Despotism Wittfogel is best known for his monumental work Oriental Despotism: A Comparative Study of Total Power, first published in 1957. Starting from a Marxist analysis of the ideas of Max Weber on China and India's \\"hydraulic-bureaucratic official- state\\" and building on Marx's sceptical view of the Asiatic Mode of Production, Wittfogel came up with an analysis of Oriental despotism which emphasized the role of irrigation works, the bureaucratic structures needed to maintain them and the impact that they had on society. He coined the term \\"hydraulic empire\\" to describe the system. In his view, many societies, mainly in Asia, relied heavily on the building of large-scale irrigation works. To do so, the state had to organize forced labor from the population at large. As only a centralized administration could organize the building and maintenance of large-scale systems of irrigation, the need for such systems made bureaucratic despotism inevitable in so-called Oriental lands. That structure was uniquely placed to also crush civil society and any other force capable of mobilizing against the state. Such a state would inevitably be despotic, powerful, stable and wealthy. Wittfogel believed the hydraulic hypothesis to apply to Russia under the Soviet Union. The sinologist Frederick W. Mote, however, strongly disagreed with Wittfogel's analysis,, as did John K. Fairbank. John King Fairbank, Merle Goldman, China, A New History, The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2006, p. 239 Others, such as Barrington Moore, George Lichtheim and especially Pierre Vidal-Naquet found the thesis stimulating. F. T√∂kei, Gianni Sofri, Maurice Godelier and Wittfogel's estranged pupil Lawrence Krader, concentrated on the concept. Two Berlin leaders of the SDS student movement, Rudi Dutschke and Bernd Rabehl, have published on these themes. Then East German dissident Rudolf Bahro later said that his Alternative in Eastern Europe was based on ideas of Wittfogel but because of the latter's later anticommunism, could not mention him by name. Bahro's later ecological ideas, recounted in From Red to Green and elsewhere were likewise inspired by Wittfogel's geographical determinism. The hydraulic thesis was also taken up by ecological anthropologists such as Marvin Harris. Further applications of the thesis included that to Mayan society, when aerial photographs revealed the network of canals in the Mayan areas of Yucatan. Critics have denied that Ceylon or Bali are truly hydraulic in the Wittfogel sense.

Poetry  Gorter's first book, a 4,000 verse epic poem called Mei (May), sealed his reputation as a great writer upon its publication in 1889, and is regarded as the pinnacle of Dutch Impressionist literature. Gorter rapidly followed this up with a book of short lyric poetry simply called Verzen (Verses) in 1890, which, after initial bad reviews, was equally hailed as a masterpiece. Initially Gorter was oriented towards the philosophy of Spinoza, whose major work Ethica he translated from Latin into Dutch (published in 1895) publ. Loman en Funke, The Hague, 1895. At the end of the century, he was drawn towards socialism, something he shared with most of the Tachtigers, and became the most politically involved of this group. Whilst continuing to write socialist poetry, he also became a major writer of socialist theory. In 1912 he wrote a long epic poem called Pan, describing a great war, which was followed by a global socialist revolution. He revised this in 1915, with the new version being published in 1916. Politics He joined the Social Democratic Labour Party (Sociaal-Democratische Arbeiderspartij or SDAP) in 1897. In 1909 he participated in a schism from the SDAP to form the Social-Democratic Party (Sociaal-Democratische Partij) of the Netherlands. =Correspondence with Lenin= In 1917, he hailed the Russian Revolution as the beginning of that global revolution. In June that year on medical advice he moved to Bern, Switzerland. Here he was in contact with a group of Russian revolutionary exiles who shared news of the revolution with him. Following the Bolshevik seizure of power also enabled him to send a letter to Vladimir Lenin wishing him luck and offering him help (23 December, 1917). Lenin's two replies arrived in February 1918. One wished him well with his health, the second requested him to find a some socialist experts, whether in Holland or Switzerland who could help in the restructuring of the banking system and setting up a state trading company. Gorter replied that month in a letter explaining that he had such people, but also raised political concerns over the direction of the Russian Revolution: Lenin had sanctioned the granting of concessions to the peasantry as regards establishing small scale agricultural production through land reform, whereas Gorter saw Communist Revolution in Western Europe, particularly in German and England arising from the seizure of power by the industrial working class, and saw extending property rights to small peasant businesses as undermining this. He also thought that the right to national self-determination should and could only be realised in Western Europe as part of a socialist revolution. In September 1918, he wrote to Lenin again concerning the failure of the Dutch Social- Democratic Party to oppose the imperialism of America, France and Britain with the same vigour they opposed German imperialism. He implored Lenin to write something in support of this view. Lenin responded sending a copy of State and Revolution, which Gorter offered to translate. Gorter also complained that the 4 members of parliament elected by the had voted in favour of relief aid from the United States, and thus were siding with an imperialist faction. In 1918, the Social-Democratic Party changed its name to the Communist Party of Holland (Communistische Partij Holland), and in 1919 Gorter left the party. In 1921 he was a founding member of the Communist Workers Party of Germany, joining its Essen Faction and becoming a leading supporter of the Communist Workers International. Death Gorter died in Brussels in 1927.

Frederik Willem van Eeden (3 April 1860, Haarlem ‚Äì 16 June 1932, Bussum) was a late 19th-century and early 20th-century Dutch writer and psychiatrist. He was a leading member of the Tachtigers and the Significs Group, and had top billing among the editors of De Nieuwe Gids (The New Guide) during its celebrated first few years of publication, starting in 1885.  Biography  Van Eeden was the son of Frederik Willem Van Eeden, director of the Royal Tropical Institute in Haarlem. In 1880 he studied Medicine in Amsterdam, where he pursued a bohemian lifestyle and wrote poetry. Whilst living in the city, he coined the term lucid dream in the sense of mental clarity, a term that nowadays is a classic term in the Dream literature and study, meaning dreaming while knowing that one is dreaming. In his early writings, he was strongly influenced by Hindu ideas of selfhood, by Boehme's mysticism, and by Fechner's panpsychism. He went on to become a prolific writer, producing many critically acclaimed novels, poetry, plays, and essays. He was widely admired in the Netherlands in his own time for his writings, as well as his status as the first internationally prominent Dutch psychiatrist. Van Eeden's psychiatrist practice included treating his fellow Tachtiger Willem Kloos as a patient starting in 1888. His treatment of Kloos was of limited benefit, as Kloos deteriorated into alcoholism and increasing symptoms of mental illness. Van Eeden also incorporated his psychiatric insights into his later writings, such as in a deeply psychological novel called \\"Van de koele meren des doods\\" (translated in English as \\"The Deeps of Deliverance\\"). Published in 1900, the novel intimately traced the struggle of a woman addicted to morphine as she deteriorated physically and mentally. His best known written work, \\"De Kleine Johannes\\" (\\"Little Johannes\\"), which first appeared in the premiere issue of De Nieuwe Gids, was a fantastical adventure of an everyman who grows up to face the harsh realities of the world around him and the emptiness of hopes for a better afterlife, but ultimately finding meaning in serving the good of those around him. This ethic is memorialized in the line \\"Waar de mensheid is, en haar weedom, daar is mijn weg.\\" (\\"Where mankind is, and her woe, there is my path.\\") wall poem in Leiden Van Eeden sought not only to write about, but also to practice, such an ethic. He established a commune named , taking inspiration from Thoreau's book Walden, in Bussum, North Holland, where the residents tried to produce as much of their needs as they could themselves and to share everything in common, and where he took up a standard of living far below what he was used to. This reflected a trend toward socialism among the Tachtigers; another Tachtiger, Herman Gorter, was a founding member of the world's first Communist political party, the Dutch Social-Democratic Party, in 1909. Van Eeden visited the U.S. He had contacts with William James and other psychologists. He met Freud in Vienna, whom he practically introduced in the Netherlands. He corresponded with Hermann Hesse, Charles Lloyd Tuckey (medical hypnotist), Harold Williams (linguist) and was a friend of Peter Kropotkin, the Russian anarchist living in London (UK). Van Eeden also had a keen interest in Indian philosophy. He translated Tagore‚Äôs Gitanjali. In late years of his life, Van Eeden became a Roman Catholic.Verschave, Paul (1924), ¬´Un converti hollandais, le po√®te Fr√©d√©ric Van Heeden¬ª, Le Correspondant (25 juillet), pp. 311-338.

Such are the rulers of his utopian city Kallipolis. For such a community to ever come into being, \\"philosophers [must] become kings‚Ä¶or those now called kings [must]‚Ä¶genuinely and adequately philosophize\\" (Plato, The Republic, 5.473d). In Book VI of The Republic Plato defined a philosopher firstly as its eponymous occupation: \\"wisdom-lover.\\" He then distinguishes between one who loves true knowledge (as opposed to mere experience or education) by saying that the philosopher is the only person who has access to ideas ‚Äì the archetypal entities that exist behind all representations of the form (such as Beauty itself as opposed to any one particular instance of beauty). It is next and in support of the idea that philosophers are the best rulers that Plato fashions the Ship of State metaphor, one of his most often cited ideas (along with his allegory of the cave): a \\"true pilot must of necessity pay attention to the seasons, the heavens, the stars, the winds, and everything proper to the craft if he is really to rule a ship\\" (The Republic, 6.488d). Examples =Magna Graecia= Archytas was a Pythagorean philosopher and political leader in the ancient Greek city of Tarentum, in Italy. He was a close friend of Plato, and some scholars assert that he may have been an inspiration for Plato's concept of a philosopher-king. Dion of Syracuse was a disciple of Plato. He overthrew the tyrant Dionysius II of Syracuse and was installed as leader in the city, only to be made to leave by the Syracusans who were unhappy with his opposition to democratic reforms. He was later re-invited to the city, where he attempted to establish an aristocracy along Platonic lines, but he was assassinated by plotters in the pay of the former tyrant. =Roman Empire= Marcus Aurelius was the first prominent example of a philosopher king. His Stoic tome Meditations, written in Greek while on campaign between 170 and 180, is still revered as a literary monument to a philosophy of service and duty, describing how to find and preserve equanimity in the midst of conflict by following nature as a source of guidance and inspiration. =Sasanian Empire= In the west, some considered Khosrow I as the philosopher king. He was admired, both in Persia and elsewhere, for his character, virtues, and knowledge of Greek philosophy. =Hungary= Matthias Corvinus (1443‚Äì1490), who was king of Hungary and Croatia from 1458, was influenced by the Italian Renaissance and strongly endeavored to follow in practice the model and ideas of the philosopher-king as described in The Republic. =Modern Iran= Ayatollah Khomeini is said to have been inspired by the Platonic vision of the philosopher king while in Qum in the 1920s when he became interested in Islamic mysticism and Plato's Republic. As such, it has been speculated that he was inspired by Plato's philosopher king, and subsequently based elements of his Islamic republic on it, despite it being a republic which deposed the former Pahlavi dynasty.Anderson, Raymond H. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, 89, the Unwavering Iranian Spiritual Leader. The New York Times, 4 June 1989. Criticism Karl Popper blamed Plato for the rise of totalitarianism in the 20th century, seeing Plato's philosopher kings, with their dreams of \\"social engineering\\" and \\"idealism\\", as leading directly to Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin (via Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Karl Marx respectively).Popper, Karl.

The distinction between endogenous and exogenous variables originated in simultaneous equations models, where one separates variables whose values are determined by the model from variables which are predetermined;For example, in a simple supply and demand model, when predicting the quantity demanded in equilibrium, the price is endogenous because producers change their price in response to demand and consumers change their demand in response to price. In this case, the price variable is said to have total endogeneity once the demand and supply curves are known. In contrast, a change in consumer tastes or preferences would be an exogenous change on the demand curve. ignoring simultaneity in the estimation leads to biased estimates as it violates the exogeneity assumption of the Gauss‚ÄìMarkov theorem. The problem of endogeneity is unfortunately, oftentimes ignored by researchers conducting non- experimental research and doing so precludes making policy recommendations. Instrumental variable techniques are commonly used to address this problem. Besides simultaneity, correlation between explanatory variables and the error term can arise when an unobserved or omitted variable is confounding both independent and dependent variables, or when independent variables are measured with error.  Exogeneity versus endogeneity  In a stochastic model, the notion of the usual exogeneity, sequential exogeneity, strong/strict exogeneity can be defined. Exogeneity is articulated in such a way that a variable or variables is exogenous for parameter \\\\alpha. Even if a variable is exogenous for parameter \\\\alpha, it might be endogenous for parameter \\\\beta. When the explanatory variables are not stochastic, then they are strong exogenous for all the parameters. If the independent variable is correlated with the error term in a regression model then the estimate of the regression coefficient in an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is biased; however if the correlation is not contemporaneous, then the coefficient estimate may still be consistent. There are many methods of correcting the bias, including instrumental variable regression and Heckman selection correction. = Static models = The following are some common sources of endogeneity.  Omitted variable  In this case, the endogeneity comes from an uncontrolled confounding variable, a variable that is correlated with both the independent variable in the model and with the error term. (Equivalently, the omitted variable affects the independent variable and separately affects the dependent variable.) Assume that the \\"true\\" model to be estimated is : y_i = \\\\alpha + \\\\beta x_i + \\\\gamma z_i + u_i but z_i is omitted from the regression model (perhaps because there is no way to measure it directly). Then the model that is actually estimated is : y_i = \\\\alpha + \\\\beta x_i + \\\\varepsilon_i where \\\\varepsilon_i=\\\\gamma z_i + u_i (thus, the z_i term has been absorbed into the error term). If the correlation of x and z is not 0 and z separately affects y (meaning \\\\gamma eq 0), then x is correlated with the error term \\\\varepsilon. Here, x is not exogenous for \\\\alpha and \\\\beta, since, given x, the distribution of y depends not only on \\\\alpha and \\\\beta, but also on z and \\\\gamma.  Measurement error  Suppose that a perfect measure of an independent variable is impossible. That is, instead of observing x^{*}_{i}, what is actually observed is x_i=x^{*}_{i}+ u_i where u_i is the measurement error or \\"noise\\". In this case, a model given by : y_i = \\\\alpha+\\\\beta x^{*}_i + \\\\varepsilon_i can be written in terms of observables and error terms as : \\\\begin{align} y_i & = \\\\alpha+\\\\beta(x_i- u_i) + \\\\varepsilon_i \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] y_i & = \\\\alpha+\\\\beta x_i +(\\\\varepsilon_i - \\\\beta u_i) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] y_i & = \\\\alpha+\\\\beta x_i +u_i \\\\quad (\\\\text{where } u_i=\\\\varepsilon_i - \\\\beta u_i) \\\\end{align} Since both x_i and u_i depend on u_i, they are correlated, so the OLS estimation of \\\\beta will be biased downward. Measurement error in the dependent variable, y_i, does not cause endogeneity, though it does increase the variance of the error term.  Simultaneity  Suppose that two variables are codetermined, with each affecting the other according to the following \\"structural\\" equations: :y_i = \\\\beta_1 x_i + \\\\gamma_1 z_i + u_i :z_i = \\\\beta_2 x_i + \\\\gamma_2 y_i + v_i Estimating either equation by itself results in endogeneity. In the case of the first structural equation, E(z_i u_i) eq 0. Solving for z_i while assuming that 1-\\\\gamma_1 \\\\gamma_2 eq 0 results in :z_i = \\\\frac{\\\\beta_2 + \\\\gamma_2 \\\\beta_1}{1-\\\\gamma_1 \\\\gamma_2}x_i+\\\\frac{1}{1-\\\\gamma_1 \\\\gamma_2}v_i+\\\\frac{\\\\gamma_2}{1-\\\\gamma_1 \\\\gamma_2}u_i. Assuming that x_i and v_i are uncorrelated with u_i, :\\\\operatorname E(z_i u_i) = \\\\frac{\\\\gamma_2}{1-\\\\gamma_1 \\\\gamma_2}\\\\operatorname E(u_i u_i) eq 0. Therefore, attempts at estimating either structural equation will be hampered by endogeneity. = Dynamic models = The endogeneity problem is particularly relevant in the context of time series analysis of causal processes. It is common for some factors within a causal system to be dependent for their value in period t on the values of other factors in the causal system in period t ‚àí 1\\\\. Suppose that the level of pest infestation is independent of all other factors within a given period, but is influenced by the level of rainfall and fertilizer in the preceding period. In this instance it would be correct to say that infestation is exogenous within the period, but endogenous over time. Let the model be y = f(x, z) + u. If the variable x is sequential exogenous for parameter \\\\alpha, and y does not cause x in the Granger sense, then the variable x is strongly/strictly exogenous for the parameter \\\\alpha.  Simultaneity  Generally speaking, simultaneity occurs in the dynamic model just like in the example of static simultaneity above.

Almost all programming languages have notations for atomic values such as integers, floating-point numbers, and strings, and usually for booleans and characters; some also have notations for elements of enumerated types and compound values such as arrays, records, and objects. An anonymous function is a literal for the function type. In contrast to literals, variables or constants are symbols that can take on one of a class of fixed values, the constant being constrained not to change. Literals are often used to initialize variables, for example, in the following, 1 is an integer literal and the three letter string in \\"cat\\" is a string literal: int a = 1; string s = \\"cat\\"; In lexical analysis, literals of a given type are generally a token type, with a grammar rule, like \\"a string of digits\\" for an integer literal. Some literals are specific keywords, like \`true\` for the boolean literal \\"true\\". In some object-oriented languages (like ECMAScript), objects can also be represented by literals. Methods of this object can be specified in the object literal using function literals. The brace notation below, which is also used for array literals, is typical for object literals: {\\"cat\\", \\"dog\\"} {name: \\"cat\\", length: 57} Literals of objects In ECMAScript (as well as its implementations JavaScript or ActionScript), an object with methods can be written using the object literal like this: var newobj = { var1: true, var2: \\"very interesting\\", method1: function () { alert(this.var1) }, method2: function () { alert(this.var2) } }; newobj.method1(); newobj.method2(); These object literals are similar to anonymous classes in other languages like Java. The JSON data interchange format is based on a subset of the JavaScript object literal syntax, with some additional restrictions (among them requiring all keys to be quoted, and disallowing functions and everything else except data literals). Because of this, almost every valid JSON document (except for some subtleties with escaping) is also valid JavaScript code, a fact exploited in the JSONP technique.

Polarimetry is the measurement and interpretation of the polarization of transverse waves, most notably electromagnetic waves, such as radio or light waves. Typically polarimetry is done on electromagnetic waves that have traveled through or have been reflected, refracted or diffracted by some material in order to characterize that object. plane polarized light: according to the wave theory of light an ordinary ray of light is consider to be vibrating in all planes of right angles to the direction of its propagation if this ordinary ray of light is passed through a nicol prism the emergent ray has its vibration only in one plane. Applications Polarimetry of thin films and surfaces is commonly known as ellipsometry. Polarimetry is used in remote sensing applications, such as planetary science, astronomy, and weather radar. Polarimetry can also be included in computational analysis of waves. For example, radars often consider wave polarization in post-processing to improve the characterization of the targets. In this case, polarimetry can be used to estimate the fine texture of a material, help resolve the orientation of small structures in the target, and, when circularly-polarized antennas are used, resolve the number of bounces of the received signal (the chirality of circularly polarized waves alternates with each reflection). = Imaging = In 2003, a visible-near IR (VNIR) Spectropolarimetric Imager with an acousto- optic tunable filter (AOTF) was reported. These hyperspectral and spectropolarimetric imager functioned in radiation regions spanning from ultraviolet (UV) to long-wave infrared (LWIR). In AOTFs a piezoelectric transducer converts a radio frequency (RF) signal into an ultrasonic wave. This wave then travels through a crystal attached to the transducer and upon entering an acoustic absorber is diffracted. The wavelength of the resulting light beams can be modified by altering the initial RF signal. VNIR and LWIR hyperspectral imaging consistently perform better as hyperspectral imagers. This technology was developed at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory. The researchers reported visible near infrared system (VISNIR) data (.4-.9 micrometers) which required an RF signal below 1 W power. The reported experimental data indicates that polarimetric signatures are unique to manmade items and are not found in natural objects. The researchers state that a dual system, collecting both hyperspectral and spectropolarimetric information, is an advantage in image production for target tracking. Equipment A polarimeter is the basic scientific instrument used to make these measurements, although this term is rarely used to describe a polarimetry process performed by a computer, such as is done in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar. Polarimetry can be used to measure various optical properties of a material, including linear birefringence, circular birefringence (also known as optical rotation or optical rotary dispersion), linear dichroism, circular dichroism and scattering. To measure these various properties, there have been many designs of polarimeters, some archaic and some in current use. The most sensitive are based on interferometers, while more conventional polarimeters are based on arrangements of polarising filters, wave plates or other devices.  Astronomical polarimetry  Polarimetry is used in many areas of astronomy to study physical characteristics of sources including active galactic nuclei and blazars, exoplanets, gas and dust in the interstellar medium, supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, stellar rotation, stellar magnetic fields, debris disks, reflection in binary stars and the cosmic microwave background radiation. Astronomical polarimetry observations are carried out either as imaging polarimetry, where polarization is measured as a function of position in imaging data, or spectropolarimetry, where polarization is measured as a function of wavelength of light, or broad-band aperture polarimetry.  Measuring optical rotation  Optically active samples, such as solutions of chiral molecules, often exhibit circular birefringence. Circular birefringence causes rotation of the polarization of plane polarized light as it passes through the sample. In ordinary light, the vibrations occur in all planes perpendicular to the direction of propagation. When light passes through a Nicol prism its vibrations in all directions except the direction of axis of the prism are cut off. The light emerging from the prism is said to be plane polarised because its vibration is in one direction. If two Nicol prisms are placed with their polarization planes parallel to each other, then the light rays emerging out of the first prism will enter the second prism. As a result, no loss of light is observed. However, if the second prism is rotated by an angle of 90¬∞, the light emerging from the first prism is stopped by the second prism and no light emerges. The first prism is usually called the polarizer and the second prism is called the analyser. A simple polarimeter to measure this rotation consists of a long tube with flat glass ends, into which the sample is placed. At each end of the tube is a Nicol prism or other polarizer. Light is shone through the tube, and the prism at the other end, attached to an eye-piece, is rotated to arrive at the region of complete brightness or that of half-dark, half-bright or that of complete darkness. The angle of rotation is then read from a scale. The same phenomenon is observed after an angle of 180¬∞. The specific rotation of the sample may then be calculated. Temperature can affect the rotation of light, which should be accounted for in the calculations.

It is made in such a way that it eliminates one of the rays by total internal reflection, i.e. the ordinary ray is eliminated and only the extraordinary ray is transmitted through the prism. It was the first type of polarizing prism, invented in 1828 by William Nicol (1770‚Äì1851) of Edinburgh. It consists of a rhombohedral crystal of Iceland spar (a variety of calcite) that has been cut at an angle of 68¬∞ with respect to the crystal axis, cut again diagonally, and then rejoined as shown, using a layer of transparent Canada balsam as a glue. Unpolarized light ray enters through the left face of the crystal, as shown in the diagram, and is split into two orthogonally polarized, differently directed rays by the birefringence property of the calcite. The ordinary ray, or o-ray, experiences a refractive index of no = 1.658 in the calcite and undergoes total internal reflection at the calcite‚Äìglue interface because its angle of incidence at the glue layer (refractive index n = 1.55) exceeds the critical angle for the interface. It passes out the top side of the upper half of the prism with some refraction, as shown. The extraordinary ray, or e-ray, experiences a lower refractive index (ne = 1.486) in the calcite and is not totally reflected at the interface because it strikes the interface at a sub- critical angle. The e-ray merely undergoes a slight refraction, or bending, as it passes through the interface into the lower half of the prism. It finally leaves the prism as a ray of plane-polarized light, undergoing another refraction, as it exits the far right side of the prism. The two exiting rays have polarizations orthogonal (at right angles) to each other, but the lower, or e-ray, is the more commonly used for further experimentation because it is again traveling in the original horizontal direction, assuming that the calcite prism angles have been properly cut. The direction of the upper ray, or o-ray, is quite different from its original direction because it alone suffers total internal reflection at the glue interface, as well as a final refraction on exit from the upper side of the prism. Nicol prisms were once widely used in microscopy and polarimetry, and the term \\"using crossed Nicols\\" (abbreviated as XN) is still used to refer to the observing of a sample placed between orthogonally oriented polarizers. In most instruments, however, Nicol prisms have been replaced by other types of polarizers such as Polaroid sheets and Glan‚ÄìThompson prisms.

NASAMS was the first surface-based application for the AIM-120 AMRAAM (Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile). NASAMS 2 is an upgraded version of the NASAMS air- defence system and it has been operational since 2007.  Development  The Norwegian company Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace teamed up with Raytheon and initiated the NASAMS programme as a cooperative effort for the Royal Norwegian Air Force. The network-centric air defence system NASAMS was declared fully operational capable in 1998 but had an initial operational capability as early as in 1994/95. Until the late 1990s the RNoAF ground-based air defence solution, also known as the Norwegian Solution (NORSOL), consisted of three different weapon systems; the 40mm Bofors L70 gun (controlled by the Oerlikon Contraves FCS2000 monopulse doppler tracking radar), the laser beam riding RBS 70 MANPADS system and the NASAMS. All three systems were integrated through the ARCS via field wires and radio. The ARCS maintained connection to higher echelons and ensured protection of friendly aircraft while preventing over- and underkill for all subordinate weapon systems. NASAMS capabilities are enhanced by the system's networked and distributed nature.  NASAMS 2  NASAMS launcher on a Scania 113H truck NASAMS launcher The RNoAF together with KDA conducted a mid-life update of NASAMS, called NASAMS 2, and the upgraded version was first handed over to RNoAF in mid-2006. The major difference between the two versions is the use of Link 16 on NASAMS 2 as well as a better ground radar. Full operational capability (FOC) was expected for 2007. A complete NASAMS (2) battery consists of 12 missile launchers (LCHR) (each one carrying six AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles), eight radars (AN/MPQ-64 Sentinel F1 Improved Sentinel X band 3D radar), one fire control centre (CTOC), one electro-optical camera vehicle (MSP500) and one Tactical Control Cell (TCC) vehicle. The upgrades consist of: *New radars, which can be mounted on a variety of vehicles. The radars have their own power supply and can process and distribute the data independently. The vehicles can be connected via radio links, cable, through Multi Rolle Radio, or through TADKOM. *The radars have a broader frequency spectrum and variable rotation speeds, and also an increased capacity to spot and follow targets. * Each module can automatically determine its position with its northfinder and GPS instruments. *The control centre modules can be mounted on a large variety of vehicles * The electro-optical MSP500 sensor is equipped with a laser rangefinder and a TV-camera, as well as an upgraded thermographic camera. These can be used to fire the missiles passively, which has been successfully tested. The control system can detach itself from the sensors, in order to become less visible.  NASAMS 3  In April 2019 RNoAF upgraded to NASAMS 3, and in May 2019 the first live firing test were conducted.https://forsvaret.no/presse/skarpskyting-under-oevelse- soelvpil The upgrades consist of: * Secure IP communications between all elements in NASAMS. * New radarsoftware. * Upgraded fire control centre. * Upgraded canister launchers. * ¬´High Mobility Launcher¬ª.https://www.tu.no/artikler/en-av-norges-storste-eksportsuksesser-na- er-ny-versjon-klar/276454 = High Mobility Launcher (HML) = HML is a subproject from NASAMS 3.

The FDC connected to a MPQ-64 radar forms an \\"Acquisition Radar and Control System\\" (ARCS). The missile has a horizontal range of up to 25 km. Other sources cite a range of 'over 15 km' but this depends on the missile version used. AMRAAM missile range: ‚Ä¢ AIM-120A/B: 55‚Äì75 km ‚Ä¢ AIM-120C-5: 105 km ‚Ä¢ AIM-120C-7: 120 km ‚Ä¢ AIM-120D: 180 km Note that ranges for AAMs are estimated for head-on encounters for fast moving aircraft at an altitude, and the range is significantly shorter when the same missiles are launched from stationary ground platforms. Further dimensioning for a stationary ground-launched- missile system is its maximum altitude reach, which by rule of thumb is one third of its maximum horizontal range.

It was approved by FDA on May 2, 1979, and withdrawn in 1982, after case reports in the United States indicated a link between the use of ticrynafen and hepatitis. Criminal charges were brought against SmithKline executives with regard to hiding data related to toxicity while gaining FDA approval. The company pleaded guilty to 14 counts of failure to report adverse reactions and 20 counts of selling a misbranded drug.United States v. SmithKline Beckman et al {BLR 286} Biotechnology Law Report. September‚ÄìOctober 1984, 3(9-10): 206-214. Tienilic acid was found to act as a suicide substrate at the cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism. However, the metabolic reaction carried out by these enzymes converted tienilic acid to a thiophene sulfoxide which was highly electrophilic. This encouraged a Michael reaction leading to alkylation of a thiol group in the enzyme's active site. Loss of water from the thiophene sulfoxide restored the thiophene ring and resulted in tienilic acid being covalently linked to the enzyme, thus inhibiting the enzyme irreversibly. In addition sera of patients who had liver failure after taking this drug contained antibodies recognizing CYP2C9 able to hydroxylate the drug and to give covalent binding. The above explanation is a hypothesis. It is still not known (after 15 years) if the reactive intermediate which inactivates the CYP2C9 is the thiophene sulfoxide or the thiophene epoxide. The target on the protein is also not known (could be multiple). However tienilic acid is a good mechanism based inhibitor of CYP2C9 and seems to inactivate it stoichiometrically. Progress in proteomics may one day give the answer. Recent studies indicate that in fact the primary metabolite of tienilic acid (5-OH tienilic acid) cannot be derived from a thiophene-S-oxide intermediate as was previously hypothesized. It was determined to be derived from a thiophene epoxide intermediate and this reactive intermediate is then likely a cause for the covalent binding to as well as mechanism-based inactivation of CYP2C9.
