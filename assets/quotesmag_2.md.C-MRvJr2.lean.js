He achieved success as a playwright in 1926 with the London production of his play Berkeley Square which he had written with Jack Squire, the editor of the London Mercury. It was adapted from Henry James' posthumously published 1917 novel The Sense of the Past. In 1927, he was retained by Horace Liveright to revise Hamilton Deane's 1924 stage adaptation of Dracula for its American production. Balderston did some significant work on the adaptation, which was an enormous success when it debuted in October, running for 261 performances and making a star of Bela Lugosi. Deane then hired Balderston to adapt Peggy Webling's 1927 play version of Frankenstein for American audiences. However this did not make it to Broadway. Berkley Square was produced on Broadway from 1929‚Äì30, starring Leslie Howard. It ran for 229 performances. =Screenwriter= Balderston's play of Dracula formed the basis of the 1931 film version starring Lugosi, made by Universal Pictures. Universal then bought his American adaptation of Peggy Webling's 1927 play Frankenstein, and used it as the basis for the 1931 film Frankenstein. Universal hired him to adapt a story on Cagliostro in The Mummy (1932). He wrote a version of The Invisible Man for James Whale which was not used. Balderston returned to Broadway in 1932, working with J.E. Hore on Red Planet. It only ran seven performances. For MGM he did an unused treatment of She: A Story of Adventure in 1932 and did some uncredited work on Smilin' Through (1932). He is credited as screenwriter on the adaptation of Berkeley Square (1933). Balderston was one of several writers on The Lives of a Bengal Lancer (1935), which earned him an Oscar nomination. He worked on The Mystery of Edwin Drood (1935) and Bride of Frankenstein (1935) and was the last writer on Mad Love (1935). He was an uncredited contributor to the script of Mark of the Vampire (1935) and wrote a version of Dracula's Daughter (1936) for David O. Selznick which was sold to Universal. Balderston worked on Peter Ibbetson (1935) for Henry Hathaway. He was one of several writers on The Amazing Quest of Ernest Bliss (1936) and did The Last of the Mohicans (1936) with Philip Dunne. He adapted a Hungarian play into Farewell Performance for the English stage in 1936. In Hollywood, Balderston specialised in British themed subjects: The Man Who Changed His Mind (1936); Beloved Enemy (1936) for Sam Goldwyn; The Prisoner of Zenda (1937) for Selznick. He wrote an unused script, Murder in Church in 1938 and was one of the team of writers who collaborated on the 1939 film adaptation of Gone with the Wind for Selznick. He wrote a musical for Fox, Little Old New York (1940) then adapted Victory (1940) for Paramount. At MGM he worked on Smilin' Through (1941), Stand By for Action (1942), and Tennessee Johnson (1942). He was also one of the writers on 1944's Gaslight, which earned him his second Academy Award nomination. He also wrote a book Chicago Blueprint, which was published in 1943. =Later Years= In 1948 he co-wrote a novel about Caesar and Cleopatra, A Goddess to a God. Balderston did a treatment of Red Planet which became Red Planet Mars (1952). In 1952 he was appointed lecturer in drama at the University of Southern California.

History Crash was formed in 1991 with the lineup of Ahn Heung-Chan (vocals, bass guitar), Jung Yong-Wook (drums) and Yoon Doo-Byung (guitar). They were also the first Korean band provoking slam dance and stage diving in their concert. In 1993, they recorded their debut album Endless Supply of Pain with an internationally famous death metal producer Colin Richardson with whom the band collaborated again on their third and fourth albums. Endless Supply of the Pain was a critical and commercial success with more than 80,000 copies sold in 1993. Ahn Heung-chan has also provided his backing vocals on two hardcore rap tracks of Korean pop superstars, Seo Taiji & Boys' third album. After a more death metal-oriented second album To Be or Not to Be, original guitarist Yoon was fired from the band. Their third album, Experimental State of Fear, was recorded in 1997 with two new guitarists, taking a more experimental approach, with the introduction of an industrial aspect to their thrash sound. They participated in the D.R.I. tribute album We Don't Need Society with a cover version of \\"Acid Rain\\" as well as a Stormtroopers of Death tribute album with a cover of \\"Sargent D & the S.O.D.\\". On August 10, 2010, Crash released their sixth album, The Paragon of Animals, which returned to the thrash style of Crash's earlier albums and abandoned the industrial elements of the previous few albums. In its place was a groove metal style comparable to the American band Lamb of God. The band continued to explore their thrash style in their most recent EP Untamed Hands In Imperfect World, released in 2014 by Sony Music.

He collaborated with Adam Sandler (executive producer of Grandma's Boy) on the album Shhh...Don't Tell as a writer and co-producer in addition to performing on the track \\"Gay Robot\\". Goossen directed the music video for the album's first single \\"Secret\\". It features Adam Sandler and comedian Nick Swardson (co-writer and star of Grandma's Boy) singing about the benefits of having trimmed pubic hair. Goossen's previous credits include the short film A Day With the Meatball, which once again featured Sandler but focused primarily on his bulldog Meatball. The two-minute piece showcases the dog meandering around various places until he ends up back in his master's arms. It was shown in theaters around the United States in 2002 as an attachment to Sandler's animated film Eight Crazy Nights. Goossen helped create Sandler's official website and directed several short films for the site. In 2009, Goossen directed the horror film, The Shortcut in Saskatchewan, Canada. The film tells the story of two brothers who learn first hand about an urban legend surrounding a shortcut near their school. In 2010, Goossen was the director of a Times Square interactive billboard installation for retailer Forever 21 which was developed by space150; the installation received media coverage for being \\"a clever, fresh project,\\" but later, coverage focused on its similarities to Chris O'Shea's 2009 project in Liverpool.

After completing a tube, a straight line is cut along the center of a column of stitches, in order to make room for an opening or place to attach another piece. The steek itself is a bridge of extra stitches, in which the cut is made, and is usually 6-10 stitches wide. This technique was developed by the knitters of the Shetland archipelago and is particularly associated with Fair Isle sweaters, although it can be used for solid colors as well. After the steek is cut, the edges are tacked down on the wrong side of the fabric in order to create a neat finishing, or the adjacent stitches are sewn or crocheted together to prevent unraveling. The stitches can also be picked up and knit from, for example, to create a sleeve. Alternatively, a sleeve can be made separately and sewn onto the steek. After the garment with a steek has been worn and washed a few times, the facings will felt and become durable finishes on the inside of the garment. Steeks can be used for front openings (such as on a cardigan), armholes, or necklines. It has several advantages: Many knitters are faster at the knit stitch than the purl stitch, it goes faster, and allows one to work with the right side of the fabric facing the knitter all the time, and thus follow an intricate pattern more easily. It is also easier to maintain an even tension and, as the color changes can be hidden, there are fewer ends to weave in. In general, there is little risk of unravelling the sweater with a steek cut if the sewn or crocheted line has been done with wool yarn that is not superwash. They can be further strengthened by using a sticky hairy animal yarn (Shetland wool, the traditional choice, is a good example), and using frequent color changes (such as a 1x1 rib or a check pattern) to secure the yarn. In addition, the sides of the steek can be reinforced by crocheting or sewing. Steeking is a procedure used in the making of Scottish traditional kilts in which the pleats of the kilt are \\"steeked,\\" or stabilized, by a line of running stitches made from the wrong side of the fabric, just above the ending line of pleats, or \\"fell.\\" Steeking is done after cutting extra fabric away at the top of the pleats, and before the kilt is pressed and other finishing elements like lining and buckles are applied.

In 1966 he was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. Mistler, whose father's family had left Alsace in 1871, did his schooling in Sor√®ze, before preparing for the entrance examination of the Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure at the Lyc√©e Henri IV, where he read philosophy under Alain. Mistler was drafted into the artillery in 1915 and emerged from World War I a staunch pacifist. He was accepted at the √âcole normale in 1919 and came in first in the national Aggr√©gation exam in German the following year. Instead of becoming a teacher in France, Mistler applied for a position abroad through the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. He was sent to the French legation in Hungary, becoming a cultural attach√©, and teaching at the university of Budapest. In 1925 he was accepted into the Quai d'Orsay (Service des Oeuvres), where he succeeded Paul Morand. He started a political career in 1928 when he was elected deput√© of Aude under the radical socialist label. He received the appointment of under-secretary in charge of the Arts and served as a minister several times, starting in 1932. In 1934, he joined the government of Albert Sarraut, as Minister overseeing the postal service and telecommunications. A music lover, he founded the Orchestre national de la Radiodiffusion fran√ßaise (the ancestor of today's Orchestre National de France). From 1936, he chaired the Foreign Affairs Commission. In parallel with his political activities, Mistler had begun a career as a writer, with the publication of Ch√¢teaux en Bavi√®re (1925) and Ethelka (1929). On 10 July 1940, in his role as the chair of the voting commission, Mistler introduced before the Parliament the bill that conferred the full powers to Marshal Philippe P√©tain (with the ultimate objective of preparing a new constitution). This led critics to accuse him, after the war, of having been the \\"sinker of the Republic.\\" After working for the √âditions du Rocher, Mistler became first the general secretary then the president of the Maison du Livre Fran√ßais (affiliated with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs). Finally, from 1964 to 1969, he became director of the general literature department at Librairie Hachette. During these years, Mistler also regularly penned literary and musical criticism for L'Aurore. On 2 June 1966 Mistler was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, replacing Robert d'Harcourt. Mistler died on 11 November 1988 in Paris and was buried in the vault of the d'Auriol family, in Sor√®ze.

Biography Born as Carlo in 1620 into the prominent princely Massimo family, he was educated at La Sapienza University. He succeeded at age 20 to the estate of his cousin Camillo, from whom he derived his name. The elder Camillo had been the executor of the will of another great Roman collector, Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani. He started his ecclesiastical career as papal prelate at a young age and in 1651 he became cleric of the Apostolic Chamber. On 15 December 1653 Massimo was made titular Patriarch of Jerusalem and a year later as Apostolic Nuncio to Spain. However, Philip IV of Spain refused his appointment as nuncio, complaining he was too friendly with the French. He was forced to stop for a year in a small town between Valencia and Madrid. Back in Italy Monsignor Camillo Massimo retired in semi-exile ‚Äî from 1658 until the end of the pontificate of Pope Clement IX in 1669 - in a town called Roccasecca dei Volsci, in his 'Palazzo Baroniale'. On 22 December 1670 Pope Clement X elevated him to Cardinal with the title of S. Maria in Domnica, which Massimo later changed to that of Sant'Eusebio. He took part in the 1676 Papal conclave. In the same year he was opted for the title of Sant'Anastasia. He died in 1677 in Rome. Massimo's portraits were painted by both Diego Vel√°zquez and Carlo Maratta. He reorganised the Roman academy of the Umoristi. He had copies, made by Pietro Santo Bartoli, of the illustrations of an antique edition of Virgil and drawings based on the ancient paintings found in the Tomb of the Nasonii in Rome. He was also aided the eccentric former Queen Christina of Sweden with her library and collections.

The film is based upon the 1954 play of the same name by Maxwell Anderson, which in turn is based upon William March's 1954 novel The Bad Seed. The play was adapted by John Lee Mahin for the screenplay of the film. Plot Kenneth and Christine Penmark dote on their eight-year-old daughter Rhoda. Kenneth leaves on military duty. The Penmarks‚Äô neighbor and landlady, Monica, visits and Rhoda, pristine and proper in her pinafore dress and blonde pigtails, tells her about a penmanship competition that she lost to her schoolmate, Claude Daigle. Rhoda then leaves for her school picnic at the lake. Christine is having lunch with friends when they hear a radio report that a child has drowned in the lake. The victim is the same Claude who had won the penmanship medal. Christine worries that her daughter might be traumatized but Rhoda is unfazed by the incident and goes about her life. Rhoda's teacher, Miss Fern, visits Christine, revealing that Rhoda was the last person to see Claude alive and that she was seen grabbing at Claude's medal. She hints that Rhoda might have some connection to the boy's death and adds that she is not welcome at the school next year. Mr. and Mrs. Daigle barge in; Mrs. Daigle is distraught and drunk, and accuses Rhoda's teacher of knowing something she is not telling. When Christine finds the medal in Rhoda's room, she demands an explanation. Rhoda lies that Claude let her have it. Christine's father visits. Haunted by confusing memories about her own childhood, Christine talks with him and he reveals that he is not her biological parent; she was adopted. Upset by this revelation, Christine is then horrified to learn that she is actually the daughter of a notorious serial killer. She worries that her origin is the cause of Rhoda's sociopathy, and that her behavior is genetic. Christine catches Rhoda trying to dispose of her tap shoes in the household incinerator and realizes that Rhoda must have hit Claude with the shoes. A tearful Rhoda admits that she killed the boy in order to obtain the medal, and confirms Christine's suspicion that she had previously murdered an elderly neighbor when they lived in Wichita. Christine orders Rhoda to burn the shoes in the incinerator.Cruel Children in Popular Texts and Cultures p. 294 The next day, the caretaker, Leroy, teasingly tells Rhoda that he believes she killed Claude. After Rhoda angrily tells him she burned her shoes, Leroy opens the incinerator and finds the remains. A drunk Mrs. Daigle returns and tells Christine that she believes Rhoda knows what happened to her son. Mr. Daigle calls and comes to pick up his wife. Realizing that Leroy knows she really did kill Claude, Rhoda sets his excelsior bedding ablaze. After some men break open the basement hatch, Leroy runs into the yard aflame, ultimately burning to death. From the window, Christine and Monica see him die, which makes Christine hysterical. That night, a strangely calm Christine tells Rhoda that she dropped the medal into the lake, then gives her daughter a lethal dose of sleeping pills. She attempts to kill herself with a gunshot to the head. However, the gunshot alerts the neighbors and Rhoda and Christine are taken to the hospital. They both survive, though Christine is in a coma. Rhoda's father brings her home but during a thunderstorm in the middle of the night, Rhoda sneaks out. Christine regains consciousness and begs her husband for forgiveness. The doctor has said she will recover. Rhoda arrives at the lake, determined to retrieve the medal. She uses a metal pole to probe the water but a bolt of lightning strikes her, sending her body into the water and putting an end to her evil, ironically proving true Leroy's prediction that she would be electrocuted for killing Claude. This is the opposite of the ending of March's 1954 novel, in which Christine dies of the gunshot and Rhoda lives on, free to kill again. The movie then has a curtain call of the main cast. Upon her turn, Nancy Kelly looks through the doorway, shakes her head, walks through toward Patty McCormack at the couch, sits down, pulls McCormack over her lap and spanks her over her dress while McCormack repeatedly screams \\"No!\\" and both laugh.

Critics hailed her performance and deemed the film as an \\"unofficial sequel\\". Act One of the 1992 Off-Broadway musical Ruthless! is inspired by The Bad Seed. The 1993 film The Good Son is partly inspired by The Bad Seed. The lifetime film House of Deadly Secrets has also been considered an unofficial sequel because of Patty‚Äôs performance. Remakes The Bad Seed was remade for television in 1985, adapted by George Eckstein and directed by Paul Wendkos. It starred Carrie Welles, Blair Brown, Lynn Redgrave, David Carradine, Richard Kiley, and Chad Allen. This version uses the original ending of the March novel and its subsequent stage production. This remake was panned by critics and poorly received by its television audience. In June 2015, it was announced that Lifetime would remake The Bad Seed. In December 2017, Deadline.com reported that Rob Lowe was to direct and star in the remake with Mckenna Grace, Sarah Dugdale, Marci T. House, Lorne Cardinal, Chris Shields, Cara Buono, and a special appearance by Patty McCormack as Dr. March. The film aired in September 2018.

History The open admissions concept was heavily promoted in the 1960s and 1970s as a way to reduce discrimination in college admissions and to promote education of the underprivileged. The first major application in the United States was at the City University of New York (CUNY). It later applied the policy only to two-year community colleges since they are better prepared for remedial education. While the United States and other nations in the Anglosphere have historically tended toward a selective model for university admissions, mainland European nations have tended toward open admissions. Pressure for a more selective admissions model has only arisen in some of these countries as late as the 1970s, largely owing to the higher per capita rate of university participation in countries with selective admissions at that time.  Controversy  CUNY's introduction of open admissions to the United States sparked controversy both in politics and academia. Critics of open admissions included Vice President Spiro Agnew and journalists Robert Novak and Irving Kristol while its supporters included noted American writing scholar Mina P. Shaughnessy. The cases for open admissions cite the movement of the population from primarily rural to primarily urban, the shifting microeconomics in the United States from primarily goods-oriented to primarily services-oriented, and the country's rapid diversification of racial, ethnic, and class identities. Other cases for open admissions focused on academia's role as a gatekeeper for privilege, characterizing open admissions as a driving force for upward social mobility for American families. Opponents of open admissions raised concerns about credentialism and educational inflation, stating that opening colleges to anyone could potentially devalue the college diploma as an asset. They characterized the move to open admissions, not as a genuine attempt at educational reform, but as a maneuver of racial politics and the gross politicization of the educational process. Other, less prevalent criticisms include the idea that, through open admissions, CUNY was, whether purposefully or not, depriving private colleges of students through the combination of open admissions and less expensive tuition. Another criticism of CUNY's open admissions model was simply that it would not effect sufficient change for the underprivileged. This was not an indictment of open admissions in itself, but a prediction that open admissions might do nothing to an already present prestige gap between more selective and less selective schools. Graduation rates The graduation rates of colleges are correlated with their admissions policies. Six years after beginning a four-year program, an average of 60% of students nationwide will have graduated. However, that rate varies from 89% at colleges that accept less than a quarter of applicants to less than 36% at those with an open admissions policy.

He was an important figure in the development of the modern woodcut. He painted portraits, landscapes, nudes, still lifes, and other subjects in an unemotional, realistic style. His earliest paintings were influenced by Holbein and Ingres. He developed a simpler style during his association with Les Nabis during the 1890s, and produced woodcuts which brought him international recognition. Characterized by broad masses of black and white with minimal detail, they include street scenes, bathers, portraits, and a series of ten interiors titled Intimit√©s (Intimacies) that portray charged domestic encounters between men and women. He produced few prints after 1901, and concentrated instead on painting. His later paintings include highly finished portraits and nudes, and landscapes painted from memory. He was also active as a writer. He published art criticism during the 1890s, and his novel La Vie meurtri√®re (The Murderous Life) was published posthumously. Early life Vallotton was born into a conservative middle-class family in Lausanne, the third of four children. His father owned a pharmacy, and later purchased a chocolate factory. His mother, Emma, was the daughter of a furniture craftsman. His family environment was warm but strict, in the Swiss Protestant tradition. Beginning in 1875 he attended the Coll√®ge Cantonal, graduating with a degree in classical studies in 1882. He also began to attend the drawing classes of the painter Jean-Samson Guignard, normally reserved for most advanced students, where he showed a particular skill in close observation and realism. When he completed the course, he persuaded his parents to let him go to Paris to study art seriously.Rousseau and Protais 2013, p. 3 In January 1882 he settled in Rue Jacob in the neighborhood of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s, and enrolled in Acad√©mie Julian, where he studied with the portrait painter Jules Joseph Lefebvre and the history painter Gustave Boulanger, and where he perfected his technical skills. He spent many hours in the Louvre, and he greatly admired the works of Leonardo da Vinci, Holbein, D√ºrer, and more modern painters, including Goya and Manet, and especially Ingres, whose works were models for Vallotton throughout his life.St. James 1978, p. 6 In 1883, Vallotton's father wrote to Lefebvre, questioning whether his son could make a living as a painter. Lefebre responded that the young Vallotton had the talent and ability to succeed. In the same year, Vallotton succeeded in the rigorous competition to enter the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, but decided instead to remain at the Acad√©mie Julian, where his friends were. He also began to frequent the caf√©s and cabarets of Montmartre.Rousseau and Protais 2013, pp. 10‚Äì11 Self- portrait at 20 years old, oil on canvas (1885) In 1885 the methodical Vallotton began keeping a notebook, called his Livre de Raison, in which he listed all of his paintings, drawings, sculptures and prints. He kept the log his entire life. When he died, it listed one thousand seven hundred works. In the same year he presented his first works at the Paris Salon; the Ingresque Portrait of Monsieur Ursenbach as well as his first painted self-portrait, which received an honorable mention. In the same year he presented a painting at the Salon des beaux-arts in Geneva.Rousseau and Protais 2013, p. 12 Career =Early career (1887‚Äì1891)= In 1887 Vallotton presented two portraits at the Salon, the Portrait de F√©lix Jasinski and Les Parents de l'artiste, which demonstrated his skill but also, by their extreme realism, departed from the traditions of portrait painting. They were severely criticized by his professor, Jules Lefebvre. Vallotton increasingly began to work outside of the Acad√©mie Julien. He began to have financial difficulties; his father, whose firm was having its own financial problems, was unable to support him. His health also suffered, as he came down with typhoid fever and then a bout of depression. In 1889 he returned to Zermatt Switzerland for several weeks to recover, and there painted several Alpine landscapes. In 1889 he also met H√©lene Chatenay, an employee in a Swiss factory or shop, who became his companion for ten years.Rousseau and Protais 2013, pp. 12‚Äì13 He presented several paintings at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1889, and at the same exposition he saw the gallery of Japanese prints, particularly works by Hokusai, which were to greatly influence his work. To earn his living, Vallotton worked as an art restorer for the gallery owner Henri Haro. In 1890, he became an art critic for the Swiss newspaper La Gazette de Lausanne, writing some thirty articles about the Paris art world until 1897. In the same year he made a European tour, visiting Berlin, Prague, and Venice. He was particularly impressed by Italy, and returned there frequently in later years.Rousseau and Protais 2013, p. 16 In 1891, he showed his canvases for the last time in the official Salon des Artistes, and for the first time participated in the more avant-garde Salon des Independants, displaying six paintings. He began to receive commissions from Swiss art patrons. He experimented more frequently with various ways of making prints, using a technique called xylographie, in which he became very adept. He executed his first woodcut, a portrait of Paul Verlaine. His method was to make a very precise and detailed drawing, and then to simplify and simplify. His work was noticed by the writer and journalist Octave Uzanne, who published an article describing his work as \\"The renaissance of the woodcut\\".St. James 1978, p.5 The meticulous style of painting seen in the works of Vallotton's early period reached its zenith in The Patient, a canvas in which his companion, H√©lene Chatenay, portrays an invalid. Completed in 1892, it was Vallotton's last major painting before he began to introduce into his painted works the simplifying style he was developing in his woodcuts.Ducrey & Vallotton 2007, p. 40 =With the Nabis (1892‚Äì1900)= Ker-Xavier Roussel, √âdouard Vuillard, Romain Coolus, and F√©lix Vallotton in 1899 In 1892, he became a member of Les Nabis, a semi-secret, semi-mystical group of young artists, mostly from the Acad√©mie Julian, which included Pierre Bonnard, Ker-Xavier Roussel, Maurice Denis, and √âdouard Vuillard, with whom Vallotton was to form a lifelong friendship.Newman 1991, p. 262 While the Nabis shared certain common ideas and goals, their styles were quite different and personal. He kept himself somewhat apart from the others, earning his jocular title among the Nabis as \\"The Foreign Nabi\\".Rousseau and Protais 2013, p. 19 Vallotton's paintings in this period reflected the style of his woodcuts, with flat areas of color, hard edges, and simplification of detail. His subjects included genre scenes, portraits and nudes. Examples of his Nabi style are the deliberately awkward Bathers on a Summer Evening (1892-93), now in the Kunsthaus Z√ºrich, and the symbolist Moonlight (1895), in the Mus√©e d'Orsay. His paintings began to be noticed by the public and critics; Bathers on a Summer Evening, presented at the Salon des Ind√©pendents, was met with harsh criticism and laughter. But his woodcuts attracted attention and clients, and he became financially secure. Between 1893 and 1897, he received many commissions for illustrations from notable French newspapers and magazines, including La Revue Blanche, and from foreign art publications, including The Chap-Book of Chicago. He also made woodcuts for the covers of theater programs and book illustrations. One of his prominent patrons was Thad√©e Natanson, the publisher of the Revue Blanche, and his wife Misia, who commissioned many important decorative works from the Nabis. Through the Natansons Vallotton was introduced to the avant-garde elite of Paris, including St√©phane Mallarm√©, Marcel Proust, Eric Satie, and Claude Debussy.Rousseau and Protais 2013, p. 20 His woodcut subjects included domestic scenes, bathing women, portrait heads, and several images of street crowds and demonstrations‚Äînotably, several scenes of police attacking anarchists. He usually depicted types rather than individuals, eschewed the expression of strong emotion, and \\"fuse[d] a graphic wit with an acerbic if not ironic humor\\".Newman 1991, pp. 43‚Äì45 Vallotton's graphic art reached its highest development in Intimit√©s (Intimacies), a series of ten interiors published in 1898 by the Revue Blanche, which deal with tension between men and women.Newman 1991, p. 76 Vallotton's woodcuts were widely disseminated in periodicals and books in Europe as well as in the United States, and have been suggested as a significant influence on the graphic art of Edvard Munch, Aubrey Beardsley, and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner.St. James 1978, p. 24 In 1898 he bought a Kodak no.2 'Bullet' and experimented with it as a basis for at least five interior paintings. His first photos were taken in: Chateau d'Etretat, Chateau de la Naz, the Natanson's summer house above Cannes, and the Villa Beaulieu in Honfleur. Art historian Anca I Lasc suggests Woman in Blue Rummaging Through a Cupboard (1903) was based on a photograph taken in Vallotton's own Paris home on Rue Milan or rue de Belles Feuilles. Therefore, his paintings were most likely based on real interiors. By 1900, the Nabis had drifted apart. One source of the division was the Dreyfus affair, the case of a Jewish army officer falsely accused of aiding the Germans. The Nabis were divided, with Vallotton passionately defending Dreyfus. He produced a series of satirical woodcuts on the affair, including The Age of the Newspaper, which were published on the first page of Le Cri de Paris on January 23, 1898, at the height of the affair.Rousseau and Protais 2013, p. 23 Another major event during this period was his marriage in 1899 to Gabrielle Rodrigues-H√©nriques, the widowed daughter of Alexandre Bernheim, one of the most successful art dealers in Europe and founder of the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune. The union brought to his household three children from her previous marriage. There are few interiors by Vallotton that show children except for Dinner by Lamplight showing stepson Max, stepdaughter Madeline, with Gabrielle on his right with the back of the own artist's head. After a brief honeymoon in Switzerland, they moved to a large apartment on near the Gare Saint-Lazare train station. The marriage brought him financial security, and he gradually abandoned woodcuts as his main source of income. He also established a solid relationship with the Bernheim family and their gallery, which presented a special exhibition devoted to the Nabis, including ten of his works. Thereafter he devoted his attention almost entirely to painting.

In January 1903, he presented a selection of his works at exposition of painters of the Vienna Secession, and sold several works. In May 1903, the Bernheim gallery gave him a one-man show, which brought him good reviews. At the end of the year, the French government made its first purchase of one of his paintings for the Luxembourg Museum, then Paris's leading museum of modern art. Despite his successes, his financial situation was still precarious. He experimented for a time with sculpture. He continued to publish occasional art criticism, in addition to other writings. He wrote eight plays, some of which received performances (in 1904 and 1907), although their reviews appear to have been unfavorable.Ducrey 1989, p. 30 He also wrote three novels, including the semi-autobiographical La Vie meurtri√®re (The Murderous Life), begun in 1907 and published posthumously.Newman 1991, p. 318 His fortunes changed for the better at the beginning of 1907, with a show at the Bernheim-Jeune Gallery and the sale of thirteen paintings. He also presented a painting, Three women and a girl playing in the water, at the Salon of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants, which received good reviews. He made a trip to Italy with Gabrielle, and on his return painted The Turkish Bath, which was praised by among others the poet and critic Guillaume Apollinaire.Rousseau and Protais 2013, p. 28 Vallotton's paintings of the post-Nabi period had admirers, and were generally respected for their truthfulness and their technical qualities, but the severity of his style was frequently criticized.Ducrey 1989, p. 12 Typical is the reaction of the critic who, writing in the March 23, 1910 issue of Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, complained that Vallotton \\"paints like a policeman, like someone whose job it is to catch forms and colors. Everything creaks with an intolerable dryness ... the colors lack all joyfulness.\\"quoted in Newman 1991, p. 290 In its uncompromising character his art prefigured the New Objectivity that flourished in Germany during the 1920s, and has a further parallel in the work of Edward Hopper.Newman 1991, p. 40 In 1912 the French government offered him the Legion of Honor, but like his fellow Nabis Pierre Bonnard and √âdouard Vuillard, he refused the honor.

When World War I began in August 1914, he volunteered for the army. He was rejected because of his age (forty-eight), but did what he could do for the war effort. In 1915‚Äì16 he returned to the medium of woodcut for the first time since 1901 to express his feelings for his adopted country in the series, This is War, his last prints.Newman 1991, pp. 195, 266St. James 1978, p. 26 In June 1917, the Ministry of Fine Arts sent him, along with two other artists, for a three-week tour of the front lines. The sketches he produced became the basis for a group of paintings, The Church of Souain in Silhouette among them, in which he recorded with cool detachment the ruined landscape.Newman 1991, p. 200 The works made by the three artists were presented at the Mus√©e du Luxembourg.Newman 1991, p. 193 After the end of the war, Vallotton concentrated especially on still lifes and on \\"composite landscapes\\", landscapes composed in the studio from memory and imagination, and on flamboyantly erotic nudes. He had persistent health problems, and he and his wife passed the winters in Cagnes-sur-Mer in Provence, where they bought a small house, and Honfleur in Normandy, where they had a summer house. By the end of his life he had completed over 1700 paintings and about 200 prints, in addition to hundreds of drawings and several sculptures.Ducrey & Vallotton 2007, pp. 7‚Äì8 He died on the day after his 60th birthday, following cancer surgery in Paris in 1925. A retrospective exhibition by the Salon des Ind√©pendants took place in 1926. Some of Vallotton's works were exhibited at the Grand Palais, along with works by van Gogh, Modigliani, Seurat, Toulouse- Lautrec, Sch√ºtzenberger and others.Le Bulletin de la vie artistique (Paris), 1926-02-15, p.53, BnF Vallotton's brother Paul was an art dealer and founded the Galerie Paul Vallotton in Lausanne in 1922, which continued operation for many years under the control of his descendants. Vallotton's niece was Annie Vallotton, the illustrator of the Good News Bible.

The paintings, using tempera on cardboard, used the Nabi trademark method of flat areas of color, as the Nabi-influenced use of aerial and other unusual perspectives taken from Japanese prints. These works also expressed his social and political attitudes, contrasting the workers struggling to carry heavy sacks with the fashionable women in bright colors carrying wrapped packages from the new Paris department stores. He captured the activity and color inside Bon March√© and the other new Paris department stores. His street scenes were filled with activity and movement, capturing small scenes that appealed to his sense of humor or irony.Rousseau and Protais (2013), p. 44 File:F√©lix Vallotton, 1887 - Au march√©.jpgAt the Market (1887) File:Street Scene in Paris (Coin de rue √† Paris) MET DT3331.jpgStreet Scene in Paris (1895), tempera on board, Metropolitan Museum of Art File:F√©lix Vallotton, 1898 - Bon March√© D.jpgBon March√© (1898), right panel of a triptych showing shoppers in a department store File:F√©lix Vallotton Place Clichy.jpgPlace Clichy (1901) =Landscapes and seascapes= Vallotton's landscapes and seascapes avoided conventional views and techniques, and presented unusual viewpoints and perspectives. The scene is sometimes seen from above, with the horizon very high in the picture, or without the sky being visible at all. The forms are simplified, and the figures are often small and almost unrecognizable. In his famous The Ball of 1899 (Mus√©e d'Orsay), the scene is viewed from above, with three tiny figures: a girl chasing a ball and two mysterious figures in the distance having a conversation. The drama in the picture is the contrast between the sunlight and the shade.Rousseau and Protais (2013), pg. 64 In his 1899 painting of laundresses drying clothes on the beach of √âtretat, the women are almost unrecognizable as such until the picture is examined closely. He wrote in his journal, \\"I dream of a painting entirely disengaged from any literal concern about nature. I want to construct landscapes entirely based on the emotions that they have created in me, a few evocative lines, one or two details, chosen, without a superstition of the exactitude of the hour or the lighting.\\"cited in Rousseau and Protais (2013), pg. 64 File:F√©lix Vallotton, 1895c - Clair de lune.jpgMoonlight (ca. 1894), Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris File:F√©lix Vallotton - The Ball - Google Art Project.jpgThe Ball (1899), Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris File:F√©lix Vallotton, 1899 - Laveuses √† √âtretat.jpgLaundresses at √âtratat (1899) File:F√©lix Vallotton - Letzte Sonnenstahlen.jpegLast rays of sunshine (1911) File:Vallotton, 1918 - En rade du Havre.jpgThe Rade of Le Havre (1918) File:Felix Vallotton, 1917 - La baie de Tr√©gastel.jpgThe Bay of Tr√©gastel (1917) =Interiors= Many of Vallotton's paintings depicted interior apartment scenes, usually with men and women, sometimes hinting at scandal or adultery, sometimes simple scenes such as taking sheets out of a linen closet. The paintings often depicted open doorways or open doors leading to bedrooms. His wife Gabrielle appeared in many of the paintings, and the apartments resembled his own on rue des Belles- Feuilles. This theme is exemplified by his painting Haut de Forme (1887), and was most frequent in his work between 1898 and about 1904.Cahn, F√©lix Vallotton, Decouvertes, (2013) MuMA - Vallotton - La visite.JPGHaut de Forme (The visit), 1887, Museum of Modern Art File:F√©lix Vallotton, 1898 - La chambre rouge.jpgThe Red Chamber (1898), tempera on board File:F√©lix Vallotton, 1899 - La Visite.jpgThe Visit (1899), gouache on board, Kunsthaus Z√ºrich File:F√©lix Vallotton, 1901 - Femme fouillant dans un placard.jpgWoman searching in a wardrobe (1901) File:Int√©rieur, femme en bleu fouillant dans une armoire.jpgWoman in blue looking in a closet (1903) File:F√©lix Vallotton, 1903 - Int√©rieur avec femme en rouge de dos.jpgInterior with women in red robe (1904) =The female nude= The female nude was a very common subject for Vallotton; his journal records about five hundred paintings in this genre. The early nudes, when he was with the Nabis, were stylized and simplified. Later, the paintings became more detailed and realistic. The decor in the paintings was minimal. The choice of colors‚Äîparticularly the use of complementary red and green‚Äîemphasizes the paleness of the model's skin. There is no effort to make the models romantic or beautiful, and they never smile.Rousseau and Protais 2013, p. 106 File:Valloton Frau mit Dienstmagd beim Baden.jpgThe Mistress and the Servant (1896), oil on board, 52 x 66 cm, private collection File:F√©lix Vallotton, 1908 - Le sommeil.jpgSleep (1908) File:FelixVallotton-Nu.JPGNude, (1912), Kunstmuseum Winterthur File:Les2Femmes-F√©lix Vallotton-1913.jpgLa Blanche et la Noire (1913) File:1921 Vallotton Blonder Akt anagoria.JPGBlonde Nude (1921) =Encounters and Conversations= Sympathetic to the anarchist movement in his youth, Vallotton was an intense critic of Parisian life and values of the Paris upper class in the Belle Epoch. In the 1890s as a Nabi, he contributed many satirical illustrations to radical revues such as Assiette au beurre and Le Cri de Paris. His paintings in that decade included The Lie and The Kiss, depicting the hypocrisy and brutality men could show towards women. His political attitudes changed somewhat in 1899 when he married Gabrielle Rodrigues-H√©nriques, a member of a wealthy family, and he found himself a member of the class he was accustomed to condemn.Rousseau and Protais, (2013) p. 58 Despite his new position, he continued his social criticism. Vallotton painted numerous scenes of intimate conversations between men and women, sometimes in restaurants, sometimes at the theater‚Äîoften scenes suggesting seduction, rarely scenes suggesting romance or love. They expressed his satirical view of life in Paris at the time. The critic Octave Mirbeau described the figures in this particular genre of Vallotton's paintings in 1910: \\"....the figures don't just smile and cry, they speak...they express strongly, with the most moving eloquence, when it is Monsieur Vallotton who hears them speak, their humanity and the character of their humanity.\\"Cited by Isabel Kahn, F√©lix Vallotton (2013) The Provincial (1909) depicts a woman in a bar seducing a provincial visitor to Paris.

He used very vivid colors and was especially meticulous in painting the reflections of light on the fruits, vegetables, and ceramic vases. He wrote in his journal on August 13, 1919: \\"More than ever the object amuses me; the perfection of an egg; the moisture on a tomato; the striking (martelage) of a hortensia flower; these are the problems for me to resolve.\\"Cited in Cahan, Isabelle, F√©lix Vallotton (2013) File:Felix Vallotton - Pfefferfr√ºchte.jpgRed peppers (1915), Kunstmuseum Solothurn, Switzerland File:F√©lix Vallotton, 1923 - Still-life with capucines.jpgStill life with capucines (1923) Image:Marigolds and Tangerines.JPGMarigolds and Tangerines (1924), oil on canvas, National Gallery of Art File:F√©lix Vallotton, 1925 - Oignons et soupi√®re.jpgOnions and a soup tureen (1925) File:Still Life with Flowers MET ep67.187.117.R.jpgStill life with flowers (1925), Metropolitan Museum of Art =Portraits= Vallotton was recognized as a very accomplished portrait painter, and painted portraits of many of the leading figures in the arts of his time. His early work included a portrait of his fellow Nabi √âdouard Vuillard. The portraits of Vallotton featured both precision and a certain cold realism. He painted the celebrated American art patron Gertrude Stein the year after Pablo Picasso made his Portrait of Gertrude Stein, and depicted her as seemingly without emotion. One of his late portraits, The Roumanian in a red dress (1925) caused a minor scandal. The portrait of Mado Leviseano, a Paris prostitute, shows her slumped in her chair, with a nonchalant and provocative expression. Speaking of portraits in general, Vallotton wrote: \\"Human bodies, like faces, have their own individual expressions, which reveal, by their angles, their folds, their wrinkles, the joy, the pain, the boredom, the worries, the appetites, and the physical decay imposed by work, and the corrosive bitterness of voluptuousness.\\" After the death of Vallotton, the work was donated by his family to the Luxembourg Museum, the most important museum of modern art in Paris at the time. But visitors to the museum complained about the woman's posture and facial expression, and after three years it was taken down. His widow battled to have it restored to view, and the Paris museums took it back. It now is in the collection of the Mus√©e d'Orsay.Rousseau and Protais (2013), p. 116 File:F√©lix Vallotton, 1893 - Portrait d'√âdouard Vuillard.jpgPortrait of √âdouard Vuillard (1893) File:Felix Vallotton, 1899 - Alexandre Natanson.jpgPortrait of Alexandre Natanson (1899), Mus√©e d'Orsay File:F√©lix Vallotton, 1901 - Charles Baudelaire.jpgPortrait of Charles Baudelaire (1901) File:Gabrielle Vallotton.jpgPortrait of Gabielle Vallotton (1905), Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Bordeaux File:F√©lix Valloton, Portrait of Gertrude Stein 1907.jpgPortrait of Gertrude Stein (1907), Baltimore Museum of Art File:F√©lix Vallotton, 1925 - La Roumaine en robe rouge.jpgRoumanian in a Red Dress (1925), Mus√©e d'Orsay Woodcuts In the western world, the relief print, in the form of commercial wood engraving, had long been utilized mainly as a means to accurately reproduce drawn or painted images and, in later years, photographs. Vallotton's woodcut style was novel in its starkly reductive opposition of large masses of undifferentiated black and areas of unmodulated white. Vallotton emphasized outline and flat patterns, and generally eliminated the gradations and modeling traditionally produced by hatching. He was influenced by post-Impressionism, Symbolism, and especially by the Japanese woodcut: a large exhibition of ukiyo-e prints had been presented at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in 1890, and Vallotton, who was like many artists of his era an enthusiast of Japonisme, collected these prints.St. James 1978, pp.7‚Äì9 Image:F√©lix Vallotton autoportrait 1.jpgSelf portrait, 1891 Image:Paul Adam.jpgPaul Adam, 1896 Image:L√©on Blum by Vallotton.svgL√©on Blum, 1900 Image:F√©lix F√©n√©on by Vallotton.jpgF√©lix F√©n√©on, 1898 Image:Raoul Rigault by Vallotton.jpgRaoul Rigault, 1897 Notes and citations References * Brodska√Øa, Nathalia (1996).

Sidney Meyers is best known for two documentary films: The Quiet One, which he wrote and directed, and for which he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay; and British Academy of Film and Television Arts winner The Savage Eye, which he co-directed, co-produced and co-scripted with Joseph Strick and Ben Maddow. Biography Sidney Meyers was born in New York City on March 9, 1906 and grew up in East Harlem, then a teeming immigrant neighborhood. He was the eldest child of Abraham and Ida (n√©e Rudock) Meyers, who had immigrated from Poland to the United States around the start of the 20th century. Abraham, a paper-hanger and activist in the Painters and Paper-hangers Union, District Council 9, of the AFL, supported the family as best he could. It was noticed early on that Sidney loved music; a Jewish charitable women's organization arranged for him to have the use of a violin and to receive music lessons when he was a young school-child. During his years at De Witt Clinton High School Meyers played in the school's award-winning orchestra and joined the American Orchestral Society. While at the City College of New York, majoring in English literature, he continued to play the violin, and later the viola. On completing his studies he spent some three years as a member of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, then conducted by Maestro Fritz Reiner. On his return to New York City, where he lived for the rest of his life with his wife Edna (n√©e Ocko) and their son Nicholas, Meyers became interested in film- making and began to search for work in the fields of directing and editing, while playing the violin and viola in a Work Projects Administration orchestra. As was the case with many sons and daughters of immigrant families during the seemingly-endless Great Depression, he was drawn to left-wing political ideas. Using the pen-name of Robert Stebbins he wrote on the cinema for the left-wing arts magazine New Theatre. Meyers worked for the Federal Arts Project of the Work Projects Administration; in 1937 his film People of the Cumberland appeared under its auspices. During World War II Meyers served first as the chief American film editor for the British Ministry of Information and later worked as a film editor for the US Office of War Information. After the end of the War Meyers established a career as a free- lance film editor. He collaborated with directors, producers and other film artists, all of whom felt that his contribution was not limited to editing, as central as the latter may be to the work. Indeed he is best remembered for those films which he directed and wrote, and for which he served as consultant. Meyers's television editing credits include supervision of the CBS television series East Side, West Side; The Power and the Glory with Laurence Olivier; The Slaves, with Dionne Warwick; the Wisdom Series; Assignment India; Assignment ‚Äì Southeast Asia. The Quiet One, which Meyers directed and scripted, established him as one of the leaders in the genre of documentary drama. Meyers collaborated with Ben Maddow and Joseph Strick in the production of The Savage Eye, and with Samuel Beckett and Alan Schneider on Film (film). His contribution to Edge of the City was vital. Meyers continued to work until his untimely death from cancer in 1969: he served as consultant for The Queen (1968), and was script consultant for Joseph Strick's film adaptation of James Joyce's Ulysses. Shortly before his death he completed the editing of Joseph Strick's The Tropic of Cancer. Shortly after his death, the Sidney Meyers Memorial Scholarship Fund was established at the City College of New York. Film editing in the pre-digital era Until well after Meyers's death the main tool of film editing was the Moviola (or Movieola), a machine in which film was viewed, cut, and recombined manually. Ralph Rosenblum, who was mentored by Meyers, describes the exhausting process from the editor's point of view: \\"I sit in a corner at one of the Moviolas piecing together a sequence that was shot from five different perspectives. I work quickly, long lengths of film flying through my white-gloved right hand. I stop, mark the film with a grease pencil, fly on, make another mark, cut, splice together the desired portions, and hang up the trims, pieces of deleted film. ‚Ä¶ Five film barrels crowd the cutting room, with long trims hanging into them from an overhead rod. There's a lot of film on the floor‚Äînot rejected film, as the clich√© has it, but film that's in the process of being reviewed or edited or wound\\" (When the Shooting Stops, pp. 5‚Äì6). The Quiet One Meyers is arguably best remembered for The Quiet One (1948), a documentary which he directed, and for which he was one of the script writers. The documentary tells the story of the rehabilitation of a young, emotionally disturbed African-American boy; it contains text written by James Agee and narrated by Gary Merrill. In a 1949 review, Bosley Crowther defined the film: \\"Out of the tortured experiences of a 10-year-old Harlem Negro boy, cruelly rejected by his loved ones but rescued by the people of the Wiltwyck School, a new group of local film-makers has fashioned a genuine masterpiece in the way of a documentary drama.\\" The still photographer Helen Levitt was one of the film's cinematographers and writers, along with the painter Janice Loeb. Ulysses Kay wrote the score for the film. The film's three writers - Meyers, Loeb, and Levitt - were nominated for the Best Writing, Story and Screenplay Academy Award; the film itself was also nominated for the Best Documentary Feature Academy Award. The National Board of Review named The Quiet One the second best film of 1949. Edge of the City Edge of the City (1957), which Meyers edited, was directed by Martin Ritt and starred John Cassavetes, Sidney Poitier, Jack Warden, Kathleen Maguire and Ruby Dee. The score was composed by Leonard Rosenman. Edge of the City was based on Robert Alan Arthur's screenplay which was the final episode of The Philco Television Playhouse: \\"A Man Is Ten Feet Tall\\" (1955). Although produced by MGM the film received a low budget; MGM feared that because of its racial content it could not be shown in the southern US, and indeed because of the refusal of theaters in the South and elsewhere to screen the film, it was not a commercial success. The film was considered unusual for its time not only because of its portrayal of an interracial friendship, but also because the main African-American character was in a position of authority over the white; and also due to hints that the character played by Cassavetes might be homosexual. Edge of the City was praised by representatives of the NAACP, the Urban League, the American Jewish Committee, among others, for its courageous depiction of an interracial friendship. The Savage Eye The Savage Eye (1959) is a documentary drama which conflates a dramatic narration of the life of a divorced woman with documentary camera footage from an unnamed American city (actually Los Angeles) in the 1950s. It stars Barbara Baxley. The film was written, produced, directed, and edited by Meyers, Ben Maddow and Joseph Strick. The camera footage was done by cinematographers Haskell Wexler, Helen Levitt and Jack Couffer; the music is by Leonard Rosenman. The Savage Eye won the 1960 BAFTA Flaherty Documentary Award as well as several film festival prizes. The Savage Eye belongs to the cinema v√©rit√© movement of the 1950s and '60s. In the words of John Hagan: \\"One can see how, in its study of a woman whose marital problems have estranged her from the world, it anticipated, if not influenced, such films as The Misfits, Red Desert, and Juliet of the Spirits.\\" Influences Among those cinematic currents which may be said to have influenced Meyers's work were Romanticism: notably Robert J. Flaherty's Nanook of the North (1922). The latter was filmed on site, using local people and claiming to show their lives as they really were. Such films were staged, however; Flaherty famously had his subject kill a walrus with a harpoon rather than use his gun. Another major influence on young film-makers of the 1920s and '30s was Realism. The latter, largely a European tradition, included \\"city symphony\\" films, which aimed to show people as products of the man-made environment in which they lived. Walter Ruttman's Berlin, Symphony of a City (1927), is an example. In the USSR Kino-Pravda (\\"cinematic truth\\") was developed by Dziga Vertov, who created Soviet news-reels during the 1920s. According to Vertov's cinematic philosophy the movie, via techniques such as slow motion, time lapse, fast motion, close-ups and of course editing, could produce a rendition of reality more accurate than that perceived by the human eye. Meyers's influence can be discerned in cinema verit√© and its close relative direct cinema. Enabled by the development of convenient, portable cameras and means of synchronizing sound, cinema verit√© often involved following a person during moments of personal crisis. The place of editing in creating the final artistic product is so central that the editor is on occasion given credit as consultant, or even co-director. Legacy Shortly before his death Meyers began to write notes for a book which was never published. The following is from these notes: \\"On one level film editing is like editing in general, literary editing, writing a piece of literature, preparing a book review or any presentation, selling an idea, putting it over. General principles maintain, clarity of ideas, coherence, emphasis on chief idea, lining up of proofs, and substantiation, avoidance of repetition, avoidance of belaboring the obvious, in other words, granting the reader intelligence but at the same time stressing value of your contribution to his fund of knowledge. A sense of when you've made your case and that any further exposition on it will be overdoing matters. These are by no means easy objectives to attain but necessary to obtain, nevertheless. ... The film is very different. It is an expression in continuity. Its own qualities, its own dynamics. There is no turning back or leaping ahead unless you are permitted to do so by the film itself. Film is a Form in Continuity, within a more or less restricted frame. This frame is its entire world. Nothing exists outside of it. And whatever happens within it is autonomous.\\" Films and TV--partial list *Tropic of Cancer (1969) -- Editor *Slaves (1969) -- Editor (TV) *Ulysses (1967) -- Script Consultant *Film (1965) -- Editor *FDR (1965) -- Editor (TV mini-series) *East Side/ West Side (1963-4) -- Editor (CBS TV) *The Power and the Glory (1961) -- Editor (CBS TV) *The Savage Eye (1959) ‚Äì Co- producer, Co-director *Edge of Fury (1958) - Editing Supervisor *Adventuring in the Arts (1956) -- Director *Edge of the City (1956) -- Editor *The Steps of Age (1951) -- Supervising Editor *The Quiet One (1949) -- Director; Script; Editor *In the Street (1947) -- Filmmaker *People of the Cumberland (1937) -- Director Awards and nominations 1967 Man-made Man (CBS) won the Lasker Award for the best medical film of the year 1959 The Savage Eye won the British Academy Awards' Robert Flaterly Award for Best Feature Length Documentary 1959 The Savage Eye nominated at the Venice Film Festival for the Fipresci Prize 1959 The Savage Eye top honors at Edinburgh Film Festival 1949 The Quiet One nominated at the Venice Film Festival for the International Prize 1949 The Quiet One nominated at the Venice International Film Festival for Competing Film 1948 The Quiet One nominated by Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for Best Original Screenplay in the documentary category References * Brender, Richard.

This vast plain‚Äîmarshy and thinly populated in the north, hilly in the south‚Äîis of growing economic importance, mostly due to the abundance of natural resources: oil, coal, wood, water. There are vast oilfields in the West Siberian petroleum basin, and Russia's largest oil refinery is in Omsk. The Kuznetsk Basin around Kemerovo and Novokuznetsk is a center of coal mining, and the production of iron, steel, machinery, and chemicals. Logging is a significant industry throughout the region. Hydroelectric stations dam the Ob near Novosibirsk and Kamen-na-Obi.

The official economic statistics give a positive profile to this region. Not only is GDP in total high due to its substantial total population, but also reported GDP per capita is almost half above the Russian mean, as is industrial productivity. In keeping with this, wage levels are a third above the national average. However, the likelihood of getting paid in full is 14% below the national level. The region's economy is, moreover, relatively low in privatized ex-state enterprises, and only average in new private sector employment. Levels of social welfare are close to the national mean in terms of life expectancy for men and women, and the proportion of students in higher education. However, popular attitudes in the region give a negative picture of West Siberia. Compared to other regions, people are much less likely to expect life to improve, and are even more negative in their rating of the national economy.West Siberia References Category:Economic regions of Russia Category:Economy of Siberia Category:Siberia ","title":"West Siberian economic region"},{"id":"7657288","text":"Peter Jankowski is the President and Chief Operating Officer of Wolf Films Inc., headquartered in Universal City, California.

History  The historic Spring Hill mansion, a centerpiece of Trinity Hall and Trinity High School =Spring Hill= Trinity Area School District takes its name from Trinity Hall School for Boys that operated from 1879 to 1906. The historic school grounds in North Franklin Township date back to the 1850s when Joseph McKnight built a home on top of a hill overlooking the then-borough of Washington, Pennsylvania. This twenty-five room Italianate mansion called Spring Hill now functions as the district‚Äôs administrative offices. Spring Hill was purchased by William Smith, a prominent Washington dry goods merchant, as the new home for his son. The Smith family hired Boston-based landscape artist Robert Morris Copeland to prepare the grounds along Catfish Creek before it was occupied by William Wrenshaw Smith and his wife Emma Willard McKennan Smith. Wrenshaw Smith was a cousin to Julia Dent, wife of President Ulysses S. Grant. Wrenshaw Smith also served as Grant's aide-de-camp during the Civil War and Grant visited the Spring Hill mansion on multiple occasions. =Trinity Hall School for Boys= William Wrenshaw Smith was a devout Episcopalian and longtime vestryman at Trinity Episcopal Church, then located on Beau Street near Washington and Jefferson College. During the 1860s, Smith worked alongside John Barrett Kerfoot, newly elected Bishop of Pittsburgh, to create a boys‚Äô school following the curricular model of famed priest-educator William Augustus Muhlenberg. In this model, ‚Äúthe school was to be like a large family with a priest as rector serving as father-figure in loco parentis.‚Äù Trinity Hall operated from 1879 to 1906 attracting members of prominent regional families including Heinz, Carnegie, Kammerer, and LeMoyne along with a grandson of President Grant. In 1883, Trinity School for Boys began adopting elements of Muscular Christianity. This included a ‚Äúmilitary department‚Äù for purposes of exercise and a more generic Protestant Christianity in place of Muhlenberg‚Äôs strictly Episcopalian church school model. Sometimes this leads to overemphasis on the military nature of the school and mistaken conclusions that Trinity Hall was a strict military academy. Various Episcopal priests served as school rector until the 1890s when patron William Wrenshaw Smith became lay rector, a change possibly due to declining enrollment and revenue. Trinity Hall closed in 1906, two years after Smith‚Äôs death. =Trinity Hall becomes Trinity High School= Trinity Hall, a Smith family property, stood vacant for nearly two decades. In 1922, it was unsuccessfully considered as a site for relocating Presbyterian-affiliated Washington Female Seminary. Then in 1925 the townships of Amwell, Canton, North Franklin, and South Strabane purchased the Trinity Hall property for repurposing as a joint public high school. The sale nearly fell through. Amwell Township‚Äôs secretary refused to sign documents until forced to do so by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The classroom block of Trinity Hall was used from 1883 until 2004. It was demolished in 2006. The Spring Hill section of Trinity Hall continues to serve as offices for Trinity Area School District. The school district now maintains Trinity Hall Museum open by appointment only. Governance Ttinity Area School District is governed by 9 individually elected board members (serve without compensation for a term of four years), the Pennsylvania State Board of Education, the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the Pennsylvania General Assembly.Pennsylvania Public School Code Governance 2010 The federal government controls programs it funds like: Title I funding for low income children in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the No Child Left Behind Act(renamed Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in December 2015) which mandates the district focus its resources on student success in acquiring reading and math skills. The school board is required by state law to post a financial report on the district in its website by March of each school year. The Superintendent and Business Manager are appointed by the school board. The Superintendent is the chief administrative officer with overall responsibility for all aspects of operations, including education and finance. The Business Manager is responsible for budget and financial operations. Neither of these officials are voting members of the School Board. The School Board enters into individual employment contracts for these positions. These contracts must be in writing and are subject to public disclosure under the state's Right to Know Act. In Pennsylvania, public school districts are required to give 150 days notice to the Superintendent and Business Manager regarding renewal of their employment contracts.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Pennsylvania School Code, 2013 Pursuant to Act 141 of 2012 which amended the Pennsylvania School Code, all school districts that have hired superintendents on/after the fall of 2012 are required to develop objective performance standards and post them on the district's website. Academic achievement In 2015, Trinity Area School District ranked 176th out of 493 Pennsylvania public school districts, by the Pittsburgh Business Times.

Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics, IPEDS Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, 2008 Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English. Dual enrollment The high school offers the Pennsylvania dual enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. The Pennsylvania College Credit Transfer System reported in 2009, that students saved nearly $35.4 million by having their transferred credits count towards a degree under the new system. In 2010 the district received $17,753.00 in a state grant to be used assist students with tuition, fees and books. Graduation requirements The Trinity Area School District School Board has determined that students must earn 22 credits to graduate. By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. At Trinity High School the graduation project includes: 10 hours of community service, school visitation, job shadowing and a written paper. Trinity's CARE project focuses on career exploration. The completion of each phase of CARE earns the student 1/4 credit with a full credit eventually earned towards graduation. By Pennsylvania School Board regulations, for the graduating classes of 2015 and 2016, students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, English Composition, and Literature for which the Keystone Exams serve as the final course exams. Students‚Äô Keystone Exam scores shall count for at least one-third of the final course grade. =Trinity Middle School= Trinity Middle School is located at 50 Scenic Drive, Washington.

Special education In December 2014, Trinity Area School District administration reported that 524 pupils or 15.9% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 41% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2009, the district administration reported that 552 pupils or 15% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak testified before the Pennsylvania House Education Committee regarding full-day kindergarten. He claimed that districts which offered the program would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full-day kindergarten would be recouped by Districts in lower special education costs. Trinity Area School District has provided full-day kindergarten since 2006. The district has seen a slight decrease in the percentage of special education students it serves, but this has yielded no savings. The Board has applied to raise taxes beyond the Act 1 limit due to special education costs. The district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania Special Education Funding, 2010 The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports. Trinity Area School District received a $1,903,871 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12, 2012‚Äì13 and 2013-14 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding was provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education Funding 2011-2012 Fiscal Year, 2011Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in PA kids, April 2012 For the 2014-2015 school year, Trinity Area School District received an increase to $1,943,098 from the Commonwealth for special education funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education funding report by LEA, July 2014 Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The district must apply for this added funding. In 2013, the state's Special Education Funding Reform Commission provided a report on the state of funding for special education in the Commonwealth. Funding for special education programs is borne largely on a local basis at 60%, with the state contributing $1 billion or 30% and the federal government providing 10% of the funding. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 98 or 2.81% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum through a push in model with the gifted instructor in the classroom with the regular instructor. This approach permits such specialized instructional strategies as tiered assignments, curriculum compacting, flexible grouping, learning stations, independent projects and independent contracts. Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to honors and advanced placement courses, and dual enrollment with local colleges. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Bullying and school safety The Trinity Area School District administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying in the district in 2009. There were 25 reports of fighting. The Trinity Area School Board has provided the district's bullying policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti- bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials.

Accountability Block Grants Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11 the Trinity Area School District applied for and received $565,118 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district used the funding to provide full-day kindergarten for the 7th year, to reduce class size k-3 and to provide teaching coaching to improve math and reading instruction. Ready to Learn grant Beginning in the 2014-2015 budget, the State funded a new Ready to Learn Grant for public schools. A total of $100 million is allocated through a formula to districts based on the number of students, level of poverty of community as calculated by its market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) and the number of English language learners. Ready to Learn Block Grant funds may be used by the Districts for: school safety; Ready by 3 early childhood intervention programs; individualized learning programs; and science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) programs. Trinity Area School District received $418,251 in Ready to Learn Grant dollars in addition to State Basic Education funding, Special Education funding, transportation reimbursement, reimbursement for Social Security payments for employees and other state grants which the district must apply to receive. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. Trinity Area School District was denied funding by the PDE, in 2006-07. In 2007-08 the district received $352,385. For the 2008‚Äì09, school year. the district received $63,341 for a total of $415,726. Of the 501 public school districts in Pennsylvania, 447 of them received Classrooms for the Future grant awards. Among the public school districts in Washington County, the highest award was given to Canon-McMillan School District which received $493,791. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. The grant program was discontinued by Governor Edward Rendell as part of the 2009-10 state budget. Other grants Trinity Area School District did not participate in: Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Environmental Education annual grants; PA Science Its Elementary grants (discontinued effective with 2009-10 budget by Governor Rendell);Pennsylvania Department of Education, Science: It‚Äôs Elementary Grantees Students in 143 Schools Benefit from Intensive Science Curriculum, July 22, 2008 Education Assistance Grants; 2012 Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant; 2013 Safe Schools grants; 2012 and 2013 Pennsylvania Hybrid Learning Grants; Project 720 High School Reform grants (discontinued effective with 2011-12 budget); nor the federal 21st Century Learning grants. =Federal grants= Trinity Area School District received an extra $1,621,202 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students.Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Washington County ARRA FUNDING Report, February 2011 The funding is for the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010-11 school years. Race to the Top grant Trinity Area School District officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district up to one million additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate.Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. Title II grants The Federal government provides annual grants to schools to be used to improve the quality of teacher instructions to pupils. The goal is to provide each child in public schools with ‚ÄúHigh Quality‚Äù teachers and principals as defined by the state. The funds are sent to the state Department of Education which distributes them to each school district and charter school. Beginning in 2002, the federal funding committed to Title II was $3,175,000,000. Public school district administrations must apply to the state annually for the Title II funds. In 2012-13, Trinity Area School District received $183,794 in federal Title II funding.PDE, Title IIA egrants 2012-13, 2012 In 2014-15, Trinity Area School District applied for and received $177,688.PDE, Title IIA egrants 2014-15, 2014 English language learners grant The Federal government provides annual grants to schools to assist in educating immigrant children and children who are identified as limited English proficient. Upon registering for school a language survey is done for all new enrollment pupils, typically in kindergarten or preschool. They identify the primary language spoken at home. This data is collected and submitted to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, which in turn notifies the federal government.PDE, English As A Second Language (ESL), 2015 In 2012-13, Trinity Area School District received $1,086 in Title III funding for English language learners. For 2014-15, Trinity Area School District received $3,422 in Title III funding.PDE, Title III Grant Allocations 2014-15, 2014 =Common Cents state initiative= The Trinity Area School Board did not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. =Real estate taxes= In 2015-16, Trinity Area School Board set local property tax rates at 113.0000 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Washington County uses 25 percent of assessed property value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. A reassessment was last conducted in 1981 in Washington County. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate ‚Äì land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal). Additionally, service-related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Unlike other states, under Pennsylvania state tax policy, natural gas and oil pipelines are exempted from property taxes. There are a plethora of gas pipelines in the district due to Marcellus shale gas development. Pipeline companies prohibit development within the 100-foot-wide right-of-way, thereby limiting future development options for the landowner. This limits future potential property tax revenues for the school district, by constraining future land development. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections (Local Tax Enabling Act), which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2014-15 - 107.7000 mills *2013-14 - 105.0000 mills *2012-13 - 103.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Finances_Real Estate Tax Rates 2012-13, 2012 *2011-12 - 103.0000 mills. *2010-11 - 103.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Finances_Real Estate Tax Rates 2010-11, 2010 *2009-10 - 103.0000 mills. *2008-09 - 103.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Financial Elements Reports 2008-09 Real Estate Mills, 2009 *2007-08 - 105.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2008 *2006-07 - 107.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005-06 - 107.0000 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by Washington County residents amounts to about 2.54% of their yearly income. Lackawanna County ranked 928th out of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Tax- rates.org., The 2015 Tax Resource County Property Taxes 2014, 2015 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Finances - Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2010-11, 2011 Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009 Pennsylvania's 2011 tax burden of 10.35% ranked 10th highest out of 50 states. The tax burden was above the national average of 9.8%. Pennsylvania's taxpayers paid $4,374 per capita in state and local taxes, including school taxes.Tax Foundation, The facts on Pennsylvania‚Äôs Tax Climate, January 2015 Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not authorized to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines A specific timeline for Act I Index decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.

Property tax relief In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Trinity Area School District was $171 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 7,515 property owners applied for the tax relief. Washington School District received $407, the highest property tax relief allotted in Washington County for 2009. The tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property on the individual's tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least 10 contiguous acres and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. The Pennsylvania Auditor General found that 73% of property owners applied for tax relief in Washington County. Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the Chester-Upland School District in Delaware County at $632 per homestead and farmstead in 2010. This was the second year Chester Upland School District was the top recipient. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially more than $35,000, may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.

In 1927, he was capped twice for the Austria national team, scoring one goal, Karl Rappan summary - rapidarchiv.at - Official Archives of SK Rapid Wien, by Gerald Pichler and Herbert Pawlek - retrieved October 2006. against Hungary in a 6-0 win.Source: http://www.austriasoccer.at/LSP/1920_29/1927/s1927_02.htm Coaching career Rappan spent almost all of his managerial career ‚Äì which extended from 1932 to 1963 ‚Äì coaching Swiss teams and the Swiss national team. After his role as player-coach at Servette, Rappan became a full-time coach and joined Grasshopper-Club, managing the Z√ºrich club from 1935 to 1948, and winning 5 domestic league titles and 7 cups. In 1948, he returned to Servette for a second period at the club, now as coach only. He remained there until 1957, adding one more league title and one cup to his palmares. After Servette, Rappan had a one-season spell at FC Z√ºrich. From 1960 to 1963, he coached the Swiss national team exclusively, and after this last period in charge of the national squad, he joined club Lausanne-Sports, being their coach from 1964 to 1968, and winning one league title in 1965. After almost four decades of service in Swiss football, he returned to Austria to be the technical director of Rapid Wien ‚Äì his former club as a player ‚Äì for the 1969/70 season. =The \\"bolt\\"= During the early 1930s, when the use of the \\"WM\\" system was spreading, Rappan developed a tactical system under which players switched positions and duties depending on the game's pattern.Play of the game > Strategy and tactics - britannica.com - by Richard C. Giulianotti, Jack D. Rollin, and Bernard Joy, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved October 2006. The system varied largely from the classic 2-3-5 formation and the WM, focusing in defense. The team would fold back into its own half and wait for the opponent's attack, conceding possession of the midfield. The system received the name of verrou or \\"bolt\\". It has also been called \\"Swiss bolt\\". Reportedly, Rappan looked for a system that was less rigid and less dependent on individual talent than the WM. It relied on collective work, and gave the amateurs of the time a chance to compensate to some extent for their lack of skill.The \\"Bolt\\" - never fully understood by many people - fifa.com - by Walter Lutz, FIFA, 2000. The defensive strategy of the bolt relied on a mixture of zonal and man-marking. It was the first system to play four players in defense, using one of them as a \\"security bolt\\" supporting the other three. It is acknowledged that the bolt largely influenced the catenaccio (Italian for bolt) and its use of the libero (sweeper) in defense. Rappan's system was never fully understood by many people at the time, and the coach himself never discussed it, keeping a certain mystery around it. It received both praise and criticism. The system did demonstrate to be successful at the 1938 World Cup. Switzerland eliminated the Germany national football team in the first round, where the match that ended in a 1-1 draw was replayed, with the Swiss winning the second match 4-2. Two weeks prior to the World Cup, Switzerland had defeated England in a friendly match. =Switzerland national team= Rappan had four different tenures as head coach of the Switzerland national team: 1937 to 1938, 1942 to 1949, 1953 to 1954, and 1960 to 1963. He managed Switzerland in 77 international matches, the most ever by any Swiss team coach. He won 29 matches, also a record, and lost 36 times, second-most all- time. Swiss national team coaches in overview - www1.sf.tv - Schweizer Fernsehen, Retrieved October 2006.Switzerland - International Matches since 1905 - by Erik Garin, RSSSF. With Rappan as its coach, Switzerland qualified to the World Cups of 1938, 1954 (where they beat Italy and lost 5-7 to Austria in quarterfinals), and 1962. Rappan recorded 3 wins, 1 draw, and 6 losses as a coach in World Cup finals tournaments. His last match as Switzerland's coach was on November 11, 1963 against France in Paris, a 2-2 draw. After retirement Rappan, who had the idea of creating a European league, helped Ernst Thommen, the Managing Director for the Swiss Football Pool, conceive the UEFA Intertoto Cup, which started in 1961.History of the UEFA Intertoto Cup - uefa.com, UEFA.Background on the Intertoto Cup, By S√∏ren Florin Elbech, www.mogiel.net Rappan died on January 2, 1996 in Berne.

It offers wireless LAN, point-to-multipoint and point-to-point products through a channel network. The company is a product of many mergers and acquisitions over the years. History Proxim Corporation was founded in 1984, initially headquartered in Mountain View, California. Starting in 1989, it began to develop radio frequency modules using spread spectrum technology. Its first commercial product in 1990 used 900 MHz frequency bands. End-user products called RangeLAN were introduced in 1991 and 1992, reflecting their use as network interface controllers for local area networks (LANs). The first adapter using the Industry Standard Architecture bus and supported Novell NetWare. An initial public offering (IPO) on December 15, 1993 listed the company shares on NASDAQ under symbol PROX. In 1994 the RangLAN2 products starting using 2.4 GHz bands, and in 1995 the RangeLINK product line was introduced. Proxim was a founding member of the Wireless LAN Interoperability Forum in May 1996 to help interoperability between its RangeLAN2 and other wireless technologies. A secondary offering expected to raise an estimated $95 million in June 1996 was delayed and reduced to about $41 million by late July 1996. A product line called Symphony was introduced in 1998. Proxim was also a core member of the HomeRF Working Group, formed in 1997. The group disbanded at the end of 2002. In January 2000, Proxim announced it had acquired privately held Micrilor of Wakefield, Massachusetts a year earlier. In January 2001 Proxim (then headquartered in Sunnyvale, California) announced it would acquire Netopia Incorporated (listed as symbol NTPA) for approximately $223 million in stock. However, that merger fell apart after Intel announced it would stop developing HomeRF technology in March 2001. =Western Multiplex= Western Multiplex Corporation had acquired Ubiquity Communication on March 24, 2000, near the end of the dot-com bubble. Western Multiplex, founded in 1979 in Sunnyvale and acquired in 1995 by Glenayre Technologies, had their IPO on July 31, 2000, as it was listed on NASDAQ under symbol WMUX, raising about $90 million. In addition to the Ubiquity product line, Western had lines called Tsunami and Lynx product lines. In March 2001, Western Multiplex acquired privately held WirelessHome Corporation which had been based in Long Beach, California since 1998. In February 2002, Proxim proposed to acquire Western Multiplex and continue to use the stock symbol PROX. The transaction was estimated at a value over $200 million. At the time, Jonathan N. Zakin led Western Multiplex and Davic C. King led Proxim. The merger was approved on March 26, 2002. Later in 2002, Proxim acquired the Orinoco brand of wireless products of Agere Systems group after it spun off from Lucent. After it was warned it could be de-listed from the NASDAQ stock market, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 2005 as Moseley Associates announced it would purchase Proxim's assets for $21 million. However, a few weeks later, Terabeam Incorporated announced that it had bid $28 million for the assets without any proceeds to the previous stock-holders. =Telaxis to Terabeam= Millitech Corporation, founded in 1982, originally developed millimeter-wave technology, but shifted to August 1999 to focus on point-to-multipoint wireless access products for businesses, with Newbridge Networks their largest customer. Based in South Deerfield, Massachusetts and led by John L. Youngblood, Millitech planned their IPO in September 1999. Milltech changed their name to Telaxis Communications, and the offering was held in February 2000 using the NASDAQ symbol TLXS, raising about $63 million. Telaxis, then with the product line FiberLeap, acquired P-Com XT Corporation of Campbell, California in September 2002. Privately held Young Design, Incorporated, had acquired Zeus Wireless, and then merged with public Telaxis in April 2003 with the name changed to YDI Wireless in June 2003. Located in Falls Church, Virginia, YDI acquired Phazar Corporation (holding company for Antenna Products Corporation and others and based in Fort Worth, Texas) which had traded under the symbol ANTP, announced in October 2003 and finalized in December. YDI acquired software maker KarlNet on May 13, 2004, merged with Terabeam Corporation (founded in 2000) effective June 22, 2004, and used the name Terabeam for the new entity. By June 25, 2004, the Company acquired the service provider Ricochet Networks. On September 4, 2007, Terabeam (then headquartered in San Jose, California and led by Robert Fitzgerald) announced it would change its name to Proxim Wireless Corporation, and change its NASDAQ stock symbol from TRBM to PRXM. The shares were removed from NASDAQ in April 2009, and moved to the OTCQX of OTC Markets Group. On August 13, 2009, Proxim received an investment of $7.5 million, with $5 million coming from an arm of SRA Holdings, Inc. of Japan. Pankaj Manglik was reported to be chief executive in 2010. On May 13, 2010, common stock shares were combined in a one-for-one-hundred reverse split. In December 2010, the shares were withdrawn from the OTCQX to be traded on the so-called \\"Pink Sheets\\".

It was also referred to as Panna Dura, Villi Dura, or simply the Dura caste during the colonial period. Originally, members were appointed as guardians of the Sri Maha Bodhi tree.  History  The caste traces its origin to the arrival of the Sri Maha Bodhi Tree in Sri Lanka. Dipavamsa, the earliest document of the history of Sri Lanka, states that the following persons came to the island with or associated with Sri Mahabodhi.The Dipavamsa, An ancient Buddhist historical record, Hermann Oldernberg, Asian Educational Services, Fourth reprint, New Delhi, 2006, p 88, p 195 # Eight Kshatriya who were entrusted with protecting the Bodhi Tree # Bodhiguptha and Chandraguptha # Sixteen Lanka Mahalekhas (Lambakarnas) # Castes (or families) that received golden drums used for royal coronations (Lambakarnas) The Mahavamsa records state that during the reign of King Parakramabahu I, three lambakarnas (or mahalekha), were sent to southern India for a coronation festival.Mahavansha (Sinhala), Buddhist Cultural Center 7th reprint, 2010, pp 382 Accordingly, they are either descendants of Bodhiguptha, Chandragupta, eight kshatriyas or from the gotra lambakarnas. Mahavamsa itself contains a narrative of this incident which is less credible than Dipavamsa. It states that eighteen families of gods, eighteen families of ministers, eight families of Brahmins, eight families of etc. have been sent from India.Mahavansha (Sinhala), Buddhist Cultural Center, 7th reprint, 2010, pp 81 However, only a certain \\"eight situ families are specifically mentioned as Bodahara Caste\\".Mahavansha (Sinhala), Buddhist Cultural Center, 7th reprint, 2010, pp 84 According to later sources, these situ clans are Bodhiguptha, Chandragupta, Samudragupta, Sumitta, Devagupta, Sooryagupta, Dharmagupta, and Juthindara, relatives of King Dharmashoka. It was commonly believed that the members of this caste were descendants of this clan (in particular, Bodhiguptha), and are also connected to the lambakarnasDumbara Harispaththuwa Amarapura Puranaya, H.S.S. Nissanka, Department of Cultural Affairs, 2000, pp 89 Connection with Sinhalese royalty Many Sinhalese royals prior to the Kandyan era claimed descent from the families that accompanied the Sri Maha Bodhi. For example, Kawyashekaraya, a Kotte era literary source mentions: ‡∂∏‡∑Ñ‡∂∂‡∑ù ‡∂ª‡∂ö‡∑í‡∂± ‡∂Ω‡∑ô‡∑É ‡∑É‡∑ê‡∂Ω‡∑É‡∑î ‡∂∂‡∑ù ‡∂ö‡∂Ω‡∂ö‡∑ä‚Äå ‡∑Ä‡∑ê‡∑É ‡∂ë‡∂∏‡∑Ñ ‡∂∂‡∑ù ‡∂Ö‡∂∂‡∑í‡∂∫‡∑É ‡∑Ä‡∑í‡∑É‡∑ñ ‡∂ö‡∑î‡∂Ω‡∂∫‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∂∏‡∑ô‡∂Ω‡∂ö ‡∂∏‡∑î‡∂Ω‡∑ä ‡∂∂‡∑ê‡∑É ‡∑É‡∑í‡∂ª‡∑í ‡∑É‡∂ü‡∂∂‡∑ù ‡∂±‡∑í‡∂ª‡∑í‡∂≥‡∑î ‡∑Ä‡∑í‡∂ö‡∑î‡∂∏‡∑ä ‡∑Ä‡∑ê‡∂©‡∑í ‡∂∏‡∑Ñ‡∑É‡∑ô‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∂ª‡∂Ø‡∑î ‡∂ö‡∑í‡∂≠‡∑ä‡∑É‡∑í‡∂ª‡∑í ‡∂∏‡∑ö ‡∂±‡∑í‡∂ª‡∑í‡∂≥‡∑î ‡∂∂‡∑î‡∂¢‡∑É‡∑ä‚Äå ‡∂∏‡∑Ñ‡∂±‡∂∏ ‡∂ö‡∑î‡∂∏‡∂ª ‡∂Ø‡∑É‡∑ä‚Äå ‡∂ª‡∂≥‡∑î The above two verses refer to castes that were entrusted to protect the Bodhi tree establishing roots in the country and producing kings like Sirisangabo, Mahasen, Kithsiri mewan, Buddhdasa, Mahanama, and Kumaradasa. However, due to the absence of direct descendants who claim to be of this caste, it is difficult to prove that this is the same royal clan that lost power by the 17th century. The following provides further evidence for royal lineage: * The term \\"pannadura\\" literally means officials assigned with temples, or pannasala. In historical sources similar officials are referred to as aramikas and inscriptions as veherkami. The Mahavamsa historical chronicle states that King Aggabodhi I assigned a hundred of his relatives to be aramikas. * Some of the people belonging to this caste still attend to the duties assigned to the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi holy tree to this day. The head of the clan attending to Sri Maha Bodhi is known as mahaya,archives.dailynews.lk/2009/06/16/fea28.asparchives.dailynews.lk/2009/06/17/fea12.asparchives.dailynews.lk/2009/06/19/fea16.asp which is the old term used to denote the next in line to the kinship of country. * The Mehenavara clan (descendants of prince bodhiguptha) were the last line of traditional kings that ruled from Kandy.Rajarathnakaraya,Karunadasa Rupasinghe,S.Godage & Bros.,1995,pp 129 Descendants of the Mehenavara clan appear to have survived in the village of Mawela in Kotmale (Kobbekaduwa copper plate-given to Mehenavara Mawela Ratnavalli by king Sena Sammatha Vikramabahu of the same clan), which is the village associated with King Dutugemunu. Members of this caste and Nekathi caste live in Mawela to this day.https://archive.org/stream/agazetteercentr00lawrgoog#page/n79/mode/2up According to one legend, King Dutugemunu lived in Mawela in a house belonging to a person of this caste. * Village of origin of Jothiya Situ, ruler of Kandyan provinces during the reign of king Parakramabahu VI, and also known as Divanawatte Lankadikara (Madawala inscription)http://www.divaina.com/2009/10/04/siya10.html belonged to this caste.https://archive.org/stream/agazetteercentr01lawrgoog#page/n191/mode/2up Colonial period Since the 17th century, the status of the Bodhivansha caste gradually declined as a result of social changes taken place due to western colonial influence. Throughout the colonial period, particularly during the British colonial era, it was portrayed as several disconnected castes with names such as pannadura, villidura, and dura that were not in use prior to the 17th century. Jobs like grass cuttingBryce Ryan, Caste in Modern Ceylon, Rutgers University Press, 1953.1855 Ceylon GazetteerIevers, R. W., Manual of the North-central Province of Ceylon, 1899 have been proposed by various writers without referring to historical and literary sources like the Dipavamsa, Mahavamsa, or Pujavaliya. During this time of decline, they functioned mainly as soldiers, with some holding high ranks. Their military capability is visible even after the collapse of Kandyan kingdom, as they actively supported rebellions of 1818, 1834, and 1848. They also functioned as royal officers attached to various departments like the Kuruwe (elephant men), royal stables, and prisons. Some cared for the royal cattle shed and others held posts as , or grain measurers, of the royal storehouses.https://archive.org/stream/agazetteercentr00lawrgoog#page/n363/mode/2up Several others lived in royal villages of the type Bisogam (Queens villages),https://archive.org/stream/agazetteercentr01lawrgoog#page/n105/mode/2up Gabadagam (kings own villages) and especially Vihara/devala gam (Temple villages). As a result, Disputes are still in place between villagers and leading Buddhist institutions. Samarakkodi, second Adigar of King Kirti Sri Rajasinha, who was instrumental in re-establishing Buddhism in Sri Lanka is a high-ranking officer from this caste.Dumbara Harispattuwa Amarapura Puranaya,H.S.S Nishshanka,Department of Cultural Affairs,2000,pp 63 Notable members * Ihagama Unnanse (also known as Ihagama Babasa), leader of 1816, 1818, and 1834 rebellions to oust the British * Puran Appu (leader of the 1848 rebellion)http://www.divaina.com/2010/02/10/feature02.html * D.

In the U.S. state of Maryland, an segment of the route runs through central Maryland between Mount Rainier and Rising Sun. US 1 is paralleled by several major highways as it passes through Maryland, including Interstate 95 (I-95), the Baltimore‚ÄìWashington Parkway, US 29, and US 301. Thus, US 1 has lost its significance as a long distance route through the state. It is often congested, however, because it remains a major route in the individual towns it traverses. Route description =Prince George's County= US 1 leaves the District of Columbia as Rhode Island Avenue NE and just simply becomes Rhode Island Avenue, a four-lane divided street with parking through a downtown-like commercial area, right after crossing the intersection of Eastern Avenue NE (the MD/DC Line) and entering the city of Mount Rainier in Prince George's County, Maryland. US 1 then meets the intersections of 34th Street and Perry Street at a roundabout (which was finished being constructed during August 2001 replaced the traffic lights originally at this intersection), then continues northeast through a densely populated residential area. The highway leaves Mount Rainier and enters Brentwood, where the highway meets MD 208 (38th Street). US 1 passes through North Brentwood as a four-lane divided highway without parking through a mix of residences and commercial establishments. The median widens as the highway crosses the Northwest Branch Anacostia River and enters the City of Hyattsville. The highway begins to closely parallel CSX's Capital Subdivision and MARC's Camden Line as it reduces to a four-lane undivided highway, passing the District Court of Maryland for Prince George's County building. US 1 curves to the north and the highway's name changes to Baltimore Avenue at Farragut Street, shortly before intersecting US 1 Alternate. US 1 approaching Madison Street in Hyattsville US 1 continues north through downtown Hyattsville, gaining a center turn lane before entering the town of Riverdale Park, where the highway intersects MD 410 (East-West Highway). The highway enters a densely populated residential area, passing between Riverdale Park to the east and the town of University Park to the west. Shortly after the highway enters the city of College Park on the east, US 1 intersects Queens Chapel Road at a five-way intersection with the Town of University Park still on the west side. Only buses may enter Queens Chapel Road from US 1. The highway fully enters College Park and enters the commercial area that makes up the downtown of the college town, expanding to a four-lane divided highway. After the intersection with College Avenue and Regents Drive, US 1 passes through the campus of the University of Maryland at College Park, including the historic Rossborough Inn and Fraternity Row. The highway leaves the campus after intersecting Campus Drive, which is unsigned MD 594E, and crossing Paint Branch. US 1 continues through the northern part of College Park as a five- lane road with center turn lane, passing through a suburban commercial area. The highway intersects Greenbelt Road, which is unsigned MD 430, before meeting MD 193 (University Boulevard) at a partial interchange. All movements not provided in the interchange require using Greenbelt Road to connect between US 1 and MD 193. After intersecting Cherry Hill Road, US 1 becomes a divided highway and meets I-95/I-495 (Capital Beltway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. North of the interchange, the highway expands to a six-lane divided highway, leaving the town of College Park and passing by businesses and through a swath of the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, including the U.S. National Agricultural Library. At Sunnyside Avenue, the highway reduces to a five-lane road with center turn lane and passes through a suburban commercial area in the unincorporated town of Beltsville. The highway meets Rhode Island Avenue at an oblique intersection and MD 212 (officially MD 212A, Powder Mill Road) at a more orthogonal intersection, where US 1 begins a concurrency with MD 212. Past this the road curves north and parallels CSX's Capital Subdivision. The highway passes between a commercial strip on the southbound side of the highway and an industrial area on the east side of the railroad tracks. US 1 leaves Beltsville after crossing Indian Creek. The highway temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway before returning to a five-lane road, passing between an industrial area to the east and office parks to the west. The road comes to an intersection with the official eastern terminus of MD 212 (Ritz Way), where the signed MD 212 concurrency ends. After Muirkirk Meadows Drive, which leads to Muirkirk Road, US 1 reduces to a four- lane undivided highway, passes under the latter highway, and intersects the eastern terminus of MD 200 (Intercounty Connector) and the ICC Trail before it enters a forested area. US 1 southbound in Laurel US 1 gradually veers away from the railroad tracks as it approaches Laurel, passing Maryland National Memorial Park before entering a suburban commercial area ahead of Contee Road, where the center turn lane returns. At Cypress Street, the southbound direction gains a third lane through the intersection with Cherry Lane, where the northbound direction gains a third lane. After passing Towne Centre at Laurel and Laurel Shopping Center, US 1 splits into a one-way pair. The three to four northbound lanes veer northeast as Second Street, while the three to four southbound lanes take the name Washington Boulevard. The one-way pair intersects Bowie Road, the old alignment of MD 197, before intersecting MD 198, which takes the form of a one-way pair, eastbound Gorman Avenue and westbound Talbott Avenue. US 1 continues through the city of Laurel, intersecting Main Street just west of the Laurel MARC Station before leaving Laurel by crossing the Patuxent River into Howard County. =Howard County= Immediately after crossing the Patuxent River, both directions of US 1 pass entrances to Laurel Park Race Course. The highway continues through North Laurel, with the one-way pair coming together shortly before the intersection with Whiskey Bottom Road. US 1 continues north as a five-lane road with center turn lane, crossing Hammond Branch. As the highway passes through a commercial area in Savage, the road becomes a divided highway. After Gorman Road, the roadways temporarily diverge to cross the Little Patuxent River, then come together again at the full cloverleaf interchange with MD 32 (Patuxent Freeway). US 1 becomes undivided and intersects Guilford Road and crosses over the Columbia Branch from the CSX Capital Subdivision to the east. The highway passes several industrial parks, crossing Dorsey Run twice before intersecting MD 175 (Waterloo Road) in Jessup. North of Jessup, US 1 crosses Deep Run and passes more industrial parks. The highway intersects MD 103 (Meadowridge Road) and passes Meadow Ridge Memorial Park before a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 100 near Dorsey. Continuing northeast past Bealmear Branch, Old Washington Road splits to the northeast to pass through the center of Elkridge shortly before US 1 intersects the old alignment of MD 103, Montgomery Road. The highway passes through a shallow S-curve before receiving the other end of Old Washington Road and passes under the Capital Subdivision. US 1's two directions become divided by a Jersey barrier as the highway passes through the commercial strip in Elkridge, passing ramps to and from I-895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) immediately before crossing the upper Patapsco River into Baltimore County. =Baltimore City and County= After passing under I-895, US 1 intersects South Street, which provides access to St. Denis and Relay, and passes through its interchange with I-195 (Metropolitan Boulevard). The undivided highway crosses over CSX's Baltimore Terminal Subdivision before reaching the partial interchange with US 1 Alternate. Washington Boulevard continues straight northeast as US 1 Alternate through Halethorpe, while US 1 exits onto Southwestern Boulevard to head north through Arbutus. The three- lane road with center turn lane and extra-wide shoulders parallels Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and MARC's Penn Line. After crossing Herbert Run, US 1 parallels the long, linear parking lot of the Halethorpe MARC station. The highway leaves the station after passing under Francis Avenue. US 1 expands to a five-lane road with center turn lane as it crosses under I-95. US 1 passes under Sulphur Spring Road and I-695 (Baltimore Beltway) as the highway heads out of Arbutus. The only connection with I-695 is a single ramp, Exit 12A, from I-695 east to US 1 south. Inside the Beltway, US 1 is paralleled by Leeds Avenue, which intersects the federal highway just before entering the city of Baltimore. View north along US 1 (Fulton Street) at US 40 in Baltimore US 1 continues north as a four-lane divided street through a densely populated urban residential area. A short distance north of the city line, US 1 curves to the east onto Wilkens Avenue, which continues west as MD 372. The highway crosses Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and reduces to an undivided highway, intersecting US 1 Alternate (Caton Avenue) as it passes through a curve. US 1 crosses Gwynns Falls and CSX's Hanover Subdivision, expanding to a divided highway before passing the Deck of Cards rowhouses between Brunswick Street and Millington Avenue. A short distance to the east, US 1 turns north onto a one-way pair, Monroe Street southbound and Fulton Avenue northbound, to pass through a densely populated urban residential area on the west side of central Baltimore. US 1 meets the eastern terminus of MD 144 at another one-way pair, Pratt Street and Lombard Street. The highway passes over the US 40 freeway, which is accessed by the one-way pair adjacent to the freeway, Mulberry Street and Franklin Street. At Edmondson Avenue, Fulton Avenue becomes two-way; however, southbound US 1 remains on Monroe Street. Shortly after passing over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, US 1 reaches North Avenue. The Fulton Avenue/Monroe Street one-way pair continues north as MD 140, while both directions of US 1 turn east onto North Avenue. View of US 1 (North Avenue) in Baltimore, looking east at the intersection of Barclay Street North Avenue heads east as a four-lane undivided highway through the junction with MD 129, which follows southbound Druid Hill Avenue and northbound McCulloh Street. US 1 continues east as a four-lane divided highway with parking lanes. The highway meets I-83 (Jones Falls Expressway) and Mount Royal Avenue next to the North Avenue station of MTA Maryland's Baltimore Light RailLink. US 1 expands to six lanes and crosses over the light rail tracks, Jones Falls, MD 25 (Falls Road), and CSX's Baltimore Terminal Subdivision. Due north of downtown Baltimore, North Avenue intersects Charles Street (MD 139 to the north), St. Paul and Calvert Streets (MD 2 to the south), and Greenmount Avenue (MD 45 to the north), after which North Avenue passes along the north side of Greenmount Cemetery. North Avenue reduces to a four-lane undivided street east of MD 45. Shortly after intersecting MD 147 (Harford Road) and Broadway, US 1 turns northeast onto Bel Air Road. Now a four-lane undivided road, US 1 crosses the Baltimore Terminal Subdivision again and passes Clifton Park before reaching Erdman Avenue, which heads southeast as MD 151. The highway crosses Herring Run before intersecting Moravia Road, where Bel Air Road transitions from passing through densely populated residential neighborhoods to being the center of a commercial strip. US 1 intersects Frankford Avenue and Hamilton Avenue before leaving the city of Baltimore at Fleetwood Avenue, which forms the eastbound component of a one-way pair with Northern Parkway at the latter street's eastern terminus. US 1 passes through the inner suburb of Overlea, crossing Stemmers Run before meeting I-695 (Baltimore Beltway) at a cloverleaf interchange. US 1 continues northeast from the Beltway as a six-lane divided highway. The highway intersects Rossville Boulevard and Putty Hill Road, then crosses MD 43 (White Marsh Boulevard). US 1 accesses MD 43 via connectors with a right-in/right-out interchange southbound and an intersection with Dunfield Road northbound. North of MD 43, US 1 reduces to a four-lane undivided highway as it passes through Perry Hall, intersecting Silver Spring Road, Joppa Road, and Ebenezer Road in the midst of a commercial strip. After the intersection with Honeygo Boulevard, US 1 descends into a steep valley to cross Gunpowder Falls, passing southeast of a park and ride lot before the bridge. The highway continues north through a mix of farmland and residential subdivisions, heading through Kingsville before passing through Gunpowder Falls State Park and leaving Baltimore County by crossing Little Gunpowder Falls. =Harford and Cecil counties= US 1 northbound on the Hickory Bypass at US 1 Bus. in Bel Air North US 1 heads northeast into Harford County, passing through a forested area and then the residential subdivisions of Pleasant Hills before reaching MD 152 (Mountain Road). The highway continues east through a commercial strip toward the hamlet of Benson, where US 1 converges with MD 147 (Harford Road) at an acute angle. US 1 Business heads east from the intersection toward Bel Air, while US 1 continues northeast on the Bel Air Bypass. The bypass begins as a four-lane divided highway, but drops to a two- lane road before crossing Winters Run. US 1 intersects Tollgate Road, gaining a lane northbound, before meeting MD 24 (Vietnam Veterans Memorial Highway) at a T-intersection with sweeping right-turn ramps. MD 24 joins US 1 in a concurrency north on a four-lane undivided highway that passes under Vale Road. MD 24 leaves US 1 at a partial cloverleaf interchange with Rock Spring Road, which heads south as MD 924 toward downtown Bel Air. The bypass continues northeast with two lanes, its name changed to the Hickory Bypass before expanding to a four-lane divided highway and intersecting US 1 Business (Conowingo Road) south of Hickory. US 1 intersects the eastern end of MD 23 (East-West Highway) and MD 543 (Ady Road) before reducing to a two-lane road and receiving the northern end of US 1 Business. US 1 continues northeast as Conowingo Road through farmland. The old alignment of US 1, Forge Hill Road, splits to the east in Kalmia and rejoins the present highway later after separate crossings of Deer Creek. The highway passes through a commercial strip around the intersection with MD 136 (Whiteford Road/Priestford Road) as US 1 passes to the south of Dublin. US 1 curves east at the intersection with MD 440 (Dublin Road). Smith Road, another old alignment of US 1, splits to the northeast as US 1 heads toward Darlington, where it meets MD 161 (Main Street) and MD 623 (Castleton Road). The highway passes a weigh station on the southbound side that serves both directions and heads straight over a series of hills, gaining climbing lanes in either direction. At Shuresville Road, US 1 curves to the northeast and crosses the Susquehanna River on top of Conowingo Dam, a hydroelectric dam owned by Exelon, into Cecil County. US 1 northbound past US 222 in Conowingo Immediately on the east side of the river, US 1 intersects the northern terminus of MD 222 (Susquehanna River Road) and passes over Norfolk Southern Railway's Port Road Branch. The highway gains a climbing lane northbound as it ascends a hill to Conowingo, where the highway meets the southern terminus of US 222 (Rock Springs Road). US 1 turns east and meets a pair of old alignments: Connelly Road heading northwest and MD 591 (Colora Road) heading southeast toward a removed bridge over Octoraro Creek. After US 1 crosses the creek, the old alignment reconnects with the mainline as another segment of MD 591, Porters Bridge Road. West of Rising Sun, MD 273 (Rising Sun Road) continues straight toward the town while US 1 curves northeast as the Rising Sun Bypass. US 1 intersects the northern terminus of MD 276 (Jacob Tome Memorial Highway) and crosses Stone Run twice before turning north to the Pennsylvania state line. The highway continues across the state line toward Oxford, Pennsylvania, becoming a four-lane divided highway just across the state line. History =Colonial and turnpike eras= The original predecessors of US 1 were a collection of dirt roads cut through the forests and farmland of central and northern Maryland in the 18th century. Construction of these roads was governed by a 1704 Act of the Province of Maryland requiring counties to oversee construction and build wide roads to benefit transport of carts between population centers. The first segment of the road between Baltimore and Washington was built in 1741 between Baltimore and Elkridge (then known as Elkridge Landing) as a southward extension of a road between Baltimore and Hanover, Pennsylvania. Passage across the then wider and deeper upper Patapsco River at Elkridge Landing was provided by Norwood's Ferry. In 1749, the road was blazed to Georgetown on the Potomac River via Waterloo, Laurel, and Bladensburg. The highway north of Baltimore was a road constructed in the second half of the 18th century to connect the port of Baltimore with farms in Baltimore and Harford counties in Maryland and in Lancaster and Chester counties in Pennsylvania. From the docks in Baltimore, the road passed through Harry Dorsey Gough's plantation at Perry Hall (whence it was called \\"Gough's Road\\" or \\"Perry Hall Road\\" during this stretch) and Kingsville on its way to Bel Air. The highway headed east from Bel Air to Churchville, then north to a crossing of the Susquehanna River at Conowingo. The road continued east to Rising Sun, then turned north toward Oxford, Pennsylvania, where the highway connected with roads to Philadelphia. In the early 19th century, many of these dirt roads were reconstructed as turnpikes. The Washington Turnpike was chartered in 1796, but no road building ever occurred. It was not until the Washington and Baltimore Turnpike was chartered in 1812 that construction began along a right of way between the corner of Pratt and Eutaw Streets, then at the western city limits of Baltimore, southwest along the old dirt road to the District of Columbia boundary southwest of Bladensburg.Prince George's County Circuit Court, Land Survey, Subdivision, and Condominium Plats, Plat Drawer 11, File 17, Turnpike Road from the District of Columbia to the City of Baltimore In 1817, a timber toll bridge replaced Norwood's Ferry in Elkridge Landing. The Washington and Baltimore Turnpike had its chartered revoked in 1865 and the highway was turned over to the supervision of the counties. The toll bridge at Elkridge was sold to the counties in 1869. By 1825, a turnpike existed from Baltimore northeast toward Bel Air. The Bel Air Turnpike was constructed from the Baltimore city line of 1818 at the corner of North Avenue and North Gay Street through Perry Hall and Kingsville to a junction with the Harford Turnpike at Benson in Harford County. From Benson, the Bel Air Turnpike of Harford County continued east to Main Street in Bel Air. North of Bel Air, what is now US 1 followed county highways to the Conowingo Bridge, which was first constructed around 1820. =Construction of State Road No. 1= By the beginning of the 20th century, county maintenance of the corridor that would become US 1 was becoming inadequate for the increasing amount of traffic using the roads and becoming unacceptable to advocates of better roads. As a result, the General Assembly of Maryland passed the first state-aid road construction law in 1904, providing matching funds from the state to the counties to surface their major highways. As the most important corridor in the state, much of the state-aid money in the relevant counties went to the road from Baltimore to Washington. Feeling the work done by the counties with state funds was inadequate, in 1906, the General Assembly further appropriated a total of $90,000--$30,000 each in 1906, 1907, and 1908--toward reconstruction of the Baltimore- Washington Boulevard. The road between the city limits of Washington and Baltimore was officially designated State Route No. 1. Another $174,000 was appropriated by the state legislature in 1908. The 1908 act contained stipulations requiring a realignment of the road between Beltsville and Contee to eliminate two grade crossings of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad as well as grade separations with the railroad at Elkridge and Mount Winans. By 1910, the Baltimore-Washington Boulevard was paved from the District of Columbia boundary southwest of Bladensburg north to Beltsville, with small gaps at Northeast Branch south of Hyattsville and at Paint Branch in College Park; from Contee to Elkridge; and from Hammonds Ferry Road in Halethorpe to the Baltimore city line at Gwynns Falls. The General Assembly appropriated another $120,000 in 1910 for the newly formed two year old Maryland State Roads Commission to complete the Baltimore-Washington Boulevard. By 1915, State Route No. 1 was completely paved with the addition of the highway on a new alignment between Beltsville and Contee, the filling of the gaps in College Park and Hyattsville, and construction between Elkridge and Halethorpe. The road was constructed a minimum of in width with macadam, gravel, and concrete, with curves straightened and grades reduced. Concrete sections in Laurel, College Park, and Bladensburg were among the first concrete roads in Maryland when they were poured in 1912. Concrete girder bridges were built at Northeast Branch and the Anacostia River in Bladensburg. A concrete bridge was built over the Patapsco River at Elkridge to replace an earlier iron bridge. Due to heavy traffic and inadequate initial construction, many of the sections constructed in the first few years of state aid had to be later rebuilt. =Construction north of Baltimore= US 1 southbound past the intersection with MD 623 in Darlington All of present-day US 1 north of Baltimore, with the exception of the road from east of Rising Sun to the Pennsylvania state line, was designated one of the original state roads by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909.\\"Crossroads: The History of Perry Hall, Maryland,\\" by David Marks, pp. 75-77; 89-90. Published by Gateway Press, Inc., 1999. By 1910, the highway was paved from Bel Air to Kalmia. In 1910, the State Roads Commission purchased the Bel Air Turnpike, the Bel Air Turnpike of Harford County, and Conowingo Bridge from their private operators. SRC also paved its first section of the road from Oakwood to the crossing of Octoraro Creek that year. The road from Rising Sun to Sylmar Road was completed in 1911, along with Bel Air Road from the Baltimore city limits to Franklin Avenue. The paved section along Bel Air Road was extended northeast to Hamilton Avenue in 1912. That year also saw the first paving in Harford County from Kalmia to Deer Creek. The remainder of the highway in Harford County--from Little Gunpowder Falls to Bel Air and from Deer Creek to the Conowingo Bridge--was completed in 1913. Bel Air Road was finished in Baltimore County in 1914, and was paved from North Avenue to the Baltimore city limits, then just north of Erdman Avenue, in 1915. The highway was paved between the Conowingo Bridge and Oakwood in 1914. The state road was constructed along the alignment of the turnpikes without digression except for a relocation at Gunpowder Falls to reduce the grades on the hills. The final sections of what was to become US 1 were paved in Cecil County between 1917 and 1921, when the gap between Octoraro Creek and Rising Sun was filled and the Sylmar Road link from east of Rising Sun to the Pennsylvania state line was paved. =Reconstruction of State Road No. 1= The barrage of heavy military vehicles that travelled the Baltimore-Washington Boulevard during World War I, as well as the severe winter of 1917-18, devastated the highway. As a result, in 1918 and 1919 the highway was reconstructed from end to end. Some sections of the highway were completely rebuilt with concrete, while along of the road concrete shoulders, among the first applied in Maryland, were added to both widen and strengthen the road. By 1919, the entire length of the Baltimore-Washington Boulevard was a minimum width of . The only significant realignment during this reconstruction was the straightening out of Dead Man's Curve south of Elkridge. Massive increases in traffic during the 1920s made the reconstruction of the late 1910s obsolete within the decade. Construction to expand the entire length of the Baltimore- Washington Boulevard with two shoulders to in width, allowing for four lanes, began in 1928. The final sections of the expanded highway, between the District of Columbia line and Bladensburg and a bypass to the west of Elkridge and over the upper Patapsco River, including the present underpass of the B. & O. Railroad, were completed in 1931. The old colonial era Main Street through Elkridge was designated as Maryland Route 477 (MD 477). =Reconstruction north of Baltimore= US 1 southbound crossing the Susquehanna River on the Conowingo Dam When US 1 was designated in 1927, its route through Baltimore was the same as it is today except the federal highway entered the city from the southwest along Washington Boulevard. The highway turned north onto Monroe Street, which it followed to its present course north of Wilkens Avenue. US 1's first major relocation north of Baltimore occurred at the Susquehanna River. The Conowingo Bridge was removed before it could be inundated by the Conowingo Reservoir set to fill upon the completion of Conowingo Dam in 1928. The old approaches, which consisted of Smith Road from near Darlington to Glen Cove on the west side of the river and Connelly Road, Ragan Road, and Old Conowingo Road to the mouth of Conowingo Creek on the east side of the river, were replaced with the present highway between Smith Road and Connelly Road. Smith Road was redesignated MD 162, while the eastern approach became a western extension of MD 273. US 1 saw three realignments north of Baltimore in 1934. A relocation near Kalmia included a new bridge over Deer Creek. The old highway, which featured 26 curves, was designated MD 590. Another relocation occurred between Conowingo and Rising Sun, featuring a new bridge over Octoraro Creek. The old highway was designated MD 591. East of Rising Sun, a 90-degree turn was bypassed at the intersection of Telegraph Road (now MD 273) and Sylmar Road by the construction of a sweeping curve to the northwest of the intersection. The bypassed portion of Sylmar Road was designated MD 592. Bel Air Road was expanded started in 1933. US 1 was widened to from the Baltimore city line northeast to Joppa Road. The highway was widened to from Joppa Road to Bel Air. The road was the first construction in Maryland of a three-lane road with center turn lane. =Baltimore-Washington Boulevard receives relief= US 1 near Laurel in 1940 Despite the widening of US 1 between Baltimore and Washington in the late 1920s, the highway continued to be a major problem for both local and through traffic. The very high traffic levels made the highway a very attractive location for businesses serving travelers, leading to the sobriquet of \\"hot dog highway.\\" The captive audience also led to the construction of over 1000 billboards between the two cities, spurring another nickname: \\"billboard boulevard.\\" US 1 was also nicknamed \\"bloody Mary\\" due to the very high accident rate on the highway. After 1930, businesses were packed up to the edge of the four-lane, shoulder-less road that was largely built on an alignment poorly suited for the increasing speeds of vehicles. Thus, further expansion of the highway or safety improvements were impossible without expensive condemnation proceedings or relocating the highway. Businesses were adamantly against the latter solution. In 1939, US 1's departure north from Washington Boulevard in Baltimore was moved south from Monroe Street to Caton Avenue just north of the city line. From Caton Avenue, US 1 followed Wilkens Avenue to Monroe Street. Caton Avenue and Wilkens Avenue were expanded between 1936 and 1938, including removal of streetcar tracks and expansion to a divided boulevard on Wilkens Avenue, to handle the increased traffic as a \\"through-street.\\" By 1946, a Bypass US 1 was signed following Caton Avenue north from Wilkens Avenue, continuing on Hilton Street to North Avenue, then taking North Avenue east to rejoin US 1 at Monroe Street. Southwestern Boulevard was completed in 1950 as a dual highway through Arbutus, with grade separations with Sulphur Spring Road and Francis Avenue. US 1 was moved to its present alignment along that boulevard and Wilkens Avenue and old US 1 through Halethorpe was designated US 1 Alternate. During World War II, US 1 was relocated from Baltimore Avenue and Bladensburg Road between Washington and Hyattsville to Rhode Island Avenue, which was widened to in 1940. Rhode Island Avenue between Mount Rainier and Hyattsville had originally been MD 411. The old US 1 south of Hyattsville became US 1 Alternate. Despite these relocations and upgrades, true relief did not come until the first limited-access highway between Baltimore and Washington, the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, was completed in 1954 to remove long distance traffic from US 1. With the completion of that highway and later the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel Thruway (I-895) in 1957 and later Interstate 95 (I-95), US 1 between the two cities became a highway mainly for local traffic. =Recent improvements= US 1 and MD 24 northbound on the Bel Air Bypass Dead Man's Curve was bypassed south of Elkridge in 1946. A bypass of Laurel was constructed around 1950. In 1952, northbound US 1 was placed on Fulton Avenue in West Baltimore opposite southbound US 1 on Monroe Street. North Avenue was widened to a divided highway for much of its US 1-designated length by 1957. By 1960, this bypass had become the northbound lanes of the present one-way pair. US 1 north of Baltimore was reconstructed to modify curves and widen the road in the 1950s. The highway was reconstructed in Cecil County from Conowingo Dam to Rising Sun in 1952 and 1953 and from Rising Sun to Sylmar in 1954. US 1 in Harford County was reconstructed from Little Gunpowder Falls to north of Deer Creek in 1952 and 1953 and to Conowingo Dam between 1954 and 1956. In Howard County, the highway was resurfaced from Elkridge to Waterloo in 1954 and from Waterloo to the Patuxent River in 1956. By 1958, US 1 was being widened from Laurel to Beltsville. The highway's bypass of Rising Sun was completed in 1957. MD 273 was extended west from Sylmar through Rising Sun along the old alignment to the southern end of the bypass. The Bel Air bypass was placed under construction in 1964 and completed in 1965, resulting in the designation of US 1 Business along the old road through Bel Air. The Bel Air bypass was extended north around Hickory in 2000, with US 1 Business extended to meet the northern end of the bypass.

This geothermal area is present generally from Mount Vesuvius beneath a wide area including Pompei, Herculaneum, and from the volcanic area of Campi Flegrei beneath Naples and over to Pozzuoli and the coastal Baia area. Mining and various infrastructure projects during several millennia have formed extensive caves and underground structures in the zone. Geology Over millennia, extreme geothermal pressure has helped form a strong, durable tuffaceous volcanic sandstone called tuff, a rock composed of compressed and compacted volcanic ash ejected during a volcanic eruption. The entire Naples area is a geothermal region with deep veins of the tuff sandstone, generically referred to as \\"yellow tuff\\". It runs in deep veins beneath Naples and the area around it in strata which are found at different depths. Mining and subterranean structures Tuff is strong and easily worked, making it an ideal building material. Tuff was mined through access and removal shafts called the occhio di monte, (\\"eye of the mountain\\"). Through these shaft, gigantic blocks of tuff were quarried and pulled up. The resulting void was a bottle shaped cavity with sloping shoulders, which provided ample reinforcement to prevent future cave-ins. After the tuff was quarried it was used as building material during roughly the Angevin, Aragonese and Bourbon periods. The resulting caverns were later used to form water reservoirs into which water was diverted from the main aqueducts, and the Ancient Greeks dug long and elaborate aqueducts beneath the city more than 2,500 years ago. These provided fresh water to the villas and palaces above through use of the deep reservoirs and cisterns. Well shafts were also dug offering community access to the reservoirs below. A water channel, now traveled by tourists. White deposits low on the walls show the typical previous water level. Over the centuries a massive honeycomb of caverns and passageways has been created beneath Naples and its environs. In World War II many of the quarry shafts were enlarged and spiraling stairways were added, opening up the caverns for use as air raid shelters. The resulting cavities beneath the city can now be divided up into several major categories: *Aqueducts and sewer tunnels; * Rainwater cisterns, reservoirs and aqueduct diversionary channels; * Caverns left from quarrying of tuff; * The remains of Nero's \\"lost\\" theatre; * Greco-Roman businesses, such as the remains of an ancient forum that was preserved in a mud slide; * Other voids from removal of sand and other types of materials; * Interconnecting tunnels and passageways among caverns; * Places of worship, including catacombs and pre-Christian hypogea (cult burial chambers); * Major ancient and modern roadway tunnels, and rail and subway tunnels. Today, tours of the elaborate underground beneath Naples are available and there is even a museum of the underground located beneath Piazza Cavour in a huge quarry cavity with connecting tunnels and aqueduct passageways. It contains elaborate replicas of Greek hypogea and many ancient artifacts discovered during more than half a century of exploration.

Etymology The name Al-Badr means the full moon and refers to the Battle of Badr. History =Organization= Al-Badr was constituted in September 1971 under the auspices of General Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi, then chief of the Pakistan Army eastern command. Members of Al-Badr were recruited from public schools and madrasas (religious schools). The unit was used for raids and special operations; the Pakistan army command initially planned to use the locally recruited militias (Al-Badr, Razakar, Al-Shams) for policing cities of East Pakistan, and regular army units to defend the border with India. Most members of Al-Badr appear to have been Biharis.Siddiqui 1990, p. 153.. Despite their similarities in opposing the independence of Bangladesh, the Razakar and Al-Badr had differences; Razakars opposed the Mukti Bahini in general, while Al-Badr's tactics were terrorism and political killings. All three groups operated under Pakistani command. =Dissolution= After the surrender of the Pakistan Army on 16 December 1971, Al-Badr was dissolved together with the Razakar and Al-Shams. Many members were arrested. During the time of president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, all of the collaborators, including those of Al-Badr were pardoned and in 1975 any attempt to try them was repealed. War crimes Al-Badr perpetrated atrocities against civilians during the war of 1971, in particular, the massacre of intellectuals in Dhaka that occurred on 14 December 1971.P. Hazelhurst in The Times, 3 Jan 1972, p. 4. They then dumped the bodies in the Rayer Bazaar area of Dhaka. According to journalist Azadur Rahman Chandan, Al-Badr was experimentally launched in Jamalpur, Mymensingh on April 1971 as a voluntary force with Islami Chhatra Shangha activists as its first recruits to wage war against the nationalist fighters. They were enlisted and trained under the guidance of Mohammad Kamaruzzaman, the assistant secretary general of Jamaat.

The group was banned by the independent government of Bangladesh, but most of its members had fled the country during and after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, which led to Bangladesh's independence. Naming and inspirations Al-Shams is an Arabic word meaning 'The Sun'. Al Shams and Al-Badr were local Bengali and Bihari armed groups formed by the Pakistan Army which were mostly recruited from the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami to fight out and resist Mukti Bahini. Background On 25 March 1971, after Operation Searchlight, the exiled leadership of what is now Bangladesh declared independence from Pakistan and armed struggle against the Pakistani Army began. This struggle was spearheaded by elements of Mukti Bahini with strong support from India. As most of the locals were in support of Mukti Bahini and those who were not were killed by Mukti Bahini, the Pakistani Army, composed largely of elements from Punjab, found itself and its cause pretty much alienated from the local populace. To counter this situation, the Pakistan Army accepted help from Islamic fundamentalist parties including Jamaat-e- Islami, proclaiming Jihad against Indians, to seek unity among the population for the two wings of Pakistan, in the name of religion. It described Bengali nationalism as an Indo-Zionist conspiracy. The PPP played an active role in its formation. It also recruited from the Urdu speaking Bihari population of East-Pakistan. This Jihad was between the Pakistani Army and the liberation forces and their supporters (Indians and Mukti Bahini). To recruit the local populace into fighting the independence movement, two sister organisations Al Badr (literally meaning The Moon, but also has a reference to the famous Battle of Badr) and Al Shams were formed. Activities The organisations was supported by local wing of Jamaat-e-Islam Pakistan who declared it a Jihad. The organisation worked as the local guides for Pakistan Army supporting the troops providing logistics and information. It arrested suspects and transported them to interrogation centres that used torture. It carried out looting, rape and violence on the civilian population. According to witnesses before the International Crimes Tribunal, the Al Shams was under the command of Fazlul Quader Chowdhury and led on the ground by his son Salauddin Quader Chowdhury in Chittagong. The other important members were former M.P. Syed Wahidul Alam of Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Saifuddin Quader Chowdhury, the younger brother of Saluddin Quader Chowdhury. They used to patrol the neighbourhoods of Satkania, Rauzan, Boalkhali, Patia and Rangunia in a jeep. They would set fire to Hindu houses and arrest anybody they suspected of being supportive towards the Mukti Bahini. The suspects were taken to Salauddin Quader Chowdhury's residence Goods Hill, which had been converted to a torture cell, where they were tortured and killed. Their bodies were disposed of in the Karnafuli. On 12 December, the Al Shams and the Al Badr leadership jointly prepared the blueprint for killing the intellectuals. The Al Shams and Al Badar leadership met with Major General Rao Farman Ali and finalised the blueprint. Abolition The general surrender of 16 December 1971 culminates all armed resistance from Pakistani side and the two organisations ceased to exist.

Since 2003, it has set the bar for beachfront airshows across the United States and is currently one of the largest airshows in North America. What sets it apart, aside from being a beach show, is the fact that it usually occurs on a Wednesday. It takes place along the beaches of Atlantic City, New Jersey, in front of the world-famous boardwalk, with the casinos in the background. Flybys and demonstrations as high as and as low as over the water in front of the Atlantic City skyline. It is produced by a joint venture of the Atlantic City Chamber of Commerce, the New Jersey Air National Guard's 177th Fighter Wing, The Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa, David Schultz Airshows, The Press of Atlantic City and WOND-AM. In 2020, the airshow had its first cancellation in its history due to the COVID-19 pandemic. About The airshow itself primarily showcases military aviation, with demonstrations from the USAF Thunderbirds, United States Navy Blue Angels, US Army Golden Knights, as well as demonstrations from current Air Force and Navy aircraft, such as the A-10 Thunderbolt II, AV-8B Harrier, F-14 Tomcat, F-15 Eagle, F-15E Strike Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon, and the F/A-18F Super Hornet. Military flybys over the four years of the airshow have included the B-2 Spirit, C-5 Galaxy, C-17 Globemaster III, C-130 Hercules, C-141 Starlifter, F-22 Raptor, KC-10 Extender, KC-135 Stratotanker, and the P-3 Orion. Helicopters that have showed up over the years include the MH-60S Knighthawk, the HH-60 Jayhawk, the CH-146 Griffon, and the HH-65 Dauphin (the HH-60 and HH-65 - usually two HH-65s - perform a simultaneous search and rescue demonstration over the water). Aerobatic performers over the years have included Kirby Chambliss, Doug Dodge, Michael Hunter, John Klatt, and Sean Tucker. The Horseman Mustang Demonstration by Jim Beasley and Ed Shipley have also appeared along with the Skytypers and the Vultures Formation Team. The FAA's William J Hughes Technical Center at Atlantic City International Airport has showcased itsConvair 440, Boeing 727-100, and Gulfstream in the show as well. The New Jersey State Police have also shown its Bell 206 and Sikorsky S-76 helicopters in the airshows. Show center is marked in front of Boardwalk Hall (Florida Avenue) and the beach. Aircraft staging for the airshow is done at Atlantic City International Airport and at McGuire AFB, both of which are off-limits to the public. The USAF Heritage Flight and the US Navy Legacy Flight have also performed at the show. Announcers The announcers for the Thunder Over the Boardwalk Airshow have included Gordon Bowman-Jones (2003 and 2005), Howdy McCann (2004 and 2006) and Pinky Kravitz (2003-2014). Shows =2003= The first show took place on August 27, 2003, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of powered flight. Headlining the show were the Thunderbirds and the Golden Knights. The show also featured demonstrations from the A-10, F-14, F-15, and F-16, all jam packed into a five and a half hour flying display. The weather was not very favorable, as it was hazy for the entire day.

High winds curtailed the Golden Knights and Black Daggers from jumping and caused sea spray coming off the ocean to ruin any chances of photographers getting decent pictures. The show was still a success, with over 200,000 people attending.

In March, it was formally announced that the Blue Angels would be joining the Thunderbirds for the 2006 show. Joining the Blues and Birds were a slew of performers making their Atlantic City debut, including Sean Tucker, the new F-15E Strike Eagle Demonstration Team, the B-2 Spirit, the F-4 Phantom, and the F-22 Raptor. The weather had turned out to be fantastic, with over 600,000 people attending the airshow, making the 2006 airshow one of the largest events ever held in Atlantic City up until that time. All of the pieces of the puzzle had fit together nicely and both jet teams held their annual reunion at Atlantic City.

This year, spending cuts by the United States federal government due to budget sequestration forced the US military to cancel all appearances at airshows, including this show. As a result, there were no US military flybys, jet demonstration teams, parachute teams, or solo demonstrations by select fighters. While many airshows elsewhere were canceled due to the absence of US military support, Atlantic City organizers decided the show was going to be held regardless. At the same time, they had a challenge: more commercial acts meant that organizers were looking for more donations to cover the costs of this airshow. Overall, they still managed to put on a good show even without the US military to provide the \\"thunder\\" that gave this airshow its name. =2014= The show returned to its traditional month of August. It was held on Wednesday, August 13. With the end of sequestration, US military participants returned to the show.

The show takes place over the Atlantic Ocean, which means that one is facing the sun all morning and into the afternoon. Getting decent pictures of the aircraft as they pass by the casinos is not difficult at all, as well as getting pictures of the Golden Knights as they land, with the casinos in the background. Photographers on the beach at show center cannot get that many pictures of aircraft when they are at show left because the Pier at Caesars juts out into the ocean about and is a virtual obstruction either way. Because of the pier, aircraft are forced to fly almost half a mile away from the shore line for safety reasons.

Bittenbinder was parodied in the cult favorite sketch comedy program Mr. Show. In the episode \\"Now Who Wants Ice Cream?\\", the comedian Bob Odenkirk portrayed F. F. Woodycooks, a bizarre, nasal-voiced host of a television show about crime, who was a parody of Bittenbinder. Woodycooks even has a strange mustache like Bittenbinder's and uses unusual and funny-sounding phrases to refer to criminals. Woodycooks hosts a show called Take Back the Streets in which he shows dramatizations of crimes. The sketch ends with Woodycooks promoting his \\"F. F. Woodycooks Ice Cream Parlour Precincts\\". Mr. Show writer Paul F. Tompkins states that he came up with the idea for the sketch after he heard Bittenbinder refer to a couple of rapists as \\"goofs\\".

The award is given to the performers, producers, audio engineers and mastering engineer for new songs in Spanish or Portuguese language. The songs included on an album released the previous year of submission are also eligible only if they have not been submitted to competition before. Instrumental songs are also eligible. Due to the increasing musical changes in the industry, from 2012 the category includes 10 nominees, according to a restructuration made by the academy for the four general categories: Song of the Year, Album of the Year, Best New Artist and Record of the Year. 14 of the eighteen awarded songs have also earned the Latin Grammy for Song of the Year, which unlike this category, is given to the songwriters.

The character first appeared in Detective Comics #81 (November 1943) and was created by Don Cameron and Bob Kane. Fictional character biography =Mortimer Drake= Mortimer Drake was a man of exotic and idiosyncratic taste. When he found himself unable to purchase more exotic valuables for his collection legally, he resorted to theft. Donning a costume resembling that of a Musketeer, he called himself the Cavalier. His course of actions ultimately brought him into conflict with Batman and Robin. His code of gallantry was important to him; in one story, he helps an old woman carry her groceries in the middle of making his escape. Drake matched wits against Batman and Robin several times, and escaped them in each encounter, but Batman was able to deduce the Cavalier's identity, leading to Drake's eventual imprisonment. In Batman Family #10, Batgirl and Batwoman teamed up to defeat Killer Moth and the Cavalier. Cavalier could not find a way around his code, which prevented hitting females, but after a self-examination he concludes \\"the devil with gallantry\\" and hit Batgirl with his fist. Five issues later, in Batman Family #15, Killer Moth teamed up with Cavalier again and made a bet with him that he could find the way into the Batcave from Batgirl before the Cavalier could get the same knowledge from Robin. While Killer Moth was led to a fake cave, Cavalier was shown a large nest, which led the Cavalier to the conclusion that Robin was an alien bird lifeform. Before Crisis on Infinite Earths the Cavalier existed both on Earth-One and Earth-Two. The stories where he harmed women, something that neither the Earth-One nor Earth-Two versions of him would ever do, can be assigned to the alternate world of Earth-B, an alternate Earth that included stories that could not be considered canonical on Earth- One or Earth-Two.letter page on Who's Who: The Definitive Directory to the DC Universe #9 (November, 1985) Later \\"Earth-B\\" would be formally divided into two separate Earths: Earth-Twelve and Earth-Thirty-Two.Crisis on Infinite Earths: Absolute Edition (Nov. 2005) Post-Crisis, Cavalier appeared in Justice League America #43-44 as part of a group of supervillain drinking buddies who were trying to regain their lost items of power. He was defeated by Blue Beetle, who clotheslined him in an alleyway. During Knightfall, he faced Batman once again, but was defeated with ease. Cavalier had become insane and was kept in Arkham Asylum. It remains to be seen how Drake went insane, or if his origin has changed because of the first crisis. The Cavalier was later said to have been in a closeted gay relationship with Captain Stingaree, another low-level Batman villain. He appeared in Justice League of America #2 as an informant for Black Lightning within the Society. His back was broken by Bane in Secret Six #7, but he acted as a bodyguard for Leslie Thompkins in Battle for the Cowl: Gotham Gazette.Gotham Gazette: Batman Alive? #1 (July 2009) Both stories were published in the spring of 2009, though their relative chronology has yet to be determined. In Red Robin #16 he is shown to still be acting as a bodyguard to Dr. Leslie Thompkins.Red Robin #16 The Cavalier's re- entry into active crime followed, when he was seen attempting multiple small heists around Gotham, only to be foiled each time by Batman or Catwoman. However, those small crimes were merely an attempt to hide his role as the mastermind behind the embezzlement of millions of dollars from the Wayne Enterprises pension fund. Eventually, Batman and Catwoman, working together, were able to follow the money trail to Drake, expose his role in the embezzlement, and return the funds.Batman/Catwoman: Follow the Money #1 (Jan. 2011) In September 2011, The New 52 revised the fictional history and characters portrayed in the DC Comics superhero comic book line. In this line- wide revision, Cavalier is now a user of the fictional strength-enhancing drug called Venom. He is shown battling Batwoman.Batman: The Dark Knight (vol. 2) #2 (October 2011) =Hudson Pyle= In Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight #32-34 (June‚ÄìJuly 1992) writer James Robinson and Tim Sale introduced a new Cavalier by the name of Hudson Pyle into the Batman official continuity in his story-arc entitled Blades. Since Blades takes place early on in Batman's career, Hudson Pyle is actually the original Cavalier, and therefore may have even influenced Mortimer Drake. In Blades, Pyle, an ex-Hollywood stuntman looking for fame, becomes the Cavalier, a masked crimefighting vigilante that brandishes a razor-sharp sword, quick wit, and handsome smile. It is not long before the people of Gotham fall in love with the new hero. While Pyle's motives and actions are revealed to be honorable, he harbors a dark secret which ultimately leads to his downfall. Pyle is in love with a woman who is being blackmailed by gangsters, and as a result of this winds up being blackmailed as well. In order to save his love, Pyle is forced to commit burglaries and thus loses the confidence of the people. Pyle soon kills the gangsters. He comes into conflict with Batman, defeating him in a sword duel. He leaves Batman, who is very weak and feverish after injuries sustained in a previous fight, and purposely charges nearby police officers. He is gunned down and dies of his injuries. The beginning of the Blackest Night series shows that his remains are in the Justice League's storage facilities for dead supervillains.Blackest Night #1 (September 2009) He is one of many dead supervillains revived as members of the Black Lantern Corps.Blackest Night #4 (December 2009) =DC Rebirth= DC Comics included Cavalier in \\"DC Rebirth\\", a line-wide revision of the fictional history and characters portrayed in the DC Comics superhero comic book line. In this revised version, Cavalier wears the costume traditionally worn by Pyle, but his real name is unknown. Cavalier is one of the many villains taken down by Batman and Catwoman after he takes her along with him on an average night of his job.Batman vol. 3 #14 While imprisoned he joined the Suicide Squad but was killed on his first mission. Suicide Squad Vol. 6 #1. DC Comics. Powers and abilities The Cavalier has no superhuman abilities. He is however, a good athlete and a skilled hand-to- hand combatant and swordsman. He carries a rapier that emits electric blasts. The feather plume in the Cavalier's hat is actually a steel-tipped dart. In other media =Television= * The Cavalier was considered to be featured in The New Batman Adventures. Regarding the character, producer and writer Paul Dini once stated: \\"We've thought about using the Cavalier, and will probably get around to telling his story sooner or later\\". Later, Dini stated that the Cavalier's chances for an appearance in the series had become a \\"long shot\\". Ultimately, the Cavalier did not appear in the show, though he did appear in the accompanying comic book Batman: Gotham Adventures. In it, he wore the Hudson Pyle costume.http://www.worldsfinestonline.com/WF/sections/backstage/unused/batman/cavalier.php * The Mortimer Drake version of Cavalier appeared in several Batman: The Brave and the Bold episodes. He first appears in \\"The Eyes of Despero!\\" voiced by Greg Ellis in an Elizabethan era style accent to which Batman remarks \\"Somewhere Shakespeare is spinning in his grave\\". The Dark Knight makes quick work of Cavalier before being sent to space by Hal Jordan's ring. Cavalier later returns in \\"Night of the Huntress!\\" as an inmate of Blackgate Prison trying to break out. He makes another appearance in \\"A Bat Divided\\" where he is hanging out with the other villains in a bar. When Firestorm and the three Batmen show up, Cavalier is the only villain who notices there are three Batmen stating: \\"Methinks mine eyes deceive me! Batman thrice?\\" Cavalier is subsequently tasered by the normal Batman and is defeated. He also makes a cameo as one of the singing prisoners in \\"Mayhem of the Music Meister!\\" The Cavalier appears again in \\"Night of the Batmen\\" where he battles Green Arrow who is disguised as Batman. During the fight, the Cavalier exclaims \\"Have at thee, thou dankish, foul-born ratsbane!\\" The Cavalier's most substantial role was in \\"Bold Beginnings\\" where he is the starring villain of the cold open. In it, Batman and Green Arrow fight Cavalier who has captured Ruby Ryder. It turns out that Cavalier and Ruby Ryder were in collaboration when they trapped Batman and Green Arrow. Batman and Green Arrow manage to escape the death trap and defeat Cavalier and Ruby Ryder. * The Mortimer Drake version of Cavalier also appears in the DC Super Hero Girls TV series, voiced by Griffin Puatu. In this series, he is a high school stage actor like Oliver Queen/Green Arrow, and he harbors a grudge against Zatanna after she upstaged him in an elementary school play. =Radio= * The Cavalier battled Batman during a brief exchange in the 1994 BBC radio adaptation of Batman: Knightfall. He was one of the escaped Arkham Asylum inmates. After Batman defeats the Cavalier, the foppish rogue says, \\"You broke my nose, you cad!\\" The Cavalier was portrayed by actor Kerry Shale.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGCBc1Gxo-M =Miscellaneous= Cavalier was the villain in Wonder Woman #212 (July 1974), the first issue of her twelve labors to rejoin the pre-Crisis Justice League of America. Cavalier appeared in The Batman Adventures #1 (June 2003).

The award is given to the performers, producers, audio engineers and mastering engineers for vocal or instrumental albums with 51% of new recorded songs. Albums of previously released recordings, such as reissues, compilations of old recordings and greatest hits albums packages are not eligible. Due to the increasing musical changes in the industry, from 2012 the category includes 10 nominees, according to a restructuration made by the academy for the four general categories: Song of the Year, Record of the Year, Best New Artist and Album of the Year. Beginning in 2018, songwriters are eligible for the accolade if 33% of the playing time are composed by them. Juan Luis Guerra has won the most awards in the category with four wins (one as a producer). Alejandro Sanz and Juanes have won three times each. They are followed by Calle 13 and Luis Miguel with two winning albums. Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira became the first female recipient in 2006. Most nominated albums were recorded in Spanish language, though Djavan, Chico Buarque, Gilberto Gil, Ivan Lins, Maria Rita, Ivete Sangalo, Tribalistas and Caetano Veloso have been nominated for albums recorded in Portuguese language, with Lins winning the award in 2005 for Cantando Hist√≥rias. Some of the awarded albums have also earned the Grammy Award, such as No Es Lo Mismo and Para√≠so Express, recorded by Sanz, La Vida... Es un Ratico and MTV Unplugged Deluxe Edition by Juanes and Vida by Draco Rosa, for Best Latin Pop Album; La Llave de Mi Coraz√≥n by Guerra, for Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album; Salsa Big Band by Rub√©n Blades with Roberto Delgado & Orquesta for Best Tropical Latin Album; Fijaci√≥n Oral Vol. 1 by Shakira, for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album; ¬°M√©xico Por Siempre! by Luis Miguel, for Best Regional Mexican Music Album (including Tejano); Los de Atr√°s Vienen Conmigo by Calle 13 for Best Latin Urban Album; and El Mal Querer by Rosal√≠a for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album. Miguel Bos√© is the most nominated performer without a win, with five unsuccessful nominations.

It is an erect shrub with egg-shaped leaves with a sharp-pointed tip and with clusters of white flowers arranged near the end of the branches. It grows in Victoria, New South Wales and the far south-east of Queensland. Description Epacris breviflora is an erect shrub which usually grows to a height of and has hairy young branches. The leaves are egg-shaped long and about wide. The leaves have a rounded base and a sharply pointed tip. The flowers are clustered in the axils of the upper leaves. There are 10 to 23 bracts at the base of the flowers and five sepals long. The petals are joined to form a white, bell-shaped tube long with five lobes on the end, long. The five stamens and the single style are mostly enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering is mainly in summer but flowers are usually present throughout the year. The fruit are capsules about long. Taxonomy and naming Epacris longiflora was first formally described in 1910 by Otto Stapf and the description was published in Bulletin of Miscellaneous Information. The specific epithet (breviflora) is derived from the Latin words brevis meaning \\"short\\" and flos meaning \\"flower\\". Distribution and habitat Drumstick heath mainly occurs along the Great Dividing Range from far south-eastern Queensland to eastern Victoria, sometimes at lower altitudes subject to cooler temperatures. It grows in swamps and other damp places.

A dry lab might have large experimental equipment but minimal chemicals, or instruments for analyzing data produced elsewhere.  Overview  China Medical University (Taiwan)'s Laboratory A wet lab is a type of laboratory in which a wide range of experiments are performed, for example, characterizing of enzymes in biology, titration in chemistry, diffraction of light in physics, etc. - all of which may sometimes involve dealing with hazardous substances. Due to the nature of these experiments, the proper appropriate arrangement of safety equipment are of great importance. The researchers (the occupants) are required to know basic laboratory techniques including safety procedures and techniques related to the experiments that they perform.  Laboratory design  At the present, lab design tends to focus on increasing the interactions between researchers through the use of open plans, allowing the space and opportunity for researchers to exchange ideas, share equipment, and share storage space; increasing productivity and efficiency of experiments. This style of design has been proposed to support team-based work, though more compartmentalised or individual spaces are still important for some types of processes which require separate/isolated space such as electron microscopes, tissue cultures, work/workers that may be disturbed by noise levels, etc. Flexibility of laboratory design should also be promoted, for example, the wall and ceiling should be removable in case of expansion or contraction, the pipes, tubes and fume hoods should also be removable for future expansion, reallocation and change of use. A well thought-through design will ensure that a lab can be adjusted for any future use. The sustainability of resources is also a concern, so the amount of resources and energy used in the lab should be reduced where possible to save the environment, but still yield the same products. As a laboratory consists of many areas such as wet lab, dry lab and office areas, wet labs should be separated from other spaces using controlling devices or dividers to prevent cross-contamination or spillage. Due to the nature of processes used in wet labs, the environmental conditions may need to be carefully considered and controlled using a cleanroom system.

The award is given to the songwriters of new songs containing at least 51% of lyrics in Spanish or Portuguese language. Instrumental songs or a new version of a previously recorded track are not eligible. Due to the increasing musical changes in the industry, from 2012 the category includes 10 nominees, according to a restructuration made by the academy for the four general categories: Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Best New Artist and Song of the Year. Eleven of the thirteen awarded songs have also earned the Latin Grammy for Record of the Year, which unlike this category, is given to songs that were released on a promotional level, and the prize is given to the performer, producer and audio engineer. The exceptions to this were in 2000, 2009 and 2013 when \\"Coraz√≥n Espinado\\" by Santana featuring Man√°, \\"No Hay Nadie Como T√∫\\" by Calle 13 featuring Caf√© Tacvba and \\"Vivir Mi Vida\\" by Marc Anthony, respectively, received the award without a nomination for Song of the Year.

The film begins with the narrator, former U.S. ambassador to Japan, Joseph C. Grew, stating that he has lived in Japan for ten years and that their logic is incomprehensible by Western standards, and that they are 2,000 years behind in ethical, social thinking. The film is an odd assortment of truths and untruths; for instance, it was true that Japan had been geared to a war path for the last 11 years, that it was a totalitarian society with a tightly controlled press and militaristic education system, and that war production was being carried out in family houses. However other things are statements of prejudice, or unsubstantiated: it implies several times that the Japanese are not inventive or resourceful, and that they get many of their ideas from the west, \\"aping American newspapers\\" or copying Nazi propaganda. It also states that the Shinto religion had always been, and that the Japanese people had always believed, an ideology preaching world domination and fascism--in fact the militarist brand of Shinto was a comparatively recent development.

These hotels may attract both business conferences and vacationing tourists and offer more than a convenient place to stay.Alvin L. Arnold, Arnold Encyclopedia of Real Estate, John Wiley and Sons (1995). These hotels may be referred to as major conference center hotels, flagship hotels, destination hotels, and destination resorts. The market for conference and resort hotels is a subject for market analysis.Grant Ian Thrall, Business Geography and New Real Estate Market Analysis, Oxford University Press, Oxford, England (2002). These hotels as destinations may be characterized by distinctive architecture, upscale lodgings, ballrooms, large conference facilities, restaurants, and recreation activities such as golf or skiing. They may be located in a variety of settings from major cities to remote locations.  History  Since the 1800s, the traditional concept full- service conference and resort hotels have been based upon a venue which is typically remote and has a natural feature as its attraction. For example, the Kviknes Hotel in Norway is a difficult to reach remote location which provides visitors access to the scenic fjord at Balestrand or The Brando Resort on Tetiaroa which is only accessible by a private plane from Tahiti. Historically there were certain built-in amenities such as gourmet cuisine, music recitals, and shoreline trails; however, the amenities of modern (post-1980) destination hotels dwarf the scale of these earlier models. Many of the Las Vegas and Caribbean resort hotels have complete shopping malls, conference centers and large entertainment halls on site; thus, the contemporary version of a destination often features large on-site capital investment in activities, although the access to a local natural feature is still retained by many newer destination hotels. A mega-resort is a type of destination which is of an exceptionally large size, sometimes featuring large-scale attractions (casino, golf course, theme park, multiple accommodations). The hotels along the Las Vegas Strip are most typically thought of as mega-resorts owing to their immense size and complexity. Kirk Kerkorian is credited for building the first mega-resort in 1969 earning him the nickname \\"father of the mega-resort\\". Two projects in Las Vegas in 1969 and 1973 by architect Martin Stern, Jr. and entrepreneur Kirk Kerkorian, the International Hotel and the MGM Grand, set the standard for such casino resorts. The Mirage gave its size and emphasis on non-gaming entertainment options like shopping and fine dining to draw in customers. Mega-resorts use the same fantastic or mythical theme (medieval life at Excalibur, tropical at The Mirage, famous cities, etc.) throughout their properties. Many mega-resorts have a large theme park as its centerpiece. Resorts such as the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts feature multiple hotels, multiple theme parks, a shopping complex, and other features. Other mega-resorts exist with no specific centerpiece, having many features that are considered prominent, such as Atlantis Paradise Island and its upcoming sister park in Dubai.

Then the high school was moved to the present day City Hall and after the destruction of the original school the lower grades were moved to a building where district offices are today nearby the City Hall. The high school was then expanded to include the present day community center which has one of the oldest sunken gyms still in use in the Midwest. After the school experienced overcrowding, the present day middle school was built as the then high school building. The middle school was then moved to the City hall. Years later, after overcrowding yet again, the high school was moved to its present location. In 2011, an extension was made adding a new gym, and tornado shelter. In 2016, the school added an entire wing of classrooms and a new library. The school was also moved up to the 5A classification for the 2016-17 school year.

The centre was the largest shopping centre in Australia when it opened in September 1987. The centre is a joint venture, owned by the Terrace Tower Group and Scentre Group. It is operated and managed on a long term agreement by the Scentre Group.Eastgardens Retail Terrance Tower Group The centre's major tenants include three supermarkets, a department store, three discount department stores, and a cinema. History Eastern entrance to Level 2, south-to-north bus stop Office tower David Jones' and Franklins's space was taken over by Myer and Aldi in 2008 Westfield Eastgardens was built on the site of the former Urban Transit Authority Pagewood bus depot. The depot closed in 1982 and was soon followed by the nearby Holden and WD & HO Wills factories. The closure of these two sites would result in job losses of around 1,000 people. In order to save jobs, the Government of New South Wales persuaded the Westfield Group to develop the site. The Government rezoned the site and added crown land in order to convince Westfield. In July 1982, three other commercial landlords whose own trade would be affected by the new shopping centre made a challenge to the Land & Environment Court. Following this the Government passed legislation that disallowed an appeal to be made to the Land & Environment Court. Significant public debate followed about the right of the New South Wales Government to overrule the legal process. Westfield Eastgardens opened on 19 October 1987 and was the largest shopping centre in Australia for a short period until Chadstone Shopping Centre in Melbourne was redeveloped. When the centre opened, it had David Jones, Super Kmart, Target, Franklins, a 6-screen Hoyts cinema as well as 180 other retailers. The Super Kmart hypermarket combined a discount department store (Kmart) and supermarket (Coles) under one roof until the store was split in 1989 into today's Coles and Kmart stores. The centre was redeveloped in 2002, with a new supermarket (Woolworths), discount department store (Big W) and brought the total amount of retailers to 290 with parking for 3,260 cars and the upgrade of Hoyts. When the redevelopment completed, Westfield Eastgardens was the first shopping centre in New South Wales to house three discount department stores, Kmart, Target and Big W. =Myer= After 20 years as an anchor tenant, David Jones closed its store on 23 September 2007 due to its proximity to the company's Westfield Bondi Junction and Elizabeth Street/Market Street stores. Myer took over David Jones' space after an extensive refurbishment, opening on the 8 March 2008. =Roof collapse= Eastgardens suffered significant damage when part of the car park collapsed at around 07:00 on 24 July 2012. Around 500 people were evacuated from the building when a second-level steel beam that supported the car park roof broke. The entire shopping centre was closed off after a survey found the collapse may have caused structural damage in other areas of the building. The dislodgement of the beam caused a partial roof collapse near the food court entrance on the second level, bringing down a plant room, air conditioning units, a cool room, toilet facilities, exhaust fans and an electrical switchboard. Police set up an exclusion zone around the centre and redirected road traffic. The building was closed pending further investigation. The building reopened the following day for retail trade, although some areas in the food court remained closed. Repairs were underway to restore the collapsed sections of the building. Facilities Westfield Eastgardens has 303 stores, 84,627 m¬≤ of floor space on two levels and 3,263 car spaces.Westfield Eastgardens Scentre Group Major retailers are located on either end of the centre.

The Discovery Channel ranked the Moto Guzzi Otto as one of the ten greatest motorbikes of all time. History By 1955, Moto Guzzi had already demonstrated its engineering prowess, creating motorcycles with a wide breadth of configurations: horizontal singles, parallel twins, V-twins in in-line and transverse layouts, 3-cylinders, and 4-cylinders in horizontal and in-line form. The Moto Guzzi V8 reinforced Moto Guzzi's commitment to pushing engineering boundaries. The engine was conceived by Giulio Carcano just after the 1954 Monza Grand Prix and designed by Dr. Carcano. The DOHC V8 at the Moto Guzzi Museum, Mandello del Lario To introduce the bike, and build publicity, Moto Guzzi's racing team manager released a letter to the international motorcycle press announcing Moto Guzzi's plans for the 1955 Grand Prix season‚Äîattaching a drawing of the new Otto and challenging them to guess the configuration of Moto Guzzi's then very secret racing bike. Very few guessed correctly, and the Otto made a stunning public debut a few months later. The engine and the bike were without precedent: a water-cooled, V-8 motorcycle ‚Äî with dual overhead cams and a separate carburetor for each of the eight cylinders. Weighing only (overall bike weight ), its miniaturized components tightly packed, the engine produced an unprecedented at 12000 rpm. The motorcycle proved capable of achieving ‚Äî20 years before the speed was reached again in Grand Prix motorcycle racing. Tyre, brake and suspension technology, however, lagged behind the powerful engine‚Äîmaking race course field testing difficult and actual racing dangerous. Fergus Anderson crashed the motorcycle on its maiden run in Modena. Only Fergus Anderson, Stanley Woods, Dickie Dale, Ken Kavanagh, Keith Campbell, Giuseppe Colnago, Bill Lomas and Alano Montanari were ever able to even ride the V8 motorcycle. Several of the riders experienced spectacular falls‚ÄîBill Lomas suffering a head injury at the 1956 Senigallia Grand Prix. Ken Kavanagh refused to ride the motorcycle after the 1956 race at Spa-Francorchamps. The Otto Cilindri also proved complex and expensive to build, in addition to the danger the bike posed to the racers themselves. By 1957 there were two bikes available and no one willing to race the bike without further development. Instead, the Otto remained undeveloped, as Moto Guzzi and other manufacturers withdrew from racing entirely in the 1957 season.DPGuzzi Guzzi V8 (Retrieved 28 October 2006) Speculation suggests that with further development, the V8 could have proved a formidable Grand Prix contender. Two authentic examples of the engine remain in the possession of Moto Guzzi, at the Moto Guzzi Museum in Mandello. For the 2013 Guzzi World Days (Giornate Mondiali Guzzi, GMG) gathering, the racing bike was rolled out and started for the crowd to hear the sound of the unmuffled V8's exhaust.

KPLS is owned by Radio 74 Internationale. As of May 2020, the station is in transition to airing a Christian format following a transfer of ownership. KPLS has studios and offices on South Union Boulevard in Lakewood and its transmitter is off Riverdale Road in Thornton, Colorado. KPLS is unusual in that its AM transmitter increases power at night, going from 10,000 watts to 25,000 watts. Both the day and night signals are quite directional, in a north-south pattern.http://radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/patg?id=KPLS-AM&h;=N FM translator KPLS's programming is simulcast on FM via the translator 92.9 K225CZ in Boulder. It was formerly carried by K229BS in Lakewood, Colorado; in 2019, the translator was sold to iHeartMedia, and began simulcasting KDFD on July 8, 2019. History On August 22, 1957, the station first signed on as KUDY.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-34 Owned by Bob Rubin from 1960 to 1965 and operated from above the theater at the Woodlawn Shopping Center, the original format was country music. On April 1, 1960, the station changed its call sign to KMOR, and then again on December 31, 1964 to KDKO. By 1967, the station was known as \\"Denver's Soul Radio\\" due to its rhythm & blues format. It broadcast from studios on Santa Fe Road, just south of County Line Road. During its tenure in this format, KDKO, thanks to its popular multiracial disc jockeys, became a ratings success story throughout the Denver market and within the growing African-American community. A bit of notoriety would take place in 1976 when the station served as the co-sponsor of a planned Marvin Gaye concert that was to take place at the Denver Coliseum. Hours before it was to go on, a KDKO staffer told the crowd that Gaye would arrive shortly, only to learn that Gaye was at his home in Los Angeles and was sleeping. This embarrassment led to an uproar at the coliseum. The staffer was taken off the air for his safety after he used foul language at the concertgoers. Several lawsuits were filed alleging fraud and deceiving ticket buyers. Later, KDKO dabbled with disco music (even calling itself \\"KDisKO\\") but as disco started to fade, the station returned to its R&B; roots. By 1980, it was sold to a group of investors, who would later sell it to KDKO veteran DJ Jim \\"Dr. Daddy-O\\" Walker in 1989. By then, it had become more focused on the African- American community as a full-serviced outlet with a mix of music and talk shows. Unfortunately, KDKO would be hit by a series of financial problems that lead to a one-week shutdown in 1992, and tensions among staff and management. Another factor was the emergence of Rhythmic Top 40 107.5 KQKS in the 1990s and its success in targeting Denver's growing multicultural audience that included younger and female listeners, which would spell the end of KDKO, leading to its sale in March 2002 to Phillip Anschutz Anschultz flipped the station to News/Talk as KNRC on June 26, 2002.\\"The KDKO Story\\"HighBeamHighBeam After Anschutz's purchase of 1150 AM, and the move of KNRC's format to that frequency, 1510 AM became KCUV in 2003, and adopted an eclectic music format, which would move to 102.3 KVOQ-FM in 2005, with 1510 flipping to oldies.HighBeam The KCKK call sign and country music format started out at 104.3 FM when Jefferson-Pilot (JP) acquired the signal. Eventually, JP did away with the staff at KYGO 1600 AM and started simulcasting KCKK programming at 1600 AM. When JP pulled the plug on KCKK at 104.3 FM in favor of a smooth jazz format in September 2000, KCKK moved exclusively to 1600 AM. KCKK 1600's last day came in mid-December 2006 when Lincoln Financial Media (which purchased Jefferson Pilot) announced that the signal at 1600 AM would be flipped to become Denver's new ESPN Radio affiliate, KEPN. Then, 1510 AM, which was airing an oldies format, took the KCKK call sign and became classic country as \\"Real Country\\". In late July 2007, 1510 AM flipped to a sports radio format, operated by Mile High Sports, a multimedia sports-marketing and publishing company based in Denver. The station featured network programming from Sporting News Radio (now SB Nation Radio) and several local hosts. The sports talk format was briefly suspended and KCKK returned to \\"Real Country\\". According to 100000watts.com, the change was due to the expiration of a local marketing agreement. The \\"Mile High Sports\\" format remained on former sister station KSXT (now KVAM) 1570 AM in Loveland, Colorado as of August 21, 2007, and returned again to 1510 AM ten days later, on August 31. On July 31, 2008, \\"Mile High Sports Radio\\" was announced as the new radio flagship for the Denver Nuggets, Colorado Avalanche, Colorado Mammoth, and Colorado Rapids. The station also broadcast the football and basketball programs at the Air Force Academy and syndicated National Football League games through the Sports USA Radio Network. In 2008, it broadcast most games of the Mountain West Conference men's basketball tournament. In June 2009, the station renewed its partnership with Kroenke Sports and Entertainment to remain the flagship station of the Nuggets, Avalanche, and Rapids. In December 2013, KCKK and its translator on 93.7 FM were sold by NRC Broadcasting to Hunt Broadcasting.http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/125092/kckk-a- denver-sold?ref=rss The purchase was consummated on March 3, 2014, at a price of $1.6 million. On March 7, 2014, KCKK changed its format to adult hits, branded as \\"93.7 The Rock\\".The Rock Lands in Denver The station was a low- budget operation, with the Hunt family providing the staff and most on-air talent. From 2016 to 2019, longtime Denver radio DJ Hal Moore hosted a show on KCKK, having hosted a show on the 1990s version of KCKK. Moore, not wishing to host an AM-only show, retired from radio at age 79 when Hunt Broadcasting sold the 93.7 FM translator to iHeart Media. On January 7, 2020, All Access reported KCKK would be sold to Radio 74 Internationale for $600,000.https://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/192616/denver-am- boulder-translator-combo-and-delmarva-fm?ref=rss A post on Radio 74's Facebook page Radio 74 Internationale Facebook entry announced the call letters would be changed to KPLS (for Positive LifeStyle), with a proposed launch date of March 20, 2020. On May 15, 2020, the purchase by Radio 74 was consummated and the station's call sign was changed to KPLS.

History The area in the eastern part of the state of Madhya Pradesh and the adjoining southern part of Sonebhadra district in the state of UP is collectively known as Singrauli Region. Singrauli is emerging as India's energy capital. The place earlier known as Shringavali, named after the sage Shringi, was once covered with dense and unnavigable forests and inhabited by wild animals. The place was considered so treacherous that it was used by the kings of Rewa State, who ruled the area till 1947, as an open air prison for detaining errant civilians and officers. In the 1800s, there were three separate rulers of Singrauli (previously known as Sidhi), ruling three parts of the territory: First were the Chandela rulers from Bardi (Khatai). Second was Rajasahab Madwas, He was a Baland Rajput, ruled in Majhauli block mostly. Third was Rajasahab of Singrauli. Raja Kant Deo Singh of Bardi Khatai continues to live in the ancestral Haveli located on the banks of the river Sone. He is an active member of the Bharatiya Janata Party.Chandel (Rajput clan)#Zamindari estates Just two generations ago, small holders were tending their parcels of land here, and the original inhabitants were gathering honey and herbs in the forest. In the late fifties, a large scale dam banked up the water of the River Rihand. The dam known as Govind Vallabh Pant Sagar was inaugurated by Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru in 1962. Later, rich coal deposits spread over an area of 2200 km¬≤ in the state of M.P. (eastern part of Sidhi District) and U.P. (southern part of Sonebhadra District) were discovered close to the artificial lake that could be used to generate electricity.http://www.singrauli.nic.in On 24 May 2008, Madhya Pradesh government declared Singrauli as its 50th district by separating from Sidhi with 3 tehsils, Singrauli, Chitrangi and Deosar. On 1 April 2012 two new tehsils were added, Mada and Sarai. This area has group of rock cut caves made in the 7-8th century AD in Mada, 32 km from Waidhan. The Mada caves are situated in Mada tehsil of Singrauli district. Famous caves include Vivah Mada, Ganesh Mada and Shankar Mada, Jaljalia and Ravan Mada. Besides rock cut caves, Singrauli also has painted rock shelters. Ranimachi, Dholagiri and Goura pahad lie in Chitrangi tehsil of Singrauli. These painted rock shelters belong to the Mesolithic age of microlithic implements culture. These paintings are representative of the early history of Indian art and are made of red ochre. Pollution threatens the shelters. Connectivity by road is very poor. This has been evident for several years but no action has been taken yet to improve road transport and quality of buses.http://www.mptourism.com/web/unknown/index.html Government *Commissioner of Rewa Division (Commissionaire of Rewa) supervision in District Administration of Singrauli *District Collector/District Magistrate office (Collectorate) situated is District Headquarters Town Waidhan Singrauli Forest : Conservator of Rewa circle, Supervision in District forest of Singrauli *District forest officer(DFO) office is situated in the District Headquarter town of Waidhan Singrauli District Police Force: *Inspector General of Police (IGP) Rewa Zone, Rewa supervision in District Force of Singrauli *Superintendent of Police (SP) office situated is District Headquarter Town Waidhan Demographics Out of the total Singrauli population for 2011 census, 19.25 percent lives in urban regions of district. In total 226,786 people lives in urban areas of which males are 120,313 and females are 106,473. Sex ratio in urban region of Singrauli district is 885 as per 2011 census data. Similarly child sex ratio in Singrauli district was 899 in 2011 census. Child population (0-6) in urban region was 30,804, of which males and females were 16,219 and 14,585. This child population figure of Singrauli district is 13.48% of the total urban population. Average literacy rate in Singrauli district as per census 2011 is 75.51% of which males and females are 83.97% and 65.93% literates respectively. In actual number 147,990 people are literate in urban region of which males and females are 87,408 and 60,582 respectively. Transport District Headquarter is approximately 30 km from Singrauli Morwa station, which has train connectivity. Singrauli is well connected to major Indian Cities such as Delhi, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Jabalpur, Bhopal, Lucknow, Varanasi, Patna,Jamshedpur, Jhansi, Ujjain, Prayagraj, Mirzapur, Katni and Bareilly. However, Road connectivity to Singrauli remains an issue. Though being on National Highway, commutation to Singrauli by road is difficult. Residents prefer to use trains when travelling to Singrauli. Singrauli Airport is under construction in Katauli village, near District Headquarter Waidhan. Industries All major companies operating in Singrauli belongs to Indian energy industry. The operations of companies include mining of coal for power generation. In recent past, several private companies have also joined the league of companies operating in Singrauli. It is expected by 2017 that Singrauli would feed around 35,000 MW of electrical power to the grid alone. Major companies operating or coming up at Singrauli are: 1\\\\. NTPC Limited (3 Power Plant with combined generation capacity of 9760 MW) 2\\\\. Coal India Limited ( Through its subsidiary Northern Coalfields Limited annual production 80 Million MT) 3\\\\.

Environmental pollution Singrauli region has been identified as a critically polluted area (CPA) by the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF). Incremental coal mining activities in the region and the rapid development of coal-based thermal power plants has resulted in acute air and water pollution, leading to serious health problems among the residents of the locality, which remain unaddressed., Down to earth. With the coming up of many more power companies the problem is expected to increase. Power plants in the area are poisoning the air and water in the district with mercury, a neurotoxin. Mercury is one of the natural, and perhaps the most harmful, components of coal. During combustion at temperature above 1,100 ¬∞C, it vapourises. Given the large quantity of coal burned in thermal plants, a considerable amount of mercury is released into the atmosphere. Some of it cools down and condenses while passing through the plant's boiler and air pollution control system and enters the environment through soil and water. It also enters the environment through run-off from coal mines. In humans, mercury can cause several chronic diseases and death. In 1998, the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR), a premier publicly funded scientific agency based in Lucknow, tested over 1,200 people from the Singrauli region for mercury poisoning. It found high levels of mercury in humans and in the environment., Down to earth. The Central Pollution Control Board analysed 11 coal samples from Singrauli and found mercury concentration in coal ranging between 0.09 parts per million (ppm) and 0.487 ppm. In 2011, Delhi-based non- profit Centre for Science and Environment had found 0.15 ppm mercury in coal at Anpara village in Sonbhadra. It is estimated that a 1,000 MW thermal power plant is emitting at least 500 kg of mercury every year in Singrauli. Singrauli is the largest emitter of SO2 gas in India, which is the largest emitter of SO2 gas worldwide according to a Greenpeace report.https://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/press/3489/india-release_latest- air-pollution-data-ranks-worlds-cities-worst-to-best/ References External links * Category:Cities and towns in Singrauli district Category:Municipal corporations in Madhya Pradesh Category:Cities in Madhya Pradesh ","title":"Singrauli"},{"id":"7658035","title":"Buhl Aircraft Company"},{"id":"7658091","text":"The DGCR8 microprocessor complex subunit (DiGeorge syndrome chromosomal [or critical] region 8) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the DGCR8 gene.

It is a required component of the RNA interference pathway.  Function  DGCR8 is localized to the cell nucleus and is required for microRNA (miRNA) processing. It binds to Drosha, an RNase III enzyme, to form the Microprocessor complex that cleaves a primary transcript known as pri-miRNA to a characteristic stem-loop structure known as a pre-miRNA, which is then further processed to miRNA fragments by the enzyme Dicer. DGCR8 contains an RNA-binding domain and is thought to bind pri-miRNA to stabilize it for processing by Drosha. DGCR8 is also required for some types of DNA repair. Removal of UV-induced DNA photoproducts, during transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), depends on JNK phosphorylation of DGCR8 on serine 153.

Manasses was the son of Hugh II of Gournay-en-Bray and Adelaide of Dammartin. His brother was Hugh III of Gournay-en-Bray, and his cousins included Peter, Count of Dammartin and Hugh-Rainard, the bishop of Langres. He was a simple cleric before he succeeded Gervase of Chateau-du-Loir as archbishop. He was known to be enterprising and liberal and was addressed in a letter by Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, as \\"one of the columns of the church\\". He presided over one of the most intellectually and artistically vibrant episcopal courts of northern Europe. Pope Gregory VII entrusted Manasses with several delicate missions, but the bishop's character was not held in esteem by his former colleagues, the lower clergy. Among them, he was reputed to be tyrannical, violent, corrupt, impatient, insolent, and disregarding of ecclesiastical regulations. His language gave some cause to doubt his piety. According to Guibert of Nogent, writing in his memoirs thirty-five years later in 1115, Manasses was reported to have said that \\"the archbishop of Reims would be a fine thing, if one were not obligated to sing the Mass!\\" A conflict with the monks of Saint-Remi over the installation of a new abbot prompted a legation of monks to complain to the pope. Manasses responded to the abbey's resistance by excommunicating the monks and despoiling their goods. Gregory VII intervened in 1077 to order Geoffrey, Bishop of Paris, to receive and absolve the monks fleeing into his territory. In Autun on 10 September 1077, papal legate Hugh of Die condemned Manasses as a heresiarch, apparently for consenting to the elevation of the bishop of Senlis, suffragan of Reims, to his office by King Philip I. Manasses reacted by defending his conduct in a letter to Gregory and accusing the legates of acting in bad faith. The archbishop's appeal succeeded, and Gregory restored him to his office in early 1078. Manasses then traveled to Rome in spring 1078 to profess his faith. There he swore his innocence on the relics of St Peter. This was accepted, and Manasses returned to Reims. He continued to move against his political opponents, however, notably the schoolmaster Bruno of Cologne and the provost of the cathedral chapter, also named Manasses (the future Manasses II, Archbishop of Reims). When they complained again to Hugh of Die in 1079, the legate ordered the archbishop to appear before an ecclesiastical synod at Lyon to resolve the dispute once and for all. Manasses refused to make the journey to Lyon, and was suspended and ordered to retreat to the abbey of Cluny. The pope offered him a delay in his sentence if he would make reparations. He never did and was deposed by Pope Gregory VII on 27 December 1080. While Manasses continued to act as archbishop until at least September 1081, he thereafter disappears from the historical record. Renaud du Bellay, the treasurer of Tours cathedral, succeeded Manasses in 1083, after a vacancy of several years. Notes References *Nouvelle Biographie G√©n√©rale. Vol 33 Mal-Mar. Paris, 1859.

In A Personal Note to the Reader, Boorstin writes, Caught between two eternities- the vanished past and the unknown future - we never cease to seek our bearings and our sense of direction. We inherit our legacy of the sciences and the arts - works of the great Discoverers and Creators...recounted in my earlier volumes. We glory in their discoveries and creations. But we are all Seekers. We all want to know why. Man is the asking animal... Unlike The Discoverers and The Creators this book does not chronicle discoveries, inventions and creations. Instead, various religious and philosophical Western thinkers are portrayed as are their attempts to seek in their own way. The work contains 41 separate vignettes, each dedicated to a seeker. They are grouped in eight parts that are divided into three books representing what Boorstin calls the three grand epochs of seeking. = Book One: An Ancient Heritage = Part I. The Way of Prophets: A Higher Authority Part II. The Way of Philosophers: A Wondrous Instrument Within Part III: The Christian Way: Experiments in Community = Book Two: Communal Search = Part IV. Ways of Discovery: In Search of Experience Part V. The Liberal Way = Book Three: Paths To The Future = Part VI. The Momentum of History: Ways of Social Science Part VII. The Sanctuaries of Doubt Part VIII. A World In Process: The Meaning In The Seeking  Praise and Criticism  The Seekers was both praised and criticized for its adulatory treatment of Western culture. Michael Lind, in a New York Times Book Review (Western Civ Fights Back), noted that he was \\"a secular, skeptical moderate, Northeastern liberal\\" yet offered a vigorous defense of Western civilization.Western Civ Fights Back He remarked that Boorstin might be signaling a new trend, since other liberals were also speaking out, particularly against what they considered excesses of ideology: multiculturalism, radical academia, political correctness and affirmative action to name a few. Roger Kimball of the Wall Street Journal praised his \\"formidable narrative gift and a great deal of common sense.\\" Publishers Weekly wrote a laudatory review stating \\"...what Boorstin does so well is bring together many ideas that fertilize and cross-fertilize the reader's imagination and curiosity.\\" Amazon.com, discussing Western intellectual development, asked, \\"What other author could put it so succinctly?\\" Harry Frumerman of The Library Journal described the book then added \\"The writing has a sweeping, didactic tone. A suitable but not mandatory choice for academic and larger public libraries.\\" Amazon Editorial Reviews  Book One: An Ancient Heritage  Boorstin notes that in the beginning we sought answers from special individuals - religious prophets. He begins with Moses, the first Prophet whose greatest contribution was not the Ten Commandments but the idea of monotheism and Israel's special relationship. Besides offering moral advice, the prophet addressed universal questions - \\"What is the purpose of life?\\" \\"What is the nature of God?\\" \\"Why does evil happen to good people?\\" More Old Testament prophets followed and the concept of Yahweh became more abstract. No longer did He reside in a physical place but was everywhere. Therefore, he was within each of us. Job is the prophetic answer to the question of evil in our world. Ancient Greece gave us the philosopher: Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. One factor in the rise of philosophy was the transition from oral to written knowledge. Complex thoughts could be retained, referenced and augmented. Greek society was the first to celebrate the thinker, the rationalist and this questioning attitude became a hallmark of Western Civilization. Boorstin especially praises Aristotle for his searching and curious mind, his introduction of classification and his nascent hints at modern science. But more than that he state, I admire his appeal to common sense and experience. His academy was a place where people collected information about their world and...came to conclusions... Gergen, David Online Newshour:The Seekers Christianity merged the Prophet and Philosopher creating theology and a new society. Monasteries arose in the West and Boorstin considers them the most influential institutions of the time, both preserving and spreading knowledge. From them came the university, yet another peculiarly Western institution. Finally, the Protestant Reformation gave individuals and not only institutions power, transforming congregations into participants. Humanism and democracy were its outgrowths.  Book Two: Communal Search  Paradoxically, as seeking became individualized, attention turned to the specific community in which they dwelled for answers. In the forward he quotes Thomas Carlyle (approvingly): \\"the three great elements of modern civilization [are] gunpowder, printing and the Protestant religion.\\" The Greek Homeric epics introduce mortals to the story and even the Gods have human motivations and reactions. Herodotus wrote the first history but elements of the epic remained. Thucydides and his history of the Peloponnesian War introduced a new field, political science. Others sought answers in the communal past - Virgil, Thomas More, Francis Bacon, Descartes. In The Liberal Way Boorstin arrives at the modern world of classical liberalism - Machiavelli (the Italian way), John Locke (the English way of limited government), Voltaire and Rousseau (the French way of liberation), Thomas Jefferson (the American experiment), Hegel (the ideal German) - each sought meaning within the framework of their own society. All sought to define the individual within the framework of society and increasingly, the State.  Book Three: Paths to the Future  Modern seekers abandoned traditional sources of meaning such as nations or religion and found or invented new sources. In France the Marquis de Concorcet rejected religion and power in individuals. Instead, mass movements were expounded as a new wave. The result was the French Revolution yet he died in jail, victim of his own teachings. Auguste Comte developed Positivism, a system in which only sensory experiences were the true reality. Related to this was historical determinism in which progress occurs by outside forces unrelated to human actions. From these two arose Ideology, a belief that the ideas expressed were true because they could be \\"proven\\". Individuals lost not only influence but also meaning. Boorstin strongly opposed ideology... the people who think they have found the final answer...are the menace to our humanity really, because I think there is no final answer. Gergen, David Online Newshour: The Seekers He first warned of the dangers of ideology in 1953 in The Genius of American Politics. In an interview with PBS he says Jefferson's greatness stems from his non-ideological nature and refusal to develop a political theory. PBS Interview Ideology eventually led to the modern totalitarian state. Spengler and Toynbee sought answers in culture which displaced the nation state. Cultures could be studied and analyzed scientifically so were better models for comparison. Others looked for new meaning in violent revolution, particularly the Soviet model. Steinbeck, Hemingway, John Reed, Lincoln Steffens and others praised the new State. Kierkegaard found meaning not in history but in religious Existentialism wherein doubt was as necessary as faith. Seekers of truth in literature wrote in new ways and a stream of consciousness style emerged. Others found solace in diversity - Edward Wilson in biodiversity, Oliver Wendell Holmes in diversity of opinion. Seekers grew disenchanted with scientific history and materialism. They created process philosophy which found meaning in the act of seeking, not in the final goal. Lord Acton, an English politician, tried to reconcile authoritarian Catholicism with liberty which he considered a process rather than a destination. Malraux looked outside Western absolutes for answers in art, literature and revolution. Henri Bergson sought to explain life processes and particularly evolution (a grand process) in philosophical and physiological terms, declaring true meaning is found within the process. Boorstin concludes with Einstein who searched for ultimate truth in the cosmological unity of universal laws. Quotes \`...history was a literary art, because in history the subject and its audience were one. The effective historian is always telling us about ourselves... The Seekers This problem...haunted Western thought‚ÄîWhy would a good God allow evil in the world He had created? -- was one that Judeo- Christian man had made for himself. It was plainly a by-product of ethical monotheism...The Seekers Dogmas of social science would...eventually be embodied in institutions whose mission it was to enforce a frozen ideology The Seekers ...the Seekers who left the most durable imprint on Western history are those who embodied the mystery of their achievement in their lives - and their deaths The Seekers ...there has been no greater obstacle to his [mankind's] learning than the stock of accumulated knowledge. The Seekers ...ideology itself is a contradiction and denial of man's endless powers of novelty and change which are suggested by the very idea of progress.

It is in the tradition of earlier star catalogues, the so-called Three Stars Each lists, but represents an expanded version based on more accurate observation, likely compiled around 1000 BCE.John H. Rogers, \\"Origins of the ancient constellations: I. The Mesopotamian traditions\\", Journal of the British Astronomical Association 108 (1998) 9‚Äì28 The text lists the names of 66 stars and constellations and further gives a number of indications, such as rising, setting and culmination dates, that help to map out the basic structure of the Babylonian star map. The text is preserved in a 7th-century BCE copy on a pair of tablets, named for their incipit, corresponding to the first constellation of the year, \\"The Plough\\", identified with Triangulum plus Gamma Andromedae. Date The earliest copy of the text so far discovered was made in 686 BCE; however the majority of scholars now believe that the text was originally compiled around 1000 BCE.Mul.Apin edited by Hunger & Pingree, page 9. Earlier scholars such as Papke and Van der Waerden posited a date around 2300 BCE, which has been criticised by Hunger & Pingree who opt for a date around 1000 BCE. The latest copies of Mul-Apin are currently dated to around 300 BCE. Astrophysicist Bradley Schaefer claims that the observations reported in these tablets were made in the region of Assur at around the year 1370 BCE. Parts The text runs to two tablets and possibly a third auxiliary tablet, and is organised as follows: =Tablet 1= The first tablet is the most important resource for any potential reconstruction of the Babylonian star map as its various sections locate the constellations in relation to each other and to the calendar. Tablet 1 has six main sections: * All the major stars and constellations are listed and organised into three broad divisions according to celestial latitude allocating each star to three paths: ** the northern path of Enlil containing 33 stars or constellations ** the presumably equatorial path of Anu containing 23 stars or constellations, and ** the southern path of Ea containing 15 stars or constellations, :Most of these stars and constellations are further attributed to a variety of Near Eastern deities.Mul-Apin by Gavin White * The heliacal rising dates of 34 stars and constellations are given according to the 360-day ‚Äòideal‚Äô calendar year. * Lists of stars and constellations that rise and set at the same time. * The number of days between the risings of various stars and constellations. * The stars and constellations that rise and culminate at the same time. * The stars on the path of the moon, being the major constellations close to the ecliptic, which includes all the Babylonian forerunners to the zodiac constellations. Even though the Babylonians used a luni-solar calendar, which added an occasional thirteenth month to the calendar, MUL.APIN, like most texts of Babylonian astrology, uses an ‚Äòideal‚Äô year composed of 12 ‚Äòideal‚Äô months each of which was composed of an ‚Äòideal‚Äô 30 days. In this scheme the equinoxes were set on the 15th day of the first and seventh month, and the solstices on the 15th day of the fourth and tenth month. =Tablet 2= The second tablet is of greater interest to historians of science as it furnishes us with many of the methods and procedures used by Babylonian astrologers to predict the movements of the sun, moon and planets as well as the various methods used to regulate the calendar. The contents of tablet 2 can be summarised under ten headings as follows: * The names of the sun and the planets and the assertion that they all travel the same path as the moon. * Which stars are rising and which contain the full moon on the solstices and equinoxes in order to judge the disparity of the lunar and solar cycles. * Recommendations for observing the appearances of certain stars and the direction of the wind at the time of their first appearance. * Very approximate values for the number of days that each planet is visible and invisible during the course of its observational cycle. * The four stars associated with the four directional winds. * The dates when the sun is present in each of the three stellar paths. * Two types of intercalation scheme. One uses the rising dates of certain stars while the other uses position of the moon in relation to the stars and constellations. * The relative duration of day and night at the solstices and equinoxes, and the lengths of shadow cast by a gnomon at various times of the day at the solstices and equinoxes. * A basic mathematical scheme giving the rising and setting times of the moon in each month. * A selection of astrological omens. There is some evidence that a third, and so far unrecovered, tablet was sometimes appended to the series. To judge from its opening line it started with a section of scholarly explanations of celestial omens.Mul.Apin edited by Hunger & Pingree pages 8-9.

The role was first portrayed by Alex Donnelley, who debuted in 1982. Diane was initially a two-day bit role, but was developed into a long-term character. Donnelley left the role two years later; returning briefly in 1986 before returning to the role fully in 1996. In 2001, Donnelley left again in what was supposed to be a storyline-dictated departure, however, the role was later recast with Susan Walters. After three years in the role, Walters chose to drop to recurring status in 2004, but wasn't seen again until a brief guest appearance in February 2010. Seven months later, the role was recast a second time with Maura West, who took over in October. Diane has had relationships with business tycoons Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) and Victor Newman (Eric Braeden). Diane has a son with Jack, Kyle Abbott (Lachlan Buchanan, Michael Mealor), who was initially supposed to be Victor's son before his sperm sample was switched. Donnelley described Diane as \\"taking herself much too seriously\\", while Walters criticized the character for existing solely to advance another character's storyline. Former head writer Maria Arena Bell was heavily criticized for the writing for West; Zap2it said Bell missed an opportunity to focus on Diane's rivalry with Jack. In 2011, within eight months of joining the cast, West was let go and the character was killed off two months later in a whodunit murder storyline. The storyline also was harshly criticized for progressing too slowly, as it was a six-month period before the revelation that Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott) killed Diane in self-defense. Casting and creation A guest appearance Donnelley made on Simon & Simon attracted the attention of the series' casting department, and she was eventually cast in the intended short-term role of Diane. The role was later expanded and Donnelley signed a three-year contract. In 1984, Donnelley left the role to pursue a career in episodic television and in feature films, but returned for a brief guest appearance in 1986. In 1996, Donnelley returned to the role fully, remaining for an additional five years until it was announced that she would exit in a storyline dictated departure during the February sweeps period of 2001. After her onscreen departure, Donnelley was officially let go from the soap but was said to possibly return at a later date. Instead, the role was recast with Walters due to the writers wanting to take the character in a different direction. Donnelley commented that it was disappointing not to be returning to the role. In 2004, Walters opted not to renew her contract and was bumped to recurring status. She explained that she wasn't ruling out a possible return in the future. However, she wanted the character to have a storyline of her own rather than existing for the sole purpose of advancing another character's story. After nearly six years off-screen, Walters reprised the role in a two-episode guest appearance in February 2010. In August, seven months later, it was announced that West would take over the role. West said the character had potential and was interesting. In May 2011, eight months after joining the cast, West was let go from the role and exited onscreen in August as part of a whodunit murder storyline. Storylines =1982‚Äì1984, 1986= Calculating that dating Jack Abbott would help her become a top model at Jabot, Diane Jenkins decided to start sleeping with him and fell in love with him, but Jack left her when he decided to marry Patty Williams as a way to show his father that he is a grown man. Despite that, Jack was late to his own wedding because he was sleeping with Diane. Diane and Jack continued their affair, and she was able to blackmail her way into becoming Jabot's top model. Jack, however, was more interested in having Julia Newman be Jabot's top model. When Diane learned this, she heightened her affair with Jack. Later, Patty miscarried upon seeing Jack and Diane making love in the Jabot headquarters lobby. Nonetheless, Patty wanted to continue her marriage to Jack just out of spite to Diane. After Patty's miscarriage, she wanted to have another baby and to move out of the Abbott Mansion and into their own house. Soon after, Jack spoke with former romance and current stepmother, Jill Abbott, about the real reason why he married Patty. Patty eventually found out and shot Jack. Jack lived, and Patty was sent to a mental facility. They later divorced. Diane came to the conclusion that Jack isn't worth her time and focused on a new love, a detective named Andy Richards. Andy worked alongside Paul Williams, Patty's brother. The couple married and led an uneventful life, which led Diane to begin another affair with Jack. Later, Diane heard that Jack was going to give her a gift, which she had hoped was an engagement ring. Clearly, Jack had changed, so she asked Andy for a divorce and was looking forward to being with Jack, only to learn, that the gift was a bracelet, which was his way of saying he would be unable to commit to her. Disappointed, Diane left to Europe, but even there she couldn't rest. She figured out that she loved Andy, so she returned to town only to find Andy happy with Farren Connor. She left town again. =1996‚Äì2004= Ten years later and now working as an architect, Diane returned to Genoa City a free woman. She began working for Jack again, leaving their families to worry that they might hook up again. Diane and Jack admitted their feelings for each other and got engaged. Jack's nemesis Victor Newman hatched a plan to steal Diane away from Jack as a way of getting revenge, but he fell for Diane. The couple got married and started living a good life until Diane decided to have a baby. She was bitterly disappointed to learn that Victor had a vasectomy suggested by his former wife, Nikki Newman. Nikki was shot by her husband's ex-wife, Veronica Landers, and was on her deathbed, so Victor divorced Diane in order to marry Nikki before she died. A twist of fate kept Nikki alive, while Diane was hoping that Victor would be able to remarry her. Victor and Nikki realized they still loved each other and decided to get married ‚Äî because their quick marriage in the hospital wasn't legal. Diane didn't take this easily and decided to get revenge. At their divorce settlement in February 1999, Diane got a permanent board seat at Newman Enterprises. Diane was taken by surprise when she learned Victor had his sperm frozen at Robertson Labs, so she arranged to get it in order to be artificially inseminated and carry Victor's child. Several people found out about it, and the sperm was stolen and transferred various times. When Diane finally got her hands on it again, she rushed to the doctor to be inseminated. Diane gave birth to a boy and named him Christian Victor Newman. She told Victor that the baby was his child. A DNA test proved that the baby wasn't Victor's, and Diane left town not long after. What Diane didn't know was that Nikki asked to switch Victor's sample with another, and she was shocked to learn that it was Jack‚Äôs. Keen on finding out if Diane was a good mother, Nikki tracked her down in Milan and went to see her. She decided to keep quiet about the baby's paternity. Diane returned to town not long after that trying to find out why Nikki went to see her. She renamed the baby Kyle and eventually found out that Jack was the father. Jack, who at the time was married to Phyllis Abbott, sued for sole custody of the child but didn't get it after Phyllis ruined her testimony on the stand. Diane got custody of the baby but refused to stop there ‚Äî she wanted Jack back. She moved into the Abbott pool house and started playing games with Phyllis. Jack made an agreement to let Diane stay at the pool house but forbade her to go near the main house. One night, the pool house was burned down with Diane barely surviving. Phyllis was the main suspect for arson, but she was able to eventually prove that Diane set it up to look like Phyllis wanted her dead. Jack and Phyllis were able to get custody of Kyle. Diane's life got a bit better when Andy returned to Genoa City, and they started dating again, but he left not long after he arrived. Diane broke any attachment to Jabot, and Jack decided to give her Kyle back. She started working on a project for Newman with Drucilla Winters, but the project didn't last long. Diane then left to live in Chicago with her son. =2010‚Äì2011= In late February 2010, Diane returned to town to visit Jack with their son Kyle Jenkins Abbott as a surprise arranged by Jack's new wife Dr. Emily Peterson (Stacy Haiduk) as a wedding gift. In the process of her return, Diane had a run-in with her longtime nemesis Phyllis and unknown to Diane, as well as everyone, she also came face to face with Jack's first wife Patty Williams (Haiduk), who was posing as Emily, after causing her to be hospitalized and unconscious. Diane returned to Genoa City in October 2010, admitted to Jack that she returned to town because of their son, Kyle (Garrett Ryan). Diane admitted that she hoped that Jack and Kyle could connect as father and son, revealing her intentions of moving back to town, leaving Toronto permanently. After sleeping with Tucker McCall (Stephen Nichols), McCall refuses to hire Diane due to an article published by Restless Style Magazine, owned by her rival Phyllis. Diane soon begins a romantic relationship with Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow), which is cut short due to Victor's jealousy. After being hired by Victor to do some work on The Newman Ranch, the pair in a mutually beneficial relationship. The marriage fails to last when Victor rediscovers his love for Nikki, ending the marriage in an annulment. Consumed with robbing Victor of all he's worth, Diane schemes up a plan with Victor's son Adam Newman (Michael Muhney) to fake a pregnancy. However, when Victor discovers the scheme is a sham, he throws Diane out of the ambulance. Diane turns her attentions back to Jack for help, but after a night of passion, Jack refuses to let Diane back into his life in a romantic capacity. Determined to escape town, Diane purchases Kyle a fake passport to send him to Switzerland under the alias Timothy Bilton and with the help of Adam would escape town and join him there. On the night she was expected to leave, Diane tried extorting Victor into giving her money for a tape that showed Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan) responsible for an accident which caused Tucker to land in the hospital for several months in a coma. When her attempt to extort Victor failed, she took her efforts to Ashley. Diane then confessed to having slept with Tucker, leading Ashley to slap her straight across the face. Diane then sends a mass text message to everyone who had wronged her: Abby, Ashley, Jack, Nicholas, Phyllis, Tucker and Victor. The morning after, Diane's dead body is discovered in the lake in the park by Patrick Murphy (Michael Fairman). Diane's death leads to a prolonged investigation. In January 2012, more evidence is brought to the attention of Ronan Malloy (Jeff Branson), indicating Nikki Newman killed Diane Jenkins in self-defense. However, further video evidence shows that it was Nikki's then-husband Deacon Sharpe (Sean Kanan) who delivered the fatal blow from a rock to Diane's head, finally resolving the death investigation of Diane Jenkins.

It is a comedy about hunting and hunting traditions and is set (and filmed) in the Escanaba, Michigan area. The film uses upper peninsula language and slang. The movie is the film adaptation of the play of the same name, which premiered at Jeff Daniels' Purple Rose Theatre in Chelsea, Michigan. Plot Reuben Soady (Daniels) goes to the hunting camp cottage, otherwise known as deer camp, with his father Albert (played by Harve Presnell), brother Remnar (Joey Albright) and Jimmy \\"The Jimmer\\" Negamanee from Menominee (Wayne David Parker). If Reuben, now 43, doesn't manage to shoot a buck by the end of the season, he will become the oldest Soady in recorded history not to have achieved this task, a taboo that leads people in the community to believe he is jinxed. Reuben breaks with tradition, taking advice from his Native American wife Wolf Moon Dance (Kimberly Norris), who offers him spiritual remedies involving a drink made with moose testicles and scenting himself with porcupine urine to protect him from evil spirits and attract his prey to him. After various unexplainable phenomena, they meet a DNR officer, Tom T. Treado (Randall Godwin), who claims to have literally seen God on the ridge. At various times, Reuben, Jimmer, and ranger Tom all get possessed by spirits. Eventually, Reuben runs out into the cold wearing only his long underwear and a hat, and finds himself face-to-face with the ghost of his dead great-grandfather Alphonse Reid, and his great grandmother Willa Jocelyn who guides him to shooting a buck sent for him by the spirits. Reuben returns triumphantly.

Kidd argued that the \\"evolution of society and of modern civilization\\" is caused not by reason or science, but by the force of \\"religious beliefs.\\"Sir Norman Lockyer, ed, Nature, vol 98, no. 2449 5 Oct 1916, 95 (Macmillan Journals Limited, 1917) The book had worldwide circulation and impacted the Social Gospel movement. Kidd is reckoned as a founder of sociology as a discipline. Influenced by Darwinism and evolution, Kidd sought and found analogies between the evolution of human society and of the biological organism.\\"sociology.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online Academic Edition. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 2015. Web. 27 February 2015. Kidd's prolific writings had a major impact at the time. However, the world was so different after the First World War that Kidd's work became relegated to historical interest.D. P. Crook, \\"Kidd, Benjamin (1858‚Äì1916),\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Early life Benjamin Kidd was born in County Clare, Ireland, on 9 September 1858, the first of eleven children of Benjamin Kidd (1831‚Äì1914), a constable in the Royal Irish Constabulary, and his wife, Mary Rebecca (1833‚Äì1916). The son did not have \\"early advantages of education or social position.\\" However, his \\"self-belief and drive\\" were so strong that Kidd's life became a \\"rags to riches\\" story.Henry Sturt, \\"Kidd, Benjamin (1858‚Äì1916), sociologist,\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 1927) and D. P. Crook, \\"Kidd, Benjamin (1858‚Äì1916),\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 18 Feb 2015. First job Kidd's first job began in 1878 when he began work as a clerk to the Board of Inland Revenue at Somerset House in London. To get this job, Kidd (at age 18) passed the lower division civil service examination. In London, Kidd's life was \\"frugal and solitary,\\" but his ambition drove him to attend evening classes and to read incessantly.D. P. Crook, \\"Kidd, Benjamin (1858‚Äì1916),\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, (Oxford University Press, 2004). Kidd's frugality was necessitated by the fact that the salary of a lower division clerk placed him in the lower end of the salary band of the lower middle class, ¬£150 at most. This was barely enough to live on, with no chance of raises for 13 years.Jill Pellew, The Home Office, 1848-1914, from Clerks to Bureaucrats (Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1982), 114. In 1887, Kidd married Maud Emma Isabel Perry of Weston-Super-Mare. They had three sons: Franklin and twins John and Rolf.D. P. Crook, \\"Kidd, Benjamin (1858‚Äì1916),\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004) Kidd could not be content to remain an unknown clerk. He believed that he had a \\"mission in life\\" to be a self-made \\"social prophet\\" as were Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer.David Paul Crook, Benjamin Kidd: Portrait of a Social Darwinist (Cambridge University, 1984), 53, 69. He spent his seventeen years as a clerk preparing for his mission. His preparation began as reading books written by others.Henry Sturt, \\"Kidd, Benjamin (1858‚Äì1916), sociologist,\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 1927) During the last ten years, Kidd focussed on writing Social Evolution, the book that propelled him into international fame.Who‚Äôs Who, Vol 55 (A & C Black, 1903), s.v. \\"Benjamin Kidd,\\" 763. Social Evolution Royalties from the publication of his Social Evolution in 1894 allowed Kidd to leave his job. In short order, he went from being an obscure clerk to the internationally famous social prophet toward which he had long worked.Daniel Coit Gilman, Harry Thurston Peck, Frank Moore Colby, eds. The New International Encyclopaedia, Vol 13 (Dodd, Mead, 1906) s. v. \\"Benjamin Kidd,\\" 215. Kidd wrote Social Evolution with \\"self-confidence and conviction\\" that its content was of vast importance. The major theme of the book (and later works), is that religion is \\"the chief agency in promoting philanthropy and the political enfranchisement.\\" In contrast, Kidd views reason as \\"selfish and short-sighted.\\" The book was timely because \\"evolution and naturalism\\" were threatening some religious beliefs. Kidd offered a faith that took into account and made use of these new discoveries. Kidd is characterized as a \\"social darwinist\\".David Paul Crook, Benjamin Kidd: Portrait of a Social Darwinist (Cambridge University, 1984), 339. The term \\"social evolution\\" was first used in 1853. It saw parallels between the new theories of biological evolution and the evolution of societies.\\"social, adj. and n. OED Online. Oxford University Press, December 2014. Web. 20 February 2015. Kidd wrote about these parallels in the \\"Application of the Doctrine of Evolution to Sociological Theory\\" as the Preface to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 1902, Vol 5. Social Evolution passed through several editions and was translated into German (1895), Swedish (1895), French (1896), Russian (1897), Italian (1898), Chinese (1899), Czech (1900), Danish (1900), and Arabic (1913).Daniel Coit Gilman, Harry Thurston Peck, Frank Moore Colby, eds.

One reason for the book's success was its \\"violent attack on socialism\\" that appealed to the more conservative population. Another reason was that it appealed to religionists. Kidd ascribed Western civilization's \\"modern progress toward the equalization of the conditions of life\\" to the \\"immense fund of altruism\\" that had been generated by the Christian religion.Benjamin Kidd, Social Evolution (Macmillan, 1898, new ed rev.), 182, 194.

A third reason for the book's success was that Kidd predicted a future in workers would have equal rights and opportunities.David Paul Crook, Benjamin Kidd: Portrait of a Social Darwinist (Cambridge University, 1984), 99. This optimism appealed to the workers who in the Gilded Age were often \\"consigned to lives of bitter toil with little hope for advancement.\\"\\"Gilded Age.\\" International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. 2008. Retrieved 27 February 2015 from Encyclopedia.com: http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045300926.html. =Pr√©cis of Social Evolution= \\"The very foundations of human thought have been rebuilt\\" by the emergence of Darwinian science (viii). To those \\"who have caught the spirit of Darwinian science\\" of evolution, a basic question is whether \\"religious systems have a function to perform in the evolution of society\\"Benjamin Kidd, Social Evolution (Groset & Dunlap, 1898, new ed rev with additions.) https://books.google.com/books?id=RQnTAAAAMAAJ&printsec;=frontcover&dq;=%22Benjamin+Kidd%22++%22Social+Evolution%22&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=mSjuVI_gIJe6ogS7i4LADg&ved;=0CCIQuwUwAA#v=onepage&q;=%22Benjamin%20Kidd%22%20%20%22Social%20Evolution%22&f;=false. An evolution of society has occurred unlike anything in \\"previous history\\", and it has been \\"religion\\" that effected it. People have always turned toward the \\"Super-natural\\" rather than the natural, toward the \\"ultra-rational\\" rather than the rational for \\"sanctions\\" for their conduct. The development of Western civilization has been undergirded by the \\"Christian religion\\" that brought something new to the world: \\"an enthusiastic devotion to its corporate welfare\\". Due to the Christian religion's \\"altruism,\\" Western civilization has witnessed a \\"great extension of political power\\" to the masses. The altruism of Christianity caused the first stage of Western civilization's social evolution. The second stage was the Reformation that liberated the \\"altruistic feeling\\" that had been instilled by Christianity. Effects of the \\"great development of humanitarian feelings\\" that marks Western civilization include charitable giving, suppression of the slave trade, concern to remedy injustices, sensitivity for the \\"misery or suffering\\" of humans and animals, and the evolution toward a society with \\"no privileged class\\" and \\"equality of opportunity\\". In summary, the force of Western civilization's evolution \\"toward the equalization of the conditions of life\\" lies in the \\"great fund of altruistic feeling generated by the ethical system on which our civilization is based\\" that was brought about by the Christian religion.\\" Fame Because Kidd‚Äôs royalties from Social Evolution had enabled him to quit his clerk‚Äôs job and be a full-time \\"social prophet,\\" he was free to travel as a celebrity. Between 1894 and 1902, Kidd traveled extensively in the United States and Canada (1898), and in South Africa (1902). He also became acquainted with many important people in London in the circles of politics, science, and literature.Henry Sturt, \\"Kidd, Benjamin (1858‚Äì1916), sociologist,\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 1927). While in the United States, in an interview with The Outlook (New York), Kidd expressed optimism about the future for the US and England. Both countries, he said, \\"were heading into a future in which the masses must inevitably enjoy equal political rights and equal social opportunities.\\" Kidd also wrote for The Times a series of articles later published as The Control of the Tropics.Henry Sturt, \\"Kidd, Benjamin (1858‚Äì1916), sociologist,\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 1927). The Control of the Tropics (Macmillan, 1898) is online at https://archive.org/details/controloftropics00kidduoft. Kidd came into the Social Gospel movement when, during his to America, he met the leading clergymen of the movement including Washington Gladden, Lyman Abbott. William D. P. Bliss, and Josiah Strong.David Paul Crook, Benjamin Kidd: Portrait of a Social Darwinist (Cambridge University, 1984), 134. Kidd was now an international celebrity. As such, he faced numerous requests for interviews, articles, and lectures. His fame so \\"frightened\\" him that he mostly declined requests and thus missed out on lucrative fees. He remained a \\"withdrawn personality\\" who was \\"ill at ease\\" in public.David Paul Crook, Benjamin Kidd: Portrait of a Social Darwinist (Cambridge University, 1984), 83-84. Responses to Social Evolution Social Evolution was marked by its ambiguity. It oscillated between \\"utopian socialism\\" and \\"doomsday economism\\" that would lead to \\"global conflict between the great powers.\\" While expressing appreciation for \\"socialist theory,\\" Kidd stated that socialism was not viable in practice. The ambiguity in Kidd's writing was so pronounced that he was called a \\"Christian socialist\\" by some, but pro-business by others. Thus, it was that Social Evolution was both \\"fiercely attacked\\" and \\"fiercely supported.\\"David Paul Crook, Benjamin Kidd: Portrait of a Social Darwinist (Cambridge University, 1984), 6, 76-77, 85. Support Support for Social Evolution came from notable readers. The philanthropist Charles Booth described the book as \\"striking and original.\\" Alfred Marshall, an influential economist, found the book so exciting and interesting that it spawned an acquaintanceship with Kidd.David Paul Crook, Benjamin Kidd: Portrait of a Social Darwinist (Cambridge University, 1984), 89. Lester Frank Ward, \\"the acknowledged founder of American sociology,\\" called the \\"tone\\" of Social Evolution \\"generally healthy.\\"Robert C. Bannister, Sociology and Scientism: The American Quest for Objectivity, 1880-1940 (University of North Carolina, 1991 ) 13, . In an obituary for Kidd, Social Evolution was praised for its \\"originality and force.\\"Sir Norman Lockyer, ed, Nature, vol 98, no. 2449 5 Oct 1916, 95 (Macmillan Journals Limited, 1917), 95. Attacks \\"Believers were offended by Kidd's functional defence of religion, scientists by his faith in unreason and loose speculation, the scholarly by his pinched concept of rationality and his slanted account of history.\\"David Paul Crook, Benjamin Kidd: Portrait of a Social Darwinist (Cambridge University, 1984), 3. One scholarly book expressed \\"grave distrust of the process by which Mr. Kidd reaches his conclusion\\" and \\"of the terms in which he formulates\\" it.Robert Mackintosh, From Comte to Benjamin Kidd: the Appeal to Biology or Evolution for Human Guidance (Macmillan, 1899), 265.

The central point of Kidd's argument is \\"radically false.\\"William Thomas Stead, ed., The Review of Reviews, Vol 12 (The Review of Reviews, 1895), 159. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography' (1927) described Social Evolution as \\"incoherent,\\" \\"full of pretentious rhetoric,\\" and like \\"sensational journalism.\\" Academic circles never took Kidd's work seriously. A vehement critic of Benjamin Kidd's ideas about social evolution was the freethinker and music critic Ernest Newman. Under his pseudonym Hugh Mortimer Cecil, Newman criticized Kidd's notion of progress and the teleological content of his model of social evolution as pseudoscience.Hugh Mortimer Cecil (Ernest Newman) \\"Pseudo-philosophy at the End of the Nineteenth Century. Vol. 1. An irrationalist trio: Kidd-Drummond- Balfour.\\" London, University Press, 1897 Principles of Western Civilization (1902) Kidd's Principles of Western Civilization (1902) received negative reviews as reported in The Review of Reviews. The review in the Positivist Review used such terms as \\"imbecility,\\" \\"sonorous fatuity,\\" \\"rank nonsense,\\" and \\"metaphysical bamboozlement.\\" The review in the Fortnightly Review called Kidd's history \\"muddled and perverted\\" and described the book as \\"a wordy confusion . . . without real definiteness or point.\\"William Thomas Stead, ed., The Review of Reviews, Vol 25 (Office of the Review of Reviews, 1902), 384. Last years In 1903, Kidd moved away from London for a life of \\"ever increasing seclusion.\\" However, he continued to write and lecture. In 1908, he lectured at the University of Oxford on the subject of \\"Individualism and After.\\" In 1911, he wrote the article on \\"Sociology\\" in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. From 1910‚Äì1914, Kidd wrote The Science of Power. However, the beginning of the first World War necessitated revision by his son, Franklin Kidd, for posthumous publication in 1918. After a short period of ill-health Kidd died of heart disease at South Croydon on 2 October 1916.\\" The Science of Power (1918) During the last six years of his life, when Kidd was writing The Science of Power, the likelihood of a global conflict increased. Because of this, Kidd‚Äôs earlier optimism about the evolution of human society evaporated. He turned away from Darwinism and imperialism. His earlier praise of western civilization turned into \\"a searing indictment.\\"D. P. Crook, \\"Kidd, Benjamin (1858‚Äì1916),\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 18 Feb 2015. The Science of Power (1918) repeated Kidd's earlier success. Looking back, he saw a continuation of Christian altruism in \\"the ideal of permanent goodwill among nations\\" with arbitration taking the place of war. However, looking at the period preceding World War I, Kidd saw a \\"great pagan retrogression\\" exemplified by the German author Ernst Haeckel in The Riddle of the Universe,Ernst Haeckel, The Riddle of the Universe (Harper and Brothers, 1901) online at https://books.google.com/books?id=XUZD2fFFhawC&printsec;=frontcover#v=onepage&q;&f;=false. a retrogression that repudiated the Christian altruistic sanction of loving one's enemies.Benjamin Kidd, The Science of Power (G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1918), 44, 58.

Kidd's hope for the future hung on the influence of women. His praise of women in the chapter \\"Woman is the Psychic Centre of Power in the Social Integration\\" appealed to feminists. Kidd viewed women as \\"anti-pagan, i.e. unselfish, and devoted to the interests of the race,\\" all \\"in accordance with Christian altruism. Quotations He was quoted thus - \\"Oh! you wise men who would reconstruct the world! Give us the young. Give us the young. Do what you will with the world, only give us the young. It is the dreams which we teach them: it is the Utopias which we conceive for them: it is the thoughts which we think for them which will rebuild the world. Give us the young before the evil has held them and we will create a new Heaven and a new Earth.\\" by Sir Robert Baden-Powell in a Paper \\"SCOUTING AND GUIDING IN EDUCATION.\\"http://www.historicalpapers.wits.ac.za/inventories/inv_pdfo/AD1715/AD1715-19-2-2-001-jpeg.pdf Historiography A list of assessments of Kidd by historians since 1915, names over a dozen.David Paul Crook, Benjamin Kidd: Portrait of a Social Darwinist (Cambridge University, 1984), . One assessment of Kidd summarized his thinking as follows:Agner Fog, Cultural Selection (Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1999), 21. *Kidd was \\"inspired\\" by Karl Marx and Herbert Spencer (mostly Spencer), but he also \\"criticized\\" them. *He agreed with Marxists that the \\"members of the ruling class were not superior.\\" *He believed that the \\"ruling families were degenerating so that new rulers had to be recruited from below.\\" *Kidd thought the \\"white race\\" possessed \\"intellectual superiority\\" because of its \\"accumulated knowledge,\\" not (as racists held) because of an innate endowment. *He \\"agreed with racists that the English race was superior\\" in the \\"ability to organize and to suppress egoistic instincts to the benefit of the community and the future.\\" Another historian, Robert C. Bannister assessed Kidd in the context of Social Darwinism. In Bannister's reading, Kidd caused a \\"flurry\\" by his \\"pop sociology.\\" It won Kidd an immediate recognition, but in the long run \\"confounds and embarrasses later generations.\\"Robert Bannister, Social Darwinism: Science and Myth in Anglo- American Social Thought (Temple University, 1979, pb 1989), 150, 158.  Works  In addition to the five books listed below, Kidd \\"produced a prolific amount of occasional journalism, contributions to journals, encyclopaedias, reviews, columns, interviews, and letters for weeklies in Britain and America.\\"David Paul Crook, Benjamin Kidd: Portrait of a Social Darwinist (Cambridge University, 1984), 439-448.

The car was initially an Enzo Ferrari but the owner James Glickenhaus preferred the styling of Ferrari's 1960s race cars, the P Series. The project cost Glickenhaus US$ 4 million and was officially presented to the public in August 2006 at the Pebble Beach Concours d'El√©gance. Several websites were allowed to publish images of the clay model in July 2006. Development In March 2005, Glickenhaus, son of stock exchange magnate and a car collector, was approached by Pininfarina who asked if he was interested in commissioning a one-off car. Andrea Pininfarina, grandson of the company's founder later said \\"The Ferrari 612 Kappa and this P4/5 are the first. But we want to grow this business.\\" indicating that Pininfarina is interested in producing other unique cars. Glickenhaus replied that he would like a modern Ferrari P, and in June of that year he signed a contract with Pininfarina to produce the car including the price, approximately US$4 million though in an interview he said \\"I feel they gave me more than I expected\\". Glickenhaus purchased the last unsold Enzo Ferrari and upon receipt of the car he took it to Pininfarina to be redesigned similar to his David Piper P4 replica which he also delivered to Pininfarina. Pininfarina's styling team leader, Ken Okuyama said that \\"Pininfarina wanted to stay away from retro design and move towards a more forward thinking supercar\\" as they were excited by the opportunity to build the car, not just design it. Its design began in September 2005 with sketches by Jason Castriota moving through computer aided sculpture and stringent wind tunnel testing. More than 200 components were designed especially for the car. Most components, including the engine, drivetrain, are modified from the original Enzo Ferrari. The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is unchanged from the Enzo from which it was derived. The P4/5 was publicly revealed on August 18, 2006 at the Pebble Beach Concours d'El√©gance and shown again at the Paris Motor Show in late September. Upon seeing P 4/5 Luca di Montezemolo felt that the car deserved to be officially badged as a Ferrari and along with Andrea Pininfarina and James Glickenhaus agreed that its official name would be \\"Ferrari P 4/5 by Pininfarina\\". Ted West wrote an article in Car and Driver about how this came to be \\"The Beast of Turin\\". P 4/5 Competizione at the 24 Hours N√ºrburgring 2011 On September 2009, Glickenhaus announced his intention to race a new version of the P4/5 in the 2010 24 Hours N√ºrburgring. The car, called the SCG P4/5 Competizione, would not be a conversion of his road car but instead an entirely new car with a Ferrari chassis, VIN and drivetrain, made under Glickenhaus's own car brand Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus. On May 2010 however, it was revealed that the Competizione would in fact be raced in 2011, based on a 430 Scuderia. It would be built to FIA GT2 standards and raced by Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus in an Experimental Class under the direction of Paolo Garella, former Head of Special Projects at Pininfarina. Ferrari completely distanced themselves from the SCG P4/5 Competizione project in 2011, refusing to sell the team parts for vital engine rebuilds between races.Jim Glickenhaus via FerrariChat The car finished 39th in the 2011 24 Hours N√ºrburgring (after bursting into flames) and in 2012 won its class and finished 12th overall. Specifications The Ferrari P4/5 can accelerate from 0-100 kilometres per hour (0-62 mph) in 3.0 seconds (0.14 seconds quicker than the Enzo). It has a top speed of . The car has a frontal area of and the sharp nose and smooth curves mean it has a drag coefficient of 0.34. =Interior= The P4/5 The interior of the P4/5 was designed by Glickenhaus himself with an iPod nano stereo and a tablet PC which features not only GPS but a 3D model of the car as well as a complete parts list and manual for easy servicing. The P4/5 also sports improved air conditioning over the Enzo and a high-strength alloy roll bar redesigned because the original was too thick and obstructed Glickenhaus' view. The seats are custom built, Glickenhaus' and his son's bodies were scanned so Pininfarina could mould the seats for their comfort, accessibility and view of the road (as with race cars). With a frame of carbon fibre composite, the seats are covered with a black mesh and red leather as selected by Glickenhaus' daughter. Pininfarina rearranged the wiring of the car so as to make the car easier to service and lighter than the Enzo. =Exterior= The exterior of the car is made entirely of carbon fibre reinforced plastic and is similar in shape to the Ferrari 330 P4 as Glickenhaus requested, however it has been called a \\"rolling history of Ferrari-racing-DNA\\" sharing elements from several historic Ferrari vehicles, not just the 330 P4. The rear window is similar to that of the Ferrari 512S, the side vents are similar to the Ferrari 330 P3 and the nose is similar to that of the Ferrari 333 SP which improves cooling and the car's frontal crash safety. The butterfly doors (similar to those of the McLaren F1) are designed such that even at there is no wind noise. The improved aerodynamics give the car greater downforce, yet less drag, than the Enzo, which makes the car more stable than the Enzo at high speeds. =Powertrain= The P4/5's New York license plate The P4/5 has the same engine as the Enzo Ferrari it was built on, a 65¬∞ Ferrari F140 B V12. The 12 cylinders have a total capacity of , each with 4 valves. The redline at 8200 rpm and the torque of at 5500 rpm are both the same as the Enzo, but it produces marginally more power with at 7800 rpm. The P4/5 uses the 6 speed automated manual of the Enzo with black shifting paddles behind the wheel. It has two directional indicator buttons, one mounted on each side of the steering wheel. =Chassis= Much of the suspension was unchanged from the original Enzo, with the same push-rod suspension at the front and rear, and the same Brembo carbon-ceramic anti-lock disc brakes with diameter of at the front and rear. The aluminium alloy wheels are in diameter, the front tyres have codes of ZR 255/35 and the rear, ZR 335/30.

In 1794, he was invited to deliver the annual Fourth of July oration before the people of Boston. In 1800, he was made public prosecutor, and in 1803 was chosen representative to the Massachusetts General Court. He was sent to the Massachusetts Senate in 1804, serving as presiding officer from 1813 to 1823. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1810, and in 1812, he was chosen a member of the corporation of Harvard. Phillips was also elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1813.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory In 1820, he was a member of the convention that met to consider the revision of the state constitution, and he took an active part in the proceedings of that body. Phillips was also active in the agitation for the adoption of a city government in Boston, and was chairman of the committee of twelve that drew up and reported on a city charter for the town in 1822. In the choice for mayor that followed, Harrison Gray Otis and Josiah Quincy III were the chief candidates for the office, but, as neither was able to secure an election, their friends agreed on Phillips, who was elected on 16 April 1822. At the close of his term of office the precarious condition of his health led him to decline a re-election.

Originally, the first full-size corn maze was believed to be created in Annville, Pennsylvania in 1993; however, similar corn mazes were highlighted in newspapers as early as 1982. Corn mazes have become popular tourist attractions in North America, and are a way for farms to generate tourist income. Many are based on artistic designs such as characters from movies. Corn mazes appear in many different designs. Some mazes are even created to tell stories or to portray a particular theme. Most have a path which goes all around the whole pattern, either to end in the middle or to come back out again, with various false trails diverging from the main path. In the United Kingdom, they are known as maize mazes, and are especially popular with farms in the east of England. These mazes are normally combined with other farm attractions of interest to families and day trippers. Some of these attractions include hay rides, a petting zoo, play areas for children, and picnic areas. Each year a few of the mazes are featured in national newspapers and TV. In the U.S., corn mazes typically are cut down circa the first week of November; in the UK typically in September after children return to school. As of 2014, the Guinness World Record for largest corn maze was , created by Cool Patch Pumpkins in Dixon, California.  Creation  A corn maze in Delingsdorf, Germany, showing how mazes can be designed to conform to a specific theme Millets' Maize Maze 2007, Millets Farm Centre, Oxfordshire, UK In order for farmers to create a corn maze they must carefully plan their production, design, and marketing techniques in advance. # Planting the correct variety of corn is important for the success of a corn maze. Farmers must consider stalk strength and height when selecting the right hybrid to plant. # Farmers must watch for stalk rot since it is one of the most frequently observed diseases. Key factors for stalk rot include improper fertilization, moisture stress, and disease development. # Moderate plant population (about 20,000 plants per acre) would be considered ideal. If moderate plant population is not followed crop crowding can occur. # Since farmers planting for corn mazes are not growing the crop for maximum yield they should not apply too much nitrogen fertilizer. Rutgers Cooperative Research and Extension recommends the total nitrogen rate for the season should not exceed about 125 pounds per acreHeckman, J., & Sciarappa, W. (2004, June). Rutgers NJAES Cooperative Extension: Growing an \\"A-maize-ing\\" Corn Maze (PDF). Retrieved July 25, 2008 (140 kg per hectare). # Corn maze crops should be planted from mid to late May in the northern hemisphere, or mid to late November in the southern hemisphere. This is two to three weeks later than crops being planted for grain. # When cutting the walkways farmers must cut the internal growing point of the stalk off to avoid regrowth. Some farmers use herbicides, roto-tillers, or mowers to cut the walkways.

It was founded in 1997 as Fiberlane Communications with funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Vinod Khosla as the managing VC. The company was founded with three divisions: Systems in Petaluma, Chip Design in Mountain View, California and Network Management Systems in Burnaby, British Columbia. In early 1998 the company split into two companies with the Petaluma branch becoming Cerent and the Burnaby and Mountain View branches becoming Siara Systems (Acquired by Redback Networks in 1999).  The Cerent 454  Cerent's first product was the Cerent 454 (later the Cisco 15454). The Cerent 454 was a second generation SONET ADM (Add-Drop Multiplexor) that also supported TCP/IP data switching. When operating as a pure ADM, the 454 could add and drop circuits from OC-192 down to Digital Signal 1 (DS1) -- later it would support Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM). Unlike the ADMs that preceded it, a transport signal did not have to be terminated outside the box to switch or route the TCP/IP packets. \\"Data cards\\" could be inserted into the chassis which would terminate the circuits then switch or route the packets between those terminated circuits. This capability meant carriers no longer had to purchase two boxes (e.g. an ADM and a router) just to move TCP/IP packets around its telecom network. Other advantages of the Cerent 454 included: smaller form factor, higher port density, greater chip integration, and lower power consumption than competitors at the time. The unit also was the one of the first network element to utilize TCP/IP and a web server on its management interface (The first TCP/IP management network was Ditech Communications in its DWDM system, marketed in 1996) meaning it could be managed over a standard TCP/IP network as opposed to a more restrictive OSI network interface which was the standard in telecom networks at the time. This decision, while initially controversial, was promoted by Chip Roberson, for two pragmatic reasons: first, a TCP/IP stack came packaged with the embedded operating system from Wind River Systems and, second, the cost to acquire, test and support an OSI stack and associated network was comparatively cost-prohibitive for a young startup.  Founding Team  The primary founders of the company were: Raj Singh, Jay Sethuram, Ajaib Bhadare and Paul Elliott. The rest of the founding team (as of funding by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers) consisted of: * Petaluma - Systems (Cerent) ** Ajaib Bhadare ** Paul Elliott ** Chip Roberson ** David Scott * Mountain View - Chip Design (Siara) ** Raj Singh ** Jay Sethuram ** Mike Iriarte ** Anu Nigam * Burnaby - Network Management System (Siara) ** Alnoor Shivji ** Sigfried Luft The founding board of directors was: Raj Singh, Vinod Nair and Don Green (often referred to as \\"The Father of Telecom Valley\\"). Mike Hatfield soon after joined the team as CEO, replacing Raj Singh.  Purchase by Cisco Systems  In August 1999, the company was sold to Cisco Systems for $7.2 billionCisco had already invested approximately $300 million in Cerent during a prior round; the reported $6.9 billion was for the shares it did not already own. and became the foundation of Cisco's Optical Transport Business Unit.Cisco buys Cerent, Monterey Networks The Cerent 454 was rebranded the Cisco 15454 and became the fastest product (at that time) to hit the $1B annual sales rate by selling $250 million in its second quarter as a Cisco business unit. In November 1999, Redback bought Siara Systems for $4.3 billion.Redback to buy Siara Systems for $4.3 billion References External links * Cisco Systems to acquire Cerent Corporation and Monterey Networks Category:Cisco Systems acquisitions Category:Companies based in Sonoma County, California Category:Companies established in 1997 Category:Fiber-optic communications Category:Computer companies of the United States Category:Petaluma, California Category:Companies disestablished in 1999 ","title":"Cerent Corporation"},{"id":"7658472","text":"Peary Chand Mitra (; 22 July 1814 ‚Äì 23 November 1883) was an Indian writer, journalist, cultural activist and entrepreneur. His pseudo name is Tekchand Thakur. He was a member of Henry Derozio's Young Bengal group, who played a leading role in the Bengal renaissance with the introduction of simple Bengali prose. His Alaler Gharer Dulal pioneered the novel in the Bengali language, leading to a tradition taken up by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee and others. Mitra died on 23 November 1883 in Kolkata. Early life Mitra was born at Calcutta on 22 July 1814. His ancestral village was Panisehala in Hooghly District of present-day West Bengal.Ghosh, Manmathnath, Karmabeer Kishorichand Mitra, 1926, p 11 His father, Ramnarayan Mitra, moved from Panisehala, Hooghli District to Calcutta in early life and made his fortunes as baniansBanians are local brokers and agents to the European merchants in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to European merchants and officials. Kishori Chand Mitra was his brother. As per the custom of the day, he started learning Persian at a young age and in 1827 joined the Hindu College, where he started learning English. While still a student he started a school in his own home to teach others in his locality what he learnt. At some point in time his friends Rasik Krishna Mallick, Radhanath Sikdar and Sib Chandra Deb joined him to bolster his efforts. David Hare and Derozio helped him as well. Career Mitra joined Calcutta Public Library as deputy librarian in 1836. The library was established the same year in the residence of an Englishman named Strong in the Esplanade. It was later shifted to Fort William College and when the Metcalfe Hall was constructed to pay respect to the memory of Charles Metcalfe, the library was moved to the hall in 1844. Mitra rapidly rose up the ladder as librarian, secretary and finally curator, a position he held till his retirement. He was associated with a variety of social welfare activities of his day. He was a member of the Calcutta University Senate, the society for prevention of cruelty to animals, and Bethune Society. He was secretary of the British India Society (later Association). He was also a Justice of the Peace. He had interest in the development of agriculture in the country. His criticism of the permanent settlement, The Zemindar and Ryots, created a sensation. While a member of the Agricultural Society, he started an organisation for the translation of books on agriculture from English to Bengali. In 1881, when Madame Blavatsky and Col Olcott visited India, he became involved with the Theosophical Society. Journalism and literary work Mitra is particularly known for his contribution to the development of journalism and Bangla literature. He was a regular contributor to the Englishman, Indian Field, Hindu Patriot, Friend of India, Calcutta Review, Bengal Harkara and Bengal Spectator. Along with his Derozian friend Rasik Krishna Mallick, he edited the Jnananeswan. Another Derozian, Ram Gopal Ghosh, was associated with it. His major literary works include: * Alaler Gharer Dulal (1857) * Mad Khaoya Bada Day Jat Thakar ki Upay (1859) * Ramaranjika (1860) * Krsipath (1861) * Bamatoshini (1881) * Abhedi (1871) * Jatkinchit (1865) * Adhyantika (1881) In English he wrote A Biographical Sketch of David Hare (1877), The Spiritual Stray Leaves (1879), Stray Thought of Spiritualism (1879), and Life of Dewan Ramkamal Sen (1880) and an essay named The Zamindar and Royats. That was the age when Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar was writing Bengali heavily loaded with Sanskrit words and Akshay Kumar Datta was experimenting with the language in Tattwabodhini Patrika. Both were masters of Sanskrit and used all the ornamentation of that rich language. Bengali prose was in its infancy. Learned people used to poke fun at it and ridiculed the language, and a newspaper such as Iswar Chandra Gupta's Sambad Prabhakar published all that. In 1857, Mitra and Radhanath Sikdar started a small magazine, Masik Patrika, which used simple spoken Bengali prose everybody could understand. It was a major breakthrough in the use of Bengali, and the magazine instantly became popular. His novel Alaler Gharer Dulal, written under the pseudonym Tek Chand Thakur, used simple Bengali prose, closer to the spoken speech of the day, and was serialised in the magazine. It was one of the earliest Bengali novels and became an instant success.Hana Catherine Mullens wrote Phoolmani O Karunar Bibaran in 1852. This is regarded as the first novel in Bengali; Alaler Gharer Dulal was published in 1858, as per Sansad Bangali Charitabhidhan page 423. Harinath Mazumdar wrote a novel Bijay Basanta at the same time as per Ramtanu Lahiri O Tatkalin Banga Samaj, page 88. So great was its popularity that the language style came to be known as 'Alali'. That set the trend for Bengali prose then. In 1864, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay published his first novel Durgeshnandini to finally lay down the standard for Bengali prose. Alaler Ghare Dulal was later translated into English. =Dickens of Bengal= Rev. James Long was a keen observer of the literary scene in Bengal and referred to Mitra as 'the Dickens of Bengal'. He was imprisoned and fined for writing a preface to the English translation of Dinabandhu Mitra's controversial play Nil Darpan. The translation was done by Michael Madhusudan Dutt. Entrepreneurship In later life, Mitra became a successful businessman. He was partner and director of companies like Great Eastern Hotel Company Ltd., Port Canning Grand Investment Co, and Howrah Docking Co. Along with his Derozian friend Tarachand Chuckervertty, he was involved in export-import business Pearychand & Tarachand Limited.  Family  Mitra had a brother Kishori Chand Mitra, a civil servant. He had four sonsAmrita Lal Mitra, Chuuni Lal Mitra, Heera Lal Mitra and Nagendra Lal Mitra and a daughter Uma Shashi Mitra.

He had shocked the court in British India in the 1820s with the statement that he did not believe in the sacredness of the Ganges. Early life Son of Naba Kishore Mallick, he was born in 1810 at Sinduriapatti in Kolkata. His father was engaged in thread trading and was linked to the Seths, the original residents of Govindapur, which was one the villages that developed into the city of Kolkata. The family had a great standing in society. After initial education at home with some grounding in English, Rasik Krishna Mallick joined Hindu College and turned out to be a highly successful student, one of the flowers of the institution. He greatly admired the activities of Raja Rammohun Roy, who was then active in Kolkata and was greatly influenced by his thinking. In 1828, when Derozio joined Hindu College, he became one of his disciples. While still a student, Rasik Krishna Mallick appeared as witness in some case in the supreme court at Kolkata. In those days, the system was that the Hindu witnesses had to take oath touching a copper vessel containing Ganges water and tulsi (holy basil) leaf. An Oriya Brahmin came with these things to every witness. When the process was repeated with Rasik Krishna Mallick, he refused to comply. When his Bengali statement was translated in court as, \\"I do not believe in the sacredness of the Ganges,\\" there was a hush, every one put their hands to their ears and thought, \\"How can a boy from the Mallick family say this?\\" The Ganges has always been considered to be sacred by the Hindus. The result was that his family drugged him and wanted to take him forcibly to Varanasi for penance and reformation. However, Rasik Krishna Mallick recovered and ran away. His family turned him out of the house. He worked in Hare School for some time. When Indians were allowed for the first time to be appointed or promoted as deputy collectors Rasik Krishna Mallick was one of the beneficiaries and was posted to Bardhaman.On page 73 of Ramtanu Lahiri O Tatkalin Banga Samaj Sivanath Sastri mentions that prior to this Indians were not allowed to occupy positions above that of sheristadar. Even Raja Rammohun Roy had risen only to that position. During his visit to England, the Raja had taken up the matter with the British government and when the charter of the company was renewed in 1833, Indians were allowed to be promoted or appointed as deputy collectors and deputy magistrates for the first time. While he was in Bardhaman, his old friend Ramtanu Lahiri, then posted in the same town, created a sensation by discarding his sacred thread. He became religious-minded and carried out his duties fearlessly. He spurned all efforts to bribe him and established a great reputation for honesty. Achievements He was editor of the magazine Jnananwesan and was one of the sponsors of Parthenon, the first English magazine to be edited and published by Indians in 1830. He was editor of Jnantarangasindhu. He was vocal on many issues of the day and enlightened public opinion on many matters. He was actively involved in the social reforms launched by the organisation named Suhrid Samiti of Kishori Chand Mitra, brother of his friend Peary Chand Mitra. In 1831, he established a free Hindu school for the spread of education. He also tried for the spread of education though Calcutta Public Library of Rasamay Dutta. He was a strong advocate of the use of the mother tongue as the medium of education without ignoring the learning of English. He campaigned strongly for the replacement of Persian in courts by Bengali and was partly successful in the matter. Citing specific examples of political thinking by Derozians, Nitish Sengupta writes, \\"In 1833 Rasik-Krishna Mallik criticised police corruption, attributed the lack of protection of the peasantry to the Permanent Settlement, and advocated the abolition of the political power of the merchant company.History of the Bengali-speaking People, page 229. Still in the prime of his life, he died of illness on 8 January 1858.

As a New South Wales politician he was responsible for the creation of Belmore Park (north of the new Central railway constructed in 1874 in Haymarket), Lang Park (in Church Hill, between York, Lang and Grosvenor Streets in the city), Observatory Park (on Flagstaff Hill in the west Rocks) and Cromwell Park at the head of Long Bay, Malabar and parks on Clark, Rodd, and Snapper Islands. He was also the author of the New South Wales Patents Act and the Married Women's Property Act of 1879. As a judge he was able, conscientious and hard-working, and had much knowledge of law. He had the misfortune to preside over two notorious cases, the Mount Rennie rape case and the Dean trials, which caused much popular feeling, and gave him the reputation in some quarters of being a \\"hanging\\" judge. His friends agreed that this estimate was far from his character, and that though he had a brusque exterior he was really a man of noble qualities. This estimate is in conformity with the fact that he was appointed president of the charities commission in 1873, and that he was responsible for the founding of the Discharged Prisoners Aid Society in 1874. An example of his courage and common sense is his judgment on the case dealing with the proceedings arising out of Annie Besant's pamphlet, The Law of Population, which was published separately in 1889 under the title, Ex Parte Collins. Windeyer took much interest in education, was a trustee of the Sydney Grammar School, president of the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts, and a trustee of the public library. He was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sydney from 1883 to 1887 and Chancellor from 1895 to 1896. He was also first chairman of the council of the women's college at the university. He was given the honorary degree of LL.D. by the University of Cambridge, and knighted in 1891. Early life Windeyer was the only child of Richard Windeyer and his wife, Maria Camfield; and was born in London. The family left London on the Medway arriving in Sydney on 28 November 1835. Windeyer the younger was 13 years of age when his father died. His mother, a woman of much character, was left practically without means, but with some help from friends managed to buy part of her husband's estate on the Hunter River, worked it, and made a success of wine growing. Windeyer was educated at first at W. T. Cape's school, and then at The King's School, Parramatta. He was one of the first group to matriculate at the University of Sydney at the end of 1852, and during his course won a classical scholarship, and the prize for the English essay in each year. He graduated B.A. in 1856, M.A. in 1859, and was called to the bar in March 1857. He was law reporter for the Empire and then for a short time crown prosecutor in country districts. In 1857, he married the daughter of the Rev. R. T. Bolton, Mary Elizabeth (1836-1912). Lady Windeyer took much interest in educational and social questions, particularly in regard to women, and was a prominent figure in the women's suffrage movement. Political career In 1859 Windeyer stood for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Paddington and was defeated by 47 votes. He was, however, returned for the Lower Hunter at the same election. In 1860 he was returned for West Sydney, but afterwards resigned his seat on account of ill-health following the wrecking of the City of Sydney on which he was returning from Melbourne in after winning a rifle match. In 1866 he was again elected for West Sydney defeating Sir John Robertson. Chancellor of the University of Sydney. On 16 December 1870 Windeyer became Solicitor General in the third Martin ministry and held this position until 13 May 1872, but was defeated at the election held in this year. In 1876 he was returned for the University of Sydney (beating Edmund Barton 49 votes to 43), and from 22 March to 16 August 1877 was Attorney-General in the second Parkes ministry. In 1878 he obtained the assent of the house to the establishment of grammar schools at Bathurst, Goulburn and Maitland with exhibitions to enable students to proceed to the university. He was Attorney-General of New South Wales in the third Parkes ministry from 21 December 1878 to 10 August 1879. Judge and educationalist Windeyer was appointed as acting judge of the Supreme Court in August 1879. In August 1881 he became a puisne judge of the supreme court, and held this position for almost 15 years. He believed strongly in the enforcement of the criminal law, particularly where the victims were women. In the Mount Rennie rape case, he sentenced nine young men to death for pack rape, and four were in fact hanged in 1887. Ian Barker described the trial as being run in an oppressive manner, with the defence counsel not commencing their address to the jury until after midnight and that Windeyer was biased against the accused. In 1895 Windeyer caused controversy by imposing the death penalty on George Dean for attempting to poison his wife. There was a strong belief that Dean was innocent and that his wife and her mother (who was a woman of ill repute) had conspired against him. Although, Dean was very likely guilty, his death sentence was commuted and he was later released on a free pardon. He was subsequently convicted of perjury and spent nine years in jail. Windeyer resigned on 31 August 1896, prior to his trip to Europe. Death On his way to Europe Windeyer accepted a temporary judicial appointment in Newfoundland, but died suddenly while at Bologna, Italy. He was survived by his wife, five daughters and three sons (including Richard and William). Of Windeyer's sons, Richard, born in 1868, followed his father's profession, became a KC and for a time was an acting-judge of the supreme court of New South Wales; William Archibald Windeyer, born in 1871, was also well known in Sydney as a solicitor and public man. His daughter Margaret was a librarian and women's rights campaigner.

The Guadalupe River then continues onward into San Francisco Bay. The creek begins in the Santa Cruz mountains near the Santa Clara/Santa Cruz County border, just south of the peak Loma Prieta. It then flows northwesterly to Lake Elsman, a reservoir owned by the San Jose Water Company, then on to Holy City and Chemeketa Park, then northward into the Lexington Reservoir. The creek then flows through the Los Gatos Canyon and through the town of Los Gatos and Vasona Reservoir, then northeasterly through Campbell and San Jose where it meets the Guadalupe River. History Upper Los Gatos Creek confluence with Lexington Reservoir Between Lexington Reservoir and downtown Los Gatos, the creek runs in a deep concrete culvert alongside the Los Gatos Creek Trail right The creek was named after the Alta California land grant Rancho Rinconada de Los Gatos (\\"Corner of the Cats\\"), which itself was named for the cougars and/or bobcats that roam in the mountains above the present-day town of Los Gatos. The first settlers, a Spanish family arriving in 1839, were scouting for a homestead in the area when they heard mountain lions roaring and fighting. While frightened, they also recognized it was a good omen, for it meant water couldn't be far away. They discovered the creek and built a home in what is now Vasona Lake County Park. On Hare's 1872 map the creek was called Arroyo de Los Gatos and Zachariah Jones called it Jones Creek at the time he laid out the town he called Jones Mill (which later became the now submerged Lexington, California). Forbes Mill was established by James Forbes along the creek in the 1850s; the town of Los Gatos was subsequently built around the mill. In 1866, extreme flooding of the Los Gatos Creek caused it to naturally cut a new channel in what is now the Willow Glen neighborhood of San Jose, running west and north of its original channel. The reshaped creek left behind a dry creek bed, known as Dry Creek. Today‚Äôs Dry Creek Road runs parallel to the creek bed. The construction of State Route 17 in the 1950s forced much of the creek through Los Gatos to be diverted into a concrete gulch. As a Caltrans magazine from the era describes it: \\"Included in this project is a relocation of Los Gatos Creek for a distance of 6,000 feet, requiring a concrete line channel.\\" The Los Gatos Daily Times on Aug. 31, 1954, reported that \\"bulldozers have virtually completed clearing and leveling the bed of Los Gatos Creek, and preparations are readied for laying the concrete culvert.\\" Also in the 1950s, the construction of the James J. Lenihan Dam formed Lexington Reservoir, which flooded much of a small valley above Los Gatos, including the former townsites of Lexington and Alma. The dam and reservoir were completed in 1952, forcing the rerouting of Highway 17. When the reservoir's water level is low, the concrete bed of the old highway through those towns can be seen, along with foundations from some buildings. In spite of these events, much of the creek maintains its natural course and beauty. Below Vasona Park, Los Gatos Creek feeds percolation ponds that are part of the groundwater recharge system built by the Santa Clara Valley Water District. North of Lark Avenue, one can also see a structure resembling a fountain, where imported water from other reservoirs is also added to Los Gatos Creek for recharge. In the 1920s, people discovered that Santa Clara Valley was sinking because of groundwater pumping. San Jose's elevation subsided 13 feet from 1910 to 1970s, correlated with a 250 feet decline in the underground water table. The valley's aquifers were also in danger of being ruined by saltwater infiltration. Local reservoirs were built to provide water for an aggressive groundwater recharge program. While simultaneously dealing with the demands of growing cities, the water district finally managed to stop further sinking by the 1980s. Vasona and Lexington reservoirs were part of the effort. Habitat and wildlife California golden beaver family on upper Los Gatos Creek left Chinook salmon spawning on Los Gatos Creek in 1996 by U. S. Highway 17. right Beaver and dam on lower Los Gatos Creek, tributary to the Guadalupe River, courtesy of South Bay Clean Creeks Coalition. Fish were plentiful for the first settlers of Los Gatos Creek. Newspaper stories in the 1880s describe catches of 100 to 200 trout a day. One pioneer wrote that \\"speckled trout were so plentiful, they could be caught with your hands.\\" Based on the locations of fish collections made in 1895 and historical habitat condition suitable for salmonids, Los Gatos Creek likely supported a healthy population of steelhead trout (coastal rainbow trout) (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus). A 1952 California Department of Fish and Game document stated that substantial steelhead runs had not been seen in Los Gatos Creek since 1937, when agricultural pumps lowered the water table throughout the Santa Clara Valley and dewatered the lower reach. However, stream resident coastal rainbow trout populations remain in the portions of the creek maintaining permanent flow, just below and above of Lexington Reservoir. The Santa Clara Valley Water District reservoir system has now raised water tables sufficiently that lower Los Gatos Creek once again supports steelhead trout. However, stream resident rainbow trout may produce offspring which become anadromous. Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) that migrate up the Guadalupe River and Los Gatos Creek from San Francisco Bay. Both chinook and steelhead have been spotted as far up the creek as Hamilton Avenue (see inset photo). Although some have asserted that the Chinook salmon in the Guadalupe River watershed (which includes Los Gatos Creek) are strays from Central Valley hatcheries, a 1992-1994 genetic study of 29 fish showed that some have haplotypes not found in Central Valley wild or hatchery salmon, but found in the Russian River. This is significant because the California Coast Chinook salmon Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU) was considered federally threatened September 16, 1999 (64 FR 50394) and reaffirmed June 28, 2005 (70 FR 37160), although the Russian River is normally considered the southernmost limit for this ESU. Between Lake Elsman and Lexington Reservoir, the creek is pristine and closed to the public. Here, along with rainbow trout, beaver, bobcats (Lynx rufus), wild boar (Sus scrofa) and puma (Puma concolor) are extant. The beaver were restocked to the portion of Los Gatos Creek where it enters Lexington Reservoir sometime before spring 1992, and recently, a beaver reportedly served as \\"a hearty meal\\" for a local mountain lion. Historical evidence of beaver in the area includes reference by Captain John Sutter who around 1840 recorded that 1,500 beaver pelts were sold \\"at a trifling value\\" by the Indians to Mission San Jos√©, the latter only 25 miles from the town of Los Gatos. Physical proof of golden beaver in south San Francisco Bay tributaries is a Castor canadensis subauratus skull in the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural History collected by zoologist James Graham Cooper in Santa Clara, California on Dec. 31, 1855. Cooper lived in Mountain View, California from October to December 1855 and collected most of his specimens on Saratoga Creek (then \\"Quito Creek\\"). Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) began to re-colonize the watershed after at least a 150-year absence with documentation of nesting sites in 2004. Watershed The Los Gatos Creek sub watershed drains . Los Gatos Creek originates at on Loma Prieta Mountain in the Santa Cruz Mountains and flows west to the minor Williams Reservoir above Lake Elsman (also a reservoir formed by Austrian Dam), where it is joined from the north by Austrian Gulch. Its next named tributaries are Hooker Gulch Creek, Moody Gulch and Hendrys Creek, also joining from the north, before Los Gatos Creek enters Lexington Reservoir. In Lexington Reservoir the next tributaries (left) are Aldercroft Creek and Briggs Creek (left), and by the more major Soda Springs Creek (right), then Black Creek (left), Lyndon Creek (left) and Limekiln Creek (right). Below Lexington Dam Los Gatos Creek flows northeast and is joined immediately by Trout Creek (left) then, north of Blossom Hill Road, it flows into Vasona Reservoir in Los Gatos, which is formed by Vasona Dam. In Willow Glen Los Gatos Creek is joined by Dry Creek (left) then, after crossing Interstate 280, El Camino Real and The Alameda, it joins the Guadalupe River in the Guadalupe River Park. Recreation The Los Gatos Creek Trail runs along the river from Lexington Reservoir to the Guadalupe River near downtown San Jose and is popular among local hikers and bicyclists. In Los Gatos, Vasona Reservoir is another reservoir along the creek located in Vasona Park, one of the most popular parks in the Santa Clara County parks system. The Los Gatos Creek Park is located in Campbell, a city that is bisected by Los Gatos Creek.

Along with her husband, Reed established what is now the Heide Museum of Modern Art. Personal life Reed was born on 15 October 1905 in Melbourne, Australia, to Arthur Sydney Baillieu and Ethel Mary Baillieu (). She was a member of Melbourne's Baillieu family and the niece of William Baillieu, one of Australia's richest men. She was the third of four children and was homeschooled by a governess until she was 15. Reed finished her education at St Catherine's School, Toorak. In Melbourne, Reed met Leonard Quinn, an American living in England. They were married on 31 December 1926 at Sorrento, Victoria and traveled in France and England for two years. Reed was diagnosed with gonorrhoea in 1929. The disease and several operations including a hysterectomy left her unable to bear children and deaf in her right ear; after her diagnosis, Quinn deserted her in England. Through family influence and connections, she was able to obtain a divorce from him on 31 June. She met solicitor John Reed at a tennis party in 1930. They married on 13 January 1932 at St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne. Their marriage was recorded with the state but not with the church. In the 1930s, Reed studied art under George Bell in his Bourke Street Studio School in Melbourne. Her only remaining work is a landscape drawing, showing her skill with colour and form. In 1934, the Reeds purchased a former dairy farm on the Yarra River at Heidelberg, Victoria, now Bulleen, which became known as \\"Heide\\". They were both interested in many forms of art, including jazz, poetry, and writers. The couple hosted a variety of artists, for whom Reed would cook. According to Andrew Stephens, talented artists at Heide \\"helped shape Australian art from the 1930s on\\". The Reeds lived on the property until their deaths in 1981, a short time after the property had become the Heide Museum of Modern Art. Reed cultivated a selection of wild roses, along with many other flowers. In 2015, about 150 of the 250 bushes she planted remained. She was resourceful in obtaining cuttings and plants, having some imported from overseas. The Reeds also sought out nurseries specialising in old roses, and sourced plants from Alister Clark, who bred some of Australia's more popular roses. The couple supported the Communist Party of Australia (CPA). John helped fund CPA candidates in federal elections. The Reeds took over care of and eventually adopted Joy Hester's son Sweeney after Hester was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma in 1947. John Reed died on 5 December 1981. Sunday Reed died ten days later, on 15 December. Reed was the aunt of Ted Baillieu, who in 2010 became Premier of Victoria. Heide Circle A number of modernist artists came to live and work at Heide at various times during the 1930s, 40s and 50s; many of the most famous works of the period were painted there. These artists were known as the Heide Circle and included Sidney Nolan, husband-and-wife couple Sam Atyeo and Moya Dyring, Albert Tucker and Joy Hester (who married in 1941), John Perceval, and Laurence Hope, among others. Nolan painted all but one of his 1946‚Äì47 Ned Kelly series on the dining room table. The Heide Circle is known for the intertwined personal and professional lives of the people involved. Atyeo had an affair with Sunday; Dyring had an affair with John. Art historian Janine Burke has suggested Nolan and Sunday Reed had a close collaborative relationship. According to Burke, Reed helped Nolan find his artistic voice and in the process developed from a studio assistant to painting sections of the works herself, in particular the red and white squares in The Trial. Nolan left his Kelly paintings at Heide when he departed under emotionally charged circumstances in 1947. He had lived in a m√©nage √† trois with the Reeds for several years. Nolan wanted Sunday to commit herself to him and after her refusal he married John Reed's sister Cynthia. Although he spoke to the Reeds only once again, his years there have been seen as a significant factor in all their lives. Nolan once told Reed to take what she wanted, but he subsequently demanded all his works back. Reed returned 284 of his other paintings and drawings, but she refused to give up the 25 remaining Kellys, partly because she saw the works as fundamental to the proposed Heide Museum of Modern Art. She gave them to the National Gallery of Australia in 1977, resolving the dispute. In the 1950s, Heide was again the centre of a circle of younger artists and poets, including Charles Blackman, Robert Dickerson, Judith Wright, Barrett Reid, Charles Osborne, Laurence Hope and Nadine Amadio. Reed was the first person to buy Blackman's work extensively. In the 1960s, Sweeney Reed invited his circle of artist and poet friends to Heide; these included Les Kossatz, Allan Mitelman, Shelton Lea and Russell Deeble. In popular culture According to David Rainey, the relationship between Sunday Reed and Sidney Nolan is the basis for Alex Miller's 2011 novel Autumn Laing. Philippe Mora's 2013 film Absolutely Modern discusses modernism, the female muse, and sexuality in art; it is based on 1940s Heide. Rainey's 2014 play The M√©nage at Soria Moria is a fictitious performance piece exploring the relationship between the Reeds and Nolan, both during Heide's heyday in the 1940s and in the years after. Namesakes Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban's daughter Sunday Rose Kidman, born in 2008, is said to be named after Reed; Kidman's father, Antony Kidman, has said he suggested the name. Urban stated in a 2009 interview that she was named after the day of the week, not Reed.

It is in the Blue Ridge Mountains part of the Appalachian Mountains. Holston Mountain is a very prominent ridge-type mountain in Tennessee's Ridge and Valley Region, about 28 miles (45 km) long, running from southwest to northeast, covering about 268 square miles (694 km¬≤). Its highest summit is Holston High Point, on which a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aircraft navigational beacon is located, at an elevation of 4,280 feet (1,304.5 m) above mean sea level. The second highest point is Rye Patch Knob, at 4,260 feet (1,298.5 m) above mean sea level. The third highest point is Holston High Knob where an old dismantled Cherokee National Forest fire tower (now a Communications Tower) marks the elevation at 4,136 feet (1,240.5 m) above mean sea level. Geography Panoramic view looking northeast towards Johnson County, TN along spine of Holston Mountain from Holston High Knob. South Holston Lake (Sullivan County, TN) is on the left and the Stony Creek Community (Northeast Carter County, TN) is on the right side. Holston Mountain is located in the Cherokee National Forest. It is bounded on the northwest by South Holston Lake; on the southeast by Stoney Creek Valley, Shady Valley, and the Iron Mountains; on the northeast by the town of Damascus, Virginia; and on the southwest by the community of Keenburg, near Elizabethton, Tennessee. The southern portion of Holston Mountain marks the boundary between Sullivan County and Carter County; the northern portion is between Sullivan and Johnson County. The small northernmost portion extends into Washington County, Virginia. The main waterfall at Blue Hole Falls located on Holston Mountain in Carter County, TN. Panhandle Road is located off State Highway 91 in Carter County and ascends Holston Mountain for three miles (5 km) from the eastern side and ends four miles (6.5 km) along the ridge southwest of Holston High Point. During periods of heavy snow and ice, hunting season, or nesting season, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency closes off Panhandle Road with an iron gate. Located near the Cherokee National Forest boundary and to the left of Panhandle Road is a parking area and foot trail that leads down the slope to the Blue Hole Falls (approximately high). The iron gate referred to above is there, owned and maintained by the Cherokee National Forest, Watauga Ranger District. No matter, though.. the last three miles (5 km) of Panhandle Road along the top of the ridge are filled with washouts, steep drop-offs, and no turnarounds. Vehicle travel on those last three miles (5 km) is at the driver's risk. U.S. Route 421 crosses Holston Mountain at Low Gap, connecting the community of Shady Valley, Tennessee, with the city of Bristol, Tennessee. History Holston Mountain is named after the Holston River, which is named for Stephen Holston, a descendant of a Swede of New Sweden. Stephen Holston moved west and in 1746 built a cabin near the headwaters of a little creek. When surveyors were working in the area the next year they gave the creek the name \\"Holston's Creek\\", because Stephen Holston lived on it. Later pioneers followed the creek downstream where, after receiving many tributaries, it was wide enough to become a river and so it became known as the Holston River. George R. Stewart, describing this placename history, notes, \\"Thus one of the largest streams of that region came to bear the name of a common settler\\". Stewart goes on to note that the nearby Clinch River is likewise named for a \\"common settler\\". Unlike Holston, the identity of Clinch is unknown, except that Dr. Walker wrote of a stream called \\"Clinch's River from one Clinch, a hunter\\". October 4, 1976 Kingsport, Tennessee Daily News staff writer, Mark Aldeen, in an article entitled \\"Investigation Into Cause Of Plane Crash Continues\\", reported the crash landing of a USAF reconnaissance plane on Holston Mountain, 13.2 miles from the Tri-cites airport. The RF-4C \\"Phantom\\" carried two Airmen, neither of whom survived. September 1, 2007 The FAA says five Jehovah's Witnesses ministers from East Tennessee were killed when their small plane crashed in the Cherokee National Forest on Holston Mountain shortly after takeoff. A passing airplane spotted the smoldering wreckage around 7:00 p.m. Saturday about a mile and a half down the southern side of the mountain, from the Holston High Point broadcasting antenna farm. Trails The Appalachian Trail crosses over from Iron Mountain from the southeast side, then runs along the upper northeast end of Holston Mountain. The trail descends on the northeast end, sloping down the mountain into Virginia, the town of Damascus, and continues to Mount Rogers, the highest point in Virginia. Communications Hub Early broadcasters in the 1950s and 1960s quickly realized Holston Mountain as a prime radio-television transmission location because it is the highest visible point that faces most of the major cities in Upper East Tennessee and Southwest Virginia in the surrounding valley between Knoxville, Tennessee, to southwest of Roanoke, Virginia. As a result, the Holston Mountain ridge is the transmitting site for five television stations in the Tri-Cities, Tennessee Television Designated Market Area (DMA). The digital broadcasting antenna for WCYB, digital Channel 5, Bristol, Virginia is on Rye Patch Knob, with the top of the antenna 341 feet (104 m) above ground, 2,431 feet (741 m) above the surrounding valley floor, and 4,533 feet (1381.6 m) above mean sea level. The single tower that antenna sits on, is the highest and tallest man-made structure on the mountain, allowing the Virginia station to transmit from the highest broadcasting point in Tennessee, Virginia and Kentucky. The television towers for WJHL, digital Channel 11, Johnson City, Tennessee, and WKPT, digital Channel 19, Kingsport, Tennessee, are standing side by side in a common broadcasting antenna farm on the southwest slope of Holston High Point, one mile (1.5 km) southwest of Rye Patch Knob. The antenna for WJHL stands 200 feet (61m) above ground, 2,319 feet (707m) above the surrounding valley floor, and 4,370 feet (1,332m) above mean sea level. The antenna for WKPT next door stands 193 feet (58.8m) above ground, also 2,319 feet (707m) above the valley floor, and 4,366 feet (1,331m) above mean sea level. The transmitter for WEMT, digital Channel 39, licensed to Greeneville, Tennessee was relocated from Camp Creek Bald (Viking Mountain) south of Greeneville to the WCYB digital tower on Rye Patch Knob, when ownership of WEMT was acquired by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, owners of WCYB. Holston Mountain is also the transmitting site for three FM Class C radio stations: WTFM-FM 98.5, Kingsport, Tennessee; WXBQ-FM 96.9, Bristol, Virginia and WETS- FM 89.5, Johnson City, Tennessee. All three antennas and the backup antennas are located at the antenna farm on the southwest slope of Holston High Point. Also located on the ridge are the antenna for one FM Class C1 radio station, WHCB-FM 91.5, Bristol, Tennessee, located at Rye Patch Knob; one FM Class C2 antenna for radio station WCQR-FM 88.3, Kingsport, Tennessee, and one FM Class D antenna for radio station W214AP-FM 90.7, Johnson City, Tennessee, both transmitting from the antenna farm on the southwest slope of Holston High Point. Located further down the southwestern slope, off of Holston Mountain Road, is the transmitting site of FM Class C3 WEXX 99.3, Elizabethton, Tennessee. Various U.S. federal, Tennessee state, Sullivan, Washington and Carter County governmental agencies, along with utility microwave relay stations, also transmit base-to-mobile communications from the Holston High Point antenna farm and Rye Patch Knob. Holston Mountain is also home to several amateur radios transmitter sites. kg4vbs repeater site sits on the highest peak of the mountain for two-way radio service. This site covers seven states in communications. The tower (shown below) is 120 feet self-supporting. It tops out with an antenna on top of 18 more feet. thumb Antenna farms The Holston Mountain collection of broadcast towers, commonly referred to as an \\"antenna farm\\" is a good example of radio and TV station owners, co- locating their broadcast towers near each other on the highest point near their FCC city of license. This marketing practice was borne during the 1950s, before cable and during a time when all homes had outside antennae to receive broadcast signals. When the viewer wanted to receive a clear picture or FM stereo from their favorite station, they would point their antennae toward that radio or TV station's broadcasting tower (usually on the highest mountain peak nearby). Other station owners realized the benefit of locating their transmitting towers near that one, to allow viewers to get clear signals from their stations, too. The nearest antenna farm to Holston Mountain is southwest to Sharp's Ridge, on which most of the FM and TV stations in the Knoxville, Tennessee Designated Market Area (DMA) have their antennas and towers. The next nearest from Holston Mountain is on Poor Mountain in Central Virginia, home to most of the FM and TV stations in the Roanoke, Virginia Radio and Television DMA. Although most radio and TV stations are in fierce competition with each other in their broadcast markets, they will often locate their broadcasting antennas very near each other, and in some cases, will even share land or towers with each other, in the interests of space, land availability, and the cost of putting a transmission building on top of a mountain.

The central character's name, Stan Hooper, was taken from Macdonald's work on Saturday Night Live, but the characters were vastly different. The role also allowed Macdonald to play the straight man among a cast of eccentric characters, a departure from his traditional comedy style. Plot Hooper, a famous newspaper columnist turned television commentator, moves his family from their New York home to a small Wisconsin town, Waterford Falls, where he hopes to better get in touch with Middle America in an attempt to make his weekly minute-long television commentaries more appealing to a larger audience. While there, he interacts with the folksy, and largely strange, townspeople of Waterford Falls. Macdonald has said his goal was for the show to lull its audience into complacency, and become more subversive as time went on. It included a plan for Stan's wife Molly to be murdered by a drifter at the end of the first season. The show was cancelled before any such plans were enacted.

This form saw him take out the Copeland Trophy and earn a spot in the All-Australian Team. 1992 saw Achilles tendon problems for Francis, but he still enjoyed a solid season. Later career Following this, Francis continued to suffer injuries, such as the thigh and knee problems that hampered him in 1995. He showed better signs, however, when he finished 3rd in the 1996 Copeland Trophy award. 1997 saw a groin injury restrict him to 10 games, and he again managed only 10 matches in the 1998 campaign.

Under Israeli law, the Israel Land Administration cannot lease land to foreign nationals. In practice foreigners may be allowed to lease if they show that they are eligible to immigrate to Israel in accordance with the Law of Return. In 2000, the High Court ruled that the State may not allocate land to its citizens on the basis of religion or nationality, even if it allocates the land through a third party such as the Jewish Agency.

After the city's incorporation in 1910, citizens voted for their own library, and the new city took over the operation of its library facility. Soon, the upstairs reading room opened by the Woman's Club quickly outgrew itself. Woman's Club members‚Äîalong with many other community organizations‚Äîcampaigned to get a public building built to house a permanent library collection. The late Mrs. E. A. Davis then composed a letter to Andrew Carnegie asking for the funds to help the community build a new facility. Mr. Carnegie responded by sending a check for $7,500. However, Carnegie placed a contingency on his donation: the City of Hemet had to contribute the remainder of the $12,000 necessary to complete the construction. The City of Hemet agreed to contribute the funds soon after. The land used for the first library facility was donated by Mr. and Mrs. James St. John and the library was built there on the corner of Buena Vista Street and Florida Avenue. Construction of the \\"Carnegie Library\\" was completed in early 1913. The Carnegie Library remained open and operated by the City for 52 years. The Carnegie Library was eventually razed in 1969 having stood in the community for 56 years. This made room for the C. B. Covell Memorial Library Building which began construction in March 1971.

It derives its responsibilities and powers from the Independent Police Conduct Authority Act. Under section 12.1 of the Act, the Authority's functions are to receive complaints alleging misconduct or neglect of duty by police employees; or concerning any practice, policy, or procedure of New Zealand Police and to take action as contemplated by the Act. It may also investigate any Police incident involving death or serious bodily harm and make recommendations to the Commissioner of Police based on those investigations. The Authority also monitors conditions of detention and treatment of detainees in Police custody. In this respect, the IPCA is one of several 'national preventive mechanisms' designated in 2007 under an amendment to the Crimes of Torture Act.Monitoring places of detention, IPCA website Other agencies with responsibility for monitoring places of detention include the Human Rights Commission, the Children's Commissioner and the Ombudsmen. Together, these agencies including the IPCA, have joint responsibility to uphold New Zealand's commitment to the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment (OPCAT).  History  Prior to 1989, complaints against the Police were investigated internally by Police. Following several years of debate about Police accountability, sparked in part by the role of Police during the 1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand, the Police Complaints Authority was established on 1 April 1989.History, IPCA website The Police Complaints Authority comprised a single person, the first Authority being High Court Judge Peter Quilliam. Because of its reliance on police to investigate themselves, the Authority was perceived as lacking independence. Allan Galbraith, was appointed as the Authority's first Manager of Investigations in 2003 and held that position until 2010. He had been a member of the New Zealand Police for 37 years.Allan Galbraith, IPCA website In 2004, a number of historic sexual misconduct allegations dating from the 1980s were made against both serving and former police officers. During that year, Prime Minister Helen Clark announced a Commission would be established to carry out an independent investigation into the way in which the New Zealand Police had dealt with allegations of sexual assault.New Zealand Police Commission of Inquiry, Police website The investigation was conducted by Dame Margaret Bazley and took three years. It reviewed 313 complaints of sexual assault against 222 police officers, including 141 in which Dame Margaret said the evidence was strong enough to warrant criminal charges or disciplinary action.Police get 'culture change' hurry up, NZ Herald 7 January 2011 Dame Margaret's inquiry identified the inadequacy of police investigations into misconduct by their own officers and recommended that a more independent investigative body was needed. In November 2007, the Independent Police Conduct Authority was established as a Board of up to five members headed by a Judge. The new Authority was mandated to focus on conducting investigations independent from Police.  Membership  At its inception, the new Authority was headed by High Court Judge, Lowell Goddard.Former cop's job on line after abuse claim, Stuff website, 4 April 2010 And in August 2010, Parliament appointed three new Board members to the Authority: Angela Hauk-Willis, a former deputy secretary of Treasury, with special responsibility for corporate governance, Maori responsiveness, and ethics and integrity; Dianne Macaskill chief executive and Chief Archivist at Archives New Zealand from 2001 to 2009; and Richard Woods, who from 1999 to 2006, was the director of the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service, and from 2008 was chairperson of the Environmental Risk Management Authority.People and structure, IPCA website In April 2012, Judge Sir David Carruthers, former chairman of the New Zealand Parole Board, was appointed Chair of the Independent Police Conduct Authority for a term of five years. Soon after he took over, he said he wanted to see more of the watchdog's work opened to public scrutiny.Editorial: IPCA must explain Parlane secrecy. In 2015 Parliament approved a Notice of Motion reappointing Dianne Macaskill and appointing Simon Murdoch CNZM as part time members of the Authority for a term of three years. Judge Sir David Carruthers retired in August 2017 and was succeeded by Judge Colin Doherty as Chair of the Authority for a term of five years. = Investigators = The IPCA employs 25‚Äì30 full-time staff including investigators, analysts, legal advisors, communications and support staff.IPCA website, Work for the IPCA The official website indicates that its current and former investigators have backgrounds in police and other investigative work in Australia, Canada, England, Scotland, New Zealand and other jurisdictions. Their collective experience includes investigation of homicides, organised crime, drug enforcement, fraud and corruption, terrorism, war crimes, and a wide range of other criminal conduct. The Authority's team-approach to its work ensures that no one person is solely responsible for the decision-making processes around investigations and their outcomes and that the appropriate expertise and level of independence is applied in every case.

Where considered appropriate, the Authority will independently investigate a complaint or incident; however a number of matters are referred to Police each year for either investigation or resolution by way of mutual agreement with the complainant. The IPCA oversees the Police handling of these complaints, usually by conducting a review or audit of the Police investigation after it is completed.Independence, IPCA website In cases involving fatalities or allegations of serious misconduct, the Authority conducts its own investigations. It may also investigate incidents in which there is a significant public interest in having an independent investigation, for example when allegations are made against a senior Police officer.What happens to your complaint? IPCA website If a complaint may lead to an officer being charged with a criminal offence, the Police are required to conduct an investigation, as the IPCA does not have the power to lay charges. However, the IPCA can conduct a parallel investigation, oversee or directing the Police investigation, or reviewing the Police investigation once it is completed. Police Association President Greg O'Connor in 2013 said the reason most complaints to the IPCA weren't investigated was because they were \\"frivolous\\" and made by \\"perennial complainers who complain about everything to everyone\\".Most IPCA complaints 'frivolous' - police. 3 News NZ. 10 October 2013. Independence and effectiveness The IPCA is independent from the New Zealand Police. It is not part of the Police and is required to make its findings based on the facts and the law. It does not answer to the Police or anyone else over those findings and in this sense, its independence is similar to that of a Court. The Authority's status as an independent Crown entity means that there is no political involvement in its operations. Chair, Judge Sir David Carruthers stated that he believes the IPCA should be able to conduct \\"own motion\\" investigations, similar to those conducted by the Ombudsman. He said there were stories in the media about police conduct and behaviour where the IPCA does not necessarily receive a formal complaint, meaning no independent investigation is conducted.Police watchdog wants ability to launch its own inquiries The IPCA has no ability to prosecute police, and can only make recommendations, which the police are not obliged to follow.Trust in police hits new low survey shows, Stuff website 16 October 2012 In 2013, the (then) newly appointed head of the IPCA, Sir David Carruthers, said he was considering whether to recommend new powers of arrest and prosecution for the Authority.Delay in police-raid inquiry 'an outrage' Stuff website 13 October 2012 In does not make all its findings public. After an IPCA investigation, following a complaint from Mii Teokotaia of Tokoroa after she was arrested in the 2005, before the charges were dropped, the IPCA \\"deemed them not of sufficient public interest\\" to release the report, despite senior Police involvement.Shamed cop given plum London job, Stuff website 23 October 2010 The IPCA chairman said in February 2013 that the IPCA is \\"now likely to reporting on all investigations unless there's an overwhelming private interest that's paramount.\\" Concerns have been raised that the ICPA is slow to release reports, however in response to these concerns the IPCA stated \\"the IPCA takes great care with its investigations and releases its reports once it is fully satisfied they are thorough, accurate, balanced and complete. Justice will always be our priority over speed.\\"Stress for police after 22 months and still no report In February 2013, IPCA chairman Sir David Carruthers said he hoped to speed inquiries up acknowledging that it is \\"very cruel on everybody, families, victims and police officers too when investigations dragged on over years\\".  Significant IPCA reports  The Authority regularly releases reports on its investigations and makes these publicly available on its website. Historical reports are also available as is information about its operations including Annual reports, Statements of Intent and Statements of Performance Expectations. Deaths from police pursuits: In 2009, the IPCA released a report which found that out of 137 recent chases, only 31 were started because of known criminal activity.Police: 'No perfect solution' to pursuits Dominion Post 18 May 2013 The IPCA recommended that the decision to pursue be based on known facts, rather than general suspicion or speculation about the offender and suggested police make \\"the risk to public safety from not stopping an offender\\" the main consideration, however Police have chosen not to implement this recommendation.The chase is still on, NZ Herald 25 November 2010 After the deaths of three people in a police pursuit in 2012, the IPCA recommended that pursuit policy would should require officers to \\"state a reason for beginning a pursuit.\\" It also recommended compulsory alcohol and drug testing of police officers involved in fatal incidents. Officer should have stopped chase - IPCA, Dominion Post, 10 May 2013 Police involved shootings: The IPCA is required to investigate all police shootings and has found that in all seven Police shootings in the past ten years, that Police were lawfully justified in using lethal force to defend themselves.The details of each case are contained on the IPCA website. Child abuse cases: In 2011, the IPCA released a report on the outcome of its Inquiry into Police handling of child abuse cases which began in August 2009. This followed a Police report in 2008 which found widespread failings in management of child abuse cases in the Wairarapa District. Those failings included poor case management and workload management, poor supervision, and a lack of accountability and responsibility. Submissions were sought, and the Authority conducted an audit of child abuse cases throughout New Zealand, investigating individual complaints about Police responses to child abuse allegations. The IPCA chairman, Justice Lowell Goddard, said the scale of the inquiry had been unprecedented for the Authority and concluded \\"there were serious failures in the Police investigation of child abuse, which must never be repeated\\". The IPCA made 34 recommendations. The Police responded positively, and Commissioner Howard Broad established a Child Protection Implementation Project Team that has since led substantial changes to Police policies, practices, and procedures.Authority urges continued momentum for change in abuse investigations Deaths in police custody: In June 2012 the IPCA released a comprehensive report on deaths in police custody between 2000 and 2010. The report revealed there had been 27 such deaths in the last ten years and raised serious concerns about inadequate risk assessment procedures used by police. Following their review, the IPCA made 20 recommendations, including better training being provided to officers about the dangers associated with restraining people in a prone position with their hands tied behind their back and that detainees who are unconscious or semi-conscious and cannot answer questions and/or physically look after themselves \\"must be taken to hospital\\".Deaths in Police custody ‚Äì lessons from a ten-year review, IPCA 30 June 2012 Treatment of teenagers in police cells: In October 2012, the Authority issued a report on the treatment of teenagers held in police cells following reports in January 2012 about two young girls who were detained and strip-searched by Upper Hutt police.Police watchdog to look into teens' ordeal, Dominion Post, 3 October 2012 The IPCA launched a wider investigation which found that the number of youths being held in police cells has more than doubled since 2009.website Joint thematic review of young person's in police detention p 39 It said that \\"youths in crisis are being locked up in police cells and denied their human rights.\\" Police practices that \\"are, or risk being, inconsistent with accepted human rights\\" include: being held in solitary confinement; having cell lights on 24 hours a day; family members being prevented access; and not being allowed to see the doctor when they have medical or mental health problems.IPCA website Joint thematic review of young person's in police detention The IPCA made 24 recommendations into how police can improve the detention and treatment of young people in custody.Report: Troubled teens denied human rights, NZ Herald 23 October 2012 Urewera raids: In May 2013, the IPCA released its report into police action during the Urewera raids which occurred on 15 October 2007.

Whitworth also coached baseball at Alabama from 1933 to 1934 and the University of Georgia in 1943, tallying a career college baseball coaching mark of 22‚Äì21. Coaching career From 1950 to 1954, he coached at Oklahoma A&M;, and compiled a 22‚Äì27‚Äì1 record. From 1955 to 1957, he coached at Alabama, where he posted a 4‚Äì24‚Äì2 record, the worst record for a non-interim coach in school history. This included a winless 1955 season, Alabama's last winless season on the field to date, and a 14-game losing streak from 1955 to 1956. In his first year at Alabama, Whitworth was only allowed to hire two of his own coaches and forced to retain the rest of former coach Harold Drew's assistants. This included athletic director Hank Crisp, Whitworth's boss, who was in charge of the defense. Whitworth brought assistant coach Moose Johnson with him from Oklahoma A&M.; Following successive 2‚Äì7‚Äì1 seasons in 1956 and 1957, Whitworth was fired and replaced by Bear Bryant. In 1951, while Whitworth was coaching Oklahoma A&M;, the infamous Johnny Bright Incident, occurred in the football game in Stillwater, Oklahoma, against the visiting Drake Bulldogs. Whitworth subsequently acknowledged to the press that the hit on Bright was illegal, but did not suspend the player responsible. One player later alleged that Whitworth had instigated the incident through labelling Bright a \\"prima donna\\" and expressing racist sentiments during practice. Whitworth was an Alabama graduate and had played tackle on the football team alongside Fred Sington. He was an assistant football coach at Alabama, Louisiana State University, and the University of Georgia prior to becoming a head coach. In 1959, Whitworth returned as a line coach for Wally Butts' SEC champion Georgia team. Whitworth was the head baseball coach at Georgia in 1943, compiling a 1‚Äì10 won-loss record.

Life  Bell was born at Antermony, near Milton of Campsie, Stirlingshire, in Scotland. He studied medicine in Glasgow, and in 1714, set out for Saint Petersburg, where, through the introduction of a fellow Scot, he was nominated medical attendant to Artemy Volynsky, recently appointed to the Persian embassy, with whom he travelled from 1715 to 1718. The next four years, he spent in an embassy to China, passing through Siberia and the great Tatar deserts. He had scarcely rested from this last journey when he was summoned to attend Peter the Great in his expedition to Derbent and the Caspian Gates. In 1738, he was sent by the Russian government on a mission to Constantinople, returning in May to Saint Petersburg. It appears that after this he was for several years established as a merchant at Constantinople, where he married Mary Peters, a Russian lady, and returned to Scotland in 1746, where he spent the latter part of his life on his estate, enjoying the society of his friends. After a long life spent in active beneficence and philanthropic exertions, he died at Antermony on 1 July 1780, at the advanced age of 89. He is buried in Campsie Glen. His travels, published at Glasgow in 1763, were speedily translated into French, and widely circulated in Europe. His only work is Travels from St. Petersburg in Russia to various parts of Asia 1763, in two volumes printed by Robert and Andrew Foulis of Glasgow. The Quarterly Review says that Bell wished to obtain literary help in writing his book, and applied to Robertson, who could not help him, but advised him to take Gulliver's Travels for his model.Quarterly Review. 1817. pp. 464‚Äì465. The work was based on diaries kept by Bell during his travels. Although Bell's primary purpose for travel was as medical attendant, his book is highly descriptive and, due to its wide circulation, an important contribution to travel writing about Siberia in the 18th-century.

Outdoor Education is a course offered at Clear Water from grades 7-10, which allows for students in these grades to participate weekly in various activities that are too time-consuming or difficult to cover in a normal physical education class. Religion The Catholic theme is very prevalent at Clear Water Academy, with a Prayer for the Bishop and decade of the rosary every morning, a prayer before every class, the Angelus before lunchtime, and weekly mass every Friday afternoon. There is a weekly apostolic course for most grades, which involves either some apostolic activity around the city (ex. raking leaves to benefit single, lower-income mothers), a discussion on the Virtue of the Month, or creating a presentation for a younger grade. Also offered is a religion course, where students learn about Catholic church history and teachings, and how to be better Catholics. Apostolic Work One of the pillars of Clear Water Academy is Apostolic formation. Clear Water Academy's apostolic program allows students to participate in various charitable activities such as serving the hungry, helping the homeless, and volunteering at the local bottle depot. Clear Water Academy has organized several mission trips to Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Mexico over the past few years. The students' goal on the trips was to paint either a chapel or a church. The students strengthen their relationships with their peers, teachers, and most importantly God. Furthermore, they gain a better understanding of the poverty that the people of a third world country endure and an appreciation for the country and culture which they live in.

It was built as a highway bridge in 1904 but has been restricted to pedestrian use since 1980. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003 for having local significance in the theme of engineering. It was nominated for being the work of noted Minnesota engineer William S. Hewett and his bridge building firm the W. S. Hewett Co., an example further recognized for its exceptional ornamentation. History A previous bridge at this location, dating to the 19th century, was Mazeppa's only crossing over the Zumbro River and a link on a key road between Rochester and Lake City, Minnesota. That bridge was condemned in 1901 but remained in use until the Mazeppa village council contracted with the W. S. Hewett Co. in 1904 for a replacement, selling bonds to help raise some of the $3,775 cost. The new bridge was completed in August of that year. As such it fell within a unique window in Minnesota bridge construction: in the prior decade steel had supplanted iron as the construction material of choice, but in 1911 the recently formed Minnesota State Highway Commission would enact standards that led to far greater similarity in bridge designs. The Walnut Street Bridge remained Mazeppa's primary river crossing until 1922, when a new highway bridge was built one block to the north. The Walnut Street Bridge continued to carry local traffic until 1980, when it was closed to vehicles. It served as a pedestrian bridge but was closed altogether in 1995. The city of Mazeppa rehabilitated the bridge from 2001 to 2002, removing non-historic elements, replacing deteriorated structures, and adding new safety features. The rehabilitation project reopened to bridge to pedestrian use and won an award from the Preservation Alliance of Minnesota.

It is also referred as Mundaka or Gernika estuary. Urdaibai is located on the Bay of Biscay coast, in the north of the Iberian Peninsula. Urdaibai covers an area of with some 45,000 inhabitants, most of them concentrated in the towns of Bermeo and Gernika. The territory is characterized by a hydrographic basin of small streams that merge in a great salt marsh surrounded by high sheer cliffs. The surrounding countryside is occupied by meadowland, oak groves, leafy woods and specially by plantations of fast-growing conifers (Pinus radiata). The coastal landscape is covered with Cantabrian woods of Holm Oak and Strawberry Trees. In Urdaibai have been described 615 species of vascular plants and 318 species of vertebrates, 245 of which are birds. The area contains remnants of the Prehistoric, Roman and the Middle Ages. Particularly notable is the Santimami√±e cave, which has yielded archeological artifacts from the Mousterian (Middle Paleolithic Age) to the Iron Age. The economy is based on metallurgy, fishing, farming and forestry. An important tourist sector is based on the quality of the local beaches. Mundaka is especially appealing for surfers around the world. Description The Oca river rises in the Oiz mountain and finishes in the Cantabric sea. The coast is rugged and with high cliffs and some islands, of which the most important is Izaro Island.Izaro island The development of forests reserves have allowed a degree of environmental conservation, which gives this area the most diverse landscape of the Basque Country. Climate and temperature The area of Urdaibai has an Atlantic climate, wet and warm and regulated by the sea (with temperature between 9-19 degrees C.) The annual rainfall is heavy; the rainiest months are November and December, although it is distributed during all the year. Precipitation is generally rain. Because of the influence of the sea, the temperature is moderate during the year (the average temperature is 13/14 degrees). Landscape Oka's marshes The landscape is formed with mountains, sea and sands, which are produced by the sediments of the estuary, where marshes are flooded by the tides. The rivers Laga and Artigas go directly to the sea. The first ends in Laga's beach, and the second one creates a small valley between the Sollube mountain and Bermeo. = Estuary = The estuary, together with Santo√±a's natural park, is arguably the most important wetland in the Iberian Peninsula. The estuary is the heart of the Biosphere Reserve, which is a habitat for a wide variety of migratory and resident birds. As regards migrating birds, the attractions of the biosphere reserve, and in particular the Urdaibai Bird Center in Gautegiz Arteaga, are promoted to birdwatchers as part of the international \\"Bird Flyway\\" project.What is BirdFlyway?Urdaibai Bird Center The interior is defined by the mountains, and on their slopes are forest plantations of Monterey Pine used to make wood. There also are a few forests with local trees, such as Oak; and near the coast are plantations of Eucalyptus. On the central area, the land becomes flat and it is used in agriculture. This landscape is supported by livestock and agricultural development. The estuary extends from Guernica to Busturia, and a 5 km canal has been made in order not to dry up. = Mountains = The slopes of the mountains are covered by forests of Holm Oaks down to the sea's edge. The limestone nature of the bedrock has led to a kast system, where numerous caves and galleries may be found. = Coast = Laida's beach To the north, at the mouth of the estuary, the sands of Sukarrieta and Laida line the shore of the Oka River. To the west are the sands of Santa Katalina, Murgoa and Lamera. The Murgoa has a slope of a hundred meters, forming places like Trankilpunta and Kargaderua. After Bermeo are found the cliffs of Talape and Tonpoi. In the flysch that is made at the foot of the cliff can be found the \\" Arribolak\\", large stones which have been released from the wall and later rounded by the sea. To the east the sea stops being rough. Flora and fauna = Protected areas = The biosphere reserve was designated in 1984. = Flora = The flora that is developed in Urdabai, is clearly an atlantic base. There are a lot of meadows, oak groves, lush forests and especially plenty of Monterey pines. The coastal area is covered by cantabrian forests. The vegetable world that can be found here, is formed by 615 species of plants. Human activity has substantially modified the space, but the agricultural works have allowed the recuperation of original vegetation. The vegetation has, mainly in the marsh, a degree of singularity because of the specialization and also and its particular appearance. However, at the same time it has a high grade of diversity originated by the salinity. The area of Urdaibai is composed by different environments, each of which has its own vegetation and animals that create their own ecosystem. * The coast * Mountain on the left side * Middle tract of the Oka and its tributaries * Closed valleys from the Oka * Karstic area and the environment on the right side * The Guernica and Mundaka valleys = Fauna = The big variety of ecosystems that can be found in the Urdaibai make possible the faunistic wealth, with 318 species of vertebrates, apart from the amount of different birds. * Fish: in the head of the river there are trout, eels and loachs mainly, while in the middle we found barbels. * Amphibians: although they are too much in danger, many salamanders, toads and different kind of frogs are common in there. * Birds: the birds are the most important part of fauna in Urdaibai. Most of them emigrate from Europe to Africa and in the other way. Orueta wetland, located in the heart of Urdaibai, is a suitable place to observe the ornithological wealth. Moreover, Urdaibai Bird Center, an investigation center is available to visit and enjoy the Orueta wetland. Some of them are, black storks, herons, eagles.Scottish ospreys... * Mammals: in this group we can difference little and big animals. The first ones are, for example: moles, shrews, dormice... Geography There are four distinct areas of interest in the reserve: *The estuary. *The shores. *Holm Oak areas. *Archeologic areas. Geographically three distinct areas can be distinguished: The mountains, the marshes and the coast with its cliffs and beaches. Human occupation The population of the Busturialdea, which practically coincides with that of the protected Biosphere Reserve of Uradibai area is about 45,000 inhabitants are mainly located (80%), in the towns of Guernica Luno and Bermeo. Human presence has been ongoing in the area since prehistoric times, having testimonies based on findings from the Upper Paleolithic. Notable Roman remains, especially disrupted the necropolis with burials from the first century until the nineteenth century found in the church of San Martin de Tours of Forua. The two largest centres of population are the municipalities of Bermeo and Guernica. Bermeo is a village founded in 1236 and one of the most important fishing ports of Biscay. It is the most populous town in the region and was the capital of the Lordship of Biscay from 1476 until 1602. Guernica is formed by the union of the historical town of Guernica with Porch of Luno. Guernica, founded in 1366, is the historical seat of the General Assembly of Vizcaya and it is the House of Meetings with Tree of Guernica, a symbol of Basque privileges. It is also famous worldwide for the bombing suffered in the Spanish Civil War of 1936, the subject of Picasso's painting 'Guernica'. The remaining populations are small centers that cater to the historical political demarcation of the Lordship of Biscay in which the call Level Earth was organized porches. Mundaca and Elanchove are coastal populations, the first of which is at the mouth of the Oka. Both populations have a fishing origin although the current economic engine is tourism. The village is the residential unit and farming and ranching in which has traditionally been the livelihood of the region of Busturialdea. This type of interaction between man and the environment has produced the landscape of Atlantic countryside which makes up much of the area of Urdaibai. Within the territory of the Urdaibai there is a great variety and richness of villages, all of them examples of rural Architecture and of great ethnographic value. The economy is based on metallurgy, fishing, agriculture and forestry. There is also a tourism sector, focusing mainly on local beaches and natural values of the reserve. Mundaca is especially attractive for surfers from around the world. Maps Image:Urdaibai.svgLocation of the Urdaibai Biosphere Reserve in Biscay. Image:Urdaibai detalle.pngMap of the reserve.

A right-hander, Morehead pitched for the Boston Red Sox (1963‚Äì68) and Kansas City Royals (1969‚Äì70). As a rookie in Morehead broke into the Red Sox starting rotation and posted a 10‚Äì13 record with a 3.81 earned run average. He shut out the Washington Senators in his Major League debut on April 13. On May 12 of that same year, he pitched a one- hitter against the same Senators, the lone hit coming on a Chuck Hinton home run. In Morehead went 8‚Äì15 and his ERA ballooned to 4.97. In he tied for the American League lead with 18 losses, against 10 victories, for a Red Sox team that finished next-to-last, with 100 losses. On September 16 of the latter year, the same day the Red Sox fired Pinky Higgins as general manager, Morehead no-hit the Cleveland Indians 2‚Äì0 before only 1,247 fans in a day game at Fenway Park, the lone baserunner coming on Rocky Colavito's second-inning walk. Not until Hideo Nomo in would another Red Sox pitch a no-hitter, and the next no-hitter at Fenway Park wouldn't come until (Derek Lowe), It was the fourth no-hitter by a Red Sox pitcher in a ten-year period, with Mel Parnell pitching one in and Earl Wilson and Bill Monbouquette both pitching one in . Parnell's and Wilson's no-hitters, like Morehead's, had also been pitched at Fenway Park‚Äîone of Major League Baseball's most notorious hitter-friendly stadiums. It would be another 37 years before a Red Sox pitcher threw a no- hitter at Fenway. Over the next three years, Morehead would be beset by arm ailments that limited him to 33 games pitched‚Äîone fewer than in 1965. He was a member of the Carl Yastrzemski-led Red Sox team that won the American League pennant and pitched two games in relief in the World Series, which the Red Sox lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. Morehead was selected in the expansion draft by the Kansas City Royals and pitched in 21 games in , 19 in relief. In he pitched in 28 games and posted a 3.62 ERA, the lowest of his career. In spring training of , the Royals released him; he had pitched his final game at 28 years of age, the arm ailments having ended his career prematurely. In his career, Morehead won 40 games against 64 losses with a 4.15 ERA and 627 strikeouts in 819 innings pitched. He also exhibited periods of wildness, walking 463 batters during his career.

West River Memorial Park. The West River is a U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed April 1, 2011 freshwater stream in southern Connecticut. It flows through the towns of Bethany, Woodbridge, and New Haven before discharging into New Haven Harbor. Within the city of New Haven, the river is surrounded by Edgewood Park and the West River Memorial Park along much of its length. While the river's natural channel winds along the western edge of the West River Memorial Park, a very straight channel (a former rowing course) cuts through its middle and terminates at the park's northern edge (Derby Avenue). There is a public canoe launch, maintained by the City of New Haven Department of Parks, Recreation, and Trees, in the constructed channel at Derby Avenue. Dams The river is dammed in several places and some of the reservoirs are used by the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority to provide a percentage of the public water supply. The reservoirs are named Konolds Pond, Lake Dawson, Lake Watrous, and Lake Bethany, in order from south to north. Rowing Course A rowing course was constructed along the river in New Haven in what is now West River Memorial Park in 1920. At the time, the Yale athletic program studied the idea of building a larger course for use in collegiate rowing competitions, but evidently decided against it. During the mid-1970s, there were further plans for the expansion of the rowing course into an \\"Olympic rowing course\\", but these plans never came to fruition. The development by the International Rowing Course Foundation would have included a grandstand with seating for 5,000 people and a variety of other athletic facilities. Tide gate Around 1920, the City of New Haven installed flapper style tide gates downstream of Orange Avenue (U.S. Route 1). The gates were installed to control mosquitos, to provide flood control, and to allow areas of the salt water marsh to be filled to provide for additional land for development. However, the flapper gates degraded the environment in several ways: they blocked fish passage upstream to historic spawning areas; they change the vegetation to a fresh water regime; they limited the extent of flushing in the reflecting pool; and they reduced tidal influence up to and including the Duck Pond in Edgewood Park. This change to a fresh water regime allowed invasive species to overrun the river's banks. Most notably aggressive root systems and dense growth patterns allowed the common reed (Phragmites australis) to crowd out a variety of native species. The degraded nature of the river was recognized for several decades through studies by Yale University and by private consultants hired by the City of New Haven. In 2009, a grant under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and distributed by NOAA funded the West River Habitat Restoration Project, managed by Connecticut Fund for the Environment, a local environmental nonprofit. After several revisions to the plans, based on neighborhood input, the project was completed in 2012. This project removed 3 of the 12 existing flapper tide gates and installed 3 self-regulating tide gates (SRT). These SRTs allowed water to exit the river when the river was higher than the harbor tide and allowed salt water to enter the river system when the tide rose above the river. The SRTs are also designed to close when the incoming tide is extremely high and would cause damage to the existing infrastructure upstream. It will take years for the habitat of the river to return to pre-1920 conditions (or anything similar to those conditions) but some immediate improvements have been noted. The Phragmite population is showing signs of being stressed, acres of tidal wetland have been restored, and anecdotal evidence of increased fish passage has been reported.

Its buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. with  History  St. Peter's congregation () was founded February 14, 1860, by German immigrants, with 34 charter members. In 1861, the congregation bought a frame building for its first church and moved it to the corner of South Eighth and West Scott Streets. In 1866, the congregation built a small brick-clad Gothic-influenced church designed by John Rugee. In 1873, the congregation added the frame parsonage which still survives, and, in 1879, the school building. In 1884, 13 families were released from the congregation to establish Christ Evangelical Lutheran Church. The congregation is affiliated with the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS). The current church building was designed by Milwaukee architect Andrew Elleson in Victorian Gothic style and built in 1885. It has a cruciform floor-plan, with a massive square tower on each side of the front entrance - one tall and the other tall. The pedimented gables on the larger tower have a German flavor, similar to St. Mary's in Lubeck. The spires on the towers and the peak of the gable are topped with crosses. The interior is well-preserved, with the altar standing in a tall apse, and in front of an antique white wood reredos. To the altar's left is an elevated goblet-shaped pulpit. A U-shaped balcony rings the sides and back of the nave, a common feature of 18th century churches in Germany. A large pipe organ commands the back. Other remaining structures in the complex are: * The 1873 parsonage is south of the church - a wood frame building in simplified Italianate style. It is now used for church offices. * The 1879 school building stands across the street from the church - a 2-story Italianate-styled brick building designed by architect John Rugee. * The 1898 social hall designed by O.

Paton was first elected to southern Arizona's Legislative District 30 as a member of the Arizona House of Representatives in 2004. He won reelection and began his second term in February 2007. In 2008, he was elected to the Arizona Senate, again representing Legislative District 30. On January 17, 2010, Paton announced he would be challenging Democratic U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords. He subsequently resigned from the state Senate to focus his efforts on campaigning for Congress. Paton lost in the 2010 Republican primary and endorsed his former opponent, Jesse Kelly. He ran for Congress again in 2012, this time in Arizona's newly formed 1st Congressional District, ending in close defeat against Democratic opponent Ann Kirkpatrick. Early life, education, and early career Paton was born in Tucson, Arizona. He grew up on the city's East Side. He graduated from Sabino High School in 1989. During his senior year in high school Paton worked at Marie Callender's restaurant as a busboy and saved up the funds to go to Germany as a Rotary exchange student. He returned home and began his studies at the University of Arizona. In the coming years he would spend more years overseas studying in Almaty, Kazakhstan with the Sister Cities Program, Ludwig-Maximillians- Universitaet in Munich as a Rotary Foundation Scholar and in Moscow through a program administered by the University of Arizona. He also interned with the Arizona State Senate in 1995. Paton graduated from the University of Arizona summa cum laude and with honors in German and Russian in 1996. He continued on to the graduate program in German at the University of Arizona. Paton went on to work for the Southern Arizona Homebuilders Association, representing one of the key industries and job providers in Southern Arizona. In 2001, Paton began a political consulting firm in Tucson called Paton & Associates. He has worked with numerous clients in state and local races as well as on initiative campaigns. Military service In 1999 Paton enlisted in the United States Army Reserve. He served in the 5-104th Military Intelligence Battalion at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. He was named \\"Soldier of the Year\\" for his battalion, brigade and eventually for the entire 104th Division in 2000. After becoming instructor qualified and being promoted to sergeant, he received his commission as a second lieutenant. In 2005 after his first year in office, he was called up for active duty for six months in a new Army program called the Basic Officer Leaders Course, which combines infantry training at Fort Benning, Georgia with military intelligence training at Fort Huachuca. He graduated as class leader of the Military Intelligence Officer Basic Course in January 2006. He continues to serve as a captain and a qualified 35D all- source intelligence officer. In late July 2006, Paton announced he was being voluntarily deployed to Iraq. The announcement received national and international media attention. He was the only state representative to be reelected while deployed in the CENTCOM theater of operations in 2006. Paton served as an intelligence officer involved in operations throughout Iraq. His tour of duty ended at the end of February 2007. Arizona legislature First elected to the state House in 2004, Paton sponsored a bill that allowed the state to crack down on human smugglers‚Äîthe first of its kind in the country. He was a key supporter of an extension of state financing for Rio Nuevo, a downtown redevelopment project in Tucson. He was the prime sponsor of a bill eliminating state income taxes for active duty military personnel in Arizona. In his second term in the House, Paton sponsored legislation that forced the Arizona State Retirement System to divest itself of all funds that included petroleum companies doing business with Iran. Paton was most known in 2007, however, for a series of hearings on CPS following the deaths of three Tucson children murdered after their parents were investigated by CPS. Paton, along with State Representative Kirk Adams, led the hearings on CPS negligence in the cases. The two sponsored a package of six bills designed to open up CPS case records of murdered children and create more accountability for the agency. All six bills were eventually signed into law by Gov. Janet Napolitano in 2008. Due to his work on open records and freedom of information, Paton was awarded the \\"Freedom of Information Award\\" by the Arizona Newspaper Association two years in a row. In 2009 The Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry named Paton \\"Senator of the Year.\\" In 2008, State Senator Tim Bee finished his last term in the legislature representing District 30 due to term limits. In a bid for Bee's State Senate seat in November 2008, Paton defeated Democrat Georgette Valle in the General Election by over 20 points. Incoming Senator President Bob Burns appointed Paton to serve as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, a post once held by Tucsonans Elaine Richardson (D) and Patti Noland (R). Before leaving the Senate to run for U.S. Congress, Paton voted in favor of SB1070, Arizona's immigration law. =Committee assignments= *Senate Judiciary Committee *Senate Commerce and Economic Development Committee *Senate Education, Accountability and Reform Committee U.S. House campaigns References External links *Senator Jonathan Paton Official Arizona Senate site *Paton for Congress official campaign website * Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:United States Army officers Category:American army personnel of the Iraq War Category:University of Arizona alumni Category:Members of the Arizona House of Representatives Category:Arizona Republicans Category:Politicians from Tucson, Arizona ","title":"Jonathan Paton"},{"id":"7659264","text":"Original buildings now form part of the apartment complex. The Lever Brothers Factory in the Sydney, Australia suburb of Balmain was a soap factory which operated from 1895 until 1988. It employed many people from the local area and its large industrial buildings were a prominent feature of the landscape. Most of the site was demolished in 1996 to make way for a new apartment complex and only three of the original buildings remain. Localization The factory was situated on a 10 hectare (24.71 acre) site near Booth Street and Punch Park in the western end of Balmain, adjacent to White Bay. History Lever Brothers factory 1939. The British Lever Brothers company was founded in 1885 by William Hesketh Lever. Lever Brothers Ltd was incorporated in Australia on 21 June 1894. Papers relating to Levers Pacific Plantations Limited and related companies, 1894-1928, Pacific Manuscripts Bureau (PAMBU), Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies (RSPAS), Australian National University (ANU), Canberra. Soon after this, in 1897, Lever Brothers established a plant at Balmain to extract oil from copra which was shipped back to Liverpool, England.Solling, M; Reynolds, P; Leichhardt: On the margins of the city, Allen & Unwin, 1997, pp 125-6, . In 1900, the Balmain plant began to manufacture Sunlight soap and glycerine, and other products followed. Early in 1914, William Lever visited Melbourne as part of a worldwide tour of Lever interests. During the visit he met with J.Kitchen & Sons, who were established soap manufacturers, and offered to amalgamate the two firms. After consideration, it was agreed that Lever Bros would purchase three-quarters of the shares in J.Kitchen & Sons in return for cumulative preferred ordinary shares in Levers. Levers later bought all the remaining shares, and by about 1923-24 fully owned both companies. Shortly after, the company became known as Lever & Kitchen.Kitchen, C; John Kitchen, Chemical Industrial Pioneer, A Soap Story; Victorian Historical Journal; Vol 64, No. 1; April 1993. [member.melbpc.org.au/~tonkit/kitchen/docs/SoapStory.pdf] In 1989, the Home and Personal Care businesses of Lever & Kitchen merged with Rexona in Australia to form L&K;: Rexona. The company changed name in 1993 to Lever Rexona and in 2000 merged with Unilever Foods to form what is now Unilever Australasia.Unilever Australasia Company Website, Australasia's history, , Accessed 30 October 2006. At its prime in 1958, the Balmain factory employed as many as 1,250 workers, many of whom were local residents. The complex contained a glycerine refinery, toilet soap plant, an oil refining and hardening works, as well as many storage tanks, extensive wharves and a small fleet of lighters and workboats. The Balmain plant was wound down from the 1970s, having lost its waterfront and glycerine plant to the container wharf development at White Bay. Production eventually ceased in 1988. Together with the adjoining Ampol site, the area was sold in 1996 for the development of the Watervale, Dockside and Somerset Mews apartment complexes. Like many of the other Balmain industries such as the former Balmain Power Station, the Colgate-Palmolive Factory, and the many shipyards, boilermakers and docks scattered about the Balmain foreshores, the Lever Brothers Factory lost out to the ever-increasing property values in the area. Other information * Balmain master soapmaker, William Wainwright, was mayor of Balmain in 1922 and one of a number of Freemasons at Lever Brothers. * As well as soap and glycerine, the factory also produced Lifebuoy antiseptic soap, Monkey Brand, Lux flakes and toilet soap, Pears soap, Rinso, Persil, Solvol, Omo, Handy Andy and Continental packet soups. * William Lever is credited as being the first soap manufacturer to imprint a brand name on a bar of soap (‚ÄòSunlight‚Äô) and wrap it before sale. * In 1930, Australian politician William Wentworth worked briefly at the site as a factory-hand.Professor D J Anderson, Presentation of the degree of Doctor of the University to William Charles Wentworth IV, The University of Sydney, 15 March 2006, References External links * *NSW Planning - Local Walks * Category:Buildings and structures in Sydney Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1996 Category:Unilever Category:Balmain, New South Wales ","title":"Lever Brothers Factory"},{"id":"7659273","text":"The Zumbrota Covered Bridge is the last remaining historic covered bridge in the U.S. state of Minnesota.

It is reported to be 75 percent cheaper than a conventional pad and thus an advantage to the poor, as well as being highly absorbent. It is Africa's first hand-made menstrual hygiene product that is made completely with materials available locally, with its biggest production plant being in Kawempe. Makapad is an acronym used for menstruation, administration, knowledge, and affordability.  Background Information  The papyrus sanitary pad aims primarily to help make sanitary pads an affordable and accessible necessity for young girls in developing countries. They help tackle the problem of girls' absenteeism in school owing to menstruation and associated behaviours for which they do not have adequate facilities (for example: lack of privacy for cleaning, poor availability of pads, lack of education about menstrual hygiene, lack of separate toilet facilities, and lack of access to water). Many women in the west of Uganda have to employ poor substitutes for sanitary pads, considering they are twice the cost of their average incomes ($1,25 a day). While only a handful few can afford this luxury, most others make use of cloth rags, banana leaves, or waste paper. Along with being ineffective options, they can also affect the women's menstrual hygiene negatively. They pose a risk to their health and contribute to their increasing absenteeism. In light of this situation, Makapads, being absorbent pads with up to 8 to 10 hours of usage, are not only better alternatives among other available menstrual products, but also help balance out the negative effect on the environment that conventional sanitary pads have.  Production  The pads, developed by Dr. Moses Kizza Musaazi at Uganda's Makerere University Department of Technology, are targeted especially at rural primary school girls who have started menstruating. These girls would normally find it difficult to attend school if they had no pads, and often cannot afford conventional pads. These sanitary pads also provide employment opportunities for the women of the rural communities in Uganda. They are made entirely by hand, using local materials. This was part of the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) program to provide locally made Makapads to women and girls throughout refugee camps in Uganda. The pads are made out of dry papyrus and mixed with waste paper and then stitched with non-woven absorbent pieces of cloth. The papyrus fibres, once dried and pulverised, are mixed with paper and water to make a thick paste. The paste is then sun-dried, smoothed and cut to size into absorbent inserts. This is the only part of production which is performed mechanically with the help of machines. The rest of it mostly produced manually and is thus a form of employment for many. The pads are then exposed to ultra violet light to eliminate any germs or bacteria. Finally, they are combined into packs of three and are ready to be put up for sale.They are made almost entirely from natural materials, the rest being non-woven material and polythene paper. The main materials used in producing these pads are papyrus and waste paper. The energy consumed in their production is direct sunlight (350 W), through solar panels, making it a very environment-friendly and sustainable option. These pads are almost 100 per cent biodegradable, are chemical-free, and also affordable since their target audience are young girls in developing countries, mainly Sierra Leone and Uganda. There are a few limitations in the production and distribution of Makapads. Presently, Makapads are not very popular in the commercial market, and are heavily dependent on the UNHCR for funding. Additionally, they can be produced only in very specific kind of environments which provide adequate water supply and suitable soil for growing papyrus. This makes their production a little less reliable than alternatives available  Benefits  = Reducing Girls' Absenteeism in School = Providing considerable protection from menstrual health issues, as well as the shame (and discrimination) that comes with the use of poor menstrual products, Makapads help combat young girls' absenteeism in school. They can also help reduce the rate of early-leavers in school which are predominantly girls. = Intolerance-free = Since Makapads are made almost completely with natural materials, users of the pads are highly unlikely to experience any intolerance or negative bodily reactions as a consequent of their consumption. = Source of Employment = The process of production is mostly manual, with limited use of machinery., making it necessary for there to be considerable manpower available for its production. The production of these pads requires no special training or education to be undergone by the employees. With a little on-the-job training, the manufacturing of these pads provides employment especially to those who would otherwise struggle to find a meaningful source of income. For example, Technology for Tomorrow Limited specifically employs those women who do not have any alternative to approach for income generation. This makes it a good way of making a livelihood. Additionally, Makapad lays special emphasis on admitting refugees into the program so that they can be trained, can acquire skills, and be offered and opportunity for employment. Joining hands with the UNHCR, it launched a pilot project that focused on the training and employment of refugees particularly. Makapads' general manager, Juliette Nakibuule, says, \\"Here at Makapad, refugees acquire skills and earn an income. We hope to train more refugees on a monthly basis and we want at least 20-30 refugees to work here\\". A south-east Ugandan plant of Makapads in Kyaka II refugee settlement is run by a refugee and employs over 50 of them. = Eco-friendly = As mentioned above, the Makapad is a fairly sustainable option as compared to conventional sanitary pads. It is composed almost fully of materials that are easily biodegradable, natural, and do not require the consumption of artificial forms of energy. = Independent Production = All the materials required to produce Makapads are produced locally, enabling the producers to be free from dependence on contributions or imports to sustain their production. Since they are natural, there is no need for a special disposal system to be established, cutting costs of production and enabling the selling of the pads at an affordable price. A simple production process using only local materials means that eventually, the concept could be easily transferred to other women, who could then produce and distribute the pads themselves.  Sustainability  A study in the Journal of Cleaner Production highlights that one of the most important ways Makapads are better than commercial sanitary pads is that it is a product made for women, made by women employees, designed by African women, as well as made for African women. Keeping aside the question of whether or not more African women prefer this product over others, the production process is certainly better in terms of the \\"environmental, economic, and social footprint\\" it leaves. It also facilitates in Africa the fairly new phenomenon of women managing a factory and making all relevant decisions. Moreover, unlike other globally produced menstrual hygiene products which have only a fraction of their price allotted as wages for the manufacturing employees, 65 per cent of the price of the Makapads is what constitutes the employees' wages, producing a \\"social economic effect by moving the laborer's wages from $1/day to $5/day. The same study evaluates the degree of sustainability of Makapads on the basis of what the author calls the \\"3 pillars of sustainability\\". = Environmental Impact = With the exception of the little plastic that is used, all materials used in production are completely renewable. According to the author, \\"there are thousands of hectares of untapped papyrus; which for centuries has been left undisturbed\\". Papyrus also grows back within a short period of 6 to 8 months. As for the paper used, it is mostly recycled paper or that provided for free by corporations as CSR. Most of the energy consumed is renewable, except that used by transportation trucks. While manufacturing the pad does use up a lot of water, it is all harvested from rainwater which is stored in large underground tanks. It does, however, have quite a bit of air emission from transport trucks and disposal systems which incinerates the residue. It must be noted though, that these pads are also biodegradable, while others produced are nont. = Economic Impact = Compared to imported pads in Uganda, Makapads are half the price. The author recommends that the all-natural nature of the pad could be sold for premium prices in developed countries, and the profit from this could be used to subsidize the prices further in developing countries, enabling larger accessibility. Wages for the women employed are 5 times higher than average wages of Uganda. It has helped many women overcome acute financial stress that was characteristic of their lives previously. = Social Impact = More women have been able to access sanitary pads owing to this initiative. The fact that all means are obtained locally, means increased affordability. If developed countries have access to the same, it could seriously reduce the negative footprint that comes with using predominantly plastic pads.

CNFJ/CNRJ's area of responsibility extends from the southern tip of the Kamchatka peninsula to the northern tip of Taiwan, the Singapore area of operations, and the British Territory of Diego Garcia, but excludes the Korean peninsula.  Mission  As a dual-hatted commander, CNFJ/CNRJ reports to Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet for operational concerns and to Commander, Navy Installations Command for administrative and installation matters. The difference between the two titles is that CNFJ exerts operational control (OPCON) over shore-based Naval personnel in Japan, whereas CNRJ has administrative control of the installations and facilities. Essentially this, this means that all shore- based Naval forces in Japan are under the command and control of CNFJ/CNRJ. However, ships and their personnel that are \\"forward deployed\\" to Japan (which essentially is their home port) are excluded. because they are operationally assigned to United States Seventh Fleet. CNFJ/CNRJ is also only one of three Navy Regions to be commanded by a two-star admiral, along with Navy Region Mid-Atlantic and Navy Region Europe, Africa, Southwest Asia.  History  In August 1945 the U.S. Pacific Liaison Group with the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (FLTLOSCAP) was established to carry out initial naval activities related to the Allied occupation of Japan. On 28 January 1946 FLTLOSCAP was dissolved and Naval Activities, Japan (COMNAVJAP) was established under the command of Vice Admiral R. M. Griffin, who retained this command until 9 July 1948 when he was relieved by Vice Admiral Russell M. Berkey.https://history.army.mil/books/wwii/MacArthur%20Reports/MacArthur%20V1%20Sup/ch9.htm When the Far East Command was established on 1 January 1947, Admiral Griffin was redesignated Commander Naval Forces, Far East (COMNAVFE), with the proviso that the title \\"Commander Naval Forces, Japan,\\" would be used in connection with duties involving the Allied relationships for which Admiral Griffin was responsible to SCAP. On that same date Commander, Naval Activities, Japan, Commander, Naval Operating Base, Okinawa, and Commander, Naval Forces, Philippines, reported to CINCFE for duty while Commander, Marianas, reported for operational control. CINCFE in turn reassigned these responsibilities to COMNAVFE. Naval Forces Japan was initially a subordinate command of Naval Forces Far East (NAVFE), which in turn from January 1, 1947, was part of Far East Command.

Mahoney's career lasted 30 years. He was awarded Life membership of the Victorian Football League Umpires Association in 1974, and was VFL Goal Umpires Advisor (1981‚Äì87). Mahoney umpired 289 games at the elite level as a goal umpire. Early life Mahoney was born on 17 November 1931, in Newtown, New South Wales. In 1942 his family moved to Port Melbourne, Victoria. There he played football for the Port Melbourne Football Club thirds in the VFA. During his playing career his team managed to stay undefeated for 7 seasons (127 games). In 1959 he retired from football aged 27 to take up goal umpiring. Umpiring career Mahoney began umpiring at the VFL Reserve Grade. He umpired in the 1964 VFL Reserve Grade grand final. The following year, after the retirement of Jack Lee, Mahoney was promoted to the VFL senior list. Mahoney umpired in the semi-finals of the VFL in 1967, however it was not until 1971 that he officiated in a VFL grand final. He became a VFL Umpires Association life member in 1974. In 1981, having reached the then mandatory retirement age of 50, he ended his on-field career. The 1981 VFL grand final was a fitting end to a career believed at the time to be a record for goal umpiring at 289 matches. Coaching career Despite initial thoughts that his involvement was finished following the 1981 season, Jim would give another six years to goal umpiring as the inaugural VFL Goal Umpires Advisor. His term was a watershed for goal umpiring. For the first time goalies had a recognised coach and, with Assistant Coach Barry Page and a panel of former goal umpires as observers, he began coaching his squad with the experience and a philosophy from his own career. Physical fitness became a priority, all matches were observed and assessed by a goal umpires observer and over a number of years the average age of the list began to drop as younger men were given opportunities at the highest level.

It was written by consulting producer Brent Forrester and directed by Ken Whittingham. It first aired on November 16, 2006, as a special \\"super-sized\\" 40-minute (including commercials) episode on NBC. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton and Stamford branches of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, the two branches are merged. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) have an awkward reunion, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) tries to make his new employees feel welcome, and a rivalry begins between Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms). The episode featured recurring guest stars Helms, Creed Bratton, Rashida Jones, Wayne Wilderson, Mike Bruner, and Ursula Burton. According to Nielsen Media Research, an estimated 8.63 million viewers watched \\"The Merger\\" on its first broadcast. Critical reception to the episode was mainly positive, with many reviewers spotlighting Helms and his character in particular as highlights. Synopsis The Scranton and Stamford branches prepare for the upcoming merger. Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) professes excitement over the merger, mostly because of the return of Jim Halpert (John Krasinski). She soon learns throughout the day that Jim has become slightly distant to her and that he has formed a close relationship with Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones), visibly shaking her. Feeling bad with their awkward reunion, Jim catches up to Pam at the end of the day and informs her that he's seeing someone. While Pam assures him that they're still friends, Jim leaves shaken as well. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) proclaims he'll be the No. 2 man in Scranton in six weeks time through \\"name repetition, personality mirroring and never breaking off a handshake.\\" A rivalry between Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Andy begins over the No. 2 position in the office. At the welcoming party, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) plays a videotape he has created called \\"Lazy Scranton\\", which features him and Dwight rhyming over the music of Saturday Night Live's \\"Lazy Sunday\\". In a plan to unite the employees, Michael unintentionally embarrasses obese new employee Tony Gardner (Mike Bruner) by attempting to push him onto a table with the rest of the new employees, making the whole arrangement awry; this causes Tony to quit. However, an angered Michael fires him instead, also unintentionally entitling him to severance pay. When Michael announces that Jim is the No. 2 in the office, Dwight and Andy argue over who is No. 3. They find that they have a common interest: their apparent fondness towards Michael. Production \\"The Merger\\" was the fourth episode of the series to be directed by Ken Whittingham. It was written by consulting producer Brent Forrester, his first writing credit for The Office. The episode featured guest appearances from recurring actor Creed Bratton as well as from Ed Helms, Rashida Jones, Wayne Wilderson, Mike Bruner, and Ursula Burton, whose characters joined the Scranton branch. In her weekly blog for TV Guide, actress Kate Flannery stated that it \\"was a really fun episode\\" to film, as she was able to work with a variety of new actors. She added, \\"They double the size and they double the comedy... It was like a party all week shooting this episode.\\" The season three DVD contains a number of deleted scenes, including Kevin and Angela reacting to Jim's return, Karen noting that she and Meredith have the same thermos and being offered alcohol, Andy introducing himself to Kevin, Michael telling Karen and Phyllis that eventually they will \\"share the same menstrual cycle,\\" Hannah and Meredith fighting over desk space, Andy asking Kevin if he has lost weight, and Michael performing a magic trick in front of the office. The original broadcast contained a small subplot involving Kevin and a new paper shredder from Staples Inc., where Kevin talks about how he is given almost no responsibility at work but is content as long as they let him shred documents. It was removed from the episode for the DVD release and is not contained in the deleted scenes. It is included on the Amazon Prime Video version of the episode. Reception Ed Helms received positive reception for his portrayal of Andy Bernard. \\"The Merger\\" was first broadcast on November 16, 2006 in the United States on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). As a special promotion, the network broadcast \\"super-sized\\", forty-minute episodes of The Office, 30 Rock, and My Name Is Earl. According to Nielsen Media Research, an estimated 8.63 million viewers watched the episode. Among adults aged 18 to 49, it earned 4.2/10 ratings share, meaning that it was seen by 4.2 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 10 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of broadcast. The episode reached second place for the night in that demographic, and twenty-fourth for the week among all the major networks. IGN's Brian Zoromski rated \\"The Merger\\" 9 out of 10, an indication of an \\"amazing\\" episode. He called the opening sequence \\"arguably the funniest\\" scene, and believed \\"Andy's proven to be an even better source of hilarity than he ever was in the Stamford office.\\" Zoromski was unhappy however with the \\"outright product placement \\" with Staples, writing that \\"the show's quality felt a little compromised. It's one thing to see blatant product placement in a reality show like Survivor or American Idol but when it invades a great scripted comedy‚Ä¶ well, it kinda drags the show down to the reality level.\\" Doug Elfman of the Chicago Sun-Times thought the episode was \\"funnier than it's been in a while,\\" praising Kelly but criticizing the \\"fat- guy joke.\\" Elfman cited Michael and Andy's new relationship as a positive element. Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A+. Entertainment Weekly columnist Abby West praised Fischer's \\"masterful\\" performance, writing that it \\"really is nice to see Pam coming into her own... And I love that she didn't inhibit herself when Jim walked in ‚Äî she just ran right up and hugged him.\\" West also highlighted Carell and Helms, explaining that with the former, \\"Michael is never completely loathsome ‚Äî because Steve Carell imbues him with such vulnerability.\\" AOL TV writer Michael Sciannamea also enjoyed Helms' performance, believing that \\"the competition between Andy and Dwight will surely make for some classic moments.\\" Sciannamea concluded his review, \\"What makes this show so great is that the supporting players have a chance to shine at the right moments. I thought Stanley's reactions to the whole situation were hysterical, and Creed is just great. He deserves some more airtime.\\" References External links *\\"The Merger\\" at NBC.com Category:The Office (American season 3) episodes Category:2006 American television episodes ","title":"The Merger (The Office)"},{"id":"7659526","text":"The suffix -ane in organic chemistry forms the names of organic compounds where the -C-C- group has been attributed the highest priority according to the rules of organic nomenclature.

Thora was the daughter of Herrau√∞r, the Earl of G√∂taland. Thora in the sagas According to the sagas, Thora lived in a bower in V√§sterg√∂tland (West G√∂taland). Her father gave her a small lindworm that grew into a large serpent and encircled the bower. Her father promised Thora's hand in marriage to any man who could slay the serpent. After divorcing his first wife, the shield-maiden Lagertha, Ragnar wanted to make Thora his wife. He went to the bower, wearing breeches that he had treated with tar and sand to protect his legs from the serpent's poison. It was from these that he gained the epithet Lo√∞br√≥k (which literally means \\"Hairy-Britches\\"). Wielding a spear, Ragnar approached the serpent. It spat poison at him, but the poison could not penetrate Ragnar's shield or breeches. He stuck his spear through the serpent's heart and cut off its head. Thora and Ragnar were then married. According to the Tale of Ragnar's Sons (Ragnarssona √æ√°ttr), Thora and Ragnar had two sons, Eir√≠kr and Agnar.

Written and sung by keyboardist Rick Davies, it is the longest song Supertramp ever recorded clocking in at 16 and a half minutes (surpassing \\"Try Again\\" from their 1970 self titled debut album by more than three minutes). The introduction to the track features a reading from George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, fragments of spoken news reports, and the final lines from the nursery rhyme Oranges and Lemons. An excerpt from \\"The Internationale\\" can also be heard from minute 1:10. The introduction is followed by lyrics that speak about the Cold War that was happening at the time of the recording in 1984. A music video was also produced for the song, which was filmed in the derelict Pan-Pacific Auditorium, starring actor Chris Mulkey. The video was directed by Rene Daalder and aroused controversy due to its graphic violence. This track features drummer Bob Siebenberg's then brother-in-law Scott Gorham of Thin Lizzy on rhythm guitar. The guitar solos throughout the track were performed by Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour who used his own mixing system where he controlled every sound that went from his guitar onto the album. In a 2002 radio interview on Rockline, Davies explained how Gilmour got involved on the title cut: \\"I remember saying to the guys, 'We need to find somebody that can play a bit like Gilmour' for the guitar stuff, and I think it was someone at A&M; \\\\- it might have been Jordan Harris or somebody, one of those guys - and he said, 'Well, I know David - maybe he would like to come over and do it,' and he sent him a demo and he decided he'd like to do it and he was very reasonable.

It is situated near the Yadkin River and is served by U.S. Highway 52 and Old Beatty Ford Road. Gold was found in this small town outside Salisbury in the 19th century. Mining Gold was first discovered in what would become the town of Gold Hill in southeastern Rowan County in 1824. $6 million in gold was mined here prior to the Civil War and a mint was located in Charlotte as a result. In the 1840s, Gold Hill was \\"a raucous mining camp town with a considerable number of saloons and brothels.\\" The Barnhardt shaft, named for Col. George Barnhardt of the Reed Mine (NC State Historic Site) family, was opened in 1842 and reached a depth of 435 feet. The Earnhardt/Randolph Mine Shaft was opened in 1843 across the street from the Barnhardt Mine and reached a depth of 850 feet becoming the deepest gold mine in the United States. The Barnhardt and Randolph mines together were described as \\"the richest and most productive gold mines east of the Mississippi\\". Gold Hill was incorporated in 1843 and had a population of 3000 people and a total of 23 mines in the Gold Hill Mining District. The California Gold Rush and the American Civil War significantly reduced the mining activity. Although some mining occurred in the years following the Civil War a greater resurgence of mining began with the purchase of the Gold Hill Mines and the establishment of 'The New Gold Hill Mining Company' based in London, England. Considerable profits were realized with gold being shipped to England during the period of 1880-1900. Production came to an end by 1915. Tourist attraction The town's first Founders' Day, which was not called by that name, took place in 1989 and was not intended to become an annual event, but it ended up being so popular that a steering committee was formed for the purpose of starting a foundation to find and preserve the town's heritage. The Historic Gold Hill and Mines Foundation, Inc. began in 1992, and that year, a second Founders' Day took place. Gold Hill Mines Historic Park began with a donation of 16 acres by Billie Johnson and was dedicated in 1993; by the 25th Founders' Day it was 70 acres. Founders' Day became an annual event on the fourth Saturday in September, and they were moved from the fire department to the park located at 735 St. Stephens Church Road. E.H.

Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306 (1950), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States set forth the constitutional requirements for notice of judicial proceedings to a potential party under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.. Background Section 100-c of the New York State Banking Law provided for the pooling of small trusts into a large common fund administered by a corporate fiduciary, with the income, expenses, and capital gains and losses shared by the constituent trusts in proportion to their contribution to the common fund. The purpose of this legislation (and similar laws in other states) was to provide corporate fiduciary services to modestly sized trusts which would be too costly to manage individually, promoting economies of scale in the American trust management industry and better risk management for smaller trusts. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co. in New York City was the manager & trustee of one such common trust fund. Facts and procedural history The common trust fund at issue in this case was established on January 17, 1946, and ¬ß100-c provided for an accounting of each fund to be undertaken twelve to fifteen months after the establishment of a fund, and then for every three years thereafter. In March 1947, Central Hanover petitioned the New York Surrogate's Court for a settlement of its first account as common trustee. By this time there were approximately 113 trusts participating in the fund, about half inter vivos trusts and half testamentary trusts, with combined gross capital assets of nearly three million dollars. The only notice of the settlement proceedings required by ¬ß100-c to be given to the trusts' beneficiaries was that after filing such petition for judicial settlement of its account the petitioner shall cause to be issued by the court in which the petition is filed and shall publish not less than once in each week for four successive weeks in a newspaper to be designated by the court a notice or citation addressed generally without naming them to all parties interested in such common trust fund and in such estates, trusts or funds mentioned in the petition, all of which may be described in the notice or citation only in the manner set forth in any related court order and without setting forth the residence of any such decedent or donor of any such estate, trust or fund. When the fund had just been started, however, Central Hanover sent notice by mail of the future proceedings. Subsequent notice in its paper included only the name of the trust, the date of establishment and the estates in the trust. The names of beneficiaries were not included. Appellant Kenneth Mullane was appointed special guardian and attorney for those parties known or unknown who had any interest in the income of the fund, and James N. Vaughan was appointed to represent those parties with interest in the principal. Mullane appeared specially to object to the statutory provision for notice, claiming that it was inadequate to afford the due process required by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Surrogate overruled Mullane's objections, and entered a decree accepting the accounting and terminating any rights the beneficiaries may have had against Central Hanover for mismanagement of the trust. The New York Supreme Court Appellate Division subsequently affirmed, as did the New York Court of Appeals. The U.S. Supreme Court then granted certiorari. Majority opinion Justice Jackson began his examination of the issues of the case by discussing the nature of the jurisdiction which the Surrogate's Court was exercising. He explained some of the differences in the service of process required in in rem, quasi in rem, and in personam actions. Mullane had argued that this was essentially an in personam action, and that the Surrogate could not exercise jurisdiction on out-of-state residents upon whom personal service had not been made. Jackson did not explicitly determine what type of jurisdiction was being exercised here, but held that the Fourteenth Amendment applied to all of them regardless of how the state classified the action. The beneficiaries' property rights were at stake here, and without proper notice, the \\"right to be heard\\" provided by the Fourteenth Amendment was of no practical consequence. Constructive service via newspaper publication, wrote Jackson, was an unreliable method of giving notice, because newspapers have limited circulation and even then, many people do not examine the legal notices, which are usually in small typeface on the back pages. In this case, the legal notice at issue did not even mention the names of the beneficiaries. Furthermore, under normal circumstances, property holders are directly aware of legal proceedings regarding their property, either directly or through a caretaker. But in this case, the caretaker was the beneficiaries' adversary - the trustee itself - which could not be expected to give them reasonable notice, and the special guardian was also not required to give notice. Jackson held that notice must be \\"reasonably calculated\\" to inform known parties affected by the proceedings. Thus, ¬ß100-c(12), the section of the statute which dealt with notice to beneficiaries, was unconstitutional. He further held that notice by publication was acceptable for missing or unknown parties, for those whose whereabouts could not be ascertained by due diligence, and for those whose future interests were too conjectural to be known with any certainty. However, Jackson noted that in many cases, notice to the known parties would help the information of the proceedings to reach those who were unknown by the trustee. Dissent Justice Burton wrote a brief dissent, remarking that since the states created legislation creating the common trust funds, that the decision of what notice was required in such situations should be left to the states.

It is the third-oldest public high school in the state of Maryland and part of the Baltimore City Public Schools. Western High was named a \\"National Blue Ribbon School\\" of Excellence by the U.S. Department of Education in 2009 and a \\"Silver Medal High School\\" by the news magazine U.S. News and World Report in 2012.  History  The Western Female High School was founded in 1844 as one of two \\"twin sisters\\" secondary schools for young ladies in the then 15-year-old Baltimore City Public Schools system, along with the Eastern Female High School. Earlier in 1829, the first four \\"grammar\\" schools (today's elementary schools) were established by the newly organized B.C.P.S., two for boys and two for girls, one in each of the four quadrants of the smaller densely populated city that was Baltimore then. On November 1, 1844, the Western High School officially opened its doors for the first time in the old Armitage Hall located at 100 North Paca Street on the western side of downtown Baltimore, between West Fayette and Lexington Streets. In those two small rented rooms, Robert Kerr, the first principal and sole teacher, welcomed thirty-six young women. Thus began the unique legacy of Western, a pioneer in women's education, along with its companion Eastern High, in the United States. Before the two female high schools were established (as described in the literature of the day, two separate institutions were established in order not to pose an unusual hardship on the young ladies traveling distances through the town), there had been no opportunity for Baltimore girls to get an education beyond the grammar school level. By 1896, a half-century later and several relocations later, W.F.H.S. moved to a new, more expensive building specifically constructed for the girls' high school on Lafayette and McCulloh Streets in the northwestern residential neighborhood of Upton. By this time, the girls had opportunities to take clerical courses. After several other moves, in 1928 the school moved to twin 'H' shaped structure of red brick and limestone trim in an English Tudor / Elizabethan /Jacobethan architecture on Gwynns Falls Parkway,opposite financier George Brown's estate \\"Mondawmin\\" which was replaced by one of the earliest enclosed malls in 1956), which was the duplicate of a similar new building for sister Eastern High in 1938 on 33rd Street and Loch Raven Boulevard. In 1954, the year of the racial integration of the Baltimore City Public Schools, the Gwynns Falls site became the home of Frederick Douglass High School, and WHS moved on again. For the next thirteen years WHS was on the southwest corner of North Howard and West Centre Street in the former Baltimore City College building of 1895‚Äì1928, which had housed the Boys Vocational High School until 1954 when it merged with Samuel Gompers Vocational High School to form Mergenthaler Vocational-Technical High School in a new brick building and campus in 1955 on Hillen Road, facing Lake Montebello in the northeast city. Western's years at the old City College building were crowded and difficult with an additional annex building and no surrounding campus in its near downtown and Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood location. Finally a new modern Western High finally opened in its current location at 4600 Falls Road at the northwest corner with West Cold Spring Lane (just east of the stream Jones Falls which divides the city) in September 1967, sharing a joint, huge, modern campus with the then all-male Baltimore Polytechnic Institute to the west, the city's premier mathematics/science/technology and engineering magnet public high school, previously founded 1883 on little Courtland Street as the Baltimore Manual Training School, and renamed a decade later. The new \\"Poly- Western Complex\\", on the drawing boards for five years, was one of the most expensive and largest high school campuses constructed in America up to that time. For most of its history, Western has been a citywide \\"magnet program\\", officially designated as such in 1975. Students must apply and meet certain entrance criteria. Baltimore Leadership School for Young Women (BLSYW), established in 2009, initially occupied the third floor of Western but moved into its own building in the former Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA downtown center at the northeast corner of Park Avenue and West Franklin Street in the following year. The people of Western High School opposed the idea of BLSYW being housed in that building. The current principal of Western High School is Michelle White.  Academics  Western has a statewide reputation extending back 175 years for academic excellence. Western High offers three academic programs/curriculums: the \\"Accelerated College Preparatory\\" (\\"A Course\\"), \\"College Preparatory\\", and the \\"Teacher Academy\\". Western's most rigorous academic program is the \\"Advanced College Preparatory\\" Program, (\\"The 'A' Course\\"), which was established in 1933 by a joint agreement between Western and the then also all-female Goucher College (formerly located on the 2400 block of St. Paul Street in the Charles Village neighborhood in northern Baltimore City and relocated in the 1950s to the northeast of Towson, the county seat of suburban Baltimore County). Within the \\"Accelerated College Preparatory\\" program, students can finish four years of high school work in grade 9‚Äì11. During their 12th-grade year they are able to pursue advanced placement or college-level courses. Students who graduate from \\"The 'A' Course\\" may enter college or university with \\"advanced standing\\". This rigorous college preparatory program allows students to take honors course in subjects in which they demonstrate strength. The classes of 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 had a 100% four-year college acceptance rate. The W.H.S.'s \\"Teacher Academy\\" offers four classes that prepare students for a career in education. Western also annually produces championship athletic teams and prize-winning performing arts students and sponsors more than 40 different type of clubs, organizations, service groups and publications. In 2012, the news magazine U.S. News and World Report ranked Western High School as 912th nationally and 44th in Maryland as a \\"Silver Medal High School\\". Athletics Western High school's athletics program (the Doves) fields teams in soccer, cross-country, badminton, swimming, lacrosse, dance, tennis, volleyball, basketball, softball and track and field. The Western Doves girls' basketball team won the Maryland public secondary school championships in 1994 and 1995. They were runners-up in the state contests in 1998, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2010. They won 35 or more District IX Baltimore City Championships and have been to State Finals a record 14 times (the most in Maryland history). The Western track and field team are perennial champions, winning multiple city, regional and state championships. They won 29 Baltimore City Indoor/Outdoor Track Championships, 1995-2007(I) 1990‚Äì2005, 2007(O), 27 3A/4A North Regional Indoor/Outdoor Track Championships, 1995-2006(I) 1990‚Äì2004, 2006(O) and three 3A/4A Maryland State Outdoor Track Championships, 2002, 2005‚Äì2006. They were four times the 3A/4A Maryland State Outdoor Track Championship runner-ups: 1998, 1999, 2003, 2004. In 2009 outdoor track season, the Doves took citys, regionals and states, becoming the 2009 Outdoor Track State Champs.

It is the first novel in the Welkin Weasels series. The novel follows a group of anthropomorphised weasels in their quest to restore balance to their home after the disappearance of humans leaves a power vacuum, which has been filled by aggressive stoats. Plot summary The main introduction introduces Sylver's band of outlaws: Icham, Dredless, Mawk, Bryony, Alysoun, Miniver, Wodehed, and Luke. Sylver has heard that the sea defences around the island of Welkin are crumbling and will soon collapse completely, allowing the ocean to flood Welkin if the animals of the island don't act soon. With the help of Lord Haukin, a sympathetic stoat, who understands Sylver, Sylver decides to start out on a quest to find the missing humans who abandoned Welkin long before Sylver was born. None of the weasels know why they have evacuated, but Lord Haukin suspects, thanks to a diary left by a girl called Alice, that they were forced to leave and had no choice. His theory is supported by several clues scattered throughout the island, and the first clue is at Thunder Oak, but the weasels will need to make a long journey to reach it. Just before departure, however, the voyage is interrupted by the Sheriff Falshed, who has been appointed by Prince Poynt to dominate the rebellious weasels and keep them under sway by enslaving them at Castle Rayn. Falshed attempts to stop Sylver, arriving with a troop of stoats, but the outlaws cleverly ward off the attack by using missiles filled with ants, thus driving the stoats into the vast forest. They strap Falshed to a raft and send him off down the river, where, after an interval with the rats, he makes it back to his home, Castle Rayn, home of the stoats. Meanwhile, Lord Haukin tells the weasels that to find Thunder Oak, which does not appear on any of his own maps, they need to find the broken eggshell of an eagle, as eagles fly above the planet and imprint a mental map of the globe which they telepathically pass down to their offspring. The weasels set out to search for this egg, with the stoats in hot pursuit. Prince Poynt has also employs a mercenary fox, Magellan, to hunt down the weasels and bring Sylver to Castle Rayn. After travelling for some while, the outlaws seek shelter at a monastery, which is home to Karnac the boar, a formidable monk and a sadistic mercenary, who sells weasel skins to the stoats in the form of drums. Karnac traps them inside his monastery, intending to wait until they starve to death before skinning them. Sylver sends Miniver out to rally a nearby village of weasels to help them. Miniver is turned down by each weasel in this town, as they fear punishment by the stoats. Hope appears lost until she meets an exceedingly dirty and eccentric weasel named Scirf, who tells her he can help them if she promises than he can join Sylver's outlaws. Miniver returns to the monastery with Scirf, and while her friends are initially sceptical, Scirf drives Karnac away by reminding him that humans loved bacon, ham, and other meat derived from the flesh of pigs. Karnac flees and the weasels reluctantly allow the overconfident Scirf to join them. As they resume travelling with their newest member, the weasels encounter a forest full of savage pine martens, which is also inhabited by a mad witch ‚Äì a moufflon named Maghatch. Maghatch blackmails Sylver into slavery by turning the other outlaws into rabbits, but Sylver escapes and enlists the help of the wild dog Gnaish. Maghatch quickly returns the outlaws to their proper forms and allows them to leave. The weasels journey on, but are ensnared by the Hunter's Hall, which is an afterlife for virtuous hunting animals. The dead hunters tell them that as punishment for killing prey animals intended for those in the afterlife, they must work as slaves in Hunter's Hall until they have atoned for their crime. For several weeks they remain in the Hall until Mawk realises that the ethereal food is keeping them from leaving. Unable to rouse the others, he carries Scirf and escapes. When Scirf awakens, the two males find that Alysoun has followed them, and after Mawk explains the mystery of the food, they try to return and rescue their companions. They find that Hunter's Hall has vanished entirely, being reachable only through Maghatch's sorcery. They decide to backtrack to the witch's cathedral in hopes of finding another way to reach the Hall. Back at Hunter's Hall, Sylver and the others awake to find their friends missing. Fortunately, the dead hunters have decided to set them free, and they head north hoping to meet up with the others. They are soon found by Magellan, who wounds Wodehead with an arrow before disappearing. Sylver sends Wodehead back to Halfmoon Wood along with Icham and Bryony, and goes on towards the Yellow Mountains with Miniver and Dredless. High in the mountains, they meet Magellan once more, and Dredless is killed. Miniver and Sylver escape, and find Falshed's troops, with Falshed having left to report Dredless' death to the Prince. Knowing this would be the last place Magellan would look for them, they pretend to be poor merchants and allow themselves to be captured by the soldiers. Alysoun, Scirf, and Mawk return safely to Maghatch's chapel, and Maghatch sends them down a path which she claims will take them back to Hunter's Hall. Instead, it deposits them directly on a steep mountainside. The three are initially horrified, but Alysoun realises that these are the Yellow Mountains they've been searching for, and that the eagle's nest must be nearby. They ascend the cliffs and by nightfall come upon the nest. Inside they find the eggshell, broken in half, and imprinted with the map of the world. As they prepare to leave, with Alysoun and Scirf carrying half of the eggshell each, the mother eagle returns and attacks them. In the confusion, Alysoun falls from the ledge, but finds that the eggshell acts as a parachute, allowing her to descend safely. Seeing this, Scirf follows, using his half of the shell similarly. Mawk is left behind and takes refuge in a hare's den until the eagle leaves. Continuing on alone, he is confronted and robbed by three weasel brothers. He finds a hostel in the mountains and no sooner has he entered than Magellan arrives. Mawk hides himself and listens as Magellan takes a room for the night. Shortly after, Falshed's troops arrive, with Sylver and Miniver in tow, still pretending to be merchants. Sylver recognises him and, trying to keep his identity secret, tells the soldiers that Mawk is one of the outlaws. Mawk tells the soldiers that he knows where Sylver is sleeping, and directs them to Magellan's room. The stoats storm the room and in the ensuing fight, Mawk, Sylver, and Miniver escape into the mountains, where they find Scirf, by himself. Meanwhile, having been separated from Scirf in the fall from the mountain, Alysoun finds herself in the midst of a group of hedgehogs performing a ceremony. The leader of the hedgehogs refuses to let Alysoun leave, intending her as a sacrifice to their god, the Great God Spike, a huge hedgehog built from the skeletons of other animals. Alysoun succeeds in destroying the god and escapes. She returns to Halfmoon Wood with her half of the eggshell, where Sylver and the others are already waiting, and there learns of Dredless' death. After holding a wake for Dredless, the weasels and Lord Haukin decipher the eggshell map and discover that the first clue is hidden in a tree called Thunder Oak, far from Halfmoon Wood. The weasels draw straws to see who will accompany Sylver to the Thunder Oak, and Mawk and Scirf are selected. Before they can begin the journey, a pack of rogue wolves lays siege to the village, but are driven away by a living statue that is seeking Scirf. The statue travels a short distance with the three weasels, hoping to find the quarry from which it was made. They come to an old abandoned church, where the gargoyles tell the statue where to find a nearby quarry. Sylver and his companions enter the church to rest for the night, but after a noisy interruption by living angel statues, Sylver and Scirf decide to sleep in the crypts rather than the church hall. Mawk is alarmed by the idea of sleeping amidst the dead bodies, so he stays above. He awakes the following morning and finds Sylver and Scirf missing from the crypts. After a brief search he finds the two have been kidnapped by a group of mole bandits. The moles prepare to attack him, but their leader, realising that Sylver is wanted by Prince Poynt, insists that they set the weasels free. As they continue on, the group sneaks through the marshes inhabited by the rats, only to find their way blocked by thousands of living scarecrows. The scarecrows demand that the weasels give them smoking pipes, so that they might look more like humans. Having nothing to give them, Mawk suggests they travel to a nearby abbey and ask the monks for help. From the head monk they learn that the scarecrows are terrified of mirrors, and return to the scarecrows with mirrors in hand. The scarecrows are so distraught by their reflections that they fall to the ground screaming, and the weasels pass unharmed. Upon reaching the Thunder Oak, the weasels find the tree guarded by a stone gryphon, which will not allow them to pass, saying it does not wish for the humans to return. To the surprise of his companions, Scirf hypnotises the gryphon, putting it to sleep, and the weasels enter the Thunder Oak. Inside they find a small carving of a dormouse in a pool of water. Giving the carving to Mawk to guard, they begin to retrace their steps to Halfmoon Wood. On the return home, Sylver receives a warning from a polecat, sent by Falshed, that Magellan is laying in wait in the forest, and, ordering Mawk and Scirf to wait for him, goes to face the fox alone. While attempting to ambush Magellan, Sylver is caught in a snare set by the bounty hunter. Magellan prepares to kill Sylver with his bow and arrow, but in a final burst of energy, Sylver pulls the iron stake holding the snare from the ground and impales Magellan with it. Mawk and Scirf find him badly injured, but alive, and together they finish the journey back to Halfmoon Wood. After showing the carving to Lord Haukin, the Welkin Weasels hold a celebration before commencing on the quest to find the next clue. The book ends with a brief exchange between Falshed and Poynt, regarding Magellan's death. Major characters =Weasels= * Sylver ‚Äì The brave and compassionate young leader of the outlaws. He is identified by a white lightning bolt-shaped mark across one side of his face. * Icham ‚Äì Sylver's closest friend and fellow outlaw. * Dredless ‚Äì A fearless male weasel; expert shot with darts. He is killed by Magellan in the mountains. * Mawk ‚Äì A doubting but innovative male weasel. * Bryony ‚Äì A very outspoken but sensitive female.

Haukin has a deep fondness for objects made of glass, and as such his rooms are full of various bottles fashioned by humans. * Prince Poynt ‚Äì The spoiled and fickle Prince of Welkin. He dismisses Sylver's warning that the levees are breaking and views the outlaws as a threat to his reign. Unlike the other stoats, his fur is always pure white, as he thinks white is a more royal colour; thus other stoats are forbidden from turning white in the winter. He is almost always complaining of being too cold. * Sheriff Falshed ‚Äì The Prince's obedient and long-suffering sheriff, who is constantly at odds with Sylver and his outlaws, and frequently being punished by the Prince for failing to capture them. He is readily identified by other characters by a large burn mark on his chest, which he received in a fight with Sylver before the beginning of the book. =Other animals= * Karnac ‚Äì A vain, obese male wild boar who imprisons the Welkin Weasels with the intent of skinning them to make drums. * Magellan ‚Äì A sadistic male fox.

He directs Sylver to the dog Gnaish to seek help. * Kinger ‚Äì Leader of the mole bandits. * Malach, Riach, and Silach ‚Äì Three of a large group of ferrets employed by Prince Poynt. Puns, references, and literary allusions * The overall situation of Sylver's band ‚Äì living as outlaws in the woodlands, battling against a villainous prince and his corrupt sheriff ‚Äì is reminiscent of the story of Robin Hood. * The name Miniver comes from a word referring to white fur from a stoat, used to line the clothes of royalty. The term is also used in certain parts of England to refer to particularly small weasels. * The name Mawk comes from a Middle English word meaning \\"excessively sentimental,\\" reflecting the character's melodramatic personality. * Scirf makes reference to a figure named Aristoatle, a play on the words stoat and Aristotle. * The death of Poynt's brother King Redfur and the surrounding circumstances are based on that of William Rufus.

He attended Yale University and served as the first head football coach at the University of Michigan in 1891. He also coached at the University of Wisconsin (1892), Baker University (1892), the University of Nebraska (1893‚Äì1894), and the University of Texas (1895). He later had a long career as a lawyer in Nebraska and France. He was a professor of law at Creighton College of Law from 1906 to 1913. Early years Crawford was born in 1870 at Colebrook, New Hampshire. He was the son of Francis B. Crawford, a starch manufacturer and state legislator, and Susan J. (Randall) Crawford.1880 United States Census; Census Place: Colebrook, Coos, New Hampshire; Roll: 762; Family History Film: 1254762; Page: 31A; Enumeration District: 31; Image: 0063.United States Passport Applications by Frank Crawford dated December 22, 1919 and December 14, 1921 identifies his father as Francis B. Crawford and his date of birth as March 12, 1870 in Colebrook, New Hampshire. He attended preparatory school at St. Johnsbury Academy in St. Johnsbury, Vermont. He enrolled at Yale University, receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1891. Sources are at odds over whether or not Crawford played football for the Yale Bulldogs football team. According to the University of Nebraska web site, Crawford was \\"a member of the dominant Yale teams of the mid-1880s.\\" The Michigan Daily also reported that Crawford played football at Yale \\"for several years.\\" However, the University of Michigan web site notes that \\"Yale archivists found no evidence that he played varsity football\\" and concludes that Crawford \\"may have played some football while a Bulldog, but definitely did not win a varsity letter.\\" Coaching career =Michigan= After graduating from Yale, Crawford enrolled at the University of Michigan School of Law, receiving his law degree in 1893. As a first-year law student, Crawford was both the unpaid coach and a substitute player for the 1891 Michigan Wolverines football team. He helped lead the team to a 4‚Äì5 record. He has been identified by several sources as the first football coach in University of Michigan history.(\\"He [Crawford] was the first football coach in University of Michigan history and he was unpaid.\\")(\\"Frank Crawford first coach of a Michigan football team and captain of the baseball team\\") Other sources indicate that Crawford and Mike Murphy were the joint head coaches of the 1891 Michigan football team. Others state that Murphy relinquished the coaching duties to Crawford midway through the season to allow him to focus on his duties as trainer. The Chicago Daily Tribune reported in November 1891 that the Michigan team was \\"coached systematically\\" by Murphy, Crawford, Horace Greely Prettyman and James Duffy. While attending Michigan, Crawford also played for the Michigan Wolverines baseball team in 1892 and 1893. He led the team with a .976 fielding average in 1892. Crawford appeared in 17 games at catcher and left field for the Wolverines in 1892 and was among the team's leaders in runs (tied for 2nd with 20), stolen bases (tied for 2nd with 13) and putouts (2nd with 115). He was also selected as the captain of the 1893 baseball team. In his history of the University of Michigan, Wilfred Byron Shaw cites Crawford's hiring as a watershed moment in the history of the school's football program: \\"A new era in the history of football at Michigan began in 1891, when with a fair schedule and an experienced coach, Frank Crawford (Yale, '91), '93l, the systematic development of a team began ...\\" Although football had been played at Michigan without a coaching staff since 1879, the Associated Press noted at the time of Crawford's death that Crawford \\"is credited with introducing football at the University of Michigan in 1891.\\" =Wisconsin= In 1892, he coached at University of Wisconsin and compiled a 4‚Äì3 record. =Baker= In November 1892, Crawford served as \\"a paid coach- captain player\\" for the football team at Baker University at Baldwin, Kansas. Crawford reportedly \\"brought many innovations,\\" including the training table, to Baker's football program. He led Baker to the Kansas state championship and a 2‚Äì1 record in \\"the triangular league,\\" including victories over Washburn (44‚Äì0) and Kansas (18‚Äì0). In December 1892, the Leavenworth Times reported that Crawford had \\"succeeded in instilling sufficient foot ball lore into the western farmers to accomplish the defeat of the University of Kansas team by the Baker eleven last week.\\" In May 1893, The Baker Beacon reported: \\"The Baker team was ably coached and captained by Frank Crawford who had learned the game at Yale and by the close of the season the team ... was in excellent condition.\\" =Nebraska= In 1893, Crawford was hired as the head football coach at the University of Nebraska. He was the school's first paid head football coach with a salary of approximately $500. He was Nebraska's head football coach during the 1893 and 1894 seasons and compiled a 9‚Äì4‚Äì1 record. After starting the 1893 season with a 2‚Äì2‚Äì1 record, Crawford's team defeated Iowa, 20‚Äì18, in a match played in near-blizzard conditions and considered the \\"first major victory\\" in Nebraska history. Crawford reportedly also played right halfback and kicked the field goals for Nebraska during the 1893 Iowa game; he was identified in the record book as \\"Frank.\\" In 1894, Crawford's team defeated Iowa, 36‚Äì0. The 1895 team finished the season with five consecutive victories for a 7‚Äì2 record and the school's first ever conference championship. During Crawford's tenure at Nebraska, George Flippin played for Crawford and became the first African-American athlete in Nebraska history. However, in 1893, Flippin was voted team captain by the team, but this decision was vetoed by Crawford, stating: \\"It takes a man with brains to be a captain; all there is to Flippin is brute force.\\" Flippin went on to be a well-respected physician in Polk County, Nebraska and the first African- American inducted into the Nebraska Football Hall of Fame.http://journalstar.com/news/local/mckee-george-flippin-physician-and- football- hero/article_6ee2bf06-a58c-5205-84cf-3a09e06f4501.htmlhttp://www.omaha.com/living/nebraskan- publishes-book-on-george-flippin-nu-s-first- black/article_98d7f8fa-5ace-11e4-9900-001a4bcf6878.html =Texas= In 1894, the University of Texas football team suffered its first loss in school history, a 28‚Äì0 home loss to Missouri. The previous head coach was fired, and a lengthy search was conducted for a replacement. In October 1895, Texas hired Crawford. At Texas, he was known as \\"Little\\" Crawford and reportedly \\"taught the Yale system of play and stressed conditioning.\\" Crawford led the 1895 Longhorns to a perfect 5‚Äì0 record, as the team outscored its opponents by a combined 96‚Äì0 margin. After a Thanksgiving Day victory over San Antonio by a score of 38‚Äì0, Crawford reportedly left for Mexico to watch bullfights and then returned to his home in Nebraska. The 1895 season was Crawford's last as a football coach. Legal and teaching career Crawford as law professor at Creighton, 1909. In 1893, Crawford opened a law practice with Albert Jefferis in Omaha, Nebraska. Jefferis was a classmate and teammate with Crawford on the baseball and football teams at the University of Michigan and later served in the United States House of Representatives. In 1901, Crawford formed a law partnership in Omaha under the name Crawford & Clarke with Henry Teft Clarke, Jr., a former Major League Baseball pitcher. Crawford joined the faculty of Creighton University School of Law in 1906 where he remained until 1913.The twelfth general catalogue of the Psi Upsilon Fraternity, by Psi Upsilon Fraternity, 1917, p. 158. He taught classes in evidence and public service companies. From the end of World War I until the outbreak of World War II, Crawford practiced law in France, first in Paris and later in Nice. Family and death Crawford was married to Hannah Louise McNair, a descendant of four colonial governors. Crawford and his wife moved to France in the mid-1920s and to New York City in the early 1940s. His wife died in September 1943 at the French Hospital in New York City. In November 1963, Crawford died at a hospital in Portland, Maine at age 93.

The movie premiered in August 1972 in Los Angeles, but was withdrawn within a few weeks because of lacking public acceptance. Although it was called \\"very benign\\" by the US rating administration, it received an X rating. It remained controversial ever since, due to some lengthy full nudity scenes of teenage and preteen boys. Synopsis The plot of the movie is non-chronological, as it attempts to mimick the spontaneity of juvenile thinking, and thus at first sight may appear convoluted and rather loose. The story is about eight students of an International School in Rome, who follow a want ad placed by some mysterious man: 'Wanted: boys to act in a play, to be performed before God.' This leads them to a splendid cove at the Palinuro natural arch in southern Italy, where in the beginning they appear overwhelmed by a sensation of paradisiacal ease and freedom. In this initial stage, most of the nudity scenes appear (about six minutes, distributed over the first half hour). No sexual innuendos are involved; rather, these scenes are presented as a sort of dream-like 'sacred dance' (see below). In the course of the following days, as problems come up, clothing is more and more restored, and finally the group divides, with five of the boys abandoning their play and three of them staying. In the course of the 'play', the boys adventure into diverse, sometimes bizarre, actions, to overcome growing 'boredom, hunger and homesickness' (as their problems are diagnosed by one of them) and also fear.  Religion in the film  As to judge from some of the books he has written,eg. The Black Swan, The Divine Spark -- see Aikman's website author and director Anthony Aikman (1942-2011) appears to have been a deeply religious person, albeit not in the sense of a specific religious denomination. Apart from the text of the ad, also the very last sentences of the film expose it as a religious parable: 'Your play before God is completed.' ‚àí 'In the beginning there was God, but then man created God in his own image.' The 'sacred dance' scenes can evoke allusions to Psalm 126.Comment on IMDb page In addition, here and only here the music switches to church music of various origins (plainsong, church bells, Russian orthodox). Less directly, the religious character is also evidenced by the themes of fear, confidence and coming home, which play an important role.  Nakedness in the film  The nudity scenes sum up to about an eighth of the length of the movie. The 'sacred dance' scenes of the beginning of their 'play' make extensive use of slow-motion and cross-fading (presumably as a means of demonstrating a mental state of feeling relieved instead of a development or action), by which nakedness is often blurred. Inspecting the film shows that the 'closeup shots of the pelvic area' put forward by the rating administration do not exist in a strict sense: bringing the pelvic area into picture is not fully avoided, yet never centered, never really closeup, but always casually.  Third part of a trilogy  Most helpful for understanding the film, may be looking upon it as the third part of a trilogy in the following sense. On Aikman's own homepage (apparently no longer maintained, but still available) there is noted 'often compared to Lord of the Flies', and in fact, the movie contains lots of allusions, mostly formal, to this work. This other classic, filmed after the famous novel by William Golding just 10 years before The Genesis Children, refers in turn quite explicitly to the R. M. Ballantyne novel The Coral Island, from the mid-19th century. In all three cases, the theme is the acting of a group of (male) kids, left alone on some island or shore (i.e. deprived of a direct civilized environment, and set out in a purely natural setting), with an undertone of investigating where evil comes from or how it is overcome. But while in Ballantyne's novel, the point of view is clearly optimistic in the colonial sense common in the 19th century ('obsessed with the purity of God, Trade and the Nation, and written for the future rulers of the world', The Coral Island), Golding decidedly destroys the optimistic world-view of a self-proclaimed master-race. In his story, which - like that of Ballantyne - still features dominance, struggle and victory or defeat, these impulses (combined with a constantly failing communication) do not create an ever growing sphere of ordered civilisation, but lead into complete destruction within the shortest possible time. Here, Aikman's film appears as a response to Golding's 'solution', with the purpose of featuring less crude impulses than dominance or struggle and victory. There is never aggression in the sense of struggling for dominance between these children. In sharp contrast to Goldings kids, whose first common acting consists in choosing a 'chief', the Genesis Children practise at least for the first half of their story a fully cooperative way of living with astonishing ease and great naturalness. It appears that Aikman wants to show that this way of living is endangered in the first place in a more subtle way ‚àí 'boredom, hunger and homesickness were our enemies, and that's why we started to argue.' Instead of aggression, it is a feeling of futility with regard to the quest for 'home' (which of course, like hunger, also touches the spiritual sphere) by some of the boys, which finally divides the group. Here comes what may be seen as the central sentence of the film: 'Aren't you going home?' asks one of those who are about to leave the place and the play. 'I am home', replies his friend who is going to stay. Rating The MPAA film classification database lists an X rating for the film. MPAA ratings database search on main page Aaron Stern, director of MPAA's code and rating administration stated 'The Genesis Children is really a very benign film. It was only the cumulative amount of nudity and the closeup shots of the pelvic area that brought about the X decision. Even the violence of the scene in which the boys attack the bus is well within the R category.'Swisher, Viola Hegyi: \\"Generating The Genesis Children\\", After Dark, September 1972, p. 18 External links Anthony Aikman's Official Website See also * List of American films of 1972 References Category:1972 films Category:American coming-of-age films Category:1972 drama films Category:American independent films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American drama films Category:Films scored by Jerry Styner Category:Films set in the Mediterranean Sea Category:Films set on beaches ","title":"The Genesis Children"},{"id":"7660111","text":"Khabikki Lake () is a salt water lake, in the Soan Sakaser Valley in the southern Salt Range area in Khushab District, Punjab, Pakistan.

It was adapted from \\"Stranglehold\\", a story which screenwriter Jan Read had written specially for Boris Karloff, and was shot back to back with producer Richard Gordon's Fiend Without a Face, with both later being released as a double feature by MGM.Stephen Jacobs, Boris Karloff: More Than a Monster, Tomahawk Press 2011, p. 410-412 Plot In Victorian era-London, Edward Styles is accused of being the notorious Haymarket Strangler, the brutal killer of five women. Twenty years afterward, he is tried and executed for these crimes. James Rankin (Karloff), a novelist and social reformer, launches an investigation to prove that Styles was innocent. His search for clues leads him first to the sleazy Judas Hole music hall, where the Strangler picked his victims from the resident can-can dancers and loose women, and then to the prison cemetery of Newgate where Styles was buried ‚Äì in order to exhume his body. When the killings start again, Rankin's theory seems to be vindicated. However, his growing obsession with the case signals a most unwelcome revelation as to the true identity of the murderer.TCM.comThe Criterion Channel Cast * Boris Karloff as James Rankin * Jean Kent as Cora Seth * Elizabeth Allan as Barbara Rankin * Anthony Dawson as Superintendent Burk * Vera Day as Pearl * Tim Turner as Dr. Kenneth McColl * Diane Aubrey as Lily Rankin * Max Brimmell as Newgate Prison Turnkey * Leslie Perrins as Newgate Prison Governor * Jessica Cairns as Asylum Maid * Dorothy Gordon as Hannah * Desmond Roberts as Dr. Johnson Production The film was originally going to be called Stranglehold and was written by Jan Read, a friend of Boris Karloff's. He gave the script to producer Richard Gordon, who was looking to make a horror movie in the U.K. Gordon set up Amalgamated Productions with Charles Vetters and had started providing U.S. funding and talent for eight pictures shot in Britain. Amalgamated went into partnership with British producer John Croydon and negotiated a deal with distributor Eros Films who agreed to guarantee 70% of the film's budget after delivery of the final product.

MGM picked up both films for release. Gordon later estimated the cost of the two movies together was approximately ¬£80,000 exclusive of the costs of imported American stars. Read's script was rewritten by John Croydon, who brought in the idea of making the killer a Jack the Ripper-style murderer and having the transformation be physical (in the original draft, Rankin was only possessed by the killer's spirit). The film was shot in Walton Studios in Surrey. Karloff was paid $27,500 for four weeks, with an option to make a second film for Amalgamated.Tom Weaver, The Horror Hits of Richard Gordon, Bear Manor Media 2011, p. 26-40 Executive producer Richard Gordon and interviewer Tom Weaver talk about the making of The Haunted Strangler on the audio commentary of the Criterion DVD, available as part of the 2007 box set Monsters and Madmen. Reception According to MGM records, this film and Fiend Without a Face together earned $350,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $300,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit to the studio of $160,000.

From centuries past, they have maintained business houses in Lhasa, Shigatse, Gyantse and other towns in Tibet and in Kalimpong and Kolkata in India moving goods by mule caravan over the Himalayan passes. The merchants used two trade routes to travel to Tibet. One went north from Kathmandu and crossed the Himalaya at Kuti (now known as Nyalam) or Kyirong, also spelt Gyirong. The other route started at KalimpongKalimpong. New Delhi: Nest & Wings. . Page 20. and passed through Nathula or Jelepla on the Sikkim-Tibet border. These trade routes are offshoots of the ancient Silk Road. Textiles and other factory products were the main exports to Tibet while they brought back wool, musk pods, hides and yak tails. This traditional business came to an end in the mid-1960s after the route through Sikkim was shut down following the 1962 Sino-Indian War, and all the Tuladhar traders returned home. In the course of conducting trade, they have been a cultural bridge between South and Central Asia. Today, while they are still primarily merchants, many pursue varied professions.

Early life Richard Windeyer was born in London, the eldest of nine children of Charles Windeyer, first recognised reporter in the House of Lords, and his wife Ann Mary, n√©e Rudd. Richard's parents and family went to Sydney in 1828, intending to go on the land, and obtained a grant of . Charles Windeyer however, accepted the position of chief clerk in the police office and afterwards became a police magistrate at Sydney. In 1842, Charles was the first Mayor of Sydney. In 1843 Charles Windeyer was an unsuccessful candidate at the first election for the New South Wales Legislative Council, and retired from his magistracy at the end of 1848 with a pension. Richard Windeyer remained in London and like his father before him became a parliamentary reporter. Richard Windeyer was employed on The Times and other newspapers. On 26 April 1832 Richard Windeyer married Maria n√©e Camfield and their only child, William Charles Windeyer, was born on 29 September 1834. Windeyer studied law and was admitted as a barrister to the Middle Temple in 1834. Windeyer was advised by his father to travel to New South Wales and on 28 November 1835 arrived in Sydney where he built up a large practice as a barrister. In 1838 Windeyer, along with William Foster and William √† Beckett, defended the 11 colonists charged with murder in relation to the Myall Creek massacre. By 1840 he was one of the leaders at the bar and had made a reputation especially in nisi prius work. In 1838 he bought land in the Hunter Valley, and by 1842 he held about and spent large amounts on draining extensive swamp lands in the vicinity of Grahamstown (near Raymond Terrace and building a homestead at Tomago. Windeyer planted thirty acres (12 ha) of vines and made his first wine in 1845. He also raised cattle, horses and pigs and experimented with sugar-cane and wheat. Parliamentary career At the first election for the New South Wales Legislative Council held in July 1843, Windeyer was elected for the County of Durham and soon brought in a measure, the Monetary Confidence Bill, designed to relieve the economic depression at the time. In spite of brilliant speeches in opposition to it made by Robert Lowe the bill was carried by 14 votes to seven; however, it was vetoed by the governor, Sir George Gipps, and nothing more was heard of it. Windeyer supported free trade and worked to remove duties on the export of New South Wales tobacco to Van Diemen's Land and wheat to the United Kingdom, but supported an import duty of 1 shilling a bushel on foreign wheat on the basis that it would be a revenue not a protective duty. In October 1844 Windeyer moved an amendment to a Bill proposing to bring in Lord Stanley's system of national education, to the effect that primary education should be established for the poor 'gratuitously if necessary' and to allow government aid for denominational schools in some circumstances. In 1845 Windeyer, though almost overwhelmed with work, took up the cause of the already fast-dwindling aborigines and obtained a select committee to inquire into the question. He was also in the forefront of the struggle with Gipps concerning generally the powers of the council and the governor on the land question, and in 1846 moved and carried an address to the governor acquainting him that the council could not entertain a Bill he had originated. Windeyer promoted a Libel Act passed 1847, that required that publication of libel could only be justified if it was both true and in the public interest. Late life and legacy Windeyer had become financially involved in the long-continued depression and, although he had made a large income at the bar, was obliged to assign his estate. He died on 2 December 1847 while on a visit to friends at Launceston, Tasmania, the result of anxiety and overwork and an internal disease. Windeyer had a great reputation at the bar as an advocate of much power and ability, and during his short career in parliament showed himself to be a strong and conscientious man. He was a great advocate for representative government and when he died William Wentworth declared he \\"had lost his right hand man\\". His early death robbed Australia of a man who might have done his country much service, and reached almost any position in it. Descendants He had one child, William Charles Windeyer, who would become Attorney General of NSW (twice, briefly), a Justice of the Supreme Court of NSW and 6th Chancellor of the University of Sydney. His grandson, Richard Windeyer, would become a King's Counsel and Acting Justice of the Supreme Court of NSW. His great- grandson, Victor Windeyer would become a Justice of the High Court of Australia between 1958 and 1972, and would be appointed to the Privy Council in 1963. Another descendant, William Victor Windeyer, would also become a President of the Law Society of New South Wales and a Justice of the Supreme Court of NSW.https://cld.bz/bookdata/NowxmPo/basic-html/page-74.html# References Category:1806 births Category:1847 deaths Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Council Category:Port Stephens Council Category:Australian people of English descent Category:19th-century Australian politicians ","title":"Richard Windeyer"},{"id":"7660272","text":"Thomas Gawthrop \\"Doggie\\" Trenchard (May 3, 1874 ‚Äì October 16, 1943)International Genealogical Index - North America was an All-American football player at Princeton University in 1893 and a college football head coach at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of Pittsburgh, and West Virginia University.

She is the first of the MEKO 360 general purpose frigates built by the German Blohm + Voss company of Hamburg. The ship is the largest in the Nigerian Navy. As a general purpose frigate, Aradu has capabilities for anti-air, anti- surface and anti-submarine warfare effectively, and participated in the 200th anniversary celebrations of the Battle of Trafalgar. The ship also possesses capability for naval fire support and electronic warfare. Additionally, she carries a ship-borne helicopter for anti-submarine warfare, search and rescue, and enhanced surveillance/detection. Design and description The first of the MEKO 360 type frigates, Aradu was constructed using modular prefabrication and containerised weapons and sensors. The first frigate to be built in this manner, this allowed for speedier construction time. The ship measures at the waterline and overall with a beam of and a draught of . The frigate's full load displacement is . The ship is powered by a CODOG system made up of two Rolls-Royce Olympus TM3B gas turbines rated at giving the ship a maximum speed of during use and two MTU Type V 956 TH92 diesel engines rated at with a maximum speed of under use. The engines turn two Kamewa controllable pitch propellers and the vessel carries of fuel. This gives the frigate a range of at , with an endurance of 90 days.Saunders (2009), p. 564.Gardiner, Chumbley & Budzbon, p. 286. The ship is armed with eight Otomat Mk 1 ship-to-ship missiles carried amidships with four situated behind the mast and forward the twin funnels and two each amidships on each side of the ship. The vessel is also armed with twenty-four Aspide surface-to-air missiles in an octuple launcher mounted atop the hangar. Aradu is armed with one OTO Melara Otobreda 127/54 Compact gun mounted forward and four twin-mounted Bofors 40 mm guns situated forward behind the 5-inch gun and to either side of the hangar. Aradu also has six STWS-13 torpedo tubes in two triple mounts located amidships on either side of the ship and one depth charge rack. Aradu is equipped with Plessey AWS 5 air/surface search radar, Racal Decca 1226 navigation radar, Signaal STIR and WM 25 fire control radar and Atlas Elektronik hull-mounted sonar. The ship originally mounted PHS 32 sonar, but this was later replaced.Couhat, p. 358. The frigate mounts two chaff dispensers and Decca RDL-2 electronic support measures. The ship has a hangar and flight deck capable of operation two helicopters of the Westland Lynx Mk.89 type, but usually only carries one. The vessel has a complement of 195, including 26 officers. Construction and history The need to have a modern sophisticated frigate to complement and eventually replace Nigerian Navy's long serving frigate, NNS Nigeria (later renamed Obuma) became apparent to naval planners in the mid-1970s. NNS Nigeria was fast becoming irrelevant in the fast changing world of naval technology. The Nigerian Navy needed to reach blue waters with the appropriate ships in terms of firepower, extended operational range and enhanced surveillance capability. The MEKO 360 frigate became the answer to these aspirations. The ship initially named Republic was ordered on 3 November 1977 from Blohm + Voss. Her keel was laid down at Hamburg, West Germany on 1 December 1978 and she was launched on 25 January 1980. On 1 November of the same year, following a new policy of the Nigerian Navy, the frigate was renamed Aradu meaning \\"thunder\\". The ship was deemed completed on 4 September 1981. Aradu sailed from its shipyard and arrived at Lagos on 21 December 1981 and was commissioned on 22 February 1982. Since she entered naval service, NNS Aradu has taken part in major naval exercises, fleet reviews and diplomatic cruises. She played a prominent part in \\"Operation Seadog\\" in 1985 and \\"Operation Odion\\" in 1987. In 1987, Aradu ran aground twice and was involved in a major collision. The frigate underwent a significant refit in 1991 at Wilmont Point, Lagos with Blohm + Voss aid, lasting until 1994.Saunders (2004), p. 510. The ship has undertaken extensive diplomatic visits to countries like Gabon, Congo, Zaire, Equatorial Guinea and numerous European countries. She has also participated in joint exercises with visiting ships of the German, Indian, French and the Brazilian navies. Aradu ran aground again early in 1994 during post refit trials, and was assessed as beyond economical repair in 1995, but then managed to go to sea again in early 1996, and again in 1997 when she broke down for several months in Monrovia, Liberia. She then steamed back to Lagos on one engine in 1998. Aradu was refitted, refurbished and equipped after being alongshore for over twelve years. The ship proved it was still seaworthy by taking part in celebrations commemorating the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar by sailing to Great Britain in August 2005 to join 100 warships from 36 navies. The frigate also participated in two major exercises in 2005 and 2006, called \\"Igbochi\\" and \\"Idabo\\". During the Second Liberian Civil War, Aradu patrolled Liberian waters, showing the flag. In a bid to strengthen Nigeria/Brazil military cooperation, two naval ships, Aradu and Nwamba, departed Nigeria on 3 August 2007 to take part in Brazil BiCentenary Celebrations. The ships arrived in Monrovia, Liberia, on 9 August. They were received by the Chief of Defense Staff of Liberia, Major General Abdurahman of the Nigerian Army. From there, they sailed to Recife before entering Rio de Janeiro for the celebrations. By 2017, the condition of Aradu was reported as \\"deplorable\\" and the Nigerian Navy stated that over 250 million dollars were required to make the ship seaworthy. As the Nigerian Navy did not have the funds to make such an investment, Aradu remains dockside.  2019‚Äì2020  In late 2019, photographs of Aradu surfaced online which shows the frigate is undergoing a refit at the Naval Dockyard limited in Victoria Island, Lagos. In the photographs, metal sheets were being welded on the lower part of the ship's hull. Also, according to an article published by Military Africa on February 6, 2020, Aradu will be made operational during or before the end of 2020. Furthermore, the report also suggests that Aradu will not be fully refitted for combat operations due to the age and obsolescence of its weapons, fire control and navigational systems, but will now undertake a new mission as a combat training ship for Nigeria's new general-purpose frigate valued at $350 million, expected to be delivered in the coming years.african military blog  Notes Citations References  * External links * Minor Navies of the World (Aradu photo) Category:Frigates of Nigeria Category:1980 ships Category:Meko 360-class frigates of the Nigerian Navy Category:Ships built in Hamburg ","title":"NNS Aradu"},{"id":"7660369","text":"Riviera Hotel or Hotel Riviera may refer to: ;in Ukraine * Hotel Riviera, Kyiv, Ukraine ;in Cuba *Hotel Habana Riviera, Havana, Cuba ;in England * Riviera Hotel, Bowleaze Cove, Dorset ;in Spain *Hotel Riviera (Ibiza) ;in Lebanon *Riviera Hotel Beirut ;in the United States * Riviera Hotel (Hot Springs, Arkansas), listed on the NRHP in Garland County, Arkansas * Riviera (hotel and casino), on the Las Vegas Strip * Riviera Hotel in Palm Springs, California ","title":"Riviera Hotel"},{"id":"7660385","text":"First Man into Space (working title: Satellite of Blood) is an independently made 1959 British-AmericanCriterion CollectionTCM.comBFI black-and-white science fiction-horror film produced by John Croydon, Charles F. Vetter, and Richard Gordon for Amalgamated Films. It was directed by Robert Day and stars Marshall Thompson, Marla Landi, Bill Edwards, and Robert Ayres. The film is based on a story by Wyott Ordung, while the plot was developed from a script that had been pitched to and rejected by AIP. First Man into Space was distributed by MGM. Plot U. S. Navy Commander Charles \\"Chuck\\" Prescott (Marshall Thompson) is unsure if his brother, Lt. Dan Prescott (Edwards), is the right choice for piloting the high altitude, rocket-powered Y-13. Air Force Space Command's Captain Ben Richards (Robert Ayres) insists that Dan is their best pilot, even though when piloting the Y-12 in the ionosphere, he began experiencing difficulties. Dan ignored flight regulations upon landing by seeing his girlfriend (Marla Landi) rather than filing his flight report. Captain Richards, however, insists that Dan pilot the Y-13 after being checked out and briefed by Dr. Paul von Essen (Carl Jaffe). At 600,000 feet, Dan is supposed to level off the Y-13 and begin his descent, but he continues to climb, firing his emergency boost for more speed. He climbs to 1,320,000 feet (250 miles) and loses control while passing through a dense cloud of unknown material, forcing him to eject. The New Mexico State Police report that a Mexican farmer spotted a parachute land south of Alvarado, New Mexico. Chief Wilson (Bill Nagy) meets Commander Prescott near the wreckage; the automatic pilot escape mechanism and braking chute operated perfectly. An unknown rock- like material has encased the Y-13's fuselage; testing shows that it is completely impervious to X-rays, infrared, and ultraviolet light. Later that night, a wheezing \\"creature\\" breaks into Alameda's New Mexico State Blood Bank, brutally murdering one of the blood bank's nurses; the thing then proceeds to drink vast quantities of blood. The next day, a newspaper headline reads \\"Terror Roams State\\" and tells of brutal and inhuman slaughtering of cattle on a farm next to the crash site. Both the dead cattle and the blood bank nurse show similar wounds. When Chuck and Chief Wilson examine the nurse's body, Chuck notices shiny specks around the wounds, as well as on the blood bank door. They see the same specks on the necks of the dead cattle; they also find a high-altitude oxygen lead from the Y-13. Chuck suspects that the killings may have something to do with the crashed Y-13 and requests that Wilson send sample specks to Dr. von Essen at Aviation Medicine. The next day, test results show that they are particles of meteor dust and show no signs of structural damage from passage through the atmosphere. Later, Dr. von Essen explains the results to Chuck: Wherever the encrustation occurs on the Y-13 fuselage, the metal is intact. In places not encrusted, the metal has been transformed into a brittle, carbon-like substance, easily reduced to powder. Chuck theorizes that the covering may be some sort of \\"cosmic protection\\". Three more killings are reported. Chuck assumes that the same covering that protected the Y-13 fuselage also coated \\"everything\\" inside the cockpit. Which means that the creature behind the killings must be his brother Dan. Chuck theorizes that when the canopy burst, Dan's blood absorbed a high content of nitrogen as the protective coating quickly formed over his body, allowing him to survive. But with Dan's metabolism having been altered in space, his body and brain have now become starved of oxygen on Earth; he must now replace that oxygen by consuming any type of oxygen-enriched blood. When Dan's coated helmet is found in a car with his latest victim, Chuck's theory is proven correct. Captain Richards and Chief Wilson put in a call to Washington. Suddenly, the hulking, wheezing, encrusted creature that was once Dan crashes through a nearby window in their building. Chuck realizes that his brother is finding it difficult to breathe. Dan then has Dr. von Essen open the high- altitude testing chamber while he taps into the building's public address system, warning everyone to stay out of the corridors. Chuck instructs Dr. von Essen to relay directions over the system to Dan on how to find the high- altitude chamber. Dan follows the directions while Chuck follows behind. Dan stumbles into the chamber. Chuck realizes that his brother's hands are too badly deformed for him to operate the controls, so Chuck enters the chamber to assist him. A technician quickly increases the chambers' altitude to 38,000 feet, enabling Dan to breath more comfortably. While Chuck uses an oxygen mask, Dan's humanity is slowly restored. He has no recollection of events after he ejected from the Y-13, but, through labored breathing, says \\"I just had to be the first man into space\\". After which he collapses, breathing his last.

Several script elements for the film came from an original script written by Wyott Ordung titled Satellite of Blood. Ordung showed the script to AIP, who ultimately rejected it. However, Alex Gordon of AIP sent the script over to his brother, who liked its plot ideas; several elements from Ordung's script were then combined with Vetter's story. As a result, Ordung later acknowledged First Man into Space as his personal favourite of the films he had made.Weaver and Askwith 2011, pp 68‚Äì79. Gordon successfully pitched the film idea to MGM. Gordon and Vetter then signed on as producers for the project because of the financial success of their two previous films, Fiend Without a Face (1958) and The Haunted Strangler (1958). Because of MGM's financial involvement, the ¬£100,000 budget set for First Man into Space was slightly higher than for the producers' two previous films.\\"The Eddie Mannix Ledger.\\" Margaret Herrick Library, Center for Motion Picture Study (Los Angeles). Location filming for First Man into Space took place in the United States near a Brooklyn, New York air base but also in New Mexico. Most of the studio work was shot in a mansion near Hampstead Heath near London, because of the location's similarity to New York's Central Park; some exterior shots were done in Hampstead itself, while additional filming was done at other British locations.\\"Filming Locations: 'First Man Into Space' (1959).\\" IMDb.com.

Edwards, who played pilot Dan Prescott and the space creature, needed his dialogue synched in post- production. The costume that he wore, a faux micro-meteor encrusted spacesuit, had small holes cut in its opaque head and face mask so the actor could see. Wearing the spacesuit proved difficult for Edwards, due to its tendency to heat up inside. It therefore could not be worn for extended periods. Breathing also became difficult due to the costume's poor air circulation. First Man into Space was directly influenced by The Quatermass Xperiment (1955).Hamilton, 2013, pp. 39-‚Äì41.Weaver 2006. pp. 179‚Äì180.

Dennis Schwartz from Ozus' World Movie Reviews gave the film a C grade, writing, \\"I've seen a lot of sci-fi films that didn't make as much sense as this one does. That doesn't mean that I think this B-film made too much sense. But it was bearable and it didn't try to sensationalize the monster's killing spree and if you are not too fussy about the banal dialogue and the phony Mexican accents, one might even find this film to be easy to take on a rainy Saturday afternoon\\". On his website Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings, Dave Sindelar gave the film a mixed review. He criticized the film's first half as being \\"a draggy bore\\" as well as the clich√©d main characters, but commended Edward's and Delgado's performances and the film's strong second half.

It is named after the district of the same name, which in turn took its name from ancient Baths of Diocletian (in Latin, thermae), which lie across the street from the main entrance.: \\"il toponimo deriva dalle terme di Diocleziano\\" (\\"the toponym derives from the Baths of Diocletian\\"). Overview The station has regular train services to all major Italian cities, as well as daily international services to Munich, Geneva, and Vienna. With 33 platforms and over 180 million passengers each year,Roma Termini Roma Termini is the second largest railway station in Europe after Paris Gare du Nord. Termini is also the main hub for public transport inside Rome. Two Rome Metro lines (A and B) intersect at Termini metro station, and a major bus station is located at Piazza dei Cinquecento, the square in front of the station. However, the main tram lines of the city cross at Porta Maggiore, some 1,500 metres east of the station. On 23 December 2006, the station was dedicated to Pope John Paul II. History On 25 February 1863, Pope Pius IX opened the first, temporary Termini Station as the terminus of the Rome‚ÄìFrascati, Rome‚ÄìCivitavecchia and Rome-Ceprano lines. The first two lines previously had separate stations elsewhere in the city, and, as the third line was under development, the city chose to build one central station, as opposed to the Paris model of having separate terminus stations for each line or each direction. The dilapidated Villa Montalto-Peretti, erected in the 16th Century by Pope Sixtus V, was chosen as the site for this new station, which was to be called the \\"Stazione Centrale delle Ferrovie Romane\\" (Central Station of Roman Railways). Construction of the permanent station began in 1868, in the last years of the Papal Temporal Power over the city of Rome, and was completed in 1874 after the Capture of Rome and installing of government of United Italy. It was laid out according to a plan by the architect Salvatore Bianchi. The front of this station reached Via Cavour, which means it extended some 200 metres deeper into the city than the current station. In 1937, it was decided to replace the old station, as part of the planning for the 1942 World's Fair, which was never held because of the outbreak of World War II. The old station was demolished, and part of the new station was constructed, but works were halted in 1943 as the Italian fascist government collapsed. The side structures of the design by Angiolo Mazzoni del Grande are still part of the current-day station. The terminal building today The current building was designed by the two teams selected through a competition in 1947: Leo Calini and Eugenio Montuori; Massimo Castellazzi, Vasco Fadigati, Achille Pintonello and Annibale Vitellozzi. It was inaugurated in 1950. The building is characterized by the linear lobby hall, a tall space of monumental dimensions. This great hall is fronted by full height glass walls, and is covered with a concrete roof that consists of a flattened and segmented arch, a modernist version of a barrel vault from a Roman bath. The vault is structurally integrated with a cantilevered canopy that extends over the entrance drive. The end result is a gravity-defying modernist structure that also recalls a similar achievement of Roman architecture. The back of the hall leads to a transition space of ticketing functions before reaching the train shed, and is topped by an even longer building block that houses a 10-story hotel, clad with travertine. Architecturally, the building punctuates the sense of arrival in Rome, and communicates a sense of the Eternal City as both modern and traditional, looking forward to the future as well as remembering its history. Its bold presence in the urban fabric expresses the diversity of the City's history, and speaks of the dramatic new scale of the modern industrial economy of Italy. The anodized aluminium frieze panels set in sequence along the length of the glass wall are the work of artist Amerigo Tot. The composition is about capturing the dynamics in sound and speed of a train. Servian Walls A length of the early Roman Servian Wall is preserved outside the station.

New Mission School In 2003, not long after the term \\"Mission School\\" was coined, a panel at the Commonwealth Club of California named several emerging San Francisco artists as constituting a \\"New Mission School\\". These artists included Andrew Schoultz, Dave Warnke, Sirron Norris, Neonski, Ricardo, Damon Soule, Misk, and NoMe, though many of these artists do not embrace the \\"Mission School\\" label. Criticism Mural, LACMA parking garage (now torn down) by Margaret Kilgallen (Meta) The term Mission School has been criticized for being too geographically specific (many artists outside of San Francisco share this aesthetic, while others living in the Mission District do not), while at the same time being a vague catch-all, with many artists who are referred to as Mission School having a hard time seeing how they are part of this \\"school\\".Noble, Aaron. \\"The So Called Mission School\\" in Street Art San Francisco: Mission Muralismo, Jacoby, Annice, ed.

It was published in 1988. The cover image, of Opus sitting on the lap of George H. W. Bush, is a parody of the infamous photo of Donna Rice and Gary Hart from May 1987. It is preceded by Billy and the Boingers Bootleg and followed by The Night of the Mary Kay Commandos. The book includes \\"an exciting copy of the Bloom Picayune\\", plus an introduction supposedly by Mikhail Gorbachev. Synopses of major storylines * Steve Dallas, imprisoned in place of his motel-wrecking bandmates, is coerced into rewriting their contracts and relinquishing his share of royalties. Returning from Albuquerque, Steve and Opus uncomfortably share a motel room. Once home, Bill the Cat's song \\"U Stink But I ‚ô• You\\" is bought by Nabisco for a Wheat Thins jingle. Bill, now a multi-millionaire, moves to Malibu, collects an entourage, and orders the Boingers to become a \\"socially-conscious pop band with leftist overtones\\" √† la U2. (p1, 16 strips) * Opus picks up the morning paper to find that he's forgotten about his wedding with Lola Granola. Steve Dallas, Portnoy, and Hodge-Podge throw Opus a bachelor party, while Lola's mother attempts to teach her promiscuous daughter the \\"facts of life\\". Opus and Lola are wed, but a kissing mishap knocks Opus unconscious. He dreams of life twenty years in the future: a suffocating marriage with 23 tube-grown children, and eventual abandonment.

His heavy metal reputation ruined, Bill returns to Bloom County in shame. (p17, 6 strips) * Opus takes a job as a garbage collector, or as he calls it, a \\"waste-management artisan\\". He sings and dances, encourages customers to recycle their \\"old and spoiled dreams\\", and accidentally reads a mistress's love letter to the wife. (p21, 7 strips) * Bill the Cat is \\"born again\\". \\"Fundamentally Oral Bill\\" rockets to televangelism stardom by raising money to \\"call home\\" rivals Falwell, Swaggart, Bakker, and Roberts.

The aliens descend and wreak havoc upon Earth until they are called to testify before a congressional sub-committee. (p35, 11 strips) * Oliver isolates the hallucinogenic chemical in dandelions, which his father then accidentally ingests. His father spends the day in the tool shed, concerned that Erik Estrada is trying to come out of his navel. (p40, 7 strips) * Binkley's father turns 40, and is convinced that his body is the verge of falling apart. (p42, 4 strips) * Milo receives a letter from exiled Opus, who is working as a male stripper in Arizona. (p45, 6 strips) * Oliver receives a Dickens-like visit from his childhood teddy bear, who protests Oliver's preference for the modern over the traditional. Oliver is re- introduced to his old slide rule. (p48, 6 strips) * The strip takes a turn for the meta, as Opus is found wandering along without a script, and is forced to improvise a story. He ends up lost in a desert, where his mother appears to him in a hallucination and gives him the strength to go on. Finally, he returns to Bloom County. He finds that Steve Dallas has taken over his role as Spock. (p50, 21 strips) * The strip's unionized cast goes on strike for a \\"larger comic-strip size standard to avoid legibility problems\\". After management unsuccessfully attempts to fill in, auditions are held for scabs. The union eventually capitulates, their demands unmet. (p59, 23 strips) * Binkley's father comes to terms with his ruination following the stock market crash. (p72, 3 strips) * Tammy Faye visits Binkley's anxiety closet, terrifying the resident anxieties. She starts to cry and floods the house.

It was founded on June 5, 2001 by Yoshihiro Hosaka along with former manga artists of Enix (now Square Enix). The company performed a merger with Production I.G on December 1, 2007 to form the new company IG Port, becoming one of IG Port's subsidiaries alongside Signal.MD and Wit Studio. History Mag Garden was founded on June 5, 2001 by Yoshihiro Hosaka, who previously worked as an editor from Enix (now Square Enix) before leaving. It started out as a spin-out company from Enix's manga publishing division before the company merged with Square. The Square-Enix merger resulted in an uprising with some of the manga artist staff. Fearing their manga being dropped out of publication and tired of the harsh treatment, they left Square Enix to help create Mag Garden, where they would also continue serializing their series. The establishment of Mag Garden and the former manga artists' departure from Square Enix prompted legal disputes over copyright issues between the two companies. The legal battle was concluded on March 2003 and Square Enix agreed to contribute 50% of Mag Garden's capital. Manga that was once published under Enix from the former authors had to continue serialization under new titles. On September 22, 2003, Mag Garden became a separate, independent company and was admitted in the Tokyo Stock Exchange's \\"Mothers\\" market after Square Enix sold all of its remaining shares. On July 4, 2007, the company announced a merger with Production I.G to form a new company called IG Port. Mag Garden has a steady relationship with Production I.G as they have both collaborated on such cross-media anime/manga projects like Ghost Hound and Sisters of Wellber. Previously, Production I.G was Mag Garden's #2 shareholder as they owned 15% of their stock. The merger was completed on December 1, 2007 in which Mag Garden has officially became a subsidiary of IG Port. Among the manga artists who moved to Mag Garden were Kozue Amano, Rin Asano, Mayumi Azuma, Nanae Chrono, Moyamu Fujino, Maki Hakoda, Sakura Kinoshita, Satomi Kubo, Hiro Matsuba, Minene Sakurano, Kazusa Saitou, Kaili Sorano, Seiuchirou Todono, Sirou Tunasima, and Natsuki Yoshimura.

The film was produced by Alex Gordon and distributed by Allied Artists Pictures Corporation.TCM.com The storyline of The Atomic Submarine concerns an alien invasion that begins when an underwater UFO attacks the world's shipping for unknown reasons. The film showcases the (then) new technology of nuclear submarines and follows the crew and scientists aboard the atomic powered USS Tigershark, which has been ordered to hunt down the mysterious underwater saucer and stop its disruption of sea commerce. Plot A submarine is destroyed near the North Pole by a mysterious undersea light. The loss of this and several other ships in the Arctic alarms the world. Governments temporarily close the polar route and convene an emergency meeting at The Pentagon. Present is Commander Dan Wendover (Dick Foran), the captain of the atomic submarine Tigershark, and Nobel Prize winning scientist Sir Ian Hunt (Tom Conway). The United States Secretary of Defense (Jack Mulhall) leads the meeting; he explains all that is known about the Arctic disasters and then describes the high-tech capabilities of Tigershark. These include a special hull and a mini-sub (Lungfish) that can be stored inside the submarine. The Secretary finishes by telling Wendover that he is to take Hunt, Tigershark, and her crew to resolve the ship sinkings and, if possible, eliminate their cause. Lieutenant Commander Richard \\"Reef\\" Holloway (Arthur Franz), Tigersharks executive officer, learns that his bunk mate is to be Dr. Carl Neilson Jr. (Brett Halsey), a pacifistic scientist that he dislikes. A montage then follows, spotlighting the day-to-day life aboard Tigershark, which eventually discovers the cause of the disasters: an underwater saucer-shaped craft with a sole light atop its upper dome. One of Tigersharks scientists, Dr. Clifford Kent (Victor Varconi), briefly shows a photo of an Unidentified Flying Object, pointing out its similarity to this underwater UFO. The submariners began to realize that their quarry is extraterrestrial. The crew nickname the saucer \\"Cyclops\\" because of its single light. Commander Wendover orders the submarine's most powerful torpedoes fired. They reach the saucer but do not explode, being stopped by a gel-like extrusion coming from within the UFO. The captain orders Tigershark to ram the alien saucer. The submarine's bow tip breaks through its lower side and becomes trapped. Dr. Neilson pilots Lungfish, taking Lt. Commander Holloway and a small party to board the UFO. Holloway has the boarding party cut free the bow with blow-torches. Meanwhile, he explores the saucer's dark hallways after receiving telepathic messages from its sole occupant, an octopus-like creature with a single, very large eye. The alien kills all the boarding party except Holloway. The creature explains that, unlike humanity, what they create is made of living tissue. The saucer is a living creature and (as Holloway understands) is healing. The creature announces that it plans on bringing Holloway and several other specimens back to its home planet for further study. The aliens' plan to modify themselves, based on what they learn about the human specimens. Once finished, they will return to colonize Earth. Holloway attacks by firing a Very pistol into the alien's single eye, temporarily blinding it. While the eye rapidly heals, Holloway races back to Lungfish and returns to the Tigershark. When Dr. Neilson asks about the remainder of their boarding party, Holloway says, \\"Fortunes of war\\". The now healed saucer sails to the North Pole to recharge its energy in preparation for leaving. Holloway tells Wendover, \\"Captain, if that thing ever gets back to where it came from, the Earth and everyone on it is doomed\\". The submariners hold an emergency meeting of Tigersharks on-board scientists, and they develop a plan to adapt a torpedo's guidance system to convert it into a guided water-to-air missile. When the saucer rises from the ocean, Tigershark fires the missile, destroying the UFO. Holloway and the young Neilson are reconciled, with the latter realizing that his pacifism was no match for a hostile alien.Internet Archive Cast * Arthur Franz as Lieutenant Commander Richard 'Reef' Holloway * Dick Foran as Commander Dan Wendover * Brett Halsey as Dr. Carl Neilson * Paul Dubov as Lieutenant David Milburn * Bob Steele as CPO 'Grif' Griffin * Victor Varconi as Dr. Clifford Kent * Joi Lansing as Julie * Selmer Jackson as Admiral Terhune * Jack Mulhall as Secretary of Defense Justin Murdock * Jean Moorhead as Helen Milburn * Richard Tyler as Seaman Don Carney * Sid Melton as Yeoman Chester Tuttle * Kenneth Becker as Seaman Al Powell * Frank Watkins as Watkins * Tom Conway as Sir Ian Hunt * John Hilliard as Voice of Spaceman * Pat Michaels as Narrator Production Principal photography for The Atomic Submarine took place from mid-June to early July 1959.Submarine/original-print-info.html \\"Original print information: The Atomic Submarine.\\" Turner Classic Movies.

Reception Film historian Paul Meehan considered The Atomic Submarine as \\"something of a departure from the usual saucer movie formula\\".Meehan 1998, p. 94. Reviewer David Blakeslee, in a later assessment, commented that \\"once you get past the wooden acting, creaky scripts, stilted narration, corny humor, low-budget props and sheer implausibility of The Atomic Submarines story line, you'll find themes and ideas worth pondering a bit longer than it takes to laugh away at the non-stop unraveling of sci-fi B-movie conventions\\". Chief among the unusual elements is \\"a headier-than-expected socio-political debate between a young principled pacifist and the career military man and WWII veteran sub captain over the merits of war and peace\\". Related films Two later science fiction films also \\"starred\\" nuclear submarines: the USOS Seaview in Irwin Allen's Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1961)STARBURST Magazine and the submarine Atragon in the Japanese film Atragon (1963). In all three films a high-tech nuclear submarine of the near-future travels to the deepest part of the ocean in order to save the Earth from destruction.

The album was recorded in summer 1978 and released in early 1979. Background While Living Without Your Love was produced by session musician David Wolfert instead of Roy Thomas Baker, it was another no-expenses-spared Los Angeles production, recorded with more or less the same session musicians as the previous album and partly in the same studios. Living Without Your Love failed to chart in the US nor the UK. The album was originally titled Never Trust a Man in a Rented Tuxedo and then also had slightly risqu√© cover art, picturing a near naked Springfield coming out of a hotel room shower, only covering herself up with a towel and a man in a tuxedo leaving the room. These plans were however shelved and the album was instead issued under the name Living Without Your Love and new cover art. Touring The track chosen to promote the album in the UK was the ballad \\"I'm Coming Home Again\\", a cover of a song released on Gladys Knight's first solo album the year before. The single was released simultaneously with the announcement that Springfield was to embark on a month-long UK tour, her first live dates in Britain in more than six years. When she arrived in the UK, however, she was met by the news that all concerts in the provinces had been cancelled due to poor ticket sales. Springfield subsequently made an appearance on UK TV wearing a black veil, jokingly saying she was \\"in mourning because all my dates have been cancelled\\". She also made a playback performance singing \\"I'm Coming Home Again\\", with the comment that the lyrics perhaps weren't as relevant any longer. Springfield did play two live dates at London's Drury Lane Theatre, and one charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall in the presence of Princess Margaret, which all sold-out and were major successes. However, during the Albert Hall concert Springfield made the off- the-cuff remark \\"I am glad to see that the royalty isn't confined to the box\\", a tongue-in-cheek reference to her large homosexuality following and the drag queens in the audience. The Princess took this as a personal insult, and later sent the singer a typewritten apology to the Queen which Springfield was made to sign and return. The publicity about the cancelled homecoming tour, and the Albert Hall debacle, didn't help her record sales in the UK. Living Without Your Love consequently became her last LP recorded for Phonogram, a company with which she had been associated, in various forms (Fontana Records/Philips Records/Mercury Records), for nearly twenty years. Two non-album singles produced by David Mackay were recorded and released in the UK that same year. \\"Baby Blue\\", written and co-produced by Trevor Horn, Geoff Downes, and Bruce Woolley, was a disco-pop track, which was also issued as an extended 12\\" single and became a minor club hit (No. 61), but \\"Your Love Still Brings Me to My Knees\\" never charted and the track became Springfield's swan song for Phonogram. Springfield stayed on in Los Angeles for another ten years. It was also to be more than a decade before she released her next full-length album in the UK. Release In 2002, Mercury/Universal Music released Living Without Your Love on CD for the first time. An edited version of the 1979 concert at the Royal Albert Hall was released on both CD and DVD by Eagle Rock in 2005. Reception Reviewing in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: \\"Fledgling producer David Wolfert doesn't get [Springfield's] voice as subtly as Roy Thomas Baker (or Jerry Wexler) did, but he gives her more good songs than she's had in a decade. Also more good sides: one, featuring a 'You've Really Got a Hold on Me' that vies with Smokey's, and 'Closet Man,' which is about what it sounds like and nice indeed.\\" Track listing Side A #\\"You've Really Got a Hold on Me\\" (Smokey Robinson) ‚Äì 3:50 #\\"You Can Do It\\" (Evie Sands, Richard Germinaro, Ben Weisman) ‚Äì 4:13 #\\"Be Somebody\\" (Melissa Manchester, Vini Poncia, John Vastano) ‚Äì 3:25 #\\"Closet Man\\" (David Foster, Donnie Gerrard, Eric Mercury) ‚Äì 4:10 #\\"Living Without Your Love\\" (Steve Nelson, David Wolfert) ‚Äì 3:37 Side B #\\"Save Me, Save Me\\" (Albhy Galuten, Barry Gibb) ‚Äì 3:07 #\\"Get Yourself to Love\\" (Douglas McCormick) ‚Äì 4:07 #\\"I Just Fall in Love Again\\" (Steve Dorff, Larry Herbstritt, Harry Lloyd, Gloria Sklerov) ‚Äì 3:14 #\\"Dream On\\" (Franne Golde, Dennis Mayoff, Carole Bayer Sager) ‚Äì 3:33 #\\"I'm Coming Home Again\\" (Bruce Roberts, Carole Bayer Sager) ‚Äì 3:45 Personnel * Dusty Springfield ‚Äì vocals, background vocals * Dianne Brooks ‚Äì background vocals * Patti Brooks ‚Äì background vocals * Brenda Russell ‚Äì background vocals * Ed Greene ‚Äì drums * Lenny Castro ‚Äì percussion * Gary Coleman ‚Äì percussion, vibraphone * Will Lee ‚Äì bass guitar * Scott Edwards ‚Äì bass * Dennis Budimir ‚Äì guitar * David Wolfert ‚Äì guitar * Jay Graydon ‚Äì guitar * Neil Larsen ‚Äì keyboards * Lincoln Mayorga ‚Äì keyboards * Jai Winding ‚Äì keyboards * Ian Underwood ‚Äì synthesizer * Michael Canahan ‚Äì saxophone * David Leull ‚Äì baritone saxophone * Tom Saviano ‚Äì alto, soprano & tenor saxophone * Dick Hyde ‚Äì trombone * Steve Madaio ‚Äì trumpet, flugelhorn, horn * Harry Bluestone ‚Äì concert master * Nick DeCaro ‚Äì musical conductor * Gene Page ‚Äì musical conductor =Production= * David Wolfert ‚Äì record producer, horn arrangements, rhythm arrangements * Dusty Springfield ‚Äì associate producer * Charles Koppelman ‚Äì executive producer * Myles Chase ‚Äì rhythm arrangements * Nick DeCaro ‚Äì string arrangements * Gene Page ‚Äì string arrangements * Tom Saviano ‚Äì horn arrangements, rhythm arrangements * Al Schmitt, Jr. ‚Äì sound engineer * Sheridan Eldridge ‚Äì engineer * John Weaver ‚Äì engineer * John H.R.

The entirety of the Sydney to Newcastle route was to be known as the F3 freeway, a name that remains as a common name of the Sydney‚ÄìNewcastle Freeway (now Pacific Motorway). The North Western Expressway refers to the section between the Western Distributor and Victoria Road at Huntleys Point, while the Lane Cove Valley Expressway refers to the section between Huntleys Point and Wahroonga, passing through Lane Cove Valley. History The route was planned as early as 1962 (even providing a proposed freeway \\"dotted line\\" in the UBD street directories of the 1970s). The original route was to start at the Western Distributor, connecting to Gladesville Bridge via a new elevated freeway. The route would continue approximately to the intersection of Delhi Road and Epping Road The section from Fig Tree Bridge at Hunters Hill to Gladesville Bridge and the Western Distributor were the only completed sections, with the former section completed in 1965 with the opening of Tarban Creek Bridge. Work on stage one, from Ultimo to Pyrmont Bridge Road, began in 1974. Twelve people were arrested during protests in Ultimo against the expressway, a green ban was imposed by the Builders Labourers Federation, and the Whitlam government threatened to cut off $42 billion in road funding if the NSW government continued with construction.‚ÄòWork to halt on city expressway‚Äô in The Sydney Morning Herald, 2 October 1974, p. 3 As a result, construction was suspended. The Wran Government cancelled the project in 1977, as a part of a change in government policy regarding freeways. =Subsequent proposals= After cancellation, the section between Fig Tree Bridge and Lane Cove Road became part of the proposed Castlereagh Freeway. The section between Delhi Road and Epping Road was shown on a 1984 Department of Main Roads map, but was removed by 1988 when that map was reprinted. The Castlereagh Freeway evolved to become the North West Transport Link, now the M2 Hills Motorway, which was completed in 1997 and follows the originally planned route from Epping Road to Seven Hills.

History The race was named after former Victoria Amateur Turf Club Chairman and thoroughbred owner Herbert Power (1833-1919), who was instrumental in the formation of the sport of racing in the early days of the Colony of Victoria. He joined the original Melbourne Club in 1859 and played an integral part in the merger in 1864 of the Victorian Turf Club and Victorian Jockey club to form today's Victoria Racing Club. In 1875, he was one of a band of racing enthusiasts who founded the Victoria Amateur Turf Club. He was a member of the VATC committee, and he was chairman in 1889, 1896 and 1907.

The carnival is commissioned by Luton Borough Council and is artistically produced by UK Centre for Carnival Arts, which is based in Luton town centre. Traditionally it took place on the Spring Bank Holiday Monday every year, but since 2013 it has been on the Sunday of the bank holiday weekend. The route of the procession has varied over the years; in 2016 it started at Wardown Park and made its way along New Bedford Road, Stockingstone Road, Old Bedford Road, Cromwell Hill and back to Wardown Park.Luton Borough Council, Luton Carnival this Sunday...new route, road closures and more . History The first carnival in Luton was in 1976, on a smaller scale than today, as a Victorian Street Fair and Charity Market as part of Luton Borough Council's centenary celebrations.Spring Bank Holiday Celebrations Official Programme from 1976 displayed at an exhibition at Stockwood Discovery Centre in June 2016. Luton Culture, What's On: The Spirit Of Carnival. The carnival developed and evolved over the years and in 1998 the Luton Carnival acquired 'international status', receiving the largest single lottery award for carnival development. In 2000, to mark the beginning of the new millennium, Luton celebrated with an expanded three-day event with more than 140,000 revellers taking to the streets for the massive international event. Luton International Carnival is commissioned by Luton Borough Council in partnership with the UK Centre for Carnival Arts and Luton Culture. The 2007 carnival, which was due to take place on Bank Holiday Monday 28 May, was cancelled due to unforeseen, adverse weather conditions. Major flooding, following 24 hours of heavy rain, meant New Bedford Road was impassable and the River Lea burst its banks, causing Wardown Park (where the main celebrations are held) to become waterlogged. In addition, continuing high winds meant that stages and other temporary structures were unable to be erected due to safety concerns. This was the first time that the carnival had been called off in history. To coincide with the 2012 Love Luton Festival and the arrival of the London 2012 Olympic Torch (6‚Äì9 July) the international carnival was pushed forward for a later date of 8 July 2012, to join together to form the weekend- festival alongside other annual events such as the Luton Mela, Luton Summer Festival, the Stockwood Concerts and the Festival Concerts, with headlining acts being the Wanted and Olly Murs, and other acts including Skepta and Mz. Bratt. The Olympic Torch, was carried by Lewis Hamilton Formula One driver, through the streets of Luton. The 2012 carnival had 1,500 people participating in the parade which featured 37 different groups, 11 sound systems, masquerade groups, sound trucks, samba troupes, DJs and stilt walkers, all creating an eye catching and dazzling procession, demonstrating the diverse mix of arts, music and culture of Luton. A key feature of the parade was Carnival Crossroads Eastbound, an Arts Council funded project led by UK Centre for Carnival Art‚Äôs Creative Director, which consisted of 100 local community participants from each of five towns in the East of England to create a spectacular 500-participant central Brazilian-style float. The Luton Carnival is the largest one-day carnival in the UK, second only to the annual Notting Hill Carnival, a two-day festival in London that attracts around a million people.

New York University Press, . as well as in later states of the Age of the Islamic Gunpowders such as the Ottoman and Mughal empires. The Islamic Golden Age was a period of cultural, economic and scientific flourishing in the history of Islam, traditionally dated from the eighth century to the fourteenth century, with several contemporary scholars dating the end of the era to the fifteenth or sixteenth century. This period is traditionally understood to have begun during the reign of the Abbasid caliph Harun al- Rashid (786 to 809) with the inauguration of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, where scholars from various parts of the world with different cultural backgrounds were mandated to gather and translate all of the world's classical knowledge into the Arabic language and subsequently development in various fields of sciences began. Science and technology in the Islamic world adopted and preserved knowledge and technologies from contemporary and earlier civilizations, including Persia, Egypt, India, China, and Greco-Roman antiquity, while making numerous improvements, innovations and inventions.

Schoenberg CollectionUPenn LJS 44 *Ghazal: A form of Islamic poetry that originated from the Arabian Peninsula in the late 7th century. ;8th century *Arabesque: The distinctive Arabesque style was developed by the 11th century, having begun in the 8th or 9th century in works like the Mshatta Facade.Tabbaa, Yasser, The transformation of Islamic art during the Sunni revival, I.B.Tauris, 2002, , , pp. 75-88Canby, Sheila, Islamic art in detail, US edn., Harvard University Press, 2005, , , p. 26 *Astrolabe with angular scale and navigational astrolabe: The astrolabe, originally invented some time between 200 and 150 BC, was further developed in the medieval Islamic world, where Muslim astronomers introduced angular scales to the design,See p. 289 of adding circles indicating azimuths on the horizon. *Chemical elements and equivalents: The work of Jabir ibn Hayyan gave the seeds of the modern classification of elements into metals and non-metals as could be seen in his chemical nomenclature. The origins of the idea of chemical equivalents might be traced back to Jabir, in whose time it was recognized that \\"a certain quantity of acid is necessary in order to neutralize a given amount of base.\\" *Cinnabar: Discovered by Jabir ibn Hayyan. *Damascus steel: Damascus blades were first manufactured in the Near East from ingots of Wootz steel that were imported from India. *Geared gristmill: Geared gristmills were built in the medieval Near East and North Africa, which were used for grinding grain and other seeds to produce meals.Donald Routledge Hill (1996), \\"Engineering\\", p. 781, in *Hydrochloric acid: Discovered by Jabir ibn Hayyan.Michael Hamilton Morgan, [Lost History : The Enduring Legacy of Muslim Scientists, Thinkers and Artists] (Washington D.C.: National Geographic, June 2008) p: 164 *Oud and lute: The Arabic oud in Islamic music was the direct ancestor of the European lute. *Paper mill: Scholars have identified paper mills in Abbasid-era Baghdad during 794‚Äì795. *Sulfur-mercury theory: Precursor of Acid-Base Theory, Discovered by Jabir ibn Hayyan.Seyyed Hossain Nasr, Science and Civilization in Islam (ABC International Group, Inc. 2001) p: 266 *Tin-glazing: The tin- glazing of ceramics was invented by Muslim potters in 8th-century Basra, Iraq. The oldest fragments found to-date were excavated from the palace of Samarra about north of Baghdad.Caiger-Smith, 1973, p.23 *Panemone windmill: The earliest recorded windmill design found was Persian in origin, and was invented around the 7th-9th centuries. ;9th century *Alcohol distillation: The medieval Arabs used the distillation process extensively, and there is evidence that they distilled alcohol (which comes from the Arabic word al- kohl). Al-Kindi unambiguously described the distillation of wine in the 9th century.Ahmad Y. al-Hassan (2001), Science and Technology in Islam: Technology and applied sciences, pages 65-69, UNESCOThe Economist: \\"Liquid fire - The Arabs discovered how to distil alcohol. They still do it best, say some\\" 18 December 2003 *Algebra discipline: Al-Khwarizmi is considered the father of algebra. Algebra comes from the Arabic ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿ®ÿ± (al-jabr) in the title of his book Ilm al-jabr wa'l-mu·∏≥ƒÅbala. He was the first to treat algebra as an independent discipline in its own right., page 263‚Äì277: \\"In a sense, al- Khwarizmi is more entitled to be called \\"the father of algebra\\" than Diophantus because al-Khwarizmi is the first to teach algebra in an elementary form and for its own sake, Diophantus is primarily concerned with the theory of numbers\\". *Algebraic reduction and balancing, cancellation, and like terms: Al-Khwarizmi introduced reduction and balancing in algebra. It refers to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation, which the term al-jabr (algebra) originally referred to., The Arabic Hegemony, p. 229: \\"It is not certain just what the terms al-jabr and muqabalah mean, but the usual interpretation is similar to that implied in the translation above. The word al-jabr presumably meant something like \\"restoration\\" or \\"completion\\" and seems to refer to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation; the word muqabalah is said to refer to \\"reduction\\" or \\"balancing\\" ‚Äì that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation\\". *Automatic controls: The Banu Musa's preoccupation with automatic controls distinguishes them from their Greek predecessors, including the Banu Musa's \\"use of self-operating valves, timing devices, delay systems and other concepts of great ingenuity.\\" *Chess manual: The oldest known chess manual was in Arabic and dates to 840‚Äì850, written by Al-Adli ar-Rumi (800‚Äì870), a renowned Arab chess player, titled Kitab ash-shatranj (Book of Chess). During the Islamic Golden Age, many works on shatranj were written, recording for the first time the analysis of opening moves, game problems, the knight's tour, and many more subjects common in modern chess books. *Automatic crank: The non-manual crank appears in several of the hydraulic devices described by the Ban≈´ M≈´sƒÅ brothers in their Book of Ingenious Devices. These automatically operated cranks appear in several devices, two of which contain an action which approximates to that of a crankshaft, anticipating Al-Jazari's invention by several centuries and its first appearance in Europe by over five centuries. However, the automatic crank described by the Banu Musa would not have allowed a full rotation, but only a small modification was required to convert it to a crankshaft. *Conical valve: A mechanism developed by the Banu Musa, of particular importance for future developments, was the conical valve, which was used in a variety of different applications. *Control valve: The Banu Musa brothers are credited with the first known use of conical valves as automatic controllers.Donald Routledge Hill, \\"Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East\\", Scientific American, May 1991, p. 64-69. (cf. Donald Routledge Hill, Mechanical Engineering) *Cryptanalysis and frequency analysis: In cryptology, the first known recorded explanation of cryptanalysis was given by Al-Kindi (also known as \\"Alkindus\\" in Europe), in A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages. This treatise includes the first description of the method of frequency analysis. *Double-seat valve: It was invented by the Banu Musa, and has a modern appearance in their Book of Ingenious Devices. *Egyptology: Several Muslim scholars worked on it. *Ethanol: The Persian physician, alchemist, polymath and philosopher Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (854‚Äì925) is credited with the discovery of ethanol. *Farabian theories: three philosophical theories of al-Farabi: the theory of ten intelligences, theory of the intellect and theory of prophecy. *Food chains: This was identified by al-Jahiz. *Glass manufacturing: Abbas ibn Firnas discovered the process of creating glass from stones.Phillip K. Hitti, History of the Arabs (MacMillan Education Ltd, Tenth Edition, 1970) p: 598 *Lusterware: Lustre glazes were applied to pottery in Mesopotamia in the 9th century; the technique soon became popular in Persia and Syria.Ten thousand years of pottery, Emmanuel Cooper, University of Pennsylvania Press, 4th ed., 2000, , pp. 86‚Äì88. Earlier uses of lustre are known. *Hard soap: Hard toilet soap with a pleasant smell was produced in the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age, when soap-making became an established industry. Recipes for soap- making are described by Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (854‚Äì925), who also gave a recipe for producing glycerine from olive oil. In the Middle East, soap was produced from the interaction of fatty oils and fats with alkali. In Syria, soap was produced using olive oil together with alkali and lime. Soap was exported from Syria to other parts of the Muslim world and to Europe.Ahmad Y. al-Hassan (2001), Science and Technology in Islam: Technology and applied sciences, pages 73-74 , UNESCO *Mental institute: In 872, Ahmad ibn Tulun built a hospital in Cairo that provided care to the insane, which included music therapy. *Kerosene: The process of distilling crude oil/petroleum into kerosene, as well as other hydrocarbon compounds, was first written about in the 9th century by the Persian scholar RƒÅzi (or Rhazes). In his Kitab al-Asrar (Book of Secrets), the physician and chemist Razi described two methods for the production of kerosene, termed naft abyad (\\"white naphtha\\"), using an apparatus called an alembic. *Kerosene lamp: The first description of a simple lamp using crude mineral oil was provided by Persian alchemist al-Razi (Rhazes) in 9th century Baghdad, who referred to it as the \\"naffatah\\" in his Kitab al-Asrar (Book of Secrets).Zayn Bilkadi (University of California, Berkeley), \\"The Oil Weapons\\", Saudi Aramco World, January‚ÄìFebruary 1995, pp. 20‚Äì27. *Minaret: The first known minarets appeared in the early 9th century under Abbasid rule. *Music sequencer and mechanical musical instrument: The origin of automatic musical instruments dates back to the 9th century, when Persian inventors Ban≈´ M≈´sƒÅ brothers invented a hydropowered organ using exchangeable cylinders with pins, and also an automatic flute playing machine using steam power. These were the earliest mechanical musical instruments, and the first programmable music sequencers. *Nitric acid and aqua regia: First mentioned in the works of Arabic alchemists such as Muhammad ibn Zakariya al- Razi.Ahmad Y. Al-Hassan, Cultural contacts in building a universal civilisation: Islamic contributions, published by O.I.C. Research Centre for Islamic History, Art and Culture in 2005 and available online at History of Science and Technology in Islam *Kamal: The kamal originated with Arab navigators of the late 9th century. The invention of the kamal allowed for the earliest known latitude sailing, and was thus the earliest step towards the use of quantitative methods in navigation. *Observatory and research institute: The oldest true observatory, in the sense of a specialized research institute, was built in 825, the Al-Shammisiyyah observatory, in Baghdad, Iraq., in Peter Barrett (2004), Science and Theology Since Copernicus: The Search for Understanding, p. 18, Continuum International Publishing Group, *Petroleum distillation: Crude oil was often distilled by Arabic chemists, with clear descriptions given in Arabic handbooks such as those of Muhammad ibn Zakarƒ´ya RƒÅzi (Rhazes). *Programmable machine and automatic flute player: The Ban≈´ M≈´sƒÅ brothers invented a programmable automatic flute player and which they described in their Book of Ingenious Devices. It was the earliest programmable machine. *Sharbat and soft drink: In the medieval Middle East, a variety of fruit-flavoured soft drinks were widely drunk, such as sharbat, and were often sweetened with ingredients such as sugar, syrup and honey. Other common ingredients included lemon, apple, pomegranate, tamarind, jujube, sumac, musk, mint and ice. Middle Eastern drinks later became popular in medieval Europe, where the word \\"syrup\\" was derived from Arabic. *Sine quadrant: A type of quadrant used by medieval Arabic astronomers, it was described by Muhammad ibn M≈´sƒÅ al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´ in 9th century Baghdad.David A. King, \\"Islamic Astronomy\\", in Christopher Walker (1999), ed., Astronomy before the telescope, p. 167-168. British Museum Press. . *Sulfuric acid: Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (854‚Äì925) is credited with being the first to produce sulfuric acid. *Scimitar: The curved sword or \\"scimitar\\" was widespread throughout the Middle East from at least the Ottoman period, with early examples dating to Abbasid era (9th century) Khurasan. *Sugar mill: Sugar mills first appeared in the medieval Islamic world.Adam Robert Lucas (2005), \\"Industrial Milling in the Ancient and Medieval Worlds: A Survey of the Evidence for an Industrial Revolution in Medieval Europe\\", Technology and Culture 46 (1): 1-30 [10-1 & 27] They were first driven by watermills, and then windmills from the 9th and 10th centuries in what are today Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran.Adam Lucas (2006), Wind, Water, Work: Ancient and Medieval Milling Technology, p. 65, Brill Publishers, *Syringe: The Iraqi/Egyptian surgeon Ammar ibn Ali al-Mawsili invented a syringe in the 9th century using a hollow glass tube, providing suction to remove cataracts from patients' eyes. *Systemic algebraic solution and completing the square: Al-Khwarizmi's popularizing treatise on algebra (The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing, c. 813‚Äì833 CE) presented the first systematic solution of linear and quadratic equations. One of his principal achievements in algebra was his demonstration of how to solve quadratic equations by completing the square, for which he provided geometric justifications. *Thabit numbers: Named after Thabit ibn Qurra *Throttling valve: It appears for the first time in the Banu Musa's Book of Ingenious Devices. *Variable structure control: Two-step level controls for fluids, a form of discontinuous variable structure controls, was developed by the Banu Musa brothers. *Wind-powered gristmill: The first wind-powered gristmills were built in the 9th and 10th centuries in what are now Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. *Windpump: Windpumps were used to pump water since at least the 9th century in what is now Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan. ;10th century *Alhazen's problem: A theorem by ibn al-Haytham solved only in 1997 by Neumann. *Arabic numerals: The modern Arabic numeral symbols originate from Islamic North Africa in the 10th century. A distinctive Western Arabic variant of the Eastern Arabic numerals began to emerge around the 10th century in the Maghreb and Al-Andalus (sometimes called ghubar numerals, though the term is not always accepted), which are the direct ancestor of the modern Arabic numerals used throughout the world. *Binomial theorem: The first formulation of the binomial theorem and the table of binomial coefficient can be found in a work by Al-Karaji, quoted by Al-Samaw'al in his \\"al-Bahir\\". *Cauchy-Riemann Integral: Ibn al- Haytham gave a simple form of this. *Decimal fractions: Decimal fractions were first used by Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi in the 10th century. *Experimental scientific method: Expounded and practised by ibn al-Haytham *Fountain pen: An early historical mention of what appears to be a reservoir pen dates back to the 10th century. According to Ali Abuzar Mari (d. 974) in his Kitab al- Majalis wa 'l-musayarat, the Fatimid caliph Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah demanded a pen that would not stain his hands or clothes, and was provided with a pen that held ink in a reservoir, allowing it to be held upside-down without leaking. *Law of cotangents: This was first given by Ibn al-Haytham. *Muqarnas: The origin of the muqarnas can be traced back to the mid-tenth century in northeastern Iran and central North Africa, as well as the Mesopotamian region. *Pascal's triangle: The Persian mathematician Al-Karaji (953‚Äì1029) wrote a now lost book which contained the first description of Pascal's triangle.The developpement of Arabic Mathematics Between Arithmetic and Algebra - R. Rashed \\"Page 63\\" *Ruffini-Horner Algorithm: Discovered by ibn al-Haytham *Sextant and mural instrument: The first known mural sextant was constructed in Ray, Iran, by Abu-Mahmud al-Khujandi in 994. *Shale oil extraction: In the 10th century, the Arab physician Masawaih al-Mardini (Mesue the Younger) described a method of extraction of oil from \\"some kind of bituminous shale\\". *Snell's law: The law was first accurately described by the Persian scientist Ibn Sahl at the Baghdad court in 984. In the manuscript On Burning Mirrors and Lenses, ibn Sahl used the law to derive lens shapes that focus light with no geometric aberrations. According to Jim al-Khalili, the law should be called ibn Sahl's law. *Vertical-axle windmill: A small wind wheel operating an organ is described as early as the 1st century AD by Hero of Alexandria.Dietrich Lohrmann, \\"Von der √∂stlichen zur westlichen Windm√ºhle\\", Archiv f√ºr Kulturgeschichte, Vol. 77, Issue 1 (1995), pp.1-30 (10f.) The first vertical-axle windmills were eventually built in Sistan, Persia as described by Muslim geographers. These windmills had long vertical driveshafts with rectangle shaped blades.Ahmad Y Hassan, Donald Routledge Hill (1986). Islamic Technology: An illustrated history, p. 54. Cambridge University Press. . They may have been constructed as early as the time of the second Rashidun caliph Umar (634-644 AD), though some argue that this account may have been a 10th- century amendment.Dietrich Lohrmann (199786543). \\"Von der √∂stlichen zur westlichen Windm√ºhle\\", Archiv f√ºr Kulturgeschichte 77 (1), p. 1-30 (8). Made of six to twelve sails covered in reed matting or cloth material, these windmills were used to grind grains and draw up water, and used in the gristmilling and sugarcane industries.Donald Routledge Hill, \\"Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East\\", Scientific American, May 1991, pp. 64-9 (cf. Donald Routledge Hill, Mechanical Engineering ) Horizontal axle windmills of the type generally used today, however, were developed in Northwestern Europe in the 1180s. *Wilson's theorem: This is first mentioned by ibn al-Haytham. ;11th-12th centuries *Drug trial: Persian physician Avicenna, in The Canon of Medicine (1025), first described use of clinical trials for determining the efficacy of medical drugs and substances. *Double- entry bookkeeping system: Double-entry bookkeeping was pioneered in the Jewish community of the medieval Middle East.Parker, L. M., \\"Medieval Traders as International Change Agents: A Comparison with Twentieth Century International Accounting Firms,\\" The Accounting Historians Journal, 16(2) (1989): 107‚Äì118.MEDIEVAL TRADERS AS INTERNATIONAL CHANGE AGENTS: A COMMENT, Michael Scorgie, The Accounting Historians Journal, Vol. 21, No. 1 (June 1994), pp. 137-143 *Hyperbolic geometry: The theorems of Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen), Omar Khayy√°m and Nasƒ´r al-Dƒ´n al-T≈´sƒ´ on quadrilaterals were the first theorems on hyperbolic geometry.Boris A. Rosenfeld and Adolf P. Youschkevitch (1996), \\"Geometry\\", in Roshdi Rashed, ed., Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science, Vol. 2, p. 447‚Äì494 [470], Routledge, London and New York: *Magnifying glass and convex lens: A convex lens used for forming a magnified image was described in the Book of Optics by Ibn al-Haytham in 1021. *Mechanical flywheel: The mechanical flywheel, used to smooth out the delivery of power from a driving device to a driven machine and, essentially, to allow lifting water from far greater depths (up to 200 metres), was first employed by Ibn Bassal (fl. 1038‚Äì1075), of Al-Andalus.Ahmad Y Hassan, Flywheel Effect for a Saqiya. *Mercuric chloride (formerly corrosive sublimate): used to disinfect wounds. *Proof by contradiction: Ibn al-Haytham (965‚Äì1039) developed the method of proof by contradiction. *Spinning wheel: The spinning wheel was invented in the Islamic world by the early 11th century. There is evidence pointing to the spinning wheel being known in the Islamic world by 1030, and the earliest clear illustration of the spinning wheel is from Baghdad, drawn in 1237. *Steel mill: By the 11th century, much of the Islamic world had industrial steel watermills in operation, from Al-Andalus and North Africa to the Middle East and Central Asia. *Weight-driven clock: Arabic engineers invented water clocks driven by gears and weights in the 11th century.Hassan, Ahmad Y, Transfer Of Islamic Technology To The West, Part II: Transmission Of Islamic Engineering, History of Science and Technology in Islam *Optic chiasm: The crossing of nerve fibres, and the impact on vision that this had, was first clearly identified by Persian physician \\"Esmail Jorjani\\", who appears to be Zayn al-Din Gorgani (1042‚Äì1137). The optic chiasm was earlier theorized by Ibn al-Haytham in the early 11th century. *Pinhole camera: Ibn al-Haytham has been credited with the invention of the pinhole camera in the early 11th century. *Paper packaging: The earliest recorded use of paper for packaging dates back to 1035, when a Persian traveler visiting markets in Cairo noted that vegetables, spices and hardware were wrapped in paper for the customers after they were sold. *Bridge mill: The bridge mill was a unique type of watermill that was built as part of the superstructure of a bridge. The earliest record of a bridge mill is from C√≥rdoba, Spain in the 12th century. *Guitar: The guitar has roots in the four-string oud, brought to Iberia by the Moors in the 8th century. A direct ancestor of the modern guitar is the ' (Moorish guitar), which was in use in Spain by 1200. By the 14th century, it was simply referred to as a guitar.Tom and Mary Anne Evans. Guitars: From the Renaissance to Rock. Paddington Press Ltd 1977 p.16 ;13th century *Fritware: It refers to a type of pottery which was first developed in the Near East, beginning in the late 1st millennium, for which frit was a significant ingredient. A recipe for \\"fritware\\" dating to c. 1300 AD written by Abu‚Äôl Qasim reports that the ratio of quartz to \\"frit-glass\\" to white clay is 10:1:1. This type of pottery has also been referred to as \\"stonepaste\\" and \\"faience\\" among other names.Mason and Tite 1994, 77. A 9th-century corpus of \\"proto-stonepaste\\" from Baghdad has \\"relict glass fragments\\" in its fabric.Mason and Tite 1994, 79-80. *Mercury clock: A detailed account of technology in Islamic Spain was compiled under Alfonso X of Castile between 1276 and 1279, which included a compartmented mercury clock, which was influential up until the 17th century. It was described in the Libros del saber de Astronomia, a Spanish work from 1277 consisting of translations and paraphrases of Arabic works.Silvio A. Bedini (1962), \\"The Compartmented Cylindrical Clepsydra\\", Technology and Culture, Vol. 3, No. 2, pp. 115‚Äì141 (116‚Äì118) *Mariotte's bottle: The Libros del saber de Astronomia describes a water clock which employs the principle of Mariotte's bottle. *Metabolism: Ibn al-Nafees is the first scientist in history to describe metabolism. *Naker: Arabic nakers were the direct ancestors of most timpani, brought to 13th- century Continental Europe by Crusaders and Saracens. *Tusi couple: Nasir al- Din al-Tusi was the first astronomer to attempt a solution which would provide for latitudinal motion without introducing a longitudinal component. =Al Andalus (Islamic Spain)= ;9th-12th centuries * Inheritance of hemophilia: First proposed by Abu Al-Zahrawi was first to record and suggest that hemophilia was an inherited disease. * Inhalation anesthesia: Invented by al- Zahrawi and Ibn Zuhr. Used a sponge soaked with narcotic drugs and placed it on patient's face. These Muslim physicians were the first to use an anaesthetic sponge. *Ligatures: Described in the work of al-Zahrawi (936‚Äì1013), Kitab al-Tasrif, one of the most influential books in early modern medicine. Describes the process of performing a ligature on blood vessels. *Lithotrite: Invented by Al-Zahrawi.Butt, Arthur J. (1956).

Hispano-Moresque ware was distinguished from the pottery of Christendom by the Islamic character of its decoration.Caiger-Smith, 1973, p.65 *Polar-axis sundial: Early sundials were nodus-based with straight hour- lines, indicating unequal hours (also called temporary hours) that varied with the seasons, since every day was divided into twelve equal segments; thus, hours were shorter in winter and longer in summer. The idea of using hours of equal time length throughout the year was the innovation of Abu'l-Hasan Ibn al-Shatir in 1371, based on earlier developments in trigonometry by Muhammad ibn JƒÅbir al-HarrƒÅnƒ´ al-BattƒÅnƒ´ (Albategni). Ibn al-Shatir was aware that \\"using a gnomon that is parallel to the Earth's axis will produce sundials whose hour lines indicate equal hours on any day of the year.\\" His sundial is the oldest polar-axis sundial still in existence. The concept later appeared in Western sundials from at least 1446. =Sultanates= ;12th century *Blood measurement device: Created by Al-JazariHoward R.

He employed it as part of his automata, water-raising machines, and water clocks such as the castle clock.Georges Ifrah (2001). The Universal History of Computing: From the Abacus to the Quatum Computer, p. 171, Trans. E.F. Harding, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (See ) *Candle clock with dial and fastening mechanism: The most sophisticated candle clocks known were those of Al-Jazari in 1206.Donald Routledge Hill, \\"Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East\\", Scientific American, May 1991, pp. 64-9 (cf. Donald Routledge Hill, Mechanical Engineering ) It included a dial to display the time. *Crankshaft: Al-Jazari (1136-1206) is credited with the invention of the crankshaft. He described a crank and connecting rod system in a rotating machine in two of his water-raising machines.Ahmad Y Hassan. The Crank-Connecting Rod System in a Continuously Rotating Machine. His twin-cylinder pump incorporated a crankshaft, including both the crank and shaft mechanisms.Donald Hill (2012), The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices, page 273, Springer Science + Business Media *Crank-slider: Ismail al-Jazari's water pump employed the first known crank-slider mechanism. *Cotton gin with worm gear: The worm gear roller gin was invented in the Delhi Sultanate during the 13th to 14th centuries.Irfan Habib (2011), Economic History of Medieval India, 1200‚Äì1500, p. 53, Pearson Education *Design and construction methods: English technology historian Donald Hill wrote, \\"We see for the first time in al-Jazari's work several concepts important for both design and construction: the lamination of timber to minimize warping, the static balancing of wheels, the use of wooden templates (a kind of pattern), the use of paper models to establish designs, the calibration of orifices, the grinding of the seats and plugs of valves together with emery powder to obtain a watertight fit, and the casting of metals in closed mold boxes with sand.\\"Donald Hill, \\"Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East\\", Scientific American, May 1991, pp. 64-9 (cf. Donald Hill, Mechanical Engineering ) *Draw bar: The draw bar was applied to sugar- milling, with evidence of its use at Delhi in the Mughal Empire by 1540, but possibly dating back several centuries earlier to the Delhi Sultanate.Irfan Habib (2011), Economic History of Medieval India, 1200‚Äì1500, page 53, Pearson Education *Minimising intermittence: The concept of minimising the intermittence is first implied in one of Al-Jazari's saqiya devices, which was to maximise the efficiency of the saqiya.Donald Hill, \\"Engineering\\", p. 776, in Roshdi Rashed, ed., Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science, Vol. 2, pp. 751‚Äì795, Routledge, London and New York *Programmable automaton and drum machine: The earliest programmable automata, and the first programmable drum machine, were invented by Al-Jazari, and described in The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices, written in 1206. His programmable musical device featured four automaton musicians, including two drummers, that floated on a lake to entertain guests at royal drinking parties. It was a programmable drum machine where pegs (cams) bump into little levers that operated the percussion. The drummers could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns if the pegs were moved around.Noel Sharkey, A 13th Century Programmable Robot (Archive), University of Sheffield. *Tusi couple: The couple was first proposed by Nasir al-Din al-Tusi in his 1247 Tahrir al- Majisti (Commentary on the Almagest) as a solution for the latitudinal motion of the inferior planets. The Tusi couple is explicitly two circles of radii x and 2x in which the circle with the smaller radii rotates inside the Bigger circle. The oscillatory motion be produced by the combined uniform circular motions of two identical circles, one riding on the circumference of the other. *Griot: The griot musical tradition originates from the Islamic Mali Empire, where the first professional griot was Balla Fass√©k√©. *Segmental gear: A segmental gear is \\"a piece for receiving or communicating reciprocating motion from or to a cogwheel, consisting of a sector of a circular gear, or ring, having cogs on the periphery, or face.\\"Segment gear, TheFreeDictionary.com Professor Lynn Townsend White, Jr. wrote, \\"Segmental gears first clearly appear in al-Jazari\\".The Automata of Al-Jazari. The Topkapƒ± Palace Museum, Istanbul. *Sitar: According to various sources, the sitar was invented by Amir Khusrow, a famous Sufi inventor, poet, and pioneer of Khyal, Tarana and Qawwali, in the Delhi Sultanate. Others say that the instrument was brought from Iran and modified for the tastes of the rulers of the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire. *Torpedo: The concept of a torpedo existed many centuries before it was later successfully developed. In 1275, Hasan al-Rammah described \\"...an egg which moves itself and burns\\". ;14th century *Cotton gin with crank handle: The incorporation of the crank handle in the cotton gin, first appeared in either the late Delhi Sultanate or the early Mughal Empire.Irfan Habib (2011), Economic History of Medieval India, 1200‚Äì1500, pp. 53‚Äì54, Pearson Education =Ottoman Empire= ;14th century *Modern standing army: The first modern standing armies were the Janissaries of the Ottoman Empire, formed in the fourteenth century.Lord Kinross (1977). Ottoman Centuries: The Rise and Fall of the Turkish Empire. New York: Morrow Quill Paperbacks, 52. .Goodwin, Jason (1998). Lords of the Horizons: A History of the Ottoman Empire. New York: H. Holt, 59,179-181. . ;15th century *Coffee: Stories exist of coffee originating in Ethiopia, but the earliest credible evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century, in the Sufi monasteries of the Yemen in southern Arabia. It was in Yemen that coffee beans were first roasted and brewed as they are today. From Mocha, coffee spread to Egypt and North Africa, and by the 16th century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East, Persia and Turkey. From the Muslim world, coffee drinking spread to Italy, then to the rest of Europe, and coffee plants were transported by the Dutch to the East Indies and to the Americas. *Dardanelles Gun: The Dardanelles Gun was designed and cast in bronze in 1434 by Munir Ali. The Dardanelles Gun was still present for duty more than 340 years later in 1807, when a Royal Navy force appeared and commenced the Dardanelles Operation. Turkish forces loaded the ancient relics with propellant and projectiles, then fired them at the British ships. The British squadron suffered 28 casualties from this bombardment.Schmidtchen, Volker (1977b), \\"Riesengesch√ºtze des 15. Jahrhunderts. Technische H√∂chstleistungen ihrer Zeit\\", Technikgeschichte 44 (3): 213‚Äì237 (226‚Äì228) *Iznik pottery: Produced in Ottoman Turkey as early as the 15th century AD. It consists of a body, slip, and glaze, where the body and glaze are \\"quartz-frit.\\"Tite 1989, 120. The \\"frits\\" in both cases \\"are unusual in that they contain lead oxide as well as soda\\"; the lead oxide would help reduce the thermal expansion coefficient of the ceramic.Tite 1989, 129. Microscopic analysis reveals that the material that has been labeled \\"frit\\" is \\"interstitial glass\\" which serves to connect the quartz particles.Tite 1989, 120, 123. *Standing army with firearms: The Ottoman military's regularized use of firearms proceeded ahead of the pace of their European counterparts. The Janissaries had been an infantry bodyguard using bows and arrows. During the rule of Sultan Mehmed II they were drilled with firearms and became \\"the first standing infantry force equipped with firearms in the world.\\" ;16th century *Firearm kneeling position: At the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526, the Janissaries equipped with 2000 t√ºfenks (usually translated as musket) \\"formed nine consecutive rows and they fired their weapons row by row,\\" in a \\"kneeling or standing position without the need for additional support or rest.\\" The Chinese later adopted the Ottoman kneeling position for firing. *Marching band and military band: The marching band and military band both have their origins in the Ottoman military band, performed by the Janissary since the 16th century. *Matchlock volley fire: Volley fire with matchlocks was first implemented in 1526 when the Ottoman Janissaries utilized it during the Battle of Moh√°cs. *Parallel rulers: Invented by Taqi ad-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf and used at the Constantinople Observatory of Taqi ad-Din (1577-1580). *Practical impulse steam turbine: A practical impulse steam turbine was first described in 1551 by Taqi al-Din, a philosopher, astronomer and engineer in 16th century Ottoman Egypt, who described a method for rotating a spit by means of a jet of steam playing on rotary vanes around the periphery of a wheel. A similar device for rotating a spit was also later described by John Wilkins in 1648.Taqi al-Din and the First Steam Turbine, 1551 A.D. , web page, accessed on line 23 October 2009; this web page refers to Ahmad Y Hassan (1976), Taqi al-Din and Arabic Mechanical Engineering, pp. 34-5, Institute for the History of Arabic Science, University of Aleppo. *Steam jack: A steam-powered roasting jack was first described by the Ottoman polymath and engineer Taqi al-Din in his Al-Turuq al-samiyya fi al-alat al-ruhaniyya (The Sublime Methods of Spiritual Machines), in 1551 CE (959 AH). It was an impulse steam turbine with practical applications as a prime mover for rotating a spit, predating Giovanni Branca's later impulse steam turbine from 1629.Ahmad Y. Hassan (1976), Taqi al-Din and Arabic Mechanical Engineering, p. 34-35, Institute for the History of Arabic Science, University of Aleppo =Safavid Dynasty= The Rothschild Small Silk Medallion Carpet, mid-16th century, Museum of Islamic Art, Doha ;15th century *Classical Oriental carpet: By the late fifteenth century, the design of Persian carpets changed considerably. Large-format medallions appeared, ornaments began to show elaborate curvilinear designs. Large spirals and tendrils, floral ornaments, depictions of flowers and animals, were often mirrored along the long or short axis of the carpet to obtain harmony and rhythm. The earlier \\"kufic\\" border design was replaced by tendrils and arabesques. All these patterns required a more elaborate system of weaving, as compared to weaving straight, rectilinear lines. Likewise, they require artists to create the design, weavers to execute them on the loom, and an efficient way to communicate the artist's ideas to the weaver. Today this is achieved by a template, termed cartoon (Ford, 1981, p. 170). How Safavid manufacturers achieved this, technically, is currently unknown. The result of their work, however, was what Kurt Erdmann termed the \\"carpet design revolution\\". Apparently, the new designs were developed first by miniature painters, as they started to appear in book illuminations and on book covers as early as in the fifteenth century. This marks the first time when the \\"classical\\" design of Islamic rugs was established. =Mughal Empire= ;16th century A detailed portrait of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir holding a globe probably made by Muhammad Saleh Thattvi *Hookah or water pipe: according to Cyril Elgood (PP.41, 110), the physician Irfan Shaikh, at the court of the Mughal emperor Akbar I (15421605) invented the Hookah or water pipe used most commonly for smoking tobacco. *Metal cylinder rocket: In the 16th century, Akbar was the first to initiate and use metal cylinder rockets known as bans, particularly against war elephants, during the Battle of Sanbal. *Multi-barrel matchlock volley gun: Fathullah Shirazi (c. 1582), a Persian polymath and mechanical engineer who worked for Akbar, developed an early multi-shot gun. Shirazi's rapid-firing gun had multiple gun barrels that fired hand cannons loaded with gunpowder. It may be considered a version of a volley gun. One such gun he developed was a seventeen-barrelled cannon fired with a matchlock. *Seamless celestial globe: It was invented in Kashmir by Ali Kashmiri ibn Luqman in 998 AH (1589‚Äì1590), and twenty other such globes were later produced in Lahore and Kashmir during the Mughal Empire. Before they were rediscovered in the 1980s, it was believed by modern metallurgists to be technically impossible to produce metal globes without any seams.Savage-Smith, Emilie (1985), Islamicate Celestial Globes: Their History, Construction, and Use, Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, DC ;17th century *Roller mill: Sugar rolling mills first appeared in the Mughal Empire, using the principle of rollers as well as worm gearing, by the 17th century.

At some point his family moved back to British Guiana, where London attended Queen's College in Georgetown.\\"Angry Cow Instilled Speed In Phil Edwards of N.Y.U.\\", New York Daily News, 20 May 1928 p.30 Back in England, London studied at the Regent Street Polytechnic, where he joined the Polytechnic Harriers and was coached by Sam Mussabini. He was elected captain of the sports club in October 1922. He was an early adopter of starting blocks rather than digging footholds in the cinder tracks. He ran the 100 metres in 10.7 seconds to win the race at a competition between England and France at Stamford Bridge in July 1927, and then won both the 100 metres and the 200 metres at a competition in Paris in October 1927. London competed for Great Britain in the 1928 Summer Olympics held in Amsterdam, Netherlands. After equalling the Olympic 100 metres record of 10.6 seconds in the semi-final, he won the silver medal in the 100 metres final, behind Canadian Percy Williams. He then won the bronze medal in the 4√ó100 metres relay with his teammates Cyril Gill, Edward Smouha and Walter Rangeley, behind the teams of the USA and Germany. He was the first to use starting blocks at the Olympic Games. He was awarded the Polytechnic Harriers's S. A. Mussabini memorial medal (Mussabini having died in 1927) and the Studd Trophy in 1928. He was later coached by Albert Hill. In July 1929, he became the first British sprinter to win the Amateur Athletic Association's 100 yards title since Harold Abrahams in 1924. He was also a leading British high jumper in this period. His athletic career was curtailed by a leg injury in 1930. He joined a 4√ó100 metre relay for England against Germany in 1931, but was not selected for the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. After he retired from athletics, he became an entertainer, playing piano in the original cast of the No√´l Coward's musical Cavalcade at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1931. He also appeared in Will Hay's Gainsborough Pictures comedy Old Bones of the River in 1938. He married at Marylebone register office in 1930, where his profession was recorded as \\"pianist\\". He was later divorced and remarried in 1938. With athletics journalist Joe Binks, he co-wrote an athletics coaching manual in 1948, The Way to Win on Track and Field, but the book was not a commercial success. He later worked as a porter at St Pancras Hospital, and died suddenly from a subarachnoid haemorrhage.

It also may refer to the confiscation or destruction of property, or the incitement of hatred towards Buddhists. Pre-modern persecutions of Buddhism =Sassanids= In 224 CE Zoroastrianism was made the official religion of Persia, and other religions were not tolerated, thus halting the spread of Buddhism westwards. In the 3rd century the Sassanids overran the Bactrian region, overthrowing Kushan rule,Alexander Berzin, History of Buddhism in Afghanistan, November 2001, Online Article from Study Buddhism. Last accessed 20 June 2016 were persecuted with many of their stupas fired. Although strong supporters of Zoroastrianism, the Sassanids tolerated Buddhism and allowed the construction of more Buddhist monasteries. It was during their rule that the Lokottaravada followers erected the two Buddha statues at Bamiyan. During the second half of the third century, the Zoroastrian high priest Kirder dominated the religious policy of the state. He ordered the destruction of several Buddhist monasteries in Afghanistan, since the amalgam of Buddhism and Zoroastrianism manifested in the form of a \\"Buddha-Mazda\\" deity appeared to him as heresy. Buddhism quickly recovered after his death. =Pushyamitra Shunga= The first persecution of Buddhists in India took place in the 2nd century BC by King Pushyamitra Shunga.Encyclopedia of Buddhism: \\"Persecutions\\", P. 640. A non-contemporary Buddhist text states that Pushyamitra cruelly persecuted Buddhists. While some scholars believe he did persecute Buddhists based on the Buddhist accounts, others consider them biased because of him not patronising them. Many other scholars have expressed skepticism about the Buddhist claims. √âtienne Lamotte points out that the Buddhist legends are not consistent about the location of Pushyamitra's anti- Buddhist campaign and his death: \\"To judge from the documents, Pushyamitra must be acquitted through lack of proof.\\"Lamotte, E., Dantinne, J., & Webb- Boin, S. (1988). History of Indian Buddhism: From the origins to the ≈öaka era. Louvain-la-Neuve: Universit√© Catholique de Louvain, Institut Orientaliste. Agreeing with him, D. Devahuti states that Pushyamitra's sudden destruction after offering rewards for Buddhist heads is \\"manifestly false\\". R. C. Mitra states that \\"The tales of persecution by Pushyamitra as recorded in Divyavadana and by Taranatha bear marks of evident absurdity.\\" =Hepthalites= Central Asian and North Western Indian Buddhism weakened in the 6th century following the White Hun invasion who followed their own religions such as Tengri and Manichaean. Around 440 CE they conquered Sogdiana then conquered Gandhara and pushed on into the Gangetic Plains. Their King Mihirkula who ruled from 515 CE suppressed Buddhism, destroying monasteries as far as modern-day Allahabad before his son reversed the policy. = Persecution by Hindus = Dharmarajika stupa in Sarnath once stood 30 m tall before demolition in 1794 Dhamekh Stupa of Sarnath Persecution of Buddhists started as early as in the life or soon after the death of King Ashoka according to some like D.N.Jha. Jha writes that according to Kashmiri texts dated to the 12th century, Ashoka's Son Jalauka was a Shaivite and was responsible for the destruction of many Buddhist monasteries. The story of Jalauka is essentially legendary, and its to be noted that no independent corroboration of the Kashmir tradition has ever been discovered. Patanjali, a famous grammarian stated in his Mahabhashya that Brahmins and Sharamanas (buddhists) were eternal enemies With the emergence of Hindu rulers of the Gupta Empire, Hinduism saw a major revivalism in the Indian subcontinent which challenged Buddhism which was at that time at its zenith. Even though Gupta empire was tolerant towards Buddhism and patronized Buddhist arts and religious institutions, Hindu revivalism generally became a major threat to Buddhism which led to its decline. A Buddhist illustrated palm leaf manuscript from Pala period (one of the earliest Indian illustrated manuscripts to survive in modern times) is preserved in University of Cambridge library. Composed in the year 1015, the manuscript contains a note from the year 1138 by a Buddhist believer called Karunavajra which indicates that without his efforts, the manuscript would have been destroyed during a political struggle for power. The note states that 'he rescued the 'Perfection of Wisdom, incomparable Mother of the Omniscient' from falling into the hands of unbelievers (who according to Camillo Formigatti were most probably people of Brahmanical affiliation). In 1794 Jagat Singh, Dewan (minister) of Raja Chet Singh of Banaras began excavating two pre Ashokan era stupas at Sarnath for construction material. Dharmarajika stupa was completely demolished and only its foundation exists today while Dhamekh stupa incurred serious damage. During excavation a green marble relic casket was discovered from Dharmarajika stupa which contained Buddha's ashes was subsequently thrown into Ganges river by Jagat Singh according to his Hindu faith. The incident was reported by a British resident and timely action of British authorities saved Dhamekh Stupa from demolition. Historical evidence about the persecution of Buddhism in ancient India is missing or unsubstantiated; colonial era writers have used mythical folk stories to construct a part of ancient Buddhist history. For example, the Divyavadana (divine stories), an anthology of Buddhist mythical tales on morals and ethics, many using talking birds and animals, was written in about 2nd century AD. In one of the stories, the razing of stupas and viharas is mentioned with Pushyamitra. This has been historically mapped to the reign of King Pushyamitra of the Shunga Empire about 400 years before Divyavadana was written. The existence of religious violence between Hinduism and Buddhism, in ancient India, has been disputed. The fictional tales of Divyavadana is considered by scholars as being of doubtful value as a historical record. Moriz Winternitz, for example, stated, \\"these legends [in the DivyƒÅvadƒÅna] scarcely contain anything of much historical value\\".Andy Rotman (Translator), Paul Harrison et al (Editors), Divine Stories - The DivyƒÅvadƒÅna Part 1, Wisdom Publications, Boston, , Introduction, Preview summary of book The Asokavadana legend has been likened to a Buddhist version of Pushyamitra's attack of the Mauryas, reflecting the declining influence of Buddhism in the Shunga Imperial court. Later Shunga kings were seen as amenable to Buddhism and as having contributed to the building of the stupa at Bharhut. The decline of Buddhism in India did not set in until the Gupta dynasty. Archeological remains of stupas have been found in Deorkothar that suggest deliberate destruction, conjectured to be one mentioned in Divyavadana about Pushyamitra. However, it is unclear whether the stupas were destroyed in ancient India or a much later period, and the existence of religious violence between Hinduism and Buddhism in ancient India has been disputed.Akira Hirakawa, Paul Groner, A History of Indian Buddhism: From Sakyamuni to Early Mahayan, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1996, , p. 223 It is unclear when the Deorkothar stupas were destroyed, and by whom. The fictional tales of Divyavadana is considered by scholars as being of doubtful value as a historical record. Moriz Winternitz, for example, stated, \\"these legends [in the DivyƒÅvadƒÅna] scarcely contain anything of much historical value\\". Similarly, Paul Williams states that the persecution claims with alleged dates of Buddha's nirvana (400 BCE) and the subsequent Pusyamitra reign, as depicted in the Mahasanghika school of early Buddhism are the \\"most far fetched of all the arguments and hardly worth of any further discussion\\". According to other scholars, the Shunga kings were seen as more amenable to Buddhism and as having contributed to the building of the stupa at BharhutAkira Hirakawa, Paul Groner, A History of Indian Buddhism: From Sakyamuni to Early Mahayan, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1996, , p. 223 and an inscription at Bodh Gaya at the Mahabodhi Temple records the construction of the temple as follows, \\"The gift of Nagadevi the wife of King Brahmamitra\\". Another inscription reads: \\"The gift of Kurangi, the mother of living sons and the wife of King Indragnimitra, son of Kosiki. The gift also of Srima of the royal palace shrine.\\"Old Buddhist Shrines at Bodh-Gaya Inscriptions By B.M. Barua, \\"The Indian Historical Quarterly\\", Vol. VI, No. 1, MARCH 1930, pp. 1‚Äì31 =Emperor Wuzong of Tang= Emperor Wuzong of Tang (814-846) indulged in indiscriminate religious persecution, solving a financial crisis by seizing the property of Buddhist monasteries. Buddhism had developed into a major religious force in China during the Tang period, and its monasteries had tax-exempt status. Wuzong closed many Buddhist shrines, confiscated their property, and sent the monks and nuns home to lay life. Apart from economic reasons, Wuzong's motivation was also philosophical or ideological. As a zealous Taoist, he considered Buddhism a foreign religion that was harmful to Chinese society. He went after other foreign religions as well, all but eradicating Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism in China, and his persecution of the growing Nestorian Christian churches sent Chinese Christianity into a decline from which it never recovered. =King Langdarma of Tibet= Langdarma was a Tibetan King, who reigned from 838-841 CE. He is believed to have been anti-Buddhist and a follower of the B√∂n religion. =Oirat Mongols= The Oirats (Western Mongols) converted to Tibetan Buddhism around 1615. The Dzungars were a confederation of several Oirat tribes that emerged suddenly in the early 17th century. The Dzungar Khanate was the last great nomadic empire in Asia. In the 18th century, the Dzungars were annihilated by Qianlong Emperor in several campaigns. About 80% of the Dzungar population, or around 500,000 to 800,000 people, were killed during or after the Zunghar Genocide by Manchu Bannermen and Khalkha Mongols during the Manchu conquest in 1755‚Äì1757.Michael Edmund Clarke, In the Eye of Power (doctoral thesis), Brisbane 2004, p37 The Kalmyk Khanate was founded in the 17th century with Tibetan Buddhism as its main religion, following the earlier migration of the Oirats from Dzungaria through Central Asia to the steppe around the mouth of the Volga River. During the course of the 18th century, they were absorbed by the Russian Empire, which was then expanding to the south and east. The Russian Orthodox church pressured many Kalmyks to adopt Orthodoxy. In the winter of 1770‚Äì1771, about 300,000 Kalmyks set out to return to China. Their goal was to retake control of Dzungaria from the Qing dynasty of China. Along the way many were attacked and killed by Kazakhs and Kyrgyz, their historical enemies based on intertribal competition for land, and many more died of starvation and disease. After several months of travel, only one-third of the original group reached Dzungaria and had no choice but to surrender to the Qing upon arrival. Persecutions by Islamic Empires = Arab invasions = Qutaybah ibn Muslim, the Arab general of Khorasan conquered a number of territories in Central Asia including Samarkand where he broke a number of images. Several instances of Buddhist shrines being destroyed by the advancing Muslims are recorded though the religion continued to survive in some places for a considerable period of time. Bertolf Spuler cites the writings of Narshakhi while stating that the residents of Bukhara had reconverted from Islam to Buddhism four times until it was conquered by Qutayba in 712‚Äì13. A mosque was built in the city in place of a Buddhist monastery. Buddhists continued to live there until the tenth century. Similarly, Buddhism continued to exist in other places like Old Bukhara, Simingan in southern Tukharistan, Bamiyan and Kabul with suburbs inhabited by \\"Indians\\" which were also home to Buddhists. However, the religion could no longer develop as a power or distribute propaganda and its adherents also had to abandon the conversion of peoples in these regions. Scholars like Richard Nelson Frye have doubted the story of Marshaki, pointing out that unlike its statement, Qutayba ibn Muslim didn't live during the time of Umayyad Caliph Mu'awiya, as this story suggests, but rather much later.The History of Bukhara by Narshaki (Tras. Richard Nelson Fyre), Commentary, Pg 137 In addition to discrimination, emigration, and the conversion of the laity, Buddhism and its monasteries also declined with the Muslims taking over the trade along the Silk Road as well as in Sindh. During their conquest of Sindh, the Arabs brought the non-Muslims into the category of ahl al-kitab, considering them ahl al-dhimmah (protected subjects) and thus practicing a certain amount of non-interference in their religious lives under the condition that they fulfil a number of obligations that came with this status. Since both Buddhism and Hinduism are literate religions with scriptures, the precedent of assimilating Zoroastrians into the category of ahl al-kitab was extended to them as well. The dhimmis were obligated to pay the jizya for following their ancestral religion. The historian Al-Baladhuri notes a decision by Muhammad bin Qasim in relation to a Buddhist vihara and Aror that after conquering the city through a treaty (sulh) he agreed not to kill the people and enter their temple, in addition to imposing kharaj on them. The Buddhists had petitioned the Arabs for the right to restore one of their temples and it was granted by Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf. However, this decision was later violated by the Pact of Umar and subsequent Muslim law codes which prohibited the restoration of existing non-Muslim religious structures as well as the building of new ones. Despite this fact, Buddhist inscriptions were still being recorded in the eleventh century. Some Buddhists also fled and emigrated from Muslim-ruled areas into other regions. Unlike Brahmanical worship, Buddhism rapidly declined in Sindh after the eighth century and it virtually disappeared by the eleventh century. The Arabs conquered Balkh which was a centre of Buddhism. Many people in Balkh were sympathetic to Buddhism after the conquest and they were harshly denounced by adherents of Islamic orthodoxy. The Buddhist monastery of Nava Vihara which had become a symbol of national resistance was damaged under Muawiyah I in 663. The Arabs allowed the non-Muslims to practice their religion as long as they paid the poll-tax called jizya. In addition to the destruction of Buddhist temples, part of the old city was also destroyed during the Arab conquest. Nava Vihara continued to remain open according to historical accounts. Along with it, many other viharas evidently continued to function in Central Asia for at least a century after the Arab conquests. Al-Biruni records the existence of the religion and its monasteries in the early eleventh century. The eighth-century Korean traveller Hui'Chao records Hinayanists in Balkh under Arab rule. The city was reduced to ruins by 705 as a result of frequent revolts. It is visible from some copper-plate inscriptions that some Buddhists had moved to other domains. Al-Ma'mun (r. 813-833 A.D.) while visiting Khorasan, launched an attack on Kabul, whose ruler submitted to taxation.RC Majumdar (ed), History of Bengal, Dacca, 1943 The king of Kabul was captured and he then converted to Islam. Per sources, when the Shah submitted to al-Ma'mun, he sent his crown and bejeweled throne, later seen by the Meccan historian al-Azraqi to the Caliph who praised Fadl for \\"curbing polytheists, breaking idols, killing the refractory\\" and refers to his successes against Kabul's king and ispahabad. Other near-contemporary sources however refer to the artifacts as a golden jewel-encrusted idol sitting on a silver throne by the Hindu Shahi ruler or by an unnamed ruler of \\"Tibet\\" as a sign of his conversion to Islam. = India = According to Lars Fogelin, the Decline of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent is \\"not a singular event, with a singular cause; it was a centuries-long process.\\"Fogelin, Lars, An Archaeological History of Indian Buddhism, Oxford University Press, p. 218. Various personages involved in the revival of Buddhism in India such as Anagarika Dharmapala and The Mahabodhi Movement of the 1890s as well as Dr. B. R. Ambedkar hold the Muslim Rule in India responsible for the decay of Buddhism in India.The Maha-Bodhi By Maha Bodhi Society, Calcutta (page 205)The Maha-Bodhi By Maha Bodhi Society, Calcutta (page 58)The Philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi: And Other Essays, Philosophical and Sociological by Ardeshir Ruttonji Wadia (page 483)B.R. Ambedkar: Writings and Speeches, vol.3, p.229-230. In 1193, Qutb-ud-din Aybak, the founder of the Delhi Sultanate and first Muslim ruler in India, left defenseless the northeastern territories that were the heart of Buddhist India. The Mahabodhi Temple was almost completely destroyed by the invading Muslim forces. One of Qutb-ud-Din's generals, Ikhtiar Uddin Muhammad Bin Bakhtiyar Khilji, who later becomes the first Muslim ruler of Bengal and Bihar, invaded Magadha and destroyed the Buddhist shrines and institutions at Nalanda, Vikramasila and Odantapuri, which declined the practice of Buddhism in East India.The Maha-Bodhi by Maha Bodhi Society, Calcutta (page 8) Many monuments of ancient Indian civilization were destroyed by the invading armies, including Buddhist sanctuaries near Benares. Buddhist monks who escaped the massacre fled to Nepal, Tibet and South India.Islam at War: A History by Mark W. Walton, George F. Nafziger, Laurent W. Mbanda (page 226) Tamerlane destroyed Buddhist establishments and raided areas in which Buddhism had flourished.Sir Aurel Stein: Archaeological Explorer by Jeannette MirskyEthnicity & Family Therapy edited by Nydia Garcia-Preto, Joe Giordano, Monica McGoldrick Mughal rule also contributed to the decline of Buddhism. They are reported to have destroyed many Hindu temples and Buddhist shrines alike or converted many sacred Hindu places into Muslim shrines and mosques.War at the Top of the World: The Struggle for Afghanistan, Kashmir, and Tibet by Eric S. Margolis page 165 Mughal rulers like Aurangzeb destroyed Buddhist temples and monasteries and replaced them with mosques.Buddhism and Dalits: Social Philosophy and Traditions, by C. D. Naik, 2010, Page 35 = Others = The Saffarids had sent looted Buddhist and Hindu icons to the Abbasids as gifts. The Mongol ruler Ghazan called on Buddhists to convert to Islam or leave the Ilkhanate and ordered their temples to be destroyed, but he later adopted a slightly less severe position. Though he had earlier supported their persecution as well as the persecution of other non-Muslims, his religious policies changed after the death of Nowruz with punishments imposed on perpetrators of religious intolerance and attempts to restore relations with non-Muslims. Although the religion survived there, it never recovered from the assault by Ghazan. =Xinjiang= The historical area of what is modern day Xinjiang consisted of the distinct areas of the Tarim Basin and Dzungaria, and was originally populated by Indo-European Tocharian and Iranic Saka peoples who practiced the Buddhist religion. The area was subjected to Turkification and Islamification at the hands of invading Turkic Muslims. Conquest of Buddhist Khotan The Islamic attacks and conquest of the Buddhist cities east of Kashgar was started by the Turkic Karakhanid Satok Bughra Khan who in 966 converted to Islam and many tales emerged about the Karakhanid ruling family's war against the Buddhists, Satok Bughra Khan's nephew or grandson Ali Arslan was slain by the Buddhists during the war. Buddhism lost territory to Islam during the Karakhanid reign around the Kashgar area. A long war ensued between Islamic Kashgar and Buddhist Khotan which eventually ended in the conquest of Khotan by Kashgar. Iranic Saka peoples originally inhabited Yarkand and Kashgar in ancient times. The Buddhist Iranic Saka Kingdom of Khotan was the only city-state that was not conquered yet by the Turkic Uyghur (Buddhist) and the Turkic Qarakhanid (Muslim) states and its ruling family used Indian names and the population were devout Buddhists. The Buddhist entitites of Dunhuang and Khotan had a tight-knit partnership, with intermarriage between Dunhuang and Khotan's rulers and Dunhuang's Mogao grottos and Buddhist temples being funded and sponsored by the Khotan royals, whose likenesses were drawn in the Mogao grottoes. The rulers of Khotan were aware of the menace they faced since they arranged for the Mogao grottoes to paint a growing number of divine figures along with themselves. Halfway in the 20th century Khotan came under attack by the Qarakhanid ruler Musa, and in what proved to be a pivotal moment in the Turkification and Islamification of the Tarim Basin, the Karakhanid leader Yusuf Qadir Khan conquered Khotan around 1006. The Ta·∫ïkirah is a genre of literature written about Sufi Muslim saints in Altishahr. Written sometime in the period from 1700‚Äì1849, the Eastern Turkic language (modern Uyghur) Ta·∫ïkirah of the Four Sacrificed Imams provides an account of the Muslim Karakhanid war against the Khotanese Buddhists, containing a story about Imams, from Mada'in city (possibly in modern-day Iraq) came 4 Imams who traveled to help the Islamic conquest of Khotan, Yarkand, and Kashgar by Yusuf Qadir Khan, the Qarakhanid leader. Accounts of the battles waged by the invading Muslims upon the indigenous Buddhists takes up most of the Ta·∫ïkirah with descriptions such as \\"blood flows like the Oxus\\", \\"heads litter the battlefield like stones\\" being used to describe the murderous battles over the years until the \\"infidels\\" were defeated and driven towards Khotan by Yusuf Qadir Khan and the four Imams, but the Imams were assassinated by the Buddhists prior to the last Muslim victory so Yusuf Qadir Khan assigned Khizr Baba, who was born in Khotan but whose mother originated from western Turkestan's Mawarannahr, to take care of the shrine of the 4 Imams at their tomb and after Yusuf Qadir Khan's conquest of new land in Altishahr towards the east, he adopted the title \\"King of the East and China\\". Due to the Imams deaths in battle and burial in Khotan, Altishahr, despite their foreign origins, they are viewed as local saints by the current Muslim population in the region. Muslim works such as ·∏§ud≈´d al- øƒÄlam contained anti-Buddhist rhetoric and polemic against Buddhist Khotan, aimed at \\"dehumanizing\\" the Khotanese Buddhists, and the Muslims Kara-Khanids conquered Khotan just 26 years following the completion of ·∏§ud≈´d al- øƒÄlam. Muslims gouged the eyes of Buddhist murals along Silk Road caves and Kashgari recorded in his Turkic dictionary an anti-Buddhist poem/folk song. Satuq Bughra Khan and his son directed endeavors to proselytize Islam among the Turks and engage in military conquests. The Islamic conquest of Khotan led to alarm in the east and Dunhuang's Cave 17, which contained Khotanese literary works, was closed shut possibly after its caretakers heard that Khotan's Buddhist buildings were razed by the Muslims, and Khotan had suddenly ceased to be Buddhist. In 1006, the Muslim Kara-Khanid ruler Yusuf Kadir (Qadir) Khan of Kashgar conquered Khotan, ending Khotan's existence as an independent state. The war was described as a Muslim Jihad (holy war) by the Japanese Professor Takao Moriyasu. The Karakhanid Turkic Muslim writer Mahmud al-Kashgari recorded a short Turkic language poem about the conquest: English translation: > We came down on them like a flood, We went out among their cities, We tore > down the idol-temples, We shat on the Buddha's head! In Turkic: > k√§lginl√§y√º aqt√Øm√Øz k√§ndl√§r √ºz√§ ƒç√Øqt√Øm√Øz furxan √§vin y√Øqt√Øm√Øz burxan √ºz√§ > s√Øƒçt√Øm√Øz Idols of \\"infidels\\" were subjected to desecration by being defecated upon by Muslims when the \\"infidel\\" country was conquered by the Muslims, according to Muslim tradition. Islamic conquest of the Buddhist Uighurs The Buddhist Uyghurs of the Kingdom of Qocho and Turfan were converted to Islam by conquest during a ghazat (holy war) at the hands of the Muslim Chagatai Khizr Khwaja. Kara Del was a Mongolian ruled and Uighur populated Buddhist Kingdom. The Muslim Chagatai Khan Mansur invaded and used the sword to make the population convert to Islam. After being converted to Islam, the descendants of the previously Buddhist Uyghurs in Turfan failed to retain memory of their ancestral legacy and falsely believed that the \\"infidel Kalmuks\\" (Dzungars) were the ones who built Buddhist monuments in their area. Persecution by militaristic regimes =Imperial Japan= Buddhist monks were forced to return to the laity, Buddhist property was confiscated, Buddhist institutions were closed, and Buddhist schools were reorganized under state control in the name of modernizing Japan during the early Meiji period.James Edward Ketelaar, Of Heretics and Martyrs in Meiji Japan; The state-control of Buddhism was part of Imperial Japanese policy both at home and abroad in Korea and other conquered territories.Brian Victoria, Zen War Stories, =Persecution in Burma= The Burmese government has attempted to control Buddhist institutions through coercive means, including the intimidation, torture, and murder of monks. Translated by Ko Kyaw Ye Aung After monks played an active role in the protest movements against the then-ruling socialist military dictatorship and later the then-ruling military dictatorship in 1988 during the Fall of Socialism and 2007, the state cracked down on Buddhist monks and monasteries. Persecution by nationalist political parties =Persecution in the Republic of China under the Kuomintang= During the Northern Expedition, in 1926 in Guangxi, Kuomintang Muslim General Bai Chongxi led his troops in destroying Buddhist temples and smashing idols, turning the temples into schools and Kuomintang party headquarters. It was reported that almost all Buddhist monasteries in Guangxi were destroyed by Bai in this manner. The monks were removed. Bai led a wave of anti foreignism in Guangxi, attacking Americans, Europeans, and other foreigners and missionaries, and generally making the province unsafe for foreigners. Westerners fled from the province, and some Chinese Christians were also attacked as imperialist agents. The three goals of his movement were anti-foreignism, anti-imperialism, and anti- religion. Bai led the anti-religious movement, against superstition. Muslims do not believe in superstition (see Shirk (Islam)) and his religion may have influenced Bai to take action against the Idols in the temples and the superstitious practices rampant in China. Huang Shaoxiong, also a Kuomintang member of the New Guangxi Clique, supported Bai's campaign, and Huang was not a Muslim, the anti religious campaign was agreed upon by all Guangxi Kuomintang members. During the Kuomintang Pacification of Qinghai the Muslim General Ma Bufang destroyed Tibetan Buddhist monasteries with support from the Kuomintang government. Ma served as a general in the National Revolutionary Army, and sought to expand the Republic of China's control over all of Qinghai, as well as the possibility of bringing Tibet back into the Republic by force. When Ma Bufang launched seven expeditions into Golog, killing thousands of Tibetans, the Republic of China government, known as the Kuomintang, supported Ma Bufang. Ma was highly anti-communist, and he and his army wiped out many Tibetans in the northeast and eastern Qinghai, and destroyed Tibetan Buddhist temples. Persecution by Muslims =Afghanistan= The Muslim Mughal emperor, Aurangzeb, tried to use heavy artillery to destroy the statues. Another attempt to destroy the Bamiyan statues was made by the 18th century Persian king Nader Afshar, who directed cannon fire at them.Asian Art, chap. \\"History of attacks on the Buddhas\\" The enormous statues, the male Salsal (\\"light shines through the universe\\") and the (smaller) female Shamama (\\"Queen Mother\\"), as they were called by the locals, did not fail to fire the imagination of Islamic writers in centuries past. The larger statue reappears as the malevolent giant Salsal in medieval Turkish tales.Laban Kaptein, Eindtijd en Antichrist, p. 127. Leiden 1997. Afghan Muslim King Abdur Rahman Khan destroyed its face during a military campaign against the Shia Hazara rebellion. A Frenchman named Dureau had pictured it in 1847. The Bamiyan Buddhas were destroyed by the fundamentalist Islamist Taliban regime in 2001 in defiance of worldwide condemnation. The statues were blown up and fired upon by rockets and gunfire. Excavators at the Buddhist site of Mes Aynak have been denounced as \\"promoting Buddhism\\" and threatened by the Taliban and many of the Afghan excavators who are working for purely financial reasons don't feel any connection to the Buddhist artifacts. =Pakistan= Swat Valley in Pakistan has many Buddhist carvings, stupas and Jehanabad contains a Seated Buddha statue. Kushan era Buddhist stupas and statues in Swat valley were demolished by the Taliban and after two attempts by the Taliban, the Jehanabad Buddha's face was dynamited. Only the Bamiyan Buddhas were larger than the carved giant Buddha status in Swat near Mangalore which the Taliban attacked. The government did nothing to safeguard the statue after the initial attempt at destroying the Buddha, which did not cause permanent harm, and when the second attack took place on the statue the feet, shoulders, and face were demolished. Islamists such as the Taliban and looters destroyed much of Pakistan's Buddhist artifacts left over from the Buddhist Gandhara civilization especially in Swat Valley. The Taliban deliberately targeted Gandhara Buddhist relics for destruction. The Christian Archbishop of Lahore Lawrence John Saldanha wrote a letter to Pakistan's government denouncing the Taliban activities in Swat Valley including their destruction of Buddha statues and their attacks on Christians, Sikhs, and Hindus. Gandhara Buddhist artifacts were illegally looted by smugglers. A rehabilitation attempt on the Buddha was made by Luca Olivieri from Italy. A group of Italians helped repair the Buddha. =Bangladesh= In Bangladesh, the persecution of the indigenous tribes of the Chittagong Hill Tracts such as the Chakma, Marma, Tripura and others who are mainly Buddhists, Hindus, Christians, and Animists, has been described as genocidal. The Chittagong Hill Tracts are located bordering India, Myanmar and the Bay of Bengal, and is the home to 500,000 indigenous people. The perpetrators of are the Bangladeshi military and the Bengali Muslim settlers, who together have burned down Buddhist and Hindu temples, killed many Chakmas, and carried out a policy of gang-rape against the indigenous people. There are also accusations of Chakmas being forced to convert to Islam, many of them children who have been abducted for this purpose. The conflict started soon after Bangladeshi independence in 1972 when the Constitution imposed Bengali as the sole official language, Islam as the state religion - with no cultural or linguistic rights to minority populations. Subsequently, the government encouraged and sponsored massive settlement by Bangladeshis in region, which changed the demographics from 98 percent indigenous in 1971 to fifty percent by 2000. The government allocated a full third of the Bangladeshi military to the region to support the settlers, sparking a protracted guerilla war between Hill tribes and the military. During this conflict which officially ended in 1997, and in the subsequent period, a large number of human rights violations against the indigenous peoples have been reported, with violence against indigenous women being particularly extreme. Bengali settlers and soldiers have raped native Jumma (Chakma) women \\"with impunity\\" with the Bangladeshi security forces doing little to protect the Jummas and instead assisting the rapists and settlers. The Karuna Bihar Buddhist temple was attacked by Bengali settlers. During the 2012 Ramu violence a 25,000-strong mob set fire to at least five temples and dozens of homes throughout the town and surrounding villages after seeing a picture of an allegedly desecrated Quran, which they claimed had been posted on Facebook by Uttam Barua, a local Buddhist man. =India= The Ladakh Buddhist Association has said: \\"There is a deliberate and organised design to convert Kargil's Buddhists to Islam. In the last four years, about 50 girls and married women with children were taken and converted from village Wakha alone. If this continues unchecked, we fear that Buddhists will be wiped out from Kargil in the next two decades or so. Anyone objecting to such allurement and conversions is harassed.\\"Tundup Tsering and Tsewang Nurboo, in: Ladakh visited, Pioneer, 4/12/1995. =Maldives= The destruction of the Buddhist artifacts by Islamists took place on the day in which Mohamed Nasheed was toppled as president in a coup. Buddhist antiquities were obliterated by Islamist radicals in the National Museum. The Museum was stormed by Islamists who destroyed the Buddhist artifacts. The non Muslim artifacts of Buddhist provenance were specifically singled out by the attackers. The destruction was caught on camera. Most of Maldive's Buddhist physical history was obliterated. Hindu artifacts were also targeted for obliteration and the actions have been compared to the attacks on the Buddhas of Bamiyan by the Taliban. 7 February 2012 was the date of the anti-Buddhist attack by the Islamists. =Myanmar= The violence and long lasting tension was reignited on 28 May 2012. It was reported that daughter of U Hla Tin, of Thabyechaung Village named Ma Thida Htwe aged 27 was raped then killed by three Muslim men. These men were later arrested. Tensions between Buddhist and Muslim ethnic groups flared into violent clashes in Meiktila, Mandalay Division in 2013. The violence started on 20 March after a Muslim gold shop owner, his wife, and two Muslim employees assaulted a Buddhist customer and her husband in an argument over a golden hairpin. A large Buddhist mob formed and began to destroy the shop. The heavily outnumbered police reportedly told the mob to disperse after they had destroyed the shop. On the same day, a local Buddhist monk passing on the back of a motorbike was attacked by four Muslims. According to witnesses, the driver was attacked with a sword, causing him to crash, while the monk was also hit in the head with the sword. Per a witness, one of the men doused the monk with fuel and burnt him alive. The monk died in the hospital. The killing of the monk caused the relatively contained situation to explode, greatly increasing intensity and violence. = Thailand = Primarily Buddhist Thailand has been involved in a fight with Muslim insurgents in the South. Buddhists have been beheaded and clergy and teachers are frequently threatened with death. Shootings of Buddhists are quite frequent in the South, as are bombings, and attacks on religious establishments. =Xinjiang= During the Kumul Rebellion in Xinjiang in the 1930s, Buddhist murals were deliberately vandalized by Muslims. Buddhist murals at the Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves were damaged by local Muslim population whose religion proscribed figurative images of sentient beings, the eyes and mouths in particular were often gouged out. Pieces of murals were also broken off for use as fertilizer by the locals. Uyghur Muslim opposition to a Buddhist Aspara statue in √úr√ºmqi in Xinjiang was cited as a possible reason for its destruction in 2012. A Muslim Kazakh viewed a giant Buddha statue near √úr√ºmqi as \\"alien cultural symbols\\".  Persecution by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam Supporters  = Australia = After the defeat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 2009, acid was thrown on two Sinhalese men. The attack was linked to the son of a local LTTE supporter Tamils. = India = In 2013, a Sri Lankan Buddhist monk, on a study tour at the Big Temple in Thanjavur, was assaulted by a few individuals beloning to Tamils organizations Naam Tamilar Katchi and the Thamizh Desiya Podhuvudamai Katchi, which were supporters of LTTE. Eleven persons were arrested by the police. = Sri Lanka = During the Sri Lankan Civil War, Buddhists were the victims of many terrorist attacks perpetrated by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which was made up of mostly Hindus but consisted of Christians too. During this period, the pinnacle of Buddhists; the Temple of the Tooth, where the sacred tooth relic of the Lord Buddha is kept and worshiped was attacked by the LTTE. Seventeen people, including a 2-year old, were killed in the incident. In the Anuradhapura massacre, LTTE cadres drove to the Sri Maha Bodhi shrine and gunned down nuns, monks and civilians as they were worshipping inside the Buddhist shrine. 146 Sinhalese men, women and children were killed in Anuradhapura. The Aranthalawa Massacre was the killing of 33 Buddhist monks and four civilians by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The sacred Bo tree that relates to the Acetic tree, under which the Buddha attained Buddhahood was also attacked by the said terrorist group, killing around three hundred pilgrims. Persecution by Christians = India = The National Socialist Council of Nagaland has been accused of demanding money and food from Buddhists living along the Assam- Arunachal border. It has also been accused by Buddhists of forcing locals to convert to Christianity. The NSCN is also suspected of burning down the Rangphra temple in Arunachal Pradesh. The National Liberation Front of Tripura has shut down and attacked Hindu and Buddhist orphanages, hospitals, temples and schools in Tripura. They have also been accused of force converting Buddhists to Christianity. A mass scale ethnic riot was initiated by the Baptist Church in Tripura in 1980 by which both Hindu and Buddhist tribes faced systematic ethnic cleansing. Thousands of women kidnapped and then raped and even forced to convert to Christianity. Reports state that the terrorists received aid from international Christian groups. The Christian tribals also received aid from the NLFT. This was the state's worst ethnic riot. =South Korea= Some South Korean Buddhists have denounced what they view as discriminatory measures against them and their religion by the administration of President Lee Myung-bak, which they attribute to Lee's membership in the Somang Presbyterian Church in Seoul. The Buddhist Jogye Order has accused the Lee government of discriminating against Buddhism and favoring Christianity by ignoring certain Buddhist temples but including Christian churches in certain public documents. In 2006, according to the Asia Times, \\"Lee also sent a video prayer message to a Christian rally held in the southern city of Busan in which the worship leader prayed feverishly: 'Lord, let the Buddhist temples in this country crumble down!'\\" Further, according to an article in Buddhist- Christian Studies: \\"Over the course of the last decade [1990s] a fairly large number of Buddhist temples in South Korea have been destroyed or damaged by fire by misguided Christian fundamentalists. More recently, Buddhist statues have been identified as idols, and attacked and decapitated in the name of Jesus. Arrests are hard to effect, as the arsonists and vandals work by stealth of night.\\" A 2008 incident in which police investigated protesters who had been given sanctuary in the Jogye temple in Seoul and searched a car driven by Jigwan, executive chief of the Jogye order, led to protests by Buddhists who claimed that police had treated Jigwan as a criminal. In March 2009, in an effort to reach out to Buddhists affected by recent events, the President and First Lady participated in a Korean Buddhist conference where he and his wife were seen joining palms in prayer during chanting along with participants. The discomfort among the Buddhists has gradually decreased since then. =Sri Lanka= Under British rule, Christians were openly favoured for jobs and promotions. Robert Inglis, a 19th-century British Conservative, likened Buddhism to \\"idolatry\\" during a parliamentary debate over the relationship of \\"Buddhist priests\\" to the British colonial government, in 1852.Hansard, 3rd Series, cxxiii, 713‚Äì714. During the Sri Lankan Civil War, Buddhists were the victims of many terrorist attacks perpetrated by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, which was made up of mostly Hindus but consisted of Christians too. During this period, the pinnacle of Buddhists; the Temple of the Tooth, where the sacred tooth relic of the Lord Buddha is kept and worshiped was attacked by the LTTE. The sacred Bo tree that relates to the Acetic tree, under which the Buddha attained Buddhahood was also attacked by the said terrorist group, killing around three hundred pilgrims. =Vietnam= As early as 1953 rumoured allegations had surfaced of discrimination against Buddhists in Vietnam. These allegations stated that Catholic Vietnamese armed by the French had been raiding villages. By 1961, the shelling of pagodas in Vietnam was being reported in the Australian and American media.Errors Escalated Too NY Times Books - 16 May 1965. After the Catholic Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám came to power in South Vietnam, backed by the United States, he favoured his relatives and co-religionists over Buddhists. Though Buddhists made up 80% of Vietnam's population, Catholics were given high positions in the army and civil service. Half of the 123 National Assembly members were Catholic. Buddhists also required special government permits to hold large meetings, a stipulation generally made for meetings of trade unions. In May 1963, the government forbade the flying of Buddhist flags on Vesak. After Buddhist protesters clashed with government troops, nine people were killed. In protest, the Buddhist monk Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ª©c burned himself to death in Saigon. On August 21, the X√° L·ª£i Pagoda raids led to a death toll estimated in the hundreds Persecution in Nepal The banishment of Buddhist monks from Nepal was part of a Rana government campaign to suppress the resurgence of Theravada Buddhism in Nepal in the early decades of the 20th century. There were two deportations of monks from Kathmandu, in 1926 and 1944. The exiled monks were the first group of monks to be seen in Nepal since the 14th century. They were at the forefront of a movement to revive Theravada Buddhism which had disappeared from the country more than five hundred years ago. The Rana regime disapproved of Buddhism and Nepal Bhasa, the mother tongue of the Newar people. It saw the activities of the monks and their growing following as a threat. When police harassment and imprisonment failed to deter the monks, all of whom were Newars, they were deported. Among the charges made against them were preaching a new faith, converting Hindus, encouraging women to renounce and thereby undermining family life and writing books in Nepal Bhasa.LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N. (2005). Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal. Harvard University Press. , . Page 48. Persecution under Communism =Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge= The Khmer Rouge, under its policy of state atheism, actively imposed an atheistic agrarian revolution, resulting in the persecution of ethnic minorities and Buddhist monks during their reign from 1975 to 1979. Buddhist institutions and temples were destroyed and Buddhist monks and teachers were killed in large numbers. A third of the nation's monasteries were destroyed along with numerous holy texts and items of high artistic quality. 25,000 Buddhist monks were massacred by the regime.Philip Shenon, Phnom Penh Journal; Lord Buddha Returns, With Artists His Soldiers The New York Times - 2 January 1992 Pol Pot believed that Buddhism was a decadent affectation, and he sought to eliminate its 1,500-year-old mark on Cambodia, while still maintaining the structures of the traditional Buddhist base. =China= Since the communist revolution, Buddhism was severely restricted and brought under state-control at times. In addition, \\"Marxist-Leninist atheism has been widely publicized, resulting in steadily decreasing religious communities\\", especially in areas with developed economies. In 1989, less than 12% of the population held religious beliefs. During the Cultural Revolution, Buddhists were actively persecuted and sent for re-education, and temples, statues, and sutras were vandalized and destroyed.

It is the first track on their 1969 album Soundtrack from the Film More. The song would later be released on the compilation album Relics. Writing and recording The song is 5 minutes 18 seconds long. It was written by Roger Waters and performed by David Gilmour on vocals and guitar and Rick Wright on organ. The song has a hallucinogenic, pastoral quality, with prominent organ and bird sound effects, like those later that year featured on the Ummagumma track \\"Grantchester Meadows\\". It was also included on Pink Floyd's compilation album Relics. The song features no drums, which creates a rather unusual feeling. The Hammond and Farfisa organ coda is similar to that found on the \\"Celestial Voices\\" section of \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\". While the Hammond provides a stately foundation with an Em-Bm-D-A-G-D-B sequence, about 1/4 way into the coda Wright introduces the Farfisa which, run through a Binson Echorec platter echo, produces the swirly, trembly, echoey sound that hovers over the Hammond. The opening birdsong is from a 1961 recording entitled \\"Dawn Chorus\\" and the single bird featured over the organ part is a nightingale also from 1961. Both featured on an HMV sound effects single (together with a recording of owls) but presumably the band just borrowed the originals from the EMI sound effects library as EMI owned HMV. Music \\"Cirrus Minor\\" has an unusual chord sequence: E minor, E flat augmented, G major, C# minor 7, C major 7, C minor 7 and B 7. The chords are built around the chromatically descending bass line. The B 7, C major 7 and G major chords are the only chords which fit into the functional context of the E minor key.

'Butterfly Kimono', woodcut by Hiroki Morinoue, 2006 Early life Morinoue was born in Kealakekua and raised near Holualoa, formerly a major coffee plantation town in the mountains above Kailua-Kona on the Big Island of Hawaii. Japanese workers were imported from Japan at the turn of the 20th century to Hawaii to work the plantations. Although the coffee plantations are gone, Holualoa remains a major producer and exporter of Kona coffee from a cooperative of private growers. In addition, a large artist colony has taken hold in the town itself. Education Morinoue studied at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland, California, where he received his BFA degree. Later, while in Japan, Morinoue studied with a master sumi-e artist and a master of woodblock printing. Morinoue still makes his home in Holualoa, on the Big Island of Hawaii. Works It was Morinoue's seemingly abstract paintings of calm water on textured wood or woodblock prints that propelled him to prominence. The play of light on pebbles at the bottom of a creek or pond, bubbles, ripples, or the reflection on the surface of water are combined with a Japanese sense of balance and design in intense shades of aqua, black and blue creating art of refined, serene elegance. Subsequent works show a trend towards abstract art, experimentation in warmer palettes, rougher strokes, various subject matters and media such as ceramics and photography. Hiroki Morinoue can be seen in several public and private collections in the USA (particularly in Hawaii) and Japan.

It is made up of the three parts Handlov√°, Nov√° Lehota and Morovno. Geography It is located in the Handlovka brook valley, surrounded by the mountain ranges of Vt√°ƒçnik in the west and ≈Ωiar in the south, east and north, in the historical region of Hauerland. It is away from Prievidza and from ≈Ωiar nad Hronom. Besides the main settlement, it also has \\"parts\\" of Morovno (north-west) and Nov√° Lehota (south), both annexed 1976. History The town was established in 1376 and was inhabited by German settlers which were later known as the Carpathian Germans. The first known settler in Handlov√° was Peter Kricker from Kremnica, who came here together with 200 others to establish a settlement on a site called Kr√°sny les (Beautiful Forest). At first the settlers lived just from crops and pastoral farming. Only much later, in the 18th century, did coal mining begin. Local miners at first worked mainly to supply the needs of nearby Bojnice Castle. In 1945 after World War II, Handlov√° underwent the biggest upheaval in its centuries-long history. Most of its ethnic German inhabitants was expelled from the town due to the so-called Bene≈° decrees. Of the original 12,800 people who lived here as late as in 1943, only 4,000 remained in Handlov√° by 1945. As a result, Handlov√°'s character changed completely. It received town privileges in 1960. In 2009, the town suffered a major disaster during the 2009 Handlov√° mine blast, in which 20 people were killed. Demographics According to the 2001 census, the town had 18,018 inhabitants. 96.14% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 0.85% Hungarian, 0.67% Czechs and 0.24% Germans.

It was a programme picture produced by the Nikkatsu Company to fill out the second half of a double bill with Shohei Imamura's The Insect Woman. The film was based on a novel by Taiko Hirabayashi and had been previously adapted to the screen as Song from the Underworld (1956) by Suzuki's mentor, Hiroshi Noguchi. The story involves Katsuta, a yakuza member who falls in love and is torn between giri (duty) and ninjo (humanity). The Kanto of the title refers to a large plain on which Tokyo is located. Plot Three schoolgirls are infatuated with a yakuza, Katsuta, of the Izu Clan. They meet another yakuza, \\"Diamond\\" Fuyu, of the rival Yoshida clan. As he gets a tattoo, two of the girls become squeamish and run off but Hanako, the best friend of the daughter of Sota Izu, boss of the Izu clan, stays to watch. She is intrigued with the yakuza world. Fuyu takes her to an illegal gambling den where Tetsu, a dealer, takes a liking to her. The police raid the den and Hanako is arrested but let off with a warning. Later, Tetsu runs into Hanako on the street and convinces her to help him pull a variant of the badger game, a scam in which, with the promise of sex, she is to lure a man to a hotel room where Tetsu will extort money from him by threat of blackmail. The scam fails when the man chases Testu off and Hanako is left stranded with the man. Katsuta chances upon Tatsuko, a con artist who he had encountered four years earlier when he had exposed her and her partner in a scam. Her partner had slashed him across the face in their escape and he bore the resulting scar in fond remembrance of her. Word that Hanako has gone missing reaches Katsuta and he inquires as to her whereabouts from Tetsu who feigns ignorance. They search for her without success and end up at a hotel. Katsuta suspects a gambling game there is fixed, but Tetsu insists on partaking and Katsuta follows. He again meets Tatsuko whose husband, Hachi Okaru, is winning the game by looking at the cards in the reflection of a cigarette case. When the others leave Okaru challenges Katsuta to a game and wins again by cheating. Diamond, who was in hiding with Tatsuko, his sister, emerges and demands to know what happened to Hanako, but Katsuta cannot tell him. Katsuta and Tatsuko fight their feelings for one another. Tensions rise between the Izu and Yoshida clan and Sato Izu begins to suspect Katsuta of disloyalty. Katsuta murders a group of rude gambler parlor attendees. Realizing he has nothing left to lose, he slays his way to a rival boss, demanding he give his fealty to Izu. When Izu is killed by Fuyu making Katsuta's earlier actions moot, Katsuta states his actions were nonetheless honorable. Cast * Akira Kobayashi as Mitsuo Katsuta * Chieko Matsubara as Tokiko Izu * Daizaburo Hirata as \\"Diamond\\" Fuyu * Hiroko It≈ç as Tatsuko Iwata * Sanae Nakahara as Hanako Yamada * Chikako Shin as Matsue Ichikawa * Taiji Tonoyama as Sota Izu * Toru Abe as Dairyu Yoshida * Keisuke Noro as Tetsu Bikkuri * Y≈´nosuke It≈ç as Hachi Okaru Production The Nikkatsu Company assigned Kanto Wanderer to contract director Seijun Suzuki. It was his first ninkyo eiga, or chivalry film. It was also a programme picture, a quickly made, low-budget film, designed to be screened after Shohei Imamura's The Insect Woman. Kanto Wanderer was based on a serial written by Taiko Hirabayashi published in the Asahi Shimbun. Hiroshi Noguchi, Suzuki's mentor,In the Japanese studio system, assistant directors joined a group under an individual director, or mentor, and rarely left that group unless the director died or they were dismissed. They were expected to learn the inner workings of the studio and the habits of their mentor as they advanced through a three-tiered system and were eventually promoted to director. The system began to break down through the 1950s and 1960s and had ended by 1975. had previously adapted the story as Song from the Underworld (1956). Suzuki was apprehensive about remaking a film by Noguchi but his producer Kenz≈ç Asada assured him that it was better a former assistant directed it. Suzuki accepted the assignment on September 24, 1963, and began location scouting the same day. The studio also assigned matin√©e idol Akira Kobayashi and Chieko Matsubara to the lead roles. Suzuki and his collaborators had more sway with the remaining parts. They suggested many actress for the role of Tatsuko Iwata, such as Yoshie Mizutani and Yukiji Asaoka, but all were turned down. Suzuki argued frequently with the studio on the subject. The studio suggested Minako Osanai, a famous television star, but Suzuki warned them against it as he felt her small face would not carry over to the large screen format. Two days before filming was scheduled to begin, art director Takeo Kimura suggested Hiroko It≈ç to Suzuki and she was selected. Shooting began on October 5, on location in Shinagawa. Kobayashi appeared on set wearing what Suzuki later described as Brezhnevian artificial eyebrows. A dismayed Asada told Suzuki, \\"Tell Akira to cut that out.\\" Suzuki suggested they leave them so as not to immediately antagonize Kobayashi and the eyebrows remained. Since the film was to be shown immediately following the main feature, and Suzuki felt that all Nikkatsu films followed the same formula (the lead falls in love, kills the bad guy and gets the girl), he familiarized himself with The Insect Woman's actors, director and his approach and then approached similar scenes from a different angle in Kanto Wanderer. Filming was completed on November 10. The music was completed on the 12th and the dubbing was done over the 13th and 14th.

The AIDG‚Äôs focus is the promotion of affordable and environmentally sound technologies to address gaps in basic services and infrastructure in rural areas of developing countries. The AIDG incubates businesses that provide renewable energy, water, and sanitation technologies to underserved communities, development agencies, and private individuals. The AIDG offers developing world design experience for university students interested in appropriate technology while providing hands-on assistance to rural communities in need.  Target population  The AIDG aims to increase the use of environmentally sound infrastructure among rural agriculturalists who are currently unserved or underserved by large-grid water, electrical, and sanitation infrastructure. The AIDG aims to provide products and services affordable to populations living on under 2 dollars a day.  Programs  The AIDG has three primary programs: business incubation, education, and community outreach. *Business Incubation. AIDG's Business Incubation Program locates engineering talent in developing countries and helps them to form businesses that provide village and home scale renewable energy and sanitation technologies to underserved communities, development agencies, and private individuals. The program provides seed capital, in the form of a recoverable grant, as well as comprehensive technical and logistical support over a two- year incubation period. After this period, interest-free repayments of the recoverable grant are paid back over 15 years and used to start new businesses in other geographic areas and regions. The objective is to use this self- sustaining replication model to create a global network of micro-manufacturing facilities, known as workshops. The staff from previously incubated businesses will train employees at the new workshops to ensure that learning is propagated throughout the network. Workshops are set up as design-build facilities with a diverse product range, capable of adapting to fluctuations in demand and the needs of the local market. Investing in manufacturing facilities ensures that the long-term knowledge and productive resources required to fabricate, install, repair, and innovate much-needed infrastructure technologies are disseminated to the communities and individuals that need them the most. Each workshop facility serves as a focal point for the AIDG's community outreach and education programs in the region. *Education. The AIDG Education Program provides internship opportunities for qualified professionals, undergraduate, and graduate students. This program fosters information exchange between university students and faculty and workers at the AIDG's incubated businesses. Any new product innovations that are developed in concert with the internship program are disseminated to all of the workshops. Through the Project Placement Program, students with novel designs are invited to manufacture and test the designs in one of the AIDG's incubated or post-incubation facilities. Designs are matched with interested communities for ongoing testing, and long-term performance information is relayed back to the student via the Internet. *Outreach. Through the AIDG Outreach Program, workshop employees and volunteers perform infrastructure improvements for rural community organizations, such as schools, hospitals, and community centers. Such projects, while providing needed services, demonstrate the utility of the workshop's products and increase acceptance among the greater population. They help the workshop employees understand the needs of the target populations they are trying to serve. By contracting the workshop to do an outreach project, the AIDG provides a supplemental income stream to the workshop during its incubation period. AIDG outreach projects are the basis for the group's TecoTours service-learning program. Through the TecoTours program, groups of volunteers interested in working in developing countries provide a tax-deductible gift to gain hands-on experience working on outreach projects. This program is an opportunity to develop a constant stream of financial support independent of foundation or grant revenue. Though each program ‚Äî business incubation, education, and outreach ‚Äî is described separately, they are integrated to such a degree that none would be able to function alone. For example, the income generated by the TecoTour program supports the incubated workshops, which in turn provide a working space for employees and international volunteers. Community outreach serves to foster local demand for the workshop's products, while concurrently providing training to workshop employees. The incubated businesses provide a functional environment to run the internship and education programs, while the products from the Project Placement Program aid the research and development of products for the workshop.  Business Incubation: Xela Teco  The AIDG began training at its first micro-manufacturing facility, XelaTeco, in Quetzaltenango (Xela) Guatemala in August 2005. Since then XelaTeco has produced biodigesters, windmills, high efficiency stoves, pumps, water filters, solar LED lighting systems and micro-hydro products. It is installing a micro-hydroelectric system to serve Communidad Nueva Alianza, a cooperative of 40 Guatemalan families. XelaTeco comprises 10 Guatemalan workers, all highly skilled with university and technical school backgrounds, many lacking other viable work opportunities. The team is split between seven men and three women, with the varied skill set necessary for completing the variety of projects, from accounting and civil engineering to electronics and metalcasting.

It is mentioned by Pliny among the towns of the eighth region, though the Veleiates were ethnically Ligurians. Its inhabitants were, in the census of Vespasian, found to be remarkable for their longevity. Nothing further was known of it until 1747, when some ploughmen found the famous Tabula alimentaria, now in National Archaeological Museum of Parma. This, the largest inscribed bronze tablet of antiquity (1.3 m by 2.8 m) contains the list of estates in the territories of Veleia, Libarna, Placentia, Parma and Luca, in which Trajan had assigned before 102 CE 72,000 sesterces and then 1,044,000 sesterces on a mortgage bond to forty-six estates. The total value of which was reckoned at over 13,000,000 sesterces (~130,000), the interest on which at 5% was to serve for the support of 266 boys and 6 girls, the former receiving 16, the latter 12 sesterces a month. Excavations begun on the site in 1760, and were at first successful; the forum and basilica, the thermae and the amphitheatre and private houses with many statues (twelve of marble from the basilica, and a fine bronze head of Hadrian) and inscriptions were discovered. Pre-Roman cremation tombs have also been found, with objects of bronze and iron of no great value. But later excavations which were carried on at intervals up to 1876 have given less fruitful results. The oldest dated monument is a bronze tablet with a portion of the text of the Lex Rubria de Gallia cisalpina of 49 BCE which dealt with the administration of justice in Cisalpine Gaul in connection with the extension to it of the privileges of the Roman franchise, the latest an inscription of 276 CE. Most of the objects found are in the museum at Parma. How and when Veleia was abandoned is uncertain: the previously prevalent view that it was destroyed by a landslip was proved to be mistaken by the excavations of 1876.

For an expansion and to establish a permanent naval base, the U.S. Navy purchased 7,676 acres (3100 hectares) of land on the Hood Canal near the town of Bangor for approximately $18.7 million. The U.S. Naval ammunition magazine was established on June 5, 1944, for its construction, and it began operations in January 1945.

Description  The city council of Parma commissioned Benedetto Antelami to build the baptistery in 1196. The outside of pink Verona marble is octagonal. The inside contains sixteen arches, forming alcoves each containing a painted scene. All these are 13th and 14th century frescoes and paintings. The most striking part of the Baptistery, however, is its painted domed ceiling. Sixteen rays come out of the center of the ceiling, which each correspond to the arches. However, problems were posed over time as the paintings were not true frescoes. The paint would start to come off the walls and would be literally hanging on. Due to this, the Baptistery had to be painstakingly consolidated and restored with syringes and spatulas.

History The oldest archaeological findings in the area date from the Neolithic, and there are findings from the Bronze Age, Iron Age and the Roman time. The town was first mentioned in 1205 as Wywar, meaning \\"New Castle\\". The √Årp√°d dynasty built a stone castle after the Mongol invasion in 1241. From the 13th century until 1296, Hol√≠ƒç was the seat of a border comitatus. Among the owners of the town were Matthias Cs√°k and Stibor of Stiborice. In the 15th century the town's development was slowed by the Hussite raids. In 1736 the town was bought by Franz I, Holy Roman Emperor, husband of Maria Theresa and manufactures were built, leading to the town's growth. Maria Theresa also rebuilt the Hol√≠ƒç Castle from a fortress into a summer ch√¢teau of the Habsburgs. Hol√≠ƒç's once thriving Jewish community was completely decimated by the Holocaust. The name Hol√≠ƒç (also spelled Holitsch) also refers to a type of tin-glazed earthenware faience that was manufactured in the area. The Holitsch factory (Slovakia) was founded in 1743 by Francis of Lorain consort of Empress Maria Teresia. The factory concentrated on the production of richly adorned sets intended to emulate the wares used by the aristocracy in the large western European centers. The factory, which served as a revitalizing force against the decline of local potters in the 18th century, brought together experts from different countries in a co-operative effort to produce wares from which later central European factories derived their inspiration. Responding to an eager market and following patterns established at the Strasbourg factory, the Holitsch factory produced remarkably life like pieces imitating fruits and vegetables. These fine examples of modeling were further distinguished by the brightness of the colors used in their decorations. The potters also created sculpture vessels of human or animal shapes that were intended for a practical as well as decorative use such as salt dishes, parrot bottles and lidded containers. In August 1942, President Jozef Tiso gave an infamous speech in the town in which he defended the deportation of Jews from Slovakia, because they were \\"parasites\\".

The Faculty of Law is located at the City Campus, between Waterloo Quadrant and Eden Crescent. It is in close proximity to the Auckland High Court. In 2020, Auckland Law School ranked 50th in the world and best in New Zealand on QS World University Rankings. The University of Auckland‚Äôs Faculty of Law is the largest of its kind in New Zealand. It boasts experts in a variety of fields, including commercial, public, human rights and environmental law. History The land (and some of the buildings) that the Faculty of Law now occupies were previously used by the High Court of New Zealand in Auckland. One courtroom has been retained unaltered for moots. Prior to this, the land was used by an aerated water manufacturer, Grey and Menzies. The law school is accessible by a right of way, down a small hill from Waterloo Quadrant. Originally, this was only a mud track nicknamed the Ho Chi Minh trail but this was paved when the Davis Law Library was completed and replaced Eden Crescent as the main entrance into the Law School grounds. Until 1991, the Law school was based on the top three floors of the University Library building. Davis Law Library The Davis Law Library is named after Professor A. G. Davis, who retired as Dean of the Law School in 1965. The Library was founded at the University in 1939 and has had several locations, including a move into the General Library building in 1969. It has been in its current Eden Crescent location since 1992. Student activities Auckland Law School is the home of volunteer (pro-bono legal services) organisation, the Equal Justice Project. Founded in 2005 by students Eesvan Kirshnan and Peter Williams with the aim of promoting equal access to justice in Auckland. It is one of the largest pro bono organisations in New Zealand. The University of Auckland Mooting Society was formed in 2014 and is the first society of its kind in New Zealand. Throughout the year the Society offers a variety of seminars and workshops to assist students with compulsory academic moots. The John Haigh Memorial Moot was established in 2014 in memory of John Haigh QC (LLB '71), a highly respected barrister and alumnus of Auckland Law School. The 2014 final was judged by Harrison, Toogood and Moore JJ in the Auckland High Court. The moot provides a valuable opportunity for third-year and above students to develop and enhance their advocacy skills. In 2020, the University of Auckland Mooting Society is one of the largest clubs at Auckland Law School. They run five prestigious moots aimed at facilitating and developing mooting and advocacy. An elected student body, the Auckland University Law Students Society, represents and advocates for law students and to help provide opportunities which complement legal studies. AULSS help organise social events such as \\"Steins\\", publication of the serious academic Law Review, an annual Law Revue, mooting competitions, and participation in sports and events such as the Round the Bays fun run. Law students traditionally dominate both competition and administration of both the Auckland University Debating Association and the Auckland Debating Association. Te RƒÅkau Ture (TRT) is the name of the MƒÅori Law Students Association in which the r≈çp≈´ initiates activities throughout the calendar year. Established in 1990, TRT has grown to play a very important role in the lives of MƒÅori students who study at Auckland Law School. Each year the r≈çp≈´ organise a number of events such as hosting a noho marae for Part II and above, a Haerenga visiting high schools outside of Auckland to promote coming to the Law School, plus their most popular hƒÅkari whakamutunga. They welcome everyone to join TRT and encourage members to participate in their events to meet other students and build support networks. The Pacific Island Law Student‚Äôs Association more commonly referred to as PILSA, aims to provide a sense of identity and belonging among Pacific Island students at Auckland Law School. It also aims to promote educational achievement and to connect with Pacific communities outside of the university through various events organised throughout the year. The elected PILSA executive committee is a link between the PILSA members, the Pacific Students Faculty Adviser, the Faculty of Law and Pacific Island communities. The PILSA executive works closely with the Student Academic and Support Adviser (Pacific) to provide workshops, seminars and tutorials for PILSA members. PILSA encourages all students to join PILSA and participate in social events, sports-days, tutorials, seminars and the Pacific Islands Moot. As of 2017, Auckland has been the national senior mooting champion for nine of the past ten years. It has therefore represented New Zealand at the most prestigious moot court competition in the world, the Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot, nine times in the past ten years. Highlights of Auckland's participation in the Jessup include a semi-final finish in 2012, and a Best Oralist award at the international rounds (Andrew Grant) in 2017. Research Auckland Law School is home to a number of research centres of excellence, including The Aotearoa New Zealand Centre for Indigenous Peoples and the Law The New Zealand Centre for Environmental Law, New Zealand Centre for ICT Law, NZ Centre for Legal Theory, The New Zealand Centre for Human Rights Law, Policy and Practice and The Research Centre for Business Law. It is also home to Te Tai Haruru ‚Äì the MƒÅori Legal Academics Group. The LLB degree Auckland law graduates are highly sought after. In any given year, about half of Auckland Law School graduates take up positions in New Zealand law firms, while the other half begin their careers in other professional organisations. These include accounting and consulting firms; business and industry; national and local government; teaching, research and journalism; international, environmental and other non-government organisations. In the third and forth year of the LLB, Part III and IV students will have over 50 elective courses to choose from. (including four taught in the January/February summer school) ‚Äì the largest range of any New Zealand law faculty. Although there isn't any requirement to major within the LLB degree students may choose to specialise in a particular area of interest, or if they would prefer, to choose from a wide range of different areas to cover a range of topics. There is a growing array of electives with an international focus: in 2015 these include Aviation Law, International Human Rights, International Law, Law and IT, Financial Markets Law, Global Environmental Law, Immigration and Refugee Law, International Criminal Law, International Disputes Settlement and International Trade Law. More than 90% of LLB students qualify with two degrees, either because they enter law school as graduates (15%) or because they undertake conjoint bachelor's degrees (75%). Conjoint combinations are BA/LLB, BCom/LLB, BE(Hons)/LLB, BHSc/LLB, BProp/LLB, BSc/LLB. Postgraduate Studies The Faculty of Law has a leading postgraduate programme offering opportunities for postgraduate legal research. The Master of Laws (LLM) is designed to provide an advanced level of study for both full-time students and those who are legal practitioners or engaged in other full- or part-time employment. Students may concentrate their study in particular areas of specialisation, or study a broad range of legal subjects. The LLM programme offers six specialisations: Commercial and Corporate Law, Public Law, Environmental Law, Human Rights Law, International Law, and Litigation and Dispute Resolution. The LLM undertaken by research offers graduates the opportunity to conduct in-depth research in an area of personal interest to enhance future employment opportunities either professionally or academically. The LLM undertaken by coursework offers law graduates an opportunity to study areas in greater depth and complexity than within an undergraduate law degree, combining courses of sophistication and technical difficulty in terms of legal content with courses that contain relevant interdisciplinary subject matter and a focus on policy. Each course contains a significant research component, usually in the form of a 12,500 word research essay. The LLM also permits cross-disciplinary study in the form of one Masters course (30 points) from another faculty in the University of Auckland. The Masters of Legal Studies (MLS) is for graduates who do not have a Law undergraduate degree but have a four-year degree or equivalent in another discipline and whose work involves legal issues and dealing with legislation. Completion of this degree will not satisfy the entry requirements for admission as a barrister and solicitor in New Zealand and is not a substitute for an LLB degree. The MLS suits professionals from non-legal backgrounds who find that their careers require some knowledge of legal matters, but do not necessarily want to practise law. Professionals who will particularly benefit include: Accountants and Auditors, Architects and Town Planners, Business Development Managers, Compliance Managers, Teachers, Engineers, IT professionals, Police and Public Sector Professionals. A Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Law is a thesis-only research degree usually requiring full-time study for three to four years at The University of Auckland.

Founded June 20, 1994, the station was owned and operated by the Daystar Television Network of Fort Worth, Texas.  History  The FCC granted an original construction permit on June 20, 1994 for a low-power television station on channel 43 to serve the Cheyenne market. The permit for the station, given callsign K43CM, was awarded to Aracelis Ortiz of Faith Pleases God Church in Harlingen, Texas, operators of Spanish-language religious television stations. The permittee was not able to timely build the station, and the permit was canceled and callsign deleted. However, the FCC later renewed the construction permit, and in June 1998, Ortiz completed a sale of the permit to Daystar, who was granted a license for the station on October 25, 1999. The license for the station was upgraded to Class A on October 28, 2002. The station took the call letters KCHD-CA on June 17, 2006.

In 1916 he starred in The Love Hermit portraying Jack Hillman, and began appearing in a series of Universal features that paired him with Lon Chaney and Dorothy Phillips. Stowell's early death brought the series of adventures to a close. In 1918 he co-starred with Dorothy Phillips and Erich Von Stroheim in The Heart of Humanity. In 1919 Universal sent Stowell to the Belgian Congo to scout for filming locations. While en route to Elizabethville Stowell was riding in the caboose car of his train.

Schramm was born and raised on Long Island, New York. After learning to play several instruments from the age of eight, Schramm picked up the guitar in his teenage years. He began his music career with a late incarnation of Human Switchboard, a short- lived group heavily influenced by The Velvet Underground and Joy Division. Although Schramm was not around early enough to be involved in the band's only LP, he did contribute to the album After Words, a solo album by Switchboard lead singer Bob Pfeifer released in 1987, five years after the band's breakup.[ amg] Following Human Switchboard's breakup, Schramm played briefly with Jon Klages, formerly of The Individuals. Soon after that, Schramm joined fledgling band Yo La Tengo, serving as the band's lead guitarist for a period of approximately two years. During this span, he contributed to their debut recording \\"The River of Water\\" and the band's highly acclaimed first LP, Ride the Tiger. Following Ride the Tiger, Schramm amicably left Yo La Tengo to form the Schramms with a number of musicians he had previously been connected to - Ron Metz, who had played drums in Human Switchboard, and former Yo La Tengo members Mike Lewis (bass) and Terry Karydes, who initially played bass until her bass guitar was stolen, after which she moved to keyboards. The band also had guitarist Todd Novak and saxophonist Pete Linzell. The Schramms released their debut album Walk to Delphi in 1989, and gained a following in Germany. In 1990, Schramm briefly worked with Yo La Tengo again, this time contributing to their album Fakebook. Meanwhile, he continued writing songs with the Schramms, and after being signed to European label Normal Records, the band released its second album, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Dynamite in 1992. Around this time, much of the original lineup had left the band, and a more-or-less new version of the Schramms released two albums in the mid-1990s: 1994's Little Apocalypse and 1996's Dizzy Spell. In 2000, the Schramms released their most recent record, 100 Questions, again with a different lineup than the previous album. Schramm has also released two solo albums: 1994's Folk und die Folgen (only released in Germany), and 1999's Hammer and Nails. He has worked on three albums by singer/songwriter Kate Jacobs, and has done session guitar work for many artists, including The Replacements, Soul Asylum, Freedy Johnston, Richard Buckner, and Chris Stamey - whom he had worked with previously as a member of The dB's in the 1980s. He plays in Syd Straw's band at her annual Valentine's Day 'Heartwreck' shows. In 2015, he once again reunited with Yo La Tengo for their album Stuff Like That There and subsequent tour.

The board was suspended on 12 July 1956 by an Order in Council and the district was placed under the administration of Commissioner Richard Rushton, who ultimately served in the role for almost four years. It became the Shire of Mandurah on 1 July 1961 following the passage of the Local Government Act 1960, which reformed all remaining road districts into shires. It became the Town of Mandurah when it gained town status on 1 July 1987 and assumed its current name when it gained city status on 14 April 1990.

Hernandes made his fame as a fashion stylist during the 60s and 70s, after which he was invited to work on television. His dedication and fame on television lasted for over 40 years and various television stations. In his political career, Hernandes was known for statements deemed inappropriate, often directed at other famous personalities. Among other controversies, he was accused of racism and antisemitism. Hernandes was the first openly gay congressman in Brazil.Primeiro gay Biography Hernandes was born in Elisi√°rio, and raised by a Spanish immigrant couple (Diego Hern√°ndez and Isabel S√°nchez); he apparently never knew his biological parents. He had great affection for his adoptive mother, a Spanish immigrant from Andalusia. One of his projects in the Chamber of Deputies was to create the Dia da M√£e Adotiva (Adoptive Mother's Day) that would be celebrated on the third Sunday of May.Como deputado, Clodovil apresentou 17 projetos √† C√¢mara Hernandes was educated in a Catholic school; besides his native Portuguese, he could speak Spanish (his parents' language) and French. =Fashion stylist= Hernandes began his career as a stylist at age 16. In the 1960s he gained fame as a designer of haute couture. Clodovil, 1971. =Television= In the 1980s Hernandes became a TV personality with appearances on Rede Globo's \\"TV Mulher\\", one of the first Brazilian shows dedicated to the contemporary woman. His career as a TV presenter had its ups and downs throughout the 90s. Although he had a strong female following, his explicit right-wing position and unstable relations with co-workers led to frequent job losses. After his breakthrough on TV Mulher, Clodovil was fired from the female-oriented programme hosted by Marilia Gabriela and sexologist/current S√£o Paulo Brazilian Secretary of Tourism, Marta Suplicy. In 1982, when Walter Clark, Globo's former director general, was invited to become a director on the Rede Bandeirantes network, Clodovil hosted his programme. In the 1993 TV season, Clodovil hosted a show in Rede Manchete, however the network, based in Rio de Janeiro, suffered a severe financial crisis and strike action as well as a suspension of part of its scheduled national broadcast. Adolpho Bloch regained control of the network by legal determination and Clodovil left the channel in the first days of May due to past differences with his ex-boss. In 2006 in S√£o Paulo, Clodovil was depicted in a musical. He defended the preservation of Mata Atl√¢ntica in the Ubatuba region and minority rights in the lower house. His future project was Casa Cl√¥, a foundation attended by women not helped by official social assistance programmes. Clodovil trained as an actor and as a singer. He designed the evening gowns for Miss Brasil and Miss Universe Sandra Mara Ferreira and Sandra Guimar√£es de Oliveira. His controversial declarations on Rede TV!, caused legal consequences for Clodovil's artistic career. He was the presenter of Clodovil Por Excel√™ncia (Clodovil By Excellence) on the TVJB network, which was established in March 2007. Views In an interview with R√°dio Tupi on October 27, 2006, Clodovil stated that Jews manipulated the Holocaust and forged the September 11 attacks. In the same interview, he referred to black people as \\"complex creoles.\\" To defend his opinions, he told the radio that there is an \\"extinguished power, that is in the underground of things\\". According to Clodovil, \\"People are led to believe. When there was that incident with the Twin Towers there were no Americans and no Jews.\\" The president of the Israeli Federation of Rio, Osias Wurman, declared himself outraged with the declarations, mainly because they came from a person coming from a minority that also undergoes prejudice. Wurman filed a court action against Clodovil, accusing him of being a racist, as well as sending copies of the audio interview to the State Department of Human Rights, state deputies and non-governmental organizations linked to the black movement. Congressman In the 2006 elections, Clodovil Hernandes was elected federal congressman for the state of S√£o Paulo, being the third most voted congressman in his state, with 493,951 votes or 2.43% of the valid vote. He was a candidate for the Christian Labour Party. His political phrase was: \\"Bras√≠lia will never be the same\\". Clodovil favored legislation that banned toys resembling tobacco products, restricted violent images in television newscasts during family hours and reduced the number of congresspersons in the Brazilian parliament. Death Clodovil Hernandes died in Bras√≠lia, on March 17, 2009, after a stroke.

It is on a narrow strip between Lake Clifton and Yalgorup National Park to the west, and Harvey Estuary to the east. History The area was known as \\"Koolijerrenup\\" by the local Noongar people. =Present day= Herron contains a couple of roadhouses for passing trucks and motorists on Old Coast Road, while rural residential estates have sprung up nearby, and olive groves and orchards operate from Island Point. At nearby Mount John, a local engineering company operates a liquid waste facility. The City of Mandurah has coordinated a foreshore stabilisation scheme at Island Point to offset degradation caused by devegetation of the coastal dunes and the 1994 construction of the Dawesville Channel which has increased tides on the estuary. A Green Corps team has collected 500 grams of seed from a range of species and is now working with the council to revegetate the area. The City of Mandurah and neighbouring Shire of Waroona developed a combined structure plan for the Herron-Lake Clifton area in 2006, anticipating a population increase in the region after the Forrest Highway, a continuation of the Kwinana Freeway from Perth, is completed.

They were the sons of James Lucas (1792‚Äì1865), a builder from St Pancras, London. Charles joined his father's business and was soon employed to manage construction of the Norwich & Brandon Railway for Sir Samuel Morton Peto. In 1842 Charles set up his own contracting business in Norwich and progressed to rebuilding Peto's house, Somerleyton Hall. Charles and Thomas established a facility in Lowestoft from which they undertook various works, including the railway, the station, the Esplanade, St John's church, and several hotels. The Royal Albert Hall built by Lucas Brothers  Building contracts  Perhaps their most famous building contract was the Royal Albert Hall completed in 1871.British History Online (ref. 124) They also built Covent Garden Opera House (completed in 1858), Floral Hall (1860), King's College Hospital (1862), the Junior Carlton Club (1866), Charterhouse School (1872), and the Alexandra Palace (1873).National Archives: Correspondence of Charles Thomas Lucas Private houses included Cliveden (1851), Henham Hall (1858), Rendlesham Hall (1870), Normanhurst Court (1870), and the South Kensington Exhibitions of 1867 and 1871 with Sir John Kelk.

St Luke's Hospital  St Luke's is an Anglican mission hospital run by the Diocese of South West Tanganyika. It serves a population of about 150,000 and people come from a radius of , sometimes walking for two days to reach the hospital. The hospital has 50 beds with male, female and maternity wards. Relatives cook all the food required by ‚Äòtheir‚Äô patient whilst they are in the hospital, themselves staying in a very basic hostel. There is also an Outpatients Dispensary that treats about 5,500 people a year. Dr Simeon is the only doctor. There is no main electricity, only a diesel generator that operates for two hours every day. There is no gas or oil heating and patients can get very cold on the frosty nights. Pneumonia, malaria, TB, diarrhoea are commonly treated, but there is also a large incidence of AIDS. The Church is giving a lead in trying to make people aware of the dangers of HIV. thumb The mission has a link with The Parish Church of St. James, Hampton Hill, England and the parish of St Luke with St Bartholomew Reading through the USPG. The information above comes from St James' website and updated by St Luke's after the visit from USPG in October 2010. The previous Doctor had died. Several Italian doctors have worked here.

The Battle of Radcot Bridge was fought on 19 December 1387 in medieval England between troops loyal to Richard II, led by court favourite Robert de Vere, and an army captained by Henry Bolingbroke, Earl of Derby. It took place at Radcot Bridge, a bridge over the River Thames now in Oxfordshire but then the boundary between Oxfordshire and Berkshire Background The previous year had seen increasing hostility between the young King Richard II and his magnates. This crisis reached a head in November 1386, when the Wonderful Parliament compelled King Richard to remove his chancellor, Michael de la Pole. According to the 16th-century chronicler Raphael Holinshed: In the words of a modern English historian: On Saturday 22 September 1397 Sir Thomas Mortimer was summoned to stand trial as a traitor. Mortimer‚Äôs alleged crime was the slaying of Thomas Molineux, constable of Chester Castle, at the skirmish at Radcot Bridge in 1387. Molineux had been one of the most important Royal agents in the Chester Palinate, and had been responsible for the daily exercise of de Vere‚Äôs power in the region. In spite of Richard II‚Äôs enduring resentment against the killer of his trusted servant, there were deeper political considerations behind the proceedings against a man who had been merely one of many gentry supporters of the Appellants. In August 1387 King Richard retaliated; he assembled a Council of magistrates at Nottingham and attempted to redefine the Royal Prerogative so as to render the Wonderful Parliament treasonous. The leaders of the Parliament, including Richard's uncle Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, hit back during the Miraculous or Merciless Parliament of November 1387. During this session, Woodstock and the Earls of Warwick and Arundel submitted an appeal which accused several of Richard's closest friends of routinely deceiving the King for their own profit. Preparatory events Richard responded by summoning Woodstock and the other Lords Appellant to the Tower of London; all three refused. This was open dissent, and both Richard and the Appellants knew the implications of such defiance. According to the author of the Eulogium historiarum, Richard asked Woodstock whether his companions were willing to take arms against him, to which the Duke replied: \\"we do not rebel or arm ourselves against the King except in order to instruct him\\". Pushed further by Richard, who protested that Parliament did not have the right to command a King even in the case of \\"the meanest kitchen boy\\", the Duke darkly reminded his nephew of his own standing: \\"But I am the son of a king\\".Eulogium (historiarum sive temporis): Chronicon ab orbe condito usque ad annum Domini MCCCLXVI, a monacho quodam Malmesburiensi exaratum, ed. by Frank Scott Haydon, Rolls series, 3 vols. (London: Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts, and Green, 1858‚Äì63), III (1863), pp. 363‚Äì5. Fearing deposition, King Richard ordered that the citizens of London should take up arms. De Vere was despatched to Cheshire, where King Richard had assembled an army of five thousand retainers, under the direct command of Sir Thomas Molineux. De Vere now took these southwards towards London. The battle The most direct routes to the capital were blocked by Arundel's men, so de Vere decided to cross the Thames at Radcot, near Faringdon. However, the bridge itself was under the guard of Derby's troops; they had also partly dismantled its structure. Undeterred, de Vere gave the command to storm the crossing. At this point, a larger force of Derby's men arrived from the north, effectively surrounding the Cheshiremen. De Vere managed to escape the field, eventually making his way to France; once it was known that he had fled, his army promptly surrendered. Among the handful of casualties was Molyneux himself, who was killed during the abortive attempt to cross the Thames. Aftermath After the battle, Woodstock and the other Appellants held a council with Richard at the Tower. Richard had no means of resisting their demands, and it was agreed that a further Parliament should be called in February 1388. The resulting Merciless Parliament saw a fullscale purge of Richard's household.

It is located at the foot of Yuelun Hill, facing the Qiantang River. It was originally constructed in 970 by the Wuyue Kingdom, destroyed in 1121, and reconstructed fully by 1165, during the Southern Song dynasty (1127‚Äì1279). History and background The pagoda was originally constructed by the ruler of the Wuyue Kingdom, whose capital was Hangzhou. The name Liuhe comes from the six Buddhist ordinances and it is said that the reason for building the pagoda was to calm the tidal bore of the Qiantang River and as a navigational aid. However, the pagoda was completely destroyed during warfare in the year 1121. After the current pagoda was constructed of wood and brick during the Southern Song dynasty, additional exterior eaves were added during the Ming (1368‚Äì1644) and Qing Dynasties (1644‚Äì1911). The pagoda is hexagonal in shape and some in height, it also has the appearance of being a thirteen-story structure, though it only has seven interior stories. There is a spiral staircase leading to the top floor and upon each of the seven ceilings are carved and painted figures including animals, flowers, birds and characters. Each story of the pagoda consists of four elements, the exterior walls, a zigzagged corridor, the interior walls and a small chamber. Viewed from outside, the pagoda appears to be layered-bright on the upper surface and dark underneath. That is a harmonious alternation of light and shade. According to the British sinologist and historian Joseph Needham, the pagoda also served as a lighthouse along the Qiantang River. Being of considerable size and stature, it actually served as a permanent lighthouse from nearly its beginning, to aid sailors in seeking anchorage for their ships at night (as described in the Hangzhou Fu Zhi).Needham, 662. A small \\"Pagoda Park\\" has recently been opened nearby. Its exhibition features models of ancient Chinese pagodas and illustrates the variety of different designs, as well as history, culture and symbols associated with the pagoda.Sightseeing In Hangzhou See also *Chinese architecture *Architecture of the Song dynasty  References  = Citations = = Sources = * Needham, Joseph (1986).

He became an avant-garde painter at the age of 15, he studied at Berlin's Academy of Fine Arts, and subsequently worked as a theatrical set designer, working for a number of theatres in Berlin (but not with Max Reinhardt). In 1913 he started working in the German film industry designing film sets and/or costumes for directors such as Joe May, Ernst Lubitsch, Richard Oswald, and E. A. Dupont. During World War I, Leni started directing as well with films such as Der Feldarzt (Das Tagebuch des Dr. Hart, 1917), Patience (1920), Die Verschw√∂rung zu Genua (1920/21) and Backstairs (1921). Waxworks (1924) was planned as a four-part omnibus feature, but the last part was not shot when money ran out. He also made a series of unusual short animated films Rebus-Film Nr. 1‚Äì8, which were filmed crossword puzzles. Leni designed short prologues for festive film premieres in Berlin cinemas, such as Lubitsch's Forbidden Paradise (1924), Herbert Brenon's Peter Pan (1924), and E. A. Dupont's Variety (1925). In 1927, he accepted Carl Laemmle's invitation to become a director at Universal Studios and moved to Hollywood. There Leni made a distinguished directorial debut with The Cat and the Canary (1927), an adaptation of John Willard's stage play. The film had a great influence over Universal's later classic \\"haunted house\\" horror series, and was subsequently remade several times, notably in 1939 with Bob Hope. The following year he directed the big budget The Man Who Laughs (based on the novel by Victor Hugo), one of the most visually stylized of late period silent films. His final film was The Last Warning, envisioned as a companion film for The Cat and the Canary due to its predecessor's popularity. Leni died in Los Angeles on 2 September 1929, of sepsis brought on by an untreated tooth infection, only eight months after its release. He was 44.

Under this scheme, while the Ambulatory Care and Diagnostic Centre built only a few years earlier was retained, most of the rest of the buildings on the site were demolished and a new Brent Emergency Care and Diagnostic Centre was created. The works, which were designed by HLM Architects and Avanti Architects and carried out by Bouygues at a cost of ¬£60 million, opened in 2006.

The Executive was a stretched version of the Chrysler LeBaron aimed at the then booming market segment of limousines. The Executive and Cadillac's Series 75 were the only factory-offered limousine models during the mid-1980s. The two original 1982 Chrysler Executive prototypes were finished in dark red with matching vinyl tops, and red cloth interiors. Although fully functional, these two vehicles were for promotional use only and were used in various car shows. History 1984 Chrysler Executive Limousine rear view 1984 Chrysler Executive Limousine front seats All Executives were built by conversion specialist ASC near St. Louis, Missouri, and began as standard LeBaron coupes. Standard front doors (from LeBaron sedans) were utilized, while the rear doors were individually fabricated using the rearward-half of the coupe door. Interiors were available in navy blue cloth or leather (available at extra charge), or powder gray cloth. 1983 interiors were only available in \\"Kimberly\\" cloth (a short-nap velour) upholstery, leather upholstery was an option starting in 1984. Limited colors were available for 1983. For 1984 and on, standard exterior colors were black, medium blue, dark blue, white, charcoal (discontinued after 1984) and silver. Standard vinyl roof coverings matched the body color, while the interior panels were all covered in cloth - even if leather seating was ordered. 1984 Chrysler Executive Limousine rear seat area Power came from the Mitsubishi-sourced 2.6 L G54B I4 engine in 1984 and 1985; for 1986 Chrysler's own turbocharged 2.2 L four-cylinder engine was used. Both engines were only available with a 3-speed automatic transmission. The Executive Sedan was, simply, a stretched LeBaron that held a center console between the front seats. The console held duct work for the two rear seat air conditioning vents. The Executive Limousine (option code A-89) had a thick center divide behind the front seats that held a glass divider with power sliding center panel (controlled from the passenger-side switch panel), two upholstered jump seats (without seat belts), five air conditioning vents (with flow controlled by a switch on the rear passenger-side door), an illuminated storage compartment with a flip-down door, and an AM/FM stereo with cassette (separate from the driver's sound system) controlling the four rear speakers. Above the divider glass was a \\"glamour module\\" lighting unit - with overhead lights for the console, as well as individual reading lamps for the two jump seats. Once the rear doors were closed, the lamps located in this overhead console would slowly theatre-dim before turning off. Executive Sedans had a similar lighting feature, in the form of a small single lamp located above each rear door. Both Sedan and Limousine models had adjustable rear-seat headrests, two-position foot rests, rear quarter reading lamps, and pillar mounted assist straps. For 1983, the Executive used the standard LeBaron grille (as shown on the 1982 prototype models as well), while 1984 and 1985 utilized a slightly more vertical waterfall grill (borrowed from the New Yorker) that featured a heavier cap and narrow chrome extensions running beneath the headlights. 1984 and 1985 models also received wrap-around tail lamps (from standard LeBaron models), versus the envelope styling on the 1983. For Executive's final year, the 1986 models used the re-designed LeBaron tail end, featuring new tail lamps and deck lid. Up front, Executive still utilized the New Yorker grille but the front fender-mounted cornering lamps were discontinued. There were two distinct Executive models on different wheelbases: *Four-door, five-seat Executive Sedan on a wheelbase of 124\\" (1983 and 1984 only), and *Four-door, seven-seat Executive Limousine riding a wheelbase of 131\\" (model years 1983 to 1986).

ACAP was developed by organisations that claimed to represent sections of the publishing industry (World Association of Newspapers, European Publishers Council, International Publishers Association).ACAP FAQ: Where is the driving force behind ACAP? It was intended to provide support for more sophisticated online publishing business models, but was criticised for being biased towards the fears of publishers who see search and aggregation as a threat rather than as a source of traffic and new readers.  Status  In November 2007 ACAP announced that the first version of the standard was ready. No non-ACAP members, whether publishers or search engines, have adopted it so far. A Google spokesman appeared to have ruled out adoption.Search Engine Watch report of Rob Jonas' comments on ACAP In March 2008, Google's CEO Eric Schmidt stated that \\"At present it does not fit with the way our systems operate\\".

ACAP and search engines  ACAP rules can be considered as an extension to the Robots Exclusion Standard (or \\"robots.txt\\") for communicating website access information to automated web crawlers. It has been suggestedNews Publishers Want Full Control of the Search Results that ACAP is unnecessary, since the robots.txt protocol already exists for the purpose of managing search engine access to websites.

ACAP argues that robots.txt was devised at a time when both search engines and online publishing were in their infancy and as a result is insufficiently nuanced to support today‚Äôs much more sophisticated business models of search and online publishing. ACAP aims to make it possible to express more complex permissions than the simple binary choice of ‚Äúinclusion‚Äù or ‚Äúexclusion‚Äù.

The Robots Exclusion Standard has always been implemented voluntarily by both content providers and search engines, and ACAP implementation is similarly voluntary for both parties.

History The Meridian Arts Ensemble was founded in 1987. The original members of the group wanted an opportunity to play challenging works, to experience control of their ensemble, and to find creative outlets for their musicianship. Meridian received its early education in the American Brass Quintet's brass class at the Juilliard School, and then launched its professional career. The ensemble has played all over the country and the world. Ensemble members currently serve as faculty members in many prestigious US universities. Awards and albums In the late 1980s, the group won a string of four competitions: Artists International, Chamber Music Chicago, New York Brass Conference, and finally, in 1990, Concert Artists Guild. The prize for the latter was extremely important to the ensemble - not just the cachet of winning, and not just the prize money, but management by Concert Artists Guild's booking department, a commission from a composer of the ensemble's choice (Stephen Barber's work Semahane, for brass quintet, percussion, and piano), and a recording for Channel Classics Records. In 1990, Meridian traveled to the Netherlands to record its first compact disc, part of Channel's Winning Artists Series. That CD contained works by Alvin Etler, Taxin, Alexander Arutiunian, Jan Bach, and Paul Hindemith, and was released in 1991. The group's second CD was released in 1992. Entitled Smart Went Crazy (from a poem by Allen Ginsberg), this disc established Meridian's reputation as an innovator in the field of brass chamber music and new music in general. There was substantial interest in this disc, leading to an interview with the group on NPR's Weekend Edition program. Brisk sales of the disc helped to cement Meridian's relationship with its recording label. Seven more discs have now been released, all to critical acclaim. The most recent albums on Channel Classics, Brink (released in 2006), and Timbrando (released in 2008) were recorded in the Super Audio CD (SACD) format. Since 2009, the group has released a number of new CD recordings and one live concert DVD. See \\"Discography\\" for a complete listing. Tours In the years since 1987, Meridian has performed in every state of the U.S. except Hawaii, and in the Netherlands, Belgium, Romania, Germany, Finland, Taiwan, Japan, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia. The group has commissioned over fifty new pieces, tours extensively, and was for a number of years on the faculty of Manhattan School of Music's Contemporary Performance degree program. Personnel The current membership of the ensemble is: Trumpets: Jon Nelson and Sycil Mathai Horn: Daniel Grabois Trombone: Faustino Diaz Tuba: Raymond Stewart Percussion: John Ferrari =Past members= The trumpet chair originally occupied by Rolf Holly quickly went to Richard Kelley, who appears on Meridian's first three CDs. Following Mr. Kelley's departure, a string of trumpeters performed with the group: Alex Holton, Darryl Shaw, Kevin Cobb, Wayne DuMaine, and Terry Szor. After a national audition, Josef Burgstaller joined and performed with the group for six years before joining the Canadian Brass. Brian McWhorter joined in 2001 and departed abruptly in 2010 for unknown reasons. Tim Leopold, a NYC freelance artist joined immediately after, and left the group in 2019. He was replaced by current member Sycil Mathai. Trumpeter Jon Nelson is a founding member of the group. His one-year sabbatical was filled by Charles Lazarus, who is now a member of the Minnesota Orchestra. Hornist Daniel Grabois came to the ensemble in 1989, following a string of horn players. Tracy Leonard was the original hornist, followed by Lisa Aplikowski, Peter Reit, and Chris Komer. Mr. Grabois' six-month sabbatical was filled by Ann Ellsworth. Trombonist Benjamin Herrington was a founding member of the group. He retired in 2019 and was replaced by Faustino Diaz. Tubist Raymond Stewart was a founding member. His half-year sabbatical was filled by Marcus Rojas. Percussion: the group was founded without a percussionist. The first drummer to play with the ensemble was Mo Roberts, who appears on the Smart Went Crazy CD. John Ferrari took over shortly thereafter, and has been with the group since.

(1862). \\"On the Application of the Theorem of the Equivalence of Transformations to Interior Work.\\" Communicated to the Naturforschende Gesellschaft of Zurich, Jan. 27th, 1862; published in the Viertaljahrschrift of this Society, vol. vii. P. 48; in Poggendorff‚Äôs Annalen, May 1862, vol. cxvi. p. 73; in the Philosophical Magazine, S. 4. vol. xxiv. pp. 81, 201; and in the Journal des Mathematiques of Paris, S. 2. vol. vii. P. 209. This term was modeled on certain passages in French physicist Sadi Carnot's 1824 paper On the Motive Power of Fire that characterized the \\"transformations\\" of \\"working substances\\" (particles of a thermodynamic system) of an engine cycle, namely \\"mode of aggregation\\", which was a precursor to the concept of entropy, which Clausius coined in 1865. It was also a precursor to that of Ludwig Boltzmann's 1870s theories of entropy and order and disorder. Clausius (1962) labelled the quantity of disgregation with the letter , defined as :dZ = \\\\frac{dQ+dH}{T}, where is the heat, is the enthalpy and is the temperature.R. Clausius, communication to the Naturforschende Gesellschaft in Z√ºrich of 27 January 1862, published in the Vierteljahrschrift of this Society in vol. 7, pp. 48ff., in English translation as the \\"Sixth Memoir\\" in: The Mechanical Theory of Heat, with its Applications to the Steam-Engine and to the Physical Properties of Bodies, trans. John Tyndall, London, 1867, p. 227. Overview In 1824, French physicist Sadi Carnot assumed that heat, like a substance, cannot be diminished in quantity and that it cannot increase. Specifically, he states that in a complete engine cycle ‚Äòthat when a body has experienced any changes, and when after a certain number of transformations it returns to precisely its original state, that is, to that state considered in respect to density, to temperature, to mode of aggregation, let us suppose, I say that this body is found to contain the same quantity of heat that it contained at first, or else that the quantities of heat absorbed or set free in these different transformations are exactly compensated.‚Äô Furthermore, he states that ‚Äòthis fact has never been called into question‚Äô and ‚Äòto deny this would overthrow the whole theory of heat to which it serves as a basis.‚Äô This famous sentence, which Clausius spent fifteen years thinking about, marks the start of thermodynamics and signals the slow transition from the older caloric theory to the newer kinetic theory, in which heat is a type of energy in transit. In 1862, Clausius defined what is now known as entropy or the energetic effects related to irreversibility as the ‚Äúequivalence-values of transformations‚Äù in a thermodynamic cycle. Clausius then signifies the difference between ‚Äúreversible‚Äù (ideal) and ‚Äúirreversible‚Äù (real) processes: =Equivalence- values of transformations= He then states what he calls the ‚Äútheorem respecting the equivalence-values of the transformations‚Äù or what is now known as the second law of thermodynamics, as such: Quantitatively, Clausius states the mathematical expression for this theorem is as follows. Let dQ be an element of the heat given up by the body to any reservoir of heat during its own changes, heat which it may absorb from a reservoir being here reckoned as negative, and T the absolute temperature of the body at the moment of giving up this heat, then the equation: :\\\\int \\\\frac{dQ}{T} = 0 must be true for every reversible cyclical process, and the relation: :\\\\int \\\\frac{dQ}{T} \\\\ge 0 must hold good for every cyclical process which is in any way possible. =Verbal justifications= Clausius then points out the inherent difficulty in the mental comprehension of this law by stating: \\"although the necessity of this theorem admits of strict mathematical proof if we start from the fundamental proposition above quoted, it thereby nevertheless retains an abstract form, in which it is with difficulty embraced by the mind, and we feel compelled to seek for the precise physical cause, of which this theorem is a consequence.\\" The justification for this law, according to Clausius, is based on the following argument: To elaborate on this, Clausius states that in all cases in which heat can perform mechanical work, these processes always admit to being reduced to the ‚Äúalteration in some way or another of the arrangement of the constituent parts of the body.‚Äù To exemplify this, Clausius moves into a discussion of change of state of a body, i.e. solid, liquid, gas. For instance, he states, ‚Äúwhen bodies are expanded by heat, their molecules being thus separated from each other: in this case the mutual attractions of the molecules on the one hand, and external opposing forces on the other, insofar as any such are in operation, have to be overcome. Again, the state of aggregation of bodies is altered by heat, solid bodies rendered liquid, and both solid and liquid bodies being rendered aeriform: here likewise internal forces, and in general external forces also, have to be overcome.‚Äù =Definition of term= Clausius then goes on to introduce the term ‚Äúdisgregation‚Äù: =Ice melting= Ice melting on a beach in Iceland Clausius then discusses the example of the melting of ice, a classic example which is used in almost all chemistry books to this day, and shows how we might represent the mechanical equivalent of work related to this energetic change mathematically: =Measurements of disgregation= As it is difficult to obtain direct measures of the interior forces that the molecules of the body exert on each other, Clausius states that an indirect way to obtain quantitative measures of what is now called entropy is to calculate the work done in overcoming internal forces: :In the case of the interior forces, it would accordingly be difficult‚Äîeven if we did not want to measure them, but only to represent them mathematically‚Äîto find a fitting expression for them which would admit of a simple determination of the magnitude. This difficulty, however, disappears if we take into calculation, not the forces themselves, but the mechanical work which, in any change of arrangement, is required to overcome them. The expressions for the quantities of work are simpler than those for the corresponding forces; for the quantities of work can be all expressed, without further secondary statements, by the numbers which, having reference to the same unit, can be added together, or subtracted from one another, however various the forces may be to which they refer. :It is therefore convenient to alter the form of the above law by introducing, instead of the forces themselves, the work done in overcoming them. In this form it reads as follows: This description is an early formulation of the concept of entropy.

It was first published in the United States in 1980, becoming a best seller in the 00s. This book has been translated into 27 languages and dramatized as an interactive opera. It was also loosely adapted as the 1994 Lifetime television film Untamed Love, starring Ashlee Lauren, Lois Foraker and Cathy Lee Crosby. Goodreads rated the book 4.26 out of 5. The book has inspired people to move into Special Educational Need careers. The book opens with Hayden, a special education teacher, reading a newspaper article about a six-year-old girl named Sheila who didn't speak sometimes, was silenced by abuse and abandonment and beat up and burned a three-year-old boy a couple of days prior. As there was no place for her at the hospital, she has a reactive attachment disorder as a student in Hayden's class and as a result of getting abused and abandoned in Hayden's class, where she remains for about five months. A sequel to this book, The Tiger's Child, was published in 1995.  Summary  At the beginning of the year, Torey is given a long, narrow, carpeted classroom with a single window at the end ‚Äì very inconvenient for a special education class. Her teaching assistant is a Mexican migrant worker named Anton who didn't finish high school. The students at the beginning of the year are as follows: * Peter, 8, who has seizures and aggressive behavior caused by a neurological condition * Tyler, 8, suicidal * Max, 6, autistic * Freddie, 7, obese and profoundly mentally retarded * Sarah, 7, angry, defiant and selectively mute because of physical and sexual abuse by her father * Susannah Joy, 6, schizophrenic * William, 9, OCD with phobias of water, darkness, cars, vacuum cleaners, and dust * Guillermo, 9, blind, but he's in this class because the normal blind classes were unprepared to handle his aggressive behavior At age four, Sheila's abusive then-eighteen-year-old mother left and took Sheila and two-year-old brother Jimmie with her; however, on the highway, Sheila's mother opened the door and pushed Sheila out, leaving her behind. Since then, Sheila has lived in poverty with her neglectful and verbally abusive father. When she joined Torey's class, Sheila's dad did not have enough money to get water to wash themselves or the one set of clothes Sheila owned. Thus, she came to school dirty and smelly every day. Sheila is angry and violent to have a reactive attachment disorder is a result of getting abused. Sheila joins the group just after Christmas vacation. At first, she refuses to participate in the class and refuses to speak to anyone. She stays sitting in one chair. On her first day of school, at lunch, Sheila takes all of the goldfish from the aquarium and stabs their eyes out with a pencil. Torey and Whitney, a shy fourteen-year-old girl who assists the class, chase Sheila into the gymnasium, and Torey eventually soothes the terrified girl into coming back to class. After a few days, Sheila and Torey begin to trust one another, and Torey takes to giving her a bath every morning and massaging her body with baby lotion so she won't smell offensive. Torey also shampoos Sheila's hair and styles it with kiddie barrettes, giving the child a chance to enjoy feeling beautiful and learn how delightful it is to feel appreciated and cared for, although Sheila fears that the pretty new hair decorations will be confiscated by her dad. After Sheila began participating in class, there were still a few issues. First, she was focused on revenge. At one point, a teacher scolded her in the lunch room, so she went into the teacher's room and caused $700 worth of damage to the classroom. Also, Sheila refuses to do paper work. However, when given other mediums to work with (stacking blocks, for instance), she reveals that she is incredibly smart and talented for someone who only had a few months of first grade; her I.Q. is later tested, and comes to a total of 182, which is, according to Torey, around 1 in 10,000 for a six-year-old. Sheila remains obsessed with showing people that she matters, and terrified of abandonment. At one point, Torey goes to California for a few days for a conference. The students were given plenty of notice, but Sheila interpreted it as abandonment by the one person who had shown her love, and misbehaved through the whole trip. In the middle of the year, Torey is notified that a space has opened up at the state hospital for Sheila. Torey is horrified and cries, seeing that this girl with all her improvement should not be put into an institution. Torey brings the case to court, with the help of Torey's then- boyfriend Chad, a lawyer, and wins. Afterwards, Torey and Chad take Sheila out for pizza and buy her a dress. One day, Sheila comes to school looking pale and poorly. She uses the bathroom twice in the first half-hour. Torey takes Sheila on her lap, and then notices she's bleeding. Sheila eventually discloses that her uncle Jerry had tried to rape her, and when she was too small, he cut her genitalia with his knife. Sheila is rushed to the hospital after losing a lot of blood and has to have surgery to repair the damage. In the 1995 sequel, The Tiger's Child, it is revealed that because of this incident, Sheila is infertile. Sheila deals with the traumatic experience remarkably well, though she refuses to wear dresses for a while afterward. At the end of the year, Torey introduces Sheila to next year's teacher. Sheila will be going into third grade, because Torey feels she can deal with the harder material and that it's more important at this point that Sheila's teacher be loving and understanding. Torey knows this teacher personally and knows she would be. Research and reception The book has been used as the basis of research by Appalachian State University, by Michael Marlow & Gayle Disney.

Later jazz recordings containing sitar music include albums by Miles Davis, Alice Coltrane, Yusef Lateef, Joe Harriott (in collaboration with composer John Mayer),and Ornette Coleman. Early uses Although music based around the sitar would later spread from jazz to more popular music via The Beatles, the sitar became more widely known in the western world mainly through the work of Indian musicians such as Pandit Ravi Shankar, beginning in the late 1950s. From there it was taken up by jazz musicians and would later become a youth phenomenon in the mid-1960s after Beatle George Harrison took lessons from Pandit Ravi Shankar, and played sitar on several songs. The first recorded collaboration between Indian and Jazz musicians occurred in 1961 with Ravi Shankar and a group led by the West Coast American saxophonist/flutist Bud Shank. Their album entitled Improvisations only features one track, \\"Improvisations on the theme music from Pather Panchali,\\" in which Ravi Shankar and the Western musicians play together. The track is remarkable for little else; it is simply Western film music with the sitar playing the melody. However, this session, and that of film composer Shankar Jaikishan (1968), were connected the film industry, for Indian film music surely contributes the most considerable corpus of music that combines Indian and Western musics. However, both Ravi Shankar and Ananda Shankar are important figures with regard to Jazz because it was primarily through their music that John Coltrane and others became aware of Indian music. Tony Scott recorded a track entitled \\"Portrait of Ravi\\" on his Dedications album, as early as 1957. Coltrane met Shankar in 1965 after a long period of mutual admiration and letter writing (Thomas 1975:199). Coltrane's name is inextricably linked to the emergence of modal Jazz in 1958 on Miles Davis' album Milestones and it is believed that modal Jazz was inspired by Indian music. Indian influence is an important issue in the later music of Coltrane such as the album Kulu S√© Mama (1965) and also of musicians such as Yusef Lateef and Ornette Coleman.

The band's founding members were vocalist and guitarist Joachim Breuer, former member of the Minneapolis-based rock band Bastards, bassist and vocalist Kristen Pfaff and drummer Matt Entsminger. Pfaff was replaced by Wayne Davis following her departure in 1993 to join Hole. Janitor Joe released two studio albums and four singles on OXO and Amphetamine Reptile before disbanding after Pfaff's death in June 1994. Career The band's first single, \\"Hmong\\", was released on the nascent OXO records imprint in 1992, and popular local label Amphetamine Reptile picked up the band later that year, releasing the \\"Bullethead\\" single on picture disc, and following up in 1993 with the \\"Boyfriend\\" 7-inch and the debut album Big Metal Birds. One Janitor Joe track, \\"Under the Knife\\", can also be found on an OXO records 4-track EP, released in 1993. Janitor Joe became a staple of the Minneapolis sound, characterized by vicious, riff-driven, thickly layered blasts of noise, influenced by the Pacific Northwest's early grunge sound and by the sharper, faster DC Post-hardcore scene, as well as the stop-start distortion of the Butthole Surfers, Shellac and others on the Touch and Go label. Pfaff and Breuer both contributed songs to Big Metal Birds: \\"Both operate within easy reach of the line separating punishment and reward: Pfaff's contributions (the surly \\"Boys in Blue\\") tend to be slightly more spacious, while Breuer's (\\"One Eye,\\" for instance) stipulate that drummer Matt Entsminger maintain perpetual motion\\", wrote David Sprague of TrouserPress magazine. The growing Minneapolis scene was beginning to attract music press attention in 1993. Amphetamine Reptile released a tour single, Stinker, and Janitor Joe began to tour nationally. While playing in California, Pfaff was scouted by Eric Erlandson and Courtney Love of Hole, then looking for a bassist. Though she initially declined to join, Pfaff later reconsidered and moved to Seattle to work on Live Through This, Hole's second album. Janitor Joe recruited Wayne Davis to replace Pfaff, and continued to write and tour. Amphetamine Reptile released Lucky, the band's second album, in 1994. Pfaff was tiring of Seattle by this time, and took a sabbatical from Hole to rejoin Janitor Joe for a spring tour. Her plans to return to Minneapolis and rejoin Janitor Joe permanently were curtailed when, in June 1994, she was found dead of a heroin overdose in her bathtub. She had planned to drive to Minneapolis the next day; her U-Haul stood, packed, in her garage. Janitor Joe split in 1994, in the wake of Pfaff's death. Breuer and Entsminger went on to form Gnomes of Zurich with Scott Hull, and the band released an album, again on Amphetamine Reptile, entitled 33rd Degree Burns, as well as singles on Reptilian Records and Sister Records. On August 29, 2010, Breuer, Paul Erickson of Hammerhead & Vaz, and Enstminger reformed the group for a one-off performance at Amphetamine Reptile Records' 25th anniversary bash in Minneapolis.

His violent behaviour lost him his birthright and catalysed the split of the Duala people into rival Bell and Akwa sublineages. European sources European sources mention several rulers with names similar to Priso living on the Cameroons coast; these may all refer to the same individual. British records from 1788 and 1790 list a Duala leader named Preshaw as a subordinate of another ruler known as King George. Records from the British brig Sarah from 1790 indicate that Preshaw received the third largest \\"dash\\" (gift) from them, behind George and Angua and ahead of a ruler named Bell.Austen and Derrick 38. The same records mention a Peter a doe,Austen and Derrick 37. and a Peter's Town appears on a 1790 map by Captain Roger Latham.Austen and Derrick 197 note 54. According to an 1826 journal by R. M. Jackson, a leader named Preese became violent toward Europeans in 1792. Jackson blames Preese for piracy in the Wouri estuary. A work by James W. Holman mentions piracy in the estuary but gives no names. Duala oral history Duala oral history adds further detail. Priso lived on the left bank of the Wouri in the town of Bonapriso. As the eldest son of Doo a Makongo (likely the King George in European records), Priso was the heir apparent to his father's position and wealth. However, he robbed and killed European merchants, so his father disowned him. His rapine grew so violent that his brother, Bele a Doo (Bell from the European records) fled to the opposite bank of the Wouri River, where he founded the Bonaberi township. Priso's father and/or brother collaborated with the Europeans, which allowed the merchants to capture Priso.Austen and Derrick 36. One tale claims that after Priso had been caught, Bele populated Bonaberi with the captives Priso had taken. Another says that Priso and Bele fought at first but then teamed up against the Bakoko at Bonaberi. They then become rivals in trade, with Bele the eventual victor.Austen and Derrick 35. Duala oral tradition holds that Priso died in Bimbia, possibly by violent means.Austen and Derrick 35, 46. A rival tradition places his death in Subu. Priso's role in Duala legend is that of a rebellious warrior who marks the transition from the relatively peaceful days of the Duala founders to the strife known during European trade and colonialism.Austen and Derrick 40. The Duala of the Bell sublineage have a song about him: \\"Priso a Doo, Here Comes Warfare\\". Priso's actions and the question of succession that resulted from his disinheritance emboldened Ngando a Kwa to claim not only the rival Bonambela succession but also equal status to Bele a Doo, who succeeded Doo in lieu of Priso.

He was known for his poetry and essays, but is most known for his modernist short stories exploring the psychological conditions of Shanghai urbanites (see New Sensationists). From the 1940s onwards, he translated western novels into Chinese and worked as a scholar of classical Chinese literature. Early life and education Shi Zhecun was born in Zhejiang, but later he moved to Songjiang in Jiangsu following his father who was a teacher. He showed an early interest in poetry and started publishing his works from his youth. He studied English in Shanghai and a little French at Aurora university, which was founded by French Jesuits in 1903. It was there that he met several writers with whom he later founded the journal Xiandai.Shi Zhecun, modernism and continuity in Shanghai Retrieved on 5 Mar 2018 Creative work and career Shi Zhecun was active on the Shanghai literary scene. He edited the journal Les Contemporains (Xi√†nd√†i Áèæ‰ª£) from 1932 to 1934. It was a monthly literary journal \\"which published a hundred translations from foreign literature (primarily U.S. and Japanese)\\". The journal introduced Chinese readers to trends in modern literature and art. It covered foreign and Chinese topics and promoted the works of Shi Zhecun's friends, such as Mu Shiying and Dai Wangshu. Shi's short stories (about 70) were written between 1928 and 1937. They cover a range of topics, from absurdist ghost stories to gentler pieces on the strains faced by modern couples in Shanghai. His most famous short story is probably \\"An Evening of Spring Rain\\" (Meiyu zhi xi Ê¢ÖÈõ®‰πãÂ§ï). His works set in Shanghai frequently deal with the inner lives of the protagonists as they are beset by irrational fears and desires. After the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, Shi Zhecun moved to Yunnan in 1937. He held university posts and translated novels by Arthur Schnitzler among others. He became a scholar on classical culture and did research on Tang Dynasty poetry and stele inscriptions. In 1947 he returned to Shanghai and began writing essays, and after the Cultural Revolution, his memoirs. His creative works were long considered politically suspect by the Chinese government because in 1957 he published the essay Talent and Morality and was classified as a rightist and subjected to persecution. From that time and onwards he bid farewell to literary creation and translation and turned to the study of classical literature and tablet inscriptions jobs. But there has been mounting interest since the 1980s due to the influx of modernist thoughts into China. His works have been republished in recent years. He died on 19 November 2003 in Shanghai. Awards * In view of his contribution to the literary creation and academic research, Shi Zhecun was awarded the Outstanding Contribution to Shanghai Literature and Art Award (1993) * He also obtained the Asian Chinese Writer Literary Foundation Consolation Award.

Background Prokofiev, along with other composers, was evacuated to the Caucasus when Germany started attacking the Soviet Union in 1941. It was under such circumstances that Prokofiev began work on this symphonic suite. He was working on his epic opera War and Peace and the String Quartet No. 2 at the same time. Movements The whole suite lasts for around 15 minutes. #In the Struggle ‚Äì The composer described this as ‚Äúa scene of heated battle, heard by the audience sometimes as though far away and sometimes as though on the actual battlefield.‚Äù #In the Night ‚Äì ‚Äúa poetic night scene disturbed by the tension of impending conflict.‚Äù #For the Brotherhood of Man ‚Äì ‚Äúa triumphant lyrical hymn to victory and the brotherhood of peoples.‚Äù Instrumentation The suite is scored for 2 flutes, piccolo, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 2 trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, triangle, wood block, side drum, tambourine, cymbals, harp, and strings. Criticism Dmitri Shostakovich criticized the work's weak movements, lack of development and thought that the materials were under-developed and not thought through. Even Nikolai Myaskovsky, Prokofiev's closest friend, did not like the work. The suite has been described as evoking cold, abstract and inexpressive images in an attempt to oversimplify for greater clarity and comprehensibility. However, the work does contain a wealth of melodic material and Prokofiev later used some of the ideas and motives for the film score to Igor Savchenko‚Äôs depiction of the events of the Great Patriotic War, Partisans in the Ukrainian Steppes (1942, film released 1943). In 1948, Party officials, namely Tikhon Khrennikov, deemed the music unworthy of truly depicting the momentous events of the Great Patriotic War, and the Central Committee criticized it for its ‚Äúanti-democratic, formalist tendency.‚Äù Sovetskaya Muzyka (Soviet Music magazine) also noted that ‚Äúthe music of the Suite, while at times very poetic, does not penetrate to the core of the events which are indissolubly associated, in our minds, with the tragic year of 1941.‚Äù The Year 1941 remained unpublished and was subsequently barred from performance.

While the sitar had earlier been used in jazz and Indian film music, it was from the 1960s onwards that various pop artists in the Western world began to experiment with incorporating the sitar, a classical Indian stringed instrument, within their compositions.  Early uses in Western pop music  Before the sitar was first used on a Western pop recording, the instrument's drone had been imitated on electric guitar by the Kinks on their 1965 single \\"See My Friends\\". Another English band, the Yardbirds, hired a sitar player to play the main riff on their song \\"Heart Full of Soul\\", but the group subsequently re-recorded the track without a sitar part. The first pop release to feature sitar was instead \\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\\", issued on the Beatles' Rubber Soul album in December 1965. With this sitar part, George Harrison became the first Western musician to play an Indian instrument on a commercial recording.Sitar and other Indian instrumentation had appeared on the US release of the Beatles' Help! soundtrack album, in an instrumental piece titled \\"Another Hard Day's Night\\". These parts were played by British-based Indian session musicians. Harrison is recognised as having introduced the sitar to pop music due to the Beatles' popularity and cultural influence. He first picked up a sitar on the set of the Beatles' 1965 film Help!, and then purchased one of his own following a discussion about Indian classical music with David Crosby and Roger McGuinn of the Byrds in August 1965. Harrison went on to write and record \\"Love You To\\" for the Beatles' 1966 album Revolver as an Indian-style track featuring sitar, tambura and tabla. The following year, he wrote \\"Within You Without You\\" in the full Indian classical style and recorded it with musicians from the Asian Music Circle for inclusion on the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. From June 1966, he became a student of Indian sitarist Ravi Shankar and subsequently studied in India with Shankar and the latter's prot√©g√© Shambhu Das. In addition to introducing other Indian instrumentation on the Beatles' recordings over 1966‚Äì68, Harrison played sitar and tambura on \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" and \\"Across the Universe\\". In early 1966, Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones played sitar on \\"Paint It Black\\", having received tuition from another prot√©g√© of Shankar, Harihar Rao, and after consulting Harrison about the part. Jones also used sitar on some tracks on the Rolling Stones' 1967 album Their Satanic Majesties Request. He again played the instrument on \\"My Little One\\" in an October 1967 recording session with Jimi Hendrix, as well as tambura on the Stones' 1968 single \\"Street Fighting Man\\". Widespread popularity, 1966‚Äì68 Shankar credited Harrison with inspiring \\"the great sitar explosion\\" in the West, as many rock guitarists similarly adopted the instrument. A fad for sitars in pop songs soon developed, facilitated by the Danelectro Company's 1967 introduction of the first \\"electric sitar\\", known as the \\"Coral Electric Sitar\\". This instrument was an electric guitar with a distinctive sitar-like sound, rather than an acoustic sitar of the type traditionally made in India. As the electric sitar was much easier to play than the traditional version, it quickly became the preferred choice of many rock musicians. Guitarists such as Harrison, Jones, Big Jim Sullivan and Shawn Phillips were more dedicated in their approach as sitarists, however. Author Peter Lavezzoli also highlights Traffic's Dave Mason as a guitarist who displayed an obvious skill as a sitar player. From 1966 onwards, hundreds of songs by pop artists featured sitar. The late 1960s saw the release of songs featuring the sitar that included Ricky Nelson's \\"Marshmallow Skies\\", Scott McKenzie's \\"San Francisco\\", The Cyrkle's \\"Turn-Down Day\\", The Cowsills' \\"The Rain, the Park, and Other Things\\", John Fred and His Playboy Band's \\"Judy in Disguise (With Glasses)\\", The Turtles \\"Sound Asleep\\", The Stone Poneys \\"Evergreen\\", First Edition \\"Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)\\", The Chocolate Watch Band's \\"In the Past\\", The Box Tops' \\"Cry Like a Baby\\" (electric sitar), The Lemon Pipers' \\"Green Tambourine\\" (electric sitar), Traffic's \\"Paper Sun\\" and \\"Hole In My Shoe\\" Tomorrow's \\"Real Life Permanent Dream\\", July's \\"The Way\\" and The Kinks' \\"Fancy\\". Elvis Presley had several recordings that feature the electric sitar. These include a 1967 cover of Tommy Tucker's R&B; classic \\"Hi-Heel Sneakers\\", Mort Shuman's \\"You'll Think of Me\\" (1969), Percy Mayfield's \\"Stranger in My Own Home Town\\" (1969) and a cover of the Anne Murray country song \\"Snowbird\\" (1970). On \\"Hi-Heel Sneakers\\" and \\"Snowbird\\", the parts were played by session guitarist Harold Bradley, while Reggie Young played the instrument on \\"You'll Think of Me\\" and \\"Stranger in My Own Home Town\\".\\"Elvis Presley: A Life In Music\\" St. Martin's Press, July, 1998 Ernst Jorgensen, Foreword by Peter Guralnick. Pages 234‚Äì236, 264, 269, 275, 316‚Äì317 The Mamas & The Papas included the sitar on tracks such as \\"People Like Us\\", \\"Snowqueen Of Texas', \\"Lady Genevieve\\", \\"I Wanna Be a Star\\" and \\"Grasshopper\\", and Sergio Mendes & Brazil '66 used it on ‚ÄúChove Chuva‚Äù. Eric Burdon and the Animals played the instrument in the songs \\"Winds of Change\\", \\"No Self Pity\\", \\"Orange and Red Beams\\", \\"All Is One\\", \\"We Love You Lil\\" and \\"Monterey\\". The Strawberry Alarm Clock use the sitar in songs such as \\"An Angry Young Man\\", \\"Black Butter-Present\\" and \\"Sit with the Guru\\". Although often overlooked, some of the most extensive users of the instrument in contemporary music were Mike Heron and Robin Williamson of The Incredible String Band, combining folk, psychedelia with eastern influences in the songs \\"The Song Has No Ending Parts 1‚Äì9\\", \\"The Mad Hatter's Song\\" and \\"The Iron Stone\\". Steve Miller Band used sitar in their song \\"Wild Mountain Honey\\". Art- rock bands such as The Moody Blues used the sitar on a few albums, particularly In Search of the Lost Chord. The Pretty Things' album S.F. Sorrow also featured the instrument on a few tracks, as did Procol Harum's song \\"In Held 'Twas In I\\", on the segment \\"Glimpses of Nirvana\\". Jethro Tull used the sitar on \\"Fat Man\\" and \\"Skating Away on the Thin Ice of the New Day\\", and the Strawbs included the instrument on many of their recordings. Family used sitar in the song \\"Face in the Cloud\\", released on the band's 1969 album Family Entertainment. Donovan's hit song \\"Hurdy Gurdy Man\\" used a tambura, which can also be heard on songs such as \\"Sunny South Kensington\\", \\"Breezes of Patchouli\\", \\"Celeste\\", \\"Guinevere\\", \\"Three King Fishers\\", \\"Ferris Wheel\\" and \\"Fat Angel\\". Roy Wood from The Move played sitar on \\"Night of Fear\\" using the same riffs as Tchaikovsky's \\"1812 Overture\\", as well as the electric sitar on \\"Open up said the world at the door\\". The Dutch band Shocking Blue used the sitar in many of their songs, most prominently in \\"Love Buzz\\", \\"Acka Raga\\", \\"Water Boy\\", \\"Hot Sand\\" and \\"I'm A Woman\\". Richie Havens made extensive use of the sitar in the title track of his second album, Something Else Again. Blue Cheer used both sitar and tabla in their song \\"Babji (Twilight Raga)\\". Subsequent usage Although the sitar craze had died down by 1970, its distinctive sound had become an indelible part of pop music. Genesis used the electric sitar on \\"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)\\", from their fifth album Selling England by the Pound. Steve Howe of Yes used an electric sitar on the band's album Close to the Edge. Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers used a guitar fitted with a harpsichord-device to simulate a sitar for their 1985 hit \\"Don't Come Around Here No More\\". John Renbourn used the instrument prominently during his time with the folk band Pentangle, on songs such as \\"Once I Had a Sweetheart\\", \\"House Carpenter\\", \\"Cruel Sister\\", \\"Rain and Snow\\" and \\"The Snows\\". Metallica used a sitar during the intro of their 1991 song \\"Wherever I May Roam\\". Although the sitar is not a regular staple in country music, it can be heard in Hank Williams Jr.‚Äôs A Country Boy Can Survive off his 1981 studio album The Pressure Is On and was played by Reggie Young, as listed in the ‚ÄòPersonnel‚Äô section on the album‚Äôs WikiPedia page. Although his period of dedicated sitar study ended in 1968, Harrison continued to champion Indian classical music. In addition to producing recordings by Shankar, Harrison included sitar in \\"Be Here Now\\", \\"When We Was Fab\\" and other songs from his solo career, as well as in the Traveling Wilburys' 1990 track \\"The Devil's Been Busy\\".

He was a political activist during his youth, leading towards reformist socialism, and obtained a degree in jurisprudence. He went on to become a prominent TV journalist, working for twenty years for RAI, on programmes such as TG2 and TG3, heading the Tuscany journalistic department of RAI, working with Giovanni Minoli (on programmes such as \\"Cronaca in Diretta\\", \\"Drugstories\\", and \\"Format\\"), and finally becoming the anchorman for eight consecutive years of \\"Mi Manda Rai Tre\\", for which he is most remembered. In November 2004 he left his job to run for presidency of Lazio as the candidate of centre-left coalition L'Unione; he won the April 2005 regional elections attracting 50.7% of votes. He suspended himself from his role on Saturday 24 October 2009, after 4 carabinieri officers allegedly tried to blackmail him with video footage, purporting to reveal him in a bedroom with a transsexual prostitute, where a limited quantity of cocaine was also present.

A salt that is normally liquid even at standard temperature and pressure is usually called a room temperature ionic liquid, although technically molten salts are a class of ionic liquids. Uses Molten salts have a variety of uses. Molten chloride salt mixtures are commonly used as baths for various alloy heat treatments, such as annealing and martempering of steel. Cyanide and chloride salt mixtures are used for surface modification of alloys such as carburizing and nitrocarburizing of steel. Cryolite (a fluoride salt) is used as a solvent for aluminium oxide in the production of aluminium in the Hall-H√©roult process. Fluoride, chloride, and hydroxide salts can be used as solvents in pyroprocessing of nuclear fuel. Molten salts (fluoride, chloride, and nitrate) can also be used as heat transfer fluids as well as for thermal storage. This thermal storage is commonly used in molten salt power plants. A commonly used thermal salt is the eutectic mixture of 60% sodium nitrate and 40% potassium nitrate, which can be used as liquid between 260-550 ¬∞C. It has a heat of fusion of 161 J/g,\\"Molten salts properties\\" and a heat capacity of 1.53 J/(g K).

Where the Swakop meets the Atlantic Ocean (2017). Poles of the old railway bridge seen in the foreground. Aerial view of Swakop River (2017). The Swakop River () is a major river in western central Namibia. Its river source is in the Khomas Highland. From there it flows westwards through the town of Okahandja, the historic mission station at Gross Barmen, and the settlement of Otjimbingwe. It then crosses the Namib desert and reaches the Atlantic Ocean at Swakopmund (). The Swakop is an ephemeral river; its run-off is roughly 40 million cubic metres per annum. The Swakop River, along with its main tributary Khan, is one of the largest temporary water-bearing rivers in the dry western part of Namibia. It is long and has a large catchment area (including its tributaries). The name comes from the Khoekhoe languages of the Nama and Damara Tsoa-xaub. Tsoa means ‚Äòexcrement opening‚Äô or ‚Äòanus‚Äò while xaub stands for the ‚Äòcontents of excrement.‚Äô This name derives from the observation that the flow of large amounts of brownish sludge in the rain with it and discharges into the Atlantic Ocean. The area around the river mouth and the surrounding dunes are also known for rich bird life and some unusual plant species (like the Welwitschia) that use the regular fog drifting in from the sea to sustain themselves in the absence of other moisture. Groundwater levels in the area have also dropped about 0.3 m further due to the presence of two big dams built on the Swakop River. Notwithstanding the river‚Äôs irregular flow, some agriculture is undertaken in the Swakop River valley, thus the region is well known for its fresh produce, especially tomatoes, asparagus and olives. There are some fears of salt and uranium (possibly natural, possibly from the R√∂ssing uranium mine) endangering this farming industry.Uranium in groundwater 'not serious': Roessing - The Namibian, Friday 24 June 2005 Hydrology The Swakop drains a catchment area of 30,100 km¬≤ extending from the mouth into the Atlantic Ocean at Swakopmund over Otjimbingwe and in the east to about 50 km from Okahandja, and in the south to Khomas Highlands outside Windhoek. The highest point of the watershed is located at 2480 m. Annual rainfall varies from 0 mm in the lower reaches up to 475 mm in the eastern Khomas Highlands. 39% of the catchment area experiences rainfall that exceeds 300 mm per year, and up to 80% of the catchment experiences annual rainfall above 100 mm. The Von Bach Dam near Okahandja and Swakoppoort Dam west of Gross Barmen in the upper reaches of the Swakop are of great importance for the water supply of Central Namibia. Like all rivers, the Swakop also has a number of major sources and major wetlands in the lower reaches. Existing groundwater, however, is often salty due to soil salinity. On the lower reaches of the river, flooding has become ever more increasing, due to increased land use of the Swakop gallery forests. This contributes to a stronger and more rapid runoff and increased erosion of the Swakop Marshlands.  Vegetation and fauna Because of its size and scope, the Swakop has a very diverse catchment area. 29% of the area is in highveld savanna, 28% in thornveld savanna, 34% in semidesert and savanna transition zone, and 9% in the central Namib Desert. In the Highlands a more or less dense bush vegetation prevails. In the arid lower reaches there is a more limited flora on the Swakop River valley itself, with the typical gallery vegetation from ana trees (Faidherbia albida), tamarisk (Tamarix), camel thorn (Acacia erioloba), Salvadora, various fig species, Euclea and also tobacco (Nicotiana spp.), Jimsonweed (Datura) and mesquite (Prosopis spp.) as invasive species. Wildlife in the Swakop is found practically only in sparsely populated lower reaches and is limited to antelope, smaller predators and birds. Big game such as elephants, rhinos, lions and other big cats are no longer to be found. In the rest of the catchment area, there are, however, a number of tourist and game farms, and the big cats are kept there.  Usage and colonisation The farm of Goanikontes in Swakop River, circa 1906. Unlike the rest of the dry rivers in western Namibia, there are large human settlements in the basin of the Swakop River, such as the towns Usakos, Karibib, Otjimbingwe, Okahandja and Namibia's capital, Windhoek, so that the population is in the catchment area is more than 200,000 persons. While in the upper reaches of the river the farms are often far from the river and extensive grazing is operated, the dams and the high ground water level along the entire Swakop River Valley make intensive farming and even gardening, such as the cultivation of asparagus in Swakopmund Goanikontes, possible. The extensive use of the groundwater in agriculture and the high water consumption in cities result in the lowering of the water table. This leads, particularly in the lower reaches, to the drying up of many springs as well as to the death of the gallery vegetation. Due to agricultural practices, erosion has greatly increased, so that more and more valuable ground is lost and the intensity of the Swakop floods increases. The uranium mines, such as the Langer Heinrich mine in the lower reaches of the Swakop, and the R√∂ssing Mine at Khan, not only use enormous quantities of water that further lowers the water table. In addition, it is also often claimed that radioactive dust across the Khan gets into the Swakop, and therefore the vegetables cultivated there are contaminated by radioactive materials. The Swakop Bridge in Swakopmund is a notable man made sight near the place where the river empties into the ocean.

Salih and Yurdugal Ay were Kurds seeking asylum who came to the UK to escape persecution in Turkey, it being alleged that Mrs Ay had been locked up and raped by Turkish militia. They brought their four children with them and settled in Gravesend in Kent where the children attended local schools. Salih was deported to Germany and from there further deported back to Turkey where he disappeared. In 2002, Yurdugal Ay and her children were suddenly removed from their home by immigration officials and taken to Dungavel detention centre in South Lanarkshire, Scotland. They were all put together in one room where they lived for a year inside a razor wire surrounded compound. Yurdugal could not speak English very well so it was up to her eldest daughter, Beriwan Ay aged 13, to negotiate for her mother and her sisters. The family were threatened with deportation but appealed. It was claimed by the authorities that they had brought the long stay at Dungavel upon themselves by this appeal. Conditions in the privatised detention centre, run by the American private-prison operator GEO Group, were far from satisfactory. There were no proper education facilities for the children. The children were treated as prisoners with just 2 hours exercise outside allowed each day. There were very limited play facilities. The Children's Commissioner for Scotland described the situation there as 'morally distressing' and threatened to report the UK Government and Scottish Executive to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The British Home Secretary at the time David Blunkett appeared to disregard various conventions on human rights requirements about not imprisoning children claiming that the other alternative ‚Äî separating the children from their parents and putting them into care ‚Äî was also undesirable. Bishop John Mone met Beriwan Ay on a visit to Dungavel and was appalled by what he discovered. During a later visit he smuggled a video camera into the centre [clergymen not being searched there], interviewed Beriwan to camera and released the video to the media. This was shown on BBC television's Newsnight programme. The case was also taken up by the Herald newspaper. A media storm ensued. The Scottish Executive had responsibilities for children's welfare in Scotland but was clashing with a non devolved act from the UK parliament in Westminster. Eventually the Ay family lost their appeal against deportation and were forcibly deported via Stansted Airport to Germany where they were granted asylum. On 27 October 2006 BBC Radio 4 broadcast a play by Frank Deasy called Broken English portraying the case from Beriwan Ay's point of view.

Many of these later models and machines would more closely resemble the ancient bamboo flying top with spinning wings, rather than Leonardo's screw. In July 1754, Russian Mikhail Lomonosov had developed a small coaxial modeled after the Chinese top but powered by a wound-up spring device Leishman, J. Gordon (2006). Principles of Helicopter Aerodynamics. Cambridge University Press. p. 8. and demonstrated it to the Russian Academy of Sciences. It was powered by a spring, and was suggested as a method to lift meteorological instruments. In 1783, Christian de Launoy, and his mechanic, Bienvenu, used a coaxial version of the Chinese top in a model consisting of contrarotating turkey flight feathers as rotor blades, and in 1784, demonstrated it to the French Academy of Sciences. A dirigible airship was described by Jean Baptiste Marie Meusnier presented in 1783. The drawings depict a streamlined envelope with internal ballonets that could be used for regulating lift. The airship was designed to be driven by three propellers. In 1784 Jean-Pierre Blanchard fitted a hand-powered propeller to a balloon, the first recorded means of propulsion carried aloft.Winter & Degner (1933), pp. 26‚Äì27. Sir George Cayley, influenced by a childhood fascination with the Chinese flying top, developed a model of feathers, similar to that of Launoy and Bienvenu, but powered by rubber bands. By the end of the century, he had progressed to using sheets of tin for rotor blades and springs for power. His writings on his experiments and models would become influential on future aviation pioneers. Prototype created by Mikhail Lomonosov, 1754 William Bland sent designs for his \\"Atmotic Airship\\" to the Great Exhibition held in London in 1851, where a model was displayed.

Hiram Maxim built a craft that weighed 3.5 tons, with a 110-foot (34-meter) wingspan that was powered by two 360-horsepower (270-kW) steam engines driving two propellers.

Dreams and Realities of the Conquest of the Skies. New York: Atheneum. pp. 124‚Äì125 One of P√©naud's toys, given as a gift by their father, inspired the Wright brothers to pursue the dream of flight. The twisted airfoil (aerofoil) shape of an aircraft propeller was pioneered by the Wright brothers. While some earlier engineers had attempted to model air propellers on marine propellers, the Wright Brothers realized that a propeller is essentially the same as a wing, and were able to use data from their earlier wind tunnel experiments on wings, introducing a twist along the length of the blades. This was necessary to maintain a more uniform angle of attack of the blade along its length. Their original propeller blades had an efficiency of about 82%,Ash, Robert L., Colin P. Britcher and Kenneth W. Hyde. \\"Wrights: How two brothers from Dayton added a new twist to airplane propulsion.\\" Mechanical Engineering: 100 years of Flight, 3 July 2007. compared to 90% for a modern (2010) small general aviation propeller, the 3-blade McCauley used on a Beechcraft Bonanza aircraft.Rogers, David F. \\"Propeller Efficiency \\", Figure 3.

Mahogany was the wood preferred for propellers through World War I, but wartime shortages encouraged use of walnut, oak, cherry and ash. Alberto Santos Dumont was another early pioneer, having designed propellers before the Wright Brothers (albeit not as efficient)Henri R. Palmer Jr. \\"The birdcage parasol\\", Flying Magazine Oct. 1960 p. 51 for his airships. He applied the knowledge he gained from experiences with airships to make a propeller with a steel shaft and aluminium blades for his 14 bis biplane in 1906. Some of his designs used a bent aluminium sheet for blades, thus creating an airfoil shape. They were heavily undercambered, and this plus the absence of lengthwise twist made them less efficient than the Wright propellers.Physical propeller theory was at the time restricted to the Rankine‚ÄìFroude theory, also known as the \\"actuator disc theory\\" or the axial momentum theory. That theory, however adequate, does not give indication on the shape that should be given to the propeller. This would be solved regarding that theory only in the 1920s by complement of the Betz law (Goldstein, Betz, Prandtl and Lanchester): William Graebel, Engineering Fluid Mechanics, p. 144, , John Carlton, Marine Propellers and Propulsion, p. 169, . The Wright brothers however were equating the propeller blade to an airfoil instead, which for they previously had already determined the aerodynamic behavioural patterns: John David Anderson, A History of Aerodynamics: And Its Impact on Flying Machines, Even so, this was perhaps the first use of aluminium in the construction of an airscrew. Originally, a rotating airfoil behind the aircraft, which pushes it, was called a propeller, while one which pulled from the front was a tractor.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1910 edition, volume 30 (1922 supplement), in the article \\"Aeronautics\\" p. 20. \\"Airscrews have been described as 'tractors' and 'propellers', according as the airscrew shaft is placed in tension or in compression by the thrust, and corresponding aeroplanes are usually called by the same names. The first biplanes, those of the Wrights and the Farmans, were of the propeller type, colloquially 'pushers'; almost all monoplanes were 'tractors.' Later the term 'pusher' became adopted for the rear-mounted device in contrast to the tractor configuration and both became referred to as 'propellers' or 'airscrews'. The understanding of low speed propeller aerodynamics was fairly complete by the 1920s, but later requirements to handle more power in a smaller diameter have made the problem more complex. Propeller research for National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) was directed by William F. Durand from 1916. Parameters measured included propeller efficiency, thrust developed, and power absorbed. While a propeller may be tested in a wind tunnel, its performance in free-flight might differ. At the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, E. P. Leslie used Vought VE-7s with Wright E-4 engines for data on free-flight, while Durand used reduced size, with similar shape, for wind tunnel data. Their results were published in 1926 as NACA report #220.William Durand & E. P. Leslie (1926) Comparison of tests on air propellers in flight with wind tunnel model tests on similar forms, National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics # 220 Theory and design of aircraft propellers ATR 72 propeller in flight. Lowry quotes a propeller efficiency of about 73.5% at cruise for a Cessna 172. This is derived from his \\"Bootstrap approach\\" for analyzing the performance of light general aviation aircraft using fixed pitch or constant speed propellers. The efficiency of the propeller is influenced by the angle of attack (Œ±). This is defined as Œ± = Œ¶ - Œ∏, where Œ∏ is the helix angle (the angle between the resultant relative velocity and the blade rotation direction) and Œ¶ is the blade pitch angle. Very small pitch and helix angles give a good performance against resistance but provide little thrust, while larger angles have the opposite effect. The best helix angle is when the blade is acting as a wing producing much more lift than drag. However, 'lift-and-drag' is only one way to express the aerodynamic force on the blades. To explain aircraft and engine performance the same force is expressed slightly differently in terms of thrust and torquehttps://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.205354 Fig 1-8 since the required output of the propeller is thrust. Thrust and torque are the basis of the definition for the efficiency of the propeller as shown below. The advance ratio of a propeller is similar to the angle of attack of a wing. A propeller's efficiency is determined byProf. Z. S. Spakovszky . \\"11.7.4.3 Efficiency \\" MIT turbines, 2002. Thermodynamics and Propulsion, main page :\\\\eta = \\\\frac{\\\\hbox{propulsive power out}}{\\\\hbox{shaft power in}} = \\\\frac{\\\\hbox{thrust}\\\\cdot\\\\hbox{axial speed}}{\\\\hbox{resistance torque}\\\\cdot\\\\hbox{rotational speed}}. Propellers are similar in aerofoil section to a low-drag wing and as such are poor in operation when at other than their optimum angle of attack. Therefore, most propellers use a variable pitch mechanism to alter the blades' pitch angle as engine speed and aircraft velocity are changed. A sailor checks the propeller of a Landing Craft Air Cushion hovercraft A further consideration is the number and the shape of the blades used. Increasing the aspect ratio of the blades reduces drag but the amount of thrust produced depends on blade area, so using high-aspect blades can result in an excessive propeller diameter. A further balance is that using a smaller number of blades reduces interference effects between the blades, but to have sufficient blade area to transmit the available power within a set diameter means a compromise is needed. Increasing the number of blades also decreases the amount of work each blade is required to perform, limiting the local Mach number ‚Äì a significant performance limit on propellers. The performance of a propeller suffers when transonic flow first appears on the tips of the blades. As the relative air speed at any section of a propeller is a vector sum of the aircraft speed and the tangential speed due to rotation, the flow over the blade tip will reach transonic speed well before the aircraft does. When the airflow over the tip of the blade reaches its critical speed, drag and torque resistance increase rapidly and shock waves form creating a sharp increase in noise. Aircraft with conventional propellers, therefore, do not usually fly faster than Mach 0.6. There have been propeller aircraft which attained up to the Mach 0.8 range, but the low propeller efficiency at this speed makes such applications rare. =Blade twist= The tip of a propeller blade travels faster than the hub. Therefore, it is necessary for the blade to be twisted so as to maintain a uniform angle of attack over the whole of the blade. =High-speed propellers= There have been efforts to develop propellers and propfans for aircraft at high subsonic speeds.Pushing The Envelope With Test Pilot Herb Fisher. Planes and Pilots of World War 2, 2000. Retrieved: 22 July 2011. The 'fix' is similar to that of transonic wing design. Thin blade sections are used and the blades are swept back in a scimitar shape (scimitar propeller) in a manner similar to wing sweepback, so as to delay the onset of shockwaves as the blade tips approach the speed of sound. The maximum relative velocity is kept as low as possible by careful control of pitch to allow the blades to have large helix angles. A large number of blades are used to reduce work per blade and so circulation strength. Contra-rotating propellers are used. The propellers designed are more efficient than turbo-fans and their cruising speed (Mach 0.7‚Äì0.85) is suitable for airliners, but the noise generated is tremendous (see the Antonov An-70 and Tupolev Tu-95 for examples of such a design). =Forces acting on a propeller= Forces acting on the blades of an aircraft propeller include the following. Some of these forces can be arranged to counteract each other, reducing the overall mechanical stresses imposed. ;Thrust bending :Thrust loads on the blades, in reaction to the force pushing the air backwards, act to bend the blades forward. Blades are therefore often raked forwards, such that the outward centrifugal force of rotation acts to bend them backwards, thus balancing out the bending effects. ;Centrifugal and aerodynamic twisting :A centrifugal twisting force is experienced by any asymmetrical spinning object. In the propeller it acts to twist the blades to a fine pitch. The aerodynamic centre of pressure is therefore usually arranged to be slightly forward of its mechanical centreline, creating a twisting moment towards coarse pitch and counteracting the centrifugal moment. However in a high-speed dive the aerodynamic force can change significantly and the moments can become unbalanced. ;Centrifugal :The force felt by the blades acting to pull them away from the hub when turning. It can be arranged to help counteract the thrust bending force, as described above. ;Torque bending :Air resistance acting against the blades, combined with inertial effects causes propeller blades to bend away from the direction of rotation. ;Vibratory :Many types of disturbance set up vibratory forces in blades. These include aerodynamic excitation as the blades pass close to the wing and fuselage. Piston engines introduce torque impulses which may excite vibratory modes of the blades and cause fatigue failures.Nelson, Wilbur C. (1944), Airplane Propeller Principles p.67 Torque impulses are not present when driven by a gas turbine engine. Variable pitch The purpose of varying pitch angle is to maintain an optimal angle of attack for the propeller blades, giving maximum efficiency throughout the flight regime. This reduces fuel usage. Only by maximising propeller efficiency at high speeds can the highest possible speed be achieved.https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.163729/2015.163729.Aircraft- Propeller-Design#page/n107/mode/2up p.97 Effective angle of attack descreases as airspeed increases, so a coarser pitch is required at high airspeeds. The requirement for pitch variation is shown by the propeller performance during the Schneider Trophy competition in 1931. The Fairey Aviation Company fixed- pitch propeller used was stalled on take-off up to 160 mph on its way up to a top speed of 407.5 mph. The very wide speed range was achieved because some of the usual requirements for aircraft performance did not apply. There was no compromise on top-speed efficiency, the take-off distance was not restricted to available runway length and there was no climb requirement. The variable pitch blades used on the Tupolev Tu-95 propel it at a speed exceeding the maximum once considered possible for a propeller-driven aircraft\\"Jane's All The World's Aircraft 1982-1983, Jane's Publishing Company Limited, , p.228 using an exceptionally coarse pitch.The Development Of Jet And Turbine Engines\\", 4th edition, Bill Gunston 2006, Patrick Stephens Limited, , p.66 =Mechanisms= Cut-away view of a Hamilton Standard propeller. This type of constant-speed propeller was used on many American fighters, bombers and transport aircraft of World War II Early pitch control settings were pilot operated, either with a small number of preset positions or continuously variable. The simplest mechanism is the ground-adjustable propeller, which may be adjusted on the ground, but is effectively a fixed-pitch prop once airborne. The spring-loaded \\"two-speed\\" VP prop is set to fine for takeoff, and then triggered to coarse once in cruise, the propeller remaining coarse for the remainder of the flight. After World War I, automatic propellers were developed to maintain an optimum angle of attack. This was done by balancing the centripetal twisting moment on the blades and a set of counterweights against a spring and the aerodynamic forces on the blade. Automatic props had the advantage of being simple, lightweight, and requiring no external control, but a particular propeller's performance was difficult to match with that of the aircraft's power plant. The most common variable pitch propeller is the constant-speed propeller. This is controlled by a hydraulic constant speed unit (CSU). It automatically adjusts the blade pitch in order to maintain a constant engine speed for any given power control setting. Constant-speed propellers allow the pilot to set a rotational speed according to the need for maximum engine power or maximum efficiency, and a propeller governor acts as a closed-loop controller to vary propeller pitch angle as required to maintain the selected engine speed. In most aircraft this system is hydraulic, with engine oil serving as the hydraulic fluid. However, electrically controlled propellers were developed during World War II and saw extensive use on military aircraft, and have recently seen a revival in use on home-built aircraft. Another design is the V-Prop, which is self-powering and self- governing. = Feathering = TP400 turboprop of an Airbus A400M On most variable-pitch propellers, the blades can be rotated parallel to the airflow to stop rotation of the propeller and reduce drag when the engine fails or is deliberately shut down. This is called feathering, a term borrowed from rowing. On single-engined aircraft, whether a powered glider or turbine- powered aircraft, the effect is to increase the gliding distance. On a multi- engine aircraft, feathering the propeller on an inoperative engine reduces drag, and helps the aircraft maintain speed and altitude with the operative engines. Most feathering systems for reciprocating engines sense a drop in oil pressure and move the blades toward the feather position, and require the pilot to pull the propeller control back to disengage the high-pitch stop pins before the engine reaches idle RPM. Turboprop control systems usually utilize a negative torque sensor in the reduction gearbox which moves the blades toward feather when the engine is no longer providing power to the propeller. Depending on design, the pilot may have to push a button to override the high- pitch stops and complete the feathering process, or the feathering process may be totally automatic. =Reverse pitch= The propellers on some aircraft can operate with a negative blade pitch angle, and thus reverse the thrust from the propeller. This is known as Beta Pitch. Reverse thrust is used to help slow the aircraft after landing and is particularly advantageous when landing on a wet runway as wheel braking suffers reduced effectiveness. In some cases reverse pitch allows the aircraft to taxi in reverse ‚Äì this is particularly useful for getting floatplanes out of confined docks. Counter-rotating propellers Counter-rotating propellers Counter-rotating propellers are sometimes used on twin-engine and multi-engine aircraft with wing-mounted engines. These propellers turn in opposite directions from their counterpart on the other wing to balance out the torque and p-factor effects. They are sometimes referred to as \\"handed\\" propellers since there are left hand and right hand versions of each prop. Generally, the propellers on both engines of most conventional twin-engined aircraft spin clockwise (as viewed from the rear of the aircraft). To eliminate the critical engine problem, counter- rotating propellers usually spin \\"inwards\\" towards the fuselage ‚Äì clockwise on the left engine and counter-clockwise on the right ‚Äì but there are exceptions (especially during World War II) such as the P-38 Lightning which spun \\"outwards\\" away from the fuselage from the WW II years, and the Airbus A400 whose inboard and outboard engines turn in opposite directions even on the same wing. Contra-rotating propeller A contra-rotating propeller or contra-prop places two counter-rotating propellers on concentric drive shafts so that one sits immediately 'downstream' of the other propeller. This provides the benefits of counter-rotating propellers for a single powerplant. The forward propeller provides the majority of the thrust, while the rear propeller also recovers energy lost in the swirling motion of the air in the propeller slipstream. Contra-rotation also increases the ability of a propeller to absorb power from a given engine, without increasing propeller diameter. However the added cost, complexity, weight and noise of the system rarely make it worthwhile and it is only used on high-performance types where ultimate performance is more important than efficiency. Aircraft fans A fan is a propeller with a large number of blades. A fan therefore produces a lot of thrust for a given diameter but the closeness of the blades means that each strongly affects the flow around the others. If the flow is supersonic, this interference can be beneficial if the flow can be compressed through a series of shock waves rather than one. By placing the fan within a shaped duct, specific flow patterns can be created depending on flight speed and engine performance. As air enters the duct, its speed is reduced while its pressure and temperature increase. If the aircraft is at a high subsonic speed this creates two advantages: the air enters the fan at a lower Mach speed; and the higher temperature increases the local speed of sound. While there is a loss in efficiency as the fan is drawing on a smaller area of the free stream and so using less air, this is balanced by the ducted fan retaining efficiency at higher speeds where conventional propeller efficiency would be poor. A ducted fan or propeller also has certain benefits at lower speeds but the duct needs to be shaped in a different manner than one for higher speed flight. More air is taken in and the fan therefore operates at an efficiency equivalent to a larger un-ducted propeller. Noise is also reduced by the ducting and should a blade become detached the duct would help contain the damage. However the duct adds weight, cost, complexity and (to a certain degree) drag.

Established in 1970, the club lays claim to the traditions of predecessor Bar-Kochba Berlin.  History  Created in 1898, predecessor club Bar Kochba Berlin was one of the largest Jewish organizations in the world by 1930 with over 40,000 members from 24 countries, part of the general Bar Kochba movement intended to promote physical education and Jewish heritage. The club fielded teams in several sports including a football side which competed in the city leagues between 1911 and 1929. In 1924, Lilli Henoch, the world record holder in the discus, shot put, and 4 √ó 100 meters relay events, trained the women's section in the club. In 1929 Bar Kochba merged with Hakoah Berlin to form the sports club Bar Kochba-Hakoah. The Hakoah side had enjoyed increasing success, capturing three consecutive lower division championships between 1925 and 1927. They were promoted each time until, by 1928, they were playing first tier football. The newly combined side continued to compete as Hakoah after 1929. The rise to power of the Nazis in the early 1930s led to discrimination against Jews and by 1933 Jewish teams were excluded from general competition and limited to play in separate leagues or tournaments. In 1938 Jewish teams were banned outright as discrimination turned to persecution. Historical logo of Makkabi Berlin Logo of predecessor side Hakoah Berlin In the aftermath of World War II Jewish sports and cultural associations eventually re-emerged in Germany. On 26 November 1970 TuS Makkabi Berlin was formed out of the merger of Bar-Kochba Berlin (gymnastics and athletics), Hakoah Berlin (football, re-established 1945) and Makkabi Berlin (boxing). The football side of the club played in third and fourth tier competition in the 1970s and 1980s before leaving to join FV Wannsee in 1987. Wannsee also played as a third and fourth division side until collapsing in the mid-90s and slipping first to the Landesliga Berlin-2 (VI) and then to the Bezirksliga Berlin (VII) by the end of the decade. Makkabi's footballers returned to the fold in 1997 and since 2003 have also played in the Bezirksliga Berlin. In 2006, the club gained promotion to the Verbandsliga Berlin (VI) and has since fluctuated between this league and the Landesliga below, once more returning to the Berlin-Liga in 2016. Today the sports club has some 500 members and is one of the largest Maccabi associations in the country. The club strongly promotes dialogue between Jews and non-Jews in a sports context.  Anti-semitism  Jewish sports clubs continue to occasionally meet anti-semitism on the field. In October 2006 during Makkabi's match versus the second team squad of VSG Altglienicke in Berlin's Kreisliga-B, fans and players were reported to have chanted \\"Gas the Jews\\", \\"Auschwitz is back\\" and \\"F√ºhrer, F√ºhrer\\" as well as other slogans.German club sanctioned after anti-Semitic abuse.

The majority of the inhabitants are Greek Orthodox Christians, and a significant minority are Sunni Muslims and Protestants. Bloudan is situated on top of a hill that overlooks the Al- Zabadani plain and is surrounded by mountain forests. Its moderate temperature and low humidity in summer attracts many visitors from Damascus and throughout Syria; as a major tourist destination, it is visited by thousands every year, mainly Arabs from Lebanon and the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. In winter, Bloudan is usually snowy and draws many skiers.Grateful but grieving: Syrian refugee family grapples with uprooting. Tallahassee Democrat. Retrieved on 2018-01-23. Bloudan has many restaurants and hotels, of which the most famous is the Great Bloudan Hotel which hosted the first pan-Arab Bloudan Conference to discuss the Palestinian issue in 1937. Bloudan is also famous for its many parks and springs, such as the Abuzad, Qas'a, and Hazir springs. Climate Bloudan has a relatively cool-summer Mediterranean type of climate [Csb] with a mean year average less than 11 degrees Celsius and abundant annual precipitation [both in the form of snow and rain] averaging 690 mm. Being about 1000 metres higher than the city centre of Damascus means that Bloudan and other settlements in its vicinity are sought-after by those who want to escape the arid and hot climate of the capital city. Summers in Bloudan are long, dry, and cool while the winter season is three months long with heavy rain and snow. Etymology The current name, Bloudan, is derived from the Aramaic name Bil-dan, which means the place of the god Bil or Ba'al. Bloudan is also called the land of almond, because its forests are dominated by almond trees. History Bloudan is a very ancient village whose history goes back to the Roman era, as is evident by the paintings and carvings found in southern Bloudan. Remains of an ancient Greek Orthodox monastery and the St. George church are also found in the mountains of eastern Bloudan. The historic St. Elias valley is an ancient part of the village, with buildings that are hundreds of years old. In 1838, the population was noted as being Greek Orthodox, Catholic, and Muslim.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. 146 Modern Bloudan, constructed of rendered concrete, has largely replaced the Greek Orthodox and Catholic village built in the 18th and 19th centuries and continues to grow today.Syria & Lebanon (Footprint Travel Guide) 2001:135.

The square has an average dimension somewhat less than 200 meters in extent (comprising about 30,000 m¬≤), and the following streets meet there: *Boulevard Vincent-Auriol *Boulevard de l'H√¥pital *Boulevard Auguste-Blanqui *Avenue des Gobelins *Avenue de la S≈ìur-Rosalie *Avenue d'Italie *Avenue de Choisy *Rue Bobillot *Rue Godefroy The town hall (mairie) for the 13th arrondissement is on the Place d'Italie. History =The barrier of Italy= The old Barri√®re d'Italie in 1819 The Place d'Italie takes its name from its proximity to the Avenue d'Italie, which, traditionally, has been the point of departure on the road that links Paris and Italy, a route now called the RN7 (Route nationale 7). Until the expansion of Paris was initiated by Baron Haussmann, the site of the Place d'Italie was occupied by a section of the Wall of the Farmers- General (the wall built, under the ancien r√©gime, to prevent the evasion of excise taxes) that separated Paris from the suburb of Gentilly. The architect, Claude Nicolas Ledoux, had constructed there two pavilions for the collection of the octroi, a local tariff levied on products entering towns, which were burned during the revolution of 1789 but rebuilt and not completely eradicated until 1877. It was on this spot that General Jean-Baptiste Fid√®le Br√©a was arrested by the insurgents on 25 June 1848 during the June Uprising, before being put to death later in a public spectacle on the Avenue d'Italie. The annexation of communities bordering on Paris and the suppression of the city walls in 1860 allowed for the construction of a large roundabout which, it was hoped, could play the role of a Place de l'√âtoile of the left bank. It took the place of the barri√®re d'Italie (barrier of Italy) and part of the Avenue des Gobelins, as well as the road leading to the Ivry interchange, and, for the most part, the Boulevard d'Italie and the Boulevard d'Ivry themselves. View of the three main groupings of towers from the Tour Super-Italie The Italie 13 project, a grand exercise in urbanism, was conceived in the 1960s, and, under this plan, the Place d'Italie represented the center of a district of high-rise towers stretching out along the entire length of the Avenue d'Italie, with the construction of a truly eye-catching tower, taller than the Montparnasse Tower, called the Apogee Tower, on the Place d'Italie itself. The project began with the construction, close to the Place d'Italie, of six inter-related towers, each about one hundred metres tall, but, because of scathing criticism from the Parisian citizenry and lukewarm support from the Giscard d'Estaing government, the effort, for the most part, was abandoned in 1975. Some sort of mast or multi-colored campanile, conceived by Kenzo Tange, is now planned for the plot of land originally expected to be used by the Apogee Tower, replaced, since 1992, by a collection of smaller buildings, an office building, a luxury residential building, as well as the famous audio- visual complex, Grand √âcran Italie (Big Screen Italy). =The heart of the 13th arrondissement= Snow at Place d'Italie, November 2005 The Place d'Italie, where the principal districts of the arrondissement (Quartier des Gobelins, the Asian quarter, Butte aux Cailles, etc.) converge, is the center of automobile traffic circulation and a crossroads for most of the m√©tro and bus lines in this part of Paris. It is a major crossing-point for those leaving the city for the suburbs (and vice versa) and for those traveling between Montparnasse and the rive droite (right bank). One of the largest concentrations of Parisian business activity is in the general area of the Place d'Italie. Furthermore, it is a place for going out at night. The restaurants and cin√©mas of the Avenue des Gobelins attract many who are in search of diversion. One of the most important movie houses in Paris and the largest 35-millimetre screen in the capital, the Gaumont Grand √âcran Italie (temporarily closed now) is directly on the square. One can truly say that the 13th arrondissement revolves around the Place d'Italie, all except for the Paris Rive Gauche district along the Seine. Sites of interest *The center of the square is devoted to a small green-space. Facing the Avenue d'Italie, there is a monument in memory of the Marshal of France, Alphonse Juin, completed by the architect, Henri Cantie, the sculptor, Andr√© Greck, and the foundryman, Daniel Landowski, in 1983. *Two subway entrances, the works of Hector Guimard, have been registered in the supplemental list of historic places since 1978.Voir ce site . *At number 17 on the access road, Rue Godefroy, located between the Boulevard de l'H√¥pital and the Boulevard Vincent Auriol, a plaque recalls that the Chinese premier, Chou En-lai lived on this site, then a modest rooming house, during his time in Paris, 1922 to 1924.. *In the small garden behind the municipal building for the arrondissement, there is a sculpture, \\"Return of the Prodigal Son\\", executed in 1964 by Ossip Zadkine.Voir ce site . *A large shopping mall whose modern look was designed by the famed architect, Kenzo Tange, is also located on the square. It is called Italie 2. *The esplanade on the side of the mall nearest the Avenue d'Italie was named Place Henri-Langlois in 1995 to honor Henri Langlois, a French pioneer of the film archive movement.
